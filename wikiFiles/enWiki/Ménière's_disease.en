'''Ménière's disease''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|eɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛər|z}})<ref>''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meniere%27s%20syndrome Dictionary.com Unabridged]'' (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. Accessed on 9 September 2008</ref> is a disorder of the [[inner ear]] that can affect [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] and [[balance (ability)|balance]] to a varying degree. It is characterized by episodes of [[vertigo]], low-pitched [[tinnitus]], and hearing loss. The hearing loss is fluctuating rather than permanent, meaning that it comes and goes, alternating between ears for some time, then becomes permanent with no return to normal function. It is named after the French physician [[Prosper Ménière]], who, in an article published in 1861, first reported that [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] was caused by inner ear disorders.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The condition affects people differently; it can range in intensity from being a mild annoyance to a lifelong disability.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2073|Ménière's disease}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Menieres-hearing-loss.png|thumb|right|[[Audiogram]]s illustrating normal hearing (left) and unilateral low-pitch hearing loss associated with Ménière's disease (right).]]

Ménière's often begins with one symptom, and gradually progresses. However, not all symptoms must be present to confirm the diagnosis<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tinnitus.org/home/frame/meniere.htm | title = Information on Ménière's Syndrome | first=Jonathan | last=Hazell | accessdate=2007-02-27}}</ref> although several symptoms at once is more conclusive than different symptoms at separate times.<ref name="Maryland">{{cite web |publisher=Maryland Hearing and Balance Center |title=Meniérè's disease |url=http://www.umm.edu/otolaryngology/menieres_disease.html |accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref>  Other conditions can present themselves with Ménière's-like symptoms, such as [[syphilis]], [[Cogan's syndrome]], [[autoimmune disease]] of the inner ear, [[dysautonomia]], [[perilymph fistula]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Vestibular schwannoma|acoustic neuroma]], and both [[hypothyroidism|hypo-]] and [[hyperthyroidism]].<ref name="Haybach55">Haybach, pg. 55</ref>

The symptoms of Ménière's are variable; not all sufferers experience the same symptoms. However, so-called "classic Ménière's" is considered to have the following four symptoms:<ref>{{cite web

* '''Attacks of rotational vertigo''' that can be severe, incapacitating, unpredictable, and last anywhere from minutes to hours,<ref>Haybach, pg. 70</ref> but generally no longer than 24 hours. For some, prolonged attacks can occur, lasting from several days to several weeks, often causing the sufferer to be severely incapacitated.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | title = Epidemiology of vertigo, migraine and vestibular migraine | journal = Journal of Neurology | date = November 2008 | first = T. | last = Lempert | coauthors = Neuhauser, H. | pmid = 19225823 | volume = 256 | issue = 3 | pages = 333–338| doi = 10.1007/s00415-009-0149-2 | accessdate = 2010-06-01}}</ref> This combines with an increase in volume of tinnitus and temporary, albeit significant, hearing loss. Hearing may improve after an attack, but often becomes progressively worse. [[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[sweating]] sometimes accompany vertigo, but are symptoms of vertigo, and not of Ménière's.<ref>Haybach, p. 72</ref>
* Fluctuating, progressive, '''unilateral (in one [[ear]]) or bilateral (in both ears) [[hearing loss]]''', usually in lower frequencies.<ref>Haybach, p. 71</ref> For some, sounds can appear tinny or distorted, and patients can experience unusual [[hyperacusis|sensitivity to noises]].<ref>Haybach, pg. 79</ref>
* Unilateral or bilateral '''[[tinnitus]]'''.
* A '''sensation of fullness or pressure''' in one or both ears.

Some may have parasympathetic symptoms, which aren't necessarily symptoms of Ménière's, but rather side effects from other symptoms. These are typically [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[sweating]] which are typically symptoms of vertigo, and not of Ménière's. Vertigo may induce [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], or uncontrollable rhythmical and jerky eye movements, usually in the horizontal plane, reflecting the essential role of non-visual balance in coordinating eye movements.<ref>Haybach, pg. 46</ref>  Sudden, severe attacks of dizziness or vertigo, known informally as "drop attacks," can cause someone who is standing to suddenly fall.<ref name="Haybach90">Haybach, pg. 90</ref>  Drop attacks are likely to occur later in the disease, but can occur at any time.<ref name="Haybach90"/>
and in some cases chest pain

===Migraine===
There is an increased prevalence of migraine in patients with Ménière’s disease.

==Cause==
Ménière's disease is [[idiopathic]], but it is believed to be linked to ''endolymphatic hydrops'', an excess of fluid in the inner ear.<ref>Haybach, pg. 8</ref> It is thought that endolymphatic fluid bursts from its normal channels in the ear and flows into other areas, causing damage. This is called "hydrops." The membranous labyrinth, a system of membranes in the ear, contains a fluid called endolymph. The membranes can become dilated like a balloon when pressure increases and drainage is blocked.<ref>[http://www.american-hearing.org/disorders/menieres/menieres.html#causes Menieres Causes] at the [[American Hearing Research Foundation]] Chicago, Illinois 2008.</ref> This may be related to swelling of the [[endolymphatic sac]] or other tissues in the [[vestibular system]] of the inner ear, which is responsible for the body's sense of balance. In some cases, the endolymphatic duct may be obstructed by scar tissue, or may be narrow from birth. In some cases there may be too much fluid secreted by the [[Stria vascularis of cochlear duct|stria vascularis]]. The symptoms may occur in the presence of a [[middle ear]] [[infection]], [[head trauma]], or an [[upper respiratory tract infection]], or by using [[aspirin]], smoking [[cigarette]]s, or drinking alcohol. They may be further exacerbated by excessive consumption of [[salt]] in some patients. It has also been proposed that Ménière's symptoms in many patients are caused by the deleterious effects of a herpes virus.<ref name=" Shichinohe ">{{cite journal | last = Shichinohe | first = Mitsuo | title = Effectiveness of Acyclovir on Meniere's Syndrome III Observation of Clinical Symptoms in 301 cases | journal = Sapporo Medical Journal | volume = 68 | issue = 4/6 | pages = 71–77 | date = December 1999 | url =  | doi =  | id =  | accessdate = 2008-06-26}}</ref><ref name="pmid11464320">{{cite journal |author=Gacek RR, Gacek MR |title=Menière's disease as a manifestation of vestibular ganglionitis |journal=Am J Otolaryngol |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=241–50 |year=2001 |pmid=11464320 |doi=10.1053/ajot.2001.24822 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19142031">{{cite journal |author= Gacek RR |title= Ménière's disease is a viral neuropathy |journal=ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec. |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=78–86 |year=2009 |pmid=19142031 |doi= 10.1159/000189783 }}</ref> [[Herpesviridae]] are present in a majority of the population in a dormant state. It is suggested that the virus is reactivated when the immune system is depressed due to a stressor such as trauma, infection, or surgery (under general anesthesia). Symptoms then develop as the virus degrades the structure of the inner ear.

Ménière's disease affects about 190 people per 100,000.<ref name="Alexander">{{cite journal | title = Current Epidemiology of Meniere's Syndrome | journal = The Otolaryngologic clinics of North America | date = October 2010 | first = Alexander | last = Thomas | coauthors = Jeffrey Harris | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–970| id =  | accessdate = 2011-09-20 | pmid=20713236 | doi=10.1016/j.otc.2010.05.001}}</ref>  Recent gender predominance studies show that Ménière's tends to affect women more often than men.<ref name="Alexander" />  [[Age of onset]] typically occurs in adult years, with prevalence increasing with age.<ref name="Alexander" />

==Diagnosis==
Doctors establish a diagnosis with complaints and [[medical history]]. However, a detailed [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngological]] examination, [[audiometry]], and head [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan should be performed to exclude a [[vestibular schwannoma]] or [[superior canal dehiscence]] which would cause similar symptoms. Some of the same symptoms also occur with [[benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] (BPPV), and with [[cervical spondylosis]] (which can affect blood supply to the brain and cause vertigo). There is no definitive test for Ménière's; it is only diagnosed when all other causes have been ruled out. If any cause had been discovered, this would eliminate Ménière's disease, as by its very definition,<ref>Haybach, pg. 9</ref> as an exclusively [[idiopathic]] disease—it has no known cause.

===History===
Ménière's disease had been recognized as early as 1860s, but it was still relatively vague and broad at the time. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium (AAO HNS CHE) set criteria for diagnosing Ménière's, as well as defining two sub categories of Ménière's: cochlear (without vertigo) and vestibular (without deafness).<ref>Beasley, Jones, p.1111, para.elsei 3</ref>

In 1972, the academy defined criteria for diagnosing Ménière's disease as:<ref>Beasley, Jones, p.1111, para. 2/table I</ref>
#Fluctuating, progressive, sensorineural deafness.
#Episodic, characteristic definitive spells of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours with no unconsciousness, vestibular [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] always present.
#Usually tinnitus.
#Attacks are characterized by periods of remission and exacerbation.

In 1985, this list changed to alter wording, such as changing "deafness" to "hearing loss associated with tinnitus, characteristically of low frequencies" and requiring more than one attack of vertigo to diagnose.<ref>Beasley, Jones, p.1111, para. 4/table II</ref>  Finally in 1995, the list was again altered to allow for degrees of the disease:<ref>Beasley, Jones, p.1112, para. 2/table III</ref>
# Certain - Definite disease with [[Histopathology|histopathological]] confirmation
# Definite - Requires two or more definitive episodes of vertigo with hearing loss plus tinnitus and/or aural fullness
# Probable - Only one definitive episode of vertigo and the other symptoms and signs
# Possible - Definitive vertigo with no associated hearing loss

==Management==
Several environmental and dietary changes are thought to reduce the frequency or severity of symptom outbreaks. It is believed that since high salt diets cause water retention, it can lead to an increase (or at least preventing the decrease) of fluid within the inner ear, although the relationship between salt and the inner ear is not fully understood. High-salt intake is thought to alter the concentrations of fluid in the inner ear and Ménière's episodes could be accelerated by high-salt binges.<ref name="Greenberg">{{cite journal | title = Medical and Noninvasive Therapy for Meniere's Disease | journal = The Otolaryngologic clinics of North America | date = October 2010 | first = Simon | last = Greenberg | coauthors = Julian Nedzelski | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 1081–1090| id =  | accessdate = 2011-09-15 | pmid=20713246 | doi=10.1016/j.otc.2010.05.005}}</ref>  Recommended salt intake is often around one to two grams per day.<ref name="Greenberg" /> One source recommends taking two grams of potassium or more daily.<Jahnke, 1994>; <Woodworth et al.,2000>; <Thai-Van et al., 2001> 
Diuretics have traditionally been prescribed to facilitate a [[Low sodium diet]] although there is no definite supportive evidence.<ref name="Greenberg" />

Additionally, patients may be advised to avoid alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco, all of which can aggravate symptoms of Ménière's.  Many patients will have allergy testing done to see if they are candidates for [[allergy desensitization]], as allergies have been shown to aggravate Ménière's symptoms.<ref name="pmid10652386">{{cite journal |author=Derebery MJ |title=Allergic management of Meniere's disease: an outcome study |journal=Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages=174–82 |year=2000 |pmid=10652386 |doi=}}</ref>

Both prescription and over-the-counter medicine can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during an episode. Included are antihistamines such as [[meclozine]] or [[dimenhydrinate]], [[trimethobenzamide]] and other [[antiemetics]], [[betahistine]], [[diazepam]], or [[ginger root]].<ref>Haybach, p. 198</ref>  Betahistine, specifically, is of note because it is the only drug listed that has been proposed to prevent symptoms due to its vasodilation effect on the inner ear.<ref name="Greenberg" />

The antiherpes virus drug [[acyclovir]] has been used with some success to treat Ménière's Disease.<ref name=" Shichinohe "/> The likelihood of the effectiveness of the treatment was found to decrease with increasing duration of the disease, probably because viral suppression does not reverse damage. Morphological changes to the inner ear of Ménière's sufferers have also been found in which it was considered likely to have resulted from attack by a [[herpes simplex virus]].<ref name = "pmid11464320" /> It was considered possible that long term treatment with acyclovir (greater than six months) would be required to produce an appreciable effect on symptoms. Herpes viruses have the ability to remain dormant in nerve cells by a process known as [[HHV Latency Associated Transcript]]. Continued administration of the drug should prevent reactivation of the virus and allow for the possibility of an improvement of symptoms. Another consideration is that different strains of a herpes virus can have different characteristics which may result in differences in the precise effects of the virus. Further confirmation that acyclovir can have a positive effect on Ménière's symptoms has been reported.<ref name="pmid18235200">{{cite journal |author= Gacek RR |title= Evidence for a viral neuropathy in recurrent vertigo |journal=ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec. |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=6–14 |year=2008 |pmid=18235200 |doi= 10.1159/000111042 }}</ref>

Studies done over the use of transtympanic micropressure pulses have indicated promise with patients who had not been previously treated by gentamicin or surgery.<ref name="pmid15949105">{{cite journal |author=Rajan GP, Din S, Atlas MD |title=Long-term effects of the Meniett device in Ménière's disease: the Western Australian experience |journal=The Journal of laryngology and otology |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=391–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15949105 |doi=10.1258/0022215053945868}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gates GA, Verrall A, Green JD, Tucci DL, Telian SA |title=Meniett clinical trial: long-term follow-up |journal=Arch.

===Coping===
Sufferers tend to have high stress and anxiety due to the unpredictable nature of the disease.<ref>Haybach, p. 231</ref>  Healthy ways to combat this stress can include [[aromatherapy]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]],<ref>Haybach, p. 198-200</ref> [[meditation]], and healthy sexual activity. Greenberg and Nedzelski recommend education to alleviate feelings of depression or helplessness.<ref name="Greenberg" />

===Surgery===
If symptoms do not improve with typical treatment, more permanent surgery is considered.<ref name="Haybach180">Haybach, p. 181</ref>  Unfortunately, because the inner ear deals with both balance and hearing, few surgeries guarantee no hearing loss.

Nondestructive surgeries include those which do not actively remove any functionality, but rather aim to improve the way the ear works.<ref>Haybach, p.209</ref>  Intratympanic steroid treatments involve injecting steroids (commonly [[dexamethasone]]) into the middle ear in order to reduce inflammation and alter inner ear circulation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/treatment/it-steroids.htm | title = Intratympanic Steroid Treatment For Meniere's Disease | accessdate = 2011-01-16 | last = Hain | first = Timothy | date = 2009-06-26}}</ref>  Surgery to decompress the [[endolymphatic sac]] has shown to be effective for temporary relief from symptoms. Most patients see a decrease in vertigo occurrence, while their hearing may be unaffected. This treatment, however, does not address the long-term course of vertigo in Ménière's disease<ref>{{cite journal | last = Tsun-Sheng | first = Huang | authorlink =  | coauthors = Ching-Chen, Lin; Yun-Lan, Chang | title = Endolymphatic Sac Surgery for Meniere's Disease | journal = Acta Otolaryngol | volume =111 | issue = S485 | pages = 145–154 | publisher =  | location =  | year = 1991 | url =  | doi = 10.3109/00016489109128054 | id =  | accessdate = }}</ref> and may require repeated surgery. Danish studies even link this surgery to a very strong [[placebo]] effect, and that very little difference occurred in a 9-year followup, but could not deny the efficacy of the treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Thomsen | first = J | authorlink =  | coauthors = Bretlau, P.; Tos, M.; Johnsen, N.J. | title = Placebo effect in surgery for Meniere's disease.

Conversely, destructive surgeries are irreversible and involve removing entire functionality of most, if not all, of the affected ear.<ref>Haybach, p.212</ref>  The inner ear itself can be surgically removed via labyrinthectomy although hearing is always completely lost in the affected ear with this operation.<ref name="Maryland" />  Alternatively, a chemical labyrinthectomy, in which a drug (such as [[gentamicin]]) that "kills" the vestibular apparatus is injected into the middle ear can accomplish the same results while retaining hearing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/treatment/ttg.html | title = Intratympanic/Transtympanic Gentamicin Treatment for Meniere's Disease | accessdate = 2011-01-16 | last = Hain | first = Timothy | date = 2010-10-06}}</ref>  In more serious cases surgeons can cut the nerve to the balance portion of the inner ear in a [[Vestibular nerve|vestibular]] [[neurectomy]]. Hearing is often mostly preserved, however the surgery involves cutting open into the lining of the brain, and a hospital stay of a few days for monitoring would be required.<ref name="Haybach215">Haybach, p.215</ref>  Vertigo (and the associated nausea and vomiting) typically accompany the recovery from destructive surgeries as the brain learns to compensate.<ref name="Haybach215"/>

===Physiotherapy===
Physiotherapists also have a role in the management of Meniere’s disease. In vestibular rehabilitation, physiotherapists use interventions aimed at stabilizing gaze, reducing dizziness and increasing postural balance within the context of activities of daily living. After a vestibular assessment is conducted, the physiotherapist tailors the treatment plan to the needs of that specific patient.<ref name="Gottshall">{{cite journal|last=Gottshall|first=K.|coauthors=Topp, S. & Hoffer, M.|title=Early Vestibular Physical Therapy Rehabilitation for Meniere’s Disease|journal=Otolaryngol Clin N Am|year=2010|volume=43|pages=1113–1119}}</ref>  

The central nervous system (CNS) can be re-trained because of its plasticity, or alterability, as well as its repetitious pathways. During vestibular rehabilitation, physiotherapists take advantage of this characteristic of the CNS by provoking symptoms of dizziness or unsteadiness with head movements while allowing the visual, somatosensory and vestibular systems to interpret the information. This leads to a continuous decrease in symptoms.<ref name="Gottshall" />

Although a significant amount of research has been done regarding vestibular rehabilitation in other disorders, substantially less has been done specifically on Meniere’s disease. However, vestibular physiotherapy is currently accepted as part of best practices in the management of this condition.<ref name="Gottshall" />

The Merck Manual has added head trauma as a risk factor due to the research on 300 Meniere's patients over the past fourteen years. Michael Burcon, BPh, DC has established a link between whiplash as a result of vehicular accidents or falling on one's head and Meniere's disease. It takes an average of fifteen years after the trauma before the onset of symptoms. Case history, thermography, MRI, CScan, and/or cervical x-ray and modified Prill relative leg length tests are used for diagnosis and upper cervical specific adjustments are performed for treatment to reduce or eliminate vertigo.<ref>BurconMT, Upper Cerical Protocol for Ten Meniere's Patients, Upper Cervical Subluxation Complex, a review of the chiropractic and medical literature, Kirk Ericksen, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2004</ref>

==Prognosis==
Ménière's disease usually starts confined to one ear, but it often extends to involve both ears over time. The number of patients who end up with bilaterial Ménière's is debated, with ranges spanning from 17% to 75%.<ref name="Haybachpg10">Haybach, pg. 10</ref>

Some Ménière's disease sufferers, in severe cases, may end up losing their jobs, and will be on disability until the disease burns out.<ref>Haybach, pg. 224</ref>  However, a majority (60-80%) of sufferers will not need permanent disability and will recover with or without medical help.<ref name="Haybachpg10"/>

Hearing loss usually fluctuates in the beginning stages and becomes more permanent in later stages, although [[hearing aid]]s and [[cochlear implant]]s can help remedy damage.<ref name="Haybachpg223">Haybach, pg. 223</ref>  Tinnitus can be unpredictable, but patients usually get used to it over time.<ref name="Haybachpg223" />

Ménière's disease, being unpredictable, has a variable prognosis. Attacks could come more frequently and more severely, less frequently and less severely, and anywhere in between.<ref>Haybach, pg. 221</ref>  However, Ménière's is known to "burn out" when [[vestibular function]] has been destroyed to a stage where vertigo attacks cease.

Studies done on both right and left ear sufferers show that patients with their right ear affected tend to do significantly worse in cognitive performance.<ref>Theilgaard, Laursen, Kjaerby, ''et al''. p. 103</ref>  General intelligence was not hindered, and it was concluded that declining performance was related to how long the patient had been suffering from the disease.<ref>Theilgaard, Laursen, Kjaerby, ''et al''. p. 104</ref>

He had become extremely dizzy, fallen and then became ill. For several days Shepard felt fine, his episode apparently behind him. Until the fifth day, when he again experienced head-spinning and vomiting.28 Once again the room whirled madly. He felt and heard an awful ringing in his left ear that went as quickly as it came. It came back several times and Shepard knew something was dangerously, terribly wrong so he checked in with the flight surgeons.29 He was diagnosed with Meniere's syndrome, a condition in which fluid pressure builds up in the inner ear and makes the semicircular canals and motion detectors extremely sensitive. It results in disorientation, dizziness and nausea. He was also diagnosed with glaucoma, an elevated pressure in the eyeballs.}}</ref>

* [[Henry Solon Graves]], American Forester. Co-founder and first director of the Yale School of Forestry in New Haven, CT. Second chief of the US Forest Service. Dean of the Yale School of Forestry and also served as provost of the University. Due to the symptoms of 'Meniere's Symbole', he resigned as Chief of the US Forest Service following his return to the US from France (during WWI, he was a Lieutenant Colonel with the Army Corps of Engineers). It appears that the onset of Meniere's occurred during this time. Henry disclosed his diagnosis of "Meniere's Symbole" in a 1919 letter to his good friend, George Dudley Seymour.<ref>George Dudley Seymour Papers, Yale Manuscripts and Archives</ref>

===Possible cases===
* [[Marilyn Monroe]], American actress and cultural icon was known to experience the vertigo and compromised hearing associated with Ménière’s.<ref>Brown, Peter and Barham, Patte ''Marilyn: The Last Take''. New York: Dutton, 1992, p. 221 ISBN 0-525-93485-5</ref>
*[[Charles Darwin's illness|Charles Darwin]] may have suffered from Ménière’s disease.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Darwin’s illness revisited | journal = BMJ | volume = 339 | pages = b4968 | date = 2009-12-13 | first = John | pmid = 20008377 | last = Hayman| doi = 10.1136/bmj.b4968 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/dec11_2/b4968 | accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref> This idea is based on a common list of symptoms which were present in Darwin's case, such as tinnitus, vertigo, dizziness, motion sickness, vomiting, continual malaise and tiredness. The absence of hearing loss and 'fullness' of the ear (as far as known) excludes, however, a diagnosis of typical Ménière’s disease. Darwin himself had the opinion that most of his health problems had an origin in his 4-year bout with sea sickness. Later, he could not stand traveling by carriage, and only horse riding would not affect his health. One of the diagnoses that he received from his physicians at the time was that of "suppressed [[gout]]". The source of Darwin's illness is not known for certain. See [[Charles Darwin's health]].
