===Other===
Some studies have found increased risks of [[dermatitis]] in those exposed.<ref name=CFP07b/>

Additionally, studies have indicated that pesticide exposure is associated with long-term health problems such as respiratory problems, memory disorders and [[major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beseler CL, Stallones L, Hoppin JA, ''et al.'' |title=Depression and pesticide exposures among private pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study |journal=Environ.

According to researchers from the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), licensed pesticide applicators who used chlorinated pesticides on more than 100 days in their lifetime were at greater risk of [[diabetes]]. One study found that associations between specific pesticides and incident diabetes ranged from a 20 percent to a 200 percent increase in risk. New cases of diabetes were reported by 3.4 percent of those in the lowest pesticide use category compared with 4.6 percent of those in the highest category. Risks were greater when users of specific pesticides were compared with applicators who never applied that chemical.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Montgomery MP, Kamel F, Saldana TM, Alavanja MC, Sandler DP |title=Incident diabetes and pesticide exposure among licensed pesticide applicators: Agricultural Health Study, 1993-2003 |journal=Am J Epidemiol.  |volume=167 |issue=10 |pages=235–46. |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18343878 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwn028 |pmc=2832308}}</ref><ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541427/ Newswise: Long-term Pesticide Exposure May Increase Risk of Diabetes] Retrieved on June 4, 2008.</ref>

==Route of exposure==
People can be exposed to pesticides by a number of different routes including: occupation, in the home, at school and in their food.

There are concerns that pesticides used to control pests on food crops are dangerous to people who consume those foods. These concerns are one reason for the [[organic food]] movement. Many food crops, including fruits and vegetables, contain [[pesticide residue]]s after being washed or peeled. Chemicals that are no longer used but that are resistant to breakdown for long periods may remain in soil and water and thus in food.<ref name=cornellvet>Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine (March 1999), [http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/FactSheet/Pesticide/fs24.consumer.cfm Consumer concerns about pesticides in food]. Fact Sheet #24. Retrieved on 2007-10-25.</ref>

The United Nations [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission has recommended international standards for [[maximum residue limit]]s (MRLs), for individual pesticides in food.<ref>Codex Alimentarius Commission [http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/1/CXP_020e.pdf Code of Ethics for International Trade in Food]. CAC/RCP 20-1979 (Rev. 1-1985). Retrieved on 2007-10-25.</ref>  

In the EU, [[Maximum Residue Limit|MRLs]] are set by [http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/index_en.htm DG-SANCO].

In the United States, levels of residues that remain on foods are limited to tolerance levels that are established by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and are considered safe.<ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (March 27, 2007), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm Pesticides and food: What the pesticide residue limits are on food]. epa.gov. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.</ref> The EPA sets the tolerances based on the toxicity of the pesticide and its breakdown products, the amount and frequency of [[pesticide application]], and how much of the pesticide (i.e., the residue) remains in or on food by the time it is marketed and prepared.<ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (July 24th, 2007), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/stprf.htm Setting tolerances for pesticide residues in foods]. epa.gov. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.</ref> Tolerance levels are obtained using scientific risk assessments that pesticide manufacturers are required to produce by conducting toxicological studies, exposure modeling and residue studies before a particular pesticide can be registered, however, the effects are tested for single pesticides, and there is little information on possible [[synergistic]] effects of exposure to multiple pesticide traces in the air, food and water.<ref>Rabideau, Christine L. [http://es.epa.gov/ncer/fellow/progress/99/rabideauch00.html Multiple pesticide exposure: Immunotoxicty and oxidative tress] 2001</ref>

Strawberries and tomatoes are the two crops with the most intensive use of soil fumigants. They are particularly vulnerable to several type of diseases, insects, mites, and parasitic worms. In 2003, in California alone, 3.7 million pounds (1,700 metric tons) of [[metam sodium]] were used on tomatoes. In recent years other farmers have demonstrated that it is possible to produce strawberries and tomatoes without the use of harmful chemicals and in a cost effective way.<ref>{{cite book | author=Levine, Marvin J. | title=Pesticides: A Toxic Time Bomb in our Midst | publisher=Praeger Publishers | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-275-99127-2 | pages=213–214}}</ref>

Exposure routes other than consuming food that contains residues, in particular [[pesticide drift]], are potentially significant to the general public.<ref>[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (December 1999), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/spraydrift.htm Spray drift of pesticides]. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.</ref>

Some pesticides can remain in the environment for prolonged periods of time. For example, most people in the United States still have detectable levels of DDT in their bodies even though it was banned in the US in 1972.<ref name="Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B 2010 103–10"/>

==Prevention==
Pesticides exposure cannot be studied in [[placebo controlled trials]] as this would be unethical.<ref name=CFP07b/> A definitive cause effect relationship therefore cannot be established.<ref name=CFP07b/> Consistent evidence can and has been gathered through other study designs.<ref name=CFP07b/> The [[precautionary principle]] is thus frequently used in [[environmental law]] such that absolute proof is not required before efforts to decrease exposure to potential toxins are enacted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lockwood AH |title=Pesticides and parkinsonism: is there an etiological link? |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurol. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=687–90 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11148671 |doi= 10.1097/00019052-200012000-00013|url=}}</ref>

The [[American Medical Association]] recommend limiting exposure to pesticides.<ref name=Council1997/> They came to this conclusion due to the fact that surveillance systems currently in place are inadequate to determine problems related to exposure.<ref name=Council1997>{{cite journal |author= |title=Educational and informational strategies to reduce pesticide risks.

==Epidemiology==
The [[World Health Organization]] and the [[UN Environment Programme]] estimate that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe [[Pesticide poisoning|poisoning from pesticides]], about 18,000 of whom die.<ref name="sustaining">Miller GT (2004), ''Sustaining the Earth'', 6th edition. Thompson Learning, Inc. Pacific Grove, California. Chapter 9, Pages 211-216.</ref> According to one study, as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide poisoning yearly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jeyaratnam J |title=Acute pesticide poisoning: a major global health problem |journal=World Health Stat Q |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=139–44 |year=1990 |pmid=2238694 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Detectable levels of 50 different pesticides were found in the blood of a representative sample of the U.S. population.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B |title=Pesticides and health risks |journal=J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=103–10 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20409108 |doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.2009.01092.x |quote=Biomonitoring results of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2006) are published in a report titled Third Exposure to Environmental Chemicals Report (2005).

==Society and culture==
Concerns regarding [[conflict of interests]] regarding the research base have been raised. A number of researchers involved with pesticides have been found to have undisclosed ties to industry including: [[Richard Doll]] or the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] in England and [[Hans-Olov Adami]] of the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Sweden.<ref name=Secret2007>{{cite journal |author=Hardell L, Walker MJ, Walhjalt B, Friedman LS, Richter ED |title=Secret ties to industry and conflicting interests in cancer research |journal=Am.
