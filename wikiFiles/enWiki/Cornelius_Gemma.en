'''Cornelius''' (or '''Cornelio''') '''Gemma''' (28 February 1535 – 12 October 1578)<ref>In his [[Latin]] biography, [[Melchior Adam]] says that Gemma died on October 12, 1579, at the age of 45; modern scholars, however, almost uniformly cite 1578 as the year of his death.</ref> was a physician, astronomer and [[Astrology#Before the modern era|astrologer]], and the oldest son of [[cartographer]] and instrument-maker [[Gemma Frisius]]. He was a professor of medicine at [[Catholic University of Leuven]], and shared in his father's efforts to restore ancient [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic practice]] to astrology, drawing on the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''.

As an astronomer, Gemma is significant for his observations of a [[lunar eclipse]] in 1569 and of the [[Tycho Brahe#The 1572 supernova|1572 supernova]] appearing in [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], which he recorded on 9 November, two days before [[Tycho Brahe]], calling it a "New Venus."<ref>[[University of Otago]] Library exhibition note for ''The Earth & Beyond''  [http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/delights/case_eight.html online]; and R.H. Allen, ''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning'', Bill Thayer's edition at [[LacusCurtius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Cassiopeia*.html "Cassiopeia."] The star is now identified as [[SN 1572]].</ref> With Brahe, he was one of the few astronomers to identify the [[Great Comet of 1577]] as superlunary. Gemma is also credited with publishing the first scientific illustration of the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], in his 1575 book on the supernova.<ref>University of Oklahoma Libraries, History of Science Collections, Recent Acquisitions, "The First Book Printed on Tycho Brahe's Printing Press at Uraniborg: ''Diarium'', 1586," ''The Lynx'' 2 (November 2005), p. 9 [http://hsci.cas.ou.edu/images/lynx/Lynx-02-view.pdf online] with Gemma's illustration.</ref>

Another milestone appears in his medical writings: in 1552, Gemma published the first illustration of a human [[tapeworm]].<ref>[[University of Würzburg]], Parasitology Research & Encyclopedic Reference of Parasitology [http://parasitology.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/login/n/h/0661-0001_a.pdf online.]</ref>

Gemma's two major works, ''De arte cyclognomica'' (Antwerp, 1569) and ''De naturae divinis characterismis'' (Antwerp, 1575), have been called "true 'hidden gems' in early modern intellectual history," bringing together such topics as medicine, astronomy, astrology, [[teratology]], [[divination]], [[eschatology]], and [[Encyclopedia#History|encyclopaedism]].<ref>''Cornelius Gemma: Cosmology, Medicine and Natural Philosophy in Renaissance Louvain'' conference proceedings [http://www.livinghistory.co.uk/homepages/hermes/gemma.htm website.]</ref>

Gemma also has the distinction of being called "the first true [[orchid]] hobbyist, in the modern sense."<ref>Pierre Jacquet, "History of Orchids in Europe, from Antiquity to the 17th Century," ''''Orchid Biology: Reviews and Perspectives'' 6 (1994), as cited by Joseph Arditti, ''Orchid Biology'' (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2002), p. 27 [http://books.google.com/books?id=7Lw5dssNrwEC&pg=PA26&dq=%22Cornelius+Gemma%22+intitle:Orchid+intitle:Biology&lr=&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA27,M1 online.]</ref>

==Life==
Cornelius Gemma was born and died in [[Leuven]], but attended [[Latin school]] in [[Mechelen]]. He began studying with the arts faculty at Leuven at the age of 15, and continued at the medical faculty. In 1569, he succeeded professor Nicolas Biesius and obtained a [[Doctorate#History|doctorate]] in 1570.

Gemma died around 1578 in an epidemic of the plague, to which a third of the population at [[Leuven]] also succumbed.<ref>Steven Vanden Broecke, ''The Limits of Influence: Pico, Louvain, and the Crisis of Renaissance Astrology'' (Brill, 2003), p. 186.</ref> Although he had already proven to be a prolific writer, he was only in his mid-forties. His [[epitaph]] consists of two [[elegiac couplet]]s in [[Latin]], punning on ''lapis'' ("stone, precious stone, tombstone") and ''Gemma'' ("precious stone, gem"). He was survived by two sons: Raphael, who entered the priesthood, and Philip, who followed family tradition as a medical doctor.<ref>[[Melchior Adam]], "Cornelius Gemma" in ''Vitae Germanorum medicorum'' (1620), p. 239 [http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/adam/adam2/s271.html online facsimile.]</ref>

==Works==
Gemma edited his father's posthumous work ''De astrolabo catholica'' (1556). In 1560, he began publishing his own work in the annual series ''Ephemerides meteorologicae'', printed by Joannes Withagen. The ''Ephemerides'' is the earliest known astrological work from the [[Low Countries]] to carry an official notice of approval from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Gemma moved away from [[judicial astrology]] and renounced astrological predictions about political events, and seems to have gradually confined himself to predictions about astronomical phenomena and [[meteorological astrology]]. His predictions for 1561, for example, provided detailed information on every [[lunar phase]], and most [[Astrological aspect|planetary aspects]] and phases of fixed stars in relation to the sun, with a thoroughness that surpassed the predictions of his contemporaries.<ref>Vanden Broecke, ''The Limits of Influence'', pp. 186–190.</ref> He remained committed to [[Medical astrology|astrologic medicine]], however, and believed that predictable atmospheric conditions, extending to [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|astral conjunctions]], generated disease.<ref>[[Lynn Thorndike]], ''History of Magic and Experimental Science'', unknown edition, p. 408.</ref>

Gemma attempted to formulate a universal philosophy that brought together inferiors and celestials, nature, soul and intellect, numbers, ideas and external objects. In the three volumes ''De arte cyclognomica'', he synthesized the teachings of [[Hippocrates]], [[Plato]], [[Galen]], and [[Aristotle]] by a method perhaps derived from [[Ramon Llull|Lullius]]. This "cyclognomic art" is an arrangement of seven concentric circles, starting from the outermost:
:*substances;
:*accidents;
:*absolute predicates;
:*relatives;
:*virtues;
:*vices;
:*questions.<ref>Charles P. Krauth, ''A Vocabulary of the Philosophical Sciences'' (New York 1878), p. 625 [http://books.google.com/books?id=9uVDAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA624&lpg=RA1-PA624&dq=cyclognomic&source=bl&ots=ed55poXHyz&sig=-JJ2f0tvGVsF4hGXja_MxsJ0AT4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result#PRA1-PA625,M1 online.]</ref>
A profusion of charts, celestial diagrams, and [[Spherical trigonometry|spherical triangles]] is characteristic of Gemma's ''ars cyclognomica'', as is the use of [[3 (number)#In philosophy|three as a mystic number]]. Disciplines are grouped under three faculties or spheres:
:*''imaginatio'' (physics, astronomy, medicine and related fields);
:*''ratio'' (grammar, rhetoric, cyclognomic, [[dialectic]]);
:*''intellectus'' ([[metaphysics]] subdivided into mathematics, [[ethics]], and [[theology]]).<ref>Grazia Tonelli Olivieri, "Galen and Francis Bacon: Faculties of the Soul and the Classification of Knowledge," in ''The Shape of Knowledge from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment'' (Springer, 1991) [http://books.google.com/books?id=6TXsJxORgUsC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=cyclognomic&source=web&ots=WtAejCrTnY&sig=IViLI8Iy54j1SH0Ts2xiY28vfTo&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result online.]</ref>

Gemma's two volumes ''De naturae divinis characterismis'' (1575), on divine marks or features in nature, included tales of medical marvels. An example may be found [http://books.google.com/books?id=sELw6k2e7jsC&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=%22Cornelius+Gemma%22&source=web&ots=LjwWL3gYId&sig=yEGw2FIIk5QTqeS35XKnIMJx_uM&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result online] in the ''Compendium Maleficiarum'' of [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]]: a 15-year-old girl was reported to excrete a live eel and to vomit a prodigious stream of hairs, skin fragments, stones and bones. Although the cause was thought to be [[demon]]ic, Gemma is said to have approached treatment with "natural causes." Guazzo also says that Gemma discussed spontaneous [[Sex change|sex change in humans]].<ref>[[Francesco Maria Guazzo]], ''Compendium Maleficiarum'' (1628, republished 1920 and 2004), pp. 57 and 108.</ref>

Gemma viewed the relation of [[omen|prodigies]] and [[cosmology]] in light of his medical practice; that is, just as a physician could interpret a patient's [[symptom]]s to predict disease, a reading of prodigies in nature could provide insight into divine intention in the universe. He regarded this ''ars cosmocritica'' as a new science.<ref>Stuart Clark, ''Thinking with Demons: The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 367 [http://books.google.com/books?id=8a758cCSKY0C&pg=PA367&lpg=PA367&dq=%22Cornelius+Gemma%22&source=web&ots=o8W-sGxIV3&sig=z0fNCOSWEDHrS1aGoGuSWxMDy5U&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=41&ct=result#PPA367,M1 online.]</ref>

===The Great Comet of 1577===
One of Gemma's more scientifically significant works<ref>''De prodigiosa specie, naturaque Cometae, qui nobis effulsit altior lunae sedibus, insolita prorsus figura, ac magnitudine, anno 1570''.</ref> dealt with the [[Great Comet of 1577]], which he first observed on 14 November of that year. Gemma was one of the few astronomers — most famously [[Tycho Brahe]], but also [[Helisaeus Roeslin]], [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]]  and [[Michael Mästlin]] — who identified the comet as [[superlunary]].<ref>Robert S. Westman, "The Comet and the Cosmos: Kepler, Mästlin, and the Copernican Hypothesis," in ''The Reception of Copernicus' Heliocentric Theory: Proceedings of a Symposium Organized by the Nicolas Copernicus Committee of the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science, Torun, Poland, 1973'' (Springer, 1973), pp. 10 and 28. For a description and reproduction of [[Helisaeus Roeslin]]'s diagram, see pp. 28–29 [http://books.google.com/books?id=tAWp34_GYLAC&pg=PA28&dq=%22Helisaeus+Roeslin%27s+diagram%22&lr=&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]</ref> Brahe was highly critical of his colleague's mathematical deficiencies, but praised his section on macrocosmic portents and on the comet's physical characteristics. Gemma subordinated his accurate astronomical observations to a moral purpose; "to Gemma," writes Tabitta van Nouhuys, "the investigation of the comet's mathematical and physical characteristics was not an end in itself, but a means of gaining an insight into the arrangement of the cosmos and the divinely inspired sympathies between its parts."<ref>Tabitta van Nouhuys, ''The Age of Two-faced Janus'' (Brill, 1998),  pp. 169–189.</ref>
