'''Ketoconazole''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|k|iː|t|ɵ|ˈ|k|oʊ|n|ə|z|ɒ|l}}) is a synthetic [[antifungal drug|antifungal]] and [[antiandrogens|antiandrogenic]] drug used to [[prophylaxis|prevent]] and treat fungal skin infections, especially in [[Immune deficiency|immunocompromised]] patients such as those with [[AIDS]] or those on chemotherapy. Ketoconazole is sold commercially as an anti[[dandruff]] [[shampoo]], [[topical]] [[cream]], and [[oral administration|oral]] [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]].

Ketoconazole is very [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]], which leads to accumulation in fatty tissues. The less [[toxic]] and more effective [[triazole]] compounds [[fluconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] are sometimes preferred for internal use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly [[acid]]ic levels, so [[antacid]]s or other causes of decreased [[stomach]] acid levels will lower the drug's absorption when taken orally. Absorption can be increased by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as [[cola]].<ref>{{cite journal |author = Chin TW, Loeb M, Fong IW |title=Effects of an acidic beverage (Glass of Orange Juice) on absorption of ketoconazole |volume=39|issue=8 |pages=1671–5 |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7486898 |pmc=162805}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==

=== Antifungal ===
Ketoconazole is usually prescribed for topical infections such as [[athlete's foot]], [[ringworm]], [[candidiasis]] (yeast infection or thrush), and [[jock itch]]. The over-the-counter [[shampoo]] version can also be used as a body wash for the treatment of [[tinea versicolor]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001465.htm#Treatment MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: ''Tinea versicolor''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.aad.org/public/publications/pamphlets/common_tinea.html Tinea Versicolor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Ketoconazole is used to treat [[eumycetoma]], the fungal form of [[mycetoma]].

The side effects of ketoconazole are sometimes used to treat nonfungal problems. The decrease in [[testosterone]] caused by the drug makes it useful for treating [[prostate cancer]] and for preventing postoperative erections<ref>{{cite journal | first = K.

Ketoconazole is also used in combination with other drugs such as [[zinc pyrithione]] in rinse-off products. The antidandruff shampoo is designed for people who have a more serious case of dandruff where symptoms include, but are not limited to constant, nonstop flaking, and severe itchiness.

It is a [[Pregnancy category (pharmaceutical)|pregnancy category C]] drug because [[animal testing]] has shown it to cause [[Teratology|teratogenesis]] in high dosages. Recently, two human test cases (both during the treatment of [[Cushing's syndrome]])<ref name=pregnancy_1>

===Hair loss===
[[File:Nizoral.jpg|thumb|Nizoral (ketoconazole) 2% shampoo]]

Preliminary research suggests ketoconazole shampoo may be beneficial in men suffering from [[androgenic alopecia]]. Support for this comes from a study in 1998 that compared ketoconazole 2% to the proven hair loss drug [[minoxidil]] 2% in men with androgenic alopecia.<ref name="study">[http://www.hairlosstalk.com/hair-loss-pdf/nizoral-study.pdf Ketoconazole Shampoo: Effect of Long-Term Use in Androgenic Alopecia]</ref> In a sample of 27 men, "[h]air density and size and proportion of [[hair follicle#Hair-follicle cycling|anagen follicles]] were improved almost similarly by both ketoconazole and minoxidil regimens." The men washed with ketoconazole 2% shampoo once every two to four days, leaving the shampoo on the scalp for three to five minutes before rinsing (as with the treatment of [[dandruff]] and [[seborrheic dermatitis]]).<ref name="study"/>
While ketoconazole's mechanism of action in hair loss is still unclear, the researchers in the 1998 study postulated both hormones and the immune system may act synergistically to cause injury to the hair follicle. Since ketoconazole effectively treats the ''[[Malassezia]]'' fungus that commonly inhabits the scalp, the researchers hypothesized it may prevent hair loss by reducing inflammation from the fungus, in addition to having a direct [[anti-inflammatory]] effect. The researchers were guarded about the meaning of their results, saying more rigorous studies on larger groups of men should be done to confirm the findings, both to evaluate the ideal dosage and formulation, and to assess the desirability of routine treatment in this condition.

In 2002, a study of 150 men at the [[University of Liège]] in Belgium found 1% ketoconazole shampoo used for six months increased hair shaft diameter by 5.4%, increased [[hair follicle#Hair-follicle cycling|anagen hair]] by 4.9%, and decreased hair shedding by 17.3%, although it found no effect on hair density.<ref name="pmid18498517">{{cite journal |author=Piérard-Franchimont C, Goffin V, Henry F, Uhoda I, Braham C, Piérard GE |title=Nudging hair shedding by antidandruff shampoos.

Although ketoconazole may be useful as a hair loss treatment, the shampoo is currently only [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA-approved]] for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp.

===Veterinary===
This medication is also sometimes prescribed by [[veterinarian]]s for use on pets, often as unflavored tablets that may need to be cut to smaller size for correct dosage.<ref>[http://petscriptions.com/index.php?level2=catalog&level3=item_detail&item_id=1209 Ketoconazole for Your Pet at Petscriptions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
As an antifungal, ketoconazole is structurally similar to [[imidazole]], and interferes with the fungal synthesis of [[ergosterol]], a constituent of fungal [[cell membrane]]s, as well as certain [[enzyme]]s. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome P450]] 14-alpha-demethylase (P45014DM).<ref>{{Cite journal|pmc=437014|doi=10.1172/JCI110903|title=Ketoconazole blocks adrenal steroidogenesis by inhibiting cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes|year=1983|last1=Loose|first1=D S|last2=Kan|first2=P B|last3=Hirst|first3=M A|last4=Marcus|first4=R A|last5=Feldman|first5=D|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=71|issue=5|pages=1495–9|pmid=6304148}}</ref> This enzyme participates in the [[sterol]] [[biosynthesis]] pathway that leads from [[lanosterol]] to [[ergosterol]]. Lower doses of [[fluconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes.

As an [[antiandrogen]], ketoconazole operates through at least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 400&nbsp;mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels.<ref name="pmid2652864">{{cite journal |author=Witjes FJ, Debruyne FM, Fernandez del Moral P, Geboers AD |title=Ketoconazole high dose in management of hormonally pretreated patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer. Dutch South-Eastern Urological Cooperative Group |journal=Urology |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=411–5 |year=1989 |month=May |pmid=2652864 |doi= 10.1016/0090-4295(89)90037-X|url=}}</ref> It produces this effect through inhibition of cytochrome P450 and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer.<ref name="pmid8603034">{{cite journal |author=De Coster R, Wouters W, Bruynseels J |title=P450-dependent enzymes as targets for prostate cancer therapy |journal=J.

This effect is thought to be quite weak, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole.<ref name="pmid1526623">{{cite journal |author=Eil C |title=Ketoconazole binds to the human androgen receptor |journal=Horm. Metab. Res. |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=367–70 |year=1992 |month=August |pmid=1526623 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1003337 |url=}}</ref>

==Susceptible fungi==
Ketoconazole inhibits growth of [[dermatophyte]]s and [[yeast]] species such as ''[[Candida albicans]]''. The rise in the number of HIV/AIDS immunocompromised patients has led to an increase in the frequency and significance of opportunistic fungal infections. Resistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including ''C. albicans''. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) genes<ref>[http://www.online-medical-dictionary.org/MDR+Gene.asp?q=MDR+Gene MDR Gene: on Medical Dictionary Online]</ref> can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family.

==Synthesis==

The first racemic synthesis of ketoconazole was published in 1979. In this synthesis, ''cis''- and ''trans''-isomers were separated by crystallization because only the two ''cis''-enantiomers are used in the commercially available drug.

[[File:Ketoconazole synthesis1.tif|thumb|center|600px|Synthesis of ketoconazole ('''8''')]]

The synthesis was started with dichloroacetophenone ('''1''') and glycerine. The ketal was directly brominated to yield alcohol '''2'''. This was further transformed into the corresponding benoylic ester '''3''' and at this stage ''cis''- and ''trans''-isomers were separated. The imidazole residue was then introduced followed by a basic hydrolysis of the ester moiety. The free hydroxyl group of '''5''' was converted into the mesylate and was then replaced by substituent '''7''' to yield ketoconazole '''8''' in six steps and an overall yield of 12%.

==History==
Ketoconazole was discovered in 1976 and released in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heeres|first=J.|coauthors=Backx, L. J. J.; Mostmans, J. H.; Van Cutsem, J.|title=Antimycotic imidazoles. Part 4.
