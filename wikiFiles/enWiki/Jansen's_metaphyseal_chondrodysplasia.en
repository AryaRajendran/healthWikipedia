'''Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia''' or '''JMC''' is a disease  that results from ligand-independent activation of the type 1 of the [[parathyroid hormone receptor]] ([[PTHR1]]), due to one of three reported mutations (activating mutation).

JMC is extremely rare and as of 2007 there are less than 20 reported cases worldwide.

==Presentation==
Blood levels of parathryoid hormone (PTH) are undetectable, but the mutation in the PTHR1 leads to auto-activation of the signaling as though the hormone PTH was present.  Severe JMC produces a dwarfing [[phenotype]], or  short stature. Examination of the bone reveals normal [[epiphyseal plate]]s but disorganized [[metaphyseal]]  regions.  [[Hypercalcemia]] (elevated levels of calcium in the blood) )and [[hypophosphatemia]] (reduced blood levels of phosphorus), and elevated urinary calcium and phosphorus are generally found in JMC.  The absence of hypercalcemia does not eliminate the disease from consideration.

Physical irregularities often associated with Jansen's include: prominent or protruding eyes, a high arched palate, [[micrognathia]] or abnormal smallness of the jaws - particularly the lower (mandible) jaw, [[choana]]l [[stenosis]], wide [[cranial sutures]] and irregular formation of the long bones which can resemble [[rickets]].  [[Nephrocalcinosis]] (accumulation of calcium in the [[interstitum]] of the kidney) is seen commonly as well.

==Treatment==
There is no known treatment at present, although some investigators have tried to lessen the hypercalcemia with various forms of [[bisphosphonates]].

==Note==
There is one known family in which the disease was transmitted mother to daughter.
