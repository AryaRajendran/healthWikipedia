In the study of [[Transsexualism|transsexuality]], the idea of a '''feminine essence''' refers to the proposal that [[Trans woman|male-to-female transsexuals]] are females trapped in male bodies.  This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., as well as in more literal senses such as having a female brain structure; it is also a [[psychological narrative]], that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.

According to sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and Kiira Triea, "the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies."  They reject the idea, claiming that "The persistence of the predominant cultural understanding, while explicable, is damaging to science and to many transsexuals."<ref name=Bailey2007>{{cite journal | author = Bailey J.

"The narrative has been extended to an etiological theory, which Lawrence (2007b) has called "the brainsex theory of transsexualism."

Modern [[sexologists]] including Blanchard reject the idea that these transsexuals are "literally" female.  A more "figurative" interpretation, involving neurologically mediated [[gender identity]], was supported historically by pioneering sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]].<ref name=HBS />  There continues to be debate regarding whether and to what extent male-to-female transsexuals are ''like'' natal females rather than ''are'' females.

==Description==

The "feminine essence" idea predates modern psychological studies,<ref name="How Sex Changed" /> and was supported by some early sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]] ("the father of transsexualism"), who revived the idea of [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] that a person might have a "female soul trapped in a male body."<ref>{{cite book

Modern researchers classify the common story told by transwomen about themselves as a [[psychological narrative]], and therefore refer to this idea as the "feminine essence narrative".  In his book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] gives these statements as a prototypical example of the feminine essence narrative:  "Since I can remember, I have always felt as if I were a member of the other sex. I have felt like a freak with this body and detest my penis. I must get sex reassignment surgery (a "sex change operation") in order to match my external body with my internal mind."<ref name =Dreger2008/> 

==Blanchard's interpretation: "Feminine essence theory"==

In 2008, Ray Blanchard presented the idea in the form of a theory in a commentary entitled "Deconstructing the Feminine Essence Narrative" in which he lists what he considers to be "the central tenets of the feminine essence theory", and then refutes each of these tenets:<ref name = Blanchard2008/><blockquote>

#Male-to-female transsexuals are, in some literal sense and not just in a figurative sense, women inside men’s bodies.
#There is only one type of woman, therefore there can be only one type of (true) male-to-female transsexual.
#Apparent differences among male-to-female transsexuals are relatively superficial and irrelevant to the basic unity of the transsexual syndrome.
#Male-to-female transsexuals have no unique, behavioral or psychological characteristics that are absent in typical men and women.
</blockquote>

==Neuroanatomic research==

According to Bailey and Triea,<ref name=Bailey2007/> one of the predictions based on the feminine essence theory is that male-to-female transsexuals would possess female rather than male brain anatomy. A widely cited research study of this topic examined the brain anatomy of six deceased male-to-female transsexuals, who had undergone during their lives hormonal treatment and surgical sex reassignment.<ref name=Zhou1995>{{cite journal | author = Zhou J. N., Hofman M. A., Gooren L. J. G., Swaab D. F. | year = 1995 | title = A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 378 | issue = 6552| pages = 68–70 | doi = 10.1038/378068a0 | pmid = 7477289 }}</ref> The study reported that a brain structure called the "central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis" (BSTc), which is larger in typical males than in typical females, was in the female range in the transsexual subjects. The interpretation and the methods of that study have been criticized,<ref name=LawrenceWeb>[http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/brain-sex_critique.html Transsexual women’s resources, by Dr. Anne Lawrence]</ref> and the finding continues to be a matter of debate.

Neurological research has found that the brains of transsexuals differ in a number of ways.  For example a study done on the brains of non-homosexual transsexuals using MRI and pheromones as stimuli found that transsexuals process smelling androgen and estrogen in the same way that women do. Previous research by the same team found that homosexual males also process smelling the pheromones of the sexes in a way that is similar to that of women.<ref name="pheroMTF">[http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhm216v1?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=1&title=transsexual&andorexacttitle=and&andorexacttitleabs=and&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT "Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids"], by H. Berglund1,  P. Lindström2,  C. Dhejne-Helmy3 and  I. Savic2, Cerebral Cortex</ref>   Work done by [[Simon LeVay]] had previously found that the hypothalamus of homosexual males has a region which is similar in size to that of heterosexual females.<ref name="levay">[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/nature-nurture/levay.html A Difference in Hypothalmic Structure Between Heterosexual and Homosexual Men Simon LeVay]</ref>  This is not so in non-homosexual males.<ref name="levay"/> Last but not least a study done by Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol reached the conclusion that the brain does change in overall volume and the volume of its parts with the use of cross-sex hormone supplements.<ref name="CSCB">[http://www.eje-online.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/suppl_1/S107 Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure] Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol,  Peggy T Cohen-Kettenis1,  Neeltje E M Van Haren,  Jiska S Peper, Rachel G H Brans,  Wiepke Cahn,  Hugo G Schnack,  Louis J G Gooren2 and  René S Kahn</ref>  In the case of male-to-female transsexuals, the brain assumes the proportions of a female brain.<ref name="CSCB"/>

==Other findings==

The main support for the feminine essence narrative is that many male-to-female transsexuals say they feel it to be true; many autobiographical and clinical accounts by or about transsexual individuals contain variations of the statement of having a female soul or needing to make the external body resemble the inner or true self.<ref name=Brown1996>Brown, M. L., & Rounsley, C. A. (1996). ''True selves: Understanding transsexualism.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</ref><ref name=Ettner1999>Ettner, R. (1999). ''Gender loving care: A guide to counseling gender-variant clients.'' New York: W. W. Norton.ISBN 0393703045 </ref>

Critics of this narrative consider it to be inconsistent with their research findings.  Blanchard has reported finding that there are two, and not one, types of male-to-female transsexual and that they differ with regard to their sexual interests, whether they were overtly gender atypical in childhood, how easily they pass as female, the ages at which they decide to transition to female, birth order, and their physical height and weight.<ref name=Blanchard1990>Blanchard, R., & Steiner, B. W. (1990). ''Clinical management of gender identity disorders in children and adults.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. ISBN 0-88048-187-0 </ref><ref name=Smith2005a>{{cite journal | author = Smith Y. L. S., van Goozen S. H. M., Kuiper A.

W., Clemmensen L. H., Dickey R. | year = 1989 | title = Prediction of regrets in postoperative transsexuals | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 43–45 }}</ref><ref name=Smith2005b>{{cite journal | author = Smith Y.

==Role of medical community in perpetuating this narrative==

Since the medical community has guidelines for what types of transsexuals qualify for [[sex reassignment surgery]], transsexuals sometimes adopt and tell the story that they believe will best help them qualify – the "feminine essence narrative" – and representing themselves as "essentially female", which may explain at least part of the prevalence of the feminine essence narrative.<ref>{{cite book

==Terminology==

The phrase "feminine soul enclosed in a male body" (''anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa'') was introduced in 1868 by [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]], not to describe male-to-female transsexuals, none of whom existed yet as such, but to describe a type of gay men who self-identified as feminine.<ref name=Ulrichs1868>Ulrichs, Karl-Heinrich (1868). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=k-2eOwAACAAJ&dq=intitle:Memnon+inauthor:Ulrichs&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=0_2 "Memnon.": Die Geschlechtsnatur des mannliebenden Urnings, eine naturwissenschaftliche Darstellung: körperlich-seelischer Hermaphroditismus.
