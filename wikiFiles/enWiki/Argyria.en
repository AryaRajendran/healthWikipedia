'''Argyria''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: ἄργυρος ''argyros'' [[silver]] + -ia) is a [[Medical condition|condition]] caused by improper exposure to chemical forms of the element [[silver]], silver dust, or silver compounds.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |first1=William D. |last1=James |first2=Timothy G. |last2=Berger |first3=Dirk M. |last3=Elston |first4=Richard B. |last4=Odom |title=Andrews' diseases of the skin: clinical dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |page=858 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc=62736861}}</ref> The most dramatic symptom of argyria is that the [[skin]] becomes blue or bluish-grey colored. Argyria may be found as generalized argyria or local argyria. [[Argyrosis]] is the corresponding condition related to the eye.

==Biological effect==
In animals and humans, silver accumulates in the body over time.<ref name="FungBowen1996">{{cite journal |author=Fung MC, Bowen DL |title=Silver products for medical indications: risk-benefit assessment |journal=Journal of Toxicology.

As in photography (where silver is used due to its sensitivity to light), these particles in the skin darken with exposure to sunlight, resulting in a blue or gray discoloration of the skin. This condition is known as argyria.

Generally, "silver exhibits low toxicity in the human body, and minimal risk is expected due to clinical exposure,"<ref name="Lansdown2006"/> when silver or silver compounds are used in the treatment of external infections or in medical appliances. Dr Alan BG Lansdown, Honorary Senior Research Fellow and Senior Lecturer in Chemical Pathology, Clinical Chemistry and Investigative Sciences at Imperial College London, states that "Chronic ingestion or inhalation of silver preparations (especially colloidal silver) can lead to deposition of silver metal/silver sulphide particles in the skin (argyria), eye (argyrosis) and other organs. These are not life-threatening conditions but cosmetically undesirable.”<ref name="Lansdown2006"/> This view is supported by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)<ref>http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts146.html</ref><ref>http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp146-c1.pdf</ref> and other authorities.<ref name="FungBowen1996"/> 

The reference dose, published by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1991, which represents the estimated daily exposure which is unlikely to incur an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime, is 5&nbsp;µg/(kg*d).<ref name="FungBowen1996"/>

== History ==
Since at least the early part of the 20th century, doctors have known that silver or silver compounds can cause some areas of the skin and other body tissues to turn gray or blue-gray. Argyria occurs in people who ingest or inhale silver in large quantities over a long period (several months to many years). People who work in factories that manufacture silver can also breathe in silver or its compounds. In the past, some of these workers have become argyric. However, the level of silver in the air and the length of exposure that caused argyria in these workers is not known. Historically, [[colloid]]al silver, a [[liquid]] [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of [[microscopic]] silver particles,<!--A [[colloid]] is technically defined as particles which remain suspended without forming an [[Ionic liquid|ionic]], or dissolved solution.--> was also used as an internal medication to treat a variety of diseases. In the 1940s they were discontinued due to both the development of safe and effective modern antibiotics and concern about argyria and other side effects of silver products.<ref name="Fung/Wadhera2005">Fung / Wadhera 2005</ref><ref name="FungBowen1996"/>

==Colloidal silver==
===Alternative medicine===
{{See also|Medical uses of silver}}
Since the 1990s, "colloidal silver" has been marketed as an alternative medicine product, with unsubstantiated, and illegal in some jurisdictions, claims of effectiveness. Medical authorities advise against the use of such colloidal silver preparations, as does the published [[medical literature]], because of their lack of proven effectiveness and the risk of side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Over-the-counter drug products containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Public Health Service (PHS), Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Colloidal silver preparations primarily deliver inactive metallic silver, rather than the active microbicidal silver ion.<ref name="blue">{{cite journal |author=Okan D, Woo K, Sibbald RG |title=So what if you are blue?

===Cases===
A prominent case was that of [[Stan Jones (politician)|Stan Jones]] of [[Montana]], a [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]] in 2002 and 2006. Jones acquired argyria through consumption of a home-made silver product that he made due to fears that the [[Year 2000 problem]] would make [[antibiotic]]s unavailable.<ref name="StanJonesLetter">[http://www.csfacts.com/pages/jones.html Stan Jones letter]</ref> The peculiar colouration of his skin was featured prominently in media coverage of his unsuccessful campaign, though Jones contends that the best-known photo was "doctored".<ref name="StanJonesLetter"/> Jones promised that he was not using his silvery complexion as a gimmick. He continues to promote the use of [[colloidal silver]] as a [[home remedy]].<ref name="StanJonesLetter"/> He has said that his good health, excepting the unusual skin tone, is the result of his use of colloidal silver.<ref name="StanJonesLetter"/>

On December 20, 2007 the world press published stories about Paul Karason, a [[California]]n man whose entire skin gradually turned blue after consuming [[colloidal silver]] made by himself with distilled water, salt and silver, and using a silver salve on his face in an attempt to treat problems with his sinus, dermatitis, acid reflux, and other issues. <ref>[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22958469-5012895,00.html Meet the man with blue skin - Paul Karason | The Daily Telegraph]</ref><ref name="KarasonABC">[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MedicalMysteries/story?id=5489997&page=1#.T0axNPEge_c Feeling Blue Over Skin Color | ABC News]</ref>

===As a cause of argyria===
A 2012 study of silver nanoparticles has indicated that large, regular consumption of colloidal silver particles is a likely causative agent of argyria. The study links such consumption with the creation of the characteristic blue silver sulfide and silver selenide deposits present in reported cases of argyria. This is due to the rapid dissolution of silver nanoparticles in acidic environments, such as the stomach by oxidative dissolution and previous studies have shown that after the dissolution of silver, it can enter cellular environments through complexated proteins. Subsequently, exposure to UV radiation is able to reconvert silver ions to elemental silver spontaneously reforming silver nanoparticles which can be sulfidated to produce the silver sulfide seen in argyria cases. <ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/nn303449n Chemical Transformations of Nanosilver in Biological Environments | ACS Nano]</ref>
