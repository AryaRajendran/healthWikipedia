A '''cardiac fibroma''' is a rare [[benign tumor]] of the [[heart]] that occurs primarily in children. It is most commonly located in the [[interventricular septum]] or left [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] wall. [[Symptom]]s depend on the size of the tumor, its location relative to the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|conduction system]], and whether it obstructs [[blood flow]]. [[Symptomatic]] cardiac fibromas may be treated by [[surgical]] [[segmental resection|resection]].<ref>[http://jtcs.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/108/5/862 Allen P.
