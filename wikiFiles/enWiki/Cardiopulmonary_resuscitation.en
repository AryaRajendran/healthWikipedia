'''Cardiopulmonary resuscitation''' ('''CPR''') is an emergency procedure, performed in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person in [[cardiac arrest]]. It is [[indication (medicine)|indicated]] in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing, for example, [[agonal respiration]]s.

CPR involves chest compressions at least 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) deep and at a rate of at least <!-- STOP! Read following note before editing -->100 per minute<!-- Note that if you're looking to change this number, you will need to prove with citations that international guidance has changed.  This is based (as is the entire article) on guidance from the international body ILCOR.  Some local differences exist, but this is the international standard. --> in an effort to create artificial circulation by manually pumping blood through the heart. In addition, the rescuer may provide breaths by either exhaling into the subject's mouth or nose or utilizing a device that pushes air into the subject's lungs. This process of externally providing ventilation is termed [[artificial respiration]]. Current recommendations place emphasis on high-quality chest compressions over artificial respiration; a simplified CPR method involving chest compressions only is recommended for untrained rescuers.

CPR alone is unlikely to restart the heart; its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the [[Human brain|brain]] and [[Human heart|heart]]. The objective is to delay [[necrosis|tissue death]] and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent [[brain damage]]. Administration of an electric shock to the subject's heart, termed [[defibrillation]], is usually needed in order to restore a viable or "perfusing" heart rhythm.  Defibrillation is only effective for certain heart rhythms, namely [[ventricular fibrillation]] or [[pulseless ventricular tachycardia]], rather than [[asystole]] or [[pulseless electrical activity]]. CPR may succeed in inducing a heart rhythm which may be shockable. CPR is generally continued until the patient has a [[return of spontaneous circulation]] (ROSC) or is declared [[death|dead]].

==Medical uses==
CPR is indicated for any person who is [unresponsive] with no breathing, or who is only breathing in occasional [[agonal breathing|agonal]] gasps, as it is most likely that they are in [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=CircEx10/>{{rp|S643}} If a person still has a [[pulse]], but is not breathing ([[respiratory arrest]]), [[artificial respiration]]s may be more appropriate, but due to the difficulty people have in accurately assessing the presence or absence of a pulse, CPR guidelines recommend that lay persons should not be instructed to check the pulse, while giving health care professionals the option to check a pulse.<ref>(), "{{cite web |author=European Resuscitation Council |title=Part 2: Adult basic life support |year=2005 |work=Guidelines for resuscitation  |url=https://www.erc.edu/index.php/guidelines_download_2005/en/ |quote=The following is a summary of the evidence-based recommendations for the performance of basic life support: Rescuers begin CPR if the victim is unconscious, not moving, and not breathing (ignoring occasional gasps).[...]}}</ref> In those with cardiac arrest due to [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] CPR is considered futile in the pulseless case, but still recommended for correctible causes of arrest.<ref name=AHAPart12>{{cite journal|last=Vanden Hoek|first=TL|coauthors=Morrison, LJ, Shuster, M, Donnino, M, Sinz, E, Lavonas, EJ, Jeejeebhoy, FM, Gabrielli, A|title=Part 12: cardiac arrest in special situations: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|date=2010-11-02|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S829-61|pmid=20956228|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971069}}</ref>

Used alone, CPR will result in few complete recoveries, and those who do survive often develop serious complications. Estimates vary, but many organizations stress that CPR does not "bring anyone back," it simply preserves the body for [[defibrillation]] and [[advanced life support]].<ref name=AHA6/> However, in the case of "non-shockable" rhythms such as [[Pulseless electrical activity|Pulseless Electrical Activity]] (PEA), defibrillation is not indicated, and the importance of CPR rises. On average, only 5–10% of people who receive CPR survive.<ref>{{cite web|last=WebMD Medical News|url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/32/1728_79637.htm|title=Real CPR isn't everything it seems to be|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> The purpose of CPR is not to "start" the heart, but rather to circulate oxygenated blood, and keep the brain alive until advanced care (especially defibrillation) can be initiated. As many of these patients may have a pulse that is impalpable by the layperson rescuer, the current consensus is to perform CPR on a patient who is not breathing.

Studies have shown that immediate CPR followed by defibrillation within 3–5 minutes of sudden VF cardiac arrest improves survival. In cities such as Seattle where CPR training is widespread and defibrillation by EMS personnel follows quickly, the survival rate is about 30 percent. In cities such as New York, without those advantages, the survival rate is only 1–2 percent.<ref name=AHA7>[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4483 Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Statistics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In most cases, there is a higher proportion of patients who achieve a Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC), where their heart starts to beat on its own again, than ultimately survive to be discharged from hospital (see table above). This is due to medical staff either being ultimately unable to address the cause of the arrhythmia or cardiac arrest, or in some instances due to other co-morbidities, due to the patient being gravely ill in more than one way.

Compression-only CPR is less effective in children than in adults, as cardiac arrest in children is more likely to have a [[Cardiac arrest#Non-cardiac|non-cardiac cause]]. In a 2010 prospective study of cardiac arrest in children (age 1–17), for arrests with a non-cardiac cause, provision by bystanders of conventional CPR with rescue breathing yielded a favorable neurological outcome at one month more often than did compression-only CPR ([[Odds ratio|OR]] 5.54; 95% [[confidence interval]] 2.52–16.99). For arrests with a cardiac cause in this cohort, there was no difference between the two techniques (OR 1.20; 95% confidence interval 0.55–2.66).<ref name="Kitamura2010">{{cite pmid|20202679}}</ref> This is consistent with American Heart Association guidelines for parents.<ref name="AHA_kids">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=20 |title=Checklist for Parents of Children with Arrhythmias |accessdate=2010-04-11 |date=2009-01-16 |publisher=[[American Heart Association]] }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
CPR is used on people in cardiac arrest in order to [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenate]] the blood and maintain a [[cardiac output]] to keep vital organs alive. Blood circulation and oxygenation are required to transport [[oxygen]] to the tissues. The [[Human brain|brain]] may sustain [[brain damage|damage]] after blood flow has been stopped for about four minutes and irreversible damage after about seven minutes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Nathalie, MSN, RN|title=Anoxic Brain Damage|publisher=Third Age|url=http://www.thirdage.com/encyclopedia/anoxic-brain-damage-anoxic-brain-injury-hypoxic-brain-injury}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Mount Sinai Medical Centre|title=Anoxic Brain Injury|url=http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/anoxic-brain-damage|last=Tuhrim|first=Stanley}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Brass|first=Lawrence, MD|title=Heart Book.

Because of that CPR is generally only effective if performed within seven minutes of the stoppage of blood flow.<ref>Newsweek 2007-05-07</ref> The heart also rapidly loses the ability to maintain a normal rhythm. Low body temperatures, as sometimes seen in near-drownings, prolong the time the brain survives. Following cardiac arrest, effective CPR enables enough oxygen to reach the brain to delay [[brain death]], and allows the heart to remain responsive to [[defibrillation]] attempts.

==Complications==
Whilst CPR is a last resort intervention, without which a patient without a pulse will certainly die, the physical nature of how CPR is performed does lead to complications that may need to be rectified.  Common complications due to CPR include [[rib fracture]]s, [[sternal fracture]]s, bleeding in the [[anterior mediastinum]], heart contusion,<ref>Myocardial contusion injury: redefining the diagnostic algorithm, M K Bansal, S Maraj,  D Chewaproug, A Amanullah.

The most common injuries sustained from CPR are rib fractures, with literature suggesting an incidence between 13% and 97%, and sternal fractures, with an incidence between 1% to 43%.<ref name=incidence>{{cite journal|title=Skeletal chest injuries secondary to cardiopulmonary resuscitation|last1=Hoke|first1=Robert Sebastian|last2=Chamberlain|first2=Douglas|journal=Resuscitation|volume=63|issue=3|date=December 2004|pages=327–338|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957204002527|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2004.05.019}}</ref>  Whilst these [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] injuries can require further intervention (assuming the patient survives the cardiac arrest), only 0.5% of them are life threatening in their own right.<ref name=chestcomplication/>

The type and frequency of injury can be affected by factors such as gender and age.  For instance, women have a higher risk of sternal fractures than men, and risk for rib fractures increases significantly with age.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Chest injuries after active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resucitation (ACD-CPR) in cadavers|last1=Baubin|first1=M|last2=Rabl|first2=W|last3=Pfieffer|first3=KP|last4=Benzer|first4=A|last5=Gilly|first5=H|journal=Resuscitation|volume=43|issue=1|pages=9–15|date=December 1999|url=http://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572%2899%2900110-0/abstract}}</ref> Children and infants have a low risk of rib fractures during CPR, with an incidence less than 2%, although when they do occur, they are usually [[anterior]] and multiple.<ref name=incidence/><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|title=Does cardiopulmonary resuscitation cause rib fractures in children?

Where CPR is performed in error by a bystander, on a patient who is not in cardiac arrest, only around 2% suffer injury as a result (although 12% experienced discomfort).<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Resuscitation Science|tiutle=Dispatcher-Assisted Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Risks for Patients not in cardiac arrest|last1=White|first1=Lindsay|first2=Joseph|last2=Rogers|first3=Megan|last3=Bloomingdale|last4=Fahrenbruch|first4=Carol|first5=Linda|last5=Culley|first6=Cleo|last6=Subido|first7=Mickey|last7=Eisenberg|first8=Thomas|last8=Rea|year=2010|issue=121|pages=91–97|url=circ.ahajournals.org/content/121/1/91.short}}</ref>

==Adjunct devices==
While several adjunctive devices are available none other than [[defibrillation]] as of 2010 have consistently been found to be better than standard CPR for out of hospital cardiac arrest.<ref name=CircEx10/>{{rp|S644}} These devices can be split in to three broad groups - timing devices, those that assist the rescuer to achieve the correct technique, especially depth and speed of compressions, and those which take over the process completely.

===Timing devices===
They can feature a [[metronome]] (an item carried by many ambulance crews) in order to assist the rescuer in getting the correct rate.  Some units can also give timing reminders for performing compressions, breathing and changing operators.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Silicon Chip Article|url=http://www.siliconchip.com.au/cms/A_108147/article.html}}</ref>

As well as use during actual CPR on a cardiac arrest victim, which relies on the rescuer carrying the device with them, these devices can also be used as part of training programs to improve basic skills in performing correct chest compressions.<ref>[http://www.pocketcpr.com/pdf/prs_rls_10_20_08.pdf Public Health Initiative Uses PocketCPR to Help Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival Rates], October 20, 2008.</ref>

===Automatic devices===
There are also some automated devices available which take over the chest compressions for the rescuer. These have several advantages: they allow rescuers to focus on performing other interventions; they do not fatigue and begin to perform less effective compressions, as humans do; and they are able to perform effective compressions in limited-space environments such as [[air ambulance]]s, where manual compressions are difficult. These devices use either pneumatic (high-pressure gas) or electrical power sources to drive a compressing pad on to the chest of the patient. One such device, known as the LUCAS, was developed at the University Hospital of Lund, is powered by the compressed oxygen supplies already standard in ambulances and hospitals, and has undergone numerous clinical trials, showing a marked improvement in coronary perfusion pressure<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Resuscitation|last=Steen et al.|title=Evaluation of LUCAS, a new device for automated mechanical compression and active decompression|year=2002|volume=55|doi=10.1016/S0300-9572(02)00271-X|pages=285–99|pmid=12458066|first1=S|last2=Liao|first2=Q|last3=Pierre|first3=L|last4=Paskevicius|first4=A|last5=Sjöberg|first5=T|issue=3}}</ref> and return of spontaneous circulation.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Resuscitation|volume=69|last=Rubertsson et al.|title=Increased restoration of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest with the LUCAS device compared to manual chest compressions|year=2006}}</ref>

Artificial ventilation can be done with multiple devices: bag mask gives way valve ball with oxygen-enriched air (which is in the bag) through a facial mask filing (but not external tubes, does not open the airway ). This uses an oropharyngeal airway, called Bergman, tube May or Guedel airway (these do not prevent mouth to mouth contact if there were no masks or masks with air balloons) or Maselli: oropharyngeal Maselli respirator (avoiding contagion in both directions) and is necessary to facilitate air pass to place the tongue in place and prevent it from falling back and relax in by the unconscious, as well as whether the person has a voluminous language, such as in cases of Quincke. It also has a nozzle for the rescuer with a protective mask mode, which prevents any mouth to mouth contact. Another system called the [[AutoPulse]] is electrically powered and uses a large band around the patients chest which contracts in rhythm in order to deliver chest compressions. This is also backed by clinical studies showing increased successful return of spontaneous circulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Casner|first=M|coauthors=Anderson, D; Isaacs, SM|title=The impact of a new CPR assist device on the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|journal=Prehospital Emergency Care|volume=9|issue=1|date=January–March 2005|pmid=16036830|pages=61–7|doi=10.1080/10903120590891714}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=295|issue=22|last=Hallstrom|first=Al|coauthors=Rea, Thomas; Sayre, Michael; Christenson, James; Anton, Andy; Mosesso, Vince; Ottingham, Lois; Olsufka, Michele; Pennington, Sarah; White, Lynn; Yahn, Stephen; Husar, James; Morris, Mary; Cob, Leonard|format=PDF|title=Manual chest compression vs use of an automated chest compression device during resuscitation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/jama;295/22/2620.pdf?ijkey=V96Oxk0wfyGibgF&keytype=finite}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
===Chance of receiving CPR===
Various studies suggest that in out-of-home cardiac arrest, bystanders, lay persons or family members attempt CPR in between 14%<ref name=swor>{{cite journal|last=Swor|first=RA|coauthors=Jackson RE; Cynar M; Sadler E; Basse W; Boji B; Rivera-Rivera EJ; Maher A; Grubb W; Jacobson R et al.|title=Bystander CPR, ventricular fibrillation and survival in witnessed, unmonitored out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|month=June | year=1995|volume=25|issue=6|pmid=7755200|pages=780–4|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(95)70207-5|last2=Jackson|first2=RE|last3=Cynar|first3=M|last4=Sadler|first4=E|last5=Basse|first5=E|last6=Boji|first6=B|last7=Rivera-Rivera|first7=EJ|last8=Maher|first8=A|last9=Grubb|first9=W}}</ref> and 45%<ref name=wik>{{cite journal|last=Wik|first=L|coauthors=Steen PA; Bircher NH|title=Quality of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation influence outcome after prehospital cardiac arrest|journal=Resuscitation|month=December | year=1994|volume=28|issue=4|pages=195–203|pmid=7740189|doi=10.1016/0300-9572(94)90064-7}}</ref> of the time, with a median of 32%.<ref name=physorg>{{cite web

There is also a correlation between the cause of arrest and the likelihood of bystander CPR being initiated. Lay persons are most likely to give CPR to younger cardiac arrest victims in a public place when it has a medical cause; victims in arrest from trauma, [[exsanguination]] or intoxication are less likely to receive CPR.<ref name=bossaert/>

Finally, it has been claimed that there is a higher chance of CPR being performed if the bystander is told to only perform the chest compression element of the resuscitation.<ref name=EMS37-6/>

===Chance of receiving CPR in time===
CPR is only likely to be effective if commenced within 6 minutes after the blood flow stops,<ref name=cummins>{{cite journal|last=Cummins|first=RO|coauthors=Eisenberg MS; Hallstrom AP; Litwin PE|title=Survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with early initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation|journal=American Journal of Emergency Medicine|month=March | year=1985|volume=3|issue=2|pages=114–9|pmid= 3970766|doi=10.1016/0735-6757(85)90032-4}}</ref> because permanent brain cell damage occurs when fresh blood infuses the cells after that time, since the cells of the brain become dormant in as little as 4–6 minutes in an oxygen deprived environment and the cells are unable to survive the reintroduction of oxygen in a traditional resuscitation. Research using [[cardioplegia|cardioplegic]] blood infusion resulted in a 79.4% survival rate with cardiac arrest intervals of 72±43 minutes, traditional methods achieve a 15% survival rate in this scenario, by comparison. New research is currently needed to determine what role CPR, electroshock, and new advanced gradual resuscitation techniques will have with this new knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal

==Society and culture==
===Portrayed effectiveness===
CPR is often severely misrepresented in movies and television as being highly effective in resuscitating a person who is not breathing and has no circulation.
A 1996 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that CPR success rates in television shows was 75% for immediate circulation, and 67% survival to discharge.<ref name=nejmcpr>{{cite journal|title=Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation on Television - Miracles and Misinformation|volume=334|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=1996-06-13|pages=1578–1582|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/334/24/1578|coauthors=Diem, Susan J MD; Lantos, John D MD; Tulsky, James A MD|accessdate=2009-02-01|doi=10.1056/NEJM199606133342406|author=Diem, S.

Kirk}}</ref>

===Stage CPR===
Chest compressions are capable of causing significant local [[blunt trauma]], including [[contusion|bruising]] or [[bone fracture|fracture]] of the [[Human sternum|sternum]] or [[ribs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicago CPR Classes|url=http://savingchicagocpr.com/Chicago/bls-for-healthcare-providers/|work=Chicago CPR Classes}}</ref>  Performing CPR on a healthy person may or may not disrupt normal heart rhythm, but regardless the technique should not be performed on a healthy person because of the risk of trauma.

The portrayal of CPR technique on television and film often is purposely incorrect. Actors simulating the performance of CPR may bend their elbows while appearing to compress, to prevent force from reaching the chest of the actor portraying the victim. Other techniques, such as substituting a mannequin torso for the "victim" in some shots, may also be used to avoid harming actors.

===Self-CPR hoax===
A form of "self-CPR" termed "[[Cough CPR]]" was the subject of a [[hoax]] [[chain e-mail]] entitled "How to Survive a [[myocardial infarction|Heart Attack]] When Alone" which wrongly cited "ViaHealth Rochester General Hospital" as the source of the technique. Rochester General Hospital has denied any connection with the technique.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viahealth.org/body_rochester.cfm?id=329|title=ViaHealth Rochester General Hospital statement on 'Cough CPR' email|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/medical/homecure/coughcpr.asp|title=Snopes Urban Legends Reference - Cough CPR|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

"Cough CPR" cannot be used outside the hospital because the first symptom of cardiac arrest is unconsciousness<ref>{{cite journal |title=Cough CPR |journal=Newsletter |publisher=Australian Resuscitation Council |volume=27 |issue=3 |page=2 |year=2003 |format=PDF |url=http://www.resus.org.au/newsletters/newsletter_nov_2003.pdf}}</ref> in which case coughing is impossible, although myocardial infarction (heart attack) may occur to give rise to the cardiac arrest, so a patient may not be immediately unconscious. Further, the vast majority of people suffering chest pain from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] will not be in cardiac arrest and CPR is not needed. In these cases attempting "cough CPR" will increase the workload on the heart and may be harmful. When coughing is used on trained and monitored patients in hospitals, it has only been shown to be effective for 90 seconds.<ref name="resus.org.au">{{cite journal |title=Cough CPR |journal=Newsletter |publisher=Australian Resuscitation Council |volume=29 |issue=3 |page=2 |year=2005 |format=PDF |url=http://www.resus.org.au/newsletters/newsletter_dec2005.pdf}}</ref>

The [[American Heart Association]] (AHA) and other resuscitation bodies<ref name="resus.org.au"/> do not endorse "Cough CPR", which it terms a misnomer as it is not a form of ''resuscitation''. The AHA does recognize a limited legitimate use of the coughing technique: "This coughing technique to maintain blood flow during brief [[Cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]] has been useful in the hospital, particularly during [[cardiac catheterization]]. In such cases the patients [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] is monitored continuously, and a physician is present."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4535|title=Cough CPR|accessdate=2007-06-13|publisher=American Heart Association}}</ref>

===CPR learned from movies and television===
In at least one case, it has been claimed that CPR allegedly learned from a movie was used to save a person's life. In April 2011, it was claimed that nine-year-old Tristin Saghin saved his sister's life by administering CPR on her after she fell into a swimming pool, using only the knowledge of CPR that he had gleaned from a motion picture, ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]].''<ref name="hawkcpr">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/arizona-year-boy-tristin-saghin-saved-sister-cpr/story?id=13428007|title=Arizona 9-year-old boy, Tristin Saghin, Saved Sister With CPR, Congratulated by Movie Producer Jerry Bruckheimer|accessdate=2011-04-24|publisher=ABC News}}</ref>

===Hands-Only CPR portrayed as more palatable version===
Less than 1/3 of those people who experience a cardiac arrest at home, work or in a public location have CPR performed on them. Most bystanders are worried that they might do something wrong.<ref>[http://www.handsonlycpr.org/  American Heart Association]</ref>  On October 28, 2009 The American Heart Association and the [[Ad Council]] launched a Hands Only CPR [[public service announcement]] and website as a means to address this issue.<ref>[http://www.newsroom.heart.org/index.php?s=43&item=852 American Heart Association, Ad Council launch Hands-Only CPR campaign]</ref>  In July 2011, new content was added to the website including a digital app that helps a user learn how to perform Hands-Only CPR.<ref>[http://www.multivu.com/mnr/50577-ad-council-hands-only-cpr Americans can learn Hands-Only CPR with a new digital application]</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of cardiopulmonary resuscitation}}
[[File:Insulfation2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Artificial respiration|Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]]]
In the 19th century, Doctor H. R. Silvester described a method (The Silvester Method) of artificial respiration in which the patient is laid on their back, and their arms are raised above their head to aid inhalation and then pressed against their chest to aid exhalation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slade/slide/ShortStory/7b.html|publisher=University College London|title=Silvester's method|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> The procedure is repeated sixteen times per minute. This type of artificial respiration is occasionally seen in films made in the early part of the 20th century.

A second technique, called the Holger Nielsen technique, described in the first edition of the ''[[Boy Scout Handbook]]'' in the United States in 1911, described a form of artificial respiration where the person was laid face down, with their head to the side, resting on the palms of both hands. Upward pressure applied at the patient’s elbows raised the upper body while pressure on their back forced air into the lungs, essentially the Silvester Method with the patient flipped over. This form is seen well into the 1950s (it is used in an episode of ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' during the mid-1950s), and was often used, sometimes for comedic effect, in theatrical cartoons of the time (see ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'s'' "[[The Cat and the Mermouse]]"). This method would continue to be shown, for historical purposes, side-by-side with modern CPR in the ''Boy Scout Handbook'' until its ninth edition in 1979. The technique was later banned from first-aid manuals in the U.K.

Similar techniques were described in early 20th century ju-jutsu and judo books, as being used as far back as early 17th century. A ''New York Times'' correspondent reported those techniques being used successfully in Japan in 1910. In ju-jutsu (and later on, judo), those techniques were called Kappo or Kutasu.<ref>http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0CE4D61E39E333A25757C0A96F9C946196D6CF</ref>

However, it was not until the middle of the 20th century that the wider medical community started to recognize and promote artificial respiration combined with chest compressions as a key part of resuscitation following [[cardiac arrest]]. The combination was first seen in a 1962 training video called "The Pulse of Life" created by [[James Jude]], [[Guy Knickerbocker]] and [[Peter Safar]]. Jude and Knickerbocker, along with [[William Kouwenhoven]] and Joseph S. Redding had recently discovered the method of external chest compressions, whereas Safar had worked with Redding and [[James Elam]] to prove the effectiveness of artificial respiration. It was at Johns Hopkins University where the technique of CPR was originally developed. The first effort at testing the technique was performed on a dog by Redding, Safar and JW Perason. Soon afterward, the technique was used to save the life of a child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsarrhythmias.com/doctor/index.htm|publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine|title=Arrhythmias|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> Their combined findings were presented at annual Maryland Medical Society meeting on September 16, 1960 in Ocean City, and gained rapid and widespread acceptance over the following decade, helped by the video and speaking tour they undertook. [[Peter Safar]] wrote the book ''ABC of Resuscitation'' in 1957. In the U.S., it was first promoted as a technique for the public to learn in the 1970s.<ref>See, e.g., "Award of the Heart", ''TIME'' magazine, November 28, 1973, retrieved on 05-28-2008 from time.com</ref>

[[Artificial respiration]] was combined with chest compressions based on the assumption that active ventilation is necessary to keep circulating blood oxygenated, and the combination was accepted without comparing its effectiveness with chest compressions alone. However, research over the past decade has shown that assumption to be in error, resulting in the [[American Heart Association|AHA]]'s acknowledgment of the effectiveness of chest compressions alone (see ''[[#Compression only|Compression only]]'' in this article).<ref name=Circstatement>{{cite journal|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/117/16/21621 |title=Hands-Only (Compression-Only) Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: A Call to Action for Bystander Response to Adults Who Experience Out-of-Hospital Sudden Cardiac Arrest.|last1=Sayre |first1=Michael |last2=Berg |first2=Robert |last3=Cave |first3=Diana |last4=Page |first4=Richard |last5=Potts |first5=Jerald |last6=White |first6=Roger |journal=[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]] |pages=2162–2167 |year=2008 |PMID=18378619 |month=April |volume=117 |issue=16 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.189380 |accessdate=2008-04-02}} On June 4th 2011 Jeremiah Kliesing "coded" at the Michael DeBakey VA hospital in Houston, Tx. Jeremiah underwent 5 1/2 hours of CPR by 20 doctors and nurses before being stabilized and transferred to St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, where he's the second patient to receive the SYNCARDIA artificial heart. One of the Dr.s who preformed CPR was Dr. Donald Lazarus.

==In other animals==
It is feasible to perform CPR on animals, including cats and dogs. The principles and practices are virtually identical to CPR for humans. One difference is that resuscitation is usually done through the animal's nose, not the mouth. One is cautioned to only perform CPR on unconscious animals to avoid the risk of being bitten.  Persons should first and foremost understand that a conscious animal would not require chest compressions.  Animals, depending on species, have a lower bone density than humans, thus CPR can cause bones to become weakened after it is performed.<ref>{{cite web | title=CPR for Cats & Dogs | url=http://depts.washington.edu/learncpr/cat_dog.html | publisher=University of Washington School of Medicine}}</ref>

Most heart attacks and strokes occur from clogged venus and arterial flow. Emergency medical workers are known to give aspirin to patients that suffer chest pain or headaches prior to transport.
