'''Persistent truncus arteriosus''' (or '''Truncus arteriosus'''), also known as '''Common arterial trunk''', is a rare form of [[congenital heart disease]] that presents at birth. In this condition, the [[embryological]] structure known as the [[truncus arteriosus (embryology)|truncus arteriosus]] fails to properly divide into the [[pulmonary trunk]] and [[aorta]].

==Classification==
The most well-known classification was the fourfold system developed by Collett and Edwards in 1949.<ref>Collett RW, Edwards JE: Persistent truncus arteriosus: a classification according to anatomic types. Surg Clin North Am 1949; 29: 1245-70.</ref> Collett/Edwards Types I, II, and III are distinguished by the branching pattern of the pulmonary arteries:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch287/ch287k.html |title=Persistent Truncus Arteriosus: Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies: Merck Manual Professional |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=}}</ref><ref name="McElhinney">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2316.htm |title=eMedicine - Truncus Arteriosus : Article by Doff McElhinney, MD |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=}}</ref>

* Type I: truncus -> one pulmonary artery -> two lateral pulmonary arteries
* Type II: truncus -> two posterior/posterolateral pulmonary arteries
* Type III: truncus -> two lateral pulmonary arteries

The "Type IV" proposed in 1949 is no longer considered a form of PTA by most modern sources.<ref name="McElhinney"/>

Another well-known classification was defined by Van Praaghs in 1965.<ref name="McElhinney"/><ref name="pmid5828135">{{cite journal |author=Van Praagh R, Van Praagh S |title=The anatomy of common aorticopulmonary trunk (truncus arteriosus communis) and its embryologic implications.

==Causes==
Most of the time, this defect occurs spontaneously. [[Genetic disorders]], and [[teratogen]]s (viruses, metabolic imbalance, and industrial or pharmacological agents) have been associated as possible causes.  Up to 50% (varies in studies) of cases are associated with [[chromosome 22]]q11 deletions ([[DiGeorge Syndrome]]). The [[neural crest]], specifically a population known as the cardiac neural crest, directly contributes to the [[aorticopulmonary septum]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kirby ML, Gale TF, and Stewart DE.  | title = Neural crest cells contribute to normal aorticopulmonary septation. | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue =4061 | pages = 1059–61 | year =1983 | pmid = 6844926  | doi = 10.1126/science.6844926}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Jiang X, Rowitch DH, Soriano P, McMahon AP, Sucov HM..| title = Fate of the mammalian cardiac neural crest...| volume = 127| issue =8| pages = 1607–16 | year =2000 | pmid = 10725237 | journal = Development (Cambridge, England)}}</ref> 

Microablation of the cardiac neural crest in developing chick embryos and genetic anomalies affecting this population of cells in rodents results in persistent truncus arteriosus.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hutson MR, Kirby ML..  | title = Neural crest and cardiovascular development: a 20-year perspective. | journal = Birth Defects Res C Embryo Today.  | volume = 69 | issue =1| pages = 2–13 | year =2003 | pmid = 12768653  | doi = 10.1002/bdrc.10002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Waller BR 3rd, McQuinn T, Phelps AL, Markwald RR, Lo CW, Thompson RP, Wessels A.| title = Conotruncal anomalies in the trisomy 16 mouse: an immunohistochemical analysis with emphasis on the involvement of the neural crest. | journal = Anat.

Numerous perturbations affecting the cardiac neural crest have been associated with persistent truncus arteriosus, some of which include [[growth factor]]s ([[fibroblast growth factor 8]] and [[bone morphogenetic protein]]), [[transcription factor]]s ([[T-box]], [[Pax genes|Pax]], [[Nkx2-5]], [[GATA-6]], and [[Forkhead]]), and [[gap junction]] proteins ([[Connexin]]). The cardiac neural crest also contributes the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[great arteries]].

==Anatomical changes ==
[[Image:TruncusArteriosus.svg|thumb|right|190px|]]
Anatomical changes associated with this disorder includes:
* single artery arising from the two [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] which gives rise to both the aortic and pulmonary vessels
* abnormal [[truncal valve]]
* right sided [[aortic arch]] in about 30% of cases (not shown)
* large [[ventricular septal defect]]
* [[pulmonary hypertension]]
* complete mixing occurring at level of the [[great vessel]]
* right-to-left shunting of blood

==Clinical manifestations==
* [[Cyanosis]] presents at birth
* [[Heart failure]] may occur within weeks
* [[Systole (medicine)|Systolic]] ejection [[murmur]] is heard at the left sternal border
* Widened [[pulse pressure]]
* Bounding arterial pulses
* Loud second [[heart sound]]
* Biventricular hypertrophy
* [[Cardiomegaly]]
* Increased pulmonary vascularity
* [[Hypocalcemia]] (if associated with [[DiGeorge syndrome]])

==Treatment==
Treatment is with neonatal surgical repair.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rodefeld M, Hanley F | title = Neonatal truncus arteriosus repair: surgical techniques and clinical management. | journal = Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg Pediatr Card Surg Annu | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 212–7 | year = 2002| pmid = 11994881 | doi = 10.1053/pcsu.2002.31497}}</ref> The ventricular septal defect is closed with a patch. The pulmonary arteries are then detached from the common artery (truncus arteriosus) and connected to the right ventricle using a tube (a conduit or tunnel).
There have been cases where the condition has been diagnosed at birth and surgical intervention is an option. A number of these cases have survived well into adulthood.
