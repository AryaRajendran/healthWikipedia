'''Lawson Health Research Institute''' is large hospital based research institutes located in [[London, Canada]]. Lawson is the research institute of [[London Health Sciences Centre]] and [[St. Joseph's Health Care, London]] and works in partnership with [[The University of Western Ontario]].

In 2008, there were over 1,200 scientists, technicians and support staff working for the Lawson Health Research Institute. They received more than $60-million CDN in peer reviewed and industry sponsored contract research funding.
==History==
===Research at St. Joseph's Health Care, London===
The Sisters of St. Joseph's established the original Research Institute of St. Joseph's Health Care, London in 1983. Similar to today, the hospital had a threeâ€“dimensional focus of patient care, teaching and research. However, it became more difficult to do research as there was no dedicated space. It was the foresight of Sister Mary Doyle, the Executive Director of the hospital at that time to create the research institute and construct a building. In 1987, it became the Lawson Research Institute, named in honour of London businessman and philanthropist, Colonel Tom Lawson and his wife, Miggsie Lawson.

===Research at London Health Sciences Centre===
In 1983, at Victoria Hospital, which is now [[South Street Hospital]], the Victoria Upjohn Clinical Research Unit opened. The function of this facility was to conduct Phase I-III Upjohn clinical trials using the expertise of hospital researchers. In 1990, the joint venture was terminated with Upjohn and Victoria Hospital took over the operation of the facility, naming it the Victoria Clinical Trials Centre. In 1997, the research facility became a fully incorporated research institute and was called the London Health Sciences Centre Research Inc. At this time, the research institute's official mandate was to oversee all hospital based research within the three sites of London Health Sciences Centre: Victoria Hospital, University Hospital and South Street Hospital.

===Lawson Health Research Institute===
In July 2000, the Lawson Research Institute joined venture with London Health Sciences Centre Research Inc. and the Children's Health Research Institute to become what is known today as the Lawson Health Research Institute (Lawson).

As hospital roles have changed due to provincial health care restructuring, this new alliance allows considerable functional interaction. It enables research and researchers to move seamlessly between hospital locations and various departments of The University of Western Ontario, thus retaining and developing the equipment and infrastructure that are crucial to maintaining innovation.
