Visceral and central abdominal fat and waist circumference show a strong association with [[type 2 diabetes]].<ref>http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/12/2948.full</ref>

[[Visceral fat]], also known as organ fat or ''intra-abdominal fat'', is located inside the [[peritoneal cavity]], packed in between internal organs and torso, as opposed to [[subcutaneous fat]]‚ which is found underneath the [[skin]], and [[intramuscular fat]]‚ which is found interspersed in [[skeletal muscle]]. Visceral fat is composed of several [[adipose depot]]s including [[mesenteric]], [[epididymis|epididymal]] white [[adipose tissue]] (EWAT) and [[perirenal fat]]. An excess of [[Adipose tissue#visceral fat|visceral fat]] is known as central obesity, the "pot belly" or "beer belly" effect, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. This body type is also known as "apple shaped‚" as opposed to "pear shaped‚" in which fat is deposited on the hips and buttocks. Scientists have come to recognize that body fat, instead of body weight, is the key to evaluating obesity{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}.

Researchers first started to focus on abdominal obesity in the 1980s when they realized that it had an important connection to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and [[dyslipidemia]]. Abdominal obesity was more closely related with metabolic distractions connected with cardiovascular disease than was general obesity. In the late 1980s and early 1990s insightful and powerful imaging techniques were discovered that would further help advance our understanding of the health risks associated with body fat accumulation. Techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to dissect mass of adipose tissue located at the abdominal level into intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poehlman|first=Eric T.|title=Abdominal obesity: the metabolic multi-risk factor|year=1998|volume=9|number=8|pages=469–471}}</ref>

== Causes ==
[[File:Overweight teenage male.jpg|thumb|Excess abdominal fat on a teenage male.]]
The immediate cause of obesity is net energy imbalance—the organism consumes more usable calories than it expends, wastes‚ or discards through elimination. The fundamental cause of obesity is unknown, but is presumably a combination of the organism's [[genetics|genes]] and [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Some studies indicate that visceral adiposity, together with lipid dysregulation and [[Insulin resistance|decreased insulin sensitivity]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanhope|first=Kimber L.|coauthors=Peter J.

Visceral fat cells will release their metabolic by-products in the portal circulation, where the blood leads straight to the liver. Thus, the excess of triglycerides and fatty acids created by the visceral fat cells will go into the liver and accumulate there. In the liver, most of it will be stored as fat. This concept is known as ''''lipotoxicity''''.<ref>President and fellows of Harvard College. (2006). Abnormal obesity and your health. Retrieved from http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/abdominal-obesity-and-your-health.shtml</ref>

Hypercortisolism, such as in [[Cushing's syndrome]], also leads to central obesity. Many prescription drugs, such as dexamethasone and other steroids, can also have side effects resulting in central obesity,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bujalska|first=Iwona|coauthors=et al|title=Does central obesity reflect "Cushing's disease of the omentum"?|journal=The Lancet|date=26|year=1997|month=April|volume= 349|issue=9060,|pages=1210–1213|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)11222-8|pmid=9130942}}</ref> especially in the presence of elevated insulin levels.

The prevalence of abdominal obesity is increasing in western populations, due to a combination of low physical activity and high-energy diets, and also in developing countries, where it is associated with the urbanization of populations.<ref>Després, J.

Waist measurement is more prone to errors than measuring height and weight. It is recommended to use both standards. BMI will illustrate the best estimate of your total body fatness, while waist measurement gives an estimate of visceral fat and risk of obesity-related disease.<ref>Abdominal obesity and your health. (2006). Retrieved from http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/abdominal-obesity-and-your-health.shtml</ref>

==Diagnosis==
While central obesity can be obvious just by looking at the naked body (see the picture), the severity of central obesity is determined by taking waist and hip measurements. The absolute waist circumference (>{{convert|102|cm|in}} in men and >{{convert|88|cm|in}} in women) and the [[waist-hip ratio]] (>0.9 for men and >0.85 for women)<ref name=Yusuf2004/> are both used as measures of central obesity. A [[differential diagnosis]] includes distinguishing central obesity from [[ascites]] and intestinal [[bloating]]. In the [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] of 15,000 people participating in the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES III), waist circumference explained obesity-related health risk better than the [[body mass index]] (or BMI) when [[metabolic syndrome]] was taken as an [[Clinical endpoint|outcome measure]] and this difference was statistically significant. In other words, excessive waist circumference appears to be more of a risk factor for metabolic syndrome than [[body mass index|BMI]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=379–84 |doi=10.1185/030079906X159489 |title=Abdominal obesity, waist circumference and cardiometabolic risk: awareness among primary care physicians, the general population and patients at risk – the Shape of the Nations survey |year=2007 |last1=Smith |first1=Sidney C. |last2=Haslam |first2=David |journal=Current Medical Research and Opinion |volume=23 | pmid=17261236 }}</ref>  Another measure of central obesity which has shown superiority to BMI in predicting cardiovascular disease risk is the [[Index of Central Obesity]] (waist-to-height ratio - WHtR), where a ratio of >=0.5 (i.e. a waist circumference at least half of the individual's height) is predictive of increased risk.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4061/2011/931402 |title=Waist Circumference, Body Mass Index, and Other Measures of Adiposity in Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors among Peruvian Adults |year=2011 |last1=Knowles |first1=K.

D. |last8=Gelaye |first8=B. |last9=Williams |first9=M. A. |journal=International Journal of Hypertension |volume=2011 |pages=1–10}}</ref>
Another diagnosis of obesity is the analysis of [[intra abdominal fat]] having the most risk to one's personal health. The increased amount of fat in this region relates to the higher levels of [[plasma lipid]] and [[lipoproteins]] as per studies mentioned by Dr. Eric D. Poehlman(1998) review.<ref name>{{cite journal |first1=Eric |last1=Poehlman|year=1998|title=Abdominal obesity: the metabolic multi risk factor |journal=Journal of Coronary Heart Disease|volume=9 |pages=469–471;|url=http://simplelink.library.utoronto.ca/url.cfm/262554}}</ref>
An increasing acceptance of the importance of central obesity within the medical profession as an indicator of health risk has led to new developments in obesity diagnosis such as the [[Body Volume Index]], which measures central obesity by measuring a person's body shape and their weight distribution. The effect of abdominal adiposity does not just occur in those who are obese, but also affects people who are non-obese and it also contributes to insulin sensitivity

===Body Volume Index===
[[Body Volume Index|BVI]] is not based upon the principle that excess abdominal weight, measured by part volume as a percentage of total volume, constitutes a greater health risk. Recent validation has concluded that total and regional body volume estimates correlate positively and significantly with biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and [[Body Volume Index|BVI]] calculations correlate significantly with all biomarkers of cardio-vascular risk.<ref>Romero-Corral, A.

Central obesity can be a feature of [[lipodystrophy|lipodystrophies]], a group of diseases that is either [[genetic disorder|inherited]], or due to secondary causes (often [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s, a group of [[medication]]s against [[AIDS]]). Central obesity is a symptom of [[Cushing's syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bujalska IJ, Kumar S, Stewart PM |title=Does central obesity reflect "Cushing's disease of the omentum"? |journal=Lancet |volume=349 |issue=9060 |pages=1210–3 |year=1997 |pmid=9130942 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)11222-8}}</ref> and is also common in patients with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS). Central obesity is associated with [[glucose intolerance]] and [[dyslipidemia]]. Once dyslipidemia becomes a severe problem. An individual's abdominal cavity would generate elevated free fatty acid flux to the liver. The effect of abdominal adiposity does not just occur in those who are obese but also affects people who are non-obese and it also contributes to insulin sensitivity.

=== Relationship with Diabetes ===
There are numerous theories as to the exact cause and mechanism in [[Diabetes Mellitus Type 2|Type 2 Diabetes]]. Central obesity is known to predispose individuals for insulin resistance. Abdominal fat is especially active hormonally, secreting a group of hormones called [[adipokine]]s that may possibly [[Impaired glucose tolerance|impair glucose tolerance]].

[[Insulin resistance]] is a major feature of [[Diabetes Mellitus Type 2]] (T2DM), and central obesity is correlated with both insulin resistance and T2DM itself.<ref>Duman BS, Turkoglu C, Gunay D, Cagatay P, Demiroglu C, Buyukdevrim AS.

=== Relationship with Asthma ===

Developing asthma due to abdominal obesity is also a main concern. As a result of breathing at low lung volume, the muscles are tighter and the airway is narrower. It is commonly seen that people who are obese breathe quickly and often, while inhaling small volumes of air.<ref>Shore, S., & Johnston, R. (2006). Obesity and asthma" ''Pharmacology & Therapeutics'' 110(1), 83-102. Retrieved August 6, 2012, from the ScienceDirect database.</ref> People with obesity are also more likely to be hospitalized for asthma. A study has stated that 75% of patients treated for asthma in the emergency room were either overweight or obese.<ref>Thomson, C., Clark, S., & Jr, C. C. (2003).

==Pathophysiology of Visceral Obesity==
There is enough evidence in the scientific community where an impaired non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) metabolism could give way to the insulin-resistant state of individuals with this type of obesity. Hypertrophy of intra-abdominal adipose cells causes it to be in a hyperlipolytic state in which it is resistant to the antilipolytic effect of insulin.  The resulting NEFA  flux to the liver causes impairment of liver metabolism which leads to over production of glucose in the liver.<ref>Després, Jean-Pierre and Lemieux, Isabelle, Nature, ISSN 0028-0836, 12/2006, Volume 444, Issue 7121, pp. 881 - 887</ref> Individuals with obesity are more likely to develop weakened non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), which can weaken the metabolism of the liver causing <ref>{{cite journal|last=Després|first=Jean-Pierre|coauthors=Lemieux|title=Isabelle|journal=Abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome|date=14|year=2006|month=December|volume=444|series=Nature|pages=881–887|url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Abdominal+obesity+and+metabolic+syndrome&rft.jtitle=Nature&rft.au=Despr%C3%A9s%2C+Jean-Pierre&rft.au=Lemieux%2C+Isabelle&rft.date=2006-12-14&rft.pub=NATURE+PUBLISHING+GROUP&rft.issn=0028-0836&rft.volume=444&rft.issue=7121&rft.spage=881&rft.epage=887&rft_id=info:doi/10.1038%2Fnature05488&rft.externalDBID=GNAA&rft.externalDocID=10_1038_nature05488|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> high glucose production.

=== Relationship with Alzheimer's Disease ===
Based on studies, it is evident that obesity has a strong association with vascular and metabolic disease which could potentially be linked to Alzheimer's Disease. Recent studies have also shown an association between mid-life obesity and dementia, however the relationship between later life obesity and dementia is less clear.<ref>Razay , G., Vreugdenhil, A., and Wilcock, G.

Alzheimer's Disease and abdominal obesity has a strong correlation and with metabolic factors added in, the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease was even higher. Based on logistic regression analyses, it was found that obesity was associated with an almost 10-fold increase risk of Alzheimer's Disease.<ref>Razay, George.

=== Relationship with Pulmonary Function ===

One study found a relationship between abdominal obesity and lung function. It has been shown with increasing waist circumference, there is a strong correlation with spirometry or breathing results. Also, abdominal obesity affects pulmonary function more in men than in women.<ref>Pekkarinen, E., Vanninen, E., Lansimies, E., et.al. Relation between body composition, abdominal obesity, and lung function. (2012). Clin Physiol Funct Imagining. 32: 83-88.</ref>

=== Relationship with Alcohol Consumption ===
A study has shown that alcohol consumption is directly associated with waist circumference and with a higher risk of abdominal obesity in men, but not in women, in the present population. Excluding energy under-reporters slightly attenuated these associations. After controlling for energy under-reporting, it was observed that increasing alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of exceeding recommended energy intakes in male participants – but not in the small number of female participants (2.13%) with elevated alcohol consumption, even after establishing a lower number of drinks per day to characterize women as consuming a high quantity of alcohol. Further study is needed to determine whether a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and abdominal obesity exists among women who consume higher amounts of alcohol.<ref>H.

==Measurement==
[[File:Obesity-waist circumference.svg|thumb|190px|Silhouettes and waist circumferences representing normal, overweight, and obese]]
There are various ways of measuring abdominal obesity including:
*Absolute waist circumference (>102&nbsp;cm in men and >88&nbsp;cm in women)<ref name="ATP3pii17" />
*[[Waist–hip ratio]] (the circumference of the waist divided by that of the hips  of >0.9 for men and >0.85 for women)<ref name=Yusuf2004/>

Men are considered to be at high risk from abdominal obesity if their waist measurements are 40&nbsp;inches (102&nbsp;cm) or higher. On the other hand, women are considered to be at high risk if their waist measurements are 35&nbsp;inches (89&nbsp;cm) or higher. BMI and waist measurements are well recognized ways to characterize obesity. However, waist measurements are not as accurate as BMI measurements. For this reason, it is recommended to use both methods of measurements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/abdominal-obesity-and-your-health.shtml |title=Abdominal obesity and your health |publisher=Health.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref>

=== Sex differences ===

50% of men and 70% of women in the [[United States]] between the ages of 50 and 79 years now exceed the waist circumference threshold for abdominal obesity.

When comparing the body fat of men and women it is seen that men have close to twice the visceral fat as that of pre-menopausal women.

Abdominal obesity is positively associated with [[coronary heart disease]] risk in women and men.

There are sex-dependent differences in regional fat distribution. [[Estrogen|Female sex hormones]] are believed to cause fat to be stored in the [[buttocks]], [[thighs]], and [[hips]] in women.<ref>Andersen, Barbara L., and Joseph LeGrand.

Abdominal obesity in males is correlated with comparatively low [[testosterone levels]] for men.<ref>[Seidell J. C.,Björntorp P.,Sjöstrom L.,Kvist H.,Sannerstedt R.

===Economic Costs of Abdominal Obesity===
Højgaard et al. of Danish Institute for Health Services Research at Copenhagen examined the relationship between waist circumferences and costs among 31,840 subjects aged 50–64 years of age with different waist circumferences. Their study showed that an increase in just an additional centimetre above normal waistline caused a 1.25% and 2.08% rise in health care costs in women and men respectively. To put this in perspective, a woman with a waistline of 95&nbsp;cm. and without underlying health problems or co-morbidities can incur economic costs that are 22%, of 397 USD, higher per year than a woman with a normal waist circumference.<ref>''Economic costs of abdominal obesity''; Højgaard, Betina and Olsen, Kim Rose and Søgaard, Jes and Sørensen, Thorkild I A and Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte; Obesity facts, ISSN 1662-4025, 2008, Volume 1, Issue 3, pp. 146 - 154</ref>

A 2006 study published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arciero|first1=PJ|last2=Gentile|first2=CL|title=Increased dietary protein and combined high intensity aerobic and resistance exercise improves body fat distribution and cardiovascular risk factors.|journal=International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism|date=August 16, 2006}}</ref> suggests that combining cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise with resistance training is more effective than cardiovascular training alone in getting rid of abdominal fat. An additional benefit to exercising is that it reduces stress and insulin levels, which reduces the presence of cortisol, a hormone that leads to more belly fat deposits.

Self motivation by understanding the risks associated with abdominal obesity is widely regarded as being far more important than worries about cosmetics. In addition, understanding the health issues linked with abdominal obesity can help in the self motivation process of losing the abdominal fat. As mentioned above, abdominal fat is linked with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Specifically it's the deepest layer of belly fat (the fat you can't see or grab) that poses health risks, as these "visceral" fat cells produce hormones that can affect health (e.g. increased insulin resistance and/or breast cancer risk). The risk increases considering the fact that they are located in the proximity or in between organs in the abdominal cavity. For example, fat next to the liver drains into it, causing a [[fatty liver]], which is a risk factor for insulin resistance, setting the stage for Type 2 diabetes.

In the presence of [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus type 2]], the physician might instead prescribe [[metformin]] and [[thiazolidinedione]]s ([[rosiglitazone]] or [[pioglitazone]]) as [[antidiabetic drug]]s rather than [[sulfonylurea]] derivatives.  [[Thiazolidinediones]] may cause slight weight gain but decrease [[Abdominal fat|"pathologic" abdominal fat (visceral fat)]], and therefore may be prescribed for diabetics with central obesity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fonseca V |title=Effect of thiazolidinediones on body weight in patients with diabetes mellitus |journal=Am.

Thiazolidinedione has been associated with heart failure and increased cardiovascular risk; so it has been withdrawn from the market in Europe by EMA in 2010.<ref>23/09/2010 European Medicines Agency recommends suspension of Avandia, Avandamet and Avaglim http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2010/09/news_detail_001119.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1</ref>

Low-fat diets may not be an effective long-term intervention for obesity: as Bacon and Aphramor wrote, "The majority of individuals regain virtually all of the weight that was lost during treatment."<ref name="bacon">{{cite journal|last1=Bacon|first1=Linda|last2=Aphramor|first2=Lucy|title=Weight Science: Evaluating the Evidence for a Paradigm Shift|journal=Nutr J.|volume=10|issue=9|doi=10.1186/1475-2891-10-9|date=January 24, 2011|pmid=21261939|pmc=3041737}}</ref> The Women's Health Initiative ("the largest and longest randomized, controlled dietary intervention clinical trial"<ref name="bacon"/>) found that long-term dietary intervention increased the waist circumference of both the intervention group and the control group, though the increase was smaller for the intervention group. The conclusion  was that mean weight decreased significantly in the intervention group from baseline to year 1 by 2.2&nbsp;kg (P<.001) and was 2.2&nbsp;kg less than the control group change from baseline at year 1. This difference from baseline between control and intervention groups diminished over time, but a significant difference in weight was maintained through year 9, the end of the study.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=BV|coauthors=Manson JE, Stefanick ML, Beresford SA, Frank G, Jones B, Rodabough RJ, Snetselaar L, Thomson C, Tinker L. et al.|title=Low-fat dietary pattern and weight change over 7 years: the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial. |journal=JAMA|year=2006|volume=295|pages=39–49|doi=10.1001/jama.295.1.39|pmid=16391215}}</ref>

Abdominal obesity is associated with GH secretion and a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors that characterize the metabolic syndrome. Franco and colleagues, Sahlgrensk University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, had an experiment of GH treatment to forty postmenopausal women with abdominal obesity for 12-month trial. GH treatment reduced visceral fat mass,increase thigh muscle area, and reduced total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between changes in GDR and other organs. The researcher Franco said that "In postmenopausal women with abdominal obesity, 1 year of GH treatment improved insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced hepatic fat content." <ref>{{cite journal|last=Obesity, fitness & wellness week|title=Abdominal obesity; GH treatment|journal=Factiva|year=2005|month=May}}</ref>

=== Myths ===
There is a common misconception that [[spot reduction|spot exercise]] (that is, exercising a specific muscle or location of the body) most effectively burns fat at the desired location, but this is not the case. Spot exercise is beneficial for building specific muscles, but it has little effect, if any, on fat in that area of the body, or on the body's distribution of body fat.  The same logic applies to sit-ups and belly fat. [[Sit-up (exercise)|Sit-ups]], [[Crunch (exercise)|crunches]] and other [[abdominal exercises]] are useful in building the [[abdomen#Muscles of the abdominal wall|abdominal muscles]], but they have little effect, if any, on the [[adipose tissue]] located there.<ref>{{cite web

|quote= Sit-ups will make your abdominal muscles stronger, sure. And, you may look thinner by building your abdominal muscles because you can hold in your belly fat better. But strengthening your stomach muscles alone will not specifically reduce belly fat.

The appearance of a more muscular region may give the impression of reduced fat, when this is not the case.  (The muscle-to-fat ratio would be increased.)

===Colloquialisms===
[[File:Love-Handles.jpg|thumb|Excess abdominal fat on a male.]]

Several colloquial terms used to refer to central obesity, and to people who have it, refer to [[beer]] drinking. However, there is little scientific evidence that beer drinkers are more prone to abdominal obesity, despite its being known colloquially as "beer belly‚" "beer gut‚" or "beer pot". One of the few studies conducted on the subject did not find that beer drinkers are more prone to abdominal obesity than nondrinkers or drinkers of wine or spirits.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601678 | author = Bobak M, Skodova Z, Marmot M | year = 2003 | title = Beer and obesity: a cross-sectional study | url = | journal = Eur J Clin Nutr | volume = 57 | issue = 10| pages = 1250–3 | pmid = 14506485 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Staff writer|title=Why the beer belly may be a myth|date=2003-10-12|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3175488.stm}}</ref> Chronic alcoholism can lead to [[cirrhosis]], symptoms of which include [[gynecomastia]] (enlarged breasts) and [[ascites]] (abdominal fluid).

The skin flap resulting from extreme central obesity is also called "F.U.P.A." which is short for "fat upper pubic area."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FUPA | title = Urban Dictionary: FUPA | publisher = Urban Dictionary | accessdate = 4 October 2012}}</ref> In common speech, the [[abbreviation]] may even be used as a [[Acronym and initialism|word by itself]], as in a picture of a fat woman that shows "the exact shape and size of her fupa."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/?s=snow+storm | title = Snow Storm | publisher = People of Walmart | accessdate = 28 October 2012}}</ref>

Deposits of excess fat at the sides of one's waistline are commonly referred to as "love handles".

== Factors ==
There are many factors that can contribute to someone becoming obese. The commonly known way is that someone has an unhealthy diet and or inactive with an exercise routine. Meaning that they take in more calories than they burn, because their body stores the excess calories as fat, increasing the total body mass. Lack of sleep is not commonly thought of as a factor. Getting less than seven hours of sleep a night can cause changes in hormones that increase your appetite. You may also crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates to give you lost energy, which can contribute to weight gain. 
In women, pregnancy can also be a catalyst in becoming obese. During pregnancy, a woman's weight necessarily increases for development of a baby. Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women. Certain medication that a person takes can have side effects of gaining weight. These medications include some antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, diabetes medications, and steroids. Obesity can sometimes be traced to a medical cause, such as Cushing's syndrome and other diseases and conditions. Some medical problems, such as arthritis, can lead to the decrease in activity, which usually results in weight gain. A low metabolism is unlikely to cause obesity, as is having low thyroid function.<ref>{{cite news|author=Crum, R. et al|title=Is Obesity Associated with Major Depression? Results from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey|date=2003-06-13|work=American Journal of Epidemiology|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/158/12/1139.full.pdf+html}}</ref>

== Stages ==
On the earliest stages of obesity people usually do not feel a lot of discomfort and do not tend to connect their health concerns with their extra weight. On these stages people take their overweight as a cosmetic defect rather psychological and physical discomfort. However, on these stages of obesity it is very important to start making changes in the life-style and eating habits, because the processes of fat accumulation in the body tend to progress and result increased risks of having many lasting health problems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
