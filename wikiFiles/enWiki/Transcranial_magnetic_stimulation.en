'''Transcranial magnetic stimulation''' ('''TMS''') is a noninvasive method to cause [[depolarization]] or [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] in the [[neuron]]s of the [[brain]].  TMS uses [[electromagnetic induction]] to induce weak [[electric current]]s using a rapidly changing [[magnetic field]]; this can cause activity in specific or general parts of the brain with minimal discomfort, allowing the functioning and interconnections of the brain to be studied.  A variant of TMS, '''repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation''' ('''rTMS''') has been tested as a treatment tool for various [[neurological disorder|neurological]] and [[mental disorder|psychiatric]] disorders including [[migraine]]s, [[stroke]]s, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[dystonia]], [[tinnitus]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[auditory hallucination]]s.

==Background==

The principle of inductive brain stimulation with [[eddy current]]s has been noted since the 20th century.  The first successful TMS study was performed in 1985 by Anthony Barker and his colleagues in [[Sheffield]], England.<ref name=Barker>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(85)92413-4}}</ref>  Its earliest application demonstrated conduction of nerve impulses from the [[motor cortex]] to the [[spinal cord]], stimulating muscle contractions in the hand.  As compared to the previous method of transcranial stimulation proposed by Merton and Morton in 1980<ref name=Merton>{{cite doi|10.1038/285227a0}}</ref> in which direct electrical current was applied to the scalp, the use of magnets greatly reduced the discomfort of the procedure, and allowed mapping of the [[cerebral cortex]] and its connections.

==Theory==

From the [[Biot-Savart Law]] 
<center><math> \mathbf B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \int_C \frac{d\mathbf l \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}</math> </center>
it has been shown that a current through a wire generates a magnetic field around that wire. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is achieved by quickly discharging current from a large capacitor into a coil to produce pulsed magnetic fields of 1-10 mT<ref name=Walsh>V. Walsh and A. Pascual-Leone, "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Neurochronometrics of Mind." Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003.</ref>. By directing the magnetic field pulse at a targeted area of the brain, one can either depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons in the brain. The magnetic flux density pulse generated by the current pulse through the coil causes a gradient electric field due to the [[Electromagnetic_induction#Maxwell–Faraday_equation|Maxwell-Faraday equation]] equal to 
<center><math>\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}</math></center>. 
When this electric field passes through a neuron in the brain, the gradient causes a change in the transmembrane current of the neuron, which leads to the depolarization or hyperpolarization of the neuron and the firing of an action potential.<ref name=Walsh/>

==Effects on the brain==

The exact details of how TMS functions are still being explored. The effects of TMS can be divided into two types depending on the mode of stimulation:

*Single or paired pulse TMS causes neurons in the neocortex under the site of stimulation to [[Depolarization|depolarize]] and discharge an [[action potential]]. If used in the [[primary motor cortex]], it produces muscle activity referred to as a [[Evoked potential#Motor evoked potentials|motor evoked potential]] (MEP) which can be recorded on [[electromyography]]. If used on the [[occipital cortex]], '[[phosphene]]s' (flashes of light) might be perceived by the subject. In most other areas of the cortex, the participant does not consciously experience any effect, but his or her behaviour may be slightly altered (e.g. slower reaction time on a cognitive task), or changes in brain activity may be detected using sensing equipment.<ref name="Handbook of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation">{{cite book | author = [[Alvaro Pascual-Leone|Pascual-Leone A]]; Davey N; Rothwell J; Wassermann EM; Puri BK | year = 2002 | title = Handbook of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation | publisher = [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Arnold]]|location=[[London]] | isbn = 0-340-72009-3  }}</ref>

*Repetitive TMS produces longer-lasting effects which persist past the initial period of stimulation. rTMS can increase or decrease the excitability of the [[corticospinal tract]] depending on the intensity of stimulation, coil orientation, and frequency. The mechanism of these effects is not clear, though it is widely believed to reflect changes in synaptic efficacy akin to [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) and [[long-term depression]] (LTD).<ref name=Fitzgerald>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.clinph.2006.06.712}}</ref>

==Accuracy==

In 1996, a study was done by Wassermann et al. using TMS to stimulate areas in the motor cortex of the brain to move a finger.<ref name=Wassermann1996>{{cite doi|10.1006/nimg.1996.0001}}</ref> The stimulated areas were imaged with an MRI for the reference image. The subjects then were asked to move the same finger in the same way that it was moved by TMS, and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] images were obtained to map the corresponding activity in the brain.<ref name=Wassermann1996/> The TMS-induced MRI images matched very closely with the PET images, within 5-22 mm of accuracy.<ref name=Wassermann1996/>
TMS has also been seen to correlate closely to [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]]<ref name=Morioka>T. Morioka, T. Yamamoto, A. Mizushima, S. Tombimatsu, H. Shigeto, K. Hasuo, S. Nishio, K. Fujii and M. Fukui. Comparison of magnetoencephalography, functional MRI, and motor evoked potentials in the localization of the sensory-motor cortex. Neurol.  Res., vol. 17, no. 5, pp. 361-367. 1995</ref> and also [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]]<ref name=Terao>{{cite doi|10.1007/s002210050446}}</ref>.

==Risks==

Although TMS is often regarded as safe, the greatest [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] risk of TMS is the rare occurrence of induced [[epileptic seizure|seizures]].<ref name = Rossi>{{cite doi| 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016}}</ref>  More than 16 cases of TMS-related seizures have been reported in the literature, with at least seven reported before the publication of safety guidelines in 1998<ref name=Wassermann1998 />, and more than nine reported afterwards.  The seizures have been associated with both single-pulse and rTMS. Reports have stated that in at least some cases, predisposing factors (medication, brain lesions or genetic susceptibility) may have contributed to the seizure.  A review of nine seizures associated with rTMS that had been reported after 1998 stated that four seizures were within the safety parameters, four were outside of those parameters, and one had occurred in a healthy volunteer with no predisposing factors.  A 2009 international consensus statement on TMS that contained this review concluded that based on the number of studies, subjects, and patients involved with TMS research, the risk of seizure with rTMS is considered very low.<ref name = Rossi/>

Besides seizures, other risks include [[syncope (medicine)|syncope (fainting)]], minor pains such as headache or local discomfort, minor cognitive changes, and psychiatric symptoms (particularly a low risk of [[mania]] in depressed patients).<ref name = Rossi/> Though other side effects are thought to be possibly associated with TMS (alterations to the [[endocrine system]], altered [[neurotransmitter]], and [[immune system]] activity) they are considered investigational and lacking substantive proof.<ref name = Rossi/>

Other adverse effects of TMS are:
* Discomfort or pain from the stimulation of the scalp and associated [[nerves]] and [[muscle]]s on the overlying skin;<ref name=nami>{{cite web | url=http://www.nami.org/Content/ContentGroups/Helpline1/Transcranial_Magnetic_Stimulation_(rTMS).htm | title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) | publisher=[[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] | accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> this is more common with rTMS than single pulse TMS.<ref name=Wassermann1998>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0168-5597(97)00096-8}}</ref>
* Rapid deformation of the TMS coil produces a loud clicking sound that increases with the stimulation intensity and can affect hearing with sufficient exposure,  which is particularly relevant for rTMS (hearing protection may be used to prevent this).<ref name=Wassermann1998/>
* rTMS in the presence of EEG-incompatible electrodes can result in electrode heating and, in severe cases, skin burns.<ref name=roth>{{cite doi|10.1016/0168-5597(92)90077-O}}</ref> Non-metallic electrodes are used if concurrent EEG data is required.

==Clinical uses==
The uses of TMS and rTMS can be divided into diagnostic and therapeutic uses.

===Diagnostic use===
TMS can be used clinically to measure activity and function of specific brain circuits in humans.<ref name=diagnostic1>{{cite doi|10.1016.2Fj.clinph.2012.01.010}}</ref> The most robust and widely-accepted use is in measuring the connection between the [[primary motor cortex]] and a muscle to evaluate damage from [[stroke]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[movement disorder]]s, [[motor neuron disease]] and  injuries and other disorders affecting the [[facial nerve|facial]] and other [[cranial nerve]]s and the [[spinal cord]].<ref name=diagnostic1/><ref>{{cite doi|10.1212.2F01.wnl.0000250268.13789.b2}}</ref><ref name="Dimyan">{{cite doi|10.1177/1545968309345270}}</ref><ref name="Nowak">{{cite doi|10.3233/RNN-2010-0552}}</ref> TMS has been suggested as a means of assessing short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) which measures the internal pathways of the [[motor cortex]] but this use has not yet been validated.<ref name=Kujirai>{{cite pmid|8120818}}</ref>

===Therapeutic use===

Studies of the use of TMS and rTMS to treat many neurological and psychiatric conditions have generally shown only modest effects with little confirmation of results.<ref name=Slotema>{{cite pmid|20361902}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|22347797}}</ref> However, publications reporting the results of reviews and statistical [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of earlier investigations have stated that rTMS appeared to be effective in the treatment of certain types of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] under certain specific conditions.<ref name=Slotema/><ref name="pmid17655558">{{cite doi|10.1111.2Fj.1600-0447.2007.01033.x}}</ref><ref>(1) {{cite journal|author=Medical Advisory Secretariat|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CWM44LTG|archivedate=2012-11-28|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/tech/reviews/pdf/rev_rtms_060104.pdf|title=Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of major depressive disorder: an evidence-based analysis|journal=Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series|format=pdf|year=2004|volume=4|accessdate=2012-11-28|issue=7}}<br>(2) {{cite doi|10.1111.2Fj.1600-0447.2007.01033.x}}<br>(3) {{cite doi|10.1017.2FS0033291708003462}}<br>(4) {{cite pmid|18801225}}</br>(5) {{cite doi|10.2174.2F1745017901107010167}}<br>(6) {{cite doi|10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10060864}}<br>(7) {{cite web|author=Gaynes BN, Lux L, Lloyd S, Hansen RA, Gartlehner G, Thieda P, Brode S, Swinson Evans T, Jonas D, Crotty K, Viswanathan M, Lohr KN, [[Research Triangle Park]], [[North Carolina]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BLBRlpyk|archivedate=2012-10-11|url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/76/792/TRD_CER33_20111110.pdf|title=Nonpharmacologic Interventions for Treatment-Resistant Depression in Adults.

A meta-analysis of 34 studies comparing rTMS to sham treatment for the acute treatment of depression showed an [[effect size]] of 0.55 (p<.001).<ref name=Slotema/> This is comparable to commonly reported effect sizes of pharmacotherapeutic strategies for treatment of depression in the range of 0.17-0.46.<ref name=Slotema/> However, that same meta-analysis found that rTMS was significantly worse than [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) (effect size = -0.47), although side effects were significantly better with rTMS. An analysis of one of the studies included in the meta-analysis showed that one extra remission from depression occurs for every 3 patients given electroconvulsive therapy rather than rTMS (number needed to treat 2.36).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1176.2Fappi.ajp.164.1.73}}</ref>  There is evidence that rTMS can temporarily reduce chronic pain and change pain-related brain and nerve activity, and TMS has been used to predict the success of surgically implanted electrical brain stimulation for the treatment of pain.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s11916-009-0004-2}}</ref>

Other areas of research include the rehabilitation of [[aphasia]] and motor disability after stroke,<ref name=Rossi /><ref name="Dimyan" /><ref name="Nowak" /><ref>(1) {{cite pmid|19818232}}<br>(2) {{cite doi|10.1097.2FPHM.0b013e318228bf0c}}</ref> [[tinnitus]],<ref>{{cite pmid |19205161}}</ref> [[Parkinson's disease]],<ref>{{cite doi|10.1586.2Fern.09.132}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1186.2F1755-7682-1-2}}</ref> [[tic]] disorders<ref>{{cite pmid|22398000}}</ref> and the negative symptoms of [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.4088.2FJCP.08r04808yel}}</ref> TMS has failed to show effectiveness for the treatment of [[brain death]], [[coma]], and other [[persistent vegetative state]]s.<ref>{{cite pmid | 20157993 }}</ref>

It is difficult to establish a convincing form of "sham" TMS to test for [[placebo]] effects during [[Scientific control|controlled]] [[Clinical trial|trials]] in [[conscious]] individuals, due to the neck pain, headache and twitching in the scalp or upper face associated with the intervention.<ref name = Rossi/> "Sham" TMS manipulations can affect [[cerebrum|cerebral]] [[Glycolysis|glucose metabolism]] and MEPs, which may confound results.<ref name="pmid17655558" /> This problem is exacerbated when using [[Subjectivity|subjective]] measures of improvement.<ref name = Rossi/>  Placebo responses in trials of rTMS in major depression are [[Negative relationship|negatively associated]] with refractoriness to treatment, vary among studies and can influence results.<ref>{{pmid|19293925}}</ref>  Depending on the research question asked and the [[design of experiments|experimental design]], matching the discomfort of rTMS to distinguish true effects from placebo can be an important and challenging issue.<ref name = Rossi/> 

One [[multicenter trial]] of rTMS in depression used an active  "sham" placebo treatment that appeared to mimic the sound and scalp stimulation associated with active TMS treatment.  The investigators reported that the patients and clinical raters were unable to guess the treatment better than chance, suggesting that the sham placebo adequately [[Blind experiment|blinded]] these people to treatment.<ref name=sham/> The investigators concluded: "Although the treatment effect was statistically significant on a clinically meaningful variable (remission), the overall number of remitters and responders was less than one would like with a treatment that requires daily intervention for 3 weeks or more, even with a benign adverse effect profile".<ref name=sham>{{cite doi|10.1001.2Farchgenpsychiatry.2010.46}}</ref> However, a review of the trial's report has questioned the adequacy of the placebo, noting that treaters were able to guess whether patients were receiving treatment with active or sham TMS, better than chance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mattes|first=Jeffrey A|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110116075558/http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/eletters/67/5/507|archivedate=2011-01-16|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/eletters/67/5/507#13743|title=TMS: Does it Really Work|journal=[[Archives of General Psychiatry]]|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|date=2010-06-29|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> In this regard, the trial's report stated that the confidence ratings for the treaters' guesses were low.<ref name=sham/>

==FDA actions==

In January 2007, an advisory panel of the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) did not recommend clearance for marketing of an rTMS device, stating that the device appeared to be reasonably safe but had failed to demonstrate [[efficacy]] in a study of people with major depression who had not benefitted from prior adequate treatment with oral antidepressants during their current major depressive episode.<ref name="Scudiero">{{cite web | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] | last = Scudiero | first = JL | url = http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/NeurologicalDevicesPanel/ucm124779.htm | title = Brief Summary From the Neurological Devices Panel Meeting - January 26, 2007| accessdate = 2010-07-14 | date = 2007-01-26 | quote=The Panel’s consensus was that the efficacy was not established; some stated that the device’s effectiveness was “small,” “borderline,” “marginal” and “of questionable clinical significance.” }}</ref> The panel agreed that "unblinding was greater in the active group, and considering the magnitude of the effect size, it may have influenced the study results."<ref name="Scudiero" />  However, the FDA determined in December 2008 that the rTMS device was sufficiently similar to existing devices that did not require a [[premarket approval]] application and allowed the device to be marketed in accordance with [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act#Section 510(k) and the device approval process|Section 510(k)]] of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] for "the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in adult patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from one prior [[antidepressant]] medication at or above the minimal effective dose and duration in the current episode".<ref name="Melkerson"/>  The user manual for the device warns that effectiveness has not been established in patients with major depressive disorder who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from zero and from two or more antidepressant medications in the current episode and that the device has not been studied in patients who have had no prior antidepressant medication.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.neuronetics.com/pdf/Prescribing%20Information.pdf|title=NeuroStar TMS Therapy System User Manual|volume=1|pages=1–5|publisher=[[Neuronetics|Neuronetics, Inc.]]|accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

In July 2011, the FDA published a final rule in the [[Federal Register]] that classified the rTMS system into [[Medical device#Class II: General controls with special controls|Class II (special controls)]] "in order to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of these devices".  The rule identified the rTMS system as "an external device that delivers transcranial pulsed magnetic fields of sufficient magnitude to induce neural action potentials in the prefrontal cortex to treat the symptoms of major depressive disorder without inducing seizure in patients who have failed at least one antidepressant medication and are currently not on any antidepressant therapy".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stade|first=NK, Deputy Director for Policy, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-07-26/pdf/2011-18806.pdf|title=Medical Devices; Neurological Devices; Classification of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation System: Final rule|journal=[[Federal Register]]|volume=76|pages=44489–44491|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|date=2011-07-26|accessdate=2011-08-11|issue=143}}</ref> An FDA guidance document issued in conjunction with the final rule describes the special controls that support the classification of the rTMS system into Class II.<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Food and Drug Administration: Center for Devices and Radiological Health: Office of Device Evaluation: Division of Ophthalmic, Neurological and Ear, Nose and Throat Devices: Neurodiagnostic and Neurotherapeutic Devices Branch|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm265269.htm|title=Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Systems|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=2011-07-26|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>

===Response to FDA decision===
Soon after the FDA cleared the device, several members of [[Public Citizen]] stated in a [[letter to the editor]] of the medical journal ''[[Neuropsychopharmacology (journal)|Neuropsychopharmacology]]'' that the FDA seemed to have based its decision on a [[post-hoc analysis|''post-hoc'' analysis]] that did not establish the effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of depression.  The writers of the letter expressed their concern that patients would be diverted from therapies such as antidepressant medications that have an established history of effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hines |first=JZ |last2=Lurie |first2=P |last3=Wolfe SM|first3=Sidney M|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v34/n8/pdf/npp200922a.pdf|title=Reply to Lisanby et al.: ''Post hoc'' analysis does not establish effectiveness of rTMS for depression|journal=[[Neuropsychopharmacology (journal)|Neuropsychopharmacology]]| year = 2009| volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=2053–2054 |pmid=19528946 |doi=10.1038/npp.2009.22 | format = pdf |authorlink3= Sidney M.

==Health insurance considerations==

===United States===

====Commercial health insurance====
In July 2011, the Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) of the [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]], in cooperation with the [[Kaiser Permanente|Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and the Southern California Permanente Medical Group]], determined that TMS for the treatment of depression did not meet the TEC's criteria, which assess whether a technology improves health outcomes such as length of life, quality of life and functional ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcbs.com/blueresources/tec/tec-criteria.html|title=Technology Evaluation Center Criteria|work=[http://www.bcbs.com/blueresources/tec/ Technology Evaluation Center (TEC)]|publisher=[[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]]|accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref><ref name=TEC1>{{cite journal|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BMxPPs8X|archivedate=2012-10-12|url=http://www.elsevierbi.com/~/media/Images/Publications/Archive/The%20Gray%20Sheet/37/35/01110829008/082911_bcbs_tms_august11.pdf|title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Depression|journal=[http://www.bcbs.com/blueresources/tec/ TEC Assessment Program]|volume=26|date=July 2011|publisher=[[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]]|accessdate=2012-10-12|issue=3}}</ref> The TEC's report stated that "the meta-analyses and recent clinical trials of TMS generally show statistically significant effects on depression outcomes at the end of the TMS treatment period. However, there is a lack of rigorous evaluation beyond the treatment period", which was, with a few exceptions, one to four weeks.<ref name=TEC1 /> The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's medical advisory panel concluded that "the available evidence does not permit conclusions regarding the effect of TMS on health outcomes or compared with alternatives.”<ref name=TEC1 /> 

In 2012, several commercial health insurance plans in the United States, including [[Anthem (insurance)|Anthem]], [[Health Net]], and [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross Blue Shield]] of [[Nebraska]] and of [[Rhode Island]], covered TMS for the treatment of depression.<ref>(1) {{cite web|author=Anthem|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BLNmAIJh|archivedate=2012-10-11|url=http://www.anthem.com/ca/medicalpolicies/policies/mp_pw_a047769.htm|title=Medical Policy: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Depression and Other Neuropsychiatric Disorders|work=Policy No. BEH.00002|publisher=Anthem |date=2012-08-09|accessdate=2012-09-05}}<br>(2) {{cite web|author=Health Net|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BLNdUZpk|archivedate=2012-10-11|url=https://www.healthnet.com/static/general/unprotected/pdfs/national/policies/Transcranial_Magnetic_Stimulation_Mar_12.pdf|title=National Medical Policy: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation|work=Policy Number NMP 508|publisher=Health Net|date=March 2012|accessdate=2012-09-05}}<br> (3) {{cite web|author=Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BLN4D8mx|archivedate=2012-10-11|work=Section IV.67|title=Medical Policy Manual|date=2011-05-2011|publisher= Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska |year=2012|unused_data=https://www.nebraskablue.com/~/media/pdf/Provider/Policy%20Procedure%20Manuals/MedicalPolicies.pdf}}<br>(4) {{cite web|author=Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BLNAY6l7|archivedate=2012-10-11|url=https://www.bcbsri.com/sites/default/files/polices/TranscranialMagneticStimulationasaTreatmentofDepressionandOtherPsychiatricNeurologicDisorders_0.pdf|title=Medical Coverage Policy: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment of Depression and Other Psychiatric/Neurologic Disorders|publisher= Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island |date=2012-05-15|accessdate=2012-09-05}}</ref>  In contrast, [[UnitedHealth Group|UnitedHealthcare]] issued a medical policy for TMS in 2012 that stated there is insufficient evidence that the procedure is beneficial for health outcomes in patients with depression.

In early 2012, the efforts of TMS treatment advocates, including a Rhode Island physician who used TMS in her practice to treat patients with depression, resulted in the approval for the [[New England]] region of the first [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] coverage policy for TMS in the United States.<ref>(1) {{cite web|author=[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] |url=http://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/indexes/lcd-list.aspx?Cntrctr=207#ResultsAnchor|title= Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) |publisher= [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|year=2012|accessdate=2012-09-05}}<br>(2) {{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/lcd-details.aspx?LCDId=32228&ContrId=208&ver=3&ContrVer=1&CntrctrSelected=208*1&Cntrctr=208&name=NHIC%2c+Corp.+(14202%2c+MAC+-+Part+B)&DocStatus=Future&s=24&bc=AggAAAIAQAAA&|title=Local Coverage Determination (LCD) for Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) (L32228)|author=[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]]|publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|date=2012-01-27|accessdate=2012-10-12}}<br>(3) {{cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BLOZQP6W|archivedate=2012-10-11|accessdate=2012-10-11|url=http://www.pbn.com/Important-Treatment-Option-for-Depression-Receives-Medicare-Coverage,66462|title=Important Treatment Option for Depression Receives Medicare Coverage|work=Press Release|date=2012-03-30|publisher=[http://www.pbn.com/ PBN.com: Providence Business News]}}<br>(4) {{cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BN4UpUXK|archivedate=2012-10-12|url=http://www.cvmc.org/news/2012-theresa-fama-cepac|title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Cites Influence of New England Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council (CEPAC)|date=2012-02-06|location=[[Berlin, Vermont]]|publisher=[[Central Vermont Medical Center]]|accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref> However, in August 2012, the Medicare administrative contractor for the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] jurisdiction covering [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Colorado]], [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[New Mexico]] determined that, based on limitations in the published literature, <blockquote>... the evidence is insufficient to determine rTMS improves health outcomes in the Medicare or general population. ...

====National Health Service====
The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] 2007 guidance to the [[National Health Service]] in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] on transcranial magnetic stimulation for severe depression (IPG242), considered for reassessment in January 2011, states: 
<blockquote>Current evidence suggests that there are no major safety concerns associated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for severe depression.  There is uncertainty about the procedure's clinical efficacy, which may depend on higher intensity, greater frequency, bilateral application and/or longer treatment durations than have appeared in the evidence to date. TMS should therefore be performed only in research studies designed to investigate these factors.<ref>(1) {{cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CUsaPbmy|archivedate=2012-11-27|url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-for-severe-depression-ipg242|title=Guidance: Transcranial magnetic stimulation for severe depression (IPG242)|work=NICE interventional procedure guidance, issued November 2007|publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]|accessdate=2012-11-27}}<br>(2) {{cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CUrsKLDq|archivedate=2012-11-27|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/IPG242|title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation for severe depression (IPG242)|publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]|date=2011-03-04|accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref></blockquote>

==American Medical Association category codes==
In 2011, the [[American Medical Association]] established three Category I CPT® Codes to be used for the reporting and billing of therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment services.<ref>{{cite web|author=American Medical Association|url=https://ocm.ama-assn.org/OCM/CPTRelativeValueSearch.do|title=Current Procedural Terminology|publisher=American Medical Association|year=2012|accessdate=2012-02-02}}</ref> The three codes effective January 1, 2012 are:

* 90867 – Therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment; initial, including cortical mapping, motor threshold determination, delivery and management
* 90868 – Therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment; subsequent delivery and management, per session
* 90869 – Therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment; subsequent motor threshold re-determination with delivery and management

==Technical information==
[[Image:TMS focal field .png|right|150px]]
[[Image:TMS Butterfly Coil HEAD .png|right|thumb|240px|TMS - Butterfly Coils]]
TMS uses [[electromagnetic induction]] to generate an electric current across the [[scalp]] and [[Human skull|skull]] without physical contact.  A plastic-enclosed coil of wire is held next to the skull and when activated, produces a [[magnetic field]] oriented [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the plane of the coil. The magnetic field passes unimpeded through the skin and skull, inducing an oppositely directed current in the brain that activates nearby nerve cells in much the same way as currents applied directly to the cortical surface.<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of psychophysiology |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-521-84471-1 |edition=3rd |editor=Cacioppo, JT; Tassinary, LG; Berntson, GG.|page=121}}</ref>

The path of this current is difficult to model because the brain is irregularly shaped and electricity and magnetism are not [[Electrical conduction|conducted]] uniformly throughout its tissues.  The magnetic field is about the same strength as an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and the pulse generally reaches no more than 5 centimeters into the brain unless using the Deep TMS variant of TMS.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies.shtml | title = Brain Stimulation Therapies | accessdate = 2010-07-14 | date = 2009-11-17 | publisher = [[National Institute of Mental Health]] }}</ref> Deep TMS can reach up to 6cm into the brain to stimulate deeper layers of the [[motor cortex]], such as that which controls leg motion.<ref name=Zangen>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.clinph.2004.11.008}}</ref>

=== Coil types ===
The design of transcranial magnetic stimulation coils used in either treatment or diagnostic/experimental studies may differ in a variety of ways.  These differences should be considered in the interpretation of any study result, and the type of coil used should be specified in the study methods for any published reports.

The most important considerations include:
* the type of material used to construct the core of the coil
* the geometry of the coil configuration
* the biophysical characteristics of the pulse produced by the coil.

With regard to coil composition, the core material may be either a magnetically inert substrate (i.e., the so-called ‘air-core’ coil design), or possess a solid, ferromagnetically active material (i.e., the so-called ‘solid-core’ design).  Solid core coil design result in a more efficient transfer of electrical energy into a magnetic field, with a substantially reduced amount of energy dissipated as heat, and so can be operated under more aggressive duty cycles often mandated in therapeutic protocols, without treatment interruption due to heat accumulation, or the use of an accessory method of cooling the coil during operation.  Varying the geometric shape of the coil itself may also result in variations in the focality, shape, and depth of cortical penetration of the magnetic field.  Differences in the coil substance as well as the electronic operation of the power supply to the coil may also result in variations in the biophysical characteristics of the resulting magnetic pulse (e.g., width or duration of the magnetic field pulse).  All of these features should be considered when comparing results obtained from different studies, with respect to both safety and efficacy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Transcranial Stimulation |editor=Wassermann EM, Epstein CM, Ziemann U, Walsh V, Paus T, Lisanby SH |chapter=TMS Stimulator Design |author=Riehl M |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-856892-4 |pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=YeKleGrKwC4C&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false 13–23], [http://books.google.com/books?id=YeKleGrKwC4C&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false 25–32] }}</ref>

A number of different types of coils exist, each of which produce different magnetic field patterns. Some examples:

* round coil: the original type of TMS coil
* figure-eight coil (i.e. butterfly coil): results in a more focal pattern of activation
* double-cone coil: conforms to shape of head, useful for deeper stimulation
* four-leaf coil: for focal stimulation of peripheral nerves<ref name=roth2>{{cite doi|10.1016/0168-5597(94)90093-0}}</ref>


Design variations in the shape of the TMS coils allow much deeper penetration of the brain than the standard depth of 1.5-2.5 cm.  Circular crown coils, Hesed (or H-core) coils, double cone coils, and other experimental variations can induce excitation or inhibition of neurons deeper in the brain including activation of motor neurons for the [[cerebellum]], legs and [[pelvic floor]].  Though able to penetrate deeper in the brain, they are less able to produced a focused, localized response and are relatively non-focal.<ref name = Rossi/>
