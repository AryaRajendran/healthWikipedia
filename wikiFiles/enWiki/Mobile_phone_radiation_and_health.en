The '''effect of mobile phone radiation on human health''' is the subject of recent interest and study, as a result of the enormous increase in [[mobile phone]] usage throughout the world ({{As of|2011|11|alt=as of November 2011}}, there were more than 6 billion subscriptions worldwide<ref name = "GSM Association Market Data Summary">{{cite web |url=http://www.gsmworld.com/newsroom/market-data/market_data_summary.htm |title = Market Data Summary (Q2 2009)|publisher= [[GSM Association]]|accessdate= 2010-01-30}}</ref>). Mobile phones use [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[microwave]] range. Other [[Wireless electronic devices and health|digital wireless systems]], such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.

In 2011, [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)]] has classified mobile phone radiation on the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] scale into [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]] - possibly carcinogenic. That means that there "could be some risk" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.<ref name="WHO_IARC_110531">{{cite press release|url= http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf |format= PDF|title= IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans|work= [[World Health Organization]] press release N° 208|publisher= [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]|date= 2011-05-31|accessdate= 2011-06-02}}</ref> After that, [[World Health Organization|WHO]] precised that "to date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/</ref> Some national radiation advisory authorities<ref name="AustriaPrecaution">{{cite web |url= http://www.pressbaum.net/wai_startseite-aktuelles-handy.htm|title= Information: Wie gefährlich sind Handystrahlen wirklich?|accessdate=2008-01-23|language= German|publisher= [[Pressbaum|Marktgemeinde Pressbaum]]}}</ref> have recommended measures to minimize exposure to their citizens as a [[precautionary principle|precautionary approach]].

==Effects==
Many scientific studies have investigated possible health symptoms of mobile phone [[radiation]]. These studies are occasionally reviewed by some scientific committees to assess overall risks. A recent assessment was published in 2007 by the [[European Commission]] [[Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks]] (SCENIHR).<ref name="SCENIHR">{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/electromagnetic-fields/l-3/5-conclusions-mobile-phones.htm |title= Conclusions on mobile phones and radio frequency fields |accessdate=2008-12-08 |publisher=[[European Commission]] Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks ([[SCENIHR]])}}</ref> It concludes that the three lines of evidence, ''viz.'' animal, ''in vitro'', and epidemiological studies, indicate that "exposure to RF fields is unlikely to lead to an increase in cancer in humans".

===Radiation absorption===
Part of the radio waves emitted by a mobile telephone handset are absorbed by the body. The radio waves emitted by a [[GSM]] handset can have a peak [[power (physics)|power]] of 2 [[watt]]s, and a US analogue phone had a maximum transmit power of 3.6 [[watt]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Other digital mobile technologies, such as [[CDMA2000]] and [[Digital AMPS|D-AMPS]], use lower output power, typically below 1 watt. {{Dubious|date=November 2012}} The maximum power output from a mobile phone is regulated by the mobile phone standard and by the regulatory agencies in each country. In most systems the cellphone and the [[base station]] check reception quality and signal strength and the power level is increased or decreased automatically, within a certain span, to accommodate different situations, such as inside or outside of buildings and vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.analogzone.com/hft_1206.pdf |format=pdf |title=Output Power-Control Loop Design for GSM Mobile Phones |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-02-12}}</ref>

The rate at which energy is absorbed by the human body is measured by the [[Specific absorption rate|Specific Absorption Rate]] (SAR), and its maximum levels for modern handsets have been set by governmental regulating agencies in many countries. In the [[USA]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has set a SAR limit of 1.6 W/kg, averaged over a volume of 1&nbsp;gram of tissue, for the head. In Europe, the limit is 2 W/kg, averaged over a volume of 10&nbsp;grams of tissue. SAR values are heavily dependent on the size of the averaging volume. Without information about the averaging volume used, comparisons between different measurements cannot be made. Thus, the European 10-gram ratings should be compared among themselves, and the American 1-gram ratings should only be compared among themselves.
SAR data for specific mobile phones, along with other useful information, can be found directly on manufacturers' websites, as well as on third party web sites.<ref>For example, two listings using the European 10 g standard: of more current models at {{cite web |url= http://www.mobile-phones-uk.org.uk/index.htm|title= Mobile Phones UK|accessdate=2008-01-19 |work= Mobile Phones UK web site|publisher=Landmark Internet Ltd}}; of phones from 2005 and earlier at {{cite web |url= http://www.sarvalues.com/eu-complete.html|title= The Complete SAR List For All Phones (Europe)|accessdate=2008-01-19 |publisher= On-Line-Net - Web Design & Internet Services (as SARValues.com)}} (a listing of US phones from 2005 and earlier, using the US 1 g standard, is also available at the SARValues site)</ref> It is worth noting that thermal radiation is not comparable to ionizing radiation in that it only increases the temperature in normal matter, it does not break molecular bonds or release electrons from their atoms.

===Thermal effects===
One well-understood effect of microwave radiation is [[dielectric heating]], in which any dielectric material (such as [[tissue (biology)|living tissue]]) is heated by rotations of [[polar molecule]]s induced by the electromagnetic field. In the case of a person using a cell phone, most of the heating effect will occur at the surface of the head, causing its [[temperature]] to increase by a fraction of a degree<!--Fahrenheit or Celsius?-->. In this case, the level of temperature increase is an order of magnitude less than that obtained during the exposure of the head to direct sunlight. The brain's [[blood circulation]] is capable of disposing of excess heat by increasing local [[blood flow]]. However, the [[cornea]] of the eye does not have this [[temperature regulation]] mechanism and exposure of 2–3 hours duration has been reported to produce cataracts in rabbits' eyes at SAR values from 100-140W/kg, which produced lenticular temperatures of 41°C. There were no cataracts detected in the eyes of monkeys exposed under similar conditions.<ref name="ICNIRP Guidelines">{{cite journal|author= International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection|title= Guidelines For Limiting Exposure To Time-Varying Electric, Magnetic, And Electromagnetic Fields (up to 300 GHz)|journal= Health Physics|volume= 74|issue= 4|year= 1998|month= April|pages= 494–505|url= http://www.icnirp.de/documents/statgdl.pdf |format= PDF|accessdate= 2010-03-28|pmid=9525427}}</ref> Premature cataracts have not been linked with cell phone use, possibly because of the lower power output of mobile phones.

===Non-thermal effects===
The communications protocols used by mobile phones often result in low-frequency pulsing of the carrier signal. Whether these modulations have biological significance has been subject to debate.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1667/RR3191 |title=Biological Effects of Radiofrequency Fields: Does Modulation Matter? |year=2004 |last1=Foster |first1=Kenneth R. |last2=Repacholi |first2=Michael H. |journal=Radiation Research |volume=162 |issue=2 |pages=219–25 |pmid=15387150}}</ref>

Some researchers have argued that so-called "non-thermal effects" could be reinterpreted as a normal cellular response to an increase in temperature. The German biophysicist Roland Glaser, for example,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Glaser|first= Roland|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2005|month= December|title= Are thermoreceptors responsible for "non-thermal" effects of RF fields? |journal= Edition Wissenschaft |volume= |issue= 21|pages= | oclc= 179908725|id= |url= http://www.fgf.de/publikationen/edition-wissenschaft/Edition_Wissenschaft_Nr21.pdf | format = PDF| publisher = Forschungsgemeinschaft Funk| location = [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]|accessdate= 2008-01-19 |quote= }}</ref> has argued that there are several thermoreceptor molecules in cells, and that they activate a cascade of second and third messenger systems, gene expression mechanisms and production of [[heat shock protein]]s in order to defend the cell against metabolic [[cell stress]] caused by heat. The increases in temperature that cause these changes are too small to be detected by studies such as REFLEX, which base their whole argument on the apparent stability of thermal equilibrium in their cell cultures.

Other researchers believe the stress proteins are unrelated to thermal effects, since they occur for both extremely low frequencies (ELF) and radio frequencies (RF), which have very different energy levels.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.01.006 |title=Electromagnetic fields stress living cells |year=2009 |last1=Blank |first1=Martin |last2=Goodman |first2=Reba |journal=Pathophysiology |volume=16 |issue=2–3 |pages=71–8 |pmid=19268550}}</ref> Another preliminary study published in 2011 by ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' conducted using [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] injections and [[positron emission tomography]] concluded that exposure to [[radiofrequency]] signal waves within parts of the brain closest to the cell phone antenna resulted in increased levels of [[glucose]] [[glucose metabolism|metabolism]], but the [[clinical significance]] of this finding is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2011.186 |title=Effects of Cell Phone Radiofrequency Signal Exposure on Brain Glucose Metabolism |year=2011 |first1=Nora D. |last1=Volkow |first2=Dardo |last2=Tomasi |first3=Gene-Jack |last3=Wang |first4=Paul |last4=Vaska |first5=Joanna S. |last5=Fowler |first6=Frank |last6=Telang |first7=Dave |last7=Alexoff |first8=Jean |last8=Logan |first9=Christopher |last9=Wong |journal=JAMA |volume=305 |issue=8 |pages=808–13 |pmid=21343580}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Press|first=Canadian|title=Cellphones linked to increased brain glucose metabolism|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/mobile-technology/cellphones-linked-to-increased-brain-glucose-metabolism/article1917098/|accessdate=26 February 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=February 23, 2011|location=Toronto}}</ref>

====Blood–brain barrier effects====
Swedish researchers from [[Lund University]] (Salford, Brun, Persson, Eberhardt, and Malmgren) have studied the effects of microwave radiation on the rat brain. They found a leakage of [[albumin]] into the brain via a permeated [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Salford| first = Leif G.| authorlink = | coauthors = Arne E.

====Cancer====
In 2006 a large Danish study about the connection between mobile phone use and cancer incidence was published. It followed over 420,000 Danish citizens for 20 years and showed no increased risk of cancer.<ref name="Schüzetal2006">{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Schüz| first = J| authorlink = | coauthors = Jacobsen, R; Olsen, JH; Boice, JD; McLaughlin, JK; Johansen, C| year = 2006| month = December| title = Cellular Telephone Use and Cancer Risk: Update of a Nationwide Danish Cohort| journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute| volume = 98| issue = 23| pages = 1707–1713| pmid = 17148772| doi = 10.1093/jnci/djj464| url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/23/1707| accessdate = 2008-01-20| quote = Among long-term subscribers of 10 years or more, cellular telephone use was not associated with increased risk for brain tumors ..., and there was no trend with time since first subscription. ...CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence for an association between tumor risk and cellular telephone use among either short-term or long-term users. Moreover, the narrow confidence intervals provide evidence that any large association of risk of cancer and cellular telephone use can be excluded.}}</ref> The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection ([[Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz]]) considers this report inconclusive.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bfs.de/en/elektro/hff/papiere.html/daenische_Kohorte.html|title= Comments on the Danish cohort study on mobile phones|accessdate=2010-09-23|date= 2007-02-22|work= |language= German|publisher= Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz [Federal Office for Radiation Protection]}}</ref>

The following studies of long time exposure have been published:
* The 13 nation INTERPHONE project – the largest study of its kind ever undertaken – has now been published and did not find a solid link between mobile phones and brain tumours.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/piercing-the-fog-around-cellphones-and-cancer/ | work=The New York Times | first=Tara | last=Parker-Pope | title=Piercing the Fog Around Cellphones and Cancer | date=2011-06-06}}</ref>

The ''International Journal of Epidemiology'' published<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/dyq079 |title=Brain tumour risk in relation to mobile telephone use: Results of the INTERPHONE international case-control study |year=2010 |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=675–694 |pmid=20483835 |author1=Interphone Study Group}}</ref> a combined data analysis from a multi national population-based case-control study of [[glioma]] and [[meningioma]], the most common types of brain tumour.

The authors reported the following conclusion:

<blockquote>Overall, no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with use of mobile phones. There were suggestions of an increased risk of glioma at the highest exposure levels, but biases and error prevent a causal interpretation. The possible effects of long-term heavy use of mobile phones require further investigation.</blockquote>

In the press release<ref>{{cite press release |title=Interphone study reports on mobile phone use and brain cancer risk |publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |date=17 May 2010 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2010/pdfs/pr200_E.pdf |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> accompanying the release of the paper, Dr. Christopher Wild, Director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said:

<blockquote>An increased risk of brain cancer is not established from the data from Interphone. However, observations at the highest level of cumulative call time and the changing patterns of mobile phone use since the period studied by Interphone, particularly in young people, mean that further investigation of mobile phone use and brain cancer risk is merited.</blockquote>

A number of independent health and government authorities have commented on this important study including The Australian Centre for Radiofrequency Bioeffects Research (ACRBR) which said in a statement that:<ref>http://www.acrbr.org.au/FAQ/ACRBR%20Interphone%20Position%20Statement%20May2010.pdf</ref>

<blockquote>Until now there have been concerns that mobile phones were causing increases in brain tumours. Interphone is both large and rigorous enough to address this claim, and it has not provided any convincing scientific evidence of an association between mobile phone use and the development of glioma or meningioma. While the study demonstrates some weak evidence of an association with the highest tenth of cumulative call time (but only in those who started mobile phone use most recently), the authors conclude that biases and errors limit the strength of any conclusions in this group. It now seems clear that if there was an effect of mobile phone use on brain tumour risks in adults, this is likely to be too small to be detectable by even a large multinational study of the size of Interphone.</blockquote>

The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) which said in a statement that:

<blockquote>On the basis of current understanding of the relationship between brain cancer and use of mobile phones, including the recently published data from the INTERPHONE study, ARPANSA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'''concludes''' that currently available data do not warrant any general recommendation to limit use of mobile phones in the adult population,</blockquote>

<blockquote>'''continues''' to inform those concerned about potential health effects that they may limit their exposure by reducing call time, by making calls where reception is good, by using hands-free devices or speaker options, or by texting; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>'''recommends''' that, due to the lack of any data relating to children and long term use of mobile phones, parents encourage their children to limit their exposure by reducing call time, by making calls where reception is good, by using hands-free devices or speaker options, or by texting.</blockquote>

The Cancer Council Australia said in a [http://ewsmedia/mediareleases/mediareleases2010/17May2010.htm statement] that it cautiously welcomed the results of the largest international study to date into mobile phone use, which has found no evidence that normal use of mobile phones, for a period up to 12 years, can cause brain cancer.

Chief Executive Officer, Professor Ian Olver, said findings from the Interphone study, conducted across 13 countries including Australia, were consistent with other research that had failed to find a link between mobile phones and cancer.

<blockquote>This supports previous research showing mobile phones don’t damage cell DNA, meaning they can’t cause the type of genetic mutations that develop into cancer,” Professor Olver said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, it has been suggested that electromagnetic fields associated with mobile phones may play a role in speeding up the development of an existing cancer. The Interphone study found no evidence to support this theory.</blockquote>

* A Danish study (2004) that took place over 10 years found no evidence to support a link. However, this study has been criticized for collecting data from subscriptions and not necessarily from actual users. It is known that some subscribers do not use the phones themselves but provide them for family members to use. That this happens is supported by the observation that only 61% of a small sample of the subscribers reported use of mobile phones when responding to a questionnaire.<ref name="Schüzetal2006">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/djj464 |title=Cellular Telephone Use and Cancer Risk: Update of a Nationwide Danish Cohort |year=2006 |first1=Joachim |last1=Schüz |first2=Rune |last2=Jacobsen |first3=Jørgen H. |last3=Olsen |first4=John D. |last4=Boice |first5=Joseph K. |last5=McLaughlin |first6=Christoffer |last6=Johansen |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=98 |issue=23 |pages=1707–13 |pmid=17148772}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/djk143 |title=Re: Cellular Telephone Use and Cancer Risk: Update of a Nationwide Danish Cohort Study |year=2007 |last1=Ahlbom |first1=Anders |last2=Feychting |first2=Maria |last3=Cardis |first3=Elisabeth |last4=Elliott |first4=Paul |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=99 |issue=8 |pages=655–655 |pmid=17440169}}</ref>

Other studies on cancer and mobile phones are:

* A Swedish scientific team at the [[Karolinska Institute]] conducted an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] study (2004) that suggested that regular use of a mobile phone over a decade or more was associated with an increased risk of [[acoustic neuroma]], a type of benign [[brain]] tumor.

A publication titled "Public health implications of wireless technologies" cites that Lennart Hardell found age is a significant factor. The report repeated the finding that the use of cell phones before age 20 increased the risk of brain tumors by 5.2, compared to 1.4 for all ages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sage C, Carpenter DO |title=Public health implications of wireless technologies |journal=Pathophysiology |volume= 16|issue= 2–3|pages= 233–46|year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19285839 |doi=10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.01.011 |url=}}</ref> A review by Hardell et al. concluded that current mobile phones are not safe for long-term exposure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hardell L, Carlberg M, Hansson Mild K |title=Epidemiological evidence for an association between use of wireless phones and tumor diseases |journal=Pathophysiology |volume= 16|issue= 2–3|pages= 113–22|year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19268551 |doi=10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.01.003 |url=}}</ref>

In a time trends study in Europe, conducted by the Institute of Cancer Epidemiology in Copenhagen, no significant increase in brain tumors among cell phone users was found between the years of 1998 and 2003. "The lack of a trend change in incidence from 1998 to 2003 suggests that the [[Carcinogenesis|induction]] period relating mobile phone use to brain tumors exceeds 5–10 years, the increased risk in this population is too small to be observed, the increased risk is restricted to subgroups of brain tumors or mobile phone users, or there is no increased risk."<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Deltour|first1= Isabelle|last2= Johansen|first2= Christoffer|last3= Auvinen|first3= Anssi|last4= Feychting|first4= Maria|last5= Klaeboe|first5= Lars|last6= Schüz|first6= Joachim|date= 2009-12-16|title= Time Trends in Brain Tumor Incidence Rates in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, 1974–2003|journal= Journal of the National Cancer Institute|volume= 101|issue= 24|pages= 1721–1724|doi= 10.1093/jnci/djp415|pmid= 19959779}}</ref>

On 31 May 2011 the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans ([[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]]). The IARC assessed and evaluated available literature and studies about the carcinogenicity of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), and found the evidence to be "limited for carcinogenicity of RF-EMF, based on positive associations between glioma and acoustic neuroma and exposure". The conclusion of the IARC was mainly based on the INTERPHONE study, which found an increased risk for glioma in the highest category of heavy users (30 minutes per day over a 10‐year period), although no increased risk was found at lower exposure and other studies could not back up the findings. The evidence for other types of cancer was found to be "inadequate". Some members of the Working Group opposed the conclusions and considered the current evidence in humans still as “inadequate”, citing inconsistencies between the assessed studies.<ref name="WHO_IARC_110531" /><ref name="lancet">{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Baan| first = Robert| authorlink = | coauthors = Yann Grosse, Béatrice Lauby-Secretan, Fatiha El Ghissassi, Véronique Bouvard, Lamia Benbrahim-Tallaa, Neela Guha, Farhad Islami, Laurent Galichet, Kurt Straif| year = 2011| month = July| title = Carcinogenicity of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields| journal = The Lancet Onkology| volume = 12| issue = 7| pages = 624–626| pmid =21845765| doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(11)70147-4| url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2811%2970147-4/fulltext| accessdate = 2011-06-26| quote = }}</ref>

Researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that while cell phone use increased substantially over the period 1992 to 2008 (from nearly zero to almost 100 percent of the population), the U.S. trends in glioma incidence did not mirror that increase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/2012/GliomaCellPhoneUse |title=U.S. population data show no increase in brain cancer rates during period of expanding cell phone use |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-02-12}}</ref>

====Cognitive effects====
A 2009 study examined the effects of exposure to radiofrequency radiation (RFR) emitted by standard GSM cell phones on the cognitive functions of humans. The study confirmed longer (slower) response times to a spatial working memory task when exposed to RFR from a standard GSM cellular phone placed next to the head of male subjects,<!--What was this effect, specifically? Please add this information.--> and showed that longer duration of exposure to RFR may increase the effects on performance. Right-handed subjects exposed to RFR on the left side of their head on average had significantly longer response times when compared to exposure to the right side and sham-exposure.<!--What were these effects? Please be specific.--><ref>{{cite journal |pages=198–204 |doi=10.1002/bem.20458 |title=Cognitive effects of radiation emitted by cellular phones: The influence of exposure side and time |year=2009 |last1=Luria |first1=Roy |last2=Eliyahu |first2=Ilan |last3=Hareuveny |first3=Ronen |last4=Margaliot |first4=Menachem |last5=Meiran |first5=Nachshon |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=30 |issue=3 |pmid=19194860}}

====Electromagnetic hypersensitivity====
{{Main|Electromagnetic hypersensitivity}}
Some users of mobile handsets have reported feeling several unspecific [[symptom]]s during and after its use; ranging from burning and [[tingling sensation]]s in the skin of the head and extremities, [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], sleep disturbances, [[dizziness]], loss of mental [[attention]], [[reaction time]]s and [[memory]] retentiveness, [[headache]]s, [[malaise]], [[tachycardia]] ([[heart]] palpitations), to disturbances of the [[digestive system]]. Reports have noted that all of these symptoms can also be attributed to [[stress (biological)|stress]] and that current research cannot separate the symptoms from [[nocebo]] effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Röösli|first1= Martin|year= 2008|month= June|title= Radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure and non-specific symptoms of ill health: A systematic review|journal= [[Environmental Research]]|volume= 107|issue= 2|pages= 277–287|doi= 10.1016/j.envres.2008.02.003|pmid= 18359015}}</ref>

====Genotoxic effects====
A meta-analysis (2008) of 63 [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]] studies from the years 1990–2005 concluded that RF radiation was genotoxic only in some conditions and that the studies reporting positive effects evidenced [[publication bias]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vijayalaxmi  ''et al.'' | year = 2008 | title = Genetic Damage in Mammalian Somatic Cells Exposed to Radiofrequency Radiation: A Meta-analysis of Data from 63 Publications (1990–2005) | url = http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1667%2FRR0987.1 | journal = Radiation Research | volume = 169 | issue = 5| pages = 561–574 }}</ref>

A meta-study (2009) of 101 publications on genotoxicity of RF electromagnetic fields showed that 49 reported a genotoxic effect and 42 not. The authors found "ample evidence that RF-EMF can alter the genetic material of exposed cells in vivo and in vitro and in more than one way".<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Ruediger| first = HW| authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | year = 2009| month = August| title = Genotoxic effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields| journal = Pathophysiology| volume = 16| issue = 2–3| pages = 67–69| publisher = Elsevier| location = | issn = | doi = 10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.02.002| bibcode = | oclc = | id = |label= | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0928468009000169| format = | accessdate = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = | pmid = 19264462 }}</ref>

In 1995, in the journal ''Bioelectromagnetics'', Henry Lai and Narenda P. Singh reported damaged DNA after two hours of microwave radiation at levels deemed safe according to U.S. government standards.<ref>

In December 2004, a pan-[[Europe]]an study named REFLEX (Risk Evaluation of Potential Environmental Hazards from Low Energy Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Exposure Using Sensitive in vitro Methods), involving 12 collaborating laboratories in several countries showed some compelling evidence of DNA damage of cells in in-vitro cultures, when exposed between 0.3 to 2 watts/kg, whole-sample average. There were indications, but not rigorous evidence of other cell changes, including damage to [[chromosome]]s, alterations in the activity of certain [[gene]]s and a boosted rate of [[cell division]].<ref>{{Cite book | year = 2004| title = REFLEX - Risk Evaluation of Potential Environmental Hazards From Low Frequency Electromagnetic Field Exposure Using Sensitive in vitro Methods| place = [[Munich]]| publisher = VERUM Stiftung für Verhalten und Umwelt | id = | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = http://www.verum-foundation.de/eu-projekte/reflex.html | accessdate =2011-05-25}}</ref>

Research published in 2004 by a team at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]] had a reduction in reproductive capacity in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] exposed to 6 minutes of 900&nbsp;MHz pulsed radiation for five days.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Panagopoulos| first = DJ| authorlink = | coauthors = Karabarbounis, A; Margaritis, LH| date = 2004-12-01| year = | month = | title = Effect of GSM 900 MHz mobile phone radiation on the reproductive capacity of Drosophila melanogaster| journal = Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine| volume = 23| issue = 1| pages = 29–43| publisher = Taylor & Francis| location = [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]| issn = 1536-8378| doi = 10.1081/JBC-120039350| bibcode = | oclc = 87856304 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713628995| format = | accessdate = 2008-01-15| laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}</ref>

Subsequent research, again conducted on fruit flies, was published in 2007, with the same exposure pattern but conducted at both 900&nbsp;MHz and 1800&nbsp;MHz, and had similar changes in reproductive capacity with no significant difference between the two frequencies.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Panagopoulos| first = DJ| authorlink = | coauthors = Chavdoula, ED; Karabarbounis, A; Margaritis, LH| date = January 1, 2007| year = | month = | title = Comparison of bioactivity between GSM 900&nbsp;MHz and DCS 1800&nbsp;MHz Mobile Telephony Radiation | journal = Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine| volume = 26| issue = 1| pages = 33–44| publisher = Informa Healthcare| location = [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]| issn = 1536-8378| pmid = 17454081| doi = 10.1080/15368370701205644| bibcode = | oclc = 47815878| DUPLICATE DATA: doi = {{|10.1080/15368370701205644|label= <nowiki>10.1080/15368370701205644</nowiki>}}| url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a777389376| format = | accessdate = 2008-01-14| laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}</ref>

Following additional tests published in a third article, the authors stated they thought their research suggested the changes were “…due to degeneration of large numbers of egg chambers after DNA fragmentation of their constituent cells …”.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Panagopoulos| first = DJ| authorlink = | coauthors = Chavdoula, ED; Nezis, IP; Margaritis, LH| date = January 10, 2007| year = | month = | title = Cell death induced by GSM 900 MHz and DCS 1800 MHz mobile telephony radiation| journal = Mutation Research| volume = 626| issue = 1–2| pages = 69–78| publisher = Elsevier| location = [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]| issn = 0027-5107| pmid = 17045516| doi = 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2006.08.008| bibcode = | oclc = 109920000| id = | url = http://pmid.us/17045516| format = | accessdate = 2008-01-15| laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = Our present results suggest that the decrease in oviposition previously reported, is due to degeneration of large numbers of egg chambers after DNA fragmentation of their constituent cells, induced by both types of mobile telephony radiation.

Australian research conducted in 2009 by subjecting [[in vitro]] samples of human [[spermatozoa]] to radio-frequency radiation at 1.8&nbsp;GHz and [[specific absorption rate]]s (SAR) of 0.4 to 27.5 W/kg showed a correlation between increasing SAR and decreased [[motility]] and [[vitality]] in sperm, increased [[oxidative stress]] and [[8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine]] markers, stimulating [[DNA]] base adduct formation and increased [[DNA fragmentation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=De Iuliis|first=Geoffry N.|coauthors=Rhiannon J.

==Health hazards of base stations==
[[Image:Cellphone aerial mast.jpg|right|thumb|A Greenfield-type tower used in base stations for mobile telephony]]
Another area of concern is the radiation emitted by the fixed infrastructure used in mobile telephony, such as [[cell site|base station]]s and their antennas, which provide the link to and from mobile phones. This is because, in contrast to mobile handsets, it is emitted continuously and is more powerful at close quarters. On the other hand, field intensities drop rapidly with distance away from the base of transmitters because of the [[inverse-square law|attenuation of power with the square of distance]].

One popular design of mobile phone antenna is the [[sector antenna]], whose coverage is 120 degrees horizontally and about +-5 degrees from the vertical.

Because base stations operate at less than 100 watts, the radiation at ground level is much weaker than a cell phone due to the power relationship appropriate for that design of antenna. Base station emissions must comply with safety guidelines (see ''Safety standards and licensing'' below). Some countries however (such as [[South Africa]] for example) have no health regulations governing the placement of base stations.

Several surveys have found a variety of [[self-report study|self-reported]] symptoms for people who live close to base stations.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Santini| first = R| authorlink = | coauthors = Santini, P; Danze, JM; LeRuz, P; Seigne, M| date = | year = 2003| month = January| title = Survey Study of People Living in the Vicinity of Cellular Phone Base Stations| journal = Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine| volume = 22| issue = 1| pages = 41–49| publisher = Informa Healthcare| location = [[London]]| doi = 10.1081/JBC-120020353| bibcode = | oclc = 88891277| id = | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713628949| accessdate = 2008-02-09| laysummary = | quote = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Navarro | first = Enrique A| authorlink = | coauthors = Segura, J; Portolés, M; Gómez-Perretta de Mateo, Claudio| date = | year = 2003| month = December| title = The Microwave Syndrome: A Preliminary Study in Spain| journal = Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine| volume = 22| issue = 2| pages = 161–169| publisher = Informa Healthcare| location = [[London]]| doi = 10.1081/JBC-120024625| bibcode = | oclc = 89106315| id = | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713628989| accessdate = 2008-02-09| laysummary = | quote = }}<BR>{{cite book |title= Biological effects of EMFs : Proceedings, Kos, Greece, 4–8 October 2004, 3rd International Workshop | chapter = The Microwave Syndrome: Further Aspects of a Spanish Study| chapterurl = http://www.mindfully.org/Technology/2004/Microwave-Syndrome-Oberfeld1may04.htm|last= Oberfeld |first= Gerd|authorlink= |coauthors= Navarro, Enrique A; Portoles, Manuel; Maestu, Ceferino; Gomez-Perretta, Claudio |editor= Kostarakis, P|year= 2004|publisher= Electronics, Telecom & Applications Laboratory, Physics Dept., University of Ioannina : Institute of Informatics & Telecommunications, N.C.S.R. “Demokritos”|location= [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]]|isbn= 960-233-152-6 | url = |pages= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Abdel-Rassoul| first = G| authorlink = | coauthors = Abou El-Fateh, O; Abou Salem, M; Michael, A; Farahat, F; El-Batanouny, M; Salem, E| date = | year = 2007| month = March| title = Neurobehavioral effects among inhabitants around mobile phone base stations| journal = NeuroToxicology| volume = 28| issue = 2| pages = 434–40| publisher = Elsevier Science| location = [[New York City|New York]], [[New York|NY]]| pmid = 16962663| doi = 10.1016/j.neuro.2006.07.012| bibcode = | oclc = 138574974| id = | url = http://folketsvilja.host.twinspot.net/files/resourcesmodule/@random4444437328492/1162496959_Abdel_Rassoul2006.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2008-02-10| laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Bortkiewicz| first = A| authorlink = | coauthors = Zmyślony, M; Szyjkowska, A; Gadzicka, E| date = | year = 2004| month = | title = Subjective symptoms reported by people living in the vicinity of cellular phone base stations: review| journal = Medycyna pracy| volume = 55| issue = 4| pages = 345–352| publisher = Państwowy Zakład Wydawnictw Lekarskich| location = [[Warsaw]]| issn = 0465-5893| pmid = 15620045| doi = | bibcode = | oclc = 108011911| id = BL Shelfmark: 5536.020000 | language = Polish| format = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Hutter| first = H-P| authorlink = | coauthors = H Moshammer, P Wallner, M Kundi| date = May 1, 2006| title = Subjective symptoms, sleeping problems, and cognitive performance in subjects living near mobile phone base stations| journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine| volume = 63| issue = 5| pages = 307–313| publisher = the BMJ Publishing Group| location = [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]| pmid = 16621850| doi = 10.1136/oem.2005.020784| bibcode = | oclc = 41236398| id = | url = http://oem.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/63/5/307| format = | accessdate = 2008-01-07| laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = | pmc = 2092490 }}</ref> However, there are significant challenges in conducting studies of populations near base stations, especially in assessment of individual exposure.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Neubauer  ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Feasibility of future epidemiological studies on possible health effects of mobile phone base stations | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/113448948/ABSTRACT | journal = Bioelectromagnetics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 224–230 }}</ref> Self-report studies can also be vulnerable to the [[nocebo effect]].

==Occupational health hazards==
Telecommunication workers who spend time at a short distance from the active equipment, for the purposes of testing, maintenance, installation, etcetera, may be at risk of much greater exposure than the general population. Many times base stations are not turned off during maintenance, but the power being sent through to the antennas is cut off, so that the workers do not have to work near live antennas.

A variety of studies over the past 50 years have been done on workers exposed to high [[Radio frequency|RF]] radiation levels; studies including [[radar]] laboratory workers, military radar workers, electrical workers, and amateur radio operators. Most of these studies found no increase in cancer rates over the general population or a control group. Many positive results could have been attributed to other work environment conditions, and many negative results (reduced cancer rates) also occurred.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Moulder| first = JE| authorlink = | coauthors = Erdreich, LS; Malyapa, RS; Merritt, J; Pickard, WF; Vijayalaxmi| date = | year = 1999| month = May| title = Cell phones and cancer: what is the evidence for a connection?| journal = Radiation Research| volume = 151| issue = 5| pages = 513–531| publisher = [[Academic Press]]| location = [[New York City|New York]]| issn = 0033-7587| pmid = 10319725| doi = 10.2307/3580028| bibcode = | oclc = 119963820| id = | url = http://www.pmid.us/10319725| language = | format = | accessdate = 2008-02-10| laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = | jstor = 3580028 }}</ref>

==Safety standards and licensing==
In order to protect the population living around base stations and users of mobile handsets, governments and regulatory bodies adopt safety standards, which translate to limits on exposure levels below a certain value. There are many proposed national and international standards, but that of the [[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]] (ICNIRP) is the most respected one, and has been adopted so far by more than 80 countries. For radio stations, ICNIRP proposes two safety levels: one for occupational exposure, another one for the general population. Currently there are efforts underway to harmonise the different standards in existence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icnirp.de |title=International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection home page|accessdate=2008-01-07 |format= |work= }}</ref>

Radio base licensing procedures have been established in the majority of urban spaces regulated either at municipal/county, provincial/state or national level. Mobile telephone service providers are, in many regions, required to obtain construction licenses, provide certification of antenna emission levels and assure compliance to ICNIRP standards and/or to other environmental legislation.

Many governmental bodies also require that competing telecommunication companies try to achieve sharing of towers so as to decrease environmental and cosmetic impact. This issue is an influential factor of rejection of installation of new antennas and towers in communities.

The safety standards in the U.S. are set by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). The FCC has based its standards primarily on those standards established by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), specifically Subcommittee 4 of the "International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety".

Switzerland has set safety limits lower than the ICNIRP limits for certain "sensitive areas" (classrooms, for example).<ref>{{cite web|title= Anforderungen nach NISV: Mobilfunkanlagen|trans_title= Specifications of the Regulation on Non-Ionizing Radiation: Mobile Telephone Installations|url= http://www.bafu.admin.ch/elektrosmog/01100/01105/index.html?lang=de |publisher= Bundesamt für Umwelt <nowiki>[</nowiki>Swiss Federal Environment Ministry<nowiki>]</nowiki>|language= German|date= 2009-03-13|accessdate= 2010-01-20}}</ref>

On 1 September 2012, [[India]] set electromagnetic frequency exposure limit for all [[Base station subsystem|mobile phone base stations]] to one tenth of the existing ICNIRP exposure level. Telecom Enforcement Resource & Monitoring (TERM) cells will audit the self-certification provided by the mobile network operators.<ref>http://telecomtalk.info/india-implement-stricter-norms-mobile-phone-tower-radiation-today/99220/#more-99220</ref>

==Lawsuits==
In the [[USA]], a small number of [[personal injury]] [[lawsuits]] have been filed by individuals against cellphone manufacturers, such as [[Motorola]],<ref>[http://infoventures.com/emf/legal/lt-il001.html Wright v. Motorola, Inc. et al., No95-L-04929]</ref> [[NEC Corporation|NEC]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Nokia]], on the basis of allegations of causation of [[brain cancer]] and death. In US federal court, expert testimony relating to science must be first evaluated by a judge, in a [[Daubert standard|Daubert hearing]], to be relevant and valid before it is admissible as evidence. In one case against Motorola, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of wireless handheld telephones could cause brain cancer, and that the use of Motorola phones caused one plaintiff’s cancer. The judge ruled that no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation was proffered by the plaintiffs; accepted a motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs’ experts; and denied a motion to exclude the testimony of the defendants' experts.<ref>{{cite court |litigants= Christopher Newman, et al. v Motorola, Inc., et al. |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court= United States District Court for the District of Maryland |date= |url= http://news.lp.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/cellphone/newmanmotorola93002mem.pdf |format=PDF|quote= Because no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation has been proffered by the plaintiffs, as explained below, the defendants’ motion will be granted and the plaintiffs’ motion will be denied. }}</ref>

===French High Court ruling against telecom company===
In February 2009 the telecom company [[Bouygues Telecom]] was ordered to take down a [[mobile phone mast]] due to uncertainty about its effect on health. Residents in the commune [[Charbonnières-les-Bains|Charbonnières]] in the [[Rhône (department)|Rhône]] department had sued the company claiming adverse health effects from the radiation emitted by the 19 meter tall antenna.<ref>{{cite news |first= Stine |last= Barstad |title= Kunne ikke bevise at strålingen var ufarlig |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2931903.ece |work= [[Aftenposten]] |language=Norwegian |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=25 May 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h1rbHhvs |archivedate=25 May 2009}}</ref> The milestone ruling by the [[Versailles Court of Appeal]] reversed the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] which is usual in such cases by emphasizing the extreme divergence between different countries in assessing safe limits for such radiation. The court stated that, "Considering that, while the reality of the risk remains hypothetical, it becomes clear from reading the contributions and scientific publications produced in debate and the divergent legislative positions taken in various countries, that uncertainty over the harmlessness of exposure to the waves emitted by relay antennas persists and can be considered serious and reasonable".<ref>{{cite court |litigants= Residents living next to a phone mast vs. the mobile phone company Bouygues Telecom |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court= Versailles Court of Appeal |date= 4 February 2009 |url= http://www.next-up.org/pdf/France_Versailles_Court_Of_Appeal_Judgement_Local_Living_Phone_Masts_Against_Compagny_Bouygues_Telecom_04_02_2009.pdf |quote=}}

===Italian High Court ruling in favour of causal link with brain cancer  ===
In October 2012 Italian high court ([[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Corte suprema di cassazione]]) granted an Italian businessman, ''Innocente Marcoloni'' a pension for occupational disease, as they found a causal link to mobile phones and cordless phones, that the businessman had used for six hours a day during twelve years. As it takes time to develop cancer, the court disregarded short-term studies.<ref>http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4597109/Mobiles-can-give-you-a-tumour-court-rules.html</ref> The court also disegarded studies that were even partially funded by the mobile phone industry such as the INTERPHONE (see above).<ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/19/italy-phones-idUSL5E8LJFFW20121019</ref><ref>http://www.prlog.org/12004383-italian-supreme-court-rules-cell-phones-can-cause-cancer.html</ref>

===Indian citizens against telecom company===
A case was also filed against the mobile towers in residential areas, schools and hospitals in 2012.<ref>http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-20/delhi/32763307_1_phone-towers-mobile-phone-cell-phone</ref>

==Precaution==

===Precautionary principle===
In 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommended that the [[precautionary principle]] could be voluntarily adopted in this case.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/docstore/peh-emf/publications/facts_press/EMF-Precaution.htm|title= Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health - Cautionary Policies|accessdate=2008-02-01|year= 2000|month= March|work= World Health Organization Backgrounder|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> It follows the recommendations of the [[European Community]] for environmental risks. According to the WHO, the "precautionary principle" is "a risk management policy applied in circumstances with a high degree of scientific uncertainty, reflecting the need to take action for a potentially serious risk without awaiting the results of scientific research." Other less stringent recommended approaches are [[prudent avoidance principle]] and [[as low as reasonably practicable]]. Although all of these are problematic in application, due to the widespread use and economic importance of wireless telecommunication systems in modern civilization, there is an increased popularity of such measures in the general public, though also evidence that such approaches may increase concern.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wiedemann  ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = The Impacts of Precautionary Measures and the Disclosure of Scientific Uncertainty on EMF Risk Perception and Trust | url = http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/openurl.asp?genre=article&doi=10.1080/13669870600802111 | journal = Journal of Risk Research | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 361–372 }}</ref> They involve recommendations such as the minimization of cellphone usage, the limitation of use by at-risk population (such as children), the adoption of cellphones and microcells with as low as reasonably practicable levels of radiation, the wider use of hands-free and [[earphone]] technologies such as [[Bluetooth]] headsets, the adoption of maximal standards of exposure, RF field intensity and distance of base stations antennas from human habitations, and so forth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Precautionary measures and health advisories===
In May 2011, the [http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer] announced it was classifying electromagnetic fields from mobile phones and other sources as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" and advised the public to adopt safety measures to reduce exposure, like use of hands-free devices or texting.

Examples of the recommendations are:

* Use hands-free to decrease the radiation to the head.
* Keep the mobile phone away from the body.
* Do not use telephone in a car without an external antenna.
* Use mobile radiation tracking apps have been developed to help to mitigate exposure<ref>http://business.financialpost.com/2012/08/15/as-debate-over-cellphone-safety-rages-on-tawkon-app-alerts-users-on-radition-levels/</ref>

The use of "hands-free" was not recommended by the British Consumers' Association in a statement in November 2000 as they believed that exposure was increased.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/02/london.phone/index.html|title= UK consumer group: Hands-free phone kits boost radiation exposure|accessdate=2008-01-19|date= 2000-11-02|work= cnn.com|publisher= [[CNN|Cable News Network]]}}</ref> However, measurements for the (then) UK Department of Trade and Industry<ref>Manning, MI and Gabriel, CHB, SAR tests on mobile phones used with and without personal hands-free kits, SARtest Report 0083 for the DTI, July 2000 (PDF) at http://straff-x.com/SAR-Hands-Free-Kits-July-2000.pdf</ref> and others for the French l’Agence française de sécurité sanitaire environnementale<ref>Téléphonie mobile & santé, Report for l"Agence française de sécurité sanitaire environnementale (Afsse), June 2005 at http://www.afsse.fr/index.php?pageid=671&parentid=619#</ref> showed substantial reductions. In 2005 Professor Lawrie Challis and others said clipping a [[ferrite bead]] onto hands-free kits stops the radio waves travelling up the wire and into the head.<ref>{{cite news |title= Bead 'slashes mobile radiation'|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4203077.stm|publisher= [[BBC News]]|date= 2005-01-25|accessdate= 2009-03-17}}</ref>

Several nations have advised moderate use of mobile phones for children.<ref>For example, Finland {{cite web|url= http://www.stuk.fi/stuk/tiedotteet/en_GB/news_527/ |title= Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority: Children's mobile phone use should be limited|publisher= Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK)|date= 2009-01-07|accessdate= 2010-01-20}} and France {{cite web|url= http://www.sante-sports.gouv.fr/IMG//pdf/AFOM_-_Fiche_4_-_telephone_mobile_DAS_et_sante.pdf |format= PDF|title= Téléphone mobile, DAS et santé|trans_title= Mobile telephones, SAR and health|work= Votre enfant et le téléphone mobile <nowiki>[</nowiki>Your child and mobile telephony<nowiki>]</nowiki>|publisher= Association Française des Opérateurs Mobiles (AFOM)<nowiki>[</nowiki>French Mobile Phone Operators' Association<nowiki>]</nowiki> et l’Union Nationale des Associations Familiales (UNAF) <nowiki>[</nowiki>National Federation of Family Associations<nowiki>]</nowiki>|date= 2007-01-31|accessdate= 2010-01-20}}</ref>
