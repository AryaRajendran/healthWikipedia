'''Economic epidemiology''' is a field at the intersection of [[epidemiology]] and [[economics]]. Its premise is to incorporate incentives for healthy behavior and their attendant behavioral responses into an epidemiological context to better understand how diseases are transmitted. This framework should help improve policy responses to [[epidemic]] diseases by giving policymakers and health-care providers clear tools for thinking about how certain actions can influence the spread of [[Transmission (disease)|disease transmission]]. 

The main context through which this field emerged was the idea of prevalence-dependence, or [[disinhibition]], which suggests that individuals change their behavior as the prevalence of a disease changes. However, economic epidemiology also encompasses other ideas, including the role of externalities, global disease commons and how individuals’ incentives can influence the outcome and cost of health interventions. 

'''Strategic epidemiology''' is a branch of economic epidemiology that adopts an explicitly [[Game theory|game theoretic]] approach to analyzing the interplay between individual behavior and population wide disease dynamics.

==Prevalence-dependence ==
The spread of an [[infectious disease]] is a population-level phenomenon, but decisions to prevent or treat a disease are typically made by individuals who may change their behavior over the course of an epidemic, especially if their [[Risk perception|perception of risk]] changes depending on the available information on the epidemics<ref>{{cite journal | author=d'Onofrio A, Manfredi P  | title=Information-related changes in contact patterns may trigger oscillations in the endemic prevalence of infectious diseases | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=2010 | volume=256 | pages=473–478 | pmid=18992258 | issue=3 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.10.005}}</ref>  – their decisions will then have population-level consequences. For example, an individual may choose to have [[Safe sex|unsafe sex]] or a doctor may prescribe antibiotics to someone without a confirmed [[Infection|bacterial infection]]. In both cases, the choice may be rational from the individual’s point of view but undesirable from a societal perspective.

Limiting the spread of a disease at the population level requires changing individual behavior, which in turn depends on what information individuals have about the level of risk. When risk is low, people will tend to ignore it. However, if the risk of infection is higher, individuals are more likely to take preventive action. Moreover, the more transmissible the [[pathogen]], the greater the incentive is to make personal investments for control.<ref name="Peltzman S 1975 677–726">{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/260352 |author=Peltzman S |title=The effects of automobile safety regulation |journal=Political Economy |volume=83 |pages=677–726 |year=1975}}</ref>

The converse is also true: if there is a lowered risk of disease, either through vaccination or because of lowered prevalence, individuals may increase their risk-taking behavior. This effect is analogous to the introduction of safety regulations, such as seatbelts in cars, which because they reduce the cost of an accident in terms of expected injury and death, could lead people to drive with less caution and the resulting injuries to nonoccupants and increased nonfatal crashes may offset some of the gains from the use of seatbelts.<ref name="Peltzman S 1975 677–726"/>

Prevalence-dependent behavior introduces a crucial difference with respect to the way individuals respond when the prevalence of a disease increases. If behavior is exogenous or if behavioral responses are assumed to be inelastic with respect to [[Prevalence|disease prevalence]], the per capita risk of infection in the susceptible population increases as prevalence increases. In contrast, when behavior is endogenous and elastic, hosts can act to reduce their risks. If their responses are strong enough, they can reduce the average per capita risk and offset the increases in the risk of transmission associated with higher prevalence.<ref name="BM1994">{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.8073289 | author=Blower SM, McLean AR | title=Prophylactic vaccines, risk behavior change, and the probability of eradicating HIV in San Francisco | journal=Science | year=1994 | volume=265 | pages=1451–1454 | pmid=8073289 | issue=5177}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Blythe SP, Cooke KL, Castillo-Chavez C | title=Autonomous risk-behavior change, and non-linear incidence rate, in models of sexually transmitted diseases | journal=Biometrics Unit Technical Report B-1048-M | year=1991}}</ref><ref name="PP1993">{{cite book | last = Philipson | first = TJ  | coauthors = Posner, RA  | year = 1993 | title = Private Choices and Public Health: The AIDS Epidemic in an Economic Perspective | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA }}</ref><ref name="klein2007">{{cite journal | author=Klein E, Laxminarayan R, Smith DL, Gilligan CA | title=Economic incentives and mathematical models of disease | journal=Environment and Development Economics | year=2007 | volume=12 | pages=707–732}}</ref> 

Alternatively, the waning of perceived risk, either through the diminution of prevalence or the introduction of a vaccine, may lead to increases in risky behavior. For example, models suggested that the introduction of [[Antiretroviral drug|highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)]], which significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with [[HIV]]/AIDS, may lead to increases in the incidence of HIV as the perceived risk of HIV/AIDS decreased.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.650 | author=Blower SM, Gershengorn HB, Grant RM | title=A tale of two futures: HIV and antiretroviral therapy in San Francisco | journal=Science | year=2000 | volume=287 | pages=650–654 | pmid=10649998 | issue=5453}}</ref>

Recent analysis suggests that an individual’s likelihood of engaging in [[unprotected sex]] is related to their personal analysis of risk, with those who believed that receiving HAART or having an undetectable [[viral load]] protects against transmitting HIV or who had reduced concerns about engaging in unsafe sex given the availability of HAART were more likely to engage in unprotected sex regardless of HIV status.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Crepaz N, Hart T, Marks, G | title=Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy and Sexual Risk Behavior: A Meta-analytic Review | journal=JAMA | year=2004 | volume=292 | issue=2 | pages=224–236 | pmid= 15249572 | doi= 10.1001/jama.292.2.224}}</ref>

This behavioral response can have important implications for the timing of public interventions, because prevalence and public subsidies may compete to induce protective behavior.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2527443 | author=Geoffard PY, Philipson T | title=Rational epidemics and their public control | journal=International Economic Review | year=1996 | volume=37 | issue=3 | pages=603–624 | jstor=2527443}}</ref> In other words, if prevalence induces the same sort of protective behavior as public subsidies, the subsidies become irrelevant because people will choose to protect themselves when prevalence is high, regardless of the subsidy, and subsidies may not be helpful at the times when they are typically applied. 

Although [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]] are logical targets for examining the role of [[human behavior]] in a modeling framework, personal actions are important for other infectious diseases as well. The rapidity with which individuals reduce their contact rate with others during an outbreak of a highly transmissible disease can significantly affect the spread of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Del Valle S, Hethcote H, Hyman JM, Castillo-Chavez C | title=Effects of behavioral changes in a smallpox attack model | journal=Mathematical Biosciences | year=2005 | volume=195 | pages=228–251 | pmid=15913667 | issue=2 | doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2005.03.006}}</ref> Even small reductions in the contact rate can be important, especially for diseases like [[influenza]] or [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome| severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)]]. However, this may also have an impact on policy planning for a biological attack with a disease such as [[smallpox]]. 

Individual behavioral responses to interventions for non-sexually transmitted diseases are also important. For example, mass spraying to reduce [[malaria]] transmission can reduce the irritating effects of biting by nuisance mosquitoes and so lead to reduced personal use of bednets.<ref name="klein2007" /> Economic epidemiology strives to incorporate these types of behavior responses into epidemiological models to enhance a model’s utility in evaluating control measures.

==Vaccination==
Immunization represents a classic case of a social dilemma: a [[conflict of interest]] between the private gains of individuals and the collective gains of a society, and prevalence-dependent behavior may have significant impacts on [[vaccine]] policy formation. For instance, it was found in an analysis of the hypothetical introduction of a vaccine that would reduce (though not eliminate) the risk of contracting HIV, that individual levels of risk behavior were a significant barrier to eliminating HIV, as small changes in behavior could actually increase the incidence/prevalence of HIV, even if the vaccine were highly efficacious.<ref name="BM1994" /> These results, as well as others,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Anderson R, Hanson M | title=Potential public health impact of imperfect HIV type 1 vaccines | journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases | year=2005 | volume=191 | pages=S85–S96 | pmid=15627235 | doi=10.1086/425267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.2174/1568005033480999 | author=Blower SM, Ma L, Farmer P, Koenig S | title=Predicting the impact of antiretrovirals in resource-poor settings: preventing HIV infections whilst controlling drug resistance | journal=Current Drug Targets.

An individual's self-interest and choice often leads to a vaccination uptake rate less than the social optimum as individuals do not take into account the benefit to others. In addition, prevalence dependent behavior suggests how the introduction of a vaccine may affect the spread of a disease. As the prevalence of a disease increases, people will demand to be vaccinated. As prevalence decreases, however, the incentive, and thus demand, will slacken and allow the susceptible population to increase until the disease can reinvade. As long as a vaccine is not free, either monetarily or through true or even perceived [[side effect]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bauch CT, Earn DJD | title=Vaccination and the theory of games | journal=PNAS | year=2004 | volume=101 | pages=13391–13394 | pmid=15329411 | issue=36 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0403823101 | pmc=516577}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=d'Onofrio A, Manfredi P  | title=Vaccine demand driven by vaccine side effects: Dynamic implications for SIR diseases | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=2010 | volume=264 | pages=237–252 | pmid=20149801 | issue=2 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.02.007}}</ref> demand will be insufficient to pay for the vaccine at some point, leaving some people unvaccinated. If the disease is contagious, it could then begin spreading again among non-vaccinated individuals. Thus, it is impossible to eradicate a vaccine-preventable disease through voluntary vaccination if people act in their own self-interest.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Geoffard PY, Philipson T | title=Disease eradication: private versus public vaccination | journal= | year=American Economic Review | volume=87 | issue= | pages=222–230}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.601 | author=May SR | title=Simple rules with complex dynamics’ | journal=Science | year=2000 | volume=287 | issue= 5453| pages=601–602 | pmid=10691541}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Bauch CT, Galvani AP, Earn DJD | title=Group interest versus self-interest in smallpox vaccination policy | journal=PNAS | year=2004 | volume=100 | pages=10564–10567 | pmid=12920181 | issue=18 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1731324100 | pmc=193525}}</ref>
