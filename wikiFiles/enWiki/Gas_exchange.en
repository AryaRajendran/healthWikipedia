Gas exchange is a biological process through which (usually two) different gases are transferred in opposite directions across a specialised '''respiratory surface'''. Gases are constantly required and produced as a by-product of [[Metabolism| cellular and metabolic reactions]] so an efficient system for their exchange is extremely important. It is linked with [[respiration]] in animals, and both respiration and [[photosynthesis]] in plants. <ref name="rsc"> {{Cite web| title = Gas exchange| url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/gas.htm| accessdate= 19 March 2013}} </ref>

In respiration oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is required to enter cells whilst waste carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) must be removed – the opposite is true for photosynthesis where CO<sub>2</sub> enters plants and O<sub>2</sub> is released. <ref name="rsc"/>  The exchange of gases essentially occurs as a result of '''diffusion''' down a concentration gradient – gas molecules moving from an area of high concentration &rarr; low concentration. 

==Diffusion==

[[Molecular diffusion| Diffusion]] follows [[Fick's laws of diffusion| Fick’s Law]]. It is a passive process (doesn’t require energy) affected by factors such as:

* The '''surface area''' available
* The '''distance''' the gas molecules must diffuse across
* The '''concentration gradient'''

Gases must first dissolve in a fluid in order to diffuse across a [[membrane]] therefore all gas exchange systems require a moist environment.

</ref>

In single-celled organisms diffusion can occur straight across the cell membrane; as organisms increase in size so does the distance gases must travel across. Their [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]] also ''decreases''. Diffusion alone is not efficient enough and specialised respiratory systems are required. This is the case with [[humans]] and [[fish]] where [[ circulatory system| circulatory systems]] have evolved: These are able to transport the gases to and from the respiratory surface and maintain a continuous concentration gradient.

==In humans==

[[File:Alveolus2.PNG|thumb|Gas exchange in humans - between a capillary and an alveolus| 375px]]

Both oxygen '''and''' carbon dioxide are transported around the body in the [[blood]] – through arteries, veins and [[capillary| capillaries]]. They bind to [[hemoglobin]] in red blood cells although this is more effective with oxygen. Carbon dioxide also dissolves in the [[blood plasma| plasma]] or combines with water to form bicarbonate ions (HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}}). This reaction is catalysed by the [[carbonic anhydrase]] [[enzyme]] in red blood cells:

The main respiratory surface in humans are the [[pulmonary alveolus| alveoli]]. <ref name="s-cool"> {{Cite web| title= Gas Exchange in humans| url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/biology/gas-exchange/revise-it/gas-exchange-in-humans| accessdate= 19 March 2013}} </ref> Alveoli are small air sacs branching off from the [[bronchioles]] in the [[lungs]]. They are one-cell thick and provide a moist and extremely large surface area for gas exchange to occur. Capillaries carrying [[venous blood| deoxygenated blood]] from the [[pulmonary artery]] run across the alveoli - they are also extremely thin so the total distance gases must diffuse across is only around 2-cells thick.

Inhaled oxygen is able to diffuse into the capillaries ''from'' the alveoli, while carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses in the opposite direction ''into'' the alveoli. The waste carbon dioxide can then be exhaled out of the body. Continuous blood flow in the capillaries as well as constant breathing maintains a steep concentration gradient.

===Varying response===

During [[physical exercise]] excess carbon dioxide is produced as a result of increased respiration: This must be removed and [[muscles]] and cells require increased oxygen. The body responds to this change by increasing the [[respiratory rate| breathing rate]], therefore maximising the rate of possible gas exchange.

==In plants==

Air diffuses directly into and out of plants through pores on the underside of [[leaf| leaves]] known as [[stomata]]. The stomata are controlled by [[guard cells]] (affected by [[osmosis]] and [[turgor pressure]]). When the guard cells are turgid stomata are open, when they are flaccid stomata close and gas exchange cannot take place. The main respiratory surface is the spongy mesophyll cells inside the leaf. They have large air spaces and therefore provide a large surface area for gas exchange. Leaves are also very thin so the diffusion distance is small.

{{Cite journal| authors= Casson S & Gray JE| title= Influence of environmental factors on stomatal development| journal =[[New Phytologist]]| volume=178| year=2008| pages=9-23}}
</ref>

During the day photosynthesis occurs at a faster rate than respiration so there is an overall uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> and release of O<sub>2</sub>. At night (when there is no light available) this is reversed as photosynthesis stops and only respiration can take place.

==In fish==

'''[[Fish]]''' must extract oxygen dissolved in water, not air, which has led to the evolution of [[gills]] and [[operculum (fish)| opercula]]. Gills are specialised organs containing filaments and [[lamella (anatomy)| lamellae]] – the lamellae contain capillaries and provide a large surface area and short diffusion distance as they are extremely thin.
<ref name="Newstead1967">
{{Cite journal| author=Newstead James D | title=Fine structure of the respiratory lamellae of teleostean gills| journal=[[Cell and Tissue Research]]| volume=79| year=1967| pages=396-428}}
</ref>

Water is drawn in through the mouth and passes over the gills in '''one''' direction while blood flows through the lamellae in the '''opposite''' direction – this [[countercurrent exchange| counter current]] maintains a steep concentration gradient. O<sub>2</sub> is able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood and CO<sub>2</sub> into the water.

==Other examples==

'''[[Insects]]''' such as crickets do not have an inner skeleton so exchange gases across structures known as '''trachea''' and [[tracheoles]]: These are tubes that run directly into the body of the insect. Air enters the trachea through valves known as [[spiracles]] and diffusion can then occur straight into the respiring tissues. <ref name="s-cool2"> {{Cite web| title= Gas Exchange in Insects| url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/biology/gas-exchange/revise-it/gas-exchange-in-insects| accessdate= 19 March 2013}} </ref> 

'''[[Amphibians]]''' are able to use their ''skin'' as a respiratory surface, as well as having lungs and sometimes gills.
