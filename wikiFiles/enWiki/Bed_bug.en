'''Bed bugs''' are [[parasite|parasitic]] insects of the [[Cimicidae|cimicid]] family that feed exclusively on [[blood]].  The term most commonly refers to members of the genus ''Cimex'' of which '''''Cimex lectularius''''', the common bed bug, is the best known as it prefers to feed on human blood although other ''Cimex'' species are specialized to other animals, e.g., bat bugs, ''C. pipistrelli'' (Europe), ''C. pilosellus'' (western US), and ''C. adjunctus'' (entire eastern US).<ref>Bat bugs are visually indistinguishable from bed bugs, and may also occasionally feed on human hosts.</ref>  

The name of the "bed bug" is derived from the preferred habitat of ''Cimex lectularius'': warm houses and especially nearby or inside of beds and bedding or other sleep areas. Bed bugs are mainly active at night, but are not exclusively [[nocturnal]].  They usually feed on their [[Host (biology)|host]]s without being noticed.<ref name=NEJM2009>{{cite journal|last=Goddard|first=J|coauthors=deShazo, R|title=Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) and clinical consequences of their bites|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=1 April 2009|volume=301|issue=13|pages=1358–66|pmid=19336711|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.405}}</ref><ref name=bioofbedbug /><ref name=bioofbedbug>{{Cite journal| last1 = Reinhardt| first1 = Klaus| last2 = Siva-Jothy| first2 = Michael T.| title = Biology of the Bed Bugs (Cimicidae)| journal = [[Annual Review of Entomology]]| volume = 52| pages = 351–374| month= Jan| pmid = 16968204| year=2007| url = http://www.falw.vu.nl/nl/Images/siva%202006_tcm19-30750.pdf |doi = 10.1146/annurev.ento.52.040306.133913 |accessdate = 26 May 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100705084911/http://www.falw.vu.nl/nl/Images/siva%202006_tcm19-30750.pdf| archivedate= 5 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=mednewstoday/>

A number of adverse health effects may result from bed bug bites, including [[skin rashes]], psychological effects, and [[allergy|allergic symptoms]]. Diagnosis involves both finding bed bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms.

==Description==

===Physical===
Adult bed bugs are light brown to reddish-brown, flattened, oval-shaped and have no hind wings. The front wings are [[vestigial]] and reduced to pad-like structures. Bed bugs have segmented abdomens with microscopic hairs that give them a banded appearance. Adults grow to 4–5&nbsp;mm in length and 1.5–3&nbsp;mm wide. 

Newly hatched [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] are translucent, lighter in color and become browner as they [[ecdysis|moult]] and reach [[sexual maturity|maturity]]. A bed bug of any age that has just consumed a blood meal will appear to have a bright red translucent abdomen; this color will fade to brown over the next several hours and within two days will become opaque and black as the insect digests its meal.  Bed bugs may be mistaken for other insects, such as [[booklice]], small cockroaches, or [[carpet beetles]], however when warm and active, their movements are more ant-like, and like most other [[true bugs]], they emit a characteristic disagreeable odor when crushed.

Bed bugs use [[pheromones]] and [[kairomones]] to communicate regarding nesting locations, feeding and reproduction.

The life span of bed bugs varies by species and is also dependent on feeding.

Bed bugs can survive a wide range of temperatures and atmospheric compositions. Below {{convert|16.1|C|F}}, adults enter semihibernation and can survive longer; they can survive for at least five days at {{convert|-10|C|F}}, but will die after 15 minutes of exposure to {{convert|-32|C|F}}.<ref name="birc.org">IPM Practitioner, XXIX(3/4), March/April 2007 http://www.birc.org/MarApril2007.pdf</ref> They show high [[desiccation tolerance]], surviving low humidity and a 35–40&nbsp;°C range even with loss of one-third of body weight; earlier life stages are more susceptible to drying out than later ones.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1 = Benoit | first1 = J.

Their [[insect bites and stings|bites]] are not usually noticed at the time.  They develop slowly to low itchy welts that may take weeks to go away.  They prefer exposed skin, preferably the face, neck and arms of a sleeping individual.  The neck and jaw line are particularly favored places to feed.

==== Bedbug feeding physiology ====
A bed bug pierces the skin of its host with what is called a stylet fascicle, [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], or "beak". This is a unit composed of the maxillae and mandibles, which have been modified into elongated shapes from a basic, ancestral style. The right and left maxillary stylets are connected at their midline and a section at the centerline forms a large food canal and a smaller salivary canal. The entire maxillary and mandibular bundle penetrates the skin.<ref name=mednewstoday>{{cite web |title = What Are Bed Bugs? How To Kill Bed Bugs |work = Medical News Today | publisher = MediLexicon International Ltd |date = 20 July 2009 |url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158065.php |accessdate = 27 May 2010 }}</ref>  

The tips of the right and left maxillary stylets are not the same; the right is hook-like and curved, and the left is straight. The right and left mandibular stylets extend along the outer sides of their respective maxillary stylets and do not reach anywhere near the tip of the fused maxillary stylets.  The stylets are retained in a groove in the labium, and during feeding, they are freed from the groove as the jointed labium is bent or folded out of the way; its tip never enters the wound.<ref name=mednewstoday>{{cite web |title = What Are Bed Bugs? How To Kill Bed Bugs |work = Medical News Today | publisher = MediLexicon International Ltd |date = 20 July 2009 |url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158065.php |accessdate = 27 May 2010 }}</ref>

The mandibular stylet tips have small teeth and through alternately moving these stylets back and forth, the insect cuts a path through tissue for the maxillary bundle to reach an appropriately sized blood vessel.  Pressure from the blood vessel itself fills the insect with blood in three to five minutes.  The bug then withdraws the stylet bundle from the feeding position and retracts it back into the labial groove, folds the entire unit back under the head, and returns to its hiding place.<ref name=mednewstoday>{{cite web |title = What Are Bed Bugs?

Bed bugs have six life stages (five immature nymph stages and a final sexually mature adult stage).<ref>[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98426/E91435.pdf] p. 136</ref> They will shed their skins through [[ecdysis]] at each stage, discarding their outer shells which are clear, empty exoskeletons of the bugs themselves. Bed bugs must molt six times before becoming fertile adults and must take a blood meal in order to complete each molt.<ref name="Shukla 2009 73">{{Cite book

Each of the immature stages lasts approximately a week, depending on temperature and the availability of food, and the complete life cycle can be completed in as little as two months (which is actually rather long compared to other ectoparasites— [[flea]]s, for example, can complete a cycle in as little as three weeks).  Fertilized females with enough food will lay three to four eggs each day continually until the end of their life spans (about nine months under warm conditions), possibly generating as many as 500 eggs in this time.<ref name="Shukla 2009 73"/>

===Detection===
[[File:Bedbugs1.jpg|thumb|Bed bug eggs and two adult bed bugs from inside a dresser.]]
Bed bugs are elusive and usually nocturnal (peak activity usually occurs around 5:00 or 6:00 a.m.), which can make noticing them difficult. They often lodge in dark crevices, and the tiny adhesive eggs can be nestled by the hundreds in fabric seams. Aside from bite symptoms, signs include fecal spots (small dark sand-like droppings that occur in patches around and especially beneath nests), blood smears on sheets (fecal spots that are re-wetted will smear like fresh blood), and the presence of their empty molted exoskeletons.

Although bed bugs can be found singly, they tend to congregate once established. Although they are strictly parasitic, they spend only a tiny fraction of their life cycles physically attached to their hosts.  Once feeding is complete, a bed bug will relocate to a place close to a known host, commonly in or near beds or couches in clusters of adults, juveniles, and eggs which entomologists call ''harborage areas'' or simply ''harborages'' to which the insect will return after future feedings by following chemical trails.  These places can vary greatly in format, including luggage, inside of vehicles, within furniture, amongst bedside clutter, even inside electrical sockets and nearby laptop computers. Bed bugs may also nest near animals that have nested within a dwelling, such as bats, birds,<ref name="avianadvice.uark.edu"/> or [[rodents]].

Bed bugs were mentioned in ancient Greece as early as 400 BC, and were later mentioned by [[Aristotle]]. [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny's ''Natural History'']], first published ''circa'' 77 AD in Rome, claimed bed bugs had medicinal value in treating ailments such as snake bites and ear infections. (Belief in the medicinal use of bed bugs persisted until at least the 18th century, when [[Guettard]] recommended their use in the treatment of [[hysteria]].<ref>William Smith and Charles Anthon, ''A dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities'', 1847, pp. 252–253 http://books.google.com/books?id=41oMAAAAYAAJ&dq=cimex&source=gbs_navlinks_s</ref>)

Some in the 18th century believed bed bugs had been brought to London with supplies of wood to rebuild the city after the [[Great Fire of London]] (1666). [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] noted their presence in [[Carniola]] (roughly equivalent to present-day Slovenia) in the 18th century.<ref>"That soon after the Fire of London, in some of the new-built Houses they were observ'd to appear, and were never noted to have been seen in the old, tho' they were then so few, as to be little taken notice of; yet as they were only seen in Firr-Timber, 'twas conjectured they were then first brought to ''England'' in them; of which most of the new Houses were partly built, instead of the good Oak destroy'd in the old."

Later, DDT was used to good effect as a safe alternative.<ref>http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA506261&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf#page=29</ref>

The decline of bed bug populations in the 20th century is often credited to potent [[pesticides]] that had not previously been widely available.<ref name=newsweek0910>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/08/conservatives-blame-environmentalists-for-bedbugs.html |author=[[Newsweek]]| title=The Politics of Bedbugs|date=8 September 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101021040754/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/08/conservatives-blame-environmentalists-for-bedbugs.html| archivedate= 21 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Other contributing factors that are less frequently mentioned in news reports are increased public awareness and slum clearance programs that combined pesticide use with steam disinfection, relocation of slum dwellers to new housing, and in some cases also follow-up inspections for several months after relocated tenants moved into their new housing.<ref name="Potter" />

==== Resurgence ====
Bed bug infestations have resurged in recent years for reasons which are not clear, but contributing factors may be complacency, increased resistance, bans on pesticides and increased international travel.<ref name=newsweek0910/> The U.S. [[National Pest Management Association]] reported a 71% increase in bed bug calls between 2000 and 2005.<ref name="voiland">{{cite journal |author=Voiland, Adam |title=You May not be Alone |journal=U.S. News & World Report |volume=143 |issue=2 |pages=53–54 |date=2007-07-16 |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/070708/16bedbug.htm}}</ref> The number of reported incidents in [[New York City]] alone rose from 500 in 2004 to 10,000 in 2009.<ref name=nytakeover>{{cite news | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/08/19/are-bedbugs-taking-over-new-york-city/| title=Are Bedbugs Taking Over New York City? | author=Megan Gibson | work=Time Magazine | date=2010-08-19}}</ref>

One recent theory about bed bug reappearance is that they never truly disappeared from the United States, but may have been forced to alternative hosts. Consistent with this is the finding that bed bug DNA shows no evidence of an [[evolutionary bottleneck]]. Furthermore, investigators have found high populations of bed bugs [[Poultry farming in the United States|at poultry facilities]] in [[Arkansas]]. Poultry workers at  these facilities may be spreading bed bugs, unknowingly carrying them to their places of residence and elsewhere after leaving work.<ref name="urban">{{cite web |last = Austin | first = James |title = Bed Bugs |work = Urban and Structural Pests |publisher = Center for Urban & Structural Entomology, Department of Entomology, [[Texas A&M]] |year = 2008 |url = http://urbanentomology.tamu.edu/bedbugs/bedbugs.cfm |accessdate = 31 May 2010 }}

==Society and culture==
The saying, "Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite", is common for parents to say to young children before they go to sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Berg |first=Rebecca |title=Bed Bugs: The Pesticide Dilemma |journal=[[Journal of Environmental Health]] |volume=72 |issue=10 |year=2010 |pages=32–35 |pmid=20556941 }}</ref>

===Etymology===
The word ''bug'' and its earlier spelling ''bugge'' means bedbug. Many other creatures are called bugs, such as the lady bug (ladybird outside North America), the potato bug, or the informal use of the word for any insect, or even for microscopic germs, or diseases caused by these germs, but the earliest recorded use of the actual word ''bug,'' was to mean bedbug.<ref name="etymonline">{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=bug&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Etymonline: bug (n.)|accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

The term bed bug may also be spelled ''bedbug'' or ''bed-bug'', though published sources consistently use the unhyphenated two-word name ''bed bug''. They have been known by a variety of other names, including wall louse, mahogany flat, crimson rambler, heavy dragoon, chinche bug, and redcoat.<ref name=miller/>
