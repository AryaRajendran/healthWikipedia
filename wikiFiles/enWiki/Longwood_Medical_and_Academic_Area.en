'''The Longwood Medical and Academic Area''' (also known as '''Longwood Medical Area''', '''LMA''', or simply '''Longwood''') is a medical campus in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].
Centered on Longwood Avenue as it runs from [[Huntington Avenue]] to The Riverway, LMA straddles the [[Fenway-Kenmore]] and [[Mission Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Mission Hill]] neighborhoods.
It is most strongly associated with the [[Harvard Medical School]] and other medical facilities such as Harvard's teaching hospitals,
but prominent non-Harvard and non-medical institutions are located there as well, such as museums, colleges and research centers.
