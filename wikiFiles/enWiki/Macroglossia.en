'''Macroglossia''' is the medical term for an unusually large tongue. Severe enlargement of the tongue can cause cosmetic and functional difficulties including in speaking, eating, swallowing and sleeping. Macroglossia is uncommon, and usually occurs in children. There are many causes. Treatment is dependent upon the exact cause

==Classification==
The [[ICD-10]] lists macroglossia under "other congenital malformations of the digestive system", since the oral cavity is part of the digestive tract. Definitions of macroglossia have been proposed, including "a tongue that protrudes beyond the teeth during <nowiki>[the]</nowiki> resting posture" and "if there is an impression of a tooth on the lingual border when the patients slightly open their mouths".<ref name="Prada 2011" /> Others have suggested there is no objective definition of what constitutes macroglossia.<ref name="Vogel 1986">{{cite journal|last=Vogel|first=JE|coauthors=Mulliken, JB; Kaban, LB|title=Macroglossia: a review of the condition and a new classification.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=1986 Dec|volume=78|issue=6|pages=715–23|pmid=2947254}}</ref> Some propose a distinction between ''true macroglossia'', when histologic abnormalities correlate with the clinical findings of tongue enlargement, and ''relative macroglossia'', where histology does not provide a pathologic explanation for the enlargement. Common examples of true macroglossia are vascular malformations, muscular enlargement and tumors, and Down syndrome is an example of relative macroglossia.<ref name="Vogel 1986" /> ''Pseudomacryglossia'' refers to a tongue that is of normal size but gives a false impression of being too large in relation to adjacent anatomical structures.<ref name="Topouzelis 2011">{{cite journal|last=Topouzelis|first=N|coauthors=Iliopoulos, C; Kolokitha, OE|title=Macroglossia.|journal=International dental journal|date=2011 Apr|volume=61|issue=2|pages=63–9|pmid=21554274}}</ref> The Myer classification subdivides macroglossia into generalized or localized.<ref name="Prada 2011">{{cite journal|last=Prada|first=CE|coauthors=Zarate, YA; Hopkin, RJ|title=Genetic causes of macroglossia: diagnostic approach.|journal=Pediatrics|date=2012 Feb|volume=129|issue=2|pages=e431-7|pmid=22250026}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Although it may be asymptomatic, symptoms usually are more likely to be present and more severe with larger tongue enlargements. Signs and symptoms include:

* [[Dyspnea]] - difficult, noisy breathing, [[obstructive sleep apnea]]<ref name="Perkins 2009">{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=JA|title=Overview of macroglossia and its treatment.|journal=Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery|date=2009 Dec|volume=17|issue=6|pages=460–5|pmid=19713845}}</ref> or airway obstruction<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />
* [[Dysphagia]] - difficulty swallowing and eating<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />
* [[Dysphonia]] - disrupted speech, possibly manifest as [[lisp]]ing<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />
* [[Sialorrhea]] - drooling<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />
* [[Angular cheilitis]] - sores at the corners of the mouth
* [[Crenulated tongue]] - indentations on the lateral borders of the tongue caused by pressure from teeth ("pie crust tongue")<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />
* Open bite - a type of [[malocclusion]] of the teeth<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />
* [[Mandibular prognathism]] - enlarged [[mandible]]<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />
* [[Mouth breathing]]
* [[Orthodontic]] abnornamlities - including [[diastema (dentistry)|diastema]] and tooth spacing<ref name="Topouzelis 2011" /> 

A tongue that constantly protrudes from the mouth is vulnerable to drying out, ulceration, infection or even necrosis.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />

==Causes==
Macroglossia may be caused by a wide variety of [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and [[acquired disorder|acquired conditions]]. Isolated macroglossia has no determinable cause.<ref name="Prada 2011" /> The most common causes of tongue enlargement are [[vascular malformation]]s (e.g. [[lymphangioma]] or [[hemangioma]]) and muscular [[hypertrophy]] (e.g. Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome or [[hemihyperplasia]]).<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Enlargement due to lymphangioma gives the tongue a pebbly appearance with multiple superficial dilated lymphatic channels. Enlargement due to hemihyperplasia is unilateral. In [[edentulous]] persons, a lack of teeth leaves more room for the tongue to expand into laterally, which can create problems with wearing [[dentures]] and may cause pseudomacroglossia.

[[Amyloidosis]] is an accumulation of insoluble proteins in tissues that impedes normal function.<ref>Merck Manual 17th Ed.</ref> This cane be a cause of macroglossia if [[amyloid]] is deposited in the tissues of the tongue, which gives it a nodular appearance. [[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]] is a rare hereditary condition, which may include other defects such as [[omphalocele]], [[visceromegaly]], [[gigantism]] or neonatal [[hypoglycemia]].

Apparent macroglossia can also occur in [[Down syndrome]].<ref name="pmid18685841">{{cite journal |author=Guimaraes CV, Donnelly LF, Shott SR, Amin RS, Kalra M |title=Relative rather than absolute macroglossia in patients with Down syndrome: implications for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea |journal=Pediatr Radiol |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1062–7 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18685841 |doi=10.1007/s00247-008-0941-7}}</ref> The tongue has a papillary, [[fissured tongue|fissured]] surface.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Macroglossia may be a sign of [[hypothyroidism|hypothyroid disorders]]

==Diagnosis==
Macroglossia is usually clinically diagnosed.<ref name="Topouzelis 2011" /> Sleep [[endoscopy]] and imaging may be used for assessment of obstructive sleep apnea.<ref name="Perkins 2009" /> The initial evaluation of all patients with macroglossia may involve [[abdominal ultrasound]] and molecular studies for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.<ref name="Prada 2011" />

==Treatment and prognosis==
Treatment and prognosis of macroglossia depends upon its cause, and also upon the severity of the enlargement and symptoms it is causing. No treatment may be required for mild cases or cases with minimal symptoms. Speech therapy may be beneficial, or surgery to reduce the size of the tongue (reduction glossectomy). Treatment may also involve correction of orthodontic abnormalities that may have been caused by the enlarged tongue.<ref name="Topouzelis 2011" /> Treatment of any underlying systemic disease may be required, e.g. [[radiotherapy]].<ref name="Topouzelis 2011" />

==Epidemiology==
Macroglossia is uncommon, and usually occurs in children.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook">{{cite book|last=Bouquot|first=Brad W. Neville , Douglas D. Damm, Carl M. Allen, Jerry E.|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0721690033|pages=9–10|edition=2. ed.}}</ref> Macroglossia has been reported to have a positive family history in 6% of cases. The [[National Organization of Rare Disorders]] lists macroglossia as a rare disease (less than 200 000 individuals in the US).<ref name="Prada 2011" />
