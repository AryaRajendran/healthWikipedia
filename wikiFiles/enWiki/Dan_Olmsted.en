'''Dan Olmsted''' is an [[investigative reporter]] and former senior editor for [[United Press International]] (UPI), a news agency of the [[Unification Church]] company [[News World Communications]]. Olmsted wrote a series about a [[Vaccine controversy|discredited hypothesis]] linking [[vaccination]] to [[autism]]. His columns on [[health]] and [[medicine]] appeared regularly in the ''[[Washington Times]]'', also owned by the church, and were syndicated nationally from UPI's [[Washington D.C.]] bureau. He currently owns and edits the ''Age of Autism'' website, which he describes as the "Daily Web Newspaper of the Autism Epidemic".

==''The Age of Autism''==
From January, 2005, through July, 2007, Olmsted wrote about his investigative findings concerning the apparent global [[Autism (incidence)|epidemic of autism]] in a series of columns titled ''The Age of Autism''. Though scientific research suggests that autism is a primarily genetic disorder and that reported increases are mainly due to changes in diagnostic practices, Olmsted claims that the increases are due to mercury poisoning, particularly from vaccines, and that the genetics is mostly secondary.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dan Olmsted|title=The Age of Autism: the last word|publisher=UPI|date=2007-07-18|url=http://www.upi.com/Consumer_Health_Daily/Reports/2007/07/18/the_age_of_autism_the_last_word/5761/|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref>

=== Congressional action ===
Citing Olmsted's reports, on March 30, 2006, Rep. [[Carolyn Maloney]] (NY) announced that she would be drafting legislation calling for scientific studies investigating [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal and autism]], additional to the many already conducted.<ref>[http://maloney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1081&Itemid=61 Carolyn Maloney (US congress page)] - "New, Thorough Study of Possible Mercury-Autism Link Proposed By Rep. Maloney". [http://maloney.house.gov/documents/health/mercury/20060330DraftAutismBill.pdf PDF draft of legislation].</ref>  The bill was introduced in the [[U. S. House of Representatives]] in April 2006.  Maloney made the announcement at a [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]], along with Olmsted and [[David Kirby]].<ref>[http://www.upi.com/HealthBusiness/view.php?StoryID=20060330-034542-2353r UPI.com] - 'UPI Autism story prompts bill' (March 30, 2006)</ref><ref name=Offit>{{cite journal |journal= N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1278–9 |title= Thimerosal and vaccines—a cautionary tale |author= [[Paul Offit|Offit PA]] |doi=10.1056/NEJMp078187 |pmid=17898096 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1278}}</ref>

===Criticism===

Many scientific studies have found no credible evidence that [[thimerosal|thimerosal vaccines]] and the [[MMR vaccine]] cause autism, and the [[MMR vaccine controversy]] has been determined to be the result of an "elaborate fraud" by British researcher [[Andrew Wakefield]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Can J Neurol Sci |year=2006 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=341–6 |title= Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature |author= Doja A, Roberts W |pmid=17168158}}</ref><ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ>{{cite journal |year= 2011 |pages= c7452 |volume= 342:c7452 |title= Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |author= Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |journal = [[BMJ]] |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |doi = 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pmid=21209060}}</ref>

In a critical assessment by the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' of the [[thimerosal controversy]], Olmsted's reporting on unvaccinated populations has been characterized as "misguided" by two anonymous reporters.  Both sources "believed that Olmsted has made up his mind on the question and is reporting the facts that support his conclusions".<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniel Schulman|title=Drug test|work=Columbia Journalism Review|year=2005|issue=6|url=http://www.cjr.org/issues/2005/6/schulman.asp|accessdate=2007-07-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070407091027/http://cjr.org/issues/2005/6/schulman.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-07}}</ref>
