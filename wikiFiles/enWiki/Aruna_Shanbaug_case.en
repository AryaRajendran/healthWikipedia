'''Aruna Shanbaug''' (alternatively spelled Shanbhag) is a former nurse from [[Haldipur]], [[Uttar Kannada]], [[Karnataka]] in [[India]]. In 1973, while working as a junior nurse at [[KEM Hospital|King Edward Memorial Hospital]], [[Parel]], [[Mumbai]], she was sexually assaulted by a ward boy, Sohanlal Bhartha Walmiki and has been in a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]] since the assault. On 24 January 2011, after she had been in this status for 37 years, the [[Supreme Court of India]] responded to the plea for [[euthanasia]] filed by Aruna's friend journalist [[Pinki Virani]], by setting up a medical panel to examine her. The court turned down the mercy killing petition on 7 March 2011. However in its landmark judgment, it allowed [[Euthanasia#Passive_and_active_euthanasia|passive euthanasia]] in India.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1516973.ece| title=India joins select nations in legalising "passive euthanasia"| publisher=The Hindu| date=7 March 2011}}</ref>

==Attack and trial==
Aruna was planning to get married to a medic in the hospital.<ref name=dc>{{cite news |title=Rebirth for Aruna, say joyous Mumbai hospital staff |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/143798/rebirth-aruna-say-joyous-mumbai.html |publisher= ''Deccan Herald''|date=March 7, 2011 }}</ref>

On the night of 27 November 1973, Shanbaug was sexually assaulted by Sohanlal Bhartha Walmiki, a sweeper on contract at the King Edward Memorial Hospital.<ref name="toi" /> Sohanlal was motivated partly by resentment for being ordered about and castigated by Shanbaug.<ref name="dna" /><ref name="hindufrontline" /> Sohanlal attacked her while she was changing clothes in the hospital basement. He choked her with a dog chain and [[sodomy|sodomized]] her. The [[asphyxiation]] cut off oxygen supply to her brain,  resulting in brain stem contusion injury and cervical cord injury apart from leaving her [[Cortical blindness|cortically blind]].<ref name="toi2" />

The police case was registered as a case of [[robbery]] and [[attempted murder]] on account of the concealment of [[anal rape]] by the doctors under the instructions of the Dean of KEM, Dr. Deshpande, perhaps to avoid the [[social rejection]] of the victim,<ref name="chowk" /> and her impending marriage.<ref name=dc/>

Sohanlal was caught and convicted, and served two concurrent seven-year sentences for assault and robbery, neither for rape or sexual molestation, nor for the "unnatural sexual offence" (which could have got him a ten-year sentence by itself).

===Nurses' strike===
Following the attack, nurses in Mumbai went on [[Strike action|strike]] demanding improved conditions for Shanbaug and better working conditions for themselves.<ref name="hindufrontline" /> In the 1980s the [[Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai|BMC]] made two attempts to move Shanbaug outside the [[KEM Hospital]] to free the bed she has been occupying for seven years. KEM nurses launched a protest, and the BMC abandoned the plan.<ref name="timeline" />

==Supreme Court case==
{{See also|Euthanasia in India}}
Since the assault in 1973, she has been in a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]].

On December 17, 2010, Supreme Court while admitting the plea to end the life made by activist-journalist Pinki Virani, sought a report on Shanbaug's medical condition from the hospital in Mumbai and the [[government of Maharashtra]].<ref>{{cite news |title=India court admits plea to end life of rape victim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8417549.stm |publisher=''[[BBC News]], Delhi''  |date=17 December 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Judges consider comatose rape victim’s right to die |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6960935.ece |publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=December 18, 2009   }}</ref>  On 24 January 2011, the Supreme Court of India responded to the plea for [[euthanasia]] filed by Aruna's friend journalist [[Pinki Virani]], by setting up a medical panel to examine her.<ref>{{cite news|title=Team to look into Euthanasia plea|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Team-to-look-into-euthanasia-plea/articleshow/7357192.cms|publisher=Times Of India|date=2011-01-25}}</ref> The  three-member medical committee subsequently set up under the Supreme Court's directive, checked upon Aruna and concluded that she met "most of the criteria of being in a permanent vegetative state".<ref>{{cite news |title='Aruna Shanbaug's brain shrivelled after 1973 sexual assault'|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-28/india/28641570_1_aruna-ramachandra-shanbaug-human-brain-pinki-virani |publisher=''The Times of India'' |date=Feb 28, 2011}}</ref>

However, it turned down the mercy killing petition on 7 March 2011. The court, in its landmark judgement, however allowed [[Euthanasia#Passive euthanasia|passive euthanasia]] in India.

While rejecting Pinki Virani's plea for Aruna Shanbaug's euthanasia, the court laid out guidelines for passive euthanasia. According to these guidelines, passive euthanasia involves the withdrawing of treatment or food that would allow the patient to live.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12662124|title=India court rejects Aruna Shanbaug euthanasia plea|publisher=BBC|date=7 March 2011|accessdate=8 March 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110307152311/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12662124| archivedate= 7 March 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="LA-times">{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-india-euthanasia-20110308,0,1497102.story|title=India's Supreme Court lays out euthanasia guidelines|publisher=LA Times|date=8 March 2011|accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref>

==Response==

Following the Supreme Court judgment rejecting the plea, her colleagues, the nursing staff at the hospital, who had opposed the petition, and who had been looking after her since she had lapsed into coma, distributed sweets and cut a cake to celebrate what they termed her "rebirth". A senior nurse at the hospital later said, "We have to tend to her just like a small child at home. She only keeps aging like any of us, does not create any problems for us. We take turns looking after her and we love to care for her. How can anybody think of taking her life?"<ref name=dc/>

Pinki Virani’s lawyer, Shubhangi Tulli ruled out filing an appeal stating "the two-judge ruling was final till the SC decided to constitute a larger bench to re-examine the issue". Pinki Virani herself stated, "Because of this woman who has never received  justice, no other person in a similar position will have to suffer for more than three and a half-decades."<ref>{{cite news |title=‘Because of Aruna, no one else will have to suffer’|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Thanks-to-Aruna-others-won-t-suffer-Pinki-Virani/Article1-670476.aspx |publisher=''Hindustan Times'' |date=March 07, 2011 }}</ref>

==In popular culture==
A non-fiction book titled ''Aruna's Story'' has been written by Pinki Virani about the case in 1998, while Duttakumar Desai wrote the Marathi play, ''Katha Arunachi'' in 1994–95 and was performed at the college level, subsequently it was staged under director Vinay Apte in 2002.<ref name="toipune" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Aruna’s story is now a play at Sahitya Sangh |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=13717 |publisher=''[[Indian Express]]'' |date=April 03, 2002 }}</ref>
