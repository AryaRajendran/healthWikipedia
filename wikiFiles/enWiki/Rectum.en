The '''rectum''' (from the Latin ''[[Wikt:rectum|rectum]] [[Wikt:intestinum|intestinum]]'', meaning ''straight intestine'') is the final straight portion of the [[large intestine]] in some [[mammal]]s, and the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]] in others. The human rectum is about {{convert|12|cm|inch}} long, <ref>{{citation |title= AJCC Cancer Staging Atlas |chapter= 12. Colon and Rectum |publisher= American Joint Committee on Cancer |year= 2006 |page= 109 |url= http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/colon_rectum_chpt_14.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-313390-0 }}</ref> and begins at the rectosigmoid junction (the end of the sigmoid colon), at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. <ref name=ASCRS>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=senior editors, Bruce G. Wolff ... [et|title=The ASCRS textbook of colon and rectal surgery|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0-387-24846-3}}</ref> Its [[caliber]] is similar to that of the [[sigmoid colon]] at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the [[rectal ampulla]]. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the [[puborectalis]] sling) or the [[dentate line]], again depending upon which definition is used. <ref name=ASCRS /> In humans, the rectum is followed by the [[anal canal]], before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the [[anus| anal verge]].

== Role in human defecation ==
The rectum intestinum acts as a temporary storage site for feces. As the rectal walls expand due to the materials filling it from within, stretch receptors from the [[nervous system]] located in the rectal walls stimulate the desire to [[defecation|defecate]]. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] where more water is absorbed from the feces. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period, [[constipation]] and hardened feces results.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

When the rectum becomes full, the increase in intrarectal pressure forces the walls of the [[anal canal]] apart, allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and [[peristalsis|peristaltic wave]]s propel the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external [[sphincter]] allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces.

==Supports of rectum==
*Pelvic floor formed by [[levator ani]] muscles.
*[[Fascia of Waldeyer]]
*Lateral ligaments of rectum which are formed by the condensation of pelvic fascia
*Rectovesical fascia of Denonvillers, which extends from rectum behind to the seminal vesicles and prostate in front.
*Pelvic peritoneum
*[[Perineal body]]

==Medical procedures==
For the diagnosis of certain ailments, a [[rectal exam]] may be done. 

[[Suppository|Suppositories]] may be inserted into the rectum as a [[route of administration]] for medicine. 

The [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] procedures [[colonoscopy]] and [[sigmoidoscopy]] are performed to diagnose diseases such as [[cancer]]. 

Digital Rectal Stimulation, the insertion of one finger into the rectum, is used to induce peristalsis in patients whose own peristaltic reflex is inadequate to fully empty the rectum.

Manual Evacuation is the use of a gloved finger to evacuate faeces from the rectum, and is utilised primarily in acute [[constipation]] and also the long-term management of neurogenic bowel, seen most frequently in people with a [[spinal cord injury]] or [[multiple sclerosis]].

===Temperature taking===
{{Main|Normal human body temperature}}
related article: [[rectal thermometry]]

[[Body temperature]] can also be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting a [[medical thermometer]] not more than 25&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;inch) into the rectum via the [[anus]]. A [[mercury-in-glass thermometer|mercury thermometer]] should be inserted for 3 to 5 minutes; a digital thermometer should remain inserted until it beeps. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38&nbsp;°C (97.6 to 100.4&nbsp;°F) and is about 0.5&nbsp;°C (1&nbsp;°F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1&nbsp;°C (2&nbsp;°F) above [[axilla]] (armpit) temperature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

[[pediatrics|Pediatricians]] recommend that parents take [[infant]]s' and [[toddler]]s' temperature in the rectum for two reasons: 
#Rectal temperature is the closest to core body temperature and in young children, accuracy is critical.
#Younger children frequently do not cooperate when having their temperature taken by mouth (oral), which is recommended for children ages 6 and above as well as adults.

In recent years, the introduction of non-invasive temperature taking methods including tympanic (ear) and forehead thermometers, and changing attitudes on [[privacy]] and [[modesty]] have led some parents and doctors to discontinue taking rectal temperatures.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

== Sexual stimulation ==
Due to the proximity of the anterior wall of the rectum to the [[vagina]] in females or to the [[prostate]] in males and the shared nerves thereof, rectal [[stimulation]] or penetration can result in [[sexual arousal]]. For further information on this aspect, see [[anal sex]].
