'''Diabetes insipidus''' ('''DI''') is a [[disease|condition]] characterized by [[polydipsia|excessive thirst]] and excretion of large amounts of severely diluted [[polyuria|urine]], with reduction of fluid intake having no effect on the concentration of the urine.  There are several different types of DI, each with a different cause.  The most common type in humans is central DI, caused by a deficiency of arginine [[vasopressin]] (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The second common type of DI is [[nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]], which is caused by an insensitivity of the [[kidney]]s to ADH.  It can also be an [[iatrogenic artifact]] of drug use.

Although they have a common name, [[diabetes mellitus]] and diabetes insipidus are two entirely separate conditions with unrelated mechanisms.  Both cause large amounts of urine to be produced ([[polyuria]]), and the term "diabetes" is derived from the Greek name for this symptom.  However, diabetes insipidus is either a problem with the production of antidiuretic hormone (central diabetes insipidus) or kidney's response to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), whereas diabetes mellitus causes polyuria via a process called [[osmotic diuresis]], due to the high blood sugar leaking into the urine and taking excess water along with it.

The incidence of diabetes insipidus in the general population is three in 100,000.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1542/pir.21-4-122}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Excessive urination and extreme thirst (especially for cold water and sometimes ice or ice water) are typical for DI.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001415/ |title=Diabetes insipidus - PubMed Health |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref> Its symptoms are quite similar to those of untreated [[diabetes mellitus]], with the distinction that the urine does not contain glucose and there is no [[hyperglycemia]] (elevated [[blood glucose]]). Blurred vision is a rarity.  Signs of [[dehydration]] may also appear in some individuals, since the body cannot conserve much (if any) of the water it takes in.

The extreme urination continues throughout the day and the night. In children, DI can interfere with appetite, eating, weight gain, and [[human development (biology)|growth]], as well. They may present with [[fever]], [[vomiting]], or [[diarrhea]]. Adults with untreated DI may remain healthy for decades as long as enough water is consumed to offset the urinary losses. However, there is a continuous risk of [[dehydration]] and loss of potassium.

==Diagnosis==
To distinguish DI from other causes of excess urination, [[blood glucose]] levels, [[bicarbonate]] levels, and [[calcium]] levels need to be tested. Measurement of blood [[electrolyte]]s can reveal a high [[sodium]] level ([[hypernatremia]] as [[dehydration]] develops). [[Urinalysis]] demonstrates a dilute urine with a low [[specific gravity]]. Urine [[osmolarity]] and electrolyte levels are typically low. 

A [[fluid deprivation test]] helps determine whether DI is caused by:
# excessive intake of fluid ([[primary polydipsia]])
# a defect in [[antidiuretic hormone|ADH]] production
# a defect in the kidneys' response to [[antidiuretic hormone|ADH]]

This test measures changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld and as dehydration occurs.  The body's normal response to dehydration is to concentrate urine and conserve water, so urine becomes more concentrated and urination becomes less frequent.  Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of not drinking any fluids. In primary polydipsia, the urine [[osmolality]] should increase and stabilize at above 280 Osm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus.<ref name=agabegi2nd/> Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the hourly increase in osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour for at least 3 hours.<ref name=agabegi2nd>{{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 }}</ref> Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH during this test is also necessary, but is more time consuming to perform.<ref name=agabegi2nd/>

To distinguish between the main forms, [[desmopressin]] stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a patient should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as this can lead to sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases osmolarity, the pituitary production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally. If the DI is due to renal pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity.

If central DI is suspected, testing of other hormones of the [[pituitary]], as well as [[magnetic resonance imaging]], is necessary to discover if a disease process (such as a [[prolactinoma]], or [[histiocytosis]], [[syphilis]], [[tuberculosis]] or other [[tumor]] or [[granuloma]]) is affecting pituitary function.  Most people with this form have either experienced past head trauma or have stopped ADH production for an unknown reason.

Habit drinking (in its severest form termed [[psychogenic polydipsia]]) is the most common imitator of diabetes insipidus at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most patients with habit polydipsia have no other detectable disease. The distinction is made during the water deprivation test, as some degree of urinary concentration above isosmolar is usually obtained before the patient becomes dehydrated.

==Pathophysiology==
Electrolyte and volume [[homeostasis]] is a complex mechanism that balances the body's requirements for [[blood pressure]] and the main electrolytes [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. In general, electrolyte regulation precedes volume regulation. When the volume is severely depleted, however, the body will retain water at the expense of deranging electrolyte levels.

The regulation of urine production occurs in the [[hypothalamus]], which produces [[Vasopressin|ADH]] in the [[Supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[Paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular]] nuclei.  After synthesis, the hormone is transported in neurosecretory granules down the axon of the hypothalamic neuron to the posterior lobe of the [[pituitary gland]], where it is stored for later release. In addition, the hypothalamus regulates the sensation of thirst in the [[ventromedial nucleus]] by sensing increases in serum osmolarity and relaying this information to the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]. 

The main effector organ for [[body water|fluid]] homeostasis is the [[kidney]]. ADH acts by increasing water permeability in the [[collecting ducts]] and distal convoluted tubules; specifically, it acts on proteins called [[aquaporin]]s and more specifically aquaporin 2 in the following cascade; ADH (argenine vasopressin-AVP) produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary. When released, ADH binds to V2 G-protein coupled receptors within the distal convoluted tubules, increasing [[cyclic AMP]], which couples with [[protein kinase A]], stimulating translocation of the aquaporin 2 channel stored in the [[cytoplasm]] of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts into the apical membrane.  These transcribed channels allow water into the collecting duct cells. The increase in permeability allows for reabsorption of water into the bloodstream, thus concentrating the urine.

Hereditary forms of diabetes insipidus account for less than 10% of the cases of diabetes insipidus seen in clinical practice.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1681/ASN.2005040371}}</ref>

==Classification==
The several forms of DI are:

===Neurogenic===
{{main|Neurogenic diabetes insipidus}}
Neurogenic diabetes insipidus, more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus, is due to a lack of [[vasopressin]] production in the brain.

===Nephrogenic===
{{main|Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus}}
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is due to the inability of the kidney to respond normally to vasopressin.

===Dipsogenic===
Dipsogenic DI is due to a defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus.<ref name="pmid16544179">{{cite journal |author=Perkins RM, Yuan CM, Welch PG |title=Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus: report of a novel treatment strategy and literature review |journal=Clin. Exp. Nephrol. |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=63–7 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16544179 |doi=10.1007/s10157-005-0397-0}}</ref> This defect results in an abnormal increase in thirst and fluid intake that suppresses vasopressin secretion and increases urine output. Desmopressin is ineffective, and can lead to fluid overload as the thirst remains.

===Gestational===
Gestational DI only occurs during [[pregnancy]]. During pregnancy, all women produce vasopressinase in the [[placenta]], which breaks down ADH. Gestational DI is thought to occur with excessive vasopressinase production.<ref name="pmid17308961">{{cite journal |author=Kalelioglu I, Kubat Uzum A, Yildirim A, Ozkan T, Gungor F, Has R |title=Transient gestational diabetes insipidus diagnosed in successive pregnancies: review of pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and management of delivery |journal=Pituitary |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=87–93 |year=2007 |pmid=17308961 |doi=10.1007/s11102-007-0006-1}}</ref>

Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used. 

Diabetes insipidus is also associated with some serious diseases of pregnancy, including [[pre-eclampsia]], [[HELLP syndrome]] and [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]].  These cause DI by activating hepatic vasopressinase.  It is important to consider these diseases if a woman presents with diabetes insipidus in pregnancy, because their treatments require delivery of the baby before the disease will improve.  Failure to treat these diseases promptly can lead to maternal or perinatal mortality.

==Treatment==
Central DI and gestational DI respond to [[desmopressin]]. [[Carbamazepine]], an anticonvulsive medication, has also had some success in this type of DI. Also, gestational DI tends to abate on its own four to six weeks following labour, though some women may develop it again in subsequent pregnancies.  In dipsogenic DI, desmopressin is not usually an option.

Desmopressin will be ineffective in nephrogenic DI. Instead, the [[diuretic]] [[hydrochlorothiazide]] (a thiazide diuretic) or [[indomethacin]] can improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with [[amiloride]] to prevent [[hypokalemia]]. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis.  This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering GFR and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron.  Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loffing J |title=Paradoxical antidiuretic effect of thiazides in diabetes insipidus: another piece in the puzzle |journal=J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=2948–50 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15504949 |doi=10.1097/01.ASN.0000146568.82353.04 |url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15504949}}</ref>

Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be effectively managed with the administration of amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, amiloride has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Finch CK, Kelley KW, Williams RB |title=Treatment of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus with amiloride |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=546–50 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12680486 |doi=10.1592/phco.23.4.546.32121 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word "diabetes" ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|d|aɪ|.|ə|ˈ|b|iː|t|iː|z}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|.|ə|ˈ|b|iː|t|ɨ|s}}) comes from [[Latin]] ''diabētēs'', which in turn comes from [[Ancient Greek]] διαβήτης (''diabētēs'') which literally means “a passer through; a [[siphon]]”.<ref name=OED_diabetes>Oxford English Dictionary. ''diabetes''. Retrieved 2011-06-10.</ref> [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[physician]] [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] in the first century [[Common Era|CE]]) used that word, with the intended meaning “excessive discharge of urine”, as the name for the disease.<ref name=OnlineEtymology_diabetes>{{cite web

"Insipidus" comes from the French word ''insipide''; from Latin language ''inspidus'' (tasteless), from Latin: ''in-'' "not" + ''sapidus'' "tasty" from ''sapere'' "have a taste" - meaning  “lacking flavor or zest; not tasty”. This is because diabetes insipidus has no [[glycosuria]] (excretion of glucose into urine).
