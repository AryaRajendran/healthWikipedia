A '''virus''' is a small [[pathogen|infectious agent]] that can replicate only inside the living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of an organism. Viruses can infect all types of organisms, from [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].<ref name="pmid16984643"/>

Since [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]]'s 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, and the discovery of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] by [[Martinus Beijerinck]] in 1898,<ref name="Dimmock"/> about 5,000 viruses have been described in detail,<ref name="Dimmock p. 49">Dimmock p. 49</ref> although there are millions of different types.<ref name="Breitbart M, Rohwer F 2005 278–84">{{vcite journal|author=Breitbart M, Rohwer F|title=Here a virus, there a virus, everywhere the same virus?|journal=Trends Microbiol |volume=13|issue=6|pages=278–84|year=2005|pmid=15936660|doi=10.1016/j.tim.2005.04.003}}</ref> Viruses are found in almost every [[ecosystem]] on Earth and are the most abundant type of biological entity.<ref name="Lawrence"/><ref>{{vcite journal|author=Edwards RA, Rohwer F|title=Viral metagenomics|journal=Nat.

Virus particles (known as ''virions'') consist of two or three parts: i) the [[genetic material]] made from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], long [[molecule]]s that carry genetic information; ii) a [[protein]] coat that protects these genes; and in some cases iii) an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of viruses range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. The average virus is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium. Most viruses are too small to be seen directly with an [[optical microscope]].

The origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s&nbsp;– pieces of DNA that can move between cells&nbsp;– while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]].<ref name = "Canchaya"/> Viruses are considered by some to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection. However they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life".<ref name="ReferenceA">{{vcite journal|author = Rybicki, EP|year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = S Afr J Sci|volume = 86|pages = 182–186}}</ref>

Viruses spread in many ways; viruses in plants are often transmitted from plant to plant by [[insect]]s that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. These disease-bearing organisms are known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal&ndash;oral route|faecal&ndash;oral route]] and are passed from person to person by contact, entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexual intercourse|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The range of host cells that a virus can infect is called its "[[Host specificity|host range]]". This can be narrow or, as when a virus is capable of infecting many species, broad.<ref>Shors pp. 49–50</ref>

Viral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause [[AIDS]] and [[viral hepatitis]] evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections. [[Antibiotic]]s have no effect on viruses, but several [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed.

[[Louis Pasteur]] was unable to find a causative agent for [[rabies]] and speculated about a pathogen too small to be detected using a microscope.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Bordenave G |title=Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) |journal=Microbes and Infection / Institut Pasteur |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=553–60 |year=2003 |pmid=12758285 |doi=10.1016/S1286-4579(03)00075-3}}</ref> In 1884, the French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] invented a filter (known today as the [[Chamberland filter]] or Chamberland-Pasteur filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution.<ref>Shors pp. 76–77</ref> In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a [[toxin]] produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea.<ref name="Collier3"/> At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium&nbsp;– this was part of the [[germ theory of disease]].<ref name="Dimmock">Dimmock p. 4</ref> In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent.<ref>Dimmock p.4–5</ref> He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a ''[[contagium vivum fluidum]]'' (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word ''virus''.<ref name="Collier3">Collier p. 3</ref> Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by [[Wendell Stanley]], who proved they were particulate.<ref name="Collier3"/> In the same year [[Friedrich Loeffler]] and Frosch passed the first animal virus&nbsp;– agent of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] ([[aphthovirus]])&nbsp;– through a similar filter.<ref name="isbn0-12-375146-2">{{vcite book |author=Fenner F. |editor=Mahy B.

In the early 20th century, the English bacteriologist [[Frederick Twort]] discovered a group of viruses that infect bacteria, now called [[bacteriophages]]<ref>Shors p. 589</ref> (or commonly ''phages''), and the French-Canadian microbiologist [[Félix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria on [[agar]], would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension.<ref>{{vcite journal|pmid = 17855060|author = D'Herelle F|title = On an invisible microbe antagonistic toward dysenteric bacilli: brief note by Mr. F.

The study of phages provided insights into the switching on and off of genes, and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into bacteria.

By the end of the 19th century, viruses were defined in terms of their [[infectivity]], their ability to be filtered, and their requirement for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, [[Ross Granville Harrison]] invented a method for growing [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] in [[lymph]], and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow [[vaccinia]] virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue.<ref>{{vcite journal|author= Steinhardt E, Israeli C, Lambert R.A.|year = 1913|title = Studies on the cultivation of the virus of vaccinia|journal = J. Inf Dis.|volume = 13|pages = 294–300|doi = 10.1093/infdis/13.2.294|issue = 2}}</ref> In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when [[poliovirus]] was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.<ref>Collier p. 4</ref>

Another breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist [[Ernest William Goodpasture]] grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilized chickens' eggs.<ref>{{vcite journal|author = Goodpasture EW, Woodruff AM, Buddingh GJ|year= 1931|title = The cultivation of vaccine and other viruses in the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos|journal = Science|volume = 74|issue = 1919| pages = 371–372|pmid = 17810781|doi=10.1126/science.74.1919.371}}</ref> In 1949, [[John Franklin Enders]], [[Thomas Huckle Weller|Thomas Weller]], and [[Frederick Robbins]] grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells, the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs.

The first images of viruses were obtained upon the invention of [[electron microscopy]] in 1931 by the German engineers [[Ernst Ruska]] and [[Max Knoll]].<ref>From ''Nobel Lectures, Physics 1981–1990'', (1993) Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Gösta Ekspång, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore.

The tobacco mosaic virus was the first to be [[crystal]]lised and its structure could therefore be elucidated in detail. The first [[X-ray diffraction]] pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941.

; Regressive hypothesis : Viruses may have once been small cells that [[parasitism|parasitised]] larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria [[rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|chlamydia]] are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend support to this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the ''degeneracy hypothesis'',<ref name="Dimmock16">Dimmock p. 16</ref><ref>Collier p. 11</ref> or ''reduction hypothesis''.<ref name="Mahy Gen 24"/>
; Cellular origin hypothesis : Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that "escaped" from the genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA could have come from [[plasmid]]s (pieces of naked DNA that can move ''between'' cells) or [[transposons]] (molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions ''within'' the genes of the cell).<ref>Shors p. 574</ref> Once called "jumping genes", transposons are examples of [[mobile genetic elements]] and could be the origin of some viruses.

; Coevolution hypothesis : This is also called the ''virus-first hypothesis''<ref name="Mahy Gen 24"/> and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and [[nucleic acid]] at the same time as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. [[Viroids]] are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents.<ref>Dimmock p. 55</ref> Viroids are important pathogens of plants.<ref>Shors 551–3</ref> They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication.<ref name="pmid18764915">{{vcite journal

In the past, there were problems with all of these hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells.<ref name="Mahy Gen 24"/> Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the [[Three-domain system|three domains]].<ref name="Mahy Gen 28"/> This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.<ref name="Mahy Gen 28">{{vcite book |author=Mahy WJ & Van Regenmortel MHV (eds) |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |pages=28 |isbn=0-12-375146-2}}</ref>

Viruses display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes, called ''[[morphology (biology)|morphologies]]''. In general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria. Most viruses that have been studied have a diameter between 20 and 300 [[nanometres]]. Some [[filovirus]]es have a total length of up to 1400&nbsp;nm; their diameters are only about 80&nbsp;nm.<ref name="Collier3355">Collier pp. 33–55</ref> Most viruses cannot be seen with an [[optical microscope]] so scanning and transmission [[electron microscope]]s are used to visualise virions.<ref>Collier pp. 33–37</ref> To increase the contrast between viruses and the background, electron-dense "stains" are used. These are solutions of salts of heavy metals, such as [[tungsten]], that scatter the electrons from regions covered with the stain. When virions are coated with stain (positive staining), fine detail is obscured. [[Negative staining]] overcomes this problem by staining the background only.<ref name="pmid1715774">{{vcite journal

A complete virus particle, known as a virion, consists of nucleic acid surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a [[capsid]]. These are formed from identical protein subunits called [[capsomere]]s.<ref>Collier p. 40</ref> Viruses can have a [[lipid]] "envelope" derived from the host [[cell membrane]].

|caption3=[[Herpesviridae|Herpes viruses]] have a lipid envelope
}}

; Helical: These viruses are composed of a single type of capsomer stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or hollow tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomers. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>

; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with icosahedral symmetry. A regular [[icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomers required is twelve, each composed of five identical sub-units. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than twelve capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. Capsomers at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomers and are called pentons. Capsomers on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons.<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers or they may be composed of different proteins.

; Prolate: This is an icosahedron elongated along the fivefold axis and is a common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages. This structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap at either end.<ref>{{vcite book |author=Casens, S.|title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |pages=167–174 |isbn=0-12-375146-2}}</ref>

; [[Viral envelope|Envelope]]{{Anchor|Non-enveloped virus}}: Some species of virus envelop themselves in a modified form of one of the [[cell membranes]], either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or [[endoplasmic reticulum]], thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.<ref>Collier pp. 42–43</ref>

; Complex: These viruses possess a capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, and that may possess extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as [[Enterobacteria phage T4]], have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a [[hexagon]]al base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Rossmann MG, Mesyanzhinov VV, Arisaka F, Leiman PG |title=The bacteriophage T4 DNA injection machine |journal=Curr.

The poxviruses are large, complex viruses that have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is associated with proteins within a central disk structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid is surrounded by a membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface.

An enormous variety of genomic structures can be seen among viral species; as a group, they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants, animals, archaea, or bacteria. There are millions of different types of viruses,<ref name="Breitbart M, Rohwer F 2005 278–84"/> although only about 5,000 of them have been described in detail.<ref name="Dimmock p. 49"/>
A virus has either DNA or RNA genes and is called a DNA virus or a RNA virus, respectively. The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.<ref name="Collier9699">Collier pp. 96–99</ref>

Viral genomes are circular, as in the [[polyomavirus]]es, or linear, as in the [[Adenoviridae|adenoviruses]]. The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called ''segmented''. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name="Collier3355"/>

A viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name="Collier9699"/>

For most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the plus-strand) or [[negative-sense]] (called the minus-strand), depending on whether or not they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the ''coding strand'' for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the ''non-coding strand'' is a copy of it (+).<ref name="Collier9699"/> However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include [[Geminiviridae|geminiviruses]], which are ssDNA plant viruses and [[arenavirus]]es, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.<ref name="isbn0-470-02387-2">{{vcite book |author=Saunders, Venetia A.; Carter, John |title=Virology: principles and applications |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Chichester |year=2007 |pages= 72 |isbn=0-470-02387-2}}</ref>

Genome size varies greatly between species. The smallest viral genomes&nbsp;– the ssDNA circoviruses, family ''[[Circoviridae]]''&nbsp;– code for only two proteins and have a genome size of only 2 kilobases; the largest&nbsp;– [[mimivirus]]es&nbsp;– have genome sizes of over 1.2 megabases and code for over one thousand proteins.<ref name="pmid20690825">{{vcite journal |author=Van Etten JL, Lane LC, Dunigan DD |title=DNA viruses: the really big ones (giruses) |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=64 |pages=83–99 |year=2010 |pmid=20690825 |pmc=2936810 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.112408.134338}}</ref> In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses because of a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit.<ref name="pmid20660197"/> Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To compensate for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes&nbsp;– the genome is split into smaller molecules&nbsp;– thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes because of the high fidelity of their replication enzymes.<ref>{{vcite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF02257374|author = Pressing J, Reanney DC|year = 1984|title = Divided genomes and intrinsic noise|journal = J Mol Evol|volume = 20|issue = 2| pages = 135–46|pmid = 6433032}}</ref> Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.<ref name="pmid19264617">{{vcite journal |author=Duffy S, Holmes EC |title=Validation of high rates of nucleotide substitution in geminiviruses: phylogenetic evidence from East African cassava mosaic viruses |journal=The Journal of General Virology |volume=90 |issue=Pt 6 |pages=1539–47 |year=2009 |pmid=19264617 |doi=10.1099/vir.0.009266-0}}</ref>

Viruses undergo genetic change by several mechanisms. These include a process called [[genetic drift]] where individual bases in the DNA or RNA [[mutate]] to other bases. Most of these [[point mutations]] are "silent"&nbsp;– they do not change the protein that the gene encodes&nbsp;– but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to [[antiviral drugs]].<ref name="pmid17927612">{{vcite journal

Segmented genomes confer evolutionary advantages; different strains of a virus with a segmented genome can shuffle and combine genes and produce progeny viruses or (offspring) that have unique characteristics. This is called reassortment or ''viral sex''.<ref>Goudsmit, Jaap. Viral Sex. Oxford Univ Press, 1998.ISBN 978-0-19-512496-5 ISBN 0-19-512496-0</ref>

===Replication cycle===
Viral populations do not grow through cell division, because they are acellular. Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they ''assemble'' in the cell.

{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=HepC replication.png|image2=Phage injecting its genome into bacteria.svg
|width=300|caption1=A typical virus replication cycle|caption2=Some bacteriophages inject their [[genome]]s into bacterial cells (not to scale)}}

The [[viral life cycle|life cycle of viruses]] differs greatly between species but there are six ''basic'' stages in the life cycle of viruses:<ref>Collier pp. 75–91</ref>
* ''Attachment'' is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human [[leucocytes]]. This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule&nbsp;– a [[chemokine receptor]]&nbsp;– which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.
* ''Penetration'' follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]] or [[Lipid bilayer fusion|membrane fusion]]. This is often called [[viral entry]]. The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of [[cellulose]], and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall.<ref>Dimmock p. 70</ref> However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called [[plasmodesma]]ta.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Boevink P, Oparka KJ|title=Virus-host interactions during movement processes|journal=Plant Physiol.|volume=138|issue=4|pages=1815–21|year=2005|pmid=16172094|pmc=1183373|doi=10.1104/pp.105.066761|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16172094}}</ref> Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.<ref>Dimmock p. 71</ref>
* ''Uncoating'' is a process in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by degradation by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid.
* ''Replication'' of viruses involves primarily multiplication of the genome. Replication involves synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) from "early" genes (with exceptions for positive sense RNA viruses), viral [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], possible assembly of viral proteins, then viral genome replication mediated by early or regulatory protein expression. This may be followed, for complex viruses with larger genomes, by one or more further rounds of mRNA synthesis: "late" gene expression is, in general, of structural or virion proteins.
* Following the structure-mediated self-''assembly'' of the virus particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs ''after'' the virus has been released from the host cell.<ref name="pmid11451488">{{vcite journal|author=Barman S, Ali A, Hui EK, Adhikary L, Nayak DP|title=Transport of viral proteins to the apical membranes and interaction of matrix protein with glycoproteins in the assembly of influenza viruses|journal=Virus Res.|volume=77|issue=1|pages=61–9|year=2001|pmid=11451488|doi=10.1016/S0168-1702(01)00266-0}}</ref>
* Viruses can be ''released'' from the host cell by [[lysis]], a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: This is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses. Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a "[[provirus]]" or, in the case of bacteriophages a "[[prophage]]".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host; however, at some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp.243–259</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]]. During this process the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane.<ref>Dimmock 185–187</ref>

The genetic material within virus particles, and the method by which the material is replicated, varies considerably between different types of viruses.

; [[DNA viruses]] : The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or&nbsp;– more usually&nbsp;– by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery; however, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>

; [[RNA viruses]]: Replication usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>

; [[Reverse transcribing viruses]]: These have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. [[Retrovirus]]es integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name="pmid16949329">{{vcite journal |author=Staginnus C, Richert-Pöggeler KR |title=Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome |journal=Trends in Plant Science |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=485–91 |year=2006 |pmid=16949329 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008}}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

==Classification==
{{main|Virus classification}}

Classification seeks to describe the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them on the basis of similarities. In 1962, [[André Lwoff]], Robert Horne, and [[Paul Tournier]] were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] hierarchical system.<ref name="pmid14467544">{{vcite journal
|author=Lwoff A, Horne RW, Tournier P
|title=A virus system

|journal=C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci.
|volume=254
|pages=4225–7
|year=1962
|pmid=14467544}}</ref> This system bases classification on [[phylum]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]]. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes.<ref name="pmid13931895">{{vcite journal
|author=Lwoff A, Horne R, Tournier P
|title=A system of viruses
|journal=Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol.
|volume=27
|pages=51–5
|year=1962
|pmid=13931895}}</ref> Later the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond Order. As such, the Baltimore Classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.

===ICTV classification===
The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) developed the current classification system and wrote guidelines that put a greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A unified taxonomy (a universal system for classifying viruses) has been established. The 7th lCTV Report formalised for the first time the concept of the virus species as the lowest taxon (group) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa.<ref>Fields p. 27
* As defined therein, "a virus species is a polythetic class of viruses that constitute a replicating lineage and occupy a particular ecological niche". A "polythetic" class is one whose members have several properties in common, although they do not necessarily all share a single common defining one. Members of a virus species are defined collectively by a consensus group of properties. Virus species thus differ from the higher viral taxa, which are "universal" classes and as such are defined by properties that are necessary for membership.</ref> However, at present only a small part of the total diversity of viruses has been studied, with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus sequences recovered have not been seen before, and samples from the environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Delwart EL|title=Viral metagenomics|journal=Rev. Med. Virol.|volume=17|issue=2|pages=115–31|year=2007|pmid=17295196|doi=10.1002/rmv.532}}</ref>

The general taxonomic structure is as follows:

:[[Order (biology)|Order]] (-virales)
::[[Family (biology)|Family]] (-viridae)
:::[[Subfamily]] (-virinae)
::::[[Genus]] (''-virus'')
:::::[[Species]] (''-virus'')

In the current (2011) ICTV taxonomy, six orders have been established, the Caudovirales, Herpesvirales, Mononegavirales, Nidovirales, Picornavirales and Tymovirales. A seventh order Ligamenvirales has also been proposed. The committee does not formally distinguish between [[subspecies]], [[Strain (biology)|strains]], and [[Primary isolate|isolates]]. In total there are 6 orders, [[List of virus families|87 families]], 19 subfamilies, 349 genera, about 2,284 species and over 3,000 types yet unclassified.<ref name="isbn0123846846">{{vcite book |author=King AMQ, Lefkowitz E, Adams MJ, Carstens EB|title=Virus Taxonomy: Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|publisher=Elsevier|year=2011|page=6 |isbn=0-12-384684-6}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp?version=2009 Virus Taxonomy 2009.] International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

The Baltimore classification of viruses is based on the mechanism of [[mRNA]] production. Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family. Viral genomes may be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), RNA or DNA, and may or may not use [[reverse transcriptase]] (RT). In addition, ssRNA viruses may be either [[sense (molecular biology)|sense]] (+) or antisense (−). This classification places viruses into seven groups:

{{Baltimore groups}}

As an example of viral classification, the [[chicken pox]] virus, [[varicella zoster]] (VZV), belongs to the order Herpesvirales, family ''[[Herpesviridae]]'', subfamily ''[[Alphaherpesvirinae]]'', and genus ''[[Varicellovirus]]''. VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification because it is a dsDNA virus that does not use reverse transcriptase.

Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the [[common cold]], influenza, [[chickenpox]], and [[cold sores]]. Many serious diseases such as [[ebola]], [[AIDS]], [[avian influenza]], and [[SARS]] are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of [[virulence]].

Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In [[multicellular organism]]s, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy [[homeostasis]], resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include the ability of the [[herpes simplex virus]], which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency<ref name="pmid17686862">{{vcite journal

===Epidemiology===
Viral [[epidemiology]] is the branch of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person.

[[Horizontal transmission]] is the most common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. Transmission can occur when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein-Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; [[aerosol]]s containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host, e.g., [[dengue]].
The rate or speed of transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include [[population density]], the number of susceptible individuals, (i.e., those not immune),<ref name="pmid15627236">{{vcite journal

Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of [[viral disease]]s.<ref>Shors p. 198</ref> Control measures are used that are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated from the rest of the community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in [[quarantine]].<ref>Shors pp. 199, 209</ref> To control the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|outbreak]] of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered.<ref>Shors p. 19</ref> Most viral infections of humans and other animals have [[incubation period]]s during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms.<ref>Shors p. 126</ref> Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections.<ref name="Shorspp">Shors pp. 193–194</ref> Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability &mdash; a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal.<ref name="Shorspp" /> This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks.<ref>Shors p. 194</ref> When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called [[epidemic]]s. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called [[pandemic]]s.<ref>Shors pp. 192–193</ref>

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] populations were devastated by contagious diseases, in particular, [[smallpox]], brought to the Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated to be close to 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.<ref>

A [[pandemic]] is a worldwide epidemic. The [[1918 flu pandemic]], which lasted until 1919, was a [[Pandemic Severity Index|category 5]] influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients.<ref>Collier pp. 409–415</ref> Older estimates say it killed 40–50&nbsp;million people,<ref name="Patterson1">{{vcite journal

[[File:Marburg virus.jpg|thumb|[[Marburg virus]]|alt=An electron micrograph of the filamentous Marburg virus]]

Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the ''[[Filoviridae]]''. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause [[viral hemorrhagic fever]], and include the [[ebola]] and [[marburg virus]]es. The Marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in [[Angola]]. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, the outbreak was the world's worst epidemic of any kind of viral hemorrhagic fever.<ref name="pmid16775337">{{vcite journal

===Cancer===
{{Details|Oncovirus}}

Viruses are an established cause of [[cancer]] in humans and other species. Viral cancers occur only in a minority of infected persons (or animals). Cancer viruses come from a range of virus families, including both RNA and DNA viruses, and so there is no single type of "[[oncovirus]]" (an obsolete term originally used for acutely transforming retroviruses). The development of cancer is determined by a variety of factors such as host immunity<ref name="pmid19467474">{{vcite journal |author=Einstein MH, Schiller JT, Viscidi RP, Strickler HD, Coursaget P, Tan T, Halsey N, Jenkins D |title=Clinician's guide to human papillomavirus immunology: knowns and unknowns |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=347–56 |year=2009 |pmid=19467474 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70108-2}}</ref> and mutations in the host.<ref name="pmid18812503">{{vcite journal |author=Shuda M, Feng H, Kwun HJ, Rosen ST, Gjoerup O, Moore PS, Chang Y |title=T antigen mutations are a human tumor-specific signature for Merkel cell polyomavirus |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=42 |pages=16272–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18812503 |pmc=2551627 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0806526105}}</ref> Viruses accepted to cause human cancers include some genotypes of [[human papillomavirus]], [[hepatitis B virus]], [[hepatitis C virus]], [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]] and [[human T-lymphotropic virus]].

===Host defence mechanisms===
{{see also|Immune system}}

The body's first line of defence against viruses is the [[innate immune system]]. This comprises cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that the cells of the innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the [[adaptive immune system]], it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.<ref name="Alberts">{{vcite book|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|coauthors=Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, and Peter Walters|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell; Fourth Edition|publisher=Garland Science|year=2002|location=New York and London|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=mboc4.TOC&depth=2|isbn=0-8153-3218-1|accessdate=15 September 2008}}</ref>

|pmc=2703654}}</ref> Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called [[dicer]] that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway called the RISC complex is activated, which degrades the viral mRNA and the cell survives the infection. Rotaviruses avoid this mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell and by releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. The genomic dsRNA remains protected inside the core of the virion.<ref name="pmid15579070">{{vcite journal

When the [[adaptive immune system]] of a [[vertebrate]] encounters a virus, it produces specific [[antibodies]] that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called [[humoral immunity]]. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]], is highly effective at neutralizing viruses but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]], is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past.<ref name="pmid8903801">{{vcite journal

Antibodies can continue to be an effective defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called [[TRIM21]], can attach to the antibodies on the surface of the virus particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell's [[proteosome]] system.<ref name="pmid21045130">{{cite journal |author=Mallery DL, McEwan WA, Bidgood SR, Towers GJ, Johnson CM, James LC |title=Antibodies mediate intracellular immunity through tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21) |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=107 |issue=46 |pages=19985–90 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=21045130 |pmc=2993423 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1014074107}}</ref>

A second defence of vertebrates against viruses is called [[cell-mediated immunity]] and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by ''killer T'' cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells such as the [[macrophage]] are specialists at this [[antigen presentation]].<ref name="pmid17725500">{{vcite journal

Not all virus infections produce a protective immune response in this way. [[HIV]] evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion. These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of [[antigen presentation]], [[cytokine]] resistance, evasion of [[natural killer cell]] activities, escape from [[apoptosis]], and antigenic shift.<ref name="pmid15297608">{{vcite journal

===Prevention and treatment===
Because viruses use vital metabolic pathways within host cells to replicate, they are difficult to eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are [[vaccination]]s to provide immunity to infection, and [[antiviral drugs]] that selectively interfere with viral replication.

====Vaccines====
{{Details|Vaccination}}

Vaccination is a cheap and effective way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as [[polio]], [[measles]], [[mumps]] and [[rubella]].<ref name="pmid17068034">{{vcite journal

Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogues]], (fake DNA building-blocks), which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during replication. The life-cycle of the virus is then halted because the newly synthesised DNA is inactive. This is because these analogues lack the [[hydroxyl]] groups, which, along with [[phosphorus]] atoms, link together to form the strong "backbone" of the DNA molecule. This is called DNA [[chain termination]].<ref name="pmid15592828">{{vcite journal

Other antiviral drugs in use target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on a proteolytic enzyme called the [[HIV-1 protease]] for it to become fully infectious. There is a large class of drugs called [[protease inhibitors]] that inactivate this enzyme.

Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are [[Infection|infected]] for the remainder of their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug [[ribavirin]] combined with [[interferon]].<ref name="pmid17927615">{{vcite journal

There are many types of plant virus, but often they cause only a loss of [[crop yield|yield]], and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by [[organism]]s, known as ''[[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]''. These are normally insects, but some [[fungi]], [[Nematode|nematode worms]], and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] have been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, for perennial fruits, for example, efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.<ref>Shors p. 584</ref> Plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only in living plant cells.<ref>Shors pp. 562–587</ref>

Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.<ref>{{vcite journal|author = Dinesh-Kumar SP, Tham Wai-Hong, Baker BJ|year= 2000|title = Structure—function analysis of the tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N|journal = PNAS|volume = 97|issue = 26| pages = 14789–94|pmid = 11121079|pmc = 18997|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.26.14789}}</ref> RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants.<ref>Shors pp. 573–576</ref> When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as [[salicylic acid]], [[nitric oxide]], and [[Reactive oxygen species|reactive oxygen molecules]].<ref>{{vcite journal|author = Soosaar JL, Burch-Smith TM, Dinesh-Kumar SP|year = 2005|title = Mechanisms of plant resistance to viruses|journal = Nat.

Plant virus particles or virus-like particles (VLPs) have applications in both [[biotechnology]] and [[nanotechnology]]. The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures and can be produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression in a variety of heterologous systems. Plant virus particles can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and can be incorporated into supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology.<ref name= LomonossoffGP>{{vcite book|author= Lomonossoff, GP|chapter = Virus Particles and the Uses of Such Particles in Bio- and Nanotechnology|year=2011|title=Recent Advances in Plant Virology|publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]]|isbn= 978-1-904455-75-2}}</ref>

===Bacteria===
{{Main|Bacteriophage}}

[[File:Phage.jpg|thumb|upright|Transmission electron micrograph of multiple bacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell wall|alt=An electron micrograph showing a portion of a bacterium covered with viruses]]

Bacteriophages are a common and diverse group of viruses and are the most abundant form of biological entity in aquatic environments&nbsp;– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria,<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Wommack KE, Colwell RR|title=Virioplankton: viruses in aquatic ecosystems|journal=Microbiol.

Rev.|volume=64|issue=1|pages=69–114|year=2000|pmid=10704475|pmc=98987|doi=10.1128/MMBR.64.1.69-114.2000}}</ref> reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per [[millilitre]] of seawater.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Bergh O, Børsheim KY, Bratbak G, Heldal M|title=High abundance of viruses found in aquatic environments|journal=Nature|volume=340|issue=6233|pages=467–8|year=1989|pmid=2755508|doi=10.1038/340467a0}}</ref> These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to [[receptor (biochemistry)|surface receptor molecules]] and then entering the cell. Within a short amount of time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial [[polymerase]] starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, in the case of the [[T4 phage]], in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.<ref>Shors pp. 595–97</ref>

The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called [[restriction endonucleases]], cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Bickle TA, Krüger DH|title=Biology of DNA restriction|journal=Microbiol.

==Role in aquatic ecosystems==
{{main|Marine bacteriophage}}
A teaspoon of seawater contains about one million viruses.<ref>Shors p. 4</ref> They are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems.<ref>Shors p. 5</ref> Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, comprising the most important mechanism of [[carbon cycle|recycling carbon]] in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulates fresh bacterial and algal growth.<ref>Shors p. 593</ref>

Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea. It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are 15 times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful [[algal bloom]]s,<ref name="pmid16163346">{{vcite journal |author=Suttle CA |title=Viruses in the sea |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7057 |pages=356–61 |year=2005 |pmid=16163346 |doi=10.1038/nature04160}}</ref> which often kill other marine life.<ref>

The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms.<ref name="pmid17853907">{{vcite journal |author=Suttle CA |title=Marine viruses—major players in the global ecosystem |journal=Nature Reviews. Microbiology |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=801–12 |year=2007 |pmid=17853907 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1750}}</ref>

The effects of marine viruses are far-reaching; by increasing the amount of [[photosynthesis]] in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere by approximately 3 [[gigatonne]]s of carbon per year.<ref name="pmid17853907"/>

Like any organism, [[marine mammal]]s are susceptible to viral infections. In 1988 and 2002, thousands of [[harbor seal]]s were killed in Europe by [[phocine distemper virus]].<ref>Hall, A. J., Jepson, P. D., Goodman, S. J. & Harkonen, T. "Phocine distemper virus in the North and European Seas&nbsp;— data and models, nature and nurture". Biol.

==Role in evolution==
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}
Viruses are an important natural means of transferring genes between different species, which increases [[genetic diversity]] and drives evolution.<ref name = "Canchaya">{{vcite journal|author=Canchaya C, Fournous G, Chibani-Chennoufi S, Dillmann ML, Brüssow H|title=Phage as agents of lateral gene transfer|journal=Curr.

==Applications==

===Life sciences and medicine===
[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Scientist studying the [[H5N1]] influenza virus]]

Viruses are important to the study of [[molecular biology|molecular]] and [[cell biology]] as they provide simple systems that can be used to manipulate and investigate the functions of cells.<ref>Collier p.8</ref> The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about aspects of cell biology.<ref>Lodish, Harvey; Berk, Arnold; Zipursky, S. Lawrence; Matsudaira, Paul; Baltimore, David; Darnell, James.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Viruses&rid=mcb.section.1408#1422 Viruses:Structure, Function, and Uses] Retrieved on September 16, 2008</ref> For example, viruses have been useful in the study of [[genetics]] and helped our understanding of the basic mechanisms of [[molecular genetics]], such as [[DNA replication]], [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[RNA processing]], [[translation (genetics)|translation]], [[protein]] transport, and [[immunology]].

Geneticists often use viruses as [[vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] to introduce genes into cells that they are studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, [[virotherapy]] uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use in the treatment of cancer and in [[gene therapy]]. Eastern European scientists have used [[phage therapy]] as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of [[antibiotic resistance]] now found in some pathogenic bacteria.<ref name="pmid16258815">{{vcite journal |author=Matsuzaki S, Rashel M, Uchiyama J, Sakurai S, Ujihara T, Kuroda M, Ikeuchi M, Tani T, Fujieda M, Wakiguchi H, Imai S |title=Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases |journal=Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy : Official Journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=211–9 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16258815 |doi=10.1007/s10156-005-0408-9}}</ref>
Expression of heterologous proteins by viruses is the basis of several manufacturing processes that are currently being used for the production of various proteins such as vaccine [[antigen]]s and antibodies. Industrial processes have been recently developed using viral vectors and a number of pharmaceutical proteins are currently in pre-clinical and clinical trials.<ref name= GlebaYY>{{vcite book|author= Gleba, YY; Giritch, A|chapter = Plant Viral Vectors for Protein Expression|year=2011|title=Recent Advances in Plant Virology|publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]]|isbn= 978-1-904455-75-2}}</ref>

===Materials science and nanotechnology===
Current trends in nanotechnology promise to make much more versatile use of viruses. From the viewpoint of a materials scientist, viruses can be regarded as organic nanoparticles.
Their surface carries specific tools designed to cross the barriers of their host cells. The size and shape of viruses, and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface, is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.<ref name="fischlechner">{{vcite journal

Because of their size, shape, and well-defined chemical structures, viruses have been used as templates for organizing materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], using Cowpea Mosaic Virus ([[CPMV]]) particles to amplify signals in [[DNA microarray]] based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[dye]]s used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]] that act as [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenchers]].<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Soto CM, Blum AS, Vora GJ, ''et al.''|title=Fluorescent signal amplification of carbocyanine dyes using engineered viral nanoparticles|journal=J.

===Synthetic viruses===
Many viruses can be synthesized de novo ("from scratch") and the first synthetic virus was created in 2002.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Cello J, Paul AV, Wimmer E |title=Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5583 |pages=1016–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12114528 |doi=10.1126/science.1072266}}</ref> Although somewhat of a misconception, it is not the actual virus that is synthesized, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a [[cDNA]] copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies.<ref name=Coleman>{{vcite journal |author= Coleman JR, Papamichail D, Skiena S, Futcher B, Wimmer E, Mueller S |title=Virus attenuation by genome-scale changes in codon pair bias |journal=Science |volume=320 |issue=5884 |pages=1784–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18583614|pmc=2754401 |doi= 10.1126/science.1155761}}</ref> The ability to synthesize viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and [[permissive]] cells are available. Currently, the full-length genome sequences of 2408 different viruses (including smallpox) are publicly available at an online database, maintained by the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Genomes |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesHome.cgi?taxid=10239 |title=NIH viral genome database |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref>

===Weapons===
{{Details|Biological warfare}}

The ability of viruses to cause devastating [[epidemic]]s in human societies has led to the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory.<ref>Shors p. 331</ref> The [[smallpox]] virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are {{clarify span|officially|Are there other "unofficial" repositories?|date=May 2013}} only two centers in the world that keep stocks of smallpox virus: the [[Vector Institute]] in [[Russia]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in the [[United States]].<ref name="pmid18844596">{{vcite journal|author = Artenstein AW, Grabenstein JD|title = Smallpox vaccines for biodefense: need and feasibility|journal = Expert Review of Vaccines|volume = 7|issue = 8|pages = 1225–37|year = 2008|pmid = 18844596|doi = 10.1586/14760584.7.8.1225}}</ref> But fears that it may be used as a weapon are not totally unfounded;<ref name="pmid18844596"/> the vaccine for smallpox has sometimes severe side-effects&nbsp;– during the last years before the eradication of smallpox disease more people became seriously ill as a result of vaccination than did people from smallpox<ref name="pmid12911836">{{vcite journal
