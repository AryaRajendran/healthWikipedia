An '''intraventricular hemorrhage''' (or intraventricular haemorrhage in British English), often abbreviated "IVH," is a bleeding into the brain's [[ventricular system]], where the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] is produced and circulates through towards the [[subarachnoid space]].  It can result from [[physical trauma]] or from hemorrhaging in [[stroke]].

==In infants==
This type of hemorrhage is particularly common in infants, especially [[Premature birth|premature]] infants or those of very low birth weight.<ref name="Annibale and Hill">Annibale DJ and Hill J.  2006. [http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2595.htm Periventricular Hemorrhage-Intraventricular Hemorrhage]. Emedicine.com. Retrieved on June 19, 2007.</ref>  The cause of IVH in premature infants, unlike that in older infants, children or adults, is rarely due to trauma.  Instead it is thought to result from changes in perfusion of the delicate cellular structures that are present in the growing brain, augmented by the immaturity of the cerebral circulatory system, which is especially vulnerable to hypoxic ischemic [[encephalopathy]].  The lack of blood flow results in cell death and subsequent breakdown of the blood vessel walls, leading to bleeding.  While this bleeding can result in further injury, it is itself a marker for injury that has already occurred.  Most intraventricular hemorrhages occur in the first 72 hours after birth.<ref name="Annibale and Hill"/> The risk is increased with use of [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] in preterm infants.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2004.07.010 |title=Post-conceptional age and IVH in ECMO patients |year=2004 |last1=Jobe |first1=Alan H. |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=145 |issue=2 |pages=A2}}</ref>

The amount of bleeding varies. IVH is often described in four grades:

* Grade I - bleeding occurs just in the [[germinal matrix]].
* Grade II - bleeding also occurs inside the ventricles.
* Grade III - ventricles are enlarged by the blood.
* Grade IV - there is bleeding into the brain tissues around the ventricles.

Grades I and II are most common, and often there are no further complications. Grades III and IV are the most serious and may result in long-term brain injury to the infant. After a grade III or IV IVH, blood clots may form which can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to increased fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus).

There have been various therapies employed into preventing the high rates of morbidity and mortality, including diuretic therapy,<ref name = "Whitelaw et al (2008) Diuretic therapy for newborn infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002270 |chapter=Diuretic therapy for newborn infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2001 |last1=Whitelaw |first1=Andrew |last2=Brion |first2=Luc P |last3=Kennedy |first3=Colin R |last4=Odd |first4=David |editor1-last=Whitelaw |editor1-first=Andrew}}</ref> repeated lumbar puncture,<ref name="Whitelaw et al (2009) Repeated lumbar or ventricular punctures in newborns with intraventricular hemorrhage">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000216 |chapter=Repeated lumbar or ventricular punctures in newborns with intraventricular hemorrhage |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2001 |last1=Whitelaw |first1=Andrew |editor1-last=Whitelaw |editor1-first=Andrew}}</ref> streptokinase therapy <ref name = "Whitelaw et al 2008 Intraventricular streptokinase after intraventricular hemorrhage in newborn infants" >{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000498.pub2 |chapter=Intraventricular streptokinase after intraventricular hemorrhage in newborn infants |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Whitelaw |first1=Andrew |last2=Odd |first2=David |last3=Brion |first3=Luc P |last4=Kennedy |first4=C R |editor1-last=Whitelaw |editor1-first=Andrew}}</ref> and most recently combination a novel intervention called DRIFT (drainage, irrigation and fibrinolytic therapy).

DRIFT has been tested in an international randomised clinical trial; although it did not significantly lower the need for shunt surgery, severe cognitive disability at two years Bayley (MDI <55) was significantly reduced.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=e852–8 |doi=10.1542/peds.2009-1960 |title=Randomized Trial of Drainage, Irrigation and Fibrinolytic Therapy for Premature Infants with Posthemorrhagic Ventricular Dilatation: Developmental Outcome at 2 years |year=2010 |last1=Whitelaw |first1=A. |last2=Jary |first2=S. |last3=Kmita |first3=G. |last4=Wroblewska |first4=J. |last5=Musialik-Swietlinska |first5=E. |last6=Mandera |first6=M. |last7=Hunt |first7=L. |last8=Carter |first8=M. |last9=Pople |first9=I. |journal=Pediatrics |volume=125 |issue=4 |pmid=20211949}}</ref> Repeated lumbar punctures are used widely to reduce the effects in increased intracranial pressure and an alternative to ventriculo-shunt (VP) surgery that cannot be performed in case of intraventricular haemorrhage.

Prognosis is also very poor when IVH results from [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] related to [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and is even worse when [[hydrocephalus]] follows.<ref name="Yadav07"/>  It can result in dangerous increases in [[intracranial pressure]] and can cause potentially fatal [[brain herniation]].<ref name="Yadav07"/>

[[Brain contusion]]s and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]s are commonly associated with IVH.<ref name="LeRoux">{{cite journal |doi=10.1227/00006123-199210000-00010 |title=Intraventricular Hemorrhage in Blunt Head Trauma |year=1992 |last1=Leroux |first1=Peter D. |last2=Haglund |first2=Michael M. |last3=Newell |first3=David W. |last4=Grady |first4=M.
