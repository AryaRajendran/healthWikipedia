Several therapies for [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) exist, although there is no known cure. Multiple sclerosis is a [[chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[demyelinating disease]] that affects the [[Central Nervous System|central nervous system]] (CNS).

The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks ([[relapse]]s) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a [[diagnosis]] of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS. 

The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS may have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]], and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different [[Alternative medicine|alternative treatments]] are pursued by many patients, despite the paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.

This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; [[idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases|borderline forms of MS]] have particular treatments that are excluded.

== Management of acute attacks ==
[[File:Methylprednisolone.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids are used during acute multiple sclerosis relapses.]]

Administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]], is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered over a period of three to five days, and has a well-established [[efficacy]] in promoting a faster recovery from [[disability]] after an attack.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sellebjerg F, Barnes D, Filippini G, ''et al.'' |title=EFNS guideline on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses: report of an EFNS task force on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses |journal=Eur.

== Disease-modifying treatments ==
[[File:Injection 23.JPG|thumb|Disease-modifying treatments are expensive and most require frequent (up-to-daily) injections, under the skin or into the muscle. Newer treatments feature intravenous (IV) infusions (shown above) at 1 to 3-month intervals.]]
As of April 2013, eight disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries, including the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) and the Japanese [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|PMDA]]. 

The approved drugs with their trademarks are [[interferon beta-1a]] (Avonex, Rebif, CinnoVex, ReciGen), [[interferon beta-1b]] (Betaseron), [[glatiramer acetate]] (Copaxone), [[mitoxantrone]] (Novantrone), [[natalizumab]] (Tysabri),  [[fingolimod]] (Gilenya), [[teriflunomide]] (Aubagio)<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name=Fingolimod>{{cite press release |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm226755.htm|title=FDA approves first oral drug to reduce MS relapses  |publisher=US FDA |date=2010-09-22|accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref><ref name=Aubagio>{{cite press release |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm319277.htm |title=FDA approves new multiple sclerosis treatment Aubagio |publisher=US FDA|date=2012-09-12 | accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref> and [[dimethyl fumarate]] (BG12, Tecfidera).<ref name=fumarate>{{cite news|title=Biogen Idec’s TECFIDERA™ (Dimethyl Fumarate) Approved in US as a First-Line Oral Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis|url=http://www.biogenidec.com/press_release_details.aspx?ID=5981&ReqId=1801165|date=2013-03-27|agency=Biogen Idec Press Release}}</ref><ref name="FDA fumarate">{{cite web |title=NDA 204063 - FDA Approved Labeling Text |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/204063lbl.pdf |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2013 |publisher=US Food and Drug Agency }}<br>{{cite web  |title=NDA Approval |date=27 March 2013 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2013/204063Orig1s000ltr.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2013 |publisher=US Food and Drug Agency }}</ref>

Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of random polymers of four amino acids which is antigenically similar to the [[myelin basic protein]], a component of the myelin sheath of nerves with which it competes for presentation to T cells . It is injected subcutaneously on a daily basis.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Arnon, R., & Aharoni|title=Mechanism of action of glatiramer acetate in multiple sclerosis and its potential for the development of new applications|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2004|volume=101|pages=14593–14598}}</ref><ref name="glatiramer">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a603016.html Glatiramer injection.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) (2003-07-01).

Mitoxantrone is an [[immunosuppressant]] also used in [[chemotherapy|cancer chemotherapy]] which was approved for MS in the year 2000;<ref name="pmid20439849"/> whereas natalizumab is a [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] that was initially approved in 2004.<ref name='"pmid21777829"'/> Both are given by intravenous infusion at monthly intervals in the case of natalizumab and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone.<ref name="pmid20439849"/><ref name="natalizumab">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605006.html Natalizumab Injection.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) (2006-10-01).

In 2010 fingolimod, a [[S1PR1|sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor]] modulator, became the first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of [[pyrimidine]] and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell.<ref name="Fingolimod"/><ref name="Aubagio"/><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Zeyda M, Poglitsch M, Geyeregger R, Smolen JS, Zlabinger GJ, Hörl WH, Waldhäusl W, Stulnig TM, Säemann MD|title=Disruption of the interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells by the active leflunomide metabolite teriflunomide: involvement of impaired integrin activation and immunologic synapse formation|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=2005|volume=52|issue=9|pages=2730}}</ref><ref name="pmid22014437"/> Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose.<ref name=Aubagio/><ref>{{cite book|title=Gylenya medication guide|year=2012|publisher=Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation|url=http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/cs/www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/gilenya.pdf|accessdate=2013-01-21|page=2|format=pdf|month=May}}</ref> In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate, was approved by the FDA. Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily.<ref name="FDA fumarate"/>

Another oral drug, [[cladribine]], was approved in Russia and Australia in 2010. Its application was rejected by the FDA and EMEA in 2011 due to safety concerns in spite of the promising efficacy of the drug. This led the pharmaceutical to discontinue commercialization and withdraw all marketing applications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Comi|first=G|coauthors=Hartung, HP; Kurukulasuriya, NC; Greenberg, SJ; Scaramozza, M|title=Cladribine tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.|journal=Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy|date=2013 Jan|volume=14|issue=1|pages=123–36|pmid=23256518}}</ref>

Most of these drugs are approved only for Relapsing-Remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

==== Side effects ====
[[File:Implant.png|right|thumb|Injectable medications can produce irritation or bruises at injection site. The bruise depicted was produced by a subcutaneous injection.]]

Both the interferons and glatiramer acetate are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause skin reactions at the injection site, specially with subcutaneous administration.<ref name=pmid10563602/><ref name="pmid20687620"/> Skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation and may include bruising, [[erythema]], pain, [[pruritus]], irritation, swelling and in the most extreme cases cutaneous [[necrosis]].<ref name=pmid10563602/><ref name="pmid20687620"/>  They usually appear within the first month of treatment albeit their frequence and importance diminish after six months of use.<ref name=pmid10563602/> Mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas necroses appear in around 5% of patients and lead to the discontinuation of the therapy.<ref name=pmid10563602/><ref name=pmid10563602/> Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as [[lipoatrophy]], may develop.<ref name=pmid10563602/><ref name=pmid10563602/>

[[Interferon]]s, a subclass of [[cytokines]], are produced in the body during illnesses such as [[influenza]] in order to help fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including [[fever]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[headache]]s.<ref name='pmid16253889'>{{cite journal|last=Eccles|first=R|title=Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza.|journal=The Lancet infectious diseases|date=2005 Nov|volume=5|issue=11|pages=718–25|pmid=16253889}}</ref> Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name=pmid10563602>{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=EU|coauthors=Hohlfeld, R|title=Multiple sclerosis: side effects of interferon beta therapy and their management.|journal=Neurology|date=1999 Nov 10|volume=53|issue=8|pages=1622–7|pmid=10563602}}</ref> This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, such as [[ibuprofen]], that reduce fever and pain.<ref name=pmid10563602/> Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease.<ref name=pmid10563602/> Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress ([[Uhthoff's phenomenon]]), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days.<ref name=pmid10563602/> A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is [[spasticity]].<ref name=pmid10563602/> Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of [[white blood cell]]s ([[leukopenia]]), [[lymphocyte]]s ([[lymphopenia]]) and [[neutrophil]]s ([[neutropenia]]), as well as affect [[liver]] function.<ref name=pmid10563602/> In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment.<ref name=pmid10563602/> Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory [[Blood test|blood analyses]], including [[liver function tests]], to ensure safe use of interferons.<ref name=pmid10563602/>

Glatiramer acetate is generally well tolerated.<ref name="pmid20687620">{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Natalie J.|coauthors=Keating, Gillian M.|title=Glatiramer Acetate|journal=Drugs|date=1 August 2010|volume=70|issue=12|pages=1545–1577|doi=10.2165/11204560-000000000-00000|pmid=20687620}}</ref> The most common secondary effect with glatiramer acetate after skin problem is a post-injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart [[palpitation]]s, breathlessness, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes and does not require of additional treatment.<ref name="pmid20687620"/><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite journal |author=Munari L, Lovati R, Boiko A |title=Therapy with glatiramer acetate for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004678 |year=2004 |pmid=14974077 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004678 |editor1-last=Munari |editor1-first=Luca M.}}</ref>

Mitoxantrone therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related [[cardiotoxicity|cardiac toxicity]]. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]] is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an [[echocardiogram]] and a [[complete blood count]] before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, [[infection]] or liver dysfunction during therapy.<ref name="pmid16750460">{{cite journal |author=Fox EJ |title=Management of worsening multiple sclerosis with mitoxantrone: a review |journal=Clinical therapeutics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=461–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16750460 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.013}}</ref>

=== Clinically isolated syndrome ===
The earliest clinical presentation of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack of a single symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of [[demyelination]] but the patient does not fulfill the [[McDonald criteria|criteria]] for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.<ref name="pmid15847841">{{cite journal |author=Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M |title=Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=281–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15847841 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70071-5}}</ref> Treatment with [[interferon]]s or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases the risk of developing clinical definite MS.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name='pmid21205678'>{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=D|title=Treatment effects of immunomodulatory therapies at different stages of multiple sclerosis in short-term trials.|journal=Neurology|date=2011 Jan 4|volume=76|issue=1 Suppl 1|pages=S14-25|pmid=21205678}}</ref>

=== Relapsing-remitting MS ===
Medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using [[gadolinium]]-[[MRI contrast agent|enhanced]] [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies.

Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are considered highly effective both in terms of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments.

Even with appropriate use of medication, to varying degrees most patients with relapsing-remitting MS still suffer from some attacks and many suffer subsequent disability.

=== Secondary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS ===
[[File:Mitoxantrone skeletal.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of mitoxantrone]]

Treatment of advanced forms of MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS. A wide range of medications have been used to try to slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair.

Mitoxantrone has shown positive effects in patients with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in patients in short-term follow-up.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |author=Martinelli Boneschi F, Rovaris M, Capra R, Comi G |title=Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002127 |year=2005 |pmid=16235298 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002127.pub2 |editor1-last=Martinelli Boneschi |editor1-first=Filippo}}</ref> In 2007 it was the only medication approved in the USA for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent [[cardiotoxicity|cardiac toxicity]] which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe. Natalizumab has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. Studies on the use of Interferon-beta-1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing  MS do not support that it slows progression of the disease, although it is effective in reducing the number of relapses.<ref>{{cite cochrane|last=La Mantia|first=L|coauthors=Vacchi, L; Di Pietrantonj, C; Ebers, G; Rovaris, M; Fredrikson, S; Filippini, G|title=Interferon beta for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Jan 18|issue=1|review=CD005181|pmid=22258960}}</ref>

=== Primary progressive MS ===
Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients do not respond to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or [[riluzole]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696013.html Riluzole.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) (2003-04-01).

== Managing the effects of MS ==
Disease-modifying treatments only reduce the progression rate of the disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and [[Disability|handicap]]. Management of these deficits is therefore very important. 

Both drug therapy and [[neurorehabilitation]] have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, even though neither influence disease progression. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.<ref name="pmid16168933">{{cite journal |author=Kesselring J, Beer S |title=Symptomatic therapy and neurorehabilitation in multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=643–52 |year=2005 |pmid=16168933 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70193-9}}</ref>

An elevated core temperature, leading to increased symptom presentation has been noted during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS during the course of exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=SL|coauthors=Wilson, TE, White, AT, Frohman, EM|title=Thermoregulation in multiple sclerosis.|journal=Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)|date=2010 Nov|volume=109|issue=5|pages=1531–7|pmid=20671034|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00460.2010|pmc=2980380}}</ref> The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.

=== Medical treatments for symptoms ===
{{Further2|[[Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms]]}}

Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation ([[hypoesthesia]]), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as [[dysarthria]]) or swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), visual problems ([[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]], or [[diplopia]]), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and acute or chronic [[pain]] syndromes, [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[bowel]] difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly [[clinical depression|depression]]). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on the patient and the physician.

{{Main|Therapies under investigation for multiple sclerosis}}

Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. There are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Some of these treatments involve the combination of drugs that are already in use for multiple sclerosis, such as the joint administration of [[mitoxantrone]] and [[glatiramer acetate]] (''Copaxone'').<ref>[http://www.mxga-mstrial.co.uk/ United Kingdom early Mitoxantrone Copaxone trial.] Onyx Healthcare (2006-01-01).

The Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) that was proposed by Paolo Zamboni in 2009 as a treatment for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), is a controversial condition characterized anomalies of cerebrospinal veins that interfere with venous drainage from the brain.<ref name="CCSVI">{{cite journal|authors=Awad, A.

The first report from Zamboni was an open-label study of 65 patients with MS who met criteria for CCSVI where they found that PTA was associated with significant improvement in some MS outcome measures, particularly for 35 patients with relapsing-remitting MS.<ref>{{cite journal|authours=Zamboni, P., Galeotti, R., Menegatti, E., Malagoni, A.

== Alternative treatments ==
A recent study found that over 60% of MS patients use [[complementary and alternative medicine]], possibly because conventional treatments lack effectiveness. Except for vitamin D, evidence is lacking for these treatments and there are no clear guidelines for their use.<ref name=pmid18631428/>

The effect of [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] on MS is unclear, with studies unable to show whether diet contributes to MS or can alter its course. Ecologic studies have found a link between high consumptions of [[polyunsaturated fat]]s and low MS prevalence. The most promising evidence comes from daily supplementation with [[vitamin D]]. Evidence is lacking for several other widely promoted non-herbal supplements, including [[vitamin B12]], [[alpha-lipoic acid]], [[luteolin]], and [[evening primrose oil]].<ref name=pmid18631428>{{cite journal |author= Namaka M, Crook A, Doupe A ''et al.'' |title= Examining the evidence: complementary adjunctive therapies for multiple sclerosis |journal= Neurol Res |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=710–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18631428 |doi=10.1179/174313208X325038}}</ref> Many diets have been proposed for treating the symptoms of the disease.

[[Bee venom therapy]] has been promoted as a possible treatment for MS, as it is thought to be an anti-inflammatory and inflammation is a component of MS.
