'''Andrew Jeremy Wakefield''' (born 1957) is a British former surgeon and medical researcher, known for his fraudulent 1998 research paper in support of the now-[[MMR vaccine controversy|discredited claim]] that there is a link between the administration of the [[MMR vaccine|measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine]] and the appearance of [[autism]] and bowel disease.<ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ/><ref name=retractions/><ref name=Time_great_frauds/>

On 28 February 1998, a paper written by Wakefield and twelve other authors about twelve [[autism spectrum|autistic]] children was published in ''The Lancet''.<ref name="WakefieldMMRPaper">{{cite journal |author=Wakefield AJ |title=Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–41 |date= 28 February 1998 |pmid=9500320|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673697110960/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 |author-separator=, |author2=Murch SH |author3=Anthony A |display-authors=3 |last4=Linnell |first4=J |last5=Casson |first5=DM |last6=Malik |first6=M |last7=Berelowitz |first7=M |last8=Dhillon |first8=AP |last9=Thomson |first9=MA}}{{Retracted paper|intentional=yes}}</ref>  In it, the authors claimed to have identified a new [[syndrome]] which they called [[autistic enterocolitis]], raising the possibility of a link between a novel form of bowel disease, autism, and the MMR vaccine. The authors noted that the parents of eight of the twelve children linked what were described as "behavioural symptoms" with MMR, and reported that the onset of these symptoms began within two weeks of MMR vaccination.<ref name="WakefieldMMRPaper"/> In the published ''The Lancet'' summary, known as the "interpretation", the authors wrote:

:"We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers."<ref name="WakefieldMMRPaper"/>

These possible triggers were reported to be MMR in eight cases, and measles infection in one. The paper was instantly controversial, leading to widespread publicity in the UK and the convening of a special panel of the UK's [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] the following month.<ref>{{cite web | title = Wakefield misled top UK medical research hearing over where he got MMR children (MRC documents) | author =Deer, Brian | date = 23 March 1998 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/wakefield-mrc.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-10 |publisher=briandeer.com | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070810191050/http://briandeer.com/mmr/wakefield-mrc.htm| archivedate= 10 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> One study done based in Japan found that there was no causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism in groups of children given the triple MMR vaccine and children who received individual measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations.

<!--The controversy escalated as the UK government declined to introduce single-jab alternatives (which would have required licenced products to become available), based on the contention most closely associated with Dr David Salisbury, UK director of immunisation, that the risk of prolonging the period before children were immunised against all three diseases was greater than any credible risk of harm from combining them. Single vaccines, spaced a year apart, would expose children to greater risk of infection, as well as additional distress and expense. He stated that no evidence had been produced upon which to adopt such a policy.-->

=== Aftermath of initial controversy ===

Wakefield continued conducting clinical research in the United States after leaving the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in December 2001. He joined a controversial American researcher, Jeffrey Bradstreet, at the International Child Development Resource Center, to conduct further studies on the possible relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-quack.htm |title=Brian Deer investigates MMR – Wakefield links |author=Deer, Brian |publisher=briandeer.com |accessdate=2010-04-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100505184934/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-quack.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 2004, Wakefield started work at the [[Thoughtful House]] research center in Austin, Texas.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article4837798.ece | title = MMR row doctor Andrew Wakefield spreads fear to US |work=The Times | location=London | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=2010-04-25 | author= Harlow, John}}</ref> Wakefield served as Executive Director of Thoughtful House until February 2010, when he resigned in the wake of findings against him by the British [[General Medical Council]].<ref name="thoughtful-house-resignation"/><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/feb/19/wakefield-quits-texas-autism-centre | title = MMR vaccine doctor Andrew Wakefield quits autism centre |work=The Guardian | date = 19 February 2010 | location=London | author= Jones, Aidan  | accessdate=2010-04-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100407154235/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/feb/19/wakefield-quits-texas-autism-centre| archivedate= 7 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In February 2004, controversy resurfaced when Wakefield was accused of a conflict of interest. The ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' reported that some of the parents of the 12 children in the study in ''The Lancet'' were recruited via a UK lawyer preparing a lawsuit against MMR manufacturers, and that the Royal Free Hospital had received £55,000 from the UK's Legal Aid Board (now the [[Legal Services Commission]]) to pay for the research.<ref>{{cite news | author = Deer, Brian | title = Revealed: MMR Research Scandal |work=The Sunday Times| publisher= briandeer.com |date = 22 February 2004 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-deer-1.htm | format = Reprint | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070808103704/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-deer-1.htm| archivedate= 8 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Previously, in October 2003, the board had cut off public funding for the litigation against MMR manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web | title = Taxpayer cash for MMR action is stopped after £15m that stoked fear was spent | author = Deer, Brian | publisher= briandeer.com | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-lsc.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070810191523/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-lsc.htm| archivedate= 10 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Following an investigation of ''The Sunday Times'' allegations by the UK General Medical Council, Wakefield was charged with serious professional misconduct, including dishonesty.<ref>{{cite news | author = Deer, Brian | title = MMR Scare Doctor Faces List of Charges |work=The Sunday Times |location= London | date = 11 September 2005 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article565188.ece | accessdate = 2009-03-29 }}</ref> In December 2006, the ''Sunday Times'' further reported that in addition to the money they gave the Royal Free Hospital, the lawyers responsible for the MMR lawsuit had paid Wakefield personally more than £400,000, which he had not previously disclosed.<ref name="MMRAidMoney">{{cite news | author = Deer, Brian | title = MMR doctor given legal aid thousands |work=The Times | date = 31 December 2006 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-dec-2006.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | location=London}}</ref>

Twenty-four hours before the 2004 ''Sunday Times'' report, ''The Lancet'' responded to the investigation in a public statement, describing Wakefield's research as "fatally flawed". ''The Lancet's'' editor said he believed the paper would have been rejected as biased if the peer reviewers had been aware of Wakefield's conflict of interest.<ref name="bbc-02-2004">{{cite news | title = Lead researcher defends MMR study |publisher=BBC News | date = 22 February 2004 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3510721.stm | accessdate = 2007-08-10 }}</ref> Ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors of the paper in ''The Lancet''  later published a retraction of an interpretation:<ref name=PMID15016483>{{cite journal |author=Murch SH |title=Retraction of an interpretation |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |page=750 |year=2004 |pmid=15016483 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2 |author-separator=, |author2=Anthony A |author3=Casson DH |display-authors=3 |last4=Malik |first4=Mohsin |last5=Berelowitz |first5=Mark |last6=Dhillon |first6=Amar P |last7=Thomson |first7=Michael A |last8=Valentine |first8=Alan |last9=Davies |first9=Susan E}}</ref> The section of the paper retracted read as follows:

=== Wakefield v Channel 4 and others ===

In November 2004, [[Channel 4]] broadcast a one-hour ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' investigation by reporter [[Brian Deer]]; the ''Toronto Star'' said Deer had "produced documentary evidence that Wakefield applied for a patent on a single-jab measles vaccine before his campaign against the MMR vaccine, raising questions about his motives".<ref name=RossStarFraudulent/><ref name=patent>'''Patent applications'''<p>{{cite web | title = Revealed: the first Wakefield MMR patent claim describes "safer measles vaccine" | author = Deer, Brian| url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm | publisher= briandeer.com | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070809105007/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm| archivedate= 9 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}<p>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6534259.pdf Vaccine patent application]</ref>

In addition to Wakefield's unpublished initial patent submission,<ref name=patent/> Deer released a copy of the published patent application.<ref>{{cite web | title = UK Patent Application GB 2 325 856 A | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/1998-vaccine-patent.pdf}}</ref> At page 1, the first paragraph of this stated:

: "The present invention relates to a new vaccine/immunisation for the prevention and/or prophylaxis against measles virus infection and to a pharmaceutical or therapeutic composition for the treatment of IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease); particularly Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis and regressive behavioural disease (RBD) (also referred to as "Pervasive Developmental Disorder)."

Before describing the research in Wakefield's 1998 paper in ''The Lancet'', at the same page this patent explicitly states that the use of the MMR vaccine causes autism:

: "It has now also been shown that use of the MMR vaccine (which is taken to include live attenuated measles vaccine virus, measles virus, mumps vaccine virus and rubella vaccine virus, and wild strains of the aforementioned viruses) results in ileal lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, chronic colitis and pervasive developmental disorder including autism (RBD), in some infants."

According to Deer, a letter from Wakefield's lawyers to him dated 31 Jan 2005 said: "Dr Wakefield did not plan a rival vaccine."<!-- See bottom of patent copy. --><ref name=patent/>

In the Dispatches programme, Deer also revealed that Nicholas Chadwick, a researcher working under Wakefield's supervision in the Royal Free medical school, had failed to find measles virus in the children reported on in ''The Lancet''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Molecular testing in Wakefield's own lab rebutted the basis for his attack on MMR | author = Deer, Brian | url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/nick-chadwick.htm | publisher= briandeer.com | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070809174125/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/nick-chadwick.htm| archivedate= 9 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In January 2005, Wakefield initiated libel proceedings against Channel&nbsp;4, the independent production company [[Twenty Twenty]] and Brian Deer. At the same time, Wakefield issued libel proceedings against ''The Sunday Times'', and against Deer personally over his website briandeer.com.<ref name="briandeer.com">{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/ |title=Selected Investigations & Journalism |publisher=Brian Deer |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> Within weeks of issuing his claims, however, Wakefield sought to have the action frozen until after the conclusion of General Medical Council proceedings against him. Fighting back, Channel&nbsp;4 and Deer obtained a High Court order compelling Wakefield to continue with his action, or discontinue it. After a hearing in court on 27 and 28 October 2005, Mr Justice [[David Eady]] ruled against a [[Stay of proceedings]], stating:

: "It thus appears that the Claimant wishes to use the existence of the libel proceedings for public relations purposes, and to deter other critics, while at the same time isolating himself from the “downside” of such litigation, in having to answer a substantial defence of justification."

He also said in his judgment: 

:"I am quite satisfied, therefore, that the Claimant wished to extract whatever advantage he could from the existence of the proceedings while not wishing to progress them or to give the Defendants an opportunity of meeting the claims."<ref name=Judgment>{{cite web | title = Approved Judgment in the case of Andrew Wakefield vs. Channel Four Television Corporation, Twenty Twenty Productions Ltd., and Brian Deer | publisher = [[BAILII|British and Irish Legal Information Institute]] | date = 4 November 2005 | url = http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2005/2410.html | accessdate = 2007-08-10 }}</ref>

The judgment identified Channel&nbsp;4's "very lengthy extracts" regarding Wakefield, where Deer's allegations are that he had:<ref name=Judgment/>

:i) Spread fear that the MMR vaccine might lead to autism, even though he knew that his own laboratory had carried out tests whose results dramatically contradicted his claims in that the measles virus had not been found in a single one of the children concerned in his study and he knew or ought to have known that there was absolutely no basis at all for his belief that the MMR should be broken up into single vaccines.

:(ii) In spreading such fear, acted dishonestly and for mercenary motives in that, although he improperly failed to disclose the fact, he planned a rival vaccine and products (such as a diagnostic kit based on his theory) that could have made his fortune.

:(iii) Gravely abused the children under his care by unethically carrying out extensive invasive procedures (on occasions requiring three people to hold a child down), thereby driving nurses to leave and causing his medical colleagues serious concern and unhappiness.

:(iv) Improperly and/or dishonestly failed to disclose to his colleagues and to the public at large that his research on autistic children had begun with a contract with solicitors which were trying to sue the manufacturers of the MMR vaccine.

:(v) Improperly and/or dishonestly lent his reputation to the International Child Development Resource Centre which promoted to very vulnerable parents expensive products for whose efficacy (as he knew or should have known) there was no scientific evidence.

Mr Justice Eady's ruling states that "...the views or conclusions of the GMC disciplinary body would not, so far as I can tell, be relevant or admissible...", that Channel 4's allegations "...go to undermine fundamentally the Claimant's professional integrity and honesty..." and that "It cannot seriously be suggested that priority should be given to GMC proceedings for the resolution of issues...".

Other proceedings continued for two years, but in December 2006, Deer reported figures obtained from the Legal Services Commission showing that it had paid £435,643 in undisclosed fees to Wakefield for him to build a case against the  MMR vaccine,<ref>{{cite web | title = Revealed: undisclosed payments to Andrew Wakefield at the heart of vaccine alarm | author = Deer, Brian| url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/legal-aid.htm |publisher= briandeer.com | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070821211233/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/legal-aid.htm| archivedate= 21 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> payments which ''The Sunday Times'' reported had begun two years before the  paper in ''The Lancet''.<ref name="MMRAidMoney"/>

On 5 January 2011, ''BMJ'' published an article by Brian Deer entitled "How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed".<ref name=HowTheCase/>  Deer, funded by ''The Sunday Times'' of London and Channel 4 television network, said that, based on examination of the medical records of the 12 children in the original study, his research had found:<ref name=HowTheCase>{{cite journal | title=How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed| author=Deer B| journal=BMJ |date= 5 January 2011 |publisher= BMJ | volume=342 | pmid=21209059| pages=c5347| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5347}}</ref>

: "The paper in ''The Lancet'' was a case series of 12 child patients; it reported a proposed “new syndrome” of enterocolitis and regressive autism and associated this with MMR as an “apparent precipitating event.” But in fact:

:: "Three of nine children reported with regressive autism did not have autism diagnosed at all. Only one child clearly had regressive autism;

:: "Despite the paper claiming that all 12 children were “previously normal,” five had documented pre-existing developmental concerns;

:: "Some children were reported to have experienced first behavioural symptoms within days of MMR, but the records documented these as starting some months after vaccination;

:: "In nine cases, unremarkable colonic histopathology results—noting no or minimal fluctuations in inflammatory cell populations—were changed after a medical school “research review” to “non-specific colitis”;

:: "The parents of eight children were reported as blaming MMR, but 11 families made this allegation at the hospital. The exclusion of three allegations—all giving times to onset of problems in months—helped to create the appearance of a 14 day temporal link;

:: "Patients were recruited through anti-MMR campaigners, and the study was commissioned and funded for planned litigation."<ref name=HowTheCase/>

In an accompanying editorial, ''BMJ'' editors said:

<blockquote>Clear evidence of falsification of data should now close the door on this damaging vaccine scare ... Who perpetrated this fraud? There is no doubt that it was Wakefield. Is it possible that he was wrong, but not dishonest: that he was so incompetent that he was unable to fairly describe the project, or to report even one of the 12 children's cases accurately? No. A great deal of thought and effort must have gone into drafting the paper to achieve the results he wanted: the discrepancies all led in one direction; misreporting was gross. Moreover, although the scale of the GMC's 217 day hearing precluded additional charges focused directly on the fraud, the panel found him guilty of dishonesty concerning the study's admissions criteria, its funding by the Legal Aid Board, and his statements about it afterwards.<ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ/></blockquote>

This concern arose originally because the company's business plan appears to depend on premature, scientifically unjustified publication of results, which do not conform to the rigorous academic and scientific standards that are generally expected."<ref name=HowMakeMoney/></blockquote>

[[WebMD]] reported on Deer's ''BMJ'' report, saying that the $43 million predicted yearly profits would come from marketing kits for "diagnosing patients with autism" and that "the initial market for the diagnostic will be litigation-driven testing of patients with AE [autistic enterocolitis, an unproven condition concocted by Wakefield] from both the UK and the US".<ref name=DoctorPlanned>{{cite web |url= http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110111/mmr-doctor-planned-make-millions-journal-claims |title= MMR Doctor 'Planned to Make Millions,' Journal Claims |author= Russell, Peter |publisher= WebMD Health News |date= 11 January 2011 |accessdate= 2011-01-12}}</ref>  According to WebMD, the ''BMJ'' article also claimed that Carmel Healthcare Ltd would succeed in marketing products and developing a replacement vaccine if "public confidence in the MMR vaccine was damaged".<ref name=DoctorPlanned/>

In October 2012, research published in PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, identified Wakefield's 1998 paper as the most cited retracted scientific paper, with 758 citations, and gave the "reason for retraction" as "fraud".<ref name=retractions>{{cite journal |author=Fang FC |title=Misconduct accounts for the majority of retracted scientific publications |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2012 |month=October |doi=10.1073/pnas.1212247109 |author-separator=, |author2=Steen RG |author3=Casadevall A |display-authors=3}}</ref>

=== Journal retractions ===

On 2 February 2010, ''The Lancet'' formally retracted Wakefield's 1998 paper.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/03lancet.html |title= Journal Retracts 1998 Paper Linking Autism to Vaccines |work= The New York Times |date= 2 February 2010 |accessdate= 2011-01-06 |first=Gardiner |last=Harris| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101201165958/http://www10.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/03lancet.html| archivedate= 1 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=CNNLancetRetraction>{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/02/lancet.retraction.autism/index.html?section=cnn_latest |title= Medical journal retracts study linking autism to vaccine|publisher= CNN |date= 2 February 2010 |accessdate= 2010-02-02}}</ref> The retraction states that "the claims in the original paper that children were 'consecutively referred' and that investigations were 'approved' by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false".<ref name="retraction" />

The following day the editor of a specialist journal, ''Neurotoxicology'', withdrew another Wakefield paper that was in press. The article, which concerned research on monkeys, had already been published online and sought to implicate vaccines in autism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hewitson L |title=WITHDRAWN: Delayed acquisition of neonatal reflexes in newborn primates receiving a thimerosal-containing Hepatitis B vaccine: Influence of gestational age and birth weight |journal=Neurotoxicology |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19800915 |doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2009.09.008 |author-separator=, |author2=Houser LA |author3=Stott C |display-authors=3 |last4=Sackett |first4=Gene |last5=Tomko |first5=Jaime L. |last6=Atwood |first6=David |last7=Blue |first7=Lisa |last8=White |first8=E.

In May 2010, ''[[The American Journal of Gastroenterology]]'' retracted a paper of Wakefield's that used data from the 12 patients of the article in ''The Lancet''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/ajg.2010.149 |title= Retraction: Enterocolitis in Children With Developmental Disorders |year=2010 | author=Wakefield AJ |journal=[[The American Journal of Gastroenterology]] |volume=105 |page=1214 |issue=5 |author-separator= , |author2= Anthony A |author3= Murch SH |display-authors= 3 |last4= Thomson |first4= M |last5= Montgomery |first5= S M |last6= Davies |first6= S |last7= O'Leary |first7= J J |last8= Berelowitz |first8= M |last9= Walker-Smith |first9= J A}}</ref>

On 5 January 2011, ''BMJ'' editors recommended that Wakefield's other publications should be scrutinized and retracted if need be.<ref name=NYTOther>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/01/05/health/AP-EU-MED-Autism-Fraud.html?|title=Study Linking Vaccine to Autism Was Fraud, Journal Reports|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=2011-01-06|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

=== Wakefield response ===

As of January 2011, Wakefield has continued to maintain his innocence.  In a press release, he stated,
<blockquote>I want to make one thing crystal clear for the record—my research and the serious medical problems found in those children were not a hoax and there was no fraud whatsoever. Nor did I seek to profit from our findings. ... despite media reports to the contrary, the results of my research have been duplicated in five other countries ... I continue to fully support more independent research to determine if environmental triggers, including vaccines, are causing autism and other developmental problems. ... Since the Lancet [sic] paper, I have lost my job, my career and my country. To claim that my motivation was profit is patently untrue. I will not be deterred—this issue is far too important.<ref name=WakefieldStatement>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-from-dr-andrew-wakefield--no-fraud-no-hoax-no-profit-motive-113454389.html |title= Statement From Dr. Andrew Wakefield: No Fraud. No Hoax. No Profit Motive. |date= 13 January 2011 |accessdate= 2011-01-13 |publisher= PRNewswire |work= PharmaLive.com}}</ref></blockquote>

In an internet radio interview, Wakefield said the ''BMJ'' series "was utter nonsense" and denied "that he used the cases of the 12 children in his study to promote his business venture".<ref name=AuthorHeld/> Although Deer is funded by ''The Sunday Times'' and Channel 4, he has filed financial disclosure forms and denies receiving any funding from the pharmaceutical industry, which Wakefield says is paying him.<ref name=AuthorHeld/> According to CNN, Wakefield said the patent he held was for "an 'over-the-counter nutritional supplement' that boosts the immune system".<ref name=AuthorHeld/> WebMD reported that Wakefield said he was the victim of "a ruthless, pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns".<ref name=DoctorPlanned/>

Wakefield claims that Deer is a "hit man who was brought in to take [him] down" and that other scientists have simply taken Deer at his word. While on ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'', claiming he had not read the ''BMJ'' articles yet, he denied their validity and denied that Deer had interviewed the families of the children in the study. He also urged viewers to read his book, ''Callous Disregard'', which he claimed would explain why he was being targeted, to which [[Anderson Cooper]] replied: "But, sir, if you're lying, then your book is also a lie. If your study is a lie, your book is a lie."<ref name=Dominus/><ref>{{cite video | people = [[Anderson Cooper]] (interviewer), Andrew Wakefield (interviewee) | date = 6 January 2011 | title = Autism-vaccine study author defends work | publisher = CNN | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20027552-10391704.html}}</ref>

Wakefield would later imply that there is a [[Cabal|conspiracy]] by [[public health]] officials and [[pharmaceutical companies]] to discredit him, including suggesting they pay bloggers to post rumors about him on websites or that they artificially inflated reports of deaths from measles.<ref name=Dominus/>

=== Deer counter-response ===

Deer responded to Wakefield's charge by challenging Wakefield to sue him for libel:<blockquote>If it is true that Andrew Wakefield is not guilty as charged, he has the remedy of bringing a libel action against myself, the ''Sunday Times of London'', against the medical journal here, and he would be the richest man in America.<ref name=CNNElaborateFraud/> </blockquote>He also noted that Wakefield has previously sued him and lost.<ref name=Judgment/><ref name=CNNElaborateFraud/> In January 2012 Wakefield filed a defamation lawsuit in Texas state court against Deer, Fiona Godlee and the [[BMJ]] for false accusations of fraud, seeking a jury trial in [[Travis County]].
