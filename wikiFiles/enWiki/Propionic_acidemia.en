Propionic Acidemia is a rare disorder that is inherited from both parents. Being autosomal recessive, neither parent shows symptoms, but both carry a defective gene responsible for this disease. It takes two faulty genes to cause PA, so there is a 1 in 4 chance for these parents to have a child with PA.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Odd-chain_FA_oxydation.png|thumb|right|Methylmalonic acidemia is caused by a defect in the vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase.]]

In healthy individuals, the enzyme propionyl CoA carboxylase converts propionyl CoA to methylmalonyl CoA. This is one step in the process of converting certain amino acids and fats into sugar for energy. Individuals with PA cannot perform this conversion because the enzyme propionyl CoA carboxylase is nonfunctional. The essential amino acids isoleucine, valine, threonine, and methionine and odd-chain fatty acids are simply converted to propionyl CoA, before the process stops, leading to a buildup of propionyl CoA. Instead of being converted to methylmalonyl CoA, propionyl CoA is then converted into propionic acid, which builds up in the bloodstream. This in turn causes a build-up of dangerous acids and toxins, which can cause damage to the organs.

In many cases, PA can damage the brain, heart, and liver, cause seizures, and delays to normal development like walking and talking. During times of illness the affected person may need to be hospitalized to prevent breakdown of proteins within the body. Each meal presents a challenge to those with PA. If not constantly monitored, the effects would be devastating. Dietary needs must be closely managed by a metabolic geneticist or metabolic dietician.

Mutations in both copies of the [[Propionyl-CoA carboxylase|PCCA]] or [[PCCB]] [[gene]]s cause propionic acidemia.<ref name="pamr">[http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic-Aciademia.cfm http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic-Aciademia.cfm]<br />Barry Lab - Vector and Virus Engineering. ''Gene therapy for Propionic Acidemia''</ref> These genes are responsible for the formation of the [[enzyme]] ''[[propionyl-CoA carboxylase]]'' ({{EC number|6.4.1.3}}), referred to as ''PCC''. 

PCC is required for the normal breakdown of the essential [[amino acids]] [[valine]], [[isoleucine]], [[threonine]], and [[methionine]], as well as certain odd-chained fatty-acids. Mutations in the PCCA or PCCB genes disrupt the function of the enzyme, preventing these acids from being metabolized. As a result, [[propionyl-CoA]], [[propionic acid]], [[ketones]] and other [[toxic]] compounds accumulate in the [[blood]], causing the signs and symptoms of propionic acidemia.

==Symptoms==
Propionic acidemia is characterized almost immediately in newborns. Symptoms include poor feeding, [[vomiting]], [[dehydration]], [[acidosis]], low [[muscle]] tone ([[hypotonia]]), seizures, and [[lethargy]]. The effects of propionic acidemia quickly become life-threatening.

==Genetic prevalence==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Propionic acidemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

Propionic acidemia is inherited in an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] pattern and is found in about 1 in 35,000<ref name="pamr" /> live births in the [[United States]]. The condition appears to be more common in [[Saudi Arabia]],<ref name="pasa">{{cite journal |author=Al-Odaib AN, Abu-Amaro KK, Ozand PT, Al-Hellani AM |title=A new era for preventive genetic programs in the Arabian Peninsula |journal=Saudi Medical Journal |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=1168–1175 |year=2003 |pmid=14647548 }}</ref> with a frequency of about 1 in 3,000.<ref name="pamr" /> The condition also appears to be common in [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] populations.<ref name="paam">{{cite journal |author=Kidd JR, Wolf B, Hsia E, Kidd KK |title=Genetics of propionic acidemia in a Mennonite-Amish kindred |journal=Am J Hum Genet. |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=236–245 |year=1980 |pmid=7386459 |pmc=1686010 }}</ref>

==Management==
Patients with propionic acidemia should be started as early as possible on a low protein diet, in addition to a protein mixture that is devoid of Methionine threonine valine and Isoleucine, the patient should also receive a treatment L-carnitine and should be given antibiotics 10 days per month in order to remove the intestinal propiogenic flora.  The patient should have diet protocols prepared for him with a “well day diet” with low protein content, and a “half emergency diet” containing half of the protein requirements and an “emergency diet” with no protein contents, for emergency cases. These patients are under the risk of severe hyperammonemia during infections that can lead to comatose states. .<ref>Saudubray JM, Van Der Bergh G, Walter J : Inborn Metabolic Diseases Diagnosis and Treatment (2012)</ref>
