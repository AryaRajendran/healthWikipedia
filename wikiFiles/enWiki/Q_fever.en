'''Q fever''' is a disease caused by infection with <!-- why "Coxiella burnetii" when it is named by Derrick after F M Burnet and the latin possessive ending has but one i.

Rarely, the disease is tick borne.<ref>{{cite web|title=Q fever|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever/}}</ref> The [[incubation period]] is 9–40 days.

== History ==
[[Image:Pneumonia x-ray.jpg|right|thumb|''Image A'': A normal [[chest X-ray]] ''Image B'': Q fever pneumonia]]
It was first described by [[Edward Holbrook Derrick]]<ref>Derrick EH. ''Q" fever a new fever entity: clinical features. diagnosis, and laboratory investigation. Med J Aust. 1937;11:281-299.</ref> in [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]] workers in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The "Q" stands for "query" and was applied at a time when the causative agent was unknown; it was chosen over suggestions of "abattoir fever" and "Queensland rickettsial fever", to avoid directing negative connotations at either the cattle industry or the state of Queensland.<ref>{{cite book | author = Joseph E. McDade | chapter = Historical Aspects of Q Fever | title = Q Fever, Volume I: The Disease | editor = Thomas J. Marrie | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-8493-5984-8 | page = 8}}</ref>

The [[pathogen]] of Q fever was discovered in 1937, when [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]] and [[Mavis Freeman]] isolated the bacterium from one of Derrick’s patients.<ref>Burnet FM, Freeman M. Experimental studies on the virus of “Q” fever. Med J Aust 1937; 2: 299-305.</ref> It was originally identified as a species of ''[[Rickettsia]]''. [[H.R. Cox]] and [[Gordon Davis (scientist)|Gordon Davis]] isolated it from [[tick]]s in [[Montana]], [[USA]] in 1938.<ref>Davis, G. E., and H. R. Cox. 1938. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/4582746 A filter-passing infectious agent isolated from ticks. I. Isolation from Dermacentor andersonii, reactions in animals, and filtration.] Public Health Rep. 53:2259-2282.</ref>  It is a [[zoonotic]] disease whose most common animal reservoirs are cattle, sheep and goats. ''Coxiella burnetii'' is no longer regarded as closely related to [[Rickettsiae]], but as similar to ''[[Legionella]]'' and ''[[Francisella]]'', and is a [[proteobacteria|proteobacterium]].

== Signs and symptoms ==
Incubation period is usually two to three weeks.<ref name="Brunette-2011-p270" /> The most common manifestation is mild [[flu-like symptoms]] with abrupt onset of [[fever]], [[malaise]], profuse perspiration, severe [[headache]], [[myalgia]] (muscle pain), joint pain, loss of appetite, upper respiratory problems, dry cough, pleuritic pain, chills, confusion and gastrointestinal [[symptoms]], such as [[nausea]], vomiting and [[diarrhea]]. The fever lasts approximately seven to 14 days.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Approximately half of infected individuals exhibit no symptoms.<ref name="Brunette-2011-p270">{{cite book|chapter=Q Fever|editors=Brunette, Gary W. et al|title=CDC Health Information for International Travel: The Yellow Book|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-976901-8|page=270|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5vCQpr1WTS8C&pg=PA270|author=Anderson, Alicia & McQuiston, Jennifer}}</ref>

During its course, the disease can progress to an [[atypical pneumonia]], which can result in a life-threatening [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), whereby such symptoms usually occur during the first four to five days of infection.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Less often, Q fever causes (granulomatous) [[hepatitis]], which may be asymptomatic or becomes symptomatic with malaise, fever, liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and pain in the right upper quadrant of the [[abdomen]]. Whereas [[elevated transaminases|transaminase values]] are often elevated, [[jaundice]] is uncommon. Retinal vasculitis is a rare manifestation of Q fever.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kuhne F, Morlat P, Riss I, ''et al.''|title=Is A29, B12 vasculitis caused by the Q fever agent? (''Coxiella burnetii'')|journal=J Fr Ophtalmol|year=1992|volume=15|pages=315&ndash;21|pmid=1430809|language=French|issue=5}}</ref>

The chronic form of Q fever is virtually identical to [[inflammation]] of the inner lining of the heart ([[endocarditis]]),<ref name="pmid16757641">{{cite journal |author=Karakousis PC, Trucksis M, Dumler JS |title=Chronic Q fever in the United States |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=2283–7 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16757641 |pmc=1489455 |doi=10.1128/JCM.02365-05 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16757641}}</ref> which can occur months or decades following the infection. It is usually fatal if untreated. However, with appropriate treatment, the mortality falls to around 10%.

==Clinical signs in animals==
Cattle, goats and sheep are most commonly infected, and can serve as a reservoir for the bacteria. Q fever is a well recognized cause of abortions in ruminants and in pets. ''C. burnetii'' infection in dairy cattle has been well documented and its association with reproductive problems in these animals has been reported in Canada, USA, Cyprus, France, Hungary, Japan, Switzerland and West Germany.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=9577778|year=1998|last1=To|first1=H|last2=Sakai|first2=R|last3=Shirota|first3=K|last4=Kano|first4=C|last5=Abe|first5=S|last6=Sugimoto|first6=T|last7=Takehara|first7=K|last8=Morita|first8=C|last9=Takashima|first9=I|title=Coxiellosis in domestic and wild birds from Japan|volume=34|issue=2|pages=310–6|journal=Journal of wildlife diseases}}</ref> For instance, in a study published in 2008,<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=21962829|year=2012|last1=Czaplicki|first1=G|last2=Houtain|first2=JY|last3=Mullender|first3=C|last4=Porter|first4=SR|last5=Humblet|first5=MF|last6=Manteca|first6=C|last7=Saegerman|first7=C|title=Apparent prevalence of antibodies to Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) in bulk tank milk from dairy herds in southern Belgium|volume=192|issue=3|pages=529–31|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.08.033|journal=Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)}}</ref>a significant association has been shown between the herds’ seropositivity and typical clinical signs of Q Fever observed such as abortion, stillbirth, weak calves and repeat breeding. Moreover, experimental inoculation of ''C. burnetii'' in cattle induced not only respiratory disorders and cardiac failures ([[myocarditis]]) but also frequent abortions and irregular repeat breedings.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=M|last1=Plommet|first2=M|last2=Capponi|first3=J|last3=Gestin|first4=G|last4=Renoux|title=Fièvre Q expérimentale des bovins|language=French|journal=Annales de recherches vétérinaires|year=1973|volume=4|issue=2|pages=325–346}}</ref>

== Appearance and incidence ==
[[Image:Coxiella burnetii 01.JPG|thumb|right|''C. burnetii'', the Q fever-causing agent]]

The pathogenic agent is to be found everywhere except [[New Zealand]].<ref name="pmid17147957">{{cite journal |author=Cutler SJ, Bouzid M, Cutler RR |title=Q fever |journal=J. Infect. |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=313–8 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17147957 |doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2006.10.048 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163-4453(06)00378-1}}</ref> The bacterium is extremely sustainable and virulent: a single organism is able to cause an infection. The common way of infection is inhalation of contaminated dust, contact with contaminated [[milk]], meat, wool and particularly birthing products. Ticks can transfer the pathogenic agent to other animals. Transfer between humans seems extremely rare and has so far been described in very few cases.

Some studies have shown more men to be affected than women,<ref name="pmid10589906">{{cite journal |author=Domingo P, Muñoz C, Franquet T, Gurguí M, Sancho F, Vazquez G |title=Acute Q fever in adult patients: report on 63 sporadic cases in an urban area |journal=Clin.

"At risk" occupations include, but are not limited to:
* [[veterinary]] personnel
* [[Feedlot|stockyard]] workers
* [[farmer]]s
* [[sheep shearer|shearer]]s
* animal transporters
* laboratory workers handling potentially infected veterinary samples or visiting [[abattoir]]s
* people who cull and process [[kangaroos]]
* hide ([[tanning|tannery]]) workers

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Q fever management algorithm.gif|thumbnail|left|Q fever management algorithm from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]]]
Diagnosis is usually based on [[serology]]<ref name="pmid10515901">{{cite journal |author=Maurin M, Raoult D |title=Q fever |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=518–53 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10515901 |pmc=88923 |doi= |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10515901}}</ref><ref name="pmid12491231">{{cite journal |author=Scola BL |title=Current laboratory diagnosis of Q fever |journal=Semin Pediatr Infect Dis |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=257–62 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12491231 |doi=10.1053/spid.2002.127199 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S104518700250008X}}</ref> (looking for an [[antibody]] response) rather than looking for the organism itself.  Serology allows to detect chronic infection as high antibody levels are found against the virulent form of the bacterium.  Molecular detection of bacterial DNA is increasingly used.  Culture is technically difficult and not routinely available in most microbiology laboratories.

Q fever can cause [[endocarditis]] (infection of the heart valves) which may require [[Echocardiography#Transesophageal echocardiogram|transoesophageal echocardiography]] to diagnose.  Q fever hepatitis manifests as an elevation of [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]], but a definitive diagnosis is only possible on [[liver biopsy]], which shows the characteristic [[fibrin ring granuloma]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Patient with fever and diarrea | author=van de Veerdonk FL, Schneeberger PM. | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=42 | pages=1051&ndash;2 | doi=10.1086/501027 | issue=7 }}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Treatment of the acute Q fever with [[antibiotic]]s is very effective{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and should take place in consultation with an [[infectious disease]]s specialist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Commonly used are [[doxycycline]], [[tetracycline]], [[chloramphenicol]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[ofloxacin]], and [[hydroxychloroquine]]. The chronic form is more difficult to treat and can require up to four years of treatment with doxycycline and [[quinolone]]s or doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine.

Q fever in pregnancy is especially difficult to treat because doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are contraindicated in pregnancy.  The preferred treatment is five weeks of [[co-trimoxazole]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=2007|volume=45|pages=548&ndash;555|title=Managing Q fever during pregnancy: The benefits of long-term Cotrimoxazole therapy|author=Carcopino X, Raoult D, Bretelle F, Boubli L, Stein A | doi = 10.1086/520661|pmid=17682987|issue=5}}</ref>

== Prevention ==

Protection is offered by Q-Vax, a whole-cell, inactivated vaccine developed by an Australian vaccine manufacturing company CSL.<ref>[http://www.csl.com.au/QFever.asp csl.com.au]</ref> The intradermal vaccination is composed of killed ''Coxiella burnetii'' organisms. Skin and blood tests should be done before vaccination to identify pre-existing immunity, because vaccinating subjects who already have an immunity can result in a severe local reaction. After a single dose of vaccine, protective immunity lasts for many years. Revaccination is not generally required. Annual screening is typically recommended.<ref>http://cdp.ucsf.edu/fileUpload/UCSF_CDP_Q_Fever_Surveillance_Policy_Q_Neg_Wethers.pdf</ref>

In 2001, [[Australia]] introduced a national Q fever vaccination program for people working in "at risk" occupations.

The Soviet Union had earlier developed a killed vaccine, but its side effects prevented its licensing abroad.

Preliminary results suggest vaccination of animals may be a method of control. Published trials proved that use of a registered Phase I vaccine (Coxevac) in infected farms is a tool of major interest to manage or prevent early or late abortion, repeat breeding, [[anoestrus]], silent oestrus, [[metritis]] and decreases in milk yield when ''C. burnetii'' is the major cause of these problems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Camuset|first1=P|last2=Remmy|first2=D|title=Q Fever (Coxiella burnetii) Eradication in a Dairy Herd by Using Vaccination with a Phase 1 Vaccine|publisher=XXV World Buiatrics Congress|year=2008|location=Budapest}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=21392427|year=2011|last1=Hogerwerf|first1=L|last2=Van Den Brom|first2=R|last3=Roest|first3=HI|last4=Bouma|first4=A|last5=Vellema|first5=P|last6=Pieterse|first6=M|last7=Dercksen|first7=D|last8=Nielen|first8=M|title=Reduction of Coxiella burnetii prevalence by vaccination of goats and sheep, the Netherlands|volume=17|issue=3|pages=379–86|doi=10.3201/eid1703.101157|pmc=3166012|journal=Emerging infectious diseases}}</ref><!--what is "Wannyn (2007) meant to be?-->

== Biological warfare ==

Q fever has been described as a possible biological weapon.<ref name="pmid14592601">{{cite journal |author=Madariaga MG, Rezai K, Trenholme GM, Weinstein RA |title=Q fever: a biological weapon in your backyard |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=709–21 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14592601 |doi= 10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00804-1|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309903008041}}</ref>

The United States investigated Q fever as a potential [[biological warfare]] agent in the 1950s, with eventual standardization as agent OU.  At Fort Detrick and Dugway Proving Ground, human trials were conducted on [[Operation Whitecoat|Whitecoat volunteers]] to determine the median infective dose (18 MICLD<sub>50</sub>/person i.h.) and course of infection.  As a standardized biological, it was manufactured in large quantities at [[Pine Bluff Arsenal]], with 5,098 gallons in the arsenal in bulk at the time of demilitarization in 1970.

Q fever is a category "B" agent.<ref name="pmid12704232">{{cite journal |author=Seshadri R, Paulsen IT, Eisen JA, ''et al.'' |title=Complete genome sequence of the Q-fever pathogen Coxiella burnetii |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=100 |issue=9 |pages=5455–60 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12704232 |pmc=154366 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0931379100 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12704232}}</ref> It can be contagious, and is very stable in aerosols in a wide range of temperatures. Q fever microorganisms may survive on surfaces up to 60 days.

It is considered a good agent in part because its ID50 (number of bacilli needed to infect 50% of individuals) is considered to be 1, making it the lowest known to man.

== In popular Culture ==

A mention of Q fever was important in one of the early [[Dr. Kildare]] films (1939, ''Calling Dr. Kildare''). Kildare's mentor Dr. Gillespie ([[Lionel Barrymore]]) tires of his protege working fruitlessly on "exotic diagnoses" ("I think it's Q fever!") and sends him to work in a neighborhood clinic instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.san.beck.org/MM/1939/CallingDrKildare.html|title=''Calling Dr. Kildare''|publisher=Movie Mirrors Index|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11616027|title=When Americans called for Dr. Kildare: images of physicians and nurses in the Dr. Kildare and Dr. Gillespie movies, 1937–1947|first=PA|last=Kalisch|first2=BJ|last2=Kalisch|journal=Medical Heritage|year=1985|issue=1|pages=348–363|url=http://www.truthaboutnursing.org/images/kalisch/when_americans_called_dr_kildare.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=30 April 2013|volume=1}}</ref>

Q fever was also highlighted in an episode of the U.S. television medical drama [[House (TV series)|House]] ([[The Dig (House)|''The Dig'']], Season 7, Episode 18).
