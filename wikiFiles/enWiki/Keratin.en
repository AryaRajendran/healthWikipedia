'''Keratin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛr|ə|t|ən}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989 as {{IPA|/'kεrətɪn/}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/keratin Entry "keratin"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>) is a family of [[fibrous protein|fibrous structural proteins]]. Keratin is the key structural material making up the outer layer of human [[skin]].  It is also the key structural component of [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]]. Keratin [[monomer]]s assemble into bundles to form [[intermediate filament]]s, which are tough and insoluble and form strong [[mineralization (biology)|unmineralized]] tissues found in [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, and [[mammal]]s. The only other [[biology|biological]] matter known to approximate the [[toughness]] of keratinized tissue is [[chitin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Keratin |work=Webster's Online Dictionary |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Keratin}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Vincenta, Julian F.V.; Wegst, Ulrike G.K. |title=Design and mechanical properties of insect cuticle |journal=Arthropod Structure & Development |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=187–199 |date=1 July 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2004.05.006 |url=http://biomimetic.pbworks.com/f/Design%2Band%2Bmechanical%2Bproperties%2BofVincent.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tombolato L, Novitskaya EE, Chen PY, Sheppard FA, McKittrick J |title=Microstructure, elastic properties and deformation mechanisms of horn keratin |journal=Acta Biomater |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=319–30 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=19577667 |doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2009.06.033 |url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/126/1263373670.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Keratin derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''κέρατος'' the genitive form of ''κέρας'' meaning "horn" from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ḱer-'' of the same meaning.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keratin |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=keratin&allowed_in_frame=0}}<br/>{{cite web |title=Horn |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=horn&allowed_in_frame=0}}</ref>

[[File:Male impala profile.jpg|thumb|[[Horn (anatomy)|Horns]] such as those of the [[impala]] are made up of keratin covering a core of live bone]]
Keratin filaments are abundant in [[keratinocyte]]s in the [[cornified]] layer of the epidermis; these are cells which have undergone keratinization.  In addition, keratin filaments are present in epithelial cells in general.  For example, mouse thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are known to react with antibodies for keratin 5, keratin 8, and keratin 14.  These antibodies are used as fluorescent markers to distinguish subsets of TECs in genetic studies of the thymus.

Although it is now difficult to be certain, the scales, claws, some [[Thyreophora|protective armour]] and the beaks of [[dinosaur]]s were likely to have been composed of keratin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Manning PL, Payne D, Pennicott J, Barrett PM, Ennos RA |title=Dinosaur killer claws or climbing crampons? |journal=Biol.

Keratins (also described as [[cytokeratins]]) are polymers of type I and type II [[intermediate filaments]], which have only been found in the genomes of chordates (vertebrates, Amphioxus, urochordates). Nematodes and many other non-chordate animals seem to only have type V [[intermediate filaments]], [[lamins]], which have a long rod domain (vs. a short rod domain for the keratins).

The usefulness of keratins depends on their supermolecular aggregation. These depend on the properties of the individual [[peptide|polypeptide]] strands, which depend in turn on their [[amino acid]] composition and sequence. The [[alpha helix|α-helix]] and [[beta sheet|β-sheet]] motifs, and disulfide bridges, are crucial to the [[protein structure#Secondary structure elements|conformations]] of [[globular protein|globular, functional proteins]] like [[enzymes]], many of which operate semi-independently, but they take on a completely dominant role in the architecture and aggregation of keratins.

The alpha keratin helix is not a true alpha helix, as it only has 3.5 residues/turn, where the normal alpha helix has 3.6 residues/turn.  This is important for the different helices to form tight disulfide bonds.  Also, roughly every seventh residue is a leucine, so they can line up and help the strands stick together through hydrophobic interactions.

===Cornification===
Cornification is the process of forming an epidermal barrier in stratified squamous epithelial tissue. At the cellular level, cornification is characterised by:

* production of keratin
* production of small proline-rich (SPRR) proteins and [[transglutaminase]]  which eventually form a cornified cell envelope beneath the plasma membrane
* terminal differentiation
* loss of nuclei and organelles, in the final stages of cornification metabolism ceases and the cells are almost completely filled by keratin

During the process of epithelial [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], cells become [[cornification|cornified]] as keratin [[protein]] is incorporated into longer keratin intermediate filaments. Eventually the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytoplasm]]ic [[organelle]]s disappear, [[metabolism]] ceases and cells undergo a [[apoptosis|programmed death]] as they become fully keratinized.  In many other cell types, such as cells of the [[dermis]], keratin filaments and other intermediate filaments function as part of the [[cytoskeleton]] to mechanically stabilize the cell against physical stress.  It does this through connections to [[desmosomes]], cell-cell junctional plaques, and [[hemidesmosomes]], cell-basement membrane adhesive structures.

[[Cell (biology)|Cells]] in the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] contain a structural matrix of keratin, which makes this outermost layer of the [[skin]] almost waterproof, and along with [[collagen]] and [[elastin]], gives skin its strength. Rubbing and pressure cause thickening of the outer, cornified layer of the epidermis and form protective [[callus]]es — useful for athletes and on the fingertips of musicians who play stringed instruments. Keratinized epidermal cells are constantly shed and replaced.

These hard, [[Integumentary system|integument]]ary structures are formed by intercellular cementing of fibers formed from the dead, cornified cells generated by [[sebaceous glands|specialized beds]] deep within the skin. Hair grows continuously and feathers [[moult]] and regenerate. The constituent [[protein]]s may be [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] [[homology (biology)|homologous]] but differ somewhat in [[chemical compound|chemical]] structure and super[[molecule|molecular]] organization. The [[evolution]]ary relationships are complex and only partially known. Multiple [[gene]]s have been identified for the β-keratins in feathers, and this is probably characteristic of all keratins.

==Structural details==
[[Image:Keratin.jpg|thumb|Keratin (high molecular weight) in bile duct cell and oval cells of horse liver]]
Fibrous keratin molecules supercoil to form a very stable, left-handed [[superhelix|superhelical]] motif to multimerise, forming filaments consisting of multiple copies of the keratin [[monomer]].<ref name="v&v1">{{citation|page=158|quote=Fibrous proteins are characterized by a single type of  secondary structure: a keratin is a left-handed coil of two a helices|chapter-url=http://biochem118.stanford.edu/Papers/Protein%20Papers/Voet%26Voet%20chapter6.pdf |last1=Voet|last2=Voet|last3=Pratt|first1=Donald|first2=Judith|first3=Charlotte|accessdate=2010-10-01|title=Fundamentals of Biochemistry |chapter=Proteins: Three-Dimensional Structure |url=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471586501/whaticomascienli#reader_0471586501}}</ref>

Limited interior space is the reason why the [[triple helix]] of the (unrelated) structural protein [[collagen]], found in skin, [[cartilage]] and [[bone]], likewise has a high percentage of glycine. The connective tissue protein [[elastin]] also has a high percentage of both glycine and alanine. Silk [[fibroin]], considered a β-keratin, can have these two as 75–80% of the total, with 10–15% serine, with the rest having bulky side groups. The chains are antiparallel, with an alternating C → N orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/566secprotein.html |title=Secondary Protein |publisher=Elmhurst.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> A preponderance of amino acids with small, [[chemical reaction|nonreactive]] side groups is characteristic for structural proteins, for which H-bonded close packing is more important than [[chemical specificity]].

===Disulfide bridges===
In addition to intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, keratins have large amounts of the [[sulfur]]-containing amino acid [[cysteine]], required for the [[disulfide bond|disulfide bridges]] that confer additional strength and rigidity by permanent, thermally stable [[cross-link|crosslinking]]—a role sulfur bridges also play in [[vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[rubber]]. Human hair is approximately 14% cysteine. The pungent smells of burning hair and rubber are due to the sulfur compounds formed. Extensive disulfide bonding contributes to the [[soluble|insolubility]] of keratins, except in [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociating]] or [[redox|reducing]] agents.

The more flexible and elastic keratins of hair have fewer interchain disulfide bridges than the keratins in mammalian [[fingernail]]s, hooves and claws (homologous structures), which are harder and more like their analogs in other vertebrate classes. Hair and other α-keratins consist of [[alpha helix|α-helically]] coiled single protein strands (with regular intra-chain [[hydrogen bond|H-bonding]]), which are then further twisted into superhelical ropes that may be further coiled. The β-keratins of reptiles and birds have β-pleated sheets twisted together, then stabilized and hardened by disulfide bridges.

===Filament formation===
It was theorized that keratins are combined into 'hard' and 'soft,' or '[[cytokeratin]]s' and 'other keratins'{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}. That model is now understood to be correct.  A new nuclear addition in 2006 to describe keratins takes this into account.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schweizer J, Bowden PE, Coulombe PA, ''et al.'' |title=New consensus nomenclature for mammalian keratins |journal=J. Cell Biol. |volume=174 |issue=2 |pages=169–74 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16831889 |pmc=2064177 |doi=10.1083/jcb.200603161 |url=http://www.jcb.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16831889}}</ref> 

Keratin filaments are [[intermediate filament]]s.  Like all intermediate filaments, keratin proteins form filamentous polymers in a series of assembly steps beginning with dimerization; dimers assemble into tetramers and octamers and eventually, if the current hypothesis holds, into unit-length-filaments (ULF) capable of [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]] end-to-end into long filaments.

==Silk==
The [[silk]] [[fibroins]] produced by [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s are often classified as keratins, though it is unclear whether they are phylogenetically related to vertebrate keratins.

Silk found in insect [[pupa]]e, and in [[spider web]]s and egg casings, also has twisted β-pleated sheets incorporated into fibers wound into larger supermolecular aggregates. The structure of the [[spinneret (spider)|spinneret]]s on spiders’ tails, and the contributions of their interior [[gland]]s, provide remarkable control of fast [[extrusion]]. Spider silk is typically about 1 to 2 micrometres (µm) thick, compared with about 60&nbsp;µm for human hair, and more for some mammals.  The [[biology|biologically]] and [[commerce|commercially]] useful properties of [[spider silk#Properties|silk fibers]] depend on the organization of multiple adjacent protein chains into hard, [[crystal]]line regions of varying size, alternating with flexible, [[amorphous]] regions where the chains are [[random coil|randomly coiled]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Australia |url=http://www.amonline.net.au/spiders/toolkit/silk/structure.htm |title=Spiders - Silk structure |publisher=Amonline.net.au |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> A somewhat analogous situation occurs with [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[polymer]]s such as [[nylon]], developed as a silk substitute. Silk from the [[hornet]] [[Silkworm cocoons|cocoon]] contains doublets about 10&nbsp;µm across, with cores and coating, and may be arranged in up to 10 layers; also in plaques of variable shape. Adult hornets also use silk as a [[adhesive|glue]], as do spiders.

Some [[infection|infectious]] [[fungus|fungi]], such as those that cause [[athlete's foot]] and [[ringworm]] (i.e. the [[dermatophytes]]), or ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' (Chytrid fungus), feed on keratin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Furthermore, keratin expression is helpful in determining epithelial origin in [[anaplastic]] cancers. Tumors that express keratin include [[carcinoma]]s, [[thymoma]]s, [[sarcoma]]s and [[trophoblastic neoplasm]]s. Furthermore, the precise expression pattern of keratin subtypes allows prediction of the origin of the primary tumor when assessing metastases. For example, [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]s typically expresse K8 and K18, and [[cholangiocarcinoma]]s express K7, K8 and K18, while metastases of [[colorectal carcinoma]]s express K20, but not K7.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Omary MB, Ku NO, Strnad P, Hanada S |title=Toward unraveling the complexity of simple epithelial keratins in human disease |journal=J.
