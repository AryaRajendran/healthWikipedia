A '''vaccine''' is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's [[immune system]] to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and "remember" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.

Vaccines may be [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future [[infection]] by any natural or "wild" [[pathogen]]), or [[Medication|therapeutic]] (e.g. vaccines against cancer are also being investigated; see [[cancer vaccine]]).

The term ''vaccine'' derives from [[Edward Jenner]]'s 1796 use of ''[[cowpox|cow pox]]'' ([[Latin]] ''variola vaccinia'', adapted from the Latin ''vaccīn-us'', from ''vacca'', cow), to inoculate [[human]]s, providing them protection against [[smallpox]].

This may be due to a lowered immunity in general (diabetes, steroid use, HIV infection, age) or because the host's immune system does not have a [[B cell]] capable of generating [[Antibody|antibodies]] to that [[antigen]].

Even if the host develops antibodies, the human immune system is not perfect and in any case the immune system might still not be able to defeat the infection immediately. In this case, the infection will be less severe and heal faster.

[[Immunologic adjuvant|Adjuvants]] are typically used to boost immune response. Most often aluminium adjuvants are used, but adjuvants like [[squalene]] are also used in some vaccines and more vaccines with squalene and phosphate adjuvants are being tested. Larger doses are used in some cases for older people (50–75 years and up), whose immune response to a given vaccine is not as strong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123406640|title=Adapting Vaccines For Our Aging Immune Systems}}</ref>

The [[vaccine efficacy|efficacy]] or performance of the vaccine is dependent on a number of factors:
* the disease itself (for some diseases vaccination performs better than for other diseases)
* the strain of vaccine (some vaccinations are for different strains of the disease)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/319/7206/352 |title=Comparative efficacy of three mumps vaccines during disease outbreak in eastern Switzerland: cohort study - Schlegel et al. 319 (7206): 352 - bmj.com |publisher=Bmj.bmjjournals.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref>
* whether one kept to the timetable for the vaccinations (''see [[Vaccination schedule]]'')
* some individuals are "non-responders" to certain vaccines, meaning that they do not generate antibodies even after being vaccinated correctly
* other factors such as ethnicity, age, or genetic predisposition.

When a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against, the disease is likely to be milder than without vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Préziosi|first1=M.|last2=Halloran|first2=M.E.|year=2003|title=Effects of Pertussis Vaccination on Disease: Vaccine Efficacy in Reducing Clinical Severity|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=37|issue=6|pages=772–779|publisher=Oxford Journals|doi=10.1086/377270| url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/6/772.full}}</ref>

The following are important considerations in the effectiveness of a vaccination program:{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In 1958 there were 763,094 cases of measles and 552 deaths in the [[United States]].<ref name="pmid15106120">{{cite journal |author=Orenstein WA, Papania MJ, Wharton ME |title=Measles elimination in the United States |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=189 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S1–3|year=2004 |pmid=15106120 |doi=10.1086/377693 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/377693 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18463608">{{cite journal |author= |title=Measles--United States, January 1-April 25, 2008 |journal=MMWR Morb.

==Importance==
The importance of vaccines has been noted:

: "The impact of vaccination on the health of the world's peoples is hard to exaggerate. With the exception of safe water, no other modality, not even antibiotics, has had such a major effect on mortality reduction and population growth."<ref name="Plotkin_Offit" />

==Types==
[[File:ReverseGeneticsFlu.svg|thumbnail|300px|[[Avian influenza|Avian flu]] vaccine development by [[reverse genetics]] techniques.]]
Vaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them.

There are several types of vaccines in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/vaccines/understanding/pages/typesvaccines.aspx |title=Vaccine Types |publisher=Niaid.nih.gov |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> These represent different strategies used to try to reduce risk of illness, while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response.

===Killed===
Some vaccines contain killed, but previously virulent, micro-organisms that have been destroyed with chemicals, heat, radioactivity or antibiotics. Examples are the [[influenza vaccine]], [[cholera vaccine]], [[bubonic plague vaccine]], [[polio vaccine]], [[hepatitis A vaccine]], and [[rabies vaccine]].

===Attenuated===
Some vaccines contain live, [[attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] microorganisms. Many of these are live [[viruses]] that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or which use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults. Examples include the viral diseases [[yellow fever]], [[measles]], [[rubella]], and [[mumps]] and the bacterial disease [[typhoid]]. The live Mycobacterium [[tuberculosis]] vaccine developed by Calmette and Guérin is not made of a [[Infectious disease|contagious]] strain, but contains a virulently modified strain called "[[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG]]" used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live attenuated vaccine containing strain [[Yersinia pestis]] EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. They have the capacity of transient growth so they give prolonged protection, and no booster dose is required. But they may get reverted to the virulent form and cause the disease.<ref name="Bhattacharya">{{cite book|author=J.K. Sinha & S. Bhattacharya|title=A Text Book of Immunology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ytCNCbCWx8oC&pg=PA318|accessdate=16 March 2012|publisher=Academic Publishers|isbn=978-81-89781-09-5|page=318}}</ref>

===Toxoid===
{{Main|Toxoid}}
[[Toxoid]] vaccines are made from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include [[tetanus]] and [[diphtheria]]. Toxoid vaccines are known for their efficacy. Not all toxoids are for micro-organisms; for example, ''[[Crotalus atrox]]'' toxoid is used to vaccinate dogs against [[rattlesnake]] bites.

===Subunit===
[[Protein subunit]]&nbsp;– rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated micro-organism to an immune system (which would constitute a "whole-agent" vaccine), a fragment of it can create an immune response. Examples include the subunit vaccine against [[Hepatitis B virus]] that is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus (previously extracted from the [[blood serum]] of chronically infected patients, but now produced by [[recombinant DNA|recombination]] of the viral genes into [[yeast]]), the [[virus-like particle]] (VLP) vaccine against [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) that is composed of the viral major [[capsid]] protein, and the [[hemagglutinin]] and [[neuraminidase]] subunits of the [[influenza]] virus. Subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization.

===Conjugate===
[[Conjugate vaccine|Conjugate]]&nbsp;– certain bacteria have [[polysaccharide]] outer coats that are poorly [[immunogenic]]. By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g. toxins), the [[immune system]] can be led to recognize the polysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen. This approach is used in the ''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B vaccine.

===Experimental===
A number of innovative vaccines are also in development and in use:
* Dendritic cell vaccines combine [[dendritic cell]]s with antigens in order to present the antigens to the body's white blood cells, thus stimulating an immune reaction. These vaccines have shown some positive preliminary results for treating brain tumors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kim W, Liau LM |title=Dendritic cell vaccines for brain tumors |journal=Neurosurg Clin N Am |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=139–57 |year=2010 |pmid=19944973 |pmc=2810429 |doi=10.1016/j.nec.2009.09.005 }}</ref>
* [[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] Vector&nbsp;– by combining the physiology of one micro-organism and the [[DNA]] of the other, immunity can be created against diseases that have complex infection processes
* [[DNA vaccination]]&nbsp;– in recent years{{When|date=July 2011}} a new type of vaccine called ''DNA vaccination'', created from an infectious agent's DNA, has been developed. It works by insertion (and [[Gene expression|expression]], triggering immune system recognition) of viral or bacterial DNA into human or animal cells. Some cells of the immune system that recognize the proteins expressed will mount an attack against these proteins and cells expressing them. Because these cells live for a very long time, if the [[pathogen]] that normally expresses these proteins is encountered at a later time, they will be attacked instantly by the immune system. One advantage of DNA vaccines is that they are very easy to produce and store. As of 2006, DNA vaccination is still experimental.
* [[T-cell receptor]] peptide vaccines are under development for several diseases using models of [[Valley Fever]], [[stomatitis]], and [[atopic dermatitis]]. These peptides have been shown to modulate [[cytokine]] production and improve cell mediated immunity.
* Targeting of identified bacterial proteins that are involved in complement inhibition would neutralize the key bacterial virulence mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19388175 | last1 = Meri | first1 = S | last2 = Jördens | first2 = M | last3 = Jarva | first3 = H | title = Microbial complement inhibitors as vaccines | journal = Vaccine | volume=26 Suppl 8 | year=2008 | month=December | pages=I113–7 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.11.058}}</ref>

While most vaccines are created using inactivated or attenuated compounds from micro-organisms, [[synthetic vaccine]]s are composed mainly or wholly of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates or antigens.

===Valence===
Vaccines may be ''monovalent'' (also called ''univalent'') or ''multivalent'' (also called ''polyvalent''). A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000067458.htm|Monovalent}}</ref> A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms.<ref>[http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSz000113928zPzhtm Polyvalent vaccine] at ''[[Dorland's medical reference works|Dorlands Medical Dictionary]]''</ref> In certain cases a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pediatriconcall.com/fordoctor/medical_original_articles/oral_polio_vaccine.asp|title=Questions and answers on monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1) "Issued jointly by WHO and UNICEF"}}</ref>

==Developing immunity==
The immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and "remembers" them. When the [[virulence|virulent]] version of an agent is encountered, the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus, and thus is prepared to respond, by (1) neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and (2) by recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.

When two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components. This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin [[polio vaccine]], where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the "take" of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sutter RW, Cochi SL, Melnick JL|year=1999|chapter=Live attenuated polio vaccines|editor=Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA (eds.)|title=Vaccines|location=Philadelphia|publisher=W. B. Saunders|pages=364–408}}</ref> This phenomenon has also been found to be a problem with the [[dengue]] vaccines currently being researched,{{When|date=July 2011}} where the DEN-3 serotype was found to predominate and suppress the response to DEN-1, -2 and -4 serotypes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kanesa-thasan N|year=2001|title=Safety and immunogenicity of attenuated dengue virus vaccines (Aventis Pasteur) in human volunteers|journal=Vaccine|volume=19|issue=23–24|pages=3179–3188|pmid=11312014|doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(01)00020-2|author-separator=,|author2=Sun W|author3=Kim-Ahn G|display-authors=3|last4=Van Albert|first4=S.|last5=Putnak|first5=J.R.|last6=King|first6=A.|last7=Raengsakulsrach|first7=B.|last8=Christ-Schmidt|first8=H.|last9=Gilson|first9=K.}}</ref>

Vaccines have contributed to the eradication of [[smallpox]], one of the most contagious and deadly diseases known to man. Other diseases such as rubella, [[poliomyelitis|polio]], measles, mumps, [[chickenpox]], and [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called [[herd immunity]]. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradication campaign]] that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of four countries ([[Afghanistan]], [[India]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Pakistan]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5627a3.htm?s_cid=mm5627a3_e |title=Progress Toward Interruption of Wild Poliovirus Transmission - Worldwide, January 2006-May 2007 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> The difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings, however, have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.

==Schedule==
{{main|Vaccination schedule}}
:''For country-specific information on vaccination policies and practices, see: [[Vaccination policy]]''

In order to provide best protection, children are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional "booster" shots often required to achieve "full immunity". This has led to the development of complex vaccination schedules. In the United States, the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]], which recommends schedule additions for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], recommends routine vaccination of children against: [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis B virus|hepatitis B]], polio, mumps, measles, rubella, [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], [[tetanus]], [[Haemophilus influenzae|HiB]], chickenpox, [[rotavirus]], [[influenza]], [[meningococcal disease]] and [[pneumonia]].<ref>[http://aapredbook.aappublications.org/news/vaccstatus.dtl "Vaccine Status Table"] ''Red Book Online'' American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) April 26, 2011</ref> The large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., [[Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine]] and [[MMRV vaccine]]), which provide protection against multiple diseases.

Besides recommendations for infant vaccinations and boosters, many specific vaccines are recommended at other ages or for repeated injections throughout life—most commonly for measles, tetanus, influenza, and pneumonia. Pregnant women are often screened for continued resistance to rubella. The [[human papillomavirus]] vaccine is recommended in the U.S. (as of 2011<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccines/HPV/gardasil.html| publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>) and UK (as of 2009<ref>{{cite news|title=HPV vaccine in the clear|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2009/09September/Pages/Cervical-cancer-vaccine-QA.aspx|newspaper=NHS choices|date=October 2, 2009}}</ref>). Vaccine recommendations for the elderly concentrate on pneumonia and influenza, which are more deadly to that group. In 2006, a vaccine was introduced against [[Herpes zoster|shingles]], a disease caused by the chickenpox virus, which usually affects the elderly.

==History==
[[File:Eduard Jenner.jpg|thumb|160px|Edward Jenner]]
Prior to vaccination, [[inoculation]] was practised, and [[Inoculation#Importation to the West|brought to the West]] in 1721 by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]], who showed it to [[Hans Sloane]], the King's physician.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Sometime during the 1770s [[Edward Jenner]] heard a [[milkmaid]] boast that she would never have the often-fatal or disfiguring disease [[smallpox]], because she had already had [[cowpox]], which has a very mild effect in humans. In 1796, Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox, [[Inoculation|inoculated]] an 8-year-old boy with it, and six weeks later [[Variolation|variolated]] the boy's arm with smallpox, afterwards observing that the boy did not catch smallpox.<ref name=Stern-Markel>{{cite journal |author= Stern AM, Markel H |title= The history of vaccines and immunization: familiar patterns, new challenges |journal= Health Aff |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=611–21 |year=2005|pmid=15886151 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/24/3/611}}</ref><ref name=Dunn>{{cite journal |author=Dunn PM |title=Dr Edward Jenner (1749-1823) of Berkeley, and vaccination against smallpox |journal=Arch.

The twentieth century saw the introduction of several successful vaccines, including those against [[diphtheria]], [[measles]], [[mumps]], and [[rubella]]. Major achievements included the development of the [[polio vaccine]] in the 1950s and the [[Eradication of smallpox|eradication of smallpox]] during the 1960s and 1970s. [[Maurice Hilleman]] was the most prolific of the developers of the vaccines in the twentieth century. As vaccines became more common, many people began taking them for granted. However, vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases, including [[malaria]] and [[HIV]].<ref name="Stern-Markel"/>

===Economics of development===
One challenge in vaccine development is economic: many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including [[HIV]], [[malaria]] and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and [[biotechnology]] companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases, because there is little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.<ref name='market_return'>{{cite news | first=Jesse L. | last=Goodman | title=Statement by Jesse L. Goodman, M.D., M.P.H.

Most vaccine development to date has relied on "push" funding by government, universities and non-profit organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Olesen OF, Lonnroth A, Mulligan B |title=Human vaccine research in the European Union |journal=Vaccine |year=2009 |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=640–5 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.11.064 |pmid=19059446 }}</ref> Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for [[public health]].<ref name='market_return' /> The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades.{{When|date=July 2011}} This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ihara | pmid = 19366578 | first1 = Toshiaki | title = The strategy for prevention of measles and rubella prevalence with measles–rubella (MR) vaccine in Japan | doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.02.075 | journal = Vaccine | volume=27 | issue=24 | year=2009 | month=May | pages=3234–6}}</ref> may be due to government mandates and support, rather than economic incentive.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Patents===
The filing of [[patent]]s on vaccine development processes can also be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines. Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product, the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used on the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of [[secrecy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hardman Reis T |title= The role of intellectual property in the global challenge for immunization |journal= J World Intellect Prop |year=2006 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=413–25 |doi=10.1111/j.1422-2213.2006.00284.x}}</ref>

==Production==
[[File:Preparation of measles vaccines.jpg|thumb|Two workers make openings in chicken eggs in preparation for production of measles vaccine.]]
Vaccine production has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza), or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for [[hepatitis A]]).<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2009/11/24/GR2009112401834.html "Three ways to make a vaccine"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref> Bacteria are grown in [[bioreactor]]s (e.g., ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' type b). Alternatively, a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus may need to be inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc |year=2009 |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=e87–99 |title=Vaccine supply, demand, and policy: a primer |author=Muzumdar JM, Cline RR |pmid=19589753 |doi=10.1331/JAPhA.2009.09007 }}</ref> Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.<ref name=Bae/>

Vaccine production techniques are evolving. Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs, due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination. Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccine is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids. Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s.<ref name=Bae>{{cite journal |journal=Arch Pharm Res |year=2009 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=465–80 |title=Innovative vaccine production technologies: the evolution and value of vaccine production technologies |author=Bae K, Choi J, Jang Y, Ahn S, Hur B |pmid=19407962 |doi=10.1007/s12272-009-1400-1 }}</ref>

In 2010, India produced 60 percent of the world's vaccine worth about $900 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/77598/india-produces-60-percent-of-worlds-vaccines |title=India produces 60 percent of world's vaccines |date=November 15, 2011}}</ref>

===Excipients===
Beside the active vaccine itself, the following [[excipient]]s are commonly present in vaccine preparations:<ref name=cdc>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm |author=CDC| title=Ingredients of Vaccines&nbsp;— Fact Sheet|accessdate=december 20, 2009}}</ref>
* [[Aluminum]] salts or gels are added as adjuvants. Adjuvants are added to promote an earlier, more potent response, and more persistent immune response to the vaccine; they allow for a lower vaccine dosage.
* [[Antibiotic]]s are added to some vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria during production and storage of the vaccine.
* Egg [[protein]] is present in influenza and yellow fever vaccines as they are prepared using chicken eggs. Other proteins may be present.
* [[Formaldehyde]] is used to inactivate bacterial products for toxoid vaccines. Formaldehyde is also used to kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production.
* [[Monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) and 2-[[phenoxyethanol]] are used as stabilizers in a few vaccines to help the vaccine remain unchanged when the vaccine is exposed to heat, light, acidity, or humidity.
* [[Thimerosal]] is a mercury-containing preservative that is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose to prevent contamination and growth of potentially harmful bacteria.

===Role of preservatives===
Many vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' infection, which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a [[diphtheria]] vaccine that lacked a preservative.<ref>{{cite web |date=2007-09-06 |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228 |accessdate=2007-10-01 |title= Thimerosal in vaccines |publisher= Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}</ref> Several preservatives are available, including [[thiomersal]], [[phenoxyethanol]], and [[formaldehyde]]. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, has a better shelf life, and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety, but in the U.S., the [[European Union]], and a few other affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] content.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Drug Saf |year=2005 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=89–101 |title= Thiomersal in vaccines: balancing the risk of adverse effects with the risk of vaccine-preventable disease |author= Bigham M, Copes R |pmid=15691220 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200528020-00001}}</ref> Although [[Thiomersal controversy|controversial claims]] have been made that thiomersal contributes to [[autism spectrum disorder|autism]], no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1278–9 |title= Thimerosal and vaccines—a cautionary tale |author= Offit PA | authorlink = Paul Offit |doi=10.1056/NEJMp078187 |pmid=17898096 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp078187 | format = PDF }}</ref>

==Delivery systems==
[[File:VaccineBySandraRugio.jpg|thumb|right|Woman receiving rubella vaccination, Brazil, 2008.]]
There are several new delivery systems in development{{When|date=July 2011}} in the hope of making vaccines more efficient to deliver. Possible methods include [[liposome]]s and ''[[ISCOM]]'' (immune stimulating complex).<ref>{{cite journal |author= Morein B, Hu KF, Abusugra I |title= Current status and potential application of ISCOMs in veterinary medicine |journal= Adv Drug Deliv Rev |volume=56 |issue=10 |pages=1367–82 |year=2004 |pmid=15191787 |doi=10.1016/j.addr.2004.02.004}}</ref>

The latest developments{{When|date=July 2011}} in vaccine delivery technologies have resulted in oral vaccines. A polio vaccine was developed and tested by volunteer vaccinations with no formal training; the results were positive in that the ease of the vaccines increased. With an oral vaccine, there is no risk of blood contamination. Oral vaccines are likely to be solid which have proven to be more stable and less likely to freeze{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}; this stability reduces the need for a "[[cold chain]]": the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration, which, in turn, may decrease costs of vaccines. A microneedle approach, which is still in stages of development, uses "pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin".<ref>{{cite journal |author= Giudice EL, Campbell JD |title= Needle-free vaccine delivery |journal= Adv Drug Deliv Rev |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=68–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16564111 |doi=10.1016/j.addr.2005.12.003}}</ref>

A nanopatch is a needle free vaccine delivery system which is under development. A stamp-sized patch similar to an [[adhesive bandage]] contains about 20,000 microscopic projections per square inch.<ref>{{cite news|title=Australian scientists develop 'needle-free' vaccination|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/medicine-and-research/australian-scientists-develop-needlefree-vaccination/article2493365.ece|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=28 September 2011}}</ref> When worn on the skin, it will deliver vaccine directly to the skin, which has a higher concentration of immune cells than that in the muscles{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}, where needles and syringes deliver.  It thus increases the effectiveness of the vaccination using a lower amount of vaccine used in traditional syringe delivery system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Needle-free nanopatch vaccine delivery system|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20110803/Needle-free-nanopatch-vaccine-delivery-system.aspx|publisher=News Medical|date=3 August 2011}}</ref>

===Plasmids===
The use of [[plasmid]]s has been validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies this approach has failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.<ref name= Lowe>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/pla|author= Lowe|year=2008|chapter=Plasmid DNA as Prophylactic and Therapeutic vaccines for Cancer and Infectious Diseases|title=Plasmids: Current Research and Future Trends|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/pla |display-authors=1 |isbn=978-1-904455-35-6]}}</ref>

Vaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Patel | pmid = 19402200 | first1 = JR | last2 = Heldens | first2 = JG | title = Immunoprophylaxis against important virus disease of horses, farm animals and birds | journal = Vaccine | volume=27 | issue=12 | year=2009 | month=March | pages=1797–1810 | doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.12.063}}</ref> Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated. In some instances, wild populations may be vaccinated. This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine-laced food spread in a disease-prone area and has been used to attempt to control [[rabies]] in [[raccoon]]s.

Where rabies occurs, rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law. Other canine vaccines include [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[adenovirus-2]], [[leptospirosis]], [[bordetella|bordatella]], [[canine parainfluenza virus]], and [[Lyme disease]] among others.

==DIVA vaccines==
DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccines make it possible to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals.

===Principle===
DIVA vaccines carry at least one epitope less than the microorganisms circulating in the field. An accompanying diagnostic test that detects antibody against that epitope allows us to actually make that differentiation.

===The first DIVA vaccines===
The first DIVA vaccines (formerly termed [[marker vaccine]]s and since 1999 coined as DIVA vaccines) and companion diagnostic tests have been developed by
J.T. van Oirschot and colleagues at the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad, The Netherlands.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Oirschot JT, Rziha HJ, Moonen PJ, Pol JM, Van Zaane D |title=Differentiation of serum antibodies from pigs vaccinated or infected with Aujeszky's disease virus by a competitive enzyme immunoassay |journal=The Journal of General Virology |year=1986 |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=1179–82 |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-67-6-1179}}</ref>
<ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Oirschot JT |title=Diva vaccines that reduce virus transmission |journal=Journal of Biotechnology |year=1999 |volume=73 |issue=2–3 |pages=195–205 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1656(99)00121-2 |pmid=10486928}}</ref>
They found that some existing vaccines against pseudorabies (also termed Aujeszky’s disease) had deletions in their viral genome (amongst which the gE gene. Monoclonal antibodies were produced against that deletion and selected to develop an ELISA that demonstrated antibodies against gE. In addition, novel genetically engineered gE-negative vaccines were constructed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Oirschot JT, Gielkens ALJ, Moormann RJM, Berns AJM |title=Marker vaccines, virus protein-specific antibody assays and the control of Aujeszky's disease |journal=Veterinary Microbiology |year=1990 |volume=23 |issue=1–4 |pages=85–101 |doi=10.1016/0378-1135(90)90139-M |pmid=2169682}}</ref>
Along the same lines, DIVA vaccines and companion diagnostic tests against bovine herpesvirus 1 infections have been developed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Oirschot JT |title=Diva vaccines that reduce virus transmission |journal=Journal of Biotechnology |year=1999 |volume=73 |issue=2–3 |pages=195–205|doi=10.1016/S0168-1656(99)00121-2 |pmid=10486928}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaashoek MJ, Moerman A, Madic J, Rijsewijk FAM, Quak J, Gielkens ALJ, Van Oirschot JT |title=A conventionally attenuated glycoprotein E-negative strain of bovine herpesvirus type 1 is an efficacious and safe vaccine |journal=Vaccine |year=1994 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=439–44 |doi=10.1016/0264-410X(94)90122-8 |pmid=8023552}}</ref>

===Use in practice===
The DIVA strategy has been applied in various countries and successfully eradicated pseudorabies virus. Swine populations were intensively vaccinated and monitored by the companion diagnostic test and subsequently the infected pigs were removed from the population. Bovine herpesvirus 1 DIVA vaccines are also widely used in practice.

===Other DIVA vaccines (under development)===
Scientists have put and still are putting much effort in applying the DIVA principle to a wide range of infectious diseases, such as, for example, classical swine fever,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hulst MM, Westra DF, Wensvoort G, Moormann RJM|title=Glycoprotein E1 of hog cholera virus expressed in insect cells protects swine from hog cholera |journal=Journal of Virology |year=1993 |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=5435–5442 |pmc=237945 |pmid=8350404}}</ref> avian influenza,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Capua I, Terregino C, Cattoli G, Mutinelli F, RodriguezJF |title=Development of a DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy using a vaccine containing a heterologous neuraminidase for the control of avian influenza |journal=Avian Pathology |year=2003 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=47–55 |doi=10.1080/0307945021000070714 |pmid=12745380}}</ref> Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maas A, Meens J, Baltes N, Hennig-Pauka I, Gerlach G-F |title=Development of a DIVA subunit vaccine against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection |journal=Vaccine |year=2006 |volume=24 |issue=49 |pages=7226–32 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.06.047

==Trends==
Vaccine development has several trends:<ref name=Plotkin>{{cite journal |author=Plotkin SA |title=Vaccines: past, present and future |journal=Nat Med |volume=11 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=S5–11 |year=2005 |pmid=15812490 |doi=10.1038/nm1209 }}</ref>
