'''Thomas Green Fessenden''' (22 April 1771 [[Walpole, New Hampshire]] – 11 November 1837 [[Boston]]) was an author and editor who worked in [[England]] and the [[United States]].

==Biography==
He graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1796. During his college term wrote a ballad, entitled “Jonathan's Courtship,” which was reprinted in England. He studied law in Vermont with Nathaniel Chipman, occupying his leisure in writing humorous poems and other papers for the “Farmer's Weekly Museum” of Walpole, of which Joseph Dennie was then editor.

He went to [[London]] in 1801 as agent for a new hydraulic machine. The enterprise proved a failure and involved him in pecuniary difficulties. While in London, he became interested in the construction of a patent mill on the Thames, and in this enterprise also he was completely ruined. At this time, he formed the acquaintance of Benjamin Douglas Perkins, patentee of the metallic tractors (see [[Elisha Perkins]]) which Fessenden advertised in a poem in [[Hudibrastic verse]]. The poem, “Terrible Tractoration,” was anonymously published in 1803 and satirized the members of the medical profession who opposed the use of the instruments. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] characterized the poem as “a work of strange, grotesque ideas, aptly expressed.” The poem was enlarged and republished in New York in 1806 as “The Minute Philosopher.”

Fessenden returned to the United States in 1804 and settled in Boston. Later he went to [[New York City]] and edited the ''Weekly Inspector'' for two years. In 1812, he began to practise law in [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]]. He moved to [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], in 1815, and was editor of the ''Reporter'' there.  He returned to Bellows Falls from 1816 till 1822 to conduct the ''Intelligencer''.  In 1822, he went to Boston and founded the ''New England Farmer'' with which he was connected until his death. He also edited “The Horticultural Register” and “The Silk Manual.”  

Nathaniel Hawthorne included a piece on Fessenden in his ''Fanshawe, and other Pieces'' (Boston, 1876).

William Fessenden, of Cambridge, and uncle to [[Samuel Fessenden]], the father of [[William P. Fessenden]]. After graduation at Harvard in 1758, the elder Thomas became pastor in [[Walpole, New Hampshire]], which charge he held from 1767 until 1813. He was author of ''The Science of Sanctity'' (1804), and ''The Boston Self-styled Gentlemen-Reviewers reviewed'' (1806).
