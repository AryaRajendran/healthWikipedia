'''RTS,S''' or '''Mosquirix''' is an experimental [[malaria vaccine|vaccine for malaria]].<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/18/us-malaria-vaccine-scientist-idUSTRE79H59220111018 "Malaria scientist celebrates success after 24 years".]</ref>

A completely effective [[vaccine]] is not yet available for malaria, although several vaccines are under development. SPf66 was tested extensively in endemic areas in the 1990s, but clinical trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16625647 |year=2006 |author=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (SPf66) |issue=2 |pages=CD005966 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005966 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the malaria parasite's life cycle, have also been insufficient on their own.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17054281 |year=2006 |author=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (blood-stage) |issue=4 |pages=CD006199 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006199 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref> RTS,S is one of several potential vaccines under development that target the pre-erythrocytic stage of the disease. Among them, RTS,S has shown the most promising results so far.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17054280 |year=2006 |author=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (pre-erythrocytic) |issue=4 |pages=CD006198 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006198 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref>

In November 2012, findings from a Phase III trial of RTS,S reported that it provided modest protection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants. The RTS,S vaccine was engineered using genes from the outer protein of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' malaria parasite and a portion of a hepatitis B virus and a chemical adjuvant to boost the immune system response.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMoa1208394}}</ref> The RTS,S-based vaccine formulation had previously been demonstrated to be safe, well tolerated, immunogenic, and to potentially confer partial efficacy in both malaria-naive and -experienced adults as well as children, although further research was considered necessary to improve the effectiveness of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1586/erv.11.57}}</ref> RTS,S is being developed by [[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health|PATH]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].<ref>Stein, R.
