'''Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy''' is a subgroup of the myofibrillar myopathy diseases and is the result of a mutation in the gene that codes for [[desmin]] which prevents it from forming [[protein filament]]s, instead forming aggregates of desmin and other proteins throughout the cell.<ref name="Bar">{{cite journal | author = Bär H, Strelkov SV, Sjöberg G, Aebi U, Herrmann H | title = The biology of desmin filaments: how do mutations affect their structure, assembly, and organisation? | journal = J.

==Pathophysiology==
The sarcomeres become misaligned and result in the disorganization of muscle fibers.<ref name="Bar"/> This mutation also results in muscle cell death by apoptosis and necrosis.<ref name="Bar"/> The muscle cell may also be disorganized because the aggregates may interrupt other filament structures and/or normal cellular function.<ref name="Goldfarb">{{cite journal | author = Goldfarb LG, Vicart P, Goebel HH, Dalakas MC | title = Desmin myopathy | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 723–34 | year = 2004 | month = April | pmid = 14724127 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh033 | url = | issn = }}</ref> 

Desminopathies are very rare diseases and only 60 patients have been diagnosed with so far, however this number probably does not accurately represent the population due to frequent mis or under diagnosis.<ref name="Goldfarb"/>

==Presentation==
Common symptoms of the disease are weakness and atrophy in the distal muscles of the lower limbs which progresses to the hands and arms, then to the trunk, neck and face. Respiratory impairment often follows.

==Inheritance==
There are three major types of inheritance for this disease: Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and de novo. 

* The most severe form is autosomal recessive and it also has the earliest onset.<ref name="Goldfarb"/> It usually involves all three muscle tissues and leads to cardiac and respiratory failure as well as intestinal obstruction.<ref name="Goldfarb"/>
* Autosomal Dominant inheritance shows a later onset and slower progression. It usually involves only one or two of the muscle tissues.<ref name="Goldfarb"/>
* De novo diseases occur when a new mutation arises in the person that was not inherited through either parent. This form has a wide range of symptoms and varies depending on the mutation made.<ref name="Goldfarb"/>

==Treatment==
There is currently no cure for the disease but treatments to help the symptoms are available.<ref name="Goldfarb"/>
