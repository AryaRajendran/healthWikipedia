'''''Streptococcus pyogenes''''' is a [[coccus|spherical]], [[Gram-positive]] [[bacterium]] that is the cause of [[group A streptococcal infection]]s.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> ''S. pyogenes'' displays streptococcal group A [[antigen]] on its [[cell wall]]. ''S. pyogenes''  typically produces large zones of [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|beta-hemolysis]] (the complete disruption of [[erythrocyte]]s and the release of [[hemoglobin]]) when cultured on blood [[agar plate]]s, and are therefore also called Group A (beta-hemolytic) ''[[Streptococcus]]'' (abbreviated ''GABHS'').

Streptococci are [[catalase]]-negative. In ideal conditions, ''S. pyogenes'' has an incubation period of approximately 1–3 days.<ref name=WisconsinDoHS>{{citation | url=http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/FactSheets/StreptococcalPharyngitis.htm }}</ref> It is an infrequent, but usually pathogenic, part of the [[skin flora]].

It is estimated that there are more than 700 million infections world wide each year and over 650,000 cases of severe, invasive infections that have a mortality rate of 25%.<ref>

== Serotyping ==

In 1928, [[Rebecca Lancefield]] published a method for serotyping ''S. pyogenes'' based on its [[M protein (Streptococcus)|M protein]], a [[virulence]] factor displayed on its surface.<ref name=Lancefield_1928>{{cite journal | author = Lancefield RC| title = The antigenic complex of ''Streptococcus hemolyticus'' | journal = J Exp Med | year = 1928 | volume = 47 | pages = 9–10 | url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/47/1/91| doi = 10.1084/jem.47.1.91 | issue=1}}</ref> Later in 1946, Lancefield described the serologic classification of ''S. pyogenes'' isolates based on their surface ''T antigen''.<ref name=Lancefield_1946>{{cite journal | author = Lancefield RC, Dole VP | title = The properties of T antigen extracted from group A hemolytic streptococci | journal = J Exp Med | year = 1946 | volume = 84 | pages = 449–71 | doi= 10.1084/jem.84.5.449 | issue = 5 }}</ref>  Four of the 20 T antigens have been revealed to be [[pilus|pili]], which are used by bacteria to attach to host cells.<ref name=Mora_2005>{{cite journal |author=Mora M, Bensi G, Capo S, et al. |title=Group A Streptococcus produce pilus-like structures containing protective antigens and Lancefield T antigens |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=102 |issue=43 |pages=15641–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16223875 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0507808102 |pmc=1253647}}</ref> Over 100 M serotypes and approximately 20 T serotypes are known. The disease was widely publicized in the early 90's as it was the cause of death of [[Jim Henson]].

== Pathogenesis ==
{{See also|Group A streptococcal infection}}

''S. pyogenes'' is the cause of many important human diseases, ranging from mild superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic diseases.<ref name=Sherris/> Infections typically begin in the throat or skin.  Examples of mild ''S. pyogenes'' infections include [[pharyngitis]] ("strep throat") and localized skin infection ("[[impetigo]]").  [[Erysipelas]] and [[cellulitis]] are characterized by multiplication and lateral spread of ''S. pyogenes'' in deep layers of the skin. ''S. pyogenes'' invasion and multiplication in the [[fascia]] can lead to [[necrotizing fasciitis]], a life-threatening condition requiring surgery.

Infections due to certain strains of ''S. pyogenes'' can be associated with the release of bacterial [[toxin]]s. Throat infections associated with release of certain toxins lead to [[scarlet fever]].  Other toxigenic ''S. pyogenes'' infections may lead to streptococcal [[toxic shock syndrome]], which can be life-threatening.<ref name=Sherris/>

''S. pyogenes'' can also cause disease in the form of postinfectious "nonpyogenic" (not associated with local bacterial multiplication and pus formation) syndromes. These [[autoimmune]]-mediated complications follow a small percentage of infections and include [[rheumatic fever]] and acute postinfectious [[glomerulonephritis]]. Both conditions appear several weeks following the initial streptococcal infection.  [[Rheumatic fever]] is characterised by inflammation of the joints and/or heart following an episode of [[streptococcal pharyngitis]].  Acute [[glomerulonephritis]], inflammation of the [[kidney|renal]] [[glomerulus]], can follow streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection.

This bacterium remains acutely sensitive to [[penicillin]]. Failure of treatment with [[penicillin]] is generally attributed to other local commensal organisms producing β-lactamase, or failure to achieve adequate tissue levels in the pharynx.  Certain strains have developed resistance to [[macrolides]], [[tetracyclines]], and [[clindamycin]].

== Virulence factors ==

''S. pyogenes'' has several [[virulence]] factors that enable it to attach to host tissues, evade the immune response, and spread by penetrating host tissue layers.<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = Patterson  MJ | title = Streptococcus. ''In:'' Baron's Medical Microbiology ''(Baron S ''et al.'', eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.824 | isbn= 0-9631172-1-1 }}</ref>  A carbohydrate-based [[bacterial capsule]] composed of [[hyaluronic acid]] surrounds the bacterium, protecting it from [[phagocytosis]] by [[neutrophils]].<ref name=Sherris/> In addition, the capsule and several factors embedded in the cell wall, including [[M protein (Streptococcus)|M protein]], [[lipoteichoic acid]], and protein F (SfbI) facilitate attachment to various host cells.<ref name=Bisno_2003>{{cite journal | author=Bisno AL, Brito MO, Collins CM | title=Molecular basis of group A streptococcal virulence | journal=Lancet Infect Dis | year=2003 | pages=191–200 | volume=3 | issue=4 | pmid=12679262  | doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00576-0}}</ref>  M protein also inhibits [[opsonization]] by the alternative [[complement system|complement pathway]] by binding to host complement regulators.  The M protein found on some serotypes is also able to prevent opsonization by binding to [[fibrinogen]].<ref name=Sherris/>  However, the M protein is also the weakest point in this pathogen's defense, as [[Antibody|antibodies]] produced by the [[immune system]] against M protein target the bacteria for engulfment by [[phagocytes]].  M proteins are unique to each strain, and identification can be used clinically to confirm the strain causing an infection.

''S. pyogenes'' releases a number of proteins, including several virulence factors, into its host:<ref name=Sherris/>

|-
|Streptolysin O
|An [[exotoxin]] that is one of the bases of the organism's beta-hemolytic property.
|-
|Streptolysin S
|A cardiotoxic exotoxin that is another beta-hemolytic component. Streptolysin S is not immunogenic and O<sub>2</sub> stable.  A potent cell poison affecting many types of cell including neutrophils, platelets, and sub-cellular organelles, streptolysin S causes an immune response and detection of antibodies to it; antistreptolysin O (ASO) can be clinically used to confirm a recent infection.

|Streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin A (SpeA)
|rowspan=2|[[Superantigen]]s secreted by many strains of ''S. pyogenes''.  This pyrogenic exotoxin is responsible for the [[rash]] of [[scarlet fever]] and many of the symptoms of streptococcal [[toxic shock syndrome]].
|-
|Streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin C (SpeC)
|-
|[[Streptokinase]]
|Enzymatically activates [[plasminogen]], a proteolytic enzyme, into [[plasmin]], which in turn digests [[fibrin]] and other proteins.
|-
|[[Hyaluronidase]]
|It is widely assumed [[hyaluronidase]] facilitates the spread of the bacteria through tissues by breaking down [[hyaluronic acid]], an important component of [[connective tissue]].  However, very few isolates of ''S. pyogenes'' are capable of secreting active hyaluronidase due to mutations in the gene that encode the enzyme.  Moreover, the few isolates that are capable of secreting hyaluronidase do not appear to need it to spread through tissues or to cause skin lesions.<ref name=Starr_2006>{{cite journal |author=Starr C, Engleberg N |title=Role of Hyaluronidase in Subcutaneous Spread and Growth of Group A Streptococcus |journal=Infect Immun |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=40–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16368955 |doi=10.1128/IAI.74.1.40-48.2006 |pmc=1346594}}</ref>  Thus, the true role of hyaluronidase in pathogenesis, if any, remains unknown.
|-
|Streptodornase
|Most strains of ''S. pyogenes'' secrete up to four different [[DNase]]s, which are sometimes called ''streptodornase''.

== Diagnosis ==

Usually, a throat swab is taken to the laboratory for testing. A [[Gram stain]] is performed to show Gram-positive cocci in chains. Then, the organism is cultured on [[blood agar]] with an added [[bacitracin]] antibiotic disk to show [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|beta-hemolytic]] colonies and sensitivity (zone of inhibition around the disk) for the antibiotic. Culture on non-blood containing agar then, perform [[catalase]] test, which should show a negative reaction for all ''Streptococci''. ''S. pyogenes'' is CAMP (not to be confused with cAMP) and [[hippurate]] tests negative. Serological identification of the organism involves testing for the presence of group A specific polysaccharide in the bacterium's cell wall using the [[Phadebact test]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11526182 |pmc=88350 | volume=39 | issue=9 |title=Identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae revisited |year=2001 |month=September |author=Kellogg JA, Bankert DA, Elder CJ, Gibbs JL, Smith MC |journal=J.

Clin. Microbiol. |pages=391–4}}</ref>

== Treatment ==

The treatment of choice is [[penicillin]] and the duration of treatment is well established as being 10 days minimum.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Falagas ME, Vouloumanou EK, Matthaiou DK, Kapaskelis AM, Karageorgopoulos DE|title=Effectiveness and safety of short-course vs long-course antibiotic therapy for group a beta hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis: a meta-analysis of randomized trials|journal=Mayo Clin Proc|year=2008|volume=83|issue=8|pages=880–9|pmid=18674472|doi=10.4065/83.8.880}}</ref>  There has been no reported instance of penicillin resistance to date, although since 1985, there have been many reports of penicillin tolerance.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Pediatr|year=1985|volume=107|issue=5|pages=681–4|title=Association of penicillin tolerance with failure to eradicate group A streptococci from patients with pharyngitis|author=Kim KS, Kaplan EL|pmid=3903089|doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(85)80392-9}}</ref>

[[Macrolides]], [[chloramphenicol]], and [[tetracycline]]s may be used if the strain isolated has been shown to be sensitive, but resistance is much more common.

== Prevention ==

No vaccines are currently available to protect against ''S. pyogenes'' infection, although there has been research into the development of one. Difficulties in developing a vaccine include the wide variety of strains of ''S. pyogenes'' present in the environment and the large amount of time and people that will be needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR) - Group A Streptococcus|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/soa_bacterial/en/index3.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>
