==Method==
[[File:My gomco circ may96.jpg|right|thumb|A 22-year-old Canadian man being circumcised with a Gomco clamp.]]
The technique is as follows:<ref>{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Peleg |first2=Ann |last2=Steiner |title=The Gomco Circumcision: Common Problems and Solutions |journal=American Family Physician |pmid=9767725 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=9767725 |year=1998 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=891–8}}</ref>
# [[Anesthetic]] should be applied (though it is a historically recent addition, dating only to approximately the early 1990s).
# The [[foreskin]] is gripped with two [[hemostat]]s (tissue holders) and a tool is inserted between his foreskin and [[glans]].<ref name="children.webmd"/>
# Once separated, a hemostat is used to pull his foreskin lengthwise in order to reduce bleeding.<ref name="children.webmd"> HealthWise Medical Reference, Available online at: http://children.webmd.com/tc/circumcision-what-happens-during-a-circumcision Last Updated: February 19, 2008.</ref> 
# Next, the foreskin is cut lengthwise through the stretched tissue ([[dorsal slit]]) to allow space to insert the circumcision device.<ref name="children.webmd" /> 
# The bell of the Gomco clamp is placed over the glans, and the foreskin is pulled over the bell.
# The base of the Gomco clamp is placed over the bell, and the Gomco clamp's arm is fitted.
# After the surgeon confirms correct fitting and placement (and the amount of foreskin to be excised), the nut on the Gomco clamp is tightened, causing the clamping of nerves and blood flow to the foreskin.
# The Gomco clamp is left in place for about five minutes to allow clotting to occur, then the foreskin is severed using a scalpel.
# The Gomco's base and bell are then removed.

==Advantages==
* The [[circumcision scar]] is straight.
* The circumcision is relatively quick compared to the more recent [[Plastibell]].

==Disadvantages==
* Involves several small parts, all of which must be sterile so as to ensure the safety of the patient and minimize the risk of [[infection]]. 
* Procedure takes longer than the traditional [[Jewish Shield]] or [[Mogen Clamp]] techniques.
* The scar is more visible.

==Prevalence==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
[[File:Justin Roger Hayes - Gomco clamp scar.jpg|thumb|right|Distinctive brown ring scar resulting from neonatal circumcision using the Gomco clamp method]]
Probably over 75% of circumcised American men born between 1950 and 1980 were circumcised with a Gomco clamp or a variant. The presence of a light brown ring, typically one inch behind the corona, probably indicates a Gomco circumcision.
