'''Gerstmann syndrome''' is a [[neurology|neurological]] disorder that is characterized by a constellation of symptoms that suggests the presence of a [[lesion]] in a particular area of the brain. (It should not be confused with [[Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome]], which is a [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]].)

It is named for [[Josef Gerstmann]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2267}}</ref>

==Primary symptoms==
Gerstmann syndrome is characterized by four primary symptoms:
# [[Dysgraphia]]/agraphia: deficiency in the ability to write<ref name="Vallar 2007">{{cite journal |author=Vallar G |title=Spatial neglect, Balint-Homes' and Gerstmann's syndrome, and other spatial disorders |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=527–36 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17603404 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="Carota, 2004">{{cite journal |author=Carota A, Di Pietro M, Ptak R, Poglia D, Schnider A |title=Defective spatial imagery with pure Gerstmann's syndrome |journal=Eur.

# [[Dyscalculia]]/acalculia:  difficulty in learning or comprehending mathematics<ref name="Vallar 2007"/><ref name="Carota, 2004"/>
# [[Finger agnosia]]: inability to distinguish the fingers on the hand<ref name="Vallar 2007"/><ref name="Carota, 2004"/>
# Left-right disorientation<ref name="Vallar 2007"/><ref name="Carota, 2004"/>

==Causes==
This disorder is often associated with [[brain]] lesions in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere including the [[angular gyrus| angular]] and [[supramarginal gyrus| supramarginal gyri]] near the [[temporal lobe| temporal]] and [[parietal lobe]] junction.  There is significant debate in the scientific literature as to whether Gerstmann Syndrome truly represents a unified, theoretically motivated syndrome.  Thus its diagnostic utility has been questioned by neurologists and neuropsychologists alike. The angular gyrus is generally involved in translating visual patterns of letter and words into meaningful information, such as is done while reading.

==In adults==
In adults, the syndrome may occur after a [[stroke]] or in association with damage to the [[parietal lobe]].<ref name="Carota, 2004"/>

In addition to exhibiting the above symptoms, many adults also experience [[aphasia]], which is a difficulty in expressing oneself when speaking, in understanding [[Speech communication|speech]], or in [[reading (activity)|reading]] and [[writing]].

==In children==
There are few reports of the syndrome, sometimes called developmental Gerstmann syndrome, in children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller CJ, Hynd GW |title=What ever happened to developmental Gerstmann's syndrome? Links to other pediatric, genetic, and neurodevelopmental syndromes |journal=J. Child Neurol. |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=282–9 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15163095 |doi= |url=}}</ref> The cause is not known. Most cases are identified when children reach school age, a time when they are challenged with writing and math exercises. Generally, children with the disorder exhibit poor handwriting and spelling skills, and difficulty with math functions, including adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. An inability to differentiate right from left and to discriminate among individual fingers may also be apparent. In addition to the four primary symptoms, many children also suffer from constructional apraxia, an inability to copy simple drawings. Frequently, there is also an impairment in reading. Children with a high level of intellectual functioning as well as those with brain damage may be affected with the disorder.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for Gerstmann syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Occupational and speech therapies may help diminish the dysgraphia and [[apraxia]]. In addition, [[calculator]]s and [[word processor]]s may help school children cope with the symptoms of the disorder. 

==Prognosis==
In adults, many of the symptoms diminish over time. Although it has been suggested that in children symptoms may diminish over time, it appears likely that most children probably do not overcome their deficits, but learn to adjust to them.
