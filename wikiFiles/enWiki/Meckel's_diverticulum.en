A '''Meckel's diverticulum''', a true [[congenital]] [[diverticulum]], is a slight bulge in the [[small intestine]] present at birth and a [[vestigial]] remnant of the [[omphalomesenteric duct]] (also called the vitelline duct or yolk stalk). It is the most common malformation of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] is present in approximately 2% of the population,<ref name="pmid17579156">{{cite journal |author=Elsayes KM, Menias CO, Harvin HJ, Francis IR |title=Imaging manifestations of Meckel's diverticulum |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=189 |issue=1 |pages=81–8 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17579156 |doi=10.2214/AJR.06.1257 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17579156}}</ref> with males more frequently experiencing symptoms. 

Meckel's diverticulum was first explained by [[Fabricius Hildanus]] in the sixteenth century and later named after [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]], who described the embryological origin of this type of diverticulum in 1809.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2050|Meckel's diverticulum}}</ref><ref>J. F. Meckel. Über die Divertikel am Darmkanal. Archiv für die Physiologie, Halle, 1809, 9: 421-453.</ref>  

==Presentation==
[[File:Meckel's Diverticulum AFIP.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Meckel's diverticulum surgical specimen]]
Meckel's diverticulum is located in the [[distal]] [[ileum]], usually within 60–100&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;feet) of the [[ileocecal valve]]. This ''blind segment'' or small pouch is about 3–6&nbsp;cm long and may have a greater [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] diameter than that of the [[ileum]].<ref name="Moore">Moore, K. L., Persaud, T. V. N., & Torchia, M. G. (2013). The developing human: Clinically oriented embryology (9th ed.). Philadelphia: Elsevier/Saunders.</ref> It antimesenterically runs and has its own blood supply. It is a remnant of the connection from the yolk-sac to the small intestine present during [[embryonic development]]. It is a ''true diverticulum'', consisting of all 3 layers of the [[bowel]] wall which are [[mucosa]], [[submucosa]] and [[muscularis propria]].<ref name="Mattei ">Mattei, P. (2011). Fundamentals of Pediatric Surgery. New York, NY: Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</ref>

As the vitelline duct is made up of [[pluripotent]] cell lining, Meckel’s diverticulum may harbor abnormal tissues, containing embryonic remnants of other tissue types. [[Jejunal]], [[duodenal]] mucosa or [[Brunner's glands|Brunner's tissue]] were each found in 2% of [[ectopic expression|ectopic]] cases. [[Heterotopia (medicine)|Heterotopic]] rests of [[gastric]] mucosa and [[pancreatic]] tissue are seen in 60% and 6% of cases respectively. Heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location.<ref name="Robbins">Robbins, S. L., Kumar, V., & Cotran, R. S. (2010). Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease (8th ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Saunders/Elsevier</ref> Inflammation of this Meckel's diverticulum may mimic appendicitis. Therefore during appendectomy, ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel's diverticulum, if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix. 

A memory aid is the rule of 2s: 
''2%'' (of the population).
''2'' feet (proximal to the [[ileocecal valve]]).
''2'' inches (in length).
''2'' types of common ectopic tissue (gastric and pancreatic).
''2'' years is the most common age at clinical presentation.
''2'':1 Male:Female ratio. 

However, the exact value for the above criteria range from 0.2-5 (for example, prevalence is probably 0.2-4%).

It can also be present as an indirect [[hernia]], typically on the right side, where it is known as a "''Hernia of [[Alexis Littré|Littré]]''". A case report of strangulated [[umbilical hernia]] with Meckel's diverticulum has also been published in the literature.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tiu A, Lee D |title=An unusual manifestation of Meckel's diverticulum: strangulated paraumbilical hernia |journal=N. Z. Med. J. |volume=119 |issue=1236 |pages=U2034 |year=2006 |pmid=16807577 }}</ref> Furthermore, it can be attached to the umbilical region by the vitelline ligament, with the possibility of vitelline cysts, or even a patent vitelline canal forming a vitelline [[fistula]] when the umbilical cord is cut. Torsions of intestine around the intestinal stalk may also occur, leading to obstruction, [[ischemia]], and [[necrosis]].

==Symptoms==
The majority of people afflicted with Meckel's diverticulum are [[asymptomatic]].<ref name="pmid19103339">{{cite journal |author=Thurley PD, Halliday KE, Somers JM, Al-Daraji WI, Ilyas M, Broderick NJ |title=Radiological features of Meckel's diverticulum and its complications |journal=Clin Radiol |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=109–18 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19103339 |doi=10.1016/j.crad.2008.07.012 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0009-9260(08)00332-2}}</ref> If symptoms do occur, they typically appear before the age of two. 

The most common presenting symptom is painless [[rectal bleeding]] such as [[melaena]]-like black offensive stools, followed by [[intestinal obstruction]], [[volvulus]] and [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]]. Occasionally, Meckel's diverticulitis may present with all the features of [[acute appendicitis]]. Also, severe pain in the [[epigastric region]] is experienced by the patient along with bloating in the epigastric and umbilical regions. At times, the symptoms are so painful that they may cause sleepless nights with acute pain felt in the foregut region, specifically in the [[epigastric]] and [[umbilical]] regions.

In most cases, bleeding occurs without warning and stops spontaneously.
The symptoms can be extremely painful, often mistaken as just stomach pain resulting from not eating or constipation.

==Diagnosis==
A [[technetium-99m]] ([[99mTc]]) [[pertechnetate]] scan, also called Meckel scan, is the investigation of choice to diagnose Meckel's diverticula in children. This scan detects [[gastric mucosa]]; since approximately 50% of symptomatic Meckel's diverticula have ectopic gastric or pancreatic cells contained within them,<ref name="pmid10706156">{{cite journal |author=Martin JP, Connor PD, Charles K |title=Meckel's diverticulum |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1037–42, 1044 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10706156 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000215/1037.html}}</ref> this is displayed as a spot on the scan distant from the stomach itself. In children, this scan is highly accurate and [[noninvasive]], with 95% specificity and 85% sensitivity;<ref name="Mattei "/> however, in adults the test is only 9% specific and 62% sensitive.<ref name="pmid21322060">{{cite journal|author=Uppal K, Tubbs RS, Matusz P, Shaffer K, Loukas M|title=Meckel's diverticulum: a review|journal=Clin Anat|volume=24|issue=4|pages=416–422|year=2011|month=May|pmid=21322060|doi=10.1002/ca.21094|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ca.21094/full}}</ref>

Patients with these misplaced gastric cells may experience [[peptic ulcer]]s as a consequence. Therefore, other tests such as [[colonoscopy]] and screenings for [[bleeding disorder]]s should be performed, and [[angiography]] can assist in determining the location and severity of bleeding. Colonoscopy might be helpful to rule out other sources of bleeding but it is not used as an identification tool. [[Angiography]] might identify brisk bleeding in patients with Meckel's diverticulum.<ref name="Mattei "/>

[[Ultrasonography]] could demonstrate omphaloenteric duct remnants or cysts. [[Computed tomography]] (CT scan) might be a useful tool to demonstrate a blind ended and inflamed structure in the mid-abdominal cavity, which is not an appendix.<ref name="Mattei "/>

In asymptomatic patients, Meckel's diverticulum is often diagnosed as an incidental finding during [[laparoscopy]] or [[laparotomy]].

==Treatment==
Treatment is surgical, potentially with a laparoscopic [[Segmental resection|resection]].<ref name="Mattei "/> In patients with bleeding, strangulation of bowel, bowel perforation or [[bowel obstruction]], treatment involves surgical resection of both the Meckel's diverticulum itself along with the adjacent bowel segment, and this procedure is called a "small bowel resection".<ref name="Mattei "/> In patients without any of the aforementioned complications, treatment involves surgical resection of the Meckel's diverticulum only, and this procedure is called a simple [[diverticulectomy]].<ref name="Mattei "/>

With regards to asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum, some recommend that a search for Meckel's diverticulum in every case of [[appendectomy]]/ laparotomy done for [[acute abdomen]] should be conducted, and if found, Meckel's diverticulectomy or resection should be performed to avoid secondary complications arising from it<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tauro LF, George C, Rao BS, Martis JJ, Menezes LT, Shenoy HD |title=Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum in adults: is diverticulectomy indicated? |journal=Saudi J Gastroenterol |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=198–202 |year=2010 |pmid=20616416 |pmc=3003224 |doi=10.4103/1319-3767.65199 |url=http://www.saudijgastro.com/article.asp?issn=1319-3767;year=2010;volume=16;issue=3;spage=198;epage=202;aulast=Tauro}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Meckel's Diverticulum occurs in about 2% of the population.<ref name="Robbins">Robbins, S. L., Kumar, V., & Cotran, R. S. (2010). Robbins and cotran pathologic basis of disease (8th ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Saunders/Elsevier.</ref> Prevalence in males is 3-5 times higher than in females.<ref name="Moore"/> Only 2% of cases are symptomatic, which usually presents among children at the age of 2.<ref name="Larsen">Schoenwolf, G. C., & Larsen, W. J. (2009). Larsen's human embryology (4th ed.). Philadelphia: Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier.</ref> 

Most cases of Meckel's diverticulum are diagnosed when complications manifest or incidentally in unrelated conditions such as laparotomy, laparoscopy or contrast study of the small intestine. Classic presentation in adults includes intestinal obstruction and inflammation of the diverticulum (diverticulitis). Painless rectal bleeding most commonly occurs in toddler. 

Inflammation in the ileal diverticulum has symptoms that mimic appendicitis, therefore its diagnosis is of clinical importance. Detailed knowledge of the pathophysiological properties is essential in dealing with the life threatening complications of Meckel's diverticulum.<ref name="Mattei "/>

mnemonic
* 2 inches long.
* 2 feet from end of ileum.
* 2-4 times more common in men.
* 2% occurrence in population.
* 2 types of tissues may be present.
* Only 2% of cases are symptomatic 
* usually presents among children at the age of 2

==Developmental background==
The omphalomesenteric duct (omphaloenteric duct, vitelline duct or yolk stalk) normally connects the embryonic midgut to the yolk sac ventrally, providing nutrients to the midgut during embryonic development. The vitelline duct narrows progressively and disappears between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> weeks gestation.

In Meckel’s diverticulum, the proximal part of vitelline duct fails to regress and involute, which remains as a remnant of variable length and location.<ref name="Drake">Drake, R. L., Vogl, W., Mitchell, A. W. M., Gray, H., & Gray, H. (2010). Gray's anatomy for students (2nd ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier.</ref> The solitary diverticulum lies on the antimesenteric border of the ileum (opposite to the mesenteric attachment) and extends into the umbilical cord of the embryo.<ref name="Larsen"/> The left and right vitelline arteries originate from the primitive [[dorsal aorta]], and travel with the omphaloenteric duct. The right becomes the superior mesenteric [[artery]] that supplies a terminal branch to the diverticulum, while the left involutes.<ref name="Mattei "/> Having its own blood supply, Meckel’s diverticulum is susceptible to obstruction or infection.

===Other possible types of omphaloenteric duct anomalies===

1. An ''omphalomesentric ligament/ fibrous band'' connecting the diverticulum to the umbilicus.<ref name="Moore"/>

[[File:Cck1.png|Omphalomesentric ligament/ fibrous band]]

2. An open ''omphalomesenteric fistula'' developing from the persisting intra-abdominal part of the ophaloenteric duct. 

[[File:Cck2.png|Omphalomesenteric fistula]]

3. An ''omphalomesentric cyst''/ enterocyst connecting the umbilicus with the abdominal wall due to part of the vaitelline duct persists within the abdominal wall.<ref name="Larsen"/>

[[File:Ocystck.png|Omphaloenteric cyst within the umbilicus and the fibrous remnant of the omphaloenteric duct]]

4. A ''persistent vitelline artery'' running along the fibrous cord (persistence of the omphaloenteric duct), which connects the ileum to the umbilicus . 

[[File:Cck3.png|Vitelline artery extends along the fibrous remnant of the omphaloenteric duct]]

5. Formation of a ''twisted (volvulus) ileal diverticulum'' and an umbilical sinus from the persistence of the omphaloenteric duct in the umbilicus.

[[File:MCck7b.jpg|left|Volvulus ileal diverticulum and umbilical sinus]]-->

==Complications==
The lifetime risk for a person with Meckel's diverticulum to develop certain [[complication (medicine)|complication]]s is about 4-6%. Gastrointestinal bleeding, [[peritonitis]] or [[intestinal obstruction]] may occur in 15-30% of symptomatic patients (Table 1). Only 6.4% of all complications requires surgical treatment; and untreated Meckel’s diverticulum has a [[mortality rate]] of 2.5-15%.<ref name="Larsen"/>

===Pathophysiology of Complications===

====Haemorrhage====

Bleeding of the diverticulum is most common in young children, especially in males who are less than 2 years of age.<ref name="Sagar">{{cite journal | author = Sagar J., Kumar V., Shah D. K. | year = 2006 | title = Meckel's diverticulum: A systematic review | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 99 | issue = 10| pages = 501–505 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.99.10.501 }}</ref> Symptoms may include bright red blood in stools ([[hematochezia]]), weakness, abdominal tenderness or pain, and even [[anaemia]] in some cases.<ref name="Karaman">{{cite journal | author = Karaman A., Karaman I., Cavusoaglu Y. H., Erdoagan D., Aslan M. K. | year = 2010 | title = Management of asymptomatic or incidental meckels diverticulum | url = | journal = Indian Pediatrics | volume = 47 | issue = 12| pages = 1055–1057 }}</ref> 

'''Haemorrhage may be caused by:'''

* Ectopic gastric or pancreatic mucosa:
# Where diverticulum contains embryonic remnants of mucosa of other tissue types.
# Secretion of [[gastric acid]] or alkaline [[pancreatic juice]] from the ectopic mucosa leads to ulceration in the adjacent ileal mucosa i.e. peptic or pancreatic ulcer.<ref name="Hig">{{cite journal | author = Higaki S., Saito Y., Akazawa A., Okamoto T., Hirano A., Takeo Y., Okita K. | year = 2001 | title = Bleeding ''Meckel's diverticulum'' in an adult | url = | journal = Hepato-Gastroenterology | volume = 48 | issue = 42| pages = 1628–1630 }}</ref>
# Pain, bleeding or perforation of the bowel at the diverticulum may result.
# Mechanical stimulation may also cause erosion and ulceration.

* Gastrointestinal bleeding may be self-limiting but chronic bleeding may lead to [[iron deficiency anaemia]].<ref name="A-O ">{{cite journal | author = Al-Onaizi I., Al-Awadi F., Al-Dawood A. L. | year = 2002 | title = Iron deficiency anaemia: An unusual complication of ''Meckel's diverticulum'' | url = | journal = Medical Principles and Practice : International Journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 214–217 }}</ref>

'''The appearance of stools may indicate the nature of the haemorrhage:''' 

* ''Tarry stools'': Alteration of blood produced by slow bowel transit due to minor bleeding in upper gastrointestinal tract
* ''Bright red blood stools'': Brisk haemorrhage
* ''Stools with blood streak'': [[Anal fissure]]
* ''"Currant jelly" stools'': [[Ischaemia]] of the intestine leads to copious mucus production and may indicate that one part of the bowel [[Invagination|invaginates]] into another [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]].

====Diverticulitis====

Inflammation of the diverticulum can mimic symptoms of appendicitis i.e. periumbilical tenderness and intermittent crampy abdominal pain. Perforation of the inflamed diverticulum can result in peritonitis. Diverticulitis can also cause [[adhesion]]s, leading to intestinal obstruction.<ref name="Sharma">{{cite journal | author = Sharma R., Jain V. | year = 2008 | title = Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum | url = | journal = World J Emerg Surg | volume = 3 | issue = 27| pages = 1–8 }}</ref> 

'''Diverticulitis may result from:'''

* Association with the mesodiverticular band attaching to the diverticulum tip where torsion has occurred, causing inflammation and ischaemia.<ref name="Tan">Tan, Y. M., & Zheng, Z. X. (2005). Recurrent torsion of a giant Meckel's diverticulum. Digestive Diseases and Sciences, 50(7), 1285-1287.</ref>
* Peptic ulceration resulting from ectopic gastric mucosa of the diverticulum
* Following perforation by trauma or ingested foreign material e.g. stalk of vegetable, seeds or fish/chicken bone that become lodged in Meckel's diverticulum.<ref name="Drake"/>
* Luminal obstruction due to [[tumor]]s, [[enterolith]], foreign body, causing stasis or bacterial infection<ref name="Mattei "/>..
* Association with acute appendicitis

====Intestinal obstruction====

'''Symptoms:''' Vomiting, abdominal pain and severe or complete [[constipation]].<ref name="Pariza">Pariza, G., Mavrodin, C. I., & Ciurea, M. (2009). Complicated meckel's diverticulum in adult pathology. [Diverticulul Meckel complicat in patologia adultului] Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990), 104(6), 745-748.</ref>

* The vitelline vessels remnant that connects the diverticulum to the umbilicus may form a fibrous or twisting band ([[volvulus]]), trapping the small intestine and causing obstruction. Localised periumbilical pain may be experienced in the right lower quadrant (like appendicitis).<ref name="Mattei "/>

* "Incarceration": when a Meckel’s diverticulum is constricted in an [[inguinal hernia]], forming a [[Littré hernia]] that obstructs the intestine.<ref name="Martin">Martin, E. (2010). Concise colour medical dictionary (5th ed.) Oxford University Press.</ref>

* Chronic diverticulitis causing stricture

* Strangulation of the diverticulum in the [[obturator foramen]].

* Tumors e.g. [[carcinoma]]: direct spread of an [[adenocarcinoma]] arising in the diverticulum may lead to obstruction
 
* [[Lithiasis]], stones that are formed in Meckel's diverticulum can:
# Extrude into the terminal ileum, leading to obstruction
# Induce local inflammation and intussusception.<ref name="Mattei "/>

* The diverticulum itself or tumour within it may cause intussusception. For example, from the ileum to the colon, causing obstruction. Symptoms of this include "currant jelly" stools and a palpable lump in the lower abdomen.<ref name="Johnston">{{cite journal | author = Johnston A. O., Moore T. | year = 1976 | title = Complications of ''Meckel's diverticulum'' | url = | journal = British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. | volume = 63 | issue = 6| pages = 453–454 }}</ref> This occurs when the diverticulum inverts into the lumen of the ileum, due to either:

# An ''active'' [[Peristalsis|peristaltic]] mechanism of the diverticulum that attempts to remove irritating factors
# A ''passive'' process such as the transit of food<ref name="Karaman"/>

====Umbilical anomalies====

Anomalies between the diverticulum and umbilicus may include the presence of fibrous cord, [[cyst]], fistula or sinus, leading to:<ref name="Sharma"/> 

* Infection or excoriation of periumbilical skin, resulting in a discharging sinus
* Recurrent infection and healing of sinus
* Abscess formation in the abdominal wall
* Fibrous cord increases the risk of volvulus formation and internal herniation

====Neoplasm====

Tumors in Meckel's diverticulum may cause bleeding, acute abdominal pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation or intussusception.<ref name="Sharma">{{cite journal | author = Sharma R., Jain V. | year = 2008 | title = Emergency surgery for meckel's diverticulum | url = | journal = World J Emerg Surg | volume = 3 | issue = 27| pages = 1–8 }}</ref> 

*'''Benign tumors''': 
# [[Leiomyoma]]
# [[Lipoma]]
# Vascular and [[neuromuscular]] [[hamartoma]]

*'''[[Malignant tumors]]''':
# [[Carcinoid]]s: most common,44% 
# [[Mesenchymal]] tumors: [[Leiomyosarcoma]] ,peripheral nerve sheath and gastrointestinal [[stromal tumor]]s, 35%
# [[Adenocarcinoma]], 16%
# [[Desmoplastic]] small round cell tumor

====Other complications====

* A diverticulum inside a Meckel’s diverticulum (Daughter diverticula)
* Stones and [[phytobezoar]] (a [[bezoar]] of vegetable fibers) in Meckel’s diverticulum
* Vesicodiverticular fistula<ref name="Johnston"/>

==Notable patients==
Major League Baseball player [[Chan Ho Park]], then a [[pitcher]] with the [[San Diego Padres]] (currently with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]), suffered multiple episodes during the 2006 season in which mysterious internal bleeding caused him to lose a significant fraction of his blood volume. He was finally diagnosed with Meckel's diverticulum, which was surgically removed August 23, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2559300 |publisher=ESPN.com | title=Padres P Park undergoes surgery, will miss four weeks |accessdate=2007-07-25 |format= |work=}}</ref>
