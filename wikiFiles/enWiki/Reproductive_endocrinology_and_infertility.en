'''Reproductive endocrinology and infertility''' (REI) is a surgical [[subspecialty]] of [[obstetrics and gynecology]] that trains physicians in [[reproductive medicine]] addressing [[Hormone|hormonal]] functioning as it pertains to [[reproduction]] as well as the issue of [[infertility]]. While most REI specialists primarily focus on the treatment of [[infertility]], reproductive endocrinologists are trained to also evaluate and treat hormonal dysfunctions in females and males outside of infertility. Reproductive endocrinologists have specialty training in [[obstetrics and gynecology]] (ob-gyn) before they undergo sub-specialty training (fellowship) in REI.

[[Reproductive surgery]] is a related specialty, where a physician in ob-gyn or [[urology]] further specializes to operate on anatomical disorders that affect [[fertility]].<ref>[http://www.inciid.org/article.php?cat=glossary&id=72 Glossary] The InterNational Council on Infertility Information Dissemination (INCIID).

==Certification==
In a number of countries, the pathway to become a sub-specialist in REI is regulated. Thus, in the [[United States]], for instance, the [[American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] (ACOG) sets the standards for sub-specialtists to become certified. After four years of training in Obstetrics and Gynecology, a three-year approved [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] needs to be successfully completed. Then, to become board certified in reproductive endocrinology and infertility, one must first complete [[board certification]] in [[obstetrics and gynecology]] (written and oral exams), and then certify in reproductive endocrinology and infertility (written, oral, and [[thesis]] exams).

==Societies==
Reproductive endocrinologists Certified by ABOG often belong to a specific medical society named ''Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility'' (SREI). As a condition of full membership, medical practitioners must be ABOG-certified in the reproductive endocrinology and infertility subspecialty.<ref name="SREI">[http://www.socrei.org/uploadedFiles/Affiliates/SOCREI/Publications/SREI_brochure.pdf Society for Reproductive Endocrinology Brochure], Retrieved on Jan. 21, 2011.</ref>

==Journals==

*''Fertility and Sterility'' is a monthly journal from the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]]

Also, many [[Obstetrics_and_gynaecology#Academic_journals|academic journals in obstetrics and gynaecology]] dedicate many articles to reproductive endocrinology and infertility.

==Patient's needs==
According to a systematic review, fertility patients want to be treated like human beings with a need for medical skills, respect, coordination, accessibility, information, comfort, support, partner involvement and a good attitude of and relationship with fertility clinic staff.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dancet EA, Nelen WL, Sermeus W, De Leeuw L, Kremer JA, D'Hooghe TM |title=The patients' perspective on fertility care: a systematic review |journal=Hum Reprod Update |volume= 16|issue= 5|pages= 467–487|year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20223789 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmq004 |url=}}</ref>
