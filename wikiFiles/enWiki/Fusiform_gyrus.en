The '''fusiform gyrus''' is part of the [[temporal lobe]] and [[occipital lobe]] in [[Brodmann area]] 37. It is also known as the ''(discontinuous) occipitotemporal gyrus''.<ref>Nature Neuroscience, vol7, 2004</ref>  The fusiform [[gyrus]] is located between the [[occipitotemporal gyrus]] and the [[parahippocampal gyrus]].<ref>[http://130.241.71.9/encephali/expo.php?selection=1 nervsystemet.se - Hjärnatlas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The lateral and medial portions are separated by the shallow mid fusiform [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulcus]].<ref>Weiner & Grill-Spector, Sparsely-distributed organization of face and limb activations in human ventral temporal cortex.Neuroimage. 2010 Oct 1;52(4):1559-73.

==Function==
There is still some dispute over the functionalities of this area, but there is relative consensus on the following:
# processing of color information
# face and body recognition (see [[Fusiform face area]])
# word recognition (see [[Visual word form area]])
# within-category identification

Some researchers think that the fusiform gyrus may be related to the disorder known as [[prosopagnosia]], or face blindness. Research has also shown that the fusiform face area, the area within the fusiform gyrus, is heavily involved in face perception but only to any generic within-category identification that is shown to be one of the functions of the fusiform gyrus.<ref>McCarthy, G et al. Face-specific processing in the fuman fusform gyrus.''J. Cognitive Neuroscicence. 9, 605-610(1997).</ref> Abnormalities of the fusiform gyrus have also been linked to [[Williams syndrome]].<ref>A. L. Reiss, et al.

</ref>  However, individuals with [[autism]] show little to no activation in the fusiform gyrus in response to seeing a human face <ref>{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Rita|title=The Human Brain Book|pages=241}}</ref> 

Increased neurophysiological activity in the fusiform face area may produce hallucinations of faces, whether realistic or cartoonesque, as seen in [[Charles Bonnet syndrome]], [[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic hallucinations]], [[Peduncular hallucinosis|peduncular hallucinations]], or drug-induced hallucinations.<ref>Jan Dirk Blom. ''A Dictionary of Hallucinations''. Springer, 2010, p. 187. ISBN 978-1-4419-1222-0</ref>

Recent research has seen activation of the fusiform gyrus during subjective grapheme-color perception in people with [[synaesthesia]].<ref>[http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/05/29/imaging-of-connectivity-in-the-synaesthetic-brain/ Imaging of connectivity in the synaesthetic brain « Neurophilosophy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After further research by scientists at [[MIT]], it was concluded that both the left and right fusiform gyrus played different roles from one another, but were subsequently interlinked. The left fusiform gyrus plays the role of recognizing "face-like" features in objects that may or may not be actual faces. Whereas the right fusiform gyrus plays the role in determining whether or not the recognized "face-like" feature is, in fact, an actual face.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/face-perception-0109.html Trafton, A. "How does our brain know what is a face and what’s not?" MIT News]</ref>
