'''Metenolone enanthate''' (or '''methenolone enanthate''') is a [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) based [[anabolic steroid]]. It is an [[ester]] derivative of [[methenolone]] sold commonly under the brand names '''Primobolan''' ([[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] form) or '''Primobolan Depot''' ([[Injection (medicine)|injectable]]). When it interacts with the [[aromatase]] [[enzyme]] it does not form any [[estrogen]]s.  It is used by people who are very susceptible to [[estrogenic]] side effects, having lower [[estrogenic]] properties than [[nandrolone]]. Methenolone, in form of [[enanthate]] and [[acetate]], is available as an [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] or as an oral respectively. The injection is naturally regarded as having a higher [[bioavailability]]. It is an [[heptanoic acid|enanthate]] ester which is quite long-acting. Because it by-passes [[hepatic]] breakdown on the first pass, it also has a higher survival rate. The tablets are in a short-lived [[acetate]] form. Methenolone is not 17-alpha-alkylated, but 1-methylated for oral [[bioavailability]]. This reduces the stress on the [[liver]], but also the availability. It is considered one of the ''safer'' steroids, meaning it has few side effects. Methenolone has no [[estrogenic]] side effects, and its effects on [[cholesterol]] levels are minimal. In doses of 200 [[milligram|mg]] per week or less ([[intramuscular]]) [[blood pressure]] is rarely altered. It is possibly one of the ''safer'' [[anabolic steroids]] for females due to very low [[virilization]] effects in short-term usage.  Methenolone is also not overly suppressive of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]], although how suppressive is debatable. For this reason, many [[bodybuilders]] use it in between [[steroid cycle]]s during their "off-time" to help maintain their gains and [[physical strength|strength]]. The long term safety of such a practice is possibly dangerous and can lead to permanent suppression of the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis|HPTA]].<ref>

In February of 2009, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' reported that [[Alex Rodriguez]] tested positive for two [[anabolic steroids]], [[testosterone]] and metenolone enanthate, while playing for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in 2003. He claims to have purchased them over the counter, in the [[Dominican Republic]].
