This article lists '''medical eponyms''' which have been associated with [[Nazi human experimentation]] or Nazi politics. While normally [[eponyms]] used in medicine serve to honor the memory of the physician or researcher who first documented a disease or pioneered a procedure, the propriety of such names resulting from unethical research practices is controversial. In some cases terms closely related to doctors in the Nazi era have fallen out of favor or there are active lobbying efforts to remove the original name from use. In other cases their use in the medical literature is sometimes presented with a caveat or footnote. 

The declining use of the Nazi-era eponyms has itself been tracked in the literature.<ref name=jaad />  Since 2007, the ''[[Israel Medical Association Journal]]''<ref name=imaj>{{cite journal|title=Eponyms and the Nazi Era: Time to Remember and Time For Change|last=Strous|first=Rael D.|coauthor=Morris C. Edelman|work=[[Israel Medical Association Journal]]|year=2007|month=March|volume=9|issue=3|pages=207–214|url=http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar07mar-24.pdf|accessdate=2010-10-28}}</ref> and ''European Neurology''<ref name=en /> have each published articles cataloging eponyms honoring Nazis and their collaborators.  While the most direct Nazi experimenters (such as [[Josef Mengele]]) were never honored, others who were members of the Nazi party or whose research relied upon the Nazi program—such as conducting research on the remains of Nazi execution victims—have been honored.  

Some physicians have used the Nazi associations as an argument to discontinue the use of eponyms in medical naming conventions altogether,<ref name=bmj>{{cite journal|work=[[British Medical Journal]]|doi=10.1136/bmj.39308.342639.AD|title=Should Eponyms be Abandoned?

| "The facts we have uncovered do not prove Dr Friedrich Wegener guilty of war crimes. However, the evidence suggests that Dr Wegener was, at least at some point of his career, a follower of the Nazi regime. Dr Wegener’s mentor, Martin Staemmler, was an ardent supporter of the racial hygiene. In addition, our data indicate that Dr Wegener was wanted by Polish authorities and that his files were forwarded to the United Nations War Crimes Commission. Finally, Dr Wegener worked in close proximity to the genocide machinery in Lodz."<ref name=rheum>{{cite journal|title=Wegener’s Granulomatosis—Probing the Untold Past of the Man Behind the Eponym|doi=10.1093/rheumatology/kel258|last=Woywodt|first=A.|coauthor=E.
