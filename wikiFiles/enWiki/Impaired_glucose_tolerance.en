'''Impaired glucose tolerance''' ('''IGT''') is a [[Prediabetes|pre-diabetic]] state of [[hyperglycemia]] that is associated with [[insulin resistance]] and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology. IGT may precede [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]] by many years.  IGT is also a risk factor for mortality.<ref name="pmid17576864">{{cite journal |author=Barr EL, Zimmet PZ, Welborn TA, ''et al.'' |title=Risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in individuals with diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance: the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab) |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=151–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17576864 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.685628}}</ref>

* two-hour glucose levels of 140 to 199&nbsp;mg per dL (7.8 to 11.0&nbsp;mmol) on the 75-g [[oral glucose tolerance test]]. A patient is said to be under the condition of IGT when he/she has an intermediately raised [[glucose]] level after 2 hours, but less than would qualify for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The [[fasting]] glucose may be either normal or mildly elevated.

From 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States have impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose.<ref name="Shobha">{{cite journal | author=Shobha S.

Although some drugs can delay the onset of diabetes, lifestyle modifications play a greater role in the prevention of diabetes.<ref name="Shobha"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Raina Elley C, Kenealy T |title=Lifestyle interventions reduced the long-term risk of diabetes in adults with impaired glucose tolerance |journal=Evid Based Med |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=173 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19043031 |doi=10.1136/ebm.13.6.173 |url=}}</ref> Patients identified as having an IGT should exercise regularly, lose 5 to 7 percent of body weight, and limit intake of (at least) sugar and highly processed [[carbohydrates]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
America is known to have a higher percentage of diabetes due to the average  intake of sugar and high carbohydrate food consumed by the general population.
