The '''brachialis''' ('''brachialis anticus''') is a [[muscle]] in the upper [[arm]] that flexes the [[elbow|elbow joint]]. It lies deeper than the [[biceps brachii]], and is a synergist that assists the [[biceps brachii]] in flexing at the elbow. It makes up part of the floor of the region known as the [[cubital fossa]].

==Origin and insertion==
The brachialis originates from the lower half of the front of the [[humerus]], near the insertion of the [[deltoid muscle]], which it embraces by two angular processes. Its origin extends below to within 2.5 cm of the margin of the articular surface of the humerus at the elbow joint. It also arises from the [[intermuscular septa]] of the arm, but more extensively from the medial than the lateral; it is separated from the lateral below by the [[brachioradialis]] and [[extensor carpi radialis longus]] muscles. 

Its fibers converge to a thick tendon, which is inserted into the tuberosity of the [[ulna]] and the rough depression on the anterior surface of the [[coronoid process of the ulna]].

==Innervation==
The brachialis muscle is innervated by the [[musculocutaneous nerve]], which runs on its superficial surface, between it and the [[biceps brachii]].  Part of it is also innervated by the [[radial nerve]] ([[proprioceptive]] branch) which allows it to be split during certain approaches to the arm. The divide between the two innervations is at the insertion of the deltoid.

==Actions==
Unlike the biceps, the brachialis does not insert on the radius, and therefore cannot participate in [[pronation]] and [[supination]] of the forearm. It flexes the elbow joint. Because of its broad origin and it having only one action, it can be considered the strongest flexor of the elbow.

==Variations==
The muscle is occasionally doubled; additional nip to the [[supinator]], [[pronator teres]], [[biceps brachii]], [[lacertus fibrosus]], or [[Radius (bone)|radius]] are more rarely found.
