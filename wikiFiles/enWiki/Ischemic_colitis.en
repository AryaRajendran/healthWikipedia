'''Ischemic colitis''' (ischaemic colitis in British English) is a medical condition in which inflammation and injury of the large intestine result from inadequate blood supply. Although uncommon in the general population, ischemic colitis occurs with greater frequency in the elderly, and is the most common form of bowel [[ischemia]].<ref name="pmid15043513">{{cite journal | author = Higgins P, Davis K, Laine L | title = Systematic review: the epidemiology of ischaemic colitis. | journal = Aliment Pharmacol Ther | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 729–38 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15043513 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.01903.x}}</ref><ref name="pmid10784596">{{cite journal |author=Brandt LJ, Boley SJ |title=AGA technical review on intestinal ischemia.

In most cases, no specific cause can be identified.<ref name="textp2332"/>

Ischemic colitis is usually suspected on the basis of the clinical setting, [[physical examination]], and laboratory test results; the diagnosis can be confirmed via [[endoscopy]] or by using sigmoid or endoscopic placement of a visible light spectroscopic catheter (see Diagnosis). Ischemic colitis can span a wide spectrum of severity; most patients are treated supportively and recover fully, while a minority with very severe ischemia may develop [[sepsis]] and become critically ill.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Medina C, Vilaseca J, Videla S, Fabra R, Armengol-Miro J, Malagelada J | title = Outcome of patients with ischemic colitis: review of fifty-three cases. | journal = Dis Colon Rectum | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–4 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15043287 | doi = 10.1007/s10350-003-0033-6}}</ref>

Patients with mild to moderate ischemic colitis are usually treated with IV fluids, [[analgesia]], and bowel rest (that is, no food or water by mouth) until the symptoms resolve. Those with severe ischemia who develop complications such as sepsis, intestinal [[gangrene]], or [[bowel perforation]] may require more aggressive interventions such as [[surgery]] and [[intensive care]]. Most patients make a full recovery; occasionally, after severe ischemia, patients may develop long-term complications such as a [[Stenosis|stricture]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Simi M, Pietroletti R, Navarra L, Leardi S | title = Bowel stricture due to ischemic colitis: report of three cases requiring surgEsophageal dilatationery. | journal = Hepatogastroenterology | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–81 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7590579}}</ref> or chronic [[colitis]].<ref name="Cappell M 1998 827–60, vi">{{cite journal | author = Cappell M | title = Intestinal (mesenteric) vasculopathy.

==Signs and symptoms==
Three progressive phases of ischemic colitis have been described:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boley SJ, Brandt LJ, Veith FJ |title=Ischemic disorders of the intestines |journal=Curr Probl Surg |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=1–85 |year=1978 |month=April |pmid=365467 |doi=10.1016/S0011-3840(78)80018-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Hunter G, Guernsey J | title = Mesenteric ischemia. | journal = Med Clin North Am | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1091–115 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3045452}}</ref>

*A ''hyperactive'' phase occurs first, in which the primary symptoms are severe abdominal pain and the passage of bloody stools. Many patients get better and do not progress beyond this phase.

*A ''paralytic'' phase can follow if ischemia continues; in this phase, the abdominal pain becomes more widespread, the belly becomes more tender to the touch, and bowel [[motility]] decreases, resulting in abdominal bloating, no further bloody stools, and absent bowel sounds on exam.

*Finally, a ''shock'' phase can develop as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining. This can result in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and [[metabolic acidosis]] with [[dehydration]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]], and confusion. Patients who progress to this phase are often critically ill and require [[intensive care]].

Symptoms of ischemic colitis vary depending on the severity of the ischemia. The most common early signs of ischemic colitis include [[abdominal pain]](often left-sided), with mild to moderate amounts of [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding|rectal bleeding]].<ref name="Greenwald">{{cite journal | author = Greenwald D, Brandt L, Reinus J | title = Ischemic bowel disease in the elderly. | journal = Gastroenterol Clin North Am | volume = 30 | issue = 2 |pages = 445–73 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11432300 | doi = 10.1016/S0889-8553(05)70190-4}}</ref> The sensitivity of findings among 73 patients were:<ref name="pmid17071206">{{cite journal |author=Huguier M, Barrier A, Boelle PY, Houry S, Lacaine F |title=Ischemic colitis |journal=Am.

Physical examination<ref name="pmid17071206"/>
* abdominal pain (77%)

==Causes==
Ischemic colitis is often classified according to the underlying cause. ''Non-occlusive'' ischemia develops because of low blood pressure or constriction of the vessels feeding the colon; ''occlusive'' ischemia indicates that a [[blood clot]] or other blockage has cut off blood flow to the colon.

===Non-occlusive ischemia===
In hemodynamic unstable patients (i.e. shock) the mesenteric perfusion may be compromised. This condition is commonly asymptomatic, and usually only apparent through a systemic inflammatory response.

===Occlusive ischemia===
Mostly the result of a thromboembolism. Commonly the embolism is caused by [[atrial fibrillation]], valvular disease, [[myocardial infarction]], or [[cardiomyopathy]].

In addition, ischemic colitis is a well-recognized complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, when the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery is covered by the aortic graft.  Thus, patients without adequate collateralization are at risk for ischemia of the descending and sigmoid colon.  Bloody diarrhea and leukocytosis in the postoperative period are essentially diagnostic of ischemic colitis.

==Pathophysiology==
===Colonic blood supply===
[[Image:Colonic blood supply.svg|Colonic blood supply. Pink - supply from [[superior mesenteric artery]] (SMA) and its branches: middle colic, right colic, ileocolic arteries. Blue - supply from [[inferior mesenteric artery]] (IMA) and its branches: left colic, sigmoid, superior rectal artery. 7 is for so-called Cannon-Böhm point (the border between the areas of SMA and IMA supplies), which lies at the splenic flexure|thumb]]
The colon receives blood from both the [[superior mesenteric artery|superior]] and [[inferior mesenteric artery|inferior mesenteric arteries]]. The blood supply from these two major arteries overlap, with abundant collateral circulation. However, there are weak points, or "watershed" areas, at the borders of the territory supplied by each of these arteries, such as the splenic flexure and the transverse portion of the colon. These watershed areas are most vulnerable to ischemia when blood flow decreases, as they have the fewest vascular collaterals.

The [[rectum]] receives blood from both the inferior mesenteric artery and the [[internal iliac artery]]; the rectum is rarely involved by colonic ischemia due to this dual blood supply.

===Development of ischemia===
Under ordinary conditions, the colon receives between 10% and 35% of the total cardiac output.<ref name="uptodate">UpToDate, ''Colonic ischemia'', accessed 2 September 2006.</ref> If blood flow to the colon drops by more than about 50%, ischemia will develop. The arteries feeding the colon are very sensitive to vasoconstrictors; presumably this is an evolutionary adaptation to shunt blood away from the bowel and to the [[heart]] and [[brain]] in times of stress.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rosenblum J, Boyle C, Schwartz L | title = The mesenteric circulation. Anatomy and physiology. | journal = Surg Clin North Am | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 289–306 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9146713 | doi = 10.1016/S0039-6109(05)70549-1}}</ref> As a result, during periods of [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], the arteries feeding the colon clamp down vigorously; a similar process can result from vasoconstricting drugs such as [[ergotamine]], [[cocaine]], or [[vasopressor]]s. This vasoconstriction can result in non-occlusive ischemic colitis.

===Pathologic findings===
A range of pathologic findings are seen in ischemic colitis, corresponding to the spectrum of clinical severity. In its mildest form, mucosal and submucosal [[hemorrhage]] and [[edema]] are seen, possibly with mild [[necrosis]] or [[Peptic ulcer|ulceration]].<ref name="textp2332"/> With more severe ischemia, a pathologic picture resembling [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (i.e. chronic ulcerations, crypt [[abscess]]es and pseudopolyps) may be seen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brandt L, Boley S, Goldberg L, Mitsudo S, Berman A |title=Colitis in the elderly. A reappraisal |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=239–45 |year=1981 |month=September |pmid=7315820 }}</ref> In the most severe cases, transmural infarction with resulting perforation may be seen; after recovery, the muscularis propria may be replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in a stricture.<ref name="textp2332"/> Following restoration of normal blood flow, [[reperfusion injury]] may also contribute to the damage to the colon.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Granger D, Rutili G, McCord J | title = Superoxide radicals in feline intestinal ischemia. | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–9 | year = 1981 | pmid = 6263743}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

Ischemic colitis must be differentiated from the many other causes of [[abdominal pain]] and [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding|rectal bleeding]] (for example, [[infection]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[diverticulosis]], or [[colon cancer]]). It is also important to differentiate ischemic colitis, which often resolves on its own, from the more immediately life-threatening condition of acute mesenteric ischemia of the [[small bowel]].

There are devices which test the sufficiency of oxygen delivery to the colon. The first device approved by the U.S. FDA in 2004 uses visible light spectroscopy to analyze capillary oxygen levels. Use during Aortic Aneurysm repair detected when colon oxygen levels fell below sustainable levels, allowing real-time repair. In several studies, Specificity has been 90% or higher for acute colonic ischemia, and 83% for chronic mesenteric ischemia, with a sensitivity of 71%-92%. This device must be placed using endoscopy, however.,,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee ES, Bass A, Arko FR, et al. | title = Intraoperative colon mucosal oxygen saturation during aortic surgery. | volume = 136 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–24 | year = 2006| pmid = 16978651 | doi = 10.1016/j.jss.2006.05.014 | journal = The Journal of surgical research}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Friedland S, Benaron D, Coogan S, et al. | title = Diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia by visible light spectroscopy during endoscopy. | journal = Gastrointest Endosc | volume = 65| issue = 2 | pages = 294–300 | year = 2007| pmid = 17137857 | doi = 10.1016/j.gie.2006.05.007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee ES, Pevec WC, Link DP, et al. | title = Use of T-Stat to predict colonic ischemia during and after endovascular aneurysm repair. | journal = J Vasc Surg | volume = 47| issue = 3 | pages = 632–634 | year = 2008| pmid = 18295116 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2007.09.037 | pmc = 2707776}}</ref>

===Diagnostic tests===
There is a recent optical test, but it requires endoscopy (see Diagnosis). There are no specific blood tests for ischemic colitis. The sensitivity of tests among 73 patients were:<ref name="pmid17071206"/>
* The white blood cell count was more than 15,000/mm3 in 20 patients (27%)
* The serum bicarbonate level was less than 24&nbsp;mmol/L in 26 patients (36%)

Plain [[X-ray]]s are often normal or show non-specific findings.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Smerud M, Johnson C, Stephens D | title = Diagnosis of bowel infarction: a comparison of plain films and CT scans in 23 cases. | journal = AJR Am J Roentgenol | volume = 154 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–103 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2104734}}</ref> In a series of 73 patients, plain abdominal radiography (56%) showing colic distension in 53% or a pneumoperitoneum in 3%.<ref name="pmid17071206"/>

[[CT scan]]s are often used in the evaluation of abdominal pain and rectal bleeding, and may suggest the diagnosis of ischemic colitis, pick up complications, or suggest an alternate diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Alpern M, Glazer G, Francis I | title = Ischemic or infarcted bowel: CT findings. | journal = Radiology | volume = 166 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = 149–52 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3336673}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Balthazar E, Yen B, Gordon R | title = Ischemic colitis: CT evaluation of 54 cases. | journal = Radiology | volume = 211 | issue = 2 | pages = 381–8 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10228517}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Taourel P, Deneuville M, Pradel J, Régent D, Bruel J | title = Acute mesenteric ischemia: diagnosis with contrast-enhanced CT. | journal = Radiology | volume = 199 | issue = 3 | pages = 632–6 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8637978 | doi=}}</ref>

[[Endoscopy|Endoscopic]] evaluation, via [[colonoscopy]] or flexible [[sigmoidoscopy]], is the procedure of choice if the diagnosis remains unclear. Ischemic colitis has a distinctive endoscopic appearance; endoscopy can also facilitate alternate diagnoses such as [[infection]] or [[inflammatory bowel disease]]. [[biopsy|Biopsies]] can be taken via endoscopy to provide more information. Visible light spectroscopy, performed using catheters placed through the 5&nbsp;mm channel of the endoscope, is diagnostic (see Diagnosis).

==Treatment==

Except in the most severe cases, ischemic colitis is treated with supportive care. [[Intravenous therapy|IV fluids]] are given to treat [[dehydration]], and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning nothing to eat or drink) until the symptoms resolve. If possible, cardiac function and oxygenation should be optimized to improve oxygen delivery to the ischemic bowel. A [[nasogastric tube]] may be inserted if an [[ileus]] is present.

[[Antibiotic]]s are sometimes given in moderate to severe cases; the data supporting this practice date to the 1950s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Path EJ, McClure JN |title=Intestinal obstruction; the protective action of sulfasuxidine and sulfathalidine to the ileum following vascular damage |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=131 |issue=2 |pages=159–70, illust |year=1950 |month=February |pmid=15402790 |pmc=1616406 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0003-4932&volume=131&issue=2&spage=159}}</ref> although there is more recent animal data suggesting that antibiotics may increase survival and prevent [[bacteria]] from crossing the damaged lining of the colon into the bloodstream.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Plonka A, Schentag J, Messinger S, Adelman M, Francis K, Williams J | title = Effects of enteral and intravenous antimicrobial treatment on survival following intestinal ischemia in rats. | journal = J Surg Res | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–20 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2921861 | doi = 10.1016/0022-4804(89)90059-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Bennion R, Wilson S, Williams R | title = Early portal anaerobic bacteremia in mesenteric ischemia. | journal = Arch Surg | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–5 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6696611}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Redan J, Rush B, Lysz T, Smith S, Machiedo G | title = Organ distribution of gut-derived bacteria caused by bowel manipulation or ischemia. | journal = Am J Surg | volume = 159 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–9; discussion 89–90 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2403765 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9610(05)80611-7}}</ref> The use of [[prophylactic]] antibiotics in ischemic colitis has not been prospectively evaluated in [[human]]s, but many authorities recommend their use based on the animal data.<ref>{{cite book |last=Feldman |title=Sleisenger & Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease |publisher=Saunders |year=2002  |page=2334 |edition=7th}}</ref>

Patients being treated supportively are carefully monitored. If they develop worsening symptoms and signs such as [[leukocytosis|high white blood cell count]], [[fever]], worsened abdominal pain, or increased bleeding, then they may require [[surgery|surgical intervention]]; this usually consists of [[laparotomy]] and [[bowel resection]].
==Epidemiology==
The exact incidence of ischemic colitis is difficult to estimate, as many patients with mild ischemia may not seek medical attention. Ischemic colitis is responsible for about 1 in 2000 hospital admissions, and is seen on about 1 in 100 endoscopies.<ref name="textp2332">Feldman: Sleisenger & Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease, 7th ed., 2002 Saunders, p. 2332.</ref> Men and women are affected equally; ischemic colitis is a disease of the elderly, with more than 90% of cases occurring in people over the age of 60.<ref name="textp2332"/>

==Prognosis==

Most patients with ischemic colitis recover fully, although the prognosis depends on the severity of the ischemia. Patients with pre-existing [[peripheral vascular disease]] or ischemia of the ascending (right) colon may be at increased risk for complications or death.

Non-gangrenous ischemic colitis, which comprises the vast majority of cases, is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 6%.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Longo W, Ballantyne G, Gusberg R | title = Ischemic colitis: patterns and prognosis. | journal = Dis Colon Rectum | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 726–30 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1643995 | doi = 10.1007/BF02050319}}</ref> However, the minority of patients who develop [[gangrene]] as a result of colonic ischemia have a mortality rate of 50-75% with surgical treatment; the mortality rate is almost 100% without surgical intervention.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Parish K, Chapman W, Williams L | title = Ischemic colitis. An ever-changing spectrum? | journal = Am Surg | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 118–21 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1992867}}</ref>

==Long-term complications==

About 20% of patients with acute ischemic colitis may develop a long-term complication known as ''chronic ischemic colitis''.<ref name="Cappell M 1998 827–60, vi"/> Symptoms can include recurrent infections, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and chronic abdominal pain. Chronic ischemic colitis is often treated with surgical removal of the chronically diseased portion of the bowel.

A ''[[Stenosis|colonic stricture]]'' is a band of scar tissue which forms as a result of the ischemic injury and narrows the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the colon. Strictures are often treated observantly; they may heal spontaneously over 12–24 months. If a [[bowel obstruction]] develops as a result of the stricture, surgical resection is the usual treatment,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Simi M, Pietroletti R, Navarra L, Leardi S | title = Bowel stricture due to ischemic colitis: report of three cases requiring surgery. | journal = Hepatogastroenterology | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–81 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7590579}}</ref> although [[Esophageal dilatation|endoscopic dilatation]] and [[stent]]ing have also been employed.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Oz M, Forde K | title = Endoscopic alternatives in the management of colonic strictures. | journal = Surgery | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 513–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2396196}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Profili S, Bifulco V, Meloni G, Demelas L, Niolu P, Manzoni M | title = [A case of ischemic stenosis of the colon-sigmoid treated with [[Self-expandable metallic stent|self-expandable uncoated metallic prosthesis]]] | journal = Radiol Med (Torino) | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 665–7 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8693144}}</ref>
