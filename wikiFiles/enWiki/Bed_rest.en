'''Bed rest''' is a [[medicine|medical]] treatment involving a period of consistent (day and night) recumbence in bed.  It is used as a treatment for an [[illness]] or medical condition. Bed rest is especially used when prescribed or chosen. Bed rest is not especially used for severe prostration or imminent death. Even though most patients in hospitals spend most of their time in the hospital beds, bed rest more often refers to an extended period of recumbence at home. Some clinicians now regard bed rest as being at best neutral to outcome, and in some cases potentially harmful to patients.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Allen C, Glasziou P, Del Mar C |title=Bed rest: a potentially harmful treatment needing more careful evaluation |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9186 |pages=1229–33 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10520630 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)10063-6 |laysummary=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=1637 |laysource=University of Queensland News Online |laydate=October 9, 1999}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Invalid - Louis Lang - overall.jpg|thumb|''The Invalid'', painting by [[Louis Lang]] in the [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
As a treatment, bed rest is mentioned in the earliest medical writings. The '''rest cure''', or '''bed rest cure''', was a 19th century treatment for many [[mental disorder]]s, particularly [[hysteria]]. "Taking to bed" and becoming an "invalid" for an indefinite period of time was a culturally accepted response to some of the adversities of life. In addition to bed rest, patients were secluded from all family contact in order to reduce dependence on others. The only person that bed rest patients were allowed to see was the nurse who massaged, bathed, and clothed them. Patients were also not allowed to use their hands at all. In some extreme cases [[electrotherapy]] was prescribed. The food the patient was served usually consisted of fatty dairy products in order to revitalize the body with new energy. This cure as well as its name were created by doctor [[Silas Weir Mitchell]], and it was almost always prescribed to women, many of whom were suffering from depression; especially [[postpartum depression]]. It was not effective and caused many to go insane or die. In the middle of the 20th century, bed rest was still a standard treatment for markedly [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. It is still used in cases of carditis secondary to [[rheumatic fever]]. Its popularity and perceived efficacy have varied greatly over the centuries.

==Indications==
Bed rest is commonly prescribed in the following cases.

*For sufferers of [[acute pain]] in the [[Vertebral column|spine]] or [[joint]]s; for example, in the case of [[backache]] the unloading of the corresponding spinal segment decreases the intradiscal pressure, and it would bring relief in cases such as compression of [[spinal nerve]]. The prescribed duration of bed rest vary and opinions differ.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weiner |first=Richard |title=Pain management: a practical guide for clinicians |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=2002 |page=741 |isbn=0-8493-0926-3 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=L2CSdeiMZi4C&pg=PA741&dq=%22bed+rest+is%22}}</ref>
*Bed rest is prescribed for some [[mother|maternal]] or [[fetus|fetal]] complications of [[pregnancy]], such as [[Premature birth|preterm labor]], high [[blood pressure]], incompetent [[cervix]], or [[fetal growth]] problems.  In the past it was a general prescription during any kind of pregnancy, now deprecated.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Nancy |last=Bowers |chapter=Bed Rest |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=_SpJuuhn3lcC&pg=PA181&dq=%22bed+rest+is%22&sig=Q2J4aKa9jTUp-KnyixAu-MiPZWQ |title=The multiple pregnancy sourcebook: pregnancy and the first days with twins, triplets, and more |publisher=Contemporary Books |location=Chicago |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-7373-0306-9}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>
* Women pregnant with [[twins]] or higher-order multiples are at higher risk for preterm labor, [[preeclampsia]] ([[toxemia]]), and other pregnancy complications, thus bed rest is common in these cases.  About 50% of women pregnant with twins will be on some form of bed rest for at least part of their pregnancy.  Recent studies have shown that routine bed rest in twin pregnancies (bed rest in the absence of complications) does not improve outcomes; however, bed rest is almost always prescribed for women carrying triplets or more.

*Bed rest is an important measure in the cases of [[chorea (disease)|chorea]]. In the mild cases it may suffice for treatment.<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/sydenham/sydenham.htm NINDS Sydenham Chorea Information Page] of the [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]</ref>

==Adverse effects==
{{See|Lying_(position)#Long-term risks}}
Prolonged bed rest has long been known to have deleterious physiological effects, such as [[muscle atrophy]] and other forms of [[deconditioning]] such as [[artery|arterial]] constriction.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bleeker MW, De Groot PC, Rongen GA, ''et al.'' |title=Vascular adaptation to deconditioning and the effect of an exercise countermeasure: results of the Berlin Bed Rest study |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=1293–300 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=15932956 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00118.2005}}</ref>  Besides lack of [[physical exercise]] it was shown that another important factor is that the [[hydrostatic pressure]] (caused by [[gravity]]) acts anomalously, resulting in altered distribution of [[body fluids]]. Even physical exercise in bed fails to address certain adverse effects.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Woods, Susan L. |title=Cardiac nursing |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon |year=2005 |page=921 |isbn=0-7817-4718-X |url=http://books.google.com/?id=_vWmbeuYRN8C&pg=RA1-PA921&dq=%22bed+rest+is%22}}</ref>
