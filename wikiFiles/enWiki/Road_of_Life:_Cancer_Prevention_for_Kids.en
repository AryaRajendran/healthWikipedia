===The Ohio State University===
Road of Life also works with the Ohio State University.  Presently, The College of Public Health at The Ohio State University has published their annual report. In the current issue, Road of Life is referenced in an article with the help of the integrated Master of Public Health program students. The Master of Public Health program is accredited through The Ohio State University, and places students in a work environment that is required for their degree. The Office of Practice Education and Career Services work with the students to find an organization to develop an appropriate "practicum" project. The practicum program counts for four credit hours for the student.<ref name="cph.osu.edu">[http://cph.osu.edu/academicprograms/mph/index.cfm Master of Public Health (MPH) - College of Public Health<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>   

Road of Life works hand in hand with the university to allow for students to work and gain experience with the organization as well.<ref name="cph.osu.edu"/>

== Importance of Physical and Nutritional Education ==
Proper nutrition and adequate physical activity produce healthy children.  According to the USDA, these two components are “essential for students to achieve their full academic potential, fulfill mental and physical growth, and lifelong health and well-being”.<ref>School District Model Wellness Policy Language.  Illinois Nutrition Education & Training Program, <www.kidseatwell.org>, p. 2</ref>  While it can be difficult to separate the effects of nutrition and exercise, the two have undeniable effects on an individual’s health when combined. Macera et al.<ref>Macera, C. A.  Promoting Healthy Eating and Physical Activity for a Healthier Nation.  National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</ref> report that as many as 580,000 deaths per year are attributable to unhealthy diets and lack of exercise, factors that also contribute heavily to disabilities resulting from diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and stroke. It is evident that many chronic and non-communicable diseases, such as certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases, may be prevented simply by eating enough fruits and vegetables on a regular basis.  Regular physical activity, according to the ''US Surgeon'' ''General'', “is one the most important things people can do to maintain and improve their physical health, mental health, and overall well-being.”

== Influence of Tobacco Use==
Tobacco use contributes to 440,000 deaths annually in the U.S. and is accompanied by $75 billion in medical expenses.<ref>Albuquerque, M., Starr, G., Schooley, M., Pechacek, T., and Henson, R.  Advancing Tobacco Control Through Evidence-Based Programs.  Chronic Disease Prevention and Control, p. 2</ref> It is the most preventable cause of disease and death in the country.  3,900 U.S. children ages 12–17 years old smoke their first cigarette every day.<ref name="Young People 2006 p. 1">Tobacco Use and the Health of Young People.  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (May 2006), p. 1</ref>  The Centers for Disease Control warns that “of all addictive behaviors, cigarette smoking is the one most likely to become established during adolescence”.<ref name="Young People 2006 p. 1"/>

The effects of cigarettes on young people include respiratory and non-respiratory problems, nicotine addiction, and their potential as a “gateway drug.”  Long term effects of tobacco use range from minor, treatable complications to death.  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) agrees with the evidence: the most consistent finding, over decades of research, is the strong association between tobacco use and cancers of many sites.  Specific to lung cancer, NCI reports that “rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking being followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking followed by decreased in lung cancer death rates in men”.<ref>Cancer Prevention Overview:  Health Professional Version (2006).  National Cancer Institute , p. 2</ref>  Following current smoking trends, as many as 6.4 million of today’s youth could suffer smoking-related premature deaths.<ref name="Young People 2006 p. 1"/>
