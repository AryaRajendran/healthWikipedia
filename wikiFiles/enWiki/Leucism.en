'''Leucism''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|lj|uː|s|ɪ|z|əm}}<ref>{{OED|leucistic}}</ref> is a condition characterized by reduced [[pigmentation]] in animals caused by a [[recessive allele]]. Unlike [[albinism]], it is caused by a reduction in all types of skin pigment, not just [[melanin]].

Leucism (occasionally spelled ''leukism'') is a general term for the [[phenotype]] resulting from defects in [[chromatophore|pigment cell]] differentiation and/or migration from the [[neural crest]] to skin, hair, or feathers during [[morphogenesis|development]]. This results in either the entire surface (if all pigment cells fail to develop) or patches of body surface (if only a subset are defective) having a lack of cells capable of making [[biological pigment|pigment]].

Since all pigment cell-types differentiate from the same [[multipotent]] precursor cell-type, leucism can cause the reduction in all types of pigment. This is in contrast to [[albinism]], for which leucism is often mistaken. Albinism results in the reduction of [[melanin]] production only, though the [[melanocyte]] (or [[Chromatophore#Melanophores|melanophore]]) is still present. Thus in species that have other pigment cell-types, for example [[Chromatophore#Xanthophores and erythrophores|xanthophores]], albinos are not entirely white, but instead display a pale yellow colour.

More common than a complete absence of pigment cells is localized or incomplete [[hypopigmentation]], resulting in irregular patches of white on an animal that otherwise has normal colouring and patterning. This partial leucism is known as a "pied" or "[[piebald]]" effect; and the ratio of white to normal-coloured skin can vary considerably not only between generations, but between different offspring from the same parents, and even between members of the same litter. This is notable in [[horse]]s, [[cow]]s, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, the urban [[crow]]<ref>[http://www.birds.cornell.edu/crows/whitecrows.htm White crows] at Cornell University.</ref> and the [[ball python]]<ref>[http://www.constrictors.com/Collection/BallPythons/PiebaldBallPython.html Piebald ball pythons] at Constrictors.com.</ref> but is also found in many other species.

A further difference between albinism and leucism is in [[eye colour]]. Due to the lack of melanin production in both the [[retina]]l pigmented epithelium (RPE) and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]], albinos typically have red eyes due to the underlying blood vessels showing through. In contrast, most leucistic animals have normally coloured eyes. This is because the melanocytes of the RPE are not derived from the neural crest, instead an outpouching of the [[neural tube]] generates the [[optic cup]] which, in turn, forms the [[retina]]. As these cells are from an independent developmental origin, they are typically unaffected by the genetic cause of leucism.

==Etymology==
The terms ''leucistic'' and ''leucism'' are derived from [[medical terminology]]. The stem ''leuc-'' is the [[Latin]] variant of ''leuk-'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''leukos'' meaning "white" (see Steadman’s, Dorland’s or Taber’s medical dictionaries).
