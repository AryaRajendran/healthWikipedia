'''Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)''' are diagnostic tools for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). They are surrogate markers of ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' infection and indicate a cellular immune response to ''M. tuberculosis''. IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis (TB) disease, and should not be used for diagnosis of active TB, which is a microbiological diagnosis. A positive IGRA result may not necessarily indicate active TB, and a negative IGRA result may not rule out active TB.

Because IGRAs are not affected by [[Bacille Calmette-Guérin]] (BCG) vaccination status, IGRAs are useful for evaluation of LTBI in BCG-vaccinated individuals, particularly in settings where BCG vaccination is administered after infancy or multiple (booster) BCG vaccinations are given. In contrast, the specificity of tuberculin skin test (TST) varies depending on timing of BCG and whether repeated (booster) vaccinations are given. 

'''QuantiFERON''', also known as QFT, is the registered trademark of the test for [[tuberculosis infection]] or [[latent tuberculosis]]. QFT is an [[interferon-γ release assay]] (IGRA) used in [[tuberculosis diagnosis]].
The QFT-GIT assay is an ELISA-based, whole-blood test that uses peptides from three TB antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB7.7) in an in-tube format. The result is reported as quantification of IFN-gamma in international units (IU) per mL. An individual is considered positive for ''M. tuberculosis'' infection if the IFN-gamma response to TB antigens is above the test cut-off (after subtracting the background IFN-gamma response in the negative control).

== QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) ==
QuantiFERON-TB Gold [[QFT-G]] and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [[QFT-GIT]], have replaced QuantiFERON-TB (QFT), which is no longer marketed.

According to the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5202a2.htm|title=Guidelines for Using the QuantiFERON-TB Test for Diagnosing Latent ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' Infection|author=Gerald H. Mazurek, M.D., Margarita E. Villarino, M.D.|accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> in 2001, the QuantiFERON-TB test (QFT) was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as an aid for detecting latent ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' infection. This test is an in vitro diagnostic aid that measures a component of [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated immune reactivity]] to ''M. tuberculosis''. The test is based on the quantification of [[interferon-gamma]] (IFN-γ) released from sensitized [[lymphocytes]] in whole blood incubated overnight with purified [[protein]] derivative (PPD) from ''M. tuberculosis'' and control antigens. 

[[Tuberculin]] skin testing (TST) has been used for years as an aid in diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and includes measurement of the delayed type [[hypersensitivity]] response 48–72 hours after [[intradermal]] injection of PPD. TST and QFT do not measure the same components of the immunologic response and are not interchangeable. Assessment of the accuracy of these tests is limited by lack of a standard for confirming LTBI. 

As a diagnostic test, QFT:
# requires [[venipuncture|phlebotomy]]
# can be accomplished after a single patient visit
# assesses responses to multiple [[antigens]] simultaneously
# does not boost anamnestic immune responses (see [[Latent_tuberculosis#Boosting]]). 

Compared with TST, QFT results are less subject to reader bias and error. In a CDC-sponsored multicenter trial, QFT and TST results were moderately concordant (overall kappa value = 0.60). The level of concordance was adversely affected by prior [[BCG vaccine|bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination]], immune reactivity to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and a prior positive TST.<ref>Mazurek GH, LoBue PA, Daley CL, et al. Comparison of a Whole-Blood Interferon Gamma Assay with Tuberculin Skin Testing for Detecting Latent ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' Infection. JAMA 2001;286:1740-1747</ref> In addition to the multicenter study, two other published studies have demonstrated moderate concordance between TST and QFT.<ref>Pottumarthy S, Morris AJ, Harrison AC, Wells VC. Evaluation of the Tuberculin Gamma Interferon Assay: Potential to Replace the Mantoux Skin Test. J Clin Microbiol 1999;37:3229-3232</ref><ref>Streeton JA, Desem N, Jones SL. Sensitivity and Specificity of a Gamma Interferon Blood Test for Tuberculosis Infection. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis 1998;2:443-450</ref> However, one of the five sites involved in the CDC study reported less agreement.<ref>Bellete B, Coberly J, Barnes GL, et al. Evaluation of a Whole-Blood Interferon-Gamma Release Assay for the Detection of ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' Infection in 2 Study Populations. Clin Infect Dis 2002;34:1449-1456</ref> Although there have been studies confirming the increased future risk of active TB in individuals with positive TST, the same was not true for those with a positive IGRA result. A recently published study<ref>Diel R, Loddenkemper R, Meywald-Walter K, Niemann S, Nienhaus A. Predictive Value of a Whole Blood IFN-γ Assay for the Development of Active Tuberculosis Disease after Recent Infection with ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2008;177:1164–1170</ref> demonstrated that a positive IGRA result is predictive of future active TB risk. Moreover, IGRA was at least as sensitive and was more specific compared to traditional TST. In this study of immunocompetent recently exposed close contacts of active TB cases, the progression rate to active disease among untreated QFT positive individuals was significantly greater than for untreated TST positives (14.6% versus 2.3%). Although the numbers were small, all of the close contacts who went on to develop active TB were QFT positive, but only 83% were TST positive. 

As noted above, prior BCG vaccination can produce false positive TST results. In a study of military personnel returning from missions, about one-half of the positive TSTs were falsely positive.<ref>Bruins J, Gribnau JH and Bwire R. Investigation into Typical and Atypical Tuberculin Sensitivity in the Royal Netherlands Army, Resulting in a More Rational Indication for Isoniazid Prophylaxis. Tuber Lung Dis 1995;76:540-544</ref> In a more recent study of military returning from missions, Franken et al.<ref>Franken WPJ, Timmermans JF, Prins C, et al. Comparison of Mantoux and QuantiFERON TB Gold Tests for Diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Army Personnel. Clin Vaccine Immunol 2007;14:477-480</ref> reported evidence suggesting false positive TST results are common and that QFT testing could guide more targeted treatment and alleviate unnecessary anti-tuberculous treatment.

Limitations of QFT include the need to draw blood and process it within 12 hours after collection and limited laboratory and clinical experience with the assay. There is need for further study of the utility of QFT in predicting the progression to active tuberculosis, particularly in children and immunocompromised hosts.

== QuantiFERON-TB Gold ==
The QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-G) is a whole-blood test for use as an aid in diagnosing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, including latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and tuberculosis (TB) disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/tb/pubs/tbfactsheets/QFT.htm|title=QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test|author=Division of Tuberculosis Elimination|date=2004-04-18|accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005.

Blood samples are mixed with [[antigens]] (substances that can produce an immune response) and controls. For QFT-G, the antigens include mixtures of synthetic [[peptide]]s representing two M. tuberculosis proteins, [[ESAT-6]] and [[CFP-10]]. After incubation of the blood with antigens for 16 to 24 hours, the amount of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is measured.

If the patient is infected with M. tuberculosis, their [[white blood cell]]s will release IFN-gamma in response to contact with the TB [[antigens]]. The QFT-G results are based on the amount of IFN-gamma that is released in response to the antigens. 

Clinical evaluation and additional tests (such as a [[chest radiograph]], sputum smear, and culture) are needed to differentiate between a diagnosis of latent TB or active TB. 

Advantages of the test are:
* Requires a single patient visit to draw a blood sample. 
* Results can be available within 24 hours. 
* Does not boost responses measured by subsequent tests, which can happen with tuberculin skin tests (TST). 
* Is not subject to reader bias that can occur with TST. 
* Is not affected by prior BCG (bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccination. 

Disadvantages and limitations of the test are: 
* Blood samples must be processed within 12 hours after collection while white blood cells are still viable. 
* There is limited data on the use of QFT-G in children younger than 17 years of age, among persons recently exposed to M. tuberculosis, and in immunocompromised persons (e.g., impaired immune function caused by HIV infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], current treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, selected hematological disorders, specific malignancies, diabetes, silicosis, and chronic renal failure). 
* Errors in collecting or transporting blood specimens or in running and interpreting the assay can decrease the accuracy of QFT-G. 
* Limited data on the use of QFT-G to determine who is at risk for developing TB disease.
* False positive results can occur with ''[[Mycobacterium szulgai]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium kansasii]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium marinum]]''.<ref name="Cellestis">{{cite web |title=Clinicians guide to QuantiFERON-TB | publisher=Cellestis Inc. | url=http://www.health.mil/dhb/afeb/meeting/021803meeting/Clinicians%20Guide%20to%20QuantiFERON-TB.pdf | date=November 2001 | accessdate=2009-05-15 }}</ref>

== QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube ==
On 10/10/2007 the US FDA<ref name='FDA'> {{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMA/PMA.cfm?ID=4827 |title=Center for Devices and Radiological Health |accessdate=2009-01-03 |date=2007-10-10 |publisher=FDA }}</ref> gave approval for the Quantiferon TB Gold In Tube to be marketed in the US

The FDA state: <blockquote>''Approval for a modification of the quantiferon-tb gold to an in-tube collection system that consists of three blood collection tubes, nil, tb antigen, and mitogen. The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name quantiferon-tb gold in-tube and is indicated for use as an in vitro diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail simulating esat-6, cfp-10 and tb 7.7(p4) proteins to stimulate cells in heparinized whole blood drawn directly into specialized blood collection tubes. Detection of interferon-y by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) is used to identify in vitro responses to these peptide antigens that are associated with mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.''</blockquote>

According to the FDA approved package insert<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.cellestis.com/IRM/Company/ShowPage.aspx?CPID=1370 |title=Quantiferon-TB Gold In-Tube Package Insert |accessdate=2009-01-03 |date=2007-10-10 |publisher=Cellestis }}</ref> Quantiferon TB Gold In Tube has a consistent specificity of >99% in low risk individuals and a sensitivity as high as 92% in individuals with active disease, depending on setting and extent of disease. The specificity in two studies of a few hundred people is 96-98% in a health immunised population.

The package insert also advises that the kit provides three collection tubes which have had antigens dried onto their walls and that these tubes must be transferred to an incubator within 16 hours of blood collection.

On 25 June 2010, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated the tuberculosis (TB) testing guidelines (MMWR June 2010, http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5905.pdf) providing guidance to US public health officials, clinicians, and laboratory workers regarding screening for and diagnosis of TB infection.
The updated guidelines provide new direction for TB control in the US.

Previously, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold was able to be used in any situation in which the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) was used, without preference. The 2010 guidelines establish a new benchmark because they recommend IGRAs as the preferred TB testing method in many patients, including those who are BCG vaccinated or are unlikely to return for TST reading.

Medical facilities in the US using QFT can be found at http://www.cellestis.com/IRM/content/usa/contact_quantiferon.html.  {Clicking on their column heading "State" twice will sort listings alphabetically by state.  Likely more useful than their current default listing by alphabetical order of "Testing Facility" names}

==Availability==
In the United States, the test is widely available from state [[Medical laboratory|public health laboratories, hospitals, and commercial laboratories]].

In January 2008 the CDC advised - via their TB Notes Newsletter<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/tb/notes/TBN_2_08/labs.htm |title=TB Notes Newsletter |accessdate=2009-01-03 |date=2008-01-02 |publisher=CDC }}</ref> - TB controllers and others of a link<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.quantiferon.com/contacts_usca.php |title=Laboratories Offering QFT Testing |accessdate=2009-01-03 |date= |publisher=Cellestis }}</ref> to a list of laboratories in the US and Canada offering to perform the Quantiferon Gold test.
