'''Neurasthenia''' is a term that was first used at least as early as 1829 to label a mechanical weakness of the ''actual nerves'', rather than the more metaphorical "nerves" referred to by [[George Miller Beard]] later.

As a psychopathological term, neurasthenia was used by Beard in 1869<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = George Miller Beard | last = Beard | first = G | year = 1869 | title = Neurasthenia, or nervous exhaustion | journal = The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal | pages = 217–221}}</ref> to denote a condition with symptoms of [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anxiety]], [[headache]], [[neuralgia]] and [[depression (mood)|depressed mood]]. 

Neurasthenia is currently a diagnosis in the World Health Organization's [[ICD|International Classification of Diseases]] (and in the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]], translated as '''神经衰弱'''). However, it is no longer included as a diagnosis in the American Psychiatric Association's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].

Americans were said to be particularly prone to neurasthenia, which resulted in the nickname "'''Americanitis'''"<ref>{{cite news | last = Marcus| first = G| date = 1998-01-26 | title = One Step Back; Where Are the Elixirs of Yesteryear When We Hurt?  | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate= 2008-09-11 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E1DB133BF935A15752C0A96E958260}}</ref> (popularized by [[William James]]). Another, rarely used term for neurasthenia is '''nervosism'''.<ref>http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Nervosism</ref><br />

==Symptoms==
The condition was explained as being a result of exhaustion of the [[central nervous system]]'s energy reserves, which Beard attributed to modern civilization. Physicians in the Beard school of thought associated neurasthenia with the stresses of [[urbanization]] and with stress suffered as a result of the increasingly competitive business environment. Typically, it was associated with [[upper class]] people and with [[professional]]s working in sedentary occupations.

[[Freud]] included a variety of physical symptoms in this category, including fatigue, [[dyspepsia]] with [[flatulence]], and indications of [[intra-cranial pressure]] and spinal irritation.<ref name="Models">{{cite book |last1=Sandler |first1=Joseph |last2=Holder |first2=Alex |last3=Dare |first3=Christopher |last4=Dreher |first4=Anna Ursula |title=Freud's Models of the Mind |year=1997 |isbn=1-85575-167-4 |page=52 |publisher=Karnac Books}}</ref> In common with some other people of the time, he believed this condition to be due to "non-completed coitus" or the non-completion of the higher cultural correlate thereof, or to  "infrequency of emissions" or the infrequent practice of the higher cultural correlate thereof.<ref name="Models" /> Later, Freud formulated that in cases of coitus interruptus as well as in cases of masturbation, there was "an insufficient libidinal discharge" that had a poisoning effect on the organism, in other words, neurasthenia was the result of (auto-)intoxication.<ref>Freud Encyclopaedia, pg 362, http://books.google.com/books?id=rX2w6QELtKgC&pg=PA362&lpg=PA362&dq=freud+neurasthenia+coitus&source=bl&ots=t8xg8MjzZ6&sig=JpinNvDo0RXuKn6bgFmS-s2tmLo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qTtiUK-bFYrK9gS0moHwBQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=freud%20neurasthenia%20coitus&f=false</ref> Eventually he separated it from [[anxiety neurosis]], though he believed that a combination of the two conditions coexisted in many cases.<ref name="Models" />

==Diagnosis==

{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}

From 1869, neurasthenia became a "popular" diagnosis, expanding to include such symptoms as [[weakness (medical)|weakness]], [[dizziness]] and [[fainting]], and a common treatment was the [[rest cure]], especially for women, who were the gender primarily diagnosed with this condition at that time. Recent analysis, however, of data from this period gleaned from the Annual Reports of Queen Square Hospital, London, indicates that the diagnosis was more evenly balanced between the sexes than is commonly thought.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Ruth E |title=Death of neurasthenia and its psychological reincarnation. A study of neurasthenia at the National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of the Paralysed and Epileptic, Queen Square, London, 1870-1932 |journal=British Jnl of Psychiatry |year=2001 |volume=179 |pages=550–557 |doi=10.1192/bjp.179.6.550 |issue=6}}</ref> [[Virginia Woolf]] was known to have been forced to have rest cures, which she describes in her book ''[[On Being Ill]]''. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s protagonist in ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'' also suffers under the auspices of rest cure doctors, much like Gilman herself. [[Marcel Proust]] was said to suffer from neurasthenia. To capitalize on this epidemic, the [[Rexall]] drug company introduced a medication called 'Americanitis Elixir' which claimed to be a soother for any bouts related to Neurasthenia.

==Treatment==
Beard, with his partner [[A.D. Rockwell]], advocated first [[electrotherapy]] and then increasingly experimental treatments for people with neurasthenia, a position that was controversial. An 1868 review posited that Beard's and Rockwell's knowledge of the [[scientific method]] was suspect and did not believe their claims to be warranted.

William James was diagnosed with neurasthenia, and was quoted as saying, "I take it that no man is educated who has never dallied with the thought of suicide."<ref>{{cite book |author=Townsend, Kim |title=Manhood at Harvard: William James and others |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0-393-03939-0}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In 1895, [[Sigmund Freud]] reviewed electrotherapy and declared it a "pretense treatment." He emphasized the example of Elizabeth von R's note that "the stronger these were the more they seemed to push her own pains into the background."

Nevertheless, neurasthenia was a common diagnosis during [[World War I]], but its use declined a decade later.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Contemporary opinion==

This concept remained popular well into the 20th century, eventually coming to be seen as a behavioural rather than physical condition, with a diagnosis that excluded postviral syndromes. Neurasthenia has largely been abandoned as a medical diagnosis.<ref name="pmid 10583715">{{cite journal |author= Evangard B, Schacterie R.S., Komaroff A.

One contemporary opinion of neurasthenia is that it was actually [[dysautonomia]], an "imbalance" of the [[autonomic nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://heartdisease.about.com/cs/womensissues/a/dysautonomia.htm | title = A family of misunderstood disorders | first = R| last = Fogoros | publisher = [[About.com]] | date = 2006-05-29 | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}</ref>

[[Barbara Ehrenreich]] considers that neurasthenia was caused by the Calvinist gloom,<ref name=jenni/> and it was helped by the [[New Thought]], through replacing the "puritanical 'demand for perpetual effort and self-examination to the point of self-loathing'"<ref name=jenni/> with a more hopeful faith.<ref name=jenni>Jenni Murray, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jan/10/smile-or-die-barbara-ehrenreich Smile or Die: How Positive Thinking Fooled America and the World by Barbara Ehrenreich.

===In Asia===
The medical term ''neurasthenia'' is translated as Chinese ''shenjing shuairuo'' ({{zh|s=神经衰弱|t=神經衰弱|p= shénjīng shuāiruò}}) or Japanese ''shinkei-suijaku'' (神経衰弱), both of which also translate the common term ''[[nervous breakdown]]''. This loanword combines ''shenjing'' ([[wikt:神經|神經]]) or ''shinkei'' ([[wikt:神経|神経]])  "nerve(s); nervous" and ''shuairuo'' or ''suijaku'' ([[wikt:衰弱|衰弱]]) "weakness; feebleness; debility; [[asthenia]]".

Despite being omitted by the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] in 1980, neurasthenia is listed in an appendix as the [[culture-bound syndrome]] ''shenjing shuairuo'' as well as appearing in the [[ICD-10]].  The condition is thought to persist in [[Asia]] as a culturally acceptable diagnosis that avoids the [[social stigma]] of a diagnosis of [[mental disorder]]. 

In [[Japan]], ''shinkei-suijaku'' is treated with [[Morita therapy]] involving mandatory rest and isolation, followed by progressively more difficult work, and a resumption of a previous social role. The diagnosis is sometimes used as a disguise for serious mental illnesses such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[mood disorder]]s.<ref name = Asia>{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=Pamela Yew |title=Why is neurasthenia important in Asian cultures? |journal=West.

Med. |volume=176 |issue=4 |pages=257–8 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12208833 |pmc=1071745 |doi= | accessdate = 2008-09-11}}</ref><ref>Tsung-Yi Lin (1989), "Neurasthenia revisited: Its place in modern psychiatry," ''Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry'', 13.2: 105-129, {{doi|10.1007/BF02220656}}.</ref>

In [[China]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] describes ''shenjingshuairuo'' as a depletion of ''[[qi]]'' "vital energy" and reduction of functioning in the [[Zang-fu#Five System| ''wuzang'']] "five internal organs" (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys). The modern [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders|CCMD]] classifies it as a persistent mental disorder diagnosed with three of these five symptoms: "'weakness' symptoms, 'emotional' symptoms, 'excitement' symptoms, tension-induced pain, and sleep disturbances" not caused by other conditions.<ref name = Asia /> [[Arthur Kleinman]] described Chinese neurasthenia as a "biculturally patterned illness experience (a special form of somatization), related to depression or other diseases or to culturally sanctioned [[idiom of distress|idioms of distress]] and psychosocial coping."<ref>Kleinman, Arthur (1986), ''Social Origins of Distress and Disease: Depression, Neurasthenia, and Pain in Modern China'', Yale University Press, p. 115.</ref>
