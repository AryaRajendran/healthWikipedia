{{Osteopathic medicine}}
'''Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine''' ('''D.O.''' or '''DO''') is a professional [[doctoral degree]] for [[physician]]s offered by medical schools in the [[United States]]. Holders of the D.O. degree are known as [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physicians]] and have the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as [[physicians]] with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree (M.D.).<ref name=Medline />  D.O. physicians are licensed to practice the full scope of [[medicine]] and [[surgery]] in all 50 states, and make up 7 percent of the total U.S. physician population.  There are over 77,784 D.O. physicians in the United States, of which 69,429 are in active practice.<ref name=OMP_2012>{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical Profession Report 2012|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2012-OMP-report.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association}}</ref>

Currently, there are 29 medical schools with 37 locations throughout the United States that offer the D.O. degree,<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|url=http://www.aacom.org/about/colleges/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=AACOM|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> and 141 [[Medical school in the United States|medical schools]] that offer the M.D. degree.<ref>[http://www.lcme.org/directry.htm Directory of Accredited Medical Education Programs, Liaison Committee on Medical Education]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aamc.org/about/medicalschools/|title=AAMC Medical Schools|accessdate=2006-12-13|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges}}</ref> As of 2011, 1 in 5 medical students in the United States were D.O. students.<ref>{{cite news |title=Booming medical school brings life to downtown Pomona |author=Ricardo Lopez |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-western-osteopathy-20120406,0,1875405.story?page=1 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 6, 2012 |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aacom.org/about/osteomed/Pages/default.aspx |title=What is Osteopathic Medicine |author= |date= |work= |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref>  The curricula at [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic]] medical schools are [[Comparison of MD and DO in the United States|very similar to those at M.D.-granting medical schools]].<ref name=Harrisons>{{cite book|author=Kasper, Dennis L.|coauthors=Eugene Braunwald, Anthony S.

==Demographics==
In the United States, there are over 77,784 osteopathic physicians; of which 69,429 are in active practice.<ref name=OMP_2012>{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical Profession Report 2012|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2012-OMP-report.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association}}</ref>

== Education and Training ==
Osteopathic medical school curricula are virtually identical to those at schools granting the Doctor of Medicine [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree.  Once admitted to an osteopathic medical school, it takes about four years to graduate, and the schooling is roughly divided into the pre-clinical and clinical years.  The pre-clinical years, the first and second years, focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences.  The clinical years, the third and fourth years, consist of [[Clerkship (medicine)|core clinical training]] in the clinical specialties.  Osteopathic medical school accreditation standards require training in [[internal medicine]], [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics/gynecology]], [[pediatrics]], [[family practice]], [[surgery]], [[psychiatry]], [[emergency medicine]], [[radiology]], [[preventive medicine]] and [[public health]].<ref name=curriculum>{{cite web|title=Overview of Osteopathic Medical Education/Accreditation/The Four-Year Curriculum (2012 Osteopathic Medical College Information Book) |url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-p8.pdf |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|year=2012}}</ref>  According to [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]], "the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of physicians with M.D. qualifications, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and [[Board certification|[board] certification]]."<ref name=Harrisons /> However, D.O. schools provide an additional 300 – 500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system, which is referred to as [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]].<ref name=Medline>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002020.htm |title=Doctor of Osteopathic medicine (D.O.) |author=MedLine Plus |year=2007 |work=National Institute of Health |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> 

After completing medical school, D.O. physicians begin graduate medical training.  Many D.O. physicians attend the same internship and [[residency (medicine)|residency]] training programs as their M.D. counterparts,<ref name=ACGME_Data2011 /> and then take M.D. specialty board exams<ref>{{cite web |url=https://members.aamc.org/eweb/upload/Roadmap%20to%20Residency%202ndEd.pdf |title=Roadmap to Residency: From Application to the Match and Beyond |author= |year=2007 |work= |publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> while other D.O. graduates enter osteopathic internships and residencies<ref name=AOAapprovedResidency /><ref name="The DO"/> and take D.O. specialty board examinations.<ref name=SpecialtyCertBoards />

===Student Aptitude Indicators===
Some authors note the differences in the average [[Grade point average|GPA]] and [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] scores of students who matriculate at D.O. schools versus those who matriculate at M.D. schools within the United States.  In 2011, the average MCAT and GPA for students entering U.S.-based M.D. programs were 31.1 and 3.67,<ref>{{cite web|title=Table 17: MCAT Scores and GPAs for Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools|url=https://www.aamc.org/download/161690/data/table17.pdf|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges|date=2000-2011}}</ref> respectively, and 26.51 and 3.50 for D.O. matriculants,<ref name=2011_MatriculantProfile>{{cite web|title=AACOMAS Matriculant Profile 2011 Entering Class|url=http://www.aacom.org/data/applicantsmatriculants/Documents/2011Matriculantsummary.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref> although the gap has been getting smaller every year.<ref name=2011_MatriculantProfile /> Up to one third of students matriculating at a D.O. medical school were not accepted by M.D. programs;<ref name=Cooper>{{cite journal |author=Cooper RA |title=Medical schools and their applicants: an analysis |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=71–84 |year=2003 |pmid=12889752 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/4/71.full}}</ref> however, DO medical schools are more likely to accept non-traditional students<ref>{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical College Information Book|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-whole.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Madison Park |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/13/mid.life.doctors/index.html?hpt=hp_t2/ |title=Never too late to be a doctor |publisher=CNN News  |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref> who are older and entering medicine as a second career, or coming from non-science majors.  D.O. medical students are required to take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination ([[COMLEX-USA]]) that is sponsored by the [[National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners]] (NBOME).  This exam is a prerequisite for osteopathic residency programs, which are available in almost every specialty of medicine and surgery.  D.O. medical students may also choose to sit for the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmle.org/bulletin/eligibility/ |title=United States Medical Licensing Examination &#124; USMLE Bulletin &#124; Eligibility |publisher=Usmle.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> if they wish to take an M.D. residency; however, if they have taken COMLEX, it may or may not be needed, depending on the individual institution’s program requirements.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sarko|first=John|coauthors=Svoren, Elena; Katz, Eric|title=COMLEX-1 and USMLE-1 Are Not Interchangeable Examinations|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|year=2010|month=February|volume=17|issue=2|pages=218–220|doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00632.x|pmid=20070273|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00632.x/full|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Chick|first=Davoren A.|coauthors=Harley P.

{{further2|[[Comparison of MD and DO in the United States]]}}

== Licensing and board certification ==
To obtain a license to practice medicine in the United States, medical students must pass the [[COMLEX]] (Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Exam),<ref>{{cite web|title=Board Examinations and Licensure|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-p11.pdf|work=Medical College Information Book, 2012 edition|publisher=AACOM|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> which is the exam given by the licensing board at the conclusion of their medical training.  Students are given the option of taking the [[USMLE]] (United States Medical Licensing Exam) to apply for some Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) residency programs. Those that have received or are in the process of earning an M.D. or D.O. are both eligible to sit for the USMLE. Because of their additional training, only holders of the D.O. are eligible to sit for the COMLEX.<ref>{{cite web|title=COMLEX-USA: Bulletin of Information|url=http://www.nbome.org/docs/comlexboi.pdf|publisher=National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

Upon completion of internship and residency requirements for their chosen medical specialty, and depending on whether the program attended as ACGME or AOA accredited, holders of the D.O. may elect to be board certified by either a specialty board (through the [[American Medical Association]]'s [[American Board of Medical Specialties]]) or an osteopathic specialty board (through the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] certifying boards).

Depending on the state, medical licensure may be issued from a combined board (D.O. and M.D.) or a separate board of medical examiners.<ref name=DirectoryBoards>{{cite web|title=Directory of State Medical and Osteopathic Boards|url=http://www.fsmb.org/directory_smb.html|publisher=Federation of State Medical Boards|accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref> All of the 70 state medical boards are members of the [[Federation of State Medical Boards]].<ref name=FSMB>{{cite web|title=Federation of State Medical Boards|url=http://www.fsmb.org/index.html|publisher=Federation of State Medical Boards|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>

== International variations ==
Currently, there are no osteopathic programs located outside of the United States that would qualify an individual to practice as an osteopathic physician in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aacom.org/about/osteomed/Pages/TheDifference.aspx |title=The Difference Between U.S.-Trained Osteopathic Physicians and Osteopaths Trained Abroad |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine |accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>  Foreign osteopathic degrees are not recognized by any state in the U.S. as being equivalent to American D.O. degrees.
