'''Fluoroscopy''' is an imaging technique that uses [[X-ray]]s to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and fluorescent screen between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an [[X-ray image intensifier]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[video camera]] allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor.

The use of X-rays, a form of [[ionizing radiation]], requires the potential risks from a procedure to be carefully balanced with the benefits of the procedure to the patient. While physicians always try to use low [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] rates during fluoroscopic procedures, the length of a typical procedure often results in a relatively high [[absorbed dose]] to the patient. Recent advances include the digitization of the images captured and [[flat panel detector]] systems which reduce the radiation dose to the patient still further.

==History==
The beginning of fluoroscopy can be traced back to 8 November 1895 when [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] noticed a [[barium]] [[platinocyanide]] screen fluorescing as a result of being exposed to what he would later call [[x-ray]]s.  Within months of this discovery, the first fluoroscopes were created.  Early fluoroscopes were simply cardboard funnels, open at narrow end for the eyes of the observer, while the wide end was closed with a thin cardboard piece that had been coated on the inside with a layer of fluorescent metal salt. The fluoroscopic image obtained in this way is rather faint. [[Thomas Edison]] quickly discovered that [[calcium tungstate]] screens produced brighter images and is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope.  In its infancy, many incorrectly predicted that the moving images from fluoroscopy would completely replace the still x-ray [[radiographs]], but the superior diagnostic quality of the earlier radiographs
prevented this from occurring.

Ignorance of the harmful effects of x-rays resulted in the absence of standard radiation safety procedures which are employed today. Scientists and physicians would often place their hands directly in the x-ray beam resulting in [[radiation burns]]. Edison's assistant [[Clarence Madison Dally]] (1865–1904) died as a result of exposure to radiation from fluoroscopes, and in 1903, Edison abandoned his work on fluoroscopes, saying "Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.".<ref>Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library : "Edison Fears the Hidden Perils of the X-Rays", ''[[New York World]]'', August 3, 1903, Durham, NC.</ref> Trivial uses for the technology also resulted, including the [[shoe-fitting fluoroscope]] used by shoe stores in the 1930s-1950s.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/shoefittingfluor/shoe.htm | title = Shoe-Fitting Fluoroscope (ca. 1930-1940) | work = Health Physics Instrumentation Museum | publisher = [[ORAU]] }}</ref>

Due to the limited light produced from the fluorescent screens, early [[radiologists]] were required to sit in a darkened room, in which the procedure was to be performed, accustomizing their eyes to the dark and thereby increasing their sensitivity to the light.  The placement of the radiologist behind the screen resulted in significant [[radiation dose]]s to the radiologist. [[Red adaptation goggles]] were developed by [[Wilhelm Trendelenburg]] in 1916 to address the problem of [[dark adaptation]] of the eyes, previously studied by [[Antoine Beclere]].  The resulting red light from the goggles' filtration correctly sensitized the physician's eyes prior to the procedure while still allowing him to receive enough light to function normally.

The [[red adaptation goggles]] became obsolete as image intensifiers allowed the light produced by the fluorescent screen to be amplified, allowing it to be seen even in a lighted room.  The addition of the [[camera]] enabled viewing of the image on a monitor, allowing a radiologist to view the images in a separate room away from the risk of [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]].

More modern improvements in screen [[phosphors]], image intensifiers and even [[flat panel detectors]] have allowed for increased image quality while minimizing the radiation dose to the patient.  Modern fluoroscopes use [[Caesium iodide|CsI]] screens and produce noise-limited images, ensuring that the minimal radiation dose results while still obtaining images of acceptable quality.

==Risks==
[[File:Fluoroscopy burn.jpg|thumb|[[Fluoroscopy burn]] from long exposure]]
{{main|Fluoroscopy burn}}
Because fluoroscopy involves the use of x-rays, a form of [[ionizing radiation]], all fluoroscopic procedures pose a potential risk of [[radiation-induced cancer]] to the patient. Radiation doses to the patient depend greatly on the size of the patient as well as length of the procedure, with typical skin dose rates quoted as 20–50 [[Gray (unit)|mGy]]/min.  Exposure times vary depending on the procedure being performed, but procedure times up to 75 minutes have been documented.  Because of the long length of some procedures, in addition to the [[cancer]] risk and other stochastic radiation effects, deterministic radiation effects have also been observed ranging from mild [[erythema]], equivalent of a [[sun burn]], to more serious burns.

A study in 1994 of radiation induced skin injuries has been performed by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MedicalX-Rays/ucm116682.htm | title = Radiation-induced Skin Injuries from Fluoroscopy | publisher = FDA }}</ref><ref>{{ cite pmid | 8888398 }}</ref> followed by an advisory to minimize further fluoroscopy-induced injuries.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/PublicHealthNotifications/UCM063084 | title = Public Health Advisory on Avoidance of Serious X-Ray-Induced skin Injuries to Patients During Fluoroscopically-Guided Procedures | publisher = FDA | date = September 30, 1994 }}</ref> The problem of radiation injuries due to fluoroscopy has been further addressed in review articles in 2000<ref>{{ cite pmid | 11459599 }}</ref> and 2010.<ref>{{ cite pmid | 20093507 }}</ref>

While deterministic radiation effects are a possibility, [[radiation burns]] are not typical of standard fluoroscopic procedures.  Most procedures sufficiently long in duration to produce radiation burns are part of necessary life-saving operations.

[[X-ray image intensifier]]s generally have radiation-reducing systems such as pulsed rather than constant radiation, and ''last image hold'', which "freezes" the screen and makes it available for examination without exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.walterrobinson.com/images/Walt_PPT/ppt_pres/sld044.htm | publisher = Walter L.

==Equipment==
[[File:Fluoroscopy.jpg|thumb|A fluoroscopy x-ray machine is a great asset during surgery for implants]]
The first fluoroscopes consisted of an x-ray source and fluorescent screen between which the patient would be placed.  As the x-rays pass through the patient, they are [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuated]] by varying amounts as they interact with the different internal structures of the body, casting a [[shadow]] of the structures on the fluorescent screen.  Images on the screen are produced as the unattenuated x rays interact with atoms in the screen through the [[photoelectric effect]], giving their energy to the [[electrons]].  While much of the energy given to the [[electron]]s is dissipated as [[heat]], a fraction of it is given off as visible light, producing the images.  Early [[radiologists]] would adapt their eyes to view the dim fluoroscopic images by sitting in darkened rooms, or by wearing [[red adaptation goggles]].

===X-ray image intensifiers===
{{main|Image intensifier}}

The invention of [[X-ray image intensifier]]s in the 1950s allowed the image on the screen to be visible under normal lighting conditions, as well as providing the option of recording the images with a conventional camera. Subsequent improvements included the coupling of, at first, video cameras and, later, [[Charge-coupled device|CCD cameras]] to permit recording of moving images and electronic storage of still images.

Modern image intensifiers no longer use a separate fluorescent screen. Instead, a [[caesium iodide]] phosphor is deposited directly on the photocathode of the intensifier tube. On a typical general purpose system, the output image is approximately 10<sup>5</sup> times brighter than the input image. This ''brightness gain'' comprises a ''flux gain'' (amplification of photon number) and ''minification gain'' (concentration of photons from a large input screen onto a small output screen) each of approximately 100. This level of gain is sufficient that [[quantum noise]], due to the limited number of x-ray photons, is a significant factor limiting image quality.

Image intensifiers are available with input diameters of up to 45&nbsp;cm, and a resolution of approximately 2-3 line pairs mm<sup>−1</sup>.

===Flat-panel detectors===
{{main|Flat panel detector}}
The introduction of flat-panel detectors allows for the replacement of the image intensifier in fluoroscope design.  Flat panel detectors offer increased sensitivity to X-rays, and therefore have the potential to reduce patient radiation dose. Temporal resolution is also improved over image intensifiers, reducing motion blurring. Contrast ratio is also improved over image intensifiers: flat-panel detectors are linear over a very wide latitude, whereas image intensifiers have a maximum contrast ratio of about 35:1. Spatial resolution is approximately equal, although an image intensifier operating in 'magnification' mode may be slightly better than a flat panel.

Flat panel detectors are considerably more expensive to purchase and repair than image intensifiers, so their uptake is primarily in specialties that require high-speed imaging, e.g., [[angiography|vascular imaging]] and [[cardiac catheterization]].

===Contrast agents===
A number of substances have been used as positive contrast agents: [[silver]], [[bismuth]], [[caesium]], [[thorium]], [[tin]], [[zirconium]], [[tantalum]], [[tungsten]] and [[lanthanide]] compounds have been used as contrast agents. The use of [[thoria]] (thorium dioxide) as an agent was rapidly stopped as thorium causes [[liver]] [[cancer]].
Most modern injected radiographic positive contrast media are iodine-based. Iodinated contrast comes in two forms: ionic and non-ionic compounds.  Non-ionic contrast is significantly more expensive than ionic (approximately three to five times the cost), however, non-ionic contrast tends to be safer for the patient, causing fewer allergic reactions and uncomfortable side effects such as hot sensations or flushing.  Most imaging centers now use non-ionic contrast exclusively, finding that the benefits to patients outweigh the expense.

Negative radiographic contrast agents are [[air]] and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>). The latter is easily absorbed by the body and causes less spasm. It can also be injected into the blood, where air absolutely cannot.

==Imaging concerns==
In addition to spatial blurring factors that plague all x-ray imaging devices, caused by such things as [[Lubberts effect]], [[K-fluorescence]] reabsorption and [[electron]] range, fluoroscopic systems also experience temporal blurring due to system [[lag]].  This temporal blurring has the effect of averaging frames together.  While this helps reduce noise in images with stationary objects, it creates [[motion blur]]ring for moving objects.  Temporal blurring also complicates measurements of [[system performance]] for fluoroscopic systems.

==Common procedures using fluoroscopy==

*Investigations of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], including [[barium enema]]s, [[defecating proctogram]]s, [[barium meal]]s and [[barium swallow]]s, and [[enteroclysis]]. {{dablink|See also [[#Gastrointestinal fluoroscopy|section below]]}}
*[[Orthopaedic surgery]] to guide fracture reduction and the placement of metalwork.
*[[Angiography]] of the leg, heart and cerebral vessels.
* Placement of a PICC ([[peripherally inserted central catheter]])
* Placement of a weighted feeding tube (e.g. Dobhoff) into the duodenum after previous attempts without fluoroscopy have failed.
*[[Urology|Urological surgery]] &ndash; particularly in retrograde [[pyelography]].
*Implantation of cardiac rhythm management devices ([[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]], [[implantable cardioverter defibrillator]]s and [[cardiac resynchronization device]]s)
*[[Lumbar provocative discography|Discography]], an invasive diagnostic procedure for evaluation for [[intervertebral disc]] pathology.

Another common procedure is the '''modified barium swallow study''' during which [[barium]]-impregnated liquids and solids are ingested by the patient. A radiologist records and, with a speech pathologist, interprets the resulting images to diagnose oral and pharyngeal swallowing dysfunction. Modified barium swallow studies are also used in studying normal swallow function.

===Gastrointestinal fluoroscopy===
Fluoroscopy can be used to examine the [[digestive system]] using a substance which is opaque to X-rays, (usually [[barium sulfate]] or [[Diatrizoic acid|gastrografin]]), which is introduced into the digestive system either by swallowing or as an [[enema]]. This is normally as part of a ''double contrast technique,'' using positive and negative contrast.  Barium sulfate coats the walls of the digestive tract (positive contrast), which allows the shape of the digestive tract to be outlined as white or clear on an X-ray.  Air may then be introduced (negative contrast), which looks black on the film. The barium meal is an example of a contrast agent swallowed to examine the upper digestive tract. Note that while soluble [[barium]] compounds are very toxic, the insoluble [[barium sulfate]] is non-toxic because its low solubility prevents the body from absorbing it.

=== Cine ===
In the medical information vernacular, "cine" refers to cineradiography which records 30 [[frame rate|frames per second]] fluoroscopic images of internal organs such as the heart taken during injection of contrast dye to better visualize regions of [[stenosis]], or to record motility in the body's gastrointestinal tract. The technology is being replaced with digital imaging systems that decrease the frame rate, but also decrease the absorbed dose of radiation to the patient{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
