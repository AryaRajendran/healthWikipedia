{{distinguish2|[[rennin]], the active enzyme in [[rennet]]}}

'''Renin''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|iː|n|ɨ|n}} {{respell|REE|nin}}), also known as an '''angiotensinogenase''', is an [[enzyme]] that participates in the body's [[renin-angiotensin system]] (RAS)—also known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis—that mediates [[extracellular]] volume (i.e., that of the [[blood plasma]], [[lymph]] and [[interstitial fluid]]), and arterial [[vasoconstriction]]. Thus, it regulates the body's mean arterial [[blood pressure]].

== Biochemistry and physiology ==

===Structure===
The primary structure of renin precursor consists of 406 amino acids with a pre- and a pro-segment carrying 20 and 46 amino acids, respectively. Mature renin contains 340 [[amino acid]]s and has a mass of 37 [[atomic mass unit|kDa]].<ref name="pmid6324167">{{cite journal |author=Imai, T.; Miyazaki, H.; Hirose, S.; Hori, H.; Hayashi, T.; Kageyama, R.; Ohkubo, H.; Nakanishi, S.; and Murakami, K. |title=Cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA for human renin precursor |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A. |volume=80 |issue=24 |pages=7405–9 |year=1983 |month=December |pmid=6324167 |pmc=389959 |doi=10.1073/pnas.80.24.7405 }}</ref>

=== Secretion ===
The enzyme renin is secreted by the [[kidney]] from specialized cells called granular cells of the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] via 3 responses:
# A decrease in arterial blood pressure (that could be related to a decrease in blood volume) as detected by [[baroreceptors]] (pressure-sensitive cells). This is the most direct causal link between blood pressure and renin secretion (the other two methods operate via longer pathways).
# A decrease in [[sodium chloride]] levels in the [[Ultrafiltration_(renal)|ultrafiltrate]] of the nephron. This flow is measured by the [[macula densa]] of the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]].
# [[Sympathetic nervous system]] activity, which also controls blood pressure, acting through the beta<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.

Human renin is secreted by at least 2 cellular pathways: a constitutive pathway for the secretion of prorenin and a regulated pathway for the secretion of mature renin.<ref name="pmid2893797">{{cite journal |author=Pratt, R.

The renin enzyme circulates in the blood stream and breaks down ([[hydrolyzes]]) [[angiotensinogen]] secreted from the liver into the peptide [[angiotensin I]].

Angiotensin I is further cleaved in the lungs by endothelial-bound [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) into [[angiotensin II]], the most vasoactive peptide.<ref name="pmid15372104">{{cite journal |author=Fujino, T.; Nakagawa, N.; Yuhki, K.; Hara, A.; Yamada, T.; Takayama, K.; Kuriyama, S.; Hosoki, Y.; Takahata, O.; Taniguchi, T.; Fukuzawa, J.; Hasebe, N.; Kikuchi, K.; Narumiya, S.; and Ushikubi, F. |title=Decreased susceptibility to renovascular hypertension in mice lacking the prostaglandin I2 receptor IP |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=114 |issue=6 |pages=805–12 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15372104 |pmc=516260 |doi=10.1172/JCI21382 }}</ref><ref>''Brenner & Rector's The Kidney'', 7th ed., Saunders, 2004, pp. 2118-2119 [http://home.mdconsult.com/das/book/56203699-6/view/1201?sid=460067115 Full Text with MDConsult subscription]</ref> Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the smooth muscle and, therefore, raises the resistance posed by these arteries to the heart. The heart, trying to overcome this increase in its 'load', works more vigorously, causing the blood pressure to rise. Angiotensin II also acts on the adrenal glands and releases [[Aldosterone]], which stimulates the epithelial cells in the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of sodium and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. The RAS also acts on the CNS to increase water intake by stimulating [[thirst]], as well as conserving blood volume, by reducing urinary loss through the secretion of [[Vasopressin]] from the posterior [[pituitary]] gland.

The normal concentration of renin in adult human [[blood plasma|plasma]] is 1.98-24.6&nbsp;ng/L in the upright position.<ref>Hamilton Regional Laboratory Medicine Program - Laboratory Reference Centre Manual. [deadlink]</ref>

== Function ==
Renin activates the renin-angiotensin system by cleaving angiotensinogen, produced by the [[liver]], to yield angiotensin I, which is further converted into angiotensin II by ACE, the angiotensin-converting enzyme primarily within the capillaries of the lungs. Angiotensin II then constricts [[blood vessel]]s, increases the secretion of [[antidiuretic hormone|ADH]] and [[aldosterone]], and stimulates the [[hypothalamus]] to activate the thirst reflex, each leading to an increase in [[blood pressure]].

Renin is secreted from kidney cells, which are activated via signaling from the [[macula densa]], which responds to the rate of fluid flow through the [[distal tubule]], by decreases in renal perfusion pressure (through stretch receptors in the vascular wall), and by sympathetic nervous stimulation, mainly through beta-1 adrenoceptor activation. A drop in the rate of flow past the macula densa implies a drop in renal filtration pressure. Renin's primary function is therefore to eventually cause an increase in blood pressure, leading to restoration of perfusion pressure in the kidneys.

Renin can bind to [[ATP6AP2]], which results in a fourfold increase in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I over that shown by soluble renin. In addition, renin binding results in [[phosphorylation]] of serine and tyrosine residues of ATP6AP2.<ref name="pmid12045255">{{cite journal |author=Nguyen, Geneviève; Delarue, Françoise; Burcklé, Céline; Bouzhir, Latifa; Giller, Thomas; and Sraer, Jean-Daniel |title=Pivotal role of the renin/prorenin receptor in angiotensin II production and cellular responses to renin |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=1417–27 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12045255 |pmc=150992 |doi=10.1172/JCI14276 }}</ref>

The level of renin mRNA appears to be modulated by the binding of [[HADHB]], [[ELAVL1|HuR]] and [[PCBP1|CP1]] to a [[Renin stability regulatory element (REN-SRE)|regulatory region]] in the [[Three prime untranslated region|3' UTR]].<ref name="pmid12933794">{{cite journal |author=Adams, D.

== Clinical applications ==
{{Main|Renin inhibitor}}

An over-active renin-angiotension system leads to vasoconstriction and retention of [[sodium]] and water. These effects lead to [[hypertension]]. Therefore, [[renin inhibitor]]s can be used for the treatment of hypertension.<ref>[http://pharmaxchange.info/presentations/dri.html Presentation on Direct Renin Inhibitors as Antihypertensive Drugs]</ref><ref name="pmid19715410">{{cite journal |author=Ram, C. V. |title=Direct inhibition of renin: a physiological approach to treat hypertension and cardiovascular disease |journal=Future Cardiology |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=453–65 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19715410 |doi=10.2217/fca.09.31 }}</ref> This is measured by the [[PRA (Medical)|plasma renin activity]] (PRA).

In current medical practice, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-System's overactivity (and resultant hypertension) is more commonly reduced using either ACE inhibitors (such as ramipril and perindopril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs, such as losartan, irbesartan or candesartan) rather than a direct oral renin inhibitor. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are also part of the standard treatment after a heart attack.

The [[differential diagnosis]] of [[kidney cancer]] in a young patient with hypertension includes [[juxtaglomerular cell tumor]] ([[reninoma]]), [[Wilms' tumor]], and [[renal cell carcinoma]], all of which may produce renin.<ref name="pmid19098017">{{cite journal |author=Méndez, G.

=== Measurement ===
{{See|Plasma renin activity}}
Renin is usually measured as the [[plasma renin activity]] (''PRA''). PRA is measured specially in case of certain diseases that present with [[Hypertension#Role_of_renin|hypertension]] or [[hypotension]]. PRA is also raised in certain tumors.<ref>Hamilton Regional Laboratory Medicine Program - Laboratory Reference Centre Manual. Renin Direct.</ref> A PRA measurement may be compared to a plasma [[aldosterone]] concentration (PAC) as a ''PAC/PRA ratio''.
