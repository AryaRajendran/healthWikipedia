'''Interferons''' ('''IFN'''s) are [[protein]]s made and released by [[host cells]] in response to the presence of [[pathogen]]s such as [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[parasite]]s or [[tumor]] cells. They allow for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the [[immune system]] that eradicate pathogens or tumors.

IFNs belong to the large class of [[glycoproteins]] known as [[cytokine]]s.  Interferons are named after their ability to "interfere" with [[viral replication]] within host cells. IFNs have other functions: they activate immune cells, such as [[natural killer cell]]s and [[macrophage]]s; they increase recognition of infection or tumor cells by up-regulating [[antigen presentation]] to [[T lymphocyte]]s; and they increase the ability of uninfected host cells to resist new infection by virus.  Certain symptoms, such as aching muscles and fever, are related to the production of IFNs during infection.

About ten distinct IFNs have been identified in mammals; seven of these have been described for humans.  They are typically divided among three IFN classes: Type I IFN, Type II IFN, and Type III IFN.  IFNs belonging to all IFN classes are very important for fighting viral infections.

==Types of interferon==
Based on the type of receptor through which they signal, human interferons have been classified into three major types.

* [[Interferon type I]]: All type I IFNs bind to a specific cell surface receptor complex known as the [[IFN-α]] receptor ([[Interferon-alpha/beta receptor|IFNAR]]) that consists of [[IFNAR1]] and [[IFNAR2]] chains.<ref>{{cite journal|author=de Weerd NA, Samarajiwa SA, Hertzog PJ|title=Type I interferon receptors: biochemistry and biological functions|journal=J Biol Chem|year=2007|volume=282|pages=20053–20057|pmid= 17502368|doi=10.1074/jbc.R700006200|issue=28}}</ref>  The type I interferons present in humans are [[IFN-α]], [[IFN-β]] and [[Interferon type I#IFN-ω|IFN-ω]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Liu YJ|title=IPC: professional type 1 interferon-producing cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors|journal=Annu Rev Immunol|year=2005|volume=23|pages=275–306|pmid=15771572  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.23.021704.115633}}</ref>

* [[Interferon type II]]: Binds to [[IFNGR]] that consists of [[IFNGR1]] and [[IFNGR2]] chains. In humans this is [[IFN-γ]].

* [[Interferon type III]]: Signal through a receptor complex consisting of IL10R2 (also called CRF2-4) and [[IFNLR1]] (also called CRF2-12). Acceptance of this classification is less universal than that of type I and type II, and unlike the other two, it is not currently included in [[Medical Subject Headings]].<ref>Vilcek, Novel interferons</ref>

==Function==
All interferons share several common effects; they are [[antiviral protein|antiviral]] agents and can fight [[tumor]]s.

As an infected cell dies from a [[cytolysis|cytolytic]] virus, viral particles are released that can infect nearby cells. However, the infected cell can warn neighboring cells of a viral presence by releasing interferon. The neighboring cells, in response to interferon, produce large amounts of an [[enzyme]] known as [[protein kinase R]] (PKR). This enzyme [[phosphorylation|phosphorylates]] a protein known as [[eIF-2]] in response to new viral infections; the phosphorylated eIF-2 forms an inactive complex with another protein, called [[eIF2B]], to reduce protein synthesis within the cell. Another cellular enzyme, [[RNAse L]]—also induced following PKR activation—destroys RNA within the cells to further reduce protein synthesis of both viral and host genes.  Inhibited protein synthesis destroys both the virus and infected host cells. In addition, interferons induce production of hundreds of other proteins—known collectively as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)—that have roles in combating viruses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fensterl|first=V |authorlink= |coauthors=Sen GC |year=2009 |title=Interferons and viral infections|trans_title= |journal=BioFactors |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=14–20 |pmid=19319841|url= |quote= |doi=10.1002/biof.6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=de Veer|first=MJ|authorlink= |coauthors=Holko M, Frevel M, Walker E, Der S, Paranjape JM, Silverman RH, Williams BR|year=2001 |title=Functional classification of interferon-stimulated genes identified using microarrays |trans_title= |journal= Journal of leukocyte biology|volume=69 |issue=6|pages=912–20|pmid=11404376 |url=  |quote= }}</ref>
They also limit viral spread by increasing [[p53]] activity, which kills virus-infected cells by promoting [[apoptosis]].<ref name="Takaoka">{{cite journal |author=Takaoka A, Hayakawa S, Yanai H, ''et al.'' |title=Integration of interferon-alpha/beta signalling to p53 responses in tumour suppression and antiviral defence |journal=Nature |volume=424 |issue=6948 |pages=516–23 |year=2003 |pmid=12872134 |doi=10.1038/nature01850 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6948/pdf/nature01850.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Moiseeva O, Mallette FA, Mukhopadhyay UK, Moores A, Ferbeyre G |title=DNA Damage Signaling and p53-dependent Senescence after Prolonged β-Interferon Stimulation |journal=Mol.

Another function of interferons is to upregulate major histocompatibility complex molecules, [[MHC I]] and [[MHC II]], and increase  [[immunoproteasome]] activity.  Higher MHC I expression increases presentation of viral peptides to [[cytotoxic T cell]]s and [[natural killer cells]], while the immunoproteasome processes viral peptides for loading onto the MHC I molecule, thereby increasing the recognition and killing of infected cells.  Higher MHC II expression increases presentation of viral peptides to [[helper T cell]]s; these cells release cytokines (such as more interferons and [[interleukins]], among others) that signal to and co-ordinate the activity of other immune cells.  

Interferons, such as [[interferon gamma]], directly activate other immune cells, such as [[macrophage]]s and [[natural killer cell]]s.

Interferons can inflame the tongue and cause dysfunction in taste bud cells, restructuring or killing taste buds entirely.<ref name="NIH Inflammation">{{cite journal |author=Wang H, Zhou M, Brand J, Huang L. |title=Inflammation Activates the Interferon Signaling Pathways in Taste Bud Cells |journal=Neurosci |volume=27 |issue=40 |pages=10703–10713 |year=2007 |pmid=17913904 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3102-07.2007 |pmc=2096741}}</ref>

==Induction of interferons==
Production of interferons predominantly occurs in response to microbes, such as viruses and bacteria, and their products.  Binding of molecules uniquely found in microbes—viral [[glycoprotein]]s, viral [[RNA]], bacterial [[endotoxin]] (lipopolysaccharide), bacterial [[flagella]], [[CpG ODN|CpG motifs]]—by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s, such as membrane bound [[Toll like receptor]]s or the cytoplasmic receptors [[DDX58|RIG-I]] or [[IFIH1|MDA5]], can trigger release of IFNs.
Toll Like Receptor 3 ([[TLR 3|TLR3]]) is important for inducing interferon in response to the presence of [[double-stranded RNA viruses]]; the [[ligand]] for this receptor is [[DsRNA|double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)]].  After binding  dsRNA, this receptor activates the transcription factors [[IRF3]] and [[NF-κB]], which are important for initiating synthesis of many inflammatory proteins.  [[RNA interference]] technology tools such as siRNA or vector-based reagents can either silence or stimulate interferon pathways.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=22432611}}</ref> Release of IFN from cells is also induced by [[mitogen]]s.  Other cytokines, such as [[interleukin 1]], [[interleukin 2]], [[interleukin-12]], [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|tumor necrosis factor]] and [[colony-stimulating factor]], can also enhance interferon production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haller |first=O  |authorlink= |coauthors= Kochs G, Weber F.|year=2007 |month=October-Dec |title=Interferon, Mx, and viral countermeasures |trans_title= |journal=Cytokine Growth Factor Rev.  |volume=18 |issue=5–6 |pages=425–33 |pmid=17683972 |url=  |quote= |doi=10.1016/j.cytogfr.2007.06.001 }}</ref>

==Downstream signaling==
By interacting with their specific receptors, IFNs activate ''signal transducer and activator of transcription'' ([[STAT protein|STAT]]) complexes; STATs are a family of [[transcription factor]]s that regulate the expression of certain immune system genes.  Some STATs are activated by both type I and type II IFNs.  However each IFN type can also activate unique STATs.<ref name="pmid15864272">{{Cite pmid|15864272}}<!--Formatted by http://sumsearch.uthscsa.edu/cite/--></ref>

STAT activation initiates the most well-defined cell signaling pathway for all IFNs, the classical [[Janus kinase]]-STAT ([[JAK-STAT]]) signaling pathway.<ref name="pmid15864272"/>  In this pathway, JAKs associate with IFN receptors and, following receptor engagement with IFN, [[phosphorylation|phosphorylate]] both [[STAT1]] and [[STAT2]].  As a result, an IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex forms—this contains STAT1, STAT2 and a third transcription factor called [[ISGF3G|IRF9]]—and moves into the [[cell nucleus]]. Inside the nucleus, the ISGF3 complex binds to specific [[nucleotide]] sequences called ''IFN-stimulated response elements'' (ISREs) in the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s of certain [[gene]]s, known as IFN stimulated genes [[ISGs]]. Binding of ISGF3 and other transcriptional complexes activated by IFN signaling to these specific regulatory elements induces transcription of those genes.<ref name="pmid15864272"/> A collection of known ISGs is available on [[Interferome]], a curated online database of ISGs ([http://www.interferome.org www.interferome.org]);<ref>{{cite journal |author=Samarajiwa SA, Forster S, Auchettl K, Hertzog PJ |title=INTERFEROME: the database of interferon regulated genes. |journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=37|issue= |pages=D852-7 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18996892 |doi= 10.1093/nar/gkn732}}</ref> Additionally, STAT homodimers or heterodimers form from different combinations of STAT-1, -3, -4, -5, or -6 during IFN signaling; these [[protein dimer|dimer]]s initiate gene transcription by binding to IFN-activated site (GAS) elements in gene promoters.<ref name="pmid15864272"/>  Type I IFNs can induce expression of genes with either ISRE or GAS elements, but gene induction by type II IFN can occur only in the presence of a GAS element.<ref name="pmid15864272"/>

In addition to the JAK-STAT pathway, IFNs can activate several other signaling cascades.  Both type I and type II IFNs activate a member of the CRK family of [[adaptor protein]]s called [[CRKL]], a nuclear adaptor for [[STAT5]] that also regulates signaling through the [[RAPGEF1|C3G]]/[[Rap1]] pathway.<ref name="pmid15864272"/>  Type I IFNs further activate ''[[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase]]'' (MAP kinase) to induce gene transcription.<ref name="pmid15864272"/>  Antiviral and antiproliferative effects specific to type I IFNs result from p38 MAP kinase signaling.  The ''[[phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase]]'' (PI3K) signaling pathway is also regulated by both type I and type II IFNs.  PI3K activates [[P70-S6 Kinase 1]], an enzyme that increases protein synthesis and cell proliferation; phosphorylates of [[ribosomal protein s6]], which is involved in protein synthesis; and phosphorylates a translational repressor protein called ''eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1'' ([[EIF4EBP1]]) in order to deactivate it.<ref name="pmid15864272"/>

==Interferon therapy==
[[Image:Vials of Interferon Image 3549-PH.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Three vials filled with human leukocyte interferon]]

===Diseases===
The immune effects of interferons have been exploited to treat several diseases.  Agents that activate the immune system, such as small [[imidazoquinoline]] molecules that activate [[TLR7]], can induce IFN-α.  Imidazoquinoline is the main ingredient of Aldara (Imiquimod) cream, a treatment approved in the United States by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for [[actinic keratosis]], superficial [[basal cell carcinoma]], [[papilloma]] and external [[genital warts]].<ref name="pmid2458171">{{Cite pmid|2458171}}<!--Formatted by http://sumsearch.uthscsa.edu/cite/--></ref> Synthetic IFNs are also made, and administered as antiviral, [[antiseptic]] and [[anticarcinogen]]ic drugs, and to treat some autoimmune diseases.

New research has shown that imiquimod's anti-proliferative effect is totally independent of immune system activation or function. Imiquimod exerts its effect by increasing levels of the [[opioid growth factor receptor]] (OGFr). Blocking OGFr function with [[siRNA]] technology resulted in loss of any antiproliferative effect of imiquimod.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zagon IS, Donahue RN, Rogosnitzky M, McLaughlin PJ |title=Imiquimod upregulates the opioid growth factor receptor to inhibit cell proliferation independent of immune function |journal=Exp.

In January 2001, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the use of [[PEGylated]] interferon-alpha in the USA; in this formulation, [[polyethylene glycol]] is added to make the interferon last longer in the body.  Initially used for production of [[Peginterferon alfa-2b|PEGylated interferon-alpha-2b]] (''Pegintron''), approval for [[Peginterferon alfa-2a|PEGylated interferon-alpha-2a]] (''Pegasys'') followed in October 2002.  These PEGylated drugs are injected once weekly, rather than administering three times per week, as is necessary for conventional interferon-alpha. When used with the [[antiviral drug]] [[ribavirin]], PEGylated interferon is effective in treatment of [[hepatitis C]]; at least 75% people with hepatitis C genotypes 2 or 3 benefit from interferon treatment, although this is effective in less than 50% of people infected with genotype 1 (the more common form of hepatitis C virus in both the U.S. and Western Europe).<ref name="pmid19034963">{{cite journal |author=Jamall IS, Yusuf S, Azhar M, Jamall S |title=Is pegylated interferon superior to interferon, with ribavarin, in chronic hepatitis C genotypes 2/3? |journal=World J.

==History==
During research to produce a more efficient [[vaccine]] for [[smallpox]], Yasu-ichi Nagano and Yasuhiko Kojima—two Japanese [[virology|virologists]] working at the Institute for Infectious Diseases at the [[University of Tokyo]]—noticed inhibition of viral growth in an area of rabbit-skin or testis previously [[inoculate]]d with UV-inactivated virus.  They hypothesised that some "viral inhibitory factor" was present in the tissues infected with virus and attempted to isolate and characterize this factor from tissue [[Homogenization (biology)|homogenate]]s. In 1954, these findings were published in a French journal now known as the ''Journal de la Société de Biologie''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nagano Y, Kojima Y |title=Pouvoir immunisant du virus vaccinal inactivé par des rayons ultraviolets |language=French |journal=C.

Meanwhile, the British virologist [[Alick Isaacs]] and the Swiss researcher Jean Lindenmann, at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] in London, noticed an interference effect caused by heat-inactivated [[influenza virus]] on the growth of live influenza virus in chicken egg [[chorioallantoic membrane]].

Interferon was scarce and expensive until 1980, when the interferon [[gene]] was inserted into [[bacterium|bacteria]] using [[recombinant DNA technology]], allowing mass cultivation and purification from [[Microbiological culture#Bacterial culture|bacterial cultures]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nagata S, Taira H, Hall A, ''et al.'' |title=Synthesis in E. coli of a polypeptide with human leukocyte interferon activity |journal=Nature |volume=284 |issue=5754 |pages=316–20 |year=1980 |month=March |pmid=6987533 |doi=10.1038/284316a0 |url=|bibcode = 1980Natur.284..316N }}</ref> or derived from [[yeast]] (e.g. Reiferon Retard is the first yeast derived interferon-alpha 2a) Interferon can also be derived from recombinant mammalian cells.<ref>Tan Y.H. and Hong W.J. Gene expression in mammalian cells. US patent 6207146, 2001</ref>
Before this, in the early 1970s the large scale reproduction of human interferon was pioneered by Kari Cantell. He produced large amounts of human alpha interferon from massive quantities of human white blood cells collected from and by the Finnish Blood Bank.<ref>Cantell, K. The Story of Interferon, 1998</ref> Large amounts of human beta interferon were made by superinducing the beta interferon gene in human fibroblast cells, a procedure Chris Y.H.Tan discovered with Monto Ho.<ref>Tan, Y.H., Armstrong, J.A., Ke, Y.H. and Ho, M.

US patent 3773924, 1973</ref> Cantell's and Tan's  methods of making large amounts of natural interferons were critical to make purified interferons for their chemical characterisation,for their clinical trials and for the preparations of the scarce amount of interferon messenger RNAs to the clone the human alpha and beta interferon genes. The superinduced human beta interferon messenger RNA was prepared by Tan's lab for Cetus corp. to clone the human beta interferon gene into bacteria and the recombinant interferon was developed as 'betaseron' and approved for the treatment of MS. Superinduction of the human beta interferon gene was also used by Israeli scientists to manufacture human beta interferon, used as a topical anti-herpes agent.
