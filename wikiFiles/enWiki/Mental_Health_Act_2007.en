'''The Mental Act 2007''' (c 12) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It amends the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] and the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. It applies to people in [[England]] and [[Wales]].<ref>In [[Scotland]], these matters are covered by the [[Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003]]. In [[Northern Ireland]], by Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, which has been amended by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2004/20041272.htm The Mental Health (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004.]</ref> Most of the Act was implemented on 3 November 2008.<ref name="dh">[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/NationalServiceFrameworks/Mentalhealth/DH_089882 Mental Health Act 2007: key documents] from Department of Health website. accessed 14 November 2008</ref>

It introduces significant changes which include:

* Introduction of [[Supervised Community Treatment]], including Community Treatment Orders (CTOs). This new power replaces supervised discharge with a power to return the patient to hospital, where the person may be forcibly medicated, if the medication regime is not being complied with in the community. 
* Redefining professional roles: broadening the range of [[mental health professionals]] who can be responsible for the treatment of patients without their consent.
* Nearest relative: making it possible for some patients to appoint a civil partner as nearest relative.
* Definition of mental disorder: introduce a new definition of [[mental disorder]] throughout the Act, abolishing previous categories
* Criteria for [[Involuntary commitment]]: introduce a requirement that someone cannot be detained for treatment unless ''appropriate treatment'' is available and remove the ''treatability'' test.
* [[Mental Health Review Tribunal]] (MHRT): improve patient safeguards by taking an order-making power which will allow the current time limit to be varied and for automatic referral by hospital managers to the MHRT.
* Introduction of independent mental health [[advocacy|advocates]] (IMHAs) for 'qualifying patients'.
* [[Electroconvulsive Therapy]] may not be given to a patient who has capacity to refuse consent to it, and may only be given to an incapacitated patient where it does not conflict with any advance directive, decision of a donee or deputy or decision of the Court of Protection.<ref name="dh"/><ref>[http://www.uk-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/ukpga_20070012_en.pdf Mental Health Act 2007] Accessed November 14 2008</ref>

==Controversy==

{{see also|Mental_Health_Act_1983#Amendments_and_refinements}}

During the Act's development, there were concerns expressed that the changes proposed by the Mental Health Bill were draconian. As a result, the government was forced in 2006 to abandon their original plans to introduce the Bill outright and had to amend the 1983 Act instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4835484.stm|title=Mental Health Bill 'to be axed'|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-12-15 | date=2006-03-23}}</ref> Despite this concession, the Bill was still defeated a number of times in the [[House of Lords]] prior to its receiving Royal Assent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6374547.stm|title=Ministers lose mental health vote|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-12-15 | date=2007-02-19}}</ref>
