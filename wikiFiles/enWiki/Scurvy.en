'''Scurvy''' is a disease resulting from a deficiency of [[vitamin C]], which is required for the synthesis of [[collagen]] in humans. The chemical name for vitamin C, ascorbic acid, is derived from the Latin name of scurvy, ''scorbutus'', which also provides the adjective '''scorbutic''' ("of, characterized by or having to do with scurvy"). Scurvy often presents itself initially as symptoms of malaise and lethargy, followed by formation of spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from the [[mucous membrane]]s. Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. As scurvy advances, there can be open, [[suppuration|suppurating]] wounds, loss of teeth, jaundice, fever, neuropathy and death.

Scurvy was at one time common among [[sailor]]s, [[pirate]]s and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored (subsisting instead only on [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] and [[salted meat]]s and dried [[grain]]s) and by soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods. It was described by [[Hippocrates]] (c. 460 BC–c. 380 BC), and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory. Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel, often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages  {{cn|date=December 2012}}. This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the modern era in the [[Age of Discovery]] in the 15th century, continuing to play a significant role through World War I in the 20th century.

While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency, until the isolation of vitamin C and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932, numerous theories and treatments were proposed, often on little or no experimental data. This inconsistency is attributed {{Whom|date=December 2012}} to the lack of vitamin C as a distinct concept, an inability to reliably link different foods (notably present in fresh citrus, watercress, and organ meat) to scurvy. An additional concept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin C by exposure to air and copper and other [[transition metal]] salts such as those of iron, thus changing the links of foods to scurvy over time.

Treatment by fresh food, particularly citrus fruit, was periodically implemented, as it had been since antiquity. However until the 1930s, treatment was inconsistent, with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century. It was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] surgeon in the [[Royal Navy]], [[James Lind (physician)|James Lind]] who first proved it could be treated with [[citrus fruit]] in experiments he described in his 1753 book, ''A Treatise of the Scurvy,''<ref name="lind_james">{{cite book|author=Lind, James|title=A Treatise on the Scurvy|publisher=A. Millar|location=London|year=1753}}</ref> though his advice was not implemented by the Royal Navy for several decades {{When|date=December 2012}}.

In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as '''Barlow's disease,''' named after Sir [[Thomas Barlow (medicine)|Thomas Barlow]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Evans PR |title=Infantile scurvy: the centenary of Barlow's disease |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=287 |issue=6408 |pages=1862–3 |year=1983 |month=December |pmid=6423046 |pmc=1550031 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.287.6408.1862|url= |ref=harv}}</ref> a British [[physician]] who described it.<ref>{{cite book | title=The History of Scurvy and Vitamin C | first=Kenneth J. | last=Carpenter | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1988 | isbn=0-521-34773-4 | page=172 }}</ref> However, Barlow's disease may also refer to [[mitral valve prolapse]]. Other eponyms for scurvy include '''Moeller's disease''' and '''Cheadle's disease'''.

Scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin C. However, humans and other higher primates (the [[simian]]s - monkeys and apes - and [[tarsier]]s), guinea pigs, most or all bats, and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme ([[L-gulonolactone oxidase]]) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet. Vitamin C is widespread in plant tissues, with particularly high concentrations occurring in citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits), tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages, and green peppers.

== Cause ==
Scurvy or subclinical scurvy is caused by the lack of vitamin C. In modern Western societies, scurvy is rarely present in adults, although infants and elderly people are affected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hampl JS, Taylor CA, Johnston CS |title=Vitamin C deficiency and depletion in the United States: the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988 to 1994 |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=870–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15117714 |pmc=1448351 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.94.5.870|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/full/94/5/870 |ref=harv}}</ref> Vitamin C is destroyed by the process of [[pasteurization]], so babies fed with ordinary bottled milk sometimes suffer from scurvy if they are not provided with adequate vitamin supplements. Virtually all commercially available baby formulas contain added vitamin C for this reason, but heat and storage destroy vitamin C. Human [[breast milk]] contains sufficient vitamin C, if the mother has an adequate intake.

Scurvy is one of the accompanying diseases of [[malnutrition]] (other such micronutrient deficiencies are [[beriberi]] or [[pellagra]]) and thus is still widespread in areas of the world depending on external food aid.<ref>{{cite journal | author=WHO | title= Area of work: nutrition.

== Pathogenesis ==
[[Ascorbic acid]] is needed for a variety of biosynthetic pathways, by accelerating [[hydroxylation]] and [[amidation]] reactions. In the synthesis of [[collagen]], ascorbic acid is required as a cofactor for [[prolyl hydroxylase]] and [[lysyl hydroxylase]]. These two enzymes are responsible for the hydroxylation of the [[proline]] and [[lysine]] amino acids in collagen. [[Hydroxyproline]] and [[hydroxylysine]] are important for stabilizing collagen by cross-linking the propeptides in collagen. Defective collagen fibrillogenesis impairs wound healing. Collagen is also an important part of bone, so bone formation is also affected. Defective connective tissue also leads to fragile capillaries, resulting in abnormal bleeding.

== Symptoms ==
Early symptoms are [[malaise]] and [[lethargy]]. After 1–3 months, patients develop shortness of breath and bone pain. [[Myalgia]]s may occur because of reduced [[carnitine]] production. Other symptoms include skin changes with roughness, easy bruising and [[petechiae]], [[gum disease]], loosening of teeth, poor wound healing, and emotional changes. Dry mouth and dry eyes similar to [[Sjögren's syndrome]] may occur. In the late stages, [[jaundice]], generalized [[edema]], oliguria, [[neuropathy]], fever, convulsions, and eventual death are frequently seen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lynne Goebel, MD |title=Scurvy Clinical Presentation |journal=Medscape Reference |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/125350-clinical |ref=harv}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
Scurvy can be prevented by a diet that includes certain citrus fruits such as [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] or [[lemons]]. Other sources rich in [[vitamin C]] are fruits such as [[blackcurrants]], [[guava]], [[kiwifruit]], [[papaya]], [[tomatoes]], [[bell peppers]], and [[strawberries]]. It can also be found in some vegetables, such as [[carrots]], [[broccoli]], [[potatoes]], [[cabbage]], [[spinach]] and [[paprika]]. Some fruits and vegetables not high in vitamin C may be [[pickled]] in [[lemon juice]], which is high in vitamin C. Though redundant in the presence of a balanced diet,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rivers JM |title=Safety of high-level vitamin C ingestion |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=498 |issue= 1 Third Confere|pages=445–54 |year=1987 |pmid=3304071 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb23780.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb23780.x |ref=harv}}</ref> various nutritional supplements are available that provide ascorbic acid well in excess of that required to prevent scurvy, and even some [[candy|candies]] and most [[soft drink]]s contain vitamin C as a preservative.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Many animal products, including [[liver]], [[Muktuk]] (whale skin), [[oysters]], and parts of the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and [[adrenal medulla]], contain large amounts of vitamin C, and can even be used to treat scurvy. 

Fresh meat from animals which make their own vitamin C (which most animals do) contains enough vitamin C to prevent scurvy, and even partly treat it. This caused confusion in the early history of scurvy, since the disease was only seen in people eating long-preserved diets or canned goods, but not in people eating any sort of fresh diet, including arctic diets primarily based upon meat. In some cases (notably in French soldiers eating fresh horse meat) it was discovered that meat alone, even partly cooked meat, could alleviate scurvy. In other cases, a meat only diet could cause scurvy.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dubai boy, 4, suffers scurvy after meat-only diet |author= Martin Croucher|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/health/dubai-boy-4-suffers-scurvy-after-meat-only-diet |newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date=September 19, 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2012}}</ref> Some of these observations that scurvy was only associated with preserved foods prompted explorers to blame scurvy upon some type of tainting or poison which pervaded tinned foods.

==Treatment==
Scurvy can be treated by eating [[Vitamin_C#Dietary_sources|food containing vitamin C]] (such as oranges, papaya, strawberries, lemon), tablets with vitamin C, etc.

== Prognosis ==
Untreated scurvy is invariably fatal. However, death from scurvy is rare in modern times. Since all that is required for a full recovery is the resumption of normal vitamin C intake, it is easy to treat if identified correctly. Consumption of dietary supplements and/or citrus fruits are means by which to accomplish this.

== History ==
Herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Scurvy was documented as a disease by [[Hippocrates]],<ref>Hippocrates described symptoms of scurvy in book 2 of his ''Prorrheticorum'' and in his ''Liber de internis affectionibus''.

=== Early modern era ===
In the 13th century, the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] frequently suffered from scurvy. In the 1497 expedition of [[Vasco de Gama]], the curative effects of citrus fruit were known.<ref name="ceg" /> In 1536, the French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], exploring the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], used the local natives' knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy. He boiled the needles of the [[Thuja|arbor vitae]] tree (Eastern White Cedar) to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50&nbsp;mg of vitamin C per 100&nbsp;grams.<ref>[http://www3.sympatico.ca/goweezer/canada/z00cartier3.htm Jacques Cartier's Second Voyage], 1535 Winter & Scurvy.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Martini E |title=Jacques Cartier witnesses a treatment for scurvy |journal=Vesalius |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=2–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12422875 |doi= |url= |ref=harv}}</ref> Such treatments were not available aboard ship, where the disease was most common.

Between 1500 and 1800, it has been estimated that scurvy killed at least two million [[sailor]]s.<ref>{{Cite book

In 1593 Admiral Sir [[Richard Hawkins]] advocated drinking orange and lemon juice as a means of preventing scurvy.<ref>Kerr, Gordon (2009). Timeline of Britain, Canary press.</ref>

The British civilian medical profession of 1614 believed that it was the acidic principle of citrus fruit which was lacking, although they considered any acid acceptable when ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) was unavailable. In 1614 [[John Woodall]], Surgeon General of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], published "The Surgion's Mate" as a handbook for apprentice surgeons aboard the company's ships. In it he described scurvy as resulting from a dietary deficiency. His recommendation for its cure was fresh food or, if not available, oranges, lemons, limes and tamarinds, or as a last resort, Oil of Vitriol ([[sulfuric acid]]).<ref name="bown">Bown, Stephen R. "''SCURVY: How a Surgeon, a Mariner and a Gentleman Solved the Greatest Medical Mystery of the Age of Sail''", Viking 2003.</ref>

=== 18th century ===
A 1707 handwritten book by Mrs Ebot Mitchell discovered in a house in Hasfield, [[Gloucestershire]] contains a "Recp.t for the Scurvy" that consisted of extracts from various plants mixed with a plentiful supply of orange juice, white wine or beer.<ref>''Telegraph'' newspaper, 5 March 2009, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4943570/Cure-for-scurvy-discovered-by-a-woman.html</ref>
[[Image:JamesLind.jpg|James Lind 1716-1794|thumb|270px|James Lind, a pioneer in the field of scurvy prevention]]
In 1734, the [[Leiden]]-based physician [[Johann Bachstrom]] published a book on scurvy in which he stated that "scurvy is solely owing to a total abstinence from fresh vegetable food, and greens; which is alone the primary cause of the disease" and urged the use of fresh fruit and vegetables as a cure. In 1740, citrus juice (usually [[lemon]] or [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]] juice) was added to the recipe of the traditional daily [[ration]] of watered-down [[rum]] known as [[grog]] to cut down on the water's foulness. Although they did not know the reason at the time, Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s sailors were healthier than the rest of the navy, due to the daily doses of [[vitamin C]] the sailors received.<ref>''"The Blood of Nelson"'' by Glenn Barnett&nbsp;— Military History&nbsp;— Oct 2006.</ref> However, it was not until 1747 that [[James Lind (physician)|James Lind]] formally proved that scurvy could be treated and prevented by supplementing the diet with citrus fruit such as limes or lemons, though not by other acids, in the first ever [[clinical trial]].<ref name="lind_james" /> In 1753, Lind published ''A Treatise of the Scurvy'', in which he explained the details of his clinical trial and how scurvy was successfully eradicated from his test subjects (nuns). He then attempted to sell extracted lime juice as a medicine, but the lime juice had no effect in treating scurvy, due to the oxidization of vitamin C. Therefore, this solution was not adopted by the Royal Navy until the 1790s, and the idea that any acid would suffice continued in Britain into the late 19th century.

During the 18th century, scurvy killed more British sailors than enemy action. It was mainly by scurvy that [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]], in his celebrated voyage of 1740–2, lost within the first ten months nearly two-thirds of his crew (1300 out of 2000).<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/captaincook_scurvy_01.shtml Captain Cook and the Scourge of Scurvy]". BBC – History.</ref> During the [[Seven Years' War]], the Royal Navy reported that it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 died of disease or were "missing", and scurvy was the principal disease.<ref>A. S. Turberville (2006). "''Johnson's England: An Account of the Life & Manners of His Age''". ISBN READ BOOKS. p.53. ISBN 1-4067-2726-1</ref>

[[James Cook]] succeeded in circumnavigating the world (1768–71) in [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] without losing a single man to scurvy, but his suggested methods, including a diet of [[sauerkraut]] and [[wort]] of malt, were of limited value. Sauerkraut was the only vegetable food that retained a reasonable amount of ascorbic acid in a pickled state, but it was boiled to reduce it for preservation and much of the vitamin C content was lost. In Cook's time it was impractical to preserve citrus fruit for long sea voyages. More important was Cook's regime of shipboard cleanliness, enforced by strict discipline, as well as frequent replenishment of fresh food.<ref>{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= W.W. Norton & Company |page= 297 |isbn= 0-393-06259-7}}</ref> The most effective regime implemented by Cook was his prohibition against the consumption of fat scrubbed from the ship's copper pans, then a common practice in the Navy. In contact with air the copper formed compounds that catalytically oxidised the vitamin C, destroying any antiscorbutic activity.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/captaincook_scurvy_04.shtml BBC  — History — Captain Cook and the Scourge of Scurvy<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>

The first major long distance expedition that experienced virtually no scurvy was that of [[Alessandro Malaspina]], 1789–1794. Malaspina's medical officer, Pedro González, was convinced that fresh oranges and lemons were essential for preventing scurvy. Only one outbreak occurred, during a 56-day trip across the open sea. Five sailors came down with symptoms, one seriously. After three days at [[Guam]] all five were healthy again. [[Spanish Empire|Spain's large empire]] and many ports of call made it easier to acquire fresh fruit.<ref>{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= W.W. Norton & Company |pages= 297–298 |isbn= 0-393-06259-7}}</ref>

Despite advances, British sailors throughout the [[American Revolution]]ary period continued to suffer from scurvy, particularly in the Channel Fleet. The eradication of scurvy from the Royal Navy in the 1790s was finally due to the chairman of the Navy's [[Sick and Hurt Board]], [[Gilbert Blane]], who finally put Bachstrom and Lind's long-ignored prescription of fresh lemons to use during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It led to a remarkable health improvement among the sailors and consequently played a critical role in naval battles, notably the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Other navies soon adopted this successful solution.<ref name="bown" />

=== 19th century ===
[[File:A case of Scurvy journal of Henry Walsh Mahon.jpg|left|thumb|Page from the journal of Henry Walsh Mahon showing the effects of scurvy, from his time aboard HM Convict Ship Barrosa. 1841/2]]
The surgeon-in-chief of [[Napoleon]]'s army at the [[Siege of Alexandria (1801)]], Baron [[Dominique-Jean Larrey]], wrote in his memoirs that the consumption of [[horse meat]] helped the French to curb an epidemic of scurvy. The meat was cooked but was freshly obtained from young horses bought from Arabs, and was nevertheless effective. This helped to start the 19th-century tradition of horse meat consumption in France.<ref>Larrey is quoted in French by Dr. [[Béraud]], ''[http://leslivresoublies.free.fr/leslivresoublies/Sciences_et_techniques_muse/cheval.html Études Hygiéniques de la chair de cheval comme aliment]'', [[Musée des Familles]] (1841-42).</ref>

Lauchlin Rose patented a method used to preserve citrus juice without alcohol in 1867, creating a [[squash (drink)|concentrated drink]] known as [[Rose's lime juice]]. The [[Merchant Shipping Act (1867)|Merchant Shipping Act]] of that same year required all ships of the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Merchant Navy]] to provide a daily [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] ration to sailors to prevent scurvy. The product became nearly ubiquitous, hence the term "[[limey]]", first for British sailors, then an English immigrant in the former British colonies (particularly America, New Zealand and South Africa), and finally, in old American slang, all British people.<ref>Simpson, J and Weiner, E: "The Oxford English Dictionary", Oxford University Press, 1989.</ref>

The plant ''[[Cochlearia officinalis]]'', also known as "Common Scurvygrass", acquired its common name from the observation that it cured scurvy, and it was taken on board ships in dried bundles or distilled extracts. Its very bitter taste was usually disguised with herbs and spices; however, this did not prevent scurvygrass drinks and sandwiches becoming a popular fad in the UK until the middle of the nineteenth century, when citrus fruits became more readily available.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mabey |first=Richard|title=Food for free |publisher=Collins |year=1972 |pages=93, 94 |isbn=978-0-00-724768-4}}</ref>

West Indian limes replaced lemons because they were more easily obtained from Britain's Caribbean colonies,<ref name="ceg" /> and were believed to be more effective because they were more acidic, and it was the acid, not the (then-unknown) Vitamin C that was believed to cure scurvy. This was mistaken – the West Indian limes were significantly lower in Vitamin C than the previous lemons (having only ¼ the Vitamin C content), and further were not served fresh, but rather as lime juice, which had been exposed to light and air and piped through copper tubing, all of which significantly reduced the Vitamin C. Indeed, a 1918 animal experiment using representative samples of the Navy and Merchant Marine's lime juice showed that it had virtually no antiscorbutic power at all.<ref name="ceg" />

The belief that scurvy was fundamentally a nutritional deficiency, best treated by consumption of fresh food, particularly fresh citrus or fresh meat, was not universal in Britain in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and thus British sailors and explorers continued to suffer from scurvy into the 20th century.

In the Royal Navy's [[Arctic]] expeditions in the 19th century it was widely believed that scurvy was prevented by good hygiene on board ship, regular exercise, and maintaining the morale of the crew, rather than by a diet of fresh food, so that Navy expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy even while fresh (not jerked or tinned) meat was well known as a practical antiscorbutic among civilian whalers and explorers in the Arctic. Even cooking fresh meat did not entirely destroy its antiscorbutic properties, especially as many cooking methods failed to bring all the meat to high temperature.

The confusion is attributed to a number of factors:<ref name="ceg"/>
* while ''fresh'' citrus (particularly lemons) cured scurvy, lime ''juice'' that had been exposed to light, air and copper tubing did not – thus undermining the theory that citrus cured scurvy;
* fresh meat (especially organ meat and raw meat, consumed in arctic exploration) also cured scurvy, undermining the theory that fresh produce was essential to preventing and curing scurvy;
* increased marine speed via steam shipping, and improved nutrition on land, reduced the incidence of scurvy – and thus the ineffectiveness of copper-piped lime juice compared to fresh lemons was not immediately revealed.
In the resulting confusion, a new hypothesis was floated, following the new germ theory of disease – that scurvy was caused by ptomaine, a waste product of bacteria, particularly in tainted tinned meat.

Infantile scurvy emerged in the late 19th century due to children being fed pasteurized cow's milk, particularly in the urban upper class – the pasteurization killed bacteria, but also destroyed vitamin C. This was eventually resolved by supplementing with onion juice or cooked potatoes.

=== 20th century ===
At the time [[Robert Falcon Scott]] made his two expeditions (1903 and 1911) to the [[Antarctic]] in the early 20th century, the prevailing theory was that scurvy was caused by "tainted" meat, particularly tinned meat.<ref name="R F Scott">Scott, Robert F."''The Voyage of the Discovery''", John Murray, London, 1929.</ref> Accordingly, Scott's expeditions suffered from scurvy, though he initially did not record this in his notes on his 1903 expedition, due to stigma associated with the disease.<ref name="ceg"/>

[[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]], an arctic explorer who lived among the Eskimos, proved that the all meat diet they consumed did not lead to vitamin deficiencies. He participated in a study in New York's [[Bellevue Hospital]] in 1935, where he and a companion ate only meat for a year while under close medical observation, yet remained in good health.<ref>[http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson3.htm Stefansson 3 - Eskimos Prove An All Meat Diet Provides Excellent Health<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some Antarctic expeditions, such as Scott's two expeditions and Shackleton's [[Ross Sea]] party, suffered from scurvy, mainly during inland sledge journeys when the men had access to a very limited range of food, virtually none of it fresh.

In 1907, the needed biological-assay model to isolate and identify the antiscorbutic factor was discovered. [[Axel Holst]] and [[Theodor Frølich]], two [[Norway|Norwegian]] physicians studying shipboard [[beriberi]] contracted aboard ship's crews in the Norwegian Fishing Fleet, wanted a small test mammal to substitute for the [[pigeon]]s then used in beriberi research. They fed [[guinea pig]]s their test diet of grains and flour, which had earlier produced beriberi in their pigeons, and were surprised when classic scurvy resulted instead. This was a serendipitous choice of model. Until that time, scurvy had not been observed in any organism apart from humans, and had been considered an exclusively human disease. (Some birds are susceptible to scurvy, but pigeons, as seed-eating birds, were later found to be unsusceptible to scurvy, as they produce vitamin C.) Holst and Frølich found they could cure scurvy in guinea pigs with the addition of various fresh foods and extracts. This discovery of a "clean" (reliable) animal experimental model for scurvy, which was made even before the essential idea of "vitamins" in foods had been put forward, has been called the single most important piece of vitamin C research.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12555613 | volume=122 | issue=17 | title=[Axel Holst and Theodor Frolich--pioneers in the combat of scurvy] | year=2002 | month=June | author=Norum KR, Grav HJ | journal=Tidsskr.

In 1927, [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[biochemist]] [[Szent-Györgyi]] (who won the 1937 [[Nobel Prize]] for Medicine) for his studies in the biological functions of the compound "[[hexuronic acid]]" while working with [[antioxidant]] compounds in the [[adrenal cortex]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/articles/carpenter/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize and the Discovery of Vitamins |accessdate=2008-01-25 |author=Carpenter, Kenneth J. |date=2004-06-22 |work=http://www.nobelprize.org |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}</ref> Szent-Györgyi suspected hexuronic acid, which he had isolated from adrenal glands, to be the antiscorbutic agent, but could not prove it without an animal-deficiency model.

It was not until 1932 that the connection between hexuronic acid and scurvy was finally proven by American researcher [[Charles Glen King]] of the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/WG/Views/Exhibit/narrative/szeged.html |title=The Albert Szent-Gyorgyi Papers Szeged, 1931-1947: Vitamin C, Muscles, and WWII |accessdate=2008-01-25 |work=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine }}</ref> King's laboratory was given some hexuronic acid by Szent-Györgyi and soon established that it was "vitamin C". In honor of its antiscorbutic properties, hexuronic acid was named "ascorbic acid" by Szent-Györgyi.

====Experimental human trials====
Notable human dietary studies of experimentally induced scurvy have been conducted on conscientious objectors during WWII in Britain, and on Iowa state prisoner "volunteers" in the late 1960s. These studies both found that all obvious symptoms of scurvy previously induced by an experimental scorbutic diet with extremely low vitamin C content could be completely reversed by additional vitamin C supplementation of only 10&nbsp;mg a day. In these experiments, no clinical difference was noted between men given 70&nbsp;mg vitamin C per day (which produced blood levels of vitamin C of about 0.55&nbsp;mg/dl, about 1/3 of tissue saturation levels), and those given 10&nbsp;mg per day (which produced lower blood levels). Men in the prison study developed the first signs of scurvy about 4 weeks after starting the vitamin C-free diet, whereas in the British study, six to eight months were required, possibly due to the pre-loading of this group with a 70&nbsp;mg/day supplement for six weeks before the scorbutic diet was fed.<ref>J Pemberton.

== In other animals ==
Almost all plant and animal species synthesize vitamin C. Notable mammalian exceptions include most or all of the order [[Chiroptera]] (bats), and one of the two major [[primate]] suborders, the "Anthropoidea" ([[Haplorrhini]]) which include tarsiers, monkeys, and apes, including human beings. The [[Strepsirrhini]] (non-tarsier prosimians) can make their own vitamin C, and these include [[lemur]]s, [[lorises]], [[potto]]s, and [[galago]]s. Ascorbic acid is also not synthesized by at least two species of [[Caviidae]], the [[capybara]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cueto GR, Allekotte R, Kravetz FO |title=[Scurvy in capybaras bred in captivity in Argentine.] |journal=J Wildl Dis. |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=97–101 |year=2000 |pmid=10682750 |doi= |url=http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/36/1/97 |ref=}}</ref> and the [[guinea pig]]. There are known species of birds and fish that do not synthesize their own Vitamin C. All species that do not synthesize ascorbate require it in the diet. Deficiency causes scurvy in humans, and somewhat similar symptoms in other animals.<ref name=UKFSA>{{cite web |url=http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthydiet/nutritionessentials/vitaminsandminerals/vitaminc/ |title=Vitamin C |accessdate=2007-02-19 |publisher=Food Standards Agency (UK) }}</ref><ref name=UMM>{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/ency/article//002404.htm |title=Vitamin C |accessdate=2008-03-31 |month=January | year=2007 |author= |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center }}</ref><ref name=OSU>{{cite web |url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminC/|title=Vitamin C |accessdate=2007-03-07 |date=2006-01-31 |first=Jane, Ph.D. |last= Higdon |publisher=Oregon State University, Micronutrient Information Center}}</ref>
