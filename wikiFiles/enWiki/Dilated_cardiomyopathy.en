'''Dilated cardiomyopathy''' or '''DCM''' is a condition in which the [[heart]] becomes weakened and enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. The decreased heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems.

DCM is one of the [[cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathies]], a group of diseases that primarily affect the [[myocardium]] (the [[muscle]] of the [[heart]]). Different cardiomyopathies have different causes and affect the heart in different ways. In DCM a portion of the myocardium is dilated, often without any obvious cause. Left or right ventricular [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] pump function of the heart is impaired, leading to progressive cardiac enlargement and [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]], a process called ''remodeling''.<ref name=Harrisons>{{cite book |author=Jameson JN, Kasper DL, Harrison TR, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL. |title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division |location=New York |year=2005 |edition=16th |isbn=0-07-140235-7 |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0071402357/information_center_view0/}}</ref>

Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of non-[[Ischemia|ischemic]] cardiomyopathy. It occurs more frequently in men than in women, and is most common between the ages of 20 and 60 years.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robbins SL, Kumar V, Cotran RS |title=Robbins basic pathology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |isbn=0-7216-9274-5 |edition=7th}}</ref> About one in three cases of [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF) is due to dilated cardiomyopathy.<ref name=Harrisons/> Dilated cardiomyopathy also occurs in children.

==Causes==
Although in many cases no cause ([[etiology]]) is apparent, dilated cardiomyopathy is probably the result of damage to the [[myocardium]] produced by a variety of [[toxic]], [[metabolic]], or [[Infection|infectious]] agents. It may be due to fibrous change of the myocardium from a previous [[myocardial infarction]]. Or, it may be the late sequelae of acute [[Virus|viral]] [[myocarditis]], such as with [[Coxsackie B virus]] and other [[enterovirus]]es,<ref name=Robbins8th>{{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |edition=8th}}</ref> possibly mediated through an immunologic mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martino TA, Liu P, Sole MJ |title=Viral infection and the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy |journal=Circ Res. |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=182–8 |year=1994 |month=February |pmid=8293557 }}</ref> [[Autoimmune]] mechanisms are also suggested as a cause for dilated cardiomyopathy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=San Martín MA, García A, Rodríguez FJ, Terol I |title=[Dilated cardiomyopathy and autoimmunity: an overview of current knowledge and perspectives] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Rev Esp Cardiol. |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=514–24 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12015932 |url=http://www.revespcardiol.org/cgi-bin/wdbcgi.exe/cardio/mrevista_cardio.pubmed_full?inctrl=05ZI0113&vol=55&num=5&pag=514}}</ref>

It is important to take geography into account when considering aetiologies of any condition. In Latin America, [[Chagas disease]] due to [[Trypanosoma cruzi]] is the most common infectious cause of dilated cardiomyopathy<ref name="test">http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/cardiovascular_disorders/cardiomyopathies/dilated_cardiomyopathy.html</ref>

Dilated cardiomyopathy can also be caused by [[alcohol]] abuse ([[Alcoholic cardiomyopathy]]), or other toxic exposure, although the cause-and-effect relationship with alcohol alone is debated.<ref name=Robbins8th/> Nonalcoholic toxic insults include administration of certain [[chemotherapeutic agent]]s, particularly [[doxorubicin]] (Adriamycin), and [[cobalt]].<ref name=Robbins8th/>

Other potential causes include [[thyroid disease]], [[stimulant]] use, and [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] uncontrolled [[tachycardia]]. Many cases of dilated cardiomyopathy are described as ''idiopathic'' — meaning that the cause is unknown.

Recent studies have shown that those subjects who have an extremely high occurrence (several thousands a day) of [[premature ventricular contractions]] (extrasystole) can develop dilated cardiomyopathy. In these cases, if the extrasystole are reduced or removed (for example, via ablation therapy) the cardiomyopathy usually regresses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Belhassen B |title=Radiofrequency ablation of "benign" right ventricular outflow tract extrasystoles: a therapy that has found its disease? |journal=J.

Dilated cardiomyopathy also occurs more frequently in [[pregnancy]] than in the normal population. It occurs late in gestation or several weeks to months postpartum as a [[peripartum cardiomyopathy]].<ref name=Robbins8th/> It is reversible in half of cases.<ref name=Robbins8th/>

===Genetics===
About 25–35% of patients have familial forms of the disease,<ref name=Robbins8th/> with most [[mutation]]s affecting genes encoding [[cytoskeletal]] proteins,<ref name=Robbins8th/> while some affect other proteins involved in contraction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ross J |title=Dilated cardiomyopathy: concepts derived from gene deficient and transgenic animal models |journal=Circ J. |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=219–24 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11922267 |url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/circj/66.219?from=PubMed |doi=10.1253/circj.66.219 }}</ref> The disease is genetically heterogeneous, but the most common form of its transmission is an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern.<ref name=Robbins8th/>
[[Autosomal recessive]] (as found, for example, in [[Alström syndrome]]<ref name=Robbins8th/>), [[X-linked]] (as in [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]), and [[Mitochondrial disease|mitochondrial]] inheritance of the disease is also found.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schönberger J, Seidman CE |title=Many roads lead to a broken heart: the genetics of dilated cardiomyopathy |journal=Am J Hum Genet. |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=249–60 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11443548 |pmc=1235300 |doi=10.1086/321978 }}</ref> Some relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have preclinical, asymptomatic heart-muscle changes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mahon NG, Murphy RT, MacRae CA, Caforio AL, Elliott PM, McKenna WJ |title=Echocardiographic evaluation in asymptomatic relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy reveals preclinical disease |journal=Ann Intern Med. |volume=143 |issue=2 |pages=108–15 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=16027452 }}</ref> Other cytoskeletal proteins involved in DCM include [[α-cardiac actin]], [[desmin]], and the nuclear [[lamins]] A and C.<ref name=Robbins8th/> Mitochondrial deletions and mutations presumably cause DCM by altering myocardial [[ATP generation]].<ref name=Robbins8th/>

==Associated symptoms==
For many affected individuals, dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition which will not limit the quality of life. A minority, however, experience significant symptoms and there is sometimes a risk of sudden death. Evaluation by a cardiologist is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the outlook and particularly the risk of complications. In some patients, symptoms of left- and right-sided congestive heart failure develop gradually. Left ventricular dilatation may be present for months or even years before the patient becomes symptomatic.

Vague chest pain may be present, but typical [[angina pectoris]] is unusual and suggests the presence of [[ischemic heart disease]] as well. [[Syncope (medicine)|Syncope]] due to [[Cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]] and systemic [[embolism]] may occur.

==Physical examination==
The patient may present variable degrees of cardiac enlargement, and findings of [[congestive heart failure]]. In advanced stages of the disease, the [[pulse pressure]] is narrowed and the [[jugular venous pressure]] is elevated. Third and fourth heart sounds are common. [[Mitral]] or [[tricuspid]] [[Regurgitation (circular)|regurgitation]] may occur, presented by systolic [[Heart murmur|murmur]]s upon [[auscultation]] (see [[mitral regurgitation]] and [[tricuspid insufficiency]] for more details about the findings). Typically tachycardia is present during early stages of heart failure. Tachycardia can be at a fixed rate, without varying during phases of respiration. This is due to the fact that the dilated heart is no longer under control of the parasympathetic nervous system.

==Laboratory examinations==
Generalized enlargement of the heart is seen upon normal [[chest X-ray]]. [[Pleural effusion]] may also be noticed, which is due to pulmonary venous hypertension.

[[File:LBBB+RADandTransplant.png|thumb|300px|Serial 12-lead ECGs from a 49-year-old black man with cardiomyopathy. (TOP): [[Sinus tachycardia]] (rate about 101/min) with [[LBBB]] accompanied by [[Right axis deviation|RAD]] (here about 108°). Frequent multifocal [[Premature ventricular contraction|PVCs]] (both singly and in pairs) and [[left atrial enlargement]]. (BOTTOM): Same patient about 5 months later status-post orthotopic [[heart transplant]].]]

The [[electrocardiogram]] often shows [[sinus tachycardia]] or [[atrial fibrillation]], [[Cardiac arrhythmia#List of common cardiac dysrhythmias|ventricular arrhythmia]]s, [[left atrial enlargement]], and sometimes intraventricular conduction defects and low voltage. When [[left bundle-branch block]] (LBBB) is accompanied by [[right axis deviation]] (RAD), the rare combination is considered to be highly suggestive of dilated or congestive cardiomyopathy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nikolic G, Marriott HJ|title=Left bundle branch block with right axis deviation: a marker of congestive cardiomyopathy|journal=J Electrocardiol |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=395–404|year=1985 |month=Oct |pmid=3906012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Childers R, Lupovich S, Sochanski M, Konarzewska H.|title=Left bundle branch block and right axis deviation: a report of 36 cases|journal=J Electrocardiol |volume=33 |issue=Suppl |pages=93–102|year=2000 |pmid=11265743 }}</ref> [[Echocardiogram]] shows left ventricular dilatation with normal or thinned walls and reduced [[ejection fraction]]. Cardiac [[catheterization]] and [[coronary angiography]] are often performed to exclude ischemic heart disease.

[[Genetic testing]] can be important, since one study has shown that gene mutations in the TTN gene (which codes for a protein called [[titin]]) are responsible for "approximately 25% of familial cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 18% of sporadic cases."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Herman DS, Lam L, Taylor MR, Wang L, Teekakirikul P, Christodoulou D, Conner L, DePalma SR, McDonough B, Sparks E, Teodorescu DL, Cirino AL, Banner NR, Pennell DJ, Graw S, Merlo M, Di Lenarda A, Sinagra G, Bos JM, Ackerman MJ, Mitchell RN, Murry CE, Lakdawala NK, Ho CY, Barton PJ, Cook SA, Mestroni L, Seidman JG, Seidman CE |title=Truncations of Titin causing dilated cardiomyopathy |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=366 |issue=7 |pages=619–628 |year=2012 |month=Feb 16 |pmid=22335739 }}</ref> The results of the genetic testing can help the doctors and patients understand the underlying cause of the dilated cardiomyopathy. Genetic test results can also help guide decisions on whether a patient's relatives should undergo genetic testing (to see if they have the same genetic mutation) and cardiac testing to screen for early findings of dilated cardiomyopathy.

[[Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging]] (cardiac MRI) may also provide helpful diagnostic information in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pennell DJ, Sechtem UP, Higgins CB, Manning WJ, Pohost GM, Rademakers FE, van Rossum AC, Shaw LJ, Yucel EK.|title=Clinical indications for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR): Consensus Panel report|journal=Eur Heart J |volume=25 |issue=21 |pages=1940–1965|year=2004 Nov |pmid=15522474 }}</ref>

==Computational models of eccentric cardiac growth==
Cardiac dilation is a transversely [[isotropic]], irreversible process resulting from excess strains on the [[myocardium]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jmps.2010.07.003 |title=Generic approach towards finite growth with examples of athlete's heart, cardiac dilation, and cardiac wall thickening |year=2010 |last1=Goektepe |first1=Serdar |last2=Abilez |first2=Oscar John |last3=Kuhl |first3=Ellen |journal=Mechanics and Physics of Solids}}</ref> A computation model of volumetric, isotropic, and cardiac wall growth predicts the relationship between cardiac strains (e.g. volume overload after myocardial infaction) and dilation using the following governing equations:

<math>F = F^e \cdot F^g\,</math>

where <math>F^e</math> is elastic volume stretch that is reversible and <math>F^g</math> is irreversible, isotropic volume growth described by:

<math>F^g = \mathbb{I}+[\lambda^{g}-1]f_{0}\otimes f_{0} \,</math>

where <math>f_{0}</math> is a vector, which points along a cardiomyocyte's long axis and <math> \lambda^g </math> is the cardiomyocyte stretch due to growth. The total [[cardiomyocyte]] growth is given by:

<math>\lambda = \lambda^e \cdot F\lambda^g\,</math>

The above model reveals a gradual dilation of the [[myocardium]], especially the ventricular myocardium, to support the blood volume overload in the chambers. Dilation manifests itself in an increase in total cardiac mass and cardiac diameter. [[Cardiomyocytes]] reach their maximum length of 150 <math>\mu</math>m in the endocardium and 130 <math>\mu</math>m in the epicardium by the addition of sarcomeres.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jmps.2010.07.003 |title=A multiscale model for eccentric and concentric cardiac growth through sarcomerogenesis. |year=2010 |last1=Goektepe |first1=Serdar |last2=Abilez |first2=Oscar John |last3=Parker |first3=K |last4=Kuhl |first4=Ellen |journal=Theoretical Biology}}</ref>  Due to the increase in diameter, the dilated heart appears spherical in shape, as opposed the elliptical shape of a healthy human heart. In addition, the ventricular walls maintain the same thickness, characteristic of pathophysiological cardiac dilation.

==Treatment==
Years ago the statistic was that the majority of patients, particularly those over 13 (if passed on genetically and has taken place earlier in life) and over 55 years of age, died within 3 years of the onset of symptoms (stage 5 of CHF) &ndash; and such figures can still be found in many textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The situation has improved dramatically in recent years with drug therapy that can slow down progression and in some cases even improve the heart condition. Death is due to either [[congestive heart failure]] or ventricular [[tachyarrhythmia|tachy-]] or [[bradyarrhythmia]]s.

Patients are given the standard therapy for heart failure, typically including salt restriction, [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) inhibitors, [[diuretic]]s, and [[digitalis]]. [[Anticoagulation|Anticoagulants]] may also be used. Alcohol should be avoided. [[Artificial pacemaker]]s may be used in patients with intraventricular conduction delay, and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s in those at risk of arrhythmia. These forms of treatment have been shown to improve symptoms and reduce hospitalization.

In patients with advanced disease who are refractory to medical therapy, [[heart transplantation]] may be considered.

=== Reverse remodeling ===

The progression of heart failure is associated with left ventricular remodeling, which manifests as gradual increases in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, wall thinning, and a change in chamber geometry to a more spherical, less elongated shape. This process is usually associated with a continuous decline in [[ejection fraction]]. The concept of cardiac remodeling was initially developed to describe changes which occur in the days and months following myocardial infarction. It has been extended to cardiomyopathies of non-ischemic origin, such as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or chronic myocarditis, suggesting common mechanisms for the progression of cardiac dysfunction. Literally, reverse remodeling is the process of reversing the remodeling, or in other words,it is a process of a temporary or a permanent correction of the heart. A 2004 article gives a description of the current therapies that support reverse remodeling and suggests a new approach to the prognosis of cardiomyopathies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pieske B |title=Reverse remodeling in heart failure – fact or fiction? |journal=Eur Heart J Suppl. |volume=6 |pages=D66–78 |year=2004 |url=http://eurheartjsupp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/6/suppl_D/D66 |doi=10.1016/j.ehjsup.2004.05.019}}</ref>

=== Alternative treatment ===
[[alternative medicine|Alternative treatments]] are promoted by some, including food supplements [[Coenzyme Q10]], [[L-Carnitine]], [[Taurine]] and D-Ribose, and there is some evidence for the benefits of Coenzyme Q10 in treating heart failure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Langsjoen PH, Langsjoen PH, Folkers K |title=A six-year clinical study of therapy of cardiomyopathy with coenzyme Q10 |journal=Int J Tissue React. |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=169–71 |year=1990 |pmid=2276895 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Folkers K, Langsjoen P, Langsjoen PH |title=Therapy with coenzyme Q10 of patients in heart failure who are eligible or ineligible for a transplant |journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun. |volume=182 |issue=1 |pages=247–53 |year=1992 |month=January |pmid=1731784 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-291X(05)80137-8 |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(05)80137-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Baggio E, Gandini R, Plancher AC, Passeri M, Carmosino G |title=Italian multicenter study on the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 as adjunctive therapy in heart failure.

=== Dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs, cats and other pets ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Irish Wolfhound]] -->

Dilated cardiomyopathy is a heritable disease in some dog breeds, including the [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], [[Dobermann]], [[Great Dane]], [[Irish Wolfhound]] and [[St. Bernard (dog)|St Bernard]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oyama MA, Chittur S |title=Genomic expression patterns of cardiac tissues from dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy |journal=Am J Vet Res. |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=1140–55 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=16111151 |doi=10.2460/ajvr.2005.66.1140 }}</ref> Treatment is based on medication, including ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics and phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is also a disease affecting some cat breeds, including the [[Oriental Shorthair]], [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]], [[Persian (cat)|Persian]], and [[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian]]. As opposed to these hereditary forms, non-hereditary DCM used to be common in the overall cat population before the addition of taurine to commercial cat food.

There is also a high incidence of heritable dilated cardiomyopathy in captive [[Golden Hamster]]s (mesocricetus auratus), thanks in no small part to their being highly [[Inbreeding|inbred]].  The incidence is high enough that several strains of Golden Hamster have been developed to serve as animal models in clinical testing for human forms of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nigro V, Okazaki Y, Belsito A, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of the Syrian hamster cardiomyopathy gene |journal=Hum.
