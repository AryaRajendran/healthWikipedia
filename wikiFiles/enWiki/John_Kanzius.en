'''John S.

Kanzius, an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]], stated that he was motivated to research the subject of cancer treatment by his own experiences undergoing [[chemotherapy]] for treatment of [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].<ref name="ap-news-2005-05">{{cite web|author=[[Associated Press]]|title=Center to test radio wave cancer treatment |date=2005-05-11|accessdate=2007-09-15|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/usworld/news-article.aspx?storyid=37036|publisher=[[Firstcoastnews.com|First Coast News]]}}</ref><ref name = "cbs">{{cite web| title=Cancer patient invents treatment machine |url=http://cbs13.com/health/health_story_240004016.html|publisher=CBS13|date=August 27, 2007|accessdate=2007-09-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070831092126/http://cbs13.com/health/health_story_240004016.html |archivedate = 2007-08-31}}</ref>

[[Kanzius RF Therapy]] is an [[experimental cancer treatment]] that employs a combination of either [[Colloidal gold|gold]] or [[Carbon nanotube|carbon]] [[nanoparticles]] and [[radio wave]]s to heat and destroy cancer cells without damaging healthy cells.<ref name="doi:10.1002/cncr.23155" /><ref name="doi:10.1073/pnas.0609265103">{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|title=Mammalian pharmacokinetics of carbon nanotubes using intrinsic near-infrared fluorescence|author=Paul Cherukuri|coauthors=Christopher J.

The [[specific absorption rate]] for radio waves by living tissue in the proposed wavelengths and intensity levels is very low. Metals absorb this energy much more efficiently than tissue through [[dielectric heating]]; [[Richard Smalley]] has suggested that [[carbon nanotubes]] could be used to similar purpose.<ref name="Cancer Therapy Takes Next Step">

==Water-related ==
Later in 2007, Kanzius claimed that the same [[radio frequency]] [[transmitter]] can also be used to generate a hydrogen-oxygen mixture dissociated from [[seawater|salt water]].<ref name="wkyc-09-12-web">

For more information, please see [[Talk:John Kanzius#Warning: Energy quotes dating issues on web & video|the discussion on this issue]].</ref> In a column in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], it was pointed out that since water is the left over product from burning Hydrogen, it can not be used as a fuel by generating hydrogen and then burning it without an equal or greater amount of input energy than output since it would violate the laws of thermodynamics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=Burning water and other myths|journal=news@nature|doi=10.1038/news070910-13|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref> The discovery was made accidentally while he was researching the use of radio waves for [[desalination]]. Kanzius said that "In this case we weren't looking for energy, we were looking for something that might do desalinization. The more we tried desalinization, the more heat we produced, until we got fire".<ref name="wkyc-sep-12-video" /> Kanzius admitted that this process could not be considered an energy source, as more energy is used to produce the RF signal than can be obtained from the burning gas and stated in July 2007 that he never claimed his discovery would replace oil, asserting only that his discovery was "thought provoking".<ref name="saltwater1">{{cite web| last=Ogden| first=Shannon| publisher=[[Firstcoastnews.com|First Coast News]]|title=Salt Water Fuel| url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/mostpopular/news-article.aspx?storyid=85990&provider=top|date=2007-07-05|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> 

According to [[Rustum Roy]], a materials scientist at [[Pennsylvania State University]], "The salt water isn't burning per se, despite appearances. The radio frequencies act to weaken the bonds between the elements that make up salt water, releasing the hydrogen. Once ignited, the hydrogen will burn as long as it is exposed to the frequencies".<ref name="post-gazette-sep-9">{{cite web|title=Salt water as fuel?

<!-- Hydrogen gas burns with oxygen, while releasing heat, and turning into water - which has a lower energy content than the original two elements. In order to reproduce hydrogen and oxygen gas, external energy must be introduced into the low-energy water (compound). {{fact|date=October 2009}} Is this a science lesson? Otherwise it should be integrated into the text. -->

<!--Please NOTE, regarding ENERGY:

  As of July 5th, 2007 Kanzius did not claim this to be an "energy source", "free energy" or "overunity". See.<ref name="saltwater1" />

  Correspondingly, please do DO NOT put such claims in the article, nor add categories indicating such,  

  **unless** you have a newer reliable source, where he would be making such claims.

  Also, please see the article discussion page section "Warning: Energy quotes dating issues on web & video", as a TV station has broadcast archive footage from May 2007 in September 2007 (i.e. after the retraction) and this has spread to at least one web page, in order to avoid spreading the mis-dated quote further..-->
