SFTSV is a [[Phlebovirus]] in the family of [[Bunyaviridae]].<ref name = "Xue-jie Yu et al.">Fever with thrombocytopenia asshociated with a novel Bunyavirus in China. N Engl J Med. 2011  Mar 16. [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010095#t=article Full text]</ref> It appears to be more closely related to the [[Uukuniemi virus]] serogroup than to the Sandfly fever group. It may be the prototype of a new serogroup within the [[Phlebovirus]] genus as it is only distantly related to both the existing serogroups.

The clinical condition it causes is known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). SFTS is an emerging infectious disease recently described in northeast and central China. SFTS has a fatality rate of 12% and as high as 30% in some areas. The major clinical symptoms of SFTS are fever, vomiting, diarrhea, multiple organ failure, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leucopenia (low white blood cell count) and elevated liver enzyme levels.

==History==

In 2009 Xue-jie Yu and colleagues isolated the SFTS virus (SFTSV) from SFTS patientsâ€™ blood.<ref name = "Xue-jie Yu et al."/>

==Genome==

The genome has been sequenced.<ref name=Lu2011>Lu J, Li C, Zhang FS, Wu W, Zhang QF, Zhang L, Wang T, Wang Q, Qiu PH, Liang MF, Li DX (2011) 
Expression of structural and non-structural proteins of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus. Bing Du Xue Bao 27(6):515-520</ref> There are three segments - large(L), medium (M) and small (S) Six proteins have been identified - an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a glycoprotein precursor (M), a glycoprotein N (Gn), a glycoprotein C (Gc), a nuclear protein (NP) and a non structural protein (NSs). 

The L segment encodes the RNA polymerase with 2084 amino acid residues.

The M segment encodes one open reading frame encoding 1073 amino acid precursors of glycoproteins (Gn and Gc). 

The S segment has 1744 nucleotides of ambisense RNA encoding two proteins, the N and NSs proteins. These lie in opposite orientations and are separated by a 62 nucleotide intergenic region.

==Life cycle==

The life cycle of the SFTSV is not yet known, but seems most likely to involve arthropod vectors and mammaliam hosts, including [[cat]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[hedgehog]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[possum]]s and [[yak]]s. Humans appear to be accidental hosts, and play no essential role in the life cycle of SFTSV. SFTSV has been detected from the ixoid [[tick]], ''[[Haemaphysalis longicornis]]'' and ''[[Rhipicephalus microplus]]''.<ref name=Zhang2012>{{cite journal|last=Zhang YZ et al.|title=The Ecology, Genetic Diversity, and Phylogeny of Huaiyangshan Virus in China|journal=J. Virol.|year=2012|volume=86|issue=4|pages=2864-2868|PMID=22190717|accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref> The transmission route of SFTSV is unknown, but person to person transmission either plays no role, or at least is not an important route of transmission of SFTSV.

==Epidemiology==

This virus has been found in the Chinese provinces of [[Anhui]], [[Henan]], [[Hubei]], [[Jiangsu]], [[Liaoning]] and [[Shandong]]. SFTS occurs in rural areas, from March to November, and a majority of cases are found from April to July.
