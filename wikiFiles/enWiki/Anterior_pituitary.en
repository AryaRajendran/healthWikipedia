A major organ of the [[endocrine system]], the '''anterior pituitary''', also called the '''adenohypophysis''', is the glandular, [[Anatomical terms of location#Usage in human anatomy|anterior]] lobe that together with the [[posterior lobe]] makes up the [[pituitary gland]] (the other part of the pituitary being the [[posterior pituitary]]). The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes including [[stress (medicine)|stress]], [[Human development (biology)|growth]], [[reproduction]] and [[lactation]].

Its regulatory functions are achieved through the secretion of various [[peptide hormone]]s that act on target organs including the [[adrenal gland]], [[liver]], [[bone]], [[thyroid gland]], and [[gonad]]s. The anterior pituitary itself is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] and by [[negative feedback]] from these target organs.

Disorders of the anterior pituitary are generally classified by the presence of over- or underproduction of pituitary hormones. For example, a [[prolactinoma]] is a [[pituitary adenoma]] that overproduces [[prolactin]]. In Sheehan's syndrome of [[postpartum hypopituitarism]], the anterior pituitary uniformly malfunctions and underproduces all hormones. Proper function of the anterior pituitary and of the organs it regulates can often be ascertained via [[blood test]]s that measure hormone levels.

==Anatomy==
The [[pituitary gland]] is a pea-sized gland that sits in a protective bony enclosure called the [[sella turcica]]. It is composed of three lobes: anterior, intermediate, and posterior. In many animals, these three lobes are distinct. However, in humans, the intermediate lobe is but a few cell layers thick and indistinct; as a result, it is often considered part of the anterior pituitary. In all animals, the fleshy, glandular anterior pituitary is distinct from the neural composition of the [[posterior pituitary]].

The anterior pituitary is composed of multiple parts:
:; Pars distalis: The [[pars distalis]], or "distal part", comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. Occasionally, "pars distalis" is incorrectly used as a synonym for the anterior pituitary.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}
:; Pars tuberalis: The [[pars tuberalis]], or "tubular part", forms a sheath extending up from the pars distalis and wrapping around the [[pituitary stalk]]. Its function is poorly understood.
:; Pars intermedia: The [[pars intermedia]], or "intermediate part", sits between the pars distalis and the posterior pituitary and is often very small in humans.

==Embryology==
The anterior pituitary arises from an [[invagination]] of the oral [[ectoderm]] and forms [[Rathke's pouch]]. This contrasts with the [[posterior pituitary]], which originates from [[neuroectoderm]].

==Physiology==
Anterior pituitary has 2 types of cells-1) Chromophil cells which have staining property 2)Chromophobe cells

The acidophilic cells (GH and PRL) have extensive rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and produce single chain [[polypeptides]] without any [[glycosylation]] or phosphorylation. Basophilic staining results from lysosome action modifying the hormones (or prohormones in the case of corticotrophs) by glycosylation.

An easy mnemonic to remember the hormones produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary is "FLATPEG".

==Regulation==
Hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland is regulated by hormones secreted by the [[hypothalamus]]. Neuroendocrine neurons in the hypothalamus project [[axon]]s to the [[median eminence]], at the base of the brain. At this site, these neurons can release substances into small blood vessels that travel directly to the anterior pituitary gland (the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal vessels). 

==Etymology==
The anterior pituitary is also known as the '''adenohypophysis''', meaning "glandular undergrowth", from the Greek ''adeno'' ("gland"), ''hypo'' ("under"), and ''physis'' ("growth").
