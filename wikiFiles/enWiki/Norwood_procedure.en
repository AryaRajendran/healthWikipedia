In the heart on the right, note the near absence of the [[left ventricle]], which normally provides [[systemic circulation]]. In the Norwood procedure, blood flow from the [[right ventricle]] is rerouted to serve this function, which means that an alternative source of [[pulmonary circulation]] must be provided. |

The '''Norwood Procedure''' is a [[surgery]] performed on the [[heart]]. The first successful use of the procedure was reported by Norwood and colleagues in 1981.<ref>Norwood WI, Lang P, Casteneda AR, Campbell DN.

==Indications==
This procedure is most often performed to treat [[Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome]], certain types of [[mitral atresia]], or other conditions that result in single ventricle circulation.

In these conditions, the most urgent problem is that the heart is unable to pump blood to the systemic circulation (i.e. to the body).  The goal of the Norwood procedure is to connect the single ventricle to the systemic circulation.  To accomplish this, blood flow to the lungs is disrupted, and therefore an alternative path must be created to supply the lungs.

==Process==
Entry to the body cavity for the Norwood Procedure is gained by a vertical incision above the [[Human sternum|sternum]]. Separation of the sternum is necessary.

This surgery is complex and may vary slightly depending on the [[diagnosis]] and overall condition of the [[heart]].  

The surgery on the heart can be divided into two main steps.<ref name="CornoFesta2008">{{cite book|author1=A. Corno|author2=Gigi P. Festa|title=Congenital Heart Defects.

===Providing systemic circulation===
The main [[pulmonary artery]] is separated from the left and right portions of the pulmonary artery and joined with the upper portion of the [[aorta]].  Widening of the [[pulmonary artery]] is often necessary, and may be accomplished by using the patient's existing [[biological tissue]], or appropriate animal tissue.  This allows the [[blood]], a mixture of [[Dioxygen complex|oxygenated]] and deoxygenated, to be pumped to the body via the morphologic right ventricle, through the [[pulmonary valve]].

===Providing pulmonary circulation===
Since the remainder of the pulmonary artery is now disconnected from the heart, one of a few techniques must be used to supply blood to the lungs:
* With a modified [[Blalock-Taussig Shunt]], a [[Gore-Tex]] conduit (a kind of plastic tubing) is used to connect the [[subclavian artery]] to the pulmonary artery.  In this case, blood comes from the single ventricle, through the pulmonary valve, the reconstructed aorta, the subclavian artery, and the conduit, to the lungs.  There are variations on this procedure where the origin of the shunt is elsewhere in the systemic circulation (e.g. from the aorta itself) rather than the subclavian artery.
* With a [[Sano shunt]], a hole is made in the wall of the single ventricle, and a Gore-Tex conduit is used to connect the ventricle to the pulmonary artery.  The key difference here is that the blood flow is more pulsatile than with the Blalock-Taussig version.

After this first step (''switching the right ventricle in functional position of the absent left ventricle'') children generally proceed down the path to a [[Fontan procedure]].
