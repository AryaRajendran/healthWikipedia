'''Thoracic splanchnic nerves''' are [[splanchnic nerves]] that arise from the [[sympathetic trunk]] in the [[thorax]] and travel inferiorly to provide sympathetic innervation to the [[abdomen]].  The nerves contain [[preganglionic sympathetic]] and [[visceral afferent]] fibers.

There are three main thoracic splanchnic nerves:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Name''' || '''Ganglia''' || '''Description'''
 |- 
 | '''greater'''<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000071188|greater splanchnic nerve}}</ref> ||  T5-T9 or T5-T10<ref name="norman">{{NormanAnatomy|thoraxlesson5}}</ref> || The nerve travels through the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and enters the abdominal cavity, where its fibers synapse at the [[celiac ganglia]].  The nerve contributes to the [[celiac plexus]], a network of nerves located in the vicinity of where the [[celiac trunk]] branches from the [[abdominal aorta]].  The fibers in this nerve modulate the activity of the [[enteric nervous system]] of the [[foregut]].  They also provide the sympathetic innervation to the [[adrenal medulla]], stimulating [[catecholamine]] release. 
 |- 
 | '''lesser'''<ref name="DorlandsLesser">{{DorlandsDict|six/000071189|lesser splanchnic nerve}}</ref> || T9-T12, T9-T10,<ref name="DorlandsLesser" /> T10-T12, or T10-T11<ref name="norman" /> || The nerve travels inferiorly, lateral to the greater splanchnic nerve.  Its fibers synapse with their postganglionic counterparts in the [[superior mesenteric ganglia]], or in the [[aorticorenal ganglion]].  The nerve modulates the activity of the enteric nervous system of the [[midgut]].
 |- 
 | '''least''' or '''lowest'''<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000071190|Least splanchnic nerve}}</ref> ||  T12-L2, or T11-T12 || The nerve travels into the abdomen, where its fibers [[synapse]] in the [[renal ganglia]].

The nerve's origins can be remembered by the "4-3-2 rule", accounting for the number of [[ganglia]] giving rise to each nerve. However, different sources define the nerves in different ways, so this rule may not always be reliable.
