'''Health indicators''' are [[quantifiable]] characteristics of a population which researchers use as supporting evidence for describing the health of a population. Typically, researchers will use a [[survey methodology]] to gather information about certain people, use [[statistics]] in an attempt to generalize the information collected to the entire population, then use the statistical analysis to make a statement about the health of the population.

Health indicators are often used by governments to guide health care policy.

==Example==
A common example of a health indicator is [[life expectancy]]. A government might have a system for collecting information on each citizen's age at the time of death. This data about age at death can be used to support statements about the national life expectancy, in which case life expectancy would be a "health indicator". Life expectancy may be one of many "health indicators" which collectively researchers would use to describe the health of the population of the country.

==Applications==
Health indicators are commonly used to guide [[public health]] policy.<ref>{{cite PMID|15733682}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
A health indicator which will be used internationally to describe [[global health]] should have the following characteristics:
#It should defined in such a way that it can be measured uniformly internationally<ref name="Larson and Mercer">{{cite doi|10.1503/cmaj.1021409}}</ref>
#It must have [[Validity (statistics)|statistical validity]]<ref name="Larson and Mercer"/>
#The indicator must be data which can feasibly be collected.<ref name="Larson and Mercer"/>
#The analysis of the data must result in a recommendation on which people can make changes to improve health<ref name="Larson and Mercer"/>
