The '''Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)''' is a mono-superspeciality [[hospital]] for [[Liver disease|liver]] and [[biliary disease]]s located at [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. It has been established by the Government of the [[Nation Capital Territory]] (NCT) of [[Delhi]] as an [[Autonomous Institute]], under the [[Societies Registration Act]] - 1860, at New Delhi. ILBS is a [[teaching hospital]] and has been given the status of [[Deemed University]] by the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) of India.

ILBS has been created by the Government of Delhi to make it a dedicated international center of excellence for the diagnosis and management of liver and biliary diseases and to provide advanced training and research in the field of Hepato-biliary Sciences.

==History==
The [[foundation stone]] of ILBS was laid in 2003. The first phase of ILBS was built by the [[public works department]] (PWD). The first phase was completed in 2009. The formal inauguration of the hospital took place on January 14, 2010 by the Chief Minister of Delhi, Mrs. [[Shiela Dixit]]. The second phase of ILBS is being constructed by the [[Delhi Metro Rail Corporation]] (DMRC) and is likely to be completed by 2011.

==Services==
ILBS is a 155-bedded hospital treating diseases of the [[liver]], [[biliary tract]] and [[pancreas]]. The hospital has outdoor, in-patient and [[emergency services]].

===Out-Patient Department (OPD) Services===
The Out-Patient Department (OPD) services of ILBS run six days a week from 9 AM to 2 PM. The OPD services are run by the [[hepatologist]]s and by the hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeons. In addition, specialty clinics in [[Nephrology]] and [[Neurology]] are also run daily. The appointment for outdoor services can be obtained by calling the ILBS number +91-11-46300000, however, patients can be seen directly, even without appointment. A registration charge of Rs. 100 is charged from all new patients in addition to a consultation charge of Rs. 200, which is valid for one week. For stable patients reaching the OPD in the morning every effort is made to complete their investigations the same day, so that they can go back with a [[diagnosis]] and [[Medical prescription|prescription]] by evening.

===In-Patient Services===
The ILBS is a 155-bedded hospital. The beds are categorized into three types: general beds, semi-private beds, and private beds.

===Critical Care Services===
ILBS has four [[intensive care unit]]s (ICUs): Gastro-intestinal bleed ICU, Liver coma ICU, HPB surgical ICU, and [[Liver transplant]] ICU.

====Gastro-intestinal (GI) Bleed ICU====
The GI Bleed ICU is the first dedicated ICU in the country for [[GI bleeding]]. It is managed by combined team of hepatologists, [[critical care medicine]] [[intensivist]]s, GI surgeon, and [[Interventional radiology|intervention radiologists]]. GI bleeding from any cause (both liver related and non-liver related) is appropriately managed here.

===Casualty Services===
The casualty services of ILBS run 24-hours a day. There are dedicated beds for emergency and [[triage]]. All kinds of liver, biliary, and pancreatic emergencies are dealt 

in the emergency. After adequate stabilization the patients are then shifted to the appropriate wards.

==Departments==
ILBS has following departments: Hepatology (including transplant hepatology and pediatric hepatology), Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary, Laboratory Medicine (including [[Pathology]], [[Microbiology]], [[Virology]], [[Haematology]], Clinical Chemistry & [[Immunopathology]], Clinical & Cellular Transplant Immunology), Radiology (including Diagnostic Radiology and Intervention Radiology), Transfusion Medicine, [[Anaesthesia]], Critical Care Medicine, Speciality (including Neurology, Nephrology, and [[Cardiology]]), and Research.

==Education at ILBS==
Post graduate courses (DM; M.Ch) as per MCI norms and advanced training in [[clinical care]] to senior residents will be a part of core-curriculum of ILBS. To maintain competency of the faculty and other employees, CME programs, active participation in national/international conferences are also part of ILBS curriculum. There are also ongoing public awareness programs at ILBS on liver, pancreas and biliary diseases. ILBS is committed to serve as a nodal institute for [[advocacy]] and policy making at National and International level in its specified field.

==Research at ILBS==
The clinical Faculty at ILBS is well trained from reputed national and international universities and has a good track record in research in respective fields. ILBS has a mandate for undertaking frontline research. It is committed to provide training for the doctoral students and postdoctoral research scholars. The training will focus on understanding the concepts of modern [[biology]] with emphasis on virology, [[oncology]], [[immunology]], [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[Cell biology|cell]] and [[molecular biology]]. ILBS is committed to pursue clinical, translational and basic research to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral, immunological and oncological liver disorders with an aim to develop [[stem cell therapy]], [[vaccine]]s, [[biomarker]]s and novel diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Goal is to create new solutions for the improvement in patient care. ILBS will ensure patient safety, scientific integrity and rigor when pursuing [[clinical trial]]s.
