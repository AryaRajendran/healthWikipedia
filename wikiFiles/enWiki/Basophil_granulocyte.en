'''Basophil granulocytes''', mostly referred to as basophils, are the least common of the [[granulocyte]]s, representing about 0.01% to 0.3% of circulating [[white blood cells]].

The name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic, i.e., they are susceptible to [[staining]] by [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[dye]]s, as shown in the picture.

Basophils contain large [[cytoplasm]]ic granules which obscure the [[cell nucleus]] under the [[microscope]]. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has 2 [[wiktionary:Lobe|lobe]]s. The [[mast cell]], a [[cell (biology)|cell]] in [[biological tissue|tissues]], has many similar characteristics. For example, both cell types store [[histamine]], a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated in certain ways (histamine causes some of the symptoms of an [[allergy|allergic]] reaction). Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils can be recruited out of the [[blood]] into a tissue when needed.

==Function==
[[Image:Reference ranges for blood tests - white blood cells.png|thumb|500px|right|[[Reference ranges for blood tests]] of white blood cells, comparing basophil granulocyte amount (shown in violet) with other cells.]]

Basophils appear in many specific kinds of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reactions, particularly those that cause allergic symptoms. Basophils contain anticoagulant [[heparin]], which prevents blood from clotting too quickly. They also contain the vasodilator histamine, which promotes blood flow to tissues. They can be found in unusually high numbers at sites of [[Parasitism#Types|ectoparasite]] infection, e.g., [[tick]]s. Like [[eosinophils]], basophils play a role in both parasitic infections and allergies.<ref>Voehringer D. 2009. Trends in Parasitology.</ref> They are found in tissues where allergic reactions are occurring and probably contribute to the severity of these reactions. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell surface that bind [[immunoglobulin|IgE]], an immunoglobulin involved in macroparasite defense and [[allergy]]. It is the bound IgE antibody that confers a selective response of these cells to environmental substances, for example, [[pollen]] [[protein]]s or [[helminth]] antigens. Recent studies in mice suggest that basophils may also regulate the behavior of [[T cell]]s and mediate the magnitude of the secondary immune response.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nakanishi|first=Kenji|title=Basophils as APC in Th2 response in allergic inflammation and parasite infection|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|year=2010|month=December|volume=22|issue=6|pages=814–820|doi=10.1016/j.coi.2010.10.018}}</ref>

==Immunophenotyping of basophils==
Basophils of mouse and human have consistent immunophenotypes as follows: [[FcεRI]]<sup>+</sup>, CD123, [[CD49b]](DX-5)<sup>+</sup>, [[CD69]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Thy-1]].2<sup>+</sup>, 2B4<sup>+</sup>, [[CD11b]]<sup>dull</sup>, [[CD117]](c-kit)<sup>–</sup>, [[CD24]]<sup>–</sup>, [[CD19]]<sup>–</sup>, [[CD80]]<sup>–</sup>, [[CD14]]<sup>–</sup>, [[CD23]]<sup>–</sup>, Ly49c<sup>–</sup>, [[CD122]]<sup>–</sup>, [[CD11c]]<sup>–</sup>, Gr-1<sup>–</sup>, NK1.1<sup>–</sup>, [[B220]]<sup>–</sup>, [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]]<sup>–</sup>, γδ[[T-cell receptor|TCR]]<sup>–</sup>, αβ[[T-cell receptor|TCR]]<sup>–</sup>, α<sub>4</sub> and β<sub>4</sub>-[[integrin]] negative.<ref name=Schroeder>Schroeder JT (2009). "Basophils beyond effector cells of allergic inflammation." ''Adv Immunol'' 101:123-161, PMID 19231594, {{DOI|10.1016/S0065-2776(08)01004-3}}.</ref>

Recently, Heneberg <ref name=Heneberg>{{cite journal|last=Heneberg|first=Petr|title=Mast cells and basophils: trojan horses of conventional lin- stem/progenitor cell isolates|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|year=2011|volume=17|issue=34|pages=3753–3771|pmid=22103846|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22103846|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> proposed that basophils may be defined as the cellular population positive for CD13, CD44, CD54, CD63, CD69, CD107a, CD123, CD164, CD193/ CCR3, CD203c, TLR-4, and [[FcεRI]]. When activated, some additional surface markers are known to be upregulated (CD13, CD107a, CD164), or surface-exposed (CD63, and the ectoenzyme CD203c).<ref name="Heneberg"/>

==Secretions==
When activated, basophils [[degranulation|degranulate]] to release [[histamine]], [[proteoglycan]]s (e.g. [[heparin]] and [[chondroitin]]), and [[proteolytic enzyme]]s  (e.g. [[elastase]] and [[lysophospholipase]]). They also secrete [[lipid]] mediators like [[leukotriene]]s, and several [[cytokine]]s. Histamine and proteoglycans are pre-stored in the cell's granules while the other secreted substances are newly generated. Each of these substances contributes to inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that basophils are an important source of the cytokine, [[interleukin-4]], perhaps more important than [[T cells]]. Interleukin-4 is considered one of the critical cytokines in the development of allergies and the production of [[IgE]] antibody by the immune system. There are other substances that can activate basophils to secrete which suggests that these cells have other roles in inflammation.<ref name=Janeway5>{{cite book | author = [[Charles Janeway|Janeway CA, Jr.]] ''et al.''  | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 5th | publisher = Garland Publishing | year = 2001 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10 |isbn=0-8153-3642-X |format=electronic full text via NCBI Bookshelf}}</ref>

The degranulation of basophils can be investigated ''in vitro'' by using [[flow cytometry]] and the so-called basophil-activation-test (BAT). Especially, in the diagnosis of allergies including of drug reactions (e.g. induced by [[contrast medium]]), the BAT of is great impact <ref> Böhm I et al.

[[Basopenia]] (a low basophil count) is difficult to demonstrate as the normal basophil count is so low; it has been reported in association with  autoimmune [[urticaria]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grattan CE, Dawn G, Gibbs S, Francis DM |title=Blood basophil numbers in chronic ordinary urticaria and healthy controls: diurnal variation, influence of loratadine and prednisolone and relationship to disease activity |journal=Clin Exp Allergy |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=337–41 |year=2003 |month=Mar |pmid=12614448 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0954-7894&date=2003&volume=33&issue=3&spage=337 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2222.2003.01589.x}}</ref> (a chronic itching condition). [[Basophilia]] is also uncommon but may be seen in some forms of [[leukaemia]] or [[lymphoma]].
