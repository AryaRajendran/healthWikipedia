The '''posterior parietal cortex''' (the portion of [[Parietal lobe|parietal neocortex]] posterior to the [[primary somatosensory cortex]]) plays an important role in producing planned movements. Before an effective movement can be initiated, the nervous system must know the original positions of the body parts that are to be moved, and the positions of any external objects with which the body is going to interact. The posterior parietal cortex receives input from the three sensory systems that play roles in the localization of the body and external objects in space: the visual system, the auditory system, and the somatosensory system. In turn, much of the output of the posterior parietal cortex goes to areas of frontal motor cortex: the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], various areas of the [[secondary motor cortex]], and the [[frontal eye field]]. [[fMRI]] studies in monkeys and [[TMS]] studies in humans indicate that the posterior parietal cortex comprises a mosaic of small areas, each specialized for guiding particular movements of eyes, head, arms or hands.

Damage to the posterior parietal cortex can produce a variety of sensorimotor deficits, including deficits in the perception and memory of spatial relationships, in accurate reaching and grasping, in the control of eye movement, and in attention. The two most striking consequences of PPC damage are [[apraxia]] and [[hemispatial neglect]].<ref>Pinel, John P.J. Biopsychology Seventh Edition. Pearson Education Inc., 2009</ref>

Some sources say that the PPC consists of [[Brodmann area 5]] and [[Brodmann area 7]].<ref name="urlTHE BRAIN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM">{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_06/a_06_cr/a_06_cr_mou/a_06_cr_mou.html |title=THE BRAIN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Other sources say it is only area 7.<ref name="isbn1-4160-3445-5">{{Cite book|author=Estomih Mtui; Gregory Gruener |title=Clinical Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience: With STUDENT CONSULT Online Access |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |pages=32 |isbn=1-4160-3445-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

There is also evidence indicating that it plays a role in perception of pain.<ref name="pmid11723270">{{Cite journal|author=Witting N, Kupers RC, Svensson P, Arendt-Nielsen L, Gjedde A, Jensen TS |title=Experimental brush-evoked allodynia activates posterior parietal cortex |journal=Neurology |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=1817â€“24 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11723270 |doi= |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11723270}}</ref>

One study found that novice artists have increased blood flow in the right posterior pareital compared to expert artists when challenged with art-related tasks.<ref>http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1solso.html</ref>

During a study conducted by neuroscientists at [[New York University]], published in 2012 in the journal ''Neuron'', a significant amount of coherent patterns of firing of neurons in the brain's PPC were discovered. To reach this conclusion, the NYU researchers had examined the neurological activity of [[macaque]] monkeys while having them perform a variety of tasks that required them to either reach and to simultaneously employ rapid eye movements or to only use rapid eye movements, in which were known as [[saccades]]. The coherent pattern of the firing of neurons in the PPC were only seen when both the eyes and arms were required to move for the same task, but not for tasks that involved only saccades.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=H.|last2=Hagan|first2=M.|last3=Pesaran|first3=B.|year=2012|title=Only Coherent Spiking in Posterior Parietal Cortex Coordinates Looking and Reaching|journal=[[Neuron]]|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.12.035}}</ref>

In neuroimaging studies, this region, particularly the [[angular gyrus]] is active when individuals have strong recollections of [[episodic memory]].
