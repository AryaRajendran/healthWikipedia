'''Emaciation''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɨ|ˌ|m|eɪ|ʃ|iː|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|ɨ|ˌ|m|eɪ|s|iː|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ən}}) is defined as extreme weight loss and thinness due to a loss of [[Subcutaneous tissue#Subcutaneous fat|subcutaneous fat]] (the fatty, or [[adipose tissue]] beneath the skin) and muscle throughout the body.<ref name=edef/> It affects human beings and animals, is often described as "wasting", and is caused by severe malnourishment and [[starvation]].  Emaciation is a predominant symptom of malnourishment, a basic component of poverty and [[famine]] that also occurs with diseases that interfere with the [[digestive system]] and appetite, other systems, and [[eating disorder]]s.<ref name=bmd/><ref name=ebb/><ref name=shr/> These include [[nutrition disorder|nutrient deficiency disorders]], diseases with prolonged fever and infection, [[malignant]] diseases, [[human parasite|parasitic]] infections that can result from contamination, [[anorexia nervosa]] and other conditions. The malnourishment associated with emaciation has been referred to as "[[wikt:inanition|inanition]]", while infection by parasites has been described as "[[wikt:adulteration|adulteration]]".<ref name=ebbp194/> Treatment of emaciation includes gradual renourishment with a slow increase of daily caloric intake to help rebuild tissues and regain weight. Rest, and emotional and psychological therapy and support may be included.<ref name=egh/>

==Characteristics==
In humans, the overall physical appearance of emaciation includes a thinning of the limbs, upper body and buttocks to an almost skeletal-looking state with an apparent absence of fat and [[muscle tone]]. The skin is thin, dry and translucent in some areas of the body, to the point that veins beneath the skin are somewhat visible. The face is thin and drawn with a hopeless, vacant and distressed demeanor; the eye sockets are sunken, giving the eyes a bulging appearance. The scalp is bony with dry, withering hair that is lacking. On the torso, the [[clavicle|collar bone]], [[sternum|chest bone]] and ribs are quite pronounced; the stomach is bloated, which indicates gastrointestinal distress associated with nutritional depletion. The mouth and tongue may be excessively dry, or moist with the tongue thickly coated; there is usually strong [[halitosis]], or foul breath.<ref name=ebb/> 

There is great fatigue, inability and lack of physical effort in the emaciated. Mental efficiency, problem solving and reasoning are somewhat impaired. The emotional state of an emaciated individual is often poor; feelings of depression, hopelessness, fear, anxiety and worthlessness may prevail. A person who is emaciated is usually submissive, both mentally and physically, to the will of others. Behavior is generally passive.<ref name=egh/><ref name=ebb/> 

The underlying starvation, malnourishment, and usually dehydration, associated with emaciation, affect and are harmful to [[organ system]]s throughout the body. The emaciated individual experiences disturbances of the blood, [[circulatory system|circulatory]], and [[urinary system]]s; these include [[hyponatremia]] and/or [[hypokalemia]] (low [[sodium]] and/or [[potassium]] in the blood, respectively), [[anemia]] (low [[hemoglobin]]), improper function of [[lymph]] ([[immune system]]-related [[leukocyte|white blood]] matter) and the [[lymphatic system]], and [[pleurisy]] (fluid in the [[pleural cavity]] surrounding the lungs) and [[edema]] (swelling in general) caused by poor or improper function of the kidneys to eliminate wastes from the blood.<ref name=ebb/>

==Cause==
In most of [[Africa]], poverty, malnutrition and disease are common. Among [[third world country|third world countries]], India is one of the leading countries plagued by malnutrition, with more than 200 million people affected. Emaciation in India is referred to as "shosha roga", which means "exploitative disease".<ref name=shr/> Diseases such as these are [[nutrition disorder|nutrient deficiency disorders]] that can cause varying degrees of emaciation based on the type of nutrient(s) chronically and persistently lacking or absent from the diet of an individual. Famine and third world conditions are usually involved. Severe emaciation can be caused by [[marasmus]], a disorder that is seen in children that are deprived of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Both weight and growth are affected. A similar disorder, seen in very young malnourished children, is [[kwashiorkor]]. With emaciation mostly confined to the upper body, kwashiorkor occurs after a child is [[weaning|weaned]] but is then deprived of protein comparible to what they were getting from their mother's milk. Slight emaciation is seen with nutrition disorders [[beriberi]], caused by a lack of [[thiamine]] (vitamin B1), and [[pellagra]], caused by insufficient intake of [[niacin]] (vitamin B3). The former is mainly characterized by mental impairment, and the latter is more serious, often leading to death.<ref name=shr/> 

Other diseases and disorders associated with emaciation include [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], [[tuberculosis]] and other infectious diseases with prolonged fever, [[human parasite|parasitic infections]], many forms of [[cancer]] and their [[chemotherapy|treatments]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[eating disorder]]s like [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref name=ebb/><ref name=egh/><ref name=shr/>

==Treatment==
Other than treating, curing or remedying the underlying cause of emaciation, it as a symptom is treated by regaining the weight and restoring the tissues. This is done through renourishment, or reintroducing nourishing liquids and foods to the body while increasing the intake of food energy. The process, usually begun in an individual deprived of food for a period of time, must be done slowly to avoid complications such as [[regurgitation]] and [[vomiting]]. It begins with spoonsful of water and salted broth, advancing to increased amounts of clear liquids including broth, [[tea]] and fruit juices. This soon is advanced to [[full liquid diet|full liquids]] such as milk (if no [[lactose intolerance]] is present) and cream-based soups. Once solid food is introduced, an emaciated individual is usually given up to eight small meals per day, at two-hour intervals. Meals may consist of a small milkshake to minor portions of meat with a starchy side item. For the purposes of weight gain and tissue rebuilding, the diet will be focused on proteins, fats and carbohydrates that are rich in vitamins and minerals, and relatively high in energy. Oily foods and high-fiber foods like grains and certain vegetables are discouraged because they are difficult to digest, and filling while lower in energy. Treatment of emaciation also includes much [[sleep]], rest and relaxation, and counseling.<ref name=ebb/><ref name=egh/>

==In animals==

The appearance and effects of emaciation in animals, both wild and domestic, is like that of humans&ndash;severe thinness, loss of fat and muscle, extremely pronounced and protruding bones, and weakness. Starvation and regularly dehydration, brought on by neglect and cruelty from humans, or as a result of illness are the usual causes of emaciation in domestic animals like dogs, cats and horses; in wild animals, starvation with emaciation is caused by unavailable sources of food, loss or changes of habitat, or neglect in captivity. The rehabilitation of emaciated animals, through treating their starvation and dehydration with slow renourishment, can be challenging. The unique and specific physiological and dietary needs of animals, be they [[mammal]]s, birds, [[reptile]]s, [[carnivore]]s, [[herbivore]]s, etc. are carefully considered to avoid causing harm.<ref name=eneg/><ref name=erep/>
