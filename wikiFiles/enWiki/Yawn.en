A '''yawn''' is a [[reflex]] of simultaneous inhalation of air and [[stretching]] of the eardrums, followed by exhalation of breath. '''[[wikt:pandiculation#English|Pandiculation]]''' is the act of yawning and stretching simultaneously.<ref name=pandiculate>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4752 MedOnline.net], "pandiculate"</ref>

Yawning is commonly associated with [[fatigue (medical)|tiredness]], [[stress (biological)|stress]], overwork, lack of stimulation and [[boredom]], though recent studies show it may be linked to the cooling of the brain.<ref>Popular Mechanics, January 2012 edition</ref> In [[humans]], yawning is often triggered by others yawning (e.g., seeing a person yawning, talking to someone on the phone who is yawning) and is a typical example of [[positive feedback]].<ref>Camazine, Deneubourg, Franks, Sneyd, Theraulaz, Bonabeau, ''Self-Organization in Biological Systems'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2003.

Yawn comes from Old English 'Ginian' and 'Gionian' meaning to "Open the mouth wide, gape," which in turn comes from the [[Proto-Germanic]] base '''gin-'''.

There are a number of theories that attempt to explain why animals and people yawn.<ref name="MSNBC">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3076713/ MSN.com], "Little Mystery: Why Do We Yawn?"</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Chudler |first=Eric H |title=Yawning...and Why Yawns are Contagious |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/yawning.html |date=July 31, 2007 |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref> It is likely that there are a number of triggers for the behavior. However, there are a few theories that attempt to explain the ''primary'' evolutionary reason for the yawn. None of them has been empirically substantiated.

One study states that yawning occurs when one's blood contains increased amounts of carbon dioxide and therefore becomes in need of the influx of oxygen (or expulsion of carbon dioxide) that a yawn can provide.<ref name="MSNBC"/><ref><nowiki>http://library.thinkquest.org/C0126536/main.php?currentchap=6&currentsect=yawn.htm</nowiki>{{dead link|date=May 2012}} Thinkquest.org, Brain: Organ of the Mind"</ref> Yawning may in fact reduce oxygen intake compared to normal respiration.<ref name=Provine2005/> But giving people additional oxygen didn't decrease yawning, and decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in a subject's environment also didn't prevent yawning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/yawning.html |title=Yawning.. and why yawning is contagious |date=31 July 2007 |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>

Another speculated reason for yawning is the desire to stretch one's muscles.<ref><nowiki>http://library.thinkquest.org/C0126536/main.php?currentchap=6&currentsect=yawn.htm</nowiki>{{dead link|date=May 2012}} Thinkquest.org, – "Brain: Organ of the Mind"</ref> The tongue and throat are some of the most overused muscles in the body, used for speech, breathing and swallowing. The need to stretch these muscles and refresh them arises just like in other muscles of the body, to ensure that they do not cramp{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. . Yawns are often accompanied by the urge to stretch. Prey animals must be ready to physically exert themselves at any given moment. There have been studies that suggest yawning, especially psychological "contagious" yawning, may have developed as a way of keeping a group of animals alert.<ref>[http://reallyworks.org/blog/2009/01/29/what-causes-yawning-the-real-reason-why-people-yawn/# Reallyworks.org – "What Causes Yawning: The Real Reason Why People Yawn"]{{verify credibility|date=May 2012}}</ref> If an animal is drowsy or bored, it may not be as alert as it should be to spring into action. Therefore, the "contagious" yawn could be an instinctual reaction to a signal from one member of the group reminding the others to stay alert.

The desire to yawn when one is nervous or afraid is linked to the 'flight or fight' response and is related to the amount of adrenalin in the muscles and the readiness to use it. If one is in this aroused adrenal state and the adrenalin isn't used, yawning results as a way of stretching and using the muscles and expending this excess of adrenalin. This is a cycle, so the yawning does not diminish until the 'danger' has passed or the 'fight' has occurred. One way or another the adrenalin must be expended {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

Nervousness has also been suggested as a possible reason. Nervousness often indicates the perception of an impending need for action. Anecdotal evidence suggests that yawning helps increase the state of alertness of a person. Paratroopers have been noted to yawn in the moments before they exit the aircraft.<ref name="newscientist">{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426104.400-yawning-may-boost-brains-alertness.html |title=Yawning may boost brain's alertness |last=Hooper |first=Rowan |date=2 July 2007 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref>

[[File:Yawning baby.jpg|thumb|225px|Research data strongly suggest that neither contagious nor story-induced yawning are reliable in children below the age of six years.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=James R. |last1=Anderson |first2=Pauline |last2=Meno |year=2003 |title=Psychological Influences on Yawning in Children |url=http://cpl.revues.org/index390.html |journal=Current psychology letters |volume=2 |issue=11}}</ref>]]
Another notion states that yawning is the body's way of controlling brain temperature.<ref name=Gallup2007>{{cite journal |first1=Andrew C. |last1=Gallup |first2=  |last2=Gallup|year=2007 |title=Yawning as a brain cooling mechanism: Nasal breathing and forehead cooling diminish the incidence of contagious yawning |url=http://www.epjournal.net/articles/yawning-as-a-brain-cooling-mechanism-nasal-breathing-and-forehead-cooling-diminish-the-incidence-of-contagious-yawning/ |journal=Evolutionary Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=92–101 |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070621161826.htm |laysource=Science Daily |laydate=June 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/12/15/yawn-brain-head.html |title=Discovery News |accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> In 2007, researchers including a professor of psychology from the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University of Albany]] proposed that yawning may be a means to keep the brain cool. Mammalian brains operate best within a narrow temperature range. In two experiments, they demonstrated that both subjects with cold packs attached to their foreheads and subjects asked to breathe strictly nasally exhibited reduced [[#Contagiousness|contagious yawning]] when watching videos of people yawning.<ref name=Gallup2007/><ref name=GMA>{{cite video |people=[[Gordon G. Gallup]] |title=Good Morning America – The Science of Yawning (July 30, 2007)  |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3425960&page=1 |medium=TV-Series |publisher=ABC |location=USA |date=2007}}</ref> A similar recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for [[thermoregulation|regulation of body temperature]]. Similarly, a study by Jared Guttmann at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] found that when a subject wearing earplugs yawned, a breeze is heard caused by the flux of the air moving between the subject's ear and the environment. Researcher Guttmann determined that a yawn causes one of three possible situations to occur: the brain cools down due to an influx or outflux of oxygen, the pressure in the brain is reduced by an outflux of oxygen, or the pressure of the brain is increased by an influx of air caused by increased cranial space.

Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the [[brain]] that affect [[emotion]]s, [[mood (psychology)|mood]], [[appetite]], and other phenomena. These chemicals include [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[glutamic acid]], and [[nitric oxide]]. As more (or less) of these compounds are activated in the [[brain]], the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of [[opioid]] [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[endorphin]]s reduces the frequency of yawning. Individuals in [[withdrawal|opioid withdrawal]] exhibit a greatly increased frequency of yawning. Patients taking the selective [[serotonin]] reuptake inhibitors Paxil ([[paroxetine]] HCl) or Celexa ([[citalopram]]) have been observed yawning more often.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Excessive yawning is more common during the first three months of taking the SSRIs. Anecdotal reports by users of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] often describe a marked stimulation of yawning while intoxicated, often associated with excess [[tears|lacrimation]] (tearing) and nasal mucosal stimulation, especially while "peaking" (undergoing the most intense portion of the [[psilocybin]] experience). While [[opioid]]s have been demonstrated to reduce this yawning and lacrimation provoked by psilocybin,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} it is not clear that the same pathways that induce yawning as a symptom of opioid abstinence in habituated users are the mode of action in yawning in mushroom users. While even opioid-dependent users of psilocybin on stable opioid therapy often report yawning and excess lacrimation while undergoing this [[entheogen]]ic mushroom experience, there are no reports on mushrooms in the literature regarding habituated users{{clarify|date=July 2012}} experiencing other typical opioid withdrawal symptoms such as cramping, physical pain, anxiety, gooseflesh, etc.

Recent research carried out by Garrett Norris, a lecturer in psychology at the [[University of Leeds]], involving monitoring the behavior of students kept waiting in a reception area indicates a connection (supported by neuro-imaging research) between empathic ability and yawning. "We believe that contagious yawning indicates empathy. It indicates an appreciation of other peoples' behavioral and physiological state." says Norris.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6988155.stm Sign of empathy]</ref>

Yawning behavior may be altered as a result of medical issues such as diabetes,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00429.2006 |title=Lack of central nitric oxide triggers erectile dysfunction in diabetes |year=2006 |last1=Zheng |first1=Hong |last2=Bidasee |first2=Keshore R. |last3=Mayhan |first3=William G. |last4=Patel |first4=Kaushik P. |journal=AJP: Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology |volume=292 |issue=3 |pmid=17095652 |pages=R1158–64}}</ref> stroke,<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/steve-jones/6583820/Yawning-is-part-of-what-makes-us-human.html Telegraph.co.uk]</ref> or adrenal conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2004.02.013 |title=Adrenalectomy and dexamethasone replacement on yawning behavior |year=2004 |last1=Anías-Calderón |first1=José |last2=Verdugo-Díaz |first2=Leticia |last3=Drucker-Colín |first3=René |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=154 |pages=255–9 |pmid=15302132 |issue=1}}</ref>

It is also possible that yawning is a low-impact territorial reflex. Usually being associated with boredom or lack of interest, yawning is often displayed when the subject is faced with a worrying or dangerous situation. Therefore, to yawn in the presence of a rival for territory would portray the subject as unthreatened by the rival in order to deter it from entering the subject's territory. This behavior is seen in many primates as well as some feline species.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} This type of response is related to the ethological phenomenon of [[displacement activity]].

Another proposed theory is that yawning has evolved to give sleeping animals a better chance of hearing approaching predators. Because yawning stretches the eardrums, the listener can often hear quieter sounds after a yawn, and since animals rely on their hearing while sleeping, this may have provided an evolutionary advantage.

To look at the issue in terms of a possible evolutionary advantage, yawning might be a [[herd instinct]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.10.022 |title=Yearning to yawn: The neural basis of contagious yawning |year=2005 |last1=Schürmann |first1=Martin |last2=Hesse |first2=Maike D. |last3=Stephan |first3=Klaas E. |last4=Saarela |first4=Miiamaaria |last5=Zilles |first5=Karl |last6=Hari |first6=Riitta |last7=Fink |first7=Gereon R. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=1260–4 |pmid=15670705}} (see also {{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.11.011 |title=Contagious yawning and the brain |year=2005 |last1=Platek |first1=Steven M. |last2=Mohamed |first2=Feroze B. |last3=Gallup |first3=Gordon G. |journal=Cognitive Brain Research |volume=23 |issue=2–3 |pages=448–52 |pmid=15820652}})</ref> For example, theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood in [[social relation|gregarious]] animals, similar to the howling of the [[wolf]] pack. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods.

The yawn reflex has long been observed to be contagious. In 1508, [[Erasmus]] wrote, "One man's yawning makes another yawn.,"<ref>[[Erasmus]] ''Adagio''  Chil.

Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse.

A 2007 study found that young children with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s do not increase their yawning frequency after seeing videos of other people yawning, in contrast to typically developing children. In fact, the autistic children actually yawned less during the videos of yawning than during the control videos. This supports the claim that contagious yawning is related to empathic capacity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0337 |title=Absence of contagious yawning in children with autism spectrum disorder |year=2007 |last1=Senju |first1=A. |last2=Maeda |first2=M. |last3=Kikuchi |first3=Y. |last4=Hasegawa |first4=T. |last5=Tojo |first5=Y. |last6=Osanai |first6=H. |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=706–8 |pmid=17698452 |pmc=2391210}}</ref>

The relationship between yawn contagion and empathy is strongly supported by a 2011 behavioral study, conducted by Ivan Norscia and Elisabetta Palagi (University of Pisa, Italy). The study revealed that - among other variables such as nationality, gender, and sensory modality - only social bonding predicted the occurrence, frequency, and latency of yawn contagion.<ref name=norsciapalagi>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028472 |title=Yawn Contagion and Empathy in Homo sapiens |year=2011 |editor1-last=Rogers |editor1-first=Lesley Joy |last1=Norscia |first1=Ivan |last2=Palagi |first2=Elisabetta |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=e28472 |pmid=22163307 |pmc=3233580}}</ref> As with other measures of empathy, the rate of contagion was found to be greatest in response to kin, then friends, then acquaintances, and lastly strangers.<ref name=norsciapalagi/> Related individuals (r≥0.25) showed the greatest contagion, in terms of both occurrence of yawning and frequency of yawns.<ref name=norsciapalagi/> Strangers and acquaintances showed a longer delay in the yawn response (latency) compared to friends and kin.<ref name=norsciapalagi/> Hence, yawn contagion appears to be primarily driven by the emotional closeness between individuals.<ref name=norsciapalagi/>

Yawning has been observed among various [[primate]]s. In these cases the yawn is a threat gesture, a way of maintaining order in the primates' social structure. Specific studies were conducted on chimpanzees<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0224 |title=Contagious yawning in chimpanzees |year=2004 |last1=Anderson |first1=J.

This helps to partly confirm a yawn's "contagiousness".

The Discovery Channel's show ''Mythbusters'' also tested this concept. In their small-scale, informal study they concluded that yawning is contagious.<ref>[http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-06.html DSC.discovery.com]{{psc|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Gordon Gallup, who hypothesizes that yawning may be a means of keeping the brain cool, also hypothesizes that "contagious" yawning may be a survival instinct inherited from our evolutionary past. "During human evolutionary history, when we were subject to predation and attacks by other groups, if everybody yawns in response to seeing someone yawn the whole group becomes much more vigilant and much better at being able to detect danger."<ref name=GMA/>

A study by the University of London has suggested that the "contagiousness" of yawns by a human will pass to dogs. The study observed that 21 of 29 dogs yawned when a stranger yawned in front of them, but did not yawn when the stranger only opened his mouth.<ref name="Carpenter"/> A recent study from Lund University showed that dogs, like humans,<ref name=Helt>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01495.x|title=Contagious Yawning in Autistic and Typical Development |year=2010 |last1=Helt |first1=Molly |last2=Eigsti |first2=Inge-Marie |journal=Child Development |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=1620–1631 |pmid=20840244 }}</ref> develop a susceptibility to contagious yawning gradually, and that while dogs above 7 months 'catch' yawns from humans, younger dogs are immune to contagion.<ref name=Madsen>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0568-9|title=Contagious yawning in domestic dog puppies (Canis lupus familiaris): the effect of ontogeny and emotional closeness on low-level imitation in dogs|year=2012 |last1=Madsen |first1=Elainie Alenkær |last2=Perssson |first2=Tomas |journal=Animal Cognition }}</ref> The study also indicated that nearly half of the dogs responded to the human's yawn by becoming relaxed and sleepy, suggesting that the dogs copied not just the yawn, but also the physical state that yawns typically reflect.

==Animal yawning==
In animals, yawning can serve as a warning signal. For example, [[Charles Darwin]], in his book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', mentioned that [[baboon]]s yawn to threaten their enemies, possibly by displaying large [[canine teeth]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SDiB_dDG8vYC&pg=PA48&dq=baboon+yawn&q= |title=Developing a social psychology of monkeys and apes |first= John K. |last=Chadwick-Jones |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1998 |page=48 |isbn=0-86377-820-8}}</ref> Similarly, [[Siamese fighting fish]] yawn only when they see a [[conspecific]] (same species) or their own mirror-image, and their yawn often accompanies aggressive attack.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Some comparative aspects of yawning in Betta sleepnes, Homo Sapiens, Pantera leo and Papio sphinx |author=Baenninger R |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |year=1987 |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=349–354 |doi=10.1037/0735-7036.101.4.349}}</ref> [[Guinea pig]]s also yawn in a display of dominance or anger, displaying their impressive incisor teeth. This is often accompanied by teeth chattering, purring and scent marking. [[Adelie Penguin]]s employ yawning as part of their [[courtship]] ritual. Penguin couples face off and the males engage in what is described as an "ecstatic display," opening their [[beak]]s and pointing their faces skyward. This trait has also been seen among [[Emperor Penguin]]s. Researchers have been attempting to discover why these two different [[species]] share this trait, despite not sharing a [[habitat]]. [[Snake]]s yawn, both to realign their jaws after a meal and for respiratory reasons, as their [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] can be seen to expand when they do this.

Some cultures lend yawning spiritual significance. The [[Greeks#Classical|Ancient Greeks]] and [[Maya civilization|classic Maya]] believed that yawning was a sign that a person's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] was trying to escape from his or her body. Covering the mouth when yawning might then prevent the soul from escaping.<ref>[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/what-causes-a-yawn.html Buzzle.com], "What causes a yawn"{{self-published inline|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Several superstitions have developed regarding the act of yawning and the harm that the act can do to the individual who is yawning. These superstitions may not only have arisen to prevent people from committing the [[faux pas]] of yawning loudly in another's presence (one of [[Mason Cooley]]'s [[aphorism]]s is "A yawn is more disconcerting than a contradiction."), and in 1663 [[Francis Hawkins]] advised "In yawning howl not, and thou shouldst abstain as much as thou can to yawn, especially when thou speakest",<ref>[[Francis Hawkins|Hawkins, Francis]] ''Youth's Behavior, or, Decency in Conversation amongst Men'' (1663) quoted in [[H.L.
