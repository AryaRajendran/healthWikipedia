'''RICE''' is a [[mnemonic]] for a treatment method for [[soft tissue injury|soft tissue injuries]] which is an [[acronym]] for '''[[Rest]]''', '''[[Ice]]''', '''[[compression (physical)|Compression]]''' and '''[[Elevation (kinesiology)|Elevation]]'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/rehab/a/rice.htm |title=R.I.C.E - Best for Acute Injuries |accessdate=2007-08-15 |work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://med.umich.edu/1libr/sma/sma_rice_sma.htm |title=Sports Medicine Advisor 2005.4: RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation for Injuries |accessdate=2007-08-15 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070911021102/http://med.umich.edu/1libr/sma/sma_rice_sma.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|235|||}}</ref> When used appropriately, recovery duration is usually shortened and discomfort minimised.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

RICE is considered a [[first-aid]] treatment, rather than a cure for soft tissue injuries. The aim is to manage discomfort and  internal bleeding.<ref name="pmid17512485">{{cite journal |author=Järvinen TA, Järvinen TL, Kääriäinen M, ''et al.'' |title=Muscle injuries: optimising recovery |journal=Best practice & research.

== Primary four terms==

=== Rest ===
Rest is a key component of
repairing the body. Without rest, continual strain is placed on the affected area, leading to increased inflammation, pain, and possible further injury. Additionally, some soft tissue injuries will take longer to heal without rest. There is also a risk of abnormal repair or chronic inflammation resulting from a failure to rest. In general, the period of rest should be long enough that the patient is able to use the affected limb with the majority of function restored and pain essentially gone.

=== Ice ===
Ice is excellent at reducing the inflammatory response and the pain from heat generated.<ref name="Sprains and strains">{{cite web|title=Sprains and strains|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/sprains-and-000157.htm|accessdate=2011}}</ref> Proper usage of ice can reduce the destruction over-response which can result from inflammation.<ref name="Sprains and strains"/> A good method is ice 20 minutes of each hour. Other recommendations are an alternation of ice and no-ice for 15–20 minutes each, for a 24–48 hour period.<ref>[http://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/tw4354spec#tp21229 ''RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation for Injuries''] on the website of the [[University of Michigan]] Health System, retrieved 28 July 2008</ref> To prevent localised [[ischemia]] or [[frostbite]] to the skin, it is recommended that the ice be placed within a towel before wrapping around the area.

Exceeding the recommended time for ice application may be detrimental, as blood flow will be too reduced to allow nutrient delivery and waste removal.

=== Compression ===
Compression aims to reduce the [[edematous]] swelling that results from the inflammatory process. Although some swelling is inevitable, too much swelling results in significant loss of function, excessive pain and eventual slowing of blood flow through vessel restriction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

An [[elastic bandage]], rather than a firm plastic bandage (such as zinc-oxide tape) is required. Usage of a tight, non-elastic bandage will result in reduction of adequate blood flow, potentially causing [[ischemia]]. The fit should be snug so as to not move freely, but still allow expansion for when muscles contract and fill with blood.

=== Elevation ===
Elevation aims to reduce swelling by increasing venous return of blood to the systemic circulation. This will not only result in less [[edema]], but also aid in waste product removal from the area.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Alternatives==
As RICE and its variations work{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} by reducing blood flow to the injured area, some people argue that for some types of injuries (such as ligaments and tendons) a protocol that increases blood flow, such as MEAT (Movement, Exercise, Analgesics and Treatments) should be used instead.<ref name="Meat v.
