A '''bite''' is a [[wound]] received from the [[mouth]] (and in particular, the [[teeth]]) of an [[animal]], including humans.
Animals may bite in self-defense, in an attempt to predate food, as well as part of normal interactions. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked. Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses such as [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]]. '''Biting''' is an act that occurs when an animal uses its teeth to pierce another object, including [[food]], [[flesh]] and inanimate matter. A person bitten by an animal potentially carrying [[parvovirus]] or [[rabies virus]] should consult a medical doctor immediately. An animal bite victim may also incur serious bacterial infections of the bone called [[osteomyelitis]] which can become life threatening if untreated, whether or not the animal has [[parvovirus]] or [[rabies virus]]. 

==Classification==
[[File:Mosquito bite from Flickr.jpg|thumb|A mosquito bite]]

Bites are usually classified by the type of creature causing the wound.
Many different creatures are known to bite humans.

===Arthropods===
*[[Spider bite]]
*[[Insect bites and stings]]
**[[Flea bite]]s are responsible for the transmission of [[bubonic plague]].
**[[Mosquito bite]]s are responsible for the transmission of [[dengue fever]] and [[malaria]].

===Vertebrates other than humans ===

*Bites from [[dog]]s are commonplace, with children the most common victims and the face the most common target.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html |title= Dog Bite Statistics |author= Kenneth M. Phillips |date= 2009-12-27 |accessdate= 2010-08-06 }}</ref> About 4.7 million [[dog bite]]s are reported annually in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ Questions and Answers about Dog Bites]</ref>
*Other companion animals, including [[cat]]s, [[ferret]]s, and [[companion parrot|parrots]], may bite humans.
*[[Wildlife]] may sometimes bite humans. The bites of various mammals such as [[bat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[raccoon]]s, etc. may transmit [[rabies]], which is almost always fatal if left untreated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Involuntary biting injuries due to [[closed-fist injuries]] from fists striking teeth (referred to as [[Reverse bite injury|reverse bite injuries]]) are a common consequence of [[Hand to hand combat|fist fights]]. These have been termed "fight bites". Injuries in which the [[knuckle joint]]s or [[tendon]]s of the hand are bitten into tend to be the most serious.

In spite of their name, [[love bite]]s are not biting injuries (they involve bruising from sucking, and the skin is not broken), although actual biting injuries are sometimes seen as the result of fetishistic activities.

===Other===
*[[Snakebite]]
*[[Leech bite]]

==Signs and symptoms==
Bite wounds raise a number of [[medical]] concerns for the [[physician]] or [[first aid]]er including:

*Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching.
*Serious [[hemorrhage]] if major blood vessels are pierced.
*[[Infection]] by [[bacterium|bacteria]] or other [[pathogen]]s, including [[rabies]].
*Introduction of [[Venom (poison)|venom]] into the wound by venomous animals such as some [[snakes]].
*Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing [[inflammation]] and [[itching]].

===Treatment===
Bite wounds should be cleaned and [[Debridement|debrided]] as necessary but not closed. [[Ampicillin/sulbactam]] is indicated as [[HACEK endocarditis]], specifically ''Eikenella'', is the most worrying complication. A punctate wound over a joint surface should be regarded as an [[open joint injury]] until proven otherwise.

==Treatment==
Bite wounds are washed, ideally with povidone-iodine soap and water.  The injury is then loosely bandaged, but is not sutured due to risk of infection.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics prophylaxis is recommended for dog and cat bites of the hand<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1021 |title=BestBets: Antibiotics in cat bites |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> and human bites if they are more than superficial.<ref name="Oehler2009">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70110-0|author=Oehler RL, Velez AP, Mizrachi M, Lamarche J, Gompf S|title=Bite-related and septic syndrome caused by cats and dogs|journal=Lancet Infect Dis|year=2009|volume=9|pages=439&ndash;47|pmid=19555903|issue=7}}</ref>  Evidence for the need for antibiotic prophylaxis for bites in other areas inconclusive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Medeiros I, Saconato H |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD001738 |year=2001 |pmid=11406003 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001738 |url= |editor1-last=Medeiros |editor1-first=Iara Marques}}</ref>

For [[empirical therapy]], the first choice is [[amoxicillin with clavulanic acid]], and if the person is penicillin allergy [[doxycycline]] and [[metronidazole]].<ref name="Oehler2009"/>  The anti-staphylococcal penicillins (e.g., [[cloxacillin]], [[nafcillin]], [[flucloxacillin]]) and the [[macrolide]]s (e.g., [[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]]) are not used for empirical therapy, because they do not cover [[Pasteurella]] species.<ref name="Oehler2009"/>

===Rabies===
Animal bites inflicted by some animals, including [[carnivora]]ns and [[bat]]s can transmit [[rabies]]. The animal is caught alive or dead with its head preserved, so the head can later be analyzed to detect the disease. Signs of rabies include foaming at the mouth, self-mutilation, growling, jerky behavior, and red eyes. 

If the animal cannot be captured, prophylactic rabies treatment is recommended in most places. Certain places, such as [[Hawaii]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]], are known not to have native rabies. Treatment is generally available in [[North America]] and the [[Northern European]] states.

===Tetanus===
[[Tetanus toxoid]] is indicated for virtually any bite that punctures the epidermis and [[tetanus immune globulin]] is indicated in patients with more than 10 years since prior vaccination. Tetanus boosters (Td) should be given every ten years.

===Mosquito bites===

[[Antihistamines]] are effective treatment for the symptoms from bites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1074 |title=BestBets: Oral antihistamines for insect bites |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Many diseases such as [[malaria]] are transmitted by [[mosquitoes]].
