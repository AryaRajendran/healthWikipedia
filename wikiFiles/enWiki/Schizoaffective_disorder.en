'''Schizoaffective disorder''' is a [[psychiatric]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] that describes a [[mental disorder]] characterized by recurring abnormal mood and psychotic components. The mood component may be elevated or depressed (bipolar or depressive subtype), or simultaneously elevated and depressed ([[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episode]]), and these abnormal mood components alternate with, or occur together with, psychotic symptoms. For a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder to be [[validity (statistics)|valid]], according to current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] criteria (but not ICD-10 criteria), there must be a period of at least two weeks of psychosis without mood disorder, and these symptoms cannot be due to medication(s), substance use or another medical condition.<ref>http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/</ref><ref name=DSM-IV>{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text revision)|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-0890420256}}</ref>   In the ICD-10, schizoaffective disorder is seen as episodic, whereas in the DSM-IV it is treated as an uninterrupted illness.<ref name="APP textbook">Hales E and Yudofsky JA, eds, The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003</ref>

Schizoaffective disorder most commonly affects [[cognition]] and emotion. Perceptual disturbances (i.e. [[hallucinations]]) and/or disordered thought processes, including [[delusions]] and [[thought disorder|disorganized speech and thinking]], occur in conjunction with significant social and occupational dysfunction.<ref name=DSM-IV/> The division into depressive and bipolar types is based on whether the individual has ever had a [[mania|manic]], [[hypomanic]] or [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episode]]. Symptoms usually begin in early adulthood; diagnosis prior to age 13 is rare.

Schizoaffective disorder belongs to the "[[schizophrenia spectrum]] and other [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders"<ref>http://www.schres-journal.com/article/S0920-9964%2801%2900349-8/abstract</ref> proposed by the [[DSM-5]] Workgroup, which includes [[schizophrenia]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]], [[schizophreniform disorder]], [[brief psychotic disorder]], [[delusional disorder]], [[Substance-induced psychosis|substance-induced psychotic disorder]], both psychotic and [[catatonia|catatonic]] disorders associated with a general medical condition, both unspecified psychotic and catatonic disorders and other unspecified psychotic disorder.<ref>http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/SchizophreniaSpectrumandOtherPsychoticDisorders.aspx</ref> This spectrum of psychotic disorders is comparable to the [[bipolar spectrum]] in [[bipolar disorder]]. Each named disorder on this continuum shares symptoms with the others, and some professionals, including the working group for the [[DSM-5]], contend that the boundaries are so unclear that separate diagnostic categories are not necessarily warranted.

== Overview ==
The lifetime prevalence of the disorder is probably less than 1 percent, in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 percent.<ref>Kaplan & Saddock. p.501-502</ref> Diagnosis is based on the patient's self-reported experiences and observed behavior. No laboratory test for schizoaffective disorder currently exists, though extensive evidence exists for abnormalities in the metabolism of [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (BH4), [[dopamine]], and [[glutamate]] in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. As a group, individuals with schizoaffective disorder have a more favorable [[prognosis]] than those with [[schizophrenia]], but a worse prognosis than those with other [[mood disorder]]s.<ref>Kaplan & Saddock. p.502</ref>

[[Genetics]], early environment, [[neurobiology]], [[psychological]] and social processes are important contributory factors. Some recreational and prescription drugs may cause or worsen symptoms. Current research is focused on the role of neurobiology, but no single organic cause has been found.

The mainstay of current treatment is [[antipsychotic]] medication combined with [[mood stabilizer]] medication or [[antidepressant]] medication, or both. [[Psychotherapy]], vocational therapy and social/[[psychiatric rehabilitation]] are also important for [[recovery model|recovery]]. In cases where there is risk to self and others, brief involuntary hospitalization may be necessary.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Becker T, Kilian R |title=Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand Suppl |volume=113 | issue=429 |pages=9–16 |year=2006 |pmid=16445476 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x |postscript=.}}</ref>

People with schizoaffective disorder are likely to have [[comorbid]] conditions, including [[anxiety disorder]]s and [[substance abuse]]. Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average [[life expectancy]] of people with the disorder is shorter than those without, due to increased physical health problems and a higher [[suicide]] rate.

The diagnosis was introduced in 1933<ref name=pmid17551352>{{cite journal |author=Lake CR, Hurwitz N |title=Schizoaffective disorder merges schizophrenia and bipolar disorders as one disease - there is no schizoaffective disorder |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=365–79 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17551352 |doi= 10.1097/YCO.0b013e3281a305ab |postscript=.}}</ref> and will be moderately amended<ref>http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=144#</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/703312 |title=Medscape.com Log In |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> in the next [[iteration]] of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) because current diagnostic criteria are [[reliability (statistics)|unreliable]].

==Signs and symptoms==
As schizoaffective disorder represents an attempt to encompass individuals who have features of both [[schizophrenia]] and [[mood disorders]], it does not consist of unique symptoms.<ref name="APP textbook"/>  Instead, patients experience some combination of symptoms of the two types of disorders.  This lack of characteristic symptoms can make diagnosis difficult.

To meet the DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, individuals must experience symptoms that meet criterion A for [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="DSM-IV"/>  These symptoms include [[delusions]], [[hallucinations]], disorganized speech or behaviour, and [[negative symptom]]s.<ref name="DSM-IV"/>  [[Delusions]] and [[hallucinations]] are classic [[psychosis|psychotic]] symptoms which involve a disruption in the boundaries between the patient and the outside world.<ref name="APP textbook"/>  [[Delusions]] are false beliefs which are strongly held despite evidence to the contrary.<ref name="APP textbook"/>  Beliefs should not be considered delusional if they are in keeping with cultural beliefs.  The delusional beliefs may or may not reflect mood symptoms (e.g. someone with depressive symptoms may experience delusions of guilt).  [[Hallucinations]] are disturbances in perception involving any of the five senses, although [[auditory hallucination]]s (or "hearing voices") are the most common.<ref name="APP textbook"/>  [[Negative symptom]]s include lack of spontaneous speech, reduced intensity of outward emotional expression, [[avolition]] (loss of motivation), and [[anhedonia]], or inability to experience pleasure.<ref name="APP textbook"/> Negative symptoms can potentially be quite debilitating.

Mood symptoms can correspond to symptoms of either [[mania]] or [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and tend to be episodic rather than continuous.  A [[mixed episode]] represents a combination of symptoms of mania and depression at the same time.  Symptoms of mania include elevated or irritable mood, grandiosity (inflated self-esteem), agitation, risk-taking behavior, decreased need for sleep, poor concentration, rapid speech, and racing thoughts.<ref name="DSM-IV"/> Symptoms of depression include low mood, apathy, changes in appetite or weight, disturbances in sleep, changes in motor activity, fatigue, guilt or worthlessness, and suicidal thinking.

Two individuals with schizoaffective disorder may experience quite different symptoms, and any given individual will experience fluctuations in the types and intensity of symptoms he or she experiences.  20-30% of people with schizoaffective disorder have a deteriorating course of illness with persistent psychotic symptoms.<ref name="APP textbook"/>  However, others may achieve full symptom control.

==Diagnosis==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
Diagnosis is based on a mental health clinician's observations of an individual's behavior while the client is experiencing active symptoms.  Diagnosis also includes the client's self-reported experiences, as well as abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends or co-workers to a [[psychiatrist]], [[psychiatric nurse]], [[social worker]], [[psychologist]] or [[mental health counselor]] in a clinical assessment. The criteria for diagnosis depend on both the presence and duration of certain signs and symptoms.<ref name=Med_News/><ref name=News-Medical/>

An initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination by a physician. Although there are no biological tests which confirm schizoaffective disorder, tests should be carried out to exclude medical illnesses which rarely may be associated with psychotic symptoms. These include blood tests measuring [[thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] to exclude [[hypothyroidism|hypo-]] or [[hyperthyroidism]], [[Blood tests#Blood chemistry tests|basic electrolytes]] and [[serum calcium]] to rule out a metabolic disturbance, [[complete blood count|full blood count]] including [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease, and [[serology]] to exclude [[syphilis]] or [[HIV]] infection; two commonly ordered investigations  are [[EEG]] to exclude [[epilepsy]], and a [[CT scan]] of the head to exclude brain lesions. It is important to rule out a [[delirium]] which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness and indicates an underlying medical illness.<ref name=Med_News>{{cite news|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/190678.php|accessdate=March 2013|newspaper=Medical News Today|date=02 Jun 2010}}</ref><ref name=News-Medical>{{cite news|title=Schizophrenia Diagnosis|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Schizophrenia-Diagnosis.aspx|accessdate=March 2013|newspaper=News-Medical.net}}</ref>  

Further blood tests are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication.<ref name=News-Medical/> These may include serum [[blood sugar|BSL]] if [[olanzapine]] has previously been prescribed, thyroid function if lithium has previously been taken to rule out [[hypothyroidism]], liver function tests if [[chlorpromazine]] has been prescribed, and [[Creatine kinase|CPK]] levels to exclude [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. Assessment and treatment are usually done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to self or others.

As discussed above, there are several psychiatric disorders and substance-induced psychoses which may present with a similar range of psychotic symptoms.  These include [[bipolar disorder]] with psychotic features, [[major depression]] with psychotic features, prescribed medication-induced psychosis (including from treatment with antidepressants and/or sleeping medication), [[schizophrenia]] and the other [[schizophrenia spectrum]] disorders, illicit drug intoxication and brief illicit drug-induced psychosis. Other conditions that cause psychosis need to be ruled out before a working diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder can be made. A firm diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, using current diagnostic criteria, usually requires a lengthy observation of the illness in patients being treated (often a year or more), because the observed [[symptoms]] of psychosis and mood disorder often turn out to be one of the more common conditions listed above.<ref name=News-Medical/>

It can be difficult to reach an accurate diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, since problems with the [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity]] of the schizoaffective diagnostic criteria have been well known in the diagnostic research literature for over six years (see [[#Controversies and research directions|Controversies and research directions]] below). In the context of schizoaffective disorder, problems with reliability mean that mental health professionals observing the same individual with symptoms of schizoaffective disorder often make different diagnoses, due in part to the ambiguity of this disorder's diagnostic criteria. Problems with validity mean that the current schizoaffective disorder diagnostic criteria do not correspond accurately to patients in the real world, whose symptoms and presentations change over time, and many of whom receive a different diagnosis by the end of their treatment. As stated above, the new [[DSM-5]] diagnostic criteria hope to improve the diagnostic reliability and to reduce the [[frequency]] with which the diagnosis is used.

The most widely-used criteria for diagnosing schizoaffective disorder are from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', the current version being DSM-IV-TR.<ref name=News-Medical/>

===DSM-IV-TR criteria===
The following are the revised criteria for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV-TR):<ref name=DSM-IV/>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-latin">
  <li>Two (or more) of the following symptoms are present for the majority of a one-month period (or a shorter period of time if symptoms improved with treatment):
* [[delusions]]
* [[hallucinations]]
* disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence) which is a manifestation of [[thought disorder|formal thought disorder]]
* grossly disorganized behavior (e.g. dressing inappropriately, crying frequently) or [[catatonic]] behavior
* [[negative symptoms]]—e.g., [[affective flattening]] (lack or decline in emotional response), [[alogia]] (lack or decline in speech), [[avolition]] (lack or decline in motivation), [[anhedonia]] (lack or decline in ability to experience pleasure), social withdrawal (sometimes called social anhedonia). Negative symptoms refers to symptoms that are not present or that are diminished in the affected individual but are usually found in healthy persons.<ref>http://www.minddisorders.com/Kau-Nu/Negative-symptoms.html</ref>
If the delusions are judged to be bizarre, or hallucinations consist of hearing one voice participating in a running commentary of the individual's actions or of hearing two or more voices conversing with each other, only that symptom is required to meet criterion A above. The speech disorganization criterion is only met if it is severe enough to substantially impair communication ''and'' at some time during the illness there is either one, two or all three of the following:

* [[major depressive episode]]
* [[manic episode]]
* [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episode]]</li>
  <li>During the illness, delusions or hallucinations were present for a minimum of  two weeks, without major mood symptoms.</li>
  <li>For a substantial part of the overall duration of both the active and residual period of the illness, symptoms meeting criteria for a mood episode are present.</li>
  <li>Symptoms are not caused by drug abuse, medication '''(including antidepressant or sleeping medication)''' or another medical condition.</li></ol>

===Subtypes===
Two subtypes of schizoaffective disorder exist and may be noted in a diagnosis based on the mood component of the disorder:

==== Bipolar type ====
If the disturbance includes:
* a [[manic episode]]
* a [[mixed episode]]

Major depressive episodes usually, but not always, also occur in the bipolar subtype, however they are not required for DSM-IV diagnosis.

==== Depressive type ====
The depressive type is noted when the disturbance includes major depressive episodes exclusively (without manic or mixed episodes).

===Controversies and research directions===
The categorical distinction between mood disorders and schizophrenia, known as the [[Kraepelinian dichotomy]], has been challenged by data from genetic epidemiology for over seven years.<ref name="Craddock N, Owen MJ 2005 364–6">{{cite journal |author=Craddock N, Owen MJ |title=The beginning of the end for the Kraepelinian dichotomy |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=186 |issue=5 |pages=364–6 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15863738 |doi=10.1192/bjp.186.5.364 |postscript=.}}</ref> Some clinical researchers also have concluded that schizoaffective disorder is an intermediate form of psychosis and mood disorder, and that the [[Kraepelinian dichotomy]] is mistaken.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lake CR, Hurwitz N |title=Schizoaffective disorder merges schizophrenia and bipolar disorders as one disease--there is no schizoaffective disorder |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=365–79 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17551352 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3281a305ab |postscript=.}}</ref> Furthermore, some diagnostic researchers and clinicians state that the diagnostic term, "schizoaffective disorder," refers to an [[ambiguity|ambiguously]] defined condition that leads to diagnoses based on [[confirmation bias]] and have recommended that the term be removed from or amended in future diagnostic manuals.<ref name=pmid18199238>{{cite journal |author=Malhi GS, Green M, Fagiolini A, Peselow ED, Kumari V |title=Schizoaffective disorder: diagnostic issues and future recommendations |journal=Bipolar Disorders |volume=10 |issue=1 Pt 2 |pages=215–30 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18199238 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00564.x |postscript=.}}</ref>

With regard to making a schizoaffective diagnosis on a patient, poor [[interrater reliability]] (or agreement among clinicians making the diagnosis), and problems with the [[validity (statistics)|validity]] of the diagnostic criteria, has led some psychiatrists, including leaders in schizoaffective disorder diagnostic research, to conclude that the diagnosis should be removed from future diagnostic criteria.<ref name=psych.org/><ref name="OnTrack" />

In April 2009, the DSM-5 Psychotic Disorders Work Group headed by psychiatrist [[William T. Carpenter|William T. Carpenter MD]] of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] School of Medicine, reported that they will be "developing new criteria for schizoaffective disorder to improve [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[face validity]]," and that they will be "determining whether the dimensional assessment of mood will justify a recommendation to drop schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category."<ref name=psych.org/> Speaking to an audience at the May 2009 annual conference of the [[American Psychiatric Association]], Carpenter was quoted in a Medscape article (emphasis added): <blockquote>"'We had hoped to get rid of schizoaffective [disorder] as a diagnostic category because '''we don't think it's valid''' and '''we don't think it's reliable'''. On the other hand, we think it's absolutely indispensable to clinical practice,' he added wryly, drawing a laugh from the audience."<ref name="OnTrack" /></blockquote>One reason the diagnosis may be indispensable to clinical practice is simply because the diagnosis gives clinicians a placeholder, or [[working diagnosis]], that describes currently observable [[symptomatology]] (that may be submitted to patients' health insurance) until a more [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]] diagnosis can be reached, which may or may not be ultimately be the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.

==Cause==
Although the causes of schizoaffective disorder are unknown, it is suspected that a [[validity (statistics)|valid]] diagnosis represents a heterogeneous group of individuals, some with aberrant forms of schizophrenia and some with very serious forms of mood disorders. There is little evidence that schizoaffective disorder is a distinct variety of psychotic illness. Consequently, the disorder appears to be [[comorbid]] or (co-occurring) schizophrenia and mood disorder. Schizoaffective disorder thus appears to exist on a continuum in-between schizophrenia and severe bipolar disorder and severe recurrent unipolar depression. It follows then that the [[etiology]] is probably more similar to that of schizophrenia in some cases and more similar to severe mood disorders in other cases.

Many different genes may be contributing to the genetic risk of acquiring this illness. In addition, many different biological and environmental factors are believed to interact with the person's genes in ways which can increase or decrease the person's risk for developing schizoaffective disorder. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (of which schizoaffective disorder is a part) have been marginally linked to advanced [[paternal age]] at the time of conception, a known cause of genetic mutations, but this link between paternal age and schizoaffective disorder is not robust.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown AS, Schaefer CA, Wyatt RJ, et al. |title=Paternal age and risk of schizophrenia in adult offspring |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=159 |issue=9 |pages=1528–33 |year=2002 |month= September |pmid=12202273 |pmc=2989614 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.9.1528 |postscript=.}}</ref>

The physiology of patients diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder appears to be similar but not identical to that of those diagnosed with schizophrenia and severe bipolar disorder, but research on the physiology of these disorders is still in its early stages.<ref name=pmid18056246>{{cite journal |author=Martin LF, Hall MH, Ross RG, Zerbe G, Freedman R, Olincy A |title=Physiology of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=12 |pages=1900–6 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18056246 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06010017 |postscript=.}}</ref>

===Substance abuse===
{{See also|Dual diagnosis}}
A clear causal connection between drug use and psychotic spectrum disorders, including schizoaffective disorder, has been difficult to prove. In the specific case of marijuana or [[cannabis]], however, evidence is mounting that it can play a role in the development and [[morbidity]] of psychotic disorders, including schizoaffective disorder.<ref name="Moore TH, Zammit S, Lingford-Hughes A, et al. 2005 187-94">{{cite journal |author=Moore TH, Zammit S, Lingford-Hughes A, et al. |title=Cannabis use and risk of psychotic or affective mental health outcomes: a systematic review |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9584 |pages=187–94 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=17662880 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61162-3 |postscript=.}}</ref><ref name="Semple2005">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0269881105049040 |author=Semple DM, McIntosh AM, Lawrie SM |title=Cannabis as a risk factor for psychosis: systematic review |journal=J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford) |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=187–94 |year=2005 |month= March |pmid=15871146 |postscript=.}}</ref> For example, a 2007 [[meta-analysis]] showed that cannabis use is [[association (statistics)|statistically associated]] with a [[dose-response relationship|dose-dependent]] increase in risk of development of psychotic disorders, including schizoaffective disorder.<ref name="Moore TH, Zammit S, Lingford-Hughes A, et al. 2005 187-94"/> Moreover, a 2005 [[meta-analysis]] found that cannabis use is a significant independent risk factor for developing psychotic symptoms and psychosis.<ref name="Semple2005" /> Finally, a 2009 Yale study stated that it is clear
<blockquote>"that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, [[cannabinoids]] can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness."<ref>{{cite journal |author=D'Souza DC, Sewell RA, Ranganathan M |title=Cannabis and psychosis/schizophrenia: human studies |journal=Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19609589 |doi=10.1007/s00406-009-0024-2 |volume=259 |issue=7 |pages=413–31 |pmc=2864503 |postscript=.}}</ref></blockquote>

On the other hand, an opposing 2008 [[meta-analysis]] concluded: "Confidence that most associations reported were specifically due to cannabis is low. Despite clinical opinion, it remains important to establish whether cannabis is harmful, what outcomes are particularly susceptible, and how such effects are mediated."<ref>{{cite journal |author= Zammit S, Moore TH, Lingford-Hughes A, Barnes TR, Jones PB, Burke M, Lewis G |title=Effects of cannabis use on outcomes of psychotic disorders: systematic review |journal=Br J.

There is little evidence to suggest that other drugs including alcohol cause schizoaffective disorder, or that psychotic individuals choose specific drugs to self-medicate; there is some support for the theory that they use drugs to cope with unpleasant states such as depression, anxiety, boredom and loneliness.<ref name=Gregg_et_al_2007>{{cite journal |author= Gregg L, Barrowclough C, Haddock G |title=Reasons for increased substance use in psychosis |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=494–510 |year=2007 |month= May |pmid=17240501 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2006.09.004 |postscript= .}}</ref> However, regarding [[psychosis]] itself, it is well understood that [[methamphetamine]] and [[cocaine]] use can result in methamphetamine or cocaine-induced psychosis which presents very similar symptomatology and may persist even when users remain abstinent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mahoney JJ, Kalechstein AD, De La Garza R, Newton TF |title=Presence and persistence of psychotic symptoms in cocaine- versus methamphetamine-dependent participants |journal=The American Journal on Addictions |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=83–98 |year=2008 |pmid=18393050 |doi=10.1080/10550490701861201 |postscript=.}}</ref>  Alcohol-induced psychosis can also persist during abstinence, though it appears to do so at a lower rate.<ref name=alcohol>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3113.htm |title=Alcohol-Related Psychosis |accessdate=September 27, 2006 |last=Larson |first=Michael |date=2006-03-30 |work=eMedicine |publisher=WebMD}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Soyka |first=Michael |year=1990 |month=March |title=Psychopathological characteristics in alcohol hallucinosis and paranoid schizophrenia |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=255–9 | pmid = 2343749 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb06491.x}}</ref><ref name=Gossman_2005>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic123.htm |title=Delirium Tremens |accessdate=October 16, 2006 |last=Gossman |first=William |date=November 19, 2005 |work=eMedicine |publisher=WebMD}}</ref>

==Management==
Few medications are approved specifically for use in schizoaffective disorder.<ref name="BMJ best practice">BMJ Group, [http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/1199/treatment/step-by-step.html "Schizoaffective disorders: Treatment"], 2012</ref> Instead, medications are chosen to treat the symptoms rather than the diagnostic label.

The bipolar subtype of schizoaffective disorder has been referred to by Stahl<ref name="Stahl"/> as "bipolar 1/2" or "schizobipolar disorder", and as such, the management of mood symptoms is similar to [[treatment of bipolar disorder]].  [[Lithium (medication)]] or [[anti-convulsant]]s such as [[valproic acid]],<ref name=pmid11773657>{{cite journal |author=Flynn J, Grieger TA, Benedek DM |title=Pharmacologic treatment of hospitalized patients with schizoaffective disorder |journal=Psychiatric Services (Washington, D.C.) |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=94–6 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11773657 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.53.1.94 |postscript=.}}</ref> [[carbamazepine]], and [[lamotrigine]] are [[mood stabilizer]]s that can be used in managing the mood symptoms of schizoaffective disorder.<ref name="BMJ best practice" />

Psychosocial treatments are an important part of managing schizoaffective disorder.  Supportive psychotherapy and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] are both useful.<ref name="BMJ best practice"/>  Intensive case management (ICM) has been shown to reduce hospitalizations, improve adherence to treatment, and improve social functioning.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dieterich M, Irving CB Park B et al | title=Intensive Case Management for Severe Mental Illness | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume=10 | issue=CD007906 | year=2010 }}</ref>  With ICM, clients are assigned a case manager responsible for coordination of care and assisting clients to access supports to address needs in multiple areas related to well-being, including housing.

==Complications==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
Complications are similar to those for schizophrenia and major mood disorders. These include:
* Problems following medical treatment and therapy.
* Use of unsanctioned drugs in an attempt to self-medicate.
* Short-term side effects and problems arising from long-term use of prescribed medications, including drug interactions.
* Problems resulting from manic behavior (for example: spending sprees, sexual indiscretion, criminal activity).
* Suicidal behavior due to depressive and/or psychotic symptoms.

==Epidemiology==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
Estimates of the prevalence of schizoaffective disorder vary widely, but schizoaffective manic patients appear to comprise 3-5% of psychiatric admissions to typical clinical centers. At one point it was widely believed that schizoaffective disorder was associated with increased risk of mood disorders in relatives. This may have been because of the number of patients with psychotic mood disorders who were included in schizoaffective study populations.

The current diagnostic criteria define a group of individuals with a mixed genetic picture. They are more likely to have schizophrenic relatives than individuals with mood disorders but more likely to have relatives with mood disorders than individuals with schizophrenia.

==History==
The term ''schizoaffective psychosis'' was introduced by the American psychiatrist [[Jacob Kasanin]] in 1933<ref name=pmid16857267>{{cite journal |author=Lake CR, Hurwitz N |title= Schizoaffective disorders are psychotic mood disorders; there are no schizoaffective disorders |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=143 |issue=2-3 |pages=255–87 |year=2006 |month= August |pmid=16857267 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2005.08.012 |postscript=.}}</ref> to describe an episodic psychotic illness with predominant affective symptoms, that was thought at the time to be a good-prognosis schizophrenia.<ref>Goodwin & Jamison. p. 102</ref> Kasanin's concept of the illness was influenced by the [[psychoanalytic]] teachings of [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] and Kasanin postulated that ''schizoaffective psychosis'' was caused by "emotional conflicts" of a "mainly sexual nature" and that psychoanalysis "would help prevent the recurrence of such attacks."<ref name="Goodwin & Marneros. p190">Goodwin & Marneros. p. 190</ref> He based his description on a case study of nine individuals.<ref name="Goodwin & Marneros. p190"/>

Other psychiatrists, before and after Kasanin, have made scientific observations of schizoaffective disorder based on assumptions of a biological and genetic [[etiology]] of the illness. In 1863, German psychiatrist [[Karl Kahlbaum]] (1828–1899) described schizoaffective disorders as a separate group in his ''vesania typica circularis''.<ref name="Goodwin & Marneros. p189">Goodwin & Marneros. p189</ref> Kahlbaum distinguished between cross-sectional and longitudinal observations. ('''Cross-sectional''' refers to observation of a single, specific episode of the illness, for example, one episode of psychotic depression; while '''longitudinal''' refers to long-term observation of many distinct episodes [similar or different] often occurring over the span of years.) In 1920, psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926), the founder of contemporary scientific [[psychiatry]], observed a "great number" of cases that had characteristics of both groups of psychoses that he originally posited were two distinct and separate illnesses, ''dementia praecox'' (now called schizophrenia) and ''manic depressive insanity'' (now called bipolar disorder and recurrent depression).<ref name="Goodwin & Marneros. p190">Goodwin & Marneros. p190</ref>

Kraeplin acknowledged that "there are many overlaps in this area", that is, the area between schizophrenia and severe mood disorders.<ref>Marneros & Akiskal. pp. 3-4</ref> In 1959, psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] (1887–1967) can be said to have been the first to begin to conceptualize the different forms that schizoaffective disorders can take since he observed "concurrent and sequential types".<ref name="Goodwin & Marneros. p190"/> (The ''concurrent type'' of illness he referred to is a longitudinal course of illness with episodes of mood disorder and psychosis occurring predominantly at the same time; while his ''sequential type'' refers to a longitudinal course predominantly marked by alternating mood and psychotic episodes.)<ref name="Goodwin & Marneros. p189"/> Schneider described schizoaffective disorders as "cases in-between" the traditional [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelinian]] dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorders.<ref name="Goodwin & Marneros. p189"/>

The historical [[phenomenology (science)|phenomenological]] observation that schizoaffective disorder is an overlap of schizophrenia and severe mood disorders has more recently been assumed to be explained by genes for both illnesses being present in individuals with schizoaffective disorder. In support of this assumption, recent research shows that schizophrenia and severe mood disorders appear to share '''common genes''' ''and'' '''polygenic variations''' also.<ref name="Craddock N, Owen MJ 2005 364–6"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Snellenberg JX, de Candia T |title=Meta-analytic evidence for familial coaggregation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder |journal=Arch.

Schizoaffective disorder was included as a subtype of schizophrenia in DSM-I and DSM-II, though research showed a schizophrenic cluster of symptoms in individuals with a family history of mood disorders whose illness course, other symptoms and treatment outcome were otherwise more akin to bipolar disorder than to schizophrenia. DSM-III placed schizoaffective disorder in "Psychotic Disorders Not Otherwise Specified" before being formally recognized in DSM-III-R.<ref name="Goodwin & Jamison. p96">Goodwin & Jamison. p. 96</ref> DSM-III-R included its own diagnostic criteria as well as the subtypes, bipolar and depressive.<ref name="Goodwin & Jamison. p96"/> In DSM-IV, published in 1994, schizoaffective disorders belonged to the category "Other Psychotic Disorders" and included almost the same criteria and the same subtypes of illness as DSM-III-R, with the addition of mixed bipolar symptomatology.<ref>Goodwin & Marneros. p. 192</ref>
