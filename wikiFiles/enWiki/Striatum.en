The '''striatum''', also known as the '''neostriatum''' or '''striate nucleus''', is a subcortical (i.e., inside, rather than on the outside) part of the [[forebrain]]. It is the major input station of the [[basal ganglia system]]. The striatum, in turn, gets input from the [[cerebral cortex]]. In primates (including humans), the striatum is divided by a [[white matter]] tract called the [[internal capsule]] into two sectors called the [[caudate nucleus]] and [[putamen]]. The term '''corpus striatum''' occasionally refers to the striatum combined with the [[globus pallidus]], a structure closely related to the putamen, and the [[lenticular nucleus]] refers to the putamen together with the globus pallidus.<ref name="urlDBS: The Basal Ganglia">{{cite web |url=http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2003_Groups/Deep_Brain_Stimulation/basalganglia.html |title=DBS: The Basal Ganglia |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==History==

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the term "corpus striatum" was used to designate many distinct, deep, infracortical elements of the hemisphere.<ref>[[Raymond Vieussens]], 1685</ref> In 1941, [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier|Cécile]] and [[Oskar Vogt|Oskar]] Vogt simplified the nomenclature by proposing the term striatum for all elements built with striatal elements (see [[primate basal ganglia system]]): the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]], the [[putamen]], and the fundus striati, that ventral part linking the two preceding together ventrally to the inferior part of the [[internal capsule]].

The term ''neostriatum'' was forged by comparative anatomists comparing the subcortical structures between vertebrates, because it was thought to be a phylogenetically newer section of the corpus striatum. The term is still used by some sources, including [[Medical Subject Headings]].<ref>{{MeshName|Neostriatum}}</ref>

==Cell types==
The striatum is [[wikt:heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] in terms of its component [[neuron]]s. <ref>Tepper JM, Tecuapetla F, Koós T, Ibáñez-Sandoval O.

PMID: 21228905</ref> 
*Spiny projection neurons, commonly referred to as '''[[medium spiny neurons]]''', are the principal neurons of the striatum. They are [[GABAergic]] and thus are classified as inhibitory neurons. Depending on the species, spiny projection neurons comprise 90-95% of the total neuronal population.
*'''[[acetylcholine|Cholinergic]] [[interneurons]]''' release acetylcholine, which has a variety of important effects in the striatum. In humans, non-human primates and rodents, these interneurons respond to salient environmental stimuli with stereotyped responses which are temporally aligned with the responses of dopaminergic neurons of the [[substantia nigra]]. <ref>Goldberg JA, Reynolds JN.

===Anatomical subdivisions===

[[File:Striatum Structural MRI.png|thumb|200px|alt=This is a transverse section of the striatum from a structural [[MRI|MR image]]. The striatum includes the [[caudate nucleus]] and [[putamen]]. The image also includes the [[globus pallidus]], which is sometimes included when using the term corpus striatum.|This is a transverse section of the striatum from a structural [[MRI|MR image]]. The striatum includes the [[caudate nucleus]] (red, ''top'') and [[putamen]] (red, ''right''). The image also includes the [[globus pallidus]] (red, ''lower left''), which is sometimes included when using the term corpus striatum.]]

The observable anatomical subdivisions of the dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) essentially induced by the internal capsule do not completely overlap with now accepted anatomo-functional subdivisions. The selective distribution of the axonal terminal arborisations of cortical sources differentiate the sensorimotor striatum, mainly putaminal but located in its dorsal part and in the lateroinferior part of the caudate. A great part of the remaining of the volume (essentially caudate) receiving from axonal endings from the frontal, parietal, temporal cortex forms the associative striatum. The separation between these two territories is rather clearcut and observable using [[calbindin]] immunochemistry. A third entity, the most inferomedial, raises more problems as there is no general agreement about its border with the associative striatum. 

The striatum can also be differentiated based on immunochemical characteristics&mdash;particularly with regard to [[acetylcholinesterase]]&mdash;into "compartments", consisting of 'striosomes' and 'matrisomes'.

===Inputs (afferent connections)===
The most important afferent in terms of quantity of axons is the [[corticostriatal]] connection. Many parts of the neocortex innervate the dorsal striatum. The cortical [[pyramidal neurons]]  projecting to the striatum are located in layers II-VI, but the most dense projections come from layer V.<ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0168-0102(99)00060-7 |author = Rosell A, Giménez-Amaya JM |title=Anatomical re-evaluation of the corticostriatal projections to the caudate nucleus: a retrograde labeling study in the cat |journal=Neurosci Res |year=1999 |volume=34 |pages=257–69 |pmid=10576548 |issue = 4}}</ref>  They end mainly on the spines of the spiny neurons. They are [[glutamatergic]], exciting striatal neurons.
Another well known afferent is the [[nigrostriatal]] connection arising from the neurons of the [[substantia nigra]] pars compacta. While cortical axons synapse mainly on spine heads of spiny neurons, nigral axons synapse mainly on spine shafts.
In primates, the thalamostriatal afferent essentially comes from the center median-parafascicular complex of the [[thalamus]] (see [[primate basal ganglia system]]). This afferent is glutamatergic. The participation of truly intralaminar neurons is much more limited.
The striatum also receives afferents from other elements of the basal ganglia such as the [[subthalamic nucleus]] (glutamatergic) or the external [[globus pallidus]] ([[GABA]]ergic).

===Targets (efferent connections)===
The basal ganglia core is made up of the striatum along with the regions to which it projects directly, via the striato-pallidonigral bundle. The striato-pallidonigral bundle is a very dense bundle of sparsely myelinated axons, giving a whitish appearance. This projection comprises successively the external globus pallidus ('''GPe'''), the internal globus pallidus ('''GPi'''), the [[pars compacta]] of the [[substantia nigra]] ('''SNc''') and the [[pars reticulata]] of substantia nigra ('''SNr'''). The neurons of this projection are inhibited by GABAergic synapses from the dorsal striatum. Among these targets, the GPe does not send axons outside the system. Others send axons to the [[superior colliculus]]. Two others comprise the output to the thalamus, forming two separate channels: one through the internal segment of the globus pallidus to the ventral oralis nuclei of the thalamus and from there to the cortical [[supplementary motor area]] ('''SMA''') and another through the substantia nigra to the ventral anterior nuclei of the thalamus and from there to the [[frontal cortex]] and the occulomotor cortex.

==Function==
[[Metabotropic]] [[dopamine receptors]] are present both on spiny neurons and on cortical axon terminals. [[Second messenger]] cascades triggered by activation of these dopamine receptors can modulate pre- and postsynaptic function, both in the short term and in the long term.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
The striatum is best known for its role in the planning and modulation of movement pathways but is also potentially involved in a variety of other cognitive processes involving [[executive function]], such as [[working memory]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of United States of America (PNAS)|last=Voytek|first=Bradley|coauthors=Knight, Robert T.|title=Prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia contributions to working memory |date = 19 October 2010 |volume = 107|issue=42|pages=18167=18172|doi=10.1073/pnas.1007277107}}</ref>
In humans the striatum is activated by stimuli associated with reward, but also by aversive, novel, unexpected or intense stimuli, and cues associated with such events. Recent [[fMRI]] evidence <ref>{{cite journal|last=LUNA|first=BEATRIZ|coauthors=SWEENEY, JOHN A.|title=The Emergence of Collaborative Brain Function: fMRI Studies of the Development of Response Inhibition|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=1 June 2004|volume=1021|issue=1|pages=296–309|doi=10.1196/annals.1308.035}}</ref> suggests that the common property linking these stimuli, to which the striatum is reacting, is [[Salience (neuroscience)|saliency]] under the conditions of presentation. A number of other brain areas and circuits are also related to reward such as frontal areas. [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0806/08062502|Further Research] at the [[Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging]] at UCL ([[University College London]]) shows it to be associated with novelty-related decision making behaviors.

For sources regarding saliency of the reward pathway (thought to be related to dopamine) one can look to the work of Dr. John D. Salamone (early to late 1990s) and Wolfram Schultz.<ref name="urlDepartment of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience: About the Department">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/staff/schultz/ |title=Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience: About the Department |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> The [[Ventral tegmental area|ventral tegmental]] dopaminergic neurons that innervate portions of the striatum have long been accepted to be the site of rewarding feeling.  Intracranial stimulation studies from the 1960s show implants in this brain area will elicit bar pressing from rats for many hours at a time.
However the collective works of researchers in the 1990s show that blocking dopamine receptors does not remove rewarding sensations, rather it affects how much the animal is willing to work, triggering more motivation to seek eventual reward rather than immediate reward.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Pathology==

===Parkinson's disease===
[[Parkinson's disease]] results in loss of dopaminergic innervation to the striatum (and other basal ganglia) and a cascade of subsequent consequences.  [[Atrophy]] of the striatum is also involved in [[Huntington's disease]], [[Choreia (disease)|choreas]], [[choreoathetosis]], and [[dyskinesias]].<ref name="lancetseminar">{{cite journal |author=Walker FO |title=Huntington's disease |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=218–28 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17240289 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1 |url=}}</ref> It is also thought that [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] involves plasticity at striatal synapses.

===Bipolar disorder===
There is an association between striatal expression of the PDE10A gene and some [[bipolar disorder]] I patients.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121010151422.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29 Science Daily: Scientists pinpoint gene variations linked to higher risk of bipolar disorder]</ref>
