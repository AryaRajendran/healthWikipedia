'''''Plasmodium ovale''''' is a species of [[parasite|parasitic]] [[protozoa]] that causes tertian [[malaria]] in humans.  It is closely related to ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'', which are responsible for most malaria.  It is rare compared to these two parasites, and substantially less dangerous than ''P. falciparum''. 

'''''P.&nbsp;ovale''''' has recently been shown by genetic methods to consist of two subspecies, ''[[Plasmodium ovale curtisi|P. ovale curtisi]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium ovale wallikeri|P. ovale wallikeri]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/652240|title=Two nonrecombining sympatric forms of the human malaria parasite ''Plasmodium ovale'' occur globally|author=Sutherland CJ, Tanomsing N, Nolder D, Oguike M, Jennison C, Pukrittayakamee S, Dolecek C, Hien TT, do Rosário VE, Arez AP, Pinto J, Michon P, Escalante AA, Nosten F, Burke M, Lee R, Blaze M, Otto TD, Barnwell JW, Pain A, Williams J, White NJ, Day NP, Snounou G, Lockhart PJ, Chiodini PL, Imwong M, Polley SD|journal=J Infect Dis|year=2010|volume=201|issue=10|pages=1544&ndash;50|pmid=20380562}}</ref>

==History==

This species was first described by Stephens in a patient from East Africa in 1922.<ref name=Stephens1922>Stephens JWW (1922) A new malaria parasite of man. Ann Trop Med Parasitol 16: 383–388. doi: 10.1098/rspb.1914.0024</ref>

The reported prevalence is low (<5%) with the exception of West Africa, where prevalences above 10% have been observed.

The epidemiology of this parasite is in need of updating because the most recent global map of its distribution was produced in 1969.<ref name="Lysenko1969">{{cite journal |author=Lysenko AJ, Beljaev AE |title=An analysis of the geographical distribution of Plasmodium ovale |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=383–94 |year=1969 |pmid=5306622 |pmc=2554635 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

It has been estimated that there are about 15 million cases of infection each year with this parasite.<ref name=Sutherland2010>Sutherland CJ, Tanomsing N, Nolder D, Oguike M, Jennison C, ''et al''. (2010) Two nonrecombining sympatric forms of the human malaria parasite ''Plasmodium ovale'' occur globally. J Infect Dis 201: 1544–155</ref>

==Clinical features==

The prepatent period in the human ranges from 12 to 20 days. Some forms in the liver have delayed development and relapse may occur after periods of up to 4 years after infection. 

The developmental cycle in the blood lasts approximately 49 h. An examination of records from induced infections indicated that there were an average of 10.3 fever episodes of > or = 101 degrees F and 4.5 fever episodes of > or = 104 degrees F. Mean maximum parasite levels were 6,944/microl for sporozoite-induced infections and 7,310/microl for trophozoite-induced infections.

===Diagnosis===

The microscopic appearance of ''P. ovale'' is very similar to that of ''P. vivax'' and if there are only a small number of parasites seen, it may be impossible to distinguish the two species on morphological grounds alone.  There is no difference between the medical treatment of ''P. ovale'' and ''P. vivax'', and therefore some laboratory diagnoses report "''P.&nbsp;vivax/ovale''", which is perfectly acceptable as treatment for the two are very similar. [[Schüffner's dots]] are seen on the surface of the parasitised [[red blood cell]], but these are larger and darker than in ''P. vivax'' and are sometimes called "James's dots".  About twenty percent of the parasitised cells are oval in shape (hence the species name) and some of the oval cells also have fimbriated edges (the so-called "comet cell").  The mature [[wiktionary:schizont|schizonts]] of ''P. ovale'' never have more than twelve nuclei within them and this is the only reliable way of distinguishing between the two species.

''[[Plasmodium vivax|P. vivax]]'' and ''P. ovale'' that has been sitting in [[EDTA]] for more than half-an-hour before the blood film is made will look very similar in appearance to ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]'', which is an important reason to warn the laboratory immediately when the blood sample is drawn so they can process the sample as soon as it arrives.

===Treatment===

Standard treatment is concurrent treatment with [[chloroquine]] and [[primaquine]]. The combination [[atovaquone-proguanil]] may be used in those patients who are unable to take [[chloroquine]] for whatever reason.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg|year=1996|volume=90|issue=6|pages=682|title=Atovaquone plus proguanil is an effective treatment for ''Plasmodium ovale'' and ''P. malariae malaria''|author=Radloff PD, Philipps J, Hutchinson D, Kremsner PG|pmid=9015517|doi=10.1016/S0035-9203(96)90435-6}}</ref>

==Phylogenetics==

Among the species infecting the great apes, ''[[Plasmodium schwetzi]]'' morphologically appears to be the closest relation to ''P.ovale''. {{As of|2013}} this had not been confirmed by DNA studies. 

The original species has been shown to be two morphologically identical forms - ''[[Plasmodium ovale curtisi]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium ovale wallikeri]]'' - which can be differentiated only by genetic means.<ref name="Sutherland2010">{{cite journal |author=Sutherland CJ, Tanomsing N, Nolder D, ''et al.'' |title=Two nonrecombining sympatric forms of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium ovale occur globally |journal=J.

The separation of the lineages is estimated to have occurred between 1.0 and 3.5 million years ago in hominid hosts.

==Life Cycle==

===Human Infection===

===Liver Stage===

The ''P. ovale'' sporozoite enters a hepatocyte and begins its exoerythrocytic schizogony stage.  This is characterized by multiple rounds of nuclear division without cellular segmentation.  After a certain number of nuclear divisions, the parasite cell will segment and [[merozoites]] are formed. 

There are situations where some of the sporozoites do not immediately start to grow and divide after entering the hepatocyte, but remain in a dormant, [[hypnozoite]] stage for weeks or months. The duration of latency is variable from one hypnozoite to another and the factors that will eventually trigger growth are not known; this explains how a single infection can be responsible for a series of waves of parasitaemia or "relapses".<ref name="1.4">{{cite web

While similar to ''P. vivax'', ''P. ovale'' is able to infect individuals who are negative for the Duffy [[blood group]], which is the case for many residents of sub Saharan Africa. This explains the greater prevalence of ''P. ovale'' (rather than ''P. vivax'') in most of Africa.
