[[Ultrasonography]] of leg veins is a non-invasive procedure that gives information about the [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[pathology]] of both the superficial and the deep venous systems.{{sfn|SVU|2011}}

As with heart ultrasound studies, venous ultrasonography requires an understanding of [[hemodynamics]], in order to give useful examination reports, of quality.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|pp=19–28}} Specialized training in venous ultrasonography is not undertaken in some countries, which undermines best practice.{{sfn|WHO|1998|pp=7–8}}

Since lower limbs venous ultrasonography does not involve the use of [[ionizing radiation]], the procedure is harmless and can be safely used on anybody, of any age. Preparation by the individual is not normally required. Sometimes though a complementary study of the abdominal veins is requested, in which case, the person is asked to fast for 12 hours beforehand. The [[sensitivity and specificity]] measurements are approximately 90%. Although the equipment itself is very expensive, the actual examinations are not. This technique is the first choice to confirm venous pathology diagnoses.{{sfn|WHO|1998|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Belem|Nogueira|Schettino|Barros|2004|}}

In chronic venous insufficiency, this examination is of most benefit in confirming varicose disease, allowing a proper assessment of the hemodynamics, and in enabling the charting of disease progression and response to treatment. The detection of competent [[perforator vein]]s may be as important as the detection of incompetent ones. Mapping<ref group="nb">Mapping is a schematic depiction of the venous anatomic-functional configuration in an individual</ref> of the venous system is essential in the understanding of the condition in any individual. This map enables vascular surgeons to plan interventions, in a stage known as virtual dissection.<ref group="nb">Virtual dissection is a schema based on veinous mapping where the surgeon projects what he will do to treat his patient. Drawn on paper, after the ultrasound examination, it will be drawn over the patient's skin before surgery.</ref>{{sfn|Galeandro|Quistelli|Scicchitano|Gesualdo|2012|}}

== Equipment ==
[[File:UltrasoundProbe2006a.jpg|thumb|270px|High frequency probe used for superficial ultrasonography]]
The ultrasound equipment must be of sufficiently high quality in order to give a correct [[signal processing|image treatment]] which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to deliver both [[doppler effect|doppler]] and [[signal processing|color]]. The choice of a probe will depend on the depth needed to be studied. For example, the superficial venous system (SVS) can be very well examined using a high frequency probe of 12&nbsp;MHz. For  patients who have thick [[adipose tissue]] a probe of 7.5&nbsp;MHz will be required. Deep veins require probes of around 6&nbsp;MHz whilst the abdominal vessels are better studied with probes of between 4 and 6&nbsp;MHz.{{sfn|Markowitz|1981}} In summary, three probes are needed together with a top level scanner which makes it a very expensive piece of equipment. Also, the proper use of the scanner
calls for a high level of expertise, so that the examiner must be well qualified and experienced in order to give effective results. In contrast to arterial ultrasonography the wall of the vein is not relevant and importance is given to the  hemodynamic conclusions that the examiner can obtain in order to provide a valuable report. It follows that the  examiner knowledge of venous hemodynamics is crucial, which is a real barrier to a radiologist untrained in this field, who might wish to carry out these examinations.{{sfn|Cina|Pedicelli|Di Stasi|Porcelli|2005}}{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|pp=21–8}}

== Indications ==
The purpose of this examination is focused mainly on the study of two different [[pathology|pathologies]]; [[varicose veins|venous insufficiency]], and [[venous thrombosis]].{{sfn|WHO|1998|pp=51–2}}{{sfn|Cavezzi|Labropoulos|Partsch|Ricci|2006|}} It allows the examiner to evaluate properly:
*Superficial and deep venous network anatomy, mainly topographic anatomy.
*Blood flow direction - extremely important in vein pathology.
*The presence of a retrograde blood flow (the inverse of the physiological direction, also called anterograde blood flow).<ref group="nb">The anterograde blood flow or physiological blood flow in veins is from periphery to the heart</ref>
*The existence of a reflux situation.{{sfn|Labropoulos|Tiongson|Pryor|Tassiopoulos|2003|}}{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|p=25}}<ref group="nb">Reflux means the presence of a bi-directional flow. An isolated retrograde flow is not a reflux, but it only becomes a reflux in presence of a previously anterograde flow</ref>

Where venous thrombosis is suspected, this examination gives the diagnosis and evaluates the extension and the degree of severity.{{sfn|WHO|1998|p=26}}{{sfn|Dauzat|1991|pp=386–437}}

There are no contraindications for this examination.

== Mechanism ==
{{main|Medical ultrasonography}}
[[File:Efetuando um exame ecodoppler.jpg|thumb|270px|left|Performing venous ultrasonography]]
Ultrasonography is based on the knowledge that [[sound]] can pass through human body tissues and can reflect itself on the tissue interfaces<ref group="nb">Interface is the plane between two tissues with a different density, for instance skin-fat-aponevrosis-muscle</ref> in the same way that light can reflect back on itself, from a mirror. Tissue in the body will offer varying degrees of resistance, known as [[acoustic impedance]], to the path of the ultrasound beam. So that, any tissue will still reflect the ultrasound beam to some degree. When there is a high impedance difference between two tissues, the interface between them will strongly reflect the sound. When the ultrasound beam meets air, or solid tissue such as bone, their  impedance difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures. The examiner will see just a shadow, instead the image, he or she might have expected. Air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used. The gel prevents air bubbles from forming between the transducer, or probe, and the patient's skin and so helps the conduction of the sound waves from the transducer into the body. The watery medium also helps to conduct the sound waves. Liquids, including blood have a low impedance, which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible. One of the important exceptions is that when the blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen, and this is termed "spontaneous contrast".{{sfn|Goldman|2003}}{{sfn|Dauzat|1991|pp=3-7}}

The probe is an [[ultrasonic sensor]] also called a transceiver, but more generally known as a transducer, which functions to send and receive acoustic energy. The emission is generated on piezoelectric crystals by the [[piezoelectric effect]]. The reflected ultrasound is received by the probe, transformed into an electric impulse as voltage and sent to the engine for [[signal processing]] and conversion to an image on the screen. The depth reached by the ultrasound beam is dependent on the frequency of the probe used. The higher the frequency the lesser the depth reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhprofessional.com/downloads/products/0071604898/carmody_ch04.pdf|title=Probe Selection, Machine Controls, and Equipment|author=Markowitz, J.}}</ref>

== Preparation ==
No preparation is normally necessary for this examination, but if a complementary study of abdominal veins is also required, the patient will be asked to fast for 12 hours beforehand. The [[sensitivity and specificity]] measurements are around 90%.{{sfn|Belem|Nogueira|Schettino|Barros|2004|}}

== Procedure ==
Where either [[venous thrombosis|superficial]] or [[deep vein thrombosis|deep]] thrombosis is suspected, this examination can be performed with the patient lying down. For an evaluation of varicose veins, the patient will need to be in an upright position to enable a proper study of blood flow direction{{sfn|Franceschi|1988|p=86}}

=== Deep vein thrombosis ===
{{main|Deep vein thrombosis}}
[[File:Great saphenous vein thrombosis 05091312008.jpg|thumb|Probe parallel to the vein great axis to show the "thrombus head" free in the GSV]]
Unlike the arterial ultrasound study, the venous ultrasonography is carried out with the probe in a [[transversal (geometry)|transversal]] position, ([[perpendicular]] to the vein great axis).{{sfn|Coleridge-Smith|Labropoulos|Partsch|Myers|2006|}} Vessels will appear on the screen as round, and black inside. All collateral veins are better detected this way, including perforator veins, but of most importance is the detection of venous thrombosis. The most reliable sign of thrombosis (even when a good image and color is present) is the absence of compressibility.<ref group="nb">A vein cannot be compressed when the blood is in a solid state, as with a [[thrombus]], in the same way that a rubber pipe cannot be compressed if the water inside is frozen</ref>{{sfn|Raghavendra|1986|pp.=89-95}} However, if the probe is [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the vein axis, when the examiner compresses it, the probe can slide to the right or to the left giving a [[false negative]] for [[thrombosis]] as the thrombus will not then be evident. Nevertheless when the examiner needs to show the head thrombus in a printout he will present the probe parallel to the vein great axis.{{sfn|Coleridge-Smith|Labropoulos|Partsch|Myers|2006|}}

The inability to compress the vein is one of the more reliable indications of venous thrombosis, since a very recently formed thrombus being not very solid, will have a low echogenicity, and will be seen as a black area in the gray-scale image and will be hardly visible. When the examiner uses color, the imaging is not much improved.{{sfn|Dauzat|1991|p=422}} The fact that the examiner doesn't see a thrombus doesn't mean that it doesn't exist and a vein [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] with echoes doesn't mean that a thrombus does exist. The location of the thrombus and its detail will  inform of the seriousness of the condition. In a [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT), or in a superficial thrombosis where the thrombus is floating, especially if it is located near to the saphenofemoral junction will indicate an emergency situation since their will be a high risk of a pulmonary embolism occurring. {{sfn|WHO|1998|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Elias|Mallard|Elias|Alquier|2011|}}

There is a simplified technique called "compression ultrasonography" which can be used for quick [[deep vein thrombosis]] diagnosis, limited though to the [[common femoral vein]] and the [[popliteal vein]]. It is invaluable in an emergency situation and is performed just by vein compression using transducer pressure.<ref name="JAMA">{{cite journal|first=Cogo, A.|last=Hirsh J.|title=Distribution of Thrombosis in Patients With Symptomatic Deep Vein Thrombosis Implications for simplifying the diagnosis Process with compression ultrasound|journal=JAMA|issue=24|volume=153|month=12|year=1993|accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref>

Compression ultrasonography has both high [[sensitivity and specificity]] for detecting proximal deep vein thrombosis only in symptomatic patients. Results are not reliable when the patient is symptomless and must be checked, for example in high risk postoperative patients mainly after orthopedic surgery where there is already lower limb pain and edema secondary to surgery, thrombi are mostly localized in the calf veins and frequently are not completely occlusive.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521401811289|title=Deep venous thrombosis in postoperative vascular surgical patients: A frequent finding without prophylaxis|first=Hollyoak, M.|last=Weir, P.|journal=JVS|year=2001|month=10|volume=34|issue=4|pages=656-660|doi=10.1067/mva.2001.116803}}</ref><ref name=medscape>{{cite journal|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410882_2|title= The Diagnostic Approach to Deep Venous Thrombosis: Diagnostic Tests for Deep Vein Thrombosis|journal= Semin Respir Crit Care Med. |year=2000|volume=21|issue=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first= Jongbloets, L.M.M.|last=Lensing, A.W.A.|title=Limitations of compression ultrasound for the detection of symptomless postoperative deep vein thrombosis|journal=The Lancet|volume=343|issue=8906|year=1994|month=may|pages=1142-1144|accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref>

=== Venous insufficiency ===
The emphasis of an investigation for haemodynamic changes in patients with chronic venous disease is quite different from an examination for suspected deep vein thrombosis. The request for this investigation should be made by a physician who has undertaken clinical examination to provide valid reasons for investigation, a guidance as to what to look for and, if the patient's physician is a surgeon, how he pretends to treat his patient: an investigation performed to treat the patient by a stripping or laser therapy is very different from the examination performed to execute a CHIVA <ref group="nb">CHIVA means "'''V'''enous '''I'''nsufficiency '''C'''onservative, '''H'''emodynamic and  '''A'''mbulatory treatment" the order of words coming from French because is a procedure invented by the French researcher Claude Franceschi</ref> procedure for example.

Unlike the arterial ultrasound study when the examiner studies the venous insufficiency, the vein wall has not a relevant meaning but all the interest will be focused over the blood flow direction. How veins drain is the end point of this examination. On this way, venous ultrasonography became an hemodynamic examination and is reserved to examiners who have done hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep knowledge about this subject.{{sfn|Cina|Pedicelli|Di Stasi|Porcelli|2005}}

Once more, unlike the arterial ultrasound examination, blood velocity in veins has no diagnosis meaning. Veins are a draining system similar to a low pressure [[Pipe flow|hydraulic system]], with a [[laminar flow]] and a low velocity. This low velocity is responsible for the fact we can only detect it spontaneously with the doppler effect on the proximal and larger veins (femoral and iliac veins), where the flow is modulated by the respiratory rhythm or continuous in cases where there is a high flow. The thinner veins don't have a spontaneously flow. However, in some circumstances the blood flow is so slow that we can see some echogenic material moving within the vein.<ref group="nb">Echogenic is the tissue which reflects the ultrasound beam and can be visualized on the screen</ref> Is the so-called "spontaneous contrast". This image can be mistaken for a thrombus but the vein is easily compressed opposed to the thrombus non compressibility.{{sfn|Franceschi|1988|pages=84–5}}
[[File:Desenhando a Cartografia.jpg|thumb|left|performing a vein mapping]]

To evidence the blood flow velocity the examiner has at his disposal some maneuvers which accelerate flow and detect valvular function:

Manual squeezing/releasing - the examiner compress the vein below the probe pushing blood in an anterograde direction. When he releases and if valves are insufficient it will appear a retrograde flow (reflux) superior to 0.5 sec.{{sfn|Labropoulos|Tiongson|Pryor|Tassiopoulos|2003|}}

[[Valsalva maneuver]] - when the patient performs this maneuver, he augments intra-abdominal venous pressure. If the great saphenous valve at sapheno-femoral junction is insufficient, a reflux will appear. 

Paraná maneuver,<ref group="nb">Paraná maneuver has been described for the first time by Claude Franceschi at the Chiva congress 1998 at Paraná Town, Argentina</ref> which uses a proprioceptive reflex to test venous muscle pump induced flow. A slight push to the waist, triggers a muscle contraction at leg level (to maintain posture). This maneuver is very useful to study deep veins flow and to detect valvular insufficiency, mainly at popliteal level and when there are painful or very edematous legs. {{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|p=93}}

Toe flexion, active foot dorsi-flexion, hyper-extension of tip toes, can also be very useful to detect perforator vein insufficiency. These maneuvers unleashes a muscle contraction and compress deep veins. If a perforator valve is insuficicnet the examiner will register a reflux flow from the deep to the superficial through the perforator vein.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|pages=92–4}}

All these maneuvers need a more or less long training to be executed properly.

Normal blood flow is  anterograde (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However there is two exceptions: at the [[great saphenous vein|sapheno-femoral junction]], the GSV collaterals which drain the abdominal wall have a flow from top to bottom and can be responsible for false positive diagnosis when the examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction.  The second exception is the flow from the venous foot sole network which (around 10%) drains to the [[dorsal venous arch of the foot]], going therefore from deep to superficial veins.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|p=19}}

Attention will be focused on blood flow direction in deep veins, superficial main veins [[Great saphenous vein]], [[small saphenous vein]], their collaterals, mainly the [[anterior accessory saphenous vein]], [[Giacomini vein]], [[perforator vein]]s as well as the shunt detection<ref group="nb">In venous circulation, shunt is the situation where blood circulates from one vein (leak point) to another and from this one to the former (re-entry point) creating a pathway in a vicious circle between two veins one with a physiologic flow and the other with a retrograde flow</ref>{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|p=37}}

To further complicate the examination execution, in a patient with venous insufficiency, a mapping will be done, showing veins in its longitudinal aspect while the examination has been done with the probe in transversal position. This forces the physician to extrapolated quickly all images he saw in transversal to the draw he must do in longitudinal.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|p=81}}{{sfn|Galeandro|Quistelli|Scicchitano|Gesualdo|2012|}}

=== Technical pitfalls ===
The lower limbs venous ultrasonography is one of all medical complementary examinations where the examiner knowledge and training decide the results quality.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|pages=9–17}}{{sfn|Saliba|Giannini|Rollo|2007|}} Not only the execution is not easy but results interpretation is subjective and proportional to the examiner knowledge in venous hemodynamics. A mapping helps the reproducibility and the inter-observer agreement of this examination.{{sfn|Galeandro|Quistelli|Scicchitano|Gesualdo|2012|}}}{{sfn|Wong|Duncan|Nichols|2003|}} This situation is yet more tricky because there are dilated veins without insufficiency by hyper-debit, non dilated veins but insufficient, veins can have a discrete insufficiency in summer but they can be normal in winter and by definition, between two valves blood flows freely in both directions, anterograde and retrograde.{{sfn|Zamboni|2009|p=26}} Another problem, talking about the superficial venous system, is the fact that venous anatomy is not constant, there are plenty variations (veins are where we found them, not where we look for) and in the same patient the right lower limb is not identical to the left one. The execution protocol is completely different from the artery examination and all the dynamic maneuvers need to be very well executed and are a problem for less experimented examiners. The need of a specialized training is mandatory and there is yet many countries where this presents a big problem nowadays.{{sfn|WHO|1998|p=14}}

== Particular details ==

=== Great saphenous vein ===
[[File:The eye view.jpg|thumb|The "Eye" image]]
The [[great saphenous vein]], has its origin at the [[dorsal venous arch of the foot]], runs up the leg and thigh medial side to reach the groin where it drains on the common femoral vein. All the way, it is located between the superficial and the deep [[fascia]], called the [[great saphenous vein|saphenous compartment]],{{sfn|Caggiati|Ricci|1997|}} receives a numberless of collaterals and drains into the deep veins by [[perforator vein]]s. When visualized in ultrasonography examination, this compartment with the saphenous vein looks like an eye: is the so-called "eye image".{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|p=14}} This image is not exclusive to GSV. Both the [[Giacomini vein]] and the [[anterior accessory saphenous vein]] (AASV) present this "eye image", the AASV only at its proximal 1/3. All veins which are between the skin and the superficial fascia are tributaries and all veins which cross the deep fascia and join the deep venous system (SVP) are perforator veins.{{sfn|Cavezzi|Labropoulos|Partsch|Ricci|2006|}}

Three anatomic compartments can be described:
*The deep compartment or N1 (N=Network), containing the deep veins
*Saphenous compartment or N2, between the two fascia, containing saphenous veins, AASV and Giacomini
*Superficial or N3, containing a numberless tributary veins, between them one is usually seen at the medial leg, the Leonardo's vein or posterior arch vein and very often is the cause of varicose problems.

Some authors describe one more compartment N4, containing collaterals which do a bypass between two distinct points of the same vein.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|pages=11–3}}
[[File:Paraná maneuver2.jpg|thumb|left|Paraná maneuver: checking perforators]]
The compartment differentiation is very useful in ultrasonographic examination because it enables an easier systematization, the mapping execution and, if appropriate, the surgery strategic.

Being protected between two fascias, veins belonging to compartment N2 very rarely become sinuous. So, when doing the patient physical examination the clinician who detects a sinuous vein knows immediately (with a very low possibility of error) that it's not the saphenous vein but a tributary.

The sapheno-femoral junction will be tested by Valsalva maneuver and the use of color and doppler is very useful at this level.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|pages=11–3}}

=== Anterior acessory saphenous vein ===
[[File:Mickey mouse sign1.svg|thumb|200px|AASV at sapheno-femoral junction the "Mickey mouse sign"]]
The [[anterior accessory saphenous vein]] is an important GSV collateral frequently responsible for varicose veins located on the anterior and lateral aspect of the thigh.
It has a more anterior position compared with saphenous vein and is outside the femoral vessels plan. It is the "alignment sign".{{sfn|Cavezzi|Labropoulos|Partsch|Ricci|2006|}} At the groin it can be seen at the outside of great saphenous vein creating, together with the GSV and the femoral vein, an image, the so-called "Mickey mouse sign". Some authors, inspired on this sign (presented for the first time at CHIVA's meeting 2002 at Berlin), describe a "Mickey mouse view" at the groin, image formed by the common femoral vein, GSV and superficial femoral artery. When insufficient, its flow becomes retrograde and tries to drain in the superior fibular perforator, at the lateral aspect of the knee or sometimes it runs down until the ankle trying to drain in the inferior fibular perforator.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|pages=11–3}}

=== Small saphenous vein ===
The [[Small saphenous vein]], runs along the posterior aspect of the leg until the popliteal region where usually it drains in the [[popliteal vein]]. Ultrasonography has permitted to show a great number of variations at this level. Is not rare to see it joining the [[gastrocnemius vein]] before draining in the popliteal vein. Sometimes it doesn't contact with the popliteal vein but go up to drain in the great saphenous vein at a variable level, or, instead draining in the popliteal vein it can merge with Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. Usually it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3.{{sfn|Coleridge-Smith|Labropoulos|Partsch|Myers|2006|}} Rarely it can drain in a thigh muscle vein ([[semimembranosus]] in the images below). To check its insufficiency, Paraná maneuver is very useful.{{sfn|Franceschi|Zamboni|2009|p=93}}

</center>

=== Giacomini vein ===

Giacomini vein acts most of the time as a  bypass between GSV and SSV territories. Usually its flow is in anterograde direction, from bottom to top. However it can be retrograde without pathology. After a GSV stripping, laser ablation or after its ligation at the sapheno-femoral junction, Giacomini vein will drain into the SSV, with a retrograde flow. When there is GSV thrombosis or insufficiency, Giacomini can deviate blood flow to SSV and from this one to the popliteal vein. Each time the examiner must refer what is the flow direction in this vein, as it has important implications to decide how to treat the patient if  the surgeon pretend to do a treatment other than a stripping or laser ablation.{{sfn|Escribano|Juan|Bofill|Rodríguez-Mori|2005}}

=== Perforator veins ===

[[File:Perfurante insuficiente.jpg|thumb|Insufficient perforator]]

[[Perforator vein]]s are a very special part of venous system, carrying blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular [[systole (medicine)|systole]] their valves close and don't permit the blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient they are responsible for the fast worsening of a previous varicose disease and the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is also very important because they are used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery. When the venous ultrasonography is made, insufficient and continent perforators must be present on venous mapping.{{sfn|Pierik|Toonder|van Urk|Wittens|1997}} To test properly these veins the examiner needs to use some maneuvers like the Paraná maneuver, toe flexion, active foot dorsi-flexion and hyper-extension of tip toes.

== Examination report==
[[File:Normal mapping.svg|thumb|left|SVS normal mapping]]
After performing this examination, the physician needs to write a report in which some points are crucial:

How is the DVS, its permeability, compressibility, continent or insufficient;

Permeability, compressibility of the SVS, presence or absence  superficial insufficiency, in which veins or vein segments ;

Which perforator veins are continent or insufficient;

Presence or absence of shunts;

Mapping the insufficient veins, flux direction, shunts, perforators.{{sfn|Galeandro|Quistelli|Scicchitano|Gesualdo|2012|}}

== History ==

After the introduction of ultrasound in 1956, it was very quickly adopted for use in medicine due to its rapid, accurate diagnostic capabilities which offered the possibility of prompt treatment. A few years later, [[acoustic Doppler velocimetry]] and the [[medical ultrasonography|color doppler]] were devised, which have had a significant impact on many specialties, including [[radiology]], [[obstetrics]], [[gynecology]], [[angiology]] and [[cardiology]]. Their use requires appropriate training in order to prevent [[false positive]] or [[false negative]] diagnoses. {{sfn|Cobbold|2003|pp=608-609}}{{sfn|WHO|1998|pp=1–2}}

Doppler effect has been described for the first time by Christian Doppler in 1843. Around forty years after the piezoelectric effect was discovered and confirmed in 1880 by Pierre & Jacques Curie, but only in the late 1940s it has been applied to the human body for medical purposes by Dr.&nbsp;[[George Ludwig]], University of Pennsylvania.<ref name="AIUM">{{cite web | title=History of the AIUM | url=http://www.aium.org/aboutAIUM/timeline/1950.asp |accessdate=2013-02-24|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20051103064941/http://www.aium.org/aboutAIUM/timeline/1950.asp  |accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref><ref name="ObGyn-Ultrasound">{{cite web | title=The History of Ultrasound: A collection of recollections, articles, interviews and images | publisher=www.obgyn.net | url=http://www.obgyn.net/us/us.asp?page=/us/news_articles/ultrasound_history/asp-history-toc | accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref>

Since 1970, real-time scanners and pulsed doppler, have permitted its use to study the venous system function. The first demonstration of color Doppler was achieved by Geoff Stevenson.<ref name="Baker">{{cite journal|last=Baker, D.W.|first=Eyer, M.K.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301562981900193|title=Color digital echo-doppler image presentation.|journal=Ulrasound in Med. & Bio.|volume=7|issue=1|pages=21-31|accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref><ref name="Persson">{{cite journal|first=Persson A.V.|last=Jewell R.|title=Use of triplex scanner in diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis|journal=Arch.

Rapid technical advancements in echotomography and the possibility to see properly the superficial tissues made possible the very good specificity and sensitivity of this technique.<ref name="Laroche">{{cite journal|first=Laroche J.

Great attention to hemodynamic study begins mainly with Franceschi, C., in France, when he described for the first time the conservative treatment for venous insufficiency in 1985.{{sfn|Franceschi}}
