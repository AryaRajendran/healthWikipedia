'''Amyloid beta''' (Aβ or Abeta) is a [[peptide]] of 36–43 [[amino acid]]s that is processed from the [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP). While best known as a component of [[amyloid plaque]]s in association with [[Alzheimer's disease]], as Aβ is the main component of  certain deposits found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, evidence has been found that Aβ is a highly multifunctional peptide with significant non-pathological activity.<ref name="pmid20451519">{{cite journal | author = Lahiri DK, Maloney B | title = Beyond the signaling effect role of amyloid–β42 on the processing of AβPP, and its clinical implications | journal = Exp.

== Disease associations ==

Aβ is the main component of [[amyloid]] plaques (deposits found in the [[brain]]s of patients with Alzheimer's disease). Similar plaques appear in some variants of [[Lewy body dementia]] and in [[inclusion body myositis]] (a muscle disease), while Aβ can also form the aggregates that coat cerebral blood vessels in [[cerebral amyloid angiopathy]].

== Formation ==

Aβ is  formed after sequential [[peptidase|cleavage]] of the [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP), a [[transmembrane protein|transmembrane]] [[glycoprotein]] of undetermined function. APP can be processed by [[alpha secretase|α-]], [[BACE|β-]] and [[gamma secretase|γ-secretase]]s; Aβ protein is generated by successive action of the β and γ secretases. The γ secretase, which produces the [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] end of the Aβ peptide, cleaves within the transmembrane region of APP and can generate a number of isoforms of 36-43 [[amino acid]] residues in length. The most common isoforms are Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub>; the longer form is typically produced by cleavage that occurs in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], while the shorter form is produced by cleavage in the trans-[[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] network.<ref name="pmid9288729">{{cite journal | author = Hartmann T, Bieger SC, Brühl B, Tienari PJ, Ida N, Allsop D, Roberts GW, Masters CL, Dotti CG, Unsicker K, Beyreuther K | title = Distinct sites of intracellular production for Alzheimer's disease A beta40/42 amyloid peptides | journal = Nat.

Autosomal-dominant mutations in APP cause [[hereditary]] [[familial Alzheimer disease|early-onset Alzheimer's disease]] (familial AD).

The "amyloid hypothesis", that the plaques are responsible for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, is accepted by the majority of researchers but is by no means conclusively established.

== Intervention strategies ==

Researchers in Alzheimer's disease have identified five strategies as possible interventions against amyloid:<ref name="pmid15322526">{{cite journal | author = Citron M | title = Strategies for disease modification in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Nat. Rev. Neurosci. | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 677–85 | year = 2004 | month = September | pmid = 15322526 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1495 }}</ref>

* [[BACE|β-Secretase]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s.  These work to block the first cleavage of APP outside of the cell.
* [[gamma-Secretase|γ-Secretase]] inhibitors (e. g. [[semagacestat]]).  These work to block the second cleavage of APP in the cell membrane and would then stop the subsequent formation of Aβ and its toxic fragments.
* Selective Aβ<sub>42</sub> lowering agents (e. g. [[tarenflurbil]]).  These modulate γ-secretase to reduce Aβ<sub>42</sub> production in favor of other (shorter) Aβ versions.

β- and y-secretase are responsible for the generation of Aβ from the release of the intracellular domain of APP, meaning that compounds that can partially inhibit the activity of either β- and y-secretase are highly sought after. In order to initiate partial inhibition of β- and y-secretase, a compound is needed that can block the large active site of aspartyl proteases while still being capable of bypassing the blood-brain barrier. To date, human testing has been avoided due to concern that it might interfere with signaling via Notch proteins and other cell surface receptors.

* [[Immunotherapy]].  This stimulates the host immune system to recognize and attack Aβ, or provide antibodies that either prevent plaque deposition or enhance clearance of plaques or Aβ oligomers. Oligomerization is a chemical process that converts individual molecules into a chain consisting of a finite number of molecules. Prevention of oligomerization of Aβ has been exemplified by active or passive Aβ immunization. In this process antibodies to Aβ are used to decrease cerebral plaque levels. This is accomplished by promoting microglial clearance and/or redistributing the peptide from the brain to systemic circulation. One such beta-amyloid  vaccine that is currently in clinical trials is CAD106.<ref name="pmid22677258">{{cite journal | author = Winblad B, Andreasen N, Minthon L, Floesser A, Imbert G, Dumortier T, Maguire RP, Blennow K, Lundmark J, Staufenbiel M, Orgogozo JM, Graf A | title = Safety, tolerability, and antibody response of active Aβ immunotherapy with CAD106 in patients with Alzheimer's disease: randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human study | journal = Lancet Neurol | volume = 11| issue = 7| pages = 597–604| year = 2012 | month = June | pmid = 22677258 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70140-0 | laysummary = http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?l=en&d=130&a=145109&newsdep=130 | laysource = Karolinska Institutet }}</ref> Immunization with synthetic Aβ1-42 has been shown to be beneficial in mice and displays low toxicity; however human trials have shown no significant differences. Thus, it is not yet effective in humans and requires further research. Specific findings show that the 20 amino acid SDPM1 protein binds tetramer forms of Aβ(1-40)- and Aβ(1-42)-amyloids and blocks subsequent Aβ amyloid aggregation. It is important to note that this study was done in mice and that while it prevents further development of neuropathology it did not result in an improvement in cognitive performance. Lastly, Aβ42 immunization resulted in the clearance of amyloid plaques in patients with Alzheimer's disease but did not prevent progressive neurodegeneration.<ref name="pmid20493257">{{cite journal | author = Wang CM, Devries S, Camboni M, Glass M, Martin PT | title = Immunization with the SDPM1 peptide lowers amyloid plaque burden and improves cognitive function in the APPswePSEN1(A246E) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease | journal = Neurobiol.

Melatonin does not reverse fibril formation or oligomers of amyloid beta once they are formed. This is supported by experiments in transgenic mice which suggest that melatonin has the potential to prevent amyloid deposition if administered early in life, but it may not be efficacious to revert amyloid deposition or treat Alzheimer's disease. 

This connection with melatonin, which regulates sleep, is strengthened by the recent research showing that the wakefulness inducing hormone [[orexin]] influences amyloid beta (see below).<ref name="Kang">{{cite journal | author = Kang JE, Lim MM, Bateman RJ, Lee JJ, Smyth LP, Cirrito JR, Fujiki N, Nishino S, Holtzman DM | title = Amyloid-β Dynamics are Regulated by Orexin and the Sleep-Wake Cycle | journal = Science | volume = 326 | issue = 5955 | pages = 1005–7 | year = 2009 | month = November | pmid = 19779148 | doi = 10.1126/science.1180962 | pmc = 2789838 |bibcode = 2009Sci...326.1005K | laysummary = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20090925/Chronic-sleep-deprivation-linked-to-early-incidence-of-Alzheimers-brain-plaques.aspx | laysource = News-Medical.Net  }}</ref> Interestingly, animal experiments show that melatonin may also correct mild elevations of cholesterol which is also an early risk factor for amyloid formation.

It has been shown that high-cholesterol diets tend to increase Aβ pathology in animals. Modulating cholesterol homeostasis has yielded results that show that chronic use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as the statins, is associated with a lower incidence of AD. In APP genetically modified mice, cholesterol-lowering drugs have been shown to reduce overall pathology. While the mechanism is poorly understood it appears that cholesterol-lowering drugs have a direct effect on APP processing.<ref name="Lee_2002">{{cite journal | author = Lee JY, Cole TB, Palmiter RD, Suh SW, Koh JY | title = Contribution by synaptic zinc to the gender-disparate plaque formation in human Swedish mutant APP transgenic mice | journal = Proc.

[[Chelation therapy]], which involves the removal of heavy metals from the body, has also been shown to be beneficial in lowering amyloid plaque levels. This is because Aβ aggregation is somewhat dependent on the metal ions copper and zinc. Zinc in synaptic vesicles, which is under the control of the zinc transporter ZnT3, plays a major role in Aβ formation. The expression of the ZnT3 is significantly lower in Alzheimer’s patients compared to healthy patients. Mice without ZnT3 were found to have much lower plaque formation. Further promoting this concept, Aβ deposition was impeded in APP transgenic mice treated with the antibiotic [[clioquinol]], a known copper/zinc chelator.<ref name="Lee_2002"/>

Drug therapy has been another approach to treatment. [[Memantine]] is an Alzheimer’s drug which has received widespread approval. It is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate ([[NMDA]]) channel blocker. By binding to the NMDA receptor with a higher affinity than Mg2+ ions, memantine is able to inhibit the prolonged influx of Ca2+ ions, particularly from extrasynaptic receptors, which forms the basis of neuronal excitotoxicity. It is an option for the management of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease (modest effect). The study showed that 20&nbsp;mg/day improved cognition, functional ability and behavioural symptoms in patient population.<ref name="pmid23158762">{{cite journal | author = Schneider JS, Pioli EY, Jianzhong Y, Li Q, Bezard E | title = Effects of memantine and galantamine on cognitive performance in aged rhesus macaques | journal = Neurobiol.

Treatment with victoza yielded cognitive benefits that included improved object and spatial recognition. Additionally victoza enhances induction and maintenance of long term potentiation (LTP) and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) in both APP/PS1 and non-genetically altered mice. Other histological benefits include a reduced inflammatory response and an increase in the number of young neurons in the dentate gyrus. The β-amyloid level was also found to be significantly reduced.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McClean, P., Parthsarathy, V., Faivre, E., and Hölscher, C | title = The Diabetes Drug Liraglutide Prevents Degenerative Processes in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = 17 | pages = 6587–6594 | year = 2011 | month = November | pmid = 12213471 | doi = 10.1016/S0968-0896(02)00251-1 }}</ref>

== Circadian rhythm of amyloid beta ==

A 2009 report demonstrated that amyloid beta production follows a [[circadian rhythm]], rising when an animal (mouse) or person is awake and falling during sleep.<ref name="Kang"/> The wakefulness-promoting neuroprotein [[orexin]] was shown to be necessary for the circadian rhythm of amyloid beta production.<ref name="Kang"/> The report suggested that excessive periods of wakefulness (i.e. due to [[sleep debt]]) could cause chronic build-up of amyloid beta, which could hypothetically lead to [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="Kang"/>  This is consistent with recent findings that chronic sleep deprivation is associated with early onset Alzheimer's disease.<ref name="Kang"/>

[[Melatonin]] is also involved in circadian rhythm maintenance. Notably, [[melatonin]] has been connected with the "sundowning" phenomenon, in which Alzheimer's disease patients that have amyloid plaques in the hypothalamus exhibit exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease symptoms late in the day.<ref name="Volicer2001">{{cite journal | author = Volicer L, Harper D, Manning B, Goldstein R, Satlin A | title = Sundowning and circadian rhythms in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 158 | issue = 5 | pages = 704–11 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11329390 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.704 }}</ref> This "sundowning" phenomenon could be directly or indirectly related to the recently discovered continuous increase in amyloid beta throughout the day.

== Measuring amyloid beta ==
[[Image:Cerebral amyloid angiopathy -2b- amyloid beta - intermed mag - cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing amyloid beta (brown) in [[senile plaques]] of the [[cerebral cortex]] (upper left of image) and cerebral [[blood vessel]]s (right of image) with [[immunostain]]ing.]]
There are many different ways to measure Amyloid beta.  It can be measured semi-quantitatively with [[immunostain]]ing, which also allows one to determine location.  Amyloid beta may be primarily vascular, as in [[cerebral amyloid angiopathy]], ''or'' in [[senile plaques]] and vascular.

One highly sensitive method is [[ELISA]] which is an immunosorbent assay which utilizes a pair of [[antibodies]] that recognize Amyloid beta.<ref name="pmid22528111">{{cite journal | author = Schmidt SD, Nixon RA, Mathews PM | title = Tissue processing prior to analysis of Alzheimer's disease associated proteins and metabolites, including Aβ | journal = Methods Mol.

Imaging compounds, notably [[Pittsburgh compound B]], (6-OH-BTA-1, a [[thioflavin]]), can selectively bind to amyloid beta in vitro and in vivo. This technique, combined with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] imaging, has been used to image areas of plaque deposits in Alzheimer's patients.
