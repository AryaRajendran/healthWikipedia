In the fields of [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], '''c-Fos''' is a proto-oncogene that is the human homolog of the retroviral [[oncogene]] v-fos. It was first discovered in rat [[fibroblasts]] as the transforming gene of the FBJ MSV (Finkel–Biskis–Jinkins murine osteogenic sarcoma virus) and fos is named for feline osteosarcoma virus. It is a part of a bigger Fos family of [[transcription factors]] which includes c-Fos, [[FosB]], Fra-1 and Fra-2 as well as smaller FosB splice variants, FosB2 and deltaFosB2.<ref name="pmid16199154">{{cite journal | author = Milde-Langosch K | title = The Fos family of transcription factors and their role in tumourigenesis | journal = Eur.

== Structure and function ==

c-fos is 380 amino acid protein with a basic [[leucine zipper]] region for dimerisation and DNA-binding and a transactivation domain at C-terminus. Unlike Jun proteins, it cannot form homodimers, only heterodimers with c-jun.  ''In vitro'' studies have shown that Jun–Fos heterodimers are more stable and have stronger DNA-binding activity than Jun–Jun homodimers.<ref name="pmid3142692">{{cite journal | author = Halazonetis TD, Georgopoulos K, Greenberg ME, Leder P | title = c-Jun dimerizes with itself and with c-Fos, forming complexes of different DNA binding affinities | journal = Cell | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | pages = 917–24 | year = 1988 | month = December | pmid = 3142692 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(88)90147-X }}</ref>

The importance of c-fos in biological context has been determined by eliminating endogenous function by using anti-sense mRNA, anti-c-fos antibodies, a [[ribozyme]] that cleaves c-fos mRNA or a dominant negative mutant of c-fos. The transgenic mice thus generated are viable, demonstrating that there are c-fos dependent and independent pathways of cell proliferation,  but display a range of tissue-specific developmental defects, including [[osteoporosis]], delayed [[gametogenesis]], lymphopenia and behavioral abnormalities.

== Clinical significance ==

The AP-1 complex has been implicated in [[transformation (cell division)|transformation]] and progression of [[cancer]]. In [[osteosarcoma]] and endometrial carcinoma, c-Fos overexpression was associated with high-grade lesions and poor prognosis. Also, in a comparison between precancerous lesion of the cervix uteri and invasive cervical cancer, c-Fos expression was significantly lower in precancerous lesions. C-Fos has also been identified as independent predictor of decreased survival in [[breast cancer]].<ref name="pmid18854825">{{cite journal | author = Mahner S, Baasch C, Schwarz J, Hein S, Wölber L, Jänicke F, Milde-Langosch K | title = C-Fos expression is a molecular predictor of progression and survival in epithelial ovarian carcinoma | journal = Br. J. Cancer | volume = 99 | issue = 8 | pages = 1269–75 | year = 2008 | month = October | pmid = 18854825 | pmc = 2570515 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604650 }}</ref>

It was found that overexpression of c-fos from class I MHC promoter in transgenic mice leads to the formation of osteosarcomas due to increased proliferation of osteoblasts whereas ectopic expression of the other Jun and Fos proteins does not induce any malignant tumors.  Activation of the c-Fos  transgene in mice results in overexpression of cyclin D1, A and E in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'', which might contribute to the uncontrolled growth leading to tumor. Human osteosarcomas analyzed for c-fos expression have given positive results in more than half the cases and c-fos expression has been associated with higher frequency of relapse and poor response to chemotherapy.

Several studies have raised the idea that c-Fos may also have tumor-suppressor activity, that it might be able to promote as well as suppress tumorigenesis.  Supporting this is the observation that in ovarian carcinomas, loss of c-Fos expression correlates with disease progression. This double action could be enabled by differential protein composition of tumour cells and their environment, for example, dimerisation partners, co-activators and promoter architecture.  It is possible that the tumor suppressing activity is due to a proapoptotic function. The exact mechanism by which c-Fos contributes to [[apoptosis]] is not clearly understood, but observations in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells indicate that c-Fos is a mediator of c-myc-induced cell death and might induce apoptosis through the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Fas ligand (FASLG or FasL) and the tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNFSF10 or TRAIL) might reflect an additional apoptotic mechanism induced by c-Fos, as observed in a human T-cell leukaemia cell line. Another possible mechanism of c-Fos involvement in tumour suppression could be the direct regulation of BRCA1, a well established factor in familial breast and ovarian cancer.

In addition, role of c-fos and other Fos family proteins has also been studied in endometrial carcinoma, cervical cancer, mesotheliomas, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, melanomas, thyroid carcinomas, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, etc.

As such, the c-Fos promoter finds utilization in drug abuse research in general, as well as with context-induced relapse to drug-seeking and other behavioral changes associated with chronic drug taking.

An increase in c-Fos production in androgen receptor-containing neurons has been observed in rats after mating.

== Applications ==

Expression of c-fos is an indirect marker of neuronal activity because c-fos is often expressed when neurons fire action potentials.<ref name="pmid19050162">{{cite journal | author = VanElzakker M, Fevurly RD, Breindel T, Spencer RL | title = Environmental novelty is associated with a selective increase in Fos expression in the output elements of the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal cortex | journal = Learn.
