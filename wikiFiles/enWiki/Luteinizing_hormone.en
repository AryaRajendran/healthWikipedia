==Structure==
LH  is a hetero[[protein dimer|dimer]]ic [[glycoprotein]]. Each [[monomer]]ic unit is a  [[glycoprotein]] molecule; one alpha and one beta subunit make the full, functional protein. 

Its structure is similar to that of the other glycoprotein hormones, [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), and [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG). The protein dimer contains 2 glycopeptidic subunits, labeled alpha and beta subunits, that are non-covalently associated (i.e., without any disulfide bridge linking them):

* The ''[[Alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones|alpha subunits]]'' of LH, FSH, TSH, and hCG are identical, and contain 92 [[amino acids]] in human but 96 [[amino acids]] in almost all other vertebrate species (glycoprotein hormones do not exist in invertebrates).

* The ''beta subunits'' vary. LH has a beta subunit of  120 amino acids (LHB) that confers its specific biologic action and is responsible for the specificity of the interaction with the [[LH receptor]]. This beta subunit contains an amino acid sequence that exhibits large homologies with that of the beta subunit of [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] and both stimulate the same receptor.  However, the hCG beta subunit contains an additional 24 amino acids, and the two hormones differ in the composition of their sugar moieties.

The different composition of these [[oligosaccharide]]s affects bioactivity and speed of degradation. The biologic [[half-life]] of LH is 20 minutes, shorter than that of  FSH (3–4 hours) and hCG (24 hours).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

<br>- The ranges denoted '''Inter-woman variability''' are more appropriate to use when the average cycle lengths and time of ovulation are unknown, but only the beginning of menstruation is given.]]

==Genes==
The [[gene]] for the ''alpha subunit'' is located on [[chromosome 6]]q12.21.

The luteinizing hormone ''beta subunit'' gene is localized in the LHB/CGB gene cluster on [[chromosome 19]]q13.32. In contrast to the alpha gene activity, beta LH subunit gene activity is restricted to the pituitary gonadotropic cells. It is regulated by the [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] from the  [[hypothalamus]]. [[Inhibin]], [[activin]], and [[sex hormone]]s do not affect genetic activity  for the beta subunit production of LH.

==Activity==
In both males and females, LH is essential for reproduction.

* In ''females'', LH supports [[theca cell]]s in the ovaries that provide [[androgen]]s and hormonal precursors for estradiol production. At the time of menstruation, FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting [[granulosa cell]]s.<ref name="Colorado">{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/hypopit/lhfsh.html|title=Gonadotropins: Luteinizing and Follicle Stimulating Hormones|last=Bowen|first=R.|date=13 May 2004|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref> With the rise in [[oestrogen|estrogen]]s, LH receptors are also expressed on the maturing follicle, which causes it to produce more [[estradiol]]. Eventually, when the follicle has fully matured, a spike in 17-hydroxyprogesterone production by the follicle inhibits the production of estrogen, leading to a decrease in estrogen-mediated [[negative feedback]] of [[GnRH]] in the hypothalamus, which then stimulates the release of LH from the anterior pituitary. This increase in LH production only lasts for 24 to 48 hours. This "LH surge" triggers [[ovulation]], thereby not only releasing the egg from the follicle, but also initiating the conversion of the residual follicle into a [[corpus luteum]] that, in turn, produces [[progesterone]] to prepare the [[endometrium]] for a possible [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. LH is necessary to maintain luteal function for the first two weeks of the menstrual cycle. If [[pregnancy]] occurs, LH levels will decrease, and luteal function will instead be maintained by the action of HCG (a hormone very similar to LH but secreted from the new placenta).

* In the male, LH acts upon the [[Leydig cells]] of the [[testis]] and is responsible for the production of [[testosterone]], an [[androgen]] that exerts both endocrine activity and intratesticular activity on [[spermatogenesis]].

The release of LH at the pituitary gland is controlled by pulses of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) from the [[hypothalamus]]. Those pulses, in turn, are subject to the estrogen feedback from the gonads.

==Normal levels==
LH levels are normally low during [[childhood]] and, in women,  high after [[menopause]]. As LH is secreted as pulses, it is necessary to follow its concentration over a sufficient period of time to get a proper information about its blood level.

During the reproductive years, typical levels are  between 1-20 IU/L. Physiologic high LH levels are seen during the LH surge (v.s.); typically they last 48 hours.

In males over 18 years of age, reference ranges have been estimated to be 1.8-8.6 IU/L.<ref>[http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/8663 Mayo Medical Laboratories > Test ID: LH, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Serum], retrieved December 2012</ref>

== Predicting ovulation ==
The detection of a surge in release of luteinizing hormone indicates impending [[ovulation]]. LH can be detected by [[urinary]] ovulation predictor kits (OPK, also LH-kit) that are performed, typically daily, around the time ovulation may be expected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nielsen M, Barton S, Hatasaka H, Stanford J |title=Comparison of several one-step home urinary luteinizing hormone detection test kits to OvuQuick |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=384–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11476792 |doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(01)01881-7}}</ref>  A conversion from a negative to a positive reading would suggest that ovulation is about to occur within 24–48 hours, giving women two days to engage in [[sexual intercourse]] or [[artificial insemination]] with the intentions of [[conceiving]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinelandpress.com/faq/opk.html|title=Ovulation Predictor Kit Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Fertility Plus|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>

Tests may be read manually using a colour-change paper strip, or digitally with the assistance of reading electronics.

Tests for luteinising hormone may be combined with testing for [[estradiol]] in tests such as the Clearblue [[fertility monitor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opregnancy.com/how-to-get-pregnant/|title= How to Get Pregnant|year=2009|publisher=OPregnancy.com|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>

The sensitivity of LH tests are measured in [[milli international unit]], with tests commonly available in the range 10–40 m.i.u.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

As sperm can stay viable in the woman for several days, LH tests are not recommended for [[contraceptive]] practices, as the LH surge typically occurs after the beginning of the fertile window.

==Disease states==

=== Relative elevations ===

In children with [[precocious puberty]] of pituitary or central origin, LH and FSH levels may be in the reproductive range instead of the low levels typical for their age.

During the reproductive years, relatively elevated LH is frequently seen in patients with the [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]; however, it would be unusual for them to have LH levels outside of the normal reproductive range.

===High LH levels===
Persistently high LH levels are indicative of situations where the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to a pituitary production of  both LH and FSH. While this is typical in the menopause, it is abnormal in the reproductive years. There it may be a sign of:
# [[Premature menopause]]
# [[Gonadal dysgenesis]], [[Turner syndrome]]
# [[Castration]]
# [[Swyer syndrome]]
# [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]]
# Certain forms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]
# [[Testicle|Testicular]] failure
# [[Pregnancy-BetaHCG can mimic LH so tests may show elevated LH]]

=== Deficient LH activity ===
Diminished secretion of LH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifest in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, [[amenorrhea]]  is commonly observed.
Conditions with very low LH secretions are:
# [[Kallmann syndrome]]
# [[Hypothalamic suppression]]
# [[Hypopituitarism]]
# [[Eating disorder]]
# [[Female athlete triad]]
# [[Hyperprolactinemia]]
# [[Hypogonadism]]
# Gonadal suppression therapy 
##[[GnRH antagonist]]
##[[GnRH agonist]] ([[downregulation]])

==Availability==
LH  is available mixed with FSH in the form of [[Pergonal]], and other forms of urinary [[gonadotropins]] . More purified forms of urinary gonadotropins may reduce the LH portion in relation to FSH. Recombinant LH is available as lutropin alfa (Luveris).<ref>[http://www.fertilitylifelines.com/serono/products/luveris/index.jsp Luveris information]</ref>  All these medications have to be given parenterally. They are commonly used in infertility therapy to stimulate follicular development, the notable one being in [[IVF]] therapy.

Often, HCG medication is used as an LH substitute because it activates the same receptor. Medically used hCG is derived from urine of pregnant women, is less costly, and has a longer half-life than LH.
