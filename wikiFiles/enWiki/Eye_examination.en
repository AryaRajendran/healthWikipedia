[[Image:Snellen chart.svg|thumb|200 px|Traditional [[Snellen chart]] used for [[visual acuity]] testing]]
An '''eye examination''' is a series of tests performed by an [[ophthalmologist]], [[optometrist]], or [[orthoptist]] assessing [[Visual acuity|vision]] and ability to [[Focus (optics)|focus]] on and discern objects, as well as other tests and examinations pertaining to the [[human eye|eye]]s.
Health care professionals often recommend that all people should have periodic and thorough eye examinations as part of routine primary care, especially since many [[List of eye diseases and disorders|eye disease]]s are  [[symptom#Types|asymptomatic]].

Eye examinations may detect potentially treatable [[blindness|blinding]] eye diseases, [[ocular manifestation of systemic disease|ocular manifestations of systemic disease]], or signs of [[tumour]]s or other anomalies of the [[brain]].

==Overview==
Ideally, the eye examination consists of an external examination, followed by specific tests for [[visual acuity]], [[pupil]] function, [[extraocular muscles|extraocular muscle]] motility, [[visual field]]s, [[intraocular pressure]] and [[ophthalmoscopy]] through a dilated pupil.

A minimal eye examination consists of tests for visual acuity, pupil function, and extraocular muscle motility, as well as direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil.

==Basic examination==
===Visual acuity===
{{main|Visual acuity}}
Visual acuity is the eye's ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye's ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance.
The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc.  The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a "person of normal vision" at the specified distance.  For example, if one can see at a distance of 20&nbsp;ft an object that normally can be seen at 20&nbsp;ft, then one has 20/20 vision.  If one can see at 20&nbsp;ft what a normal person can see at 40&nbsp;ft, then one has 20/40 vision.  Put another way, suppose you have trouble seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20&nbsp;ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision.  The 6/6 terminology is more commonly used in Europe and Australia, and represents the distance in metres.

This is often measured with a [[Snellen chart]].

===Refraction===
Refractive error is an optical abnormality of the eye in which a corrective lens is needed for proper focusing. Refraction is the procedure by which any refractice error is characterized and qualified. Refraction is often necessary to distinguish between blurred vision caused by refractive error or by medical abnormalities of the eye. [[Lensmeter]] is an instrument that measures the power of a patient's spectacles during an eye examination. Occasionally refraction is performed after instilling certain eye drops to inhibit accommodation which usually causes error in measurement especially in children. This technique is called "cycloplegic refraction". 

===Pupil function===
{{main|Pupil}}
[[File:CCMDonation11.JPG|thumb|Medical student giving eye exam at [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City|ITESM-Campus Ciudad de MÃ©xico]].]]
An examination of pupilary function includes inspecting the pupils for equal size (1&nbsp;mm or less of difference may be normal), regular shape, reactivity to light, and direct and consensual accommodation.
These steps can be easily remembered with the [[mnemonic]] ''PERRLA (D+C)'': '''P'''upils '''E'''qual and '''R'''ound; '''R'''eactive to '''L'''ight and '''A'''ccommodation ('''D'''irect and '''C'''onsensual).

A [[swinging-flashlight test]] may also be desirable if [[neurology|neurologic]] damage is suspected.
The swinging-flashlight test is the most useful clinical test available to a [[general physician]] for the assessment of [[optic nerve]] anomalies. 
This test detects the [[Marcus Gunn pupil|afferent pupil defect]], also referred to as the Marcus Gunn pupil. It is conducted in a semidarkened room.
In a normal reaction to the swinging-flashlight test, both pupils constrict when one is exposed to [[light]].
As the light is being moved from one eye to another, both eyes begin to dilate, but constrict again when light has reached the other eye.

If there is an [[efferent nerve|efferent]] defect in the left eye, the left pupil will remain dilated regardless of where the light is shining, while the right pupil will respond normally.
If there is an [[afferent nerve|afferent]] defect in the left eye, both pupils will dilate when the light is shining on the left eye, but both will constrict when it is shining on the right eye. This is because the left eye will not respond to external stimulus (afferent pathway) but can still receive neural signals from the brain (efferent pathway) to constrict.

If there is a unilateral small pupil with normal reactivity to light, it is unlikely that a [[neuropathy]] is present.
However, if accompanied by [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] of the upper [[eyelid]], this may indicate [[Horner's syndrome]].

If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]], this is an [[Argyll Robertson pupil]].

===Ocular motility===
{{main|Extraocular muscles}}
Ocular motility should always be tested, especially when patients complain of double vision or physicians suspect neurologic disease.
First, the doctor should visually assess the eyes for deviations that could result from [[strabismus]], extraocular muscle dysfunction, or [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]] of the cranial nerves innervating the extraocular muscles.
[[Saccade]]s are assessed by having the patient move his or her eye quickly to a target at the far right, left, top and bottom. This tests for saccadic dysfunction whereupon poor ability of the eyes to "jump" from one place to another may impinge on reading ability and other skills, whereby the eyes are required to fixate and follow a desired object.

The patient is asked to follow a target with both eyes as it is moved in each of the eight cardinal directions of gaze. The examiner notes the speed, smoothness, range and symmetry of movements and observes for unsteadiness of fixation. These eight fields of gaze test the extraocular muscles: [[inferior rectus muscle|inferior]], [[superior rectus muscle|superior]], [[lateral rectus muscle|lateral]] and [[medial rectus muscle|medial]] rectus [[muscle]]s, as well as the [[superior oblique muscle|superior]] and [[inferior oblique muscle|inferior]] oblique muscles.

===Visual field (confrontation) testing===
{{main|Visual field|Visual field test}}
Testing the visual fields consists of confrontation field testing in which each eye is tested separately to assess the extent of the peripheral field.

To perform the test, the individual occludes one eye while fixated on the examiner's eye with the non-occluded eye.
The patient is then asked to count the number of fingers that are briefly flashed in each of the four quadrants.
This method is preferred to the ''wiggly finger test'' that was historically used because it represents a rapid and efficient way of answering the same question: is the peripheral visual field affected?

Common problems of the visual field include [[scotoma]] (area of reduced vision), [[hemianopia]] (half of visual field lost), [[homonymous hemianopsia]] and [[bitemporal hemianopia]].

===External examination===

External examination of eyes consists of inspection of the [[eyelid]]s, surrounding tissues and [[palpebral fissure]].
Palpation of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] rim may also be desirable, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms.
The [[conjunctiva]] and [[sclera]] can be inspected by having the individual look up, and shining a light while retracting the upper or lower eyelid. The position of the eyelids are checked for abnormalities such as [[ptosis]] which is an asymmetry between eyelid positions.

===Slit-lamp===
[[Image:Slit lamp Eye examination by Ophthalmologist.jpg|thumb|Slit lamp examination of the eyes in an ophthalmology clinic]]
Close inspection of the anterior eye structures and ocular adnexa are often done with a [[slit lamp]] which is a table mounted microscope with a special adjustable illumination source attached. A small beam of light that can be varied in width, height, incident angle, orientation and colour, is passed over the eye. Often, this light beam is narrowed into a vertical "slit", during slit-lamp examination. The examiner views the illuminated ocular structures, through an optical system that magnifies the image of the eye and the patient is seated while being examined, and the head stabilized by an adjustable chin rest.

This allows inspection of all the ocular media, from cornea to vitreous, plus magnified view of eyelids, and other external ocular related structures. [[Fluorescein]] staining before slit lamp examination may reveal [[corneal abrasion]]s or [[herpes simplex]] infection.

The binocular slit-lamp examination provides stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in striking detail, enabling exact anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions. 

Also [[ophthalmoscopy]] and [[gonioscopy]] examinations can also be performed through the slit lamp when combined with special lenses. These lenses include the Goldmann 3-mirror lens, gonioscopy single-mirror/ Zeiss 4-mirror lens for (ocular) anterior chamber angle structures and +90D lens, +78D lens, +66D lens & Hruby (-56D) lens, the examination of retinal structures is accomplished.

===Intraocular pressure===
Intraocular pressure (IOP) can be measured by [[Tonometry]] devices. The eye can be thought of as an enclosed compartment through which there is a constant circulation of fluid that maintains its shape and internal pressure. Tonometry is a method of measuring this pressure using various instruments. The normal range is 10-21 mmHg.

===Retinal examination===
[[File:Fully dilated eye during eye exam.jpg|thumb|right|Fully dilated pupil prior to ophthalmoscopic examination]]
Examination of retina (fundus examination) is an important part of the general eye examination. Dilating the pupil using special eye drops greatly enhances the view and permits an extensive examination of peripheral retina. A limited view can be obtained through an undilated pupil, in which case best results are obtained with the room darkened and the patient looking towards the far corner. The appearance of the [[optic disc]] and retinal vasculature are also recorded during fundus examination.

A [[red reflex]] can be seen when looking at a patient's pupil through a direct [[ophthalmoscope]].  This part of the examination is done from a distance of about 50&nbsp;cm and is usually symmetrical between the two eyes.  An opacity may indicate a cataract.

== Eye exams for children ==
{{see also|pediatric ophthalmology}}
Children should have their first eye exam at 6 months old.  If a parent suspects something is wrong an ophthalmologist can check even earlier. 

Early eye exams are important because children need the following basic visual skills for learning:
* Near vision
* Distance vision: Tumbling E chart, Landolt C chart
* Eye teaming ([[binocularity]])
* Eye movement
* Accommodation (focusing skills)
* Peripheral vision
* [[Eyeâhand coordination]]

Because of the importance of eye exams before students begin school, the [http://www.eyecareoao.com Ontario Association of Optometrists] started the [http://www.EyeSeeEyeLearn.ca Eye See...Eye Learn] program in Ontario after it was successfully launched in Alberta in 2003. The program provides OHIP insured eye exams and free eyeglasses to Junior Kindergarten children in participating regions. Currently the program is being offered in the following regions for the 2010/2011 year: Halton, Hamilton-Wentworth, Peel and Windsor-Essex.
