'''Fine-needle aspiration biopsy''' ('''FNAB''', '''FNA''' or '''NAB'''), or '''fine-needle aspiration cytology''' ('''FNAC'''), is a diagnostic procedure used to investigate superficial (just under the skin) lumps or masses. In this technique, a thin, hollow [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] is inserted into the mass for [[sampling (medicine)|sampling]] of cells that, after being stained, will be examined under a [[microscope]]. There could be cytology exam of aspirate (cell specimen evaluation, FNAC) or histological ([[biopsy]] - tissue specimen evaluation, FNAB).<ref>http://www.indepreviews.com/article/2011/vol-13-no-1/006-084-FINE-NEEDLE-ASPIRATION-CYTOLOGY-%28F-N-A-C%29.pdf</ref> Fine-needle aspiration biopsies are very safe, minor [[surgery|surgical]] procedures. Often, a major surgical (excisional or open) biopsy can be avoided by performing a needle aspiration biopsy instead. In 1981, the first fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the United States was done at [[Maimonides Medical Center]], eliminating the need for surgery and hospitalization. Today, this procedure is widely used in the diagnosis of cancer.<ref>http://www.maimonidesmed.org/Main/CultureofInnovation.aspx, First US Procedure</ref>

A needle aspiration biopsy is safer and less traumatic than an open surgical biopsy, and significant complications are usually rare, depending on the body site. Common complications include bruising and soreness. There is a risk, because the biopsy is very small (only a few cells), that the problematic cells will be missed, resulting in a false negative result. There is also a risk that the cells taken will not enable a definitive diagnosis.

==Applications==
This type of sampling is performed for one of two reasons:

# A biopsy is performed on a lump or a tissue mass when its nature is in question.
# For known tumors, this biopsy is performed to assess the effect of treatment or to obtain tissue for special studies.

When the lump can be felt, the biopsy is usually performed by a [[cytopathologist]] or a [[surgeon]]. In this case, the procedure is usually short and simple. Otherwise, it may be performed by an interventional [[radiologist]], a doctor with training in performing such biopsies under [[x-ray]] or [[ultrasound]] guidance. In this case, the procedure may require more extensive preparation and take more time to perform.

Also, fine-needle aspiration is the main method used for [[chorionic villus sampling]],<ref>[http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/chorionic-villus-sampling-cvs-what-you-need-know Chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis: information for you] from [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]]. Date published: 01/06/2006 </ref> as well as for many types of [[body fluid sampling]].

==Preparation==
Several preparations may be necessary before this procedure.

* No use of [[aspirin]] or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]]) for one week before the procedure;
* No food intake a few hours before the procedure;
* Routine blood tests (including [[clotting]] profile) must be completed two weeks before the biopsy;
* Suspension of blood [[anticoagulant]] medications;
* [[Antibiotic]] [[prophylaxis]] may be instituted.

Before the procedure is started, vital signs ([[pulse]], [[blood pressure]], temperature, etc.) may be taken. Then, depending on the nature of the biopsy, an [[intravenous line]] may be placed. Very anxious patients may want to be given sedation through this line. For patients with less anxiety, oral medication ([[Valium]]) can be prescribed to be taken before the procedure.

==Procedure==
[[File:Needle biopsy.jpg|thumb|A physician's hands are seen performing a needle biopsy to determine nature of lump either fluid-filled cyst or solid tumor.]]
The [[skin]] above the area to be biopsied is swabbed with an [[antiseptic]] solution and draped with sterile surgical towels. The skin, underlying [[fat tissue|fat]], and [[muscle]] may be numbed with a [[local anesthetic]], although this is often not necessary with superficial masses. After locating the mass for biopsy, using x-rays or [[palpation]], a special needle of very fine diameter is passed into the mass. The needle may be inserted and withdrawn several times. There are many reasons for this:

* One needle may be used as a guide, with the other needles placed along it to achieve a more precise position.
* Sometimes, several passes may be needed to obtain enough cells for the intricate tests which the cytopathologists perform.
After the needles are placed into the mass, cells are withdrawn by aspiration with a [[syringe]] and spread on a glass slide. The patient's vital signs are taken again, and the patient is removed to an observation area for about 3 to 5 hours.
* For biopsies in the breast, ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy is the most common.

==Post-operative care and complications==
As with any surgical procedure, complications are possible. Fortunately, major complications due to thin needle aspiration biopsies are fairly uncommon, and when complications do occur, they are generally mild. The kind and severity of complications depend on the organs from which a biopsy is taken or the organs gone through to obtain cells.

After the procedure, mild analgesics are used to control post-operative pain. Aspirin or aspirin substitutes should not be taken for 48 hours after the procedure (unless aspirin is prescribed for a cardiac or neurological condition). Since sterility is maintained throughout the procedure, [[infection]] is rare. But should an infection occur, it will be treated with [[antibiotics]]. [[Bleeding]] is the most common complication of this procedure. A slight bruise may also appear. If a [[lung]] or [[kidney]] biopsy has been performed, it is very common to see a small amount of blood in [[sputum]] or [[urine]] after the procedure. Only a small amount of bleeding should occur. During the observation period after the procedure, bleeding should decrease over time. If more bleeding occurs, this will be monitored until it subsides. Rarely, major surgery will be necessary to stop the bleeding.

A recent study showed that in one case a needle biopsy of a liver tumor resulted in spread of the cancer along the path of the needle, and concluded that needle aspiration was dangerous and unnecessary.  The conclusions drawn from this paper were strongly criticized subsequently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/328/7438/507 |title=bmj.com |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref>

Other complications depend upon the body part on which the biopsy takes place:

* Lung biopsies are frequently complicated by [[pneumothorax]] (collapsed lung). This complication can also accompany biopsies in the upper [[abdomen]] near the base of the lung. About one-quarter to one-half of patients having lung biopsies will develop pneumothorax. Usually, the degree of collapse is small and resolves on its own without treatment. A small percentage of patients will develop a pneumothorax serious enough to require hospitalization and placement of a [[chest tube]] for treatment. Although it is impossible to predict in whom this will occur, collapsed lungs are more frequent and more serious in patients with severe emphysema and in patients in whom the biopsy is difficult to perform.
* For [[Liver biopsy|biopsies of the liver]], [[bile]] leakages may occur, but these are quite rare.
* [[Pancreatitis]] (inflammation of the [[pancreas]]) may occur after biopsies in the area around the pancreas.
* Deaths have been reported from needle aspiration biopsies, but such outcomes are extremely rare.
