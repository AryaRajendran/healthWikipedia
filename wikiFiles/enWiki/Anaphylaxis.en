<!--Definition, symptoms, and causes  -->
'''Anaphylaxis''' is a serious [[allergic reaction]] that is rapid in onset and may cause death.<ref name=Tint10>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=177–182 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> It typically causes a number of symptoms including an itchy rash, throat swelling, and low [[blood pressure]]. Common causes include insect bites/stings, foods, and medications.

<!--Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management  -->
On a [[Pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] level, anaphylaxis is caused by the release of mediators from certain types of [[white blood cells]] triggered either by [[immune system|immunologic]] or non-immunologic mechanisms. It is diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms and signs. The primary treatment is injection of [[epinephrine]], with other measures being complementary.

<!--Epidemiology and history  -->
Worldwide 0.05–2% of people are estimated to have anaphylaxis at some point in their life and rates appear to be increasing.<ref name=World11/> The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἀνά ana, ''against'', and φύλαξις phylaxis, ''protection''.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis.png|thumb|250px|Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis.]]
Anaphylaxis typically presents with many different symptoms over minutes or hours<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oswalt ML, Kemp SF |title=Anaphylaxis: office management and prevention |journal=Immunol Allergy Clin North Am |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=177–91, vi |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17493497 |doi=10.1016/j.iac.2007.03.004|quote=Clinically, anaphylaxis is considered likely to be present if any one of three criteria is satisfied within minutes to hours}}</ref><ref name=Review09/> with an average onset of 5 to 30&nbsp;minutes if exposure is intravenous and 2&nbsp;hours for foods.<ref name=Rosen2010/> The most common areas affected include: skin (80–90%), respiratory (70%), gastrointestinal (30–45%), heart and vasculature (10–45%), and central nervous system (10–15%)<ref name=Review09/> with usually two or more being involved.<ref name=World11/>

===Skin===
[[File:BackRed.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hives]] and flushing on the back of a person with anaphylaxis]] 
Symptoms typically include [[hives|generalized hives]], [[pruritus|itchiness]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]] or swelling of the lips.<ref name=Diag06>{{cite journal |author=Sampson HA, Muñoz-Furlong A, Campbell RL, ''et al.'' |title=Second symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis: summary report—Second National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium |journal=J.

===Respiratory===
Respiratory symptoms and signs that may be present, including shortness of breath, [[wheezes]] or [[stridor]].<ref name=Diag06/> The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the [[bronchial]] muscles<ref name=Cardio08/> while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling.<ref name=Aus06>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=SG|coauthors=Mullins, RJ, Gold, MS|title=Anaphylaxis: diagnosis and management|journal=The Medical journal of Australia|date=2006 Sep 4|volume=185|issue=5|pages=283–9|pmid=16948628}}</ref> Hoarseness, pain with swallowing, or a cough may also occur.<ref name=Rosen2010/>

[[Coronary artery spasm]] may occur with subsequent [[myocardial infarction]], [[cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]], or [[cardiac arrest]]<!--  even in the absence of epinephrine use -->.<ref name=World11/><ref name=Review09/> Those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis.<ref name=Cardio08/> The coronary spasm is related to the presence of histamine-releasing cells in the heart.<ref name=Cardio08/> While [[tachycardia|a fast heart rate]] caused by low blood pressure is more common,<ref name=Aus06/> a [[Bezold–Jarisch reflex]] has been described in 10% of cases, where a [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]] is associated with [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].<ref name=CEA11/> A drop in [[blood pressure]] or [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] (either [[distributive shock|distributive]] or [[cardiogenic shock|cardiogenic]]) may cause the feeling of lightheadedness or [[loss of consciousness]].<ref name=Cardio08/> Rarely very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis.<ref name=Shock10/>

===Other===
Gastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy [[abdominal pain]], diarrhea, and vomiting.<ref name=Diag06/> There may be confusion, a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to that of [[uterus|uterine]] cramps.<ref name=Diag06/><ref name=Aus06/> Dilation of blood vessels around the brain may cause [[headaches]].<ref name=Rosen2010/> A feeling of [[anxiety]] or of "impending doom" has also been described.<ref name=World11/>

==Causes==
Anaphylaxis can occur in response to almost any foreign substance.<ref name=His11/> Common triggers include [[venom]] from [[insect bites and stings|insect bites or stings]], foods, and [[medication]].<ref name=CEA11/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Worm|first=M|title=Epidemiology of anaphylaxis|journal=Chemical immunology and allergy|year=2010|volume=95|pages=12–21|pmid=20519879|doi=10.1159/000315935|series=Chemical Immunology and Allergy|isbn=978-3-8055-9441-7}}</ref> Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults.<ref name=World11/> Less common causes include: physical factors, biological agents such as [[semen]], latex, hormonal changes, food additives such as monosodium glutamate and food colors, and topical medications.<ref name=Aus06/> Physical factors such as exercise (known as exercise-induced anaphylaxis) or temperature (either hot or cold) may also act as triggers through their direct effects on [[mast cell]]s.<ref name=World11/><ref name=APLS07>{{cite book|last=editors|first=Marianne Gausche-Hill, Susan Fuchs, Loren Yamamoto,|title=The pediatric emergency medicine resource|year=2007|publisher=Jones & Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=978-0-7637-4414-4|pages=69|edition=Rev. 4.|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=lLVfDC2dh54C&pg=PA69}}</ref> Exercise induced events are frequently associated with the ingestion of certain foods.<ref name=Rosen2010/> During [[anesthesia]], [[neuromuscular blocking agents]], antibiotics, and [[latex]] are the most common causes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dewachter|first=P|coauthors=Mouton-Faivre, C, Emala, CW|title=Anaphylaxis and anesthesia: controversies and new insights|journal=Anesthesiology|date=2009 Nov|volume=111|issue=5|pages=1141–50|pmid=19858877|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181bbd443}}</ref> The cause remains unknown in 32-50% of cases, referred to as "idiopathic anaphylaxis".<ref name="editor 2010 223">{{cite book|last=editor|first=Mariana C.

===Food===
Many foods can trigger anaphylaxis; this may occur upon the first known ingestion.<ref name=CEA11/>  Common triggering foods vary around the world.  In Western cultures, ingestion of or exposure to peanuts, wheat, tree nuts, [[shellfish]], fish, milk, and eggs are the most prevalent causes.<ref name=World11/><ref name=Review09/> [[Sesame]] is common in the Middle East, while rice and [[chickpeas|chickpea]] are frequently encountered as sources of anaphylaxis in Asia.<ref name=World11/> Severe cases are usually caused by ingesting the allergen,<ref name=CEA11/> but some people experience a severe reaction upon contact. Children can outgrow their allergies.  By age 16, 80% of children with anaphylaxis to milk or eggs and 20% who experience isolated anaphylaxis to peanuts can tolerate these foods.<ref name=His11/>

===Medication===
Any medication may potentially trigger anaphylaxis. The most common are [[β-lactam antibiotics]] (such as [[penicillin]]) followed by [[aspirin]] and [[NSAIDs]].<ref name=Review09/><ref name=Book2009>{{cite book|last=Volcheck|first=Gerald W.|title=Clinical allergy : diagnosis and management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-1-58829-616-0|pages=442|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=pWZLkZB7EW8C&pg=PA442}}</ref> Other [[antibiotics]] are implicated less frequently and the reactions to NSAIDs are agent specific meaning that if one is allergic to one NSAID they can typically tolerate a different one.<ref name=Book2009/>  Other relatively common causes include [[chemotherapy]], [[vaccines]], [[protamine]] and herbal preparations.<ref name=World11/><ref name=Book2009/> Some medications ([[vancomycin]], [[morphine]], [[radiocontrast|x-ray contrast]] among others) cause anaphylaxis by directly triggering mast cell degranulation.<ref name=CEA11/>

The frequency of a reaction to an agent partly depends on the frequency of its use and partly on its intrinsic properties.<ref name=Drug01>{{cite journal|last=Drain|first=KL|coauthors=Volcheck, GW|title=Preventing and managing drug-induced anaphylaxis|journal=Drug safety : an international journal of medical toxicology and drug experience|year=2001|volume=24|issue=11|pages=843–53|pmid=11665871|doi=10.2165/00002018-200124110-00005}}</ref> Anaphylaxis to penicillins or [[cephalosporins]] only occurs after they bind to proteins inside the body with some agents binding more easily than other.<ref name=Rosen2010/> Anaphylaxis to penicillin occurs once in every 2,000 to 10,000 courses of treatment, with death occurring in less than one in every 50,000 courses of treatment.<ref name=Rosen2010/> Anaphylaxis to aspirin and NSAIDs occurs in about one in every 50,000 persons.<ref name=Rosen2010/> If someone has a reaction to penicillins their risk of a reaction to cephalosporins is greater but still less than one in 1000.<ref name=Rosen2010/> The old radiocontrast agents caused reactions in 1% of cases while the newer lower osmolar agents cause reactions in 0.04% of cases.<ref name=Drug01/>

===Venom===
Venom from stinging or biting insects such as [[Hymenoptera]] (bees and wasps) or [[Triatominae]] (kissing bugs) may induce anaphylaxis in susceptible people.<ref name=Review09/><ref name="Klotz">{{cite journal|last=Klotz|first=JH|coauthors=Dorn, PL, Logan, JL, Stevens, L, Pinnas, JL, Schmidt, JO, Klotz, SA|title="Kissing bugs": potential disease vectors and cause of anaphylaxis|journal=Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=2010 Jun 15|volume=50|issue=12|pages=1629–34|pmid=20462351|doi=10.1086/652769}}</ref> Previous [[Systemic disease|systemic reactions]], which are anything more than a local reaction around the site of the sting, are a risk factor for future anaphylaxis;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bilò|first=MB|title=Anaphylaxis caused by Hymenoptera stings: from epidemiology to treatment|journal=Allergy|date=2011 Jul|volume=66 Suppl 95|pages=35–7|pmid=21668850|doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2011.02630.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=L|coauthors=Larenas-Linnemann, D, Lockey, RF, Passalacqua, G|title=Speaking the same language: The World Allergy Organization Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Systemic Reaction Grading System|journal=The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology|date=2010 Mar|volume=125|issue=3|pages=569–74, 574.e1–574.e7|pmid=20144472|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2009.10.060}}</ref> however, half of fatalities have had no previous systemic reaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bilò|first=BM|coauthors=Bonifazi, F|title=Epidemiology of insect-venom anaphylaxis|journal=Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology|date=2008 Aug|volume=8|issue=4|pages=330–7|pmid=18596590|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32830638c5}}</ref>

===Risk factors===
People with [[atopic]] diseases such as [[asthma]], [[eczema]], or [[allergic rhinitis]] are at high risk of anaphylaxis from food, [[latex]], and [[radiocontrast]] but not from injectable medications or stings.<ref name=World11/><ref name=CEA11/> One study in children found that 60% had a history of previous atopic diseases, and of those who die from anaphylaxis more than 90% have asthma.<ref name=CEA11/> Those with [[mastocytosis]] or of a higher [[socioeconomic status]] are at increased risk.<ref name=World11/><ref name=CEA11/> The longer the time since the last exposure to the agent in question the lower the risk.<ref name=Rosen2010/>

==Pathophysiology==
Anaphylaxis is a severe [[allergic reaction]] of rapid onset affecting many [[body systems]].<ref name=Tint10/><ref name=Khan11>{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=BQ|coauthors=Kemp, SF|title=Pathophysiology of anaphylaxis|journal=Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology|date=2011 Aug|volume=11|issue=4|pages=319–25|pmid=21659865|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e3283481ab6}}</ref> It is due to the release of [[inflammatory mediators]] and [[cytokines]] from mast cells and [[basophil]]s, typically due to an [[Immune system|immunologic reaction]] but sometimes non-immunologic mechanism.<ref name=Khan11/>

===Immunologic===
In the immunologic mechanism, [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE) binds to the [[antigen]] (the foreign material that provokes the allergic reaction). Antigen-bound IgE then activates [[FcεRI]] receptors on mast cells and basophils. This leads to the release of inflammatory mediators such as [[histamine]]. These mediators subsequently increase the contraction of bronchial [[smooth muscle]]s, trigger [[vasodilation]], increase the leakage of fluid from blood vessels, and cause heart muscle depression.<ref name=Rosen2010/><ref name=Khan11/> There is also an immunologic mechanism that does not rely on IgE, but it is not known if this occurs in humans.<ref name=Khan11/>

===Non-immunologic===
Non-immunologic mechanisms involved substances that directly cause the [[degranulation]] of mast cells and basophils.<!-- <ref name=Khan11/> --> These include agents such as [[contrast medium]], [[opioids]], temperature (hot or cold), and vibration.<ref name=APLS07/><ref name=Khan11/>

==Diagnosis==
Anaphylaxis is diagnosed based on clinical criteria.<ref name=World11/> When any one of the following three occurs within minutes/hours of exposure to an allergen there is a high likelihood of anaphylaxis:<ref name=World11/>
# Involvement of the skin or mucosal tissue plus either respiratory difficulty or a low [[blood pressure]]
# Two or more of the following symptoms:-
#: a. Involvement of the skin or mucosa
#: b. Respiratory difficulties
#: c. Low blood pressure
#: d. Gastrointestinal symptoms
# Low blood pressure after exposure to a known allergen

During an attack, blood tests for [[tryptase]] or [[histamine]] (released from mast cells) might be useful in diagnosing anaphylaxis due to insect stings or medications.<!-- <ref name=World11/> --> However these tests are of limited utility if the cause is food or if the person has a normal [[blood pressure]],<ref name=World11/> and they are not [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] for the diagnosis.<ref name=His11/>

===Classification===
There are three main classifications of anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock is associated with systemic [[vasodilation]] that causes [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] which is by definition 30% lower than the person's baseline or below standard values.<ref name=Shock10>{{cite journal|last=Limsuwan|first=T|coauthors=Demoly, P|title=Acute symptoms of drug hypersensitivity (urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock)|journal=The Medical clinics of North America|date=2010 Jul|volume=94|issue=4|pages=691–710, x|pmid=20609858|url=http://smschile.cl/documentos/cursos2010/MedicalClinicsNorthAmerica/Acute%20Symptoms%20of%20Drug%20Hypersensitivity%20(Urticaria,%20Angioedema,%20Anaphylaxis,%20Anaphylactic%20Shock).pdf|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.03.007}}</ref> Biphasic anaphylaxis is the recurrence of symptoms within 1–72 hours with no further exposure to the allergen.<ref name=World11/> Reports of incidence vary, with some studies claiming as many as 20% of cases.<ref name=BI05/> The recurrence typically occurs within 8 hours.<ref name=CEA11/> It is managed in the same manner as anaphylaxis.<ref name=Review09/>  Pseudoanaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are a type of anaphylaxis that does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell [[degranulation]].<ref name=CEA11>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=JK|coauthors=Vadas, P|title=Anaphylaxis: mechanisms and management|journal=Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=2011 Jul|volume=41|issue=7|pages=923–38|pmid=21668816|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03779.x}}</ref><ref name=His10/> Non-immune anaphylaxis is the current term use by the [[World Allergy Organization]]<ref name=His10/> with some recommending that the old terminology no longer be used.<ref name=CEA11/>

===Allergy testing===
[[File:Allergy skin testing.JPG|thumb|[[Skin allergy testing]] being carried out on the right arm]]
[[Allergy testing]] may help in determining the trigger. [[Skin allergy test]]ing (such as [[Patch test (medicine)|patch testing]]) is available for certain foods and venoms.<ref name=His11/> Blood testing for specific IgE can be useful to confirm milk, egg, peanut, tree nut and fish allergies.<ref name=His11/> Skin testing is available to confirm [[penicillin]] allergies but is not available for other medications.<ref name=His11/> Non-immune forms of anaphylaxis can only be determined by history or exposure to the allergen in question, and not by skin or blood testing.<ref name=His10/>

===Differential diagnosis===
It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from [[asthma]], [[syncopy]], and [[panic attacks]].<ref name=World11/> Asthma however typically does not entail itching or gastrointestinal symptoms, syncope presents with pallor rather than a rash, and a panic attack may have flushing but does not have hives.<ref name=World11/> Other conditions that may present similarly include: [[Scombroid food poisoning|scrombroidosis]] and [[anisakiasis]].<ref name=CEA11/>

===Post-mortem findings===
In a person who died from anaphylaxis, [[autopsy]] may show an "empty heart" attributed to reduced venous return from [[vasodilation]] and redistribution of intravascular volume from the central to the peripheral compartment.<ref>Anaphylaxis, Author: Stephen F Kemp, MD, FACP; Chief Editor: Michael A Kaliner, MD;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/135065-overview#showall</ref> Other signs are laryngeal edema, eosinophilia in lungs, heart and tissues, and evidence of myocardial hypoperfusion.<ref name=DaBroi/> Laboratory findings could detect increased levels of serum [[tryptase]], increase in total and specific IgE serum levels.<ref name=DaBroi>{{cite journal|last=Da Broi|first=U|coauthors=Moreschi, C|title=Post-mortem diagnosis of anaphylaxis: A difficult task in forensic medicine|journal=Forensic Science International|date=2011 Jan 30|volume=204|issue=1–3|pages=1–5|pmid=20684869|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2010.04.039}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Avoidance of the trigger of anaphylaxis is recommended.<!-- <ref name=World11/> --> In cases where this may not be possible, desensitization may be an option.<!-- <ref name=World11/> --> [[Immunotherapy]] with [[Hymenoptera]] venoms is effective at desensitizing 80–90% of adults and 98% of children against allergies to [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[hornet]]s, [[yellowjacket]]s, and [[fire ants]].<!-- <ref name=World11/> --> Oral immunotherapy may be effective at desensitizing some people to certain food including milk, eggs, nuts and peanuts; however adverse effects are common.<!-- <ref name=World11/> --> Desensitization is also possible for many medications, however it is advised that most people simply avoid the agent in question.<!-- <ref name=World11/> --> In those who react to latex, it may be important to avoid cross-reactive foods such as avocados, bananas, and potatoes among others.<ref name=World11/>

==Management==
Anaphylaxis is a [[medical emergency]] that may require [[resuscitation]] measures such as [[airway management]], supplemental oxygen, large volumes of [[intravenous fluids]], and close monitoring.<ref name=Review09/>  Administration of epinephrine is the treatment of choice with antihistamines and steroids often used as adjuncts.<ref name=World11/>  A period of in hospital observation for between 2 and 24 hours is recommended for people once they have returned to normal due to concerns of biphasic anaphylaxis.<ref name=Rosen2010/><ref name=CEA11/><ref name=BI05/><ref name=UK08>{{cite web |url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf |title=Emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions – Guidelines for healthcare providers |month=January | year=2008 |accessdate=2008-04-22 |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Resuscitation Council (UK)}}</ref>

===Epinephrine===
[[File:Epipen.jpg|thumb|An old version of an EpiPen auto-injector]]
[[Epinephrine]] (adrenaline) is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no [[absolute contraindication]] to its use.<ref name=Review09/> It is recommended that an epinephrine solution be given [[intramuscularly]] into the mid anterolateral thigh as soon as the diagnosis is suspected.<!-- <ref name=World11/> --> The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if there is insufficient response.<ref name=World11/> A second dose is needed in 16-35% of episodes<ref name=CEA11/> with more than two doses rarely required.<ref name=World11/> The intramuscular route is preferred over [[subcutaneous]] administration because the latter may have delayed absorption.<ref name=Epi10>{{cite journal|last=Simons|first=KJ|coauthors=Simons, FE|title=Epinephrine and its use in anaphylaxis: current issues|journal=Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology|date=2010 Aug|volume=10|issue=4|pages=354–61|pmid=20543673|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32833bc670}}</ref> Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include [[tremor]]s, [[anxiety]], headaches, and [[palpitations]].<ref name=World11/>

People on [[β-blockers]] may be resistant to the effects of epinephrine.<ref name=CEA11/> In this situation if epinephrine is not effective intravenous [[glucagon]] can be administered which has a mechanism of action independent of [[β-receptor]]s.<ref name=CEA11/>

If necessary, it can also be given [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] using a dilute epinephrine solution. Intravenous epinephrine however has been associated both with [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]] and [[myocardial infarction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mueller|first=UR|title=Cardiovascular disease and anaphylaxis|journal=Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology|date=2007 Aug|volume=7|issue=4|pages=337–41|pmid=17620826|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e328259c328}}</ref> [[Epinephrine autoinjector]] used for self-administration typically come in two doses, one for adults or children who weigh more than 25&nbsp;kg and one for children who weigh 10 to 25&nbsp;kg.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sicherer|first=SH|coauthors=Simons, FE, Section on Allergy and Immunology, American Academy of, Pediatrics|title=Self-injectable epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis|journal=Pediatrics|date=2007 Mar|volume=119|issue=3|pages=638–46|pmid=17332221|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-3689|last3=Section On Allergy Immunology}}</ref>

===Adjuncts===
[[Antihistamines]] (both [[H1 antihistamine|H1]] and [[H2 antagonist|H2]]), while commonly used and assumed effective based on theoretical reasoning, are poorly supported by evidence. A 2007 [[Cochrane review]] did not find any good-quality studies upon which to base recommendations<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sheikh A, Ten Broek V, Brown SG, Simons FE |title=H1-antihistamines for the treatment of anaphylaxis: Cochrane systematic review |journal=Allergy |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=830–7 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17620060 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01435.x |url=}}</ref> and they are not believed to have an effect on airway edema or spasm.<ref name=CEA11/>  [[Corticosteroids]] are unlikely to make a difference in the current episode of anaphylaxis, but may be used in the hope of decreasing the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis.

===Preparedness===
People prone to anaphylaxis are advised to have an "allergy action plan", and parents are advised to inform schools of their children's allergies and what to do in case of an anaphylactic emergency.<ref name=Mart08/>  The action plan usually includes use of [[epinephrine auto-injectors]], the recommendation to wear a [[medical alert bracelet]], and counseling on avoidance of triggers.<ref name=Mart08>{{cite journal|last=Martelli|first=A|coauthors=Ghiglioni, D, Sarratud, T, Calcinai, E, Veehof, S, Terracciano, L, Fiocchi, A|title=Anaphylaxis in the emergency department: a paediatric perspective|journal=Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology|date=2008 Aug|volume=8|issue=4|pages=321–9|pmid=18596589|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e328307a067}}</ref> [[Allergen immunotherapy|Immunotherapy]] is available for certain triggers to prevent future episodes of anaphylaxis.

==History==
The term "aphylaxis" was coined by [[Charles Richet]] in 1902 and later changed to "anaphylaxis" due to its nicer quality of speech.<ref name=His11>{{cite journal|last=Boden|first=SR|coauthors=Wesley Burks, A|title=Anaphylaxis: a history with emphasis on food allergy|journal=Immunological reviews|date=2011 Jul|volume=242|issue=1|pages=247–57|pmid=21682750|doi=10.1111/j.1600-065X.2011.01028.x|pmc=3122150}}</ref> He was subsequently awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology]] for his work on anaphylaxis in 1913.<ref name=Rosen2010/> The phenomenon itself however has been described since ancient times.<ref name=His10>{{cite journal|last=Ring|first=J|coauthors=Behrendt, H, de Weck, A|title=History and classification of anaphylaxis|journal=Chemical immunology and allergy|year=2010|volume=95|pages=1–11|pmid=20519878|url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/42/04708611/0470861142.pdf|doi=10.1159/000315934|series=Chemical Immunology and Allergy|isbn=978-3-8055-9441-7}}</ref> The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἀνά ana, ''against'', and φύλαξις phylaxis, ''protection''.<ref name=Dict>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anaphylaxis|title=anaphylaxis |accessdate=2009-11-21|publisher=merriam-webster.com }}</ref>

==Research==
There are ongoing efforts to develop [[sublingual]] epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis.<ref name=CEA11/> [[Subcutaneous injection]] of the anti-IgE antibody [[omalizumab]] is being studied as a method of preventing recurrence, but it is not yet recommended.<ref name=World11/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vichyanond|first=P|title=Omalizumab in allergic diseases, a recent review|journal=Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology / launched by the Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand|date=2011 Sep|volume=29|issue=3|pages=209–19|pmid=22053590}}</ref>
