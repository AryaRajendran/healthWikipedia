'''Wobbler disease''' is a condition of the [[cervical vertebrae]] that causes an unsteady (wobbly) gait and weakness in [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s. The term ''wobbler disease'' refers to a number of different conditions of the cervical (neck) spinal column that all cause similar symptoms. These conditions may include malformation of the vertebrae, [[intervertebral disc]] protrusion, and disease of the [[interspinal ligament]]s, [[ligamenta flava]], and [[articular facet]]s of the vertebrae.<ref name=NAVC>{{cite web | last = Bagley | first = Rodney S. | title = Acute Spinal Disease | work = Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference | date = 2006 | url = http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/247.pdf?LA=1 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-02-19 }}</ref> Wobbler disease is also known as cervical vertebral instability, cervical spondylomyelopathy (CSM), and cervical vertebral malformation (CVM). In dogs, the disease is most common in large breeds, especially [[Great Dane]]s and [[Doberman Pinscher|Dobermann]]s. In horses, it is not linked to a particular breed, though it is most often seen in tall race-bred horses. It is most likely inherited in dogs, it may be hereditary to some extent in horses.

The disease tends to be gradually progressive. Symptoms such as weakness, [[ataxia]], and dragging of the toes start in the rear legs. Dogs often have a crouching stance with a downward flexed neck. The disease progresses to the front legs, but the symptoms are less severe. Neck pain is sometimes seen. Symptoms are usually gradual in onset but may progress rapidly following trauma.<ref>{{cite web|author=Braund, K.G.|year=2003|title=Degenerative and Compressive Structural Disorders|work=Braund's Clinical Neurology in Small Animals: Localization, Diagnosis and Treatment|url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Vite/braund17/chapter_frm.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> [[X-ray]]s may show malaligned vertebrae and narrow disk spaces, but it is not as effective as a [[myelography|myelogram]], which reveals stenosis of the vertebral canal.

==A Recent Update in the Treatment of Wobbler's Disease in Canines==
{{POV-section|date=December 2012}}
A new surgical treatment is now available for dogs with Disc-Associated Wobbler's Syndrome. This surgical treatment involves implanting an artificial disc (cervical arthroplasty) in place of the affected disc space. This is a less invasive technique with minimal risks and post-operative care. All dogs treated have displayed excellent short and long terms clinical results.  Cervical arthroplasty can also be applied in multiple spaces and it is cost effective. For further reading on the new procedure, please see "Cervical Arthroplasty in Two Dogs with Disc Associated Cervical Spondylomyelopathy." JAVMA, Vol 239, No 6, September 15, 2011, http://www.scribd.com/doc/56257403/DrAdamoFullArticle.  

Please note that this procedure is considered investigational, and results of only a small handful of dogs have been published.  This procedure has not yet been shown to be equivalent or superior to more established repair techniques, and long-term safety has not been established.  It should also be noted that this procedure is the only one of its kind that requires use of a proprietary device.  This device is patented by the author of the published studies, who has a conflict of interest due to ownership of the device patent.  No unbiased review of the device or procedure has yet been performed by any other parties.

T2 weighted MRI in neutral (A) and linear traction (B) of a 7 year old Doberman with a 2 year history of cervical pain treated with NSAID and presented acutely tretraplegic. A C6-C7 and C5-C6 traction responsive myelopathy are evident on MRI. The spinal cord hyperintensity seen at the C5-C6 is suggestive of chronic lesion and most likely responsible for the chronic history of cervical pain, while the C5-C6 lesion was most likely responsible for the acute tetraplegia.

Same dog (A) treated with double implant (B) three days post-surgery. The dog became ambulatory 3 days after surgery. Four weeks post-surgery it had ataxia without conscious proprioceptive deficits, and 3 months post-surgery the dog was neurologically normal. Owner reported that it had been 2 years since the dog was not able to hold its neck in an elevated position.

==Wobbler disease in horses==
Wobbler disease is also found in [[horse]]s, where it is often called ''Wobbler's Syndrome,'' refers to several conditions beyond those listed above, including equine wobbles anemia. It is also used as a catchall phrase within the horse community to designate a neurological problem that has no more specific diagnosis. Some forms, such as cervical vertebral malformation (CVM), are not thought to be hereditary, but rather a [[congenital]] condition or a growth disorder. Other forms, such as Equine wobbles anemia, are concentrated in certain breeds and may be hereditary to some extent. Horses with wobbler disease often exhibit [[ataxia]] (implying dysfunction of parts of the nervous system), show weakness in the hindquarters, or may knuckle over in their [[fetlock]]s, particularly in the rear. With advanced stages of the disease they are prone to falling. While some cases are successfully treated with nutritional and medical management, surgery is also used. One method is the use of [[Titanium]] baskets, placed to fuse the vertebrae, thereby preventing compression of the spinal cord. Some horses are able to return to work, with a few able to reach competitive levels. There is currently no complete "cure" for the condition.

Because wobbler's is the best known of the neurological conditions that affect horses, other, unrelated conditions, such as [[Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis]] and [[cerebellar abiotrophy]] are sometimes misdiagnosed as wobbler's, even though the causes and symptoms differ.
