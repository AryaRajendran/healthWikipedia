'''Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis''' ('''SBP''') is the development of [[peritonitis]] ([[infection]] in the [[abdominal cavity]]) despite the absence of an obvious source for the infection.<ref name="pmid19938187">{{cite journal | author = Lata J, Stiburek O, Kopacova M | title = Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a severe complication of liver cirrhosis | journal = World J.

The diagnosis of SBP requires [[paracentesis]] (aspiration of fluid with a needle) from the abdominal cavity.<ref name="pmid10673079">{{cite journal | author = Rimola A, García-Tsao G, Navasa M, ''et al.'' | title = Diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a consensus document.

== Pathogenesis ==
SBP is thought to result from a combination of factors inherent in cirrhosis and ascites, such as prolonged [[bacteremia]] secondary to compromised host defenses, intrahepatic shunting of colonized [[blood]], and defective bactericidal activity within the ascitic fluid.<ref name="pmid6500513">{{cite journal | author = Runyon BA, Hoefs JC | title = Culture-negative neutrocytic ascites: a variant of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis | journal = Hepatology | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 1209–11 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6500513 | doi = 10.1002/hep.1840040619| url = | issn = }}</ref> Pharmacologic acid suppression has also been associated with SBP in patients with advanced cirrhosis.<ref name="pmid22155557">{{cite journal | author = Gati GA, Deshpande A | title = Increased rate of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis among cirrhotic patients receiving pharmacologic acid suppression | journal = Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume = 4 | pages = 422–27 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22155557 | url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid23190338">{{cite journal | author = Deshpande A, Pasupuleti V | title = Acid suppressive therapy is associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients: a meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology | doi: 10.1111/jgh.12065 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23190338 | url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid19337238">{{cite journal | author = Bajaj JS, Zadvornova Y | title = Association of Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy With Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis in Cirrhotic Patients With Ascites | journal = American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 104 | pages = 1130–34 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19337238 | url = | issn = }}</ref> Contrary to earlier theories, transmucosal migration of bacteria from the gut to the ascitic fluid is no longer considered to play a major role in the etiology of SBP.<ref name="pmid3371881">{{cite journal | author = Runyon BA | title = Patients with deficient ascitic fluid opsonic activity are predisposed to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis | journal = Hepatology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 632–5 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3371881 | doi = 10.1002/hep.1840080332| url = | issn = }}</ref>

With respect to compromised [[immune system|host defenses]], patients with severe acute or chronic liver disease are often deficient in [[Complement system|complement]] and may also have malfunctioning of the [[neutrophil]]ic and [[reticuloendothelial systems]].<ref name="pmid19561863">{{cite journal | author = Alaniz C, Regal RE | title = Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis: A Review of Treatment Options | journal = P T | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 204–210 | year = 2009 | month = April | pmid = 19561863 | pmc = 2697093 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref>

As for the significance of ascitic fluid proteins, it was demonstrated that cirrhotic patients with ascitic protein concentrations below 1 g/dL were 10 times more likely to develop SBP than individuals with higher concentrations.<ref name="pmid3770358">{{cite journal | author = Runyon BA | title = Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 91 | issue = 6 | pages = 1343–6 | year = 1986 | month = December | pmid = 3770358 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref>  It is thought that the antibacterial, or opsonic, activity of ascitic fluid is closely correlated with the protein concentration.<ref name="pmid4018735">{{cite journal | author = Runyon BA, Morrissey RL, Hoefs JC, Wyle FA | title = Opsonic activity of human ascitic fluid: a potentially important protective mechanism against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis | journal = Hepatology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 634–7 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4018735 | doi = 10.1002/hep.1840050419| url = | issn = }}</ref> Additional studies have confirmed the validity of the ascitic fluid protein concentration as the best predictor of the first episode of SBP.<ref name="pmid19561863"/>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis necessitates [[paracentesis]] (needle drainage of the ascitic fluid) and laboratory confirmation of ascitic [[neutrophil]]s > 250/mm³.<ref name="pmid19938187"/>

==Treatment==
===Antibiotics===
After confirmation of SBP, patients need hospital admission for intravenous antibiotics (most often [[cefotaxime]] 2g IV Q8-12H for at least 5 days or [[ceftriaxone]] 2g IV Q24H). They will often also receive intravenous albumin. A repeat paracentesis in 48 hours is sometimes performed to ensure control of infection. Once patients have recovered from SBP, they require regular prophylactic antibiotics as long as they still have [[ascites]].

===Intravenous albumin===
A [[randomized controlled trial]] found that intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on hospital day 3 can reduce  renal impairment.<ref name="pmid10432325">{{cite journal |author=Sort P, Navasa M, Arroyo V, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of intravenous albumin on renal impairment and mortality in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis |journal=N.

==Prevention/screening==
All cirrhotic patients might benefit from antibiotics if:
* Ascitic fluid protein <1.0 g/dL.<ref name="pmid3770358">{{cite journal |author=Runyon BA |title=Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=1343–6 |year=1986 |pmid=3770358 |doi=}}</ref> Patients with fluid protein <15 g/L and either Child-Pugh score of at least 9 or impaired renal function may also benefit.<ref name="pmid17854593">{{cite journal |author=Fernández J, Navasa M, Planas R, ''et al.'' |title=Primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis delays hepatorenal syndrome and improves survival in cirrhosis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=133 |issue=3 |pages=818–24 |year=2007 |pmid=17854593 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2007.06.065}}</ref>

Cirrhotic patients admitted to the hospital should receive antibiotics if:
* They have bleeding [[esophageal varices]]<ref name="pmid12076458">{{cite journal |author=Soares-Weiser K, Brezis M, Tur-Kaspa R, Leibovici L |editor1-last=Soares-Weiser |editor1-first=Karla |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD002907 |year=2002 |pmid=12076458 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002907}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Patients with ascites underwent routine paracentesis, the incidence of active SBP ranged from 10% to 27% at the time of hospital admission.<ref name="pmid3338704">{{cite journal | author = Runyon BA | title = Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: an explosion of information | journal = Hepatology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 171–5 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3338704 | doi = 10.1002/hep.1840080131| url = | issn = }}</ref>

==History==
SBP was first described in 1964 by Prof Harold O. Conn.<ref>{{cite journal |author=CONN HO |title=Spontaneous peritonitis and bacteremia in Laennec's cirrhosis caused by enteric organisms.
