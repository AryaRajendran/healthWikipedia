'''Nasal polyps''' are [[polyp (medicine)|polypoidal]] masses arising mainly from the [[mucous membrane]]s of the [[Human nose|nose]] and [[paranasal sinus]]es. They are overgrowths of the mucosa that frequently accompany [[allergic rhinitis]]. They are freely movable and nontender.

==Description==
Nasal polyps are usually classified into ''antrochoanal'' polyps and ''ethmoidal'' polyps. Antrochoanal polyps arise from the [[maxillary sinus]]es and are the much less common, ethmoidal polyps arise from the [[ethmoidal sinus]]es. Antrochoanal polyps are usually single and unilateral whereas ethmoidal polyps are multiple and [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]].

Symptoms of polyps include [[nasal congestion]], [[sinusitis]], [[anosmia]] (loss of smell), and secondary [[infection]] leading to [[headache]].<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1550.htm eMedicine - Nasal Polyps : Article by John E McClay, MD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They may be removed by surgery, but are found to recur in about 70% of cases. Sinus surgery requires great amount of precision as this involves risk of damage to [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] matter.

The tendency to manifest multiple polyps is referred to as “polyposis”.

==Types==
There are 2 major types of nasal polyps.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
  <li> Antrochoanal
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
      <li>Single, Unilateral</li>
      <li>Can originate from [[maxillary sinus]]</li>
      <li>Usually found in children</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>[[Ethmoidal]]
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
      <li>Bilateral</li>
      <li>Usually found in adults</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

==Causes==
The [[pathogenesis]] of nasal polyps is unknown. Nasal polyps are most commonly thought to be caused by allergy and rarely by [[cystic fibrosis]] although a significant number are associated with non-allergic adult [[asthma]] or no respiratory or allergic trigger that can be demonstrated. Nasal mucosa, particularly in the region of middle meatus becomes oedematous due to collection of extracellular fluid causing polypoidal change. Polyps which are sessile in the beginning become pedunculated due to gravity and excessive sneezing.

In early stages, surface of nasal polypi is covered by ciliated columnar epithelium, but later it undergoes [[metaplasia|metaplastic]] change to squamous type on atmospheric irritation. Submucosa shows large intercellular spaces filled with serous fluid. 

These polyps have no relationship with [[colonic polyp|colonic]] or [[uterine polyp]]s. Irregular unilateral polyps particularly associated with pain or bleeding will require urgent investigation as they may represent an [[intranasal tumour]].

There are various diseases associated with polyp formation:
# Chronic [[rhinosinusitis]]
# [[Asthma]]
# [[Aspirin intolerance]]/salicylate sensitivity
# [[Cystic fibrosis]]
# [[Kartagener's syndrome]]
# [[Young's syndrome]]
# [[Churg-Strauss syndrome]]
# Nasal [[mastocytosis]]

Exposure to some forms of [[chromium]] can cause nasal polyps and associated diseases.

==Treatments==
Nasal polyps are most often treated with [[steroid]]s or topical, but can also be treated with surgical methods.

Pre-post surgery, [[sinus rinses]] with a warm water (240 ml / 8 oz) mixed with a small amount (teaspoon) of [[salts]] ([[sodium chloride]] & [[sodium bicarbonate]]) can be very helpful to clear the [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]]. This method can be also used as a preventative measure to discourage the polyps from growing back and should be used in combination with a nasal steroid. 

The removal of nasal polyps via surgery lasts approximately 45&nbsp;minutes to 1&nbsp;hour.  The surgery can be done under general or local [[anaesthesia]], and the polyps are removed using [[endoscopic surgery]].  Recovery from this type of surgery is anywhere from 1 to 3&nbsp;weeks.  

[[Mometasone furoate]], commonly available as a nasal spray for treating common allergy symptoms, has been indicated in the [[United States]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for the treatment of nasal polyps since December 2005.
