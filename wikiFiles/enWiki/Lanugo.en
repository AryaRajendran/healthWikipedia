'''Lanugo''' (/la·nu·go/,<ref name=TheFreeDictionary>{{cite web|first=Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers|title=Lanugo : definition|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lanugo|publisher=TheFreeDictionary|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref> from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:lana#Latin|lana]]'' “wool”) is very fine, soft, and usually unpigmented, downy [[hair]] on the body of a [[fetus]] or [[Infant|newborn baby]]. It is the first hair to be produced by the fetal hair follicles, and it usually appears on the fetus at about 5 months of gestation. It is normally shed before birth, around 7 or 8 months of gestation but is often present at birth and disappears on its own within a few days or weeks.<ref name=MedicineNet>{{cite web|title=Definition of Lanugo|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6210|publisher=MedicineNet: medterms medical dictionary|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>

Lanugo hair will invariably be shed by three to four months after birth. It is replaced by hair covering the same surfaces called [[vellus hair]], but this hair is finer and more difficult to see. The more visible hair that continues into [[adult]]hood is called [[terminal hair]]. This forms in specific areas and is [[hormone]] dependant.<ref name=SheKnows>{{cite web|first=Pregnancy&Baby|title=What is lanugo?|url=http://www.pregnancyandbaby.com/baby/articles/942829/what-is-lanugo|publisher=SheKnows|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>

==Occurrence==

===In humans===

====Fetal development====
During human development, the lanugo grows on [[fetus]]es as a normal part of [[gestation]], but is usually shed and replaced by [[vellus hair]] at about 33 to 36 weeks of [[gestational age]].  As the lanugo is shed from the skin, it is normal for the developing fetus to consume the hair with the fluid, since it drinks from the [[amniotic fluid]] and urinates it back into its environment. Subsequently, the lanugo contributes to the newborn baby's [[meconium]]. The presence of lanugo in newborns is a sign of [[premature birth]].

A hypothesis, according to the NHS, is that the lanugo of human fetuses has to do with temperature regulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=You and your baby at 21-24 weeks|url=http://www.nhs.uk/planners/pregnancycareplanner/pages/24weeks.aspx|work=NHS choices|publisher=NHS|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>

====Malnutrition====
Lanugo can be observed in malnourished patients, including those with eating disorders.  When found along with other physical symptoms, for example, lanugo can help a physician make a diagnosis of [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/2008/0115/p187.html "Treating Eating Disorders in Primary Care"], P.M. Williams, et al, American Family Physician, Vol 77 (2): January 15, 2008</ref>

====Teratoma====
It is often found in [[teratoma]]s (congenital tumours).

===In non-human animals===
Lanugo is also common on other animals. For example, seals<ref name="Monachus Science Posters">{{cite journal|last=Androukaki|first=E.|coauthors=Fatsea, E., 't Hart, L., Osterhaus, A.D.M.E., Tounta, E. and Kotomatas, S.|title=Growth and Development of Mediterranean Monk Seal Pups during Rehabilitation|journal=Monachus Science Posters|year=2002|month=May|volume=5|issue=1|pages=This poster was presented at the 16th ECS (European Cetacean Society) Conference, "Marine Mammal Health: from Individuals to Populations", 7–11 April 2002, Liege, Belgium|url=http://www.monachus-guardian.org/mguard09/09scien3.htm|accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> and elephants<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0266-4674(199305)9%3A2%3C169%3AEOTAEI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z ''Ecology of the Asian Elephant in Lowland Dry Zone Habitats of the Mahaweli River Basin, Sri Lanka'']

Fetal whales, like humans and all other primates, also have lanugo.
