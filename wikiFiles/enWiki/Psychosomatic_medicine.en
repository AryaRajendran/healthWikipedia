'''Psychosomatic medicine''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] medical field studying the relationships of social, psychological, and behavioral factors on bodily processes and [[quality of life]] in humans and animals. 

The academic forebear of the modern field of [[behavioral medicine]] and a part of the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine integrates interdisciplinary evaluation and management involving diverse specialties including [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[neurology]], [[surgery]], [[allergy]], [[dermatology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]]. Clinical situations where mental processes act as a major factor affecting medical outcomes are areas where psychosomatic medicine has competence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Levenson| first = James L. | title = Essentials of Psychosomatic Medicine| publisher = American Psychiatric Press Inc|year=2006| isbn = 978-1-58562-246-7}}</ref>

==History of psychosomatics==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] the Persian [[Islamic psychology|Muslim psychologist]]-[[Islamic medicine|physicians]] [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi]] (d. 934) and [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi|Haly Abbas]] (d. 994) developed an early understanding of illness that was due to the interaction of the mind and the body. They realized how a patient's [[physiology]] and [[psychology]] can have an effect on one another. They found correlations between patients who were physically and [[Mental health|mentally healthy]] and between those who were physically and [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]].<ref>Nurdeen Deuraseh and Mansor Abu Talib (2005), "Mental health in Islamic medical tradition", ''The International Medical Journal'' '''4''' (2), p. 76-79.</ref>

[[Franz Alexander]] led in the beginnings of the 20th century, the movement looking for the dynamic interrelation between mind and body.<ref name= "psydis">{{cite book | last = Asaad| first = Ghazi | title = Psychosomatic Disorders: Theoretical and Clinical Aspects| publisher = Brunner-Mazel|year=1996| pages = X, 129–130 | isbn = 978-0-87630-803-5}}</ref> [[Sigmund Freud]] pursued a deep interest in psychosomatic illnesses following his correspondence with [[Georg Groddeck]] who was, at the time, researching the possibility of treating physical disorders through psychological processes.<ref>{{cite book | last =  Erwin| first = Edward | title = The Freud Encyclopedia: Theory, Therapy and Culture| publisher =  Routledge|year=2002| pages = 245–246 | isbn = 978-0-415-93677-4}}</ref>

Since the 1970s, due to the work of [[Thure von Uexküll]] and his colleagues in [[Germany]] and elsewhere, [[biosemiotics|biosemiotic]] theory has been used as a theoretical basis for psychosomatic medicine. Particularly, the [[umwelt]] concept and the theory of organism by [[Jakob von Uexküll]] has been found useful as an approach to describe [[psychosomatic]] [[phenomena]].

==Psychosomatic disorders==
{{Main|Psychoneuroimmunology}}
Some physical diseases are believed to have a mental component derived from the stresses and strains of everyday living. This is the case, for example, of [[lower back pain]] and [[high blood pressure]], which appear to be partly related to [[Stress (biology)|stress]]es in everyday life.<ref>{{cite book | last =  Sarno| first = John| title = The Divided Mind| publisher =  ReganBooks|year=2006 | isbn = 0-06-085178-3}}</ref> Psychiatry has found it difficult until relatively recently to distinguish somatoform disorders, disorders in which mental factors are the sole cause of a physical illness, from psychosomatic disorders, disorders in which mental factors play a significant role in the development, expression, or resolution of a physical illness.

For instance, while [[peptic ulcer]] was once thought of as being purely caused by stress, later research revealed that ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' caused 80% of ulcers. However 4 out of 5 people colonised with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' do not develop ulcers, and an expert panel convened by the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research concluded that ulcers are not merely an infectious disease and that mental factors do play a significant role. One likelihood is that stress diverts energy away from the immune system, thereby stress promotes ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection in the body.<ref name="medmag">{{cite web | url= http://www.emedmag.com/html/pre/gic/consults/071503.asp| title=GI Consult: Perforated Peptic Ulcer|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> 

It is still difficult to classify some disorders as purely physical, mixed psychosomatic, or purely somatoform. One example is [[Irritable Bowel Syndrome]] (IBS) that was considered formerly as having purely mental causes, while subsequent research showed significant differences in the behaviour of the gut in IBS patients. On the other hand, there are no actual structural changes in IBS patients and research shows that stress and emotions are still significant factors in causing IBS.<ref>{{cite book | last =Melmed| first =  Raphael N. | title = Mind, Body and Medicine: An Integrative Text| publisher = Oxford University Press Inc, USA| year = 2001| pages = 191–192 | isbn = 978-0-19-513164-2}}</ref>

However, while it is necessary to identify if an illness has a physical basis, it is recognized more and more that the effort to identify disorders as purely physical or mixed psychosomatic is increasingly obsolete as almost all physical illness have mental factors that determine their onset, presentation, maintenance, susceptibility to treatment, and resolution.<ref>[http://www.mendeley.com/research/borderline-mental-disorders-chronic-diseases-digestive-system-children-adolescents/ Skumin V A Borderline mental disorders in chronic diseases of the digestive system in children and adolescents.

Korsakova}}</ref>

Addressing such factors is the remit of the applied field of [[behavioral medicine]]. In modern society, psychosomatic aspects of illness are often attributed to [[stress (medicine)|stress]]<ref>{{cite book | last = I. H. Treasaden| first = Basant K. Puri, P. J. Laking| title = Textbook of Psychiatry| publisher = Churchill Livingstone| year = 2002| pages = 7| isbn = 978-0-443-07016-7}}</ref> making the remediation of stress one important factor in the development, treatment, and prevention of psychosomatic illness.

==Connotations of the term "psychosomatic illness"==
Psychosomatic medicine is not to be confused with the demotic and scientifically incorrect use of the phrase "psychosomatic illness," particularly the influence the mind has over physical processes — including the manifestations of [[disability|disabilities]] that are based on intellectual infirmities, rather than actual injuries or physical limitations. These are exemplified by phrases such as the '''power of suggestion''', the use of "[[positive thinking]]" and concepts like "[[mind over matter]]" to apply to illnesses that are now called [[somatoform disorder]]s. Such illness is classified as [[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders#.28F40-F48.29 Neurotic.2C stress-related and somatoform disorders|neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders]] by the [[World Health Organization]] in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]. The field of psychosomatic medicine fell into disrepute clinically due to this incorrect use of this term, which was largely due to the influence of psychoanalytic theory on psychiatric physicians and the inaccurate application by non-specialists in the first part of the 20th century who considered this form of illness to be akin to [[malingering]], thereby further harming the sufferer.<ref name= "greco">{{cite book | last = Greco| first = Monica| title = Illness as a Work of Thought: Foucauldian Perspective on Psychosomatics| publisher = Routledge| year = 1998| pages = 1–3, 112–116| isbn = 978-0-415-17849-5}}</ref> For this reason, among others, the field of [[Behavioral Medicine]] has taken over much of the remit of Psychosomatic Medicine in practice and there exist large areas of overlap in the scientific research.

==Treatment==
Psychosomatic medicine is considered a subspecialty of the fields of psychiatry and neurology.  Medical treatments and [[psychotherapy]] are used to treat psychosomatic disorders.<ref>{{cite journal
