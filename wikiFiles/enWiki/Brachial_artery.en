The '''brachial artery''' is the major [[blood vessel]] of the (upper) arm.

It is the continuation of the [[axillary artery]] beyond the lower margin of [[teres major muscle]]. It continues down the [[ventral]] surface of the arm until it reaches the [[cubital fossa]] at the [[Elbow-joint|elbow]]. It then divides into the [[radial artery|radial]] and [[ulnar artery|ulnar]] [[artery|arteries]] which run down the [[forearm]]. In some individuals, the bifurcation occurs much earlier and the ulnar and radial arteries extend through the upper arm.
The [[pulse]] of the brachial artery is [[palpation|palpable]] on the anterior aspect of the elbow, medial to the [[tendon]] of the [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps]], and, with the use of a [[stethoscope]] and [[sphygmomanometer]] (blood pressure cuff) often used to measure the [[blood pressure]].

The brachial artery is closely related to the [[median nerve]]; in proximal regions, the median nerve is immediately lateral to the brachial artery. Distally, the median nerve crosses the medial side of the brachial artery and lies anterior to the elbow joint.

==Branches==
* [[Profunda brachii artery]] (deep brachial artery)
* [[Superior ulnar collateral artery]]
* [[Inferior ulnar collateral artery]]
* [[Radial artery]] (a terminal branch)
* [[Ulnar artery]] (a terminal branch)
* Nutrient branches to the [[humerus]]

as well as important anastomotic networks of the elbow and (as the axillary artery) the shoulder.

The biceps head is lateral to the brachial artery. The median nerve is medial to the brachial artery for most of its course.
