'''Urethritis''' is inflammation of the [[urethra]].  The most common symptom is [[dysuria|painful or difficult urination]].<ref name="pubmed">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001475/ |title=Urethritis |author=PubMed Health |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="cdc">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/urethritis-and-cervicitis.htm/ |title=Disease characterized by urethritis and cervicitis |author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref>

==Causes==
The disease is classified as either [[Gonorrhea|gonococcal urethritis]], caused by ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'', or [[non-gonococcal urethritis]] (NGU), most commonly caused by ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]''. NGU, sometimes called non-specific urethritis (NSU), has both infectious and non-infectious causes.

Other causes include:<ref name="pubmed"/><ref name="cdc"/>
* [[Adenoviridae]]
* Uropathogenic ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (UPEC)
* [[Herpes simplex]]
* [[Cytomegalovirus]]
* ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]''
* [[Reactive arthritis|Reiter's syndrome]]
* ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' 
* ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum]]''

==Symptoms==
In men, [[pus|purulent]] discharge usually indicates a urethritis of gonococcal nature, while clear discharge indicates urethritis of non-gonococcal nature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Urethritis is difficult to diagnose in women because discharge may not be present, however, the symptoms of [[dysuria]] and frequency may be present.

==Diagnosis==
With male patients, the physician examines the [[penis]] and [[testicles]] for soreness or any swelling. The urethra is visually examined by spreading the urinary meatus apart with two gloved fingers, and examining the opening for redness, discharge and other abnormalities. Next, a cotton swab is inserted 1&ndash;4&nbsp;cm into the urethra and rotated once. To prevent contamination, no lubricant is applied to the swab, which can result in pain or discomfort. The swab is then smeared onto a glass slide and examined under a microscope. A commonly used cut-off for the diagnosis of urethritis is 5 or more [[granulocyte]]s per [[High Power Field]], but this definition has recently been called into doubt.<ref name="Bradshaw2006">{{cite journal|author=Bradshaw CS, Tabrizi SN, Read TR, ''et al''|title=Etiologies of nongonococcal urethritis: bacteria, viruses, and the association with orogenital exposure|journal=J Infect Dis|volume=193|issue=3|pages=336â€“45|year=2006|pmid=16388480|doi=10.1086/499434|url=}}</ref> The physician sometimes performs a digital [[rectal examination]] to inspect the [[prostate gland]] for swelling or infection.

==Treatment==
A variety of drugs may be prescribed based on the cause of the patient's urethritis. Some examples of medications based on causes include:<ref name="cdc"/> [[azithromycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[erythromycin]], [[levofloxacin]], [[metronidazole]], [[ofloxacin]], or [[tinidazole]].

Proper [[Perineum|perineal]] hygiene should be stressed. This includes avoiding use of vaginal deodorant sprays and proper wiping after urination and bowel movements. Intercourse should be avoided until symptoms subside.

==Prevention==
Risk of some causes of urethritis can be lessened by avoiding unprotected sexual activity, chemicals that could irritate the urethra; this could include detergents or lotions as well as [[spermicides]] or [[contraceptives]], and irritation caused by manual manipulation of the urethra.
