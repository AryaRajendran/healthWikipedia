== Nomenclature, classification, and codification ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
According to a study by Dr. Christina A. Gurnett, of the [[Washington University School of Medicine]]'s Department of Neurology, sleepwalking may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with reduced penetrance. Genome-wide multipoint parametric linkage analysis for sleepwalking revealed a maximum [[Genetic linkage#LOD score method for estimating recombination frequency|logarithm of the odds score]] of 3.44 at chromosome 20q12-q13.12 between 55.6 and 61.4 cM.<ref>"Neurology" Journal, January 4, 2011 76:12-13 published by the American Academy of Neurology www.Neurology.org</ref>

==Explanation==
===Sleep stages===
Sleep is categorized into stages of a cycle between [[REM sleep]] and [[NREM sleep]]. NREM sleep is further divided into [[Sleep#Stages of sleep|four stages]]: stage 1 (a light sleep period), stage 2 (a consolidated sleep period), and stage 3 and 4 ([[Slow-wave sleep|slow wave]] sleep periods). This is followed by stage 3, stage 2, stage 1, and a REM period. In normal adults, a cycle will last about 1.5 hours.<ref name="Mendelson, Gillin, and Wyatt">Mendelson, Wallace, Christian Gillin, and Richard Wyatt. "The Sleep Stages." ''Human Sleep and its Disorders''. New York: Plenum, 1977. 3–10.</ref> According to Lavie, Malhotra, and Pillar, "The length and content of sleep cycles change throughout the night as well as with age." Sleepwalking generally occurs during the first third of the night (between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.)<ref name="Lavie, Malhotra, and Pillar" /> during the slow wave NREM sleep stage. High [[Delta wave|delta activity]] within the brain usually accompanies slow wave NREM sleep, and when 20–50% of all activity is delta activity, stage 3 is scored. When delta activity reaches 50% or higher, stage 4 is scored.<ref name="Mendelson, Gillin, and Wyatt" /> Usually, if sleepwalking occurs at all, it will only occur once in a night.<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" />

===Automatism===
Researchers sometimes  disagree about the classification of sleepwalking as an [[Automatic behavior|automatism]].  These repetitive actions may include chewing, lip-smacking, pulling at clothing, or wandering around looking confused. [[Absence seizure|Epileptic automatisms]] are also associated "with the absence attacks of petit mal epilepsy."<ref name="Dreifuss, and Penry">Dreifuss, Fritz, and J. Penry. "Automatisms Associated With the Absence of Petit Mal Epilepsy." ''Archives of Neurology'' 21.2 (1969):142–149.</ref>

Some actions that take place during sleepwalking could be classified as "automatisms". The distinction between "non-insane automatism" and "insane automatism" may be important in the legal context (see '''Crime''' below).

===Causes===
Several experts theorize that the development of sleepwalking in childhood is due to a delay in maturation. There are also high-voltage [[delta wave]]s in somnambulists up to 17 years of age. This presence might suggest an immaturity in the central nervous system, also a possible cause of sleepwalking.<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" /> Sleepwalking is clustered in families, and the percentage of childhood sleepwalking increases to 45% if one parent was affected, and 60% if both parents were affected. However, there is no recorded preference to male or female individuals.<ref name="Lavie, Malhotra, and Pillar" /> Thus, heritable factors appear to predispose an individual to  develop sleepwalking, but expression of the trait may be also influenced by environmental factors.<ref>[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/137/2/111  Kales, A. and others. 1980. Hereditary factors in sleepwalking and night terrors. The British Journal of Psychiatry 137: 111-118.]</ref>  Other precipitating factors to sleepwalking are those factors which increase the slow wave sleep stage.<ref name="Pressman">Pressman. "Factors that predispose, prime and precipitate NREM parasomnias in adults: clinical and forensic implications." ''Sleep Med Rev'' 11.1 (2007):5–30.</ref> These most commonly include sleep deprivation, fever, and excessive tiredness. The use of some [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptics]] or [[hypnotics]] can also cause sleepwalking to occur.<ref name="Culebras">Culebras, Antonio. "Somnambulism." ''Clinical Handbook of Sleep Disorders'', Massachusetts: Butterworth-Heinemann, 1996. 317–319.</ref>

==Treatment==
There are some drugs that can be prescribed for sleepwalkers, such as a low dose of [[benzodiazepines]], such as [[clonazepam]], and [[tricyclic antidepressants]].<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" /> However, for most sleepwalkers, many experts advise putting away dangerous items and locking doors and windows before sleep to reduce risks of harmful activity. Good [[sleep hygiene]] and avoiding sleep deprivation is also recommended.<ref name="Lavie, Malhotra, and Pillar" />

There are conflicting viewpoints on whether it is harmful to wake a sleepwalker. Some experts say that sleepwalkers should be gently guided back to bed without waking them. Others counter that idea and state that waking a sleepwalker may result in their disorientation, but it is not harmful.<ref name="Hirsch" />

==Epidemiology==
According to the [[National Sleep Foundation]] in the U.S., sleepwalking is prevalent in 1–15% of the general populace.<ref name="National Sleep Foundation">Mahowald, Mark. [http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/sleep-related-problems/sleepwalking "Sleepwalking"]. National Sleep Foundation.</ref> Sleepwalking is most prevalent in children, and usually disappears by adolescence. Sleepwalking in adults is less common, but when it does occur, the events occur three times more often per year and last for more years than in children. Sleepwalking in old age is rare and usually indicates another disorder. Old age disorders may include delirium, drug toxicity or a seizure disorder.<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" />

===Children===
Sleepwalking events are common in childhood and decrease with age. According to Lavie, Malhotra and Pillar, the peak age is 4–8 years, when prevalence is 20% frequency of events.<ref name="Lavie, Malhotra, and Pillar" />. Another report states that the peak age is eleven or twelve, with an estimated 25% of children having experienced at least one episode. <ref>Schacter, D., Gilbert, D., Wegner, D. (2011). ''Psychology (2nd ed.)''. Section 5.7. New York, NY, USA: Worth Publishers</ref> It is also known that "between 25–33% of somnambulists have [[nocturnal enuresis]]" (bed-wetting). Like sleepwalking, enuresis is more common in children and fades away as the child ages. Some children who sleepwalk are also affected by night terrors. However, night terrors are much more common in adult sleepwalkers, up to 50% more common.<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" /> Some parents worry about the psychological implications of sleepwalking on their child, but Larissa Hirsch, MD, editor of the website KidsHealth, says, "Sleepwalking is not usually a sign that something is emotionally or psychologically wrong with a child. And it doesn't cause any emotional harm."<ref name="Hirsch">Hirsch, Larissa. [http://kidshealth.org/parent/misc/reviewers.html "Sleepwalking"]. KidsHealth, May 2009.</ref>

In the study "sleepwalking and sleep terrors in prepubera children" they found that if a child had another sleep disorder such as [[restless leg syndrome]] (RLS) or sleep-disorder breathing (SDB) that they had a greater chance of sleepwalking. The study found children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, the disappearance of the parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive [[polysomnographies]], discrete patterns (e.g., nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high  or slow  EEG frequencies) should be sought; apneas are rarely found in children. Children's respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula/pressure transducer system and/or esophageal manometry, which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement.<ref>[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/111/1/e17 Aappublications.org]</ref>

===Adults===
The persistence or onset of sleepwalking in adulthood is less common than in children. A 2012 study conducted by the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] showed that the prevalence of sleepwalking adults in the [[United States]] was higher than once thought, with 3.7% of participants reporting two or more episodes per month.<ref>http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2012/may/sleepwalk.html</ref> It is a misconception that adult sleepwalking always indicates a psychological disorder. Sleepwalking can, however, be a symptom of people with psychological disorders. In one study, adult test subjects were given the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]], a psychiatric test. According to the study, patients showed "outwardly directed behavior patterns...suggest[ing] that these adults had difficulty handling aggression. They did not support an interpretation of sleepwalking as '[[Dissociative identity disorder|hysterical dissociation]]'."<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" />

====Psychological disorders and drug use====
In some cases, sleepwalking in adults may be a symptom of a psychological disorder or of drug use. One study, A.H.Crisp and colleagues, of [[St. George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, suggests higher levels of dissociation in adult sleepwalkers, since test subjects scored unusually high on the hysteria portion of the "Crown-Crisp Experiential Index".<ref name="A.H.

(1967), "The Incidence of Sleepwalking in Various Groups", Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, Vol 43, Iss 3, pp 279–28.</ref> Also, patients with [[migraine]] headaches or [[Tourette Syndrome]] are 4–6 times more likely to sleepwalk. Some medications that may increase sleepwalking include: [[chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine), [[perphenazine]] (Trilafon), [[lithium]], [[benzodiazepine]] (Triazolam), [[amitriptyline]] (Elavel, Endep), zolpidem (Ambien) and [[beta blockers]].<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" />

==History==

Sleepwalking has attracted a sense of mystery, but it had not been seriously investigated and diagnosed until the last century. The 19th-century German chemist and parapsychologist [[Baron Karl Ludwig von Reichenbach]] made extensive studies of sleepwalkers and used his discoveries to formulate his theory of the [[Odic force]].

Sleepwalking was initially thought to be a dreamer acting out a dream.<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" /> For example, in one study published by the Society for Science & the Public in 1954, this was the conclusion: "Repression of hostile feelings against the father caused the patients to react by acting out in a dream world with sleepwalking, the distorted fantasies they had about all authoritarian figures, such as fathers, officers and stern superiors."<ref name="The Science News-Letter">Society for Science & the Public. "Sleepwalking Cause." ''The Science News-Letter''. 27 February 1954: 132.</ref> This same group published an article twelve years later with a new conclusion: "Sleepwalking, contrary to most belief, apparently has little to do with dreaming. In fact, it occurs when the sleeper is enjoying his most oblivious, deepest sleep—a stage in which dreams are not usually reported."<ref name="The Science News-Letter 2">Society for Science & the Public. "Sleepwalker Not Dreaming." ''The Science News-Letter'', 25 June 1966: 508</ref> More recent research has discovered that sleepwalking is actually a disorder of [[NREM]] (non-rapid eye movement) arousal.<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" /> Acting out a dream is the basis for a [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] (rapid eye movement) sleep disorder called [[REM Behavior Disorder]] (or REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, RSBD).<ref name="Sleep Disorders Sourcebook" /> More accurate data about sleep is due to the invention of technologies such as the electroencephalogram ([[EEG]]) by Hans Berger in 1924 and [[Neuroimaging|BEAM]] by Frank Duffy in the early 1980s.<ref name="Electroencephalogram">[http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Com-En/Electroencephalogram-EEG.html "Electroencephalography"], ''Medical Discoveries'', 2009.</ref>

In 1907, [[Sigmund Freud]] spoke about sleepwalking to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (Nunberg and Federn). He believed that sleepwalking was connected to fulfilling sexual wishes and was surprised that a person could move without interrupting their dream. At that time, Freud suggested that the essence of this phenomenon was the desire to go to sleep in the same area as the individual had slept in childhood. Ten years later, he speculated about somnambulism in the article "A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams" (1916-17 [1915]). In this essay, he stated to clarify and expand his hypothetical ideas on dreams. The dreams is a fragile equilibrium that is only partially successful because the repressed unconscious impulses of the unconscious system. This does not obey the wishes of the ego and maintain their countercathexis. Another reason why dreams are partially successful is because certain preconscious daytime thoughts can be resistant and these can retain a part of their cathexis as well. It is probable how unconscious impulses and day residues can come together and result in a conflict. Freud then wondered about the outcome of this wishful impulse which represents an unconscious instinctual demand and then it becomes a dream wish in the preconscious. Furthermore, Freud stated that this unconscious impulse could be expressed as mobility during sleep. This would be what is observed in somnambulism, though what actually makes it possible remains unknown.<ref name= "Somnambulism" >[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/somnambulism], "Somnambulism". 'International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis', 2005.</ref>

== Society and culture ==

Sleepwalking has been a theme, or at least a plot device, in many dramatic works.

=== Literature, music, and theatre===


[[John Polidori|Dr. John William Polidori]], a friend of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron's]], earned his medical degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1815 with a treatise on sleepwalking. He was present at the famous gathering at the [[Villa Diodati]] on 16 June 1816 when Byron issued a challenge to him, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Mary Shelley|Mary Godwin]] and [[Claire Clairmont]] to write a ghost story.

===Crime===
{{main|Homicidal sleepwalking}}
Because sleepwalking can result in violent behavior, legal courts sometimes deal with cases involving sleepwalkers. These cases include homicide, assault, and sexual harassment. The level of responsibility and severity of punishment has been highly debated because sleepwalkers are almost always oblivious to their activity during an episode. According to Culebras, a Professor of [[Neurology]] at the [[State University of New York]] College of Medicine, "It is conceivable that the sleepwalker has the potential to drift into a confusional arousal, a state in which violence and assault are likely when prolonged and if given the adequate circumstances.
The differential diagnosis may also include other conditions in which violence related to sleep is a risk, such as [[REM Sleep Behavior Disorder]] (RSBD), [[fugue state]]s, and episodic wandering."<ref name="Culebras">Culebras, Antonio.

In the case of the law, an individual can be accused of [[Automatism (case law)|non-insane automatism]] or [[Automatism (case law)|insane automatism]]. The first is used as a defense for temporary insanity or involuntary conduct, resulting in acquittal. The latter results in a "special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity."<ref name="Canadian Legal Information Institute">[[Canadian Legal Information Institute]].
