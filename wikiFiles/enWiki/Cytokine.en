'''Cytokines''' (Greek ''cyto-'', cell; and ''-kinos'', movement) are small [[signaling molecule]]s used for [[cell signaling]]. Cytokines can be classified as [[protein]]s, [[peptide]]s, or [[glycoprotein]]s; the term "cytokine" encompasses a large and diverse family of regulators produced throughout the body by cells of diverse embryological origin.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gilman A, Goodman LS, Hardman JG, Limbird LE |title=Goodman & Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics, Cytokines are diverse group of intercellular signalling low molecular weight proteins that provide a network controlling local and systemic immune and inflammatory responses but also wound  healing, hematopoiesis and other biologic process.

The term "cytokine" has been used to refer to the [[immunomodulator|immunomodulating]] agents, such as [[interleukin]]s and [[interferon]]s. [[Biochemists]] disagree as to which molecules should be termed cytokines and which [[hormones]].  As we learn more about each, anatomic and structural distinctions between the two are fading. Classic protein hormones circulate in nanomolar (10{{sup|-9}}M) concentrations that usually vary by less than one order of magnitude. In contrast, some cytokines (such as IL-6) circulate in picomolar (10{{sup|-12}}M) concentrations that can increase up to 1,000-fold during trauma or infection. The widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones. Virtually all nucleated cells, but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident [[macrophage]]s (many near the interface with the external environment) are potent producers of [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[Interleukin-6|IL-6]], and [[TNF-α]].<ref>Boyle, J. J. (2005). Macrophage activation in atherosclerosis: pathogenesis and pharmacology of plaque rupture. Curr Vasc Pharmacol, 3(1), 63-68. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15638783 PMID=15638783]</ref> In contrast, classic hormones, such as insulin, are secreted from discrete glands (e.g., the [[pancrea]]s).<ref name="Cannon2000">{{cite journal |author=Cannon JG |title=Inflammatory Cytokines in Nonpathological States |journal=News Physiol Sci. |year=2000 |volume=15 |pages=298–303 |pmid=11390930}}</ref> As of 2008, the current terminology refers to cytokines as immunomodulating agents. However, more research is needed in this area of defining cytokines and hormones.

Part of the difficulty with distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some of the immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local.  For instance, to use hormone terminology, the action of cytokines may be [[autocrine]] or [[paracrine]] in [[chemotaxis]] and [[endocrine]] as a [[fever#Pyrogens|pyrogen]].  Further, as molecules, cytokines are not limited to their  immunomodulatory role.  For instance, cytokines are also involved in several developmental processes during [[embryogenesis]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cytokine cross-talk between mother and the embryo/placenta|journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology|date=October–November 2001|first=Shigeru|last=Saito|coauthors=|volume=52|issue=1–2|pages=15–33|doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(01)00112-7|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T8W-445B4KX-3&_user=10&_coverDate=11%2F30%2F2001&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1271989808&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=cdad0fbe5c489efea109a3025c282e44|format=|accessdate=2010-03-29|pmid=11600175 }}</ref><ref group="nb">Saito explains "much evidence has suggested that cytokines and chemokines play a very important role in the reproduction, i.e. embryo implantation, endometrial development, and trophoblast growth and differentiation by modulating the immune and endocrine systems."(15)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Expression of leukemia inhibitory factor  and its receptor in preimplantation embryos|journal=Journal of Reproductive Biology|date=October 1999|first=Hsin-Fu|last=Chen M.D.|coauthors=Jin-Yuh Shew, Hong-Nerng Ho, Wei-Li Hsu, Yu-Shih Yang|volume=72|issue=4|pages=713–719|doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(99)00306-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028299003064|format=|accessdate=2010-03-29 }}</ref><ref group="nb">Chen explains the regulatory activity of [[Leukemia inhibitory factor|LIF]] in human and murine embryos: "In conclusion, human preimplantation embryos express LIF and LIF-R mRNA.

== Discovery of cytokines ==

[[Barry Bloom]] and [[John David]] independently discovered and characterized the activity of a soluble molecule released from [[lymphocytes]] that inhibited the random migration of [[macrophages]] (currently known as [[Macrophage migration inhibitory factor]]). They loaded macrophages from an unimmunized animal into a capillary tube, and then placed medium from either unstimulated lymphocytes or stimulated lymphocytes. They found that the medium from the stimulated lymphocytes prevented the random migration of macrophages out of the tube. This showed that there was a way for cell-cell communication that did not require cell-cell contact.

== Effects ==
Each cytokine has a matching [[Receptor (biochemistry)|cell-surface receptor]]. Subsequent [[biochemical cascade|cascades]] of intracellular signalling then alter cell functions. This may include the upregulation and/or downregulation of several [[genes]] and their [[transcription factors]], resulting in the production of other cytokines, an increase in  the number of surface receptors for other molecules, or the suppression of their own effect by [[enzyme inhibitor|feedback inhibition]].

The effect of a particular cytokine on a given cell depends on the cytokine, its extracellular abundance, the presence and abundance of the complementary receptor on the cell surface, and downstream signals activated by receptor binding; these last two factors can vary by cell type.  Cytokines are characterized by considerable "redundancy", in that many cytokines appear to share similar functions.

It seems to be a paradox that cytokines binding to [[antibody|antibodies]] have a stronger immune effect than the cytokine alone. This may lead to lower therapeutic doses.

Adverse reactions to cytokines are characterized by local inflammation and/or ulceration at the injection sites. Occasionally such reactions are seen with more widespread [[papule|papular]] eruptions.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).

== Nomenclature ==

Cytokines have been classed as [[lymphokines]], [[interleukins]], and [[chemokines]], based on their presumed function, cell of secretion, or target of action. Because cytokines are characterised by considerable redundancy and [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropism]], such distinctions, allowing for exceptions, are obsolete.

* The term ''interleukin'' was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally [[White blood cell|leukocytes]].  It is now used largely for designation of newer cytokine molecules discovered every day and bears little relation to their presumed function. The vast majority of these are produced by [[T-helper cell]]s.
* The term ''chemokine'' refers to a specific class of cytokines that mediates chemoattraction ([[chemotaxis]]) between cells.

== Classification ==

=== Structural ===

Structural homology has been able to partially distinguish between cytokines that do not demonstrate a considerable degree of redundancy so that they can be classified into four types:

*The four-[[Helix bundle|α-helix bundle]] family - Member cytokines have three-dimensional structures with four bundles of [[alpha helix|α-helices]]. This family, in turn, is divided into three sub-families:
*# the [[interleukin 2|IL-2]] subfamily
*# the [[interferon|interferon (IFN)]] subfamily
*# the [[interleukin 10|IL-10]] subfamily.
**The first of these three, the IL-2 subfamily, is the largest. It contains several non-immunological cytokines including [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) and [[thrombopoietin]] (TPO). Furthermore, four-α-helix bundle cytokines can be grouped into ''long-chain'' and ''short-chain'' cytokines.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}<!--citation needed for whole sub-bullet-->
*the [[interleukin 1|IL-1]] family, which primarily includes IL-1 and [[interleukin|IL-18]]
*the [[interleukin 17|IL-17]] family, which has yet to be completely characterized, though member cytokines have a specific effect in promoting proliferation of T-cells that cause cytotoxic effects.

=== Functional ===
A classification that proves more useful in clinical and experimental practice divides immunological cytokines into those that enhance [[cellular immune response]]s, type 1 (IFN-γ, TGF-β, etc.), and type 2 ([[interleukin 4|IL-4]], [[interleukin 10|IL-10]], [[interleukin 13|IL-13]], etc.), which favor [[antibody response]]s.

A key focus of interest has been that cytokines in one of these two sub-sets tend to inhibit the effects of those in the other. Dysregulation of this tendency is under intensive study for its possible role in the [[pathogenesis]] of [[autoimmune disorder]]s.

Several inflammatory cytokines are induced by [[Oxidative stress|oxidant stress]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10477716 | year = 1999 | last1 = Vlahopoulos | first1 = S | last2 = Boldogh | first2 = I | last3 = Casola | first3 = A | last4 = Brasier | first4 = AR | title = Nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent induction of interleukin-8 gene expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha: evidence for an antioxidant sensitive activating pathway distinct from nuclear translocation | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 1878–89 | journal = Blood }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17461946 | year = 2007 | last1 = David | first1 = F | last2 = Farley | first2 = J | last3 = Huang | first3 = H | last4 = Lavoie | first4 = JP | last5 = Laverty | first5 = S | title = Cytokine and chemokine gene expression of IL-1beta stimulated equine articular chondrocytes | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 221–7 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00253.x | journal = Veterinary surgery : VS }}</ref> The fact that cytokines themselves trigger the release of other cytokines<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11922866 | year = 2002 | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = LR | last2 = Moy | first2 = JN | last3 = Roebuck | first3 = KA | title = Respiratory syncytial virus and TNF alpha induction of chemokine gene expression involves differential activation of Rel A and NF-kappa B1 | volume = 2 | pages = 5 | pmc = 102322 | journal = BMC infectious diseases }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16191192 | year = 2005 | last1 = Tian | first1 = B | last2 = Nowak | first2 = DE | last3 = Brasier | first3 = AR | title = A TNF-induced gene expression program under oscillatory NF-kappaB control | volume = 6 | pages = 137 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-6-137 | pmc = 1262712 | journal = BMC Genomics }}</ref> and also lead to increased oxidant stress makes them important in chronic [[inflammation]], as well as other immunoresponses, such as fever and acute phase proteins of the liver (IL-1,6,12, INF-a).

== Receptors ==
{{Main|Cytokine receptor}}
In recent years, the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves, partly because of their remarkable characteristics, and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states. In this regard, and also because the redundancy and pleiomorphism of cytokines are, in fact, a consequence of their homologous receptors, many authorities think that a classification of cytokine receptors would be more clinically and experimentally useful.

A classification of cytokine receptors based on their three-dimensional structure has, therefore, been attempted. Such a classification, though seemingly cumbersome, provides several unique perspectives for attractive pharmacotherapeutic targets.

* [[Immunoglobulin superfamily|Immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily]], which are ubiquitously present throughout several cells and tissues of the vertebrate body, and share structural [[homology (biology)|homology]] with immunoglobulins ([[antibody|antibodies]]), [[cell adhesion molecule]]s, and even some cytokines. Examples: IL-1 receptor types.
* Hemopoietic [[Growth Factor]] (type 1) family, whose members have certain conserved motifs in their extracellular [[amino-acid]] domain. The IL-2 receptor belongs to this chain, whose γ-chain (common to several other cytokines) deficiency is directly responsible for the x-linked form of [[Severe Combined Immunodeficiency]] ([[X-SCID]]).
* [[Interferon]] (type 2) family, whose members are receptors for IFN β and γ.
* [[Tumor necrosis factors]] (TNF) (type 3) family, whose members share a [[cysteine]]-rich common extracellular binding domain, and includes several other non-cytokine [[ligands]] like [[CD40]], [[CD27]] and [[CD30]], besides the ligands on which the family is named (TNF).
* [[7TM Receptor|Seven transmembrane helix]] family, the ubiquitous receptor type of the animal kingdom. All [[G protein-coupled receptors]] (for hormones and neurotransmitters) belong to this family.  Chemokine receptors, two of which act as binding proteins for [[HIV]] ([[CD4]] and [[CCR5]]), also belong to this family.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* [[Interleukin-17 receptor]] (IL-17R) family, which shows little homology with any other cytokine receptor family. Structural motifs conserved between members of this family include: an extracellular fibronectin III-like domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic SERIF domain. The known members of this family are as follows: IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL17RD and IL-17RE.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gaffen|first=Sarah|title=Structure and signalling in the IL-17 receptor superfamily|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|year=2009|month=August|volume=9|pages=556–567}}</ref>
*[[Interleukin-12]] (IL-12),secreted by Macrophage and act on THo (t-helper cell 0) and convert into TH1 (t-helper cell 1)which produce γ-IF.γ-IF activates Macrophage into super active cell which start cell mediated response.

== Disease ==
Adverse effects of cytokines have been linked to many disease states and conditions ranging from [[major depression]]<ref name="pmid20015486">{{cite journal | author = Dowlati Y, Herrmann N, Swardfager W, Liu H, Sham L, Reim EK, Lanctôt KL | title = A meta-analysis of cytokines in major depression | journal = Biol Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 446–457 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20015486 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.09.033}}</ref> and [[Alzheimer's disease]]<ref name="pmid20692646">{{cite journal | author = Swardfager W, Lanctôt K, Rothenburg L, Wong A, Cappell J, Herrmann N | title = A meta-analysis of cytokines in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Biol Psychiatry | volume = 68 | issue = 10 | pages = 930–941 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20692646 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.06.012}}</ref> to [[cancer]]<ref name="pmid11239407">{{cite journal | author = Locksley RM, Killeen N, Lenardo MJ | title = The TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies: integrating mammalian biology | journal = Cell | volume = 104 | issue = 4 | pages = 487–501 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11239407 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00237-9 }}</ref> with levels either being elevated or changed. Over-secretion of cytokines can trigger a dangerous syndrome known as a [[cytokine storm]]; this may have been the cause of severe adverse events during a clinical trial of [[TGN1412]]. Cytokine storms also were the main cause of death in the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 "Spanish Flu"]] pandemic. Deaths were weighted more heavily towards people with healthy immune systems, due to its ability to produce stronger immune responses, like increasing cytokine levels. Another important<ref>{{cite journal|last=Makhija|first=Rohit|coauthors=Kingsnorth|journal=Journal of HBP surgery|year=2002|volume=9|pages=401–410}}</ref>  example of cytokine storm is seen in acute pancreatitis. Cytokines are integral and implicated in all angles of the cascade resulting in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multi organ failure associated with this intra-abdominal catastrophe.

Plasma levels of various cytokines may give information on the presence, or even predictive value of inflammatory processes involved in autoimmune diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]],<ref>Kokkonen, H.
