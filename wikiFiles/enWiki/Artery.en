'''Arteries''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀρτηρία - ''artēria'', "windpipe, artery")<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rthri%2Fa ἀρτηρία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> are [[blood vessel]]s that carry blood away from the [[heart]]. This blood is normally oxygenated, exceptions made for the [[pulmonary arteries|pulmonary]] and [[Umbilical artery|umbilical arteries]].  The [[Effective Arterial Blood Volume]] (EABV) is that extracellular fluid (ECF) which fills the arterial system.

The [[circulatory system]] is extremely important for sustaining [[life]]. Its proper functioning is responsible for the delivery of [[oxygen]] and [[nutrient]]s to all cells, as well as the removal of [[carbon dioxide]] and waste products, maintenance of optimum [[pH]], and the mobility of the elements, proteins and cells of the [[immune system]]. In [[developed country|developed countries]], the two [[leading causes of death]], [[myocardial infarction]] and [[stroke]], each may directly result from an arterial system that has been slowly and progressively compromised by years of deterioration. (See [[atherosclerosis]]).

== Description ==

The arterial system is the higher-[[blood pressure|pressure]] portion of the circulatory system. Arterial pressure varies between the peak pressure during heart contraction, called the [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] pressure, and the minimum, or [[diastole|diastolic]] pressure between contractions, when the heart expands and refills. This pressure variation within the artery produces the [[pulse]] which is observable in any artery, and reflects heart activity. Arteries also aid the heart in pumping blood. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, whereas [[vein]]s keep blood flowing towards the heart. Except [[pulmonary artery|pulmonary arteries]], which carry blood to the lungs for oxygenation, all arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the tissues that require oxygen.<ref>{{cite book

== Anatomy ==
{{See also|Arterial tree}}
{{plain image with caption|Artery.svg|Diagram of an artery.|right}}

The anatomy of arteries can be separerated into [[gross anatomy]], at the macroscopic level, and [[histology|microscopic anatomy]], which must be studied with the aid of a [[microscope]].

=== Gross anatomy ===

The arterial system of the [[human body]] is divided into [[systemic arteries]], carrying blood from the heart to the whole body, and [[pulmonary artery|pulmonary arteries]], carrying blood from the [[heart]] to the [[lung]]s.

==== Systemic arteries ====
{{See also|Systemic circulation}}

Systemic arteries are the arteries of the [[systemic circulation]], which is the part of the [[circulatory system|cardiovascular system]] which carries [[oxygen]]ated [[blood]] away from the heart, to the [[body]], and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart.

==== Pulmonary arteries ====
{{See also|Pulmonary circulation}}

Pulmonary arteries are the arteries of the [[pulmonary circulation]], which is the portion of the [[circulatory system|cardiovascular system]] which carries deoxygenated [[blood]] away from the heart, to the [[lung]]s, and returns oxygenated blood back to the heart.

=== Microscopic anatomy ===
The outermost layer is known as the ''[[tunica externa (vessels)|tunica externa]]'' formerly known as "tunica adventitia" and is composed of [[connective tissue]]. Inside this layer is the ''[[tunica media]]'', or ''media'', which is made up of [[smooth muscle]] cells and elastic tissue. The innermost layer, which is in direct contact with the flow of blood is the ''[[tunica intima]]'', commonly called the ''intima''. This layer is made up of mainly [[endothelium|endothelial cell]]s. The hollow internal cavity in which the blood flows is called the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].

== Types of arteries ==
=== Pulmonary arteries ===

The [[pulmonary artery|pulmonary arteries]] carry deoxygenated [[blood]] that has just returned from the body to the [[heart]] towards the [[lung]]s, where [[carbon dioxide]] is exchanged for [[oxygen]].

=== Systemic arteries ===

Systemic arteries can be subdivided into two types - muscular and elastic - according to the relative compositions of elastic and muscle tissue in their tunica media as well as their size and the makeup of the internal and external elastic lamina. The larger arteries (>10mm diameter) are generally elastic and the smaller ones (0.1-10mm) tend to be muscular. Systemic arteries deliver blood to the [[arterioles]], and then to the [[capillaries]], where nutrients and gasses are exchanged.

=== Aorta ===

The [[aorta]] is the root [[systemic circulation|systemic]] artery. It receives blood directly from the left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] of the heart via the [[aortic valve]]. As the aorta branches, and these arteries branch in turn, they become successively smaller in diameter, down to the [[arteriole]]. The [[arteriole]]s supply [[capillaries]] which in turn empty into [[venule]]s. The very first branches off of the aorta are the [[Coronary circulation|coronary arteries]], which supply blood to the heart muscle itself. These are followed by the branches off the aortic arch, namely the [[brachiocephalic artery]], the [[left common carotid]] and the [[left subclavian]] arteries.

=== Arterioles ===

[[Arterioles]], the smallest of the true arteries, help regulate [[blood pressure]] by the variable contraction of the smooth muscle of their walls, and deliver blood to the capillaries.

=== Arterioles and blood pressure ===

[[Arterioles]] have the greatest collective influence on both local blood flow and on overall blood pressure. They are the primary "adjustable nozzles" in the blood system, across which the greatest pressure drop occurs. The combination of heart output ([[cardiac output]]) and [[systemic vascular resistance]], which refers to the collective resistance of all of the body's [[arteriole]]s, are the principal determinants of arterial blood pressure at any given moment.

=== Capillaries ===
{{main|Capillaries}}
The [[capillaries]] are where all of the important exchanges happen in the [[circulatory system]]. The capillaries are a single cell in diameter to aid fast and easy diffusion of gases, sugars and other nutrients to surrounding tissues.

==== Functions of capillaries ====

Capillaries have no [[smooth muscle]] surrounding them and have a diameter less than that of [[red blood cells]]; a red blood cell is typically 7 micrometers outside diameter, capillaries typically 5 micrometers inside diameter. The red blood cells must distort in order to pass through the capillaries.

These small diameters of the capillaries provide a relatively large surface area for the exchange of gases and nutrients.

==== What capillaries do ====

* In the [[lung]]s, [[carbon dioxide]] is exchanged for [[oxygen]]
* In the tissues, oxygen and carbon dioxide and nutrients and wastes are exchanged
* In the [[kidney]]s, wastes are released to be eliminated from the body
* In the [[intestine]], nutrients are picked up, and wastes released

==Embryonic development==

Arterial formation begins before the onset of blood flow, when [[endothelial cell]]s begin to express arterial specific genes, such as [[EPH receptor B2|Ephrin B2]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Swift|first=MR|coauthors=Weinstein, BM|title=Arterial-venous specification during development.|journal=Circulation research|date=2009 Mar 13|volume=104|issue=5|pages=576–88|pmid=19286613}}</ref> 

== Pathology ==

A number of pathological conditions can affect arteries.

=== Blood pressure ===

[[Systemic circulation|Systemic]] arterial pressures, are generated by the forceful contractions of the heart's [[left ventricle]]. (See [[blood pressure]])

Healthy resting arterial pressures, are relatively low, mean systemic pressures typically being under 100 mmHg, about 1.8&nbsp;lbf/in², above surrounding [[atmospheric pressure]] (about 760 mmHg or 14.7&nbsp;lbf/in² at sea level).

To withstand and adapt to the pressures within, arteries are surrounded by varying thicknesses of [[smooth muscle]] which have extensive elastic and inelastic [[connective tissue]]s.

The pulse pressure, i.e. [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] vs. [[Diastole|diastolic]] difference, is determined primarily by the amount of blood ejected by each heart beat, [[stroke volume]], versus the volume and elasticity of the major arteries.

Over time, elevated arterial [[blood sugar]] (see [[Diabetes Mellitus]]), [[lipoprotein]] [[cholesterol]], and [[high blood pressure|pressure]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], and other factors are all involved in damaging both the [[endothelium]] and walls of the arteries, resulting in [[atherosclerosis]].

=== Atheroma ===

An [[atheroma]] or plaque in the artery wall is a build up of cell debris, that contain lipids (cholesterol and fatty acids), calcium and a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue.

== History ==

Among the ancient Greeks, the arteries were considered to be "air holders" that were responsible for the transport of air to the tissues and were connected to the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. This was as a result of finding the arteries of the dead devoid of blood.

In medieval times, it was recognized that arteries carried a fluid, called "spiritual blood" or "vital spirits", considered to be different from the contents of the [[vein]]s. This theory went back to [[Galen]]. In the late medieval period, the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]],<ref>Oxford English Dictionary.</ref> and [[ligaments]] were also called "arteries".<ref>Shakespeare, William. Hamlet Complete, Authoritative Text with Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical Perspectives. Boston: Bedford Books of St. Martins Press, 1994. pg. 50.</ref>

[[William Harvey]] described and popularized the modern concept of the circulatory system and the roles of arteries and veins in the 17th century.

[[Alexis Carrel]] at the beginning of 20th century first described the technique for vascular suturing and anastomosis and successfully performed many organ transplantations in animals; he thus actually opened the way to modern vascular surgery that was before limited to vessels permanent ligatation.

[[Theodor Kocher]] reported that [[atherosclerosis]] frequently developed in patients undergoing to thyroidectomy and suggested that [[hypothyroidism]] favors atherosclerosis, which was, in the 900's at the autopsies, more frequent in iodine-deficient Austrians compared to  Icelanders, which are not deficient in [[iodine]]. Turner reported the effectiveness of [[iodide]] and dried  extracts of  [[thyroid]] in prevention of atherosclerosis in laboratory rabbits.
