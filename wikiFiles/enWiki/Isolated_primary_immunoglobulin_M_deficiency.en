The immunodeficiency has been associated with some clinical disorders including recurrent infections, [[atopy]], [[Bloom's syndrome]], [[celiac disease]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] and malignancy, but, surprisingly, SIgMD seems to also occur in asymptomatic individuals.<ref name="Yel2009">{{cite journal|author=Yel L, Ramanuja S, Gupta S|title=Clinical and Immunological Features in IgM Deficiency|journal=Int Arch Allergy Immunol|year=2009|volume=150|issue=3|pages=291–8|doi=10.1159/000222682|pmid=19494527}}</ref> High incidences of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (77%), [[asthma]] (47%) and [[allergic rhinitis]] (36%) have also been reported.<ref name="Goldstein2006">{{cite journal|author=Goldstein MF, Goldstein AL, Dunsky EH, Dvorin DJ, Belecanech GA, Shamir K|title=Selective IgM immunodeficiency: retrospective analysis of 36 adult patients with review of the literature|journal=Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol|year=2006|volume=97|issue=6|pages=717–30|doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60962-3|pmid=17201230

The etiology of selective IgM deficiency remains unclear, although various mechanisms have been proposed, such as an increase in [[regulatory T cell]] functions, defective [[T helper cell]] functions and impaired terminal [[B cell#Development of B cells|differentiation]] of [[B cell|B lymphocytes]] into IgM-secreting cells among others.<ref name=Yel2009 /> It is however puzzling that [[Immunoglobulin class switching|class switching]] seems to happen normally (serum levels of other antibodies are normal), while dysfunctioning of IgM synthesis is expected to occur together with abnormalities in other immunoglobulins. Notwithstanding a clear pathogenesis and commonly accepted defenition, a cutoff for SIgMD could be the lower limit of the serum IgM reference range, such as 43&nbsp;mg/dL<ref>{{cite web|title=Revised reference range IgM|url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pathology/services/clinical/change_of_service/cp/2010/093010_Revised_reference_range_igm.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2011|author=UC Davis Medical Center}}</ref> in adults or even 20&nbsp;mg/dL.<ref name=merck>{{cite book|title=The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy|year=2004|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.|pages=Appendix II|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/index.html}}</ref>
