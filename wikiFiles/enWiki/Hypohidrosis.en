'''Hypohidrosis''' is diminished sweating in response to appropriate stimuli. While [[hyperhidrosis]] is a socially troubling but [[benign]] condition, hypohidrosis can lead to [[hyperthermia]], heat exhaustion, heat stroke and potentially death.<ref name="AHYPO">{{Cite pmid|23094789|noedit}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Sweat is readily visualized by a topical indicator such as iodinated starch ([[minor test]]) or sodium alizarin sulphonate. Both of which undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat. A thermoregulatory sweat test can evaluate the body’s response to a thermal stimulus by inducing sweating through a hot box ⁄ room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing indicates hypohidrosis, and further tests may be required to localize the [[lesion]].

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] of the brain and ⁄ or spinal cord is the best modality for evaluation when the lesion is suspected to be localized to the [[central nervous system]].

[[Skin biopsies]] are useful when anhidrosis occurs as part of a [[dermatological]] disorder. Biopsy results may reveal the sweat gland destruction, [[necrosis]] or [[fibrosis]], in addition to the findings of the primary dermatological disorder.

==Management==
The treatment options for hypohidrosis and anhidrosis is limited. Those with hypohidrosis should avoid drugs that can aggravate the condition (see medication-causes). They should limit activities that raise the core body temperature and if exercises are to be performed, they should be supervised and be performed in a cool, sheltered and well-ventilated environment. In instances where the cause is known, treatment should be directed at the primary pathology. In autoimmune diseases, such as [[Sjogren syndrome]] and [[systemic sclerosis]], treatment of the underlying disease using [[immunosuppressive drugs]] may lead to improvement in hypohidrosis. In neurological diseases, the primary pathology is often irreversible. In these instances, prevention of further neurological damage, such as good glycaemic control in [[diabetes]], is the cornerstone of management. In [[acquired generalized anhidrosis]], spontaneous remission may be observed in some cases. Numerous cases have been reported to respond effectively to systemic [[corticosteroids]]. Although an optimum dose and regime has not been established, pulse [[methylprednisolone]] (up to 1000&nbsp;mg ⁄ day) has been reported to have good effect.
