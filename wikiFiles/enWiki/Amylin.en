'''Amylin,''' or '''Islet Amyloid Polypeptide''' ('''IAPP'''), is a 37-residue [[peptide hormone]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: IAPP islet amyloid polypeptide| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3375| accessdate = }}</ref>  It is cosecreted with [[insulin]] from the pancreatic [[beta cell|β-cells]] in the ratio of approximately 100:1.  Amylin plays a role in glycemic regulation by slowing gastric emptying and promoting satiety, thereby preventing [[Postprandial|post-prandial]] spikes in blood glucose levels.

IAPP is processed from an 89-residue [[coding sequence]].  '''Proislet Amyloid Polypeptide''' (proIAPP,Proamylin, Amyloid Polypeptide Precursor, Proislet Protein) is produced in the pancreatic [[beta cells]] (β-cells) as a 67 amino acid, 7404 Dalton pro-peptide and undergoes [[post-translational modifications]] including protease cleavage to produce amylin.<ref name=Higham>{{cite journal | author = Higham CE, Hull RL, Lawrie L, Shennan KI, Morris JF, Birch NP, Docherty K, Clark A | title = Processing of synthetic pro-islet amyloid polypeptide (proIAPP) 'amylin' by recombinant prohormone convertase enzymes, PC2 and PC3, in vitro | journal = Eur.

== Synthesis ==

[[Image:ProIAPP.jpg|thumb|Post-translational Modification of proIAPP to form IAPP]]

ProIAPP consists of 67 [[amino acids]], which follow a 22 amino acid [[signal peptide]] ''(parentheses)'' which is rapidly cleaved after translation of the 89 amino acid coding sequence. The human sequence (from [[N-terminus]] to [[C-terminus]]) is:

Once released from the signal peptide, it undergoes additional [[proteolysis]] and [[posttranslational modification]] ''(indicated by '''^''')''. 11 amino acids are removed from the N-terminus by the enzyme [[proprotein convertase 2]] (PC2) while 16 are removed from the C-terminus of the proIAPP molecule by proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3).<ref name=Sanke1988>{{cite journal | author = Sanke T, Bell GI, Sample C, Rubenstein AH, Steiner DF | title = An islet amyloid peptide is derived from an 89-amino acid precursor by proteolytic processing | journal = J.

== Regulation ==

Insulin and IAPP are regulated by similar factors since they share a common regulatory [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] motif.<ref name="pmid10933741">{{cite journal | author = Höppener JW, Ahrén B, Lips CJ | title = Islet amyloid and type 2 diabetes mellitus | journal = N.

This is a condition wherein the body is unable to utilize insulin effectively, resulting in increased insulin production; since [[proinsulin]] and proIAPP are cosecreted, this results in an increase in the production of proIAPP as well.

Although little is known about IAPP regulation, its connection to insulin indicates that regulatory mechanism that affect insulin also affect IAPP. Thus [[blood glucose]] levels play an important role in regulation of proIAPP synthesis.

== Function ==

Amylin functions as part of the [[endocrine]] [[pancreas]] and contributes to [[glycemic control]]. The peptide is secreted from the pancreatic islets into the blood circulation and is cleared by peptidases in the kidney. It is not found in the urine.

Amylin's metabolic function is now somewhat well characterized as an inhibitor of the appearance of nutrient [especially glucose] in the plasma.<ref name="Pittner_1994">{{cite journal | author = Pittner RA, Albrandt K, Beaumont K, Gaeta LS, Koda JE, Moore CX, Rittenhouse J, Rink TJ | title = Molecular physiology of amylin | journal = J.

The overall effect to slow the rate of appearance (Ra) of glucose from the meal is accomplished via coordinate slowing down gastric emptying, inhibition of digestive secretion [gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, and bile ejection], and a resulting reduction in food intake. Appearance of new glucose is slowed down by inhibiting secretion of the gluconeogenic hormone [[glucagon]]. These actions, which are mostly carried out via a glucose-sensitive part of the brain stem, the [[area postrema]], may be over-ridden during hypoglycemia. They collectively reduce the total insulin demand.<ref name="Ratner">{{cite journal |author=Ratner RE, Dickey R, Fineman M, Maggs DG, Shen L, Strobel SA, Weyer C, Kolterman OG |title=Amylin replacement with pramlintide as an adjunct to insulin therapy improves long-term glycaemic and weight control in Type 1 diabetes mellitus: a 1-year, randomized controlled trial|journal=Diabet Med |volume= 21 |issue= 11|pages=1204–12 |year= 2004 | pmid = 15498087 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-5491.2004.01319.x}}</ref>

Amylin also acts in bone metabolism, along with the related peptides [[calcitonin]] and [[calcitonin gene related peptide]].<ref name="Pittner_1994"/> 

Rodent amylin [[Gene knockout|knockout]]s are known to fail to achieve the normal [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] following food consumption.  Because it is an amidated peptide, like many [[neuropeptide]]s, it is believed to be responsible for the anorectic effect.

== Structure ==

The human form of IAPP has the amino acid sequence KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY, with a disulfide bridge between cysteine residues 2 and 7. Both the amidated C-terminus and the disulfide bridge are necessary for the full biological activity of amylin.<ref name=Roberts1990>{{cite journal | author = Roberts AN, Leighton B, Todd JA, Cockburn D, Schofield PN, Sutton R, Holt S, Boyd Y, Day AJ, Foot EA | title = Molecular and functional characterization of amylin, a peptide associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus | journal = Proc.

Studies have shown that fibrils are the end product and not necessarily the most toxic form of amyloid proteins/peptides in general.

IAPP was identified independently by two groups as the major component of [[diabetes]]-associated islet [[amyloid]] deposits in 1987.<ref name="Cooper">{{cite journal |author=Cooper GJ, Willis AC, Clark A, Turner RC, Sim RB, Reid KB |title=Purification and characterization of a peptide from amyloid-rich pancreases of type 2 diabetic patients|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proc Natl Acad Sci USA]] |volume= 84 |issue= 23|pages=8628–32 |year= 1987 | pmid = 3317417 |doi=10.1073/pnas.84.23.8628 |pmc=299599}}</ref><ref name="Westermark">{{cite journal |author=Westermark P, Wernstedt C, Wilander E, Hayden DW, O'Brien TD, Johnson KH |title=Amyloid fibrils in human insulinoma and islets of Langerhans of the diabetic cat are derived from a neuropeptide-like protein also present in normal islet cells|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proc Natl Acad Sci USA]] |volume= 84 |issue= 11|pages=3881–3885 |year= 1987 | pmid = 3035556 |doi=10.1073/pnas.84.11.3881 |pmc=304980}}</ref>

The difference in nomenclature is largely geographical; European researchers tend to prefer IAPP whereas American researchers tend to prefer amylin.  Some researchers discourage the use of "amylin" on the grounds that it may be confused with the pharmaceutical company.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Clinical significance==

ProIAPP has been linked to Type 2 diabetes and the loss of islet β-cells.<ref name=Paulsson2005>{{cite journal | author = Paulsson JF, Westermark GT | title = Aberrant processing of human proislet amyloid polypeptide results in increased amyloid formation | journal = Diabetes | volume = 54 | issue = 7 | pages = 2117–25 | year = 2005 | month = July | pmid = 15983213 | doi = | url = }}</ref>  Islet [[amyloid]] formation, initiated by the aggregation of proIAPP, may contribute to this progressive loss of islet β-cells. It is thought that proIAPP forms the first granules that allow for IAPP to aggregate and form amyloid which may lead to amyloid-induced [[apoptosis]] of β-cells.

IAPP is cosecreted with insulin. Insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetes produces a greater demand for insulin production which results in the secretion of proinsulin.<ref name=Marzban2006>{{cite journal | author = Marzban L, Rhodes CJ, Steiner DF, Haataja L, Halban PA, Verchere CB | title = Impaired NH2-terminal processing of human proislet amyloid polypeptide by the prohormone convertase PC2 leads to amyloid formation and cell death | journal = Diabetes | volume = 55 | issue = 8 | pages = 2192–201 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 16873681 | doi = 10.2337/db05-1566 | url = }}</ref>  ProIAPP is secreted simultaneously, however, the enzymes that convert these precursor molecules into insulin and IAPP, respectively, are not able to keep up with the high levels of secretion, ultimately leading to the accumulation of proIAPP.

In particular, the impaired processing of proIAPP that occurs at the N-terminal cleavage site is a key factor in the initiation of amyloid.<ref name=Marzban2006 /> Post-translational modification of proIAPP occurs at both the carboxy terminus and the amino terminus, however, the processing of the amino terminus occurs later in the [[secretory pathway]]. This might be one reason why it is more susceptible to impaired processing under conditions where secretion is in high demand.<ref name=Marzban2005 />  Thus, the conditions of Type 2 diabetes—high glucose concentrations and increased secretory demand for insulin and IAPP—could lead to the impaired N-terminal processing of proIAPP. The unprocessed proIAPP can then serve as the granule upon which IAPP can accumulate and form amyloid.<ref name=Paulsson2006>{{cite journal | author = Paulsson JF, Andersson A, Westermark P, Westermark GT | title = Intracellular amyloid-like deposits contain unprocessed pro-islet amyloid polypeptide (proIAPP) in beta cells of transgenic mice overexpressing the gene for human IAPP and transplanted human islets | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 1237–46 | year = 2006 | month = June | pmid = 16570161 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-006-0206-7 | url = }}</ref>

The amyloid formation might be a major mediator of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the islet β-cells.<ref name=Paulsson2006 /> Initially, the proIAPP aggregates inside the cell. The proIAPP acts as a seed, collecting IAPP from neighboring cells and forming an intracellular amyloid. As the amyloid grows, it spreads outside of the cell. The extracellular amyloid begins to excrete IAPP to other cells, inducing similar amyloid formation in other β-cells. The overall effect is an apoptosis cascade initiated by the influx of ions into the β-cells.

[[Image:Amyloid Formation.jpg|thumb|General Scheme for Amyloid Formation]]

In summary, impaired N-terminal processing of proIAPP is an important factor initiating amyloid formation and β-cell death. These amyloid deposits are pathological characteristics of the [[pancreas]] in Type 2 diabetes. However, it is still unclear as to whether amyloid formation is involved in or merely a consequence of type 2 diabetes.<ref name=Marzban2006 />  Nevertheless it is clear that amyloid formation reduces working β-cells in patients with Type 2 diabetes. This suggests that repairing proIAPP processing may help to prevent β-cell death, thereby offering hope as a potential therapeutic approach for Type 2 diabetes.

Amyloid deposits deriving from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, or amylin) are commonly found in [[Islets of Langerhans|pancreatic islets]] of patients suffering [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], or containing an [[insulinoma]] cancer. While the association of amylin with the development of type 2 diabetes has been known for some time,<ref name="pmid12221327">{{cite journal | author = Hayden MR | title = Islet amyloid, metabolic syndrome, and the natural progressive history of type 2 diabetes mellitus | journal = JOP | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 126–38 | year = 2002 | month = September | pmid = 12221327 | doi = }}</ref> its direct role as the cause has been harder to establish.  Recent results suggest that amylin, like the related [[beta-amyloid]] (Abeta) associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]], can induce [[apoptosis|apoptotic cell-death]] in [[insulin]]-producing [[beta cells]], an effect that may be relevant to the development of type 2 diabetes.<ref name="pmid8152488">{{cite journal | author = Lorenzo A, Razzaboni B, Weir GC, Yankner BA | title = Pancreatic islet cell toxicity of amylin associated with type-2 diabetes mellitus | journal = Nature | volume = 368 | issue = 6473 | pages = 756–60 | year = 1994 | month = April | pmid = 8152488 | doi = 10.1038/368756a0 }}</ref>
