'''Angiomyolipomas''' are the most common benign tumour of the kidney and are composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle cells and fat cells. Angiomyolipomas are strongly associated with the genetic disease [[tuberous sclerosis]], in which most individuals will have several angiomyolipomas affecting both kidneys. They are also commonly found in women with the rare lung disease [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]]. Angiomyolipomas are less commonly found in the liver and rarely in other organs. Whether associated with these diseases or sporadic, angiomyolipomas are caused by mutations in either the [[TSC1]] or [[TSC2]] genes, which govern cell growth and proliferation.

Although regarded as benign, angiomyolipomas may grow such that [[chronic kidney disease|kidney function is impaired]] or the blood vessels may [[aneurysm|dilate]] and burst leading to haemorrhage. Large angiomyolipoma can be treated with [[embolisation]]. Drug therapy for angiomyolipoma is at the research stage.

==Classification==

Angiomyolipomas are tumours consisting of [[perivascular]] [[epithelioid]] cells (cells which are found surrounding blood vessels and which resemble [[epithelial cells]]). A tumour of this kind is known as a [[PEComa]], from the initials of perivascular epithelioid cell. Older literature may classify them as [[hamartomas]] (benign tumours consisting of cells in their correct location but forming a disorganised mass) or [[choristoma]] (benign tumours consisting of normal cells in the wrong location). PEComas are themselves a kind of [[mesenchymal tumour]] which involves cells that form the [[connective tissue]], [[cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]] and [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic]] systems.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

An angiomyolipoma is composed of varying proportions of [[vascular cell]]s, immature [[smooth muscle cell]]s and [[fat cell]]s.<ref name=Bissler2010/> These three components respectively give rise to the components of the name: angio-, myo- and lip-. The -oma suffix is indicates a tumour.

Angiomyolipomas are typically found in the kidney but have also been commonly found in the liver and less commonly the ovary, fallopian tube, spermatic cord, palate and colon.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

==Symptoms==

If the dilated blood vessels in an angiomyolipoma rupture, the resulting [[retroperitoneal hemorrhage|retroperitoneal haemorrhage]] causes sudden pain, accompanied with nausea and vomiting. When the patient presents in the [[emergency department]], up to 20% will be in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref name=Bissler2010/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Angiomyolipoma.PEComa.JPG|thumb|Myoid cells with clear cytoplasm spinning off of large vessels in a background of mature fat: the classic microscopic features of angiomyolipoma.]]

Since all three components of an angiomyolipoma (vascular cells, immature smooth muscle cells and fat cells) contain a [[Two-hit hypothesis|"second hit" mutation]], they are believed to have derived from a common [[progenitor cell]] that suffered the common second hit mutation.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

==Diagnosis==

There are three methods of scanning that detect angiomyolipoma: ultrasound, CT and MRI. Ultrasound is standard and is particularly sensitive to the fat in angiomyolipoma but less so to the solid components. However it is hard to make accurate measurements with ultrasound. Computed tomography (CT) is very detailed and fast and allows accurate measurement. However, it exposes the patient to radiation and the dangers that a contrast dye used to aid the scanning may itself harm the kidneys. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is safer than CT but many patients (particularly those with the learning difficulties or behavioural problems found in tuberous sclerosis) require sedation or general anaesthesia and the scan cannot be performed quickly.<ref name=Bissler2010/> Some other kidney tumours contain fat, so the presence of fat isn't diagnostic. It can be difficult to distinguish a fat-poor angiomyolipoma from a [[renal cell carcinoma]]<ref name=Shin2010/> and a lesion growing at greater than 5&nbsp;mm per year may warrant a biopsy in order to distinguish it from a from this form of cancer.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

==Treatment==

Angiomyolipoma do not normally require surgery unless there is life threatening bleeding.<ref name=Shin2010/> Some centres may perform preventative selective [[embolisation]] of the angiomyolipoma if it is more than 4&nbsp;cm in diameter, due to the risk of haemorrhage.<ref name=Loffroy2010/>

People with tuberous sclerosis are advised to have yearly renal scans, though it is possible that patients with very stable lesions could be monitored less frequently. The research in this area is lacking. Even if no angiomyolipoma is found, one can develop at any life stage. The angiomyolipoma can grow rapidly.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

In tuberous sclerosis, there are typically many angiomyolipomas affecting each kidney. It is not uncommon for more than one intervention to be required during lifetime. Since kidney function may already be impaired (up to half the kidney may be lost before function loss is detectable), it is vital to preserve as much kidney as possible when removing any lesion. Large angiomyolipomas are treated by [[embolisation]] which reduces the risk of haemorrhage and can also shrink the lesion. A side effect of this treatment is postembolisation syndrome: severe pain and fever however this is easily managed and lasts only a few days.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

A ruptured aneurysm in an angiomyolipoma leads to blood loss that must be stopped (though embolisation) and compensated for (through intravenous [[fluid replacement]]). Therefore, removal of the affected kidney ([[nephrectomy]]) is strongly discouraged though may occur if the emergency department is not knowledgeable about tuberous sclerosis.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

Embolisation involves inserting a [[catheter]] along the blood vessels to the tumour. The blood vessels are then [[Vascular occlusion|blocked]], typically by injecting ethanol or inert particles. The procedure can be very painful, so [[analgesic]]s are used. The destroyed kidney tissue often causes post-embolisation syndrome, which manifests as nausea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain, and lasts a few days. Embolisation (in general) has an 8% rate of [[morbidity]] and a 2.5% rate of [[Mortality rate|mortality]], so is not considered lightly.<ref name=Loffroy2010/>

Patients with kidney loss should be monitored for hypertension (and treated for it if discovered) and avoid nephrotoxic drugs such as certain pain relievers and IV contrast agents. Such patients who are unable to communicate effectively (due to age or intellectual disability) are at risk of dehydration. Where multiple or large angiomyolipomas have caused [[chronic kidney disease]], dialysis is required.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

[[Rapamycin]] and related drugs have been studied for their effect on angiomyolipomas due to their action on the pathways that are disrupted when TSC1 and TSC2 genes are broken. Small studies showed the lesions shrank but that the drugs were often toxic. The use of these drugs remains at the research stage.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

==Prognosis==

Small angiomyolipomas and those without [[Vasodilation|dilated]] blood vessels ([[aneurysms]]) cause few problems, but angiomyolipomas have been known to grow as rapidly as 4&nbsp;cm in one year. An angiomyolipoma larger than 5&nbsp;cm and those containing an aneurysm pose a significant risk of rupture, which is a medical emergency as it is potentially life threatening. One population study found the cumulative risk of haemorrhage to be 10% in males and 20% in females.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

A second problem occurs when the renal angiomyolipomas take over so much kidney that the function is impaired leading to [[chronic kidney disease]]. This may be severe enough to require [[dialysis]]. A population survey of patients with TSC and normal intelligence found 1% were on dialysis.<ref name=Bissler2010/>

==Epidemiology==

Angiomyolipomas are the most common benign tumour of the kidney and are found either in patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadically. About 80–90% of cases are sporadic and these are most commonly found in middle-aged women.<ref name=Shin2010/>

In patients with TSC, a [[longitudinal study]] found 80% will have some form of renal lesion by around 10 years of age. Of these, 75% are angiomyolipomas and 17% cysts. The angiomyolipomas increased in size in around 60% of these children. An autopsy study and TSC clinic survey found a prevalence of 67% and 85% respectively for patients with TSC. Both genders are affected equally.<ref name=Bissler2010/>
