The '''Faculty of Life Sciences''' is one of the four faculties that comprise the [[University of Manchester]]. It was established in 2004 from the merger of its constituent departments:  Biological Sciences and the Centre for the History of Science, Technology  & Medicine in the [[Victoria University of Manchester]]  and  Biomolecular Sciences and  Optometry & Neuroscience at [[UMIST]]. Uniquely for Manchester it is a faculty consisting of only one school. The term [[Life sciences]] is generally understood to be wider than [[biology]], including for example interdisciplinary areas that lie between biology and medicine. The inclusion of Optmetry and Neuroscience in the Faculty reflects this intention while some other areas generally included in a definition of Life Sciences, such as Biomedical Imaging and Pharmacy, are located in the [[Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences (University of Manchester)|Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences]] at Manchester. 

In 2008 the Faculty teaches  2200 undergraduate students and has 467 postgraduate students and has 270 academic staff.<ref>Faculty of Life Sciences, About us [http://www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/about/] Accessed 1 January 2009</ref> In the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] the Faculty came 3rd in the UK on the basis of Grade Point Average for Biological Sciences with 107 staff submitted, and 2nd in the UK for Preclinical and Human Biological Sciences with 72 staff submitted.

==History of life sciences at the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST==

===Department of Zoology (Victoria University of Manchester, 1879–1986)===
Zoology was taught at Manchester<ref>ELGAR: Electronic Gateway to Archives at Rylands GB 133 DZO - Archive of the University of Manchester, Department of Zoology [http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/search/eadSearchHandler?operation=full&recid=gb133dzo]</ref>
since the foundation of [[Owens College]] in 1851 when [[William Crawford Williamson]] was appointed  professor of natural history with responsibilities to teach botany, physiology, geology and zoology. His teaching load was reduced by the creation of independent chairs in geology (1874), and zoology (1879).

Williamson embodied a traditional view of [[natural history]], with its strong bias to taxonomic classification. From the 1860s onwards this approach began to change under the influence of German university biologists. The appointment of Arthur Milnes Marshall (1852–1893) as professor of zoology at Owens in 1879 led to the adoption of this 'new biology' approach at Manchester. Marshall had been trained these methods at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Marshall modernised the zoology curriculum, introduced courses in elementary biology and [[embryology]], and lobbied for the establishment of dedicated research laboratories. In 1887, the Beyer laboratories were opened, funded by a local industrialist, C. F. Beyer; they were conveniently placed next to the [[Manchester Museum]]. Marshall's career ended when he was killed in a climbing accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/marshallarthurpapers/ |title=Arthur Marshall papers| publisher=John Rylands University Library|accessdate=2011-04-07}}</ref>

Marshall was succeeded by Sydney Hickson (1859–1940) in 1894 who held the chair until 1926. He was a marine zoologist and an expert in the study of corals. Under Hickson the department saw steady growth in staff and students, with the emergence of distinct research specialisms. On his retirement in 1926, he was succeeded by J. S. Dunkerly (1881–1930) a protozoologist and an authority on [[Flagellata|Flagellates]] from the [[University of Glasgow]] who died in 1931. Herbert Graham Cannon (1897–1963), previously professor of zoology at Sheffield, was elected to the [[Charles Beyer|Beyer]] chair in his place. In 1948 R. Dennell was appointed professor of experimental zoology.<ref>Charlton, H. B. (1951) ''Portrait of a University''. Manchester: University Press; p. 177</ref>

During the 1960s and 1980s the work of the Department included J. Gordon Blower's work on the population genetics of [[millipede]]s, [[Derek Yalden|Yalden]]'s on the distribution of fauna in the [[Peak District National Park]] and the mammals of [[Ethiopia]], Gabbutt's on the biology of the [[pseudoscorpion]]s,<ref>P. D. Gabbutt (1970) "Validity of Life History Analyses of Pseudoscorpions". ''Journal of Natural History''; 4: 1–15.</ref> R. D. Butler's on the contractile systems in [[protozoa]], and Roger Wood's on the genetics of mosquitoes.

By the 1980s, it was recognised that some of the distinctions between the traditional biological disciplines were no longer as relevant as in the past and the University instituted a major review of the biological sciences at the University. A  working party was established under Professor John Willmott that recommended greater integration in teaching and research between traditional biological disciplines, and a closer relationship between biological and medical departments. This led to the creation of a School of Biological Sciences in 1986, based on four divisions: biochemistry and molecular biology, cell and structural biology, environmental biology and physiological sciences. Nine departments of the faculties of science and medicine were abolished, including Botany and Zoology. Professor A. P. J. (Tony) Trinci (a [[microbiology|microbiologist]]) was the first chairman of the School of Biological Sciences. Fourteen members of the Department of Botany joined the new division of cell and structural biology, and six became part of environmental biology.

Professors of Zoology, at the Victoria University of Manchester included
* Arthur Milnes Marshall 1879–1893
* Sydney John Hickson 1894–1926
* John S. Dunkerly 1926–1931
* Herbert Graham Cannon 1931–1963
* Ralph Dennell 1963–1974 (professor of experimental zoology from 1948)
* Arthur Cain 1964–1968
* Edwin Trueman 1969–1982

===Department of Botany (Victoria University of Manchester, 1879–1986)===
Botany has been also taught at Manchester since 1851<ref>GB 133 DBO - Archive of the University of Manchester, Department of Botany [http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/search/eadSearchHandler?operation=full&recid=gb133dbo]</ref> when William Crawford Williamson (1816–1896) was appointed as professor of natural history, anatomy and physiology. Williamson originally taught botany, zoology, geology and comparative anatomy. This teaching burden was reduced with the establishment of chairs in geology (1872) and zoology (1879), and with the creation of the Medical School in 1872 eventually allowing Williamson to concentrate on botany. As in zoology, there was an initial concentration on taxonomy until the newer systematic ideas took hold.

New botanical laboratories were added west of the Beyer building in 1911, including a physiological laboratory, and remained in use until the 1970s, when the Department was transferred to the Williamson building.

In the 1930s research interests were developed in horticulture, assisted by funds from the [[Royal Botanical Society of Manchester]]. A plant geneticist F. W. Sansome (1902–1981) was appointed as lecturer in horticulture in 1935, and land was acquired at [[Jodrell Bank]] in  Cheshire for experimental research in horticulture. This was later used as the site of the famous [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] and [[Lovell Telescope]].

On the formation of the new School of Biological Sciences fourteen members of the Department of Botany joined the new division of cell and structural biology, and six became part of environmental biology.

The named chairs on botany included:

Harrison Professors of Botany:
* William Crawford Williamson 1851–1892 (originally as professor of natural history)
* Frederick Ernest Weiss 1892–1930
* James Montagu Frank Drummond 1930–1946
* [[Eric Ashby]] 1946–1950
* S. C. Harland 1950–1958
* [[Claude Wardlaw]] 1958–1966
* [[David Henriques Valentine]] 1966–1979
* Elizabeth Cutter 1979–1989

Barker Professors of Cryptogamic Botany:
* William Henry Lang 1909–1940
* Claude Wilson Wardlaw 1940–1958
* John Colhoun 1960–1980
* Anthony Peter Joseph Trinci 1981–2001

In addition to the trend to a less compartmentalised approach to biology the government in the 1980s was cutting spending on universities but trying to preserve engineering and medicine.<ref>{{Citation

While Physiology and Anatomy fared best they were only rated as 'Average'.  Biochemistry, Botany, and Zoology were all 'Below Average', the lowest rank attributable.  Biological science in Manchester not only ranked well below Cambridge, Oxford and the London Colleges but was also worse than its civic university competitors such as Liverpool and Leeds and as well as many newer universities such as Reading, Southampton, Swansea and Leicester.

A new School of Biological Sciences was created in 1986 with four new departments: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cell and Structural Biology, Physiological Sciences, and Environmental Biology. In 1993 the departments were combined to create a single department school. Concentration on the application of molecular biology techniques to address biological research issues led to a marked improvement in the levels achieved in research and, by extension, teaching as measured by external assessment. This was also reflected in a marked increase in funding  from research councils and charities and in the higher profile life sciences gained within the university.<ref>Wilson, D (2008) ''Reconfiguring Biological Sciences in the Late Twentieth Century: a Study of the University of Manchester.''

===Department of Biomolecular Sciences (UMIST, 1959–2004)===

[[File:Umist-logo.png|thumb|right|UMIST logo]]
Known by a number of names during its lifespan, the department was formed as the Department of Biochemistry, under Professor [[Alfred Alan Eddy|Alan Eddy]], in 1959. It was created from the previously-existing Brewing Chemistry department. In the early 1980s the then novel discipline of [[molecular biology]] was introduced with the appointment of Paul Broda to a chair in this field, the department subsequently being known as Biochemistry and Applied Molecular Biology (BAMBi). The department was particularly strong in the molecular biology of [[yeast]], under the direction of [[Stephen Oliver (scientist)|Stephen Oliver]].<ref>Wilson, pp. 16, 26</ref> In 1992 the Oliver group co-ordinated the production of the first complete [[DNA]] sequence of an entire [[chromosome]], chromosome III of the yeast ''S. cerevisiae''.<ref>Oliver, S. G.; Van Der Aart, Q. J. M.; Agostoni-Carbone, M. L.; Aigle, M.; Alberghina, L.; Alexandraki, D.; Antoine, G.; Anwar, R. et al. (1992). "The complete DNA sequence of yeast chromosome III". Nature 357 (6373): 38–46.</ref> 

The prominence of molecular biology approaches and industrial relevance at UMIST acted to some extent as a paradigm for the reorganisation of biological sciences which took place in the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s at the Victoria University of Manchester; however, medical rather than industrial relevance was to take a more prominent role at the latter institution.<ref>Wilson, pp.&nbsp;27–28</ref> Some medically relevant research was also carried out in the UMIST department, which had a [[leukaemia]] research unit and a group working on the molecular biology of [[malaria]] parasites.   

During the 1990s biological sciences saw considerable expansion within UMIST, including the creation of new professorial chairs and the appointment of a considerable number of new lecturers. The disciplines of biotechnology and structural biology were especially prominent in the research interests of the new appointments. In this period the name of the department changed, once again, to 'Biomolecular Sciences' (BMS). The research strengths within the Life Sciences at UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester had relatively limited overlap, and were to a degree complementary, when the merger of the two universities took place in 2004.<ref>Wilson, p. 104</ref>
