A '''sebaceous cyst''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|ɪ|ˈ|b|eɪ|ʃ|ə|s|_|s|ɪ|s|t}}) is a term that loosely refers to either [[epidermoid cyst]]s (also known as epidermal cysts; [[ICD-10 Chapter XII: Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue|L72.0]]) or [[pilar cyst]]s (also known as trichilemmal cysts; [[ICD-10 Chapter XII: Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue|L72.1]]). Because an epidermoid cyst originates in the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and a [[Trichilemmal cyst|pilar cyst]] originates from [[hair follicle]]s, by definition, neither type of [[cyst]] is strictly a sebaceous cyst.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/epidermoid-and-pilar-cysts-sebaceous-cysts |title=Epidermoid and Pilar Cysts (Sebaceous Cysts) - Patient UK |accessdate=2013-03-04 |work=}}</ref> The name is regarded as a misnomer as the fatty, white, semi-solid material in both of these [[cyst]] entities is not [[Sebaceous gland#Sebum|sebum]], but [[keratin]]. Furthermore, under the microscope neither entity contains [[sebaceous gland]]s. In practice, however, the terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bad.org.uk/site/805/default.aspx|title=Cysts - Epidermoid and Pilar - British Association of Dermatologists |accessdate=2011-07-04 |date = November 2010|work=}}</ref>

"True" sebaceous cysts are relatively rare and are known as [[steatocystoma simplex|steatocystomas]] or, if multiple, as [[steatocystoma multiplex]].

==Presentation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
[[Image:Sebaceous cyst.jpg|thumb|Close-up of an infected sebaceous cyst that has abscessed, located behind the ear lobe.]]
The [[scalp]], [[ear]]s, [[back]], [[face]], and [[upper arm]], are common sites for sebaceous cysts, though they may occur anywhere on the body except the palms of the [[hand]]s and [[Sole (foot)|soles]] of the feet. In males a common place for them to develop is the [[scrotum]] and [[chest]]. They are more common in hairier areas, where in cases of long duration they could result in [[hair loss]] on the skin surface immediately above the cyst. They are smooth to the touch, vary in size, and are generally round in shape.

They are generally mobile masses that can consist of:
* [[Fibrous tissues]] and fluids,
* A fatty ([[keratinous]]) substance that resembles [[cottage cheese]], in which case the cyst may be called "keratin cyst" This material has a characteristic "cheesy" or "foot odor" smell,
* A somewhat viscous, serosanguineous fluid (containing [[purulent]] and bloody material).

The nature of the contents of a sebaceous cyst, and of its surrounding capsule, will be determined by whether the cyst has ever been infected.

With surgery, a cyst can usually be excised in its entirety.  Poor surgical technique or previous infection leading to scarring and tethering of the cyst to the surrounding tissue may lead to rupture during excision and removal. A completely removed cyst will not recur, though if the patient has a predisposition to cyst formation, further cysts may develop in the same general area.

==Causes==
Blocked [[sebaceous gland]]s, swollen [[hair follicle]]s,<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000842|Sebaceous cyst}}</ref> and excessive [[testosterone]] production will cause such cysts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zuber TJ |title=Minimal excision technique for epidermoid (sebaceous) cysts |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=65 |issue=7 |pages=1409–12, 1417–8, 1420 |year=2002 |pmid=11996426 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020401/1409.html}}</ref>

A case has been reported of sebaceous cyst being caused by [[Dermatobia hominis]].<ref name="pmid12354816">{{cite journal |author=Harbin LJ, Khan M, Thompson EM, Goldin RD |title=A sebaceous cyst with a difference: Dermatobia hominis |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=798–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12354816 |doi=10.1136/jcp.55.10.798 |pmc=1769786}}</ref>

Hereditary causes of sebaceous cysts include [[Gardner's syndrome]] and [[basal cell nevus syndrome]].

==Treatment==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
Sebaceous cysts generally do not require medical treatment. However, if they continue to grow, they may become unsightly, painful, infected, or all of the above.

===Surgical===
[[surgery|Surgical]] excision of a sebaceous cyst is a simple procedure to completely remove the sac and its contents.<ref name="pmid2349906">{{cite journal |author=Klin B, Ashkenazi H |title=Sebaceous cyst excision with minimal surgery |journal=American Family Physician |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1746–8 |year=1990 |pmid=2349906 |doi=}}</ref>

[[File:Sebaceous Cyst.jpg|thumb|A surgically removed sebaceous cyst. |thumbnail|A sebaceous cyst that has been surgically removed.]]

There are three general approaches used: traditional wide excision, minimal excision, and punch biopsy excision.<ref name="pmid17403333">{{cite journal |author=Moore RB, Fagan EB, Hulkower S, Skolnik DC, O'Sullivan G |title=Clinical inquiries. What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts? |journal=The Journal of family practice |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=315–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17403333 |doi=}}</ref>

The typical outpatient surgical procedure for cyst removal is to numb the area around the cyst with a [[local anaesthetic]], then to use a [[scalpel]] to open the lesion with either a single cut down the center of the swelling, or an oval cut on both sides of the centerpoint. If the cyst is small, it may be [[lanced]] instead. The person performing the surgery will squeeze out the [[keratin]] surrounding the cyst, then use blunt-headed scissors or another instrument to hold the incision wide open while using fingers or forceps to try to remove the cyst intact. If the cyst can be removed in one piece, the "cure rate" is 100%.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} If, however, it is fragmented and cannot be entirely recovered, the operator may use [[curettage]] (scraping) to remove the remaining exposed fragments, then burn them with an [[cauterization|electro-cauterization]] tool, in an effort to destroy them in place. In such cases the cyst may recur. In either case, the incision is then [[disinfected]] and, if necessary, the skin is stitched back together over it. A [[scar]] will most likely result.
In some cases where "cure rate" is not 100% the resulting hole is filled with an antiseptic ribbon after washing it with an iodine based solution. This is then covered with a field dressing. The ribbon and the dressing are to be changed once or twice daily for 7–10 days after which the incision is sewn up or allowed to close by secondary intention, i.e. by forming granulation tissue and healing "from the bottom up."

An infected cyst may require oral [[antibiotic]]s or other treatment before or after excision.

An approach involving incision, rather than excision, has also been proposed.<ref name="pmid11322399">{{cite journal |author=Nakamura M |title=Treating a sebaceous cyst: an incisional technique |journal=Aesthetic plastic surgery |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=52–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11322399 |doi=10.1007/s002660010095}}</ref>

===Non-surgical===
Another method of treatment involves placement of a [[heating pad]] directly on the cyst for about fifteen minutes, twice daily, for about 10 days (depending on size and location of the cyst) to promote drainage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.yahoo.net/adamcontent/sebaceous-cyst |title=Sebaceous Cyst - Yahoo!
