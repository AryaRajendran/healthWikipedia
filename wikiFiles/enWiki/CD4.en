In [[molecular biology]], '''CD4''' ([[cluster of differentiation]] 4) is a [[glycoprotein]] found on the surface of immune cells such as [[T helper cell]]s, [[monocytes]], [[macrophages]], and [[dendritic cells]]. It was discovered in the late 1970s and was originally known as leu-3 and T4 (after the OKT4 [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] that reacted with it) before being named CD4 in 1984.<ref name="isbn0-387-12056-4">{{cite book | author = Alain Bernard | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Leucocyte typing: human leucocyte differentiation antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies: specification, classification, nomenclature: [report on the first international references workshop sponsored by INSERM, WHO and IUIS]  | edition = | language = | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 1984 | origyear = | pages = pages 45–48 | quote = | isbn = 0-387-12056-4 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> In humans, the CD4 protein is encoded by the ''CD4'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid3086883">{{cite journal | author = Isobe M, Huebner K, Maddon PJ, Littman DR, Axel R, Croce CM | title = The gene encoding the T-cell surface protein T4 is located on human chromosome 12 | journal = Proc.

CD4+ T helper cells are [[leukocytes|white blood cells]] that are an essential part of the human immune system. They are often referred to as CD4 cells, T-helper cells or T4 cells. They are called helper cells because one of their main roles is to send signals to other types of immune cells, including CD8 killer cells. CD4 cells send the signal and CD8 cells destroy and kill the infection or virus. If CD4 cells become depleted, for example in untreated HIV infection, or following immune suppression prior to a transplant, the body is left vulnerable to a wide range of infections that it would otherwise have been able to fight.

==Structure==
[[File:CD4 receptor.png|left|thumb|Schematic representation of CD4 [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].]]
Like many cell surface receptors/markers, CD4 is a member of the [[immunoglobulin superfamily]].  

It has four immunoglobulin domains (D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>4</sub>) that are exposed on the extracellular surface of the cell:
* D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> resemble [[immunoglobulin]] variable (IgV) domains.
* D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> resemble immunoglobulin constant (IgC) domains.

CD4 uses its D<sub>1</sub> domain to interact with the β<sub>2</sub>-domain of MHC class II molecules.  T cells expressing CD4 molecules (and not [[CD8]]) on their surface, therefore, are specific for antigens presented by MHC II and not by [[MHC class I]] (they are ''MHC class II-restricted''). 

The short [[cytoplasmic]]/[[intracellular]] tail (C) of CD4 contains a special sequence of [[amino acids]] that allow it to interact with the [[lck]] molecule.

== Function ==
CD4 is a [[co-receptor]] that assists the [[T cell receptor]] (TCR) in communicating with an [[antigen-presenting cell]]. Using its intracelluar domain, CD4 amplifies the signal generated by the TCR by recruiting an [[enzyme]], the [[tyrosine kinase]] [[Lck]], which is essential for activating many molecular components of the signaling cascade of an activated T cell.  CD4 also interacts directly with [[MHC class II]] molecules on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell using its [[extracellular]] domain. The extracellular domain adopts an immunoglobulin-like [[beta-sandwich]] with seven strands in 2 beta sheets, in a [[Greek_key_motif#Greek__motif|Greek key topology]].<ref name="pmid8493535">{{cite journal | author = Brady RL, Dodson EJ, Dodson GG, Lange G, Davis SJ, Williams AF, Barclay AN | title = Crystal structure of domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4: relation to the NH2-terminal domains | journal = Science | volume = 260 | issue = 5110 | pages = 979–83 | year = 1993 | month = May | pmid = 8493535 | doi = 10.1126/science.8493535| url = }}</ref>

== Disease ==
=== HIV infection ===

[[HIV-1]] uses CD4 to gain entry into host T-cells and achieves this by binding to the [[viral envelope]] protein known as [[gp120]].<ref name="pmid9641677">{{cite journal | author = Kwong PD, Wyatt R, Robinson J, Sweet RW, Sodroski J, Hendrickson WA | title = Structure of an HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein in complex with the CD4 receptor and a neutralizing human antibody | journal = Nature | volume = 393 | issue = 6686 | pages = 648–59 | year = 1998 | month = June | pmid = 9641677 | doi = 10.1038/31405 }}</ref> The binding to CD4 creates a shift in the conformation of gp120 allowing HIV-1 to bind to a co-receptor expressed on the host cell. These co-receptors are [[chemokine receptors]] [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]]. Following a structural change in another viral protein ([[gp41]]), HIV inserts a [[fusion peptide]] into the host cell that allows the outer membrane of the virus to fuse with the [[cell membrane]].

=== HIV pathology ===
HIV infection leads to a progressive reduction in the number of [[T helper cells|T cells expressing CD4]]. Medical professionals refer to the CD4 count to decide when to begin treatment during HIV infection. Normal [[blood values]] are usually expressed as the number of cells per microliter (or cubic millimeter, mm<sup>3</sup>) of blood, with normal values for CD4 cells being 500-1200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.<ref name="pmid1349272">{{cite journal | author = Bofill M, Janossy G, Lee CA, MacDonald-Burns D, Phillips AN, Sabin C, Timms A, Johnson MA, Kernoff PB | title = Laboratory control values for CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes.

Immunol. | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 243–52 | year = 1992 | month = May | pmid = 1349272 | pmc = 1554313 | doi = | url = }}</ref> A CD4 count measures the number of T cells expressing CD4. While CD4 counts are not a direct [[HIV]] test--e.g. they do not check the presence of viral DNA, or specific antibodies against HIV--they are used to assess the immune system of a patient. Patients often undergo treatments when the CD4 counts reach a level of 350 cells per microliter; less than 200 cells per microliter in an HIV-positive individual is diagnosed as [[AIDS]]. Medical professionals also refer to CD4 tests to determine efficacy of treatment.

=== Other diseases ===

CD4 continues to be expressed in most [[neoplasm]]s derived from T helper cells. It is therefore possible to use CD4 [[immunohistochemistry]] on tissue [[biopsy]] samples to identify most forms of peripheral T cell [[lymphoma]] and related malignant conditions.<ref name="isbn1-84110-100-1">{{cite book | author = Kumarasen Cooper; Anthony S-Y.
