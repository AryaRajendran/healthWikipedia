'''Joseph Souberbielle''' (18 March 1754, [[Pontacq]] &ndash; 10 July 1846, [[Paris]]) was a French [[surgeon]]. He was a relative of Jean Baseilhac (1703-1781), a surgeon who was a major influence to Souberbielle's career.

He moved to Paris in 1774, where he was student of [[Pierre-Joseph Desault]] (1738-1795). Afterwards, he worked as a military physician, subsequently serving as chief surgeon for the victors of the [[Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] (1789). In 1793 he was a juror of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. 

Known for his work in [[lithotomy]], especially using the [[suprapubic]] method. It is believed that he performed over 1200 suprapubic operations for removal of [[calculus (medicine)|calculi]] during his career.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=IhpfDudu8mIC&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=%22Joseph+Souberbielle%22+1754&source=bl&ots=n9RXj1PYJ5&sig=uoAywygW0njz4HVsfYzZaUF0alw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=il98UeDcGaqLiwKG74DADw&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22Joseph%20Souberbielle%22%201754&f=false  System of surgery, Volume 1] by Frederic Shepard Dennis, John Shaw</ref> As did Jean Baseilhac, he advocated use of a caustic paste containing [[arsenic]] for cauterization of cancers.
