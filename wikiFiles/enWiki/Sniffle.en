Sniffling is the reflex action of inhaling quickly to prevent mucus from flowing from one's nose, as an alternative to blowing the nose. 

==Physiology==

For a fraction of a second the performer [[inhale]]s strongly, pulling [[mucus]] from the outer part of the nasal cavity higher up, even into the [[sinus]]. This action is generally repeated every few seconds or minutes.

Sniffling and [[runny nose]] need not come associated with [[sneeze|sneezing]] or [[cough]]ing. 

Sniffling is not necessarily related to illness.<ref>http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20436993,00.html</ref> In addition to allergies and colds, it can be a result of being in cold temperatures, and a way to hold back tears.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sniffle</ref>

Reducing the need to sniffle generally involves reducing the mucus-causing symptoms, i.e. through [[antihistamines]] or [[decongestants]]. More immediate relief is had by either [[nasal irrigation]] or blowing the nose into a [[facial tissue]] or [[handkerchief]].

==Psychology==

Many people are unconscious of their sniffling, hence the stereotype of children as more apt to sniffle, since they are less conscious of stigma. The sharp high pitched noise of a sniffle can easily become both inaudible to the performer, who experiences it as a relief, and irritating to those around the sniffler.<ref>http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-noise-anxiety.htm</ref>

==Sociology==

In many cultures blowing one's nose in public is considered impolite, and in reaction, people can make a habit of sniffling, even if sniffling is equally or more impolite.

"The sniffles" can also refer by [[metonymy]] to the [[common cold]], though colds often do not result in sniffles, and sniffles often are not caused by colds.
