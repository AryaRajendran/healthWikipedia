'''Telogen effluvium''' is a scalp disorder characterized by the thinning or shedding of hair resulting from the early entry of [[hair]] in the [[telogen phase]] (the resting phase of the hair follicle).<ref name="Lookingbill">Marks, James G; Miller, Jeffery (2006).

''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref> Emotional or physiological stress may result in an alteration of the normal [[hair cycle]] and cause the disorder, with potential etiologies including [[eating disorder]]s, [[fever]], [[childbirth]], [[chronic illness]], major [[surgery]], [[anemia]], severe [[emotional disorder]]s, [[crash diet]]s, [[hypothyroidism]], and [[drug]]s.<ref name="Lookingbill" /><ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al.

Diagnostic tests, which may be performed to verify the diagnosis, include a trichogram, [[trichoscopy]]<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Rudnicka L, Olszewska M, Rakowska A, Kowalska-Oledzka E, Slowinska M. |title= Trichoscopy: a new method for diagnosing hair loss |journal= J Drugs Dermatol |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=651â€“654 |year=2008 |pmid=18664157 | }}</ref> and biopsy.<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al.
