'''Arthritis mutilans''', is a rare [[arthropathy]] originally described as affecting the hands, feet, fingers, and/or toes, but refers in general to severe derangement of any joint <ref name="Nielsen">Nielsen, Børge, and Egill Snorrason.

In the hands, it is also known as '''opera glass hand''' (''la main en lorgnette''), or '''chronic absorptive arthritis''', first described in modern medical literature by Marie and Leri in 1913.<ref name="Nelson">Nelson, L.

==Etiology==
Arthritis mutilans occurs mainly in patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]], but can occur independently.<ref name="Froimson" /><ref name="Eisenstadt"/>

==Symptoms==
In Arthritis mutilans, a patient's fingers become shortened by [[arthritis]], and the shortening may become severe enough that that the hand looks paw-like, with the first deformity occurring at the [[interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal]] and [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s. The excess skin from the shortening of the [[phalanx bone]]s becomes folded transversely, as if retracted into one another like [[opera glasses]], hence the description ''la main en lorgnette''. As the condition worsens, [[Joint dislocation|luxation]], phalangeal and [[metacarpus|metacarpal]] bone absorption, and skeletal architecture loss in the fingers occurs.<ref name="Froimson" />

==Treatment==
Although a 2011 research article stated that disagreements between hand surgeons and rheumatologists remain regarding the indications, timing and effectiveness of rheumatoid hand surgery,<ref name="pmid21463736">Chung, Kevin C., and Pushman, Allison G., Current Concepts in the Management of the Rheumatoid Hand, ''Journal of Hand Surgery'', April 2011, 36(4):736–747. PMID 21463736. {{doi|10.1016/j.jhsa.2011.01.019}}. Accessed 2012-6-7.</ref> Arthritis mutilans may be successfully treated by [[Ilium (bone)|iliac]]-[[bone grafting|bone graft]] and [[arthrodesis]] of the interphalangeal joints and the metacarpophalangeal joint in each finger.<ref name="Froimson" /><ref name="pmid14783359">Nalebuff, E.A., Garrett J., Opera-glass hand in rheumatoid arthritis, ''Journal of Hand Surgery'', November 1976, 1(3):210-20, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
