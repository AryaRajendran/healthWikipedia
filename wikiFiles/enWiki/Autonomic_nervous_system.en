The '''autonomic nervous system''' ('''ANS''' or '''visceral nervous system''' or '''involuntary nervous system''') is the part of the [[peripheral nervous system]] that acts as a [[control system]], functioning largely below the level of [[consciousness]], and controls [[viscera]]l functions.<ref name="Dorlands">{{DorlandsDict|nine/000950637|autonomic nervous system}}</ref> The ANS affects [[heart rate]], [[digestion]], [[respiratory rate]], [[salivation]], [[perspiration]], [[pupillary dilation]], [[micturition]] (urination), and [[sexual arousal]]. Most autonomous functions are involuntary but a number of ANS actions can work alongside some degree of [[conscious control]]. Everyday examples include breathing, swallowing, and sexual arousal, and [[biofeedback|in some cases]] functions such as [[heart rate]].

Within the [[brain]], the ANS is located in the [[medulla oblongata]] in the [[brainstem|lower brainstem]]. The medulla's major ANS functions include [[Breathing|respiration]] (the [[control of respiration|respiratory control centre]], or "rcc"), [[heart|cardiac regulation]] (the cardiac control centre, or "ccc"), [[vasomotor]] activity (the [[vasomotor centre]] or "vmc"), and certain [[reflex|reflex actions]] (such as [[coughing]], [[sneezing]], [[vomiting]] and [[swallowing]]). These then subdivide into other areas and are also linked to ANS subsystems and [[nervous system]]s external to the brain. The [[hypothalamus]], just above the brain stem, acts as an integrator for autonomic functions, receiving ANS [[regulatory]] input from the [[limbic system]] to do so.<ref name="MacArthur">[http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/research/allostatic/parasym.php Allostatic load notebook: Parasympathetic Function] - 1999, MacArthur research network, [[UCSF]]</ref>

In many cases the two have "opposite" actions where one activates a physiological response and the other inhibits it. An older simplification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems as "excitory" and "inhibitory" was overturned due to the many exceptions found. A more modern characterisation is that the sympathetic nervous system is a "quick response mobilising system" and the parasympathetic is a "more slowly activated [[dampening]] system", but even this has exceptions, such as in [[sexual arousal]] and [[orgasm]] where both play a role.<ref name="MacArthur" /> The [[enteric nervous system]] is also sometimes considered part of the autonomic nervous system,<ref name="MacArthur" /> and sometimes considered an independent system.

ANS functions can generally be divided into sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) subsystems. Within both there are [[inhibitory]] and [[excitatory]] [[synapses]] between neurons. Relatively recently, a third subsystem of neurons that have been named 'non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic' neurons (because they use nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter) have been described and found to be integral in autonomic function, particularly in the gut and the lungs.<ref name="Belvisi">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001429999290676U |title=Nitric oxide is the endogenous neurotransmitter of bronchodilator nerves in humans Maria G.

==Anatomy==
ANS innervation is divided into [[sympathetic nervous system]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system]] divisions.  The sympathetic division has thoracolumbar “outflow”, meaning that the neurons begin at the thoracic and lumbar (T1-L2/3) portions of the spinal cord.  The parasympathetic division has craniosacral “outflow”, meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves (CN 3, CN7, CN 9, CN10) and sacral (S2-S4) spinal cord.

The ANS is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ.  The preganglionic, or first, neuron will begin at the “outflow” and will synapse at the postganglionic, or second, neuron’s cell body.  The postganglionic neuron will then synapse at the target organ.

===Sympathetic division===
The sympathetic division (thoracolumbar outflow) consists of cell bodies in the [[lateral horn of spinal cord|lateral horn of the spinal cord]] (intermediolateral cell columns) from T1 to L2/3.  These cell bodies are GVE (general visceral efferent) neurons and are the preganglionic neurons.  There are several locations upon which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons:
* [[Paravertebral ganglia]] (3) of the sympathetic chain (these run on either side of the vertebral bodies)
# [[cervical ganglia]] (3)
# [[thoracic ganglia]] (12) and rostral [[lumbar ganglia]] (2 or 3)
#  caudal lumbar ganglia and [[sacral ganglia|pelvic ganglia]]
* [[Prevertebral ganglia]] (celiac ganglion, aorticorenal ganglion, superior mesenteric ganglion, inferior mesenteric ganglion)
* [[Chromaffin cells]] of the [[adrenal medulla]] (this is the one exception to the two-neuron pathway rule: the synapse is directly efferent onto the target cell bodies)
These ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervation of target organs follows.  Examples of splanchnic (visceral) nerves are:
* Cervical cardiac nerves & thoracic visceral nerves which synapse in the sympathetic chain
* Thoracic splanchnic nerves (greater, lesser, least) which synapse in the prevertebral ganglion
* Lumbar splanchnic nerves which synapse in the prevertebral ganglion
* Sacral splanchnic nerves which synapse in the inferior hypogastric plexus
These all contain afferent (sensory) nerves as well, known as GVA (general visceral afferent) neurons.

===Parasympathetic division===
The parasympathetic division (craniosacral outflow) consists of cell bodies from one of two locations: the [[brainstem]] (Cranial Nerves III, VII, IX, X) or the sacral spinal cord (S2, S3, S4).  These are the preganglionic neurons, which synapse with postganglionic neurons in these locations:
* [[Parasympathetic ganglia]] of the head (Ciliary (CN III), Submandibular (CN VII), Pterygopalatine (CN VII), or Otic (CN IX) nerves)
* In or near the wall of an organ innervated by the Vagus (CN X) or Sacral nerves (S2, S3, S4))
These ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervations of target organs follows.  Examples are:
* The preganglionic parasympathetic splanchnic (visceral) nerves
* The [[Vagus nerve|Vagus Nerve]], which wanders through the thorax and abdominal regions innervating, among other organs, the heart, lungs, liver and stomach

===Sensory neurons===
{{Main|Sensory neuron}}
The sensory arm is made of “primary visceral sensory neurons” found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), in “cranial sensory ganglia”: the geniculate, petrosal and nodose ganglia, appended respectively to cranial nerves VII, IX and X. These sensory neurons monitor the levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and sugar in the blood, arterial pressure and the chemical composition of the stomach and gut content. They also convey the sense of taste and smell which, unlike most functions of the ANS, is a conscious perception. Blood oxygen and carbon dioxide are in fact directly sensed by the carotid body, a small collection of chemosensors at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, innervated by the petrosal (IXth) ganglion.
Primary sensory neurons project (synapse) onto “second order” or relay visceral sensory neurons located in the medulla oblongata, forming the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), that integrates all visceral information. The nTS also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center, the area postrema, that detects toxins in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and is essential for chemically induced vomiting or conditional taste aversion (the memory that ensures that an animal which has been poisoned by a food never touches it again). All this visceral sensory information constantly and unconsciously modulates the activity of the motor neurons of the ANS.

===Motor neurons===
{{Main|Motor neuron}}
Motor neurons of the ANS are also located in ganglia of the PNS, called “autonomic ganglia.” They belong to three categories with different effects on their target organs (see below “Function”): sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric.

Sympathetic ganglia are located in two sympathetic chains close to the spinal cord: the prevertebral and pre-aortic chains.
Parasympathetic ganglia, in contrast, are located in close proximity to the target organ: the [[submandibular ganglion]] close to salivary glands, paracardiac ganglia close to the heart, etc.
Enteric ganglia, which as their name implies innervate the digestive tube, are located inside its walls and collectively contain as many neurons as the entire spinal cord, including local sensory neurons, motor neurons and interneurons. It is the only truly autonomous part of the ANS and the digestive tube can function surprisingly well even in isolation. For that reason the [[enteric nervous system]] has been called “the second brain.”

The activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “preganglionic neurons” (also called, improperly but classically, "visceral motoneurons") located in the [[central nervous system]]. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons are in the spinal cord, at thoraco-lumbar levels. Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are in the medulla oblongata (forming visceral motor nuclei: the [[dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve]] (dmnX), the [[nucleus ambiguus]], and the salivatory nuclei), and in the sacral spinal cord. Enteric neurons are also modulated by input from the CNS and from preganglionic neurons located, like parasympathetic ones, in the medulla oblongata (in the dmnX).

The feedback from the sensory to the motor arm of visceral reflex pathways is provided by direct or indirect connections between the nucleus of the solitary tract and the visceral motor neurons.

==Function==
Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to each other. But this opposition is better termed complementary in nature rather than antagonistic. For an analogy, one may think of the sympathetic division as the accelerator and the parasympathetic division as the brake. The sympathetic division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses. The parasympathetic division functions with actions that do not require immediate reaction. The sympathetic system is often considered the "[[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]" system, while the parasympathetic system is often considered the "rest and digest" or "feed and breed" system.

However, many instances of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity cannot be ascribed to "fight" or "rest" situations. For example, standing up from a reclining or sitting position would entail an unsustainable drop in blood pressure if not for a compensatory increase in the arterial sympathetic tonus. Another example is the constant, second to second, modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, as a function of the respiratory cycles. More generally, these two systems should be seen as permanently modulating vital functions, in usually antagonistic fashion, to achieve homeostasis. Some typical actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are listed below.

===Sympathetic nervous system===
{{Main|Sympathetic nervous system}}
Promotes a "[[fight or flight response|fight or flight]]" response, corresponds with arousal and energy generation, and inhibits digestion.

* Diverts blood flow away from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and [[skin]] via vasoconstriction.
*  Blood flow to [[skeletal muscle]]s and the [[lung]]s is enhanced (by as much as 1200% in the case of skeletal muscles).
* Dilates bronchioles of the lung, which allows for greater alveolar oxygen exchange.
* Increases [[heart rate]] and the [[contractility]] of cardiac cells ([[myocytes]]), thereby providing a mechanism for enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles.
* Dilates pupils and relaxes the ciliary muscle to the lens, allowing more light to enter the eye and far vision.
* Provides vasodilation for the [[coronary vessels]] of the [[heart]].
* Constricts all the intestinal [[sphincters]] and the urinary sphincter.
* Inhibits [[peristalsis]].
* Stimulates [[orgasm]].

===Parasympathetic nervous system===
{{Main|Parasympathetic nervous system}}
Promotes a "rest and digest" response, promotes calming of the nerves return to regular function, and enhances digestion.

* The parasympathetic nerves dilate blood vessels leading to the GI tract, increasing blood flow. This is important following the consumption of food, due to the greater metabolic demands placed on the body by the gut.
* The parasympathetic nervous system can also constrict the bronchiolar diameter when the need for oxygen has diminished.
* Dedicated cardiac branches of the [[Vagus]] and thoracic [[Accessory nerve|Spinal Accessory]] nerves impart [[Parasympathetic]] control of the [[Heart]] or [[Myocardium]].
* During [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]], the parasympathetic nervous system causes constriction of the pupil and contraction of the ciliary muscle to the lens, allowing for closer vision.
* The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates salivary gland secretion, and accelerates [[peristalsis]], so, in keeping with the rest and digest functions, appropriate PNS activity mediates digestion of food and indirectly, the absorption of nutrients.
* The PNS is also involved in the erection of genital tissues, via the [[pelvic splanchnic nerves]] 2–4.
* The PNS is responsible for stimulating sexual arousal.

==Neurotransmitters and pharmacology==
At the effector organs, sympathetic ganglionic neurons release [[noradrenaline]] (norepinephrine), along with other [[cotransmitters]] such as [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to act on [[adrenergic receptors]], with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla:

* [[Acetylcholine]] is the preganglionic neurotransmitter for both divisions of the ANS, as well as the postganglionic neurotransmitter of parasympathetic neurons. Nerves that release acetylcholine are said to be cholinergic. In the parasympathetic system, ganglionic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter to stimulate muscarinic receptors.
* At the [[adrenal medulla]], there is no postsynaptic neuron. Instead the presynaptic neuron releases acetylcholine to act on [[nicotinic receptors]]. Stimulation of the adrenal medulla releases [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine) into the bloodstream which acts on adrenoceptors, producing a widespread increase in sympathetic activity.

The following table reviews the actions of these neurotransmitters as a function of their receptors.
