The '''sebaceous glands''' are microscopic [[gland]]s in the [[skin]] that secrete an oily/waxy matter, called '''sebum''', to lubricate and waterproof the skin and [[hair]] of [[mammals]].<ref name="JACE">

In the eyelids, [[meibomian gland|meibomian]] sebaceous glands secrete a special type of sebum into tears. There are several related medical conditions, including [[acne]], [[sebaceous cyst]]s, [[sebaceous hyperplasia|hyperplasia]], [[sebaceous adenoma]] and [[sebaceous gland carcinoma]] (see section below: ''[[#Pathology|Pathology]]'').

==Locations and morphology==
A branched type of [[acinar gland]], the sebaceous glands exist in humans throughout the skin except in the [[palms of the hands]] and [[Sole (foot)|soles of the feet]]. Sebaceous glands can usually be found in hair-covered areas, where they are connected to [[hair follicle]]s (''see image at top''). The glands deposit sebum on the hairs, and bring it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The structure consisting of hair, hair follicle, [[arrector pili]] muscle, and sebaceous gland is known as a '''pilosebaceous unit'''. Sebaceous glands are also found in non-haired areas (glabrous skin) of [[eyelid]]s, [[human nose|nose]], [[penis]], [[labia minora]] and [[nipple]]s. Here, the sebum traverses ducts that terminate in '''sweat pores''' on the surface of the skin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} At the rim of the eyelids, [[meibomian gland]]s are a specialized form of sebaceous gland. They secrete a form of sebum (called [[meibum]]) onto the [[human eye|eye]], slowing the evaporation of [[tears]].

==Sebum==
Sebaceous glands secrete the oily, waxy substance called ''sebum'' ([[Latin]], meaning ''[[fat]]'' or ''[[tallow]]'') that is made of [[triglyceride]] oils, [[wax esters|wax]], [[squalene]], and metabolytes of fat-producing cells.<ref name="VT">

==Function==
All of the sebaceous glands in humans have been demonstrated to show similarity in structure and secrete sebum by a holocrine process.

===Composition===
The composition of sebum varies across species. In humans, the lipid content is as follows:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cheng JB, Russell DW |title=Mammalian Wax Biosynthesis: II.

==Changes during development==
The sebaceous glands of a human [[fetus]] ''[[in utero]]'' secrete a substance called [[Vernix caseosa]], a "waxy" or "cheesy" white substance coating the skin of newborns.

The activity of the sebaceous glands increases during [[puberty]] because of heightened levels of [[androgen]]s, producing [[smegma]]. In males, sebaceous glands begin to appear predominantly on the [[penis]], on the shaft and around the rim of the penile head during and after puberty. This is however normal, not to be confused with an [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]].
In females, they appear predominantly in the [[labia minora]].

==Pathology==
Sebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] and [[keratosis pilaris]]. In the skin pores, sebum and [[keratin]] can create a hyperkeratotic plug called a "[[comedo (disambiguation)|microcomedone]]". The prescription drug [[isotretinoin]] significantly reduces the amount of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands, and is used to treat acne.

The extreme use (up to 10 times doctor-prescribed amounts) of [[anabolic steroid]]s by [[bodybuilder]]s, for [[Muscular hypertrophy|muscle gain]] can cause acne. The sebaceous gland is stimulated due to some steroids conversion into dihydrotestosterone. This may cause serious acne on the face, neck, chest, back and shoulders.

It is a common misconception that a blocked sebaceous gland is known as a sebaceous cyst.  Cysts that are commonly called sebaceous cysts actually do not involve a sebaceous gland.  Instead, they are collection of keratin and dead keratinocytes which develop within the epidermal skin layer.  These cysts are called Epidermal Cysts.

A condition involving enlarged sebaceous glands is known as [[sebaceous hyperplasia]].

[[Sebaceous gland carcinoma]] is a rare and aggressive form of [[cancer]] involving the sebaceous glands; [[sebaceous adenoma]] is a more benign [[neoplasm]] of the sebaceous glands.

Sebum can also build up around [[Stretching (body piercing)|body piercings]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Playe |first=Stephen J |month=July |year=2002 |title=Infectious Complications of Body Art: Infection is reported in about 1% of tattoos and in up to 45% of piercings, depending on the technique employed, body location, and after care |journal=Emergency Medicine News |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=10–3 |url=http://journals.lww.com/em-news/Citation/2002/07000/Infectious_Complications_of_Body_Art__Infection_is.7.aspx |doi=10.1097/01.EEM.0000334232.52899.06 |doi_brokendate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

==Importance to other animals==
[[Image:Haarbalgmilbe.jpg|thumb|Demodex mite]]

Certain species of [[Demodex mite]]s feed on sebum and are commonly found in the sebaceous glands of mammals, including those of humans.

The [[preputial gland]]s of [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s are large modified sebaceous glands that produce [[pheromone]]s.
