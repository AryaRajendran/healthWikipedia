The '''July effect''', sometimes referred to as the '''July phenomenon''', is a perceived increase in the risk of [[medical error]]s and [[surgical complication]]s that occurs in association with the time of year in which [[medical school]] graduates begin [[Residency (medicine)|residencies]].

A ''[[Journal of General Internal Medicine]]'' study, published in 2010, investigated medical errors from 1979 to 2006 and found that medication errors increased 10% during the month of July at [[teaching hospital]]s, but not in neighboring hospitals.<ref name="Phillips & Barker">{{cite journal |author=Phillips DP, Barker GE |title=A July Spike in Fatal Medication Errors: A Possible Effect of New Medical Residents |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume= 25|issue= 8|pages= 774–779|year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20512532 |doi=10.1007/s11606-010-1356-3 |url= |pmc=2896592}}</ref><ref name=amednews1>[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2010/06/21/prsb0621.htm "New residents linked to July medication errors"], ''amednews'', June 21, 2010, [[American Medical Association]]</ref> Surgical errors did not increase, leading to the hypothesis that medication errors are easier for new personnel to make because they are [[drug prescription|prescribing drugs]] on their own, rather than being cross-checked by others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128321489|accessdate=2010-08-11|date=2010-07-05|title=July: A Deadly Time For Hospitals|author=[[National Public Radio]]}}</ref> The study did not have sufficient data to link the increased errors to new residents, however, and further study would need to be done in order to determine the sources of this increase.<ref name=ABC>[http://abcnews.go.com/WN/WellnessNews/july-month-fatal-hospital-errors-study-finds/story?id=10819652 "The 'July Effect': Worst Month For Fatal Hospital Errors, Study Finds"], ''[[ABC News]]'', June 3, 2010</ref> A criticism of the study suggests that the supervision of new residents and the patient loads at teaching hospitals have improved since 1979 and that the results may be skewed by including much older data.<ref>[http://ktar.com/?nid=6&sid=1305830 "Valley Dr.: Surgery's `July effect' outdated"], ''[[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]]'', June 17, 2010</ref>

Other studies searching for the July effect have found variable evidence of an increased risk, with several studies finding no risk at all.<ref name=amednews1/>
