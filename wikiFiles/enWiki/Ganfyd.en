<!-- Dear Editor, you may wish to update the summary in the [[Online medical wiki encyclopedias]] page as well -->

'''Ganfyd''' is a [[medical]] [[Wiki|wiki community]] and [[List of online encyclopedias#Medicine and surgery|online medical wiki encyclopedia]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ginn S |title=Evidence based mental health and Web 2.0 |journal=Evid Based Mens Health |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=69–72 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20682812 |doi=10.1136/ebmh.13.3.69 |url=}}</ref> created in November 2005 by a group of doctors working in the [[United Kingdom]]. The site has been the subject of academic exposition into emerging methods of disseminating medical information and more specifically, the restricting of editors within an open collaborative wiki environment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moturu|first=Sai T.|coauthors=Liu, Huan; Johnson, William G.|date=2008-08-20|title=Trust Evaluation in Health Information on the World Wide Web|publisher=30th Annual International IEEE EMBS Conference}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=McLean|first=Rick|coauthors=Richards, Brian H; Wardman, Janet I;|date=2007-08-06|title=The effect of Web 2.0 on the future of medical practice and education: Darwikinian evolution or folksonomic revolution?|journal=Medical Journal of Australia|volume=187|issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Barskey|first=Eugene|coauthors=Giustini, Dean|year=2007|title=Introducing Web 2.0: wikis for health librarians|journal=J Can Health Libr Assoc|volume=28|pages=147–150|doi=10.5596/c07-036|issue=4}}</ref> This model has subsequently been copied by other medical wikis such as [[Medpedia]]. In 2010, Paula Younger noted it as a laudable attempt to make medical information freely accessible and authoritative.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1108/09504121011019899|last=Younger|first=Paula|year=2010|title=Beyond Wikipedia: how good a reference source are medical wikis?|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=24|issue=1|pages=7–9}}</ref>

==Authorship==
Only [[registered medical practitioner]]s or persons working under their direction, and a small number of invited non-medical specialists, may edit ganfyd articles, and its [http://ganfyd.org/deeds/commons.html license] specifically prohibits editing by people who are not registered medical practitioners. The intention is to make the articles reliable enough for professional medical use. An audit trail is publicly available for each article.

Registration is by a variety of mechanisms, including a [[General Medical Council|GMC]] Certificate or equivalent.

==History==
Ganfyd is intended to become a large on-line textbook of [[medicine]]. By October 2010 there were over 2000 page hits a day and it had reached 7,000 topic pages with over double that number of pages including stubs and redirects and 449 editors from six countries:
* [[United Kingdom]]
* [[Australia]]
* [[New Zealand]]
* [[Canada]]
* [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]
* [[United States]]

In December 2006, the Ganfyd site was noted as a specific example of a wiki being used as a low cost alternative to commercial point of care tools like UpToDate with the search portal Trip already indexing it.<ref>Dean Giustini, ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1283?ct "How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine"]</ref> This may be the first example of a medical wiki being indexed by an independent medical search engine.

==Meaning==
"''Ganfyd''" is an [[acronym]] meaning "Get a note from your doctor."<ref>{{cite book |author=Thoeny, Peter; Woods, Dan |title=Wikis for dummies |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=68 |isbn=0-470-04399-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> This phrase is known to be used by employers, insurance underwriters, and sports instructors to their respective employees/clients. In some cases, this may be intended to absolve the employer/instructor from liability in the event that the client suffers physical harm.

Some medical practitioners regard this as a cynical use of their time and skill, thus they use the term "ganfyd" [[pejorative]]ly.
