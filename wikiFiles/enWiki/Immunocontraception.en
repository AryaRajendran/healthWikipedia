In the strictest sense '''immunocontraception''' is the use of an animal's [[immune system]] to prevent it from [[fertilisation|fertilizing]] offspring. More generally the field of immunocontraception includes related technologies that prevent [[Implantation (human embryo)|embryonic implantation]].

Typically immunocontraception involves the administration of a [[vaccine]] that induces an [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] [[immune response]] which causes an animal to become temporarily infertile. Contraceptive vaccines have been used in numerous settings for the control of wildlife populations.<ref name="kirkpatrick">{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=JF|coauthors=RO Lyda, KM Frank |title=Contraceptive vaccines for wildlife: a review|journal=Am J Reprod Immunol|year=2011|volume=66|pages=40–50}}</ref> However, experts in the field believe that major innovations are required before immunocontraception can become a practical form of [[contraception]] for human beings.<ref name="mclaughlin">{{cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=EA|coauthors=RJ Aitken|title=Is there a role for immunocontraception?|journal=Mol Cell Endocrinol|year=2011|volume=335|pages=78–88}}</ref>

Thus far immunocontraception has focused on [[mammals]] exclusively. There are several targets in mammalian [[sexual reproduction]] for immune inhibition. They can be organized into three categories.<ref name="editorial">{{cite journal|last=Naz|first=RK|title=Contraceptive vaccines: success, status, and future perspective|journal=Am J Reprod Immunol|year=2011|volume=66|pages=2–4}}</ref>

;Gamete production: Organisms that undergo sexual reproduction must first produce [[gamete]]s, [[Cell (biology)|cells]] which have half the typical number of [[chromosomes]] of the species. Oftentimes immunity that prevents gamete production also inhibits [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s and so has effects similar to [[castration]].<ref name="repro-bloc">{{cite web|title=Repro-Bloc Vaccine Technology|url=http://www.amplicon-vaccine.com/technology.html|publisher=Amplicon Vaccine, LLC|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="improvac">{{cite web|title=Improvac® A better way forward|url=http://www.improvac.co.nz/sites/improvac/en-nz/Pages/betterwayforward.aspx|publisher=Pfizer Animal Health|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>

;Gamete function: After gametes are produced in sexual reproduction, two gametes must combine during fertilization to form a [[zygote]], which again has the full typical number of chromosomes of the species. Methods that target gamete function prevent this fertilization from occurring and are true contraceptives.

;Gamete outcome: Shortly after fertilization a zygote develops into a multicellular [[embryo]] that in turn develops into a larger organism. In [[placental mammals]] this process of [[gestation]] occurs inside the reproductive system of the mother of the embryo. Immunity that targets gamete outcome induces [[abortion]] of an embryo while it is within its mother's reproductive system.<ref name="implantation">{{cite journal|last=Hearn|first=JP|coauthors=AA Gidley-Baird, JK Hodges, PM Summers, GE Webley|title=Embryonic signals during the pre-implantation period in primates|journal=J Reprod Fertil Suppl|year=1988|volume=36|pages=49–58}}</ref><ref name="abortion">{{cite journal|last=Tandon|first=A|coauthors=C Das, BL Jaikhani, GP Talwar|title=Efficacy of antibodies generated by PR-b-hCG-TT to terminate pregnancy in baboons: its reversibility and rescue by medroxyprogesterone acetate|journal=Contraception|year=1981|volume=24|pages=83–95}}</ref>

== Gamete production ==

=== Gonadotropin-releasing hormone ===

The production of gametes is induced in both male and female mammals by the same two hormones: [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH). The production of these in turn is induced by a single releasing hormone, [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH), which has been the focus of most of the research into immunocontraception against gamete production. GnRH is secreted by the [[hypothalamus]] in pulses and travels to the [[anterior pituitary gland]] through a [[portal venous system]]. There it stimulates the production of FSH and LH. FSH and LH travel through the general [[circulatory system]] and stimulate the functioning of the [[gonads]], including the production of gametes and the secretion of [[sex steroid]] hormones.<ref name=pathways>{{cite book|last=Senger|first=P.L.|title=Pathways to Pregnancy & Parturition|year=2012|publisher=Current Conceptions|location=Redmond|isbn=0-9657648-3-4}}</ref> Immunity against GnRH thus lessens FSH and LH production which in turn attenuates gamete production and secondary sexual characteristics.

While GnRH immunity has been known to have contraceptive effects for some time,<ref name="repro-bloc" /> only in the 2000s has it been used to develop several commercial vaccines. Equity® Oestrus Control is a GnRH vaccine marketed for use in non-breeding domestic horses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equity® Oestrus Control Vaccine|url=https://www.pfizeranimalhealth.com.au/products/352/equityreg-oestrus-control-vaccine.aspx|publisher=Pfizer Animal Health|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Repro-Bloc is GnRH vaccine marketed for use in domestic animals in general.<ref name="repro-bloc"/> Improvac® is a GnRH vaccine marketed for use in pigs not as a contraceptive, but as an alternative to physical castration for the control of [[boar taint]].<ref name="improvac" /> Unlike the other products which are marketed for use in domestic animals, GonaCon™ is a GnRH vaccine being developed as an [[United States Department of Agriculture]] initiative for use for control of wildlife, specifically deer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Development of Injectable and Oral Contraceptive Technologies and Their Assessment for Wildlife Population and Disease Management|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/nwrc/research/reproductive_control/gonacon.shtml|publisher=National Wildlife Research Center|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>

== Gamete function ==

The form of sexual reproduction practiced by most placental mammals is [[anisogamy|anisogamous]], requiring two kinds of dissimilar gametes, and [[allogamy|allogamous]], such that each individual only produces one of the two kinds of gametes. The smaller gamete is the [[sperm]] cell and is produced by males of the species. The larger gamete is the [[ovum]] and is produced by females of the species. Under this scheme, fertilization requires two gametes, one from an individual of each sex, in order to occur. Immunocontraception targeting the female gamete has focused on the [[zona pellucida]]. Immunocontraception targeting the male gamete has involved many different [[antigen]]s associated with sperm function.<ref name="editorial" />

=== Zona pellucida ===

The zona pellucida is a [[glycoprotein]] membrane surrounding the [[plasma membrane]] of an ovum. The zona pellucida's main function in reproduction is to bind sperm.<ref name="pathways" /> Immunity against zonae pellucidae causes an animal to produce [[antibody|antibodies]] that themselves are bound by a zona pellucida. Thus when a sperm encounters an ovum in an animal immunized against zonae pellucidae, the sperm cannot bind to the ovum because its zona pellucida has already been occupied by antibodies. Therefore fertilization does not occur.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sacco|first=AG|coauthors=MG Subramanian, EC Yurewicz|title=Association of sperm receptor activity with a purified pig zonaantigen (PPZA)|journal=J Reprod Immunol |year=1984|volume=6|issue=2|pages=89–103}}</ref>

==== Early research ====

Work begun by researchers at the [[University of Tennessee]] in the 1970s into immunity against zonae pellucidae resulted in its identification as a target antigen for immunocontraception. The zona pellucida's suitability is a result of it being necessary for fertilization and containing at least one antigen that is tissue-specific and not species-specific. The tissue-specificity implies that immunity against zonae pellucidae will not also affect other tissues in the immunized animal's body. The lack of species-specificity implies that zonae pellucidae harvested from animals of one species will induce an immune response in those of another, which makes zona pellucida antigens readily available, since zonae pellucidae can be harvested from [[livestock|farm animals]].<ref name="sacco">{{cite journal|last=Sacco|first=AG|title=Immunocontraception: consideration of the zona pellucida as a target antigen|journal=Obstet Gynecol Annu|year=1981|volume=10|pages=1–26}}</ref>

==== Zonagen ====

In 1987, a pharmaceutical company called Zonagen (later renamed [[Repros Therapeutics]]) was started with the goal of developing zona pellucida vaccines as an alternative to the surgical sterilization of [[companion animals]] and eventually as a contraceptive for human use. The products would be based on research being done at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] by Bonnie Dunbar that was funded by Zonagen. However, the relationship between Zonagen and Bonnie Dunbar ended acrimoniously in 1993. Despite claims later that year that development of a contraceptive vaccine was imminent and an agreement with [[Schering AG]] for funding for joint development of a contraceptive vaccine for human use, no vaccine was made commercially available and the agreement with Schering was terminated after [[primate]] studies were disappointing. The company would go on to pursue other projects and be renamed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallstin|first=Brian|title=Biological Disaster|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/1998-08-20/news/biological-disaster/|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=Houston Press|date=20 August 1998}}</ref>

==== Application to wildlife population control ====

Also in the late 1980s, research began into the use of vaccines based around zonae pellucidae harvested from [[pigs]] for the purpose of wildlife control. Such [[porcine zona pellucida]] (PZP) vaccines were tested in captive and domestic [[horses]] in 1986 with encouraging results.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=IKM|coauthors=M Feldman, M Bernoco|title=Contraception in mares heteroimmunized with pig zonae pellucidae|journal=J Reprod Fertil|year=1989|volume=85|pages=19–29}}</ref> This led to the first successful field trial of contraceptive vaccines with free-ranging wildlife, which examined PZP vaccines used upon wild horses of [[Assateague Island National Seashore]] in 1988.<ref name="assateague">{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=JF|coauthors=IKM Liu, JW Turner|title=Remotely delivered immunocontraception in feral horses|journal=Wildl Soc Bull|year=1990|volume=18|pages=326–330}}</ref> The successful results of the field trial were maintained by annual booster inoculations.<ref name="assateague-booster">{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=JF|coauthors=IKM Liu, JW Turner, M Bernoco|title=Antigen recognition in mares previously immunized with porcine zona pellucida|journal=J Reprod Fertil|year=1991|volume=44|pages=321–325}}</ref>

Following the success of trials with horses, initial trials using captive animals showed promise for the use of PZP vaccines with [[white-tailed deer]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=JW|coauthors=IKM Liu, JF Kirkpatrick|title=Remotely-delivered immunocontraception of captive white-tailed deer|journal=J Wildl Manage|year=1992|volume=56|pages=154–157}}</ref> and with [[African elephants]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fayer-Hosken|first=RA|coauthors=HJ Bertschinger, JF Kirkpatrick, D Grobler, N Lamberski, G Honneyman, T Ulrich|title=Contraceptive potential of the porcine zona pellucida vaccine in the African elephant (''Loxodonta africana'')|journal=Theriogenology|year=1999|volume=52|pages=835‚Äì846}}</ref> This led to successful field trials of PZP vaccines in white-tailed deer at the [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]] in [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal, VA]] from September 1992 to September 1994<ref>{{cite journal|last=McShea|first=WJ|coauthors=SL Monfort, S Hakim, JF Kirkpatrick, IKM Liu, JW Turner, L Chassy, L Munson|title=The effect of immunocontraception on the behavior and reproduction of white-tailed deer|journal=J Wildl Manage|year=1997|volume=61|pages=560–569}}</ref> and in African elephants of [[Kruger National Park]] in [[South Africa]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fayrer-Hosken|first=RA|coauthors=D Grobler, JJ van Altena, JF Kirkpatrick, HJ Bertschinger|title=Immunocontraception of free-roaming African elephants|journal=Nature|year=2000|volume=407|pages=149}}</ref>

As a result of these successes, PZP vaccination has become the most popular form of immunocontraception for wildlife. As of 2011, thousands of animals are treated with PZP vaccination every year, including 6 different species of free-ranging wildlife in 52 different locations and 76 captive exotic species in 67 different zoological gardens.<ref name="kirkpatrick" />

==== SpayVac™ ====

In the early 1990s, researchers at [[Dalhousie University]] set out to address a limitation of PZP vaccines. All the field trials of native PZP vaccines found that 2 or 3 initial doses spaced out in time were necessary before contraceptive efficacy would begin. The Dalhousie researchers developed a way to deliver PZP antigens in [[liposomes]], causing the release of antigens to be delayed. This research would result in the product SpayVac™. Independent trials of SpayVac™ in deer found that a single initial dose can function as a contraceptive.<ref>{{cite web|title=About SpayVac™|url=http://terramar.bc.ca/about.html|publisher=Spayvac™-For-Wildlife, Inc|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>

==== Bio Farma ====

In 2012, researchers from [[Brawijaya University]] in conjunction with pharmaceutical company Bio Farma received a grant from the [[Indonesia]]n government to develop a zona pellucida contraceptive vaccine for human use. Instead of pigs, the zonae pellucidae for the program are harvested from [[cow]]s. The program hopes to mass produce a contraceptive vaccine in Indonesia in 2013 at the earliest.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aminudin|first=Muhammad|title=Peneliti Unibraw Ciptakan Kontrasepsi Berbahan Baku Vaksin|url=http://us.surabaya.detik.com/read/2012/01/25/171521/1824824/475/peneliti-unibraw-ciptakan-kontrasepsi-berbahan-baku-vaksin?y990101mainnews|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=detikSurabaya}}</ref>

==== Viral and microbial vectors ====

While contraceptive vaccines can be delivered remotely, they still require administration to each individual animal that is to be made infertile. Thus contraceptive vaccines have been used to control only relatively small populations of wildlife. [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have large populations of European [[invasive species]] for which such approach will not scale. Research in these countries has therefore focused on genetically modifying [[virus]]es or [[microorganism]]s that infect the unwanted invasive species to contain immunocontraceptive antigens.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seamark|first=RF|title=Biotech prospects for the control of introduced mammals in Australia|journal=Reprod Fertil Dev|year=2001|volume=13|pages=705–711}}</ref>

Such research has included targeting the [[European rabbit|European rabbit (''Oryctolagus cuniculus'')]] in Australia by engineering rabbit zona pellucida glycoproteins into a [[recombinant virus|recombinant]] [[myxoma virus]]. This approach has induced marginal reduction of fertility in laboratory rabbits with some of the glycoproteins.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mackenzie|first=SM|coauthors=EA McLaughlin, HD Perkins, N French, T Sutherland, RJ Jackson, B Inglis, WJ Muller, BH van Leeuwen, AJ Robinson, PJ Kerr|title=Immunocontraceptive effects on female rabbits infected with recombinant myxoma virus expressing rabbit ZP2 or ZP3|journal=Biol Reprod|year=2006|volume=74|issue=3|pages=511–521}}</ref> Further improvement of efficacy is necessary before such an approach is ready for field trials.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Leeuwen|first=BH|coauthors=PJ Kerr|title=Prospects for fertility control in the European rabbit (''Oryctalagus cuniculus'') using myxoma virus-vectored immunocontraception|journal=Wildl Res|year=2007|volume=34|issue=7|pages=511–522}}</ref> Research has also targeted the [[house mouse|house mouse (''Mus domesticus'')]] in Australia by engineering [[murine]] zona pellucida antigens into a recombinant [[ectromelia virus]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=RJ|coauthors=DJ Maguire, LA Hinds, IA Ramshaw|title=Infertility in mice induced by a recombinant ectromelia virus expressing mouse zona pellucida glycoprotein 3|journal=Biol Reprod|year=1998|volume=58|issue=1|pages=152–159}}</ref> and a recombinant [[cytomegalovirus]].

In addition to rabbits and mice, this approach has been explored for other animals. Researchers have attempted to replicate similar results when targeting the [[red fox|red fox (''Vulpes vulpes'')]] in Australia using such vectors as ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'', [[vaccinia]], and [[canine herpesvirus]], but no reduction in fertility has been achieved thus far for a variety of reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strive|first=T|coauthors=CM Hardy, GH Reubel|title=Prospects for immunocontraception in the European red fox (''Vulpes vulpes'')|journal=Wildl Res|year=2007|volume=34|issue=7|pages=523–529}}</ref> Initial exploration into the control of the [[common brushtail possum|common brushtail possum (''Trichosurus vulpecula'')]] in New Zealand using the [[nematode]] ''Parastrongyloides trichosuri'' has identified it as a possible immunocontraceptive vector.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=PE|coauthors=WN Grant, M Ralston|title=Assessing the suitability of the parasitic nematode ''Parastrongyloides trichosuri'' as a vector for transmissible fertility control of brushtail possums in New Zealand – ecological and regulatory considerations|journal=Wildl Res|year=2008|volume=35|issue=6|pages=573–577}}</ref>

=== Sperm ===

In placental mammals, fertilization typically occurs inside the female in the [[oviduct]]s. The oviducts are positioned near the [[ovary|ovaries]] where ova are produced. An ovum therefore needs only to travel a short distance to the oviducts for fertilization. In contrast sperm cells must be highly motile, since they are deposited into the female reproductive tract during [[sexual intercourse]] and must travel through the [[cervix]] (in some species) as well as the [[uterus]] and the oviduct (in all species) to reach an ovum.<ref name=pathways/> Sperm cells that are motile are [[spermatozoa]].

Spermatozoa are protected from the male's immune system by the [[blood-testis barrier]]. However, spermatozoa are deposited into the female in [[semen]], which is mostly the secretions of the [[seminal vesicles]], [[prostate gland]], and [[bulbourethral glands]]. In this way antibodies generated by the male are deposited into the female along with spermatozoa. Because of this and the extensive travel in the female reproductive tract, spermatozoa are susceptible to anti-sperm antibodies generated by the male in addition to waiting anti-sperm antibodies generated by the female.<ref name="naz" />

==== Early research ====

In 1899, the discovery of the existence of antibodies against sperm was made independently both by Serge Metchnikoff<ref>{{cite journal|last=Metchnikoff|first=E|title=Etudes sur la resorption de cellule|journal=Ann Inst Pasteur|year=1899|volume=13|pages=737–779}}</ref> of the [[Pasteur Institute]] and by Nobel prize laureate [[Karl Landsteiner]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Landsteiner|first=K|title=Zur Kenntris der spezifisch auf blutkörperchen wirkenden sera|journal=Zb Bakt|year=1899|volume=25|pages=546–549}}</ref>

In 1929, the first recorded attempt at immunocontraception was made by Morris Baskin, clinical director of the Denver Maternal Hygiene Committee. In this trial 20 women who were known to have at least 1 prior pregnancy were injected with their husband's semen, and no conception was recorded in 1 year of observation of these couples.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baskin|first=MJ|title=Temporary sterilization by injection of human spermatozoa: a preliminary report|journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol|year=1932|volume=24|pages=892–897}}</ref> A United States [[patent]] (number 2103240) was issued in 1937 for this approach as a contraceptive, but no product for widespread consumption ever came from this approach.<ref name="naz">{{cite journal|last=Naz|first=RK|title=Antisperm contraceptive vaccines: where we are and where we are going?|journal=Am J Reprod Immunol|year=2011|volume=66|pages=5–12}}</ref>

==== Renewed interest ====

Throughout the 1990s, there was a resurgence of research in immunocontraception targeting sperm with the hope of developing a contraceptive vaccine for human use. Unlike earlier research which explored the contraceptive effect of immune responses to whole sperm cells, contemporary research has focused on searching for specific molecular antigens that are involved with sperm function.

Antigens that have been identified as potential targets for immunocontraception include the sperm-specific [[peptides]] or [[proteins]] ADAM,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Primakoff|first=P|coauthors=H

Early primate trials had mixed results. One study examined the sperm-specific [[isozyme]] of human [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH-C<sub>4</sub>) combined with a [[T-cell]] [[epitope]] to create a [[peptide synthesis|synthetic]] peptide that acted as a more potent [[chimeric antigen receptor|chimeric antigen]]. Vaccination of female baboons with this synthetic peptide resulted in a reduced fertility in the trial.<ref name="goldberg">{{cite journal|last=O'Heard|first=PA|coauthors=ZG Liang, CS Bambra, E Goldberg|title=Colinear synthesis of an antigen-specific B-cell epitope with a promiscuous tetanus toxin T-cell epitope: a synthetic peptide immunocontraceptive|journal=Vaccine|year=1997|volume=15|pages=1761–1766}}</ref> However, a second study that examined vaccination of female [[macaque]] monkeys with the same synthetic peptide did not find reduced fertility.<ref name="primakoff">{{cite journal|last=Tollner|first=TL|coauthors=JW Overstreet, D ranciforte, PD Primakoff|title=Immunization of female cynomolgus macaques with a synthetic epitope of sperm-specific lactate dehyrogenase results in high antibody titers but does not reduce fertility|journal=Mol Reprod Dev|year=2002|volume=62|pages=257–264}}</ref>

Since then, a study examining vaccination based on an [[epididymis|epididymal]] [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]] (Eppin) in male macaque monkeys demonstrated that vaccination against sperm antigens could be an effective, reversible contraceptive in male primates. While 4 of 6 control monkeys impregnated females during the trial, none of the 7 monkeys included in the trial that were vaccinated against Eppin impregnated females, and 4 of these 7 vaccinated monkeys recovered their fertility within a year and a half of observation after the trial.<ref name="eppin">{{cite journal|last=O'Rand|first=MG|coauthors=EE Widgren, P Sivashanmugam, RT Richardson, SH Hall, FS French, CA Vande Voort, SG Ramachandra, V Ramesh, A Jagannadha Roa|title=Reversible immunocontraception in male monkeys immunized with Eppin|journal=Science|year=2004|volume=306|pages=1189}}</ref>

This illustrated that not only could sperm immunocontraception be effective, but it could have several advantages over zona pellucida vaccines. For instance, sperm vaccines could be used by males, in addition to females.<ref name="eppin" />

Additionally, while there are relatively few glycoproteins in the zona pellucida and thus relatively few target antigens for zona pellucida vaccines, more than a dozen prospective target antigens for the inhibition of sperm function have been identified. This relative abundance of prospective target antigens makes the prospects of a [[Vaccine#Valence|multivalent vaccine]] better for sperm vaccines. A study which examined the use of one such multivalent vaccine in female macaque monkeys found that the monkeys produced antibodies against all antigens included in the vaccine, suggesting the efficacy of the multivalent approach.<ref name="multi">{{cite journal|last=Kurth|first=BE|coauthors=L Digilio, P Snow, LA Bush, M Wolkowicz, J Shetty, A Mandal, Z Hao, PP Reddi, CJ Flickinger, JC Herr|title=Immunogenicity of a multi-component recombinant human acrosomal protein vaccine in female ''Macaca fascicularis''|journal=J Reprod Immunol|year=2008|volume=77|issue=2|pages=126–141}}</ref>

Finally, while there has been [[autoimmunity|autoimmmune]] [[ovary|ovarian]] [[pathogenesis]] found in some trials using zona pellucida vaccines,<ref name="mclaughlin" /> anti-sperm antibodies are not likely to have adverse health effects, since anti-sperm antibodies are produced by up to 70% of men who have had [[vasectomy|vasectomies]], and there has been much investigation into possible adverse health side-effects of the vasectomy procedure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liskin|first=L|coauthors=JM Pile, WF Quillan|title=Vasectomy safe and simple|journal=Popul Rep|year=1983|volume=4|pages=61–100}}</ref>

==== Passive immunity ====

A vaccine induces active immunity when antigens are injected into an animal that cause it to produce desired antibodies itself. In [[passive immunity]] the desired [[antibody titer]]s are achieved by injecting antibodies directly into an animal. The efficacy of such an approach for immunocontraception was demonstrated as early as the 1970s with antibodies against zonae pellucidae in mice during the investigation of the mechanism by which such antibodies inhibited fertility.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jilek|first=F|coauthors=A Pavlok|title=Antibodies against mouse ovaries and their effect on fertilization in vitro and in vivo in the mouse|journal=J Reprod Fert|year=1975|volume=42|pages=377–380}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sacco|first=AG|title=Inhibition of fertility in mice by passive immunization with antibodies to isolated zonae pellucidae|journal=J Reprod Fert|year=1979|volume=56|pages=533–537}}</ref> Because the variability of individual immune response is an obstacle to bringing contraceptive vaccines to market, there has been research into the approach of contraception through passive immunization as an alternative that would be of less duration, but be closer to market.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Naz|first=RK|coauthors=R Changanamkandath|title=Passive immunization for immunocontraception: lessons learned from infectious diseases|journal=Front BioSci|year=2004|volume=9|pages=2457–2465}}</ref> Research done using [[phage display]] technology on [[lymphocytes]] from immunoinfertile men led to the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of specific antibodies that inhibit fertility by acting against several of the known sperm antigens.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Samuel|first=AS|coauthors=RK Naz|title=Isolation of human single chain variable fragment antibodies against specific sperm antigens for immunocontraceptive development|journal=Human Reproduction|year=2008|volume=23|issue=6|pages=1324–1337}}</ref> This detailed molecular knowledge of anti-sperm antibodies may be of use in the development of a passive immunocontraceptive product.<ref name="naz" />

== Gamete outcome ==

=== Human chorionic gonadotropin ===

Most of the research into immunity that inhibits gamete outcome has focused on [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG). hCG is not necessary for fertilization, but is secreted by embryos shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Braunstein|first=GD|coauthors=J Rasor, H Danzer, D Adler, ME Wade|title=Serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels throughout normal pregnancy|journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol|year=1976|volume=126|issue=6|pages=678–681}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fishel|first=SB|coauthors=RG Edwards, CJ Evans|title=Human chorionic gonadotropin secreted by preimplantation embryos cultured in vitro|journal=Science|year=1984|volume=223|pages=816–818}}</ref> Therefore immunity against hCG does not prevent fertilization. However, it was found that that anti-hCG antibodies prevent [[marmoset]] embryos from implanting in the [[endometrium]] of their mother's uterus.<ref name="implantation" />

The main function of hCG is to sustain the ovarian [[corpus luteum]] during pregnancy past the time it would normally decay as part of the regular [[menstrual cycle]]. For the first 7–9 weeks in humans, the corpus luteum secretes the [[progesterone]] necessary to maintain the viability of the endometrium for pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Csapo|first=AL|coauthors=MO Pulkkinen, B Rutter, JP Sauvage, WG Wiest|title=The significance of the human corpus luteum in pregnancy maintenance|journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol|year=1972|volume=112|pages=1061–1067}}</ref> Therefore immunity against hCG during this time frame would function as an abortifacient, as confirmed by experiments in [[baboon]]s.<ref name="abortion" /> In the scientific literature the more inclusive term "birth control vaccine" rather than "contraceptive vaccine" is used to refer to hCG vaccines.<ref name="editorial" />

==== Clinical trials ====

Research begun in the 1970s led to clinical trials in humans of a hCG birth control vaccine. A phase I (safety) clinical trial examined 15 women from clinics in [[Helsinki|Helsinki, Finland]], [[Uppsala|Uppsala, Sweden]], [[Bahia|Bahia, Brazil]], and [[Santiago|Santiago, Chile]] with a vaccine formed by conjugating the beta subunit of hCG with a [[tetanus toxoid]]. The women had previously had [[tubal ligation]]s. In the trial the immune response was reversible and no significant health issues were found.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=H|coauthors=ED Johansson, GP Talwar, J Vasquez, S Segal, E Coutinho, T Luukkainen, K Sundaram|title=Observations on the antigenicity and clinical effects of a candidate antipregnancy vaccine: beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin linked to tetanus toxoid|journal=Feril Steril|year=1980|volume=34|issue=4|pages=328–35}}</ref>

This was followed by another phase I trial in 1977-1978 examining previously sterilized women at 5 institutions in [[India]] with a more potent vaccine that combined the beta subunit of hCG with the alpha subunit of [[ovine]] luteinizing hormone to form a heterospecies [[protein dimer|dimer]] conjugated with both tetanus toxoid and [[diphtheria toxin|diphtheria]] toxoid.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Talwar|first=GP|coauthors=V Hingorani, S Kumar, S Roy, A Banerjee, SM Shahani, U Krishna, K Dhall, H Sawhney, NC Sharma|title=Phase I clinical trials with three formulations of anti-hCG vaccine|journal=Contraception|year=1990|volume=41|pages=301–316}}</ref> The multiple carriers were used because it was found that a small percentage of women acquired carrier-specific immunosuppression due to repeated injection of conjugates with the same carrier.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gaur|first=A|coauthors=K Arunan, O Singh, GP Talwar|title=Bypass by an alternate ‘carrier’ of acquired unresponsiveness to hCG upon repeated immunization with tetanus-conjugated vaccine|journal=Int Immunol|year=1990|volume=2|issue=2|pages=151–155}}</ref>

This more potent version of the vaccine was used in a phase II (efficacy) trial during 1991-1993 conducted at 3 locations: the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]], [[Safdarjung Hospital]] in [[New Dehli]], and the [[Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research]] in [[Chandigarh]]. Primary immunization consisted of 3 injections at 6 week intervals, and 148 women known to be previously fertile completed primary immunization. All women generated antibodies against hCG, but only 119 (80%) generated antibody titers clearly above 50&nbsp;ng/mL, which was the estimated level for efficacy. Blood samples were taken twice a month, and booster injections were given when antibody titers declined below 50&nbsp;ng/mL in women who wished to continue using the vaccine. At the completion of the study after 1224 menstrual cycles observed, only 1 pregnancy occurred in a woman having an antibody titer level above 50&nbsp;ng/mL, and 26 pregnancies occurred among women who had titers below 50&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref name="clinical">{{cite journal|last=Talwar|first=GP|coauthors=OM Singh, R Pal, N Chatterjee, P Sahai, K Dhall, J Kaur, SK Das, S Suri, K Buckshee, L Saraya, BN Saxena|title=A vaccine that prevents pregnancy inwomen|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|year=1994|volume=91|pages=8532–8536}}</ref>

==== Application to cancer therapy ====

Following these clinical trails of hCG vaccination as a birth control method, hCG was discovered to be expressed in certain kinds of [[malignant neoplasm]]s, including breast cancer,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Agnantis|first=NJ|coauthors=F Patra, L Khaldi, S Filis|title=Immunohistochemical expression of subunit beta HCG in breast cancer|journal=Eur J Gynaecol Oncol|year=1992|volume=13|pages=461–466}}</ref> adenocarcinoma of the prostate,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheaff|first=MT|coauthors=JE Martin, DF Badenoch, SI Baithun|title=hCG as a prognostic marker in adenocarcinoma of the prostate|journal=J Clin Pathol|year=1996|volume=49|pages=329–332}}</ref> progressive vulvar carcinoma,<ref>{{cite journal|last=de Bruijn|first=HW|coauthors=KA ten Hoor, M Krans, AG van der Zee|title=Rising serum values of b-subunit human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in patients with progressive vulvar carcinomas|journal=Br J Cancer|year=1997|volume=75|pages=1217–1218}}</ref> carcinoma of the bladder,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dirnhofer|first=S|coauthors=P Koessler, C Ensigner, H Feichtinger, S Madersbacher, P Berger|title=Berger P: Production of trophoblastic hormones by transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder: association to tumor stage and grade|journal=Hum Pathol|year=1998|volume=29|pages=377–382}}</ref> pancreatic adenocarcinoma,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Syrigos|first=KN|coauthors=I Fyssas, MM Konstandoulakis, KJ Harrington, S Papdopoulos, N Milingos, P Peveretos, BC Golematis|title=Beta human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations in serum of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma|journal=Gut|year=1998|volume=42|pages=88–91}}</ref> cervical carcinoma,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=RA|coauthors=RK Iles, PG Carter, CJ Caldwell, JH Shepherd, T Chard|title=The prognostic significance of human chorionic gonadotrophin and its metabolites in women with cervical carcinoma|journal=J Clin Pathol|year=1998|volume=51|pages=685–688}}</ref> gastric carcinoma,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=W|coauthors=H Yang, S Han|title=The effect of ectopic HCG on microvessel density in gastric carcinoma|journal=Chin J Oncol|year=1998|volume=20|pages=351–353}}</ref> squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hedstrom|first=J|coauthors=R Grenman, H Ramsey, P Finne, J Lundin, C Haglund, H Alfthan, UH Stenman|title=Concentration of free hCGb subunit in serum as a prognostic marker for squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx|journal=Int J Cancer|year=1999|volume=84|pages=525–528}}</ref> lung carcinoma,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dirnhofer|first=S|coauthors=M Freund, H Rogatsch, S Krabichler, P Berger|title=Selective expression of trophoblastic hormones by lung carcinoma: neuroendocrine tumors exclusively produce human chorionic gonadotropin a-subunit (hCGa)|journal=Hum Pathol|year=2000|volume=31|pages=966–972}}</ref> and colorectal cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Louhimo|first=J|coauthors=M Carpelan-Holmstrom, H Alfthan, UH Stenman, HJ Jarvinen, C Haglund|title=Serum hCG b, CA 72-4 and CEA are independent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer|journal=Int J Cancer|year=2002|volume=101|pages=545–548}}</ref> Therefore immunity against hCG has applications such as imaging of cancer cells, selective delivery of cytotoxic compounds to tumor cells, and in at least one case, direct therapeutic effect by preventing establishment, inhibiting the growth, and causing the [[necrosis]] of tumors.<ref name="talwar">{{cite journal|last=Talwar|first=GP|coauthors=JC Gupta, NV Shankar|title=Immunological approaches against human chorionic gonadotropin for control of fertility and therapy of advanced-stage cancers expressing hCG ⁄ subunits|journal=Am J Reprod Immunol|year=2011|volume=66|pages=26–39}}</ref> This has led to interest in developing hCG vaccines specifically for cancer treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=He|first=LZ|coauthors=V Ramakrishna, JE Connolly, XT Wang, PA Smith, CL Jones, M Valkova-Valchanova, A Arunakumari, JF Treml, J Goldstein, PK Wallace, T Keler, MJ Endres|title=A novel human cancer vaccine elicits cellular responses to the tumor-associated antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin b|journal=Clin Cancer Res|year=2004|volume=10|pages=1920–1927}}</ref>

==== Ongoing research ====

The vaccine tested in the phase II clinical trial in India did not proceed further because it produced antibody titers of 50&nbsp;ng/mL for at least 3 months duration in only 60% of women in the trial. Ongoing research in hCG birth control vaccines has focused on improving immunogenicity. A vaccine in which the beta subunit of hCG is fused to the B subunit of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' [[heat-labile enterotoxin]] has been effective in laboratory mice. It has been approved by the Indian National Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation and is being produced for pre-clinical toxicology testing. If it is determined to be safe, it is planned for clinical trials.<ref name="talwar"/>

== Advantages ==

=== Wildlife control ===

Immunocontraception is one of the few alternatives to lethal methods for the direct control of wildlife populations. While there was research into the use of [[hormonal contraception]] for wildlife control as early as the 1950s that produced pharmacologically effective products, they all proved to be ineffective for wildlife control for a variety of practical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=JF|coauthors=JW Turner|title=Chemical fertility control and wildlife management|journal=Bioscience|year=1985|volume=35|pages=485–491}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=JF|coauthors=JW Turner|title=Reversible fertility control in nondomestic animals|journal=J Zoo Wildl Med|year=1991|volume=22|pages=392–408}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Seal|first=US|title=Fertility control as a tool for regulating captive and free-ranging wildlife populations|journal=J Zoo Wildl Med|year=1991|volume=22|pages=1–5}}</ref> Field trials of immunocontraception in wildlife, on the other hand, established that contraceptive vaccines could be delivered remotely by [[capture gun]], were safe to use in pregnant animals, were reversible, and induced long-lasting infertility, overcoming these practical limitations.<ref name="kirkpatrick" />

One concern about the use of hormonal contraceptives in general, but especially in wildlife, is that the sex steroid hormones that are used are easily passed from animal to animal. This can lead to unintended [[ecology|ecological]] consequences. For instance, fish exposed to treated sewage effluents were found to have concentrations of the synthetic hormone [[levonorgestrel]] in blood plasma higher than those found in humans taking hormonal contraceptives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fick|first=J|coauthors=RH Lindberg, J Parkkonen, B Arvidsson, M Tysklind, DGJ Larsson|title=Therapeutic levels of levonorgestrel detected in blood plasma of fish: results from screening rainbow trout exposed to treated sewage effluents|journal=Environ Sci Technol|year=2010|volume=44|issue=7|pages=2661‚Äì2666}}</ref> Because the antigens used in contraceptive vaccines are protein, not steroids, they are not easily passed from animal to animal without loss of function.<ref name="assateague" />

=== Human use ===

Immunocontraception promises many advantages over methods of contraception currently available for human use. It does not require surgical intervention, unlike procedures such as vasectomy or tubal ligation. It does not require action by participants concomitant with the act of intercourse, unlike methods such as the use of [[condoms]].

The form of contraception most comparable to prospective immunocontraceptive products for humans is hormonal contraception, over which immunocontraception offers several advantages: it can be effective with as infrequent as annual dosing, rather than a daily pill regimen;<ref name="assateague-booster" /> it can be used by both males and females, rather than just females;<ref name="eppin" /> it does not entail the side effects of ingesting synthetic hormones, where undesired side effects exist. Furthermore, the demand for contraception is greatest in parts of the [[developing world]], where [[World population#Growth|population growth]] is greatest, but this is also where access to hormonal contraceptives is least.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Black|first=TRL|title=Oral contraceptive prescription requirements and commercial availability in 45 developing countries|journal=Studies in Family Planning|year=1974|volume=5|issue=8|pages=250–254}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Family Planning Worldwide: 2008 Data Sheet|year=2008|publisher=Population Reference Bureau}}</ref> While access to daily pharmaceuticals may be generally poor in less-developed countries, most countries have an infrastructure for mass immunization.<ref name="naz" />

==== Obstacles to human use ====

===== Variability of immunogenicity =====

In order for an immunocontraceptive to be palatable for human use, it would need to meet or exceed the efficacy rates of currently popular forms of contraception.<ref name="talwar" /> Currently the maximum reduction of fertility due to sperm vaccines in laboratory experiments with mice is ~75%.<ref name="naz" /> The lack of efficacy is due to variability of immunogenicity from one animal to another. Even when exposed to the same exact vaccine, some animals will produce abundant antibody titers to the vaccine's antigen, while others produce relatively low antibody titers. In the Eppin trial that attained 100% infertility, a small sample size (only 9 monkeys) was used, and even among this small sample 2 monkeys were dropped from the study because they failed to produce sufficiently high antibody titers.<ref name="eppin" />

This trend&mdash;high efficacy when antibody titers are above a threshold coupled with variability in how many animals reach such a threshold&mdash;is seen throughout immunocontraception and immune-based birth control research. A long term study of PZP vaccination in deer that spanned 6 years found that infertility was directly related to antibody titers to PZP.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=LA|coauthors=BE Johns, GJ Killian|title=Long-term effects of PZP immunization on reproduction in white-tailed deer|journal=Vaccine|year=1999|volume=18|issue=5-6|pages=568–574}}</ref> The phase II clinical trial of hCG vaccines was quite successful among women who had antibody titers above 50&nbsp;ng/mL, but quite poor among those with antibody titers below this threshold.<ref name="clinical" />

===== Lack of mucosal immunity =====

[[Mucosal immunity]], which includes immune function in the female reproductive tract, is not as well understood as [[humoral immunity]]. This may be an issue for certain contraceptive vaccines. For instance, in the second LDH-C<sub>4</sub> primate trial that had negative results, all of the immunized macaque monkeys developed high antibody titers against LDH-C<sub>4</sub> in [[serum (blood)|serum]], but antibodies against LDH-C<sub>4</sub> were not found in the monkeys' vaginal fluids.<ref name="primakoff"/> If antibodies against LDH-C<sub>4</sub> do indeed inhibit fertilization, then this result highlights how the difference in the functioning of mucosal immunity from humoral immunity may be critical to the efficacy of contraceptive vaccines.

===== Autoimmune side effects =====

Whenever an immune response is provoked, there is some risk of autoimmunity. Therefore immunocontraception trials typically check for signs of [[autoimmune disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=GR|coauthors=AG Sacco, MG Subramanian, M Kruger, S Zhang, EC Yurewicz, KS Moghissi|title=Histology of ovaries of female rabbits immunized with deglycosylated zona pellucida macromolecules of pigs|journal=J Reprod Fertil|year=1992|volume=95|pages=512–525}}</ref> One concern with zona pellucida vaccination, in particular, is that in certain cases it appears to be correlated with ovarian pathogenesis.<ref name="mclaughlin" /> However, ovarian disease has not not been observed in every trial of zona pellucida vaccination, and when observed, has not always been irreversible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sacco|first=AG|coauthors=DL Pierce, MG Subramanian, EC Yurewicz, WR Dukelow|title=Ovaries remain functional in squirrel monkeys (''Saimiri sciureus'') immunized with porcine zona pellucida 55,000 macromolecule|journal=Biol Reprod|year=1987|volume=36|issue=2|pages=481–490}}</ref>
