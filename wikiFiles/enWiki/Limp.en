A '''limp''' is a type of [[gait abnormality|asymmetric abnormality]] of the [[gait (human)|gait]]. Limping may be caused by pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity.  The most common underlying cause of a painful limp is [[physical trauma]]; however, in the absence of trauma, other serious causes, such as [[septic arthritis]] or [[slipped capital femoral epiphysis]], may be present.  The diagnostic approach involves ruling out potentially serious causes via the use of [[X-ray]]s, [[blood test]]s, and sometimes [[joint aspiration]]. Initial treatment involves [[pain management]].  A limp is the presenting problem in about 4% of children who visit hospital emergency departments.

==Definition==
A limp is a type of asymmetric abnormality of the [[gait (human)|gait]].  When due to pain it is referred to as an [[antalgic gait]], in which the foot in in contact with the ground for a shorter duration than usual; in severe cases there may be a refusal to walk.<ref name=Review10/>  Hip deformities with associated muscular weakness, on the other hand, may present with a [[Trendelenburg gait]], with the body shifted over the affected hip.<ref name=Review10/>

==Differential diagnosis==
The causes of limping are many and can be either serious or non-serious.  It usually results from pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity.<ref name=Review10>{{cite journal |author=Laine JC, Kaiser SP, Diab M |title=High-risk pediatric orthopedic pitfalls |journal=Emerg. Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=85–102, viii |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=19945600 |doi=10.1016/j.emc.2009.09.008 }}</ref>  In 30% of cases, the underlying cause remains unknown after appropriate investigations.<ref name=Review10/>  The most common underlying cause of limping in children is minor [[physical trauma]].  In those with no history of trauma, 40% are due to [[transient synovitis]] and 2% are from [[Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome]].<ref name=Fish09>{{cite journal |author=Fischer SU, Beattie TF |title=The limping child: epidemiology, assessment and outcome |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Br |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=1029–34 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10615981 |doi= 10.1302/0301-620X.81B6.9607}}</ref> Other important causes are infectious arthritis, osteomyelitis, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children.

===Infection===
;Septic arthritis
[[Septic arthritis]] can be difficult to separate from more serious conditions such as [[transient synovitis]].  Factors that can help indicate septic arthritis rather than synovitis include a WBC count greater than 12×10<sup>9</sup>/l, fever greater than {{convert|38.5|°C|°F}}, [[ESR]] greater than 40mm/hr, [[CRP]] greater than 2.0 mg/dL, and refusal to walk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kocher MS, Mandiga R, Zurakowski D, Barnewolt C, Kasser JR |title=Validation of a clinical prediction rule for the differentiation between septic arthritis and transient synovitis of the hip in children |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=86-A |issue=8 |pages=1629–35 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15292409 }}</ref>  People with septic arthritis usually look clinically toxic or sick.<ref name=Review09/>  Even in the absence of any of these factors, however, septic arthritis may be present.<ref name="Caird MS, Flynn JM, Leung YL, Millman JE, D'Italia JG, Dormans JP 2006 1251–7">{{cite journal |author=Caird MS, Flynn JM, Leung YL, Millman JE, D'Italia JG, Dormans JP |title=Factors distinguishing septic arthritis from transient synovitis of the hip in children.

;Other
Other infections that classically lead to a limp include [[Lyme disease]] (a bacterial infection spread by a deer tick) and [[osteomyelitis]] (an infection of the bone).<ref name=Frick06/>

===Mechanical===
;Trauma
Accidental or deliberate [[physical trauma]] may result in either a fracture, muscle bruising, or a contusion.<ref name=Frick06/>  It is the leading cause of a limp.<ref name=Review10/>  Deliberate abuse is important to consider.

;Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
[[Slipped capital femoral epiphysis]] (SCFE) is a condition in which the [[growth plate]] of the head of the femur slips over the underlying bone.  It most commonly presents with hip pain in males during puberty and is associated with [[obesity]].<ref name=Review10/>  The majority of people affected have a painful limp and in half of cases both hips are affected.<ref name=Review10/>  Nearly a quarter of people present with only knee pain.<ref name=Frick06>{{cite journal |author=Frick SL |title=Evaluation of the child who has hip pain |journal=Orthop. Clin. North Am. |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=133–40, v |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16638444 |doi=10.1016/j.ocl.2005.12.003 }}</ref>  Treatment involves non-weight-bearing movement and surgery.<ref name=Review10/>  If not identified early, [[osteonecrosis]] or death of the head of the femur may occur.<ref name=Frick06/>

;Other
A non-painful limp may be due to a number of mechanical conditions including [[hip dysplasia (human)|hip dysplasia]] and leg length differences.<ref name=Frick06/>

===Inflammatory===
;Transient synovitis
[[Transient synovitis]] is a [[reactive arthritis]] of the hip of unknown cause.<ref name=Review10/>  People are usually able to walk and may have a low grade fever.<ref name=Review10/>  They usually look clinically nontoxic or otherwise healthy.<ref name=Review09/>  It may only be diagnosed once all other potential serious causes are excluded.  With symptomatic care it usually resolves over one week.<ref name=Review10/>

;Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
[[Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]] presents gradually with early morning stiffness, fatigue, and weight loss.<ref name=Review09/>

===Vascular===
;Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome
[[Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome]] is a degenerative disease of the head of the femur which results in bone loss and deformity.  It usually presents as a chronic condition.<ref name=Frick06/>

===Neoplastic===
Cancers including [[acute lymphocytic leukemia]], [[osteosarcoma]], and [[Ewing’s sarcoma]] may result in a gradual onset of limping in children.  It is often associated with night sweating, easy bruising, weight loss, and pain most prominent at night.<ref name=Review09/><ref name=Frick06/>

==Diagnostic approach==
The diagnosis of the cause of a limp is often made based on history, physical exam findings, laboratory tests, and radiological examination.  If a limp is associated with pain it should be urgently investigated, while non-painful limps can be approached and investigated more gradually.<ref name=Review09>{{cite journal |author=Sawyer JR, Kapoor M |title=The limping child: a systematic approach to diagnosis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=215–24 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19202969 }}</ref>  Young children have difficult determining the location of leg pain, thus in this population, ''knee pain equals hip pain''.<ref name=Frick06/>  SCFE can usually be excluded by an x-ray of the hips.<ref name=Review10/>  A ultrasound or x-ray guided aspiration of the hip joint maybe required to rule out an infectious process within the hip.<ref name=Review10/>

==Epidemiology==
A limp at one hospital emergency department was the presenting complaint in 4% of children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Singer JI |title=The cause of gait disturbance in 425 pediatric patients |journal=Pediatr Emerg Care |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=7–10 |year=1985 |month=March |pmid=3843430 |doi= 10.1097/00006565-198503000-00003}}</ref>  It occurs twice as commonly in boys as in girls.<ref name=Fish09/>
