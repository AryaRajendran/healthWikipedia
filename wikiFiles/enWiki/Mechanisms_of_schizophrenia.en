The underlying '''mechanisms of schizophrenia''', a mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of the processes of thinking and of emotional responsiveness, are complex.  A number of theories attempt to explain the link between altered brain function and [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=Lancet09>{{vcite journal |author=[[Jim van Os|van Os J]], Kapur S |title=Schizophrenia |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9690 |pages=635–45 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19700006 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60995-8 }}</ref> One of the most important is the [[Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia|dopamine hypothesis]].   This attributes psychosis to the faulty distribution, regulation, and function of [[dopamine|dopaminergic neurons]].<ref name=Lancet09/> Specifically, atypicallity is observed within the D2 subtype, a common target for all antipsychotic drugs. Along with glutamate, dopamine is involved in the advancement and reinforcement of the abnormal thought patterns in schizophrenia. Similarly, dopamine facilitates abnormal long term potentiation within the [[striatum]], [[basal ganglia]], [[cingulate cortex]] (specifically the [[cingulate gyrus]]), and prefrontal cortex, among other limbic system structures.

Glutaminergic abnormalities may also figure in schizophrenia. Specifically, a deficit in metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (the primary post-synaptic receptors) results in a relative excess of the activity of the other 6 presynaptic receptors. In turn, a reduction of cAMP levels in these glutaminergic neurons lowers the activity of the NMDA receptor, a receptor crucial for the phenomena of LTP. This then leads to altered K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the cell. In addition, the protein reelin, a crucial modulator of NMDA function in the [[hippocampus]], is in lowered concentrations in both schizophrenic and psychotic bipolar disorder patients. This protein enhances LTP activity.   That is, the risk for psychotic disorders is associated with alterations in the expression and distribution of a wide variety of G protein coupled receptors. Specifically alterations in the autoreception of metabotropic receptors creates abnormal ligand gated ion channel activity, resulting in maladaptive synaptic plasticity. 
  
A leading hypothesis treats schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease,<ref name="Shenton2001">{{vcite journal |author=Shenton ME, Dickey CC, Frumin M, McCarley RW |title=A review of MRI findings in schizophrenia |journal=Schizophr. Res |volume=49 |issue=1-2 |pages=1–52 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11343862 |pmc=2812015 }}</ref> in which "developmental insults as early as late first or early second trimester lead to the activation of pathologic neural circuits during adolescence or young adulthood", but critics say the neurodevelopmental hypothesis "does not fully account for a number of features of schizophrenia". Indeed, schizophrenia requires not only genetically induced neurological deficits, but unique psychological stressors as well. It is fundamentally different from other developmental disorders, in that it is "self-induced" to some extent. That is, it results from an otherwise normal process for plasticity that advances to form a "parallel", isolated circuit, similar to distributed computing, but on a much more integrated way.<ref name=Fatemi>{{vcite journal |author=Fatemi SH, Folsom TD |title=The neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, revisited |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=528–48 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19223657 |pmc=2669580 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbn187}}</ref>  The [[causes of schizophrenia]] remain poorly understood.<ref name="Steen2006"/>

In 2010 another hypothesis of schizophrenia was formulated: abnormal immune system development may help explain roles of prenatal hazards, post-pubertal onset, stress, genes, climate, infections, and brain dysfunction.<ref>10.1016/j.mehy.2009.09.040</ref> The immune hypotheses is supported by findings of high serum levels of inflammatory markers.<ref>PMID 20021321</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Particular focus has been placed upon the function of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that a drug group which blocks dopamine function, known as the [[phenothiazines]], could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that  [[amphetamine]]s, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.<ref name="Laruelle1996">{{vcite journal |author=Laruelle M, Abi-Dargham A, van Dyck CH, ''et al'' |title=Single photon emission computerized tomography imaging of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in drug-free schizophrenic subjects |journal=Proc.

An influential theory, known as the [[Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]], proposed that excess activation of [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub> receptors]] was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20 years based on the D<sub>2</sub> blockade effect common to all antipsychotics, it was not until the mid-1990s that [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[SPET]] imaging studies provided supporting evidence. This explanation is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (called [[atypical antipsychotic]] medication) can be equally effective as older medication (called [[typical antipsychotic]] medication), but also affects [[serotonin]] function and may have slightly less of a [[dopamine]] blocking effect.<ref name="JonesPilowsky2002">{{vcite journal |author=Jones HM, Pilowsky LS |title=Dopamine and antipsychotic drug action revisited |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=181  |pages=271–5 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12356650 |doi=10.1192/bjp.181.4.271}}</ref> 

Interest has also focused on the neurotransmitter [[glutamate]] and the reduced function of the [[NMDA receptor|NMDA glutamate receptor]] in schizophrenia. This has largely been suggested by abnormally low levels of [[glutamate receptor]]s found in postmortem brains of people previously diagnosed with schizophrenia<ref name="Konradi2003">{{vcite journal |author=Konradi C, Heckers S |title=Molecular aspects of glutamate dysregulation: implications for schizophrenia and its treatment |journal=Pharmacol.

===Glutamate===
{{Main|Glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia}}
Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. As such, it is crucial for the formation of any positive gain circuits within the brain. Of specific interest in this disorder are the presynaptic metabotropic receptors, which act as autoreceptors, regulating [[glycine]] and [[glutamate]] receptors, also known as NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are unique in that they are voltage dependent, that is, at 0 or near 0 membrane potential, they are blocked by Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Only when there is a depolarization do these Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open. This is the primary reason for the phenomena of LTP. While this a crucial component of the plasticity system of the brain, the GABA system, and Monoamine regulatory GPCRs are the primary way this can create long range order.
 
Interest has focused on these neurotransmitter, given the reduced function of the [[NMDA receptor|NMDA glutamate receptor]] in schizophrenia, and the ability for exogenuos agent to induce specific symptoms of this illness. This is supported by the fact that NMDA antagonists can create some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, e.g. catatonia, thought disorder, typical of schizophrenic, psychotic patients. However, dopaminergic drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine can cause some of the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, like paranoid delusions, agitation, and others. The NMDA component has largely been suggested by abnormally low levels of glutamate receptors found in postmortem brains of people previously diagnosed with schizophrenia<ref name="Konradi2003"/> and the discovery that the glutamate blocking drugs such as [[phencyclidine]] and [[ketamine]] can mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with the condition,<ref name="Lahti2001"/> while the dopaminergic part of this illness is suggested by the D<sub>2</sub> antagonisms that is a common mechanism of action by all antipsychotic drugs, typical and atypical.  

The fact that reduced glutamate function is linked to poor performance on tests requiring [[frontal lobe]] and [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] function and that glutamate can affect [[dopamine]] function, all of which have been implicated in schizophrenia, have suggested an important mediating (and possibly causal) role of glutamate pathways in schizophrenia.<ref name="Coyle2003"/> Further support of this theory has come from preliminary trials suggesting the efficacy of coagonists at the NMDA receptor complex in reducing some of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.<ref name="Touminen2005">{{vcite journal |author=Tuominen HJ, Tiihonen J, Wahlbeck K |title=Glutamatergic drugs for schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Schizophr.

===Dopamine===
{{Main|Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia}}
Particular focus has been placed upon the function of [[dopamine]] in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that a drug group which blocks dopamine function, known as the [[phenothiazines]], could reduce psychotic symptoms. An influential theory, known as the "dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia", proposes that a malfunction involving dopamine pathways is therefore the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. 

Evidence for this theory includes<ref>{{vcite book |author=Martin S |title=An Atlas of Schizophrenia |publisher=Taylor & Francis |location=Washington, DC |year=2002 |isbn=1-85070-074-5 |page= 54}}</ref> findings that the potency of many antipsychotics is correlated with their affinity to [[Dopamine receptor D2|dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors]];<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Creese I, Burt DR, Snyder SH |title=Dopamine receptor binding predicts clinical and pharmacological potencies of antischizophrenic drugs |journal=Science (journal) |volume=192 |issue=4238 |pages=481–3 |year=1976 |month=April |pmid=3854 |doi=10.1126/science.3854}}</ref> and the exacerbatory effects of a dopamine [[agonist]] ([[amphetamine]]) and a [[dopamine beta hydroxylase]] inhibitor ([[disulfiram]]) on schizophrenia;<ref>{{vcite journal  | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(84)80062-4 | author = Angrist B, van Kammen DP | year = 1984 | title = CNS stimulants as a tool in the study of schizophrenia | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 7 | pages = 388–90 }}</ref><ref>{{vcite journal |author=Lieberman JA, Kane JM, Alvir J |title=Provocative tests with psychostimulant drugs in schizophrenia |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=415–33 |year=1987 |pmid=2884687 |doi= 10.1007/BF00216006}}</ref> and post-mortem studies initially suggested increased density of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the [[striatum]].  Such high levels of D<sub>2</sub> receptors intensify brain signals and can exacerbate positive symptoms (''i.e.'' hallucinations and paranoia) in schizophrenia. Impaired glutamate (a neurotransmitter which directs neuron to pass along an impulse) activity appears to be another source of schizophrenia symptoms.<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Myers DG |year=2007 |title=Schizophrenia | journal=Psychology |pages= 678–85 }}</ref>

However, there was controversy and conflicting findings over whether postmortem findings resulted from [[drug tolerance]] to chronic antipsychotic treatment. Compared to the success of postmortem studies in finding profound changes of dopamine receptors, imaging studies using [[SPET]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] methods in drug naive patients have generally failed to find any difference in dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor density compared to controls.  Comparable findings in longitudinal studies show: " Particular emphasis is given to methodological limitations in the existing literature, including lack of reliability data, clinical heterogeneity among studies, and inadequate study designs and statistic," suggestions are made for improving future longitudinal neuroimaging studies of treatment effects in schizophrenia<ref>{{vcite journal   | journal = Schizophrenia Research |volume= 78 |issue= 1 | author = Davis C, Jeste D, Eyler L |date= 1 October 2005 | pmid = 15979287 |pages= 45–60 | doi=10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.009 | title= Review of longitudinal functional neuroimaging studies of drug treatments in patients with schizophrenia }}</ref> A recent review of imaging studies in schizophrenia shows confidence in the techniques, while discussing such operator error.<ref>{{vcite journal | author=Gur RE, Chin S | title=Laterality in functional brain imaging studies of schizophrenia. | url=http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000114/CH112.html | journal=Schizophrenia bulletin | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=141–56 | year=1999 | pmid = 10098918 }}</ref>  In 2007 one report said, "During the last decade, results of brain imaging studies by use of PET and SPET in schizophrenic patients showed a clear dysregulation of the dopaminergic system." <ref>{{vcite journal | doi = 10.1080/09540260701502468 | author = Meisenzahl EM, Schmitt GJ, Moller HJ | pmid = 17671867 | year = 2007 | title = The role of dopamine for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia | journal = International Review of Psychiatry | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 337–45 }}</ref>

Recent findings from meta-analyses suggest that there may be a small elevation
in dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in drug-free patients with schizophrenia, but the degree of overlap between patients and controls makes it unlikely that this is clinically meaningful.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Laruelle M |title=Imaging dopamine transmission in schizophrenia.

In addition, newer antipsychotic medication (called [[atypical antipsychotic]] medication) can be as potent as older medication (called [[typical antipsychotic]] medication) while also affecting [[serotonin]] function and having somewhat less of a dopamine blocking effect. In addition, dopamine pathway dysfunction has not been reliably shown to correlate with symptom onset or severity.  [[Homovanillic acid|HVA]] levels correlate trendwise to symptoms severity.  During the application of [[debrisoquin]], this correlation becomes significant.<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Maas JW, Contreras SA, Seleshi E, Bowden CL | year = 1988 | title = Dopamine metabolism and disposition in schizophrenic patients.

Even in 1986 the effect of antipsychotics on receptor measurement was controversial.  An article in ''Science'' sought to clarify whether the increase was solely due to medication by using drug-naive schizophrenics: "The finding that D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptors are substantially increased in schizophrenic patients who have never been treated with neuroleptic drugs raises the possibility that dopamine receptors are involved in the schizophrenic disease process itself. Alternatively, the increased D<sub>2</sub> receptor number may reflect presynaptic factors such as increased endogenous dopamine levels (16). In either case, our findings support the hypothesis that dopamine receptor abnormalities are present in untreated schizophrenic patients." <ref>{{vcite journal | author= Wong DF, Wagner H, Tune L, ''et al'' | year = 1986  | title = Positron emission tomography reveals elevated D2 dopamine receptors in drug-naive schizophrenics | journal = Science | volume = 234 | issue = 4783| pages = 1558–63 | doi = 10.1126/science.2878495 | pmid = 2878495 }}</ref>  (The experiment used 3-N-[11C]methylspiperone – the same as mentioned by Seeman detects D<sub>2</sub> monomers and binding was double that of controls.)

It is still thought that dopamine mesolimbic pathways may be hyperactive, resulting in hyperstimulation of D<sub>2</sub> receptors and positive symptoms. There is also growing evidence that, conversely, [[mesocortical pathway]] dopamine projections to the [[prefrontal cortex]] might be hypoactive (underactive), resulting in hypostimulation of D<sub>1</sub> receptors, which may be related to negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. The overactivity and underactivity in these different regions may be linked, and may not be due to a primary dysfunction of dopamine systems but to more general neurodevelopmental issues that precede them.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Abi-Dargham A, Moore H |title=Prefrontal DA transmission at D<sub>1</sub> receptors and the pathology of schizophrenia |journal=Neuroscientist |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=404–16 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14580124 |doi= 10.1177/1073858403252674}}</ref> Increased dopamine sensitivity may be a common final pathway.<ref name=Seeman>{{vcite journal |author=Seeman P, Schwarz J, Chen JF, ''et al'' |title=Psychosis pathways converge via D2high dopamine receptors |journal=Synapse |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=319–46 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16786561 |doi=10.1002/syn.20303}}</ref>

==Structural findings==
Studies have tended to show various subtle average differences in the volume of certain areas of brain structure between people with and without diagnoses of schizophrenia, although it has become increasingly clear that there is no single pathological neuropsychological or structural neuroanatomic profile, due partly to heterogeneity within the disorder.<ref name=Flashman04>{{vcite journal |author=Flashman LA, Green MF |title=Review of cognition and brain structure in schizophrenia: profiles, longitudinal course, and effects of treatment |journal=Psychiatr.

===Neurological===
Those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia have both changes in brain structure and brain chemistry, including [[dopamine]].<ref name=Lancet09/> Studies using [[neuropsychological test]]s and [[brain imaging]] technologies such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] to examine functional differences in brain activity have shown that differences seem to most commonly occur in the  [[frontal lobe]]s, [[hippocampus]] and [[temporal lobe]]s.<ref name="Kircher">{{vcite book |year=2006 |author=Kircher, Tilo and Renate Thienel |title=The Boundaries of Consciousness |isbn=0-444-52876-8 |page=302 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=YHGacGKyVbYC&pg=PA302 |chapter=Functional brain imaging of symptoms and cognition in schizophrenia |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam}}</ref> Due to the alteration in neural circuits some{{who|date=December 2010}} feel schizophrenia should be viewed as a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders.<ref name=Insel_2010>{{vcite journal |author=Insel TR |title=Rethinking schizophrenia |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7321 |pages=187–93 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=21068826 |doi=10.1038/nature09552 }}</ref>  These differences have been linked to the [[neurocognitive deficit]]s often associated with schizophrenia.<ref name="Green2006">{{vcite journal |author=Green MF |title=Cognitive impairment and functional outcome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=67 Suppl 9 |pages=3–8; discussion 36–42 |year=2006 |pmid=16965182 |url=http://greenlab.npih.ucla.edu/J%20Clin%20Psychiat%202006.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

Studies of the rare [[Pediatric schizophrenia|childhood-onset schizophrenia]] (before age 13) indicate a greater-than-normal loss of [[grey matter]] over several years, progressing from the back of the brain to the front, leveling out in early adulthood. Such a pattern of "[[Synaptic pruning|pruning]]" occurs as part of normal [[brain development]] but appears to be exaggerated in childhood-onset psychotic diagnoses, particularly schizophrenia. Abnormalities in the volume of the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] or [[frontal lobes]] have also been found in several studies but not in others. Volume changes are most likely [[glial]] and [[vascular]] rather than purely [[neuronal]], and reduction in grey matter may primarily reflect a reduction of [[neuropil]] rather than a deficit in the total number of neurons.  Other studies, especially some computational studies, have shown that a reduction in the number of neurons can cause psychotic symptoms.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Hoffman R, McGlashan T |title=Neural network models of schizophrenia. |journal=Neuroscientist |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=441–54 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11597103 |doi=10.1177/107385840100700513}}</ref> Studies to date have been based on small numbers of the most severe and treatment-resistant patients taking antipsychotics.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Arango C, Moreno C, Martínez S, ''et al'' |title=Longitudinal brain changes in early-onset psychosis |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=341–53 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18234701 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm157 |pmc=2632400}}</ref>

The most consistent volumetric findings are (first-onset patient vs control group averages), slightly less [[grey matter]] volume and slightly increased [[ventricular system|ventricular]] volume in certain areas of the brain. The two findings are thought to be linked. Although the differences are found in first-episode cases, grey matter volumes are partly a result of life experiences, drugs and malnutrition etc., so the exact role in the disorder is unclear.<ref name="Steen2006"/> 

In addition, ventricle volumes are amongst the mostly highly variable and environmentally influenced aspects of brain structure, and the percentage difference in group averages in schizophrenia studies has been described as "not a very profound difference in the context of normal variation."<ref name="Allen04">{{vcite journal |author=Allen JS, Damasio H, Grabowski TJ |title=Normal neuroanatomical variation in the human brain: an MRI-volumetric study |journal=Am.

</ref>

===MRI===
There have also been findings of differences in the size and structure of certain brain areas in schizophrenia. A 2006 metaanalysis of MRI studies found that whole brain and [[hippocampal]] volume are reduced and that [[Ventricular system|ventricular]] volume is increased in patients with a first psychotic episode relative to healthy controls. The average volumetric changes in these studies are however close to the limit of detection by MRI methods, so it remains to be determined whether schizophrenia is a neurodegenerative process that begins at about the time of symptom onset, or whether it is better characterised as a neurodevelopmental process that produces abnormal brain volumes at an early age.<ref name="Steen2006"/> In first episode psychosis typical antipsychotics like haloperidol were associated with significant reductions in gray matter volume, whereas atypical antipsychotics like olanzapine were not.<ref name="Lieberman08">{{vcite journal |author=Lieberman JA, Bymaster FP, Meltzer HY, ''et al'' |title=Antipsychotic drugs: comparison in animal models of efficacy, neurotransmitter regulation, and neuroprotection |journal=Pharmacol.

Abnormal findings in the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[temporal cortex]] and [[anterior cingulate cortex]] are found before the first onset of schizophrenia symptoms. These regions are the regions of structural deficits found in schizophrenia and first-episode patients.<ref name=Jung2010>{{vcite journal |author=Jung WH, Jang JH, Byun MS, An SK, Kwon JS |title=Structural Brain Alterations in Individuals at Ultra-high Risk for Psychosis: A Review of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies and Future Directions |journal=J.

Positive symptoms, such as thoughts of being persecuted, were found to be related to the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]], and [[hippocampus]] region. Negative symptoms were found to be related to the [[ventrolateral prefrontal cortex]] and [[ventral striatum]].<ref name=Jung2010/>

Ventricular and third ventricle enlargement, abnormal functioning of the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus,  neocortical temporal lobe regions, frontal lobe, prefontal gray matter, orbitofrontal areas, parietal lobs abnormalities and subcortical abnormalities including the cavum septi, pellucidi, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, thalamus and cerebellar abnormalities. Such abnormalities usually present in the form of loss of volume.<ref name="Shenton2001" />

Most schizophrenia studies have found average reduced volume of the left medial [[temporal lobe]] and left superior [[temporal gyrus]], and half of studies have revealed deficits in certain areas of the [[Frontal gyrus (disambiguation)|frontal gyrus]], [[parahippocampal gyrus]] and temporal gyrus.<ref name="Honea05">{{vcite journal |author=Honea R, Crow TJ, Passingham D, Mackay CE |title=Regional deficits in brain volume in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=12 |pages=2233–45 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16330585 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.12.2233 }}</ref> However, at variance with some findings in individuals with chronic schizophrenia significant group differences of [[temporal lobe]] and [[amygdala]] volumes are not shown in first-episode patients on average.<ref name="Vita06">{{vcite journal |author=Vita A, De Peri L, Silenzi C, Dieci M |title=Brain morphology in first-episode schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging studies |journal=Schizophr.

Finally, MRI studies utilizing modern cortical surface reconstruction techniques have shown widespread reduction in cerebral cortical thickness (i.e., "cortical thinning") in frontal and temporal regions<ref name="Kuperberg et al., 2003">{{vcite journal |author=Kuperberg GR, Broome MR, McGuire PK, David AS, Eddy M, Ozawa F, Goff D, West WC, Williams SC, van der Kouwe AJ, Salat DH, Dale AM, Fischl B |title=Regionally localized thinning of the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry|volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=878-88 |year=2003 |pmid=12963669}}</ref><ref name="Rimol et al., 2010">{{vcite journal |author=Rimol, L.M., Hartberg, C.B., Nesvag, R., Fennema-Notestine, C., Hagler, D.J., Jr., Pung, C.J., Jennings, R.G., Haukvik, U.K., Lange, E., Nakstad, P.H., Melle, I., Andreassen, O.A., Dale, A.M., Agartz, I |title=Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder |journal=Biol.Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=41-50 |year=2010 |pmid=20609836}}</ref> and somewhat less widespread cortical thinning in occipital and parietal regions<ref name="Rimol et al., 2010"/> in patients with schizophrenia, relative to healthy control subjects.

===fMRI===
[[File:FMRI.jpg|thumb|right|[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and other [[brain imaging]] technologies allow for the study of differences in brain activity among people diagnosed with schizophrenia]]

The use of functional MRI (fMRI) with cognitive behavioral science allows scientists to investigate and uncover areas of the brain that are not working appropriately in the schizophrenic brain, leading the behavioral deficits. Through this effort there have been several areas of the brain that are responsible for cognitive processing that have been identified to be malfunctioning in the schizophrenic brain. These studies have demonstrated abnormalities at the early steps of sensory processing. This may influence further errors when it comes to more comprehensive and complex evaluation processing, which compounds the problem.<ref name="Gur2010">{{vcite journal |author=Gur RE, Gur RC |title=Functional magnetic resonance imaging in schizophrenia |journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=333–43 |year=2010 |pmid=20954429 |pmc=3181978}}</ref>

===DT-MRI===
Diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) allows for the investigation of white matter more closely than traditional MRI.<ref name="Shenton2001" />
A 2009 meta-analysis of [[diffusion tensor imaging]] studies identified two consistent locations of reduced [[fractional anisotropy]] (roughly the level of organization of neural connections) in schizophrenia.  This suggest that two networks of [[white matter]] tracts may be affected in schizophrenia, with the potential for "disconnection" of the [[gray matter]] regions which they link.<ref name="Ellison-Wright2009">{{vcite journal |author=Ellison-Wright I, Bullmore E |title=Meta-analysis of diffusion tensor imaging studies in schizophrenia |journal=Schizophr.

PET scan findings indicate cerebral blood flow decreases in the left [[parahippocampus|parahippocampal]] region. PET scans also show a reduced ability to metabolize glucose in the [[thalamus]] and [[frontal cortex]]. PET scans also show involvement of the [[medial]] part of the left [[temporal lobe]] and the [[limbic]] and frontal systems as suffering from developmental abnormality. PET scans show thought disorders stem from increased flow in the frontal and temporal regions while delusions and hallucinations were associated with reduced flow in the cingulate, left frontal, and temporal areas. PET scans done on patient who were actively having auditory hallucinations revealed increased blood flow in both thalami, left hippocampus,  right striatum, parahippocampus, orbitofrontal, and cingulate areas.<ref name="Shenton2001" />

===CT===
Computed Tomography scans of schizophrenic brains show several pathologies. The [[brain ventricles]] are enlarged as compared to normal brains. The ventricles hold [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) and enlarged ventricles indicate a loss of brain volume. Additionally, schizophrenic brains have widened [[sulci (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] as compared to normal brains, also with increased CSF volumes and reduced brain volume.<ref name="Shenton2001" /><ref name="Adams&Victor">{{vcite book |title=Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology |edition= 8th |author= Ropper AH, Brown RH |year=2005 |publisher= McGraw-Hill |location= New York|isbn=0-07-141620-X |page=1324 |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>
