A '''club foot''', also called '''congenital talipes equinovarus''' ('''CTEV'''), is a [[congenital deformity]] involving one foot or both.<ref name="LHC">{{cite web | url = http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/1425/CTEV_Deformities_Correction | title = CTEV: Deformities & Correction | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = 2009-12-26}}</ref> The affected foot looks like it has been rotated internally at the ankle.  Without treatment, people with club feet often appear to walk on their [[ankles]] or on the sides of their feet. 

It is a relatively common [[birth defect]], occurring in about one in every 1,000 live births. Approximately half of people with clubfoot have it affect both feet, which is called [[bilateral symmetry|''bilateral'']] club foot.  In most cases it is an isolated [[dysmelia]] (disorder of the limbs).  It occurs in males twice as frequently as in females.  

A condition of the same name appears in some animals, particularly [[horse]]s.

==Classification==
TEV is classified into two groups, ''postural TEV'' and ''structural TEV''. 

The deformities affecting joints of the foot occur at three joints of the foot to varying degrees. They are<ref name="LHC" />
* inversion at [[subtalar joint]], total hindfoot inversion
* [[adduction]] at talonavicular joint, and
* [[talipes equinus|equinus]] and [[varus deformity|varus]] at [[ankle joint]], that is, a [[plantar flexion|plantar flexed]] position, making the foot tend towards [[toe walking]].<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/equinus thefreedictionary.com > equinus] Citing:
*Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. 2009, Elsevier.
*McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. 2002</ref>

==Causes==
There are different causes for clubfoot depending on what classification it is given. 

Structural cTEV is caused by [[Genetics|genetic]] factors such as [[Edwards syndrome]], a genetic defect with three copies of chromosome 18. Growth arrests at roughly 9 weeks and [[compartment syndrome]] of the affected limb are also causes of structural cTEV. Genetic influences increase dramatically with family history. cTEV occurs with some frequency in [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]] and some other [[connective tissue disorder]]s, such as [[Loeys-Dietz syndrome]].

It was previously assumed that postural cTEV could be caused by external influences in the final trimester such as intrauterine compression from [[oligohydramnios]] or from [[amniotic band syndrome]]. However, this is countered by findings that cTEV does not occur more frequently than usual when the intrauterine space is restricted.<ref>Wynne-Davies R (1972) Genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of talipes equinovarus. Clin Orthop 84: 9–13</ref> 

It may be associated with other birth defects, such as [[spina bifida]] cystica.

==Etymology==
The term ''talipes'' is from [[Latin]] [[wiktionary:talus|talus]], ''ankle'' + [[wiktionary:pes|pes]], ''foot''. [[wiktionary:equino|Equino-]], ''of or resembling a horse'' and [[wiktionary:-varus|-varus]], ''turned inward''.

A horse's hoof is a large toenail, and the horse's joint that points backwards resembles a human heel. ''[[Varus deformity|Varus]]'' means that the part distal segment of a bone or joint slants toward the body mid-line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pediatric-orthopedics.com/Treatments/Feet/Equinovarus/equinovarus.html |title=Equinovarus |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>

==Prenatal screening==
Screening for club foot prenatally is a debatable topic. However, this is commonly done as it is easily identified using an ultrasound scan. Most fetuses undergo a 20 weeks gestation fetal abnormality scan<ref>[http://pregnancysigns.blogspot.com/2011/02/ultrasound-in-pregnancy.html Use of Ultrasound in pregnancy: Pregnancy problems].</ref> in which club foot is one of the abnormalities that can be picked up. Some doctors have argued that club foot may occasionally be associated with a syndromic disease and should therefore be screened. If no syndromic association is found prenatally, most fetuses with club foot are born and can live a normal life with medical treatment.

== Treatment ==
[[File:Botas.JPG|thumb|A Denis Browne brace.  Various types of foot-abduction braces are used to hold the child's feet in the desired position.]]

As medicine evolved, club feet were treated with a complex surgical release, which had many complications.  Then a novel idea of serial casting, different from that introduced in the past (such as the Kite method) was introduced by Ponseti with dramatic results.  His results were from recognizing how the forefoot and hindfoot interact and lock into position relative to each other.  This type of treatment is generally used today for idiopathic cases of clubfoot, while treatment of neuromuscular causes (such as cerebral palsy) differ.

Clubfoot is treated with manipulation by [[Podiatry|podiatrists]], [[physiotherapists]], [[orthopedic surgeons]], specialist [[Ponseti method|Ponseti nurses]], or [[orthotists]] by serial casting and then providing braces to hold the feet in a plantigrade position.  After serial casting, bracing using a Denis Browne bar with straight last boots, ankle foot orthoses  and/or custom foot orthoses (CFO) may be used. In North America, manipulation is followed by serial casting, most often by the [[Ponseti Method]].  Foot manipulations usually begin within two weeks of birth. Even with successful treatment, when only one side is affected, that foot may be smaller than the other, and often that calf, as well.

Extensive surgery of the soft tissue or bone is not usually necessary to treat clubfoot; however, there are two minimal surgeries that may be required:
# [[Tenotomy]] (needed in 80% of cases) is a release (clipping) of the [[Achilles tendon]] – minor surgery – [[local anesthesia]]
# Anterior Tibial Tendon Transfer (needed in 20% of cases) – where the tendon is moved from the first ray (toe) to the third ray in order to release the inward traction on the foot.
Each case is different, but in most cases extensive surgery is not needed to treat clubfoot. Extensive surgery may lead to scar tissue developing inside the child's foot. The scarring may result in functional, growth and aesthetic problems in the foot because the scarred tissue will interfere with the normal development of the appendage. A child who has extensive surgery may require on average two additional surgeries to correct the issues presented above.

In stretching and casting therapy the doctor changes the cast multiple times over a few weeks, gradually stretching tendons until the foot is in the correct position of external rotation. The heel cord is released (percutaneous tenotomy) and another cast is put on, which is removed after three weeks. To avoid relapse a corrective brace is worn for a gradually reducing time until it is only at night up to four years of age.

=== Non-surgical treatment and the Ponseti Method ===

{{Main|Ponseti Method}}
Treatment for clubfoot should begin almost immediately to have the best chance for a successful outcome without the need for surgery. Over the past 10 to 15 years, more and more success has been achieved in correcting clubfeet without the need for surgery. The clubfoot treatment method that is becoming the standard in the U.S. and worldwide is known as the [[Ponseti Method]].<ref>[http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/medicaldepartments/orthopaedics/clubfeet/index.html To Parents of Children Born with Clubfeet: Orthopaedics: UI Health Topics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Foot manipulations differ subtly from the Kite casting method which prevailed during the late 20th century. Although described by Dr. [[Ignacio Ponseti]] in the 1950s, it did not reach a wider audience until it was re-popularized around 2000 by Dr. John Herzenberg in the USA and in Europe and Africa by [[National Health Service|NHS]] surgeon [[Steve Mannion]] while working in Africa. Parents of children with clubfeet using the Internet also helped the Ponseti gain wider attention. The Ponseti method, if correctly done, is successful in >95% of cases<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morcuende JA, Dolan LA, Dietz FR, Ponseti IV |title=Radical reduction in the rate of extensive corrective surgery for clubfoot using the Ponseti method |journal=Pediatrics |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=376–80 |year=2004 |pmid=14754952 |doi= 10.1542/peds.113.2.376|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/113/2/376}}</ref> in correcting clubfeet using non- or minimal-surgical techniques. Typical clubfoot cases usually require 5 casts over 4 weeks. Atypical clubfeet and complex clubfeet may require a larger number of casts. Approximately 80% of infants require an Achilles tenotomy (microscopic incision in the tendon requiring only local anesthetic and no stitches) performed in a clinic toward the end of the serial casting.

Throughout the past decade, physicians at [[Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children]] have been studying the effectiveness of both the Ponseti casting method and the French functional (physical therapy) method of stretching, massaging and taping and comparing the results with patients who have undergone surgery. Results of these studies have been presented at national and international conferences, such as the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America annual meeting, the International Clubfoot Symposium, Brandon Carrell Visiting Professorship and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual meeting, and have been published in the Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics.<ref>[http://www.tsrhc.org/center-for-excellence-in-clubfoot-research.htm Center for Excellence in Clubfoot Research at TSRHC]</ref>

After correction has been achieved, maintenance of correction may require the full-time (23 hours per day) use of a splint—also known as a foot abduction brace (FAB)—on both feet, regardless of whether the TEV is on one side or both, for several weeks after treatment. Part-time use of a brace (generally at night, usually 12 hours per day) is frequently prescribed for up to 4 years. Without the parents' participation, the clubfoot will almost certainly recur, because the muscles around the foot can pull it back into the abnormal position. Approximately 20% of infants successfully treated with the Ponseti casting method may require a surgical tendon transfer after two years of age. While this requires a general anesthetic, it is a relatively minor surgery that corrects a persistent muscle imbalance while avoiding disturbance to the joints of the foot.

The developer of the Ponseti Method,  Dr Ignacio Ponseti, was still treating children with clubfeet (including complex/atypical clubfeet and failed treatment clubfeet) at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics well into his 90s. He was assisted by Dr Jose Morcuende, president of the [http://www.ponseti.info/ Ponseti International Association].

The long-term outlook<ref>[http://www.uihealthcare.org/Clinic.aspx?id=3492 Clubfoot Clinic], accessed September 21, 2011</ref> for children who experienced the Ponseti Method treatment is comparable to that of non-affected children.<ref>[http://talipestogether.com/video?sort=highestRated Watch a Video on the Ponseti Method]</ref>

Botox is also being used as an alternative to surgery. Botox is the trade name for Botulinum Toxin type A. a chemical that acts on the nerves that control the muscle. It causes some paralysis(weakening) of the muscle by preventing muscle contractions (tightening). As part of the treatment for clubfoot, Botox is injected into the child’s calf muscle. In about 1 week the Botox weakens the Achilles tendon. This allows the foot to be turned into a normal position, over a period of 4–6 weeks, without surgery.

The weakness from a Botox injection usually lasts from 3–6 months. (Unlike surgery it has no lasting effect). Most club feet can be corrected with just one Botox injection. It is possible to do another if it is needed. There is no scar or lasting damage.<ref>[http://www.cw.bc.ca/library/pamphlets/search_view.asp?keyword=219 BC Women and Childrens Hospital]</ref>

=== Surgical treatment ===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}

On occasion, stretching, casting and bracing are not enough to correct a child's clubfoot. Surgery may be needed to adjust the tendons, ligaments and joints in the foot/ankle. Usually done at 9 to 12 months of age; surgery usually corrects all clubfoot deformities at the same time. After surgery, a cast holds the clubfoot still while it heals. It is still possible for the muscles in the child's foot to try to return to the clubfoot position, and special shoes or braces will likely be used for up to a year or more after surgery. Surgery will likely result in a stiffer foot than nonsurgical treatment, particularly over time.

Without any treatment, a child's clubfoot will result in severe functional disability, however with treatment, the child should have a nearly normal foot. He or she can run and play without pain and wear normal shoes. The corrected clubfoot will still not be perfect, however; a clubfoot usually stays 1 to 1½ sizes smaller and somewhat less mobile than a normal foot. The calf muscles in a leg with a clubfoot will also stay smaller.

Long-term studies of adults with post-club feet, especially those with substantial numbers of surgeries, may not fare as well in the long term, according to Dobbs, et al.,<ref>J Bone Joint Surg Am. 2006 May;88(5):986-96.
Long-term follow-up of patients with clubfeet treated with extensive soft-tissue release. Dobbs MB, Nunley R, Schoenecker PL. Source Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, One Children's Place, Suite 4S20, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.</ref> A percentage of adults may require additional surgeries as they age, though there is some dispute as to the effectiveness of such surgeries, in light of the prevalence of scar tissue present from earlier surgeries. 

In some cases the leg stops developing earlier than the healthy leg and a substantial length difference may occur.  In come cases a leg lengthening will be necessary, most commonly by use of the [[Ilizarov apparatus|Ilizarov]] method.

==World Clubfoot Day ==

World Clubfood Day was introduced in 2013 by Ponseti International Association and is celebrated on June 3rd every year. This date was chosen following the signing of the Iowa Clubfoot Declaration during the 2nd International Clubfoot Symposium held in Iowa City, Iowa, USA, on October 4 – 5, 2012. The date commemorates the birthday of Dr. [[Ignacio Ponseti]], M.D. (1914-2009), the developer of the Ponseti Method to treat clubfoot.

The goal of World Clubfoot Day is to raise awareness about clubfoot disability and its prevention using the Ponseti Method, a non-surgical treatment that includes gentle manipulation of the feet followed by the application of plaster casts and temporary bracing. Clubfoot is the most common musculoskeletal birth deformity, affecting 200,000 newborn children each year, 80% in developing countries. There are also hundreds of thousands of children and young adults who are living with this debilitating condition worldwide. The Ponseti Method is nearly 100% effective when properly applied by a trained health care provider and is considered the "gold standard" treatment, leading to a normal, productive life.

==History==
Treatment of clubfoot is evident as early as Egyptian paintings.  In early days, the foot was manipulated with a Thomas wrench and casting which caused fracture of several bones in the foot.

The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] had a deformity caused by a botched operation for the bacterial infection [[osteomyelitis]], which some mistook for clubfoot.<ref>Goebbels is commonly said to have had club foot (''talipes equinovarus''), a congenital condition. But William L. Shirer, who spent the 1930s in Berlin as a journalist and was acquainted with Goebbels, wrote in ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (Simon and Schuster 1960) that the deformity arose from a childhood attack of [[osteomyelitis]] and a botched operation to correct it.  Osteomyelitis, an infection within the bone marrow, can cause the destruction of one or more of the growing points in the long bones of the leg, a condition known as ''septic osteoblastic dysgenesis.'' This will result in a shortened leg.</ref>

==In animals==
[[File:Bockhufe.jpg|thumb|left|Severe club foot in a [[pony]], probably congenital in origin]]
[[File:Halfarabianwithhighheel.jpg|180px|thumb|Apparent club foot, thought to be from post-natal environmental conditions, not congenital]]
[[File:PolishedHooves.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Left hoof normal, right hoof possible grade one club foot]]

Club feet occur in other animals, notably [[equus (genus)|equines]].  The condition is characterized by a strongly upright [[pastern]] and a corresponding rotation of the [[coffin bone]] in the [[horse hoof|hoof]]. The condition often affects only one foot.  Severity varies, with some animals usable for work or riding, and others unsound for life.  Careful [[farrier]] work on the hooves can lessen the severity of many cases, and in certain circumstances surgery may be beneficial.  The visible outward appearance of a club foot has different possible origins that include a genetic predisposition to the condition, a congenital defect formed while the animal is in the womb, or problems with diet and bone development during the early post-natal period.  Certain horse breeds appear to be more predisposed to the condition than others, but research has yet to identify the genes involved.

A grading scale exists to assess the severity of club feet, which are caused by a deep digital flexor contraction syndrome. When the muscle fibers of the upper leg's deep digital flexor muscle contract excessively, this affects [[Muscular system of the horse#Tendons of the lower leg|the tendon of the same name]] that comes off of this muscle group and attaches at the bottom of the coffin bone. A constant upward pull by the tendon on the coffin bone and other structure of the horse's hoof creates the condition. While many young [[foal]]s are born with somewhat upright pasterns, the condition may resolve naturally or with minimal intervention if begun early.  However, some cases are so severe that more drastic treatment may be required.<ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=11882 Redden, R.F.
