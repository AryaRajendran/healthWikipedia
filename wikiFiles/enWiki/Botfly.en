'''Oestridae''' are a family of flies variously known as '''bot flies''', '''warble flies''', '''heel flies''', '''gadflies''' and similar names.  Their [[larva]]e are internal parasites of mammals, some species growing in the host's flesh and others within the gut.
The human botfly, ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'', is the only species of bot fly known to parasitize humans routinely, though other species of fly do cause [[myiasis]] in humans.

The life cycles vary greatly according to species, but the [[larva]]e of all species are internal parasites of mammals. Largely according to species they also are known variously as '''warble flies''', '''heel flies''', and '''gadflies'''. The larvae of some species grow in the flesh of their hosts, while others grow within the hosts' [[Gut (anatomy)|alimentary tracts]].

The word "bot" in this sense means a maggot.<ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"/> A warble is a skin lump or callus such as might be caused by an ill-fitting harness, or by the presence of a warble fly maggot under the skin. 
The human botfly, ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'', is the only species of bot fly whose larvae ordinarily parasitise humans, though flies in some other families episodically cause human myiasis, and sometimes more harmfully.

==Family Oestridae==
The Oestridae now are generally defined as including  the former families [[Oestrinae|Oestridae]], [[Cuterebrinae|Cuterebridae]], [[Gasterophilinae|Gasterophilidae]], and [[Hypodermatinae|Hypodermatidae]] as [[Family (biology)|subfamilies]]. 

The Oestridae in turn are a family within the superfamily [[Oestroidea]], together with the families [[Calliphoridae]], [[Rhinophoridae]], [[Flesh-fly|Sarcophagidae]], and [[Tachinidae]]. 

Of families of flies causing [[Myiasis]], the Oestridae include the highest proportion of species whose [[larva]]e live as obligate [[parasite]]s within the bodies of [[mammal]]s. There are roughly 150 known species worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pape |first=Thomas |year=2001 |month=April |title=Phylogeny of Oestridae (Insecta: Diptera) |journal=[[Systematic Entomology]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=133–171 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3113.2001.00143.x}}</ref> Most other species of flies implicated in myiasis are members of related families, such as blowflies and screwworm flies in the [[Calliphoridae]].

== Infestation ==
[[File:Magendassel.jpg|right|thumb||Larval stage of ''Gasterophilus intestinalis'']]
Botflies deposit eggs on a host, or sometimes use an intermediate vector such as the common [[housefly]], mosquitoes and even a species of tick (see ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]''). The smaller fly is firmly held by the botfly female and rotated to a position where the botfly attaches some 30 eggs to the body under the wings. Larvae from these eggs, stimulated by the warmth and  proximity of a large mammal host, drop onto its skin and burrow underneath.<ref>{{cite video |people=Dunleavy, Stephen (producer) |date=2005-10-20 |title=Life In The Undergrowth: Intimate Relations (Programme synopses) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/10_october/20/life_synopses.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> Intermediate vectors are often used since a number of animal hosts recognise the approach of a botfly and flee.<ref>http://insects.tamu.edu/fieldguide/cimg241.html</ref>

Eggs are deposited on animal [[skin]] directly, or the [[larva]]e hatch and drop from the eggs attached to the intermediate vector: the body heat of the host animal induces hatching upon contact or immediate proximity. Some forms of botfly also occur in the [[digestive tract]] after ingestion by licking.

''[[Myiasis]]'' can be caused by larvae burrowing into the skin (or tissue lining) of the host animal. Mature larvae drop from the host and complete the [[pupa]]l stage in soil. They do not kill the host animal, and thus are true [[Parasitism|parasites]].

The equine bot fly presents seasonal difficulties to [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] caretakers, as it lays eggs on the insides of horse's front legs, on the [[cannon bone]] and [[knees]], and sometimes on the [[throat]] or [[nose]], depending on the species of bot fly. These eggs, which look like small, yellow drops of paint, must be carefully removed during the laying season (late summer and early fall) to prevent infestation in the horse. When a horse rubs its nose on its legs, the eggs are transferred to the mouth, and from there to the [[intestines]], where the [[larvae]] grow and attach themselves to the stomach's lining or they pass into the small intestine and attach there. The attachment of the larvae to the tissue produces a mild irritation which results in erosions and ulcerations at this site.<ref name="Ondrak">{{cite article |last=Ondrak |first=Julie |title=Ask The Vet: Treating Bot Infestations In Horses |url=http://www.lambriarvet.com/vet-equine-bots.php |accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref> Removal of the eggs (which adhere to the host's hair) is difficult, since the bone and [[tendons]] are directly under the skin on the cannon bones: eggs must be removed with a sharp knife (often a razor blade) or rough sand paper, and caught before they reach the ground. The larvae remain attached and develop for 10–12 months before they are passed out in the feces. Occasionally horse owners will report seeing the bot fly larvae in horse manure. These larvae are cylindrical in shape and are reddish orange in color. In 1–2 months adult bot flies will emerge from the developing larvae and the cycle will repeat.<ref name="Ondrak"/> Bots can be controlled with several types of dewormers, including [[dichlorvos]], [[ivermectin]] and [[trichlorfon]].

In cattle, the lesions caused by these flies can become infected by ''[[Mannheimia granulomatis]]'', a [[bacterium]] that causes [[lechiguana]], characterized by rapid-growing hard lumps beneath the skin of the animal. Without antibiotics an affected animal will die within 3–11 months.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ross |last=Piper |chapter=Human Botfly |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=eqegRf2UstIC&pg=PA192 |title=Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=[[Westport, Connecticut]] |year=2007 |pages=192–194 |isbn=0-313-33922-8 |oclc=191846476 |accessdate=2009-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=F. |last=Riet-Correa |coauthors=S.

The [[human botfly]] occasionally uses humans as the host to its larvae. The [[larva]], because of its spines, can pose an extremely painful sub-epidermal condition. One removal method is to use the tree sap of the ''mata[[torsalo]]'', found in Costa Rica, which is reputed to kill the larva, yet leave its body in the skin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pariser |first=Harry S |year=2006 |title=Explore Costa Rica |publisher=Manatee Press |isbn=1-893643-55-7}}</ref> Additionally, one can attempt to seal the breathing hole of the larva with [[nail polish]] or [[vaseline]] and then, after a day, squeeze out the suffocated, dead larva.<ref>http://www.vexman.com/botfly.htm</ref> Use of [[adhesive tape]] can work, but carries additional risk of infection because portions of the larva's [[Siphon (insect)|breathing tube]] can be broken off by the tape and make the remainder of the body difficult to remove.

==Uses by humans==
In cold climates supporting [[reindeer]] or [[caribou]]-reliant populations, large quantities of ''Hypoderma tarandi'' ([[warble fly]]) maggots are available to human populations during the butchery of animals. These are relished in modern times by some as important seasonal luxuries containing high levels of protein, fats and salt. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The sixth episode of season one of the television series "[[Beyond Survival]]" entitled "The Inuit - Survivors of the Future" features survival expert [[Les Stroud]] and two Inuit guides hunting caribou on the northern coast of [[Baffin Island]] near [[Pond Inlet]], [[Nunavut]], [[Canada]]. Upon skinning and butchering of one of the animals, numerous larvae (presumably ''Hypoderma tarandi'' although not explicitly stated) are apparent on the inside of the caribou pelt. Stroud and his two Inuit guides eat (albeit somewhat reluctantly) one larva each, with Stroud commenting that the larva "tastes like milk" and was historically commonly consumed by the Inuit people.<ref>http://lesstroud.ca/beyondsurvival/ep6.php</ref>

Copious art dating back to the [[Pleistocene]] in Europe confirms their importance in premodern times as well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=Russell Dale |year=2005 |title=The Nature of Paleolithic Art |location=[[Chicago]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#PPA6,M1 6] |isbn=0-226-31126-0}}</ref>
