'''''Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare'' infection''' (MAI)<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/222664-overview Medscape Reference - Mycobacterium Avium-Intracellulare] Author: Janak Koirala, MD, MPH, FACP, FIDSA; Chief Editor: Burke A Cunha, MD, Updated: Jan 12, 2011</ref> is an atypical [[mycobacterial]] [[infection]] which can occur in the later stages of [[AIDS]]. It can also affect people who do not have AIDS, and usually first presents as a persistent cough. Additionally, cases in elderly men have increased recently.  It is typically treated with a series of three antibiotics for a period of at least six months.

''[[Mycobacterium avium]]'' and ''[[Mycobacterium intracellulare|M. intracellulare]]'' (the ''M. a.'' complex - MAC) are [[saprotrophic]] [[organism]]s present in soil and water; entry into hosts is usually via the [[gastrointestinal tract]], but also can be via the [[lung]]s. 

The MAC causes [[fever]]s, [[diarrhea]], [[malabsorption]] and [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], and can disseminate to the [[bone marrow]]. Therapy for MAI is typically resistant to standard mycobacterial therapies.

MAC bacteria are common in the environment and cause [[infection]] when inhaled or swallowed. Symptoms are reminiscent of [[tuberculosis]] (TB), and include fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Many patients will have [[anemia]] and [[neutropenia]] if bone marrow is involved. Pulmonary involvement is similar to TB, while diarrhea and abdominal pain are associated with gastrointestinal involvement. MAC bacteria should always be considered in a person with [[HIV]] infection presenting with diarrhea. Recently, ''M. avium'' has been found to deposit and grow in bathroom shower heads from which it may be easily aerosolized and inhaled.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090915/ap_on_sc/us_sci_germs_in_the_shower Showerheads may harbor bacteria dangerous to some] By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, AP Science Writer Randolph E. Schmid, Ap Science Writer – Mon Sep 14, 9:19 pm ET</ref>

The various subspecies of ''M. avium'' are prevalent in different areas:
* ''M. a. avium'' (MAA) primarily affects [[bird]]s, but has also been found in [[ruminant]] [[mammal]]s, especially [[deer]].
* ''M. a. paratuberculosis'' (MAP) causes paratuberculosis, or [[Johne's Disease]], and also is usually found in mammals.

MAI is common in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] individuals, including [[senior citizens]] and those suffering from [[HIV]] or [[cystic fibrosis]]; however, these diseases, particularly Lady Windermere syndrome, do not require the individual to be immunocompromised.

== ''Mycobacterium avium'' infection in children ==
''M. avium'' and ''M. haemophilum'' infections in children form a distinct clinical entity, not associated with abnormalities of the immune system. ''M. avium'' typically causes unilateral swelling of one of the lymph nodes of the neck. This node is firm at the beginning, but a '''collarstud abscess'''  is formed eventually, which is a characteristic blue-purple in colour with multiple discharging sinuses. The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the affected lymph nodes,<ref name="Lindeboom2007">{{cite journal | author=Lindeboom JA, Kuijper EJ, van Coppenraet ESB, Lindeboom R, Prins JM | title=Surgical excision versus antibiotic treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterial cervicofacial lymphadenitis in children: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2007 | volume=44 | issue=8 | pages=1057&ndash;64 | pmid=17366449 | url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/512675 | doi=10.1086/512675}}</ref> with antibiotic treatment (usually [[clarithromycin]] and [[rifabutin]] for 18 to 24 months) reserved for those patients who cannot have surgery.

== MAC in patients with HIV infection ==
MAC in patients with [[HIV]] disease is theorized to represent recent acquisition rather than latent infection reactivating (which is the case in many other [[opportunistic infection]]s in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] patients).

The risk of MAC is inversely related to the patient's [[CD4]] count, and increases significantly when the CD4 count decreases below 50 cells/mm³. Other risk factors for acquisition of MAC infection include using an indoor [[swimming pool]], consumption of raw or partially cooked fish or shellfish, [[bronchoscopy]] and treatment with [[granulocyte stimulating factor]].

[[Disseminated disease]] was previously the common presentation prior to the advent of [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]] (HAART). Today, in regions where HAART is the standard of care, localized disease presentation is more likely. This generally includes a focal [[lymphadenopathy]]/lymphadenitis.

AIDS patients are given [[macrolide antibiotics]] such as [[azithromycin]] for prophylactic treatment.

===Diagnosis===

Diagnosis can be achieved through blood cultures, or cultures of other bodily fluids such as [[sputum]]. [[Bone marrow]] culture can often yield an earlier diagnosis, but is usually avoided as an initial diagnostic step because of its invasiveness.

==Prophylaxis==
[[Clarithromycin]] or [[azithromycin]] may be used for prophylaxis.<ref name="VolberdingSande2008">{{cite book|author1=Paul Volberding|author2=Merle A. Sande|title=Global HIV/AIDS medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fNU62HhYFT0C&pg=PA361|accessdate=5 November 2010|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4160-2882-6|pages=361–}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Postinfection treatment involves a combination of antituberculosis [[antibiotics]], including [[rifampicin]], [[rifabutin]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[amikacin]], [[ethambutol]], [[streptomycin]], clarithromycin or azithromycin.

=== Classification ===

Lady Windermere syndrome is a type of [[mycobacteria]]l lung infection.<ref name="BTS">{{cite journal |author= Subcommittee Of The Joint Tuberculosis Committee Of The British Thoracic Society,|title=Management of opportunist mycobacterial infections: Joint Tuberculosis Committee Guidelines 1999.

=== Pathophysiology ===
[[Mycobacterium avium]] complex is the most commonly found form of [[non-tuberculous mycobacteria]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wickremasinghe M, Ozerovitch LJ, Davies G, ''et al.'' |title=Non-tuberculous mycobacteria in patients with bronchiectasis |journal=Thorax |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=1045–51 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16227333 |doi=10.1136/thx.2005.046631 |url= |pmc=1747265}}</ref>

Immunodeficiency is not a requirement for MAI.<ref name="pmid16127595">{{cite journal |author=Martins AB, Matos ED, Lemos AC |title=Infection with the Mycobacterium avium complex in patients without predisposing conditions: a case report and literature review |journal=Braz J Infect Dis |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=173–9 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=16127595 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-86702005000200009&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>

''Mycobacterium avium'' complex (MAC) usually affects patients with abnormal [[lung]]s or [[bronchi]]. However, Candace Baker, Jerome Reich and Richard Johnson describe a series of six patients with MAC infection of the right middle lobe or left lingula who did not have any predisposing lung disorders.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The right middle [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobe]] and left lingula of the lungs are served by bronchi that are oriented downward when a person is in the upright position. As a result, these areas of the lung may be more dependent upon vigorous voluntary expectoration ([[cough]]) for clearance of bacteria and secretions. 

Since the six patients in their retrospective case series were older females, Reich and Johnson and Baker propose that patients without a vigorous cough may develop right middle lobe or left lingular infection with MAC. They propose this syndrome be named Lady Windermere syndrome, after the character Lady Windermere in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play [[Lady Windermere's Fan]].

=== Diagnosis ===

The diagnosis requires consistent symptoms with two additional signs:

*[[Chest X-ray]] or [[CT scan]] showing evidence of right middle lobe (or left lingular lobe) lung infection
*[[Sputum culture]] or [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] culture demonstrating the infection is caused by MAC

=== Treatment ===

Lady Windermere syndrome is usually treated with a three-drug regimen of either clarithromycin or azithromycin, plus [[rifampicin]] and [[ethambutol]]. Treatment typically lasts at least 12 months.

=== Literary reference ===

The original ''Chest'' article proposing the existence and [[pathophysiology]] of the Lady Windermere syndrome suggested the character Lady Windermere in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s Victorian-era play [[Lady Windermere's Fan]] is a good example of the fastidious behavior believed to cause the syndrome. The article states:
: We offer the term, Lady Windermere's Syndrome, from the Victorian-era play,'' Lady Windermere's Fan'', to convey the fastidious behavior hypothesized: "How do you do, Lord Darlington. No, I can't shake hands with you. My hands are all wet with the roses."

Victorian women presumably believed "Ladies don't spit," and consequently might have been predisposed to develop lung infection.

Shortly after the Lady Windermere syndrome was proposed, a librarian wrote a letter to the editor of ''Chest''<ref name="urlChest -- eLetters for Reich and Johnson, 101 (6) 1605-1609">{{cite web |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/eletters/101/6/1605#85 |title=Chest -- eLetters for Reich and Johnson, 101 (6) 1605-1609 |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> challenging the use of Lady Windermere as the eponymous ancestor of the proposed syndrome.  In the play, Lady Windermere is a vivacious young woman, married only two years, who never coughs or displays any other signs of illness. While her avoidance of shaking hands might be interpreted as "fastidiousness", two alternative explanations may be just as probable: 
:1) Lady Windermere actually '''is''' in the midst of arranging flowers and consequently cannot properly greet her guest:

::[''LADY WINDERMERE is at table R., arranging roses in a blue bowl''.]<ref name="urlOscar Wilde: Lady Windermeres Fan: ACT I. Morning-room in Lord Windermeres house. - Free Online Library">{{cite web |url=http://wilde.thefreelibrary.com/Lady-Windermeres-Fan/1-1 |title=Oscar Wilde: Lady Windermere's Fan: ACT I. Morning-room in Lord Windermere's house. - Free Online Library |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

:2) Lady Windermere wishes to discourage the flirtatious advances of her would-be suitor Lord Darlington and cites her wet hands as an excuse to keep him from touching her:

::''LADY WINDERMERE. Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the Foreign Office. I am afraid you are going to annoy me again. . . .

::''LORD DARLINGTON. [Takes chair and goes across L.C.] I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere. You must tell me what I did. [Sits down at table L.]

::''LADY WINDERMERE. Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening.]''<ref name="urlOscar Wilde: Lady Windermeres Fan: ACT I. Morning-room in Lord Windermeres house. - Free Online Library"/>

The scholars highlight the literary [[malapropism]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/ids/exhibits/250/Vol_III_No_9.doc |title=oscholars |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> but some in the medical community have adopted the term regardless, and peer-reviewed medical journals still sometimes mention the Lady Windermere syndrome.<ref name="pmid18515557">{{cite journal |author=Sexton P, Harrison AC |title=Susceptibility to nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease |journal=Eur.

In recent years, some have described the eponym as inappropriate,<ref name="pmid18301826">{{cite journal |author=Kasthoori JJ, Liam CK, Wastie ML |title=Lady Windermere syndrome: an inappropriate eponym for an increasingly important condition |journal=Singapore Med J |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=e47–9 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18301826 |doi= |url=http://smj.sma.org.sg/4902/4902cr6.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> and some have noted that it would have been unlikely that Lady Windermere had the condition to which her name was assigned.<ref name="pmid17035420">{{cite journal |author=Rubin BK |title=Did Lady Windermere have cystic fibrosis? |journal=Chest |volume=130 |issue=4 |pages=937–8 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17035420 |doi=10.1378/chest.130.4.937 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17035420}}</ref>
