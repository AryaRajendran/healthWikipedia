== [[:it:Benedetto Strampelli|Benedetto Strampelli]] ==

The procedure was pioneered by the Italian ophthalmic surgeon Professor Benedetto Strampelli<ref>http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Strampelli</ref>in Rome in the early 1960s.

The son of the geneticist and agronomist [[Nazareno Strampelli]], Benedetto Strampelli held the chair of ophthalmic surgery at Rome's Ospedale di San Giovanni in Laterano where he was one of the first surgeons in Italy to transplant cornea. In 1953 he was the first Italian to implant IOLs which were manufactured to his own design by [[Rayner (company)|Rayners]] in UK. Strampelli was a founder-member with [[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Harold Ridley]] and Peter Choyce of [[The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club (IIIC)|the International Intra-Ocular Implant Club]] (IIIC) in 1966.

== Indications and prognosis ==

An operation to graft the OOKP is undertaken in severe [[pemphigoid]], [[chemical burn]]s, [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[trachoma]], [[Toxic epidermal necrolysis|Lyell syndrome]] and multiple [[corneal graft]] failure.<!--

There is a significant risk of anatomical failure of lamina in the long term, estimated at about 19% in a small study,<!--

--> with the main risks being laminar [[resorption]], particularly in [[allograft]]s, and [[glaucoma]]. Another, bigger study comparing OOKP with the lesser known osteo-keratoprosthesis (OKP) in 145 and 82 patients and follow-up terms up to 10 years yielded following statistics:
* 10-year anatomical survival: 66% for OOKP and 47% for OKP,
*  2-year functional survival: 63% for OOKP and 49% for OKP,
* 10-year functional survival: 38% for OOKP and 17% for OKP,
with functional survival defined as best corrected visual acuity above 0.05.<!--

==Procedure==
OOKP is a complex two stage operation which was pioneered in Italy in 1963 by Professor Benedetto Strampelli.<!--

'''Stage 1''' of the surgery involves 5 separate procedures:

# The eye is opened up and the entire inner surface of the eyelids, corneal surface and all scar tissue is removed
# Inner mucosal lining of the cheek is transplanted onto the new surface of the eye
# A [[canine tooth|canine]] or [[premolar]] tooth and part of the adjacent bone and ligaments are removed
# A bolt-shaped structure is fashioned from the tooth-bone complex which is fitted with a plastic optical cylinder
# The tooth-bone-cylinder complex is implanted into the patient's cheek to grow a new blood supply

'''Stage 2''' (about 4 months later) involves 2 separate procedures:

# The cheek mucosal lining over the eye is opened and the inner contents of the eye are removed
# The tooth-bone-cylinder complex is removed from the cheek and inserted into the eye, the mucosal cheek lining is replaced over the implant.

At the end of the procedure, light can now enter through the plastic cylinder, and the patient is able to see through this cylinder with good vision.<ref name="NDC"/>
