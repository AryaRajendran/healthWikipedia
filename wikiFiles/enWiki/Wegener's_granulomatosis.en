'''Wegener's granulomatosis''' (WG), more recently '''granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's)''' (GPA), is a form of [[vasculitis]] (inflammation of blood vessels) that affects small- and medium-sized vessels in many organs. Damage to the [[lung]]s and [[kidney]]s can be fatal. It requires long-term [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=Seo>{{cite journal |author=Seo P, Stone JH |title=The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=39–50 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15210387 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.02.030}}</ref> Five-year survival is up to 87%, with some of the mortality due to toxicity of treatment. It is named after [[Friedrich Wegener]], who described the disease in 1936.<ref name=Enersen>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2823}}</ref> Because of Wegener's Nazi past, professional bodies have advocated replacing his name with a descriptive name.<ref name=ARD11/>  

Wegener's granulomatosis is part of a larger group of vasculitic syndromes, all of which feature an autoimmune attack by an abnormal type of circulating [[antibody]] termed [[antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|ANCA]]s (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) against small and medium-size [[blood vessel]]s. Apart from Wegener's, this category includes [[Churg–Strauss syndrome]] and [[microscopic polyangiitis]].<ref name=Seo/> Although Wegener's granulomatosis affects small and medium-sized vessels,<ref name="urlWegeners Granulomatosis: Vasculitis: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec04/ch033/ch033k.html |title=Wegener's Granulomatosis: Vasculitis: Merck Manual Professional |work= |accessdate=2009-01-08}}</ref> it is formally classified as one of the small vessel vasculitides in the Chapel Hill system.<ref name="isbn0-7817-4750-3">{{cite book |author=Silva, Fred; Jennette, J.

==Signs and symptoms==
Initial signs are extremely variable, and diagnosis can be severely delayed due to the nonspecific nature of the [[symptom]]s. [[Rhinitis]] is generally the first sign in most patients.<ref name=Seo/>
* [[Kidney]]: [[rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis]] (75%), leading to [[chronic renal failure]]
* [[Respiratory tract|Upper airway]], [[human eye|eye]] and [[ear]] disease:
** Nose: pain, stuffiness, [[nosebleed]]s, rhinitis, crusting, ''[[saddle-nose]]'' deformity due to a [[perforated septum]]
** Ears: conductive [[hearing loss]] due to [[auditory tube]] dysfunction, sensorineural hearing loss (unclear mechanism)
**Oral cavity: strawberry gingivitis, underlying bone destruction with loosening of teeth, non-specific ulcerations throughout oral mucosa
** Eyes: pseudotumours, [[scleritis]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[uveitis]], [[episcleritis]]
* [[Vertebrate trachea|Trachea]]: subglottal [[stenosis]]
* [[Lung]]s: pulmonary nodules (referred to as "coin lesions"), infiltrates (often interpreted as [[pneumonia]]), cavitary lesions, [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] causing [[hemoptysis]], and rarely bronchial stenosis.
* [[Arthritis]]: Pain or swelling (60%), often initially diagnosed as [[rheumatoid arthritis]]
* [[Human skin|Skin]]: nodules on the elbow, [[purpura]], various others (see ''[[cutaneous vasculitis]]'')
* [[Nervous system]]: occasionally [[sensory neuropathy]] (10%) and rarely [[mononeuritis multiplex]]
* [[Human heart|Heart]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], [[Human brain|brain]], other organs: rarely affected.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image: C anca.jpg | thumb | right | Immunofluorescence pattern produced by binding of ANCA to ethanol-fixed neutrophils, from a patient with Wegener's Granulomatosis.]]
[[Image:Sclerokeratitis.jpg|thumb|right|Photo showing the sclerokeratitis associated with Wegener's granulomatosis.]]
Wegener's granulomatosis is usually suspected only when a patient has had unexplained symptoms for a long period of time. Determination of [[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs)]] can aid in the diagnosis, but positivity is not conclusive and negative ANCAs are not sufficient to reject the diagnosis. Cytoplasmic staining ANCAs that react with the enzyme [[proteinase 3]] (cANCA) in [[neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]] (a type of [[white blood cell]]) are associated with Wegener's.<ref name=Seo/>

If the patient has [[chronic renal failure|renal failure]] or [[cutaneous vasculitis]], these are the most logical organs to obtain a [[biopsy]] from. Rarely, [[thoracoscopy|thoracoscopic]] lung biopsy is required. On [[histopathology|histopathological]] examination, a biopsy will show ''leukocytoclastic vasculitis'' with [[necrosis|necrotic]] changes and [[granuloma]]tous [[inflammation]] (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on [[light microscopy|microscopy]]. These granulomas are the main reason for the appellation of "Wegener's granulomatosis", although it is not an essential feature. Unfortunately, many biopsies can be nonspecific and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of Wegener's.<ref name=Seo/>

[[Differential diagnosis]] (alternative possible diagnoses) can be extensive. ANCAs can be positive after the use of certain drugs and other forms of [[vasculitis]] can present with very similar symptoms. The [[saddle-nose]] deformity may also be seen in relapsing polychondritis, [[cocaine]] abuse and in [[congenital syphilis]].

==Criteria==
In 1990, the [[American College of Rheumatology]] accepted classification criteria for Wegener's. These criteria were not intended for diagnosis, but for inclusion in [[randomised controlled trial]]s. Two or more positive criteria have a [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 92.0%]] of describing Wegener's.<ref name=Leavitt>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/art.1780330807 |author=Leavitt RY, Fauci AS, Bloch DA, ''et al.'' |title=The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of Wegener's granulomatosis |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=1101–7 |year=1990 |month=August |pmid=2202308}}</ref>
* Nasal or oral inflammation:
** painful or painless oral ulcers ''or''
** [[purulent]] or bloody nasal discharge
* Lungs: abnormal chest X-ray with:
** nodules,
** infiltrates ''or''
** cavities
* Kidneys: urinary sediment with:
** [[microhematuria]] ''or''
** red cell [[urinary casts|casts]]
* Biopsy: granulomatous inflammation
** within the arterial wall ''or''
** in the perivascular area

According to the [[Chapel Hill Consensus Conference]] (CHCC) on the nomenclature of systemic vasculitis (1992), establishing the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis demands:<ref name=Jenette>{{cite journal |author=Jennette JC, Falk RJ, Andrassy K, ''et al.'' |title=Nomenclature of systemic vasculitides. Proposal of an international consensus conference |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=187–92 |year=1994 |month=February |pmid=8129773 |doi=10.1002/art.1780370206}}</ref>
* a [[granulomatous]] inflammation involving the respiratory tract, and
* a [[vasculitis]] of small to medium-size vessels.

Several investigators have compared the ACR and Chapel Hill criteria.<ref name=Bruce>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/36.4.453 |author=Bruce IN, Bell AL |title=A comparison of two nomenclature systems for primary systemic vasculitis |journal=Br. J. Rheumatol. |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=453–8 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=9159539}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Inflammation]] with [[granuloma]] formation against a nonspecific inflammatory background is the classical tissue abnormality in all organs affected by Wegener's granulomatosis.<ref name=Seo/>

It is now widely presumed that the [[anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies]] (ANCAs) are responsible for the inflammation in Wegener's.<ref name=Seo/> The typical ANCAs in Wegener's are those that react with [[proteinase 3]], an enzyme prevalent in [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s.<ref name=vanderWoude>{{cite journal |author=van der Woude FJ, Rasmussen N, Lobatto S, ''et al.'' |title=Autoantibodies against neutrophils and monocytes: tool for diagnosis and marker of disease activity in Wegener's granulomatosis |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8426 |pages=425–9 |year=1985 |month=February |pmid=2857806 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(85)91147-X}}</ref> This type of ANCA is also known as cANCA, with the ''c'' indicating ''[[cytoplasm]]ic'' (in contrast to pANCA, which is ''perinuclear'').

''In vitro'' studies have found that ANCAs can activate [[neutrophils]], increase their adherence to [[endothelium]], and induce their degranulation that can damage [[endothelial cell]]s. In theory, this phenomenon could cause extensive damage to the vessel wall, particularly of [[arteriole]]s.<ref name=Seo/> However, the presence of ANCA bound to circulating neutrophils has never been found, the activation status of neutrophils from patients with high ANCA titer does not differ from normal individuals and the presence of ANCA is not always associated with development of vasculitis.

The exact cause for the production of ANCAs is unknown, although some [[medication|drugs]] have been implicated in secondary forms of Wegener's. As with many [[autoimmune disorder]]s, the cause is probably genetic predisposition combined with [[molecular mimicry]] caused by a [[virus]] or [[bacterium]].

==Treatment==
Before steroid treatment became available, mortality within one year was over 90%, with average survival being 5 months. Steroids prolonged average survival to 8 months. The introduction of [[cyclophosphamide]] (CYC) in the 1970s was a major breakthrough. Five-year survival is now 87%.<ref name=Bosch>{{cite journal
 |author=Bosch X, Guilabert A, Espinosa G, Mirapeix E
 |title=Treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis: a systematic review
 |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=6 |pages=655–69 |year=2007 |pmid=17684188 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.6.655}}</ref>

Initial treatment is generally with [[corticosteroids]] and oral CYC, 1&nbsp;mg/kg/day and 2&nbsp;mg/kg/day, respectively. Occasionally CYC is given in monthly intravenous (IV) doses. Monitoring of the [[white blood cell|white blood count]] is essential during CYC therapy.  Once remission is attained (normally 3 to 6 months), treatment is frequently changed to [[azathioprine]] or [[methotrexate]], which are less toxic drugs.  Total duration of therapy should be at least one year, or longer in high risk patients.  Corticosteroids are tapered to a low maintenance dose, 5–10&nbsp;mg/day. [[Plasmapheresis]] may be beneficial in severe disease or [[pulmonary hemorrhage]]. Experience with other treatment agents is very limited.<ref name=Seo/>

A [[systematic review]] of 84 trials examined the evidence for various treatments in Wegener's granulomatosis. Many trials include data on pooled groups of patients with Wegener's and microscopic polyangiitis. In this review, cases are divided between localized disease, non-organ threatening, generalized organ-threatening disease and severe renal vasculitis and immediately life-threatening disease.<ref name=Bosch/>
* In localized disease, treatment with the antibiotic [[co-trimoxazole]] is recommended, with steroids in case of treatment failure.<ref name="pmid8637536">{{cite journal

* In generalized non-organ threatening disease, remission can be induced with [[methotrexate]] and steroids, where the steroid dose is reduced after a remission has been achieved and methotrexate used as maintenance.
* In case of organ-threatening disease, pulsed [[intravenous]] cyclophosphamide with steroids is recommended. Once remission has been achieved, [[azathioprine]] and steroids can be used to maintain remission.
* In severe renal vasculitis, the same regimen is used but with the addition of [[plasma exchange]].
* In [[pulmonary hemorrhage]], high doses of cyclophosphamide with pulsed [[methylprednisolone]] may be used, or alternatively CYC, steroids, and plasma exchange.

In severe disease not responsive to previously mentioned treatment, the review is positive about [[mycophenolate mofetil]], [[15-deoxyspergualin]], [[anti-thymocyte globulin]], [[rituximab]] and [[infliximab]]; data was less favourable for [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG) and [[etanercept]].<ref name=Bosch/>

In some patients with severe subglottic stenosis, [[tracheotomy]] is required to maintain an airway.

Follow-up: general well-being and laboratory organ markers are checked on a regular basis to ascertain the patient has remained in remission.

On 19 April 2011, the FDA announced its approval of [[rituximab]] in combination with [[glucocorticoid]]s to treat this condition.<ref name=FDA20110419>{{cite press release

==Epidemiology==
The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is 10 cases per million per year.<ref name=Bosch/> 90% of the patients are white. While it mainly occurs in the middle-aged, it has been reported in much younger and older patients.

==Prognosis==
25% to 40% of patients suffer from flare-ups, but a majority respond well to treatment. Anatomical problems ([[sinusitis]], tracheal stenosis) may require surgery in a small proportion. Relapses can be long and troublesome.

Long-term complications are very common (86%): mainly [[chronic renal failure]], hearing loss and [[deafness]].<ref name=Seo/>

==History==
[[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologist]] Peter McBride (1854–1946) first described the condition in 1897 in a [[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] article  entitled "Photographs of a case of rapid destruction of the nose and face".<ref name="pmid7057076">{{cite journal |author=Friedmann I |title=McBride and the midfacial granuloma syndrome.

An earlier name for the disease was pathergic granulomatososis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fienberg R |title=Pathergic granulomatosis |journal=Am. J.

In 2006, Alexander Woywodt ([[Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust|Preston]], United Kingdom) and Eric Matteson ([[Mayo Clinic]], USA) investigated Wegener's past, and discovered that he was, at least at some point of his career, a follower of the Nazi regime. In addition, their data indicate that Wegener was wanted by Polish authorities and that his files were forwarded to the United Nations War Crimes Commission. Finally, Wegener worked in close proximity to the genocide machinery in Lodz. Their data raise serious concerns about Wegener's professional conduct. They suggest that the eponym be abandoned and propose "ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Woywodt A, Matteson EL |title=Wegener's granulomatosis--probing the untold past of the man behind the eponym |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=1303–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16887845 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/kel258}}</ref> The authors have since campaigned for other medical eponyms to be abandoned, too.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Woywodt A, Matteson E |title=Should eponyms be abandoned?
