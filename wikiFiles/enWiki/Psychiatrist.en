A '''psychiatrist''' is a [[physician]] who specializes in [[psychiatry]]. A psychiatrist specializes in the treatment of mental disorders. Psychiatrists are authorized to prescribe medicine, conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests, use psychotherapy and may order brain imaging studies such as [[computed tomography]] (CT/CAT Scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanning.<ref name=APAWhatIs>American Psychiatric Association.

== Subspecialties ==
The field of psychiatry itself can be divided into various subspecialties.<ref name=UKReq /> These include:
* [[Addiction psychiatry]]
* Adult psychiatry

* [[Child and adolescent psychiatry]]
* [[Liaison psychiatry|Consultation-liaison psychiatry]]
* [[Cross-cultural psychiatry]]
* [[Emergency psychiatry]]
* [[Forensic psychiatry]]
* [[Learning disability]]
* [[Neurodevelopmental disorder]]
* [[Neuropsychiatry]]
* [[Psychosomatic medicine]]
* [[Cognition]] diseases as in various forms of [[dementia]]

Some psychiatric practitioners specialize in helping certain age groups. Child and adolescent (pediatric) psychiatrists work with kids and teenagers in addressing psychological problems, so that they are aware of the problem.<ref name=UKReq /> Those who work with the elderly are called geriatric psychiatrists or geropsychiatrists.<ref name=UKReq />   Those who practice psychiatry in the workplace are called [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational and occupational psychiatrists]] in the U.S. (occupational psychology is the name used for the most similar discipline in the UK).<ref name=UKReq /> Psychiatrists working in the courtroom and reporting to the judge and jury, in both criminal and civil court cases, are called [[forensic psychiatrist]]s, who also treat mentally disordered offenders and other patients whose condition is such that they have to be treated in secure units.<ref name=UKReq /><ref name=ABPNSubSpecial />

Other psychiatrists and mental health professionals in the field of psychiatry may also specialize in [[psychopharmacology]], [[psychotherapy]], [[psychiatric genetics]], [[neuroimaging]], [[dementia]]-related disorders/ sicknesses as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[sleep medicine]], [[pain medicine]], [[palliative medicine]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[sexual disorders]], [[women's health]], [[Global Mental Health]], [[early intervention in psychosis|early psychosis intervention]], [[mood disorders]] and [[anxiety disorders]] (including [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]).<ref name=UKReq /><ref name=ABPNSubSpecial>American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc.

== Professional requirements ==
While requirements to become a psychiatrist differ from country to country, all require a medical degree.<ref name=UKReq>The Royal College of Psychiatrists. (2005).

Retrieved March 25, 2007, from http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerbooklet.aspx</ref><ref name=USReq>Psychiatry.com (Unknown last update). ''Student Information''.

===US and Canada===
In the [[U.S.]] and [[Canada]] one must first complete their [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], followed by practice as a [[Residency (medicine)|psychiatric resident]] for another four years (five years in Canada). This extended period involves comprehensive training in diagnosis, psychopharmacology, medical care issues, and psychotherapies.  All accredited psychiatry residencies in the United States require proficiency in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], brief, psychodynamic, and supportive psychotherapies.  Psychiatry residents are often required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine or pediatrics and two months of neurology during their first year.<ref name=USReq /> After completing their training, psychiatrists take written and then oral board examinations.<ref name=USReq />  The total amount of time required to complete post-baccalaureate work in the field of psychiatry in the United States is typically 12 years of training. Subspecialists in child and adolescent psychiatry are required to complete a two-year residency program, the first year of which can run concurrently with the fourth year of the general psychiatry residency program. This adds one to two years of training.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], psychiatrists must hold a medical degree.<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerinfoforschoolleavers.aspx Careers info for School leavers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  These degrees are often abbreviated [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB BChir, MB BCh, MB ChB, BM BS, or MB BS]].  Following this, the individual will work as a [[Foundation House Officer]] for two additional years in the UK, or one year as [[Intern]] in the Republic of Ireland to achieve registration as a basic medical practitioner. Training in psychiatry can then begin and it is taken in two parts: three years of Basic Specialist Training culminating in the MRCPsych exam followed by three years of Higher Specialist Training, referred to as "ST4-6" in the UK and "Senior Registrar Training" in the Republic of Ireland. Candidates with MRCPsych degree and complete basic training must reinterview for higher specialist training. At this stage, the development of speciality interests such as forensic, child/adolescent take place. At the end of 3 years of higher specialist training, candidates are awarded a CCT (UK) or CCST (Ireland), both meaning Certificate of Completion of (Specialist) Training. At this stage, the psychiatrist can register as a specialist and the qualification of CC(S)T is recognized in all EU/EEA states. As such, training in the UK and Ireland is considerably longer than in the US or Canada and frequently takes around 8–9 years following graduation from medical school. Those with a CC(S)T will be able to apply for Consultant posts. Those with training from outside the EU/EEA should consult local medical boards to review their qualifications and eligibility for equivalence recognition (for example, those with a US residency and ABPN qualification).

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] one must complete [[Medical_school#Netherlands_and_Belgium|medical school]] after which one is certified as a medical doctor. After a strict selection program one can specialize in psychiatry: a 4.5 year specialization. During this specialization, the resident has to do a 6-month residency in the field of social psychiatry, a 12-month residency in a field of their own choice (which can be child psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, somatic medicine or medical research).  To become an adolescent psychiatrist, one has to do an extra specialization period of 2 more years. In short this means that it takes at least 10.5 years of study to become a psychiatrist which can go up to 12.5 years if one becomes a children's and adolescent psychiatrist.
