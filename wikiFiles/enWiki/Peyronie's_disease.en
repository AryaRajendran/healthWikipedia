==Exception==
A certain degree of curvature of the penis is considered normal, as many men are born with this benign condition, commonly referred to as congenital curvature.

[[File:Peyronie disease.jpg|thumb|left|Human penis with Peyronie's disease]]The disease may cause pain, hardened, big, cord-like [[lesion]]s (scar tissue known as "plaques"), or abnormal curvature of the penis when erect due to chronic inflammation of the tunica albuginea (CITA). Although the popular conception of Peyronie's Disease is that it always involves curvature of the penis, the scar tissue sometimes causes divots or indentations rather than curvature. The condition may also make [[sexual intercourse]] painful and/or difficult, though many men report satisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Although it can affect men of any race and age, it is most commonly seen in [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] males above the age of 40{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, especially those of [[blood type]] A+, but has been seen in men as young as 18. 
The disorder is confined to the penis, although a substantial number of men with Peyronie's exhibit concurrent [[connective tissue disorders]] in the hand, and to a lesser degree, in the feet. About 30 percent of men with Peyronie's Disease develop [[fibrosis]] in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot, including [[Dupuytren's contracture]] of the hand. An increased incidence in genetically related males suggests a genetic component.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=9636000</ref>

==Diagnosis==
A urologist can diagnose the disease and suggest treatment, although it is easily diagnosed by [[general practitioner]]s or family doctors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  An ultrasound can provide conclusive evidence of Peyronie's disease, ruling out congenital curvature or other disorders.<ref>Amin, Z., Patel, U., Friedman, E. P., Vale, J. A., Kirby, R., & Lees, W. R. (1993). Colour Doppler and duplex ultrasound assessment of Peyronie's disease in impotent men. British journal of radiology, 66(785), 398-402.</ref>
[[File:Peyronie's Disease Ultrasound.jpg|thumb|This ultrasound depicts cross sections of the penis at different locations in a patient with Peyronie's disease.  The top image shows normal anatomy whereas the bottom image shows scar tissue on the [[tunica albuginea (penis)]]. The scar tissue is localized and responsible for the hallmark deformities of Peyronie's disease (curvature and narrowing).]]

==Causes==
The underlying cause of Peyronie's Disease is not well understood, but is thought to be caused by trauma or injury to the penis usually through sexual activity although many patients often are unaware of any traumatic event or injury.<ref name="mayoclinic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peyronies-disease/DS00427/DSECTION=causes |title=Peyronie's disease: Causes |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref>

There is also an association that a class of [[Antihypertensive|anti-hypertensive drugs]] known as [[calcium channel blockers]] may be a possible cause of or exacerbate the disease,{{fact|date=April 2013}} although it has not been proven. However, all [[beta blocker]] drugs list Peyronie's disease as a possible side effect.<ref name="mayoclinic.com"/>

==Treatment==
{{Disputed-section|date=March 2011}}
Without treatment, about 12-13% of patients will spontaneously improve over time, 40-50% will get worse and the rest will be relatively stable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Medication and supplements===
Many oral treatments have been studied, but results so far have been mixed.<ref name="pmid14551587">{{cite journal |author=Levine LA |title=Review of current nonsurgical management of Peyronie's disease |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=15 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=S113–20 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14551587 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901084}}</ref> Some consider the use of non-surgical approaches to be "controversial".<ref name="pmid16698449">{{cite journal |author=Hauck EW, Diemer T, Schmelz HU, Weidner W |title=A critical analysis of nonsurgical treatment of Peyronie's disease |journal=European Urology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=987–97 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16698449 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2006.02.059}}</ref>

[[Vitamin E]] supplementation has been studied for decades, and some success has been reported in older trials, but those successes have not been reliably repeated in larger, newer studies.<ref name="pmid12454684">{{cite journal |author=Mynderse LA, Monga M |title=Oral therapy for Peyronie's disease |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=340–4 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12454684 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3900869}}</ref> A combination of Vitamin E and [[colchicine]] has shown some promise in delaying progression of the condition.<ref name="pmid12656907">{{cite journal |author=Prieto Castro RM, Leva Vallejo ME, Regueiro Lopez JC, Anglada Curado FJ, Alvarez Kindelan J, Requena Tapia MJ |title=Combined treatment with vitamin E and colchicine in the early stages of Peyronie's disease |journal=BJU International |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=522–4 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12656907 |doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04134.x}}</ref>

Some newer agents targeting the basic mechanisms of inflammation have been studied in larger clinical trials. These include potassium [[para-aminobenzoate]] (Potaba),<ref name="pmid15774254">{{cite journal |author=Weidner W, et al. |title=Potassium Paraaminobenzoate (POTABA) in the Treatment of Peyronie’s Disease: A Prospective, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Study |journal=European Urology |volume=47 |pages=530–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15774254}}</ref> [[pentoxifylline]] (acting through [[TGFβ1]] inhibition),<ref name="pmid19863517">{{cite journal |author=Safarinejad MR, et al. |title=A double-blind placebo-controlled study of the

The efficacy of [[Interferon-alpha-2b]] in the early stages of the disease has been reported in recent publications but it was found to be less effective in cases where calcification of the plaque had occurred in common with many treatments.<ref name="pmid17352513">{{cite journal |author=Trost LW, Gur S, Hellstrom WJ |title=Pharmacological Management of Peyronie's Disease |journal=Drugs |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=527–45 |year=2007 |pmid=17352513 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200767040-00004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.SMJ.0000056658.60032.D3 | author = Dang G, Matern R, Bivalacqua TJ, Sikka S, Hellstrom WJ | title = Intralesional interferon-alpha-2B injections for the treatment of Peyronie's disease | journal = [[South.

Formulations of [[superoxide dismutase]] are also reported to be effective in Peyronie's disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Riedl CR, Sternig P, Gallé G, ''et al.'' |title=Liposomal recombinant human superoxide dismutase for the treatment of Peyronie's disease: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind prospective clinical study |journal=European Urology |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=656–61 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=15982798 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2005.04.011}}</ref>

[[Injection (medicine)|Injection]]s to plaques (scar tissue formed by the inflammation) with [[Verapamil]] may be effective in some patients, but a recent placebo controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement. Use of [[iontophoresis]] with Verapamil and [[Dexamethasone]], applied to the affected areas has been studied<ref name="pmid10604323">{{cite journal |author=Riedl CR, Plas E, Engelhardt P, Daha K, Pflüger H |title=Iontophoresis for treatment of Peyronie's disease |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=95–9 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10604323 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(05)67981-5}}</ref> but the latest placebo controlled trial also failed to show a significant improvement. There are no clinical trials listed in the NIH trial registry.  Topical Verapamil cream is also another option for patients who are unwilling to undergo penile injections.

Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (marketed as Xiaflex by [[Auxilium]]), a drug approved by the FDA to treat [[Dupuytren's contracture]], has been reported to break down the excess collagen that causes Peyronie's disease. According to Auxilium, "the first phase II trials...showed promising results."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auxilium.com/productpipeline/PeyroniesDisease.aspx|title=Auxilium Product Pipeline: Peyronie's Disease|accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref> The drug has not been approved by the manufacturer or the FDA for the treatment of Peyronie's disease, and such treatments are currently considered [[off-label use]], and are discouraged.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hutchison, Courtney |title=Penis-Straightening Drug Xiaflex May Provide Relief for Peyronie's |newspaper=ABC News Medical Unit |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Sex/penis-straightening-drug-provide-relief-peyronies/story?id=9747758}}</ref>

===Surgery===
Surgery, such as the "Nesbit operation",<ref name="pmid14690485">{{cite journal |author=Ralph DJ, Minhas S |title=The management of Peyronie's disease |journal=BJU International |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=208–15 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14690485 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2004.04587.x}}</ref> is considered a last resort and should only be performed by highly skilled urological surgeons knowledgeable in specialized corrective surgical techniques. A [[penile prosthesis]] may be appropriate in advanced cases.<ref name="pmid14551588">{{cite journal |author=Hellstrom WJ, Usta MF |title=Surgical approaches for advanced Peyronie's disease patients |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=15 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=S121–4 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14551588 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901085}}</ref>
A European surgery called the Leriche technique, in which an 18 gauge needle is used to lacerate the plaque, has shown effectiveness at reducing curvature and returning sexual function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khouaja K, Delmas V, Boccon-Gibod L |title=[Leriche technique for the treatment of La Peyronie's disease] |language=French |journal=Progrès En Urologie |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=586–9; discussion 588–9 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15776920}}</ref>

===Physical therapy and devices===
Self-administered manual stretching techniques, as well as a number of devices which exert gentle longitudinal forces on the plaque, are currently being studied in clinical trials. However, these penis extenders are controversial and most doctors recommend staying away from them due to their unknown and potentially harmful side-effects. But there are a controversial minority who have endorsed such [http://peyronies.webs.com/ products].

Doctors are starting to look into less intrusive forms of therapy as an alternative to surgery because many patients were unhappy with the results of the intervention due mostly to the penile shortening that happens after the surgery.<ref>Use of Penile Extender Device in the Treatment of Penile
Curvature as a Result of Peyronie's Disease. Results of a Phase II Prospective Study http://www.andromedical.com/pdf/en/study_penile_extender_device_treatment_penile_curvature.pdf</ref> Although there is no cure for Peyronie's Disease or fibrotic disorders that are localized in different areas of the body ([[Fibrosis]]), several clinical studies such as the one mentioned above point to [[Penis enlargement#Stretching and hanging|penis extender]]s as a possible treatment to correct curvature, or at the very least to impede the curvature from getting worse. According to Doctor Gontero, the leading Doctor of the above mentioned study which was published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2009, "Overall treatment results were subjectively scored as acceptable in spite of curvature improvements, which varied from “no change” to “mild improvement.”" The study concluded that penile extender devices provided only minimal improvements in penile curvature but patients were generally satisfied likely from increased penile length. Several other studies exist which exhibit minor to moderate improvements in curvature, length and thickness but no cases of complete reversal of the Peyronies curvature.<ref>Can an External Penis Stretcher Reduce Peyronie's Penile Curvature?

In 2009 Dr. Timothy Abreu of the Gush Institute and Dr. Keith Kwon Nguyen of the Eastern Australian Men's Health and Fitness Association debuted a new suction-based treatment that showed promise in reducing the severity and discomfort of Peyronie's disease. Unfortunately the clinical trials were cut short after over 30 cases of necrosis.

==Counseling==
Peyronie's Disease can be a physically and psychologically devastating disease. While most men will continue to be able to have sexual relations, they are likely to experience some degree of deformity and [[erectile dysfunction]] in the wake of the disease process. It is not uncommon for men afflicted with Peyronie's Disease to exhibit depression or withdrawal from their sexual partners.
