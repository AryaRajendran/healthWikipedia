== Description ==
Chiefly Mexican, agaves are also [[native plant|native]] to the southern and western United States and  central and tropical South America. They are [[Succulent plant|succulents]] with a large [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]] of thick, fleshy leaves, each ending generally in a sharp point and with a spiny margin; the stout stem is usually short, the leaves apparently springing from the root. Along with plants from the related genus ''[[Yucca]]'', various ''Agave'' species are popular [[ornamental plant]]s.

Each rosette is [[monocarpic]] and grows slowly to flower only once. During flowering, a tall stem or "mast" grows from the center of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of short, tubular flowers. After development of fruit, the original plant dies, but [[Basal shoot|sucker]]s are frequently produced from the base of the stem, which become new plants.

It is a common misconception that agaves are [[cactus|cacti]]. They are not related to cacti, nor are they closely related to ''[[Aloe]]'' whose leaves are similar in appearance.

''Agave'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, including ''[[Batrachedra|Batrachedra striolata]]'', which has been recorded on ''A. shawii''.

==Taxonomy==
In the [[Cronquist system]] and others, ''Agave'' was placed in the family [[Liliaceae]], but [[phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA sequence]]s later showed it did not belong there.<ref name="bogler2006">David J. Bogler, J. Chris Pires, and Javier Francisco-Ortega. 2006. "Phylogeny of Agavaceae based on ndhF, rbcL, and ITS sequences: Implications of molecular data for classification". ''Aliso'' '''22'''(Monocots: Comparative Biology and Evolution):313-328.</ref> In the [[APG II system]], ''Agave'' was placed in the family Agavaceae. When this system was superseded by the [[APG III system]] in 2009, the Agavaceae were subsumed into the expanded family [[Asparagaceae]], and ''Agave'' was treated as one of 18 genera in the subfamily [[Agavoideae]].<ref name="chase2009"/>

''Agave'' had long been treated as a genus of about 166 species, but this concept of ''Agave'' is now known to be  [[paraphyletic]] over the genera ''[[Manfreda]]'', ''[[Polianthes]]'', and ''[[Prochnyanthes]]''. These genera are now combined with ''Agave'' as ''Agave'' ''[[sensu lato]]'', which contains about 208 species. In some of the older [[Biological classification|classifications]], ''Agave'' was divided into two [[subgenera]], ''Agave'' and ''Littaea'', based on the form of the [[inflorescence]]. These two subgenera are probably not [[monophyletic]].<ref name="bogler2006"/>

Agaves have long presented special difficulties for [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]]; variations within a species may be considerable, and a number of named species are of unknown origin and may just be variants of original wild species.

Spanish and Portuguese explorers probably brought agave plants back to Europe, but the plants became popular in Europe during the 19th century, when many types were imported by collectors. Some have been continuously propagated by offset since then, and do not consistently resemble any species known in the wild, although this may simply be due to the differences in growing conditions in Europe.

==Commonly grown species==
The most commonly grown species include ''[[Agave americana]]'', ''[[Agave angustifolia]]'', ''[[Agave tequilana]]'', ''[[Agave attenuata]],'' ''[[Agave parviflora]]'', ''[[Agave murpheyi]]'', ''[[Agave vilmoriniana]]'', ''[[Agave palmeri]]'', ''[[Agave parryi]]'' and ''[[Agave victoriae-reginae]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===''Agave americana''===
{{Main|Agave americana}}

One of the most familiar species is ''[[Agave americana]]'', a native of tropical America.  Common names include century plant, ''maguey'' (in Mexico), or American aloe (it is not, however, closely related to the genus ''[[Aloe]]''). The name "century plant" refers to the long time the plant takes to flower. The number of years before flowering occurs depends on the vigor of the individual plant, the richness of the soil, and the climate; during these years the plant is storing in its fleshy leaves the nourishment required for the effort of flowering.

''Agave americana'', century plant, was introduced into Europe about the middle of the 16th century, and is now widely cultivated as an ornamental; in the variegated forms, the leaf has a white or yellow marginal or central stripe. As the leaves unfold from the center of the rosette, the impression of the marginal spines is conspicuous on the still erect younger leaves. The plants require protection from frost. They mature very slowly and die after flowering, but are easily propagated by the offsets from the base of the stem.

Blue ''A. americana'' occurs in abundance in the [[Karoo]], and arid highland regions of South Africa. Introduced by the British settlers in 1820, the plant was originally cultivated and used as emergency feed for livestock.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Today it is used mainly for the production of syrup and sugar.

===''Agave attenuata''===
{{Main|Agave attenuata}}

''A. attenuata'' is a native of central Mexico and is uncommon in its natural habitat. Unlike most species of ''Agave'', ''A. attenuata'' has a curved flower spike from which it derives one of its numerous common names - the foxtail agave. ''A. attenuata'' is also commonly grown as a garden plant. Unlike many agaves, ''A. attenuata'' has no teeth or terminal spines, making it an ideal plant for areas adjacent to footpaths. Like all agaves, ''A. attenuata'' is a succulent and requires little water or maintenance once established.

===''Agave tequilana''===

{{Main|Agave tequilana}}

''Agave azul'' (blue agave) is used in the production of [[tequila]].

==Uses==
[[Image:Agave chiapensis whole.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The large flower spike of ''[[Agave chiapensis]]'']]

The [[ethnobotany]] of the agave was eloquently described by [[William H. Prescott]] in 1843:<ref>[[William H. Prescott]],1843 (1979 reprint). ''History of the Conquest of Mexico and the Conquest of Peru'', Modern Library, pp. 79-80</ref>

<blockquote>But the miracle of nature was the great Mexican aloe, or maguey, whose clustering pyramids of flowers, towering above their dark coronals of leaves, were seen sprinkled over many a broad acre of the table-land.  As we have already noticed its bruised leaves afforded a paste from which paper was manufactured, its juice was fermented into an intoxicating beverage, pulque, of which the natives, to this day, are extremely fond; its leaves further supplied an impenetrable thatch for the more humble dwellings; thread, of which coarse stuffs were made, and strong cords, were drawn from its tough and twisted fibers; pins and needles were made from the thorns at the extremity of its leaves; and the root, when properly cooked, was converted into a palatable and nutritious food. The agave, in short, was meat, drink, clothing, and writing materials for the Aztec! Surely, never did Nature enclose in so compact a form so many of the elements of human comfort and civilization! </blockquote>
There are four major parts of the agave that are edible: the flowers, the leaves, the stalks or basal rosettes, and the sap (called ''aguamiel''—honey water). (Davidson 1999)

Each agave plant will produce several pounds of [[edible flowers]] during its final season. The stalks, which are ready during the summer, before the blossom, weigh several pounds each. Roasted, they are sweet and can be chewed to extract the ''aguamiel'', like [[sugarcane]]. When dried out, the stalks can be used to make [[didgeridoo]]s. The leaves may be collected in winter and spring, when the plants are rich in sap, for eating. The leaves of several species also yield fiber: for instance, ''Agave rigida'' var. ''sisalana'', [[sisal]] hemp, ''Agave decipiens'', false sisal hemp. ''Agave americana'' is the source of pita fiber, and is used as a fiber plant in [[Mexico]], the [[West Indies]] and southern [[Europe]]. 

During the development of the [[inflorescence]], sap rushes to the base of the young flower stalk. [[Agave nectar]] (also called agave syrup), a sweetener derived from the sap, is used as an alternative to [[sugar]] in cooking, and it can be added to [[breakfast cereal]]s as a binding agent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chomka|first=Stefan|date=30 July 2007|title=Dorset Cereals|journal=[[The Grocer]]|publisher=[[William Reed (publisher)|William Reed Business Media]]|location=Crawley, England|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=independentarticle&ID=120966|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> In the case of ''A. americana'' and other species, this is used in [[Mexico]] and [[Mesoamerica]] in the production of the beverage ''[[pulque]]''. The flower shoot is cut out and the sap collected and subsequently fermented. By distillation, a spirit called ''[[mezcal]]'' is prepared; one of the best-known forms of mezcal is [[tequila]]. In 2001, the Mexican Government and [[European Union]] agreed upon the classification of tequila and its categories. All 100% blue agave tequila must be made from the Weber blue agave plant, to rigorous specifications and only in certain Mexican states.

People have found a few other uses of the plant aside from its several uses as food. When dried and cut in slices, the flowering stem forms natural [[razor strop]]s, and the expressed juice of the leaves will lather in water like soap. The natives of Mexico used the agave to make pens, nails, and needles, as well as string to sew and make weavings. Leaf [[tea]] or [[tincture]] taken orally is used to treat [[constipation]] and excess gas.  It is also used as a [[diuretic]]. Root tea or tincture is taken orally to treat [[arthritic]] joints.<ref>Botany in a Day, Thomas J Elpel, Hops Press LLc,  p. 190</ref>  Several agave species are also considered to have potential as effective bioenergy crops.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1757-1707.2010.01085.x}} free summary: Wiley - Blackwell (2011, January 26). Agave fuels excitement as a bioenergy crop. ScienceDaily. Retrieved January 26, 2011, from http://www.sciencedaily.com­/releases/2011/01/110126121102.htm</ref> Agave's ability to  grow in naturally water-limited environments could help to reduce the [[food vs fuel]] trade-off.<ref>{{cite doi |10.1039/C1EE01107C}}</ref>

The agave, especially ''[[Agave murpheyi]]'', was a major food source for the prehistoric [[Indigenous people of the United States|indigenous people]] of the Southwestern United States. The [[Hohokam]] of southern [[Arizona]] cultivated large areas of agave.<ref>Fish, Suzanne K., Fish, Paul R., and Madsen, John H. "Evidence for Large-scaleAgave Cultivation in the Marana Community.'' http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/fishchapter7.htm, accessed 1 Jun 2012</ref>

The Navajo have many uses for agave. The baked fibers of which are squeezed, and the liquid drunk. The heads are baked or boiled, pounded into flat sheets, sun dried and stored for future use. The baked, dried heads are also boiled and made into an edible paste, eaten whole, or made into soup. The leaves are also boiled and eaten. The young, tender flowering stalks are and shoots are roasted and eaten as well. The fibers are used to make rope, the leaves are used to line baking pits, and the sharp pointed leaf tips are used to make basketry awls. <ref>http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Agave</ref>

==Warnings==
The juice from many species of agave can cause acute contact [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=Donald G. |title=The Poisoned Weed: Plants Toxic to Skin|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-1951-5548-8|page=85|chapter=Phototoxic and irritant plants}}</ref>  It will produce reddening and blistering lasting one to two weeks.  Episodes of itching may recur up to a year thereafter, though the rash is no longer visible.  Irritation is, in part, caused by [[calcium oxalate]] [[raphides]].  Dried parts of the plants can be handled with bare hands with little or no effect. If the skin is pierced deeply enough by the needle-like ends of the leaf from a vigorously growing plant, this can also cause blood vessels in the surrounding area to erupt and an area some 6–7&nbsp;cm across appear to be bruised.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} This may last up to three weeks.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
