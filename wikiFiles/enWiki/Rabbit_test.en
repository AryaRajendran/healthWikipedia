The '''rabbit test''', or '''Aschheim-Zondek test''', was an early [[pregnancy test]] developed in 1927 by [[Bernhard Zondek]] and [[Selmar Aschheim]].  The original test actually used mice,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Morris Fishbein, M.D. |encyclopedia=The New Illustrated Medical and Health Encyclopedia |title=Aschheim-Zondek Test |edition=Home Library Edition |year=1976 |publisher=H. S. Stuttman Co |volume=1 |location=New York, N.Y. 10016 |pages=139}}</ref> and was based upon the observation that when [[urine]] from a female in the early months of [[pregnancy]] is injected into immature female [[mice]], the [[Ovary|ovaries]] of the mice enlarge and show [[Ovarian follicle|follicular]] [[Developmental biology|maturation]]. The test was considered reliable, with an error rate of less than 2%.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Evans |first=Herbert M. |authorlink= |coauthors=Simpson, Miriam E. |year=1930 |month= |title=Aschheim-Zondek test for pregnancy - its present status. |journal=Calif West Med |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=145â€“8 |id= |accessdate=2009-02-09 |quote= |pmc=1657362}}</ref> The rabbit test consisted of injecting the tested woman's [[urine]] into a female [[rabbit]], then examining the rabbit's [[ovaries]] a few days later, which would change in response to a [[hormone]] only secreted by pregnant women. The hormone, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), is produced during pregnancy and indicates the presence of a fertilized egg; it can be found in a pregnant woman's urine and blood. The rabbit test became a widely used [[bioassay]] (animal-based test) to test for pregnancy.  The term "rabbit test" was first recorded in 1949 but became a common phrase in the English language. [[Xenopus]] frogs were also used in a similar "[[Frogs in research|frog test]]".

Modern pregnancy tests still operate on the basis of testing for the presence of the hormone hCG.  Due to medical advances, use of a live animal is no longer required.

It is a common misconception that the injected rabbit would die only if the woman was pregnant.  This led to the phrase "the rabbit died" being used as a euphemism for a positive pregnancy test.  In fact, all rabbits used for the test died, because they had to be surgically opened in order to examine the ovaries.  While it was possible to do this without killing the rabbit, it was generally deemed not worth the trouble and expense.
