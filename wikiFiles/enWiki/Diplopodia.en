'''Diplopodia''' is a congenital anomaly in [[tetrapod]]s that involves duplication of elements of the foot on the hind limb.  It comes from the Greek roots diplo = "double" and pod = "foot".

==Description==
The affected leg usually has one foot that is in an approximately normal position.<ref name=Karchinov1973/> The extra foot is composed of at least some [[metatarsus|metatarsal]] or [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal bones]] and extra digits, though it is usually not complete.<ref name=Karchinov1973/> The feet can be joined together, so that the limb appears to have one large foot,<ref name=Karchinov1973/> or the extra foot can be joined to the limb separately, usually above the level of the other foot.<ref name= Abbott1959>{{cite journal

People have been able to produce diplopod limbs by increasing [[sonic hedgehog]] (shh) signaling in the [[limb bud]]s of embryos.  The [[zone of polarizing activity]] (ZPA) in the proximal posterior [[mesoderm]] of a tetrapod limb bud is responsible for maintaining the anterior-posterior axis of the growing limb.<ref name= Saunders1968>{{Cite book

Chickens normally have an [[anisodactyl]] toe arrangement, with one short toe pointing backwards and three long toes pointing forwards. In diplopodia, the feet usually lack the normal hind toe and instead develop two to four extra toes at various positions between the [[hock (zoology)|hock joint]] and the front toes.<ref name= Taylor1947/><ref name= Abbott1959/><ref name= Rodriguez1996/><ref name= Landauer1956/><ref name= Maccabe1975>{{cite journal

'''Diplopodia-1'''

This [[autosomal]] mutation gives [[homozygotes]] duplicated wing tips and feet in front of the usual structures, as in the experimentally induced diplopodia described above.<ref name= Taylor1947/><ref name= Rodriguez1996/> However, unlike the experimentally manipulated embryos, these embryos show no change in shh expression.<ref name= Rodriguez1996/> The embryos express [[HOXD11|hoxd-11]], [[HOXD12|hoxd-12]], [[HOXD13|hoxd-13]], [[Bone morphogenetic protein 2|Bmp-2]], and [[Fibroblast growth factor|Fgf-4]] along the whole edge of each limb bud, even though these genes are normally only expressed at the posterior edge.<ref name= Rodriguez1996/>

'''Diplopodia-2'''

This is an autosomal trait that gives a very extreme diplopod phenotype, with up to eight toes on a foot.<ref name= Landauer1956/> In some embryos, the two outer front toes on each foot are joined together.<ref name= Landauer1956/> The trait is now extinct and was never fully characterized.<ref name= Taylor1972/>  

'''Diplopodia-3'''

This is an autosomal trait that may be the least severe of the five.

'''Diplopodia-4'''

This [[sex linkage|sex-linked]] mutation is similar to the previous mutations, but causes the embryo to grow thicker wing bones.<ref name= Abbott1961/>

'''Diplopodia-5'''

This is an autosomal mutation that gives embryos webbing between the inner two front toes on each foot, in addition to the usual characteristics of diplopodia.<ref name= Olympio1983/> Almost all of the embryos survive to the end of incubation, but they are unable to clear the fluid from their lungs or absorb the blood from their extraembryonic vessels.<ref name= Olympio1983/> These problems always prevent them from hatching.<ref name= Olympio1983/> Almost all diplopodia-5 embryos have only one or two extra toes on each foot, so this mutation causes the least extreme foot malformation.<ref name= Olympio1983/>
