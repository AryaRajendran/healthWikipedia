The '''pelvic cavity''' is a [[body cavity]] that is bounded by the bones of the [[pelvis]]. Its oblique roof is the [[pelvic inlet]] (the superior opening of the pelvis). Its lower boundary is the [[pelvic floor]].

The pelvic cavity primarily contains [[reproductive organs]], the [[urinary bladder]], the [[pelvic colon]], and the [[rectum]]. The [[rectum]] is placed at the back of the pelvis, in the curve of the [[sacrum]] and [[coccyx]]; the bladder is in front, behind the [[pubic symphysis]].
In the female, the [[uterus]] and [[vagina]] occupy the interval between these viscera. The pelvic cavity also contains major arteries, veins, muscles, and nerves. These structures have to work together in a little crowded space. They can be affected by many different diseases and by many drugs in many different ways. One part may impact upon another, for example constipation may overload the rectum and compress the urinary bladder, or childbirth might damage the [[Pudendal nerve|pudendal nerves]] and later lead to anal weakness.

[[File:Pelvis.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pelvis]]

The pevis has an anteroinferior, a posterior and two lateral pelvic walls; and an inferior pelvic wall, also called the [[Pelvic floor]].<ref>Moore, Keith L. et al. (2010) ''Clinically Oriented Anatomy'' 6th Ed, ch.3 ''Pelvis and perineum'', p.339</ref><ref>Richard S. Snell ''Clinical Anatomy By Regions'', ''Pevic cavity'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=vb4AcUL4CE0C&pg=PA242 p.242]</ref> The [[parietal peritoneum]] is attached here and to the [[abdominal wall]].<ref>Tank, P. (2013) ''Grants Dissector'' 15th ed., ch.4 ''The abdomen'', p.99</ref>

=== Lesser pelvis ===
The lesser pelvis (or "true pelvis") is the space enclosed by the [[pelvic girdle]] and below the [[pelvic brim]]: between the [[pelvic inlet]] and the [[pelvic floor]].  This cavity is a short, curved canal, deeper on its posterior than on its anterior wall. Some consider this region to be the entirety of the pelvic cavity. Others define the pelvic cavity as the larger space including the [[#Greater pelvis|greater pelvis]], just above the pelvic inlet.

The lesser pelvis is bounded in front and below by the [[pubic symphysis]] and the [[superior rami of the pubes]]; above and behind, by the sacrum and coccyx; and laterally, by a broad, smooth, quadrangular area of bone, corresponding to the inner surfaces of the body and superior ramus of the [[ischium]], and the part of the [[ilium]] below the [[arcuate line (ilium)|arcuate line]].

The lesser pelvis contains the [[pelvic colon]], [[rectum]], [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and some of the [[organs of generation]].
The [[rectum]] is at the back, in the curve of the [[sacrum]] and [[coccyx]]; the bladder is in front, behind the [[pubic symphysis]].  In the female, the [[uterus]] and [[vagina]] occupy the interval between these viscera.

The [[pelvic splanchnic nerves]] arising at S2-S4 are in the lesser pelvis.

=== Greater pelvis ===
The greater pelvis (or "false pelvis") is the space enclosed by the [[pelvic girdle]] above and in front of the [[pelvic brim]].
It is bounded on either side by the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]]; in front it is incomplete, presenting a wide interval between the anterior borders of the [[ilium (bone)|ilia]], which is filled by the [[parietes]] of the [[abdomen]]; behind is a deep notch on either side between the ilium and the [[base of the sacrum]].

It is generally considered part of the [[abdominal cavity]] (this is why it is sometimes called the false pelvis).<ref>Drake et al. (2009) Grays Anatomy for Students, 2nd Edition, ch.5 ''Pelvis and perineum - ''general description'', p.406</ref> Some{{who|date=April 2013}} consider this region part of the pelvic cavity,{{cn|date=April 2013}} while others reframe the classification question by calling the combination the [[abdominopelvic cavity]].

The greater pelvis supports the [[intestines]] (specifically, the [[ileum]] and [[sigmoid colon]]), and transmits part of their weight to the anterior wall of the [[abdomen]].

The [[femoral nerve]] from L2-L4 is in the greater pelvis, but not in the lesser pelvis.

== Measurements ==
The pelvis can be classified into four main types by measuring the pelvic diameters and conjugates at the pelvic inlet and outlet and as oblique diameters.
