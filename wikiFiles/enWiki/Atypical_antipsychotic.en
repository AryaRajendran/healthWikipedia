[[File:Clozapine.svg|thumb|[[Skeletal formula]] of [[clozapine]], the first atypical antipsychotic]]

The '''atypical antipsychotics''' (AAP) (also known as '''second generation antipsychotics''') are a group of [[antipsychotic]] [[tranquilizer|tranquilizing]] drugs used to treat psychiatric conditions. Some atypical antipsychotics are [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved for use in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]]. Some carry FDA approved [[Indication (medicine)|indications]] for acute [[mania]], [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] depression, psychotic agitation, bipolar maintenance, and other indications. 
Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain's [[dopamine pathways]], but atypicals at the time of marketing were claimed to differ from [[typical antipsychotic]]s in that they are less likely to cause [[extrapyramidal symptom|extrapyramidal]] [[motor control]] [[disabilities]] in patients, which include unsteady [[Parkinson's disease]]-type movements, body [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]] and involuntary [[tremor]]s.<ref>Culpepper, L. (2007) A Roadmap to Key Pharmacologic Principles in Using Antipsychotics, Primary Care Companion To The Journal of Association of Medicine and Psychiatry 9(6) 444–454 Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2139919/</ref> More recent research has demonstrated the side effect profile of these drugs is similar to older drugs, causing the leading medical journal [[The Lancet]] to write in its editorial "the time has come to abandon the terms first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics, as they do not merit this distinction." <ref> Tyler, P and Kendall, T (2008) The Lancet, Volume 373, Issue 9657, Pages 4 - 5, 3 January 2009 doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61345-8  Retrieved from http://psychrights.org/research/Digest/NLPs/SpuriousAdvanceofNeurolepticsLancetTurner2008.pdf</ref> 

During the course of treatment atypical antipsychotics are associated with the following benefits: higher rate of responders, efficiency in patients with refractory disease, lower risk of suicides, better functional capacity and an improved quality of life.<ref name="Horacek, J. 2006"/> However, there has been considerable debate about whether second-generation antipsychotic drugs are better than first-generation antipsychotic drugs.<ref name=leucht/> Although atypical antipsychotics are thought to be safer than typical antipsychotics, they still have severe side effects, including [[tardive dyskinesia]], a serious movement disorder, [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], and increased risk of stroke, sudden cardiac death, blood clots, and diabetes. Significant weight gain may also occur.

===Effectiveness===
There has been considerable debate about whether second-generation antipsychotic drugs are more effective than first-generation
antipsychotic drugs.<ref name=leucht>{{cite web|url=http://ectweb.pbworks.com/f/Second-generation+versus+first-generation+antipsychotic+drugs+for+schizophrenia+a+meta-analysis.pdf|title=Second-generation versus first-generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia: a meta-analysis  |author=Stefan Leucht, Caroline Corves, Dieter Arbter, Rolf R Engel, Chunbo Li, John M Davis |date=January 3, 2009 |work=Lancet |pages=31–41 }}</ref> It has been suggested that there is no validity to the term "second-generation antipsychotic drugs" and that the drugs that currently occupy this category are not identical to each other in mechanism, efficacy, and side-effect profiles: 
<blockquote>
...the second-generation drugs have no special atypical characteristics that separate them from the typical, or first-generation, antipsychotics. As a
group they are no more efficacious, do not improve specific symptoms, have no clearly different side-effect profiles than the first-generation antipsychotics, and are less cost effective.  The spurious invention of the atypicals can now be regarded as invention only, cleverly manipulated by the drug industry for marketing purposes and only now being exposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychrights.org/research/Digest/NLPs/SpuriousAdvanceofNeurolepticsLancetTurner2008.pdf|title=The spurious advance of antipsychotic drug therapy |author=Peter Tyrer and Tim Kendall|date=January 3, 2009 |work=Lancet |volume= 373 }}</ref>
</blockquote>
Robert Whitaker suggests that the "wonder drug" glow around the second generation psychotropics has long since disappeared. He views the "hyping" of the top-selling atypicals as "one of the more embarrassing episodes in psychiatry's history, as one government study after another failed to find that they were any better than the first-generation anti-psychotics".<ref>{{cite web |title=Anatomy of an Epidemic |author=Robert Whitaker |year=2010 |publisher=Crown |page=303 }}</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
The side effects reportedly associated with the various atypical antipsychotics vary and are medication-specific. Generally speaking, atypical antipsychotics are hoped to have a lower likelihood for the development of [[tardive dyskinesia]] than the typical antipsychotics. However, tardive dyskinesia typically develops after long term (possibly decades) use of antipsychotics. It is not clear, then, if atypical antipsychotics, having been in use for a relatively short time, produce a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia.

[[Akathisia]] is more likely to be less intense with these drugs than the typical antipsychotics{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} although many patients would dispute this claim. In 2004, the Committee for the Safety of Medicines (CSM) in the UK issued a warning that olanzapine and risperidone should not be given to elderly patients with [[dementia]], because of an increased risk of stroke. Sometimes atypical antipsychotics can cause abnormal shifts in sleep patterns, and extreme tiredness and weakness.

In 2006, USA Today published an article about the effects of antipsychotic medication in children. None of the atypicals (Clozaril, Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Abilify and Geodon) had been approved for children, and there was little research on their effects on children. From 2000–2004, there were 45 reported deaths in which an atypical antipsychotic was listed as the "primary suspect." There were also 1328 reports of serious, and sometimes life threatening, side effects. These include tardive dyskinesia (involuntary jerking and facial grimacing) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions that can interfere with talking and eating).  Since the article's publication several of the atypicals now carry limited FDA approval for pediatric indications.

Some of the other side effects that have been suggested is that atypical antipsychotics increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">Kabinoff, G.S., Toalson, P.A., Masur Healey, K., McGuire, H.C. & Hay, D.P. (2003) Metabolic Issues with Atypical Antipsychotics in Primary Care: Dispelling the Myths, Primary Care Companion To The Journal of Association of Medicine and Psychiatry 5(1) 6–14 Retrieved fromhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC353028/</ref> The research that Kabinoff et al. evaluated found that the increase in cardiovascular disease is seen regardless of the treatment they receive, instead it is caused by many different factors such as lifestyle or diet.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>
Metabolic syndrome is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with schizophrenia, with a prevalence rate more than triple that of nonpsychiatric populations. Given the amount of evidence suggesting a link between antipsychotic medications and metabolic syndrome, several agencies have recommended regular clinical monitoring of weight, symptoms of hyperglycemia,glucose, hypertension and signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease in chronically medicated patients with schizophrenia. Atypical antispychotics may have favourable risk benefit profile, however epecially some older atypicals like clozapine and olanzapine may increase the risk for developing metabolic syndrome. Longterm cardiovascular or diabetic complications may be the result. Newer atypicals with low risk for metabolic complications, but not classic antipsychotics should be prescribed.<ref>Dirk Ziskoven. Does antipsychotic treatment increase the risk of internistic complications in pyschotic patients? Manual of Clinical Neurosciences; 2003 (5) 1134-48; PMID 12752374</ref>
Sexual side effects have also been reported when taking atypical antipsychotics.<ref>Üçok, A& Wolfgang G. (2008). Side Effects of Atypical Antipsychotics: A brief overview. World Psychiatry, 7(1). 58–62 Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/ PMC2327229/</ref> In males antipsychotics reduce sexual interest, impair sexual performance with the main difficulties being failure to ejaculate.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260"/> In females there may be abnormal menstrual cycles and infertility.<ref>McKim, W. (2007) Psychomotor Stimulants in Drugs and Behavior: An Introduction to Behavioral Pharmacology (pp.241–260). Upper Saddle River, NJ.: Pearson Prentice Hall</ref> In both males and females the breasts may become enlarged and a fluid will sometimes ooze from the nipples.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260"/> Sexual adverse effects caused by some anti-psychotics are a result of an increase of prolactin. Sulpiride and Amisulpiride and in less extense Risperdone and paliperidone cause a high increase of prolactin.

In April 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an advisory and subsequent black box warning regarding the risks of atypical anti psychotic use among elderly patients with dementia. The FDA advisory was associated with decreases in the use of atypical antipsychotics, especially among elderly patients with dementia.<ref name=dorsey>{{cite journal|last=Dorsey|first=ER|coauthors=Rabbani A, Gallagher SA, Conti RM, Alexander GC|title=Impact of FDA black box advisory on antipsychotic medication use|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=11|year=2011|month=January|volume=170|issue=1|pages=96–103|pmid=20065205|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20065205|accessdate=11/9/2011|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2009.456}}</ref> Subsequent research reports confirmed the mortality risks associated with the use of both conventional and atypical antipsychotics to treat patients with dementia.  Consequently in 2008 the FDA issued although a black box warning for classical neuroleptics. Data on treatment efficacies are strongest for atypical antipsychotics. Adverse effects in patients with dementia include an increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular events, as well as metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, falls, cognitive worsening, cardiac arrhythmia, and pneumonia. Conventional antipsychotics may pose an even greater safety risks. Moreover high potential conventional antipsychotics like haloperidol may be associated with the highest risk followed by low potential neuroleptics thereafter risperidone and olanzapine. Quetiapine seemed to have a lower risk. No clear efficacy evidence exists to support the use of alternative psychotropic classes (e.g. antidepressants, anticonvulsants)<ref>Ziskoven Dirk. Atypical Antipsychotics: Clinical efficacy and tolerability. Is tolerability predictable?  EuropeanE-Journal of Biological Pharmacology; 2008 VOl 02 * NR 04 * 95-100; PMID 1253786</ref>

=== Tardive dyskinesia ===
All of the atypical antipsychotics warn about the possibility of [[tardive dyskinesia]] in their package inserts and in the [[Physicians' Desk Reference|PDR]]. It is not possible to truly know the risks of tardive dyskinesia when taking atypicals, because tardive dyskinesia can take many decades to develop and the atypical antipsychotics are not old enough to have been tested over a long enough period of time to determine all of the long-term risks. One hypothesis as to why atypicals have a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia is because they are much less fat-soluble than the typical antipsychotics and because they are readily released from D2 receptor and brain tissue.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> The typical antipsychotics remain attached to the D2 receptors and accumulate in the brain tissue which may lead to TD.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/>

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause [[tardive dyskinesia]].<ref name=TD08>{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=CU|coauthors=Schenk, EM|title=Tardive dyskinesia and new antipsychotics.|journal=Current opinion in psychiatry|date=2008 Mar|volume=21|issue=2|pages=151–6|pmid=18332662|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3282f53132}}</ref> According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%.<ref name=TD08/>

=== Metabolism ===
Recently, metabolic concerns have been of grave concern to clinicians, patients and the FDA. In 2003, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) required all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics to change their labeling to include a warning about the risks of [[hyperglycemia]] and [[diabetes]] with atypical antipsychotics. It must also be pointed out that although all atypicals must carry the warning on their labeling, some evidence shows that atypicals are not equal in their effects on weight and [[insulin sensitivity]].<ref name="pmid14747245">{{cite journal |author=American Diabetes Association; American Psychiatric Association; American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists; North American Association for the Study of Obesity|title=Consensus development conference on antipsychotic drugs and obesity and diabetes|journal=Diabetes Care |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=596–601 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14747245|doi= 10.2337/diacare.27.2.596|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/27/2/596}}</ref> The general consensus is that clozapine and olanzapine are associated with the greatest effects on weight gain and decreased insulin sensitivity, followed by risperidone and quetiapine.<ref name="pmid14747245"/> Ziprasidone and aripiprazole are thought to have the smallest effects on weight and [[insulin resistance]], but clinical experience with these newer agents is not as developed as that with the older agents.<ref name="pmid14747245"/>

A study by Sernyak and colleagues found that the prevalence of diabetes in atypical antipsychotic treatments was statistically significantly higher than that of conventional treatment.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> The authors of this study suggest that it is a causal relationship the Kabinoff et al. suggest the findings only suggest a temporal association.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> Kabinoff et al. suggest that there is insufficient data from large studies to demonstrate a consistent or significant difference in the risk of insulin resistance during treatment with various atypical antipsychotics.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
The most common route of administration of AAP is oral.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260">McKim, W. (2007) Antipsychotics in Drugs and Behavior: An Introduction to Behavioral Pharmacology (pp.241–260). Upper Saddle River, NJ.: Pearson Prentice Hall</ref> Antipsychotics can also be injected, but this method is not as common.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260"/> Once the antipsychotics are in the body they are lipid soluble and are readily absorbed from the digestive tract and can easily pass the blood brain barrier and placental barriers.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260"/> Once in the brain the antipsychotics make their way to the synapse and work at the synapse by binding to the receptor (Culpepper, 2007). Antipsychotics are entirely destroyed by the body's metabolism and the metabolites are excreted in the urine (McKim, 2007). These drugs have relatively long half lives.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260"/> Each drug has a different half life but the occupancy of the D2 receptor falls off within 24 hours with atypical antipsychotics, while lasting over 24 hours for the typical antipsychotics.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> This may explain why relapse into psychosis happens quicker with atypical antipsychotics than with typical antipsychotics, as the drug is excreted faster and is no longer working in the brain.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> Physical dependence with these drugs is very rare, therefore withdrawal symptoms are rarely seen.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260"/> Sometimes if AAP are abruptly stopped psychotic symptoms, movement disorders and difficulty in sleep are seen.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260"/> It is possible that withdrawal is rarely seen because the AAP are stored in the fat tissues in the body and slowly released.<ref name="McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260"/>

== Pharmacology ==
The mechanism of action of these agents is unknown, and differs greatly from drug to drug.
The variation in the receptor binding profile is such that the only effect all have in common is an anti-psychotic effect; the side effect profiles vary tremendously. The mechanisms behind atypical antipsychotic action are not clear. All antipsychotics work on the dopamine system but all vary in regards to the affinity to the dopamine receptors.<ref name="Horacek, J. 2006">Horacek, J., Bubenikova-Valeova, V., Kopecek, M., Palenicek, T., Dockery, C., Mohr, P. & Höschl, C. (2006) Mechanism of Action of Atypical Antipsychotic Drugs and the Neurobiology of Schizophrenia, CNS Drugs 20(5) 389–405 Retrieved from Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection database.</ref> There are 5 types of dopamine receptors in humans.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> There are the “D1-like” group which are types 1 and 5 which are similar in structure and drug sensitivity.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> The “D2-like” group includes dopamine receptors 2, 3 and 4 and have a very similar structure but very different sensitivities to antipsychotic drugs.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/>

The “D1-like” receptors have been found to not be clinically relevant in therapeutic action.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> If D1 receptors were a critical component of the mechanism of AAP blocking just the D1 receptor would improve the psychiatric symptoms that are exhibited.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> If D1 receptor binding was a critical component of the action of antipsychotics they would need to be present in maintenance dosages.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> This is not seen. They are not present or present in low or negligible levels which would not even maintain the elimination of the symptoms that are seen.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/>

The “D2-like” group of dopamine receptors are classified together based on structure but not drug sensitivity. It has been shown that D2 receptor blockade is necessary for action.<ref name="Horacek, J. 2006"/> All antipsychotics block D2 receptors to some degree, but the affinity of the antipsychotics vary from drug to drug and it has been hypothesized that it is the varying in affinities that causes a change in effectiveness (Horacek et al., 2002).

One theory for how atypicals work is the “fast-off” theory.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> This theory of antipsychotic action is that AAP have low affinities for the D2 receptor and only bind loosely to the receptor and are rapidly released.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> In fact, the AAP bind more loosely to the D2 receptor than dopamine itself.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> The AAP effectively interfere with the phasic release of endogenous dopamine.<ref name="Horacek, J. 2006"/> The AAP transiently bind and rapidly dissociate from the D2 receptor to allow normal dopamine transmission.<ref name="ReferenceA">Seeman, P. (2002). Atypical Antipsychotics: Mechanism of Action. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 47(1), 27. Retrieved from Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection database</ref> It is this transient binding that that keeps prolactin levels normal, spares cognition and obviates EPS.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/>

From a historical point of view there has been interest in the role of serotonin and treatment with the use antipsychotics.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> Experience with LSD suggests that 5-HT2A receptor blockade may be a promising method of treating schizophrenia;<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> see also [[LSD and schizophrenia]]. One problem with this is the fact that psychotic symptoms caused by 5-HT2 receptor agonists differs substantially from the symptoms of schizophrenic psychoses.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> One promising factor of this is where the 5-HT2A receptors are located in the brain. They are localized on hippocampal and cortical pyramidal cells and have a high density in the fifth neocortex layer where the inputs of various cortical and subcortical brain areas are integrated.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> This makes the blocking of this receptor an interesting area considering these areas in the brain are of interest in the development of schizophrenia.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> This is an area of research that could prove convincing but has not yielded any convincing results.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> Evidence points to the fact that serotonin is not sufficient to produce an antipsychotic effect but serotonergic activity in combination with D2 receptor blockade may be responsible.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> Regardless of the neurotransmitters these AAP have an effect on antipsychotic drugs appear to work by inducing restructuring of neuronal networks.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002"/> They are able to induce these structural changes.

== History ==
The first major tranquiliser or anti-psychotic medication, [[chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine), a typical antipsychotic, was discovered in 1951 and introduced into clinical practice shortly after. Clozapine, a.k.a. Clozaril,an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced [[agranulocytosis]]. With research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant [[schizophrenia]] and the development of an adverse event monitoring system, clozapine reemerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003) the three most accepted atypical drugs are; clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis (which is decreased number of white blood cells), Barker (2003) explains that a person on clozapine will have to go through rigorous blood monitoring. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favourable side effect profile were sought after for widespread use. During the 1990s, [[olanzapine]], [[risperidone]] and [[quetiapine]] were introduced, with [[ziprasidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic [[paliperidone]] was approved by the FDA in late 2006.

The atypical anti-psychotics have found favour among clinicians and are now considered to be first line treatments for schizophrenia and are gradually replacing the [[typical antipsychotic|typical]] [[antipsychotic]]s. In the past, most researchers have agreed that the defining characteristic of an atypical antipsychotic is the decreased propensity of these agents to cause [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects (EPS)<ref name="pmid16498489">{{cite journal |author=Farah A |title=Atypicality of atypical antipsychotics |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=6|pages=268–74 |year=2005 |pmid=16498489 |pmc=1324958 |doi= 10.4088/PCC.v07n0602|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/redirect/v07n06p268.htm}}</ref> and an absence of sustained [[prolactin]] elevation.<ref name="pmid11873706">{{cite journal |author=Seeman P |title=Atypical antipsychotics: mechanism of action |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=1|pages=27–38 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11873706 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

The terminology can still be imprecise. The definition of "atypicality" was based upon the absence of extrapyramidal side effects, but there is now a clear understanding that atypical antipsychotics can still induce these effects (though to a lesser degree than typical antipsychotics.)<ref name="pmid17242588">{{cite journal |author=Weiden PJ |title=EPS profiles: the atypical antipsychotics are not all the same |journal=J Psychiatr Pract |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=13–24|year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17242588 |doi= 10.1097/00131746-200701000-00003|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00131746-200701000-00003}}</ref> Recent literature focuses more upon specific pharmacological actions, and less upon categorization of an agent as "typical" or "atypical". There is no clear dividing line between the typical and atypical antipsychotics therefore categorization based on the action is difficult.<ref name="Seeman, P. 2002">Seeman, P. (2002).

More recent research is questioning the notion that second generation anti-psychotics are superior to first generation typical anti-psychotics. Using a number of parameters to assess quality of life, [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]] researchers found that typical anti-psychotics were no worse than atypical anti-psychotics. The research was funded by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) of the UK.<ref name="pmid17015810">{{cite journal |author=Jones PB |title=Randomized controlled trial of the effect on Quality of Life of second- vs first-generation antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic Drugs in Schizophrenia Study (CUtLASS 1) |journal=Arch.
