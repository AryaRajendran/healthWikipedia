'''Achalasia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|eɪ|k|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|z|i|ə}}), also known as '''esophageal achalasia''', '''achalasia cardiae''', '''cardiospasm''', and '''esophageal aperistalsis''', is an [[esophageal motility disorder]] involving the [[smooth muscle cell|smooth muscle]] layer of the [[esophagus]] and the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES).<ref name=Park_2005>{{cite journal |author=Park W, Vaezi M |title=Etiology and pathogenesis of achalasia: the current understanding |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |volume=100 |issue=6 |pages=1404–14 |year=2005 |pmid=15929777 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.41775.x}}</ref> It is characterized by incomplete LES relaxation, increased LES tone, and lack of [[peristalsis]] of the esophagus (inability of smooth muscle to move food down the esophagus) in the absence of other explanations like cancer or fibrosis.<ref name=Spechler_2001>{{cite journal |author=Spechler SJ, Castell DO |title=Classification of oesophageal motility abnormalities |journal=Gut |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=145–51 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11413123 |pmc=1728354 |doi= 10.1136/gut.49.1.145|url=}}</ref><ref name=Pandolfino>{{cite journal |author=Pandolfino JE, Kahrilas PJ |title=AGA technical review on the clinical use of esophageal manometry |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=128 |issue=1 |pages=209–24 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15633138 |doi= 10.1053/j.gastro.2004.11.008|url=}}</ref>

Achalasia is characterized by [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]], and sometimes [[chest pain]]. Diagnosis is reached with [[esophageal manometry]] and [[barium swallow]] radiographic studies. Various treatments are available, although none cures the condition. Certain medications or [[botulinum toxin|Botox]] may be used in some cases, but more permanent relief is brought by [[esophageal dilatation]] and surgical cleaving of the muscle ([[Heller myotomy]]).

The most common form is primary achalasia, which has no known underlying cause. It is due to the failure of distal esophageal inhibitory neurons.  However, a small proportion occurs secondary to other conditions, such as [[esophageal cancer]] or [[Chagas disease]] (an infectious disease common in South America).<ref name=Spiess/> Achalasia affects about one person in 100,000 per year.<ref name=Spiess/><ref name=Lake/> Prevalence of the condition is 10 in 1,000,000 individuals. There is no gender predominance for the occurrence of disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=DL|coauthors=Katzka, DA|title=Achalasia: update on the disease and its treatment.|journal=Gastroenterology|date=2010 Aug|volume=139|issue=2|pages=369–74|pmid=20600038|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2010.06.024|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptoms of achalasia are [[dysphagia]] (difficulty in swallowing), [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]] of undigested food, [[chest pain]] behind the sternum, and weight loss.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dughera|first=L|coauthors=Cassolino, P, Cisarò, F, Chiaverina, M|title=Achalasia.|journal=Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica|date=2008 Sep|volume=54|issue=3|pages=277–85|pmid=18614976}}</ref> Dysphagia tends to become progressively worse over time and to involve both fluids and solids. Some people may also experience [[cough]]ing when lying in a horizontal position.
The chest pain experienced, also known as cardiospasm and non-cardiac chest pain can often be mistaken for a heart attack. It can be extremely painful in some sufferers.  Food and liquid, including saliva, are retained in the esophagus and may be inhaled into the lungs ([[pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]).

==Mechanism==
The cause of most cases of achalasia is unknown.<ref>=Tx11{{cite journal|last=Cheatham|first=JG|coauthors=Wong, RK|title=Current approach to the treatment of achalasia.|journal=Current gastroenterology reports|date=2011 Jun|volume=13|issue=3|pages=219–25|pmid=21424734}}</ref> LES pressure and relaxation are regulated by excitatory (e.g., acetylcholine, substance P) and inhibitory (e.g., nitric oxide, vasoactive intestinal peptide) neurotransmitters. Persons with achalasia lack nonadrenergic, noncholinergic, inhibitory ganglion cells, causing an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The result is a hypertensive nonrelaxed esophageal sphincter.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/169974-overview</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:AchalasiaCT.jpg|thumb|An axial CT image showing marked dilatation of the esophagus in a person with achalasia.]]
Due to the similarity of symptoms, achalasia can be mistaken for more common disorders such as [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD), [[hiatus hernia]], and even [[psychosomatic]] disorders.
Specific tests for achalasia are [[barium swallow]] and [[esophageal manometry]]. In addition, [[endoscopy]] of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum ([[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]] or EGD), with or without [[endoscopic ultrasound]], is typically performed to rule out the possibility of cancer.<ref name=Spiess/>  The internal tissue of the esophagus generally appears normal in [[endoscopy]], although a "pop" may be observed as the scope is passed through the non-relaxing [[lower esophageal sphincter]] with some difficulty, and food debris may be found above the LES.

===Barium swallow===

[[Image:Acha.JPG|thumb|100px|"Bird's beak" appearance and "[[Megaesophagus]]," typical in achalasia.]]The patient swallows a barium solution, with continuous [[fluoroscopy]] (X-ray recording) to observe the flow of the fluid through the esophagus. Normal peristaltic movement of the esophagus is not seen.  There is acute tapering at the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] and narrowing at the [[cardia|gastro-esophageal junction]], producing a "bird's beak" or "rat's tail" appearance. The esophagus above the narrowing is often dilated (enlarged) to varying degrees as the esophagus is gradually stretched over time.<ref name=Spiess/> An air-fluid margin is often seen over the barium column due to the lack of peristalsis. A five-minutes timed barium swallow can provide a useful benchmark to measure the effectiveness of treatment.

===Esophageal manometry===
[[Image:Achalasia EMS.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic of manometry in achalasia showing [[peristalsis|aperistaltic]] contractions, increased intraesophageal pressure, and failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.]]
Because of its sensitivity, manometry (esophageal motility study) is considered the key test for establishing the diagnosis. A thin tube is inserted through the nose, and the patient is instructed to swallow several times. The probe measures muscle contractions in different parts of the esophagus during the act of swallowing. Manometry reveals failure of the LES to relax with swallowing and lack of functional peristalsis in the smooth muscle esophagus.<ref name=Spiess/>

Characteristic manometric findings are:{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
* Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to relax upon wet swallow (<75% relaxation)
* Pressure of LES <26&nbsp;mm Hg is normal,>100 is considered as achlasia, > 200 is nut cracker achlasia.
* Aperistalsis in esophageal body
* Relative increase in intra-esophageal pressure as compared with intra-gastric pressure

===Biopsy===
[[Biopsy]], the removal of a tissue sample during endoscopy, is not typically necessary in achalasia but if performed shows [[hypertrophy|hypertrophied]] musculature and absence of certain nerve cells of the [[myenteric plexus]], a network of nerve fibers that controls esophageal peristalsis.<ref name=pathology>{{cite book | author= Emanuel Rubin, Fred Gorstein, Raphael Rubin, Roland Schwarting, David Strayer | title = Rubin's Pathology - clinicopathological foundations of medicine | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year = 2001 | location = Maryland | pages=665 | isbn=0-7817-4733-3 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Sublingual [[nifedipine]] significantly improves outcomes in 75% of people with mild or moderate disease.  Surgical myotomy provides greater benefit than either botulinum toxin or dilation in those who fail medical management.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang L, Li YM, Li L |title=Meta-analysis of randomized and controlled treatment trials for achalasia |journal=Dig. Dis. Sci. |volume=54 |issue=11 |pages=2303–11 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19107596 |doi=10.1007/s10620-008-0637-8 |url=}}</ref>

===Lifestyle changes===
Both before and after treatment, achalasia patients may need to eat slowly, chew very well, drink plenty of water with meals, and avoid eating near bedtime. Raising the head of the bed or sleeping with a wedge pillow promotes emptying of the esophagus by gravity. After surgery or pneumatic dilatation, [[proton pump inhibitors]] are required to prevent reflux damage by inhibiting gastric acid secretion, and foods that can aggravate [[Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease|reflux]], including ketchup, citrus, chocolate, alcohol, and caffeine, may need to be avoided.

===Medication===
Drugs that reduce LES pressure are useful.  These include [[calcium channel blockers]] such as [[nifedipine]]<ref name=Wang>{{cite journal |author=Wang L, Li YM, Li L |title=Meta-analysis of randomized and controlled treatment trials for achalasia |journal = Dig. Dis. Sci. |volume=54 |issue=11 |pages=2303–11 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19107596 |doi=10.1007/s10620-008-0637-8}}</ref> and [[nitrates]] such as [[isosorbide dinitrate]] and [[nitroglycerin]].  However, many patients experience unpleasant side effects such as [[headache]] and swollen feet, and these drugs often stop helping after several months.

[[Botulinum toxin]] (Botox) may be injected into the lower esophageal sphincter to paralyze the muscles holding it shut.  As in the case of cosmetic Botox, the effect is only temporary and lasts about 6 months. Botox injections cause scarring in the sphincter which may increase the difficulty of later [[Heller myotomy]].  This therapy is recommended only for patients who cannot risk surgery, such as elderly persons in poor health.<ref name=Spiess>{{cite journal |author=Spiess AE, Kahrilas PJ |title=Treating achalasia: from whalebone to laparoscope |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=7 |pages=638–42 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9718057 | url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/280/7/638 |doi=10.1001/jama.280.7.638}}</ref>

===Pneumatic dilatation===
In [[Esophageal dilatation|balloon (pneumatic) dilation]] or dilatation, the muscle fibers are stretched and slightly torn by forceful inflation of a balloon placed inside the lower esophageal sphincter. Gastroenterologists who specialize in achalasia have performed many of these forceful balloon dilatations and achieve better results and fewer perforations. There is always a small risk of a perforation which requires immediate surgical repair. Pneumatic dilatation causes some scarring which may increase the difficulty of [[Heller myotomy]] if the surgery is needed later. [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)]] occurs after pneumatic dilatation in some patients. Pneumatic dilatation is most effective in the long term on patients over the age of 40; the benefits tend to be shorter-lived in younger patients. It may need to be repeated with larger balloons for maximum effectiveness.<ref name=Lake>{{cite journal |author=Lake JM, Wong RK |title=Review article: the management of achalasia - a comparison of different treatment modalities |journal=Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=909–18 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16948803 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03079.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03079.x}}</ref>

===Surgery===
[[Heller myotomy]] helps 90% of achalasia patients.  It can usually be performed by a [[Laparoscopic surgery|keyhole approach]] or laparoscopically.<ref name=Deb_2005>{{cite journal |author=Deb S, Deschamps C, Cassivi SD, et al. |title=Laparoscopic esophageal myotomy for achalasia:  factors affecting functional results |journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=1191–1195 |year=2005 |pmid=16181839 |doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.04.008}}</ref> The myotomy is a lengthwise cut along the esophagus, starting above the LES and extending down onto the stomach a little way. The esophagus is made of several layers, and the myotomy cuts only through the outside muscle layers which are squeezing it shut, leaving the inner muscosal layer intact. A partial [[Nissen fundoplication|fundoplication]] or "wrap" is generally added in order to prevent excessive [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|reflux]], which can cause serious damage to the esophagus over time.  After surgery, patients should keep to a [[soft diet]] for several weeks to a month, avoiding foods that can aggravate reflux.

Most recommended fundoplication along with Heller's myotomy is Dor's fundoplication. It consists of 180 to 200 degree anterior wrap around the esophagus. It provides excellent result as compared to Nissen's fundoplication which is associated with higher incidence of the post surgery dysphagia.<ref name = Rebecchi>{{cite journal |author=Rebecchi F, Giaccone C, Farinella E, Campaci R, Morino M |title=Randomized controlled trial of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus Nissen fundoplication for achalasia: long-term results |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=248 |issue=6 |pages=1023–30 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19092347 |doi=10.1097/SLA.0b013e318190a776 |url=}}</ref>

===Follow-up===
Follow-up monitoring: Even after successful treatment of achalasia, swallowing may still deteriorate over time. The esophagus should be checked every year or two with a timed barium swallow because some may need pneumatic dilatations, a repeat myotomy, or even [[esophagectomy]] after many years.  In addition, some physicians recommend pH testing and endoscopy to check for reflux damage, which may lead to a premalignant condition known as [[Barrett's esophagus]] or a stricture if untreated.

==Epidemiology==
Incidence of achalasia is 1 to 2 per 200,000. Disease affects young adults in their 20s and 30s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
