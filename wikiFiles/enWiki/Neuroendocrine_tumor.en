'''Neuroendocrine tumors''' (NETs) are [[neoplasms]] that arise from cells of the [[endocrine]] ([[hormonal]]) and [[nervous system]]s. Many are [[benign]], while some are [[malignant]]. They most commonly occur in the intestine, where they are called [[carcinoid]] tumors, but they are also found in the lung and the rest of the body.

Although there are many kinds of NETs, they are treated as a group of tissue because the cells of these neoplasms share common features, such as looking similar, having special [[secretory granule]]s, and often producing biogenic [[amines]] and [[polypeptide]] [[hormone]]s.<ref name="Ramage2005">{{cite journal |author=Ramage JK, Davies AH, Ardill J, ''et al.''|title=Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours |journal=Gut |volume=Suppl 4 |issue= suppl_4|pages=iv1–16 |year=2005 |series=54 |month=Jun|pmid=15888809|pmc=1867801|doi=10.1136/gut.2004.053314|url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/54/suppl_4/iv1}}</ref>

==Background==

===Neuroendocrine system===
NETs are believed to arise from various [[neuroendocrine cell]]s whose normal function is to serve at the [[neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] interface. Neuroendocrine cells are present not only in [[endocrine]] glands throughout the body that produce [[hormone]]s, but also diffused in all body tissues.<ref name="Langley1994">{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1749-6632.1994.tb17251.x}}</ref>

===History===

Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors were first distinguished from other tumors in 1907.<ref name="Modlin">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.humpath.2004.09.018}}</ref><ref name="Arnold">{{cite book |author=Arnold R, Göke R, Wied M, Behr T |chapter=Chapter 15 Neuroendocrine Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic (GEP) Tumors|editor=Scheppach W, Bresalier RS, Tytgat GNJ |title=Gastrointestinal and Liver Tumors |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2003|pages=195–233|isbn=3-540-43462-3 |oclc=|doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> They were named carcinoid tumors because their slow growth was considered to be "cancer-like" rather than truly cancerous.<ref name="Arnold" />

However, in 1938 it was recognized that some of these small bowel tumors could be malignant.<ref name="Modlin" /><ref name="Arnold" /> Despite the differences between these two original categories, and further complexities due to subsequent inclusion of other NETs of pancreas and pulmonary origin, all NETs are sometimes (incorrectly) subsumed into the term "carcinoid."

[[Enterochromaffin]] cells, which give rise to carcinoid tumors, were identified in 1897 by [[Kulchitsky]]<ref name="Modlin" /> and their secretion of [[serotonin]] was established in 1953<ref name="Modlin" /> when the "flushing" effect of serotonin had become clinically recognized. Carcinoid heart disease was identified in 1952<ref name="Modlin" /> and carcinoid fibrosis in 1961.<ref name="Modlin" />

Neuroendocrine tumors were sometimes called [[Apudoma|APUDomas]] because these cells often show [[amine|<u>'''a'''</u>mine]] <u>'''p'''</u>recursor ([[L-DOPA]] and [[5-hydroxytryptophan]]) <u>'''u'''</u>ptake and <u>'''d'''</u>ecarboxylation to produce biogenic amines such as [[catecholamine]]s and [[serotonin]].  Although this behavior was also part of the disproven hypothesis that these cells might all [[embryology|embryologically]] arise from the [[neural crest]],<ref name="Langley1994" /><ref name="Warner" /><ref name="Öberg1998">{{cite pmid|10388123}}</ref> neuroendocrine cells sometimes produce various types of hormones and amines,<ref name="Öberg1998" /> and they can also have strong receptors for other hormones to which they respond.

There have been multiple nomenclature systems for these tumors,<ref name="Klimstra2010">{{cite doi|10.1097/MPA.0b013e3181ec124e}}</ref> and the differences between these schema have often been confusing.<ref name="Klimstra2010" /> Nonetheless, these systems all distinguish between well-[[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] (low and intermediate-[[Grading (tumors)|grade]]) and poorly differentiated (high-grade) NETs.<ref name="Klimstra2010" /> Cellular proliferative rate is of considerable significance in this [[prognosis|prognostic assessment]].<ref name="Klimstra2010" />

===Incidence===
Although estimates vary, the annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of clinically significant neuroendocrine tumors is approximately 2.5-5 per 100,000;<ref name="Öberg2011">{{cite doi|10.1007/s10555-011-9292-1}}</ref> two thirds are carcinoid tumors and one third are other NETs.

The [[prevalence]] has been estimated as 35 per 100,000,<ref name="Öberg2011" /> and may be considerably higher if clinically silent tumors are included. An [[autopsy]] study of the pancreas in people who died from unrelated causes discovered a remarkably high incidence of tiny asymptomatic NETs. Routine microscopic study of three random sections of the pancreas found NETs in 1.6%, and multiple sections identified NETs in 10%.<ref name="Kimura1991">{{cite doi|10.1007/BF01297144}}</ref> As diagnostic imaging increases in sensitivity, such as [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] [[ultrasonography]], very small, clinically insignificant NETs may be coincidentally discovered; being unrelated to symptoms, such neoplasms may not require surgical excision.

===Categories===

====WHO classification====

The World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme places neuroendocrine tumors into three main categories:<ref name="Klimstra2010" /><ref name="Tan2011" />
* well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours, further subdivided into tumors with benign and those with uncertain behavior
* well-differentiated (low grade) neuroendocrine carcinomas with low-grade malignant behavior
* poorly differentiated (high grade) neuroendocrine carcinomas, which are the large cell neuroendocrine and small cell carcinomas.

Additionally, the WHO scheme recognizes mixed tumors with both neuroendocrine and [[epithelial]] carcinoma features, such as [[Goblet cell carcinoid|goblet cell cancer]], a rare  [[gastrointestinal tract]] [[tumor]].<ref name="vanEeden2007">{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2559.2007.02883.x}}</ref>

Placing a given tumor into one of categories depends on well-defined [[histology|histological]] features: size, [[lymphovascular invasion]], [[mitosis|mitotic]] counts, [[Ki-67 (protein)|Ki-67]] labelling index, invasion of adjacent organs, presence of [[metastasis|metastases]] and whether they produce [[hormone]]s.<ref name="Klimstra2010" /><ref name="Tan2011" />

====Anatomic distribution====
NETs can arise in many different areas of the body, and are most often located in the intestine or the lungs.

The various kinds of cells that can give rise to NETs are present in endocrine glands and are also diffusely distributed throughout the body, most commonly [[Enterochromaffin cell|Kulchitsky cells]] or similar enterochromaffin-like cells, that are relatively more common in the gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems.<ref name="Liu2001">{{cite journal |author=Liu Y, Sturgis CD, Grzybicki DM, ''et al.'' |title=Microtubule-associated protein-2: a new sensitive and specific marker for pulmonary carcinoid tumor and small cell carcinoma|journal=Mod Pathol. |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=880–5|year=2001|month=Sep|pmid=11557784|doi=10.1038/modpathol.3880406|url=http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v14/n9/full/3880406a.html}}
</ref>
NETs include certain tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and of the pancreatic [[islet cell]]s,<ref name="Ramage2005" /> certain thymus and lung tumors, and [[Medullary thyroid cancer|medullary carcinoma]] of the [[parafollicular]] cells of the [[thyroid]].<ref name="Ramage2005" /> Tumors with similar cellular characteristics in the [[pituitary]], [[parathyroid]], and [[adrenal|adrenomedullary]] glands are sometimes included<ref name="Rufini">{{cite journal |author=Rufini V, Calcagni ML, Baum RP |title=Imaging of neuroendocrine tumors|journal=Semin Nucl Med|volume=36|issue=3 |pages=228–47|year=2006 |month=Jul |pmid=16762613|doi=10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2006.03.007|url=}}</ref> or excluded.<ref name="Ramage2005" />

Within the broad category of neuroendocrine tumors there are many different tumor types:<ref>{{cite pmid|15053292}}</ref> this outline is presented to facilitate retrieving information. It is quite clear that neuroendocrine tumors are uncommon in many of these areas, and frequently represent only a very small proportion of the tumors or cancers at these locations.

====TNM stage====

A [[TNM staging system|TNM]] scheme has been proposed for NETs by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.<ref name="Tan2011" />

==Histopathology==
[[File:Small intestine neuroendocrine tumour low mag.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Small intestine|Small intestinal]] neuroendocrine tumor at bottom third of image, showing the typical [[intramural]] (within the wall) location, and overlying intact [[epithelium]]. [[H&E stain]].]]

===Features in common===
Neuroendocrine tumors, despite differing [[embryology|embryological]] origin, have
common [[phenotypic]] characteristics. {{citation}}

NETs show [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] immunoreactivity for markers of neuroendocrine [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] (pan-neuroendocrine tissue markers) and may secrete various peptides and hormones. There is a lengthy list of potential markers in neuroendocrine tumors; several reviews provide assistance in understanding these markers.<ref name="Berretta2010">{{cite doi|10.2741/s68}}</ref><ref name="Ferolla2008">{{Cite pmid|18401212}}</ref> Widely used neuroendocrine tissue markers are various [[chromogranin]]s, [[synaptophysin]] and [[PGP9.5]]. [[Neuron-specific enolase]] (NSE) is less [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]].<ref name="Ramage2005" /><ref name="Liu2001" />

NETs are often small, yellow or tan masses, often located in the [[submucosa]] or more deeply intramurally, and they can be very firm due to an accompanying intense [[desmoplastic]] reaction.  The overlying mucosa may be either intact or [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ated. Some GEP-NETs invade deeply to involve the [[mesentery]].

Histologically, NETs are an example of "small blue cell tumors," showing uniform cells which have a round to oval stippled nucleus and scant, pink granular cytoplasm.  The cells may align variously in islands, glands or sheets. High power examination shows bland cytopathology.  Electron microscopy can identify secretory granules. There is usually minimal [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphism]] but  less commonly there can be [[anaplasia]], [[mitosis|mitotic]] activity, and [[necrosis]].

Some neuroendocrine tumor cells possess especially strong [[hormone]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, such as [[somatostatin]] receptors and uptake hormones strongly. This [[avidity]] can assist in diagnosis and may make some tumors vulnerable to hormone targeted therapies.

====Argentaffin and hormone secretion====
NETs from a particular anatomical origin often show similar behavior as a group, such as the [[foregut]] (which conceptually includes pancreas, and even thymus, airway and lung NETs), [[midgut]] and [[hindgut]]; individual tumors within these sites can differ from these group benchmarks:

* Foregut NETs are [[argentaffin]] negative. Despite low serotonin content, they often secrete [[5-hydroxytryptophan]] (5-HTP), histamine, and several polypeptide hormones. There may be associated atypical carcinoid syndrome, acromegaly, Cushing disease, other endocrine disorders, telangiectasia, or hypertrophy of the skin in the face and upper neck.<ref>Tebbi CK. Carcinoid Tumor. http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/986050-overview</ref> These tumors can metastasize to bone.
* Midgut NETs are argentaffin positive, can produce high levels of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), kinins, prostaglandins, substance P (SP), and other vasoactive peptides, and sometimes produce corticotropic hormone (previously adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]). Bone metastasis is uncommon.
* Hindgut NETs are argentaffin negative and rarely secrete 5-HT, 5-HTP, or any other vasoactive peptides.  Bone metastases are not uncommon.

==Symptoms==

===GEP-NET (Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors)===
There are two main types of NET within this category:

====Carcinoid tumors====
{{Main|Carcinoid}}

(about two thirds of GEP-NETs)

Carcinoids most commonly affect the small bowel, particularly the ileum, and are the most common malignancy of the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]]. Many carcinoids are asymptomatic and are discovered only upon surgery for unrelated causes. These coincidental carcinoids are common; one study found that one person in ten has them.<ref name="Kimura">{{cite journal |author=Kimura W, Kuroda A, Morioka Y |title=Clinical pathology of endocrine tumors of the pancreas. Analysis of autopsy cases |journal=Dig Dis Sci. |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=933–42 |year=1991 |month=Jul |pmid=2070707 |doi= 10.1007/BF01297144|url=}}"[In] 800 autopsy cases, ... incidence of tumor was 10% (6/60) in individuals having histological studies of all sections of the pancreas"</ref> Many tumors do not cause symptoms even when they have metastasized.<ref name="Arnold" /> Other tumors even if very small can produce adverse effects by secreting hormones.<ref name="Pommier" />

10%<ref name="HC">Health Communities. Carcinoid Tumor Overview. http://www.healthcommunities.com/carcinoid-malignancy/carcinoid-malignancy-overview.shtml</ref> or less of carcinoids, primarily some midgut carcinoids, secrete excessive levels of a range of [[hormone]]s, most notably [[serotonin]] (5-HT) or [[substance P]],<ref name="Kvols">Kvols LK. 2002. Carcinoid Tumors and the Carcinoid Syndrome: What's New in the Therapeutic Pipeline. (The Carcinoid Cancer Foundation: Carcinoid Symposium 2002)http://www.carcinoid.org/content/carcinoid-tumors-and-carcinoid-syndrome-whats-new-therapeutic-pipeline</ref> causing a constellation of symptoms called [[carcinoid syndrome]]:

* [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]]
* [[diarrhea]]
* [[asthma]] or wheezing
* [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF)
* abdominal cramping
* [[peripheral edema]]
* heart palpitations

A carcinoid crisis with profound flushing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, and widely and rapidly fluctuating blood pressure<ref name="Ramage2005" /> can occur if large amounts of hormone are acutely secreted,<ref name="Kvols" /> which is occasionally triggered by factors such as diet,<ref name="Kvols" /> alcohol,<ref name="Kvols" /> surgery<ref name="Ramage2005" /><ref name="Kvols" /> chemotherapy,<ref name="Kvols" /> embolization therapy<ref name="Ramage2005" />  or radiofrequency ablation.<ref name="Ramage2005" />

Chronic exposure to high levels of serotonin causes thickening of the [[heart valves]], particularly the [[tricuspid]] and the [[pulmonic]] valves, and over a long period can lead to [[congestive heart failure]].<ref name="Kvols" /> However, valve replacement is rarely needed.<ref name="Benson2010" /> The excessive outflow of serotonin can cause a depletion of [[tryptophan]] leading to [[niacin]] deficiency, and thus [[pellagra]],<ref name="Ramage2005" /> which is associated with dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea.

Many other hormones can be secreted by some of these tumors, most commonly [[growth hormone]] that can cause [[acromegaly]], or cortisol, that can cause [[Cushing's syndrome]].

Occasionally, [[haemorrhage]] or the effects of tumor bulk are the presenting symptoms. [[Bowel obstruction]] can occur, sometimes due to [[fibrosis|fibrosing]] effects of NET secretory products<ref name="Pommier" /> with an intense desmoplastic reaction at the tumor site, or of the [[mesentery]].

====Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs)====
(about one third of GEP-NETs)

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PETs or PNETs; not to be confused with the [[Primitive neuroectodermal tumor|primitive neuroectodermal PNET]]) can originate within the pancreas or from similar neuroendocrine cells outside of the pancreas. It is unclear whether pancreatic tumors originate from the usual cells of the [[islet of Langerhans]] or from diffuse neuroendocrine [[pluripotent]] cells.<ref name="Arnold" /> PNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of [[pancreatic cancer]], adenocarcinoma, which arises in the exocrine pancreas. About 95 percent of pancreatic tumors are adenocarcinoma; only 1 or 2% of clinically significant pancreas neoplasms are GEP-NETs.

Well or intermediately differentiated PNETs are sometimes called [[islet cell]] tumors; neuroendocrine cancer (NEC) is more aggressive.

About 70-85% PNETs are functional, secreting hormones that cause symptoms.  About 15 to 30 percent of PETs are nonsecretory or nonfunctional, which either don’t secrete, or the quantity or type of products do not cause a clinical syndrome, such as [[pancreatic polypeptide]] (PPoma), [[chromogranin]] A, and [[neurotensin]]<ref name="Jensen2008" /> although blood levels may be elevated.  Functional tumors are often classified by the hormone most strongly secreted, for example:

* [[gastrinoma]]: the excessive [[gastrin]] causes [[Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome]] (ZES) with [[peptic ulcer]]s and [[diarrhea]]
* [[insulinoma]]:<ref name="Grant2005">{{cite pmid|16253900}}</ref> [[hypoglycemia]] occurs with concurrent elevations of [[insulin]], [[proinsulin]] and [[C peptide]]<ref name="Benson2010" />
* [[glucagonoma]]: the symptoms are not all due to glucagon elevations,<ref name="Benson2010" /> and include a [[Necrolytic migratory erythema|
rash]], sore mouth, altered bowel habits, venous [[thrombosis]], and high blood glucose levels<ref name="Benson2010" />
* [[VIPoma]], producing excessive [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], which may cause profound chronic '''<u>w</u>'''atery <u>'''d'''</u>[[diarrhea|iarrhea]] and resultant [[dehydration]], <u>'''h'''</u>[[hypokalemia|ypokalemia]], and '''<u>a</u>'''[[achlorhydria|chlorhydria]] (WDHA or pancreatic cholera syndrome)
* [[somatostatinoma]]: these rare tumors are associated with elevated blood glucose levels, [[achlorhydria]], [[cholelithiasis]], and [[diarrhea]]<ref name="Benson2010" />
* less common types include [[adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTHoma]], [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]]oma, [[calcitonin]]oma, [[GHRH]]oma, [[Growth hormone-releasing factor|GRFoma]], and [[parathyroid]] hormone–related peptide tumor

In these functional tumors, the frequency of malignancy and the survival [[prognosis]] have been estimated dissimilarly, but a pertinent accessible summary is available.<ref name="Ramage2005" />

===Other===
In addition to the two main categories, there are rarer forms of GEP-NETs, including neuroendocrine lung, thymus and parathyroid tumors.
Bronchial carcinoid can cause airway obstruction, [[pneumonia]], [[pleurisy]], difficulty with breathing, cough, and [[hemoptysis]], or may be associated with weakness, nausea, weight loss, night sweats, neuralgia, and Cushing’s syndrome. Some are asymptomatic.

Animal neuroendocrine tumors include neuroendocrine cancer of the liver in dogs, and [[Devil facial tumor disease]] in [[Tasmanian Devil]]s.<ref name="Bostanci">Bostanci A. Wildlife biology.

==Diagnosis==

===Markers===
Symptoms from secreted hormones may prompt measurement of the corresponding hormones in the blood or their associated urinary products, for initial diagnosis or to assess the interval change in the tumor. Secretory activity of the tumor cells is sometimes dissimilar to the tissue immunoreactivity to particular hormones.<ref name="Ferolla2008" />

Given the diverse secretory activity of NETs there are many other potential markers, but a limited panel is usually sufficient for clinical purposes.<ref name="Ramage2005" />
Aside from the hormones of secretory tumors, the most important markers are :
* [[chromogranin]] A (CgA) {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* urine [[5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (5-HIAA)
* [[neuron-specific enolase]] (NSE, gamma-gamma dimer)
* [[synaptophysin]] (P38)

Newer markers include [[N-terminal]]ly truncated variant of [[Hsp70]] is present in NETs but absent in normal pancreatic islets.<ref name="Öberg2005b">{{cite journal |author=Oberg K |title=Neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract: recent advances in molecular genetics, diagnosis, and treatment|journal=Curr Opin Oncol. |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=386–91 |year=2005 |month=Jul|pmid=15933475 |doi= 10.1097/01.cco.0000167739.56948.a9|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1040-8746&volume=17&issue=4&spage=386}}</ref>  High levels of [[CDX2]], a [[homeobox]] gene product essential for intestinal development and differentiation, are seen in intestinal NETs.<ref name="Öberg2005b" />  Neuroendocrine secretory protein-55, a member of the [[chromogranin]] family, is seen in pancreatic endocrine tumors but not intestinal NETs.<ref name="Öberg2005b" />

===Imaging===
[[CT-scans]], [[MRIs]], [[sonography]] (ultrasound), and [[endoscopy]] (including endoscopic ultrasound) are common diagnostic tools.  CT-scans using contrast medium can detect 95 percent of tumors over 3&nbsp;cm in size, but generally not tumors under 1&nbsp;cm.<ref name="Tan2011">{{cite doi|10.5306/wjco.v2.i1.28}}</ref>

Advances in nuclear medicine imaging, also known as molecular imaging, has improved diagnostic and treatment paradigms in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. This is because of its ability to not only identify sites of disease but also characterize them. Neuronedocrine tumours express somatostatin receptors providing a unique target for imaging. Octreotide is a synthetic modifications of somatostatin with a longer half-life. OctreoScan, also called somatostatin receptor [[scintigraphy]] (SRS or SSRS), utilizes [[intravenous]]ly administered octreotide that is chemically bound to a radioactive substance, often [[indium]]-111, to detect larger lesions with tumor cells that are avid for octreotide.

Somatostatin receptor imaging can now be performed with positron emission tomography (PET) which offers higher resolution, three-dimensional and more rapid imaging. [[Gallium]]-68 receptor [[positron emission tomography|PET]]-CT is much more accurate than an OctreoScan.<ref name="Ga68SSTR">{{Cite pmid|22339744}}</ref>

Imaging with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is also valuable to image neuroendocrine tumors.<ref name="FDGPET">{{Cite pmid|22846204}}</ref> This scan is performed by injected radioactive sugar intravenously. Tumors that grow more quickly use more sugar. Using this scan, the aggressiveness of the tumor can be visualised.

The combination of somatostatin receptor and FDG PET imaging is able to quantify somatostatin receptor cell surface (SSTR) expression and glycolytic metabolism, respectively.<ref name="FDGPET" /> The ability to perform this as a whole body study is highlighting the limitations of relying on histopathology obtained from a single site. This is enabling better selection of the most appropriate therapy for an individual patient.

==Genetics==

===Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors===
[[DNA]] [[mutation]] analysis in well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors identified four important findings:<ref name="Jiao2011">{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1200609}}</ref>

* as expected, the [[gene]]s mutated in NETs, [[MEN1]], [[ATRX]], [[DAXX]], [[TSC2]], [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] and [[PIK3CA]],<ref name="Jiao2011" /> are different from the mutated genes previously found in [[pancreatic cancer|pancreatic]] [[adenocarcinoma]].<ref name="Jones2008">{{cite pmid|18772397}}</ref><ref name="Harada2009">{{cite pmid|19077451}}</ref>

* one in six well-differentiated pancreatic NETs have mutations in  [[mTOR]] pathway genes, such as [[TSC2]], [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] and [[PIK3CA]].<ref name="Jiao2011" />  The sequencing discovery might allow selection of which NETs would benefit from mTOR inhibition such as with [[everolimus]], but this awaits validation in a [[clinical trial]].

* mutations affecting a new cancer pathway involving [[ATRX]] and [[DAXX]] genes were found in about 40% of pancreatic NETs.<ref name="Jiao2011" />  The proteins encoded by ATRX and DAXX participate in [[chromatin]] remodeling of [[telomere]]s;<ref name="Heaphy2011">{{cite pmid|21719641}}</ref>  these mutations are associated with a [[telomerase]]-independent maintenance mechanism termed ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) that results in abnormally long telomeric ends of [[chromosomes]].<ref name="Heaphy2011" />

* [[ATRX]]/[[DAXX]] and [[MEN1]] mutations were associated with a better [[prognosis]].<ref name="Jiao2011" />

===Familial syndromes===
Neuroendocrine tumors can be seen in several inherited familial syndromes,<ref name="Jensen2008" /> including:
* [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1]] (MEN1)
* [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2]] (MEN2)
* [[von Hippel-Lindau]] (VHL) disease<ref name="Jensen2008" />
* [[neurofibromatosis]] type 1<ref name="Hirsch2001" />
* [[tuberous sclerosis]]<ref name="Lodish2010" /><ref name="Dworakowska2008" />
* [[Carney's complex|Carney complex]]<ref name="OMIM160980" /><ref name="OMIM605244" />

Recommendations in NET include family history evaluation, evaluation for second tumors, and in selected circumstances testing for germline mutations such as for MEN1.<ref name="Ramage2005" />

==Treatment==

===Overview===
Several issues help define appropriate treatment of a neuroendocrine tumor, including its location, invasiveness, hormone secretion, and metastasis. Treatments may be aimed at curing the disease or at relieving symptoms ([[palliation]]).

Observation may be feasible for non-functioning low grade neuroendocrine tumors.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

If the tumor is locally advanced or has metastasized, but is nonetheless slowly growing, treatment that relieves symptoms may often be preferred over immediate challenging surgeries.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Intermediate and high grade tumors (noncarcinoids) are usually best treated by various early interventions (active therapy) rather than observation (wait-and-see approach).<ref name="Warner">{{cite doi|10.1053/j.gastro.2005.03.078}}</ref>

Treatments have improved over the past several decades, and outcomes are improving.<ref name="Pommier" /> In malignant carcinoid tumors with carcinoid syndrome, the [[median]] survival has improved from two years to more than eight years.<ref name="Öberg1998" />

Detailed guidelines for managing neuroendocrine tumors are available from [[European Society for Medical Oncology|ESMO]],<ref name="ESMO-NEC2010">{{cite doi|10.1093/annonc/mdq192}}</ref> [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network|NCCN]]<ref name="NCCN-NEC2011-1">http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/neuroendocrine.pdf</ref> and a UK panel.<ref name="Ramage2005" /> The [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]] has guidelines for several categories of NET: islet cell tumors of the pancreas,<ref name="NCI-ICT">National Cancer Institute.

Pheochromocytoma and Paragangliomahttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/pheochromocytoma</ref>

===Surgery===

Surgery is a curative treatment for some neuroendocrine tumors.

Even if the tumor has advanced and metastasized, making curative surgery infeasible, surgery often has a role in neuroendocrine cancers for [[palliation]] of symptoms and possibly improved survival.<ref name="Warner" />

===Symptomatic relief===

In secretory tumors, [[somatostatin]] [[Structural analog|analog]]s given subcutaneously or intramuscularly alleviate symptoms by blocking hormone release. A consensus review has reported on the use of somatostatin analogs for GEP-NETs.<ref name="Öberg2004">{{cite doi|10.1093/annonc/mdh216}}</ref>

These medications may also anatomically stabilize or shrink tumors, as suggested by the PROMID study (Placebo-controlled prospective randomized study on the antiproliferative efficacy of Octreotide LAR in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine MIDgut tumors): at least in this subset of NETs, average tumor stabilization was 14.3 months compared to 6 months for [[placebo]].<ref>http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=63&abstractID=10363</ref>

Other medications that block particular secretory effects can sometimes relieve symptoms.<ref name="Benson2010" />

===Chemotherapy===
[[Interferon]] is sometimes used to treat GEP-NETs.<ref name="Öberg2005a">Öberg K. Neuroendocrine Gastroenteropancreatic Tumours: Current Views on Diagnosis and Treatment. Business Briefing. European Oncology Review 2005; pages 1-6. http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1432/ACF237.pdf</ref> Its effectiveness is somewhat uncertain, but low doses can be [[titration|titrated]] within each person, often considering the effect on the blood [[leukocyte]] count;<ref name="Öberg2005a" />  interferon is often used in combination with other agents, especially somatostatin analogs such as octreotide.

====Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors====
Most gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors tend not to respond to chemotherapy agents,<ref name="Benson2010">Benson AB, Myerson RJ, and Sasson AR. Pancreatic, neuroendocrine GI, and adrenal cancers. Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach 13th edition 2010. ISBN 978-0-615-41824-7 Text is available electronically (but may require free registration) at http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management/pancreatic/article/10165/1802606</ref> showing 10 to 20% response rates that are typically less than 6 months.<ref name="Benson2010" /> Combining chemotherapy medications has not usually been of significant improvement<ref name="Benson2010" />  showing 25 to 35% response rates that are typically less than 9 months. The exceptions are poorly-[[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] (high-[[Grading (tumors)|grade]] or [[anaplastic]]) metastatic disease, where [[cisplatin]] with [[etoposide]] may be used<ref name="Benson2010" /> and [[Somatostatin]] Receptor Scintigraphy (SSRS) negative tumors which had a response rate in excess of 70% compared to 10% in strongly positive SRSS carcinoid tumors.<ref name="Ramage2005" />

====Pancreatic endocrine tumors====
PETs are more responsive to chemotherapy than are gastroenteric carcinoid tumors. Several agents have shown activity<ref name="Benson2010" /> and combining several medicines, particularly [[doxorubicin]] with [[streptozocin]] and [[fluorouracil]] (5-FU or f5U), is often more effective.<ref name="Benson2010" /> Although marginally effective in well-differentiated PETs, [[cisplatin]] with [[etoposide]] is active in poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine cancers (PDNECs).<ref name="Benson2010" />

Targeted chemotherapy agents have been approved in PETs by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] based on improved [[progression-free survival]] (PFS):
* [[everolimus]] (Afinitor) is labeled for treatment of progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.<ref name="ASCOPost20110515Evero">Everolimus Approved for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.

===Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT)===

In this type of [[radioisotope therapy]] (RIT)<ref name="Rufini" />  the tumor is treated [[intravenously]] with a peptide or hormone [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugated]] to a [[radionuclide]] or [[radioligand]], the peptide or neuroamine hormone previously having shown good uptake of a tracer dose, using Somatostatin receptor imaging as detailed above. This kind of RIT may be called [[peptide receptor radionuclide therapy]] (PRRT), or hormone-delivered [[radiotherapy]], and can attack all lesions in the body, not just liver metastases. The peptide receptor may be bound to [[Lutetium (177Lu) DOTA-octreotate|lutetium-177]], yttrium-90 or indium-111. This is a highly targeted and effective therapy with minimal side effects in tumors with high levels of somatostatin cell surface expression, because the radiation is absorbed at the sites of the tumor, or excreted in the urine. The radioactively labelled hormones enter the tumor cells which, together with nearby cells, are damaged by the attached radiation. Not all cells are immediately killed; cell death can go on for up to two years.

===Hepatic artery===

Metastases to the liver can be treated by several types of hepatic artery treatments based on the observation that tumor cells get nearly all their nutrients from the hepatic artery, while the normal cells of the liver get about 70-80 percent of their nutrients and 50% their oxygen supply from the portal vein, and thus can survive with the hepatic artery effectively blocked.
<ref name="Pommier">Pommier R. 2003. The role of surgery and chemoembolization in the management of carcinoid. California Carcinoid Fighters Conference. October 25, http://www.carcinoid.org/content/role-surgery-and-chemoembolization-management-carcinoid</ref><ref name="Fong">Fong, T and Schoenfield LJ. Arterial Chemotherapy Infusion of the Liver (and) Chemoembolization of the Liver (TACE)[http://www.medicinenet.com/chemo_infusion_and_chemoembolization_of_liver/article.htm]).
</ref>

Hepatic artery embolization (HAE) occludes the blood flow to the tumors,<ref name="Kvols" /> achieving significant tumor shrinkage in over 80%.<ref name="Kvols" />

In hepatic artery chemotherapy, the chemotherapy agents are given into the hepatic artery, often by steady infusion over hours or even days. Compared with systemic chemotherapy, a higher proportion of the chemotherapy agents are (in theory) delivered to the lesions in the liver.
<ref name="Fong" />

Hepatic artery chemoembolization (HACE), sometimes called transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), combines hepatic artery embolization with hepatic artery chemoinfusion: embospheres bound with chemotherapy agents, injected into the hepatic artery, lodge in downstream capillaries. The spheres not only block blood flow to the lesions, but by halting the chemotherapy agents in the neighborhood of the lesions, they provide a much better targeting leverage than chemoinfusion provides.

[[Selective internal radiation therapy]] (SIRT)<ref name="Welsh2006">{{cite pmid|16979443}}</ref> for neuroendocrine metastases to the liver<ref name="VdW2009-page321">{{cite pmid|19521311}}</ref> delivers radioactive microsphere therapy (RMT) by injection into the hepatic artery, lodging (as with HAE and HACE) in downstream capillaries. In contrast to hormone-delivered [[radiotherapy]], the lesions need not overexpress peptide receptors.  The mechanical targeting delivers the radiation from the yttrium-labeled microspheres selectively to the tumors without unduly affecting the normal liver.<ref name="Salem2002">{{cite pmid|12354840}}</ref> This type of treatment is FDA approved for liver metastases secondary to colorectal carcinoma and is under investigation for treatment of other liver malignancies, including neuroendocrine malignancies.<ref name="Welsh2006" />

===Other therapies===

[[Radiofrequency ablation]] (RFA) is used when a patient has relatively few metastases.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In RFA, a needle is inserted into the center of the lesion and current is applied to generate heat; the tumor cells are killed by cooking.

[[Cryoablation]] is similar to RFA; an endothermic substance{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} is injected into the tumors to kill by freezing. Cryoablation has been less successful for GEP-NETs than RFA.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
