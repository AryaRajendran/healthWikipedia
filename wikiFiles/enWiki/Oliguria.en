'''Oliguria''' is the low output of [[urine]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|/six/000074712|oliguria}}</ref> It is clinically classified as an output below 300-500ml/day.<ref name="Boon p475">Boon et al, Davidson's Principles & Practice of Medicine (20th Ed), p475</ref> The decreased output of urine may be a sign of [[dehydration]], [[renal failure]], [[hypovolemic shock]], HHNS [[hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome]], [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]], [[urinary obstruction]]/[[urinary retention]], [[DKA]], [[pre-eclampsia]], and [[urinary tract infection]]s, among other conditions.

The most extreme type of Oliguria is called [[anuria]], which represents an absence of urine, clinically classified as below 50ml/day.<ref name="Boon p475"/>

==Definition==
Oliguria is defined as a urine output that is less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants,<ref name=klahr>{{cite journal | author = Klahr S, Miller S | title = Acute oliguria | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 338 | issue = 10 | pages = 671–5 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9486997 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199803053381007}} [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/10/671 Free Full Text].</ref> less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children,<ref name=klahr/> and less than 400 mL<ref name=klahr/> or 500 mL<ref name=merck>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec06/ch063/ch063f.html Merck manuals > Oliguria] Last full review/revision March 2009 by Soumitra R. Eachempati</ref> per 24h in adults - this equals 17 or 21 mL/hour. For example, in an adult weighing 70&nbsp;kg it equals 0.24 or 0.3 ml/hour/kg. Alternatively, however, the value of 0.5 mL/kg/h is commonly used to define oliguria in adults as well.<ref name=merck/>

Olig- (or oligo-) is a Greek prefix meaning small or few.<ref>http://biology.about.com/od/prefixesandsuffixeso/g/blo3.htm</ref>

Anuria is defined as less than 50mL urine output per day.

==Testing==
Perform ultrasound examination of the kidney to rule out obstructive processes.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiologic mechanisms causing oliguria can be categorized globally in three different categories:<ref>http://beavermedic.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/the-kidneys/</ref>

*Prerenal: in response to [[hypoperfusion]] of the kidney (e.g. as a result of [[dehydration]] by poor oral intake, [[cardiogenic shock]], [[diarrhea]], massive [[bleeding]] or [[sepsis]])
*Renal: due to kidney damage (severe [[hypoperfusion]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[medication]])
*Postrenal: as a consequence of obstruction of the urine flow (e.g. [[enlarged prostate]], tumour compression urinary outflow, expanding [[hematoma]] or fluid collection)

===Postoperative oliguria===
Patients usually have decrease in urine output after a major operation that may be a normal physiological response to:
* fluid/ blood loss – decreased glomerular filtration rate secondary to hypovolemia and/or hypotension
* response of adrenal cortex to stress -increase in [[aldosterone]] (Na and water retention) and [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) release

==Oliguria in infants==
Oliguria, when defined as less than 1 mL/kg/h, in [[infant]]s is not considered to be a reliable sign of renal failure.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Arant B | title = Postnatal development of renal function during the first year of life | journal = Pediatr Nephrol | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 308–13 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3153294 | doi = 10.1007/BF00849229}}</ref>
