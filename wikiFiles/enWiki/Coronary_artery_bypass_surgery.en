'''Coronary artery bypass surgery''', also '''coronary artery bypass graft''' (CABG, pronounced "cabbage") '''surgery''', and colloquially '''heart bypass''' or '''bypass surgery''' is a [[surgery|surgical procedure]] performed to relieve [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and reduce the risk of death from [[Coronary heart disease|coronary artery disease]]. [[artery|Arteries]] or [[vein]]s from elsewhere in the patient's body are [[medical grafting|grafted]] to the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] to bypass [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[stenosis|narrowings]] and improve the [[blood]] supply to the [[coronary circulation]] supplying the [[myocardium]] (heart muscle). This surgery is usually performed with the heart stopped, necessitating the usage of [[cardiopulmonary bypass]]; techniques are available to perform CABG on a beating heart, so-called "off-pump" surgery.

==History==
The first coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in the [[United States]] on May 2, 1960, at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]]-[[Jacobi Medical Center|Bronx Municipal Hospital Center]] by a team led by Dr. Robert Goetz and the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Michael Rohman with the assistance of Dr. Jordan Haller and Dr. Ronald Dee.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dee | first1 = R |title=Who Assisted Whom? |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |publisher=Texas Heart Institute|location=Houston |volume=30 |issue=1 |page=90 |year=2003 |pmid=12638685 |pmc=152850 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Haller | first1 = JD | last2 = Olearchyk | first2 = AS |title=Cardiology's 10 Greatest Discoveries |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |publisher=Texas Heart Institute|location=Houston |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=342–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12484626 |pmc=140304 }}</ref> In this technique the vessels are held together with circumferential ligatures over an inserted metal ring. The internal mammary artery was used as the donor vessel and was anastomosed to the right coronary artery. The actual anastomosis with the Rosenbach ring took fifteen seconds and did not require cardiopulmonary bypass. The disadvantage of using the internal mammary artery was that, at autopsy nine months later, the anastomosis was open, but an atheromatous plaque had occluded the origin of the internal mammary that was used for the bypass.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} {{Verify source|date=June 2010}}

Russian [[cardiac surgeon]], Dr. [[Vasilii Kolesov]], performed the first successful internal mammary artery–coronary artery anastomosis in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kolessov | first1 = VI |title=Mammary artery-coronary artery anastomosis as method of treatment for angina pectoris |journal=J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=535–44 |year=1967 |month=October |pmid=6051440 }}</ref><ref name=Mehta02>{{cite journal | last1 = Mehta | first1 = NJ | last2 = Khan | first2 = IA |year=2002 |title=Cardiology's 10 Greatest Discoveries of the 20th Century |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=164–71 |pmc=124754 |pmid=12224718}}</ref>

Dr. [[René Favaloro]], an [[Argentine]] surgeon, achieved a physiologic approach in the surgical management of coronary artery disease—the bypass grafting procedure—at the Cleveland Clinic in May 1967.<ref name=Mehta02 /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Favaloro | first1 = RG | last2 = Effler | first2 = DB | last3 = Cheanvechai | first3 = C | last4 = Quint | first4 = RA | last5 = Sones Jr | first5 = FM |title=Acute coronary insufficiency (impending myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction): surgical treatment by the saphenous vein graft technique |journal=Am J Cardiol |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=598–607 |year=1971 |month=November |pmid=5116978 |doi=10.1016/0002-9149(71)90104-4}}</ref> His new technique used a [[Great saphenous vein|saphenous vein]] [[autograft]] to replace a [[stenotic]] segment of the [[right coronary artery]]. Later, he successfully used the [[saphenous vein]] as a bypassing channel, which has become the typical bypass graft technique we know today; in the U.S., this vessel is typically harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as [[endoscopic vessel harvesting]] (EVH). Soon Dr. Dudley Johnson extended the bypass to include left coronary arterial systems.<ref name=Mehta02/> In 1968, Doctors Charles Bailey, Teruo Hirose and George Green used the internal mammary artery instead of the [[saphenous]] vein for the grafting.<ref name=Mehta02/>

==Terminology==
[[Image:Heart saphenous coronary grafts.jpg|thumb|Three coronary artery bypass grafts, a LIMA to LAD and two [[saphenous vein]] grafts – one to the right coronary artery (RCA) system and one to the obtuse marginal (OM) system.]]
There are many variations on terminology, in which one or more of "artery", "bypass" or "graft" is left out. The most frequently used acronym for this type of surgery is '''CABG''' (pronounced 'cabbage'),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4484|title=Bypass Surgery, Coronary Artery|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref> pluralized as '''CABGs''' (pronounced 'cabbages'). More recently{{When|date=February 2011}} the term '''aortocoronary bypass (ACB)''' has come into popular use. '''CAGS''' (Coronary Artery Graft Surgery, pronounced phonetically) should not be confused with [[coronary angiography|coronary angiography (CAG)]].

[[Arteriosclerosis]] is a common arterial disorder characterized by thickening, loss of elasticity, and calcification of arterial walls, resulting in a decreased blood supply.

[[Atherosclerosis]] is a common arterial disorder characterized by yellowish plaques of [[cholesterol]], [[lipids]], and cellular debris in the inner layer of the walls of large and medium-sized arteries.

===Number of bypasses===
The terms ''single bypass'', ''double bypass'', ''triple bypass'', ''quadruple bypass'' and ''quintuple bypass'' refer to the number of coronary arteries bypassed in the procedure. In other words, a double bypass means two coronary arteries are bypassed (e.g. the [[left anterior descending|left anterior descending (LAD)]] coronary artery and [[right coronary artery|right coronary artery (RCA)]]); a triple bypass means three vessels are bypassed (e.g. LAD, RCA, [[left circumflex artery|left circumflex artery (LCX)]]); a quadruple bypass means four vessels are bypassed (e.g. LAD, RCA, LCX, first diagonal artery of the LAD) while quintuple means five. Bypass of more than four coronary arteries is uncommon.

A greater number of bypasses does not imply a person is "more sick", nor does a lesser number imply a person is "healthier."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ohki|first=S|author2=Kaneko T|author3=Satoh Y|author4=Inaba H|author5=Kaki N|author6=Yamagishi T|author7=Morishita Y|display-authors=3 |title=[Coronary artery bypass grafting in octogenarian] |language=Japanese |journal=Kyobu geka. the Japanese journal of thoracic surgery |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=829–33; discussion 833–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12233100 |doi=}}</ref> A person with a large amount of [[coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease (CAD)]] may receive fewer bypass grafts owing to the lack of suitable "target" vessels. A coronary artery may be unsuitable for bypass grafting if it is small (< 1&nbsp;mm or < 1.5&nbsp;mm depending on surgeon preference), heavily [[calcified]] (meaning the artery does not have a section free of CAD) or intramyocardial (the coronary artery is located within the heart muscle rather than on the surface of the heart). Similarly, a person with a single [[stenosis]] ("narrowing") of the [[Left coronary artery|left main]] coronary artery requires only two bypasses (to the LAD and the LCX). However, a left main lesion places a person at the highest risk for death from a cardiac cause.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The surgeon reviews the [[coronary angiogram]] prior to surgery and identifies the lesions (or "blockages") in the coronary arteries. The surgeon will estimate the number of bypass grafts prior to surgery, but the final decision is made in the operating room upon examination of the heart.

==Indications for CABG==
Several alternative treatments for coronary artery disease exist. They include:
* Medical management (anti-anginal medications plus [[statins]], [[antihypertensive]]s, [[smoking cessation]], tight [[blood sugar]] control in [[diabetes mellitus|diabetics]])
* [[Percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI)

Both PCI and CABG are more effective than medical management at relieving symptoms,<ref name=rihal>{{cite journal |author=Rihal C, Raco D, Gersh B, Yusuf S |title=Indications for coronary artery bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention in chronic stable angina: review of the evidence and methodological considerations |journal=Circulation |volume=108 |issue=20 |pages=2439–45 |year=2003 |pmid=14623791 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000094405.21583.7C |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/108/20/2439}}</ref> (e.g. [[Angina pectoris|angina]], [[dyspnea]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]).

The Surgery or Stent (SoS) trial was a randomized controlled trial that compared CABG to PCI with [[coronary stent|bare-metal stent]]s. The SoS trial demonstrated CABG is superior to PCI in multivessel coronary disease.<ref name="SoS 2002"/>

The SYNTAX trial was a randomized controlled trial of 1800 patients with multivessel coronary disease, comparing CABG versus PCI using drug-eluting stents (DES). The study found that rates of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at 12 months were significantly higher in the DES group (17.8% versus 12.4% for CABG; P=0.002).<ref name="SYNTAX"/> This was primarily driven by higher need for repeat [[revascularization]] procedures in the PCI group with no difference in repeat infarctions or survival. Higher rates of strokes were seen in the CABG group.

The FREEDOM (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus—Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) trial will compare CABG and DES in patients with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. The registries of the nonrandomized patients screened for these trials may provide as much robust data regarding revascularization outcomes as the randomized analysis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Desai ND |title=Pitfalls assessing the role of drug-eluting stents in multivessel coronary disease |journal=Ann Thorac Surg |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=25–7 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18154771 |doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.08.063}}</ref>

* Disease of the [[left main coronary artery]] (LMCA).
* Disease of all three coronary vessels ([[left anterior descending|LAD]], [[circumflex artery|LCX]] and [[right coronary artery|RCA]]).
* Diffuse disease not amenable to treatment with a PCI.

The 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines further state:
CABG is the preferred treatment with other high-risk patients such as those with severe ventricular dysfunction (i.e. low [[ejection fraction]]), or [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name="2004 ACC CABG" />

==Prognosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Prognosis following CABG depends on a variety of factors, and successful grafts typically last 8–15 years. In general, CABG improves the chances of survival of patients who are at high risk (generally triple or higher bypass), though statistically after about five years the difference in survival rate between those who have had surgery and those treated by drug therapy diminishes. Age at the time of CABG is critical to the prognosis, younger patients with no complicating diseases doing better, while older patients can usually be expected to suffer further blockage of the coronary arteries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Controversy==

The value of coronary artery bypass surgery in rescuing someone having a heart attack (by immediately alleviating an obstruction) is clearly defined in multiple studies, but studies have failed to find benefit for bypass surgery vs. medical therapy in stable angina patients.  The artery bypass can temporarily alleviate chest pain, but does not increase longevity.  The "vast majority of heart attacks do not originate with obstructions that narrow arteries".<ref name="nytimes.com">Kolata, Gina.

Several factors may contribute to immediate cognitive decline.  The heart-lung blood circulation system and the surgery itself release a variety of debris, including bits of blood cells, tubing, and plaques.  For example, when surgeons clamp and connect the aorta to tubing, resulting emboli block blood flow and cause mini strokes.  Other heart surgery factors related to mental damage may be events of hypoxia, high or low body temperature, abnormal blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and fever after surgery.<ref>Stutz, Bruce [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pumphead-heart-lung-machine "Pumphead: Does the heart-lung machine have a dark side?"] ''Scientific American'', January 9, 2009.</ref>

A safer and more permanent and successful way to prevent heart attacks in patients at high risk is to  exercise, give up smoking, take "drugs to get blood pressure under control and drive cholesterol levels down to prevent blood clotting".<ref name="nytimes.com"/>  Longer term, behavioral and medication treatment may be the only way to avoid vascular related loss of mental function.<ref>Harmon, Katherine [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=disease-may-cause-pumphead "Heart-Lung Machine May Not Be the Culprit in Post-Op "Pump Head" Syndrome" ''Scientific American'' August 6, 2009.]</ref>

==Procedure (simplified)==
[[Image:Coronary artery bypass surgery Image 657B-PH.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Coronary artery bypass surgery''' during mobilization (freeing) of the [[right coronary artery]] from its surrounding tissue, [[adipose tissue]] (yellow). The tube visible at the bottom is the aortic cannula (returns blood from the [[Heart-lung machine|HLM]]). The tube above it (obscured by the [[cardiac surgeon|surgeon]] on the right) is the venous cannula (receives blood from the body). The patient's [[heart]] is stopped and the [[aorta]] is cross-clamped. The patient's head (not seen) is at the bottom.]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
#The patient is brought to the [[operating room]] and moved on to the operating table.
#An [[anaesthetist]] places a variety of [[intravenous]] lines and injects a painkilling agent (usually [[fentanyl]]) followed within minutes by an induction agent (usually [[propofol]]) to render the patient unconscious.
#An [[endotracheal tube]] is inserted and secured by the anaesthetist and [[mechanical ventilation]] is started. General anaesthesia is maintained by a continuous very slow injection of [[Propofol]].
#The chest is opened via a [[median sternotomy]] and the heart is examined by the surgeon.
#The bypass grafts are harvested – frequent conduits are the [[internal thoracic artery|internal thoracic arteries]], [[radial artery|radial arteries]] and [[saphenous vein]]s. When harvesting is done, the patient is given [[heparin]] to prevent the blood from clotting.
#In the case of "[[Off-pump coronary artery bypass|off-pump]]" surgery, the surgeon places devices to stabilize the heart.
#If the case is "on-pump", the surgeon sutures [[Cardiopulmonary bypass#Cannulae|cannulae]] into the heart and instructs the [[perfusionist]] to start [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] (CPB). Once CPB is established, the surgeon places the [[aortic cross-clamp]] across the aorta and instructs the perfusionist to deliver [[cardioplegia]] (a special potassium-mixture, cooled) to stop the heart and slow its metabolism. Usually the patient's machine-circulated blood is cooled to around {{convert|84|F}}
#One end of each graft is sewn on to the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] beyond the [[coronary artery disease|blockages]] and the other end is attached to the [[aorta]].
#The heart is restarted; or in "off-pump" surgery, the stabilizing devices are removed. In cases where the aorta is partially occluded by a C-shaped clamp, the heart is restarted and suturing of the grafts to the aorta is done in this partially occluded section of the aorta while the heart is beating.
#[[Protamine]] is given to reverse the effects of [[heparin]].
#[[Chest tube]]s are placed in the mediastinal and pleural space to drain blood from around the heart and lungs.   
#The [[Human sternum|sternum]] is wired together and the incisions are [[surgical suture|suture]]d closed.
#The patient is moved to the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) to recover. 
#Nurses in the [[ICU]] focus on recovering the patient by monitoring blood pressure, urine output and respiratory status as the patient is monitored for bleeding through the [[chest tube]]s.  If there is chest tube clogging, complications such as [[cardiac tamponade]], [[pneumothorax]] or death can ensue.  Thus nurses closely monitor the chest tubes and under take methods to prevent clogging so bleeding can be monitored and complications can be prevented.
#After awakening and stabilizing in the ICU (approximately one day), the person is transferred to the cardiac surgery [[wikt:ward|ward]] until ready to go home (approximately four days).

==Minimally invasive CABG==

Alternate methods of [[Minimally invasive cardiac surgery|minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery]] have been developed.  [[Off-pump coronary artery bypass]] (OPCAB) is a technique of performing bypass surgery without the use of [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] (the heart-lung machine).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/disorders/cad/offpump.aspx|title=Off Pump Bypass Surgery: Improving outcomes for coronary artery bypass surgery|last=Sabik|first=Joseph|date=2010|work=Clevelandclinic.com|accessdate=February 28,2011}}</ref>  Further refinements to OPCAB have resulted in [[minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery]] (MIDCAB), a technique of performing bypass surgery through a 5 to 10&nbsp;cm incision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/disorders/cad/mini_cabg.aspx|title=Minimally Invasive Bypass Surgery|last=Sabik|first=Joseph|date=2010|work=Clevelandclinic.com|accessdate=February 28,2011}}</ref>

==Conduits used for bypass==
[[File:Scars 2yrs.png|thumb|right|Heart bypass patient with almost invisible residual scarring]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
The choice of conduits is highly dependent upon the particular surgeon and institution. Typically, the left [[internal thoracic artery]] (LITA) (previously referred to as ''left internal mammary artery'' or ''LIMA'') is grafted to the [[left anterior descending]] artery and a combination of other arteries and veins is used for other coronary arteries. The right internal thoracic artery (RITA), the [[great saphenous vein]] from the leg and the [[radial artery]] from the forearm are frequently used; in the U.S., these vessels are usually harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as [[endoscopic vessel harvesting]] (EVH). The [[right gastroepiploic artery]] from the [[stomach]] is infrequently used given the difficult mobilization from the [[abdomen]].

===Graft patency===
Grafts can become diseased and may occlude in the months to years after bypass surgery is performed. Patency is the chance that a graft remains open. A graft is considered patent if there is flow through the graft without any significant (>70% diameter) stenosis in the graft.

Graft patency is dependent on a number of factors, including the type of graft used (internal thoracic artery, radial artery, or great saphenous vein), the size or the coronary artery that the graft is anastomosed with, and, of course, the skill of the surgeon(s) performing the procedure. Arterial grafts (e.g. LITA, radial) are far more sensitive to rough handling than the saphenous veins and may go into spasm if handled improperly.

Generally the best patency rates are achieved with the in-situ left internal thoracic artery (the proximal end is left connected to the [[subclavian artery]]) with the distal end being anastomosed with the coronary artery (typically the left anterior descending artery or a diagonal branch artery). Lesser patency rates can be expected with radial artery grafts and "free" internal thoracic artery grafts (where the proximal end of the thoracic artery is excised from its origin from the subclavian artery and re-anastomosed with the ascending aorta). Saphenous vein grafts have worse patency rates, but are more available, as the patients can have multiple segments of the saphenous vein used to bypass different arteries.

Veins that are used either have their [[valve]]s removed or are turned around so that the valves in them do not occlude blood flow in the graft. LITA grafts are longer-lasting than vein grafts, both because the artery is more robust than a vein and because, being already connected to the arterial tree, the LITA need only be grafted at one end. The LITA is usually grafted to the [[left anterior descending coronary artery]] (LAD) because of its superior long-term patency when compared to saphenous vein grafts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kitamura|first=S|author2=Kawachi K|author3=Kawata T|author4=Kobayashi S|author5=Mizuguchi K|author6=Kameda Y|author7=Nishioka H|author8=Hamada Y|author9=Yoshida Y|display-authors=3|month=March |year=1996|title=[Ten-year survival and cardiac event-free rates in Japanese patients with the left anterior descending artery revascularized with internal thoracic artery or saphenous vein graft: a comparative study]|journal=Nippon Geka Gakkai Zasshi|volume=97|issue=3|pages=202–9|pmid=8649330 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Arima|first=M|author2=Kanoh T|author3=Suzuki T|author4=Kuremoto K|author5=Tanimoto K|author6=Oigawa T|author7=Matsuda S|display-authors=3|month=August|year=2005|title=Serial angiographic follow-up beyond 10 years after coronary artery bypass grafting|journal=Circ J.|volume=69|issue=8|pages=896–902|pmid=16041156|url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/69/8/896/_pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1253/circj.69.896}}</ref>

==Sternal precautions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery will have to avoid certain things for eight to 12 weeks to reduce the risk of opening the incision. These are called sternal precautions. First, patients need to avoid using their arms excessively, such as pushing themselves out of a chair or reaching back before sitting down. To avoid this, patients are encouraged to build up momentum by rocking several times in their chair before standing up. Second, patients should avoid lifting anything in excess of 5–10 pounds. A gallon (U.S.) of milk weighs approximately 8.5 pounds, and is a good reference point for weight limitations. Finally, patients should avoid overhead activities with their hands, such as reaching for sweaters from the top shelf of a closet or reaching for plates or cups from the cupboard.

==Complications==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
People undergoing coronary artery bypass are at risk for the same complications as any surgery, plus some risks more common with or unique to CABG.

===CABG associated===
*[[Postperfusion syndrome]] (pumphead), a transient neurocognitive impairment associated with [[cardiopulmonary bypass]]. Some research shows the incidence is initially decreased by [[off-pump coronary artery bypass]], but with no difference beyond three months after surgery. A neurocognitive decline over time has been demonstrated in people with coronary artery disease regardless of treatment (OPCAB, conventional CABG or medical management). However, a 2009 research study suggests that longer term (over 5 years) cognitive decline is not caused by CABG but is rather a consequence of vascular disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=disease-may-cause-pumphead|title=Heart-Lung Machine May Not Be the Culprit in Post-Op "Pump Head" Syndrome|last=Harmon|first=Katherine|date=August 6, 2009|work=ScientificAmerican.com|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>

*[[Myocardial infarction]] due to embolism, [[hypoperfusion]], or graft failure.

* [[Vasoplegic syndrome]], secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia
* Grafts last 8 – 15 years, and then need to be replaced.
*[[Pneumothorax]]: An air collection around the lung that compresses the lung<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Silber |first1=JH |year=1995 |title=Evaluation of the Complication Rate as a Measure of Quality of Care in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery |journal=JAMA |volume=274 |issue=4 |pages=317–23 |pmid=7609261}}</ref>
*[[Hemothorax]]:  Blood in the space around the lungs
*[[Pericardial tamponade]]: Blood collection around the heart that compresses the heart and causes poor body and brain perfusion.  [[Chest tube]]s are placed around the heart and lung to prevent this.  If the [[chest tube]]s become clogged in the early post operative period when bleeding is ongoing this can lead to [[Pericardial tamponade]], [[pneumothorax]] or [[hemothorax]].
*[[Pleural effusion]]:  Fluid in the space around the lungs.  This can lead to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] which can slow recovery.

*Post-operative [[atrial fibrillation]]:  An [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] that sometimes occurs after cardiac surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leitch |first1=JW |year=1990 |title=The importance of age as a predictor of atrial fibrillation and flutter after coronary artery bypass grafting |journal=The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=338–42 |pmid=2391970}}</ref>

===General surgical===
*[[Infection]] at incision sites or [[sepsis]].
*[[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT)
*[[Anesthesia|Anesthetic]] complications such as [[malignant hyperthermia]].
*[[Keloid]] scarring
*[[Chronic pain]] at incision sites
*[[Chronic stress]] related illnesses
*[[Death]]

==Follow up==
Patients who have a coronary artery bypass surgery need regular monitoring from a physician. Among the changes in monitoring are five years after the surgery the addition of a regular [[cardiac stress test]] even when there is no change in the patient's status.<ref name="ACCIfive">{{Citation |author1 =  American College of Cardiology |author1-link = American College of Cardiology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American College of Cardiology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Cardio.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="2011echocardio">{{cite PMID|21349406}}</ref>
