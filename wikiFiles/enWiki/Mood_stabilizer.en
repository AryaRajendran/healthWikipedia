A '''mood stabilizer''' is a [[psychiatric medication]] used to treat [[mood disorder]]s characterized by intense and sustained mood shifts, typically [[bipolar disorder]].

==Uses==
Used to treat [[bipolar disorder]],<ref name="urlTexas State - Student Health Center">{{cite web |url=http://www.healthcenter.txstate.edu/healthed/general_health/ment_bipolar.htm |title=Texas State - Student Health Center}}</ref> mood stabilizers suppress swings between [[mania]] and [[clinical depression|depression]]. Mood-stabilizing drugs are also used in [[borderline personality disorder]]<ref name="urlNIMH · Borderline Personality Disorder">{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/borderline-personality-disorder-fact-sheet/index.shtml |title=NIMH and Borderline Personality Disorder}}</ref> and [[Schizoaffective disorder]].

==Examples==
The term "mood stabilizer" does not describe a mechanism, but rather an effect. More precise terminology is used to classify these agents.

Drugs commonly classed as mood stabilizers include:

===Mineral===
* [[Lithium pharmacology|Lithium]] – Lithium is the "classic" mood stabilizer, the first to be approved by the US FDA, and still popular in treatment. [[Therapeutic drug monitoring]] is required to ensure lithium levels remain in the therapeutic range: 0.6 or 0.8-1.2 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|mEq]]/L (or millimolar). Signs and symptoms of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and [[ataxia]].<ref name=pmid_18789369>{{Cite pmid|18789369}}</ref> The most common side effects are lethargy and weight gain. The less common side-effects of using lithium are blurred vision, slight tremble in the hands, and a feeling of being mildly ill. In general, these side-effects occur in the first few weeks after commencing lithium treatment. These symptoms can often be improved by lowering the dose.<ref>Kozier, B et al. (2008). Fundamentals Of Nursing, Concepts, Process, and Practice. London: Pearson Education. p. 189.</ref>

===Anticonvulsants===
Many agents described as "mood stabilizers" are also categorized as [[anticonvulsants]]. The term "anticonvulsant mood stabilizers" is sometimes used to describe these as a class.<ref name=pmid15936730>{{cite journal |author=Ichikawa J, Dai J, Meltzer HY |title=Lithium differs from anticonvulsant mood stabilizers in prefrontal cortical and accumbal dopamine release: role of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonism |journal=Brain Res. |volume=1049 |issue=2 |pages=182–90 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15936730 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2005.05.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-8993(05)00716-X}}</ref> Although this group is also defined by effect rather than mechanism, there is at least a preliminary understanding of the mechanism of most of the anticonvulsants used in the treatment of mood disorders.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

* [[Valproic acid]] ([[Abbott Laboratories|Depakine]]), [[Valproate semisodium|divalproex sodium]] (Depakote), and [[sodium valproate]] (Depacon, Epilim) – Available in extended release form. This drug can be very irritating to the stomach, especially when taken as valproic acid. [[Liver function tests|Liver function]] and [[Full blood count|CBC]] should be monitored.{{cn|date=March 2013}}
* [[Lamotrigine]] ([[GlaxoSmithKline|Lamictal]]) – Particularly effective for bipolar depression. Usual dose is 100–200&nbsp;mg daily, which can be built up by 25&nbsp;mg every 2 weeks.<ref>Healy D. 2005 Psychiatric Drugs explained 4th ed. Churchill Liviingstone: London p.110</ref> The patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], a very rare but potentially fatal skin condition. {{cn|date=March 2013}}
* [[Carbamazepine]] ([[novartis|Tegretol]]) – [[Full blood count|CBC]] should be monitored, as carbamazepine can lower [[white blood cell]] count. Therapeutic drug monitoring is required. Carbamazepine was approved by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] as a bipolar disorder treatment in 2005, but had been widely used previously.{{cn|date=March 2013}}
* [[Oxcarbazepine]] ([[novartis|Trileptal]]) – Oxcarbazepine is not FDA approved for bipolar disorder. Still, it appears to be effective in about one-half of patients with bipolar disorder and be well tolerated.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n0813 |author=Ghaemi SN, Berv DA, Klugman J, Rosenquist KJ, Hsu DJ |title=Oxcarbazepine treatment of bipolar disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=8 |pages=943–5 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12927010}}</ref>
*[[Topiramate]] ([[Topamax]]) is not FDA approved for bipolar disorder, either; and a 2006 [[Cochrane review]] concluded that there is insufficient evidence on which to base any recommendations regarding the use of topiramate in any phase of bipolar illness.<ref>Vasudev K, Macritchie K, Geddes J, Watson S, Young AH. Topiramate for acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder. ''Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' 2006, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD003384. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD003384.pub2}}.</ref>
*[[Riluzole]] ([[Rilutek]]) is not FDA approved as a treatment for bipolar disorder. This drug is often used for Lou Gehrig’s disease,but also is a potential candidate for bipolar disorder therapy. Riluzole has been shown to have antidepressant properties in a number of recent studies of mood and anxiety disorders. Riluzole was tested for bipolar depression by Dr. Husseini Manji and colleagues. They gave the drug to 14 acutely depressed bipolar patients alongside lithium for eight weeks. A significant improvement was found, with no evidence of a switch into mania. "These results suggest that riluzole might indeed have antidepressant efficacy in subjects with bipolar depression," say the team.<ref>By JANE COLLINGWOOD.Emerging Bipolar Therapies.''http://psychcentral.com/lib/2007/emerging-bipolar-therapies/.</ref> Safety monitoring includes regular liver function tests and people with liver disease such as hepatitis should be monitored especially carefully.
*[[Gabapentin]] ([[pfizer|Neurontin]]) is not FDA approved as a treatment for bipolar disorder. Randomized controlled trials suggest that Gabapentin is not an effective treatment, but many psychiatrists continue to prescribe it, it is reported because of positive but "low-quality" literature reviews.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19410108}}</ref>

===Antipsychotics===
* Some [[atypical antipsychotic]]s ([[risperidone]], [[olanzapine]], [[quetiapine]], [[paliperidone]], and [[ziprasidone]]) also have mood stabilizing effects<ref name=pmid15762830>{{cite journal |author=Bowden CL |title=Atypical antipsychotic augmentation of mood stabilizer therapy in bipolar disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=Suppl 3 |issue=  |series=66|pages=12–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15762830 |url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10001256}}</ref> and are thus commonly prescribed even when [[psychotic]] symptoms are absent.<ref name=pmid15762830/>

===Other===
* It is also conjectured that [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s may have a mood stabilizing effect.<ref name=pmid11152679>{{cite journal |author=Mirnikjoo B, Brown SE, Kim HF, Marangell LB, Sweatt JD, Weeber EJ |title=Protein kinase inhibition by omega-3 fatty acids |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=276 |issue=14 |pages=10888–96 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11152679 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M008150200 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11152679}}</ref> Compared with placebo, omega-3 fatty acids appear better able to augment known mood stabilizers in reducing depressive (but perhaps not manic) symptoms of bipolar disorder; additional trials would be needed to establish the effects of omega-3 fatty acids alone.<ref>{{Cite pmid|16225556}}</ref>

Sometimes mood stabilizers are used in combination, such as lithium with one of the [[anticonvulsants]].

==Relationship to antidepressants==
Most mood stabilizers are purely '''antimanic''' agents, meaning that they are effective at treating [[mania]] and mood cycling and shifting, but are not effective at treating [[clinical depression|depression]]. The principal exceptions to that rule, because they treat both manic and depressive symptoms, are [[lamotrigine]] and [[lithium carbonate]]. While an antimanic agent such as [[valproic acid]] or [[carbamazepine]] cannot treat depression directly as the former two drugs can, it is widely thought to help ward off depression in [[bipolar disorder|bipolar patients]] by keeping them out of mania and, thus, preventing their moods from cycling.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

Nevertheless, an [[antidepressant]] is often prescribed in addition to the mood stabilizer during depressive phases. This brings some risks, however, as antidepressants can induce [[mania]], [[psychosis]], and other disturbing problems in people with [[bipolar disorder]] — in particular, when taken alone, but sometimes even when used with a mood stabilizer. Antidepressants' utility in treating depression-phase bipolar disorder is unclear.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

Antidepressants cause several risks when given to bipolar patients. They are ineffective in treating acute bipolar depression, preventing relapse, and can cause rapid cycling. Studies have been shown that antidepressants have no benefit versus a placebo or other treatment. Antidepressants can also lead to a higher rate of non-lethal suicidal behavior. Relapse can also be related to treatment with antidepressants. This is less likely to occur if a mood stabilizer is combined with an antidepressant, rather than an antidepressant being used alone.  Evidence from previous studies shows that rapid cycling is linked to use of antidepressants. Rapid cycling is when a person with bipolar disorder experiences four or more mood episodes, such as mania or depression, within a year. These issues have become more prevalent since antidepressant medication has come into widespread use.  There is a need for caution when treating bipolar patients with antidepressant medication due to the risks that they pose. {{cn|date=March 2013}}

Use of mood stabilizers and anticonvulsants such as lamotrigine, carbamazapine, valproate and others may lead to chronic folate deficiency, potentiating depression.{{cn|date=April 2013}} Also, "Folate deficiency may increase the risk of depression and reduce the action of antidepressants."<ref>Stephen M. Stahl, MD, PhD. Novel Therapeutics for Depression: L-methylfolate as a Trimonoamine Modulator and Antidepressant-Augmenting Agent. http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1267.</ref> L-methylfolate (also formally known as 5-MTHF or [[Levofolinic acid]]), a centrally acting trimonoamine modulator, boosts the synthesis of three CNS neurotransmitters: dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. Mood stabilizers and anticonvulsants may '''interfere''' with [[folic acid]] absorption and L-methylfolate formation. Augmentation with the medical food L-methylfolate may improve antidepressant effects of these medicines, including lithium and antidepressants themselves, by boosting the synthesis of antidepressant neurotransmitters.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

==Mechanism==
Many mood stabilizers are also [[anticonvulsant]]s. A notable exception is [[lithium salt|lithium]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

One possible downstream target of several mood stabilizers such as lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine is the [[Arachidonic acid#Synthesis and cascade|arachidonic acid cascade]].<ref name=pmid18347600>{{cite journal |author=Rao JS, Lee HJ, Rapoport SI, Bazinet RP |title=Mode of action of mood stabilizers: is the arachidonic acid cascade a common target? |journal=[[Mol. Psychiatry]] |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=585–96 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18347600 |doi=10.1038/mp.2008.31}}</ref>
