'''Androgenic alopecia''' (also known as '''androgenetic alopecia''', '''''alopecia androgenetica''''', '''male pattern baldness''') is hair loss that occurs due to an underlying susceptibility of hair follicles to androgenic miniaturization. It is the most common cause of [[baldness|hair loss]] and will affect up to 70% of men and 40% of women at some point in their lifetime. Men typically present with hairline recession at the temples and vertex balding while women normally diffusely thin over the top of their scalps.<ref name="Canada">{{cite pmid|22735503}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|10382384}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19034818}}</ref> Both genetic and environmental factors play a role, and many etiologies remain unknown. 

Classic androgenic hair loss in males begins above the [[Temple (anatomy)|temples]] and vertex, or [[calvaria (skull)|calvaria]], of the [[scalp]]. As it progresses, a rim of hair at the sides and rear of the head remains. This has been referred to as a 'Hippocratic wreath', and rarely progresses to complete baldness.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266655/Hippocratic-wreath|title = Hippocratic wreath (Baldness)|accessdate = Dec 15, 2012|date = Dec 15, 2012|publisher = [[Britannica]] Online}}</ref> The [[Hamilton-Norwood scale]] has been developed to grade androgenic alopecia in males.

Female androgenic alopecia has been colloquially referred to as 'female pattern baldness', although its characteristics can occur in males as well. It more often causes diffuse thinning without hairline recession, and like its male counterpart rarely leads to [[alopecia totalis|total hair loss]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001173.htm|title = Female pattern baldness|accessdate = Dec 15, 2012|date = Dec 15, 2012|publisher = MedlinePlus}}</ref> The [[Ludwig scale]] grades severity of androgenic alopecia in females.

Animal models of androgenic alopecia occur naturally and have been developed in [[Transgenesis|transgenic]] [[mouse|mice]],<ref>{{cite pmid|20233794}}</ref> [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] (''Pan troglodytes''), [[bald uakari]]s (''Cacajao rubicundus'') and [[stump-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca speciosa'' and ''Macaca arctoides''), of which the macaques demonstrate the greatest incidence and most prominent hair loss.<ref>{{cite pmid|11399538}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|10527763}}</ref>

==Hormonal etiology==
[[Image:WNTPathway.png|thumb|right|upright|Androgens can interact with the [[Wnt signalling pathway]] to cause to hair loss.]] Research indicates that the initial programming of pilosebaceous units begins ''in utero''.<ref>{{cite pmid|12792148}}</ref> The physiology is primarily [[androgen]]ic, with [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) the major contributor at the dermal papillae.

Transgenic studies have shown that growth and dormancy of hair follicles are related to the activity of IGF at the dermal papillae, which is affected by DHT.<ref name="pmid 16297183">{{cite pmid| 16297183}}</ref> Androgens are important in male sexual development around birth and at puberty. They regulate sebaceous glands, apocrine hair growth and libido. With increasing age,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/hair-loss-causes|title=Help for Hair Loss: Men's Hair Loss – Causes|publisher= Webmd.com |date = Mar 1, 2010}}</ref> androgens stimulate hair growth on the face, but suppress it at the temples and scalp vertex, a condition that has been referred to as the 'androgen paradox'.<ref name="paradox">{{cite pmid|23016593}}</ref>

P-cadherin mutants have short, sparse hair.<ref>{{cite pmid|22696062}}</ref> 

At the [[Occiput|occipital]] scalp, androgens enhance inducible [[nitric oxide synthase]] (iNOS), which catalyzes production of [[nitric oxide]] from [[L-arginine]].<ref name="paradox"/> The induction of nitric oxide synthase usually occurs in an [[Redox|oxidative environment]], where high levels of [[nitric oxide]] produced [[Reactive nitrogen species|interact with superoxide]], leading to [[peroxynitrite]] formation and cell toxicity. iNOS has been suggested to play a role in host immunity by participating in anti-microbial and anti-tumor activities as part of the [[redox|oxidative burst]]<ref name="macrophage">{{cite pmid|3242600}}</ref> of [[macrophage]]s.<ref name="pmid12379825">{{cite pmid|12379825}}</ref> The gene coding for nitric oxide synthase is on human chromosome 17.<ref name="PUB00007290">{{cite pmid|7510950}}</ref> 

[[File:Skin.png|thumb|left|[[Hair follicle]] and mesenchymal [[dermal papilla]], labelled at top.]] There is also crosstalk between androgens and the [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt-Beta-catenin]] signaling pathway that leads to hair loss. At the level of the somatic [[Adult stem cell|stem cell]], androgens promote differentiation of facial hair [[dermal papillae]], but inhibit it at the scalp.<ref name="paradox"/> Other research suggests the [[enzyme]] [[prostaglandin D2 synthase]] and its product [[prostaglandin D2]] (PGD2) in [[hair follicles]] as contributive.<ref name=Garza_et_al_2012>{{cite pmid|22440736}}</ref>

[[Prolactin]] has also been suggested to have different effects on the hair follicle across gender.<ref>{{cite pmid|19890346}}</ref> It seasonally modulates<ref>{{cite pmid|19110541}}</ref> and can delay<ref>{{cite pmid|17088411}}</ref> hair growth in animal models.

==Genetics==
[[File:Hair follicle-en.svg|thumb|right|upright|Individual pilosebaceous unit.]] Balding is multifactorial, with several lines of evidence suggesting that it most likely functions by a [[diathesis–stress model]].  Since [[androgen]]s and [[androgen receptor]]s (AR) are the initiating cause of androgenic alopecia, their genetic corollaries are a subject of much research. Some involved genes are [[X-linked]], with men whose fathers show hair loss 2.5 times more likely to experience it themselves regardless of maternal report.<ref>{{cite pmid | 15237265}}</ref> The maternal line is crucial as well, however, as it contains the androgen receptor gene, which provides the necessary diathesis for androgenic alopecia.<ref>{{cite pmid|15902657}}</ref> 

[[File:Diathesisstressdualriskmodel.JPG|thumb|left|Diathesis-stress model, the most likely mechanism of androgenic hair loss.]] The specific variant of the AR for baldness is on a recessive [[allele]], so a woman would need two [[X chromosomes]] with the defect to show male pattern hair loss.<ref>{{cite pmid|16172040}}</ref> The EDA2R gene on the X chromosome at Xq11-q12, close to the area which codes for the androgen receptor gene, has been suggested by some researchers as specific to androgenic alopecia.<ref>{{cite pmid|18385763}}</ref> An allele on chromosome 3 at 3q26 also contributes.<ref>{{cite pmid|18304493}}</ref>

Genetic causes of hair texture and non-androgenic hair loss have been discovered as well. One is [[P2RY5]], mutations of which affect hair structure and [[woolly hair]].<ref>{{pmid|18297072}}</ref> Variants at this site can lead to baldness.<ref>{{cite pmid|18692127}}</ref> Other research identified the gene [[SOX21]], [[Y chromosome|Y-linked]], as related to certain non-androgenic alopecias.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUKTRE54O4D020090525 |work=Reuters |title=Scientists identify gene that may explain hair loss|date=2009-05-25}}</ref>

==Age effect==
[[File:Egypte louvre 105.jpg|thumbnail|right|Two men practicing [[Tahtib]], one of them with androgenic alopecia, on an Ostraca from Ancient Egypt, [[Louvre]]]]

Androgens stimulate growth of facial hair, but can suppress scalp hair, a condition which has been called the 'androgen paradox'.<ref name="paradox"/> The [[American Academy of Dermatology]] reports that in adult men, the incidence of androgenic alopecia is roughly equivalent to chronological age, with half of men experiencing hair loss by age 50.<ref name="Percent">{{cite web|url =http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/9023/24253/352721.html?d=dmtContent|title = The Bald Truth About Hair Loss In Young Men|accessdate = Dec 16, 2012|date = Aug 8, 2002|publisher = Stephanie Whyche, InteliHealth News Service}}</ref>

A number of hormonal changes occur with aging:

# Decrease in testosterone
# Decrease in DHT and 5-alpha reductase
# Decrease 3AAG, a peripheral marker of DHT metabolism, 
# Increase in [[Sex hormone binding globulin|SHBG]].
# Decrease in androgen receptors in the scalp with age.<ref name="Histology and Hormonal Activity In Senescent Thinning in Males">{{cite journal|journal=European Hair Research Society - Abstract (conference)|title=Histology and hormonal activity in senescent thinning in males</font>|url=http://www.ehrs.org/conferenceabstracts/2001tokyo/researchabstracts/140-price.htm}}</ref>  

This decrease in androgens, androgen receptors and the increase in SHBG are opposite the increase in androgenic alopecia with aging. This is not intuitive, as testosterone and its peripheral metabolite, DHT, accelerate hair loss, and SHBG is thought to be protective. The ratio of T/SHBG, DHT/SHBG decreases by as much as 80% by age 80, in numeric parallel to hair loss, and approximates the pharmacology of anti-androgens such as [[finasteride]].<ref name="Percent"/>

Free testosterone decreases in men by age 80 to levels double that of a woman at age 20. 30% of normal male testosterone level, the approximate level in females, is not enough to induce alopecia; 60%, closer to the amount found in elderly men, is sufficient.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Hamilton | first = James B. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Male Hormone Stimulation Is Prerequisite and an Incident in Common Baldness| journal = American Journal of Anatomy| volume = | issue = | pages = 451–458 | publisher = | location = | date =Nov 1942 }}</ref> It has been theorized that the testicular secretion of testosterone "sets the stage" for androgenic alopecia as a multifactorial [[diathesis stress model]], related to hormonal predisposition, environment and age. Supplementing eunuchs with testosterone during their 2nd decade, for example, causes slow progression of androgenic alopecia over many years, while testosterone late in life causes rapid hair loss within a month.<ref name="Hamilton">{{Cite pmid|14819896}}</ref>

==Androgenic impact of exercise==
[[File:RIAN archive 555848 Testing on treadmill.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The impact of aerobic exercise on hair loss is different in acute and chronic settings.]] Exercise can impact androgenic hair loss by affecting androgen and estrogen levels. The ''Rancho Bernardo Study'', a large cross sectional examination of a community in southern California based on self-report, found that among both genders there was no significant difference in premature graying or balding status related to alcohol, smoking, exercise, appropriate use of calcium supplements, diuretics, or thyroid medication. In women with androgenic alopecia, there was an increased association with corticosteroid and estrogen use. Self reports typically have less strength in the context of evidence based medicine and hormonal indices were not measured in this study.<ref name="bernardo">{{cite pmid|17413136}}</ref>  A similar lack of relation between exercise and balding was found in the physicians health study.<ref>{{cite doi | 10.1001/archinte.160.2.165}}</ref>

Quantification of androgen indices in response to exercise can be understood in four categories: short versus long term, and anaerobic versus aerobic. These are indirect assays of exercise impact on hair loss, although the ability of [[exogenous]] androgen to worsen or precipitate miniaturization in the genetically predisposed is well documented.<ref>{{pmid|10710012}}</ref> Investigations have been either self-report, or cross-sectional and cohort studies with exercise and serum hormonal indices, but no phase III [[clinical trial]]s. In some studies, conflicting results are thought related to differences in exercise mode, volume, or physical condition of subjects.<ref>{{cite pmid|14514704}}</ref> 

In cross-sectional analyses, aerobic exercisers have lower basal total and free testosterone compared to the sedentary.<ref name="arce">{{cite pmid|8425638}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|3343919}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|6429357}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|9625362}}</ref> Anaerobic exercisers also have lower testosterone compared to the sedentary<ref name="arce"/> with slight increase in basal testosterone in resistance training over time.<ref name="2 year"/> There is some correlation between testosterone and physical activity in the middle aged and elderly.<ref name="nordic">{{Cite pmid|14641001}}</ref> Acutely, testosterone briefly increases when comparing aerobic, anaerobic and mixed forms of exercise.<ref name="Kramer">{{Cite pmid|9535580}}</ref> A study assessed men who were resistance trained, endurance trained, or sedentary in which they either rested, ran or did a resistance session. Androgens increased in response to exercise, particularly resistance, while cortisol only increased with resistance. DHEA increased with resistance exercise and remained elevated during recovery in resistance-trained subjects. After initial post-exercise increase, there was decline in free and total testosterone during resistance recovery, particularly in resistance-trained subjects. Endurance-trained subjects showed less change in hormone levels in response to exercise than resistance-trained subjects.<ref name="combined">{{Cite pmid|14514704}}</ref> Another study have found relative short term effects of aerobic, anaerobic and combined anaerobic-aerobic exercise protocols on hormone levels to not be different. It showed increases in testosterone and cortisol immediately after exercise that returned to baseline in 2 hours.<ref name="arbcvsanrbc">{{Cite pmid|7474044}}</ref>

===Aerobic===

In trained long term aerobic exercisers, basal levels are unchanged,<ref name="longtermaerobic">{{Cite pmid|4044106}}</ref> or decreased.<ref name="arbcvsanrbc"/><ref name="longtermaerobic2">{{Cite pmid|9763799}}</ref> Acutely, endurance based aerobic efforts cause testosterone to rise.<ref name="jensen">{{Cite pmid|1765061}}</ref>  

A year long, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program increased DHT and SHBG in sedentary men age 40-75, but had no effect on other androgens. Both DHT and SHBG increased 14% in exercisers at 3 months, and at 12 months they remained 9% above baseline. SHBG is protective against DHT as it binds free androgen.<ref name="Hawkins">{{Cite pmid|18202581}}</ref> In acute assessment of hormone levels in soccer players before, during and after a game, DHT and testosterone increased during the match, but returned to baseline after 45 minutes rest.<ref>{{Cite pmid|4085477}}</ref> Aerobic exercise in Japanese rats done on a rodent treadmill doubled local concentrations of DHT in calf muscles as assessed by protein assay.<ref name="fatrats">{{Cite pmid|22647230}}</ref> After intense aerobic effort, high endurance athletes were also found to have lower free testosterone the next day.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15618989}}</ref> In prolonged endurance exercise, such as a marathon, levels ultimately decrease.<ref>{{cite pmid|1956271}}</ref> Similarly, DHT drops, while adrenal androgen and cortisol will increase with the stress response.<ref>{{Cite pmid|518032}}</ref>

===Anaerobic===

[[File:TwoDumbbells.JPG|thumb|left|Effects of anaerobic exercise also vary with length of time.]]
It is unknown if anaerobic training changes individual hormone profiles, or if conditioned athletes in studies self-selected because of physiologic predisposition to physical conditioning.<ref>{{cite pmid|3529282}}</ref> There is variation of response to anaerobic stress depending on exercise intensity, age, gender, length of time studied, and time at which serum indices were drawn. Most studies report that testosterone increases or is unchanged acutely, though some even report it to decrease. Anaerobic exercisers have testosterone levels below sedentary controls in cross sectional analysis. Over months to years, levels vary with intensity of training cycle in specific protocols, although follow up at two years has found baseline levels slightly increased.

The ratio of testosterone to cortisol can both increase<ref name="Scand2"/> and decrease<ref name="Scand1"/> during resistance training, depending on intensity of exercise. A study comparing young and old subjects showed acute ''increases'' in GH and testosterone for both, although the latter increased less in older men.<ref name="Hakk">{{cite pmid|9562359}}</ref> Testosterone rises in late hours of sleep after anaerobic exercise.<ref>{{cite pmid|8789582}}</ref> Androgen receptor expression increases with acute exercise in correlation to free testosterone.<ref name="Willow">{{Cite pmid|15354030}}</ref> When comparing men and women in the 30, 50 and 70 year age groups, young and middle aged men showed increased testosterone after exercise, with the latter also having increased cortisol. Elderly men showed no change.<ref name="Hakk age">{{cite pmid |8776203}}</ref> Other studies have also shown with age there is a downtrend of testosterone<ref>{{cite pmid|17194250}}</ref> and attenuated growth hormone response.<ref name="smilios">{{Cite pmid|17024619}}</ref>  Young men have shown ''no acute change'' in testosterone with resistance training, with increase in cortisol and growth hormone depending on intensity.<ref>{{cite pmid|12673149}}</ref> One study in young men showed testosterone acutely stable, with increase in GH and IGF-1.<ref>{{cite pmid|11984299}}</ref> Similarly, a study showed testosterone did not increase in young men, women, and pubescent boys unaccustomed to weight training when corrected for plasma volume.<ref>{{cite pmid|1470017}}</ref> Extreme intensity of strength training may trigger the stress response, resulting in lower testosterone levels,<ref name="Raas">{{cite pmid|11394254}}</ref> an effect accentuated by energy deprivation.<ref name="Berg">{{cite pmid|9626127}}</ref>  A separate study comparing different ages, however, found no difference in acute testosterone and cortisol levels between groups, but attenuated [[growth hormone]] response in the elderly.<ref name="smilios"/> Acutely, other studies have shown testosterone to increase.<ref>{{cite pmid|2262468}}</ref> In a small group of anaerobically trained athletes, stressful training acutely even ''decreased'' serum testosterone and its ratio to [[cortisol]] and [[Sex hormone binding globulin|SHBG]], with an increase in [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]. With subsequent decompensation, testosterone was stable, but cortisol and SHBG decreased.<ref name="Scand1">{{Cite pmid|3108174}}</ref> Another case control showed with intense training followed by rest, testosterone dropped and LH increased initially.<ref name="Scand4">{{cite pmid|1592066}}</ref>

Interval and quality of exercise also affect hormonal response. Sessions of moderate to high intensity with multiple sets and short time intervals, during which energy is derived from glycolytic lactate metabolism, appear to be the greatest stimulus for steroid hormone response. Hormonal response in young men varies with the number of sets in the exercise session. However, when the number increased from 4 to 6, anabolic levels stabilized and cortisol continued to rise, suggesting that alterations in anaerobic volume could alter anabolic and catabolic hormonal balance.<ref name="Smil2">{{Cite pmid|12673149}}</ref> When sets are performed at maximum repetitions, interval has no influence at a certain intensity range, with no acute hormone response difference between protocols at 10 maximum reps with 2- and 5-minute intervals.<ref>{{cite pmid|16095405}}</ref>  There is a higher total testosterone response in hypertrophy protocols compared to those for strength and power, despite equalization of total work load (defined as load x sets x repetitions).<ref>{{cite pmid|19066934}}</ref> There is a 27% greater testosterone response using protocols with simultaneous use of all four limbs. Androgenic response was also noted in protocols using upper and lower limbs separately to a lesser degree.<ref name="Hakk98">{{Cite pmid|9562359}}</ref>

A number of studies have looked at effects of anaerobic exercise over months to years, showing it to be constant or slightly increased. A small case-control of anaerobic training in young untrained males over six weeks found decline in free testosterone of 17 percent.<ref>{{cite pmid|17181880}}</ref> With men in their 60s, resistive training over 16 weeks did not affect baseline anabolic hormone levels, although GH increased acutely with exercise.<ref>{{cite pmid|8550252}}</ref> A study over 21 weeks in male strength athletes showed basal hormone levels to be constant, despite strength increase.<ref name="Aht">{{cite pmid|12734759}}</ref> A follow up study looked at a larger group of weight trainers over 24 weeks, with 12 week decompensation. Training caused no change in total testosterone, but there were decreases in free testosterone, [[progesterone]], [[androstendione]], [[DHEA]], cortisol, [[transcortin]], and in the [[Cortisol binding globulin|cortisol:CBG]] ratio, suggesting androgen turnover increased with training intensity, without change in total testosterone.<ref name="Scand2">{{Cite pmid|3410630}}</ref> A study looking at young men and resistance training over 48 weeks found increases in baseline serum testosterone from 20 ± 5 to 25 ± 5 nmol/l, and an increase in testosterone:SHBG ratio, LH and FSH.<ref name="2 year">{{cite pmid|3215840}}</ref>

===Combined training===

One study showed [[Growth hormone|GH]] increase with anaerobic effort to be blunted in those who performed aerobic training for 60 minutes prior to strength training. Testosterone levels remained high only at the end of the training session with aerobic training followed by strength training, a phenomenon not seen with weight training done before aerobics.<ref>{{cite pmid|15714290}}</ref> In an 11 week soccer training program focusing on combined vertical jumps, short sprints, and submaximal endurance running, total testosterone increased, but SHBG rose in parallel, maintaining a constant free androgen index.<ref name="Soccer">{{cite pmid|14704801}}</ref>

==Female androgenic alopecia==
Female androgenic alopecia, clinically known as 'female pattern hair loss,' (FPHL) more often causes diffuse thinning without hairline recession. Approximately 30% of caucasian adult females experience hair loss.<ref name="pmid 22171680">{{Cite pmid|22171680}}</ref> Like its male counterpart, the condition rarely leads to total hair loss, although it is possible.<ref name="pmid 22171680"/> Treatment options to arrest progression and stimulate regrowth include finasteride, the androgen-independent growth promoter minoxidil, or androgen receptor antagonists [[spironolactone]] and [[cyproterone acetate]]. These work best initiated early, and hair transplantation can be considered in more advanced cases.<ref name="pmid 22171680"/>

A recently published study comparing [[monozygotic]] female [[twin]]s found a number of factors associated with hair loss in women with varying degrees of statistical certainty, and stratified by pattern. Factors associated with increased ''temporal'' hair loss that were [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] (p < 0.05) were as follows:

* more children (p = 0.005)
* longer sleep duration (p = 0.006)
* [[diabetes mellitus]] (p = 0.008)
* lack of exercise (p = 0.012)
* hypertension (p = 0.027)
* divorce or separation (p = 0.034)
* multiple marriages (p = 0.040)

''Frontal'' hair loss, like temporal, included hypertension (p = 0.001) and longer sleep duration (p = 0.011) as risk factors, but also included [[polycystic ovarian syndrome|PCOS]]  (p = 0.002), lack of hat use (p = 0.017), smoking (p = 0.021), high income (p = 0.023), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.023), stress (p = 0.034), and multiple marriages (p = 0.043). 

Statistically significant causes of ''vertex'' hair loss were: lack of sun protection (p = 0.020), less caffeine (p = 0.040), and a history of skin disease (p = 0.048). Higher testosterone levels were associated with increased temporal and vertex hair loss patterns (p < 0.039). Stress, smoking, more children, and a history of hypertension or cancer were associated with increased hair thinning (p < 0.05). It is unknown to what degree factors contributing to female hair loss overlap with those in men.<ref name="femaletwin">{{cite pmid|22878477}}</ref> Later studies have found that prolactin is unrelated to female androgenic pattern hair loss, despite earlier ''in vitro'' studies suggesting that it inhibited growth.<ref>{{cite pmid|22870355}}</ref> Female patients with mineralocorticoid resistance present with androgenic alopecia.<ref name="pmid 17161335">{{cite pmid|17161335}}</ref> Older studies have found a slight relationship of prolactin with female androgenic hair loss.<ref>{{cite pmid|8003325}}</ref>

==Male homologue to PCOS==
[[File:Male pattern baldness.jpg|thumb|left|A number of studies have found a link between androgenic alopecia and metabolic syndrome, suggesting the combination as a male homologue to [[polycystic ovarian syndrome|PCOS]].]]

Multiple cross sectional studies have found association between early androgenic alopecia, [[insulin]] resistance and [[metabolic syndrome]],<ref>{{cite pmid|21221497}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19094069}}</ref> with low [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] being the component of metabolic syndrome with highest association.<ref>{{cite pmid|20426781}}</ref> Linolenic and linoleic acids, two major dietary sources of HDL, are [[5 alpha reductase inhibitor]]s.<ref name="fatty acids">{{cite pmid|1637346}}</ref> It has been suggested that premature androgenic alopecia and insulin resistance are a clinical constellation that represents the male homologue, or [[phenotype]], of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].<ref>{{cite pmid|11117676}}</ref>  Others have found a higher rate of hyperinsulinemia in family members of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.<ref>{{cite pmid|8941059}}</ref> 

In support of the association, finasteride improves glucose metabolism and decreases glycosylated hemoglobin [[HbA1c]], a surrogate marker for diabetes mellitus.<ref>{{cite pmid|20151762}}</ref> The low SHBG seen with premature androgenic alopecia is also associated with, and likely contributory to, insulin resistance,<ref>{{cite pmid|1958579}}</ref> and for which it still is used as an assay for pediatric diabetes mellitus.<ref>{{cite pmid|10870035}}</ref> 

Obesity leads to upregulation of insulin production and decrease in SHBG. Further reinforcing the relationship, SHBG is downregulated by [[insulin]] ''in vitro'', although SHBG levels do not appear to affect insulin production.<ref>{{cite pmid|7962291}}</ref> ''In vivo'', insulin stimulates both testosterone production and SHBG inhibition in normal and obese men.<ref>{{cite pmid|7852532}}</ref> The relationship between SHBG and insulin resistance has been known for some time; decades prior, ratios of SHBG and [[adiponectin]] were used before glucose to predict insulin resistance.<ref>{{cite pmid|12915646}}</ref> Patients with [[Laron syndrome]], with resultant deficient IGF, demonstrate varying degrees of alopecia and structural defects in hair follicles when examined microscopically.<ref name="pmid15178913"/>

Because of its association with metabolic syndrome and altered glucose metabolism, both men and women with early androgenic hair loss should be screened for impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus II.<ref>{{cite pmid|16552990}}</ref> A low fat and high fiber diet combined with regular aerobic exercise increases SHBG and insulin sensitivity.<ref>{{cite pmid|11525592}}</ref> Regarding androgenic impact of diet with exercise, a study found increased protein intake led to higher concentrations of free and total testosterone immediately post exercise.<ref>{{cite pmid|17497592}}</ref>

Measurement of subcutaneous and visceral adipose stores by [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], demonstrated inverse association between [[viscera]]l [[adipose]] and testosterone/DHT, while subcutaneous adipose correlated negatively with SHBG and positively with estrogen. Subcutaneous fat did not correlate with androgens once the SHBG relationship was taken into account.<ref>{{cite pmid|17426100}}</ref> SHBG association with fasting blood glucose is most dependent on intrahepatic fat, which can be measured by MRI in and out of phase imaging sequences. Serum indices of hepatic function and surrogate markers for diabetes, previously used, show less correlation with SHBG by comparison.<ref>{{cite pmid|23121021}}</ref>

Female patients with mineralocorticoid resistance present with androgenic alopecia.<ref name="pmid 17161335"/>

IGF levels have been found lower in those with metabolic syndrome.<ref>{{cite pmid|19902049}}</ref> Circulating serum levels of insulin Growth Factor-1 ([[IGF-1]]) are increased with vertex balding, although this study did not look at mRNA expression at the follicle itself.<ref name="pmid10025745"/> Locally, IGF is mitogenic at the dermal papillae and promotes elongation of hair follicles. The major site of production of IGF is the liver, although local mRNA expression at hair follicles correlates with increase in hair growth. IGF release is stimulated by GH (growth hormone). Methods of increasing IGF include exercise, hypoglycemia, low fatty acids, deep sleep (stage IV [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]]), [[estrogen]]s, and consumption of [[amino acid]]s like [[arginine]] and [[leucine]]. Obesity and [[hyperglycemia]] inhibit its release. IGF also circulates in the blood bound to a large protein whose production is also dependent on GH. GH release is dependent on normal thyroid hormone. During the sixth decade of life, GH decreases in production. Because growth hormone is pulsatile and peaks during sleep, serum IGF is used as an index of overall growth hormone secretion. The surge of androgens at puberty drives an accompanying surge in growth hormone.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last = Rosenfeld|first= Ron G.|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The IGF System: Molecular Biology, Physiology, and Clinical Applications (Contemporary Endocrinology)|publisher=umana Press|date=Nov 9, 2010 |location=| pages=|isbn= 1-61737-138-6|doi=|id=}}</ref>

==Evolutionary biology==
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|300px|right|Certain studies have suggested androgenetic alopecia conveys survival advantage.]]
Some studies have suggested a [[survival of the fittest|survival advantage]] with androgenic alopecia.<ref name="X">{{cite news |title= Why bald men never went extinct: 4 theories |author= Staff|url= http://theweek.com/article/index/229694/why-bald-men-never-went-extinct-4-theories|newspaper= The Week|date= Jun 22, 2012|accessdate= Dec 16, 2012}}</ref> [[Psychologists]] have noted when showing subjects people with difference appearances, decrease in cranial hair was associated with social maturity, appeasement, older age, and decreased attractiveness and aggressiveness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Muscarella| first1=Frank| last2=Cunningham| first2=Mark |year= 1992 |title= The evolutionary significance and social perception of male pattern baldness and facial hair |journal= Ethology and Sociobiology |volume= 17 |issue= 2|pages= 99–117|publisher= Elsevier Inc.|doi= |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309595001301|accessdate=Dec 16, 2012}}</ref> 

A study from [[South Korea]] showed most people rated balding men less attractive. Men and women viewed six male models with different levels of facial and cranial hair, and participants rated each combination on 32 adjectives related to social perception. Males with facial hair and those with bald or receding hair were rated as being older than those who were clean shaven or had a full head of hair. Beards and full heads of hair were seen as more aggressive, while baldness was associated with social maturity.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last = Henss | first = Ronald | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Social perceptions of male pattern baldness | publisher = Amazon | date = April 6, 2011| location = | page = 28| url = http://www.amazon.com/Social-perceptions-pattern-baldness-ebook/dp/B004VMUHCE| doi = | id = }}</ref>

More theories include that baldness signaled dominance, social status, or longevity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=Robb|year=2012|title=Why haven't bald men gone extinct?|journal=New Scientist| volume=2869|pages=| issue=|publisher=NewScientist.com |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428692.100-why-havent-bald-men-gone-extinct.html?full=true| accessdate=Dec 16, 2012}}</ref> Biologists have hypothesized the larger sunlight exposed area would allow more vitamin D to be synthesized, which might have been a "finely tuned mechanism to prevent prostate cancer," as the malignancy itself is also associated with higher levels of DHT.<ref>{{cite pmid|20451486}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17910907}}</ref> Other hypotheses include genetic linkage to beneficial traits unrelated to hair loss and [[genetic drift]].

==Psychological effects==
Androgenic alopecia is typically experienced as a "moderately stressful condition that diminishes body image satisfaction".<ref>{{cite pmid|10583042}}</ref> However, although most men regard baldness as an unwanted and distressing experience, they usually are able to cope and retain integrity of personality.<ref>{{cite pmid|1607410}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of androgenic alopecia can be usually established based on clinical presentation in men. In women, the diagnosis usually requires more complex diagnostic evaluation. Further evaluation of the differential requires exclusion of other causes of hair loss, and assessing for the typical progressive hair loss pattern of androgenic alopecia.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hair-loss-diagnosis Diagnosing Men's Hair Loss: Norwood Scale Chart]. Webmd.com (2010-03-01). Retrieved on 2010-11-28.</ref> [[Trichoscopy]] can be used for further evaluation.<ref>{{cite pmid|18664157}}</ref>  Biopsy may be needed to exclude other causes of hair loss,<ref>{{cite pmid|19678603}}</ref> and [[histology]] would demonstrate perifollicular fibrosis.<ref>{{cite pmid|16755026}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|20059630}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Main|Management of androgenic alopecia}}

===Conventional medicine===
Early stages of hair loss can be slowed or reversed with medication, with [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved drugs being [[minoxidil]] and [[finasteride]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rxlist.com/propecia-drug.htm |title = Propecia (Finasteride) Drug Information: User Reviews, Side Effects, Drug Interactions and Dosage|accessdate = Nov 28, 2010|date = Mar 13, 2010|publisher = RxList}}</ref> Topical formulations of finasteride have similar efficacy to systemic, though prostate weight and serum PSA levels were not measured to exclude systemic absorption of topical application as the cause of hair growth.<ref>{{cite pmid|19172031}}</ref> Other systemic options include the longer acting [[dutasteride]] and [[spironolactone]], the latter of which has a high rate of feminizing side effects.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

More advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy, and require [[hair transplantation]].  Naturally-occurring units of one to four hairs, called [[hair follicle|follicular units]], are excised and moved to areas of [[hair restoration]]. These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either [[Follicular unit transplantation|Follicular Unit Transplantation]] (FUT) or [[Follicular Unit Extraction]] (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts. The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites.<ref>{{cite pmid|22808618}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|21792780}}</ref> Specialized scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short buzzed haircut.<ref name="abc">{{cite news |title= Considering a hair tattoo?

===Alternative and future therapies===
The field of research to prevent and treat androgenic hair loss is vast, with systemic and topical therapies with varying degrees of efficacy. In the United States alone, it is a multi-billion dollar industry. [[Low-level laser therapy]] (LLLT) claims to stimulate hair growth through "photo-biostimulation" of hair follicles, but has limited evidence of benefit or safety.<ref>{{cite pmid|20689478}}</ref> The [[dietary supplement]] [[Carnitine|<small>L</small>-carnitine]] induces hair growth ''in vitro'',<ref>{{cite pmid|17927577}}</ref> but it is not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].<ref name=CBS>{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Jim|title=Pharma's 4 Best Shots at a Cure for Baldness|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42847047/pharmas-4-best-shots-at-a-cure-for-baldness/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=CBSNews.com|date=12 January 2011|agency=CBS News}}</ref> Consumption of ''grateloupia elliptica'', a red seaweed in [[Jeju Province|Jeju Island]], [[South Korea]], has the potential to treat androgenic alopecia and alopecia areata.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kang|first1= II, J.|last2= Kim|first2=S.-C|year= 2012|title= Hair-loss preventing effect of Grateloupia elliptica|journal= Biomolecules & Therapeutics|volume= 20|issue=1|pages=118–124|url=http://stemcellbaldnesscures.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Grateloupia-elliptica-hair-loss.pdf|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1= Nguyen|first1= H|last2= Kim|first2=S.
