Dr. '''John Redman''' (February 22, 1722 – March 19, 1808) was the first president of [[The College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] and the medical preceptor of [[Benjamin Rush]].

Born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], after finishing his preparatory education in [[William Tennent]]'s [[Log College]], he began studying [[physics]] with [[John Kearsley]], then one of the most eminent [[physicians]] of [[Philadelphia]]. He began practicing in [[Bermuda]], and continued for several years. 

Redman then moved to [[Europe]] to further study [[medicine]]. He lived one year in [[Edinburgh]], attended lectures and dissections, and visited the [[hospitals]] in [[Paris]]. He matriculated 6 October 1747 at the University of [[Leyden]] <ref>Album Studiosorum Academiae Lugduno Batavae MDLXXV-MDCCCLXXV, kol. 1019.</ref> <ref>Index to English speaking students who have graduated at Leyden university / by Edward Peacock, F.S.A. - London : For the Index society, by Longmans, Green & co. 1883, p. 81, 1019.</ref>and graduated at the same University 15 July 1748.<ref>Bronnen tot de geschiedenis der Leidsche Universiteit, vijfde deel, 10 Febr. 1725-8 Febr. 1765 : Catalogus promotorum ex die 13.

Many of Philadelphia's leading doctors studied under him, including [[John Morgan (physician)|John Morgan]], [[Benjamin Rush]], and [[Caspar Wistar (physician)|Caspar Wistar]]. In 1784 he was elected an elder of the Second [[Presbyterian]] Church. 

He was a man of small stature, of good sense and learning, and much respected in his day. 

He became independently [[wealthy]], and retired from business many years before his death. He used to visit his old friends and acquaintances after he became infirm from age, on a fat [[pony]] mare. Dr. James Rush says, "I remember him well hitching her to the [[turnbuckle]] of the [[mansion]] [[Window shutter|shutter]], so that she always stood on the foot-[[sidewalk|pavement]], where he visited my father, which he made it a point to do once or twice a year. In the rough cutting of his likeness, which was given to me by a member of his family, the hat, wig, nose, mouth, chin, eye, dress, person, expression, and character are admirably true. The mare is not so well done. The [[Physician|doctor]] retired from practice about 1785, and was known to the public as an antiquated-looking old gentleman. He was usually habited in a broad-skirted dark coat, with long pocket-flaps, buttoned across his under dress, and wearing, in strict conformity to the cut of the coat, a pair of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron Steuben’s]] military-shaped boots, coming above the knees." Mr. Watson says, for riding-habit, "his hat flapped before and cocked up smartly behind, covering a full-bottomed powdered [[wig]], in the front of which might be seen an eagle-pointed nose, separating a pair of piercing black eyes, his lips exhibiting, but only now and then, a quick motion, as though at the moment he was endeavoring to extract the essence of a small [[Pound sterling|quid]]. As thus described in habit and in person, he was to be seen almost daily, in fair weather, mounted on a short, fat, black, switch-tailed [[mare]], and riding for his amusement and exercise, in a brisk racking canter, about the streets and suburbs of the city." 

He died of [[apoplexy]], March 19, 1808, in the same house in which he lived for more than half a century, on Second Street, about one-third of a square from Arch, on the west side, next to Dr. Ustick's [[Baptist]] Church. He was predeceased by his youngest daughter, in 1806, and his wife.
