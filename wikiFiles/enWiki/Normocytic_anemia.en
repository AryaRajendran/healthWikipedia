'''Normocytic anemia''' is a common issue that occurs for men and women typically over 85 years old. Its prevalence increases with age, reaching 44 percent in men older than 85 years.<ref name=AAFP>{{cite journal |author=Brill JR, Baumgardner DJ |title=Normocytic anemia |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=62 |issue=10 |pages=2255â€“64 |year=2000 |month=November |pmid=11126852 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20001115/2255.html}}</ref> Normocytic anemia is the most frequently encountered type of anemia.<ref name=AAFP/> 

==Classification==
A normocytic anemia is defined as an anemia with an [[Mean_corpuscular_volume|MCV]] of 80-100 which is the normal range.  However, the hematocrit and hemoglobin is decreased.<ref name=AAFP />

==Causes==
The issue is thought of as representing any of the following: 
* a decreased production of normal-sized red blood cells (e.g., anemia of chronic disease, [[aplastic anemia]]); 
* an increased production of HbS as seen in sickle cell disease (not sickle cell trait);
* an increased destruction or loss of red blood cells (e.g., hemolysis, posthemorrhagic anemia); 
* an uncompensated increase in [[Blood plasma|plasma]] volume (e.g., [[pregnancy]], fluid overload); 
* a B2 ([[riboflavin]]) deficiency<ref>Medical Physiolgy by Kibble and Halsey p295</ref>
* a B6 ([[pyridoxine]]) deficiency<ref>Medical Physiolgy by Kibble and Halsey p295</ref>
* or a mixture of conditions producing [[microcytic anemia|microcytic]] and [[macrocytic anemia]].<ref name=AAFP/>
