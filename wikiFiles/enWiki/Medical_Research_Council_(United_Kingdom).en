The '''Medical Research Council''' (the '''MRC''') is a publicly funded [[government agency]] responsible for co-ordinating and funding medical research in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is one of seven [[Research Council]]s in the UK and is answerable to, although politically independent from, the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]]. 

The MRC focuses on high-impact research and has provided the financial support and scientific expertise behind a number of medical breakthroughs, including the development of penicillin and the discovery of the structure of DNA. Research funded by the MRC has produced 29 Nobel Prize winners to date.

==History==
The MRC was founded as the ''Medical Research Committee and Advisory Council'' in 1913,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=121&CATLN=1&accessmethod=5&j=1/|title=Records created or inherited by the Medical Research Council |accessdate=28 February 2012|publisher=The National Archives}}</ref> with its prime role being the distribution of medical research funds under the terms of the [[National Insurance Act 1911]]. This was a consequence of the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis, which recommended the creation of a permanent medical research body. The mandate was not limited to tuberculosis, however.

In 1920, it became the Medical Research ''Council'' under [[Royal Charter]]. A supplementary Charter was formally approved by the Queen on 17 July 2003.

In August 2012 the creation of the MRC-NIHR Phenome Centre, a research centre for personalised medicine, was announced.<ref name=the1812>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=420740&c=1|title=London 2012 legacy to include medical research centre|accessdate=1 August 2012|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=1 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=bbc1812>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19066103|title=Legacy for anti-doping centre|accessdate=1 August 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=1 August 2012}}</ref> The centre will be based at [[GlaxoSmithKline]]'s research and development facility in Harlow, Essex, inheriting the anti-doping facilities used to test samples during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.<ref name=the1812/><ref name=bbc1812/> The centre will be led by Imperial College London and will be funded with two five-year grants of £5 million from the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research.<ref name=the1812/><ref name=bbc1812/>

==Organisation and leadership==
{{Unreferenced section|January 2012|date=January 2012}}
The MRC is one of seven [[Research Council]]s and since 6 June 2009 has been answerable to, although politically independent from, the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/links/pages/mrc.aspx|title=RCUK: Medical Research Council|accessdate=28 February 2012|publisher=Research Councils UK}}</ref> In the past, the MRC has been answerable to the [[Office of Science and Innovation]], part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]].

The MRC is governed by a council of 14 members, which convenes every two months. Its Council, which directs and oversees corporate policy and science strategy, ensures that the MRC is effectively managed, and makes policy and spending decisions. Council members are drawn from industry, academia, government and the NHS. Members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills. Daily management is in the hands of the Chief Executive. Members of the council also chair specialist boards on specific areas of research. For specific subjects, the council convenes committees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrc.ac.uk/About/Structure/Council/index.htm|title=MRC Council|accessdate=28 February 2012|publisher=Medical Research Council}}</ref>
