[[Cervical cancer]] is staged by the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO) staging system, which is based on clinical examination, rather than surgical findings. It allows only the following diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, [[colposcopy]], endocervical [[curettage]], [[hysteroscopy]], [[cystoscopy]], [[proctoscopy]], intravenous [[urography]], and [[X-ray]] examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical [[conization]].

*Stage 0        The carcinoma is confined to the surface layer (cells lining) of the cervix. Also called carcinoma ''in situ'' (CIS).

*Stage I	The carcinoma has grown deeper into the cervix, but has not spread beyond it (extension to the corpus would be disregarded).
:IA	Invasive carcinoma which can be diagnosed only by microscopy, with deepest
	invasion <5&nbsp;mm and the largest extension <7&nbsp;mm

::IA1	Measured stromal invasion of <3.0 mm in depth and extension of <7.0 mm

::IA2	Measured stromal invasion of >3.0 mm and not >5.0 mm with an extension of
	not >7.0&nbsp;mm
:IB	Clinically visible lesions limited to the cervix uteri or pre-clinical cancers
	greater than stage IA

::IB1	Clinically visible lesion <4.0 cm in greatest dimension

::IB2	Clinically visible lesion >4.0 cm in greatest dimension

*Stage II	Cervical carcinoma invades beyond the uterus, but not to the pelvic wall or to the lower third of the vagina

:IIA	Without parametrial invasion
::IIA1	Clinically visible lesion <4.0 cm in greatest dimension

::IIA2	Clinically visible lesion >4.0 cm in greatest dimension

:IIB	With obvious parametrial invasion

*Stage III	The tumour extends to the pelvic wall and/or involves lower third of the vagina and/or causes hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney

:IIIA	Tumour involves lower third of the vagina, with no extension to the pelvic wall
 
:IIIB	Extension to the pelvic wall and/or hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney

*Stage IV	The carcinoma has extended beyond the true pelvis or has involved (biopsy proven) the mucosa of the bladder or rectum.  A bullous oedema, as such, does not permit a case to be allotted to Stage IV
:IVA	Spread of the growth to adjacent organs
:IVB	Spread to distant organs

Treatment is discussed below, but should be individualised to the patient, her age, reproductive goals, functional status, and access to health care resources.
