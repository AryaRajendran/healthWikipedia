The '''Buchanan Medal''' is awarded by the [[Royal Society]] every year "in recognition of distinguished contribution to the medical sciences generally". The award was created in 1897 from a fund to the memory of London physician Sir George Buchanan (1831–1895). It was to be awarded once every five years, but since 1990 the medal has been awarded every two years.<ref name="buch">{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1762|title=The Buchanan Medal (1897)|publisher=Royal Society|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> Since its creation, it has been awarded 28 times, and unlike other Royal Society medals such as the [[Royal Medal]], it has never been awarded to the same individual multiple times. As a result of the criteria for the medal, most of the winners have been doctors or other medical professionals; an exception was [[Frederick Warner (engineer)|Frederick Warner]], an engineer who won the medal in 1982 "for his important role in reducing pollution of the River Thames and of his significant contributions to risk assessment".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1763|title=Buchanan recent winners (2006 - 1962)|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref>

One winner has also won a Nobel Prize: [[Barry Marshall]], who was awarded the Buchanan Medal in 1998 "in recognition of his work on discovering the role of Helicobacter pylori as a cause of diseases such as duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gastric cancer and gastritis-associated dyspepsia" and won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title =The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2005| publisher =[[Nobel Foundation]]| year =2005| url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/illpres/| accessdate = 2009-01-28 }}</ref> The first winner was [[John Simon (doctor)|John Simon]], who won his medal in 1897 "for his distinguished services as an organizer of medical sanitary administration in this country, and as a promoter of scientific research relating to public health"; the most recent winner was [[Peter Cresswell (scientist)|Peter Cresswell]], who won the medal in 2010 "for his outstanding contributions to immunology, in particular to our understanding of the processing of foreign protein antigens within cells to stimulate T-cell immune responses."<ref name="buch"/>
