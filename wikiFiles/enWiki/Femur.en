The '''femur''' (pl. ''femurs'' or ''femora''), or '''thigh bone''', is the most [[proximal]] (closest to the center of the body) [[bone]] of the [[leg]] in [[tetrapod]] [[vertebrate]]s capable of [[walking]] or [[jumping]], such as most land [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, many [[reptile]]s such as [[lizard]]s, and [[amphibian]]s such as [[frog]]s. In vertebrates with four legs such as [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s, the femur is found only in the [[rear leg]]s. The [[femur head|head of the femur]] articulates with the [[acetabulum]] in the [[pelvic bone]] forming the [[hip joint]], while the [[Lower extremity of femur|distal part of the femur]] articulates with the [[tibia]] and [[patella]] forming the [[knee joint]]. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body.

==In humans==
The femur is the only bone in the [[thigh]]. The two femurs converge [[Anatomical terms of location|medially]] towards the [[knee]]s, where they articulate with the [[Anatomical terms of location|proximal]] ends of the [[tibia]]e. The angle of convergence of the femora is a major factor in determining the [[femoral-tibial angle]]. In females the femora converge more than in males because the [[pelvic bone]] is wider in females. In the condition [[genu valgum|''genu valgum'' (knock knee)]] the femurs converge so much that the knees touch one another. The opposite extreme is [[Genu varum|''genu varum'' (bow-leggedness)]]. In the general population of people without either ''genu valgum'' or ''genu varum'',  the femoral-tibial angle is about 175 degrees.<ref name=Bojsen>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=239–241 |accessdate=December 6, 2012}}</ref>

The femur is the longest, heaviest and by most measures the strongest bone in the human body. Its length is 26% of the persons height, a ratio that is useful in [[anthropology]] because it offers a basis for a reasonable estimate of a subject's height from an incomplete [[human skeleton|skeleton]].

The femur is categorised as a [[long bone]] and comprises a [[diaphysis]], [[body of femur|the shaft (or body)]] and two [[epiphysis]] or extremities that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee.<ref name=Bojsen/>

===Upper extremity===
{{Main|Upper extremity of femur}}
[[Image:Gray243.png|thumb|275px|The [[Upper extremity of femur|upper extremity]] of right femur viewed from behind and above, showing [[Femur head|head]], [[neck of femur|neck]], and the [[greater trochanter|greater]] and [[lesser trochanter]]]]
The [[Upper extremity of femur|upper]] or proximal extremity (close to the [[torso]]) contains the [[Femur head|head]], [[neck of femur|neck]], the two [[Human trochanter|trochanter]]s and adjacent structures.<ref name=Bojsen/>

The [[femur head|head of femur]], which [[joint (anatomy)|articulates]] with the [[acetabulum]] of the [[pelvic bone]], composes two-thirds of a [[sphere]]. It has a small groove, or [[Fovea of head of femur|foeva]], connected through the [[Ligament of head of femur|round ligament]] to the sides of the [[acetabular notch]]. The head of the femur is connected to the [[shaft of femur|shaft]] through the [[neck of femur|neck]] or ''collum''. The neck is 4–5&nbsp;cm. long and the diameter is smallest front to back and compressed at its middle. The collum forms an angle with the shaft in about 130 degrees. This angle is highly variant. In the [[infant]] it is about 150 degrees and in [[old age]] reduced to 120 degrees on average. An abnormal increase in the angle is known as [[coxa valga]] and an abnormal reduction is called [[coxa vara]]. Both the head and neck of the femur is vastly embedded in the [[Muscles of the hip|hip musculature]] and can not be directly [[Palpation|palpated]]. In skinny people with the thigh laterally rotated the head of the femur can be felt deep as a resistance [[profound]] (deep) for the [[femoral artery]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

The transition area between the head and neck is quite rough due to attachement of muscles and the [[capsule of hip joint|hip joint capsule]]. Here the two [[Human trochanter|trochanter]]s, [[greater trochanter|greater]] and [[lesser trochanter]], is found. The greater trochanter is almost box-shaped and is the most [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] prominet of the femur. The highest point of the greater trochanter is located higher than the collum and reaches the midpoint of the [[hip joint]]. The greater trochanter can easily be felt. The [[trochanteric fossa]] is a deep depression bounded posteriorly by the intertrochanteric crest on medial surface of the greater trochanter.
The lesser trochanter is a cone-shaped extension of the lowest part of the femur neck. The two trochanters are joined by the [[intertrochanteric crest]] on the back side and by the [[intertrochanteric line]] on the front.<ref name=Bojsen/>

A slight ridge is sometimes seen commencing about the middle of the intertrochanteric crest, and reaching vertically downward for about 5&nbsp;cm. along the back part of the body: it is called the [[linea quadrata]] (or quadrate line).

About the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds on the intertrochanteric crest is the [[quadrate tubercle]] located. The size of the tubercle varies and it is not alway located on the intertrochanteric crest and that also adjecent areas can be part of the quadrate tubercel, such as the posterior surfare of the greater trochanter or the neck of the femur. In a small anatomical study is was shown that the [[Epiphyseal plate|epiphysial line]] passes directly trough the quadrate tubercle.<ref name="pmid17104699">{{cite journal |author=Sunderland S |title=The Quadrate Tubercle of the Femur |journal=J. Anat. |volume=72 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=309–12 |year=1938 |month=January |pmid=17104699 |pmc=1252427 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Body===
{{Main|body of femur}}
The [[body of femur|body of the femur (or shaft)]] is long, slender and almost cylindrical in form. It is a little broader above than in the center, broadest and somewhat flattened from before backward below. It is slightly arched, so as to be convex in front, and concave behind, where it is strengthened by a prominent longitudinal ridge, the [[linea aspera]] which diverges proximal and distal as the medial and lateral ridge. Proximal the lateral ridge of the linea aspera becomes the [[gluteal tuberosity]] while the medial ridge continues as the [[Pectineal line (femur)|pectineal line]]. Besides the lilea aspera the shaft has two other bordes; a [[body of femur#Lateral border and medial border|lateral and medial border]]. These three bordes separates the shaft into three surfaces: One [[body of femur#Anterior surface|anterior]], one medial and one lateral. Due to the vast [[Thigh#Muscles and Fascia of the Thigh|musculature of the thigh]] the shaft can not be [[Palpation|palpated]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

The [[third trochanter]] is a bony projection occasionally present on the proximal femur near the superior border of the gluteal tuberosity. When present, it is oblong, rounded, or conical in shape and sometimes continuous with the gluteal ridge.<ref name="Lozanoff-1985">{{cite journal | ref = harv

===Lower extremity===
{{Main|Lower extremity of femur}}
[[File:Gray246.png|thumbnail|right|Lower extremity of right femur viewed from below.]]
[[File:Gray348.png|thumbnail|right|Left [[knee joint]] from behind, showing interior ligaments.]]
The [[lower extremity of femur|lower extremity of the femur]] (or distal extremity) is larger than the [[upper extremity of femur|upper extremity]]. It is somewhat cuboid in form, but its transverse diameter is greater than its antero-posterior (front to back). It consists of two oblong eminences known as the [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyles]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

Anteriorly, the condyles are slightly prominent and are separated by a smooth shallow articular depression called the [[patellar surface]]. Posteriorly, they project considerably and a deep notch, the [[Intercondylar fossa of femur]], is present between them. The [[lateral condyle of femur|lateral condyle]] is the more prominent and is the broader both in its antero-posterior and transverse diameters, the [[medial condyle of tibia|medial condyle]] is the longer and, when the femur is held with its body perpendicular, projects to a lower level. When, however, the femur is in its natural oblique position the lower surfaces of the two condyles lie practically in the same horizontal plane. The condyles are not quite parallel with one another; the long axis of the lateral is almost directly antero-posterior, but that of the medial runs backward and medialward. Their opposed surfaces are small, rough, and concave, and form the walls of the [[Anterior intercondyloid fossa|intercondyloid fossa]]. This fossa is limited above by a ridge, the [[intercondyloid line of femur|intercondyloid line]], and below by the central part of the posterior margin of the patellar surface. The [[posterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]] joint is attached to the lower and front part of the medial wall of the fossa and the [[anterior cruciate ligament]] to an impression on the upper and back part of its lateral wall.<ref name=Bojsen/>

The articular surface of the lower end of the femur occupies the anterior, inferior, and posterior surfaces of the condyles. Its front part is named the [[patellar surface]] and articulates with the [[patella]]; it presents a median groove which extends downward to the [[intercondylar fossa of femur|intercondyloid fossa]] and two convexities, the lateral of which is broader, more prominent, and extends farther upward than the medial.<ref name=Bojsen/>

Each condyle is surmounted by an elevation, the [[epicondyle]]. The [[medial epicondyle of the femur|medial epicondyle]] is a large convex eminence to which the [[tibial collateral ligament]] of the knee-joint is attached. At its upper part is the [[adductor tubercle]] and behind it is a rough impression which gives origin to the medial head of the [[gastrocnemius]]. The [[lateral epicondyle of the femur|lateral epicondyle]] which is smaller and less prominent than the medial, gives attachment to the [[fibular collateral ligament]] of the [[knee-joint]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

===Fractures===
{{Main|Femoral fracture}}
A [[femoral fracture]] that involves the [[femoral head]], [[femoral neck]] or the [[shaft of the femur]] immediately below the lesser trochanter may be classified as a [[hip fracture]], especially when associated with [[osteoporosis]].

==Other species==
In primitive tetrapods, the main points of muscle attachment along the femur are the '''internal trochanter''' and '''fourth trochanter''', and a ridge along the ventral surface of the femoral shaft referred to as the '''adductor crest'''. The neck of the femur is generally minimal or absent in the most primitive forms, reflecting a simple attachment to the acetabulum. The greater trochanter was present in the extinct [[archosaur]]s, as well as in modern birds and mammals, being associated with the loss of the primitive sprawling gait. The lesser trochanter is a unique development of mammals, which lack both the internal and fourth trochanters. The adductor crest is also often absent in mammals or alternatively reduced to a series of creases along the surface of the bone.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 204–205|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

One of the earliest known vertebrates to have a femur is the ''[[eusthenopteron]]'', a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] from the [[Late Devonian]] period.

Structures analogous to the [[third trochanter]] are present in mammals, including some primates.<ref name=Bolanowski-2005/>

===Terminology in invertebrate zoology===
In [[invertebrate zoology]] the name ''femur'' appears in [[arthropod]]ology. The usage is not homologous with that of vertebrate anatomy; the term "femur" simply has been adopted by analogy and refers, where applicable, to the most proximal of (usually) the two longest jointed segments of the legs of the [[arthropoda]]. The two basal segments preceding the femur are the [[Arthropod leg|coxa]] and [[Arthropod leg|trochanter]]. This convention is not followed in [[Crustacean|carcinology]] but it applies in [[arachnology]] and [[entomology]]. In [[Myriapoda|myriapodology]] another segment, the prefemur, connects the trochanter and femur.

== Etymology ==
In medical Latin the [[genitive]] form of ''femur'' is always ''femoris'', but in [[classical Latin]] the genitive is often ''feminis'', and should not be confused with case forms of ''femina'', which means "woman".
