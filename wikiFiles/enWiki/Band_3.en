'''Anion Exchanger 1''' ('''AE1''') or '''Band 3''' is a [[phylogenetically]] preserved [[Membrane transport protein|transport protein]] responsible for mediating the [[Secondary active transport#Antiport|exchange]] of [[chloride]] (Cl-) for [[bicarbonate]] (HCO3-) across a [[plasma membrane]]. Functionally similar members of the AE clade are [[SLC4A2|AE2]] and [[SLC4A3|AE3]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|19448077}}</ref>

It is ubiquitous throughout the [[vertebrates]]. In [[humans]] it is present in two specific sites:
* the [[erythrocyte]] (red blood cell) cell membrane and
* the [[basolateral]] surface of the alpha-[[intercalated cell]] (the acid secreting cell type) in the [[collecting duct]] of the [[kidney]].

The erythrocyte and kidney forms are different [[isoforms]] of the same [[protein]].<ref name="pmid3461480">{{cite journal | author = Schlüter K, Drenckhahn D | title = Co-clustering of denatured hemoglobin with band 3: its role in binding of autoantibodies against band 3 to abnormal and aged erythrocytes | journal = Proc.

==Discovery==
AE1 was discovered following [[SDS-PAGE]] [[gel electrophoresis]] of erythrocyte [[cell membrane]]. The large 'third' band on the electrophoresis gel represented AE1, which was thus initially termed 'Band 3'.
The chloride-bicarbonate exchanger in the red cell membrane is not a [[Ion pump (biology)|pump]], which would use metabolic energy. Nor is it strictly an [[enzyme]]. It is protein [[counter-transporter]], known as band III.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hunter M | title = Human erythrocyte anion permeabilities measured under conditions of net charge transfer | journal = J Physiol | volume = 268 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–49 | year = 1977 | pmid = 874904 | pmc = 1283651}}</ref>

==AE1 in Red Cells==
AE1 is an important structural component of the erythrocyte cell membrane, making up to 25% of the cell membrane surface.  Each red cell contains approximately one million copies of AE1.

===Function===
Here it performs two functions:

* Electroneutral chloride and bicarbonate exchange across the plasma membrane on a one-for-one basis.This is crucial for CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by the red cell and conversion (by hydration catalysed by [[carbonic anhydrase]]) into a [[proton]] and a [[bicarbonate]] ion. The bicarbonate is then extruded (in exchange for a chloride) from the cell by the band 3 molecule.

* Physical linkage of the plasma membrane to the underlying membrane skeleton (via binding with [[ankyrin]] and [[protein 4.2]]). This appears to be to prevent membrane surface loss, rather than being to do with membrane skeleton assembly.

===Pathology===
Mutations of erythroid AE1 affecting the extracellular domains of the molecule may cause alterations in the individual's blood group, as band 3 determines the [[Diego antigen system|Diego]] [[Human blood group systems|blood group]].

More importantly erythroid AE1 mutations cause between 15-25% of cases of [[Hereditary spherocytosis]] (a disorder associated with progressive red cell membrane loss), and also cause the hereditary conditions of [[Hereditary stomatocytosis]] <ref>{{cite journal

==AE1 in Alpha-Intercalated cells==
A different isoform of AE1, known as kAE1 (which is 65 amino acids shorter than erythroid AE1) is found in the [[basolateral]] surface of the alpha-intercalated cell in the [[cortical collecting duct]] of the kidney.

===Function===
This is the principal acid secreting cell of the kidney, which generates [[hydrogen]] ions and bicarbonate ions from carbon dioxide and water-a reaction catalysed by [[Carbonic anhydrase]].

The hydrogen ions are pumped into the collecting duct tubule by [[vacuolar H+ATPase]], the apical [[proton pump]],which thus excretes acid into the [[urine]].

kAE1 exchanges bicarbonate for chloride on the basolateral surface, essentially returning bicarbonate to the blood.

===Pathology===
Mutations of kidney AE1 cause distal (type1) [[renal tubular acidosis]], which is an inability to acidify the urine, even if the blood is too [[acid]].
These mutations are disease causing as they cause mistargetting of the mutant band 3 proteins so that they are retained within the cell or occasionally addressed to the wrong (i.e. apical) surface.
