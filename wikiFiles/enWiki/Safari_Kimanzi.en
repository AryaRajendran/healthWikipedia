ADRA had raised $180,000 in 2001, for Safari's village and for his education and care. Criticisms aired on television program ''[[A Current Affair]]'' and Sydney radio station [[2GB]], on 7 January. In response ADRA rejected the charges, and claimed a formal NSW state government investigation had found the complaint to be unjustified.<ref>"[http://www.adra.org.au/newsroom/news/ADRA_Allocated_All_Funds_to_Safari_and_Community.htm ADRA Allocated All Funds to Safari and Community]", ADRA website, 8 January 2010</ref> Dr. [[David Pennington]], the head of plastic surgery at the RPA hospital, and who led the surgical team, also rejected the charges.<ref>[http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=993202 Safari statement], ''A Current Affair'' website; 12 January 2010</ref>
