A connection between cancer regression and viruses has long been theorized, and case reports of regression ([[cervical cancer]], [[Burkitt lymphoma]], [[Hodgkin lymphoma]]) after immunization or infection with an unrelated virus appeared at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name="pmid15917655">{{cite journal |pages=524–31 |doi=10.4161/cbt.4.5.1820 |title=Viral oncolysis by herpes simplex virus and other viruses |year=2005 |last1=Kuruppu |first1=Darshini |last2=Tanabe |first2=Kenneth K. |journal=Cancer Biology & Therapy |volume=4 |issue=5}}</ref> Efforts to treat cancer through [[immunization]] or deliberate infection with a virus began in the mid-20th century.<ref name="pmid15917655" /><ref name="pmid2555836">{{cite journal |pmid=2555836 |year=1989 |last1=Voroshilova |first1=MK |title=Potential use of nonpathogenic enteroviruses for control of human disease |volume=36 |pages=191–202 |journal=Progress in medical virology}}</ref>  As the technology for creating a custom virus did not exist, all early efforts focused on finding natural oncolytic viruses.

===Herpes simplex virus===
[[Herpes simplex virus]] (HSV) was one of the first viruses to be adapted to attack cancer cells selectively, because it was well understood, easy to manipulate and relatively harmless in its natural state (merely causing [[cold sore]]s) so likely to pose fewer risks. The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) mutant 1716 lacks both copies of the ICP34.5 gene, and as a result is no longer able to replicate in terminally [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] and non-[[cell division|dividing cells]] but will infect and cause [[lysis]] very efficiently in cancer cells, and this has proved to be an effective tumour-targeting strategy.<ref>Maclean, AR, Fareed, MU et al.

In 1996, the first approval was given in Europe for a [[clinical trial]] using the oncolytic virus HSV1716.

Other oncolytic viruses based on HSV have also been developed and are in clinical trials, most notably [[OncoVex GM-CSF]], developed by Amgen, which has successfully completed a pivotal Phase III trial for advanced melanoma. This study met its primary endpoint (durable response rate) with a very high degree of statistical significance in March 2013, the first positive phase 3 study for an oncolytic virus in the western world.

===Oncorine (H101)===
The first oncolytic virus to be approved by a regulatory agency was a genetically modified adenovirus named [[H101 virus|H101]] by Shanghai Sunway Biotech. It gained regulatory approval in 2005 from China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the treatment of head and neck cancer.<ref name="pmid18183014">{{cite journal |pages=37–53 |doi=10.1038/nbt0108-37 |title=Chinese health biotech and the billion-patient market |year=2008 |last1=Frew |first1=Sarah E |last2=Sammut |first2=Stephen M |last3=Shore |first3=Alysha F |last4=Ramjist |first4=Joshua K |last5=Al-Bader |first5=Sara |last6=Rezaie |first6=Rahim |last7=Daar |first7=Abdallah S |last8=Singer |first8=Peter A |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=26 |pmid=18183014 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name="pmid16507823">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/djj111 |title=China Approves World's First Oncolytic Virus Therapy for Cancer Treatment |year=2006 |last1=Garber |first1=K. |journal=JNCI Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=298–300}}</ref> Sunway's [[H101 virus|H101]] and the very similar [[Onyx-15]] have been engineered to remove a viral defense mechanism that interacts with a normal human gene ''[[p53]]'', which is very frequently dysregulated in cancer cells.<ref name="pmid16507823"/> Despite the promises of early ''in vivo'' lab work, these viruses do not specifically infect cancer cells, but they still kill cancer cells preferentially.<ref name="pmid16507823"/>  While overall survival rates are not known, short-term response rates are approximately doubled for H101 plus chemotherapy when compared to chemotherapy alone.<ref name="pmid16507823"/>  It appears to work best when injected directly into a tumour, and when any resulting fever is not suppressed.<ref name="pmid16507823"/>  Systemic therapy (such as through infusion through an intravenous line) is desirable for treating metastatic disease.<ref name="pmid18167474">{{cite journal |pmid=18167474 |url=http://www.medicinaoral.com/medoralfree01/v13i1/medoralv13i1p15.pdf |year=2008 |last1=Ayllón Barbellido |first1=S |last2=Campo Trapero |first2=J |last3=Cano Sánchez |first3=J |last4=Perea García |first4=MA |last5=Escudero Castaño |first5=N |last6=Bascones Martínez |first6=A |title=Gene therapy in the management of oral cancer: Review of the literature |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=E15–21 |journal=Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal}}</ref> It is now marketed under the brand name Oncorine.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Guo|first=J|coauthors=Xin, H|title=Chinese gene therapy.

==Possible applications==

The specificity and flexibility of oncolytic viruses means they have the potential to treat a wide range of cancers with minimal [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Viral agents administered [[intravenous]]ly have the potential to be effective against [[metastatic]] cancers, which are especially difficult to treat conventionally, although none have been so far.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} However, blood-borne viruses can be deactivated by [[antibodies]] and cleared from the blood quickly e.g. by [[Kupffer cells]] (extremely active [[phagocytic]] cells in the liver, which are responsible for adenovirus clearance). {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Oncolytic behaviour of wild-type viruses==

===Vesicular stomatitis virus===
[[Vesicular stomatitis virus]] (VSV) is a rhabdovirus, consisting of 5 genes encoded by a negative sense, single-stranded RNA genome. In nature, VSV infects insects as well as livestock, where it causes a relatively localized and non-fatal illness. The low pathogenicity of this virus is due in large part to its sensitivity to interferons, a class of proteins that are released into the tissues and bloodstream during infection. These molecules activate genetic anti-viral defence programs that protect cells from infection and prevent spread of the virus. However in 2000, Stojdl, Lichty et al.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=821–5 |doi=10.1038/77558 |year=2000 |last1=Bell |first1=John C. |last2=Stojdl |first2=David F. |last3=Lichty |first3=Brian |last4=Knowles |first4=Shane |last5=Marius |first5=Ricardo |last6=Atkins |first6=Harold |last7=Sonenberg |first7=Nahum |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=6 |issue=7 |pmid=10888934 |title=Exploiting tumor-specific defects in the interferon pathway with a previously unknown oncolytic virus}}</ref> demonstrated that defects in these pathways render cancer cells unresponsive to the protective effects of interferons and therefore highly sensitive to infection with VSV. Since VSV undergoes a rapid cytolytic replication cycle, infection leads to death of the malignant cell and roughly a 1000-fold amplification of virus within 24h. VSV is therefore highly suitable for therapeutic application, and several groups have gone on to show that systemically administered VSV can be delivered to a tumour site, where it replicates and induces disease regression, often leading to durable cures.<ref name=Stojdl03>{{cite journal |pages=263–75 |doi=10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00241-1 |title=VSV strains with defects in their ability to shutdown innate immunity are potent systemic anti-cancer agents |year=2003 |last1=Stojdl |first1=David F |last2=Lichty |first2=Brian D |last3=Tenoever |first3=Benjamin R |last4=Paterson |first4=Jennifer M |last5=Power |first5=Anthony T |last6=Knowles |first6=Shane |last7=Marius |first7=Ricardo |last8=Reynard |first8=Jennifer |last9=Poliquin |first9=Laurent |journal=Cancer Cell |volume=4 |issue=4 |pmid=14585354}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=34–49 |doi=10.1016/j.virol.2004.08.039 |title=Sensitivity of prostate tumors to wild type and M protein mutant vesicular stomatitis viruses |year=2004 |last1=Ahmed |first1=M |last2=Cramer |first2=S |last3=Lyles |first3=D |journal=Virology |volume=330 |pmid=15527832 |issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=350–8 |doi=10.1038/sj.cgt.7700794 |title=Systemic therapy of experimental breast cancer metastases by mutant vesicular stomatitis virus in immune-competent mice |year=2004 |last1=Ebert |first1=Oliver |last2=Harbaran |first2=Sonal |last3=Shinozaki |first3=Katsunori |last4=Woo |first4=Savio L C |journal=Cancer Gene Therapy |volume=12 |issue=4 |pmid=15565179}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14678998 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14678998 |year=2003 |last1=Porosnicu |first1=M |last2=Mian |first2=A |last3=Barber |first3=GN |title=The oncolytic effect of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus is enhanced by expression of the fusion cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase suicide gene |volume=63 |issue=23 |pages=8366–76 |journal=Cancer Research}})</ref> Attenuation of the virus by engineering a deletion of Met-51 of the matrix protein ablates virtually all infection of normal tissues, while replication in tumour cells is unaffected.<ref name=Stojdl03/>

===Poliovirus===
[[Poliovirus]] is a natural neuropathogen, making it the obvious choice for selective replication in tumours derived from neuronal cells. Poliovirus has a plus-strand RNA genome, the [[translation]] of which depends on a tissue-specific [[internal ribosome entry site]] (IRES) within the 5' untranslated region of the viral genome, which is active in cells of neuronal origin and allows translation of the viral genome without a 5’ cap.

===Reovirus===

[[Reoviridae|Reovirus]], an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, generally infects mammalian respiratory and bowel systems. Most people have been exposed to reovirus by adulthood; however, the infection does not typically produce symptoms.

===Senecavirus===

[[Seneca Valley virus|Senecavirus]], also known as Seneca Valley Virus, is a naturally occurring wild-type oncolytic [[picornavirus]] discovered in 2001 as a tissue culture contaminate at Genetic Therapy, Inc. The initial isolate, SVV-001, is being developed as an anti-cancer therapeutic by Neotropix, Inc. under the name NTX-010 for cancers with neuroendocrine features including small cell lung cancer and a variety of pediatric solid tumours.

==Engineering oncolytic viruses==

===Attenuation===
Cancer cells and virus-infected cells have similar alterations in their cell signalling pathways, particularly those that govern progression through the [[cell cycle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Chow|first=Amy|title=Cell Cycle Control by Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors: Driving the Transformation of Normal Cells into Cancerous Cells|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-cycle-control-by-oncogenes-and-tumor-14191459|publisher=Nature Education|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref>  A viral gene whose function is to alter a pathway is dispensable in cells where the pathway is defective, but not in cells where the pathway is active. Attenuation involves deleting viral genes, or gene regions, to eliminate viral functions that are expendable in tumour cell, but not in normal cells.

The enzymes [[thymidine kinase]] and [[ribonucleotide reductase]] in cells are responsible for [[DNA replication|DNA synthesis]] and are only expressed in cells which are actively replicating.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/thymidine%20kinase|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref>  These [[enzymes]] also exist in the genomes of certain viruses (E.g. HSV, vaccinia) and allow viral replication in [[G0 phase|quiescent]](non-replicating) cells,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gentry|first=GA|title=Viral thymidine kinases and their relatives.|journal=Pharmacology & therapeutics|year=1992|volume=54|issue=3|pages=319–55|pmid=1334563|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1334563}}</ref> so if they are inactivated by mutation the virus will only be able to replicate in proliferating cells, such as cancer cells. 
<!-- citations to come shortly -->

===Generating tumour selectivity===

There are two main approaches for generating tumour selectivity: transductional and non-transductional targeting. Transductional targeting involves modifying the specificity of viral coat protein, thus increasing entry into target cells while reducing entry to non-target cells. Non-transductional targeting involves altering the genome of the virus so it can only replicate in [[cancer cells]]. This can be done by either [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] targeting, where [[genes]] essential for viral [[DNA replication|replication]] are placed under the control of a tumour-specific [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], or by [[attenuation]], which involves introducing deletions into the viral genome that eliminate functions that are dispensable in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. There are also other, slightly more obscure methods.

====Transductional targeting====

This approach to tumour selectivity has mainly focused on adenoviruses and HSV-1, although it is entirely viable with other viruses.

Transductional targeting can be done in one of two ways:

*'''Adapter molecules''' 
:Bi-specific adapter molecules can be administered along with the virus to redirect viral coat protein tropism. These molecules are [[fusion protein]]s that are made up of an [[antibody]] raised against the knob domain of the adenovirus coat protein, fused to a natural [[ligand]] for a cell-surface receptor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Everts|first=M|coauthors=Curiel, DT|title=Transductional targeting of adenoviral cancer gene therapy.|journal=Current gene therapy|date=2004 Sep|volume=4|issue=3|pages=337–46|pmid=15384947|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15384947}}</ref>  The use of adapter molecules has been shown to increase viral transduction. However, adapters add complexity to the system, and the effect of adapter molecule binding on the stability of the virus is uncertain.

*'''Coat-protein modification'''
:This method involves genetically modifying the fiber knob domain of the viral coat protein to alter its specificity. ''Wickham et al. (2003)''<ref>{{cite journal |pages=135–9 |doi=10.1038/nm0103-135 |title=Ligand-directed targeting of genes to the site of disease |year=2003 |last1=Wickham |first1=Thomas J. |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=9 |pmid=12514727 |issue=1}}</ref> added short [[peptide]]s to the [[C-terminal]] end of the coat protein, which successfully altered viral tropism. The addition of larger peptides to the C-terminus is not viable because it reduces adenovirus integrity, possibly due to an effect on fiber trimerisation. The fiber protein also contains an HI-loop structure, which can tolerate peptide insertions of up to 100 residues without any negative effects on adenovirus integrity. Davydova et al. (2004) inserted an RGD motif in the HI loop of the fiber knob protein, shifting specificity toward [[integrin]]s, which are frequently over-expressed in [[oesophageal adenocarcinoma]].<ref name=Davydova04>{{cite journal |pages=4319–27 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0064 |title=Infectivity-Enhanced Cyclooxygenase-2-Based Conditionally Replicative Adenoviruses for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Treatment |year=2004 |last1=Davydova |first1=J. |journal=Cancer Research |volume=64 |issue=12 |pmid=15205347 |last2=Le |first2=LP |last3=Gavrikova |first3=T |last4=Wang |first4=M |last5=Krasnykh |first5=V |last6=Yamamoto |first6=M}}</ref> When combined with a form of non-transductional targeting, these viruses proved to be effective and selective therapeutic agents for Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma.

====Non-transductional targeting====

=====Transcriptional targeting=====
Transcriptional targeting places an essential viral gene under the control of a tumour-specific promoter, meaning the gene is only expressed in cell types where all the [[transcription factor]]s required for promoter function are active. A suitable promoter should be active in the tumour but inactive in the majority of normal tissue, particularly the [[liver]], which is the organ that is most exposed to blood born viruses. Many such promoters have been identified and studied for the treatment of a range of cancers.

[[Cyclooxygenase-2]] [[enzyme]] (Cox-2) expression is elevated in a range of cancers, and has low liver expression, making it a suitable tumour-specific promoter. Davydova et al. (2004) targeted ''AdCox2Lluc'', a conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAd), against [[oesophageal adenocarcinoma]] by placing the early genes under the control of a Cox-2 promoter (adenoviruses have two early genes, E1A and E1B, that are essential for replication).<ref name=Davydova04/> When combined with transductional targeting, ''AdCox2Lluc'' showed potential for treatment of Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma. Cox-2 is also a possible tumour-specific promoter candidate for other cancer types, including ovarian cancer.

A suitable tumour-specific promoter for [[prostate cancer]] is prostate-specific [[antigen]] (PSA), whose expression is greatly elevated in prostate cancer. CN706 is a CRAd with a PSA tumour-specific promoter driving expression of the adenoviral E1A gene, required for viral replication. Rodriguez et al. (1997)<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9205053 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9205053 |year=1997 |last1=Rodriguez |first1=R |last2=Schuur |first2=ER |last3=Lim |first3=HY |last4=Henderson |first4=GA |last5=Simons |first5=JW |last6=Henderson |first6=DR |title=Prostate attenuated replication competent adenovirus (ARCA) CN706: A selective cytotoxic for prostate-specific antigen-positive prostate cancer cells |volume=57 |issue=13 |pages=2559–63 |journal=Cancer Research}}</ref> showed that the CN706 titre is significantly greater in PSA-positive cells.

====Double targeting====
It is unlikely to be possible to make a virus entirely specific toward any tissue type by using just one form of targeting. Infection of normal tissue can result in adverse side effects, although oncolytic viruses used in clinical trials have been disabled so that they are designed to replicate only in cancer cells. Double targeting with both transductional and non-transductional targeting methods is more effective than any one form of targeting alone. Davydova et al. (2004) combined transductional targeting with a tumour-specific promoter to successfully target an adenovirus against oesophageal adenocarcinoma.<ref name=Davydova04/>

===Modifications to improve oncolytic activity===
Oncolytic viruses can be used against cancers in ways that are additional to lysis of infected cells.

====Suicide genes====
Viruses can be used as vectors for delivery of suicide genes, encoding enzymes that can metabolise a separately administered non-toxic [[pro-drug]] into a potent [[cytotoxin]], which can diffuse to and kill neighbouring cells. One herpes simplex virus, encoding a thymidine kinase suicide gene, has progressed to phase III clinical trials. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase phosphorylates the [[pro-drug]], ganciclovir, which is then incorporated into [[DNA]], blocking DNA synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=SM|coauthors=Whartenby, KA; Freeman, JL; Abboud, CN; Marrogi, AJ|title=In situ use of suicide genes for cancer therapy.|journal=Seminars in oncology|date=1996 Feb|volume=23|issue=1|pages=31–45|pmid=8607030|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8607030}}</ref>  The tumour selectivity of oncolytic viruses ensures that the suicide genes are only expressed in cancer cells, however a 'bystander effect' on surrounding tumour cells has been described with several suicide gene systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Duarte|first=S|coauthors=Carle, G; Faneca, H; de Lima, MC; Pierrefite-Carle, V|title=Suicide gene therapy in cancer: where do we stand now?|journal=Cancer letters|date=2012 Nov 28|volume=324|issue=2|pages=160–70|pmid=22634584|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22634584}}</ref>

==== Suppression of angiogenesis ====
[[Angiogenesis]] (blood vessel formation) is an essential part of the formation of large tumour masses. Angiogenesis can be inhibited by the expression of several genes, which can be delivered to cancer cells in [[viral vector]]s, resulting in suppression of angiogenesis, and oxygen starvation in the tumour. The infection of cells with viruses containing the genes for angiostatin and endostatin synthesis inhibited tumour growth in mice. Enhanced antitumour activities have been demonstrated in a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding anti-angiogenic therapeutic antibody and with an HSV1716 variant expressing an inhibitor of angiogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=12915–20 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0900660106 |title=Anti-VEGF single-chain antibody GLAF-1 encoded by oncolytic vaccinia virus significantly enhances antitumor therapy |year=2009 |last1=Frentzen |first1=A. |last2=Yu |first2=Y.

A. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=31}}</ref><ref>Conner, J. and Braidwood, L. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22595793 Expression of inhibitor of growth 4 by HSV1716 improves oncolytic potency and enhances efficacy]. ''Cancer Gene Therapy'' 2012; 19: 499-507</ref>

====Immune evasion====
On the one hand, a vigorous immune response against oncolytic viruses can help destroy infected and neighbouring cells, as the body detects signs of infection. On the other hand, the greater the immune response, the more it is possible that spread of virus from infected cancer cells to other cancer cells, may be reduced. In a clinical setting, there are many other factors inside densely packed and often chaotic cancer growths, which can limit effective functioning of the immune system.<ref>Prestwich RJ, Errington F et al. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829276/ The Case of Oncolytic Viruses Versus the Immune System: Waiting on the Judgment of Solomon]. ''Human Gene Therapy'' 2009; 20(10): 1119–1132.</ref>

Avoidance of the immune system until the tumour is destroyed could be the biggest obstacle to the success of this type of oncolytic virus therapy. However, some studies have shown that pre-immunity to oncolytic viruses doesn't cause a significant reduction in efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heo|first=J|coauthors=Reid, T; Ruo, L; Breitbach, CJ; Rose, S; Bloomston, M; Cho, M; Lim, HY; Chung, HC; Kim, CW; Burke, J; Lencioni, R; Hickman, T; Moon, A; Lee, YS; Kim, MK; Daneshmand, M; Dubois, K; Longpre, L; Ngo, M; Rooney, C; Bell, JC; Rhee, BG; Patt, R; Hwang, TH; Kirn, DH|title=Randomized dose-finding clinical trial of oncolytic immunotherapeutic vaccinia JX-594 in liver cancer.|journal=Nature medicine|date=2013 Feb 10|pmid=23396206}}</ref>  Some chemotherapies cause [[immunosuppression]] and studies have shown that when combined with oncolytic viruses, these chemotherapies suppress the antibody response to the virus.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lolkema|first=MP|coauthors=Arkenau, HT; Harrington, K; Roxburgh, P; Morrison, R; Roulstone, V; Twigger, K; Coffey, M; Mettinger, K; Gill, G; Evans, TR; de Bono, JS|title=A phase I study of the combination of intravenous reovirus type 3 Dearing and gemcitabine in patients with advanced cancer.|journal=Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research|date=2011 Feb 1|volume=17|issue=3|pages=581–8|pmid=21106728|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106728}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kottke|first=T|coauthors=Thompson, J; Diaz, RM; Pulido, J; Willmon, C; Coffey, M; Selby, P; Melcher, A; Harrington, K; Vile, RG|title=Improved systemic delivery of oncolytic reovirus to established tumors using preconditioning with cyclophosphamide-mediated Treg modulation and interleukin-2.|journal=Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research|date=2009 Jan 15|volume=15|issue=2|pages=561–9|pmid=19147761|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=reovirus+cyclophosphamide}}</ref> 

In a number of cases, cancer cells exposed to viruses have experienced widespread [[necrosis]] (premature cell death) which cannot be entirely accounted for by viral replication alone. Cytotoxic [[T-cell]] responses directed against virus-infected cells have been identified as an important factor in tumour necrosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sobol|first=Paul T|coauthors=Boudreau, Jeanette E; Stephenson, Kyle; Wan, Yonghong; Lichty, Brian D; Mossman, Karen L|title=Adaptive Antiviral Immunity Is a Determinant of the Therapeutic Success of Oncolytic Virotherapy|journal=Molecular Therapy|date=30 November 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=335–344|doi=10.1038/mt.2010.264|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3034857/}}</ref> 

However, since viruses are normal human pathogens, they induce an [[immune response]], which reduces their effectiveness. Increased [[antibody]] titers could deactivate viruses before the tumour has been destroyed. This can be partly overcome by using [[parental]] viruses that are not normal human pathogens, thereby avoiding any pre-existing immunity. However, this does not avoid subsequent [[antibody]] generation. Alternatively, the viral vector can be coated with a [[polymer]] such as [[polyethylene glycol]], shielding it from antibodies, but this also prevents viral coat proteins adhering to host cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wonganan|first=P|coauthors=Croyle, MA|title=PEGylated Adenoviruses: From Mice to Monkeys.|journal=Viruses|date=2010 Feb|volume=2|issue=2|pages=468–502|pmid=21994645|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3185605/}}</ref>  

Another way to help oncolytic viruses reach cancer growths after intravenous injection, is to hide them inside [[macrophage]]s (a type of [[white blood cell]]).  Macrophages automatically migrate to areas of tissue destruction, especially where oxygen levels are low, characteristic of cancer growths, and have been used successfully to deliver oncolytic viruses to [[prostate cancer]] in animals.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3056}}</ref>

Deactivation of the [[immune system]] is not desirable, since it may have its own anti-tumor activity (see [[#Synergy with host immunity|Synergy with host immunity]], below).

====Radioiodine====
Addition of the [[sodium-iodide symporter]] (NIS) gene to the viral genome causes infected tumour cells to express NIS and accumulate iodine. When combined with [[radioiodine]] therapy it allows local radiotherapy of the tumour, as used to treat thyroid cancer. The radioiodine can also be used to visualise viral replication within the body by the use of a [[gamma camera]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Imaging characteristics, tissue distribution, and spread of a novel oncolytic vaccinia virus carrying the human sodium iodide symporter.|pmid=22912675|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422353/}}</ref> This approach has been used successfully preclinically with adenovirus, measles virus and vaccinia virus.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sodium iodide symporter (NIS)-mediated radiovirotherapy of hepatocellular cancer using a conditionally replicating adenovirus.|pmid=23038026|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23038026}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS)-Mediated Radiovirotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer|doi=10.2214/AJR.09.3672|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3117397/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Oncolytic measles viruses encoding interferon β and the thyroidal sodium iodide symporter gene for mesothelioma virotherapy|doi=10.1038/cgt.2010.10|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2907639/}}</ref>

==Synergy with host immunity==
Although it poses a hurdle by inactivating viruses, the patient's immune system can also act as an ally against tumors; infection attracts the attention of the immune system to the tumour and may help to generate useful and long-lasting antitumor immunity.<ref>

==Oncolytic viruses in conjunction with existing cancer therapies==
It is in conjunction with conventional cancer therapies that oncolytic viruses have often showed the most promise, since combined therapies operate synergistically with no apparent negative effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ottolino-Perry|first=K|coauthors=Diallo, JS; Lichty, BD; Bell, JC; McCart, JA|title=Intelligent design: combination therapy with oncolytic viruses.|journal=Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy|date=2010 Feb|volume=18|issue=2|pages=251–63|pmid=20029399|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20029399}}</ref>

The combined treatment resulted in a synergistic increase in cell death, as well as a significant increase in viral burst size (the number of virus particles released from each cell lysis). No alteration in viral specificity was observed.
SEPREHVIR (HSV-1716) has also shown synergy in pre-clinical research when used in combination with several cancer chemotherapies.<ref>Mace, AT, Harrow, S, et al. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Cmd=ShowLinkOut&Db=pubmed&TermToSearch=17763002 Cytotoxic effects of the oncolytic herpes simplex virus HSV1716 alone and in combination with cisplatin in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.] ''[[Acta Oto-Laryngologica]]'' 2007;127: 880-887</ref><ref>Toyoizumi, T, Mick, R et al.

==In fiction==
In science fiction, the concept of an oncolytic virus was first introduced to the public in [[Jack Williamson]]'s novel ''Dragon's Island'', published in 1951, although Williamson's imaginary virus was based on a [[bacteriophage]] rather than a mammalian virus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Jack|title=Dragon's Island and other stories|year=2002|publisher=Five Star|location=Waterville, Me.|isbn=0786243147}}</ref>  ''Dragon's Island'' is also known for being the source of the term "[[genetic engineering]]".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stableford|first=Brian M.|author-link=|title=Historical dictionary of science fiction literature|page=133|year=2004|isbn=9780810849389|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nzmIPZg5xicC&pg=PR9&dq=Jack+Williamson+Dragon%27s+Island+genetic+engineering&q|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

The plot of the Hollywood film ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' is based on the premise that a worldwide epidemic was caused by a viral cure for cancer.
