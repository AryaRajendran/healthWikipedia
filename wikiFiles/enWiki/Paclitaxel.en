'''Paclitaxel''' is a [[mitotic inhibitor]] used in [[cancer]] [[chemotherapy]]. It was discovered in a US [[National Cancer Institute]] program at the [[Research Triangle Institute]]  in 1967 when [[Monroe E. Wall]] and [[Mansukh C. Wani]] isolated it from the bark of the [[Pacific yew]] tree, ''[[Taxus brevifolia]]'' and named it '''taxol'''. Later it was discovered that [[endophytic]] fungi in the bark synthesize paclitaxel.

When it was developed commercially by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] (BMS), the generic name was changed to '''paclitaxel''' and the BMS compound is sold under the [[trademark]] '''Taxol'''. In this formulation, paclitaxel is dissolved in [[Cremophor EL]] and [[ethanol]], as a delivery agent.  A newer formulation, in which paclitaxel is bound to [[Human serum albumin|albumin]], is sold under the trademark ''[[Abraxane]]''.

Paclitaxel is used to treat patients with [[lung cancer|lung]], [[ovarian cancer|ovarian]], [[breast cancer|breast]], head and neck cancer, and advanced forms of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. Paclitaxel is also used for the prevention of [[Paclitaxel#Restenosis|restenosis]].

Paclitaxel stabilizes [[microtubules]] and as a result, interferes with the normal breakdown of  microtubules during cell division. Together with [[docetaxel]], it forms the drug category of the [[taxane]]s. It was the subject of a [[Paclitaxel total synthesis|notable total synthesis]] by [[Robert A. Holton]].

While offering substantial improvement in patient care, paclitaxel has been a relatively controversial drug. There was originally concern because of the environmental impact of its original sourcing (no longer used) from the Pacific yew. In addition, the assignment of rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb, and even the name itself, were the subject of public debate and Congressional hearings.

==History==

===The plant screening program, isolation, and preclinical trials===
In 1955, the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) in the United States set up the [[Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center]] (CCNSC) to act as a public screening center for anticancer activity in compounds submitted by external institutions and companies.<ref>{{cite book

Barclay]],  collected bark from a single Pacific yew tree, ''[[Taxus brevifolia]]'', in a forest north of the town of [[Packwood, Washington]] as part of a four month trip to collect material from over 200 different species.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh, p51">{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=51}}</ref> The material was then processed by a number of specialist CCNSC subcontractors, and one of the ''Taxus'' samples was found to be cytotoxic in a cellular assay on 22 May 1964.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh, p51"/>

Accordingly, in late 1964 or early 1965, the fractionation and isolation laboratory run by [[Monroe E. Wall]] in [[Research Triangle Park]], [[North Carolina]], began work on fresh ''Taxus'' samples,  isolating the active ingredient in September 1966 and announcing their findings at an April 1967 [[American Chemical Society]] meeting in Miami Beach.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7850785 |year=1995 |last1=Wall |first1=ME |last2=Wani |first2=MC |title=Camptothecin and taxol: Discovery to clinic--thirteenth Bruce F. Cain Memorial Award Lecture |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=753–60 |journal=Cancer Research}}</ref> They named the pure compound taxol in June 1967.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh, p51"/>
Wall and his colleague Wani published their results, including the chemical structure, in 1971.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wani M, Taylor H, Wall M, Coggon P, McPhail A | title = Plant antitumor agents. VI.

The NCI continued to commission work to collect more ''Taxus'' bark and to isolate increasing quantities of taxol. By 1969, 28&nbsp;kg of crude extract had been isolated from almost 1,200&nbsp;kg of bark, although this ultimately yielded only 10g of pure material,<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=81}}</ref> but for several years, no use was made of the compound by the NCI. In 1975, it was shown to be active in another ''in vitro'' system ; two years later a new department head reviewed the data and finally recommended taxol be moved on to the next stage in the discovery process.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=79,81}}</ref> This required increasing quantities of purified taxol, up to 600g, and in 1977 a further request for 7,000&nbsp;lbs of bark was made.

In 1978, two NCI researchers published a report showing taxol was mildly effective in leukaemic mice.<ref>
{{cite journal | author = Fuchs, David A and Johnson, Randall K | title = Cytologic evidence that taxol, an antineoplastic agent from ''Taxus brevifolia'', acts as a mitotic spindle poison | journal = Cancer Treatment Reports | volume = 62  | pages = 1219–22 | year = 1978 | pmid = 688258 | issue = 8  }}</ref>
In November 1978, taxol was shown to be effective in [[xenograft]] studies.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=95}}</ref>
Meanwhile, taxol began to be well known in the cell biology, as well as the cancer community, with a publication in early 1979 by [[Susan B. Horwitz]], a molecular pharmacologist at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]],  showing taxol had a previously unknown mechanism of action involving the stabilization of [[microtubules]]. Together with formulation problems, this increased interest from researchers meant that by 1980, the NCI envisaged needing to collect 20,000&nbsp;lbs of bark.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p97">{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=97}}</ref>
Animal toxicology studies were complete by June 1982, and in November NCI applied for the [[Investigational New Drug|IND]] necessary to begin clinical trials in humans.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p97"/>

===Early clinical trials, supply and the transfer to BMS===
[[phases of clinical research|Phase I]] clinical trials began in April 1984, and the decision to start [[phases of clinical research|Phase II]] trials was made a year later.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=115}}</ref> These larger trials needed more bark and collection of a further 12,000 pounds was commissioned, which enabled some phase II trials to begin by the end of 1986. But by then it was recognized that the demand for taxol might be substantial and that more than 60,000 pounds of bark might be needed as a minimum. This unprecedentedly large amount brought ecological concerns about the impact on yew populations into focus for the first time, as local politicians and foresters expressed unease at the program.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p120"/>

The first public report from a phase II trial in May 1988 showed an effect in melanoma patients and a remarkable response rate of 30% in patients with refractory ovarian cancer.<ref>
{{cite journal | author = Rowinsky, EK and others | title = Phase II study of taxol in advanced epithelial malignancies | journal =  Proceedings of the Association of Clinical Oncology | volume = 7  | pages = 136 | year = 1988  }}</ref>
At this point, Gordon Cragg of the NCI's Natural Product Branch calculated the synthesis of enough taxol to treat all the ovarian cancer and melanoma cases in the US would require the destruction of 360,000 trees annually. For the first time, serious consideration was given to the problem of supply.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p120"/>
Because of the practical and, in particular, the financial scale of the program needed, the NCI decided to seek association with a pharmaceutical company, and in August 1989, it published a [[Cooperative Research and Development Agreement]] (CRADA) offering its current stock and supply from current bark stocks, and proprietary access to the data so far collected, to a company willing to commit to providing the funds to collect further raw material, isolate taxol, and fund a large proportion of clinical trials. In the words of Goodman and Welsh, authors of a substantial scholarly book on taxol, <blockquote>
[The NCI] was thinking, not of collaboration, ... but of a hand-over of taxol (and its problems)
<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p120">{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=120}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Although the offer was widely advertised, only four companies responded to the CRADA, including the American firm [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] (BMS),
which was selected as the partner in December 1989. The choice of BMS later became controversial and was the subject of Congressional hearings in 1991 and 1992. While it seems clear the NCI had little choice but to seek a commercial partner, there was also controversy about the terms of the deal, eventually leading to a report by the [[General Accounting Office]] in 2003, which concluded the NIH had failed to ensure value for money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyden.senate.gov/leg_issues/reports/taxol.pdf|format=PDF|title=Technology Transfer: NIH-Private Sector Partnership in the Development of Taxol}}</ref> In related CRADAs with the [[USDA]] and [[Department of the Interior]],  Bristol-Myers Squibb was given exclusive first refusal on all Federal supplies of ''Taxus brevifolia''.
This exclusive contract lead to some criticism for giving BMS a "cancer [[monopoly]]".<ref name="monopoly">Nader, Ralph; Love, James. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n2_v57/ai_13417481 Looting the medicine chest: how Bristol-Myers Squibb made off with the public's cancer research]." ''[[The Progressive]].'' February, 1993. Retrieved on March 9, 2007.</ref>
Eighteen months after the CRADA, BMS  filed a [[new drug application]] (NDA), which was given FDA approval at the very end of 1992.
<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p120"/>
Although there was no patent on the compound, the provisions of the [[Waxman-Hatch Act]] gave Bristol-Myers Squibb five years exclusive marketing rights.

In 1990, BMS applied to trademark the name taxol as '''TAXOL'''. This was controversially approved in 1992. At the same time, paclitaxel replaced taxol as the generic name of the compound.  Critics, including the journal ''[[Nature]]'', argued the name taxol had been used for more than two decades and in more than 600 scientific articles and suggested the trademark should not have been awarded and the BMS should renounce its rights to it.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/373370a0 |title=Names for hi-jacking |year=1995 |journal=Nature |volume=373 |issue=6513 |pages=370 |pmid=7830775}}</ref> BMS argued changing the name would cause confusion among oncologists and possibly endanger the health of patients. BMS has continued to defend its rights to the name in the courts.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=170}}</ref>
BMS has also been criticized for misrepresentation by Goodman and Walsh, who quote from a company report saying 
<blockquote>
It was not until 1971 that ... testing ... enabled the isolation of paclitaxel, initially described as 'compound 17'<ref>Bristol-Myers Squibb, The development of TAXOL (paclitaxel), March 1997, as cited in {{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=2}}</ref>
</blockquote>
This quote is, strictly speaking, accurate: the objection seems to be that this misleadingly neglects to explain that it was the scientist doing the isolation who named the compound taxol and it was not referred to in any other way for more than twenty years.

Annual sales peaked in 2000, reaching [[US$]]1.6 billion; paclitaxel is now available in generic form.

==Production==
{{see also|Paclitaxel total synthesis}}
[[Image:PacificYew 8566.jpg|thumb|right|Undisturbed Pacific yew bark contains paclitaxel and related chemicals.]]
[[Image:Yew bark Taxol PD.jpg|thumbnail|right|The bark is peeled and processed to provide paclitaxel.]]

From 1967 to 1993, almost all paclitaxel produced was derived from bark from the Pacific yew, the harvesting of which kills the tree in the process. The processes used were descendants of the original isolation method of Wall and Wani; by 1987, the NCI had contracted [[Hauser Chemical Research]] of Boulder, Colorado, to handle bark on the scale needed for Phase II and III trials. While there was considerable uncertainty about how large the wild population of ''Taxus brevifola'' was and what the eventual demand for taxol would be, it had been clear for many years that an alternative, sustainable source of supply would be needed. Initial attempts used needles from the tree, or material from other related ''Taxus'' species, including cultivated ones, but these attempts were bedevilled by the relatively low and often highly variable yields obtained. It was not until the early 1990s, at a time of increased sensitivity to the ecology of the forests of the [[Pacific Northwest]], that taxol was successfully extracted on a clinically useful scale from these sources.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=172–5}}</ref>

From the late 1970s, chemists in the US and France had been interested in taxol. A number of US groups, including one led by [[Robert A. Holton]], attempted a [[Paclitaxel total synthesis|total synthesis of the molecule]], starting from [[petrochemical]]-derived starting materials. This work was primarily motivated as a way of generating chemical knowledge, rather than with any expectation of developing a practical production technique. By contrast, the French group of [[Pierre Potier]] at the [[CNRS]] quickly recognized the problem of yield. His laboratory was on a campus populated by the related yew ''Taxus baccata'', so needles were available locally in large quantity. By 1981, he had shown that it was feasible to isolate relatively large quantities of the compound [[10-deacetylbaccatin]], a plausible first step for a semisynthetic production route to taxol. By 1988 he copublished such a semisynthetic route from needles of ''T. baccata''.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=100–1}}</ref>
The view of the NCI, however, was even this route was not practical.<ref name="Stephenson_2003">{{cite journal|title=A tale of taxol|author=Stephenson, Frank|journal=Florida State University Research in Review|volume=12|issue=3|date=Fall|year=2003|url=http://www.rinr.fsu.edu/fall2002/taxol.html}}</ref>

By 1988, and particularly with Potier's publication, it was clear to Holton as well a practical semisynthetic production route would be important. By late 1989, Holton's group had developed a semisynthetic route to paclitaxel with twice the yield of the Potier process. [[Florida State University]], where Holton worked, signed a deal with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] to license this and future patents. In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield.  BMS took the process in-house and started to manufacture paclitaxel in Ireland from 10-deacetylbaccatin isolated from the needles of the European yew.<ref name="Stephenson_2003"/> In early 1993, BMS was able to announce that it would cease reliance on Pacific yew bark by the end of 1995, effectively terminating the ecological controversy over its use. This announcement also made good their commitment to develop an alternative supply route, made to the NCI in their CRADA application of 1989.

Another group, led by K.C. Nicolaou of the Scripps Research Institute, announced the complete synthesis of paclitaxel at the same time (in February 1994) as Holton's group at Florida State University. Holton argued that his technique was superior to Nicolaou because of the higher yield, whereas Nicolaou said that their yields would be similar if Holton had calculated the yield at every step instead of at an intermediate point of his synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flam|first=Faye|title=Race to synthesize Taxol ends in a tie|journal=Science|date=18 Feb 1994|year=1994|month=February|volume=263|pages=911}}</ref>    

Currently, all paclitaxel production for BMS uses plant cell fermentation (PCF) technology developed by the Ithaca, New York biotechnology company [[Phyton Biotech|Phyton Biotech, Inc]] and carried out at their plant in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phyton news release|url=http://www.phytonbiotech.com/news_031215.htm}}</ref> PCF uses a specific ''Taxus'' cell line propagated in aqueous medium in large fermentation tanks with the endophytic fungus ''Penicillium raistrickii''. Paclitaxel is then extracted directly, purified by chromatography and isolated by crystallization.  Compared to the semisynthesis, PCF eliminates the need for many hazardous chemicals and saves a considerable amount of energy.<ref name="2004_EPA_award">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenchemistry/pubs/pgcc/winners/gspa04.html|title= 2004 Greener Synthetic Pathways Award: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company: Development of a Green Synthesis for TAXOL Manufacture via Plant Cell Fermentation and Extraction}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Tubulin&paclitaxel-2HXF.png|thumb|left|250px|Complex of α, β tubulin subunits and paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is showed as yellow stick.]]
Paclitaxel is one of several [[cytoskeletal drugs]] that target tubulin. Paclitaxel-treated cells have defects in mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cell division. Unlike other tubulin-targeting drugs such as [[colchicine]] that inhibit microtubule assembly, paclitaxel stabilizes the [[microtubule]] polymer and protects it from disassembly. Chromosomes are thus unable to achieve a metaphase spindle configuration.  This blocks progression of mitosis, and prolonged activation of the mitotic checkpoint triggers apoptosis or reversion to the G-phase of the cell cycle without cell division.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1207374 |title=The spindle checkpoint, aneuploidy, and cancer |year=2004 |last1=Bharadwaj |first1=Rajnish |last2=Yu |first2=Hongtao |journal=Oncogene |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=2016–27 |pmid=15021889}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.200805072 |title=Microtubules do not promote mitotic slippage ''when the'' spindle assembly checkpoint cannot be satisfied |year=2008 |last1=Brito |first1=D.

The ability of paclitaxel to inhibit spindle function is generally attributed to its suppression of microtubule dynamics,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15057285 |year=2004 |last1=Jordan |first1=MA |last2=Wilson |first2=L |title=Microtubules as a target for anticancer drugs |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=253–65 |doi=10.1038/nrc1317 |journal=Nature reviews. Cancer}}</ref> but recent studies have demonstrated that suppression of dynamics occurs at concentrations lower than those needed to block mitosis. At the higher therapeutic concentrations, paclitaxel appears to suppress microtubule detachment from centrosomes, a process normally activated during mitosis.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20978163 |year=2010 |last1=Ganguly |first1=A |last2=Yang |first2=H |last3=Cabral |first3=F |title=Paclitaxel-dependent cell lines reveal a novel drug activity |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2914–23 |doi=10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0552 |pmc=2978777 |journal=Molecular cancer therapeutics}}</ref> The binding site for paclitaxel has been identified on the beta-tubulin subunit.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jmbi.2001.5077 |title=Refined structure of $alpha;$beta;-tubulin at 3.5 p resolution1 |year=2001 |last1=Lowe |first1=J |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=313 |issue=5 |pages=1045–57 |pmid=11700061 |last2=Li |first2=H |last3=Downing |first3=KH |last4=Nogales |first4=E}}</ref>

In September 2001, NICE recommended paclitaxel should be available for the treatment of advanced breast cancer after the failure of anthracyclic chemotherapy, but that its first-line use should be limited to clinical trials. In September 2006, NICE recommended paclitaxel should ''not'' be used in the adjuvant treatment of early node-positive breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnf.org/bnf/bnf/current/21850.htm|title=British National Formulary}}</ref>

The cost to the NHS per patient in early breast cancer, assuming four cycles of treatment, is about £4000 (approx. $6000).<ref>{{cite web|title=NICE Guidance TA108|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA108/guidance/pdf/English}}</ref>

===Similar compounds===

[[Human serum albumin|Albumin]]-bound paclitaxel (trade name Abraxane, also called nab-paclitaxel) is an alternative formulation where paclitaxel is bound to albumin nano-particles. Much of the clinical toxicity of paclitaxel is associated with the solvent [[Cremophor EL]] in which it is dissolved for delivery.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
[[Abraxis BioScience]] developed [[Abraxane]], in which paclitaxel is bonded to [[Human serum albumin|albumin]] as an alternative delivery agent to the often toxic solvent delivery method. This was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] in January 2005 for the treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy.<ref name="Abraxane">"[http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/021660lbl.pdf Abraxane Drug Information]."

Synthetic approaches to paclitaxel production led to the development of [[docetaxel]]. Docetaxel has a similar set of clinical uses to paclitaxel and is marketed under the name of Taxotere.

Recently the presence of [[taxane]]s including paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, paclitaxel C, and 7-epipaclitaxel in the shells and leaves of [[hazel]] plants has been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/np0704046 |title=Taxanes from Shells and Leaves ofCorylus avellana |year=2008 |last1=Ottaggio |first1=Laura |last2=Bestoso |first2=Federica |last3=Armirotti |first3=Andrea |last4=Balbi |first4=Alessandro |last5=Damonte |first5=Gianluca |last6=Mazzei |first6=Mauro |last7=Sancandi |first7=Monica |last8=Miele |first8=Mariangela |journal=Journal of Natural Products |volume=71 |pages=58–60 |pmid=18163585 |issue=1}}</ref> The finding of these compounds in shells, which are considered discarded material and are mass-produced by many food industries, is of interest for the future availability of paclitaxel.

===Restenosis===
Paclitaxel is used as an [[anti-proliferative agent|antiproliferative agent]] for the prevention of [[restenosis]] (recurrent narrowing) of coronary [[stent]]s; locally delivered to the wall of the [[coronary artery]], a paclitaxel coating limits the growth of [[neointima]] (scar tissue) within stents.<ref name=Heldman>{{cite journal |pmid=11342479 |year=2001 |last1=Heldman |first1=AW |last2=Cheng |first2=L |last3=Jenkins |first3=GM |last4=Heller |first4=PF |last5=Kim |first5=DW |last6=Ware Jr |first6=M |last7=Nater |first7=C |last8=Hruban |first8=RH |last9=Rezai |first9=B |title=Paclitaxel stent coating inhibits neointimal hyperplasia at 4 weeks in a porcine model of coronary restenosis |volume=103 |issue=18 |pages=2289–95 |journal=Circulation}}</ref>  Paclitaxel [[drug-eluting stent|drug eluting coated stents]] are sold under the trade name Taxus by [[Boston Scientific]] in the United States.

===Side effects===

Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, change in taste, thinned or brittle hair, pain in the joints of the arms or legs lasting two to three days, changes in the color of the nails, and tingling in the hands or toes. More serious side effects such as unusual bruising or bleeding, pain/redness/swelling at the injection site, change in normal bowel habits for more than two days, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, shortness of breath, severe exhaustion, skin rash, facial flushing, [[female infertility]] by ovarian damage<ref name=Ozcelik>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.054 |title=Prevention of paclitaxel and cisplatin induced ovarian damage in rats by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist |year=2010 |last1=Ozcelik |first1=Bulent |last2=Turkyilmaz |first2=Cagdas |last3=Ozgun |first3=Mahmut Tuncay |last4=Serin |first4=Ibrahim Serdar |last5=Batukan |first5=Cem |last6=Ozdamar |first6=Saim |last7=Ozturk |first7=Ahmet |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1609–14 |pmid=19339002}}</ref> and chest pain can also occur. A number of these side effects are associated with the [[excipient]] used, Cremophor EL, a polyoxyethylated [[castor oil]].

===Derivatives of paclitaxel===

In recent years, extensive research has been done to find a way to mitigate the side effects of paclitaxel, by altering its administration. DHA-paclitaxel, PG-paclitaxel, and tumor-activated Taxol prodrugs are undergoing continued testing, and are actually on the way to being introduced into widespread clinical use.

Protarga has linked paclitaxel to [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), a fatty acid easily taken up by tumor cells; the [[DHA-paclitaxel]] “appears not to be cytotoxic until the bond with DHA is cleaved within the cell.”<ref name="Whelan 2002, Pages 90">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1359-6446(01)02149-3 |title=Targeted taxane therapy for cancer |year=2002 |last1=Whelan |first1=Jo |journal=Drug Discovery Today |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=90–2 |pmid=11790612}}</ref> The advantage of DHA-paclitaxel over paclitaxel is DHA-paclitaxel’s ability to carry much higher concentrations of paclitaxel to the cells, which are maintained for longer periods in the tumor cells, thus increasing their action. With increased activity, DHA-paclitaxel, also known as Taxoprexin, may have a more successful response in cancer patients than paclitaxel, and it may be able to treat more types of cancer than paclitaxel has been able to treat.

Cell Therapeutics has formulated PG-paclitaxel, which is paclitaxel bonded to a polyglutamate polymer; tumor cells are significantly more porous to polyglutamate polymers than normal cells, due to the leaky endothelial membranes of tumor cells. PG-paclitaxel has been introduced into clinical use, and has proven to initiate very mild side effects and to effectively treat many patients who were not responsive to the action of Taxol. The PG-paclitaxel may be a very promising anticancer drug, as it is much more selective than paclitaxel for which cells it targets.<ref name="Whelan 2002, Pages 90"/>

ImmunoGen has been introducing tumor-activated prodrug (TAP) technology in recent years, and is now working to apply this technology to paclitaxel. Tumor-activated Taxol prodrugs are designed for accurate targeting, by the action of a monoclonal antibody which is very specific to certain cells. Tumor-activated Taxol prodrugs research is progressing, and in mice, the “taxane-based TAP completely eradicated human tumour xenografts at non-toxic doses.”<ref name="Whelan 2002, Pages 90"/>

[[ANG1005]] is made up of one molecule of a peptide called angiopep-2 joined with three molecules of paclitaxel.  It is in phase I clinical trials for some types of cancer.

==Research use==
Aside from its direct clinical use, paclitaxel is used extensively in biological and biomedical research as a [[microtubule]] stabilizer.  [[In vitro]] assays involving microtubules, such as [[motility assay]]s, generally rely on paclitaxel to maintain microtubule integrity in the absence of the various nucleating factors and other stabilizing elements found in the cell.  For example, it is used for in vitro tests of drugs that aim to alter the behavior of microtubule [[motor proteins]], or for studies of mutant motor proteins.  Paclitaxel is sometimes used for [[in vivo]] studies as well; it can be fed to test organisms, such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], or injected into individual cells, to inhibit microtubule disassembly or to increase the number of microtubules in the cell.  Paclitaxel induces remyelination in a demyelinating mouse in vivo<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11990870 |year=2002 |last1=Moscarello |first1=MA |last2=Mak |first2=B |last3=Nguyen |first3=TA |last4=Wood |first4=DD |last5=Mastronardi |first5=F |last6=Ludwin |first6=SK |title=Paclitaxel (Taxol) attenuates clinical disease ''in a'' spontaneously demyelinating transgenic mouse and induces remyelination |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=130–8 |journal=Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)}}</ref> and inhibits hPAD2 in vitro though its methyl ester side chain did not.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18923545 |year=2008 |last1=Musse |first1=AA |last2=Polverini |first2=E |last3=Raijmakers |first3=R |last4=Harauz |first4=G |title=Kinetics of human peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (hPAD2)--reduction of Ca2+ dependence by phospholipids and assessment of proposed inhibition by paclitaxel side chains |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=437–47 |doi=10.1139/o08-124 |journal=Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire}}</ref>  Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc. began phase II clinical trials in 1999<ref>MS Society of Canada [http://mssociety.ca/en/research/PT991213.htm Phase II Clinical trial of Micellar Paclitaxel for secondary-progressive MS underway in Canada]</ref> as a multiple sclerosis treatment but in 2002, reported that the results showed no statistical significance.<ref>MS Society of Canada [http://mssociety.ca/en/research/PT020227.htm Angiotech Halts Study of Micellar Paclitaxel stating no benefit of statistical significance seen]</ref>
