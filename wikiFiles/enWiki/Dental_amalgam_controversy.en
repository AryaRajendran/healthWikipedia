[[File:Amalgam.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Dental amalgam filling]]

The '''dental amalgam controversy''' refers to the conflicting views over the use of [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] as a [[dental filling|filling]] [[dental restorative material|material]] mainly because it contains the element [[mercury (element)|mercury]].  Scientists agree that dental amalgam fillings leach mercury into the mouth, but studies vary widely in the amount and whether such amount presents significant health risks. Estimations run from 1-3&nbsp; [[microgram]]s (µg) per day (FDA) up to 27&nbsp;µg/day (Patterson).<ref>{{cite press release |title=Dental Amalgam: Myths vs. Facts |publisher=[[American Dental Association]] |month=July |year=2002 |url=http://www.ada.org/public/media/releases/0207_release01.asp |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Stephen M. |last=Koral |title=The Scientific Case Against Amalgam |url=http://www.iaomt.org/articles/files/files193/The%20Case%20Against%20Amalgam.pdf |publisher=[[International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology]] |year=2005 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref> The effects of that amount of exposure are also disputed,.<ref name=LSRO2004/><ref name=Mutter2005/> The use of mercury in dental fillings is approved in most countries.

The development of composite is by far more related to patients' demand for tooth colored restorations for aesthetic concerns rather than for fears over the mercury content of the metal.

In addition to health and ethics issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings point to the negative [[externality|externalities]] of water contamination and environmental damage of mercury. This concern is especially worrisome since its use and disposal by dentists go largely unregulated in many places, including the United States.<ref name=USregulation>{{cite journal |pmid=17586144 |doi=10.1016/j.cden.2007.04.004 |year=2007 |last1=Mitchell |first1=RJ |last2=Koike |first2=M |last3=Okabe |first3=T |title=Posterior amalgam restorations--usage, regulation, and longevity |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=573–89, v |journal=Dental clinics of North America}}</ref> The WHO reports that mercury from amalgam and laboratory devices accounts for 53% of total mercury emissions.<ref name=WHOwaste/> Separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, where dental amalgams contribute one-third of the mercury waste,<ref name=WHOwaste/> but they are not required by some states in the United States.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite journal |pmid=12956345 |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12956345 |journal=The Journal of the American Dental Association |title=Purchasing, installing and operating dental amalgam separators: Practical issues |volume=134 |issue=8 |pages=1054–65 |author=MCMANUS, KEVIN R. |last2=F |first2=P |year=2003}}</ref>

== Ethics and awareness ==
A 2006 [[Zogby International]] poll of 2,590 US adults found that 72% of respondents were not aware that mercury was a main component of dental amalgam and 92% of respondents would prefer to be told about mercury in dental amalgam before receiving it as a filling.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Patients Don’t Know: Dentists' Sweet Tooth for Mercury |url=http://mpp.cclearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/whatpatientsdontknow1.pdf |publisher=[[Mercury Policy Project]] |date=14 February 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref> A 1993 study published in FDA Consumer found that 50% of Americans believed fillings containing mercury caused health problems.<ref name=bradbard1993>{{cite journal |first=Laura |last=Bradbard |month=December |year=1993 |title=Dental Amalgam: Filling a Need or Foiling Health? |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n10_v27/ai_14891423/ |journal=FDA Consumer |volume=27 |pages=22 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref> Some dentists (including a member of the FDA's Dental Products Panel) suggest that there is an obligation to [[informed consent|inform]] patients that amalgam contains mercury.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael D. |last=Fleming |date=16 February 2007 |title=Silver-mercury amalgam disclosure and informed consent |url=http://www.dentaleconomics.com/articles/article_display.html?id=284909 |journal=Dental Economics |volume=97 |issue=2 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=Chirba-Martin>Chirba-Martin, Welshhans.

The broad lack of knowledge that existed among the public was displayed when a December 1990 episode of the CBS news program "60 Minutes" covered mercury in amalgam. This resulted in a nationwide amalgam scare and additional research into mercury release from amalgam.  The following month ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' published an article criticizing the content of the broadcast, stating that it contained a great deal of false information and that the ADA spokesperson on the program was ill prepared to defend the claims.{{clarify|date=December 2011}}<ref>The mercury in your mouth: You can avoid amalgam fillings or even replace the ones you have, but should you?

==Exposure==

The amount of mercury patients are subjected to is itself controversial. Many studies have been conducted and findings have varied substantially. Depending on the study, average systemic uptake levels have been estimated to range between 1.7&nbsp;µg/day and 17&nbsp;µg/day.<ref>SKARE, I. & ENGQVIST, A. Human exposure to mercury and silver released from dental 
amalgam restorations. Archives of environmental health, 49: 384–394 (1994). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7944571</ref><ref>World Health Organization, Air Quality Guidelines, 2nd Edition, Chapter 6.9, pgs 3-4; http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/123079/AQG2ndEd_6_9Mercury.PDF retrieved: 31/10/2011.</ref>

As a (straight) comparison, these daily absorption levels comprise between 3.4% and 68% of workplace air quality safety standards (which range from 25 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air).<ref>Based on  1.7µg over 50 µg/m<sup>3</sup> (low average) and 17µg over 25 µg/m<sup>3</sup> (high average).

Critics point out that: (1) the workplace safety standards are based on allowable maxima in the workplace, not mercury [[Biomonitoring|body burden]]; (2) the workplace safety numbers are not applicable to continuous 24hr exposure, they're limited to a normal work day and 40 hr work-week;<ref name="osha.gov">Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Mercury, OSHA, US Department of Labor http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/mercuryvapor/recognition.html</ref> and (3) the uptake/absorption numbers are averages and not worst case patients (those most at risk).<ref name="oem.bmj.com">L.

A study conducted by measuring the intraoral vapor levels over a 24-hour period in patients with at least nine amalgam restorations showed the average daily dose of inhaled mercury vapor was 1.7&nbsp;µg (range from 0.4 to 4.4&nbsp;µg), which is approximately only 3.4% of the threshold limit value of the OSHA maximum allowable environmental level of 50&nbsp;µg/day in the workplace.<ref name="osha.gov"/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2212208 |doi=10.1177/00220345900690100401 |year=1990 |last1=Berglund |first1=A |title=Estimation by a 24-hour study of the daily dose of intra-oral mercury vapor inhaled after release from dental amalgam |volume=69 |issue=10 |pages=1646–51 |journal=Journal of dental research}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) notes that exposure can be greatly increased by personal habits such as [[bruxism]] and gum-chewing and cites a report which found a 5.3 fold increase in mercury levels after chewing, eating, or toothbrushing. They report that amalgam is estimated to contribute 50% of mercury exposure in adults. In the studies the WHO reviews, daily mercury exposure estimates range from 3 μg/day to 9 μg/day.<ref name=WHOCICAD>WHO.

A Swedish study of autopsies examined the mercury levels in brains and kidneys and found a strong correlation with the number of amalgam fillings.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3481133 |year=1987 |last1=Nylander |first1=M |last2=Friberg |first2=L |last3=Lind |first3=B |title=Mercury concentrations in the human brain and kidneys in relation to exposure from dental amalgam fillings |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=179–87 |journal=Swedish dental journal}}</ref> A German study found that mercury urinary excretion was significantly higher in those with dental amalgam fillings.<ref name=Zander>{{cite journal |pmid=2080964 |year=1990 |last1=Zander |first1=D |last2=Ewers |first2=U |last3=Freier |first3=I |last4=Westerweller |first4=S |last5=Jermann |first5=E |last6=Brockhaus |first6=A |volume=190 |issue=4 |pages=325–34 |language=German |trans_title=Exposure to mercury in the population.

The NIDR Amalgam Study performed on a cohort of an adult military population of 1127 healthy males found that, based on their cross-sectional data it is estimated that, on average, each ten-surface increase in amalgam exposure is associated with an increase of 1&nbsp;ug/L mercury in urine concentration.

Research on monkeys has shown that mercury released from dental amalgam restorations is absorbed and accumulates in various organs such as the kidney, brain, lung, liver, gastro-intestinal tract, the exocrine glands.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2227216 |year=1990 |last1=Hahn |first1=LJ |last2=Kloiber |first2=R |last3=Leininger |first3=RW |last4=Vimy |first4=MJ |last5=Lorscheider |first5=FL |title=Whole-body imaging of the distribution of mercury released from dental fillings into monkey tissues |volume=4 |issue=14 |pages=3256–60 |journal=The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology}}</ref> It was also found to have crossed the placental barrier in pregnant rats<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12505442 |doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00588-7 |year=2003 |last1=Takahashi |first1=Y |last2=Tsuruta |first2=S |last3=Arimoto |first3=M |last4=Tanaka |first4=H |last5=Yoshida |first5=M |title=Placental transfer of mercury in pregnant rats which received dental amalgam restorations |volume=185 |issue=1–2 |pages=23–33 |journal=Toxicology}}</ref> and shown to cross the gastrointestinal mucosa when amalgam particles are swallowed after amalgam insertion or after removal of old amalgam fillings.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6573763 |year=1983 |last1=Brune |first1=D |last2=Gjerdet |first2=N |last3=Paulsen |first3=G |title=Gastrointestinal and in vitro release of copper, cadmium, indium, mercury and zinc from conventional and copper-rich amalgams |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=66–71 |journal=Scandinavian journal of dental research}}</ref>

==Health effects==
Peer-reviewed scientific studies have come to opposite conclusions on whether the mercury exposure from amalgam fillings causes health problems. A 2004 [[systematic review]] conducted by the [[Life Sciences Research Office]], whose clients include the FDA and NIH, concluded that "the current data are insufficient to support an association between mercury release from dental amalgam and the various complaints that have been attributed to this restoration material".<ref name=LSRO2004>{{cite web |title=Review and Analysis of the Literature on the Health Effects of Dental Amalgams |url=http://www.lsro.org/presentation_files/amalgam/amalgam_execsum.pdf |publisher=[[Life Sciences Research Office]] |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref> A peer-reviewed ''Journal of the Canadian Dental Association'' article holds that "it seems likely that humans may have evolved with a threshold level for mercury below which there is no response or observable adverse health effects".<ref name="JCDA Jones">{{cite journal | title = Exposure or Absorption and the Crucial Question of Limits for Mercury | journal = Journal of the Canadian Dental Association | date = Jan. 1999 | first = Derek W. | last = Jones | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–46 | url = http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-65/issue-1/42.html | accessdate = 2010-06-01 | quote = Given the epidemiological evidence we have, it seems likely that humans may have evolved with a threshold level for mercury below which there is no response or observable adverse health effects. | pmid = 9973766}}</ref> Another review published in 2005 by the [[Freiburg University]] Institute for Environmental Medicine found that "mercury from dental amalgam may lead to [[nephrotoxicity]], neurobehavioural changes, [[autoimmunity]], oxidative stress, [[autism]], skin and mucosa alterations or non-specific symptoms and complaints", that "[[Alzheimer's disease]] or [[multiple sclerosis]] has also been linked to low-dose mercury exposure", and that "removal of dental amalgam leads to permanent improvement of various chronic complaints in a relevant number of patients in various trials."<ref name=Mutter2005>{{cite journal |pmid=15789284 |doi=10.1055/s-2005-857962 |year=2005 |last1=Mutter |first1=J |last2=Naumann |first2=J |last3=Walach |first3=H |last4=Daschner |first4=F |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=204–16 |language=German |trans_title=Amalgam risk assessment with coverage of references up to 2005 |journal=Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)) |title=Amalgam: Eine Risikobewertung unter Berücksichtigung der neuen Literatur bis 2005}}</ref>

Potential amalgam-induced health risks which have been studied by researchers include those related to allergy as well as toxicity. In 2002, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a statement on dental amalgam which asserted that "no valid scientific evidence has shown that amalgams cause harm to patients with dental restorations, except in the rare case of allergy".<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/consumer/amalgams2002.html Consumer Update: Dental Amalgams]</ref> A 1991-1997 study of 3162 patients in Sweden and Germany found that 719 of those with mercury fillings, or 23 percent, tested positive for systemic allergic sensitivity to inorganic mercury on the MELISA lymphocyte proliferation test.<ref name=melisabiomark2>[http://www.melisa.org/pdf/biomark2.pdf Metal-Specific Lymphocytes: Biomarkers of Sensitivity in Man]</ref> In a smaller group of 85 patients who suffered from symptoms resembling [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]] and had their amalgams replaced with composites and metal-free ceramics, "over 78 percent reported improvement in health status as compared to the period prior to metal removal."<ref name=melisabiomark2/> A paper published as part of a 1991 [[National Institutes of Health]] conference on side-effects of dental restorative materials reported a 22.53% incidence of allergy in subjects who had amalgam fillings for more than five years.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/08959374920060010601 |pmid=1292453 |url=http://adr.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1292453 |journal=Advances in Dental Research |title=Documented Clinical Side-Effects to Dental Amalgam |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=131–4 |author=Ziff, M.F. |year=1992}}</ref> Despite these findings, the ADA claimed as recently as 2004 that there had been less than 100 reported cases of allergic reactions to amalgam fillings.<ref name=Chirba-Martin/>

The [[FDI World Dental Federation]] performed a meta-analysis of the literature on mercury toxicity and concluded that there is no documented scientific evidence to show adverse effects from mercury in amalgam restorations except in extremely rare cases of mercury hypersensitivity.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2793221 |year=1989 |title=Safety of dental amalgam. Fédération Dentaire Internationale Technical Report 33 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=217 |journal=International dental journal}}</ref>

In 2001, the United States [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] of 31,000 adult [[United States|Americans]], NHANES III, covering 1988-94, was published by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] (NCHS). It is [[statistically]] valid for all 180,000,000 adult Americans. The survey found that the number of [[dental fillings]] was significantly [[correlated]] to incidence of cancer, thyroid conditions, mental conditions, diseases of the nervous system including MS, diseases of the respiratory and genito-urinary systems, and disorders of the eye, circulatory and respiratory systems. At the time of the survey (1988–94), the vast majority of dental fillings placed were silver amalgam.<ref>NHANES III Screening – 35,000 Americans, www.flcv.com/NHANES3.html</ref> However, the United States FDA, various supreme court judges and others have determined that [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation does not sufficiently demonstrate causation]].

Ten years earlier, unrelated to NHANES III and before the NHANES/Dental Filling correlations, in 1991 the United States Food and Drug Administration concluded that "none of the data presented show a direct hazard to humans from dental amalgams."<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1918687 |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/abstract/122/8/62 |journal=The Journal of the American Dental Association |title=Amalgam hazards. An assessment of research |volume=122 |issue=8 |pages=62–5 |author=Mandel, ID |year=1991}}</ref> The Food and Drug Administration in 2008 subsequently issued an advisory warning pregnant women and children about dental amalgam containing mercury, and posted this warning on their website. Again unrelated to NHANES III, on February 18, 2003, the New York Supreme Court dismissed two amalgam-related lawsuits against organized dentistry, stating the plaintiffs had "failed to show a 'cognizable cause of action'." The plaintiffs blamed the ADA, the New York Dental Association and the Fifth District Dental Society for deceiving the "public about health risks allegedly associated with dental amalgam."<ref>Berry J, Lawsuits dismissed: Amalgam rulings are tripartite victory. ADA News 34:3, 23, 2004</ref>

A 2003 monograph on mercury toxicity from the [[World Health Organization]] concluded that:<ref name=WHOCICAD/>
* Studies on humans and animals have demonstrated that dental amalgam contributes significantly to mercury body burden in humans with amalgam fillings.
* Dental amalgam is the most common form of exposure to elemental mercury in the general population, constituting a potentially significant source of exposure to elemental mercury, with estimates of daily intake from amalgam restorations ranging from 1 to 12.5&nbsp;μg/day, the majority of dental amalgam holders being exposed to less than 5&nbsp;μg mercury/day.
* Intestinal absorption varies greatly among the various forms of mercury, with elemental mercury (as found in amalgam) being the least absorbed form (<0.01%)
* Absorption also varies according to individual factors such as gum chewing and bruxism (tooth grinding).
* The number of restorations - amalgam or otherwise - is declining, largely due to improved [[oral hygiene|dental hygiene]], in all industrialised countries examined declining by 38% since the 1970s in the USA and over 65% in the ten years from 1986 in the UK
* Although several studies have demonstrated that some mercury from amalgam fillings is absorbed, no relationship was observed between the mercury release from amalgam fillings and the mercury concentration in basal brain.
* However, in the same report it was concluded that "...even at very low mercury levels, subtle changes in visual system function can be measured."
* In [[multiple sclerosis]] patients with amalgam fillings, red blood cells, [[haemoglobin]], [[hematocrit]], [[thyroxine]] (T4), [[T-lymphocytes]] and T-8 (CD8) suppressors cells levels are significantly lower, while blood [[urea]] nitrogen and hair mercury levels are significantly higher.
* The report also notes that regarding elemental mercury exposure, the main form of exposure from dental amalgam,''" most studies rely on assessment of exposure at the time of study, which may not be fully informative, as mercury has a long half-life in the body and thus accumulates in continuous exposure ",'' making the evaluation of effects on health uncertain.

Other lesser findings were reported, including a cross-sectional study in which cognitive function was not related to the number or surface area of occlusal dental amalgams, a [[case-control]] study in which patients with numerous amalgam fillings exhibited higher levels of neurological symptoms than the controls, and a study of self-referred patients who believed they were suffering ill-effects from dental amalgams which found no correlation between number of dental fillings and symptomatology, but higher mean neuroticism than two comparison groups (the authors concluded that self-referred patients with health complaints attributed to dental amalgam are a heterogeneous group of patients who suffer multiple symptoms and frequently have mental disorders).

===Maths Berlin - overview and assessment of the scientific literature published between November 1997-2002===
In 2002, Maths Berlin, Professor Emeritus of Environmental Medicine and Chair of the 1991 World Health Organization Task Group on Environmental Health Criteria for Inorganic Mercury, published an overview and assessment of the scientific literature published between November 1997 – 2002 as part of a special investigation for the Swedish Government on amalgam related health issues.

===Clinical trials===

====Conducted trials and their conclusions====
The proper interpretation of the data on hand is, to date, controversial. The vast majority of past studies have concluded, not without controversy, that amalgams are safe. However, although the vast majority of patients with amalgam fillings are exposed to levels too low to pose a risk to health, many patients (i.e. those in the upper 99.9 percentile) exhibit urine test results which are comparable to the maximum allowable legal limits for long-term work place (occupational) safety.<ref name="osha.gov"/><ref name="oem.bmj.com"/><ref>Diana Echeverria, et al.

Currently, EPA has set the "safe" mercury exposure level to be at 5.8&nbsp;μg of mercury per one liter of blood.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/mercury/exposure.htm#meth Human Exposure - Methylmercury exposure]</ref> While mercury fillings themselves do not increase mercury levels above "safe" levels, they have been shown to contribute to such increase. However, such studies were unable to find any negative neurobehavioral effects.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16622139 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.15.1775 |year=2006 |last1=Bellinger |first1=DC |last2=Trachtenberg |first2=F |last3=Barregard |first3=L |last4=Tavares |first4=M |last5=Cernichiari |first5=E |last6=Daniel |first6=D |last7=McKinlay |first7=S |title=Neuropsychological and renal effects of dental amalgam in children: a randomized clinical trial |volume=295 |issue=15 |pages=1775–83 |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16622140 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.15.1784 |year=2006 |last1=Derouen |first1=TA |last2=Martin |first2=MD |last3=Leroux |first3=BG |last4=Townes |first4=BD |last5=Woods |first5=JS |last6=Leitão |first6=J |last7=Castro-caldas |first7=A |last8=Luis |first8=H |last9=Bernardo |first9=M |title=Neurobehavioral effects of dental amalgam in children: a randomized clinical trial |volume=295 |issue=15 |pages=1784–92 |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/about.htm| title=Basic Information on Mercury |publisher=EPA |year=2006 |accessdate=23 December 2006}}</ref>

During the FDA's December 13–14, 2010 CDRH panel review of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology's request for reconsideration to the classification of amalgam, neurologists questioned the type of neurobehavorial tests and the unethical nature of a prospective trial looking for brain damage in children. Furthermore, evidence was presented by the Geier's that further analysis of the data found that an unusual porphyrin called Coproporphyrinogen indicative of pathophysiology (harm) was found in a dose response relationship to the number and size of amalgams placed, thus calling into question the claim that no injury had occurred. 

As a result of a lawsuit, a fund was developed to research amalgam-related illness, and a clinical trial evaluating the effect of removing amalgam was published in 2008.<ref name=Melchart2008>{{cite journal |author=Melchart D, Vogt S, Köhler W, ''et al.'' |title=Treatment of health complaints attributed to amalgam |journal=J.

===Various positions on the subject===

====American Dental Association (ADA)====
The [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) has asserted that dental amalgam is safe since its foundation in 1859. In its advisory opinion to Rule 5.A. of the ADA Code of Ethics, it has also held that, "the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical".<ref>[http://www.ada.org/sections/about/pdfs/code_of_ethics_2012.pdf ADA PRINCIPLES OF ETHICS AND CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT]</ref>  According to the Boston College Law School study, "A dentist who is found guilty of violating the ADA Code of Ethics can be sentenced, censured, suspended, or expelled from the ADA" and the "ADA forbids its dentists from suggesting mercury removal under threat of license suspension".<ref name=Chirba-Martin/> The same study pointed out that state dental associations and disciplinary boards have "not only adopted the ADA's position as a matter of routine" in proceedings which have sanctioned anti-amalgam dentists or stripped them of their licenses in California, Maryland, Arizona, Colorado, and Minnesota, but in many cases "the board members themselves often belonged to the ADA as well".<ref name=Chirba-Martin/>  A 2002 article in the [[Atlanta Journal and Constitution]] reported allegations by anti-amalgamists that the ADA had effectively imposed gag rules which forbade them from discussing their positions with patients.<ref name=autogenerated4>David Wahlberg, "Health Living: Fill It Up But With What", Atlanta Journal and Constitution, April 9, 2002, at 1F.</ref>  The Boston College Law School study also cites proceedings in which an Arizona dentist, "is facing sanctions for advocating alternative materials", a California dentist lost his license, "for running an advertisement entitled: "Mercury Emission from Silver Filings Unsafe by Government Standards", and a Maryland dentist, "was sanctioned for writing an article on dental amalgam removal".<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref>Amy Pyle, "A Debate on Mercury in Fillings", L.A. Times, October 25, 1999, at A.</ref><ref>Maura Lerner & Karen Youso, "Health Claims in Dispute Over Replacement Filings", Star Tribune (Minneapolis), October 8, 1995, at 1A.
</ref>  More recently, the ADA has entered into litigation "aimed at defending its reputation and discouraging further lawsuits by patient-plaintiffs against dental amalgam".<ref name=Chirba-Martin/>

====Removal of amalgam fillings====
Some practitioners may also recommend that patients with amalgam fillings have them removed and replaced, particularly if the patient is experiencing the symptoms that they attribute to the use of amalgam.<ref>[http://www.iaomt.org/articledetails.cfm?artid=272 IAOMT: Education & Organization in the Age of Mercury Free Dentistry] {{Dead link|date=May 2009}} (Wayback [http://web.archive.org/web/20061208053900/http://www.iaomt.org/articledetails.cfm?artid=272])</ref> These professionals recommend that unprotected amalgam removal should be avoided even in routine dental procedures to avoid exposure to mercury vapor and amalgam particulate matter.

[[Consumer Reports]] magazine claims that the connection between many of these diseases and amalgam fillings is solely revenue-generating propaganda. Consumer Reports told its readers on several occasions that "if a dentist wants to remove your fillings because they contain mercury, watch your wallet."<ref>The mercury scare: if a dentist wants to remove your fillings because they contain mercury, watch your wallet. Consumer Reports 51(3):150-152, March 1986</ref><ref>The mercury in your mouth: You can avoid amalgam fillings or even replace the ones you have, but should you?

====Trends in amalgam use====
Better dental health overall coupled with increased demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, have resulted in a steady decline in dental amalgam<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16393132 |url=http://www.begellhouse.com/journals/1bef42082d7a0fdf,56437700108bb47c,3d993af44d47a799.html |year=2005 |last1=Stein |first1=PS |last2=Sullivan |first2=J |last3=Haubenreich |first3=JE |last4=Osborne |first4=PB |title=Composite resin in medicine and dentistry |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=641–54 |journal=Journal of long-term effects of medical implants}}</ref> in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be around for many more years to come.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2051503 |doi=10.3109/15563659109038607 |year=1991 |last1=Mortensen |first1=ME |title=Mysticism and science: the amalgam wars |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=vii–xii |journal=Journal of toxicology.

===Autoimmune disorders===
Dental amalgam has been found to be a frequent contributor to [[lichen planus|oral lichenoid lesions]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12534597 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.04936.x |year=2003 |last1=Dunsche |first1=A |last2=Kästel |first2=I |last3=Terheyden |first3=H |last4=Springer |first4=IN |last5=Christophers |first5=E |last6=Brasch |first6=J |title=Oral lichenoid reactions associated with amalgam: improvement after amalgam removal |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=70–6 |journal=The British journal of dermatology}}</ref>  and is possibly a variable associated with an increased risk of other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, thyroiditis and eczema.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15349088 |url=http://www.nel.edu/pdf_/25_3/NEL250304A07_Prochazkova_.pdf |year=2004 |last1=Prochazkova |first1=J |last2=Sterzl |first2=I |last3=Kucerova |first3=H |last4=Bartova |first4=J |last5=Stejskal |first5=VD |title=The beneficial effect of amalgam replacement on health in patients with autoimmunity |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=211–8 |journal=Neuro endocrinology letters}}</ref>

===Health effects for dentists===
In 1991 [[Geir Bjørklund]] published a toxicological risk analysis of occupational diseases in dentistry that are related to chronic exposure to inorganic mercury, especially metallic mercury vapour.<ref name="Bjørklund1991">{{cite journal |author=Bjørklund G |title=Mercury in the dental office. Risk evaluation of the occupational environment in dental care (in Norwegian) |journal=Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen |volume=111 |issue=8 |pages=948–951 |year=1991 |pmid=2042211 |doi= |url=}}</ref> He found studies indicated that dental work involving mercury may be an occupational hazard with respect to reproductive processes, glioblastoma (brain cancer), renal function changes, allergies and immunotoxicological effects.<ref name="Bjørklund1991" />

In 1994 Rowland found a 40% decline in [[Fecundity|fecundability]] in a case controlled study of female dental assistants exposed to mercury in dental offices.It should be noted that female dental assistants exposed to low levels of mercury were more fertile than their unexposed counterparts.<ref>Rowland AS et. al. The effect of occupational exposure to mercury vapor on the fertility of female dental assistants Journal of Occupational Environmental Medicine 51,28-34  1994</ref> There has been no evidence that dentists who are exposed to dental amalgam and vapor on a daily basis get mercury poisoning; however, individual dentists and staff members have become mercury poisoned and studies of the dental profession has documented a decline in cognitive abilities greater than the non-mercury exposed individuals.<ref>BE Moen, BE Hollund, and T Riise, Neurological symptoms among dental assistants: a cross-sectional study, J Occup Med Toxicol. 2008; 3: 10.

A small-scale study based in Singapore found the "exposed-dentist" group had 14% worse scores in memory, co-ordination, motor speed and concentration compared to the control group.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1463679 |pmc=1039326 |year=1992 |last1=Ngim |first1=CH |last2=Foo |first2=SC |last3=Boey |first3=KW |last4=Jeyaratnam |first4=J |title=Chronic neurobehavioural effects of elemental mercury in dentists |volume=49 |issue=11 |pages=782–90 |journal=British journal of industrial medicine}}</ref> The study did not demonstrate any link between mercury exposure and these lagging scores, however. A newer study<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15254338 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfh220 |year=2004 |last1=Heyer |first1=NJ |last2=Echeverria |first2=D |last3=Bittner Ac |first3=Jr |last4=Farin |first4=FM |last5=Garabedian |first5=CC |last6=Woods |first6=JS |title=Chronic low-level mercury exposure, BDNF polymorphism, and associations with self-reported symptoms and mood |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=354–63 |journal=Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology}}</ref> also found a link between cognitive impairment (including mood) and dental work, even though "exposure among these dental personnel is not much greater than exposures to the general population through the dental amalgam in their fillings" as shown by urinary studies. Twelve of 13 symptoms were correlated with greater mercury exposure.

A study examining the health effects of mercury on dentists in the UK published in the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Journal<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11983843 |pmc=1740287 |doi=10.1136/oem.59.5.287 |year=2002 |last1=Ritchie |first1=KA |last2=Gilmour |first2=WH |last3=MacDonald |first3=EB |last4=Burke |first4=FJ |last5=McGowan |first5=DA |last6=Dale |first6=IM |last7=Hammersley |first7=R |last8=Hamilton |first8=RM |last9=Binnie |first9=V |title=Health and neuropsychological functioning of dentists exposed to mercury |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=287–93 |journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine}}</ref> concluded that 180 dentists had on average 4 times the urinary mercury excretion levels of 180 people in a control group. Dentists were significantly more likely than control subjects to have had disorders of the kidney or memory disturbance. No direct correlation between urinary mercury levels and the disability, however, was found. Urine testing is unreliable for showing lifetime mercury accumulation rather than recent exposure.

==Environmental impact==

The WHO reports that mercury from amalgam and laboratory devices accounts for 53% of total mercury emissions, and that one-third of the mercury in the sewage system comes from dental amalgam flushed down the drain.<ref name=WHOwaste>WHO. (2005).[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/medicalwaste/mercurypolpaper.pdf Mercury in Health Care]</ref> Mercury is an environmental toxin and the [[World Health Organization]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], and [[NIOSH]] have established specific occupational exposure limits. Amalgam removed from teeth is classified as toxic waste in various countries, but in many countries it is not regulated, including the United States.<ref name=USregulation/> The environmental [[pollution]] of mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population; in economics this pollution is considered an [[external cost]] not factored into the private costs of using dental amalgam. Separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, but they are not required in the United States.<ref name=autogenerated5 />

Environmental risks are mitigated provided that amalgams are disposed of properly. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste, and legislation to enforce these standards is being adopted in some US states.<ref>[http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/dshm/redrecy/mercfaq.htm New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]</ref>

===Mercury loading of municipal wastewater===

The Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies (AMSA) studied seven major [[Waste treatment|waste-water treatment]] plants and found that dental uses were "by far" the greatest contributors of mercury load, on average contributing 40%, over 3 times the next greatest contributor.<ref>GLRPPR. (2002). [http://www.glrppr.org/contacts/fullrecord.cfm?sectordocid=1153 The Uncontrolled Release of Dental Mercury, p. 5 (7 of PDF)]</ref><ref>[http://www.in.gov/idem/rules/progress/water/wpcb03130/mercurylibrary/26quesandhgrefs.pdf Collection of articles]</ref> The EPA recognizes dental amalgam as a major source of the mercury in the water. The Western Lake Superior Sanitary District that dentists emit .1&nbsp;grams of mercury per day per dentist. Based on this, dental amalgam contributes 14% of the mercury in Seattle and 12% of the mercury in San Francisco. 4% of the mercury in Lake Superior is believed to originate from amalgam.<ref>US EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/grtlakes/bnsdocs/hgsbook/index.html Mercury Sourcebook].  [http://www.epa.gov/grtlakes/bnsdocs/hgsbook/dentist.pdf Section III, Mercury Use: Dentists, p249]</ref> The [[National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA)|National Association of Clean Water Agencies]] noted in a report that purification of mercury from waste water will impose a significant financial burden upon municipal treatment plants.<ref>NACWA (2000).

With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries "accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brinton L |title=The amalgam controversy |journal=British Dental Journal |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=90 |year=1994 |month=February |pmid=7599005 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4808378}}</ref>

===Cremation===

[[Cremation]] of bodies containing amalgam restorations results in near-complete emission of the mercury to the atmosphere, as the temperature in cremation is far greater than the boiling point of mercury. In countries with high cremation rates (such as the United Kingdom), mercury has become a great concern. Proposals to remedy the situation have ranged from removing amalgam-containing teeth prior to cremation to installing [[activated carbon]] adsorption or other post-combustion mercury capture technology in the flue gas stream. These proposals range from unpopular to expensive.

Studies have shown the amount of mercury to be released per body cremated to range from 0.25&nbsp;grams to slightly over 1.00&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewscremation.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=_ASrJIt_lrk%3D&tabid=180|title=Mercury Rising? Analyzing Emissions and the Cremation Process|last=Rahill|first=Paul|year=2008|work=Cremationist|publisher=CANA|page=2|accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref> The number of amalgam fillings and their size determines the volume of mercury released, as well as any deposition which may occur in the backend of the cremation equipment, either incidental or intentional (e.g. if a [[Dust Collector|baghouse]] or other filtration system is employed).

As a comparison, a mercury [[thermometer]] contains 0.50&nbsp;grams of mercury, and an average [[compact fluorescent lamp]] contains 0.004&nbsp;grams of mercury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf|title=Information on Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs) and Mercury|date=November 2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref> Such numbers indicate that the average cremation of a body with amalgam emits as much mercury as is contained in 156 compact fluorescent lamps.

==Available alternatives==
Alternative materials include composite resins, glass ionomer cements, and gold alloys.<ref>{{cite web|last=SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and NewlyIdentified Health Risks)|title=Scientific opinion on the Safety of Dental Amalgam and  Alternative Dental Restoration Materials for Patients and Users|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_016.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=6 May 2008}}</ref>  
Most of these materials, with the notable exception of gold, have not been used as long as amalgam, and some are known to contain other potentially hazardous compounds. This is why [[biocompatibility]] testing is recommended for all dental materials as per ADA/ANSA or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards, and can be performed by specialized laboratories.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmalz G |title=Concepts in biocompatibility testing of dental restorative materials |journal=Clinical Oral Investigations |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=154–62 |year=1997 |month=December |pmid=9555211 |doi=10.1007/s007840050027}}</ref> Some experts also caution against a too-sudden shift towards composite resin to allow time for dentists to acquire the skills needed to properly place resin fillings since ''" clinical studies on the longevity of amalgam and resin composite restorations placed by dental students and dentists who are experienced in both composite resin and amalgam placement show a comparable and acceptable annual failure rate for those restorations".''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Opdam NJ |trans_title=The future of dental amalgam |language=Dutch |journal=Nederlands Tijdschrift Voor Tandheelkunde |volume=112 |issue=10 |pages=373–5 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16300323 |title=The future of dental amalgam}}</ref> Teaching of amalgam techniques to dental students is declining in some schools in favor of composite resin,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Teaching of posterior composite resin restorations in undergraduate dental schools in Ireland and the United Kingdom |journal=European Journal of Dental Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=38–43 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16436083 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0579.2006.00394.x |author1=Lynch CD |author2=McConnell RJ |author3=Wilson NH |author-separator=,}}</ref> and at least one school, University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, had eliminated dental amalgam from the curriculum entirely in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The amalgam-free dental school |journal=Journal of Dentistry |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=371–7 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15193785 |doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2004.02.008 |author1=Roeters FJ |author2=Opdam NJ |author3=Loomans BA |author-separator=,}}</ref>

==Notable critics of amalgam fillings==
[[Alfred Stock]], a noted chemist, reported becoming very ill, and eventually tracing his illness to his amalgam fillings and the resulting mercury intoxication.  He described his recovery after the fillings were removed and believed that amalgam fillings would come to be seen as a "sin against humanity."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stock |first=Alfred |title=Die Gefaehrlichkeit des Quecksilberdampfes |trans_title=The Hazards of Mercury Vapor |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~bcalhoun/AStock.htm |journal=Zeitschrift für angewandte Chemie |pages=461–466 |volume=39 |year=1926 |doi=10.1002/ange.19260391502 |issue=15}}</ref> [[Hal Huggins]], a Colorado dentist(previous to having his license revoked), is a notable critic of dental amalgams and other dental therapies he believes to be harmful;<ref>{{cite book |author=Huggins, Hal A.; Anderson |title=It's All in Your Head: The Link Between Mercury Amalgams and Illness (Paperback) |publisher=Avery Publishing  |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-89529-550-4 |edition= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> his views on amalgam toxicity were featured on ''[[60 Minutes]]''.<ref>CBS's 60 Minutes, December 16, 1990.</ref>

==History of amalgam in the USA==
{{Globalize|date=June 2010}}
{{Main|Dental fillings}}
In 1840, the [[American Society of Dental Surgeons]] was founded by a group of dentists who met in New York city. It was the only national organization of dentists in existence at the time. [[Chapin A. Harris]], the co-founder of the ASDS and the first dental school in the US, the [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]], spoke of dental amalgam in his opening address: ''"It is one of the most objectionable articles for filling teeth that can be employed, and yet from the wonderful virtues ascribed to this pernicious compound by those who used it, thousands were induced to try its efficacy".''<ref>[http://art-bin.com/art/otalbot1882.html The chemistry and physiological action of mercury as used in amalgam fillings]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ring ME |title=Founders of a profession: the original subscribers to the first dental journal in the world |journal=The Journal of the American College of Dentists |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=20–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16350927}}</ref> In 1845, the ASDS had members sign a mandatory pledge promising not to use mercury fillings because of fear of [[mercury poisoning]] in patients and dentists (at the time, dentists made amalgam by mixing liquid mercury and the other components of amalgam themselves in their office, a practice which continued until pre-filled amalgam capsules became generally available in the 1960s).<ref>[http://www.fauchard.org/publications/history/Journal_00_48_2p75.htm Journal of the History of Dentistry - The General Dentist]</ref> During the next decade some members of the society were suspended for the use of amalgam. Because of its stance against dental amalgam, membership in the American Society of Dental Surgeons declined, and due to the loss of members, the organization disbanded in 1856.

In 1859, the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) was founded by twenty-six delegates representing various dental societies in the United States at a meeting in Niagara Falls, New York. The ADA did not forbid use of amalgams. The ADA position on the safety of amalgam has remained consistent since its foundation. As of 2006, the ADA has over 152,000 members and is the largest and longest-standing professional association of dentists in the world.

Amalgam formulations and properties were gradually improved, notably by Dr. [[G.V. Black]] in 1895. Despite these changes, debate over the use of amalgams persisted in the dental profession. The ADA maintained until 1984 that mercury was bound in amalgam and did not release mercury vapor. In the 1970s studies demonstrated that a small amount of mercury vapor was constantly being released from amalgam, corroborating the first such study published in 1882 in the Ohio State Journal of Dental Science by Dr. Eugene S. Talbot.<ref>[http://art-bin.com/art/otalbot1882.html The physiological action of mercury]</ref>

==Regulation by country==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Some legislators have introduced [[legislation]] to prohibit or restrict use of amalgam fillings.

===Europe===
In most [[Europe]]an countries (for example, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]), amalgam use is unrestricted.
Some other countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, have banned the use of mercury in dental amalgams, citing health or environmental concerns.<ref name=mpp20080103/> The Swedish Chemicals Inspectorate (KemI) maintains a web site containing a report on the investigation for a general ban on mercury on which it states, ''"KemI judges that there are strong grounds for banning amalgam for environmental reasons. From a health point of view there is every reason to apply a precautionary approach."''<ref>[http://www.kemi.se/upload/Trycksaker/Pdf/Rapporter/Rapport4_04.pdf KemI Report 4/04 - Mercury &#173; investigation of a general ban<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some countries, notably [[Austria]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and [[Germany]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, have some restrictions on dental amalgam, such as permitting its use for the general population, but not for children, pregnant women, people with kidney problems, when in contact with other metals, such as braces, and in people with mercury sensitivity.

====Norway====

Sewers from Norwegian dental clinics older than 1994 (or if there is other reason to believe amalgam have ended up in the sewers instead of the patients mouth) shall be cleaned by experienced personnel to properly remove any residual mercury. The detailed procedure to do so is available from [[Norwegian Pollution Control Authority]] free of charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sft.no/Publikasjoner/Publikasjoner/2004/August/Prosedyre-for-sanering-av-internt-ledningsnett-i-tannklinikker/ |title=Prosedyre for sanering av internt ledningsnett i tannklinikker |language=Norwegian |date=26 August 2004 |publisher=[[Norwegian Pollution Control Authority]] |accessdate=29 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

====Sweden====
Amalgam use is illegal in [[Sweden]] as of 1 April 2008. The Swedish amalgam ban is for both environmental and health issues, according to the Swedish authorities.<ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/03/idUS108558+03-Jan-2008+PRN20080103</ref><ref>http://www.dentistry.co.uk/news/992-Amalgam-ban-causes-a-stir</ref>

===United States===

In the US, many states are undertaking both regulatory and non-regulatory activities to ensure proper management of mercury-containing dental amalgam.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/tsd/mercury/medical.htm State Mercury Medical/Dental Waste Programs]</ref>

In the United States, amalgams are classified as a "device," not a "substance," by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, amalgams are a [[prosthetic]] device:

:''Amalgam Alloy, (a) Identification. An amalgam alloy is a device that consists of a metallic substance intended to be mixed with mercury to form filling material for treatment of dental caries. (b) Classification. Class II.'' (21 CFR 872.3050 (2001))

On July 28, 2009, FDA issued a final rule that: (1) reclassified mercury from a class I (least risk) device to class II (more risk) device; (2) classified dental amalgam as a class II device; and (3) designated a special controls guidance document for dental amalgam.<ref name="fda.gov">http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DentalProducts/DentalAmalgam/ucm171120.htm</ref>

The special controls guidance document recommends specific labelling, including an Information for Use statement "Dental amalgam has been demonstrated to be an effective restorative material that has benefits in terms of strength, marginal integrity, suitability for large occlusal surfaces, and durability. Dental amalgam also releases low levels of mercury vapor, a chemical that at high exposure levels is well documented to cause neurological and renal adverse health effects." <ref name="fda.gov"/>

In 2001 in a lawsuit involving [[California Proposition 65]] and amalgams, a [[California]] Superior Court judge ruled that all dental offices with more than nine employees must provide notices on the contents of dental fillings. The mandated notice reads:

:''Notice to Patients, Proposition 65: Warning on dental amalgams, used in many dental fillings, causes exposure to mercury, a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. Root canal treatments and restorations including fillings, crowns and bridges, use chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has studied the situation and approved for use all dental restorative materials. Consult your dentist to determine which materials are appropriate for your treatment.''

Following the meeting of the joint committees on 6–7 September 2006, when the panel of outside advisers that the FDA had asked to assess the conclusions of its report on amalgam safety rejected the FDA report in a 13-7 vote, they stated the report's conclusions were ''"unreasonable"'', given the quantity and quality of information currently available. Panelists said remaining uncertainties about the risk of so-called silver fillings demanded further research, in particular, on the effects of mercury-laden fillings on children and the fetuses of pregnant women with fillings and the release of mercury vapor on insertion and removal of mercury fillings. Michael Aschner, a professor of pediatrics and pharmacology at Vanderbilt University and a panel consultant said "There are too many things we don't know, too many things that were excluded."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/09/07/mercury.fillings.ap/index.html?section=cnn_latest, ''FDA advisers: Safety of mercury fillings needs more study''] Retrieved 10 September 2006 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14680800/ ''Are mercury tooth fillings really safe?''] {{Dead link|date=December 2008}} Retrieved 10 September 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/07/health/main1983628.shtml ''FDA Panel: Fillings May Not Be Safe''] Retrieved 12 September 2006</ref>

Shortly after the decision of the joint advisory panel, the president of the [[International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology]] (IAOMT) wrote to the FDA to ask for an expanded review of current science on dental amalgams, a definitive date for such a hearing, and a format that will assure that the full breadth of health effects is assessed.<ref>[http://www.iaomt.org/documents/FDA.LTR%209-12-06%20RECONVENING%20PANEL%20-%20FINAL.pdf Request to reconvene joint meeting of the: ''Dental Products Panel & the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee''.]</ref> In a press release the ADA wrote that it " welcomes the call by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel for additional review of scientific studies on the safety of dental amalgam fillings." and reiterated that "the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence supports the safety and efficacy of dental amalgam, and it should continue to be made available to dentists and their patients " and " dental amalgam contains elemental mercury combined with other metals such as silver, copper, tin and zinc to form a safe, stable alloy."<ref>{{cite press release |title=ADA Welcomes Additional Scientific Review of Dental Filling Safety |publisher=[[American Dental Association]] |date=7 September 2006 |url=http://www.ada.org/public/media/releases/0609_release01.asp |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref>
