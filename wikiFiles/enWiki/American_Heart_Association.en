The '''American Heart Association''' ('''AHA''') is a [[non-profit organization]] in the [[United States]] that fosters appropriate [[Heart|cardiac]] care in an effort to reduce [[disability]] and deaths caused by [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[stroke]]. It is headquartered in [[Dallas, Texas]].  The American Heart Association is a national voluntary health agency whose mission is: "Building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular diseases and stroke." Its motto is "Learn and Live".

Ralph L. Sacco, [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Medical Scientist Training Program|MS]], [[American Academy of Neurology|FAAN]], [[Australian Academy of the Humanities|FAHA]], is the current President of the American Heart Association. He is the first [[neurologist]] to hold the position.

==Mission==

The American Heart Association publishes a standard for providing basic and advanced life support, including standards for proper performance of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR). The AHA offers the most widely accepted certification for [[basic life support]] (BLS). The AHA is now also a provider of training for [[first aid]], in addition to CPR.  The AHA also operates an affiliated organization, the [[American Stroke Association]], which focuses on care, research and prevention of strokes.

==History and Reputation==

In 1994, the [[Chronicle of Philanthropy]], an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility.  The study showed that the American Heart Association was ranked as the 5th "most popular charity/non-profit in America" of over 100 charities researched with 95% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing Love and Like A lot for the American Heart Association.<ref>The Charities Americans Like Most And Least, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, December 13, 1996 And USA Today, December 20, 1994, "Charity begins with health", FINAL 01D</ref>
