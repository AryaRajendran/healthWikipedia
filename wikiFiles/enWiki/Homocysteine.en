'''Homocysteine''' [IPA: ˌhəʊməʊˈsɪstiːn] is a protein [[amino acid]].  It is a [[homologous series|homologue]] of the amino acid [[cysteine]], differing by an additional [[methylene bridge]] (-CH<sub>2</sub>-).  It is biosynthesized from  [[methionine]] by the removal of its terminal C<sup>ε</sup> [[methyl group]].  Homocysteine can be recycled into [[methionine]] or converted into cysteine with the aid of B-vitamins.

While detection of high levels of homocysteine has been linked to cardiovascular disease, lowering homocysteine levels may not improve outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martí-Carvajal AJ, Solà I, Lathyris D, Salanti G |title=Homocysteine lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD006612 |year=2009 |pmid=19821378 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006612.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Martí-Carvajal |editor1-first=Arturo J}}</ref>

==Health effects==

Elevated levels of homocysteine have been associated with a number of disease states. However, benefits from efforts to lower homocysteine levels are either not supportive or not conclusive. This includes no evidence to support prevention of [[cardiovascular disease]] (including in those with [[kidney disease]]),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martí-Carvajal|first=AJ|coauthors=Solà, I; Lathyris, D; Salanti, G|title=Homocysteine lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2009-10-07|issue=4|pages=CD006612|pmid=19821378|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006612.pub2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Jardine|first=MJ|coauthors=Kang, A; Zoungas, S; Navaneethan, SD; Ninomiya, T; Nigwekar, SU; Gallagher, MP; Cass, A; Strippoli, G; Perkovic, V|title=The effect of folic acid based homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular events in people with kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2012-06-13|volume=344|pages=e3533|pmid=22695899|pmc=3374481}}</ref> tentative but inconclusive evidence for [[congestive heart failure]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vizzardi|first=E|coauthors=Bonadei, I; Zanini, G; Frattini, S; Fiorina, C; Raddino, R; Dei Cas, L|title=Homocysteine and heart failure: an overview.|journal=Recent patents on cardiovascular drug discovery|date=2009 Jan|volume=4|issue=1|pages=15–21|pmid=19149701}}</ref> and bone health.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ahmadieh|first=H|coauthors=Arabi, A|title=Vitamins and bone health: beyond calcium and vitamin D.|journal=Nutrition Reviews|date=2011 Oct|volume=69|issue=10|pages=584–98|pmid=21967159|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00372.x}}</ref>

===Elevated homocysteine===
Abnormally high levels of homocysteine in the serum, above 15 µmol/L, are a medical condition called [[Hyperhomocysteinemia]].  This condition is a significant risk factor for the development of a wide range of diseases.

Deficiencies of the vitamins [[folic acid]] (B<sub>9</sub>), [[Vitamin B6|pyridoxine]] (B<sub>6</sub>), or [[cyanocobalamin|B<sub>12</sub>]] ([[cobalamin]]) can lead to high homocysteine levels.<ref name="AmJClinNutrition1994-Miller">{{cite journal | author=Miller JW, Nadeau MR, Smith D and Selhub J | title=Vitamin B-6 deficiency vs folate deficiency: comparison of responses to methionine loading in rats | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | year=1994 | volume=59 | pages= 1033&ndash;1039 | pmid=8172087 |issue=5}}</ref>

Clin. Exp. Res. | pages=334–6}}</ref>

Elevations of homocysteine also occur in the rare [[genetics|hereditary]] disease [[homocystinuria]] and in the [[MTHFR|methylene-tetrahydrofolate-reductase]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] genetic traits. The latter is quite common (about 10% of the world population) and it is linked to an increased incidence of [[thrombosis]] and [[cardiovascular disease]], which occurs more often in people with above minimal levels of homocysteine (about 6 μmol/L). These individuals require adequate dietary riboflavin in order for homocysteine levels to remain normal. Common levels in Western populations are 10 to 12 and levels of 20 μmol/L are found in populations with low B-vitamin intakes (e.g., New Delhi) or in the older elderly (e.g., Rotterdam, Framingham).  Women have 10-15% less homocysteine during their reproductive decades than men, which may help explain the fact they suffer [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attacks) on average 10 to 15 years later than men.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, this phenomenon is more readily explained by higher levels of estrogen, which exerts a cardioprotective effect.

===Cardiovascular risks===
A high level of [[blood]] [[blood plasma|serum]] homocysteine ("homocystinemia") is a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, one study which attempted to decrease the risk by lowering homocysteine was not fruitful.<ref name="BBC2005-NewsBvit">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4218186.stm |title= B vitamins do not protect hearts |  work=BBC News | publisher=BBC | date=September 6, 2005 | accessdate=2006-03-20}}</ref> This study was conducted on nearly 5000 Norwegian heart attack survivors who already had severe, late-stage heart disease. No study has yet been conducted in a preventive capacity on subjects who are in a relatively good state of health.

Studies reported in 2006 have shown that giving vitamins ([[folic acid]], B<sub>6</sub> ([[pyridoxine]]), and B<sub>12</sub>) to reduce homocysteine levels may not quickly offer benefit, however a significant 25% reduction in stroke was found in the HOPE-2 study
<ref name="NEJM2006a">{{cite journal | author= | title=Homocysteine Lowering with Folic Acid and B Vitamins in Vascular Disease | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2006 | pages= 1567–77| volume= 354| pmid=16531613|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa060900v1.pdf |format= PDF | last1= Lonn |first1= E | last2= Yusuf | first2= S | last3= Arnold | first3= MJ | last4= Sheridan |first4= P | last5= Pogue | first5= J | last6= Micks | first6= M | last7= McQueen | first7= MJ | last8= Probstfield | first8= J | last9= Fodor | first9= G | issue= 15 | doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa060900}}</ref> even in patients mostly with existing serious arterial decline although the overall death rate was not significantly changed by the intervention in the trial. Clearly, reducing homocysteine does not quickly repair existing structural damage of the artery architecture. However, the science is strongly supporting the biochemistry that homocysteine degrades and inhibits the formation of the three main structural components of the artery, [[collagen]], [[elastin]] and the [[proteoglycans]].  Homocysteine permanently degrades cysteine [[disulfide bridges]] and lysine amino acid residues in proteins, gradually affecting function and structure. Simply put, homocysteine is a 'corrosive' of long-living proteins, i.e., collagen or elastin, or lifelong proteins, i.e., [[fibrillin]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} These long-term effects are difficult to establish in clinical trials focusing on groups with existing artery decline.  The main role of reducing homocysteine is possibly in 'prevention' but studies in patients with pre-existing conditions found no significant benefit nor damage.<ref name="NEJM2006a"/><ref name="JAmCollCardiol2006-Zoungas">{{cite journal |author=Zoungas S, McGrath BP, Branley P, Kerr PG, Muske C, Wolfe R, Atkins RC, Nicholls K, Fraenkel M, Hutchison BG, Walker R, McNeil JJ | title=Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the Atherosclerosis and Folic Acid Supplementation Trial (ASFAST) in chronic renal failure: a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol |year=2006 | pages=1108–16 | volume=47 | issue=6 | pmid=16545638 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2005.10.064}}</ref><ref name="NEJM2006-Bonna">{{cite journal |author=Bonaa KH, Njolstad I, Ueland PM, Schirmer H, Tverdal A, Steigen T, Wang H, Nordrehaug JE, Arnesen E, Rasmussen K | title=Homocysteine Lowering and Cardiovascular Events after Acute Myocardial Infarction | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2006 |volume= 354| pmid=16531614 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa055227v1.pdf|format= PDF | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa055227 | issue=15 | pages=1578–88}}</ref>

Hypotheses have been offered to address the failure of homocysteine-lowering therapies to reduce cardiovascular event frequency.<ref name="NEJM2006-Loscalzo">{{cite journal |author=Loscalzo J | title=Homocysteine Trials — Clear Outcomes for Complex Reasons |journal=N Engl J Med | year=2006 | pages=1629–1632 | volume=354 | issue=15 | pmid=17224870| doi=10.1056/NEJMe068060}}</ref> One suggestion is that folic acid may directly cause an increased build-up of arterial plaque, independent of its homocysteine-lowering effects.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Alternatively, folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> may cause an overall change in gene methylation levels in vascular cells, which may also promote plaque growth.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Finally, altering methylation activity in cells might increase methylation of l-arginine to asymmetric dimethylarginine which can increase the risk of vascular disease.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Thus alternative homocysteine-lowering therapies may yet be developed which show greater effects on development and progression of cardiovascular disease.

The VITATOPS trial concluded that B-vitamin supplements, within 2 years, do not seem to significantly reduce subsequent stroke, MI, or vascular death in patients with a history of recent stroke and ischemic attack, despite lowering of homocysteine levels.<ref>{{cite journal|title=B vitamins in patients with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke in the VITAmins TO Prevent Stroke (VITATOPS) trial: a randomised, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial|journal=The Lancet Neurology|year= 2010|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(10)70187-3|volume=9|issue=9|pages=855–865}}</ref>

===Neuropsychiatric illness===
Studies demonstrate the connection between elevated levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinaemia) and occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) besides other cognitive impairments.

===Bone health===
Elevated levels of homocysteine have been linked to increased [[Fracture (bone)|fractures]] in elderly persons. The high level of homocysteine will auto-oxidize and react with reactive oxygen intermediates and damage endothelial cells and has a higher risk to form a thrombus.<ref name="NEJM2004-McLean">{{cite journal | author=McLean RR ''et al.''| title=Homocysteine as a predictive factor for hip fracture in older persons |journal=New England Journal of Medicine | year=2004 | volume=350 | pages= 2042&ndash;2049| pmid=15141042 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa032739 | issue=20}}[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/350/20/2042 Free text after free registration]</ref><ref name="NEJM2004-vanMeurs">{{cite journal | author=van Meurs JB ''et al.'' | title=Homocysteine levels and the risk of osteoporotic fracture | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | year=2004 | volume=350 | pages= 2033&ndash;2041 |pmid=15141041 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa032546 | issue=20}}[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/350/20/2033 Free text after free registration]</ref> Homocysteine does not affect bone density.  Instead, it appears that homocysteine affects [[collagen]] by interfering with the cross-linking between the collagen fibers and the tissues they reinforce.  Whereas the HOPE-2 trial <ref name="NEJM2006a" /> showed a reduction in stroke incidence, in those with stroke there is a high rate of hip fractures in the affected side.  A trial with 2 homocysteine-lowering vitamins (folate and B<sub>12</sub>) in people with prior stroke, there was an 80% reduction in fractures, mainly hip, after 2 years.  Interestingly, also here, bone density (and the number of falls) were identical in the vitamin and the placebo groups.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sato Y, Honda Y, Iwamoto J, Kanoko T, Satoh K|title=Effect of folate and mecobalamin on hip fractures in patients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=9 |pages=1082–8 |year=2005|month=March |pmid=15741530 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.9.1082 |url=}}</ref>

[[Vitamin]] supplements counter the deleterious effects of homocysteine on collagen.  As they inefficiently absorb B<sub>12</sub> from food, elderly persons may benefit from taking higher doses orally such as 100 mcg/day (found in some multivitamins) or by [[intramuscular injection]].

== Structure ==
Homocysteine exists at neutral pH values as a [[zwitterion]].

[[File:Betain-Homocystein.png|thumb|right|300px|Betatine form of (''S'')-homocysteine (left) and (''R'')-homocysteine (right)]]

==Biosynthesis and biochemical roles==
Homocysteine is not obtained from the diet.<ref name="AnRvNutrition1999-Selhub">{{cite journal | author=Selhub, J. | title=Homocysteine metabolism | journal=Annual Review of Nutrition | year=1999 | volume=19 | pages=217&ndash;246 | pmid=10448523 | doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.217}}</ref> Instead, it is biosynthesized from [[methionine]] via a multi-step process.  First, methionine receives an adenosine group from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], a reaction catalyzed by [[S-adenosyl-methionine synthetase]], to give [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM). SAM then transfers the methyl group to an acceptor molecule, (i.e., [[norepinephrine]] as an acceptor during [[epinephrine]] synthesis, [[DNA methyltransferase]] as an intermediate acceptor in the process of [[DNA methylation]]).  The adenosine is then [[hydrolyzed]] to yield <small>L</small>-homocysteine.  <small>L</small>-Homocysteine has two primary fates: conversion via [[tetrahydrofolate]] (THF) back into [[methionine|<small>L</small>-methionine]] or conversion to [[cysteine|<small>L</small>-cysteine]].<ref>Champe, PC and Harvey, RA. "Biochemistry.  Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews" 4th ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2008</ref>

===Biosynthesis of cysteine===
Mammals biosynthesize the amino acid cysteine via homocysteine.  [[Cystathionine-beta-synthase|Cystathionine β-synthase]] catalyses the condensation of homocysteine and [[serine]] to give [[cystathionine]].  This reaction uses [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>) as a cofactor. [[Cystathionine-beta-lyase|Cystathionine β-lyase]] then converts this double amino acid to cysteine, ammonia, and α-ketobutyrate.  Bacteria and plants rely on a different pathway to produce cysteine, relying on ''O''-acetylserine.<ref>Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. "Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. ISBN 1-57259-153-6.</ref>

[[Image:Met pathway.gif|thumb|Two of homocysteine's main biochemical roles. (Homocysteine is seen in the left middle of the image.) It can be synthesized from methionine and then converted back to methionine via the SAM cycle or used to create cysteine and alpha-ketobuterate.]]

===Methionine salvage===
Homocysteine can be recycled into [[methionine]]. This process uses N5-methyl tetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor and [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>)-related enzymes.  More detail on these enzymes can be found in the article for [[methionine synthase]].

===Other reactions of biochemical significance===
Homocysteine can cyclize to give [[homocysteine thiolactone]], a five-membered [[heterocycle]].  Because of this "self-looping" reaction, homocysteine-containing [[peptide]]s tend to cleave themselves by reactions generating oxidative stress.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/107/2/551.long | pmid = 20080717 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0909737107 | volume=107 | issue=2 | title=Homocystamides promote free-radical and oxidative damage to proteins | pmc=2818928 | year=2010 | month=January | author=Sibrian-Vazquez M, Escobedo JO, Lim S, Samoei GK, Strongin RM | journal=Proc.
