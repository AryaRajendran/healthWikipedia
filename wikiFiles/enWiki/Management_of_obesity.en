The most effective treatment for obesity is [[bariatric surgery]]. Surgery for severe obesity is associated with long-term weight loss and decreased overall mortality. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending on the type of procedure performed) at 10&nbsp;years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures.<ref name="Sjöström L, Narbro K, Sjöström CD, et al. 2007 741–52">{{cite journal |author=Sjöström L, Narbro K, Sjöström CD, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of bariatric surgery on mortality in Swedish obese subjects |journal=N.

Studies have found significant benefits in mortality in certain populations from weight loss. In a [[prospective]] study of obese women with weight related diseases, intentional weight loss of any amount was associated with a 20% reduction in mortality.  In obese women without obesity related illnesses a weight loss of greater than 9&nbsp;kg (20&nbsp;lb) was associated with a 25% reduction in mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williamson DF, Pamuk E, Thun M, Flanders D, Byers T, Heath C |title=Prospective study of intentional weight loss and mortality in never-smoking overweight US white women aged 40–64 years |journal=Am.

== Dieting ==
{{Main|Dieting}}

Diets to promote weight loss are generally divided into four categories: [[low-fat diet|low-fat]], [[low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate]], low-calorie, and [[very low calorie diet|very low calorie]].<ref name=Strychar/> A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between three of the main diet types (low calorie, low carbohydrate, and low fat), with a 2–4&nbsp;kilogram (4.4–8.8&nbsp;lb) weight loss in all studies.<ref name=Strychar/>  At two years these three methods resulted in similar weight loss irrespective of the [[macronutrients]] emphasized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sacks FM, Bray GA, Carey VJ, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of weight-loss diets with different compositions of fat, protein, and carbohydrates |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=360 |issue=9 |pages=859–73 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19246357 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0804748 |url= |pmc=2763382}}</ref>

Very low calorie diets provide 200–800&nbsp;kcal/day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to [[starvation]] and produce an average weekly weight loss of 1.5–2.5&nbsp;kilograms (3.3–5.5&nbsp;lb). These diets are not recommended for general use as they are associated with [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effect]]s such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of [[gout]], and [[electrolyte imbalance]]s. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.<ref name=Strychar/>

== Exercise ==
{{See also|Physical exercise}}

With use, muscles consume energy derived from both fat and [[glycogen]]. Due to the large size of leg muscles, walking, running, and cycling are the most effective means of exercise to reduce body fat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gwinup G |title=Weight loss without dietary restriction: Efficacy of different forms of aerobic exercise |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=275–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3618879 |doi= 10.1177/036354658701500317}}</ref> Exercise affects macronutrient balance.

A [[meta-analysis]] of 43 [[randomized controlled trials]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found that exercising alone led to limited weight loss. In combination with diet, however, it resulted in a 1&nbsp;kilogram weight loss over dieting alone. A 1.5&nbsp;kilogram (3.3&nbsp;lb) loss was observed with a greater degree of exercise.<ref name="pmid17054187">{{cite journal |author=Shaw K, Gennat H, O'Rourke P, Del Mar C |title=Exercise for overweight or obesity |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |issue=4 |pages=CD003817 |year=2006 |pmid=17054187 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003817.pub3}}</ref>  Even though exercise as carried out in the general population has only modest effects, a [[Dose-response relationship|dose response curve]] is found, and very intense exercise can lead to substantial weight loss.

==Weight loss programs==
Weight loss programs often promote lifestyle changes and diet modification. This may involve eating smaller meals, cutting down on certain types of food, and making a conscious effort to exercise more. These programs also enable people to connect with a group of others who are attempting to lose weight, in the hopes that participants will form mutually motivating and encouraging relationships.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baron M |title=Commercial weight-loss programs |journal=Health Care Food Nutr Focus |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=8–9 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15559885 |doi= |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1090-2260&volume=21&issue=11&spage=8}}</ref>

A number of popular programs exist, including [[Weight Watchers]], [[Overeaters Anonymous]], and [[Jenny Craig, Inc.|Jenny Craig]]. These appear to provide modest weight loss (2.9&nbsp;kg, 6.4&nbsp;lb) over dieting on one's own (0.2&nbsp;kg, 0.4&nbsp;lb) over a two&nbsp;year period.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heshka S, Anderson JW, Atkinson RL, ''et al.'' |title=Weight loss with self-help compared with a structured commercial program: a randomized trial |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=14 |pages=1792–8 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12684357 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.14.1792 |url= }}</ref>  Internet-based programs appear to be ineffective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tsai AG, Wadden TA |title=Systematic review: an evaluation of major commercial weight loss programs in the United States |journal=Ann.

The [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] has introduced a number of "fat farms" where obese children go for reinforced exercise, and has passed a law which requires students to exercise or play sports for an hour a day at school (see [[Obesity in China]]).<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|author=Hewitt, Duncan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/760787.stm|title=China battles obesity|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=May 23, 2000|accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref><ref name="USA Today">{{cite news|author= MacLeod, Calum|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-01-08-chinese-obesity_x.htm|title=Obesity of China's kids stuns officials|work=[[USA Today]]|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref>

In addition to the popular mainstream programs mentioned above, there are a large number of diet products and programs available on the internet. These diet programs may be web based programs, or programs that are downloaded by the dieter. Many of these programs have very large followings and have been available for many years. Due to the nature of these programs it is difficult to determine how many people are actively following the system, or how effective the program is. In many cases these programs are authored by sports or nutrition experts. There are also many social websites that offer weight loss programs. These may be in the form of a free forum or a paid membership. One popular source is the social network [[Google Plus]]. On Google Plus, there are many circles that one can join related to weight loss, each with hundreds or even thousands of members. It is of no surprise that people in our age would turn to technology and search for diet solutions on their computers, laptops and smart phones.

Weight loss with these drugs is modest.

==Surgery==
{{Main|Bariatric surgery}}

[[Bariatric surgery]] ("weight loss surgery") is the use of surgical intervention in the treatment of obesity. As every operation may have complications, surgery is only recommended for severely obese people (BMI&nbsp;>&nbsp;40) who have failed to lose weight following dietary modification and pharmacological treatment. Weight loss surgery relies on various principles: the two most common approaches are reducing the volume of the stomach (e.g. by [[adjustable gastric band]]ing and [[Vertical banded gastroplasty surgery|vertical banded gastroplasty]]), which produces an earlier sense of satiation, and reducing the length of bowel that comes into contact with food ([[gastric bypass surgery]]), which directly reduces absorption. Band surgery is reversible, while bowel shortening operations are not. Some procedures can be performed [[laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]]. Complications from weight loss surgery are frequent.<ref name="pmid16862031">{{cite journal |author=Encinosa WE, Bernard DM, Chen CC, Steiner CA |title=Healthcare utilization and outcomes after bariatric surgery |journal=Medical care |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=706–12 |year=2006 |pmid=16862031 |doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000220833.89050.ed}}</ref>

Surgery for severe obesity is associated with long-term weight loss and decreased overall mortality. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending on the type of procedure performed) at 10&nbsp;years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures.<ref name="Sjöström L, Narbro K, Sjöström CD, et al. 2007 741–52"/>  A marked decrease in the risk of [[diabetes mellitus]], [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]] has also been found after bariatric surgery.<ref name="pmid17715408">{{cite journal |author=Sjöström L, Narbro K, Sjöström CD, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of bariatric surgery on mortality in Swedish obese subjects |journal=N.

In one study there was an unexplained increase in deaths from accidents and suicide, but this did not outweigh the benefit in terms of disease prevention.<ref name="pmid17715409"/>  When the two main techniques are compared, gastric bypass procedures are found to lead to 30% more weight loss than banding procedures one year after surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tice JA, Karliner L, Walsh J, Petersen AJ, Feldman MD |title=Gastric banding or bypass?

[[Ileojejunal bypass]], in which the digestive tract is rerouted to bypass the small intestine, was an experimental surgery designed as a remedy for morbid obesity.

The effects of [[liposuction]] on obesity are less well determined.  Some small studies show benefits<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giugliano G, Nicoletti G, Grella E, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of liposuction on insulin resistance and vascular inflammatory markers in obese women |journal=Br J Plast Surg |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=190–4 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15006519 |doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2003.12.010 |url=}}</ref> while others show none.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klein S, Fontana L, Young VL, ''et al.'' |title=Absence of an effect of liposuction on insulin action and risk factors for coronary heart disease |journal=N.

One type of balloon led to a weight loss of 5.7&nbsp;BMI units over 6&nbsp;months or 14.7&nbsp;kg (32.4&nbsp;lb).  Regaining lost weight is common after removal, however, and 4.2% of people were intolerant of the device.<ref name=balloon2008>{{cite journal |author=Imaz I, Martínez-Cervell C, García-Alvarez EE, Sendra-Gutiérrez JM, González-Enríquez J |title=Safety and effectiveness of the intragastric balloon for obesity.

# People with a BMI of over 30 should be counseled on diet, exercise and other relevant behavioral interventions, and set a realistic goal for weight loss.
# If these goals are not achieved, pharmacotherapy can be offered. The person needs to be informed of the possibility of [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] and the unavailability of long-term safety and efficacy data.
# Drug therapy may consist of [[sibutramine]], [[orlistat]], [[phentermine]], [[diethylpropion]], [[fluoxetine]], and [[bupropion]]. For more severe cases of obesity, stronger drugs such as [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]] may be used on a selective basis. Evidence is not sufficient to recommend [[sertraline]], [[topiramate]], or [[zonisamide]].
# In people with a BMI over 40 who fail to achieve their weight loss goals (with or without medication) and who develop obesity-related complications, referral for [[bariatric surgery]] may be indicated. The person needs to be aware of the potential complications.
# Those requiring bariatric surgery should be referred to high-volume referral centers, as the evidence suggests that surgeons who frequently perform these procedures have fewer complications.

A [[clinical practice guideline]] by the [[US Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) concluded that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine behavioral counseling to promote a [[healthy diet]] in unselected people in primary care settings, but that intensive behavioral dietary counseling is recommended in those with [[hyperlipidemia]] and other known risk factors for cardiovascular and diet-related chronic disease. Intensive counseling can be delivered by primary care clinicians or by referral to other specialists, such as nutritionists or dietitians.<ref name=paradox2003>{{cite journal |author= |title=Behavioral counseling in primary care to promote a healthy diet: recommendations and rationale |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=67 |issue=12 |pages=2573–6 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12825847 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030615/us.html |author1= U.S. Preventive Services Task Force }} {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref><ref name="pmid12554027">{{cite journal |author=Pignone MP, Ammerman A, Fernandez L, ''et al.'' |title=Counseling to promote a healthy diet in adults: A summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=75–92 |year=2003 |pmid=12554027| doi = 10.1016/S0749-3797(02)00580-9}}</ref>
