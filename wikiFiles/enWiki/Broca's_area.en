'''Broca's area''' is a region of the [[hominid]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Claudio Cantalupo & William D. Hopkins |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6863/abs/414505a.html |title=Nature Asymmetric Broca's area in great apes |journal=Nature |volume=414 |issue=505 |date=29 November 2001 |doi=10.1038/35107134 |pages=505}}</ref> [[brain]] with functions linked to [[speech production]].

The production of [[language]] has been linked to the Broca's area since [[Pierre Paul Broca]] reported impairments in two patients. They had lost the ability to speak after injury to the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the brain.<ref name="pmid17405763">{{cite journal | author=N. F. Dronkers, O. Plaisant, M. T. Iba-Zizen, and E. A. Cabanis | title=Paul Broca's Historic Cases: High Resolution MR Imaging of the Brains of Leborgne and Lelong| journal=Brain | year=2007| volume=130| pages=1432–1441 |pmid=17405763 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm042 | issue=Pt 5 }}</ref> Since then, the approximate region he identified has become known as Broca's area, and the deficit in language production as [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]]. Broca's area is now typically defined in terms of the [[pars opercularis]] and [[pars triangularis]] of the inferior frontal [[gyrus]], represented in [[Korbinian Brodmann|Brodmann's]] [[Brodmann area|cytoarchitectonic map]] as areas [[Brodmann area 44|44]] and [[Brodmann area 45|45]] of the dominant hemisphere.<ref name="pmid17405763" /> Studies of chronic aphasia have implicated an essential role of Broca's area in various speech and language functions. Further, functional [[MRI]] studies have also identified activation patterns in Broca's area associated with various language tasks. However, slow destruction of the Broca's area by brain [[tumor]]s can leave speech relatively intact suggesting its functions can shift to nearby areas in the brain.<ref name="Plaza">{{cite journal | pmid = 19274574 | doi=10.1080/13554790902729473 | volume=15 | issue=4 | title=Speaking without Broca's area after tumor resection | year=2009 | month=August | author=Plaza M, Gatignol P, Leroy M, Duffau H | journal=Neurocase | pages=294–310}}</ref>

==Anatomy and connectivity==
[[File:Brodmann Cytoarchitectonics 44.png|left|120 px|[[Brodmann area 44]].]]
Broca's area is often identified by visual inspection of the [[topography]] of the brain either by macrostructural landmarks such as [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] or by the specification of coordinates in a particular reference space. The currently used Talairach and Tournoux atlas projects [[Korbinian Brodmann|Brodmann's]] [[Brodmann area|cytoarchitectonic map]] onto a template brain. Because Brodmann's parcelation was based on subjective visual inspection of cytoarchitectonic borders and also Brodmann analyzed only one hemisphere of one brain, the result is imprecise. Further, because of considerable variability across brains in terms of shape, size, and position relative to sulcal and gyral structure, a resulting localization precision is limited.<ref name="pmid18930695">{{cite journal | author=Yosef Grodzinsky and Andrea Santi| title=The Battle for Broca's Region | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences| year=2008| volume=12| issue=12| pages=474–480 |pmid=18930695 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.09.001}}</ref>

Nevertheless, Broca's area in the left hemisphere and its homologue in the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] are designations usually used to refer to [[pars triangularis]] (PTr) and [[pars opercularis]] (POp) of the inferior frontal [[gyrus]]. The PTr and POp are defined by structural landmarks that only probabilistically divide the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] into anterior and posterior cytoarchitectonic areas of 45 and 44, respectively, by [[Brodmann]]'s classification scheme.<ref name="pmid17533001">{{cite journal | author=Jeremy I. Skipper, Susan Goldin-Meadow, Howard C. Nusbaum, and Steven L. Small| title=Speech-associated gestures, Broca's area, and the human mirror system | journal=Brain and Language| year=2007| volume=101| pages=260–277 |pmid=17533001 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2007.02.008 | issue=3 | pmc=2703472}}</ref>

Area 45 receives more [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent connections]] from prefrontal cortex, the superior temporal [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|gyrus]], and the superior temporal [[gyrus (neuroanatomy)|sulcus]], compared to area 44, which tends to receive more afferent connections from motor, [[somatosensory]], and inferior parietal regions.<ref name="pmid17533001" />

The differences between area 45 and 44 in cytoarchitecture and in connectivity suggest that these areas might perform different functions. Indeed, recent [[neuroimaging]] studies have shown that the PTr and Pop, corresponding to areas 45 and 44, respectively, play different functional roles in the human with respect to language comprehension and action recognition/understanding.<ref name="pmid17533001" />

==Broca's area revisited==
[[File:Brodmann Cytoarchitectonics 45.png|right|120px|[[Brodmann area 45]].]]
In a recent study, the preserved brains of both Leborgne and Lelong (patients of Broca) were reinspected using high-resolution volumetric [[MRI]]. The purpose of this study was to scan the brains in three dimensions and to identify the extent of both cortical and subcortical lesions in more detail. The study also sought to locate the exact site of the lesion in the frontal lobe in relation to what is now called Broca's area with the extent of subcortical involvement.<ref name="pmid17405763" />

===Broca's patients===

====Leborgne====

Leborgne was a patient of Broca's. Almost completely unable to produce any words or phrases, he was able to repetitively produce only the word ''tan''. After his death, a lesion was discovered on the surface of the left frontal lobe.

====Lelong====

Lelong was another patient of Broca's. He also exhibited reduced productive speech. He could only say five words, 'yes,' 'no,' 'three,' 'always,' and 'lelo' (a mispronunciation of his own name). At autopsy, a lesion was also found in the same region of lateral frontal lobe as in Leborgne. These two cases led Broca to believe that speech was localized to this particular area.

===MRI findings===

Examination of the brains of Broca's two historic patients with high-resolution [[MRI]] has produced several interesting findings. First, the MRI findings suggest that other areas besides Broca's area may also have contributed to the patients' reduced productive speech. This finding is significant because it has been found that, though [[lesions]] to Broca's area alone can possibly cause temporary speech disruption, they do not result in severe speech arrest. Therefore, there is a possibility that the [[aphasia]] denoted by Broca as an absence of productive speech also could have been influenced by the lesions in the other region. Another interesting finding is that the region, which was once considered to be critical for speech by Broca, is not precisely the same region as what is now known as Broca's area. This study provides further evidence to support the claim that language and cognition are far more complicated than once thought and involve various networks of brain regions.

===Speaking without Broca's area===

The essential role of the Broca's area  in speech production has been questioned since it can be destroyed while leaving language nearly intact. In one case of a computer engineer, a slow-growing [[glioma]] was removed. The tumor and the surgery destroyed the left [[inferior frontal gyrus|inferior]] and [[middle frontal gyrus]], the head of the [[caudate nucleus]], the anterior limb of the [[internal capsule]], and the anterior [[Insular cortex|insula]]. However, there were minimal language problems three months after removal and the individual returned to his professional work. These minor problems include the inability to create syntactically complex sentences including more than two subjects, multiple causal [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s, or [[reported speech]]. These were explained by researchers as due to [[working memory]] problems. They also attributed his lack of problems to extensive compensatory mechanisms enabled by [[neural plasticity]] in the nearby cerebral cortex and a shift of some functions to the homologous area in the right hemisphere.<ref name="Plaza"/>

==Functions==

===Language comprehension===

For a long time, it was assumed that the role of Broca's area was more devoted to language production than language comprehension. However, recent evidence demonstrates that Broca's area also plays a significant role in language comprehension. Patients with [[lesions]] in Broca's area who exhibit agrammatical speech production also show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences.<ref name="pmid16881251">{{cite journal | author=David Caplan  | title=Why is Broca's Area Involved in Syntax?| journal=Cortex | year=2006| volume=42| pages=469–471 |pmid=16881251 | issue=4 | doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70379-4}}</ref> Also, a number of neuroimaging studies have implicated an involvement of Broca's area, particularly of the [[pars opercularis]] of the left inferior frontal [[gyrus]], during the processing of complex sentences.<ref name="pmid15929098">{{cite journal | author=Tanja Crewe, Ina Bornkessel, Stefan Zysset, Richard Wiese, D. Yves von Cramon, and Matthias Schlesewksy | title=The Emergence of the Unmarked: A New Perspective on the Language-Specific Function of Broca's Area| journal=Human Brain Mapping | year=2005| volume=26| pages=178–190 |pmid=15929098 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20154 | issue=3}}</ref> Further, it has recently been found in functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) experiments involving highly ambiguous sentences result in a more activated inferior frontal [[gyrus]].<ref name="pmid17533001" /> Therefore, the activity level in the inferior frontal gyrus and the level of lexical ambiguity are directly proportional to each other, because of the increased retrieval demands associated with highly ambiguous content.

===Action recognition and production===

Recent experiments have indicated that Broca's area is involved in various cognitive and perceptual tasks. One important contribution of [[Brodmann]]'s area 44 is also found in the motor-related processes. Observation of meaningful hand shadows resembling moving animals activates frontal language area, demonstrating that Broca's area indeed plays a role in interpreting action of others.<ref name="pmid18633777">{{cite journal | author=Luciano Fadiga, Laila Craighero, Maddalena Fabbri Destro, Livio Finos, Nathalie Cotilon-Williams, Andrew T. Smith, and Umberto Castiello| title=Language in Shadow| journal=Social Neuroscience| year=2006| volume=1| issue=2| pages=77–89 |pmid=18633777 |doi=10.1080/17470910600976430}}</ref>  An activation of BA 44 was also reported during execution of grasping and manipulation.<ref name="pmid16881255">{{cite journal | author=Luciano Fadiga and Laila Craighero  | title=Hand Actions and Speech Representation In Broca's Area| journal=Cortex| year=2006| volume=42| pages=486–490 |pmid=16881255 | issue=4 | doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70383-6}}</ref>

===Speech-associated gestures===
It has been speculated that because speech-associated gestures could possibly reduce lexical or sentential ambiguity, comprehension should improve in the presence of speech-associated gestures. As a result of improved comprehension, the involvement of Broca's area should be reduced.<ref name="pmid17533001" />

Many neuroimaging studies have also shown activation of Broca's area when representing meaningful arm gestures. A recent study has shown evidence that word and gesture are related at the level of translation of particular gesture aspects such as its [[motor goal]] and intention.<ref name="pmid16839281">{{cite journal | author=Maurizio Gentilucci, Paolo Bernardis, Girolamo Crisi, and Riccardo Dalla Volta| title=Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of Broca's Area Affects Verbal Responses to Gesture Observation | journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience| year=2006| volume=18| issue=7| pages=1059–1074 |pmid=16839281 |doi=10.1162/jocn.2006.18.7.1059}}</ref> This finding that aspects of gestures are translated in words within Broca's area also explains language development in terms of evolution. Indeed, many authors have proposed that speech evolved from a primitive communication that arose from gestures.<ref name="pmid18633777" /><ref name="pmid12653308">{{cite journal | author=Philip Lieberman | title=On the Nature and Evolution of the Neural Bases of Human Language | journal=Yearbook of Physical Anthropology| year=2002| volume=45| pages=36–62 |pmid=12653308}}</ref> (See below.)

==Aphasia==

[[Aphasia]] is an acquired language disorder affecting all modalities such as writing, reading, speaking, and listening and results from brain damage. It is often a chronic condition that creates changes in all areas of one's life.<ref name="Ref4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlantaaphasia.org|title=What is Aphasia|accessdate=2008-12-01|publisher=Atlanta Aphasia Association |year=2006}}</ref>
''

===Expressive aphasia vs. other aphasias===

Patients with [[Expressive aphasia]], also known as '''Broca's aphasia''', are individuals who know "what they want to say, they just cannot get it out." <ref name="Ref4" /> They are typically able to comprehend words, and sentences with a simple syntactic structure (see above), but are more or less unable to generate fluent speech. Other symptoms that may be present include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing.<ref name="pmid17405763" />

This specific group of symptoms distinguishes those who have expressive aphasia from individuals with other types of aphasia.  There are several distinct "types" of aphasia, and each type is characterized by a different set of language deficits.  While those who have expressive aphasia tend to retain good spoken language comprehension, other types of aphasia can render patients completely unable to understand any language at all, unable to understand any spoken language ([[Auditory verbal agnosia]]),<ref name="Metz-Lutz_etal_1984">{{cite journal |author=Metz-Lutz MN, Dahl E |title=Analysis of word comprehension in a case of pure word deafness |journal=Brain Lang |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=13–25 |year=1984 |month=September |pmid=6478188 |doi=10.1016/0093-934X(84)90002-6 |url=}}</ref><ref name="Slevc_etal_2011">{{cite journal |author=Slevc LR, Martin RC, Hamilton AC, Joanisse MF |title=Speech perception, rapid temporal processing, and the left hemisphere: a case study of unilateral pure word deafness |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=216–30 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21093464 |pmc=3031136 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.11.009 |url=}}</ref><ref name=Poeppel_2001>{{cite journal|last=Poeppel|first=David|title=Pure word deafness and the bilateral processing of the speech code|journal=Cognitive Science|date=1 September 2001|volume=25|issue=5|pages=679–693|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2505_3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog2505_3/abstract}}</ref> while still other types preserve language comprehension, but with deficits.  People with expressive aphasia may struggle less with reading and writing (see [[alexia]]) than those with other types of aphasia.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  While individuals with expressive aphasia tend to have a good ability to self-monitor their language output (they "hear what they say" and make corrections), other types of aphasics can seem entirely unaware of their language deficits.

In the classical sense, Expressive aphasia is the result of injury to Broca's area; it is often the case that lesions in specific brain areas cause specific, [[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociable]] symptoms,<ref name="aphasiafacts">{{cite web|url=http://www.aphasia.org/Aphasia%20Facts/aphasia_facts.html|title=The National Aphasia Foundation|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref> although case studies show there is not always a one-to-one mapping between lesion location and aphasic symptoms.<ref name="Slevc_etal_2011" /> The correlation between damage to certain specific brain areas (usually in the left hemisphere) and the development of specific types of aphasia makes it possible to deduce (albeit very roughly) the location of a suspected brain lesion based only on the presence (and severity) of a certain type of aphasia, though this is complicated by the possibility that a patient may have damage to a number of brain areas and may exhibit symptoms of more than one type of aphasia. The examination of lesion data in order to deduce which brain areas are essential in the normal functioning of certain aspects of cognition is called the deficit-lesion method; this method is especially important in the branch of [[neuroscience]] known as [[aphasiology]].  [[Cognitive science]] - to be specific, [[cognitive neuropsychology]] - are branches of neuroscience that also make extensive use of the deficit-lesion method.<ref name="cogsci">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wGti6_4Qn_QC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=cognitive+science+deficit-lesion#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Cognitive science: an introduction to the study of mind|accessdate=January, 2011|isbn=978-1-4129-2568-6|author1=Friedenberg|first1=Jay|last2=Silverman|first2=Gordon|date=2005-09-12}}</ref>

==Evolution of language==

The pursuit of a satisfying theory that addresses the [[origin of language]] in humans has led to the consideration of a number of evolutionary "models."  These models attempt to show how modern language might have evolved, and a common feature of many of these theories is the idea that vocal [[communication]] was initially used to complement a far more dominant mode of communication through gesture.  Human language might have [[evolution|evolved]] as the "evolutionary refinement of an implicit communication system already present in lower primates, based on a set of hand/mouth goal-directed action representations."<ref name="pmid18633777" />
"Hand/mouth goal-directed action representations" is another way of saying "gestural communication", "gestural language", or "communication through body language."  The recent finding that Broca's area is active when people are observing others engaged in meaningful action is evidence in support of this idea.  It was hypothesized that a precursor to the modern Broca's area was involved in translating gestures into abstract ideas by interpreting the movements of others as meaningful action with an intelligent purpose. It is argued that over time the ability to predict the intended outcome and purpose of a set of movements eventually gave this area the capability to deal with truly abstract ideas, and therefore (eventually) became capable of associating sounds (words) with abstract meanings. The observation that frontal language areas are activated when people observe [[Hand Shadows]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fadiga L, Craighero L, Destro MF, ''et al.'' |title=Language in shadow |journal=Soc Neurosci |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=77–89 |year=2006 |pmid=18633777 |doi=10.1080/17470910600976430 |url=}}</ref> is further evidence that human language may have evolved from existing neural substrates that evolved for the purpose of gesture recognition.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Corballis MC |title=From mouth to hand: gesture, speech, and the evolution of right-handedness |journal=Behav Brain Sci |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=199–208; discussion 208–60 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=14621511 |doi= 10.1017/S0140525X03000062|url=}}</ref>  The study, therefore, claims that Broca's area is the "motor center for speech", which assembles and decodes speech sounds in the same way it interprets body language and gestures. Consistent with this idea is that the neural substrate that regulated motor control in the common ancestor of apes and humans was most likely modified to enhance cognitive and linguistic ability.<ref name="pmid12653308" />  Studies of deaf "speakers" of [[American Sign Language]] and English speakers suggest that the human brain recruited systems that had evolved to perform more basic functions much earlier; these various brain circuits, according to the authors, were tapped to work together in creating language.<ref name="new">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100429173005.htm|title=Sign Language Study Shows Multiple Brain Regions Wired For Language|accessdate=January, 2011}}</ref>

Another recent finding has showed significant areas of activation in subcortical and neocortical areas during the production of communicative manual gestures and vocal signals in chimpanzees.<ref name="pmid18308569">{{cite journal | author=Jared P. Taglialatela, Jamie L. Russell, Jennifer A. Schaeffer, and William D.

More recently, the neocortical distribution of activity-dependent gene expression in marmosets provided direct evidence that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which comprises Broca's area in humans and has been associated with auditory processing of species-specific vocalizations and orofacial control in macaques, is engaged during vocal output in a New World monkey.<ref name="pmid20953246">{{cite journal |author=Simões CS, Vianney PV, de Moura MM, Freire MA, Mello LE, Sameshima K, Araújo JF, Nicolelis MA, Mello CV, Ribeiro S. |title=Activation of frontal neocortical areas by vocal production in marmosets |journal=Front Integr Neurosci. |volume=4 |id= PII123 |year=2010 |pmid=20953246 |doi=10.3389/fnint.2010.00123 |url= |pmc=2955454 |pages=123}}</ref><ref name="pmid21179582">{{cite journal |author=Miller CT, Dimauro A, Pistorio A, Hendry S, Wang X. |title=Vocalization Induced CFos Expression in Marmoset Cortex |journal=Front Integr Neurosci. |volume=4 |id=PII 128 |year=2010 |pmid=21179582 |doi=10.3389/fnint.2010.00128 |url= |page=128 |pmc=3004388}}</ref> These findings putatively set the origin of vocalization-related neocortical circuits to at least 35 million years ago, when the Old and New World monkey lineages split.
