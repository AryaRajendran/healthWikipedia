The Intranasal Insulin Trial ('''INIT II''') began in late 2006, and is being run by an Australian non-profit organization, the Diabetes Vaccine Development Centre (DVDC).  The aim of the trial is to test a new preventative treatment for [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] in young people who are at risk of developing this condition.

INIT II is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre [[clinical trial]], which will determine whether intranasal [[insulin]] can delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes in children and young adults at risk.

==Background==
===Pre-clinical Evidence===
There is evidence from a mouse model of type 1 diabetes that the administration of intranasal insulin can reduce the immune attack on the insulin-producing [[beta cells]] of the pancreas, thus acting as a vaccine against the condition.  In pre-clinical tests, insulin was administered onto the nasal mucosa of mice with a genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes.  This caused the induction of regulatory T-cells, which were protective against the destruction of beta cells in the mice.<ref>[http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/184/6/2167 Harrison et al. (1996) J Exp Med 184, 2167-2174]</ref>

===INIT I===
The predecessor of INIT II, the INIT I trial was designed to test safety.  38 individuals were treated with either intranasal insulin spray or placebo, daily for 10 days, and then 2 days a week for 6 months.  The trial showed that intranasal insulin does not accelerate the onset of diabetes.  An immune effect was also observed in children and young adults at risk of type 1 diabetes.  Intranasal insulin produced effects that suggested a change in the immune attack on the insulin-producing beta cells.<ref>[http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/27/10/2348 Harrison et al. (2004) Diabetes Care 27, 2348-2355.]</ref>

==Trial design==
Based on the success of INIT I, the INIT II trial will test whether intranasal insulin can delay or prevent type 1 diabetes in a larger population.

===Eligibility===
A significant feature of the INIT II trial is the recruitment of people at risk for type 1 diabetes. The trial requires 120 participants, aged between 4 and 30.  To enter the treatment arm of the trial, participants must have two or more antibodies (against insulin, [[L-glutamic acid decarboxylase|GAD65]], and tyrosine phosphatase-like insulinoma antigen 2), but a normal response in a [[glucose tolerance test]].  This indicates that they are at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes, but significant destruction of the pancreatic beta cells has not yet occurred.

To find enough eligible people, relatives of people with type 1 diabetes are screened for antibodies.  Those who are positive undergo a glucose tolerance test to make sure they do not already have diabetes.  Although type 1 diabetes can be [[Heredity|hereditary]], the probability that a family member of someone with type 1 diabetes will meet the criteria to enter the trial is only around 2-3%.  It is therefore expected that over 12,000 people will need to be screened.

===Treatment arm===
After screening, participants are staged into a treatment arm. One group receives placebo solution, and the other receives a solution that contains 440IU of insulin. The treatment is self-administered using a nasal spray every morning for 7 consecutive days, and then once a week for 12 months. During this time, participants are monitored every three months, then every six months for a further four years.

The trial is taking place at a number of centers across Australia, New Zealand and Germany including,
*Mater Children’s Hospital, Brisbane
*Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Adelaide
*Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth
*Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne
*Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne
*The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney
*Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney
*Canberra Hospital, Canberra
*[[Liggins Institute]], Auckland, New Zealand
*Forschergruppe Diabetes der TU Műnchen

===Endpoint===
The primary [[clinical endpoint]] of INIT II is the development of type 1 diabetes.  This is expected to be lower in participants who were exposed to insulin.
