The '''British Nutrition Foundation''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]].<ref>{{EW charity|251681}}</ref><ref>{{Scottish charity|SC040061}}</ref>

==History==
It was founded in 1967 by Professor Alastair Frazer. In 1973 it held its first annual conference. It is based between [[Holborn tube station|Holborn]] and [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]] tube stations. The BNF educational programme, ''Food - a fact of life'', was launched in 1991.

==Aims==
According to its entry in the Charity Commission's register, the aims of the British Nutrition Foundation are:
#to advance the education of the public, and those involved in the training and education of others, in nutrition; and
#to advance the study of and research into nutrition for the public benefit, and to disseminate and publish the useful results of such research.<ref name=CharityCommission>{{Cite web|url= http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=251681&SubsidiaryNumber=0|title= Charity framework|publisher= [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}</ref>

==Operations==
The BNF's team of nutrition scientists conduct academic reviews of published research on issues of diet and public health.<ref name=BNFScienceProg>{{cite web|title=Science Programme|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do?start=2|publisher=British Nutrition Foundation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> They present their reports in the BNF's Nutrition Bulletin, as well as various Task Force reports, intended for both academic and lay dissemination<ref name=BNFScienceProg/>. The BNF also organises educational programs designed to provide accessible information on diet and health for children and young people, aged 3-16+ years.<ref name=BNFEducation>{{cite web|title=Education Programme|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do?start=1|publisher=British Nutrition Foundation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> The BNF's education website, foodafactoflife.org.uk, provides teaching and learning resources about food and nutrition.<ref name=BNFEducation/>

The BNF receives funding for its projects from a variety of sources, including contracts with the European Commission, national government departments and agencies; food producers and manufacturers, retailers and food service companies; grant providing bodies, trusts and other charities.<ref name=BNFWhoWeAre>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do|title= Who we are, what we do|year= 2009|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Concerns have been raised about the BNF's close relationship with the food industry.<ref name=BMJSpinwatch>{{Cite web|url=http://spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/40-pr-industry/5353-independence-of-nutritional-information-the-british-nutrition-foundation|title= Independence of nutritional information?|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]]|location= London|accessdate= 23 February 2012}}</ref> The BNF receives funding from almost every large food manufacturer and distributor in the UK, including [[Tate and Lyle]], [[Nestle]], [[PepsiCo]], [[McDonalds]] and [[Sainsburys]].

Furthermore, Paul Hebblethwaite, a member of the BNF board of trustees and its former chairman, has had "a distinguished career in the food industry working for a number of major companies including [[Cadbury-Schweppes]] and [[Chivers-Hartley]]".<ref name=BNFNews>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/288_Issue%2047%20Spring%202009.pdf|title= BNF News|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London}}</ref> He is also chairman of the Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Trade Association.<ref name=BNFNews/> Many other members of the organisationâ€™s board of trustees and oversight committees are or have been employees of the food industry.<ref name=BNFReport09>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/330_BNF%20Annual%20Report%202008%2009.pdf|title= Annual Report and Accounts|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London}}</ref>

The BNF is open about its intention to shape UK Government policy on food,<ref name=BNFWhoWeAre/> and this has led to concerns that it is serving as a lobbying group for the food industry which largely funds it<ref name=BMJSpinwatch/>. Derek Shrimpton, former director general, has been quoted as saying: "In the period I was there the foundation was solely taken up with defence actions for the industry." He said that the foundation had been constantly engaged in frustrating government committees aiming to recommend reductions in sugars, salt, and fats.<ref name=CannonG>{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=G|title=The Politics of Food|year=1997|publisher=Century|location=London|pages=356}}</ref>
