==Cause==
Pathological phimosis (as opposed to the natural non-retractability of the foreskin in childhood) is rare and the causes are varied. Some cases may arise from [[balanitis]] (inflammation of the glans penis), perhaps due in turn to inappropriate efforts to retract an infant's foreskin. Other cases of non-retractile foreskin may be caused by preputial [[stenosis]] or narrowness that prevents retraction, by fusion of the foreskin with the glans penis in children, or by [[frenulum breve]], which prevents retraction. In some cases a cause may not be clear, or it may be difficult to distinguish physiological phimosis from pathological if an infant appears to be in pain with urination or has obvious ballooning of the foreskin with urination or apparent discomfort. However, ballooning does not indicate urinary obstruction.<ref name="Babu2004">{{cite journal |author=Babu R, Harrison SK, Hutton KA |title=Ballooning of the foreskin and physiological phimosis: is there any objective evidence of obstructed voiding? |journal=BJU Int. |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=384–387 |year=2004 |pmid=15291873 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2004.04935.x |url=}}</ref>

Phimosis in older children and adults can vary in severity, with some men able to retract their foreskin partially ('relative phimosis'), and some completely unable to retract their foreskin even in the flaccid state ('full phimosis').

When phimosis develops in an adult who was previously able to retract his foreskin, it is nearly always due to a pathological cause, and is far more likely to cause problems for the man.

Beaugé noted that unusual [[masturbation]] practices, such as lying face down on a bed and rubbing the penis against the mattress, may cause phimosis. Patients are advised to stop exacerbating masturbation techniques and are encouraged to masturbate by moving the foreskin up and down so as to mimic more closely the action of [[sexual intercourse]]. After giving this advice Beaugé noted not once did he have to recommend circumcision.<ref name="Beauge1997"/><ref name="Beauge1991">{{cite journal | last = Beaugé | first = Michel | year = 1991 | month = | title = Conservative Treatment of Primary Phimosis in Adolescents | journal = Faculty of Medicine, Saint-Antoine University | url = http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge/}}</ref>

One cause of acquired, pathological phimosis is chronic [[balanitis xerotica obliterans]] (BXO), a skin condition of unknown origin that causes a whitish ring of indurated tissue (a [[cicatrix]]) to form near the tip of the prepuce. This inelastic tissue prevents retraction. Infectious, inflammatory, and hormonal factors have all been implicated or proposed as contributing factors.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

Phimosis may occur after other types of chronic inflammation (such as [[balanoposthitis]]), repeated [[Urinary catheterization|catheterization]], or forcible foreskin retraction.<ref name="Cantu">Cantu Jr. S. {{eMedicine|emerg|423|Phimosis and paraphimosis}}</ref>

Phimosis may also arise in untreated diabetics due to the presence of glucose in their urine giving rise to infection in the foreskin.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bromage |first=Stephen J. |authorlink= |coauthors=Anne  Crump and Ian  Pearce |year= 2008|month= |title=Phimosis as a presenting feature of diabetes |journal=BJU International |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=338–340 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07274.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118508219/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18005214 }}</ref>

==Management==
Phimosis in infancy is nearly always physiological, and needs to be treated only if it is causing obvious problems such as urinary discomfort or obstruction. In older children and men, phimosis should be distinguished from [[frenulum breve]], which more often requires surgery, though the two conditions can occur together.

If phimosis in older children or adults is not causing acute and severe problems, nonsurgical measures may be effective. Choice of treatment is often determined by whether the patient (or doctor) views circumcision as an option of last resort to be avoided or as the preferred course. Some men with non-retractile foreskins have no difficulties and see no need for correction.

Non surgical methods include:

* Application of topical [[steroid]] cream, such as [[betamethasone]], for 4–6 weeks to the narrow part of the foreskin is relatively simple, less expensive than surgical treatments and highly effective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Esposito C, Centonze A, Alicchio F, Savanelli A, Settimi A |title=Topical steroid application versus circumcision in pediatric patients with phimosis: a prospective randomized placebo controlled clinical trial |journal=World J Urol |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=187–90 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18157674 |doi=10.1007/s00345-007-0231-2 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/14844u402164w261/?p=3bc89d1b5b1f403dbdef113912497296&pi=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Zampieri N, Corroppolo M, Zuin V, Bianchi S, Camoglio FS |title=Phimosis and topical steroids: new clinical findings |journal=Pediatr.

Skin that is under tension expands by growing additional cells. A permanent increase in size occurs by gentle stretching over a period of time. The treatment is non-traumatic and non-destructive. Manual stretching may be carried out without the aid of a medical doctor. The [[tissue expansion]] promotes the growth of new skin cells to permanently expand the narrow [[preputial ring]] that prevents retraction. Beaugé treated several hundred adolescents by advising them to change their masturbation habits to closing their hand over their penis and moving it back and forth. Retraction of the foreskin was generally achieved after four weeks and he stated that he never had to refer one for surgery.<ref name="Beauge1997"/><ref name="Beauge1991"/>

Surgical methods range from the complete removal of the foreskin to more minor operations to relieve foreskin tightness:
* [[Circumcision]] is sometimes performed for pathological phimosis, and is effective.
* [[Dorsal slit]] (superincision) is a single incision along the upper length of the foreskin from the tip to the corona, exposing the glans without removing any tissue.
* Ventral slit (subterincision) is an incision along the lower length of the foreskin from the tip of the frenulum to the base of the glans, removing the frenulum in the process.  Often used when [[frenulum breve]] occurs alongside the phimosis.
* [[Preputioplasty]], in which a limited dorsal slit with transverse closure is made along the constricting band of skin<ref name="Cuckow1994">{{cite journal |author=Cuckow PM, Rix G, Mouriquand PD |title=Preputial plasty: a good alternative to circumcision |journal=J.

==Prognosis==
The most acute complication is [[paraphimosis]]. In this condition, the glans is swollen and painful, and the foreskin is immobilized by the swelling in a partially retracted position. The proximal penis is flaccid.

==Epidemiology==

A number of medical reports of phimosis incidence have been published over the years. They vary widely because of the difficulties of distinguishing physiological phimosis (developmental nonretractility) from pathological phimosis, definitional differences, ascertainment problems, and the multiple additional influences on post-neonatal circumcision rates in cultures where most newborn males are circumcised.  A commonly cited incidence statistic for pathological phimosis is 1% of uncircumcised males.<ref name="Cantu" /><ref name="Shankar1999">{{cite journal |author=Shankar KR, Rickwood AM |title=The incidence of phimosis in boys |journal=BJU Int. |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=101–102 |year=1999 |pmid=10444134 |doi= 10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.00147.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1464-4096&date=1999&volume=84&issue=1&spage=101}} This study gives a low incidence of pathological phimosis (0.6% of uncircumcised boys by age 15 years) by asserting that [[balanitis xerotica obliterans]] is the only indisputable type of pathological phimosis and anything else should be assumed "physiological".

==History==
*According to some accounts, phimosis prevented [[Louis XVI of France]] from impregnating his wife for the first seven years of their marriage. She was 14 and he was 15 when they married in 1770. However, the presence and nature of his genital anomaly is not considered certain, and some scholars (such as [[Vincent Cronin]] and Simone Bertiere) assert that surgical repair would have been mentioned in the records of his medical treatments if it had indeed occurred.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
*U.S. president [[James A. Garfield|James Garfield]] was assassinated by [[Charles J. Guiteau|Charles Guiteau]] in 1881. Guiteau's autopsy report indicated that he had phimosis.
