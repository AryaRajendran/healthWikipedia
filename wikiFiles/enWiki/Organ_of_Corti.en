The '''organ of Corti''', found only in [[mammal]]s, is part of the [[cochlea]] of the [[inner ear]] and is provided with [[hair cell]]s or auditory sensory cells. <ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/organ%20of%20corti Definition of Organ of Corti] - ''Merriam Webster'' - Retrieved 30 April 2012.</ref> It evolved from the [[basilar papilla]] found in all [[tetrapods]], except for a few derived species that have lost it. <ref>[http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC3097286/ Dissecting the molecular basis of organ of Corti development]</ref> 

The organ was named after the Italian anatomist Marquis [[Alfonso Giacomo Gaspare Corti]] (1822–1876), who conducted microscopic research of the mammalian auditory system.

==Structure and functions==
The organ of Corti has highly specialized structures that respond to fluid-borne vibrations in the [[cochlea]] with a shearing vector in the hairs of some cochlear hair cells. It contains between 15,000-20,000 auditory nerve receptors. Each receptor has its own hair cell. The shear on the hairs opens non-selective transduction [[ion channel]]s that are permeable to potassium and calcium, leading to hair cell plasma membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels at the synaptic basolateral pole of the cells which triggers vesicle exocytosis and liberation of glutamate neurotransmitter to the synaptic cleft and electrical signaling to the [[auditory cortex]] via spiral ganglion neurons.  The [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] and [[middle ear]] act as mechanical transformers and amplifiers, so that by the time sound waves reach the organ of Corti, their pressure amplitude is 22 times that of the air impinging on the pinna.  The organ of Corti can be damaged by excessive sound levels, leading to [[noise health effects|noise-induced health effects]]. The organ of Corti is the structure that transduces pressure waves to action potentials. The organ of Corti sits inside the cochlear duct, between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani. The basilar membrane on the scala tympani presses against the hair cells of the organ as perilymphatic pressure waves pass.

==Hearing loss==

{{main|Hearing impairment}}

The most common kind of hearing impairment, [[sensorineural hearing loss]], includes as one major cause the reduction of function in the organ of Corti.  Specifically, the active amplification function of the [[outer hair cell]]s is very sensitive to damage from exposure to trauma from overly-loud sounds or to certain [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic]] drugs.  Once outer hair cells are damaged, they do not regenerate, and the result is a loss of sensitivity and an abnormally large growth of loudness (known as ''recruitment'') in the part of the spectrum that the damaged cells serve.<ref>{{cite book | title = Medical-Legal Evaluation of Hearing Loss | author = Robert A.

While hearing loss has always been considered irreversible in mammals, fish and birds routinely repair such damage. A recent study has shown that the use of particular drugs may reactivate genes normally expressed only during hair cell development. The research was carried out at [[Harvard Medical School]], the [[Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary]], and the [[Keio University]] School of Medicine in Japan.<ref>[http://beyondthedish.wordpress.com/tag/cochlear-hair-cells/ Drug Induces Hearing Restoration in Rodents]</ref>
