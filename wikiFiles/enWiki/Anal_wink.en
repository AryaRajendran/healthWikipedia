The '''anal wink''', '''anal reflex''', '''perineal reflex''', or '''anocutaneous reflex''' is the [[reflex]]ive contraction of the external [[anal sphincter]] upon stroking of the skin around the anus. 

A noxious or tactile stimulus will cause a wink contraction of the [[anal]] [[sphincter muscle]]s and also flexion. The stimulus is detected by the [[nociceptor]]s in the [[perineal]] skin to the [[pudendal nerve]], where a response is integrated by the [[spinal cord]] [[sacral segment]]s S2-S4.

The absence of this reflex indicates that there is an interruption of the [[reflex arc]], which may be in the sensory [[afferent limb]] or the motor [[efferent limb]]. The [[synapse]] between the afferent and efferent limbs occurs in the lowest sacral segments of the [[spinal cord]].
