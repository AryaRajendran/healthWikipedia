A '''Cervical pregnancy''' is an [[ectopic pregnancy]] that has implanted in the uterine [[endocervix]].<ref name=rad>{{Cite journal|author= Lin EP, Bhatt S, Dogra VS. | title= Diagnostic clues to ectopic pregnancy.  |journal=Radiographics. |pmid=18936028|year= 2008|volume= 28|issue= 6|pages= 1661–71|doi= 10.1148/rg.286085506}}</ref> Such a pregnancy typically aborts within the first [[pregnancy|trimester]], however, if it is implanted closer to the uterine cavity - a so-called cervico-isthmic pregnancy - it may continue longer.<ref name=ogs>{{Cite journal|author= Avery DM, Wells MA, Harper DM. | title= Cervico-isthmic corporeal pregnancy with delivery at term: a review of the literature with a case report |journal=Obstet Gynecol Surv. |pmid=19386140|year= 2009|volume= 64|issue= 5|pages= 335–44|doi= 10.1097/OGX.0b013e31819f95ff}}</ref> [[Placenta]]l removal in a cervical pregnancy may result in major hemorrhage.

Pregnancies involving the isthmus - the segment of the [[uterus]] between the cervix and the fundus - are more common than true cervical pregnancies.<ref name=ogs/> While in many situations the cause of the abnormal [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] remains unclear, there is evidence to link the development of cervical pregnancy to uterine instrumentation, specifically repeated D&Cs ([[dilatation and curettage]]).<ref name=og/><ref name=mig/> Cervical pregnancies are to be distinguished from pregnancies that start from an implantation in a scar of a previous [[cesarean section]], so-called ''scar pregnancies''.<ref name=rad/>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made in asymptomatic pregnant women either by inspection seeing a bluish discolored [[cervix]] or, more commonly, by [[obstetric ultrasonography]]. A typical [[non-specific symptom]] is [[vaginal bleeding]] during pregnancy. Ultrasound will show the location of the [[gestational sac]] in the cervix, while the uterine cavity is "empty". Cervical pregnancy can be confused with a [[miscarriage]] when pregnancy tissue is passing through the cervix.

Histologically the diagnosis has been made by [[Isidor Rubin|Rubin’s]] criteria on the surgical specimen:  cervical glands are opposite the [[trophoblast]]ic tissue, the trophoblastic attachment is below the entrance of the uterine vessels to the uterus or the anterior peritoneal reflection, and fetal elements are absent from the uterine corpus.<ref>{{Cite journal  |title=Cervical Pregnancy : An Uncommon Ectopic Pregnancy  |author= Dixit N, Venkatesan S |journal=Mjafi|year= 2008|volume= 64 |pages= 183–184}}</ref> As many pregnancies today are diagnosed early and no hysterectomy is performed, Rubin's criteria can often not be applied.

==Management==
True cervical pregnancies tend to abort, if, however, the pregnancy is located higher in the canal and the placenta finds support in the uterine cavity it can go past the first trimester. With the placenta being implanted abnormally extensive vaginal bleeding can be expected at time of delivery and placental removal.  While early cervical pregnancies may abort spontaneously or can be managed with excision, D&C, suturing, electrocautery, and tamponading,<ref name=ogs/><ref>{{Cite journal|author= Kraemer B, Abele H, Hahn M, Wallwiener D, Rajab TK, Hornung R  |title=Cervical ectopic pregnancy on the portio: conservative case management and clinical review |journal= Fertil Steril. |pmid=18710714|year= 2008|volume= 90|issue= 5|pages= 2011.e1–4|doi= 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.06.018}}</ref> by medication such as [[methotrexate]],<ref name=eog>{{Cite journal|author= Corticelli A, Grimaldi M, Caporale E.  |title= Conservative management of cervical ectopic pregnancy: case report and review of literature |journal=Clin Exp Obstet Gynecol. |pmid=19205450|year= 2008|volume= 35|issue= 4|pages= 297–8}}</ref> and/or by [[uterine artery embolization]],<ref>{{Cite journal| author= Nakao Y, Yokoyama M, Iwasaka T.  |title=Uterine artery embolization followed by dilation and curettage for cervical pregnancy |journal= Obstet Gynecol. |pmid= 18239001| year= 2008| volume= 111| issue= 2 Pt 2| pages= 505–7| doi= 10.1097/01.AOG.0000286771.10377.4e}}</ref> a  more advanced pregnancy may require a [[hysterectomy]] to control bleeding.<ref name=og/> The more advanced the pregnancy the higher the risk for a major bleeding necessitating a hysterectomy.<ref name=mig/>

On a very rare occasion, a cervical pregnancy results in the birth of a live baby,<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Kotzbach R, Szymański M, Korenkiewcz J, Wasilewski Z, Szymański W.  |title=Ectopic cervical pregnancy terminating in the birth of a live 1800 g infant |journal=Ginekol Pol. | language=Polish |pmid=16013184|year= 2005|volume= 76|issue= 4|pages= 304–7}}</ref> typically the pregnancy is in the upper part of the cervical canal and manages to extend into the lower part of the  uterine cavity.

A cervical pregnancy can develop together with a normal intrauterine pregnancy; such a [[heterotopic pregnancy]] will call for expert management as to not to endanger the intrauterine pregnancy.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Shah AA, Grotegut CA, Likes CE 3rd, Miller MJ, Walmer DK. |title= Heterotopic cervical pregnancy treated with transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration resulting in cervical site varices within the myometrium  |journal =Fertil Steril. |pmid=19022428|year= 2009|volume= 91|issue= 3|pages= 934.e19–22|doi= 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.008}}</ref>
