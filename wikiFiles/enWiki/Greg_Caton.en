'''Gregory James Caton''' (born April 6, 1956) is an American businessman, inventor, manufacturer and promoter of various herbal products, the main one being [[Cansema]] which is claimed to cure skin [[cancer]],<ref name = "CV">[http://www.gregcaton.com/ Greg Caton CV]</ref> although the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) banned it in 2003 as worthless.<ref>Shapiro, Rose, ''How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All, quoted at [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_extracts/article3418058.ece The Sunday Times Online, February 23, 2008]</ref> Caton is the founder of Alpha Omega Labs, a manufacturer of natural health care products, that currently distributs internationally from [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]].<ref>[http://www.gregcaton.com Website:Greg Caton]</ref>

==Early life and education==
Caton attended [[Los Angeles Valley College]],<ref name = "CV" /> a community college in the [[San Fernando Valley]], and then served in the [[US Navy]] as a cryptologist from 1975 through 1978{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Caton has been an avid amateur and short wave radio operator.<ref>[http://www.city-data.com/aradio/lic-Lake-Charles-Louisiana.html List of Lake Charles Amateur Radio Licences]</ref>

==First businesses==
Caton founded Consumer Express in 1984.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4669633.html Website:PRNewswire Feb 25, 1987]</ref> which later became Nutrition for Life,<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-7243789.html Website PRNewswire Jan 11, 1989]</ref> a [[Multi-level marketing|multi-level mailorder]] (MLM) company.  The firm traded briefly on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17558940.html Website:PR Newswire Nov 7, 1995]</ref>

Nutrition for Life<ref>[http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/1250/1/uhm_phd_4386_r.pdf  Dixon, Anna.  Doctoral Dissertaion University of Hawaii Health and wealth: Dietary supplements, network marketing and the commodification of health]</ref> entered into a business agreement with [[Kevin Trudeau]]<ref>[http://www.skepdic.com/trudeau.html Website:Skeptic Dictionary - Kevin Trudeau accessed 19 DEC 09]</ref>  After the change of ownership of Consumer Express, Caton authored a book (which was since withdrawn) on his version of the alleged fraud surrounding this transaction.  Down-Line News reviewed this work in February 1993 on their website.<ref>[http://www.mlmwatchdog.com/Watchdog_1993_January_WhatsHappening.html Website:Down line News Archive JAN/FEB 1993, Accessed 21 December 09]</ref>  Caton filed a suit against [[Kevin Trudeau]] in the US Fifth District Court of Appeals, in response to a libel suit by Trudeau in 1996 over Caton's aforementioned book.

<blockquote>In January 1996, Kevin Trudeau filed a libel suit against Caton in Illinois state court based on statements Caton made in a book and on an Internet website. Caton removed the action to federal court, but on Trudeau's motion, the action was remanded. Thereafter, Caton failed to respond to Trudeau's claims and the court entered a default and noticed an evidential hearing. On June 5, 1996, after a hearing, the court rendered a default judgment against Caton, awarding Trudeau $5 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.<ref name="USCA">{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/157/1026/578120 |title=United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, 157 F.3d 1026}}</ref></blockquote>

In November 1996, Caton filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy in response to the judgment.<ref name="USCA"/>  Shortly afterward, the company was subject to a class action lawsuit filed in Harris County, Texas.<ref>[http://securities.stanford.edu/1012/NFLI/ Website:Stanford University College of Law, Securities Accessed 18 DEC 09]</ref> Nutrition for Life filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 8, 2003.<ref name="MLM Watch Archive">{{cite web|url=http://www.mlmwatchdog.com/Archives2003_2.html |title=Website MLM Watch Archive 2003 Access 18 DEC 09}}</ref>

Caton then took up a project to detail the issues associated with multi-level marketing on a site entitled ''MLM Credit Bureau''.  He was featured in an online article by Ami Mills on the Metroactive website in 1996 regarding his work.<ref>[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/10.03.96/cover/multilevel3-9640.html Website: Mills, Ami Chen, Metroactive Accessed 20DEC09]</ref>

==Lumen Foods, Alpha Omega Labs and Herbologics==
Caton started Alpha Omega Labs in 1995 using the [[pseudonym]] "James Carr".<ref>[http://www.meditopia.org/toc.htm Caton, Greg, ''Meditopia'', online book, 2004 and subsequent, ongoing project]</ref> Alpha Omega Labs became a provider of over 300 alternative health products with 14 distributors around the world, before its closure by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2003.  Caton pled guilty to charges that he defrauded consumers.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118047779.html Drug Week, June 18, 2004, cited at HighBeam]</ref>

Lumen Foods was featured in an article by the online newspaper [[World Net Daily]], alleging that the firm was under seizure of its accounts due to fraudulent activity.<ref>[http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=3659 World Net Daily, Banks seizing Y2K supplier funds, 14 APR 1999]</ref>  Caton vigorously refuted the claim, which he alleged was related to issues surrounding the [[Y2K]] panic.<ref>[http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=000ia4 Letter from Caton to WND, 14 APR 1999]</ref>

In early 2000, Lumen Foods reportedly "broke ranks" with the health food industry when it was reported that it would actively include [[Genetically modified organism]] (GMO) products in its offerings.<ref>[http://archives.foodsafety.ksu.edu/agnet/2000/2-2000/ag-02-07-00-01.txt Letter from Professor C.S. Prakash, Director of the Center for Plant Biotechnology Research at Tuskegee University and a member of the newly-formed USDA Advisory Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology. Published in AgNet 06 FEB 2000]</ref>
<blockquote>"They have it all wrong", said Lumen Foods' President, Greg Caton. "FDA, USDA, and EPA have all done exhaustive research into their safety and have found nothing that remotely suggests that either the consumer or the environment are at risk from GM seed", he said.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/food-beverage-stores/467480-1.html Food and Drink Weekly, Health foods manufacturer takes pro-GMO stance, 28 FEB 2000]</ref></blockquote>  This earned significant attention from non-GMO advocates.  Caton spoke at Cornell University's sponsored symposium, Informing the Dialogue about Agricultural Biotechnology, in November 1999.  His topic was GMO Controversy & the Whole Foods Industry: Why Wholesale Condemnation of Agricultural Biotechnology Hurts our Most Ingredient-Sensitive Markets<ref>[http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/comm/gmo/ag_symposiumsch.pdf Cornell University - Informing the Dialogue about Agricultural Biotechnology Symposium, November 1999]</ref>  Lumen Foods reversed their position later in the year, supposedly from pressure by their customers.<ref>[http://www.cropchoice.com/FL_Archive9896.html?pg=2&ID=8&YR=2000 CropChoice "Lumen's Costumers Come First" 16 August 2000]</ref>

Alpha Omega was the topic of an expos√© by ''[[Business Week]]'' in their review of the book ''[[Natural Causes]]''.<ref>Magazine: BusinessWeek January 8, 2007, webversion http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_02/b4016109.htm</ref>
The review in ''Business Week'' references the case of Sue Gilliatt, a nurse from Indianapolis who claimed she used [[Cansema]], as well as a product named "H3O" (also sold by Caton) for skin cancer on her nose and that they burned off her nose (in the lawsuit, H3O was primarily blamed).<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Causes-Politics-Americas-Supplement/dp/0767920422 Natural Causes Book]</ref><ref>[http://www.meditopia.org/docs/wishtv.pdf Website: Meditopia pdf Archive:WISH TV Channel 8 News Story accessed 19 DEC 09 ]</ref><ref>[http://www.wishtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=1540595&nav=0Ra7JXqeJXqg Website WISH TV 8, Indianapolis, IN]</ref><ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_02/b4016109.htm BusinessWeek, Jan. 8, 2007.]</ref> Caton contested Gilliatt's assertions, claiming that due to the individual's use of additional alternative medicine, exclusive attribution of damages from H3O could not be determined. Furthermore, according to Caton, Gilliatt contradicted herself several times in her various court testimonies.<ref>[http://www.meditopia.org/gilliatt_affidavit.htm Sworn affidavit by Gilliatt]</ref> Caton even claims that  Gilliatt's nose appears to have been surgically removed, citing photographs.<ref>[http://www.meditopia.org/chap3-1.htm Meditopia, Ch. 3] Greg Caton's website</ref> The use of escharotics (caustic pastes) such as Cansema to treat skin cancer is "unproven" and can have "serious consequences", according to dermatologists.<ref>[http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/138/12/1593 McDaniel S and Goldman GD, ''Consequences of Using Escharotic Agents as Primary Treatment for Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer'', Archives of Dermatology 2002;138:1593-1596]</ref>

==Federal conviction==
In 2003, United States Federal agents from the joint task force (including U.S. FDA, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] and local law enforcement) raided Caton's offices, factory and home.<ref>[http://www.eddi-inc.com/news7.html EDDI, Inc. Security Specialists] "On September 17, 2003, a federal search warrant was executed at CATON's residence, Lumen Food Corporation, and an industrial site owned by CATON. All of these locations were in Lake Charles, Louisiana."</ref> As a result of the raid, Caton pled guilty in 2004 and was sentenced to 33 months in prison for weapons possession by a felon and for defrauding customers and violating FDA regulations.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-121813821.html Health and Medicine Week, September 13, 2004, cited at Highbeam]</ref><ref>[http://www.meditopia.org/docs/transcript_plea.pdf Official Transcript of Pleas Hearing, Docket 04-20075 26 May 2004]</ref> Caton had received a previous felony conviction for counterfeiting in 1990.<ref>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:STByI0-xuv4J:www.meditopia.org/docs/cbs11_6_30_4.pdf+gilliatt+caton&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShecO_GMXTrPYaCepCBbnCZoRiwZY8_xgWI5x7AzLu3JCJgId9-8u-mSnkxKDImkoHnkUhFc8bU6Eroa_llkuvfKdXnCpJK8Czqxp8YDYPUzx-0LnpdO6d7HM37dGRsLrYLYCPK&sig=AHIEtbQwtzmYr8NeTOAfWAsmFtDCFH_nHQ CBS-11 News, June 30, 2004]</ref>

Caton filed for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] based upon ineffective counsel in 2005.  This was denied with prejudice by the courts.<ref>[http://www.meditopia.org/docs/gc_49.pdf Web Accessed pdf - Case 2:04-cr-20075-TLM-CMH Document 49 Filed 11/23/2005]</ref>

== Probation violation and extradition from Ecuador ==
On 5 June 2006, after serving his sentence,<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/bpai/decisions/inform/105617-66.pdf US Patent Office document dated 19 Sept 2008 - ''PDF File''] "...on 5 June 2006 Caton began serving a 3 three year period of supervised release..."</ref> Greg Caton was released on three years probation with specific restrictions against possession of firearms or manufacture of non-FDA approved materials.<ref>[http://www.meditopia.org/docs/04-20075-01.document19.pdf Court document dated August 24, 2004 (PDF file)] Probation terms</ref> Caton and his family relocated to [[Ecuador]] in the summer of 2007.<ref>[http://www.meditopia.org/chap3-2.htm Meditopia, Ch. 3] "our family permanently moved to Ecuador in the summer of 2007"</ref> Alpha Omega Labs were reopened in June 2008.<ref name="GC">{{cite web|url=http://www.gregcaton.com |title=Greg Caton CV}}</ref>

On 27 October 2007, Caton was found in violation of the terms of his probation.<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/bpai/decisions/inform/105617-66.pdf US Patent Office document dated 19 Sept 2008 ''(PDF File)''] "Caton further tells us that because he could not fly to the United States he could not attend 27 October 2007 hearing in the Western District of Louisiana. As a result, Caton was in violation of the conditions of his release."</ref> In September 2008, a filing was made with the U.S. patent office in which Caton expressed a fear of arrest for violation of his probation, if he returned to the US.<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/bpai/decisions/inform/105617-66.pdf Website: Patent Interference 105,617 McK INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTS, LLC, (Inventor: Gregory James Caton) v.ZANNIER, INC.,(Inventor: Paul D. Manos) Patent 7,264,847] (This filing was made because Caton was a junior party to a lawsuit regarding his patent with Paul Manos.)</ref>

Caton's probation violation was reported to [[Interpol]], and was placed in their database; it was reported on Interpol website on 30 September 2008. In February 2009, Caton was featured in ''[[Parade Magazine]]'''s "On the Run In America" as an Interpol international fugitive.<ref name="PM">{{cite news|url=http://www.parade.com/news/2009/02/on-the-run-in-america.html |title=On the Run In America |date=2009-02 |work=Parade |accessdate=2009-12-21}}</ref> 

On 3 December 2009, Caton was arrested at a checkpoint in Ecuador and held in prison. What followed was a complex set of legal manoeuvres involving multiple parties. According to Cathryn Caton, his wife, these manoeuvres included various members of the Ecuadorian judiciary and Police officials. A judicial hearing on the case was scheduled in Guayaquil, Ecuador on 14 December 2009.<ref>[http://www.latarde.com.ec/1660-Familia+Caton+denuncia+secuestro.html Familia Caton denuncia secuestro] (Spanish) 2010-01-27</ref>

Caton is currently imprisoned in the US. He was sentenced in a Louisiana court in May 2010 to serve the remainder of his probation (24 months) in prison.  He filed a motion of appeal on June 23, 2011, under the provision that the court failed to consider sentencing guidelines.  This appeal was denied<ref>[http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20FCO%2020110623187.xml&docbase=CSLWAR3-2007-CURR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff-Appellee,v.GREGORY JAMES CATON, Defendant-Appellant.
