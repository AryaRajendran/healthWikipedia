'''Amyloid Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis''', '''primary systemic amyloidosis (PSA)''' or just '''primary amyloidosis''' is the most common form of [[Systemic disease|systemic]] [[amyloidosis]] in the US.<ref name="pmid15198347">{{cite journal |author=Gertz MA |title=The classification and typing of amyloid deposits |journal=Am. J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=121 |issue=6 |pages=787–9 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15198347 |doi=10.1309/TR4L-GLVR-JKAM-V5QT |url=http://ajcp.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=0002-9173&volume=121&issue=6&spage=787}}</ref> The disease is caused when a person's [[antibody]]-producing cells do not function properly and produce abnormal protein fibers made of components of antibodies called [[immunoglobulin light chain|light chains]]. These light chains come together to form amyloid deposits in different organs which can cause serious damage to these organs.<ref name="urlAmyloidosis Causes, Diagnosis, Symptoms, and Treatment on MedicineNet.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/amyloidosis/article.htm |title=Amyloidosis Causes, Diagnosis, Symptoms, and Treatment on MedicineNet.com |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/amyloidosis/ |title=Amyloidosis and Kidney Disease|publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]]|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> Abnormal light chains in blood and urine are sometimes referred to as "[[Bence Jones protein]]".

==Signs and symptoms==
AL amyloidosis can affect a wide range of organs, and consequently present with a range of symptoms. The kidneys are the most commonly affected organ in AL amyloidosis. Symptoms of kidney disease and renal failure can include fluid retention, swelling, and shortness of breath.<ref name=UNC1/>
In addition to kidneys, AL amyloidosis may affect the heart, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, blood, lungs and skin. Heart complications, which affect more than a third of AL patients, include heart failure and irregular heart beat. Other symptoms can include stroke, gastrointestinal disorders, enlarged liver, diminished spleen function, diminished function of the adrenal and other endocrine glands, skin color change or growths, lung problems, bleeding and bruising problems, fatigue and weight loss.<ref name="UNC1"/><ref name=UM1>{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/amyloidosis-000007.htm |title= Amyloidosis|publisher=[[University of Maryland Medical Center]]|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>

==Causes==
AL amyloidosis can occur spontaneously, however, it is often associated with other blood disorders, such as [[multiple myeloma]] and [[Waldenström's macroglobulinemia]].<ref name="UNC1">{{cite web |url=http://www.unckidneycenter.org/kidneyhealthlibrary/amyloidosis.html |title=AL Amyloidosis |author= [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] Kindey Center|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]]|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> About 10% to 15% of patients with multiple myeloma may develop overt AL amyloidosis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Madin|first1= Sumit|last2= Dispenzieri|first2= Angela|year= 2010|title= Clinical Features and Treatment Response of Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis Diagnosed in Patients With Previous Diagnosis  of Multiple Myeloma|journal=[[Mayo Clinic Proceedings]]|volume= 83|issue= 3|pages= 232–238|doi= 10.4065/mcp.2009.0547|url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/content/85/3/232.full.pdf|accessdate= 22 November 2011}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Both blood and the urine can be tested for the light chains,  which may form amyloid deposits, causing disease.  However, the diagnosis requires a sample of an affected organ.<ref name=UNC1/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sanchorawala|first1=Vaishali|year=2006|title=Light-Chain (AL) Amyloidosis: Diagnosis and Treatment|journal= Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology|volume=1|issue=6|pages=1334–1341|url=http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/1/6/1331.full|accessdate= 1 December 2011}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The most effective treatment is autologous bone marrow transplants with stem cell rescues. However many patients are too weak to tolerate this approach.<ref name="pmid15070667">{{cite journal |author=Palladini G, Perfetti V, Obici L, ''et al.'' |title=Association of melphalan and high-dose dexamethasone is effective and well tolerated in patients with AL (primary) amyloidosis who are ineligible for stem cell transplantation |journal=Blood |volume=103 |issue=8 |pages=2936–8 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15070667 |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-08-2788 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15070667}}</ref><ref name="urlBU">{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/amyloid/doctors/features/clinical-al.html |title=BU | Amyloid Treatment & Research Program | Doctors | Clinical Features | AL Amyloidosis |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Other treatments can involve application of [[chemotherapy]] similar to that used in multiple myeloma.<ref name = urlBU/> A combination of [[bortezomib]] and [[dexamethasone]] has been proposed,<ref name="pmid18024372">{{cite journal |author=Kastritis E, Anagnostopoulos A, Roussou M, ''et al.'' |title=Treatment of light chain (AL) amyloidosis with the combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone |journal=Haematologica |volume=92 |issue=10 |pages=1351–8 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=18024372 |doi=10.3324/haematol.11325 |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18024372}}</ref> as has [[melphalan]] and dexamethasone.<ref name = pmid15070667/>

==Prognosis==
Median survival for patients diagnosed with AL amyloidosis is 40 months.<ref name=Wech>{{cite journal |author=Ashutosh D. Wechalekar|year=2007|title=Perspectives in treatment of AL amyloidosis|journal=[[British Journal of Haematology]]|volume=140|issue=4|pages=365–377|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06936.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06936.x/full|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
AL amyloidosis is a rare disease; only 1200 to 3200 new cases are reported each year in the United States. Two thirds of patients with AL amyloidosis are male and less than 5% of patients are under 40 years of age.<ref name="UNC1"/><ref name=AF1>{{cite web |url=http://www.amyloidosis.org/TreatmentInformation/primaryAL.html|title=Primary AL|publisher=Amyloidosis Foundation|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>
