The '''articularis genus''' ('''subcrureus''') is a small [[skeletal muscle]] located anteriorly on the [[thigh]] just above the [[knee]].

== Origin and insertion ==

It arises from the anterior surface of the lower part of the body of the femur,<ref name="PTC">{{cite web |url=http://www.ptcentral.com/muscles/musclelegs.html |title=Thigh to Foot Musculature |publisher=PT Central |accessdate=2010-08-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100715211225/http://www.ptcentral.com/muscles/musclelegs.html| archivedate= 15 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> deep to the [[vastus intermedius muscle|vastus intermedius]],<ref Name="Grant's">{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H20V4pCpACYC&pg=PA414 |title=Grant's atlas of anatomy |author=Agur, A.

Its insertion is on the [[synovial membrane]] of the knee-joint.<ref name="PTC" />

== Action ==

Articularis genu pulls the [[bursae of the knee joint|suprapatellar bursa]] superiorly during extension of the knee,<ref Name="Grant's" /> and prevents impingement of the synovial membrane between the [[patella]] and the [[femur]].<ref name="PTC" />

== Blood supply ==

It is supplied by the [[lateral circumflex femoral artery|lateral femoral circumflex artery]].<ref name="PTC" />

== Innervation ==

It is innervated by branches of the [[femoral nerve]] (L2-L4).<ref name="PTC" />

== Variation ==

Flat, wispy and highly variable,<ref name="Reider-etal">{{cite web |title=The anterior aspect of the knee joint | author=B Reider, JL Marshall, B Koslin, B Ring and FG Girgis |publisher=J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1981;63:351-356. |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/63/3/351.pdf | date=1981 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref> sometimes consisting of several separate muscular bundles,<ref name="Gray's" /> this muscle is without a distinct investing [[fascia]] and ranges 1.5–3 cm in width.<ref name="Reider-etal" />
