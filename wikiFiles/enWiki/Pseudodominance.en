'''Pseudodominance''' is the situation in which the inheritance of an [[autosomal recessive]] trait mimics an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern.<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=699 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The pattern of inheritance in which the recessive allele could give its expression  in absence of its dominant allele is known as pseudodominance.  Haemophilia and colour blindness are the genetic disease due to X linked recessive allele giving their expression in human male is pseudodominance and in human female is dominance.
 
Pseudodominance also observed in autosomal recessive condition in subsequent generations .This could happen in the case of loss of genetic material from one homolog bearing the dominant allele. The heterozygous condition is therefore lost at that particular locus and the recessive phenotype is revealed.
