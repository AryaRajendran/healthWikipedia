'''Congenital rubella syndrome''' (CRS) can occur in a developing fetus of a pregnant woman who has contracted [[rubella]] during her first trimester. If infection occurs 0–28 days before conception, there is a 43% chance the infant will be affected. If the infection occurs 0–12 weeks after conception, there is a 51% chance the infant will be affected. 

If the infection occurs 13–26 weeks after conception there is a 23% chance the infant will be affected by the disease. Infants are not generally affected if rubella is contracted during the third trimester, or 26–40 weeks after conception. Problems rarely occur when rubella is contracted by the mother after 20 weeks of [[gestation]] and continues to disseminate the virus after birth.

It was discovered in 1941 by Australian [[Norman Gregg|Norman McAllister Gregg]].

The classic triad for congenital rubella syndrome is:
*[[Sensorineural hearing loss|Sensorineural deafness]] (58% of patients)
*Eye abnormalities—especially [[retinopathy]], [[cataract]] and [[microphthalmia]] (43% of patients)
*[[Congenital heart disease]]—especially [[patent ductus arteriosus]] (50% of patients)
[[Image:Congenital Rubella Syndrome, Salt and Pepper Retinopathy.jpg|right|thumb|"Salt-and-pepper" retinopathy of the retina is the most common ocular manifestation of congenital rubella.]]
Other manifestations of CRS may include:
*[[Spleen]], [[liver]] or [[bone marrow]] problems (some of which may disappear shortly after birth)
*[[Mental retardation]]
*Small head size ([[microcephaly]])
*Eye defects
*Low birth weight
*[[Thrombocytopenic purpura]] (presents as a characteristic [[Blueberry muffin baby|blueberry muffin rash]])
*[[Hepatomegaly]]
*[[Micrognathia]]

Children who have been exposed to rubella in the womb should also be watched closely as they age for any indication of the following:
*[[Developmental delay]]

*[[Growth retardation]]
*[[Learning disability|Learning disabilities]]
*[[Diabetes]]
*[[Glaucoma]]

==Prevention==
Vaccination of females of childbearing age against rubella can prevent congenital rubella syndrome.
Termination of pregnancy is often recommended if exposure occurs or CRS is suspected antenatally.
