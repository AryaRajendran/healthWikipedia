[[Image:Cortisol-3D-balls.png|right|thumb|300px|Production of the [[corticosteroid]] hormone [[cortisol]] is increased after a person awakes in the morning]]
The '''cortisol awakening response''' (CAR) is an increase of about 50% in [[cortisol]] levels occurring 20–30&nbsp;minutes ''after'' awakening in the morning in some people. This rise is superimposed upon the late-night rise in cortisol which occurs ''before'' awakening. It is thought to be linked to the [[hippocampus]]' preparation of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) to face anticipated stress.

==Description==
Shortly after awakening, a sharp 38–75% (average 50%) increase occurs in the blood level of [[cortisol]] in about 77%<ref name="Wustwolf00"/> of healthy adults, and it occurs in people of all ages.<ref name= "Fries">Fries E, Dettenborn L, Kirschbaum C. (2009). The cortisol awakening response (CAR): facts and future directions. Int J Psychophysiol. 72(1):67–73. PMID 18854200</ref> The average level of salivary cortisol upon waking is roughly 15&nbsp;nmol/l; 30&nbsp;minutes later it may be 23&nbsp;nmol/l, though there are wide variations.<ref name="Wustwolf00">Wüst S, Wolf J, Hellhammer DH, Federenko I, Schommer N, Kirschbaum C.

Normally, the highest cortisol secretion happens in the second half of the night with peak cortisol production occurring in the early morning. Following this, cortisol levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during the ﬁrst half of the night.<ref>Tsigos C, Chrousos GP. (2002). Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neuroendocrine factors and stress.

(2007). Is the cortisol awakening rise a response to awakening? Psychoneuroendocrinology. 32(4):358–66. PMID 17408865</ref>

Cortisol awakening response provides an easy measure of the reactivity capacity of the HPA axis.<ref>Schmidt-Reinwald A, Pruessner JC, Hellhammer DH, Federenko I, Rohleder N, Schürmeyer TH, Kirschbaum C. (1999). The cortisol response to awakening in relation to different challenge tests and a 12-hour cortisol rhythm. Life Sci. 64(18):1653–60. PMID 10328525</ref>

==Sleep factors==
* [[Waking up]] earlier in the morning increases the response.<ref>Kudielka BM, Kirschbaum C. (2003). Awakening cortisol responses are influenced by health status and awakening time but not by menstrual cycle phase. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 28(1):35–47. PMID 12445835</ref>
* [[Shift work]]: nurses working on morning shifts with very early awakening (between 4:00–5:30 a.m.) had a greater and prolonged cortisol awakening response than those on the late day shift (between 6:00–9:00 a.m.) or the night shift (between 11:00 a.m.–2:00 p.m.).<ref name="Federenko">Federenko I, Wüst S, Hellhammer DH, Dechoux R, Kumsta R, Kirschbaum C. (2004) Free cortisol awakening responses are influenced by awakening time. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 29(2):174–84. PMID 14604599</ref> However another study found this attributed this greater respose to increased [[stress (biological)|stress]] and impaired [[shift work sleep disorder|sleep quality before an early work shift]].<ref>Williams E, Magid K, Steptoe A. (2005). The impact of time of waking and concurrent subjective stress on the cortisol response to awakening. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 30(2):139–48. PMID 15471612</ref>
* [[Nap]]s: students taking a nap of one to two hours in the early evening hours (between 6:45–8:30 p.m.) had no cortisol awakening response, suggesting cortisol awakening response only occurs after night sleep.<ref name="Federenko"/>
* Waking up in the light: cortisol awakening response is larger when people wake up in light rather than darkness.<ref>Scheer FA, Buijs RM. (1999). [http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/reprint/84/9/3395 Light affects morning salivary cortisol in humans.] J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 84(9):3395–8.

Effects of nighttime low frequency noise on the cortisol response to awakening and subjective sleep quality. Life Sci. 72(8):863–75. PMID 12493567</ref>
* [[Alarm clock]] vs. spontaneous waking: there is no difference on days when people woke up spontaneously or used the alarm clock.<ref name="Wustwolf00"/>
* [[Aspirin]] has been found to reduce the response probably through an action upon [[ACTH]].<ref>Watson S, Horton K, Bulmer S, Carlile J, Corcoran C, Gallagher P, Ferrier IN. (2009). Effect of aspirin on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function and on neuropsychological performance in healthy adults: a pilot study.Psychopharmacology (Berl). 205(1):151–5. PMID 19404617</ref>

Subjective socioeconomic position, gender and cortisol responses to waking in an elderly population. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 30(6):582–90.

PMID 16150550</ref>

==Neurology==
Cortisol is released from the [[adrenal gland]]s following activation by [[ACTH]] release from the [[pituitary]]. The ACTH release creating the cortisol awakening response is strongly inhibited after intake of a low-dose [[dexamethasone]].<ref>Ehrhart-Bornstein M, Bornstein SR, Scherbaum WA. (1996). Sympathoadrenal system and immune system in the regulation of adrenocortical function. Eur J Endocrinol. 135(1):19–26. PMID 8765968</ref> This is a synthetic [[glucocorticoid]] and this inhibition allows the detection of the presence of [[negative feedback]] from circulating cortisol that controls to [[ACTH]]-secreting cells of the pituitary.

In the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] the pituitary release of ACTH is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]]. In the cortisol awakening response, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is controlled by the [[hippocampus]]. For example, cortisol awakening response is absent in those with bilateral and unilateral hippocampus damage<ref>Buchanan TW, Kern S, Allen JS, Tranel D, Kirschbaum C. (2004). Circadian regulation of cortisol after hippocampal damage in humans. Biol Psychiatry.;56(9):651–6. PMID 15522248</ref> and hippocampal [[cerebral atrophy|atrophy]].<ref>Bruehl H, Wolf OT, Convit A. (2009). A blunted cortisol awakening response and hippocampal atrophy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 34(6):815–21. PMID 19167831</ref> Those with severe [[amnesia]], and thus with presumed damage to the [[temporal lobe]], also do not have it.<ref>Wolf OT, Fujiwara E, Luwinski G, Kirschbaum C, [[Hans Markowitsch|Markowitsch HJ]]. (2005). No morning cortisol response in patients with severe global amnesia. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 30(1):101–5. PMID 15358447</ref> Those with a larger hippocampus have a greater response.<ref name="pruessner07">Pruessner M, Pruessner JC, Hellhammer DH, Bruce Pike G, Lupien SJ. (2007). The associations among hippocampal volume, cortisol reactivity, and memory performance in healthy young men. Psychiatry Res. 155(1):1–10. PMID 17395434</ref>

It plausible also that the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], the light-sensitive biological clock, plays a role in cortisol awakening response regulation.<ref name="Fries"/>

==Function==
The function of cortisol awakening response is unknown but it has been suggested to link with a stress-related preparation in regard to the upcoming day by the hippocampus. One hypothesis is: "that the cortisol rise after awakening may accompany an activation of prospective memory representations at awakening enabling individual's orientation about the self in time and space as well as anticipation of demands of the upcoming day... it is tempting to speculate that for the CAR, anticipation of these upcoming demands may be essential in regulating the CAR magnitude for the particular day. The hippocampus is, besides its established role in long-term memory consolidation, involved in the formation of a cohesive construct and representation of the outside world within the central nervous system processing information about space, time and relationships of environmental cues. This puts the hippocampus in a pivotal position for the regulation of the CAR."<ref name="Fries"/>
