{{Close Relationships}}
'''Human sexual activity''', or '''human sexual practice''' or '''human sexual behavior''', is the manner in which humans experience and express their [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. People engage in a variety of sexual acts from time to time, and for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity normally results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity also includes conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship|mating]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behavior), and personal interactions between individuals, such as [[flirting]] and [[foreplay]].

Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[physical intimacy|behavioral]] and biological aspects, including physiological processes such as the reproductive mechanism, the [[sex drive]] and pathology; [[sexual intercourse]] and sexual behavior in all its forms; and [[Human bonding|personal bonding]] and shared emotions during sexual activity. 

In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, although [[premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are also common. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries, and some are considered against the norms of a society. For example, sexual activity with a person below some [[age of consent]] and [[sexual assault]] in general are criminal offenses in most jurisdictions.

==Types==
Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways. It can be divided into acts which involve one person, such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]], or [[mutual masturbation]]. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. [[Autoeroticism|Autoerotic]] sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[anal beads]], and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.

Sexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[urolagnia]], and/or [[BDSM]] activities.<ref name="channel1">[http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html Sex and Relationships – Sex – 4Health from Channel 4<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="findarticles.com">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again – Sexual Fitness – physiology | Men's Fitness | Find Articles at BNET.com]</ref> Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, armpits or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items.

Sexual activity can also be consensual or under force or duress, or lawful/illegal or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]]. Some non-conventional [[autoerotic]] practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.

==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual activity==
The [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during sexual activity are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.<ref name="Schacter">{{cite book | authors=Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner| title =Psychology| publisher =[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year = 2010|pages=335-336|accessdate = November 10, 2012| isbn = 1429237198, 9781429237192|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=emAyzTNy1cUC&pg=PA335&dq=Men+and+women+may+have+different+levels+of+sexual+drive,+but+their+physiological+responses+during+sex+are+fairly+similar.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L31PUefQJYjtqwGszIH4DQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Men%20and%20women%20may%20have%20different%20levels%20of%20sexual%20drive%2C%20but%20their%20physiological%20responses%20during%20sex%20are%20fairly%20similar.&f=false}}</ref>
*During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Both men and women experience a "[[sex flush]]" on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's [[vagina]] becomes lubricated and her [[clitoris]] becomes swollen.<ref name="Schacter"/>
*During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A man's urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with [[semen]]. A woman's clitoris may withdraw slightly and there is more lubrication, outer swelling and muscles tighten and reduction of diameter.<ref name="Schacter"/> 
*During the [[orgasm]] phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having faked it. A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.<ref name="Schacter"/>
*During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state. Though generally reported that women do not experience a [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first,<ref name="Rosenthal">{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=134-135|accessdate = September 17, 2012| isbn = 9780618755714 |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&pg=PT154 }}</ref><ref name=SOC>{{Cite web| title = The Sexual Response Cycle| publisher = [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] | url = http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/the-sexual-response-cycle|accessdate =6 August 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110725051823/http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/the-sexual-response-cycle|archivedate=25 July 2011}}</ref> some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further [[sexual stimulation]] does not produce excitement.<ref name="Schacter"/><ref name="Weiner & Craighead">{{cite book | authors=Irving B.

==Reasons for sexual activity==
People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on the college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: ''physical attraction'', as a ''means to an end'', to increase ''emotional connection'', and to ''alleviate insecurity''.<ref>Meston & Buss, 2007.</ref> 

Most people engage in sexual activity because of the [[Sexual arousal|sexual pleasure]] they derive from the activity, in which the most heightened pleasure is derived through [[orgasm]]. Erotic pleasure can also be experienced during [[foreplay]] and from flirting, and from fetish or BDSM activities.<ref name="channel1"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again&nbsp;— Sexual Fitness&nbsp;— physiology | year=2002 | work=Men's Fitness}}</ref>

Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity with a person to whom they are [[Sexual attraction|sexually attracted]]; but at times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of the partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.

Also, a person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of [[Fertilisation|conception]]. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten [[sexual tension]], attraction and interest.<ref name=Holbrook1972 >{{Cite book | last=Holbrook | first=David | year=1972 | title=The masks of hate: the problem of false solutions in the culture of an acquisitive society | publisher=Pergamon Press | page=118 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rWYIAQAAIAAJ | isbn=978-0-08-015799-3}}</ref><ref name=Institute1997 >{{Cite book | last=Institute | first=American Film | year=1997 | title=[[The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures]] produced in the United States, Volume 1,&nbsp;Part 2 | edition=reprint | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | isbn=978-0-520-20970-1 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s1k1RsGvFwwC  | page=369 }}</ref>

It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. [[Joan Roughgarden]], in her book ''Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People,'' postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.<ref name=Roughgarden2004 >{{Cite book | last=Roughgarden | first=Joan | year=2004 | title= Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People| publisher=[[University of California Press]] | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dASsUFtN57sC&dq | isbn=0-520-24073-1}}</ref>

==Frequency==
The frequency of sexual activity might range from zero ([[sexual abstinence]]) to 15 or 20 times a week.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 Sexual health: An interview with a [[Mayo Clinic]] specialist]</ref> In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.<ref>{{cite book

==Health and safety==
===General health and sexually transmitted infections===
Sexual activity is a normal physiological function, as it contributes to physical health just like walking,<ref> Xiaojun Chen , Xuerui Tan, Qingying Zhang, [http://go.galegroup.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/ps/i.do?action=interpret&id=GALE|A229530831&v=2.1&u=utoronto_main&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&authCount=1 " Cardiovascular effects of sexual activity"], ''Medknow Publications'', Dec. 2009</ref> but it comes with risks. There are four main risks that arise from sexual activity. These are unwanted pregnancy, contracting a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]], physical injury, and psychological injuries.

[[File:Préservatif enroulé.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A rolled-up male [[condom]]]]
Sexual activity that involves sexual intercourse or even contact of semen with the vagina or vulva carries the chance of pregnancy. People who want to engage in such behaviors with a reduced chance of pregnancy employ any of a variety of available [[contraception]] methods, such as [[birth control pill]]s, the use of a [[condom]], [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, [[spermicide]]s, [[hormonal contraception]], and sterilization.<ref>[http://contraception.about.com/od/contraceptionoverview/g/glossary.htm   Dawn Stacey: Contraception. About.com.] Retrieved 11 October 2009.</ref>

Sexual activity that involves contact with another person's [[bodily fluids]] carries the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection such as [[HIV/AIDS]], [[hepatitis B]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[genital herpes]], [[trichomoniasis]] or [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]]. HIV/AIDS is a major public health issue in much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], especially Southern Africa. [[Safer sex]] practices reduce these risks. These precautions are often seen as less necessary for [[sex partner]]s in committed relationships, if they are known to be free of disease. Some people require potential sex partners to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases before engaging in sex.<ref>[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/stis-overview Sexually Transmitted Infections Overview. From University of California Santa Barbara.] Retrieved 11 October 2009. {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
===Other risks===
Physical risks vary with the type of sexual activity being engaged in. The medical condition and physical limitations of the participants must be kept in mind. The risk factors are increased by a condition (temporary or permanent) which impairs a person's judgment, such as excess [[alcohol and sex|alcohol]] or other drugs, or emotional states such as loneliness, depression or [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]]. Age and mental capacity of the participants can also affect the risks of sexual activity.

[[Sexual dysfunction]] is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stage in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm.<ref>Kontula, O & Mannila, E (2009).

===Aging===
Typically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a source of expressing their love and care for one another. Aging women with a intimate partner have been found to be in a better state of mental health compared to women lacking intimacy in their relationships. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men, as a result a female widowhood, had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both aging genders agreed they  needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.<ref>Kontula, O., & Haavio-Mannila, E. The Impact of Aging on Human Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire. Journal of Sex Research, 46(10), 46-56.</ref>

==Orientations and society==
===Heterosexuality===
{{Main|Heterosexuality}}
[[File:Bathhouse-Valerius Maximus.gif|thumb|Bordello scene in a public bath, ca. 1475]]
Heterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an age of consent, performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.<ref>[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview. From FindLaw.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.</ref>

Different-sex sexual practices may be [[monogamy|monogamous]], serially monogamous, or [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, [[abstinence|abstinent]] or [[Autosexuality|autoerotic]] (including [[masturbation]]). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.

===Homosexuality===
{{Main|Homosexuality}}
Homosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors.<ref name=APAHelp>[http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 APA Help Center]</ref> Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.<ref name=WhatIsNature>[http://www.apa.org/topics/sorientation.html#whatisnature What is Nature]</ref>

It is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in "the closet"). "Closet case" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called "[[coming out of the closet]]" in the case of voluntary disclosure or "[[outing]]" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes. Among some communities (called "men on the DL" or "[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the "down-low" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.

People who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (and/or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]]. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners&nbsp;– [[tribadism]] (generally [[vulva]]-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its "scissoring" position) and [[frot]] (generally [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis rubbing).

===Bisexuality and pansexuality===
{{Main|Bisexuality|Pansexuality}}
People who have a romantic or sexual attraction to both sexes are referred to as bisexual,<ref name="apahelp">{{Cite news |url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Sexual Orientation, Homosexuality, and Bisexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=18 September 2012 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Other social aspects==
===General attitudes===
Most people experiment with a range of sexual activities during their lives, although they tend to engage in only a few of these regularly. Some people enjoy many different sexual activities, while others avoid sexual activities altogether for religious or other reasons (see [[chastity]], [[sexual abstinence]], [[asexuality]]). Some prefer monogamous relationships for sex, and others may prefer many different partners throughout their lives

[[Alex Comfort]] and others propose three potential social aspects of intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational.<ref>''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking (1972) by [[Alex Comfort]]. See also ISBN 1-4000-4614-9.</ref> The development of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the contraceptive pill]] and other highly effective forms of [[contraception]] in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).

=== Adolescents ===

A 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders nationwide{{Clarify|reason=which nation?|date=February 2013}} report having sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differ in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of Black and Hispanic adolescents are sexually active than White adolescents.<ref>Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.</ref>

===Religious and ethical===
{{Main|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}
[[File:Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG|thumb|Erotic sculptures found in medieval [[Khajuraho|Hindu]] temple in India.]]
Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc.  Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the impact of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.

On the other hand, some people adopt the view that [[pleasure]] is its own justification for sexual activity. [[Hedonism]] is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]].<ref name="stanford">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ Hedonism], 2004-04-20 ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''</ref>

Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely.  These social rules are referred to as [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).

Sexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, [[fidelity]] and consent. Some activities, known as [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between (or among) consenting and competent adults (examples include [[sodomy law]] and adult-adult [[incest]]).

Some people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity (possibly of opposite sexual orientation) from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts, [[online chat room]]s, or, advertising in select media.  

[[Swinging]], on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a [[committed relationship]] engaging in [[sexual activities]] with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.<ref name="case_for_swingers">{{cite journal

</ref> The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s. Swinging sexual activity can take place in a [[sex club]], also known as a swinger club (not to be confused with a [[strip club]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}</ref>

Some people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with, or performing certain actual sexual acts for another person in exchange for money or something of value, it is called prostitution. Other aspects of the [[Sex industry|adult industry]] include [[phone sex]] operators, [[strip club]]s, and pornography.

===Legal issues===
{{Main|Sex and the law}}
There are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way have an impact on sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside of marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.

Most societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.

====Same sex laws====
{{Main|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
Many locales have laws that limit or prohibit [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex sexual activity]].

====Sex outside of marriage====
Sex outside marriage are influenced through religion, culture, societal norms, and/or individual morals and beliefs. In North America, pre-marital sexual activity has been more frequent since the early 1980s.<ref>Cardin, Leslie, [http://search.proquest.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/491594978/pageviewPDF?accountid=14771 "Teens Face Sexual Dilemma Early"], ''Atlanta Daily World'', 1983.</ref> Reasons behind early sexual activity include earlier onset of physical maturity, readily available birth control, greater mobility among teenagers with more opportunities for privacy, and greater permissiveness in society. For the most part, in the West, apart from social taboos, sex before marriage is not illegal. From a religious aspect, many religious texts condemn pre-marital sex as a sin.

====Minimum age of sexual activity (age of consent)====
The laws of each jurisdiction set the minimum age at which a young person is allowed to engage in sexual activity.<ref name="waites">{{cite book|last=Waites| first = Matthew|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn= 1-4039-2173-3}}</ref> The median [[age of consent]] seems to range from 16 to 18 years, but laws vary. In many jurisdictions, age of consent is a person's mental or functional age.<ref name = "hhriqf">[http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html] [http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/..%5Csyllabi99%5CApril%5C126545_syl.htm] [http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html] [http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1999/apr1999/gr_126545_1999.html] [http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/..%5Csyllabi99%5CApril%5C126545_syl.htm]</ref> As a result, victims can be of any chronological age if their mental age is below the age of consent.<ref name = "flalje">[http://www.lawskills.com/case/ga/id/41260/] [http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/..%5Csyllabi99%5CApril%5C126545_syl.htm] [http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html] [http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1999/apr1999/gr_126545_1999.html] [http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1998/aug1998/gr_126921_1998.html]</ref> Many jurisdictions regard any sexual activity by an adult involving a child as [[child sexual abuse]].

Age of consent may vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a [[position of trust]]. Some jurisdictions also make allowances for young people engaged in sexual acts with each other.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/01/crime-bill.html|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref>

====Incestuous relationships====
Most jurisdictions prohibit sexual activity between certain close relatives. These laws vary to some extent; such acts are called [[incest]]uous.

====Sexual abuse====
{{Main|Sexual abuse|Rape|Sexual assault}}

Non-consensual sexual activity or subjecting an unwilling person to witnessing a sexual activity are forms of [[sexual abuse]], as well as (in many countries) certain non-consensual paraphilias such as [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatophilia]] (indecent phonecalls), and non-consensual [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] (known as "[[indecent exposure]]" and "[[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]" respectively).<ref>[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/soo.pdf Sex Offenses and Offenders.
