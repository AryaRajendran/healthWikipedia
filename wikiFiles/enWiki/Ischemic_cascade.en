The '''ischemic (ischaemic) cascade''' is a series of biochemical reactions that are initiated in the [[brain]] and other aerobic tissues after seconds to minutes of [[ischemia]] (inadequate blood supply).<ref name="Becker ">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic558.htm |title=eMedicine - Stroke, Ischemic : Article by Joseph U Becker |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  This is typically secondary to [[stroke]], injury, or [[cardiac arrest]] due to [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].  Most ischemic [[neuron]]s that die do so due to the activation of chemicals produced during and after ischemia.<ref name="Internet Stroke Center">[http://www.strokecenter.org/ Stroke Center] of the Washington University School of Medicine.</ref>  The ischemic cascade usually goes on for two to three hours but can last for days, even after normal blood flow returns.<ref name="NINDS, 1999">{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/detail_stroke.htm |title=Stroke: Hope Through Research: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> 

A [[biochemical cascade|cascade]] is a series of events in which one event triggers the next, in a linear fashion.  Thus "ischemic cascade" is actually a misnomer, since in it events are not always linear: in some cases they are circular, and sometimes one event can cause or be caused by multiple events.<ref name="Hinkle and Bowman, 2003">{{cite journal |author=Hinkle JL, Bowman L |title=Neuroprotection for ischemic stroke |journal=J Neurosci Nurs |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=114–8 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12795039 |doi= 10.1097/01376517-200304000-00008|url=}}</ref>  In addition, cells receiving different amounts of blood may go through different chemical processes.  Despite these facts, the ischemic cascade can be generally characterized as follows:

# Lack of oxygen causes the neuron's normal process for making [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy to fail.
# The cell switches to [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]], producing [[lactic acid]].
# ATP-reliant [[Ion pump (biology)|ion transport pumps]] fail, causing the cell to become [[action potential|depolarized]], allowing [[ion]]s, including [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>++</sup>), to flow into the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. 
# The ion pumps can no longer transport calcium out of the cell, and intracellular calcium levels get too high. 
# The presence of calcium triggers the release of the excitatory [[amino acid]] [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]]. 
# Glutamate stimulates [[AMPA receptor]]s and Ca<sup>++</sup>-permeable [[NMDA receptor]]s, which open to allow more calcium into cells. 
# Excess calcium entry overexcites cells and causes the generation of harmful chemicals like [[free radical]]s, [[reactive oxygen species]] and calcium-dependent [[enzyme]]s such as [[calpain]], [[endonuclease]]s, [[ATPase]]s, and [[phospholipase]]s in a process called [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name="conway">Jill Conway. 2000.

# As the cell's membrane is broken down by phospholipases, it becomes more permeable, and more ions and harmful chemicals flow into the cell. 
# [[mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] break down, releasing toxins and [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] factors into the cell. 
# The [[caspase]]-dependent [[apoptosis]] cascade is initiated, causing cells to "commit suicide."
# If the cell dies through [[necrosis]], it releases glutamate and toxic chemicals into the environment around it. Toxins poison nearby [[neuron]]s, and glutamate can overexcite them. 
# If and when the brain is reperfused, a number of factors lead to [[reperfusion injury]]. 
# An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] response is mounted, and [[phagocytosis|phagocytic]] cells engulf damaged but still viable tissue.  
# Harmful chemicals damage the [[blood brain barrier]].
# [[Cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain) occurs due to leakage of large [[molecule]]s like [[albumins]] from blood vessels through the damaged [[blood brain barrier]].  These large molecules pull water into the brain tissue after them by [[osmosis]].  This "[[vasogenic edema]]" causes compression of and damage to brain tissue (Freye 2011; Acquired Mitochondropathy-A New Paradigm in Western Medicine Explaining Chronic Diseases).

==Mitigation of effects==
The fact that the ischemic cascade involves a number of steps has led doctors to suspect that [[Neuroprotection|neuroprotectants]] such as [[calcium channel blocker]]s or [[glutamate antagonists]] could be produced to interrupt the cascade at a single one of the steps, blocking the downstream effects.  Though initial trials for such neuroprotective drugs led many to be hopeful, until recently, human [[clinical trial]]s with neuroprotectants such as [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s were unsuccessful.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} 

On October 7, 2003, a U.S. patent number 6630507 entitled "Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and Neuroprotectants" was awarded to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, based on research carried out at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), and the [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] (NINDS). This patent claims that cannabinoids are "useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases such as ischemia, inflammatory ... and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as [[stroke]] and [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]]..."<ref name=patent6630507>{{US patent reference |number=6630507 |y=2003 |m=10 |d=07 |inventor=Hampson, Aidan J.; Axelrod, Julius; Grimaldi, Maurizio |title=Cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants}}</ref><ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6630507.PN.&OS=PN/6630507&RS=PN/6630507 U.S. Patent 6630507.]</ref>
