'''Cat allergy''' in humans is an [[allergy|allergic]] reaction to one or more allergens produced by [[cat]]s. The most common of these allergens are the glycoprotein [[Fel d 1]], secreted by the cat's [[sebaceous glands]] and [[Fel d 4]], which is expressed in saliva. An allergic reaction is a [[histamine]] reaction that is usually characterized by coughing, wheezing, chest tightening, itching, nasal congestion, rash, watering eyes, sneezing, chapped lips, and similar symptoms.

== Cat allergens ==
Five cat allergens have been described in medical literature. The two major allergens are [[Fel d 1]] (a [[secretoglobin]]) and [[Fel d 4]] (a [[lipocalin]]). The minor allergens include Fel d 2 (an [[albumin]]), Fel d 3 (a [[cystatin]]), and cat [[Immunoglobulin A|IgA]].<ref name="Adédoyin">Adédoyin J, et. al.

Retrieved on 2009-8-1.</ref>

Fel d 4 is the product of the cat [[major urinary protein]] gene. It is primarily expressed in the submandibular salivary gland and is deposited onto [[dander]] as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of cat allergic people have antibodies against Fel d 4.<ref name="pmid15544598">{{cite journal| author=Smith W| title=Fel d 4, a cat lipocalin allergen | journal=Clin Exp Allergy | year= 2004 | volume= 34 | issue= 11 | pages= 1732–8 | pmid=15544598 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2004.02090.x| author-separator=,| author2=Butler AJ| author3=Hazell LA| author4=Chapman MD| author5=Pomés A| author6=Nickels DG| display-authors=6| last7=Thomas| first7=W.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of an allergic reaction to cats include: swollen, red, itchy, watery eyes; nasal congestion, itchy nose, sneezing, chronic sore throat or itchy throat, coughing, wheezing, [[asthma]], [[hay fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Allergy to pets and animals|url=http://www.allergyclinic.co.uk/animals.htm|publisher=allergyclinic.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> hives or rash on the face or chest, or itchy skin. If a cat has scratched, licked, or bitten someone who is allergic to cats, redness will occur.<ref>{{cite web|title=WebMD - Cat Allergies|url=http://www.webmd.com/allergies/cat-allergies|publisher=WebMD, LLC.|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> Symptoms are often confused with a [[common cold]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Allergies to Cats|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=0+1278&aid=144|publisher=Foster & Smith, Inc.|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref>

==Coping with allergies==

===Lower exposure===
Allergens are airborne and survive for months or even years by themselves, hence removing anything that can trap and hold the allergens (carpet, rugs, pillows) and cleaning regularly and thoroughly with [[HEPA]] filters and [[Air purifier]] systems reduces risk. Frequent hand washing, especially after handling the cat, and washing hands prior to touching eyes, nose, or mouth, and limiting the cat to the outdoors or barring the animal from certain rooms, such as the bedroom or other rooms where much time is spent, may also reduce allergic reactions.

===Medications===
Cat allergies can often be controlled with over the counter or prescription medications.  Antihistamines and decongestants may provide allergy relief.<ref>Cat Allergies, WebMD, http://www.webmd.com/allergies/cat-allergies</ref>

===Allergy shots===
Some allergy sufferers find relief in [[immunotherapy]], a periodic injection therapy designed to stimulate the body's natural immune responses to the cat allergens.<ref>Clinical efficacy of specific immunotherapy to cat dander: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial  http://www.jacionline.org/medline/record/ivp_09547894_27_860.  Accessed 08 Jan 2011.</ref><ref>Immunotherapy with cat- and dog-dander extracts. V. Effects of 3 years of treatment.  http://www.jacionline.org/medline/record/ivp_00916749_87_955.  Accessed 08 Jan 2011.</ref>

===Synthetic epitope vaccine===
The Synthetic epitope vaccine is an in-development vaccine to provide a long term vaccine for allergies.<ref>{{cite pmid|16998509}}</ref>

===Cat Bathing===
Regularly bathing the cat may remove significant amounts of allergens from the fur.<ref>Evaluation of different techniques for washing cats: Quantitation of allergen removed from the cat and the effect on airborne Fel d 1 http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(97)70242-2/fulltext. Retrieved 10 Jan 2011.</ref> Furthermore, regularly brushing the cat will reduce the amount of loose fur (and its attached saliva) in the air. Feeding the cat a high quality diet with plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids will help keep the coat healthy and minimize dander.<ref>Human Allergies to Cats.  http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=0+1278&aid=144</ref>

==Hypoallergenic cats==
A '''hypoallergenic cat''' is a [[cat]] that is less likely to provoke an [[allergy|allergic reaction]] in humans. Although the topic is controversial, with many studies showing statistically significant results,<ref>Hypoallergenic Cats - Do They Exist?  http://www.cat-world.com.au/hypoallergenic-cats-do-they-exist Accessed 10 Jan 2011.</ref> owners' experience and recent clinical studies suggest that [[Siberian (cat)|Siberian cats]], [[Russian Blue|Russian Blue cats]], [[Devon Rex]] and [[Cornish Rex|Cornish Rex cats]], [[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian cats]], [[Balinese (cat)|Balinese cats]],[[Oriental Shorthair]] ,and several other breeds, especially females are likely to have low levels of [[Fel d 1]], the main allergenic protein.<ref>http://www.siberianresearch.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=125:siberian-allergen-levels&catid=45:allergens&Itemid=75</ref>

In 2006, the [[Allerca]] company announced the successful breeding of a line of [[hypoallergenic]] cats. However, no peer-reviewed studies have been done to confirm their claims and many scientists and consumers are skeptical of the company's assertions.<ref>[http://www.the-scientist.com/2007/1/1/32/1/ Felis Enigmaticus]</ref> 
The company has announced that on January 1, 2010 they will cease their breeding activities.<ref>{{cite web

Another company, Felix Pets, also claims to be developing a breed of hypoallergenic cat.<ref>Pepling, Racheal.

Accessed 13 March 2010.</ref>

==Cat gender and color==
Female cats produce a lower level of allergens than males, and neutered males produce a lower level of allergens than unaltered males.<ref>Sex difference in Fel d 1 allergen production. http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(96)70238-5/fulltext .
