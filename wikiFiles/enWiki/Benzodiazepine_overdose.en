'''[[Benzodiazepine]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]]''' describes the ingestion of one of the drugs in the benzodiazepine class in quantities greater than are recommended or generally practiced. Death as a result of taking an excessive dose of benzodiazepines alone is uncommon (vs [[Combined drug intoxication]]) but does occasionally happen.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Dart |first1=Richard C. |title=Medical Toxicology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qDf3AO8nILoC |edition=3rd |date=1 December 2003 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7817-2845-4 |pages=811}}</ref> Deaths after hospital admission are considered to be low.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Höjer J, Baehrendtz S, Gustafsson L |title=Benzodiazepine poisoning: experience of 702 admissions to an intensive care unit during a 14-year period |journal=J.

Severe symptoms include [[coma]] and [[respiratory depression]]. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose.

==Pathophysiology==
Benzodiazepines bind to a specific benzodiazepine receptor, thereby enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) and causing CNS depression. In overdose situations this pharmacological effect is extended leading to a more severe CNS depression and potentially coma <ref name="Gaudreault"/> or cardiac arrest.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=R,|coauthors=Green G, Melnick A.|title=Cardiac Arrest Caused by Oral Diazepam Intoxication|journal=Clinical Pediatrics|year=1975|volume=14|pages=842–844|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1157438|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref>  Benzodiazepine overdose related [[coma]] may be characterised by an alpha pattern with the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation being prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. [[Brain stem|Brain-stem]] auditory [[evoked potentials]] demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V.

==Epidemiology==
In a Swedish (2003) study benzodiazepines were implicated in 39% of suicides by drug poisoning in the elderly 1992-1996. [[Nitrazepam]] and [[flunitrazepam]] accounted for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides. In cases where benzodiazepines contributed to death, but were not the sole cause, drowning, typically in the bath, was a common method used. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish [[death certificates]]. In 72% of the cases, benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Thus, many of deaths associated with benzodiazepine overdoses may not be a direct result of the toxic effects but either due to being combined with other drugs or used as a tool to complete suicide using a different method, e.g. drowning.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Carlsten | first = A | coauthors = Waern M, Holmgren P, Allebeck P | year = 2003 | title = The role of benzodiazepines in elderly suicides | journal = Scand J Public Health | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 224–8 | pmid = 12850977 | doi = 10.1080/14034940210167966 }}</ref>

In a Swedish retrospective study of deaths of 1987, in 159 of 1587 autopsy cases benzodiazepines were found. In 44 of these cases the cause of death was [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]] or unclear. The remaining 115 deaths were due to accidents (N = 16), suicide (N = 60), [[drug addiction]] (N = 29) or [[alcoholism]] (N = 10). In a comparison of suicides and natural deaths, the concentrations both of flunitrazepam and nitrazepam (sleeping medications) were significantly higher among the suicides.
In four cases benzodiazepines were the sole cause of death.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Ericsson HR | coauthors = Holmgren P, Jakobsson SW, Lafolie P, De Rees B | date =  November 10, 1993 |  title = Benzodiazepine findings in autopsy material.

In Australia, a study of 16 deaths associated with toxic concentrations of benzodiazepines during the period of 5 years leading up to July 1994 found preexisting natural disease as a feature of 11 cases; 14 cases were suicides. Cases where other drugs, including ethanol, had contributed to the death were excluded. In the remaining five cases, death was caused solely by benzodiazepines. Nitrazepam and temazepam were the most prevalent drugs detected, followed by oxazepam and flunitrazepam.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Drummer OH | coauthors = Ranson DL | year = 1996 | month = December | title = Sudden death and benzodiazepines | journal = Am J Forensic Med Pathol | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 336–42 | pmid = 8947361  | doi = 10.1097/00000433-199612000-00012}}</ref> A review of self poisonings of 12 months 1976 - 1977 in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], found benzodiazepines implicated in 40% of the cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Large RG |title=Self-poisoning in Auckland reconsidered |journal=N.
