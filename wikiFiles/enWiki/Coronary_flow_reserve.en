'''Coronary flow reserve''' '''(CFR)''' is the maximum increase in blood flow through the [[coronary arteries]] above the normal resting volume.<ref name="CFR Chest pain">[http://www.echoincontext.com/2001tele/41.01Rado-Forster.pdf] Julia Radó; Tamás Forster "The significance of coronary flow reserve in chest pain syndromes" (2001) ''Echo in Context''</ref>  Its measurement is often used in medicine to assist in the treatment of conditions affecting the coronary arteries and to determine the efficacy of treatments used.

==Overview==
When demand for oxygen in the [[myocardium]] is increased, the [[vascular resistance]] of the coronary arteries has the ability to reduce, and this can increase the volume of blood passing through the blood vessels.  This reduction occurs because the arteries [[Vasodilation|dilate]], which causes an increase in the diameter of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].<ref>[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Hemodynamics/H008.htm Critical Stenosis] ''Cardiovascular Physiology'' Retrieved 9th December 2009</ref><ref name="Chest Pain">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1025381/] D R Holdright; D C Lindsay; D Clarke; K Fox; P A Poole-Wilson; P Collins (1993) "Coronary flow reserve in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries" ''British Heart Journal''</ref>  The greatest potential for this change is normally in the branches ([[arterioles]]) of the coronary artery that penetrate the myocardium, rather than those on the surface of the heart.

==Measurement==
Coronary flow reserve can be measured through a variety of methods, including digital subtraction [[cineangiography]] with [[coronary catheterization]],<ref>[http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/8/725] P. W. SERRUYS; F. ZIJLSTR; G. J. LAARMAN; H. H. C. REIBER; K. BEATT; JOS ROELANDT (1989) "A comparison of two methods to measure coronary flow reserve in the setting of coronary angioplasty: intracoronary blood flow velocity measurements with a Doppler catheter, and digital subtraction cineangiography" ''European Heart Journal''</ref>  [[doppler echocardiography]],<ref name="Anderson-Fabry">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1097744/] Paweł Petkow Dimitrow; Marek Krzanowski; Anetta Undas (2005) "Reduced coronary flow reserve in Anderson-Fabry disease measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography" ''Cardiovascular Ultrasound''</ref> and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/dgs/2008/00000068/00000005/art00002]  Maurizio Galderisi; Arcangelo  D'Errico (2008) "Beta-Blockers and Coronary Flow Reserve: The Importance of a Vasodilatory Action" ''Ingenta''</ref>

==Medical implications==
Coronary flow reserve is used in diagnostics and treatment of patients suffering from conditions such as [[coronary artery disease]] and [[Cardiac syndrome X|syndrome X]].<ref>[http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/jac/article/PII073510979400544Z/abstract] Manfred Zehetgruber; Gerald Mundigler; Günter Christ; Deddo Mörtl; Peter Probst; Helmut Baumgartner; Gerald Maurer; Peter Siostrzonek (1994) "Estimation of coronary flow reserve by transesophageal coronary sinus Doppler measurements in patients with syndrome X and patients with significant left coronary artery disease" ''Journal of the American College of Cardiology''</ref>  In the treatment of these conditions, [[vasodilator]]s are used to allow sufficient blood to flow past a [[stenosis]], for example, and the measurement of CFR enables the efficacy of such interventions to be measured.
<ref name="Chest Pain"/>  In patients suffering from [[Anderson-Fabry disease]], there is evidence to suggest that CFR can be reduced.<ref name="Anderson-Fabry"/>
When coronary flow reserve is used in medicine, it is often expressed with a numerical value, which is formed by dividing the maximal coronary blood flow by resting blood flow.  This allows for an objective view, which can aid diagnosis and treatment.<ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/82/4/1438] OM Hess; MJ McGillem; SF DeBoe; IM Pinto; KP Gallagher; GB Mancini (1990) "Determination of coronary flow reserve by parametric imaging" ''Circulation: American Heart Association''</ref>
