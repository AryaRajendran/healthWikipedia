'''Nephronophthisis''' is a [[genetic disorder]] of the [[kidneys]] which affects children. It is classified as a [[medullary cystic kidney disease]]. 

The disorder is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] fashion and, although rare, is the most common genetic cause of childhood kidney failure. 

It is a form of [[ciliopathy]].<ref name="pmid21071979">{{cite journal |author=Hurd TW, Hildebrandt F |title=Mechanisms of nephronophthisis and related ciliopathies |journal=Nephron Exp. Nephrol. |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=e9–e14 |year=2011 |pmid=21071979 |doi=10.1159/000320888 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=000320888 |pmc=2992643}}</ref>

Its incidence has been estimated to be 0.9 per million people in the United States, and 1 in 50.000 births in Canada.<ref>[http://books.google.se/books?id=P7sgOWz-iusC&pg=PA831 page 831], Chapter 35, in: {{Cite book  | last1 = Avner | first1 = Ellis D. | last2 = Harmon | first2 = William | last3 = Niaudet | first3 = Patrick | last4 = Yoshikawa | first4 = Norishige | title = Pediatric Nephrology (Avner, Pediatric Nephrology) | date =  | publisher = Springer | location =  | isbn = 978-3-540-76327-7 | pages =  }} (stating the incidence in the United States as 9 per 8.3 million people.</ref>

== Symptoms ==

Infantile, juvenile, and adolescent forms of nephronophthisis have been identified. Although the range of characterizations is broad, patients typically present with [[polyuria]] (production of large volume of urine), [[polydipsia]] (excessive liquid intake), and mild [[proteinuria]] (the abnormal appearance of protein in the urine), and after several months to years, [[end-stage kidney disease]], a condition necessitating either [[dialysis]] or a [[kidney transplant]] in order to survive.  

Approximately 10% of individuals with nephronophthisis also have so-called "extra-renal symptoms" which can include blindness, liver problems, severe global developmental delay or mental retardation, and neurologic involvement in which the [[cerebellum]] is affected.

== Histology ==

[[Histologically]], nephronophthisis is characterized by fibrosis and the formation of [[cysts]] in a specific region of the kidney.  In contrast to other cystic diseases of the kidney in which the kidneys are larger than usual, in nephronophthisis the kidneys are small to normal in size.

== Pathophysiology ==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Nephronophthisis has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]] 

From sequencing the [[DNA]] of individuals and families with nephronophthisis, scientists have identified thus far 8 different genes in which [[mutations]] can cause the disease.  These genes are called [[NPHP1]], [[NPHP2]], [[NPHP3]], [[NPHP4]], [[NPHP5]], [[NPHP6]], [[NPHP7]], and [[NPHP8]], and the [[proteins]] for which they encode are known as the [[nephrocystin]]s.  Although the biological function of these proteins is not yet known, they all localize at least in part to an [[organelle]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]] called the primary [[cilia]].

=== Relation to other rare genetic disorders ===

Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related, may be, in fact, highly related in the [[genotype|genetypical]] root cause of the widely-varying, [[phenotype|phenotypically]]-observed [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]].  Thus, Nephronophthisis is a [[ciliopathy]].  Other known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney]] and [[polycystic liver disease|liver disease]], [[Alstrom syndrome]], [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]] and some forms of [[retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal
