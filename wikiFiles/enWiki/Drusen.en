'''Drusen''' (singular, "druse") are tiny yellow or white accumulations of extracellular material that build up between [[Bruch's membrane]] and the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] of the [[human eye|eye]]. The presence of a few small ("hard") drusen is normal with advancing age, and most people over 40 have some hard drusen. However, the presence of larger and more numerous drusen in the [[macula]] is a common early sign of age-related [[macular degeneration]] (AMD).

==Classification==
Drusen associated with aging and macular degeneration are distinct from another clinical entity, [[optic disc drusen]], which is present on the [[optic nerve]] head.<ref name="pmid15513010">{{cite journal |author=Davis PL, Jay WM |title=Optic nerve head drusen |journal=Semin Ophthalmol |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=222–42 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=15513010 |doi=10.1080/08820530390895244 |url=}}</ref> Both age-related drusen and optic disc drusen can be observed by [[ophthalmoscopy]].  On CT scans of the orbits or head, calcification at the head of the optic nerve without change in size of globe strongly suggests drusen in a middle-age or elderly patient.

Whether drusen promote AMD or are symptomatic of an underlying process that causes both drusen and AMD is not known, but they are indicators of increased risk of the complications of AMD.<ref>{{cite web |title=Age-Related Macular Degeneration |url=http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts.asp |date=March 2008 |publisher=[[National Eye Institute]] |accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref>

'Hard drusen' may coalesce into 'soft drusen' which is a manifestation of macular degeneration.<ref>http://www.agingeye.net/maculardegen/maculardegeninformation.php</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Drusen were initially described by [[Franciscus Donders]]<ref>{{cite journal |author= Donders FC |title=Beitrage zur pathologischen Anatomie des Auges |journal=Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=106–18 |year=1855 |month=March |pmid= | doi=10.1007/BF02720791 |url=}}</ref> who called them "Colloidkugeln" ([[colloid]] spheres). Later, [[Heinrich Müller (physiologist)|Heinrich Müller]] named them for the German word for [[geode]], based on their glittering appearance.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Müller H |title=Anatomische Beiträge zur Ophthalmologie - 1) Untersuchungen über die Glashäute des Auges, insbesondere die Glaslamelle der Chorioidea und ihre senilen Veränderungen |journal=Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=1–69 |year=1856 |month=January |pmid= | doi=10.1007/BF02720657 |url=}}</ref> In view of their location between the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE)  and its vascular supply, the [[choriocapillaris]], it is possible that drusen deprive the RPE and [[photoreceptor cell]]s of oxygen and nutrients. Interestingly, drusen always develop above the so-called pillars of [[choriocapillaris]] that is the area between two microvessels.<ref name="pmid15326099">{{cite journal |author=Lengyel I, Tufail A, Hosaini HA, Luthert P, Bird AC, Jeffery G |title=Association of drusen deposition with choroidal intercapillary pillars in the aging human eye |journal=Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=2886–92 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15326099 |doi=10.1167/iovs.03-1083 |url=}}</ref>

The source of the [[proteins]] and [[lipids]] in drusen is also not clear, with potential contributions by both the RPE and the [[choroid]].  Several trace elements are present in drusen,<ref name="pmid1543459">{{cite journal |author=van der Schaft TL, de Bruijn WC, Mooy CM, Ketelaars DA, de Jong PT |title=Element analysis of the early stages of age-related macular degeneration |journal=Arch. Ophthalmol. |volume=110 |issue=3 |pages=389–94 |year=1992 |month=March |pmid=1543459 |doi= |url=}}</ref> probably the most concentrated being zinc.<ref name="pmid17313944"/> The protein composition of drusen includes [[apolipoproteins]] and members of the [[complement system]].  Zinc in drusen have been suggested to play a role in drusen formation by precipitating and inhibiting the elements of the complement cascade, especially complement factor H.<ref name="pmid17313944">{{cite journal |author=Lengyel I, Flinn JM, Peto T, ''et al.'' |title=High concentration of zinc in sub-retinal pigment epithelial deposits |journal=Exp. Eye Res. |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=772–80 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17313944 |doi=10.1016/j.exer.2006.12.015 |url=}}</ref>

The presence of molecules that regulate [[inflammation]] in drusen has led some investigators to conclude that these deposits are  product of the [[immune system]].<ref name="pmid11587915">{{cite journal |author=Hageman GS, Luthert PJ, Victor Chong NH, Johnson LV, Anderson DH, Mullins RF |title=An integrated hypothesis that considers drusen as biomarkers of immune-mediated processes at the RPE-Bruch's membrane interface in aging and age-related macular degeneration |journal=Prog Retin Eye Res |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=705–32 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11587915 |doi= 10.1016/S1350-9462(01)00010-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1350946201000106}}</ref>
