'''Cherry angiomas''', also known as '''Campbell De Morgan spots''' or '''Senile angiomas''',<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |year=2006 |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |edition=10th |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |page=595 |oclc=62736861}}</ref> are [[red|cherry red]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000005052|cherry angioma}}</ref> [[papules]] on the skin containing an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels. They are the most common kind of [[angioma]]. They are  called Campbell de Morgan spots after the nineteenth-century [[United Kingdom|British]] [[surgeon]] [[Campbell De Morgan]], who first noted and described them.

The frequency of cherry angiomas increases with age.

==Characteristics==
[[File:SkinTumors-PB061061.JPG|thumb|Cherry hemangioma, [[H&E stain]]]]
Cherry angiomas are made up of clusters of [[Capillary|capillaries]] at the surface of the [[skin]], forming a small round dome ("[[papule]]"), which may be flat topped. They range in [[colour]] from bright [[red]] to [[purple]].  When they first develop, they may be only a tenth of a millimeter in diameter and almost flat, appearing as small red dots. However, they then usually grow to about one or two millimeters across, and sometimes to a centimeter or more in diameter.  As they grow larger, they tend to expand in thickness, and may take on the raised and rounded shape of a [[dome]]. Multiple adjoining angiomas are said to form a ''polypoid angioma''. Because the [[blood vessel]]s comprising an angioma are so close to the skin's surface, cherry angiomas may [[Bleeding|bleed]] profusely if they are injured.

One study found that the majority of capillaries in cherry hemangiomas are [[Capillary#Types|fenestrated]] because of staining for [[carbonic anhydrase]] activity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eichhorn |first1=M |last2=Jungkunz |first2=W |last3=Wörl |first3=J |last4=Marsch |first4=WC |title=Carbonic anhydrase is abundant in fenestrated capillaries of cherry hemangioma |journal=Acta dermato-venereologica |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=51–3 |year=1994 |pmid=7908484}}</ref>

==Cause==
Cherry angiomas appear spontaneously in many people in middle age but can also, although less common, occur in young people. They can also occur in an aggressive eruptive manner in any age. The underlying cause for the development of cherry angiomas is not understood, probably due to a lack of interest in the subject, given that they only rarely indicate internal [[malignancy]]. 

Taken together with previous evidence, the present ﬁndings suggest that this hemangioma may have occurred through two different mechanisms: [[angiogenesis]] (the formation of new blood) and [[vasculogenesis]] (the formation of new veins).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kishimoto,|first=Saburo|coauthors=Hideya Takenaka, Hideya Takenaka, Hideya Takenaka, and Hirokazu Yasuno|title=Glomeruloid hemangioma in POEMS syndrome shows two different immunophenotypic endothelial cells|journal=Cutaneous Pathology|year=2000|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.proxylib.csueastbay.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=cbaee6e3-71e1-4643-9092-d7f8fc42b1a9%40sessionmgr12&vid=27&hid=15}}</ref>

The first study trying to bring light to the molecular and genetic mechanisms behind cherry/senile hemangioma was published in 2010.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nakashima |first1=T |last2=Jinnin |first2=M |last3=Etoh |first3=T |last4=Fukushima |first4=S |last5=Masuguchi |first5=S |last6=Maruo |first6=K |last7=Inoue |first7=Y |last8=Ishihara |first8=T |last9=Ihn |first9=H |title=Down-regulation of mir-424 contributes to the abnormal angiogenesis via MEK1 and cyclin E1 in senile hemangioma: its implications to therapy |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e14334 |year=2010 |pmid=21179471 |pmc=3001869 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0014334 |editor1-last=Egles |editor1-first=Christophe}}</ref> The study found that the level of [[MicroRNA]] 424 is significantly reduced in senile hemangiomas compared to normal skin resulting in increased protein expression of [[MEK1]] and [[Cyclin E1]]. By inhibiting mir-424 in normal [[endothelial cells]] they could observe the same increased protein expression of [[MEK1]] and [[Cyclin E1]] which, important for the development of senile hemangioma; induced cell proliferation of the [[endothelial cells]]. They also found that targeting [[MEK1]] and [[Cyclin E1]] with [[small interfering RNA]] decreased the number of endothelial cells.

A significant increase in the density of [[mast cells]] has been seen in cherry hemangiomas compared with normal skin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hagiwara |first1=K |last2=Khaskhely |first2=NM |last3=Uezato |first3=H |last4=Nonaka |first4=S |title=Mast cell "densities" in vascular proliferations: a preliminary study of pyogenic granuloma, portwine stain, cavernous hemangioma, cherry angioma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and malignant hemangioendothelioma |journal=The Journal of dermatology |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=577–86 |year=1999 |pmid=10535252}}</ref>

==Treatment==
On the rare occasions that they require removal, traditionally [[cryosurgery]] or [[electrosurgery]] (destroying/burning the tissue with a probe that has an electric current<ref>http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/cysts-lumps-bumps</ref>) have been used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aversa |first1=AJ |last2=Miller Of |first2=3rd |title=Cryo-curettage of cherry angiomas |journal=The Journal of dermatologic surgery and oncology |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=930–1 |year=1983 |pmid=6630708}}</ref> More recently [[pulsed dye laser]] or [[Intense Pulsed Light]] (IPL) treatment has also been used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dawn |first1=G. |last2=Gupta |first2=G. |title=Comparison of potassium titanyl phosphate vascular laser and hyfrecator in the treatment of vascular spiders and cherry angiomas |journal=Clinical and Experimental Dermatology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=581–3 |year=2003 |pmid=14616818 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2230.2003.01352.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fodor |first1=Lucian |last2=Ramon |first2=Ytzhack |last3=Fodor |first3=Adriana |last4=Carmi |first4=Nurit |last5=Peled |first5=Isaac J. |last6=Ullmann |first6=Yehuda |title=A Side-by-Side Prospective Study of Intense Pulsed Light and Nd:YAG Laser Treatment for Vascular Lesions |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=164–70 |year=2006 |pmid=16432325 |doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000196579.14954.d6}}</ref> 

If they are cosmetically unappealing or are subject to bleeding, angiomas may be removed by lasers or electrocautery -- the process of burning or destroying tissue by use of a small probe with an electric current running through it. Removal may cause scarring.

Future treatment based on a locally acting inhibitor of [[MEK1]] and [[Cyclin E1]] could possibly be an option. A natural [[MEK1]] inhibitor is [[Myricetin]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=KW |last2=Kang |first2=NJ |last3=Rogozin |first3=EA |last4=Kim |first4=HG |last5=Cho |first5=YY |last6=Bode |first6=AM |last7=Lee |first7=HJ |last8=Surh |first8=YJ |last9=Bowden |first9=GT |title=Myricetin is a novel natural inhibitor of neoplastic cell transformation and MEK1 |journal=Carcinogenesis |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1918–27 |year=2007 |pmid=17693661 |doi=10.1093/carcin/bgm110}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=JE |last2=Kwon |first2=JY |last3=Lee |first3=DE |last4=Kang |first4=NJ |last5=Heo |first5=YS |last6=Lee |first6=KW |last7=Lee |first7=HJ |title=MKK4 is a novel target for the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression by myricetin |journal=[[Biochemical pharmacology]] |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=412–21 |year=2009 |pmid=19026990 |doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2008.10.027}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
In most patients, the number and size of cherry angiomas increases with advancing age. They are harmless, except in very rare cases that involve a sudden appearance of many angiomas, which can be a sign of a developing internal malignancy.

==Epidemiology==
Cherry angiomas occur in all races, ethnic backgrounds, and both sexes.
