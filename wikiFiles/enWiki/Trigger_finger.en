{{wikt|trigger finger}}
'''Trigger finger''', '''trigger thumb''', or '''trigger digit''', is a common disorder characterized by catching, snapping or locking of the involved finger flexor tendon, associated with dysfunction and pain.<ref name="Makkouk_2008">{{cite journal | author=Makkouk et al. | title=Trigger finger: etiology, evaluation, and treatment | journal=Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med | year=2008 | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages= 92–6}}</ref> A disparity in size between the flexor tendon and the surrounding retinacular pulley system, most commonly at the level of the first annular (A1) pulley, results in difficulty flexing or extending the finger and the “triggering” phenomenon.<ref name="Makkouk_2008" /> The label of trigger finger is used because when the finger unlocks, it pops back suddenly, as if releasing a trigger on a gun.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is made almost exclusively by history and physical examination alone.  More than one finger may be affected at a time, though it usually affects the index, thumb, middle, or ring finger.  The triggering is usually more pronounced late at night and into the morning, or while gripping an object firmly.

==Treatment==

Injection of the tendon sheath with a [[corticosteroid]] is effective over weeks to months in more than half of patients.<ref name="Baumgarten_2007" />

When corticosteroid injection fails, the problem is predictably resolved by a relatively simple surgical procedure (usually outpatient, under local anesthesia). The surgeon will cut the sheath that is restricting the tendon.  

One recent study in the Journal of Hand Surgery suggests that the most cost-effective treatment is two trials of corticosteroid injection, followed by open release of the first annular pulley.<ref name="Kerrigan_2009">{{cite journal | author=Kerrigan CL, Stanwix MG | title=Using evidence to minimize the cost of trigger finger care | journal=J Hand Surg Am | date=2009 Jul–Aug | volume=34 | issue=6 | pages=997–1005 | pmid=19643287}}</ref>  Choosing surgery immediately is the most expensive option and is often not necessary for resolution of symptoms.<ref name="Kerrigan_2009" /> More recently, a randomized controlled trial comparing corticosteroid injection with needle release and open release of the A1 pulley reported that only 57% of patients responded to corticosteroid injection (defined as being free of triggering symptoms for greater than 6 months). This is compared to a percutaneous needle release (100% success rate) and open release (100% success rate). <ref name="Sato_2012">{{cite journal | author=Sato SS, et al | |title=Treatment of trigger finger: randomized clinical trial comparing the methods of corticosteroid injection, percutaneous release and open surgery| journal=Rheumatology | year=2012 | volume=51 | pages=93–99| pmid=22039269}}</ref> This is somewhat consistent with the most recent Cochrane Systematic Review of corticosteroid injection for trigger finger which found only 2 pseudo-randomized controlled trials for a total pooled success rate of only 37%. <ref name="Peters-Veluthamaningal_2009>{{cite journal | author=Peters-Veluthamaningal C, et al | journal=The Cochrane Library | issue=1 | year=2009}}</ref> However, this systematic review has not been updated since 2009.

There is a theoretical greater risk of nerve damage associated with the percutaneous needle release as the technique is performed without seeing the A1 pulley.<ref name="Bain_1995>{{cite journal | author=Bain GI, et al | title=Percutaneous A1 pulley release: a cadaveric study | journal=J Hand Surg Am | year=1995 | volume=20 | pages=781–784 }}</ref>

Investigative treatment options with limited scientific support include: [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]; occupational or physical therapy; steroid iontophoresis treatment; splinting; therapeutic ultrasound, phonophoresis (ultrasound with an anti-inflammatory dexamethasone cream); and [[Acupuncture]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Prognosis==
The [[natural history of disease]] for trigger finger remains uncertain.

There is some evidence that idiopathic trigger finger behaves differently in people with [[diabetes]].<ref name="Baumgarten_2007">{{cite journal | author=Baumgarten KM, Gerlach D, Boyer MI | title=Corticosteroid injection in diabetic patients with trigger finger. A prospective, randomized, controlled double-blinded study | journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (American) | date=2007 Dec | volume=89 | issue=12 | pages=2604–2611 | pmid=18056491}}</ref>

Recurrent triggering is unusual after successful injection and rare after successful surgery.

While difficulty extending the [[proximal interphalangeal joint]] may persist for months, it benefits from exercises to stretch the finger straighter.

==Epidemiology==
More than one potential causes have been described but the etiology remains [[idiopathic]].<ref name="Makkouk_2008" /> It has also been called [[stenosing tenosynovitis]] (specifically ''digital tenovaginitis stenosans''), but this may be a misnomer, as inflammation is not a predominant feature.

It has been speculated that repetitive forceful use of a digit leads to narrowing of the [[fibrous digital sheath]] in which it runs, but there is little scientific data to support this theory. The relationship of trigger finger to work activities is debatable and scientific evidence for<ref>{{cite journal | author=Gorsche R, Wiley JP, Renger R, Brant R, Gemer TY, Sasyniuk TM | title=Prevalence and incidence of stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) in a meat-packing plant | journal=J Occup Environ Med | date=1998 Jun | volume=40 | issue=6 | pages=556–60 | pmid=9636936}}</ref> and against<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kasdan ML, Leis VM, Lewis K, Kasdan AS | title=Trigger finger: not always work related | journal=J Ky Med Assoc | date=1996 Nov | volume=94 | issue=11 | pages=498–9 | pmid=8973080}}</ref> hand use as a cause exist.
