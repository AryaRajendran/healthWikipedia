'''Etanercept''' (trade name '''Enbrel''') is a [[biopharmaceutical]] that treats autoimmune diseases by interfering with [[tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF; a soluble inflammatory cytokine) by acting as a [[TNF inhibitor]]. It has U.S. F.D.A. approval to treat [[rheumatoid]], juvenile rheumatoid and [[psoriatic arthritis]], plaque psoriasis and [[ankylosing spondylitis]]. [[TNF-alpha]] is the "master regulator" of the inflammatory (immune) response in many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive immune response. Etanercept has the potential to treat these diseases by inhibiting TNF-alpha.<ref name="titleTNF defined as a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases - Nature Medicine">{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v9/n10/full/nm939.html |title=TNF defined as a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases - Nature Medicine |accessdate=2008-01-10 |work=}}</ref>

Etanercept is a [[fusion protein]] produced by [[recombinant DNA]]. It fuses the TNF receptor to the constant end of the IgG1 antibody. First, the developers isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for soluble [[CD120|TNF receptor 2]], which is a receptor that binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Second, they isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for the [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc]] end of [[immunoglobulin G1]] (IgG1). Third, they linked the DNA for TNF receptor 2 to the DNA for IgG1 Fc. Finally, they expressed the linked DNA to produce a protein that links the protein for TNF receptor 2 to the protein for IgG1 Fc.

The prototypic fusion protein was first synthesized and shown to be highly active and unusually stable as a modality for blockade of TNF in vivo in the early 1990s by [[Bruce A. Beutler]], an academic researcher then at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]], and his colleagues.<ref>Peppel,K. et al.

It is a large molecule, with a molecular weight of 150 [[kDa]]., that binds to TNFα and decreases its role in disorders involving excess inflammation in humans and other animals, including [[autoimmune diseases]] such as [[ankylosing spondylitis]],<ref name="pmid17389658">{{cite journal |author=Braun J, McHugh N, Singh A, Wajdula JS, Sato R |title=Improvement in patient-reported outcomes for patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with etanercept 50 mg once-weekly and 25 mg twice-weekly |journal=[[Rheumatology (Oxford)]] |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=999–1004 |year=2007 |pmid=17389658 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/kem069 |url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/46/6/999}}</ref> [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and, potentially, in a variety of other disorders mediated by excess TNFα.

In North America, etanercept is co-marketed by [[Amgen]] and [[Pfizer]] under the trade name Enbrel in two separate formulations, one in powder form, the other as a pre-mixed liquid.  Wyeth is the sole marketer of Enbrel outside North America excluding Japan where [[Takeda Pharmaceuticals]] markets the drug.

Etanercept is an example of a [[protein]]-based drug created using the tools of [[biotechnology]] and conceived through an understanding afforded by modern [[cell biology]].

==Development==
Etanercept was developed by researchers at Immunex, and was released for commercial use in late 1998, soon after the release of [[infliximab]] (''Remicade'') – the first chimeric [[monoclonal antibody]] against TNFα to be marketed for clinical use.

Etanercept is a [[protein dimer|dimeric molecule]],<ref name="pmid11712048">{{cite journal |author=Smith KJ, Skelton HG |title=Rapid onset of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after starting tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor IgG1-Fc fusion complex therapy |journal=[[J. Am. Acad. Dermatol.]] |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=953–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11712048 |doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.117725 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190-9622(01)47789-9}}</ref> and this dimeric structure is necessary for its proper therapeutic activity. During its development at Immunex Corporation an earlier monomeric version did not have sufficient biologic activity.

==Mode of action==
It reduces the effect of naturally present TNF, and hence is a [[TNF inhibitor]], functioning as a [[decoy receptor]] that binds to TNF.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zalevsky J, Secher T, Ezhevsky SA, ''et al.'' |title=Dominant-negative inhibitors of soluble TNF attenuate experimental arthritis without suppressing innate immunity to infection |journal=J. Immunol. |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=1872–83 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17641054 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) is a [[cytokine]] produced by [[lymphocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s, two types of [[white blood cell]]s. It mediates the immune response by increasing the transport of white blood cells to sites of [[inflammation]], and through additional molecular mechanisms which initiate and amplify inflammation. Inhibition of its action by etanercept reduces the inflammatory response which is especially useful for treating [[autoimmune disease]]s.

There are two types of TNF [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s: those found embedded in white blood cells that respond to TNF by releasing other cytokines, and ''soluble'' TNF receptors which are used to deactivate TNF and blunt the immune response. In addition, TNF receptors are found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells (red blood cells, which are not nucleated, do not contain TNF receptors on their surface). Etanercept mimics the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors, the difference being that etanercept, because it is a fusion protein rather than a simple TNF receptor, has a greatly extended half-life in the bloodstream, and therefore a more profound and long-lasting biologic effect than a naturally occurring soluble TNF receptor.<ref name="pmid16135466">{{cite journal |author=Madhusudan S, Muthuramalingam SR, Braybrooke JP, ''et al.'' |title=Study of etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor, in recurrent ovarian cancer |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=23 |issue=25 |pages=5950–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16135466 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2005.04.127 |url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/23/25/5950}}</ref>

==Structure==
Etanercept is made from the combination of two naturally occurring soluble human 75-kilodalton TNF receptors linked to an Fc portion of an IgG1. The effect is an artificially engineered dimeric fusion protein.

==Licensed indications==
In the USA the FDA has licenced Enbrel for :
*Moderate to Severe [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (RA) (Nov 1998)
*Moderate to Severe Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) (1999)
*[[Psoriatic Arthritis]] (2002)
*[[Ankylosing Spondylitis]] (AS) (July 2003)<ref>http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01240.html FDA</ref>
*Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis (April 2004)

==Administration==
Enbrel is marketed as a [[freeze drying|lyophylized]] powder in 25&nbsp;mg vials which must be reconstituted with a [[diluent]] and then [[injection (medicine)|injected subcutaneously]], typically by the patient at home.

Because patients with arthritis found the reconstitution procedure difficult, it was made available as pre-filled 50&nbsp;mg/ml syringes in late 2004 and a single-use 50&nbsp;mg autoinjector "pen" was brought to market in mid-2006.<ref name="titleEnbrel and Humira Now Have Automated Delivery System">{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkins-arthritis.org/arthritis-news/2006/automated_delivery.html |title=Enbrel and Humira Now Have Automated Delivery System |accessdate=2008-01-10 |work=}}</ref>

It cannot be administered [[route of administration|orally]], because the [[digestive system]] would destroy the drug.

FDA approved dose is 25&nbsp;mg BIW (twice weekly) or 50&nbsp;mg QW (once weekly).

== Safety ==

On May 2, 2008, the FDA placed a black box warning on etanercept due to a number of serious infections associated with the drug.<ref name="Wyeth and Amgen">{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/21965cf0a650a8b5897142bfcbccb427.htm |title=Wyeth and Amgen heighten warning of life-threatening infections on skin drug Enbrel |accessdate=2008-05-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080505133653/http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/21965cf0a650a8b5897142bfcbccb427.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-05}}</ref>

TNF-alpha inhibitors can have [[immunosuppressant]] properties. From the company website: "ENBREL can cause serious side effects including: New infections or worsening of infections you already have; hepatitis B can become active if you already have had it; nervous system problems, such as multiple sclerosis, seizures, or inflammation of the nerves of the eyes; blood problems (some fatal); new or worsening heart failure; new or worsening psoriasis; allergic reactions; autoimmune reactions, including a lupus-like syndrome and autoimmune hepatitis." <ref name="titlePrescribing Information - ENBREL">{{cite web |url=http://www.enbrel.com/prescribing-information.jsp |title=Prescribing Information - ENBREL |accessdate=2008-01-10 |format= |work=}}</ref>

==Cost==
The cost of Enbrel for arthritis is approximately $20,000 a year.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/business/amgens-new-enbrel-patent-may-undercut-health-care-plan.html Patent for Amgen Drug May Undercut Health Care Plan], By ANDREW POLLACK, New York Times, November 23, 2011</ref><ref>[http://seattletimes.com/html/health/2008120449_drugs18m.html What's behind the whopping price tags on the newest generation of drugs;] The story behind the production of Enbrel, Amgen's popular rheumatoid- arthritis drug, provides insights as to why bioengineered drugs are so expensive.

==Experimental and off-label uses==
Given the central role of TNF-alpha in many diseases, etanercept is being studied as treatment for a number of these disease, including over 150 clinical trials.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov FDA Clinical Trials database]</ref>  This includes certain forms of [[vasculitis]] (such as [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], in which it was not effective).<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Etanercept plus standard therapy for Wegener's granulomatosis |journal=N.

The patent on Enbrel was originally set to expire on October 23, 2012,<ref>http://www.uspto.gov/patents/resources/terms/156.html</ref> but, in the United States, an extension of the patent, for another 16 years, has been granted.<ref>http://www.burrillreport.com/article-amgen_issued_new_patent_on_ra_drug_enbrel.html</ref> Even before the extension it was unlikely that a generic would have been available. As a biologic, etanercept is subject to different laws than those applicable to chemical formulations. Currently many countries, including the United States, do not permit the manufacture of generic biologics. However, the [[European Union]] does currently have in place a system to approve generic biologics ([[biosimilars]]) which "requires mandatory clinical testing and periodic review".<ref>http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dltr/articles/2008dltr0009.html</ref> The United States Congress was reviewing a bill to introduce such a process in the United States; however, the bill stalled in the House Judiciary Committee.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1427</ref>
