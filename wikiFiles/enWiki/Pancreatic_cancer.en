'''Pancreatic cancer''' is a [[malignant]] [[neoplasm]] originating from transformed cells arising in tissues forming the [[pancreas]].  The most common type of pancreatic [[cancer]], accounting for 95% of these tumors, is [[adenocarcinoma]] (tumors exhibiting glandular architecture on light microscopy) arising within the [[exocrine]] component of the pancreas. A minority arise from [[islet cell]]s, and are classified as [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s. The signs and symptoms that eventually lead to the diagnosis depend on the location, the size, and the tissue type of the tumor, and may include [[abdominal pain]], lower back pain, and [[jaundice]] (if the tumor compresses the [[bile duct]]).

* Family history: 5–10% of pancreatic cancer patients have a family history of pancreatic cancer. The genes have not been identified. Pancreatic cancer has been associated with the following syndromes: [[autosomal recessive]] [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] and autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in the [[BRCA2]] [[gene]] and [[PALB2]] [[gene]], [[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]] due to mutations in the STK11 tumor suppressor gene, [[hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer]] (Lynch syndrome), familial adenomatous polyposis, and the familial atypical multiple mole melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome (FAMMM-PC) due to mutations in the [[CDKN2A]] tumor suppressor gene.<ref name="pmid17625148" /><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Efthimiou E, Crnogorac-Jurcevic T, Lemoine NR, Brentnall TA|title=Inherited predisposition to pancreatic cancer|journal=Gut|volume=48|issue=2|pages=143–7|year=2001|month=February|pmid=11156628|pmc=1728218|doi=10.1136/gut.48.2.143}}</ref> There may also be a history of familial pancreatitis.<ref name="pmid17625148" />

==Diagnosis==
[[File:MBq cystic-carcinoma-pancreas.jpg|thumb|Axial CT image with i.v. contrast. Macrocystic adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head.]]

Most patients with pancreatic cancer experience pain, weight loss, or [[jaundice]].<ref name="pmid1589710">{{Cite journal|author=Bakkevold KE, Arnesjø B, Kambestad B|title=Carcinoma of the pancreas and papilla of Vater: presenting symptoms, signs, and diagnosis related to stage and tumour site.

Pain is present in 80% to 85% of patients with locally advanced or advanced [[metastatic]] disease. The pain is usually felt in the upper abdomen as a dull ache that radiates straight through to the back. It may be intermittent and made worse by eating. Weight loss can be profound; it can be associated with [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], early [[satiety]], [[diarrhoea]], or [[steatorrhea]]. [[Jaundice]] is often accompanied by [[Itch|pruritus]] and dark urine. Painful jaundice is present in approximately one-half of patients with locally unresectable disease, while painless jaundice is present in approximately one-half of patients with a potentially resectable and curable lesion.

The initial presentation varies according to location of the cancer. Malignancies in the pancreatic body or tail usually present with pain and weight loss, while those in the head of the gland typically present with steatorrhea, weight loss, and jaundice. The recent onset of atypical diabetes mellitus, a history of recent but unexplained [[thrombophlebitis]] ([[Trousseau sign of malignancy|Trousseau sign]]), or a previous attack of [[pancreatitis]] are sometimes noted. [[Courvoisier's law|Courvoisier sign]] defines the presence of jaundice and a painlessly distended [[gallbladder]] as strongly indicative of pancreatic cancer, and may be used to distinguish pancreatic cancer from [[gallstone]]s. Tiredness, irritability and difficulty eating because of pain also exist. Pancreatic cancer is often discovered during the course of the evaluation of aforementioned symptoms.

[[Liver function test]]s can show a combination of results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised [[conjugated bilirubin]], [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|γ-glutamyl transpeptidase]] and [[alkaline phosphatase]] levels). [[CA19-9]] (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a [[tumor marker]] that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity. When a cutoff above 37 U/mL is used, this marker has a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 87% in discerning benign from malignant disease. CA 19-9 might be normal early in the course, and could be elevated because of benign causes of biliary obstruction.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Frank J.

The most common form of pancreatic cancer (ductal [[adenocarcinoma]]) is typically characterized by moderately to poorly differentiated glandular structures on microscopic examination. Pancreatic cancer has an [[immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] profile that is similar to [[hepatobiliary]] cancers (e.g. [[cholangiocarcinoma]]) and some [[stomach cancer]]s; thus, it may not always be possible to be certain that a tumour found in the pancreas arose from it.

The tumor is an [[adenocarcinoma]] derived from a primary lesion in the body of the pancreas.]]

Pancreatic carcinoma is thought to arise from progressive tissue changes. Three types of precancerous lesion are recognised: pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia&nbsp;– a microscopic lesions of the pancreas, [[intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm]]s and mucinous cystic neoplasms both of which are macroscopic lesions.<ref name=Delpu2011>{{cite journal | author = Delpu Y, Hanoun N, Lulka H, Sicard F, Selves J, Buscail L, Torrisani J, Cordelier P | year = 2011 | title = Genetic and epigenetic alterations in pancreatic carcinogenesis | url = | journal = Curr Genomics | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 15–24 }}</ref> The cellular origin of these lesions is debated.

Endocrine pancreatic tumors have been variously called islet cell tumors, pancreas endocrine tumors (PETs), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).<ref name="Yao17896148">{{Cite doi|10.1245/s10434-007-9566-6}}</ref> The annual clinically recognized [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is low, about five per one million person-years.<ref name="JHM-SGPCRC" /> However, [[autopsy]] studies incidentally identify PETs in up to 1.5%<ref name="CM13" /> most of which would remain inert and asymptomatic.<ref name="CM13" />

The majority of PNETs are usually categorized as benign<ref name="PMID12039924">"The prognosis of patients with PENs is difficult to predict, in part because the definition of malignancy in PENs has been ambiguous. By some, PENs have been defined as malignant only when lymph nodes are involved or liver metastases are documented. Other investigators have included vascular invasion or invasion of adjacent structures as evidence of malignancy. However, the concept that a PEN removed successfully without recurrence was therefore biologically benign could be challenged. In fact, strict separation of PENs into benign and malignant groups may be less clinically useful than the definition of prognostic factors."{{Cite doi|10.1200/JCO.2002.10.030 }}</ref><ref name="PMID17486055">"One of the most controversial aspects of PENs has been the prediction of prognosis."{{Cite doi|10.1038/modpathol.3800686}}</ref><ref name="PMID16831051">"The classification of these tumors remains controversial, and prognosis is difficult to predict" Wendy L.

A small subset of [[endocrine]] pancreatic tumors are incontrovertible pancreatic [[endocrine]] cancers, that make up about 1% of pancreas cancers.<ref name="JHM-SGPCRC" /><ref name="Yao17896148"/> Low- to intermediate-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the pancreas may be called islet cell tumors.  Some sources have also termed these pancreatic carcinoid,<ref name="Yao17896148" /> a practice that has sometimes been strongly condemned.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  Definitional migration has caused some complexity of PNET classification,<ref name="Yao17896148" /> which has adversely affected what is known about the epidemiology and natural history of these tumors.<ref name="Yao17896148" /> It is probable that some of these tumors have been included in [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology|

ICD-O-3]] histology classifications 8240–8245, in that they were labeled pancreatic carcinoid tumours<ref name="Yao17896148" /><ref>Modlin http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.11105/pdf</ref> but most islet cell carcinomas have been coded as ICD-O-3 system 8150–8155.<ref name="Yao17896148" />

The more aggressive endocrine pancreatic cancers are known as pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (PNEC). Similarly, there has likely been a degree of admixture of PNEC and [[small-cell carcinoma|extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Prevention==
According to the [[American Cancer Society]], there are no established guidelines for preventing pancreatic cancer, although [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]] has been reported as responsible for 20–30% of pancreatic cancers.<ref name="titleACS :: Can Cancer of the Pancreas be Prevented?">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_Can_pancreatic_cancer_be_prevented_34.asp?rnav=cri|title=Can Cancer of the Pancreas Be Prevented?|accessdate=2007-12-13|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012144329/http://cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_Can_pancreatic_cancer_be_prevented_34.asp?rnav=cri| archivedate = October 12, 2007}}</ref>

The ACS recommends keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing red meat intake, although there is no consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Coughlin SS, Calle EE, Patel AV, Thun MJ|title=Predictors of pancreatic cancer mortality among a large cohort of United States adults|journal=Cancer Causes & Control|volume=11|issue=10|pages=915–23|year=2000|month=December|pmid=11142526|doi=10.1023/A:1026580131793|issn=0957-5243}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zheng W, McLaughlin JK, Gridley G, ''et al.''|title=A cohort study of smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary factors for pancreatic cancer (United States)|journal=Cancer Causes & Control|volume=4|issue=5|pages=477–82|year=1993|month=September|pmid=8218880|doi=10.1007/BF00050867}}</ref>

A long-term study found that people who consumed in the range of 300 to 449 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily had a 43% lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those who took less than 150 IU per day;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5334534.stm|title=Health &#124; Vitamin D 'slashes cancer risk'|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-09-15|accessdate=2009-09-15}} ''The BBC quoted the lead researcher: "I would make no specific recommendation for vitamin D supplementation to prevent pancreatic cancer until we can carry out a trial to determine definitively who might benefit from such an intervention." The BBC quoted Henry Scowcroft, science information officer at the charity Cancer Research UK: "The results of this study don't mean that people should take vitamin D supplements to ward off pancreatic cancer, especially as vitamin D can be harmful in large quantities...As the authors themselves point out, this is the very first study to find any association between the disease and vitamin D intake...So this result needs to be repeated in other large studies, and scientists need to show exactly how vitamin D might prevent pancreatic cancer before we could issue any specific lifestyle advice."''</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/127/116673.htm|title=Vitamin D May Cut Pancreatic Cancer|publisher=Webmd.com|date=2006-09-12}}</ref> 150 IU is appreciably less than what was then, or is now, recommended.<ref name="IOM2010-vitD">Institute of Medicine.

A Harvard study from 2007 showed a modest inverse trend between blood circulation of [[B vitamins]], such as [[vitamin B12|B<sub>12</sub>]], [[Vitamin B6|B<sub>6</sub>]], and [[folate]] and pancreatic cancer incidence, but not when the vitamins were ingested in tablet form.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Schernhammer E, Wolpin B, Rifai N, ''et al.''|title=Plasma folate, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and homocysteine and pancreatic cancer risk in four large cohorts|journal=Cancer Research|volume=67|issue=11|pages=5553–60|year=2007|month=June|pmid=17545639|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4463}}</ref>

===Screening===
People who may have a high risk of pancreatic cancer due to a family history can be followed, but there is no consensus on what constitutes optimal monitoring. Several small studies have shown promising preliminary results for new biomarkers, but further validation on a larger scale is needed. People with pancreatic cancer themselves, or family members, may wish to participate in the activities at a research facility, or identify a pancreas tumor registry.

==Treatment==

===Exocrine pancreas cancer===

====Surgery====
Treatment of pancreatic cancer depends on the stage of the cancer.<ref name=jhupc>{{Cite web|url=http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/TreatmentSurgery.php|title=Surgical Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref> Although only localized cancer is considered suitable for surgery with curative intent at present, only ~20% of cases present with localised disease at diagnosis.<ref name=Corbo2012>Corbo V, Tortora G, Scarpa A (2012) Molecular pathology of pancreatic cancer: from bench-to-bedside translation. Curr Drug Targets</ref> Surgery can also be performed for palliation, if the malignancy is invading or compressing the [[duodenum]] or [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]. In such cases, bypass surgery might overcome the obstruction and improve quality of life but is not intended as a cure.<ref name=ACP/>

The [[Pancreaticoduodenectomy|Whipple procedure]] is the most common attempted curative surgical treatment for cancers involving the head of the pancreas. This procedure involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together (pancreato-duodenectomy), making a bypass for food from stomach to [[jejunum]] (gastro-jejunostomy) and attaching a loop of jejunum to the cystic duct to drain bile (cholecysto-jejunostomy). It can be performed only if the patient is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed in only the minority of cases.

Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a distal pancreatectomy.<ref name=jhupc/> Recently, localized cancers of the pancreas have been resected using minimally invasive (laparoscopic) approaches.<ref name= "Laparoscopic Pancreas Surgery">{{Cite web|url=http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/TreatmentLaparoscopic.php|title= Laparoscopic Pancreas Surgery|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref>

After surgery, ''adjuvant'' chemotherapy with [[gemcitabine]] has been shown in several large randomized studies to significantly increase the 5-year survival (from approximately 10 to 20%), and should be offered if the patient is fit after surgery (Oettle et al. JAMA 2007, Neoptolemos et al. NEJM 2004, Oettle et al. ASCO proc 2007).

====Radiation====

Principles of radiation therapy in pancreas adenocarcinoma are reviewed extensively in guidelines by the [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]].<ref name="NCCNpancreas">Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (access to the guideline section of the website is free, but may require registration; see sections "PANC-F" and "MS") http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/pancreatic.pdf</ref>  Radiation can be considered in several situations. One situation is the addition of [[radiation therapy]] after potentially curative surgery. Groups in the US have been more apt to use adjuvant radiation therapy than groups in Europe.<ref name="pmid15028824">{{Cite journal|author=Neoptolemos JP, Stocken DD, Friess H, ''et al.''|title=A randomized trial of chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy after resection of pancreatic cancer|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=350|issue=12|pages=1200–10|year=2004|month=March|pmid=15028824|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa032295}}</ref>

====Chemotherapy====
In patients not suitable for resection with curative intent, [[palliative]] [[chemotherapy]] may be used to improve quality of life and gain a modest survival benefit. [[Gemcitabine]] was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] in 1998, after a clinical trial reported improvements in [[quality of life]] and a 5-week improvement in median survival duration in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.  This marked the first FDA approval of a chemotherapy drug primarily for a nonsurvival [[clinical trial]] endpoint. Gemcitabine is administered intravenously on a weekly basis.

A Canadian-led Phase III randomised controlled trial, reported in 2005, involved 569 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, led the US FDA in 2005 to license [[erlotinib]] (Tarceva) in combination with [[gemcitabine]] as a palliative regimen for pancreatic cancer. This trial compared the outcome of gemcitabine/erlotinib to gemcitabine/placebo, and demonstrated improved survival rates, improved tumor response and improved progression-free survival rates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/AC/05/briefing/2005-4174B1_03_01-OSI-Tarceva.pdf#search=%22%20fda%20erlotinib%20pancreatic%22 |title=Tarceva (erlotinib) Tablets.

Other trials are now investigating the effect of the above combination in the adjuvant (post surgery) and [[neoadjuvant therapy|neoadjuvant]] (pre-surgery) settings.

Addition of [[oxaliplatin]] to Gemcitabine (Gem/Ox) was shown to confer benefit in small trials, but is not yet standard therapy.<ref name="pmid16434988">{{Cite journal|author=Demols A, Peeters M, Polus M, ''et al.''|title=Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in gemcitabine refractory advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a phase II study|journal=British Journal of Cancer|volume=94|issue=4|pages=481–85|year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16434988|pmc=2361170|doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6602966}}</ref>

===Pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumors===
{{main|Neuroendocrine tumor}}

The majority of these tumors are [[histology|histologically]] [[benign]]. Treatment of pancreatic endocrine tumors, including the less common [[malignant]] tumors, may include:

* Watchful waiting: incidentally identified small tumors, for example on a [[computed tomography]] (CT) scan performed for other purposes, may conceptually not always need intervention, but criteria for watchful waiting are unclear.

* Surgery: tumors within the pancreas only (localized tumors), or with limited metastases, may be removed. For localized tumors, the surgical procedure is much less extensive than the types of surgery used to treat pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

* Hormone therapy: if the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms by secreting functional [[hormones]], a [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] hormone [[Structural analog|analog]] medication, [[octreotide]], may lessen the symptoms, and sometimes also slows tumor growth.

* Radiation therapy: occasionally used if there is pain due to anatomic extension, such as [[metastasis]] to bone.

* [[Radiolabeled]] [[hormone]]: some  PNETs  absorb a hormone called [[norepinephrine]] and these may respond to [[nuclear medicine]] medication, radiolabeled MIBG therapy (or, experamentally, other hormones), given [[intravenous]]ly.

* [[Radiofrequency ablation]] (RFA), [[cryoablation]], [[hepatic artery embolization]]

* Chemotherapy and targeted medication for PNETs receive Wikipedia discussion in the [[Neuroendocrine tumor#Pancreatic endocrine tumors|relevant section]] of that article.

Exocrine pancreatic cancer ([[adenocarcinoma]] and less common variants) typically has a poor [[prognosis]], partly because the cancer usually causes no symptoms early on, leading to locally advanced or [[metastatic]] disease at time of diagnosis.

Pancreatic cancer may occasionally result in [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. Insulin production is hampered, and it has been suggested the cancer can also prompt the onset of diabetes and vice versa.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wang F, Herrington M, Larsson J, Permert J|title=The relationship between diabetes and pancreatic cancer |journal=Molecular Cancer|volume=2|issue=|pages=4|year=2003|month=January|pmid=12556242|pmc=149418|doi=10.1186/1476-4598-2-4}}</ref> It can be associated with pain, fatigue, weight loss, [[jaundice]], and weakness. Additional symptoms are discussed above.

For pancreatic cancer:

* For all stages combined, the 1-year relative survival rate is 25%, and the [[5-year survival]] is estimated as less than 5% <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/research/cancer/en|title=WHO &#124; Cancer|publisher=Who.int|date=|accessdate=2009-09-15}}</ref>  to 6%.<ref name="ACS-CFF-2010" />
* For local disease, the 5-year survival is approximately 20%.<ref name="ACS-CFF-2010" /><ref name="NCI-GIAPC" />
* For locally advanced and for [[metastatic]] disease, which collectively represent over 80%<ref name="NCI-GIAPC" /> to 85-90%<ref name="pmid17625148" /> of individuals, the [[median]] survival is about 10 and 6 months, respectively.<ref name="CM13" />  Without active treatment, [[metastatic]] pancreatic cancer has a median survival of 3–5 months;<ref name="pmid17625148">{{Cite journal|author=Ghaneh P, Costello E, Neoptolemos JP|title=Biology and management of pancreatic cancer|journal=Gut|volume=56|issue=8|pages=1134–52|year=2007|month=August|pmid=17625148|pmc=1955499|doi=10.1136/gut.2006.103333}}</ref> complete remission is rare.<ref name="pmid17625148" />

Outcomes with pancreatic [[endocrine]] tumors, many of which are [[benign]] and completely without clinical symptoms, are much better, as are outcomes with symptomatic benign tumors; even with actual pancreatic endocrine cancers, outcomes are rather better, but variable.<ref name="Yao17896148" /><ref name="Fesinmeyer16030115">{{Cite doi|10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0120}}</ref>
