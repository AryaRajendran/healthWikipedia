==History==
The first Smokeout was held  in [[San Francisco]]'s Union Square on November 16, 1977.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2013}}

The event evolved from a series of smaller-scale initiatives.  In 1970, in [[Randolph, Massachusetts]], Arthur P. Mullaney suggested people give up [[cigarette]]s for a day and donate the money to a local high school. In 1974, a "Don't Smoke Day" (or "D-Day") was promoted by Lynn R. Smith of the ''Monticello Times'' in [[Monticello, Minnesota]].<ref name="GAS history" /> On November 18, 1976, the [[California]] Division of the American Cancer Society successfully prompted nearly one million smokers to quit for the day. That California event marked the first Smokeout.
