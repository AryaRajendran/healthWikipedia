'''Hematological malignancies ''' (British spelling '''"Haematological"''' malignancies) are the types of [[cancer]] that affect [[blood]], [[bone marrow]], and [[lymph node]]s. As the three are intimately connected through the [[immune system]], a disease affecting one of the three will often affect the others as well: although [[lymphoma]] is a disease of the [[lymph node]]s, it often spreads to the [[bone marrow]], affecting the [[blood]] and occasionally producing a [[paraprotein]].

While uncommon in solid tumors,  [[chromosomal translocation]]s are a common cause of these diseases. This commonly leads to a different approach in diagnosis and treatment of hematological malignancies.

Hematological malignancies are malignant [[neoplasms]] ("cancer"), and they are generally treated by specialists in [[hematology]] and/or [[oncology]].  In some centers "Hematology/oncology" is a single subspecialty of [[internal medicine]] while in others they are considered separate divisions (there are also surgical and radiation oncologists).  Not all [[hematological disorders]] are malignant ("cancerous"); these other blood conditions may also be managed by a hematologist.

Hematological malignancies may derive from either of the two major [[Haematopoiesis|blood cell lineages]]:  [[myeloid]] and [[lymphoid]] cell lines.  The myeloid cell line normally produces [[granulocytes]], [[erythrocytes]], [[thrombocytes]], [[macrophages]] and [[mast cells]]; the lymphoid cell line produces [[B cells|B]], [[T cells|T]], [[NK cells|NK]] and [[plasma cells]]. Lymphomas, lymphocytic leukemias, and myeloma are from the lymphoid line, while acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative diseases are myeloid in origin.

==Classification and incidence==
Taken together, hematological malignancies account for 9.5% of new cancer diagnoses in the United States.<ref>{{cite web

Historically, hematological malignancies have been most commonly divided by whether the malignancy is mainly located in the blood ([[leukemia]]) or in [[lymph node]]s ([[lymphoma]]s).

However, the influential WHO Classification (published in 2001) emphasized a greater emphasis on cell lineage.

==Diagnosis==
For the analysis of a suspected ''hematological malignancy'', a [[complete blood count]] and [[blood film]] are essential, as malignant cells can show in characteristic ways on [[light microscopy]]. When there is [[lymphadenopathy]], a [[biopsy]] from a [[lymph node]] is generally undertaken [[surgery|surgically]]. In general, a [[bone marrow biopsy]] is part of the "work up" for the analysis of these diseases. All specimens are examined microscopically to determine the nature of the malignancy. A number of these diseases can now be classified by [[cytogenetics]] (AML, CML) or [[immunophenotyping]] (lymphoma, myeloma, CLL) of the malignant cells.

==Treatment==
Treatment can occasionally consist of "watchful waiting" (e.g. in [[Chronic lymphocytic leukemia|CLL]]) or symptomatic treatment (e.g. [[blood transfusion]]s in [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|MDS]]). The more aggressive forms of disease require treatment with [[chemotherapy]], [[radiotherapy]], [[immunotherapy]] and - in some cases - a [[bone marrow transplant]]. The use of [[rituximab]] has been established for the treatment of B-cell–derived hematologic malignancies, including follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

==Follow-up==
If treatment has been successful ("complete" or "partial remission"), a patient is generally followed up at regular intervals to detect recurrence and monitor for "secondary malignancy" (an uncommon side-effect of some [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] regimens - the appearance of another form of [[cancer]]). In the follow-up, which should be done at pre-determined regular intervals, general [[Medical history|anamnesis]] is combined with [[complete blood count]] and determination of [[lactate dehydrogenase]] or [[thymidine kinase]] in serum.
