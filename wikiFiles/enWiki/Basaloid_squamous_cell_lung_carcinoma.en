'''Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma''' (Bas-SqCC) is an uncommon [[histology|histological]] variant of [[lung cancer]] composed of cells exhibiting [[Cytopathology|cytological]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] architectural features of both [[squamous-cell lung carcinoma|squamous cell lung carcinoma]] and [[basal cell carcinoma|basaloid carcinoma]].<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

==Classification==
Lung cancer is a large and exceptionally [[heterogeneous]] family of malignancies.<ref name="pmid2987102">{{cite journal |author=Roggli VL, Vollmer RT, Greenberg SD, McGavran MH, Spjut HJ, Yesner R |title=Lung cancer heterogeneity: a blinded and randomized study of 100 consecutive cases |journal=Hum.

Basaloid forms of lung [[carcinoma]] were first described in the [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] medical literature by Dr. Elisabeth Brambilla and her colleagues in 1992.<ref name="pmid1381335">{{cite journal |author=Brambilla E, Moro D, Veale D, ''et al.'' |title=Basal cell (basaloid) carcinoma of the lung: a new morphologic and phenotypic entity with separate prognostic significance |journal=Hum.

In the third revision of the [[World Health Organization]] lung tumor typing and classification scheme, published in 1999, basaloid variants of both [[squamous-cell lung carcinoma|squamous cell lung carcinoma]] (SqCC) and [[large-cell lung carcinoma|large cell lung carcinoma]] (LCLC) were recognized as distinct entities.<ref name="pmid11829087"/> In the fourth revision (2004) of the WHO system (currently the world standard) Bas-SqCC is classified as one of four recognized variants of [[squamous-cell lung carcinoma|squamous cell lung carcinoma]].<ref name='who2004' \ /> As a variant of SqCC, it is considered a [[Non-small-cell lung cancer|non-small cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC).

==Epidemiology==
The true incidence and prevalence of basaloid squamous cell lung carcinoma remains unknown, but this form of lung cancer is considered relatively uncommon.<ref name="pmid21269455">{{cite journal |author=Wang LC, Wang L, Kwauk S, ''et al.'' |title=Analysis on the clinical features of 22 basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the lung |journal=J Cardiothorac Surg |volume=6 |issue= |pages=10 |year=2011 |pmid=21269455 |pmc=3037842 |doi=10.1186/1749-8090-6-10 |url=}}</ref> In one of the largest studies of this particular variant, Moro-Sibilot and co-workers found a 6.3% prevalence of Bas-SqCC among 1,418 consecutive NSCLC patients at their institution.<ref name="pmid18094005">{{cite journal |author=Moro-Sibilot D, Lantuejoul S, Diab S, ''et al.'' |title=Lung carcinomas with a basaloid pattern: a study of 90 cases focusing on their poor prognosis |journal=Eur. Respir. J. |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=854–9 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18094005 |doi=10.1183/09031936.00058507 |url=}}</ref>

Basaloid carcinomas of the lung - like nearly all recognized variants of lung cancer - are highly associated with [[tobacco smoking]].<ref name="pmid18094005"/> Basaloid architecture in [[pulmonary]] carcinomas has been shown to be particularly prevalent in smokers with heavy exposure,<ref name="pmid18094005"/> and squamous cell carcinoma has the strongest association with tobacco exposure than any other major cell type of NSCLC.<ref name="pmid6087006">{{cite journal |author=Lubin JH, Blot WJ |title=Assessment of lung cancer risk factors by histologic category |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=383–9 |year=1984 |month=August |pmid=6087006 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

As compared to other forms of lung cancer, Bas-SqCC often occurs in those who are somewhat older than average.<ref name="pmid18094005"/> As SqCC is also associated with presentation at somewhat older ages, the true relevance/effect size of the basaloid-age interaction remains unknown.

Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma usually begins [[hilum of lung|centrally]], in the larger proximal [[bronchus|bronchi]].<ref name="pmid21269455"/> Basaloid carcinoma primary in the [[lung]] may also occur in a multicentric form.<ref name="pmid18480394">{{cite journal |author=Bhagavathi S, Chang CH |title=Multicentric basaloid carcinoma of lung clinically mimicking metastatic carcinoma: a case report |journal=Int J Surg Pathol |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=68–71 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=18480394 |doi=10.1177/1066896908316900 |url=}}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
Both basaloid and squamous cell carcinomas have been shown to arise from pre-malignant [[lesions]] of [[dysplasia]] in the airways of the lung.<ref name="pmid19187179">{{cite journal |author=Lantuéjoul S, Salameire D, Salon C, Brambilla E |title=Pulmonary preneoplasia--sequential molecular carcinogenetic events |journal=Histopathology |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19187179 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2559.2008.03182.x |url=}}</ref> After continued exposure to tobacco smoke or other [[carcinogenic]] stimuli, cells in areas of severe dysplasia can suffer additional [[genome|genetic]] damage that results in progression to a basaloid or squamous cell [[carcinoma in situ|carcinoma ''in situ'']] (CIS). CIS is a fully [[malignant]] lesion, but by definition, the cancer cells have not yet invaded beyond the tissue delimiting their original site of genesis.

==Diagnosis==
Like other forms of [[lung cancer]], Bas-SqCC is ultimately diagnosed after a [[pathologist]] examines a [[tumor]] sample containing viable [[malignant]] cells and tissue under a light [[microscope]] and identifies certain particular characteristics.

In the case of Bas-SqCC, it is essential that both evidence of [[squamous]] differentiation (i.e., intercellular bridges, production of [[keratin]], [[tonofilament]] bundles) and basaloid architecture (i.e. prominent peripheral palisading of cell nuclei, organoid/lobular structures) are identified to make a correct diagosis.<ref name="pmid11829087"/><ref name="pmid18094005"/>

Immunohistochemical markers that have been suggested to be useful in making an accurate diagnosis of Bas-SqCC include positivity for p63 and high molecular weight [[keratin]] (i.e. 34betaE12), and lack of expression of [[thyroid transcription factor-1]] (TTF-1).<ref name="pmid11567220">{{cite journal |author=Sturm N, Lantuéjoul S, Laverrière MH, ''et al.'' |title=Thyroid transcription factor 1 and cytokeratins 1, 5, 10, 14 (34betaE12) expression in basaloid and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung |journal=Hum. Pathol. |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=918–25 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11567220 |doi=10.1053/hupa.2001.27110 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid21319315">{{cite journal |author=Maleki Z |title=Diagnostic issues with cytopathologic interpretation of lung neoplasms displaying high-grade basaloid or neuroendocrine morphology |journal=Diagn.

Among other pulmonary malignancies, the main differential diagnoses in suspected cases of Bas-SqCC include the high-grade [[neuroendocrine]] carcinomas, such as [[small cell carcinoma]] and [[large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung|large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma]]. The issue of differential diagnosis is particularly acute when the [[pathologist]] must use a small [[biopsy]] specimen or [[Cytopathology|cytology]].<ref name="pmid21319315"/><ref name="pmid21254456"/> In addition, the basaloid variant of SqCC can be difficult to distinguish from other poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas.<ref name="pmid12760288">{{cite journal |author=Wu M, Wang B, Gil J, ''et al.'' |title=p63 and TTF-1 immunostaining.

==Prognosis==
Like nearly all other forms of NSCLC, the prognosis of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is quite poor.<ref name="pmid10492274">{{cite journal |author=Merrill RM, Henson DE, Barnes M |title=Conditional survival among patients with carcinoma of the lung |journal=Chest |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=697–703 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10492274 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
For last several decades of the 20th century, all histological variants of NSCLC were generally treated identically. In the last decade, it has become apparent that different variants of malignant tumors generally exhibit diverse genetic, biological, and clinical properties, including response to treatment.<ref name="RossiMarchioni">{{cite journal |author=Rossi G, Marchioni A, Sartori G, Longo L, Piccinini S, Cavazza A |title=Histotype in non-small cell lung cancer therapy and staging: The emerging role of an old and underrated factor |journal=Curr Resp Med Rev |volume=3 |pages=69–77 |year=2007  |doi=10.2174/157339807779941820 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/crmr/2007/00000003/00000001/art00011}}</ref><ref name="pmid19672420">{{cite journal |author=Vincent MD |title=Optimizing the management of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a personal view |journal=Curr Oncol |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=9–21 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19672420 |pmc=2722061 |doi=10.3747/co.v16i4.465}}</ref>

As patients with uncommon lung tumor variants, including tumors composed of mixtures of histological subtypes, tend to be excluded from [[clinical trials]],<ref name='trials'>http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search</ref> the most efficacious treatment regimen(s) for basaloid squamous cell carcinoma remain unknown. In general, these variants appear to be treated according to standard protocols in place for squamous cell carcinoma.<ref name="pmid14667594"/>
