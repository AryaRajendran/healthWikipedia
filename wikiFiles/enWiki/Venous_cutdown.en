'''Venous cutdown''' is an emergency procedure in which the vein is exposed surgically and then a [[cannula]] is inserted into the vein under direct vision. It is used to get vascular access in [[Physical trauma|trauma]] and [[hypovolemic shock]] patients when peripheral cannulation is difficult or impossible. The [[saphenous vein]] is most commonly used. This procedure has fallen out of favor with the development of safer techniques for central venous catheterization such as the [[Seldinger technique]] and the modified Seldinger technique,<ref>Seldinger SI: Catheter replacement of the needle in percutaneous arteriography.

==Procedure==
The skin is cleaned, draped, and [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] if time allows. The greater saphenous vein is identified on the surface, a full-thickness transverse skin incision is made, and 2&nbsp;cm of the vein is freed from the surrounding structures. The vessel is tied closed distally, the proximal portion is transected (venotomy) and gently dilated, and a cannula is introduced through the venotomy and secured in place with a more proximal ligature around the vein and cannula. An [[intravenous]] line is connected to the cannula to complete the procedure.

==Complications==
Complications of venous cutdown include [[cellulitis]], [[hematoma]], [[phlebitis]], perforation of the posterior wall of the vein, [[venous thrombosis]] and nerve and arterial transection. This procedure can result in damage to the [[saphenous nerve]] due to its intimate path with the great saphenous vein, resulting in loss of cutaneous sensation in the medial leg. Over the years the venous cutdown procedure has become outdated by the introduction and recent prehospital developments of [[intraosseous infusion]] in trauma/hypovolemic shock patients.
