'''Acrocyanosis''' is persistent blue or [[cyanosis|cyanotic]] discoloration of the extremities, most commonly occurring in the hands, although it also occurs in the feet and distal parts of face.

New York: Wiley, John & Sons ISBN 0-911910-18-2</ref> Although described over 100 years ago and not uncommon in practice, the nature of this phenomenon is still uncertain. The very term "acrocyanosis" is often applied inappropriately in cases when blue discoloration of the hands, feet, or parts of the face is noted.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/>
The principal (primary) form of acrocyanosis is that of a [[benign]] cosmetic condition,<ref name="Cecil 1"/> sometimes caused by a relatively benign [[neurohormone|neurohormonal]] disorder.<ref name="internal medicine"/> Regardless of its cause, the benign form typically does not require medical treatment. A [[medical emergency]] would ensue if the extremities experience prolonged periods of exposure to the cold, particularly in children and patients with poor general health.<ref name="internal medicine"/> However, [[frostbite]] differs from acrocyanosis because pain (via thermal [[nociceptor]]s) often accompanies the former condition, while the latter is very rarely associated with pain. There is also a number of other conditions that affect hands, feet, and parts of the face with associated skin color changes that need to be differentiated from acrocyanosis: Raynaud’s phenomenon, pernio, acrorygosis, erythromelalgia, blue finger syndrome. The diagnosis may be challenging in some cases, especially when these syndromes co-exist.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/>

Acrocyanosis may be a sign of a more serious medical problem, such as connective tissue diseases and diseases associated with [[central cyanosis]]. Other causative conditions include infections, toxicities, antiphospholipid syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, neoplasms. In these cases, the observed cutaneous changes are known as "secondary acrocyanosis". They may have a less symmetric distribution and may be associated with pain and tissue loss.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/><ref name="Cecil 1"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Acrocyanosis is characterized by peripheral cyanosis: persistent cyanosis of the hands or of the hands, feet, or face.<ref name="Merck"/> The extremities often are cold and clammy and may exhibit some [[edema|swelling]] (especially in the warmer weather).<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/><ref name="Cecil 1"/> The palms and soles exhibit a wide range of sweating from moderately moist to profuse, but all peripheral [[pulse]]s should have normal rate, rhythm, and quality.<ref name="internal medicine"/><ref name="Merck"/> Exposure to cold temperatures worsens the cyanosis, while it often improves on warming.<ref name="Cecil 1"/> Aside from the color changes, patients normally are asymptomatic and therefore there is usually no associated pain. The most common sign, discoloration, usually is what prompts patients to seek medical care.<ref name="internal medicine"/><ref name="Merck"/>

==Pathophysiology==
The precise [[etiology]] of acrocyanosis is unknown. The current line of thinking goes that [[vasospasm]]s in the cutaneous arteries and arterioles produce cyanotic discoloration, while compensatory dilatation in the postcapillary [[venule]]s causes sweating. Arteriovenous subpapillary plexus shunting also occurs.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/><ref name="Cecil 1"/><ref name="Merck"/>  Persistent vasoconstriction at the [[precapillary sphincter]] creates a local hypoxic environment, thus releasing [[adenosine]] into the capillary bed.<ref name="Medical Physiology">Guyton, A.C. & Hall, J.E. (2006) ''Textbook of Medical Physiology'' (11th ed.) Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunder ISBN 0-7216-0240-1</ref> Vasospasms force adenosine to enter the capillary bed, where it vasodilates the postcapillary venules.<ref name="Medical Physiology"/> Such differences in vessel tone create a [[countercurrent exchange]] system that attempts to retain heat. Profuse sweating would then be caused by an overwhelmed countercurrent exchange system. In addition to adenosine, other hormones may contribute to acrocyanosis such as increase blood levels of serotonin.<ref name="Carpenter">{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = PK | last2 = Morris | first2 = D | title = Association of acrocyanosis with Asperger's syndrome | journal = Journal of mental deficiency research | volume = 34 | pages = 87–90 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2325122 | issue=1}}</ref> This would seem to support case studies reporting acrocyanosis as an unusual side effect for pediatric patients taking [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, as these medications can inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and thus increase their blood concentrations.<ref name="Karakara">{{cite journal | author=Karakara, I., Aydoğan, M., Coşkun, A., & Gökalp, A.S. | title=Acrocyanosis as a side effect of tricyclic antidepressants: A case report | journal=The Turkish Journal of Pediatrics | volume=45 | pages=155–57 | year=2003}}</ref> Acrocyanosis has been reported in association with many other medications and substances.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/>

==Diagnosis==
Acrocyanosis is diagnosed clinically, based on a [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]]; laboratory studies or imaging studies are not necessary. The normal peripheral pulses rule out [[peripheral arterial occlusive disease]], where [[artery|arterial]] narrowing limits blood flow to the extremities. [[Pulse oximetry]] will show a normal [[oxygen saturation]]. Unlike the closely related [[Raynaud's phenomenon]], cyanosis is continually persistent. In addition, there is usually no associated trophic skin changes, localized pain, or [[Skin ulcer|ulcerations]].<ref name="Cecil 1"/><ref name="Merck"/> [[Capillaroscopy]] and other laboratory methods may be helpful but only complement clinical diagnosis in unclear cases, especially when they connective tissue disorders may be present.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/>

==Treatment==
There is no standard medical or surgical treatment for acrocyanosis, and treatment, other than reassurance and avoidance of cold, is usually unnecessary. The patient is reassured that no serious illness is present. A [[sympathectomy]] would alleviate the cyanosis by disrupting the fibers of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] to the area.<ref name="internal medicine"/> However, such an extreme procedure would rarely be appropriate. Treatment with vasoactive drugs is not recommended but traditionally is mentioned as optional. However, there is little, if any, empirical evidence that vasoactive drugs ([[alpha blocker|α-adrenergic blocking agents]] or [[calcium channel blockers]]) are effective.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/><ref name="Cecil 1"/>

==Prognosis==
While there is no cure for acrocyanosis, patients otherwise have excellent prognosis.<ref name="Cecil 1"/> Unless acrocyanosis results from another condition (e.g. malignancy, antiphospholipid syndrome), there is no associated increased risk of disease or death, and there are no known complications. Aside from the discoloration, there are no other symptoms: no pain, and no loss of function. Patients can expect to lead normal lives. In secondary acrocyanosis treatment of the primary condition defines outcomes.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/>

==Epidemiology==
Although there is no definitive reporting on its [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]],  acrocyanosis shows [[prevalence]] in children and young adults than in patients thirty years of age or older.<ref name="internal medicine"/> [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] data suggests that cold climate, outdoor occupation, and low [[body mass index]] are significant [[risk]] factors for developing acrocyanosis.<ref name="Carpentier">{{cite journal | author=Carpentier, P.H. | title=Definition and Epidemiology of Vascular Acrosyndromes | journal=Rev Prat | volume=48 | issue=15 | pages=1641–6 | year=1998 | pmid=9814064}}</ref> As expected, acrocyanosis would be more prevalent in women than in men due to differences in BMI.<ref name="Merck"/> However, the [[incidence rate]] of acrocyanosis often decreases with increasing age, regardless of regional climate. It completely resolves in many women after menopause implying significant hormonal influences.<ref name="Acrocyanosis"/><ref name="Carpentier"/>

==In the newborn==
Acrocyanosis is common initially after delivery in the [[premature birth|preterm]] and [[full term]] [[newborn]]<ref name="Pediatrics">Engle, W.A. & Boyle, D.W. (2005).  Delivery room management and transitional care. In L.M. Osborn, T.G. DeWitt, L.R. First, & J.A. Zenel (Eds.), ''Pediatrics'' (pp. 1250-61). Philadelphia: Elsevier Mosby ISBN 0-323-01199-3</ref> Intervention normally is not required, although hospitals opt to provide supplemental oxygen for precautionary measures.
