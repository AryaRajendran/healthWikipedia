'''Space medicine''' is the practice of [[medicine]] on [[astronauts]] in [[outer space]] whereas [[astronautical hygiene]] is the application of science and technology to the prevention or control of exposure to the hazards that may cause astronaut ill health.  Both these sciences work together to ensure that astronauts work in a safe environment. The main objective is to discover how well and for how long people can survive the extreme conditions in space, and how fast they can adapt to the Earth's environment after returning from their voyage.  Medical consequences such as possible [[blindness]] and [[bone loss]] have been associated with [[human spaceflight]].<ref name="Wired-20120723">{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Adam |title=Blindness, Bone Loss, and Space Farts: Astronaut Medical Oddities |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/07/medicine-psychology-space/ |date=July 23, 2012 |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=July 23, 2012 }}</ref>

==History==
[[Hubertus Strughold]] (1898–1987), a former [[Nazi]] physician and physiologist, was brought to the United States after [[World War II]] as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4443934.stm |title=Project Paperclip: Dark side of the Moon |date=21 November 2005 |author=Andrew Walker |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2012-04-25 }}</ref> He first coined the term "space medicine" in 1948 and was the first and only Professor of Space Medicine at the [[School of Aviation Medicine]] (SAM) at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], [[Texas]]. In 1949 Strughold was made director of the [[Department of Space Medicine]] at the SAM (which is now the [[U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine]] [USAFSAM] at [[Brooks Air Force Base]], Texas). He played an important role in developing the [[pressure suit]] worn by early American astronauts. He was a co-founder of the Space Medicine Branch of the [[Aerospace Medical Association]] in 1950. The aeromedical library at Brooks AFB was named after him in 1977, but later renamed because documents from the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] linked Strughold to medical experiments in which inmates of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] were tortured and killed.<ref>{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | authorlink=Associated Press | date=2006-05-19 | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12869190/ | title=Former Nazi removed from Space Hall of Fame | publisher=MSNBC | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

==Who benefits from space medicine research?==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
Astronauts are not the only ones who benefit from space medicine research. Several medical products have been developed that are [[space spinoffs]], that is practical applications for the field of medicine arising out of the space program. Because of joint research efforts between NASA, the National Institutes on Aging (a part of the National Institutes of Health), and other aging-related organizations, space exploration has benefited a particular segment of society, seniors. Evidence of aging related medical research conducted in space was most publicly noticeable during STS-95 (See below).

===Medical space spinoffs (pre-Mercury through Apollo)===
* [[Radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer: In conjunction with the [[Cleveland Clinic]], the cyclotron at [[Glenn Research Center]] in Cleveland, Ohio was used in the first clinical trials for the treatment and evaluation of [[neutron therapy]] for cancer patients.
* Foldable [[Walker (mobility)|walker]]s: Made from a lightweight metal material developed by NASA for aircraft and spacecraft, foldable walkers are portable and easy to manage.
* Personal alert systems: These are emergency alert devices that can be worn by individuals who may require emergency medical or safety assistance. When a button is pushed, the device sends a signal to a remote location for help. To send the signal, the device relies on telemetry technology developed at NASA.
* [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans: These devices are used by hospitals to see inside the [[human body]]. Their development would not have been possible without the technology provided by NASA after it found a way to take better pictures of the Earth’s moon.
* Muscle stimulator device: This device is used for ½ hour per day to prevent muscle atrophy in paralyzed individuals. It provides electrical stimulation to muscles which is equal to jogging three miles per week. Christopher Reeve used these in his therapy.
* Orthopedic evaluation tools: Equipment to evaluate posture, gait and balance disturbances was developed at NASA, along with a radiation-free way to measure bone flexibility using vibration.
* [[Diabetes|Diabetic]] foot mapping: This technique was developed at NASA’s center in Cleveland, Ohio to help monitor the effects of diabetes in feet.
* Foam cushioning: Special foam used for cushioning astronauts during liftoff is used in pillows and mattresses at many nursing homes and hospitals to help prevent ulcers, relieve pressure, and provide a better night’s sleep.
* Kidney dialysis machines: These machines rely on technology developed by NASA in order to process and remove toxic waste from used dialysis fluid.
* Talking [[wheelchair]]s: Paralyzed individuals who have difficulty speaking may use a talking feature on their wheelchairs which was developed by NASA to create synthesized speech for aircraft.
* Collapsible, lightweight wheelchairs: These wheelchairs are designed for portability and can be folded and put into trunks of cars. They rely on synthetic materials that NASA developed for its air and space craft
* Surgically implantable heart [[pacemaker]]: These devices depend on technologies developed by NASA for use with satellites. They communicate information about the activity of the pacemaker, such as how much time remains before the batteries need to be replaced.
* Implantable heart [[defibrillator]]: This tool continuously monitors heart activity and can deliver an electric shock to restore heartbeat regularity.
* EMS communications: Technology used to communicate telemetry between Earth and space was developed by NASA to monitor the health of astronauts in space from the ground. Ambulances use this same technology to send information—like [[EKG]] readings—from patients in transport to hospitals. This allows faster and better treatment.
* [[Weightlessness]] therapy: The weightlessness of space can allow some individuals with limited mobility on Earth—even those normally confined to wheelchairs—the freedom to move about with ease. Physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] took advantage of weightlessness in NASA's [[Vomit Comet]] aircraft in 2007. This idea also led to the development of the [[Anti-Gravity Treadmill]] from NASA technology.

===Medical investigations in space during the Space Shuttle era===
[[John Glenn]], the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth, returned with much fanfare to space once again on [[STS-95]] at 77 years of age to confront the physiological challenges preventing long-term space travel for astronauts—loss of bone density, loss of muscle mass, balance disorders, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular changes, and immune system depression—all of which are problems confronting aging people as well as astronauts. Once again Glenn stepped forward to play a historic role in the future of space exploration, but this time he would provide new medical research in the field of gerontology as well.

==What are the effects of space on the body?==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
{{main|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}

===Decompression sickness===

====Decompression illness in spaceflight====
In space, astronauts use a [[space suit]], essentially a self-contained individual spacecraft, to do spacewalks, or [[extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities]] (EVAs). Spacesuits are generally inflated with 100% [[oxygen]] at a total pressure that is less than a third of normal [[atmospheric pressure]].  Eliminating inert atmospheric components such as [[nitrogen]] allows the astronaut to breathe comfortably, but also have the mobility to use their hands, arms, and legs to complete required work, which would be more difficult in a higher pressure suit.

After the astronaut dons the spacesuit, air is replaced by 100% oxygen in a process called a "nitrogen purge". In order to reduce the risk of [[decompression sickness]], the astronaut must spend several hours "pre-breathing" at an intermediate nitrogen [[partial pressure]], in order to let their body tissues [[outgassing|outgas]] nitrogen slowly enough that bubbles are not formed. When the astronaut returns to the "shirt sleeve" environment of the spacecraft after an EVA, pressure is restored to whatever the operating pressure of that spacecraft may be, generally normal atmospheric pressure. [[Decompression illness]] in spaceflight consists of decompression sickness (DCS) and other injuries due to uncompensated changes in pressure, or [[barotrauma]].

====Decompression sickness====
[[Decompression sickness]] is the injury to the tissues of the body resulting from the presence of nitrogen bubbles in the tissues and blood. This occurs due to a rapid reduction in ambient pressure causing the dissolved nitrogen to come out of solution as gas bubbles. In space the risk of DCS is significantly reduced by using a technique to wash out the nitrogen in the body’s tissues. This is achieved by breathing 100% oxygen for a specified period of time before donning the spacesuit, and is continued after a nitrogen purge. DCS may result from inadequate or interrupted pre-oxygenation time, or other factors including the astronaut’s level of hydration, physical conditioning, prior injuries and age. Other risks of DCS include inadequate nitrogen purge in the EMU, a strenuous or excessively prolonged EVA, or a loss of suit pressure. Non-EVA crewmembers may also be at risk for DCS if there is a loss of spacecraft cabin pressure.

Symptoms of DCS in space may include chest pain, shortness of breath, cough or pain with a deep breath, unusual fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness, headache, unexplained musculoskeletal pain, tingling or numbness, extremities weakness, or visual abnormalities.

Primary treatment principles consist of in-suit repressurization to re-dissolve nitrogen bubbles, 100% oxygen to re-oxygenate tissues, and hydration to improve the circulation to injured tissues.

To date there have been no reported cases of DCS in the NASA space program.

====Barotrauma====
Barotrauma is the injury to the tissues of air filled spaces in the body as a result of differences in pressure between the body spaces and the ambient atmospheric pressure. Air filled spaces include the middle ears, paranasal sinuses, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. One would be predisposed by a pre-existing upper respiratory infection, nasal allergies, recurrent changing pressures, dehydration, or a poor equalizing technique.

Positive pressure in the air filled spaces results from reduced barometric pressure during the depressurization phase of an EVA. It can cause abdominal distension, ear or sinus pain, decreased hearing, and dental or jaw pain. Abdominal distension can be treated with extending the abdomen, gentle massage and encourage passing flatus. Ear and sinus pressure can be relieved with passive release of positive pressure. Pretreatment for susceptible individuals can include oral and nasal decongestants, or oral and nasal steroids.

Negative pressure in air fill spaces results from increased barometric pressure during repressurization after an EVA or following a planned restoration of a reduced cabin pressure. Common symptoms include ear or sinus pain, decreased hearing, and tooth or jaw pain. 

Treatment may include active positive pressure equalization of ears and sinuses, oral and nasal decongestants, or oral and nasal steroids, and appropriate pain medication if needed.

====Ultrasound and space====

===Medicine in space===
{{further|Treating An Ill or Injured Crew Member In Space}}
The  [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] Study is funded by the [[National Space and Biomedical Research Institute]] and involves the use of ultrasound among Astronauts including former ISS Commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]] who are guided by remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. This study has a widespread impact and has been extended to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as medical students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations. Findings from this study were submitted for publication to the journal [[Radiology]] aboard the International Space Station; the first article submitted in space.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |title=Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sishir Rao, BA, Lodewijk van Holsbeeck, BA, Joseph L.

===Decreased immune system functioning===
Astronauts in space have weakened immune systems, which means that in addition to increased vulnerability to new exposures, viruses already present in the body—which would normally be suppressed—become active. In space, [[T-cells]] (a part of white blood cells) do not reproduce properly. T-cells that do exist are less able to 
fight off infection. NASA research is measuring the change in the immune systems of its astronauts as well as performing experiments with T-cells in space.

===Effects of fatigue===
{{further|Performance Errors due to Fatigue and Sleep Loss}}

===Human performance===

===Loss of balance===
Leaving and returning to Earth’s gravity causes “space sickness,” dizziness, and loss of balance in astronauts. By studying how changes can affect balance in the human body—involving the senses, the brain, the inner ear, and blood pressure—NASA hopes to develop treatments that can be used on Earth and in space to correct balance disorders. Until then, NASA’s astronauts must rely on a medication called [[Midodrine]] (an “anti-dizzy” pill that temporarily increases blood pressure) to help carry out the tasks they need to do to return home safely.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Loss of bone density===
[[Bone Loss|Bone loss]] is associated with [[human spaceflight]].<ref name="Wired-20120723" />  After a 3-4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research in the following areas holds the potential to aid the process of growing new bone:
* Diet and Exercise changes may reduce osteoporosis.
* Vibration Therapy  may stimulate bone growth.
* Medication could trigger the body to produce more of the protein responsible for bone growth and formation.

===Loss of muscle mass===
In space, muscles in the legs, back, spine, and heart weaken and waste away because they no longer are needed to overcome gravity, just as people lose muscle when they age due to reduced physical activity.<ref name="Wired-20120723"/> Astronauts rely on research in the following areas to build muscle and maintain body mass:
* Exercise may build muscle if at least two hours a day is spent doing resistance training routines.
* Hormone supplements (hGH) may be a way to tap into the body’s natural growth signals.
* Medication may trigger the body into producing muscle growth proteins.

===Human-machine interface===

===Orthostatic intolerance===
In space, astronauts lose fluid volume—including up to 22% of their blood volume. Because it has
less blood to pump, the heart will [[atrophy]]. A weakened heart results in low blood pressure
and can produce a problem with “orthostatic tolerance,” or the body’s ability to send enough 
oxygen to the brain without fainting or becoming dizzy. "Under the effects of the earth's [[gravity]], blood and other body fluids are pulled towards the lower body. When gravity is taken away or reduced during space exploration, the blood tends to collect in the upper body instead, resulting in facial [[edema]] and other unwelcome side effects. Upon return to earth, the blood begins to pool in the lower extremities again, resulting in [[orthostatic hypotension]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/25mar_dizzy.htm |title=When Space Makes You Dizzy |year=2002 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-04-25 }}</ref>

===Safety/habitability===

===Sleep disorders===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}

{{further|Performance Errors due to Fatigue and Sleep Loss}}
Fifty percent of space shuttle astronauts take sleeping pills and still get two hours or less of sleep. NASA is researching two areas which may provide the keys to a better night’s sleep, as
improved sleep decreases fatigue and increases daytime productivity.  A variety of methods for combating this phenomenon are constantly under discussion.  A partial list of remedies would include:

* Go to sleep at the same time each night. With practice, you will (almost) always be tired and ready for sleep.
*  [[Melatonin]], once thought to be an anti-aging wonder drug (this was due to the well-documented observation that as people age they gradually produce less and less of the hormone naturally). The amount of melatonin the body produces decreases linearly over a lifetime. Although the melatonin anti-aging fad was thoroughly debunked following a large number of randomized trials, it was soon in the spotlight once more due to the observation that a healthy person's normal melatonin levels varies widely throughout each day: usually, levels rise in the evening and fall in the morning. Ever since the discovery that melatonin levels are highest at bedtime, melatonin has been purported by some to be an effective sleep-aid - it is especially popular for jet-lag. Melatonin's efficacy in treating insomnia is hotly debated and therefore in the US it is sold as a dietary supplement. "These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA" is printed on the packaging even though melatonin has been studied very extensively.
* [[Ramelteon]], a melatonin receptor [[agonist]], is a relatively new drug designed by using the melatonin molecule and the shapes of melatonin receptors as starting points.  Ramelteon binds to the same M1 and M2 receptors in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (the "biological clock" in the brain) as melatonin (M1 and M2 get their names from melatonin). It also may derive some of its properties from its three-times greater elimination half-life.  Ramelteon is not without detractors who claim that it is no more effective than melatonin, and melatonin is less expensive by orders of magnitude.  It is unclear whether Ramelteon causes its receptors to behave differently than they do when bound to melatonin, and Ramelteon may have a significantly greater [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for these receptors.  Better information on Ramelteon's effectiveness should be available soon, and despite questions of its efficacy, the general lack of side effects makes Ramelteon one of the very few sleep medications that could potentially be safely used by astronauts.
* [[Barbiturates]] and [[Benzodiazepines]] are both very strong sedatives.  While they certainly would work (at least short term) in helping astronauts sleep, they have side effects that could affect the astronaut's ability to perform his/her job, especially in the "morning."  This side effect renders barbiturates and benzodiazepines likely unfit as treatments for space insomnia.  Narcotics and most tranquilizers also fall into this category.
* [[Zolpidem]] and [[Zopiclone]] are sedative-hypnotics, better known by their trade names "Ambien" and "Lunesta".  These are extremely popular sleep-aids, due in large part to their effectiveness and significantly reduced side-effect profiles vis-a-vis benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  Although other drugs may be more effective in inducing sleep Zolpidem and Zopiclone essentially lack the sorts of side effects that disqualify other insomnia drugs for astronauts, for whom being able to wake up easily and quickly can be of paramount importance; astronauts who are not thinking clearly, are groggy, and are disoriented when a sudden emergency wakes them could end up trading their grogginess for the indifference of death in seconds.  Zolpidem, Zopiclone, and the like - in most people - are significantly less likely to cause drug-related daytime sleepiness, nor excessive drowsiness if woken abruptly.
* Practice good [[sleep hygiene]]. In other words, the bed is for sleeping only; get out of bed within a few moments of waking up.  ''Do not'' sit in bed watching TV or using a laptop.  When one is acclimated to spending many hours ''awake'' in bed, it can disrupt the body's natural set of daily cycles, called the [[circadian rhythm]].  While this is less of an issue for astronauts who have very limited entertainment options in their sleeping areas, another aspect of sleep hygiene is adhering to a specific pre-sleep routine (shower, brush teeth, fold up clothing, spend 20 minutes with a trashy novel, for example); observing this sort of routine regularly can significantly improve one's sleep quality.  Of course, sleep hygiene studies have all been conducted at 1G, but it seems possible (if not likely) that observing sleep hygiene would retain at least some efficacy in micro-gravity.
* [[Modafinil]] is a drug that is prescribed for narcolepsy and other disorders that involve excessive daytime exhaustion.  It has been approved in various military situations and for astronauts thanks to its ability to stave off fatigue.  It is unclear whether astronauts sometimes use the drug because they are sleep-deprived - it might only be used on spacewalks and in other high-risk situations.
* [[Dexedrine]] used to be the gold-standard for fighter pilots flying long and multiple sorties in a row, and therefore may have at some point been available if astronauts were in need of a wakefulness-promoting agent stronger than coffee.  Dexedrine is an amphetamine and amphetamines can have a whole host of undesirable side effects and is addictive.  Today, Modafinil has largely - if not entirely - replaced Dexedrine; reaction time and reasoning among pilots who are sleep-deprived and on Dexedrine suffer, and get worse the longer the pilot stays awake.   In one study, helicopter pilots that were given six-hundred milligrams of Modafinil every three hours were able to perform with the same accuracy as they did at pre-deprivation levels for 40 hours without sleep; significant impairment would have been evident had the pilots been given Dexedrine instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA365558&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |title=The Effects of Modafinil on Aviator Performance During 40 Hours of Continuous Wakefulness |date=June 1999 |author=John A.

===Spatial disorientation===

==Spaceflight Analogues==
Biomedical research in space is expensive and logistically and technically complicated, and thus limited. Conducting medical research in space alone will not provide humans with the depth of knowledge needed to ensure the safety of inter-planetary travellers. Complimentary to research in space is the use of spaceflight analogues. Analogues are particularly useful for the study of immunity, sleep, psychological factors, human performance, habitability, and telemedicine. Examples of spaceflight analogues include confinement chambers ([[Mars-500]]), sub-aqua habitats ([[NEEMO]]), and Antarctic ([[Concordia Station]]) and Arctic ([[Haughton–Mars Project]]) stations.
