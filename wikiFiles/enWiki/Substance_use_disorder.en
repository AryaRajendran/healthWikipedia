'''Substance use disorders''' include [[substance abuse]] and [[substance dependence]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100010058|Substance use disorders}}</ref> In DSM-IV, the conditions are formally diagnosed as one or the other, but it has been proposed that [[DSM-5]] combine the two into a single condition called "Substance-use disorder".<ref name="urlProposed Revision | APA DSM-5">{{cite web |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=431# |title=Proposed Revision &#124; APA DSM-5 |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

==Terminology and usage==
Although the term ''substance'' can refer to any physical matter, "substance abuse" has come to refer to the overindulgence in and dependence of a [[drug]] or other chemical leading to effects that are detrimental to the individual's physical and mental health, or the [[Quality of life|welfare]] of others.<ref name="fn_1">(1998). ''Mosby's Medical, Nursing, & Allied Health Dictionary''.  Edition 5.</ref> 

The disorder is characterized by a pattern of continued pathological use of a medication, [[drug abuse|non-medically indicated drug or toxin]], which results in repeated adverse social consequences related to drug use, such as failure to meet work, family, or school obligations, interpersonal conflicts, or legal problems.  There are on-going debates as to the exact distinctions between substance abuse and [[substance dependence]], but current practice standard distinguishes between the two by defining substance dependence in terms of physiological and behavioral symptoms of substance use, and substance abuse in terms of the social consequences of substance use.<ref name="fn_2">Pham-Kanter, Genevieve. (2001). "Substance abuse and dependence." ''The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine''. Second Edition. Jacqueline L. Longe, Ed. 5 vols. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Group.</ref>  

Substance abuse may lead to addiction or substance dependence.  Medically, physiologic dependence requires the development of [[physiological tolerance|tolerance]] leading to [[withdrawal]] symptoms.  Both abuse and dependence are distinct from [[Substance dependence|addiction]] which involves a [[compulsive behavior|compulsion]] to continue using the substance despite the negative consequences, and may or may not involve [[chemical dependency]]. Dependence almost always implies abuse, but abuse frequently occurs without dependence, particularly when an individual first begins to abuse a substance.  Dependence involves [[physiological]] processes while substance abuse reflects a complex interaction between the individual, the abused substance and society.<ref>[http://www.mclean.harvard.edu/research/adarc/]</ref>

Substance abuse is sometimes used as a synonym for [[drug abuse]], [[drug addiction]], and [[chemical dependency]], but actually refers to the use of substances in a manner outside sociocultural conventions.  All use of [[controlled drug]]s and all use of other drugs in a manner not dictated by convention (e.g. according to physician's orders or societal norms) is abuse according to this definition; however there is no universally accepted definition of substance abuse.

The physical harm for twenty drugs was compared in an article in the Lancet (see diagram, above right). Physical harm was assigned a value from 0 to 3 for acute harm, chronic harm and intravenous harm. Shown is the mean physical harm. Not shown, but also evaluated, was the social harm.

Substance use may be better understood as occurring on a spectrum from beneficial to problematic use. This conceptualization moves away from the ill-defined binary antonyms of "use" vs. "abuse" (see diagram, lower right) towards a more nuanced, public health-based understanding of substance use.

==Mediators & Moderators==
When a predictor variable and an outcome variable have a significant relationship, which is, in turn, influenced by a third variable, the relationship is said to be mediated by the third variable. In this relationship the predictor variable influences the mediating variable in a causal manner. This mediating variable then leads to the outcome, creating the relationship between the predictor and outcome. It is only because of this mediating variable that a relationship between the predictor and outcome exists.  Also, quasi-causal inferences may be drawn from mediated relationships. Mediation is best illustrated by the following model:

[[File:Mediator pathway.gif|thumb|Mediator Model]]

As demonstrated by the chart below, numerous studies have examined factors which mediate substance abuse or dependence. In these examples, the predictor variables lead to the mediator which in turn leads to the outcome, which is always substance abuse or dependence. For example, research has found that being raised in a single-parent home can lead to increased exposure to stress and that increased exposure to stress, not being raised in a single-parent home, leads to substance abuse or dependence.<ref name="pmid16393197">{{cite journal |author=Barrett AE, Turner RJ |title=Family structure and substance use problems in adolescence and early adulthood: examining explanations for the relationship |journal=Addiction |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=109–20 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16393197 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.01296.x |url=}}</ref> The following are some, but by no means all, of the possible mediators of substance abuse.

When a variable indicates the conditions under which a specific effect occurs as well as displays how the direction or strength varies within a given relationship, the variable is said to moderate the relationship. Another explanation is that a moderator variable indicates that an effect only occurs under specific conditions. Unlike a relationship containing a mediator variable, the impact of the predictor variable on the outcome is dependent on the value of the moderating variable. Also unlike a relationship involving mediation, no causal inferences can be drawn from a moderated relationship; relationships can only be described as correlated. However, moderated relationships do identify interaction effects between predictor and moderator variables. Moderation is best illustrated by the following model:

[[File:Moderator pathway.gif|thumb|Moderator Model]]

As demonstrated by the chart below, numerous studies have examined factors which moderate substance abuse or dependence. In these examples, the moderator variable impacts the level to which the strength of the relationship varies between a given predictor variable and the outcome of substance abuse or dependence. For example, there is a significant relationship between psychobehavioral risk factors, such as tolerance of deviance, rebelliousness, achievement, perceived drug risk, familism, family church attendance and other factors, and substance abuse and dependence. That relationship is moderated by familism which means that the strength of the relationship is increased or decreased based on the level of familism present in a given individual.<ref name="pmid16173675">{{cite journal |author=Brook JS, Pahl K |title=The protective role of ethnic and racial identity and aspects of an Africentric orientation against drug use among African American young adults |journal=J Genet Psychol |volume=166 |issue=3 |pages=329–45 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16173675 |pmc=1315285 |doi= 10.3200/GNTP.166.3.329-345|url=}}</ref>

Mediation and moderation research continues to inform the field’s knowledge and understanding of a pervasive and dangerous threat to public health, substance abuse and dependence. As the relationships between various predictor variables and the factors which influence them are more closely scrutinized, clinicians and researchers are provided with the necessary information to create more sophisticated and relevant methods of prevention and intervention. While these factors are important to the development of SUDs, there are plenty of other factors both known and unknown that influence the development of this disorder. As such, continued research is both necessary and invaluable.

==Additional Mediators and Moderators of Substance Abuse==
Mediators and Moderators Defined:
Baron and Kenny (1986) define a moderator as, “a qualitative (e.g., sex, race, class) or quantitative (e.g., level of reward) variable that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between and independent or predictor variable and a dependent or criterion variable” (p.&nbsp;1174).<ref name=Baron>{{cite journal |author=Baron RM, Kenny DA |title=The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=1173–82 |year=1986 |month=December |pmid=3806354 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173}}</ref> Moderators may operate as protective factors, decreasing the strength of the relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome. Conversely, moderators may heighten risk levels and strengthen the effects of the predictor on the outcome. In either instance, moderators do not explain why the connection exists, but rather affect the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables. 

A mediator, as defined by Baron and Kenny (1986), “represents the generative mechanism through which the focal independent variable is able to influence the dependent variable of interest” (p.&nbsp;1173).<ref name="Baron"/> Unlike moderators, mediators can explain the relationship between the predictor variable and outcome. Holmbeck (1997) elaborated on Baron and Kenny’s definition by adding, “the nature of the mediated relationship is such that the independent variable influences the mediator which, in turn, influences the outcome” (p.&nbsp;600).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holmbeck GN |title=Toward terminological, conceptual, and statistical clarity in the study of mediators and moderators: examples from the child-clinical and pediatric psychology literatures |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=599–610 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9256561 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.65.4.599}}</ref>
Examples of mediators and moderators in empirical research:

Examples of mediators and moderators can be found in several empirical studies. For example, Pilgrim et al.’s hypothesized mediation model posited that school success and time spent with friends mediated the relationship between parental involvement and risk-taking behavior with substance use (2006).<ref name="pmid16572302">{{cite journal |author=Pilgrim CC, Schulenberg JE, O'Malley PM, Bachman JG, Johnston LD |title=Mediators and moderators of parental involvement on substance use: a national study of adolescents |journal=Prev Sci |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=75–89 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16572302 |doi=10.1007/s11121-005-0019-9 |url=}}</ref> More specifically, the relationship between parental involvement and risk-taking behavior is explained via the interaction with third variables, school success and time spent with friends. In this example, increased parental involvement led to increased school success and decreased time with friends, both of which were associated with decreased drug use. Another example of mediation involved risk-taking behaviors. As risk-taking behaviors increased, school success decreased and time with friends increased, both of which were associated with increased drug use. 
A second example of a mediating variable is depression. In a study by Lo and Cheng (2007),<ref name="pmid17366254">{{cite journal |author=Lo CC, Cheng TC |title=The impact of childhood maltreatment on young adults' substance abuse |journal=Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=139–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17366254 |doi=10.1080/00952990601091119 |url=}}</ref> depression was found to mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and subsequent substance abuse in adulthood. In other words, childhood physical abuse is associated with increased depression, which in turn, in associated with increased drug and alcohol use in young adulthood. More specifically, depression helps to explain how childhood abuse is related to subsequent substance abuse in young adulthood. 

A third example of a mediating variable is an increase of externalizing symptoms. King and Chassin (2008)<ref>{{cite journal |author=King KM, Chassin L |title=Adolescent stressors, psychopathology, and young adult substance dependence: a prospective study |journal=J Stud Alcohol Drugs |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=629–38 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18781237 |pmc=2575393}}</ref> conducted research examining the relationship between stressful life events and drug dependence in young adulthood. Their findings identified problematic externalizing behavior on subsequent substance dependency. In other words, stressful life events are associated with externalizing symptoms, such as aggression or hostility, which can lead to peer alienation or acceptance by socially deviant peers, which could lead to increased drug use. The relationship between stressful life events and subsequent drug dependence however exists via the presence of the mediation effects of externalizing behaviors.

An example of a moderating variable is level of cognitive distortion. An individual with high levels of cognitive distortion might react adversely to potentially innocuous events, and may have increased difficulty reacting to them in an adaptive manner (Shoal & Giancola, 2005).<ref name="pmid16366766">{{cite journal |author=Shoal GD, Giancola PR |title=The relation between social problems and substance use in adolescent boys: an investigation of potential moderators |journal=Exp Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=357–66 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16366766 |doi=10.1037/1064-1297.13.4.357 |url=}}</ref> In their study, Shoal and Giancola investigated the moderating effects of cognitive distortion on adolescent substance use. Individuals with low levels of cognitive distortion may be more apt to choose more adaptive methods of coping with social problems, thereby potentially reducing the risk of drug use. Individuals with high levels of cognitive distortions, because of their increased misperceptions and misattributions, are at increased risk for social difficulties. Individuals may be more likely to react aggressively or inappropriately, potentially alienating themselves from their peers, thereby putting them at greater risk for delinquent behaviors, including substance use and abuse. In this study, social problems are a significant risk factor for drug use when moderated by high levels of cognitive distortions.

== Terminology ==

In the [[United States]], [[physical dependence]], [[drug abuse|abuse]] of, and [[withdrawal]] from [[drugs]] and other [[substance abuse|substances]] is outlined in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV TR). It does not use the word 'addiction' at all. It has instead a section about [[Substance dependence]]:
<blockquote>"'''Substance dependence''' When an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, [[substance dependence]] may be diagnosed. Compulsive and repetitive use may result in tolerance to the effect of the drug and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped. This, along with [[Substance abuse|Substance Abuse]] are considered Substance Use Disorders..."<ref>[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/subdep.htm DSM-IV & DSM-IV-TR:Substance Dependence]</ref> </blockquote>

Terminology has become quite complicated in the field. [[Pharmacologist]]s continue to speak of addiction from a physiologic standpoint (some call this a [[physical dependence]]); psychiatrists refer to the disease state as [[Substance dependence|psychological dependence]]; most other physicians refer to the disease as addiction. The field of psychiatry is now considering,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} as they move from DSM-IV to DSM-V, transitioning from "substance dependence" to "addiction" as terminology for the disease state.

Addiction is now narrowly defined as "uncontrolled, compulsive use"; if there is no harm being suffered by, or damage done to, the patient or another party, then clinically it may be considered [[compulsive behavior|compulsive]], but to the definition of some it is not categorized as "addiction." In practice, the two kinds of addiction are not always easy to distinguish. Addictions often have both physical and psychological components.

There is also a lesser known situation called [[pseudo-addiction]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Weissman| first = D.E.| authorlink = | coauthors = J.D. Haddox| title = Opioid pseudoaddiction--an iatrogenic syndrome| journal = Pain| volume = 36| issue = 3| pages = 363–366| publisher = International Association for the Study of Pain| year = 1989| doi = 10.1016/0304-3959(89)90097-3| pmid=2710565 }}</ref> A patient will exhibit drug-seeking behavior reminiscent of psychological addiction, but they tend to have genuine pain or other symptoms that have been under-treated.  Unlike true psychological addiction, these behaviors tend to stop when the pain is adequately treated.

==Physical and psychological dependency==
The medical community now makes a careful theoretical distinction between ''physical dependence'' (characterized by symptoms of [[withdrawal]]) and ''psychological dependence'' (or simply ''addiction''). 

The DSM definition of addiction can be boiled down to compulsive use of a substance (or engagement in an activity) despite ongoing negative consequences—this is also a summary of what used to be called "psychological dependency."  Physical dependence, on the other hand, is simply needing a substance to function.  Humans are all physically dependent on oxygen, food and water.  A drug can cause physical dependence and not addiction (for example, some blood pressure medications, which can produce fatal withdrawal symptoms if not tapered) and can cause addiction without physical dependence (the withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine are all psychological, there is no associated vomiting or diarrhea as there is with opiate withdrawal).

=== Physical dependency ===
[[Physical dependence]] on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic [[withdrawal]] symptoms when the substance is suddenly discontinued. [[Opiates]], [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[barbiturate]]s,  [[alcohol]] and [[nicotine]] induce physical dependence. On the other hand, some categories of substances share this property and are still not considered addictive: [[cortisone]], [[beta blocker]]s and most [[antidepressant]]s are examples. So, while physical dependency can be a major factor in the psychology of addiction and most often becomes a primary motivator in the continuation of an addiction, the initial primary attribution of an addictive substance is usually its ability to induce pleasure, although with continued use the goal is not so much to induce pleasure as it is to relieve the anxiety caused by the absence of a given addictive substance, causing it to become used compulsively.

Some substances induce physical dependence or [[physiological tolerance]] - but not addiction&nbsp;— for example many [[laxative]]s, which are not psychoactive; nasal [[decongestant]]s, which can cause rebound congestion if used for more than a few days in a row; and some antidepressants, most notably [[venlafaxine]], [[paroxetine]] and [[sertraline]], as they have quite short [[Half-life|half-lives]], so stopping them abruptly causes a more rapid change in the neurotransmitter balance in the brain than many other antidepressants.  Many non-addictive prescription drugs should not be suddenly stopped, so a doctor should be consulted before abruptly discontinuing them.

The speed with which a given individual becomes addicted to various substances varies with the substance, the frequency of use, the means of ingestion, the intensity of pleasure or euphoria, and the individual's genetic and psychological susceptibility. Some people may exhibit alcoholic tendencies from the moment of first intoxication, while most people can drink socially without ever becoming addicted. Opioid dependent individuals have different responses to even low doses of opioids than the majority of people, although this may be due to a variety of other factors, as opioid use heavily stimulates pleasure-inducing neurotransmitters in the brain. Nonetheless, because of these variations, in addition to the adoption and twin studies that have been well replicated, much of the medical community is satisfied that addiction is in part genetically moderated. That is, one's genetic makeup may regulate how susceptible one is to a substance and how easily one may become psychologically attached to a pleasurable routine.

[[Eating disorder]]s are complicated pathological mental illnesses and thus are not the same as addictions described in this article. Eating disorders, which some argue are not addictions at all, are driven by a multitude of factors, most of which are highly different than the factors behind addictions described in this article. It has been reported, however, that patients with eating disorders can successfully be treated with the same non-pharmacological protocols used in patients with chemical addiction disorders.<ref>AJ Giannini, M Keller, GC Colapietro, SM Melemis, N Leskovac,  T Timcisko. Comparison of alternative treatment techniques in bulimia: The chemical dependency approach. Psychological Reports. 82(2):451-458, 1998.</ref>
Gambling is another potentially addictive behavior with some biological overlap. Conversely gambling urges have emerged with the administration of [[Pramipexole|Mirapex]] (pramipexole), a dopamine [[agonist]].<ref>AJ Giannini. Drugs of Abuse--Second Edition. Los Angeles, Practice Management Information Corporation, 1997.</ref>

The obsolete term physical addiction is deprecated, because of its connotations. In modern pain management with opioids physical dependence is nearly universal.  While opiates are essential in the treatment of acute pain, the benefit of this class of medication in chronic pain is not well proven.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Clearly, there are those who would not function well without opiate treatment; on the other hand, many states are noting significant increases in non-intentional deaths related to opiate use.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} High-quality, long-term studies are needed to better delineate the risks and benefits of chronic opiate use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Psychological dependency===
In the now outdated conceptualization of the problem, psychological dependency leads to psychological withdrawal symptoms (such as [[craving (withdrawal)|cravings]], [[irritability]], [[insomnia]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], etc.). Addiction can in theory be derived from any rewarding behaviour, and is believed to be strongly associated with the [[dopamine|dopaminergic system]] of the [[brain]]'s [[reward system]] (as in the case of [[cocaine]] and amphetamines). Some claim that it is a [[habit (psychology)|habitual]] means to avoid undesired activity, but typically it is only so to a clinical level in individuals who have emotional, social, or [[Mental illness|psychological dysfunctions]] (psychological addiction is defined as such), replacing normal positive stimuli not otherwise attained.

A person who is physically dependent, but not psychologically dependent can have their dose slowly dropped until they are no longer physically dependent. However, if that person is psychologically dependent, they are still at serious risk for relapse into abuse and subsequent physical dependence.

Psychological dependence does not have to be limited only to substances; even activities and behavioural patterns can be considered addictions, if they become uncontrollable, e.g. [[problem gambling]], [[Internet addiction disorder|Internet addiction]], [[computer addiction]], [[sexual addiction]] / [[pornography addiction]], [[overeating]], [[self-injury]], [[compulsive buying disorder|compulsive buying]], or work addiction.

== Management ==
Early editions of the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) described addiction as a physical dependency to a substance that resulted in withdrawal symptoms in its absence. Recent editions, including DSM-IV, have moved toward a diagnostic instrument that classifies such conditions as dependency, rather than addiction.

===Addiction severity index===
Some medical systems, including those of at least 15 states of the United States, refer to an [[Addiction Severity Index]]<ref>Butler SF, Budman SH, Goldman RJ, Newman FL, Beckley KE, Trottier D. Initial Validation of a Computer-Administered Addiction Severity Index: The ASI-MV Psychology of Addictive Behaviors 2001 March</ref> to assess the severity of problems related to substance use. The index assesses problems in six areas: medical, employment/support, alcohol and other drug use, legal, family/social, and psychiatric.

===Detoxification===
Early treatment of acute withdrawal often includes medical [[detoxification]], which can include doses of [[anxiolytic]]s or narcotics to reduce symptoms of withdrawal. An experimental drug, [[ibogaine]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alper KR, Lotsof HS, Kaplan CD |title=The ibogaine medical subculture |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=9–24 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18029124 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2007.08.034 |url=}}</ref> is also proposed to treat withdrawal and craving. 

[[Neurofeedback]] therapy has shown statistically significant improvements in numerous researches [http://www.neurofeedback-scotland.com/alpha.html] conducted on alcoholic as well as mixed substance abuse population. In chronic opiate addiction, a surrogate drug such as [[methadone]] is sometimes offered as a form of [[opiate replacement therapy]]. But treatment approaches universal focus on the individual's ultimate choice to pursue an alternate course of action.

===Tailoring treatment===
Therapists often classify patients with chemical dependencies as either interested or not interested in changing. 

Treatments usually involve planning for specific ways to avoid the addictive stimulus, and therapeutic interventions intended to help a client learn healthier ways to find satisfaction. Clinical leaders in recent years have attempted to tailor intervention approaches to specific influences that affect addictive behavior, using therapeutic interviews in an effort to discover factors that led a person to embrace unhealthy, addictive sources of pleasure or relief from pain.

From the [[applied behavior analysis]] literature and the [[behavioral psychology]] literature, several evidenced-based intervention programs have emerged (1) behavioral marital therapy (2) community reinforcement approach (3) cue exposure therapy and (4) contingency management strategies.<ref>{{cite journal | last = O'Donohue| first = W| authorlink = | coauthors = K.E.

== Causes ==
Several explanations (or "models") have been presented to explain addiction. These divide, more or less, into the models which stress biological or genetic causes for addiction, and those which stress social or purely psychological causes. Of course there are also many models which attempt to see addiction as both a physiological ''and'' a psycho-social phenomenon.

===Psychosocial===

* The ''[[free-will]] model'' or "[[life-process model of addiction|life-process model]]" proposed by [[Thomas Szasz]] and later refined by Jeffrey Schaler questions the very concept of "addiction." Free-will model theorists argue that addiction cannot be a disease, because drug-taking is a behavior, and all behaviors are [[choice]]s. Szasz views addiction as a metaphor, and that the only reason to make the distinction between habit and addiction "is to persecute somebody."<ref>{{cite video
| people = Buckley, William F., Szasz, Professor Thomas Stephen
| title = Drugs and Freedom
| url = http://hoohila.stanford.edu/firingline/programView.php?programID=583
| medium = Partial transcript
|date = 1973}}</ref> Free-will model theorists believe that individuals are capable of deliberate action in pursuit of chosen goals, and that physiology alone can never determine whether a person will take a drug, or how often they will take it. The free-will model is opposed by groups like the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].

* The ''[[pleasure]] model'' proposed by professor [[Nils Bejerot]]. Addiction "is an emotional fixation (sentiment) acquired through learning, which intermittently or continually expresses itself in purposeful, stereotyped behavior with the character and force of a natural drive, aiming at a specific pleasure or the avoidance of a specific discomfort."  "The pleasure mechanism may be stimulated in a number of ways and give rise to a strong fixation on repetitive behavior. Stimulation with drugs is only one of many ways, but one of the simplest, strongest,and often also the most destructive" "If the pleasure stimulation becomes so strong that it captivates an individual with the compulsion and force characteristic of natural drives, then there exists...an addiction"<ref name="NIDA">[http://www.nida.nih.gov/pdf/monographs/30.pdf Nils Bejerot in Theories of Drug abuse, Selected contemporary perspectives, page 246-255, [[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]], 1980]</ref>  The pleasure model is used as one of the reason for [[zero tolerance]] for use of illicit drugs.''

* The ''[[experiential]] model'' devised by [[Stanton Peele]] argues that addictions occur with regard to experiences generated by various involvements, whether drug-induced or not.  This model is in opposition to the disease, genetic, and neurobiological approaches.  Among other things, it proposes that addiction is both more temporary or situational than the disease model claims, and is often outgrown through natural processes.

* The ''[[opponent-process]] model'' generated by Richard Soloman states that for every psychological event A will be followed by its opposite psychological event B. For example, the pleasure one experiences from [[heroin]] is followed by an opponent process of withdrawal, or the terror of jumping out of an airplane is rewarded with intense pleasure when the parachute opens. This model is related to the opponent process color theory.  If you look at the color red then quickly look at a gray area you will see green.  There are many examples of opponent processes in the nervous system including taste, motor movement, touch, vision, and hearing. Opponent-processes occurring at the sensory level may translate "downstream" into addictive or habit-forming behavior.

* The ''[[allostatic]] (stability through change) model'' generated by [[George Koob]] and [[Michel LeMoal]] is a modification of the opponent process theory where continued use of a drug leads to a spiralling of uncontrolled use, negative emotional states and withdrawal and a shift into use to  new allostatic set point which is lower than that maintained before use of the drug.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koob GF, Le Moal M |title=Drug addiction, dysregulation of reward, and allostasis |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–129 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11120394 |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(00)00195-0 |url=}}</ref>

* The ''[[culture|cultural]] model'' recognizes that the influence of culture is a strong determinant of whether or not individuals fall prey to certain addictions. For example, alcoholism is rare among [[Saudi Arabia]]ns, where obtaining alcohol is difficult and using alcohol is prohibited. In North America, on the other hand, the incidence of [[gambling]] addictions soared in the last two decades of the 20th century, mirroring the growth of the gaming industry. Half of all patients diagnosed as alcoholic are born into families where alcohol is used heavily, suggesting that familiar influence, genetic factors, or more likely both, play a role in the development of addiction. What also needs to be noted is that when people don't gain a sense of moderation through their development they can be just as likely, if not more, to abuse substances than people born into alcoholic families. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

* The ''[[moral]] model'' states that addictions are the result of human weakness, and are defects of [[moral character|character]]. Those who advance this model do not accept that there is any biological basis for addiction. They often have scant sympathy for people with serious addictions, believing either that a person with greater moral strength could have the force of will to break an addiction, or that the addict demonstrated a great moral failure in the first place by starting the addiction. The moral model is widely applied to dependency on illegal substances, perhaps purely for social or political reasons, but is no longer widely considered to have any therapeutic value. Elements of the moral model, especially a focus on individual choices, have found enduring roles in other approaches to the treatment of dependencies.

* Similarly, the ''[[rational addiction]] model'' hypothesizes that addictions (to heroin, tobacco, television, etc.) can be usefully modeled as specific kinds of rational, forward-looking, optimal consumption plans. In other words, addiction is perceived as a rational response to individual and/or environmental factors.

* The ''[[chemical]] model'' : Nearly all drugs, directly or indirectly, target the brain’s reward system by flooding the circuit with dopamine.<ref name=addict>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/understand.html|title=Understanding Drug Abuse and Addiction}}</ref> As a person continues to overstimulating the “reward circuit," the brain adapts to the overwhelming surges in dopamine by producing less of the hormones or by reducing the number of receptors in the reward circuit. As a result, the chemical’s impact on the reward circuit is lessened, reducing the abuser’s ability to enjoy the things that previously brought pleasure.<ref name=addict /> This decrease compels those addicted to dopamine to increase the drug consumption in order to attempt to bring their "feel-good" hormone level back to normal—an effect known as [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]]. Development of dopamine [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] can eventually lead to profound changes in neurons and brain circuits, with the potential to severely compromise the long-term health of the brain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abovetheinfluence.com/facts/science-behind-addiction.aspx#|title=The Science Behind Drug Use and Addiction}}</ref> Modern antipsychotics are designed to block dopamine function. Unfortunately, this blocking can also cause relapses in depression, and can increase addictive behaviors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscid.org/encyclopedia/Dopamine|title=Dopamine}}</ref>

* Finally, the ''blended model'' attempts to consider elements of all other models in developing a therapeutic approach to dependency. It holds that the mechanism of dependency is different for different individuals, and that each case must be considered on its own merits.

===Psychiatric disorders===
Some psychiatric disorders may contribute to a person developing a substance use disorder. For example approximately one in four people with a substance use disorder have co-morbid attention deficit disorder.<ref name="van Emmerik-van Oortmerssen-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = van Emmerik-van Oortmerssen | first1 = K. | last2 = van de Glind | first2 = G. | last3 = van den Brink | first3 = W. | last4 = Smit | first4 = F. | last5 = Crunelle | first5 = CL. | last6 = Swets | first6 = M. | last7 = Schoevers | first7 = RA. | title = Prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in substance use disorder patients: a meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis. | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume = 122 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 11–9 | month = Apr | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.12.007 | PMID = 22209385 }}</ref>

===Physiological===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
* The ''[[disease model of addiction]]'' holds that addiction is a [[disease]], coming about as a result of either the impairment of [[neurochemistry|neurochemical]] or [[behavioral]] processes, or of some combination of the two. Within this model, addictive disease is treated by specialists in [[Addiction Medicine]]. Within the clinical field, the [[American Medical Association]], National Association of Social Workers, and [[American Psychological Association]] all have policies which are predicated on the theory that addictive processes represent a disease state. Most treatment approaches, as well, are based on the idea that dependencies are behavioral dysfunctions, and, therefore, contain, at least to some extent, elements of physical or mental disease. Organizations such as the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] believe the research-based evidence for addiction's status as a disease is overwhelming.

* The ''[[genetics|genetic]] model'' posits a genetic predisposition to certain behaviors. It is frequently noted that certain addictions "run in the family," and while researchers continue to explore the extent of genetic influence, many researchers argue that there is strong evidence that genetic predisposition is often a factor in dependency.

The development of addiction is thought to involve a simultaneous process of 1) increased focus on and engagement in a particular behavior and 2) the attenuation or "shutting down" of other behaviors. For example, under certain experimental circumstances such as [[social deprivation]] and boredom, animals allowed the unlimited ability to self-administer certain psychoactive drugs will show such a strong preference that they will forgo food, sleep, and sex for continued access. The neuro-anatomical correlate of this is that the brain regions involved in driving goal-directed behavior grow increasingly selective for particular motivating stimuli and rewards, to the point that the brain regions involved in the inhibition of behavior can no longer effectively send "stop" signals. A good analogy is to imagine flooring the gas pedal in a car with very bad brakes. In this case, the limbic system is thought to be the major "driving force" and the orbitofrontal cortex is the substrate of the top-down inhibition.

A specific portion of the limbic circuit known as the [[mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] dopaminergic system is hypothesized to play an important role in translation of motivation to motor behavior- and reward-related learning in particular.  It is typically defined as the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and the bundle of [[dopamine]]-containing fibers that are connecting them. This system is commonly implicated in the seeking out and consumption of rewarding stimuli or events, such as sweet-tasting foods or sexual interaction. However, its importance to addiction research goes beyond its role in "natural" motivation:  while the specific site or mechanism of action may differ, all known drugs of abuse have the common effect in that they elevate the level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This may happen directly, such as through blockade of the dopamine re-uptake mechanism (see [[cocaine]]). It may also happen indirectly, such as through stimulation of the dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA that synapse onto neurons in the accumbens (see [[opiates]]). The euphoric effects of drugs of abuse are thought to be a direct result of the acute increase in accumbal dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wise RA |title=Neurobiology of addiction |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=243–51 |year=1996 |month=April |pmid=8725967 |doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(96)80079-1 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-4388(96)80079-1}}</ref>

The human body has a natural tendency to maintain [[homeostasis]], and the central nervous system is no exception. Chronic elevation of dopamine will result in a decrease in the number of dopamine [[Transmembrane receptor|receptors]] available in a process known as [[downregulation]]. The decreased number of receptors changes the permeability of the cell membrane located post-synaptically, such that the post-synaptic neuron is less excitable- i.e.: less able to respond to chemical signaling with an electrical impulse, or [[action potential]]. It is hypothesized that this dulling of the responsiveness of the brain's reward pathways contributes to the inability to feel pleasure, known as [[anhedonia]], often observed in addicts. The increased requirement for dopamine to maintain the same electrical activity is the basis of both [[physiological tolerance]] and withdrawal associated with addiction.

In cases of physical dependency on [[depressant]]s of the [[central nervous system]] such as [[opioids]], [[barbiturate]]s, or alcohol, the absence of the substance can lead to symptoms of severe physical discomfort. Withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives such as barbiturates or [[benzodiazepines]] (valium-family) can result in seizures and even death. By contrast, withdrawal from opioids, which can be extremely uncomfortable, is rarely if ever life-threatening. In cases of dependence and withdrawal, the body has become so dependent on high concentrations of the particular chemical that it has stopped producing its own natural versions (endogenous ligands) and instead produces opposing chemicals. When the addictive substance is withdrawn, the effects of the opposing chemicals can become overwhelming. For example, chronic use of sedatives (alcohol, [[barbiturate]]s, or benzodiazepines) results in higher chronic levels of stimulating [[neurotransmitter]]s such as glutamate. Very high levels of glutamate kill nerve cells, a phenomenon called excitatory neurotoxicity.

== Addiction and drug control legislation ==
Most countries have legislation which brings various drugs and drug-like substances under the control of licensing systems. Typically this legislation covers any or all of the opiates, [[amphetamines]], [[cannabinoids]], [[cocaine]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[hallucinogen]]s ([[tryptamines]], [[LSD]], [[phencyclidine]], and [[psilocybin]]) and a variety of more modern synthetic drugs, and unlicensed production, supply or possession may be a criminal offense.

Usually, however, drug classification under such legislation is not related simply to addictiveness. The substances covered often have very different addictive properties. Some are highly prone to cause physical dependency, whilst others rarely cause any form of compulsive need whatsoever.

Also, although the legislation may be justifiable on moral grounds to some, it can make addiction or dependency a much more serious issue for the individual. Reliable supplies of a drug become difficult to secure as illegally produced substances may have contaminants. Withdrawal from the substances or associated contaminants can cause additional health issues and the individual becomes vulnerable to both criminal abuse and legal punishment. Criminal elements that can be involved in the profitable trade of such substances can also cause physical harm to users.

== Opposition to common views ==
[[Thomas Szasz]] denies that addiction is a psychiatric problem. In many of his works, he argues that addiction is a choice, and that a drug addict is one who simply prefers a socially taboo substance rather than, say, a low risk lifestyle.  In ''Our Right to Drugs'', Szasz cites the biography of [[Malcolm X]] to corroborate his economic views towards addiction: Malcolm claimed that quitting cigarettes was harder than shaking his [[heroin]] addiction.  Szasz postulates that humans always have a choice, and it is foolish to call someone an "addict" just because they prefer a [[drug]] induced [[happiness|euphoria]] to a more popular and socially welcome lifestyle.

Professor John Booth Davies at the [[University of Strathclyde]] has argued in his book ''The Myth of Addiction'' that "people take drugs because they want to and because it makes sense for them to do so given the choices available" as opposed to the view that "they are compelled to by the pharmacology of the drugs they take."<ref>{{cite book | last = Davies| first = John Booth| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Myth of Addiction| publisher = Psychology Press Ltd (2nd rev edition)| date = 1998-01-18| location = | pages = | url = http://www.druglibrary.org/special/davies/mythprologue.htm| doi =  | isbn = 978-90-5702-237-1}}</ref>  He uses an adaptation of [[attribution theory]] (what he calls the theory of functional attributions) to argue that the statement "I am addicted to drugs" is functional, rather than veridical. [[Stanton Peele]] has put forward similar views.

Experimentally, Bruce K. Alexander used the classic experiment of [[Rat Park]] to show that "addicted" behavior in rats only occurred when the rats had no other options. When other options and behavioural opportunities were put in place, the rats soon showed far more complex behaviors.
