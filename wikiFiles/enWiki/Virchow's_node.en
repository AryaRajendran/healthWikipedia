'''Virchow's node''' (or '''signal node''') is a [[lymph node]] in the left [[supraclavicular fossa]] (the area above the left [[clavicle]]). It takes its supply from [[lymph vessel]]s in the [[abdominal cavity]]. Virchow's node is also sometimes coined "the seat of the devil" given its ominous association with malignant disease. The finding of an enlarged, hard node (also referred to as '''Troisier's sign''') has long been regarded as strongly indicative of the presence of [[cancer]] in the abdomen, specifically [[gastric cancer]], that has [[metastasis|spread]] through the lymph vessels. It is sometimes called the '''signal node''' or '''sentinel node''' for the same reason. Despite this, the concept is not directly related to the [[sentinel node procedure]] sometimes used in cancer surgery, and it is also unrelated to the "sentinel gland" of the [[greater omentum]].<ref>{{eMedicineDictionary|sentinel+gland}}</ref>

It is named after [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821–1902), the [[Germany|German]] [[pathology|pathologist]] who first described the gland and its association with gastric cancer in 1848.<ref name=Virchow>{{cite journal | author=Virchow R | title=Zur Diagnose der Krebse in Unterleibe | journal=Med. Reform. | year=1848 | volume=45 | pages=248}}</ref> The [[France|French]] pathologist [[Charles Emile Troisier]] noted in 1889 that other abdominal cancers, too, could spread to the node.<ref name=Troisier>{{cite journal | author=Troisier CE | title=L'adénopathie sus-claviculaire dans les cancers de l'abdomen | journal=Arch. Gen. de Med. | year=1889 | volume=1 | pages=129–138 and 297–309}}</ref>

==Clinical significance==
Malignancies of the internal organs can reach an advanced stage before giving symptoms. [[Stomach cancer]], for example, can remain [[asymptomatic]] while [[metastasis|metastasizing]]. One of the first visible spots where these tumors metastasize is the left supraclavicular lymph node. The left supraclavicular node is the classical Virchow's node because it is on the left side of the neck where the [[lymphatic system|lymphatic]] drainage of most of the body (from the [[thoracic duct]]) enters the venous circulation via the left [[subclavian vein]].The metastasis blocks the thoracic duct leading to regurgitation into the surrounding nodes i.e. virchow's node. Another concept is that one of the supraclavicular nodes corresponds to the end node along the thoracic duct and hence the enlargement.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mizutani M, Nawata S, Hirai I, Murakami G, Kimura W |title=Anatomy and histology of Virchow's node |journal=Anat Sci Int |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=193–8 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16333915 |doi=10.1111/j.1447-073X.2005.00114.x |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v80502729p82m538/fulltext.pdf | format=PDF}}</ref>

[[Differential diagnosis]] of an enlarged Virchow's node includes [[lymphoma]], various intra-abdominal malignancies, [[breast cancer]], and [[infection]] (e.g. of the arm).  Similarly, an enlarged right supraclavicular lymph node tends to drain thoracic malignancies such as lung and [[esophageal cancer]], as well as [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].
