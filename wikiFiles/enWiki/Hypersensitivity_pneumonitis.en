'''Hypersensitivity pneumonitis''' (HP; also called '''extrinsic allergic alveolitis''', EAA) is an [[inflammation]] of the [[alveoli]] within the [[lung]] caused by [[hypersensitivity]] to inhaled organic dusts.  Sufferers are commonly exposed to the dust by their occupation or hobbies.

==Pathophysiology==
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis involves inhalation of an [[antigen]]. This leads to an exaggerated [[immune]] response ([[hypersensitivity]]). [[Type III hypersensitivity]] and [[type IV hypersensitivity]] occur in hypersensitivity pneumonitis.<ref name="pmid15316440">{{cite journal |author=Mohr LC |title=Hypersensitivity pneumonitis |journal=Curr Opin Pulm Med |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=401–11 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15316440 |doi= 10.1097/01.mcp.0000135675.95674.29|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1070-5287&volume=10&issue=5&spage=401}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
{{Cleanup|section|date=July 2011}}
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is categorized as acute, subacute, and chronic based on the duration of the illness.<ref>http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/pulmonary/ild/conditions/hp/signs.html signs and symptoms</ref>

===Acute===
In the [[Acute (medical)|acute]] form of HP, symptoms may develop 4–6 hours following heavy exposure to the provoking antigen. Symptoms include [[fever]], [[chills]], [[malaise]], [[cough]], [[chest tightness]], [[dyspnea]], and [[headache]]. Symptoms resolve within 12 hours to several days upon cessation of exposure.<ref name="Sharma"/>

Acute HP is characterized by poorly formed noncaseating interstitial [[granuloma]]s and mononuclear cell infiltration in a peribronchial distribution with prominent giant cells.<ref name="Sharma"/>

On [[chest radiograph]]s, a diffuse micronodular interstitial pattern (at times with ground-glass density in the lower and middle lung zones) may be observed. Findings are normal in approximately 10% of patients." In high-resolution [[CT scan]]s, [[Ground glass opacity|ground-glass opacities]] or diffusely increased radiodensities are present. Pulmonary function tests show reduced diffusion capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide ([[DLCO]]). Many patients have hypoxemia at rest, and all patients desaturate with exercise.<ref name="Sharma"/>

===Subacute===
Patients with [[subacute]] HP gradually develop a [[productive cough]], [[dyspnea]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[weight loss]], and [[pleurisy]]. Symptoms are similar to the acute form of the disease, but are less severe and last longer. On chest radiographs, micronodular or reticular opacities are most prominent in mid-to-lower lung zones.<ref name="Sharma"/> Findings may be present in patients who have experienced repeated acute attacks.

The subacute, or intermittent, form produces more well-formed noncaseating granulomas, [[bronchiolitis]] with or without organizing [[pneumonia]], and interstitial [[fibrosis]].<ref name="Sharma"/>

===Chronic===
In chronic HP, patients often lack a history of acute episodes. They have an insidious onset of cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. This is associated with partial to complete but gradual reversibility. Avoiding any further exposure is recommended. [[Nail clubbing|Clubbing]] is observed in 50% of patients. [[Tachypnea]], respiratory distress, and inspiratory crackles over lower lung fields often are present.<ref name="Sharma"/>

On chest radiographs, progressive fibrotic changes with loss of lung volume particularly affect the upper lobes. Nodular or ground-glass opacities are not present. Features of emphysema are found on significant chest films and CT scans.<ref name="Sharma"/>

Chronic forms reveal additional findings of chronic interstitial inflammation and alveolar destruction ([[honeycomb]]ing) associated with dense fibrosis. Cholesterol clefts or [[Asteroid body|asteroid bodies]] are present within or outside granulomas.<ref name="Sharma"/>

In addition, many patients have hypoxemia at rest, and all patients desaturate with exercise.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is based upon a history of [[symptoms]] after exposure to the [[allergen]] and [[Clinical research|clinical tests]].  A physician may take blood tests, seeking signs of [[inflammation]], a [[chest X-ray]] and [[lung function test]]s.  The sufferer shows a [[restrictive]] loss of lung function.

Although overlapping in many cases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be distinguished from [[occupational asthma]] in that it is not restricted to only occupational exposure, and that asthma generally is classified as a [[type I hypersensitivity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-immuno.path.cam.ac.uk/~immuno/part1/lec13/lec13_97.html |title=Lecture 14: Hypersensitivity |work= |accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaaai.org/aadmc/ate/category.asp?cat=1008 |title=Allergy & Asthma Disease Management Center: Ask the Expert |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref> Unlike asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis targets [[lung alveoli]] rather than [[bronchi]].<ref name=Kumar503>Page 503 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |edition=8th |ref={{harvid|Kumar|2007}}}}</ref>

===Lung biopsy===
[[File:Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis - histology.jpg|thumb|Low magnification view of the histology of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The interstitium is expanded by a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Two multinucleated giant cells can be seen within the interstitium at left, and a plug of organizing pneumonia at bottom left.]]

Lung [[biopsies]] can be diagnostic in cases of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or may help to suggest the diagnosis and trigger or intensify the search for an [[allergen]]. The main feature of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis on lung biopsies is expansion of the interstitium by lymphocytes accompanied by an occasional multinucleated giant cell or loose [[granuloma]]. <ref>Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay. [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2078434-overview "Pathology of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis"], Retrieved on 3 May 2013.</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA.|title=Granulomatous lung disease: an approach to the differential diagnosis  |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=669&ndash;690 |year=2010 |pmid=20441499 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165-134.5.667|url=}}</ref>

When fibrosis develops in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the differential diagnosis in lung biopsies includes the [[idiopathic interstitial pneumonia]]s.<ref name=pmid16061708>{{cite journal |author=Ohtani Y, Saiki S, Kitaichi M, ''et al.'' |title=Chronic bird fancier's lung: histopathological and clinical correlation. An application of the 2002 ATS/ERS consensus classification of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias |journal=Thorax |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=665–71 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16061708 |pmc=1747497 |doi=10.1136/thx.2004.027326 |url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16061708}}</ref> This group of diseases includes [[usual interstitial pneumonia]], [[non-specific interstitial pneumonia]] and [[cryptogenic organizing pneumonia]], among others. <ref>Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay. [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2078434-overview "Pathology of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis"], Retrieved on 3 May 2013.</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA.|title=Granulomatous lung disease: an approach to the differential diagnosis  |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=669&ndash;690 |year=2010 |pmid=20441499 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165-134.5.667|url=}}</ref>

The prognosis of some idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, e.g. idiopathic usual interstitial pneumonia (i.e. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), are very poor and the treatments of little help.  This contrasts the prognosis (and treatment) for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which is generally fairly good if the allergen is identified and exposures to it significantly reduced or eliminated.  Thus, a lung biopsy, in some cases, may make a decisive difference.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be called many different names, based on the provoking [[antigen]]. These include:

Of these types, Farmer's Lung and Bird-Breeder's Lung are the most common. "Studies document 8-540 cases per 100,000 persons per year for farmers and 6000-21,000 cases per 100,000 persons per year for pigeon breeders. High attack rates are documented in sporadic outbreaks. Prevalence varies by region, climate, and farming practices. HP affects 0.4-7% of the farming population. Reported prevalence among bird fanciers is estimated to be 20-20,000 cases per 100,000 persons at risk." <ref name="Sharma">Sharma, Sat. [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1103.htm Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis]. ''eMedicine'', June 1, 2006.</ref>

==Treatment==
The best treatment is to avoid the provoking allergen, as chronic exposure can cause permanent damage.  [[Corticosteroids]] such as [[prednisolone]] may help to control [[symptoms]] but may produce side-effects.<ref>[http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/pulmonary/ild/conditions/hp/treatments.html]</ref>
