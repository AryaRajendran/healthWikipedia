[[Image:Wart ASA animated.gif|200px|thumb|right|Two viral warts on a middle finger, being treated with a mixture of acids to remove them. A white precipitation forms on the area where the product was applied.]]'''Keratolysis''' is the removal of dead surface skin cells and is a treatment for several types of [[wart]].  The most common [[keratolytic]] treatment of warts available over-the-counter involve [[salicylic acid]]. These products are readily available at most drugstores and supermarkets. There are typically two types of products: adhesive pads treated with salicylic acid, or a bottle of concentrated salicylic acid. Removing a wart with this method requires a strict regimen of cleaning the area, applying the salicylic acid, and removing the dead skin with a [[pumice stone]] or [[emery board]]. It may take up to 12 weeks to remove a stubborn wart.

==Formulations==
Some formulations are:
* alcoholic solution containing glycerol
* [[collodion]] which dries to a celluloid film / Duofilm
* simple ointment
* absorption ointment
* oil in water cream
The amount of salicylic acid reaching the wart varies substantially depending on the formulation used{{ref|Tsai1999}}. Brands in the UK include Bazuka (Dendron), Scholl (SSL International), Compound W, Cuplex gel, Duofilm (Stiefel), Occlusal (Alliance), Salatac Gel, Salactol Paint, and Verrugon (Ransom).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100003659.html|title=Bazuka extra strength gel|work=Netdoctor|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Nathan|first=Alan|title=Non-Prescription Medicines|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lW-0IoSYMBYC&pg=PA286|date=2010-06-17|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|page=286|chapter=Verrucas}}</ref>

==Molecular basis of therapeutic effect==
* Salicylic acid reaches warts; lactic acid and collodion do not{{ref|Lawson1998}}. Therefore, these additional components have only an indirect role in therapy.
* The molecular structure of the skin is altered at the centre of the wart{{ref|Lawson1998}}.
* Experiments indicated that salicylic acid bonding within the human papillomavirus-containing verruca tissue is more likely than simple acid dissociation upon dissolution in water within the tissue{{ref|Lawson1998}}.

==Complications==
Some cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been observed when using collodion formulations{{ref|Lachapelle1990}}. This was found to be due to [[rosin]] in the collodion.
