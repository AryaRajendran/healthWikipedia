'''Molecular biology''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|k|j|ʊ|l|ər}}) is the branch of biology that deals with the molecular basis of biological activity.  This field overlaps with other areas of [[biology]] and [[chemistry]], particularly [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], including the interactions between the different types of [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[protein biosynthesis]] as well as learning how these interactions are regulated. 

Writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1961, [[William Astbury]] described molecular biology as {{quote|"...not so much a technique as an approach, an approach from the viewpoint of the so-called basic sciences with the leading idea of searching below the large-scale manifestations of classical biology for the corresponding molecular plan. It is concerned particularly with the ''forms'' of biological molecules and [...] is predominantly three-dimensional and structural—which does not mean, however, that it is merely a refinement of morphology. It must at the same time inquire into genesis and function."<ref name="fn_1">{{cite journal

==Relationship to other biological sciences==

[[Image:Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology.svg|thumb|250px|''Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology'']]
Researchers in molecular biology use specific techniques native to molecular biology  but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]].  There is not a defined line between these disciplines.  The figure above is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields:

*''Biochemistry'' is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in living [[organism]]s. [[Biochemist]]s focus heavily on the role, function, and structure of [[biomolecule]]s. The study of the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of biologically active molecules are examples of [[biochemistry]].
*''Genetics'' is the study of the effect of genetic differences on organisms.   This can often be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g. one [[gene]]). The study of "[[mutant]]s" &ndash; organisms which lack one or more functional components with respect to the so-called "[[wild type]]" or normal [[phenotype]]. Genetic interactions ([[epistasis]]) can often confound simple interpretations of such "knock-out" studies.
*''Molecular biology'' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the processes of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[translation (biology)|translation]], and cell function.  The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of molecular biology, still provides a good starting point for understanding the field. This picture, however, is undergoing revision in light of emerging novel roles for [[RNA]].

Much of the work in molecular biology is quantitative, and recently much work has been done at the interface of molecular biology and computer science in [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]].  As of the early 2000s, the study of gene structure and function, [[molecular genetics]], has been among the most prominent sub-field of molecular biology.

Increasingly many other loops of biology focus on molecules, either directly studying their interactions in their own right such as in [[cell biology]] and [[developmental biology]], or indirectly, where the techniques of molecular biology are used to infer historical attributes of [[population]]s or [[species]], as in fields in [[evolution]]ary biology such as [[population genetics]] and [[phylogenetics]]. There is also a long tradition of studying [[biomolecule]]s "from the ground up" in [[biophysics]].

==Techniques of molecular biology==
Since the late 1950s and early 1960s, molecular biologists have learned to characterize, isolate, and manipulate the molecular components of cells and organisms. These components include [[DNA]], the repository of genetic information; [[RNA]], a close relative of DNA whose functions range from serving as a temporary working copy of DNA to actual structural and enzymatic functions as well as a functional and structural part of the translational apparatus; and [[protein]]s, the major structural and enzymatic type of [[molecule]] in [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.

===Expression cloning===
{{main|Expression cloning}}

One of the most basic techniques of molecular biology to study protein function is expression cloning. In this technique, DNA coding for a protein of interest is [[clone (genetics)|clone]]d (using [[PCR]] and/or [[restriction enzyme]]s) into a [[plasmid]] (known as an [[expression vector]]). A vector has 3 distinctive features: an origin of replication, a multiple cloning site (MCS), and a selective marker (usually antibiotic resistance). The origin of replication will have promoter regions upstream from the replication/transcription start site. 

This plasmid can be inserted into either bacterial or animal cells. Introducing DNA into bacterial cells can be done by [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] (via uptake of naked DNA), [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] (via cell-cell contact) or by [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] (via viral vector). Introducing DNA into [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, such as animal cells, by physical or chemical means is called [[transfection]]. Several different transfection techniques are available, such as calcium phosphate transfection, [[electroporation]], [[microinjection]] and [[liposome transfection]]. DNA can also be introduced into eukaryotic cells using viruses or bacteria as carriers, the latter is sometimes called [[bactofection]] and in particular uses ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''. The plasmid may be integrated into the genome, resulting in a stable transfection, or may remain independent of the genome, called transient transfection. 

In either case, DNA coding for a protein of interest is now inside a cell, and the protein can now be expressed. A variety of systems, such as inducible promoters and specific cell-signaling factors, are available to help express the protein of interest at high levels. Large quantities of a protein can then be extracted from the bacterial or eukaryotic cell. The protein can be tested for enzymatic activity under a variety of situations, the protein may be crystallized so its [[tertiary structure]] can be studied, or, in the pharmaceutical industry, the activity of new drugs against the protein can be studied.

===Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)===

{{main|Polymerase chain reaction}}

The [[polymerase chain reaction]] is an extremely versatile technique for copying DNA. In brief, PCR allows a single DNA sequence to be copied (millions of times), or altered in predetermined ways. For example, PCR can be used to introduce restriction enzyme sites, or to mutate (change) particular bases of DNA, the latter is a method referred to as "Quick change". PCR can also be used to determine whether a particular DNA fragment is found in a [[cDNA]] [[library (biology)|library]]. PCR has many variations, like reverse transcription PCR ([[RT-PCR]]) for amplification of RNA, and, more recently, real-time PCR ([[QPCR]]) which allow for quantitative measurement of DNA or RNA molecules.

===Gel electrophoresis===

{{main|Gel electrophoresis}}

Gel electrophoresis is one of the principal tools of molecular biology. The basic principle is that DNA, RNA, and proteins can all be separated by means of an electric field. In [[agarose gel electrophoresis]], DNA and RNA can be separated on the basis of size by running the DNA through an agarose gel. Proteins can be separated on the basis of size by using an [[SDS-PAGE]] gel, or on the basis of size and their [[electric charge]] by using what is known as a [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2D gel electrophoresis]].

===Macromolecule blotting and probing===
The terms ''northern'', ''western'' and ''eastern'' blotting are derived from what initially was a molecular biology joke that played on the term [[Southern blot|''Southern blotting'']], after the technique described by [[Edwin Southern]] for the hybridisation of blotted DNA. Patricia Thomas, developer of the RNA blot which then became known as the ''northern blot'' actually didn't use the term.<ref>{{cite journal| quotes = | last = Thomas| first = P.S.| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1980| month = | title = Hybridization of denatured RNA and small DNA fragments transferred to nitrocellulose| journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]| volume = 77| issue = 9| pages = 5201–5| publisher = | location = | issn = 1091-6490| pmid = 6159641| pmc = 350025| doi = 10.1073/pnas.77.9.5201| bibcode = | oclc =| id = | language = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}</ref> Further combinations of these techniques produced such terms as ''southwesterns'' (protein-DNA hybridizations), ''northwesterns'' (to detect protein-RNA interactions) and ''farwesterns'' (protein-protein interactions), all of which are presently found in the literature.

====Southern blotting====

{{main|Southern blot}}

Named after its inventor, biologist [[Edwin Southern]], the [[Southern blot]] is a method for probing for the presence of a specific DNA sequence within a DNA sample. DNA samples before or after [[restriction enzyme]] digestion are separated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a membrane by blotting via [[capillary action]]. The membrane is then exposed to a labeled DNA probe that has a complement base sequence to the sequence on the DNA of interest. Most original protocols used radioactive labels, however non-radioactive alternatives are now available. Southern blotting is less commonly used in laboratory science due to the capacity of other techniques, such as [[PCR]], to detect specific DNA sequences from DNA samples. These blots are still used for some applications, however, such as measuring [[transgene]] copy number in [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic mice]], or in the engineering of [[gene knockout]] [[Stem cell line|embryonic stem cell lines]].

====Northern blotting====

{{main|northern blot}}

The [[northern blot]] is used to study the expression patterns of a specific type of RNA molecule as relative comparison among a set of different samples of RNA.  It is essentially a combination of [[denaturing gel|denaturing RNA gel electrophoresis]], and a [[blot (biology)|blot]].  In this process RNA is separated based on size and is then transferred to a membrane that is then probed with a labeled [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complement]] of a sequence of interest. The results may be visualized through a variety of ways depending on the label used; however, most result in the revelation of bands representing the sizes of the RNA detected in sample.  The intensity of these bands is related to the amount of the target RNA in the samples analyzed.  The procedure is commonly used to study when and how much gene expression is occurring by measuring how much of that RNA is present in different samples.  It is one of the most basic tools for determining at what time, and under what conditions, certain genes are expressed in living tissues.

====Western blotting====

{{main|western blot}}

[[Antibodies]] to most [[protein]]s can be created by injecting small amounts of the protein into an animal such as a mouse, rabbit, sheep, or donkey ([[polyclonal antibodies]]) or produced in cell culture ([[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]]). These antibodies can be used for a variety of analytical and preparative techniques.

In [[western blot]]ting, proteins are first separated by size, in a thin gel sandwiched between two glass plates in a technique known as [[SDS-PAGE]] ([[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The proteins in the gel are then transferred to a PVDF, nitrocellulose, nylon or other support membrane. This membrane can then be probed with solutions of antibodies. Antibodies that specifically bind to the protein of interest can then be visualized by a variety of techniques, including colored products, [[chemiluminescence]], or [[autoradiography]]. Often, the antibodies are labeled with enzymes. When a [[chemiluminescent]] [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] is exposed to the [[enzyme]] it allows detection. Using western blotting techniques allows not only detection but also quantitative analysis. 

Analogous methods to western blotting can be used to directly stain specific proteins in live [[cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[biological tissue|tissue]] sections. However, these ''[[immunostaining]]'' methods, such as [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]], are used more often in [[cell biology]] research.

====Eastern blotting====

{{main|Eastern blotting}}

[[Eastern blotting]] technique is to detect [[post-translational modification]] of proteins.<ref>Thomas S, Thirumalapura N, Crossley EC, Ismail N, and Walker DH (2009). Antigenic protein modifications in ''Ehrlichia''. ''Parasite Immunology'' 31, 296-303. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121641379/abstract]</ref> Proteins blotted on to the PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane are probed for modifications using specific substrates.

===Arrays===

{{main|DNA microarray }}

A [[DNA]] array is a collection of spots attached to a solid support such as a [[microscope slide]] where each spot contains one or more single-stranded DNA [[oligonucleotide]] fragment. Arrays make it possible to put down large quantities of very small (100 micrometre diameter) spots on a single slide. Each spot has a DNA fragment molecule that is complementary to a single DNA sequence (similar to Southern blotting). A variation of this technique allows the [[gene expression]] of an organism at a particular stage in development to be qualified ([[expression profiling]]). In this technique the RNA in a tissue is isolated and converted to labeled [[cDNA]]. This cDNA is then hybridized to the fragments on the array and visualization of the hybridization can be done. Since multiple arrays can be made with exactly the same position of fragments they are particularly useful for comparing the gene expression of two different tissues, such as a healthy and cancerous tissue. Also, one can measure what genes are expressed and how that expression changes with time or with other factors. For instance, the common baker's [[yeast]], ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', contains about 7000 genes; with a microarray, one can measure qualitatively how each gene is expressed, and how that expression changes, for example, with a change in temperature. 
There are many different ways to fabricate microarrays; the most common are silicon chips, microscope slides with spots of ~ 100 micrometre diameter, custom arrays, and arrays with larger spots on porous membranes (macroarrays). There can be anywhere from 100 spots to more than 10,000 on a given array.

Arrays can also be made with molecules other than DNA. For example, an [[antibody]] array can be used to determine what [[protein]]s or [[bacteria]] are present in a blood sample.

===Allele-specific oligonucleotide===

[[Allele-specific oligonucleotide]] (ASO) is a technique that allows detection of single base mutations without the need for PCR or gel electrophoresis. Short (20-25 nucleotides in length), labeled probes are exposed to the non-fragmented target DNA. Hybridization occurs with high specificity due to the short length of the probes and even a single base change will hinder hybridization. The target DNA is then washed and the labeled probes that didn't hybridize are removed. The target DNA is then analyzed for the presence of the probe via radioactivity or fluorescence. In this experiment, as in most molecular biology techniques, a control must be used to ensure successful experimentation. The [[Illumina Methylation Assay]] is an example of a method that takes advantage of the ASO technique to measure one base pair differences in sequence.{{cn|date=June 2012}}

===Antiquated technologies===

In molecular biology, procedures and technologies are continually being developed and older technologies abandoned. For example, before the advent of DNA [[gel electrophoresis]] ([[agarose gel electrophoresis|agarose]] or [[SDS-PAGE|polyacrylamide]]), the size of DNA molecules was typically determined by rate [[sedimentation]] in [[sucrose gradient centrifugation|sucrose gradients]], a slow and labor-intensive technique requiring expensive instrumentation; prior to sucrose gradients, [[viscometry]] was used.

Aside from their historical interest, it is often worth knowing about older technology, as it is occasionally useful to solve another new problem for which the newer technique is inappropriate.

==History==
{{main|History of molecular biology}}
While molecular biology was established in the 1930s, the term was coined by [[Warren Weaver]] in 1938. Warren was the director of Natural Sciences for the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] at the time and believed that biology was about to undergo a period of significant change given recent advances in fields such as [[X-ray crystallography]].  He therefore channeled significant amounts of (Rockefeller Institute) money into biological fields.

==Clinical significance==
Clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are partly covered under [[gene therapy]] {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. The use of molecular biology or [[molecular cell biology]] approaches in medicine is now called [[molecular medicine]]. Molecular biology also plays important role in understanding formations, actions, regulations of various parts of [[Cell_(biology)|cell]]s which can be used efficiently for targeting new [[drug]]s, diagnosis of disease, physiology of Cell.
