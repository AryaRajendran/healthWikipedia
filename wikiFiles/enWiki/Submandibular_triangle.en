The '''submandibular triangle''' (or '''submaxillary ''' or '''digastric triangle''') corresponds to the region of the neck immediately beneath the body of the [[Human mandible|mandible]]. 

==Boundaries and coverings==
It is bounded:
* ''above'', by the lower border of the body of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], and a line drawn from its angle to the [[mastoid process]]; 
* ''below'', by the posterior belly of the [[Digastricus]]; in front, by the anterior belly of the [[Digastricus]]. 

It is covered by the [[integument]], [[superficial fascia]], [[Platysma]], and deep fascia, ramifying in which are branches of the [[facial nerve]] and ascending filaments of the [[cutaneous cervical nerve]]. 

Its floor is formed by the [[Mylohyoideus]].


==Triangles==
*[[Beclard Triangle]]
*[[Lesser Triangle]]
*[[Pirogoff Triangle]]

==Divisions==
It is divided into an anterior and a posterior part by the [[stylomandibular ligament]]. 

===Anterior part===
The anterior part contains the [[submandibular gland]], superficial to which is the [[anterior facial vein]], while imbedded in the gland is the [[external maxillary artery]] and its glandular branches.

Beneath the gland, on the surface of the [[Mylohyoideus]], are the [[submental artery]] and the [[mylohyoid artery]] and nerve.

===Posterior part===
The posterior part of this triangle contains the external carotid artery, ascending deeply in the substance of the [[parotid gland]]

This vessel lies here in front of, and superficial to, the internal carotid, being crossed by the [[facial nerve]], and gives off in its course the [[posterior auricular]], [[superficial temporal]], and [[internal maxillary]] branches: more deeply are the [[internal carotid]], the [[internal jugular vein]], and the [[vagus nerve]], separated from the external carotid by the [[Styloglossus]] and [[Stylopharyngeus]], and the [[hypoglossal nerve]]
