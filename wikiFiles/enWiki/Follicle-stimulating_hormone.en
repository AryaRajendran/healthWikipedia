'''Follicle-stimulating hormone''' ('''FSH''') is a [[hormone]] found in humans and other animals. It is synthesized and secreted by [[gonadotroph]]s of the [[anterior pituitary gland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Follicle-Stimulating Hormone|url=http://women.webmd.com/follicle-stimulating-hormone}}</ref>  FSH regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive processes of the body.  FSH and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) act synergistically in [[reproduction]]. Specifically, an increase in FSH secretion by the anterior pituitary causes [[ovulation]].

FSH  is a [[glycoprotein]].  Each monomeric unit is a protein molecule with a sugar attached to it; two of these make the full, functional protein.  Its structure is similar to those of [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]], [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), and [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG, a hormone produced in pregancy). The protein dimer contains 2 [[polypeptide]] units, labeled alpha and beta subunits. The [[Alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones|alpha subunits]] of LH, FSH, TSH, and hCG are identical, and contain 92 [[amino acids]]. The beta subunits vary. FSH has a beta subunit of 111 amino acids (FSH β), which confers its specific biologic action and is responsible for interaction with the [[FSH-receptor]]. The sugar part of the hormone is composed of [[fucose]], [[galactose]], [[mannose]], [[galactosamine]], [[glucosamine]], and [[sialic acid]], the latter being critical  for its biologic [[half-life]]. The half-life of FSH is 3–4 hours.

==Genes==

The gene for the [[Alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones|alpha subunit]] is located on chromosome 6p21.1-23. It is expressed in different cell types. The gene for the FSH beta subunit is located on chromosome  11p13, and is expressed in gonadotropes of the pituitary cells, controlled by [[GnRH]], inhibited by [[inhibin]], and enhanced by [[activin]].

==Activity==

FSH regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive processes of the human body. 

* In both ''males'' and ''females'', FSH stimulates the maturation of [[germ cells]].
* In ''males'', FSH induces [[Sertoli cells]] to secrete [[inhibin]] and stimulates the formation of sertoli-sertoli tight junctions ([[zonula occludens]]).
* In ''females'', FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting granulosa cells. With the concomitant rise in inhibin B, FSH levels then decline in the late follicular phase. This seems to be critical in selecting only the most advanced follicle to proceed to ovulation. At the end of the luteal phase, there is a slight rise in FSH that seems to be of importance to start the next ovulatory cycle.

Like its partner [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]], FSH release at the pituitary gland is controlled by pulses of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH). Those pulses, in turn, are subject to the oestrogen feed-back from the gonads.

===Effects in females===

FSH stimulates the growth and recruitment of immature [[ovarian follicle]]s in the [[ovary]]. In early (small) antral follicles, FSH is the major survival factor that rescues the small antral follicles (2–5&nbsp;mm in diameter for humans) from [[apoptosis]] (programmed death of the somatic cells of the follicle and oocyte). In the luteal-follicle phase transition period the serum levels of progesterone and estrogen (primarily estradiol) decrease and no longer suppress the release of FSH, consequently FSH peaks at about day three (day one is the first day of menstrual flow). The cohort of small antral follicles is normally sufficiently in number to produce enough [[Inhibin]] B to lower FSH serum levels.

In addition, there is evidence that gonadotrophin surge-attenuating factor produced by small follicles during the first half of the follicle phase also exerts a negative feedback on pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion amplitude, thus allowing a more favorable environment for follicle growth and preventing premature luteinization.<ref name="pmid14748688">{{cite journal | author = Fowler PA, Sorsa-Leslie T, Harris W, Mason HD | title = Ovarian gonadotrophin surge-attenuating factor (GnSAF): where are we after 20 years of research? | journal = Reproduction | volume = 126 | issue = 6 | pages = 689–99 | year = 2003 | month = December | pmid = 14748688 | doi = 10.1530/rep.0.1260689| url =  }}</ref>

(As a woman nears perimenopause, the number of small antral follicles recruited in each cycle diminishes and consequently insufficient Inhibin B is produced to fully lower FSH and the serum level of FSH begins to rise.  Eventually the FSH level becomes so high that [[downregulation]] of FSH receptors occurs and by menopause any remaining small secondary follicles no longer have FSH receptors.)

When the follicle matures and reaches 8–10&nbsp;mm in diameter it starts to secrete significant amounts of [[estradiol]].  Normally in humans only one follicle becomes dominant and survives to grow to 18–30&nbsp;mm in size and ovulate, the remaining follicles in the cohort undergo atresia.  The sharp increase in estradiol production by the dominant follicle (possibly along with a decrease in gonadotrophin surge-attenuating factor) cause a positive effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary and rapid GnRH pulses occur and an LH surge results.

The increase in serum [[estradiol]] levels cause a decrease in FSH production by inhibiting GnRH production in the hypothalamus.<ref name="isbn0-07-147899-X">{{cite book | author = Dickerson LM, Shrader SP, Diaz VA | authorlink = | editor =  Wells BG, DiPiro JT, Talbert RL, Yee GC, Matzke GR | others = | title = Pharmacotherapy: a pathophysiologic approach | edition = | language = | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = | year = 2008 | chapter = Chapter 8: Contraception | pages = 1313–28 | quote = | isbn = 0-07-147899-X | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

The decrease in serum FSH level causes the smaller follicles in the current cohort to undergo atresia as they lack sufficient sensitivity to FSH to survive.  Occasionally two follicles reach the 10&nbsp;mm stage at the same time by chance and as both are equally sensitive to FSH both survive and grow in the low FSH environment and thus two ovulations can occur in one cycle possibly leading to non identical ([[dizygotic]]) twins.

===Effects in males===
FSH stimulates primary [[spermatocytes]] to undergo the first division of [[meiosis]], to form secondary spermatocytes.

FSH enhances the production of [[androgen-binding protein]] by the [[Sertoli cell]]s of the [[testes]] by binding to [[FSH receptor]]s on their [[basolateral]] membranes,<ref name="isbn1-4160-2328-3">{{cite book | author = Boulpaep EL, Boron WF | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Medical physiology: a cellular and molecular approach | edition = | language = | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = 1125 | quote = | isbn = 1-4160-2328-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> and is critical for the initiation of [[spermatogenesis]].

==Measurement==

Follicle stimulating hormone is typically measured in the early [[follicular phase]] of the menstrual cycle, typically day three to five, counted from last menstruation. At this time, the levels of estradiol (E2) and progesterone are at the lowest point of the [[menstrual cycle]]. FSH levels in this time is often called ''basal FSH'' levels, to distinguish from the increased levels when approaching ovulation.

==Disease states==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}

FSH levels are normally low during [[childhood]] and, in females, high after [[menopause]].

===High FSH levels===

The most common reason for high serum FSH concentration is in a female who is undergoing or has recently undergone [[menopause]]. High levels of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone indicate that the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to an unrestricted pituitary FSH production.

If high FSH levels occur during the reproductive years, it is abnormal.  Conditions with high FSH levels include:

# [[Premature menopause]] also known as Premature Ovarian Failure
# [[Poor ovarian reserve]] also known as Premature Ovarian Aging
# [[Gonadal dysgenesis]], [[Turner syndrome]]
# [[Castration]]
# [[Swyer syndrome]]
# Certain forms of [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|CAH]]
# Testicular failure.
# [[Klinefelter syndrome]]

Most of these conditions are associated with subfertility and/or infertility. Therefore high FSH levels are an indication of subfertility and/or infertility.

===Low FSH levels===

Diminished secretion of FSH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifested in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, cessation of reproductive cycles is commonly observed.
Conditions with very low FSH secretions are:
# [[Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome]]
# [[Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome]] + Obesity + Hirsutism + Infertility
# [[Kallmann syndrome]]
# [[Hypothalamic suppression]]
# [[Hypopituitarism]]
# [[Hyperprolactinemia]]
# [[Gonadotropin deficiency]]
# Gonadal suppression therapy
##[[GnRH antagonist]]
##[[GnRH agonist]] ([[downregulation]]).

==Availability==

FSH is available mixed with LH activity in various [[menotropins]] including more purified forms of urinary [[gonadotropins]] such as [[Menopur]], as well as without LH activity as recombinant FSH (Gonal F, Follistim, Follitropin alpha). It is used commonly in infertility therapy to stimulate follicular development, notably in [[IVF]] therapy, as well as with interuterine insemination (IUI).  (See [[Gonadotropin Preparations]].)

==Potential role in vascularization of solid tumors ==

Elevated FSH receptor levels have been detected in the endothelia of tumor vasculature in a very wide range of solid tumors.  FSH binding is thought to upregulate neovascularization via at least two mechanisms - one in the [[VEGF]] pathway, and the other VEGF independent - related to the development of umbilical vasculature when physiological. This presents possible use of FSH and FSH-receptor antagonists as an anti tumor angiogenesis therapy (cf. [[avastin]] for current anti-VEGF approaches).<ref name="pmid20961245">{{cite journal | author = Radu A, Pichon C, Camparo P, Antoine M, Allory Y, Couvelard A, Fromont G, Hai MT, Ghinea N | title = Expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor in tumor blood vessels | journal = N.
