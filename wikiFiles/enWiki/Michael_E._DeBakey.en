==Early life==
Michael Ellis DeBakey was born as '''Michel Dabaghi'''<ref>{{Cite news| title = Michael DeBakey: Cardiovascular surgeon whose innovations revolutionised the treatment of heart patients | work = [[The Independent]]| date = 2008-07-14 | author = Caroline Richmond | accessdate = 2010-01-23 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael-debakey-cardiovascular-surgeon-whose-innovations-revolutionised-the-treatment-of-heart-patients-866902.html | location=London}}</ref> in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]],<ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/13/MN9511OCVP.DTL |title=Michael DeBakey - cardiac surgery pioneer who saved thousands in his 70-year career |date=July 13, 2008 |accessdate=January 22, 2010 |author=Patricia Sullivan}}</ref> [[Louisiana]], to [[Lebanese American|Lebanese]] immigrants Shaker and Raheeja Dabaghi (later [[Anglicized]] to DeBakey).

==Medical career==
DeBakey received his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] degree from [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. In 1932, he received an M.D. degree from [[Tulane University School of Medicine]]. He remained in New Orleans to complete his internship and residency in surgery at [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]]. DeBakey completed his surgical fellowships at the [[University of Strasbourg]], France, under Professor [[René Leriche]], and at the [[University of Heidelberg]], Germany, under Professor [[Martin Kirschner]]. Returning to Tulane Medical School, he served on the surgical faculty from 1937 to 1948. From 1942 to 1946, he was on military leave as a member of the Surgical Consultants' Division in the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army, and in 1945 he became its Director and received the [[Legion of Merit]]. DeBakey helped develop the [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]] (MASH) units and later helped establish the Veteran's Administration Medical Center Research System. He joined the faculty of Baylor University College of Medicine (now known as the [[Baylor College of Medicine]]) in 1948, serving as Chairman of the Department of Surgery until 1993. DeBakey was president of the college from 1969 to 1979, served as Chancellor from 1979 to January 1996; he was then named Chancellor Emeritus. He was also Olga Keith Wiess and Distinguished Service Professor in the Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery at [[Baylor College of Medicine]] and Director of the DeBakey Heart Center for research and public education at Baylor College of Medicine and [[The Methodist Hospital]].

DeBakey's ability to bring his professional knowledge to bear on public policy earned him a reputation as a medical statesman. He was a member of the medical advisory committee of the [[Hoover Commission]] and was chairman of the President's Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke during the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson Administration]]. He worked in numerous capacities to improve national and international standards of health care. Among his numerous consultative appointments was a three-year membership on the National Advisory Heart and Lung Council of the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref>[http://www.debakeydepartmentofsurgery.org/home/content.cfm?content_id=287 Michael E. DeBakey, M.D. on debakeydepartmentofsurgery.com]</ref>

DeBakey served in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War II]] and helped to revolutionize wartime medicine by supporting the stationing of doctors closer to the front lines. This concept greatly improved the survival rate of wounded soldiers and resulted in the development of [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]] (MASH) units during the [[Korean War]].<ref name="NYTArmy">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/health/13debakey.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=Michael DeBakey, Rebuilder of Hearts, Dies at 99|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|date=2008-07-13|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref><ref name="DoDStarts">{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.mil/InspirationRoom/MedicalPioneers.aspx?id=71|title=Dr. Michael DeBakey|work=They Got Their Start In Military Medicine|publisher=Department of Defense Military Health System|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}

==Medical pioneer==
At age 23, while still in medical school at Tulane University, DeBakey developed the [[Peristaltic pump|roller pump]], the significance of which was not realized until 20 years later when it became an essential component of the [[heart-lung machine]].<ref name='Baylor-1'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcm.edu/news/packages/medinnovations.cfm |title=DeBakey Surgical Innovations |accessdate=2008-07-12 |publisher=[[Baylor College of Medicine]] }}</ref> The pump provided a continuous flow of blood during operations. This, in turn, made [[open-heart surgery]] possible.
[[File:Michael E. DeBakey.jpeg|thumb|Heart Surgeon Michael E. DeBakey]]
With his mentor, [[Alton Ochsner]], he postulated in 1939 a strong link between smoking and [[carcinoma]] of the lung. DeBakey was one of the first to perform [[coronary artery bypass surgery]], and in 1953 he performed the first successful [[carotid endarterectomy]]. A pioneer in the development of an [[artificial heart]], DeBakey was the first to use an external heart pump successfully in a patient&nbsp;&ndash; a [[left ventricular bypass pump]].

DeBakey pioneered the use of [[Dacron]] grafts to replace or repair blood vessels. In 1958, to counteract narrowing of an artery caused by an [[endarterectomy]], DeBakey performed the first successful patch-graft [[angioplasty]]. This procedure involved patching the slit in the artery from an endarterectomy with a Dacron or vein graft. The patch widened the artery so that when it closed, the channel of the artery returned to normal size. The DeBakey artificial graft is now used around the world to replace or repair blood vessels.

In the 1960s, DeBakey and his team of surgeons were among the first to record surgeries on film. A camera operator would lie prone atop a surgical film stand made to DeBakey's specifications and record a surgeon's eye view of the operating area. The camera and lights were positioned within three to four feet of the operative field, yet did not interfere with the surgical team.<ref name='Baylor-1'/>
DeBakey worked together with [[Denton Cooley]] while they both practiced at Baylor College of Medicine. According to the April 10, 1970, issue of ''Life'' magazine, they had a disagreement associated with Cooley's apparently unauthorized implantation of the first [[artificial heart]] in a human. DeBakey had set the surgery for Friday, April 4, 1969, and because of a schedule conflict relating to a speech in Corpus Christi, Texas, rescheduled it for the following Monday. Cooley then rescheduled back to the original date and performed the surgery while DeBakey was out of town. The press covered the surgery and Cooley gained much publicity. DeBakey was angry at Cooley for his actions. Cooley then left Methodist Hospital and signed on with [[St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital]] across the street. Their disagreement turned into a bitter feud that lasted for decades;<ref name="time">{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844760,00.html |title=An Act of Desperation |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1969-04-18 |accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> the two men reconciled in 2007,<ref>{{Cite news|work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/27/health/27docs.html |date=2007-11-27 |title=The Feud | first1=Lawrence K. | last1=Altman | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> but DeBakey made it public by inviting Cooley to his [[Congressional Gold Medal]] ceremony.<ref name="rtk"/> On May 2, 2008, DeBakey inducted Cooley into the Michael E. DeBakey International Surgical Society, presenting him with a leather-bound copy of the first medical article the two co-authored and a lifetime achievement award.<ref>[http://www.bcm.edu/news/item.cfm?newsID=1122]</ref>

To the amazement of his colleagues and patients,{{Who|date=January 2011}} DeBakey continued to practice medicine into an age well after most others have retired. DeBakey practiced medicine until the day he died, and nearly reached 100 years of age in 2008. His contributions to the field of medicine spanned the better part of 75 years. DeBakey operated on more than 50,000 patients, including several heads of state.<ref>Michael DeBakey, pioneer of heart procedures, dead at 99, http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/07/12/debakey.obit.ap/index.html, AP, July 12, 2008</ref> DeBakey and a team of American cardiothoracic surgeons, including George Noon, supervised quintuple bypass surgery performed  by Russian surgeons on [[Russia]]n President [[Boris Yeltsin]] in 1996.<ref name=nyt>{{Cite news|title=The Man on the Table Was 97, but He Devised the Surgery |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/25/health/25surgeon.html?pagewanted=3&ei=5094&en=e9f039dd9b8b2d74&hp&ex=1167109200&partner=homepage |date=2006-12-25 |last=Altman |first=Lawrence K. |accessdate=2006-12-25 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

[[File:2007 Michael DeBakey Congressional Gold Medal front.jpg|thumb|170px|The Congressional Gold Medal awarded to DeBakey]]

In 1969, the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] separated from Baylor University under his direction. The [[DeBakey High School for Health Professions]], the Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center and the [[Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston]] at the [[Texas Medical Center]] in [[Houston]] are named after him. He had a role in establishing the Michael E. DeBakey Heart Institute at the Hays Medical Center in Kansas. Several atraumatic vascular surgical clamps and forceps that he introduced also bear his name. DeBakey founded the Michael E. DeBakey Institute at [[Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences]] as a collaboration between [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]], the Baylor College of Medicine and the [[UT Health Science Center at Houston]] to further cardiovascular research.

DeBakey received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1969 even though his name was later found on [[Master list of Nixon political opponents|Nixon's Enemies List]]. In 1987, President [[Ronald Reagan]] awarded him the [[National Medal of Science]].<ref>[http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=100 National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science]</ref> He was a Health Care Hall of Famer, a Lasker Luminary, and a recipient of The United Nations Lifetime Achievement Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction. He was given the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Foundation for Biomedical Research and in 2000 was cited as a "Living Legend" by the Library of Congress. On April 23, 2008, he received the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] from President [[George W. Bush]], Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]], and Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]].<ref name="rtk">{{Cite news|title=Heart surgeon DeBakey receives high honor |url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&id=6098224 |work=KTRK |date=2008-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5724100.html |work=Houston Chronicle |title=Houston's DeBakey gets congressional medal in D.C.}}</ref><ref>[http://www.senate.gov/~hutchison/pr100207a.html Sen.

==Health issues==
On December 31, 2005, at age 97, DeBakey suffered an [[aortic dissection]]. Years prior, DeBakey had pioneered the surgical treatment of this condition, creating what is now known as the ''DeBakey Procedure''.<ref name="hc"/> He was hospitalized at [[The Methodist Hospital]] in Houston, Texas.

DeBakey initially resisted the surgical option, but as his health deteriorated and DeBakey became unresponsive, the surgical team opted to proceed with surgical intervention. In a controversial decision, Houston Methodist Hospital [[Ethics]] Committee approved the operation; on February 9&ndash;10, he became the oldest patient ever to undergo the surgery for which he was responsible. The operation lasted seven hours. After a complicated post-operative course that required eight months in the hospital at a cost of over one million dollars, DeBakey was released in September 2006 and returned to good health.<ref name=nyt/> Although DeBakey had previously refused surgery, he later stated that he was grateful that his surgical team performed the operation.

He was present at Baylor College of Medicine for the groundbreaking of the new Michael E. DeBakey Library and Museum on October 18, 2006.

===Death===

==Views on animal research==
DeBakey founded and chaired the [[Foundation for Biomedical Research]] (FBR), whose goal is to promote public understanding and support for animal research. DeBakey made wide use of animals in his research.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lefrak|first=EA|coauthors=Stevens, PM, Nicotra, MB, Viroslav, J, Noon, GP, DeBakey, ME|title=An experimental model for evaluating extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support in acute respiratory failure.|journal=The American surgeon|date=1973 Jan|year=1973|month=January|volume=39|issue=1|pages=20–30|doi=10.1016/0002-9149(71)90077-4|pmid=4686133}}</ref> He antagonized [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] advocates who oppose the use of animals in the development of medical treatment for humans when he claimed that the “future of biomedical research; and ultimately human health” would be compromised if shelters stopped turning over surplus animals for medical research.<ref>[http://www.banpoundseizure.org/ps2.pdf  Pound Seizure When Will it End?]</ref> Responding to the need for animal research, DeBakey stated that "These scientists, veterinarians, physicians, surgeons and others who do research in animal labs are as much concerned about the care of the animals as anyone can be. Their respect for the dignity of life and compassion for the sick and disabled, in fact, is what motivated them to search for ways of relieving the pain and suffering caused by diseases."<ref>[http://www.mofed.org/Animal_Research.htm Animal-test research has saved many human lives]</ref>
