'''Cardiovascular surgery''' is [[surgery]] on the [[heart]] or [[great vessels]] performed by cardiac [[surgeon]]s. Frequently, it is done to treat complications of [[ischemic heart disease]] (for example, [[coronary artery bypass grafting]]), correct [[congenital heart disease]], or treat [[valvular heart disease]] from various causes including [[endocarditis]], [[Rheumatic fever|rheumatic heart disease]] and [[atherosclerosis]]. It also includes [[heart transplantation]].

==History==
The earliest operations on the [[pericardium]] (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by [[Francisco Romero (surgeon)|Francisco Romero]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aris A |title=Francisco Romero, the first heart surgeon |journal=Ann.

The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the [[post mortem]] proved to be [[mediastinitis]] on the third postoperative day.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephen |last1=Westaby |first2=Cecil |last2=Bosher |title=Landmarks in Cardiac Surgery |isbn=1-899066-54-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Baksaas ST, Solberg　S |title=Verdens første hjerteoperasjon |journal=Tidsskr Nor Lægeforen |volume=123 |issue=2 |pages=202–4 |date=January 2003 |url=http://www.tidsskriftet.no/?seks_id=659174}}</ref> The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. [[Ludwig Rehn]] of [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], who repaired a stab wound to the right [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] on September 7, 1896.<ref>Absolon KB, Naficy MA (2002).

Surgery in [[great vessels]] ([[aortic coarctation]] repair, [[Blalock-Taussig]] shunt creation, closure of [[patent ductus arteriosus]]), became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery, but technically cannot be considered heart surgery.

===Early approaches to heart malformations===
In 1925 operations on the [[heart valve]]s were unknown. [[Henry Souttar]] operated successfully on a young woman with [[mitral stenosis]]. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several years<ref>[[Dictionary of National Biography]] – Henry Souttar (2004–08)</ref> but Souttar’s physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue.<ref name=Ellis/><ref name=cohn>Lawrence H Cohn (2007), Cardiac Surgery in the Adult, page 6+</ref>

Cardiac surgery changed significantly after [[World War II]]. In 1948 four surgeons carried out successful operations for [[mitral stenosis]] resulting from [[rheumatic fever]]. [[Horace Smithy]] (1914–1948) of [[Charlotte]], revived an operation due to Dr [[Dwight Harken]] of the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital|Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] using a punch to remove a portion of the [[mitral valve]]. [[Charles P. Bailey|Charles Bailey]] (1910–1993) at the [[Hahnemann Hospital]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Dwight Harken]] in [[Boston]] and [[Russell Brock]] at [[Guy's Hospital|Guy’s Hospital]] all adopted Souttar’s method. All these men started work independently of each other, within a few months. This time Souttar’s technique was widely adopted although there were modifications.<ref name=Ellis/><ref name=cohn/>

In 1947 [[Thomas Holmes Sellors]] (1902–1987) of the [[Middlesex Hospital]] operated on a [[Fallot tetralogy|Fallot’s Tetralogy]] patient with [[pulmonary stenosis]] and successfully divided the stenosed [[pulmonary valve]]. In 1948, [[Russell Brock]], probably unaware of Sellor’s work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of [[pulmonary stenosis]]. Later in 1948 he designed a punch to resect the [[Conus arteriosus|infundibular muscle]] [[stenosis]] which is often associated with [[Fallot tetralogy|Fallot’s Tetralogy]]. Many thousands of these “blind” operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible.<ref name=Ellis>Harold Ellis (2000) A History of Surgery, page 223+</ref>

===Open heart surgery===
Open heart surgery is a surgery in which the patient's heart is open and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. It was soon discovered by Dr. [[Wilfred G. Bigelow]] of the [[University of Toronto]] that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment, which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood. The first successful intracardiac correction of a [[congenital heart defect]] using [[hypothermia]] was performed by Dr. [[C. Walton Lillehei]] and Dr. [[F. John Lewis]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] on September 2, 1952. The following year, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] surgeon [[Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vishnevskiy]] conducted the first cardiac surgery under [[local anesthesia]]. During this surgery, the heart is exposed and the patient's blood is made to bypass it.

Surgeons realized the limitations of [[hypothermia]]– complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body, particularly to the [[brain]]. The patient needs the function of the heart and [[lung]]s provided by an artificial method, hence the term [[cardiopulmonary bypass]]. Dr. [[John Heysham Gibbon]] at Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an [[oxygenator]], but he abandoned the method, disappointed by subsequent failures. In 1954 Dr. Lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique in which the patient's mother or father was used as a '[[heart-lung machine]]'. Dr. [[John W. Kirklin]] at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Rochester, Minnesota started using a Gibbon type pump-oxygenator in a series of successful operations, and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world.

[[Nazih Zuhdi]] performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on February 25, 1960, at Mercy Hospital, Oklahoma City, OK. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later in 1963.<ref>Warren, Cliff, Dr. Nazih Zuhdi – His Scientific Work Made All Paths Lead to Oklahoma City, in Distinctly Oklahoma, November, 2007, p. 30–33</ref> In March, 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer, performed open heart surgery on a child, age 3½, using the total intentional hemodilution machine. In 1985 Dr. Zuhdi performed Oklahoma's first successful heart transplant on Nancy Rogers at Baptist Hospital. The transplant was successful, but Rogers, a [[cancer]] sufferer, died from an infection 54 days after surgery.<ref>http://ndepth.newsok.com/zuhdi Dr. Nazih Zuhdi, the Legendary Heart Surgeon, The Oklahoman, Jan 2010</ref>

===Modern beating-heart surgery===
Since the 1990s, surgeons have begun to perform "[[OPCAB|off-pump bypass surgery]]" – coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned [[cardiopulmonary bypass]]. In these operations, the heart is beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage; in the U.S., most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as [[endoscopic vessel harvesting]] (EVH).

Some researchers believe that the off-pump approach results in fewer post-operative complications, such as [[postperfusion syndrome]], and better overall results. Study results are controversial as of 2007, the surgeon's preference and hospital results still play a major role.

===Minimally invasive surgery===
A new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is [[robot-assisted heart surgery]]. This is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient. Instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside, it does not have to be bigger than 3 small holes for the robot's much smaller hands to get through.

===Pediatric cardiovascular surgery===
Pediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children. [[Russell M. Nelson]] performed the first successful pediatric cardiac operation at the [[Salt Lake General Hospital]] in March 1956, a total repair of [[tetralogy of Fallot]] in a four-year-old girl.<ref>"[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007363.htm Pediatric heart surgery]" in [[MedlinePlus]]</ref>

==Risks==
The development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4–6% mortality rates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stark J, Gallivan S, Lovegrove J, ''et al.'' |title=Mortality rates after surgery for congenital heart defects in children and surgeons' performance |journal=Lancet |volume=355 |issue=9208 |pages=1004–7 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10768449 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673600900011 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)90001-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Klitzner TS, Lee M, Rodriguez S, Chang RK |title=Sex-related disparity in surgical mortality among pediatric patients |journal=Congenit Heart Dis |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=77–88 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=18377550 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-0803.2006.00013.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-0803.2006.00013.x/abstract}}</ref> A major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of [[neurological]] damage. [[Stroke]] occurs in 2–3% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and is higher in patients at risk for stroke. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A more subtle constellation of [[neurocognitive deficit]]s attributed to [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] is known as [[postperfusion syndrome]], sometimes called "pumphead". The symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent,<ref name="Newman">{{cite journal | author = Newman M, Kirchner J, Phillips-Bute B, Gaver V, Grocott H, Jones R, Mark D, Reves J, Blumenthal J | title = Longitudinal assessment of neurocognitive function after coronary-artery bypass surgery | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 344 | issue = 6 | pages = 395–402 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11172175 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200102083440601}}</ref> but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment.<ref name="VanDijk">{{cite journal | author = Van Dijk D, Jansen E, Hijman R, Nierich A, Diephuis J, Moons K, Lahpor J, Borst C, Keizer A, Nathoe H, Grobbee D, De Jaegere P, Kalkman C | title = Cognitive outcome after off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a randomized trial | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 11 | pages = 1405–12 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11903027 | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.11.1405}}</ref>

In order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the [[EuroSCORE]].  This takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge.  Within the UK this EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for [[cardiothoracic surgery]] and to give some indication of whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range.   The results are available on the CQC website.<ref>http://heartsurgery.cqc.org.uk/ CQC website for heart surgery outcomes in the UK for 3 years ending March 2009</ref>
