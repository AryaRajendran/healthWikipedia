'''Emergency tourniquets''' are cuff-like devices designed to stop severe traumatic [[bleeding]] before or during transport to a care facility. They are wrapped around the limb, [[proximal]] to the site of [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], and tightened until all [[blood vessel]]s underneath are occluded. The design and construction of emergency tourniquets allows quick application by [[first aid]] responders or the injured persons themselves.<ref name=Walters2005>{{cite journal |last1=Walters |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Wenke |first2=Joseph C. |last3=Kauvar |first3=David S. |year=2005 |title=Effectiveness of Self-Applied Tourniquets in Human Volunteers |journal=Prehospital Emergency Care |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=416–22 |publisher=Informa Healthcare |doi=10.1080/10903120500255123}}</ref> Correct use of tourniquet devices have been shown to save lives under austere conditions with comparatively low risk of injury.

==Tourniquet design==
[[Image:Improvised tourniquet.jpg|right|thumb|Improvised tourniquet on an accidentally severed finger]]

Existing guidelines call for the use of improvised "rope-and-stick" tourniquets as a last resort to stop severe bleeding. However, purpose-made tourniquet devices that are well designed can provide greatly increased safety and efficacy.<ref name=Kragh2008/><ref name=Kragh2011>{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=John F. |last2=O'Neill |first2=Michelle L. |last3=Walters |first3=Thomas J. |year=2011 |title=The Military Emergency Tourniquet Program's Lessons Learned With Devices and Designs |journal=Military Medicine |volume=176 |issue=10 |pages=1144–52 |publisher=Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.}}</ref> Variability in performance has been shown to exist between various designs and application methods.<ref name=Ruterbusch>{{cite journal  |author=Ruterbusch, VL; Swiergosz, MJ; Montgomery, LD; Hopper, KW; Gerth, WA |title=ONR/MARCORSYSCOM Evaluation of Self-Applied Tourniquets for Combat Applications |journal=[[United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit]] Technical Report |volume=NEDU-TR-05-15 |year=2005 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3476 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}</ref><ref name=Hill>{{cite journal  |author=Hill, JP; Montgomery, LD; Hopper, KW; Roy, LA |title=Evaluation of Self-Applied Tourniquets for Combat Applications, Second Phase. |journal=US Navy Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=NEDU-TR-07-07 |year=2007 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6870 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}</ref>

===Mechanical advantage===
Mechanisms that confer sufficient [[mechanical advantage]] are essential for applying adequate pressure to stop bleeding, particularly on the lower extremities. Pressures that occlude [[venous]] but not [[arterial]] flow can exacerbate [[hemorrhage]] and cause damage to healthy tissue.<ref name=Walters2005/>

Results from laboratory and field testing suggest that [[windlass]] and [[pneumatic]] mechanisms are effective where other systems fail due to excessive pain, slipping, inadequate force, or mechanical failure.<ref name=Walters2005/><ref name=Kragh2008/>

===Pressure gradients===
Pressure underneath a tourniquet cuff is not evenly distributed, with the highest pressures localized around the cuff centerline and decreasing to zero near the cuff edges.<ref name=Noordin2009>{{cite journal |last1=Noordin |first1=Shahryar |last2=McEwen |first2=James A. |last3=Kragh |first3=John F. |year=2009 |title=Current Concepts Review: Surgical Tourniquets in Orthopaedics |journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |volume=91 |issue=12 |pages=2958–67 |publisher=JBJS |issn=0021-9355 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.I.00634}}</ref> A high rate of change of pressure across the cuff width, or a high cuff pressure [[slope|gradient]], is a leading cause of nerve and muscle injury from tourniquet use.<ref name=Noordin2009/> Tourniquets with wider straps or cuffs, especially those with pneumatic actuation in contrast to mechanical force, distribute pressure more evenly and produce lower pressure gradients.<ref name=Noordin2009/> They are therefore more likely to stop bleeding and less likely to cause damage to underlying tissue, in addition to being significantly less painful than tourniquets with narrow straps and bands.<ref name=Kragh2011/><ref name=Taylor2011>{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=David M. |last2=Vater |first2=Gill M. |last3=Parker |first3=Paul J. |year=2011 |title=An Evaluation of Two Tourniquet Systems for the Control of Prehospital Lower Limb Hemorrhage |journal=The Journal of Trauma |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=591–5 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e31820e0e41}}</ref> Overpressure protection in certain emergency tourniquets also help to prevent excessive force from damaging the limb.<ref name=Walters2005/>

==Risks==
[[Image:Tourniquet application.jpg|right|thumb|Emergency tourniquet being applied in simulated combat. Military devices are designed for rugged environments.]]

Possible risks of complications - or [[morbidity]] - related to emergency tourniquet use include 
{|
|-
|
* [[amputation]] or stump shortening,
* [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]],
* [[myonecrosis]],
* pain,
* clot,
* [[fasciotomy]],
* acute [[renal failure]],
* [[rigor]],
* [[absess]],
* [[blisters]],
* [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]]s,
* [[contusions]],
* and pinching.<ref name=Kragh2008/>
|}

Emergency care services implementing routine tourniquet use, especially in the civilian setting, should exercise caution and ensure that training is adequate for optimal results.<ref name=Kragh2009a/> However, given proper precautions, the occurrence of complications due to tourniquet use is quite rare.<ref name=Kragh2009b>{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=John F. |last2=Littrel |first2=Michelle L. |last3=Walters |first3=Thomas J. |year=2009 |title=Battle Casualty Survival with Emergency Tourniquet Use to Stop Limb Bleeding |journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=XX |issue=2 |pages=S38-S50 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2009.07.022}}</ref> Designed tourniquet devices are routinely tightened over healthy limbs during training with no ill effects, and recent evidence from combat hospitals in Iraq suggests that morbidity rates are low when users adhere to standard best practices. Since no better alternatives exist for users to self-apply with only basic training, the benefit of tourniquet use far outweighs the risks.<ref name=Kragh2008/><ref name=Kragh2009a/><ref name=Kragh2009b/> 

Safe tourniquet practice involves
{|
|-
|
* careful placement of tourniquet proximal to all sites of hemorrhage,
* limiting tourniquet time to less than two hours, if possible,
* and minimizing applied pressure while stopping blood flow.<ref name=Kragh2008/><ref name=Kragh2009b/>

==Current developments==

Device user knowledge greatly increases survival rate and minimizes complications.]]

=== Field experience ===
Latest field trials suggest that wider straps are more effective and less painful than tourniquets with thinner straps. The concept of [[Tourniquet#Limb_occlusion_pressure|limb occlusion pressure]] is also gaining prominence over the misconception that greater applied force results in greater effectiveness. In addition, studies of failed cases indicate that the correct devices should be coupled with training that facilitates realistic expectations and correct user actions.<ref name=Kragh2011/>

=== Emerging needs ===
Despite the success of widespread tourniquet deployment to limit combat casualties, many preventable deaths from hemorrhage occur where conventional tourniquet use is inappropriate. The need exists for controlling junctional bleeding, especially in the [[human pelvis|pelvic]] area.<ref name=Murphy2011>{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=Chris |last2=Kragh |first2=John F. |last3=Dubick |first3=Michael A. |year=2011 |title=New Tourniquet Device Concepts for Battlefield Hemorrhage Control |journal=U.S. Army Medical Department Journal |pages=38–48 |issn=1524-0436}}</ref> In 2012, the Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC) was selected by the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) for that purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/72172/New_truncal_tourniquet_ready_for_battlefield_use/|title=New truncal tourniquet ready for battle use}}</ref> Another emerging need is more refined training regimes and doctrine based on scientific evidence, which can ensure that future tourniquet practice and policies are in line with the most current body of knowledge.<ref name=Murphy2011/>
