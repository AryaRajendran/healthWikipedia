[[Image:Hyperplasia vs Hypertrophy.svg|thumb|right|200px|Hypertrophy results from an increase in cell ''size'', while [[hyperplasia]] is from an increase in cell [[number]].]]'''Hypertrophy''' (from Greek ὑπέρ "excess" + τροφή "nourishment") is the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. It should be distinguished from [[hyperplasia]], in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number. Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together, such as in the case of the [[hormone|hormonally]]-induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the [[uterus]] during [[pregnancy]].

==Examples of hypertrophy==
===Muscular hypertrophy===
{{Main|Muscle hypertrophy}}
One of the two most common and visible forms of organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to [[strength training]] (known as [[muscle hypertrophy]]).  Depending on the type of training, the hypertrophy can occur through increased [[sarcoplasm]]ic volume or increased [[Sliding filament mechanism|contractile proteins]].

===Ventricular hypertrophy===<!-- This section is linked from [[Physical exercise]] -->
{{Main|Ventricular hypertrophy}}
[[Ventricular hypertrophy]] is the increase in size of the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] of the [[heart]].  Changes can be beneficial or healthy if they occur in response to [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic exercise]], but ventricular hypertrophy is generally associated with pathological changes due to [[high blood pressure]] or other disease states.

===Hypertrophy of the breasts===
{{Main|Gigantomastia}}
[[Gigantomastia]] is the extreme growth of the breasts, i.e. 10 pounds (5&nbsp;kg) per breast and more. In severe cases it is possible for women to have breasts that weigh well in excess of 20&nbsp;lb (9&nbsp;kg) each. Gigantomastia can occur as a rare complication of [[pregnancy]], but also with the more frequently juvenile gigantomastia during [[puberty]] ([[virginal breast hypertrophy]]).

===Hypertrophy of the clitoris===
{{Main|Clitoromegaly}}
In the most pronounced cases, clitoromegaly is a symptom of intersexuality since the large clitoris resembles a penis (the different grade of genital ambiguity is commonly measured by the Prader classification ranging, in ascending order of masculinisation, from 1: Female external genitalia with clitoromegaly through 5: Pseudo-phallus looking like normal male external genitalia).
