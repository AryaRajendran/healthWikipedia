'''Nodding disease''' or '''nodding syndrome''' is a recent, little-known disease which [[Emerging infectious disease|emerged]] in [[Sudan]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lacey M |title=Nodding disease: mystery of southern Sudan |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=2|issue=12 |pages=714 |year=2003 |pmid=14649236 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00599-4}}</ref> It is a fatal, mentally and physically disabling disease that only affects children, typically between the ages of 5 and 15. It is currently restricted to  small regions in [[South Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], and northern [[Uganda]].<ref name="irinnews">[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=85646 UGANDA: Nodding disease or "river epilepsy"?] IRIN Africa.

== Symptoms ==
The symptoms of nodding disease are very peculiar. When children are affected by it, their growth is stunted completely and permanently. The growth of the brain is also stunted, leading to mental handicapping of the affected individual. The disease is named nodding syndrome due to the characteristic, pathological [[nod (gesture)|nodding]] [[seizure]]. The seizure often begins when the children begin to eat, or sometimes when they feel cold.<ref name=Harding>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3133440.stm 'Nodding disease' hits Sudan] Andrew Harding BBC News 23 September 2003, Accessed 19 October 2007</ref> These seizures are brief and halt after the children stop eating or when they feel warm again. These seizures can manifest themselves with a wide degree of severity. [[Neurotoxicologist]] Peter Spencer, who has investigated the disease, has stated that upon presentation with food, "one or two [children] will start nodding very rapidly in a continuous, pendulous nod. The child next door will suddenly go into a [[tonic–clonic seizure]], others will freeze."<ref name="CBS" /> Severe seizures can cause the child to collapse, leading to further injury.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/28/health/main596493.shtml Bizarre Illness Terrifies Sudanese - 'Nodding Disease' Victims Suffer Seizures, Retardation, Death] Emma Ross, CBS News, Jan. 28, 2004.

A curious feature is that no seizures occur when victims are given an unfamiliar food; for example, a candy bar.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO document describing disease with unusual observation re: unfamiliar food|url=http://www.who.int/hac/crises/sdn/sitreps/10june2011/en/|work=World Health Organisation|publisher=WHO|accessdate=25 December 2011}}</ref>

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Diagnosis is not very advanced and is based on the telltale nodding seizures of the victims. When stunted growth and mental handicap are also present, probability of nodding syndrome is high. In the future, neurological scans may also be used in diagnosis. As there is no known cure for the disease, treatment has been directed at symptoms, and has included the use of anticonvulsants such as [[sodium valproate]]<ref name="NS"/> and [[phenobarbitol]]. Anti-[[malaria]] drugs have also been administered, to unknown effect.<ref name="CBS" />

== Prognosis ==
Nodding syndrome is thought to be debilitating both physically and mentally. In 2004, Peter Spencer stated: "It is, by all reports, a progressive disorder and a fatal disorder, perhaps with a duration of about three years or more."<ref name="CBS" /> While a few children are said to have recovered from it, many have died from the illness.<ref name=Harding/> Seizures can also cause children to collapse, potentially causing injury or death. 

== Possible causes ==
It is currently not known what causes the disease, but it is believed to be connected to infestations of the parasitic worm ''[[Onchocerca volvulus]]'', which is prevalent in all outbreak areas.<ref name="NS" /> ''O. volvulus'', a [[nematode]], is carried by the [[black fly]] and causes [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]]. In 2004, most children suffering from nodding disease lived close to the Yei River, a hotbed for river blindness, and 93.7% of nodding disease sufferers were found to harbour the parasite — a far higher percentage than in children without the disease.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060519084631/http://www.yaleph.com/archive/vol1no1/reg_focus.html When Nodding Means Dying: A baffling new epidemic is sweeping Sudan.] Lekshmi Santhosh ''The Yale Journal of Public Health'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2004.

The CDC is investigating a possible connection with wartime [[chemical warfare|chemical]] exposure. The team is also investigating whether a deficiency in [[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] ([[pyridoxine]]) could be a cause, noting the seizures of [[pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy]] and this common deficiency in disease sufferers.<ref name="Nature" /> Older theories include a 2002 toxicology report that postulated a connection with tainted [[Game meat|monkey meat]], as well as the eating of agricultural seeds provided by relief agencies that were covered in toxic chemicals.<ref name="Harding" />

== Prevalence and epidemiology==

While occurrences of the disease known as "nodding syndrome" have been relatively recent, it appears that the condition was first documented in 1962 in southern Tanzania.<ref name="Nature" /> More recently, nodding syndrome was previously most prevalent in [[South Sudan]], where in 2003 approximately 300 cases were found in Mundri alone. By 2009, it had spread across the border to Uganda's [[Kitgum]] district,<ref name="irinnews" /> and the Ugandan ministry of health declared that more than 2000 children had the disease.<ref name="Nature" /> As of the end of 2011, outbreaks were concentrated in Kitgum, [[Pader]] and [[Gulu]]. More than 1000 cases were diagnosed in the last half of that year.<ref name="NS">{{cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21316-mysterious-nodding-syndrome-spreading-through-uganda.html|title=Mysterious nodding syndrome spreading through Uganda|last=Abraham|first=Curtis|date=23 December 2011|work=New Scientist|accessdate=25 December 2011}}</ref>

There were further outbreaks in early 2012, in South Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/14/1074241/-East-African-Mystery-Disease-Nodding-Syndrome |title=East African Mystery Disease: Nodding Syndrome |date=March 14, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012|publisher=[[Daily Kos]] }}</ref>
