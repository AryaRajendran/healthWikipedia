'''Fatty liver''', also known as '''fatty liver disease''' ('''FLD'''), is a reversible condition where large [[vacuole]]s of [[triglyceride]] fat accumulate in [[hepatocyte|liver cells]] via the process of [[steatosis]] (i.e. abnormal retention of lipids within a cell). Despite having multiple causes, fatty liver can be considered a single [[disease]] that occurs worldwide in those with excessive [[alcohol]] intake and those who are obese (with or without effects of [[insulin resistance]]). The condition is also associated with other diseases that influence fat [[metabolism]].<ref name="reddy">{{cite journal |author=Reddy JK, Rao MS |title=Lipid metabolism and liver inflammation. II. Fatty liver disease and fatty acid oxidation |journal=Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. |volume=290 |issue=5 |pages=G852–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16603729 |doi=10.1152/ajpgi.00521.2005}}</ref> Morphologically, it is difficult to distinguish alcoholic FLD from nonalcoholic FLD, and both show micro[[Vesicle (biology)|vesicular]] and macrovesicular fatty changes at different stages.

Accumulation of fat may also be accompanied by a progressive inflammation of the liver ([[hepatitis]]), called [[steatohepatitis]]. By considering the contribution by alcohol, fatty liver may be termed alcoholic steatosis or [[nonalcoholic fatty liver disease]] (NAFLD), and the more severe forms as alcoholic steatohepatitis (part of [[alcoholic liver disease]]) and [[Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]] (NASH).

==Causes==
Fatty liver is commonly associated with [[alcohol]] or [[metabolic syndrome]] ([[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[obesity]] and [[dyslipidemia]]), but can also be due to any one of many causes<ref name="angulo"/><ref name="bayard"/>:
;Metabolic: [[Abetalipoproteinemia]], [[glycogen storage disease]]s, [[Weber-Christian disease]],  [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]], [[lipodystrophy]]
;Nutritional:[[Malnutrition]], [[total parenteral nutrition]], severe [[weight loss]], [[refeeding syndrome]], [[jejunoileal bypass]], [[gastric bypass]], jejunal [[diverticulosis]] with [[bacterial overgrowth]]
;Drugs and toxins:[[Amiodarone]], [[methotrexate]], [[diltiazem]], expired [[tetracycline]], [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]], [[glucocorticoids]], [[tamoxifen]], environmental [[hepatotoxin]]s (e.g., [[phosphorus]], [[mushroom poisoning]])
;Other:[[Inflammatory bowel disease]], [[HIV]], hepatitis C (especially genotype 3), and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency <ref >{{cite journal |author=Valenti L, Dongiovanni P, Piperno A, ''et al.'' |title=Alpha 1-antitrypsin mutations in NAFLD: high prevalence and association with altered iron metabolism but not with liver damage |journal=Hepatology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=857–64 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17006922 |doi=10.1002/hep.21329 }}</ref>

==Pathology==
[[Image:Periportal hepatosteatosis intermed mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of [[liver lobule|periportal]] [[liver|hepatic]] steatosis, as may be seen due to [[steroid]] use, [[trichrome stain]]]]
Fatty change represents the [[cytoplasm|intracytoplasmatic]] accumulation of triglycerides (neutral fats). At the beginning, the hepatocytes present small fat vacuoles ([[liposomes]]) around the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (microvesicular fatty change). In this stage, liver cells are filled with multiple fat droplets that do not displace the centrally located nucleus. In the late stages, the size of the vacuoles increases, pushing the nucleus to the periphery of the cell, giving characteristic [[signet ring]] appearance (macrovesicular fatty change). These vesicles are well delineated and optically "empty" because fats dissolve during tissue processing. Large vacuoles may coalesce and produce fatty [[cyst]]s, which are irreversible lesions. Macrovesicular [[steatosis]] is the most common form and is typically associated with [[alcohol]], [[diabetes]], [[obesity]] and [[corticosteroids]]. [[Acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] and [[Reye's syndrome]] are examples of severe liver disease caused by microvesicular fatty change.<ref>{{cite book | last = Goldman | first = Lee | title = Cecil Textbook of Medicine – 2-Volume Set, Text with Continually Updated Online Reference | publisher = W.B.

[[Image:Steatosis.jpg|thumb|left|Mechanism leading to hepatic steatosis]]
Defects in [[fatty acid metabolism]] are responsible for [[pathogenesis]] of FLD, which may be due to imbalance in energy consumption and  its combustion,  resulting in lipid storage, or can be a consequence of peripheral resistance to insulin, whereby the transport of fatty acids from [[adipose tissue]] to the liver is increased.<ref name="reddy"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Medina J, Fernández-Salazar LI, García-Buey L, Moreno-Otero R |title=Approach to the pathogenesis and treatment of Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=2057–66 |year=2004 |pmid=15277442 |doi=10.2337/diacare.27.8.2057}}</ref>
Impairment or inhibition of receptor molecules ([[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor|PPAR-α]], [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor|PPAR-γ]] and [[sterol regulatory element binding protein|SREBP1]]) that control the enzymes responsible for the oxidation and synthesis of fatty acids appears to contribute to fat accumulation. In addition, alcoholism is known to damage mitochondria and other cellular structures, further impairing cellular energy mechanism. On the other hand, nonalcoholic FLD may begin as excess of unmetabolised energy in liver cells. Hepatic steatosis is considered reversible and to some extent nonprogressive if the underlying cause is reduced or removed.

[[Image:Steatohepatitis high mag.jpg|thumb|right|Micrograph of inflamed fatty liver ([[steatohepatitis]])]]
Severe fatty liver is sometimes accompanied by [[inflammation]], a situation referred to as [[steatohepatitis]]. Progression to alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) or [[Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]] (NASH) depends on the persistence or severity of the inciting cause. [[Pathological]] lesions in both conditions are similar. However, the extent of inflammatory response varies widely and does not always correlate with degree of fat accumulation. Steatosis (retention of [[lipid]]) and onset of steatohepatitis may represent successive stages in FLD progression.<ref name="pmid9547102">{{cite journal |author=Day CP, James OF |title=Steatohepatitis: a tale of two "hits"? |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=114 |issue=4 |pages=842–5 |year=1998 |pmid=9547102 |doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(98)70599-2}}</ref>

Liver disease with extensive inflammation and a high degree of steatosis often progresses to more severe forms of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gramlich T, Kleiner DE, McCullough AJ, Matteoni CA, Boparai N, Younossi ZM |title=Pathologic features associated with fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease |journal=Hum.

Liver cell death and inflammatory responses lead to the activation of [[Hepatic stellate cell|stellate cells]], which play a pivotal role in hepatic [[fibrosis]]. The extent of fibrosis varies widely. [[Sinusoid (blood vessel)|Perisinusoidal]] fibrosis is most common, especially in adults, and predominates in [[Hepatic lobule|zone 3]] around the terminal [[hepatic veins]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zafrani ES |title=Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: an emerging pathological spectrum |journal=Virchows Arch. |volume=444 |issue=1 |pages=3–12 |year=2004 |pmid=14685853 |doi=10.1007/s00428-003-0943-7}}</ref>

The progression to cirrhosis may be influenced by the amount of fat and degree of steatohepatitis and by a variety of other sensitizing factors. In alcoholic FLD, the transition to cirrhosis related to continued alcohol consumption is well documented, but the process involved in nonalcoholic FLD is less clear.

Most individuals are asymptomatic and are usually discovered incidentally because of abnormal liver function tests or hepatomegaly noted in unrelated medical conditions. Elevated liver biochemistry is found in 50% of patients with simple steatosis.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sleisenger | first = Marvin | title = Sleisenger and Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease | publisher = W.B. Saunders Company | location = Philadelphia | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4160-0245-6 }}</ref> The serum [[alanine transaminase]] level usually is greater than the [[aspartate transaminase]] level in the nonalcoholic variant and the opposite in alcoholic FLD (AST:ALT more than 2:1).

Imaging studies are often obtained during the evaluation process. [[Ultrasonography]] reveals a "bright" liver with increased [[echogenicity]]. [[Medical imaging]] can aid in diagnosis of fatty liver; fatty livers have lower [[density]] than [[spleen]]s on [[computed tomography]] (CT), and fat appears bright in [[Relaxation (NMR)|T1-weighted]] [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance images]] (MRIs). No medical imagery, however, is able to distinguish simple steatosis from advanced NASH. [[Histology|Histological]] diagnosis by [[liver biopsy]] is sought when assessment of severity is indicated.

==Treatment==
The treatment of fatty liver depends on its cause, and generally, treating the underlying cause will reverse the process of steatosis if implemented at an early stage. Two known causes of fatty liver disease are an excess consumption of alcohol, and a prolonged diet containing foods with a high proportion of calories coming from lipids.{{cn|date=April 2013}} For the patients who have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with pure steatosis and no evidence of inflammation, a gradual weight loss is often the only recommendation.<ref name="angulo"/> In more serious cases medications that decrease insulin resistance, [[hyperlipidemia]] as well as those that induce weight loss have been shown to improve liver function.<ref name="bayard"/>

== Complication ==
Up to 10% of cirrhotic alcoholic FLD patients will develop [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]. The overall incidence of liver cancer in nonalcoholic FLD has not yet been quantified, but the association is well established.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Qian Y, Fan JG |title=Obesity, fatty liver and liver cancer |journal=Hbpd Int |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=173–7 |year=2005 |pmid=15908310 }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of FLD in the general population ranges from 10% to 24% in various countries.<ref name="angulo"/> However, the condition is observed in up to 75% of obese people, 35% of whom will progress to NAFLD,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hamaguchi M, Kojima T, Takeda N, Nakagawa T, Taniguchi H, Fujii K, Omatsu T, Nakajima T, Sarui H, Shimazaki M, Kato T, Okuda J, Ida K |title=The metabolic syndrome as a predictor of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease |journal=Ann.
