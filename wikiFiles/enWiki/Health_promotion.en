'''Health promotion''' has been defined by the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) 2005 [[Bangkok Charter|Bangkok Charter for Health Promotion in a Globalized World]] as "the process of enabling people to increase control over their [[health]] and its determinants, and thereby improve their health".<ref name=WHO2005BangkokPDF>Participants at the 6th Global Conference on Health Promotion.

Accessed 2009 Feb 4.</ref> The primary means of health promotion occur through developing healthy [[public policy]] that addresses the prerequisites of health such as income, housing, food security, employment, and quality working conditions. There is a tendency among [[public health]] officials and governments—and this is especially the case in neoliberal nations such as Canada and the USA—to reduce health promotion to health education and [[social marketing]] focused on changing behavioral risk factors.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bunton R, Macdonald G. |title=Health promotion: disciplines, diversity, and developments |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-23569-3 |edition=2nd}}</ref>

Recent work in the UK ''(Delphi consultation exercise due to be published late 2009 by Royal Society of Public Health and the National Social Marketing Centre)'' on relationship between health promotion and social marketing has highlighted and reinforce the potential integrative nature of the approaches. While an independent review (NCC 'It's Our Health!' 2006) identified that some social marketing has in past adopted a narrow or limited approach, the UK has increasingly taken a lead in the discussion and developed a much more integrative and strategic approach (see Strategic Social Marketing in 'Social Marketing and Public Health' 2009 Oxford Press) which adopts a whole-system and holistic approach, integrating the learning from effective health promotion approaches with relevant learning from social marketing and other disciplines. A key finding from the Delphi consultation was the need to avoid unnecessary and arbitrary 'methods wars' and instead focus on the issue of 'utility'  and harnessing the potential of learning from multiple disciplines and sources. Such an approach is arguably how health promotion has developed over the years pulling in learning from different sectors and disciplines to enhance and develop.

==History==
The "first and best known" definition of health promotion, promulgated by the ''American Journal of Health Promotion'' since at least 1986, is "the science and art of helping people change their lifestyle to move toward a state of optimal health".<ref name=Minkler1989>{{cite journal |author=Minkler M |title=Health education, health promotion and the open society: an historical perspective |journal=Health Educ Q |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=17–30 |date=Spring 1989 |pmid=2649456 |url=http://heb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/16/1/17}}</ref><ref>[http://www.healthpromotionjournal.com/ American Journal of Health Promotion.] Accessed 2009 Feb 4.</ref>  This definition was derived from the 1974 [[Lalonde report]] from the Government of Canada,<ref name=Minkler1989/> which contained a health promotion strategy "aimed at informing, influencing and assisting both individuals and organizations so that they will accept more responsibility and be more active in matters affecting mental and physical health".<ref>Lalonde M.

[people] to develop lifestyles that can maintain and enhance the state of well-being".<ref>[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/B/G/K/_/nnbbgk.pdf Healthy people: the Surgeon General's report on health promotion and disease prevention.] Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General, 1979.

At least two publications led to a "broad empowerment/environmental" definition of health promotion in the mid-1980s<ref name=Minkler1989/>:
* In 1984 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Regional Office for Europe defined health promotion as "the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health".<ref name=WHO1984>{{cite journal |title=A discussion document on the concept and principles of health promotion |journal=Health Promot |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=73–6 |year=1986 |month=May |pmid=10286854 |url=http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/1/1/73.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> In addition to methods to change lifestyles, the WHO Regional Office advocated "legislation, fiscal measures, organisational change, community development and spontaneous local activities against health hazards" as health promotion methods.<ref name=WHO1984/>
* In 1986, Jake Epp, [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Canadian Minister of National Health and Welfare]], released ''Achieving health for all: a framework for health promotion'' which also came to be known as the "Epp report".<ref name=Minkler1989/><ref name=Epp>{{cite journal |author=Epp J |title=Achieving health for all.

The WHO, in collaboration with other organizations, has subsequently co-sponsored international conferences on health promotion as follows:

==Workplace health promotion==
{{Main|Workplace health promotion}}

Work site health focus on the prevention and intervention that reduce health risk of the employee. The U.S. Public Health Service recently issued a report titled "Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General" which provides a comprehensive review of the available scientific evidence about the relationship between physical activity and an individual's health status. The report shows that over 60% of Americans are not regularly active and 25% are not active at all. There is very strong evidence linking physical activity to numerous health improvements. 
Health promotion can be performed in various locations. Among the settings that have received special attention are the community, [[health care provider|health care facilities]], schools, and worksites.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tones K, Tilford S |title=Health promotion: effectiveness, efficiency and equity |publisher=Nelson Thornes |location=Cheltenham UK |year=2001 |isbn=0-7487-4527-0 |edition=3rd}}</ref> Worksite health promotion, also known by terms such as "workplace health promotion," has been defined as "the combined efforts of employers, employees and society to improve the health and well-being of people at work".<ref>European Network for Workplace Health Promotion.

Worksite health promotion programs (also called "workplace health promotion programs," "worksite wellness programs," or "workplace wellness programs") include exercise, [[nutrition]], smoking cessation and stress management.  Reviews and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] published between 2005 and 2008 that examined the scientific literature on worksite health promotion programs include the following:

===Norway===
The Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU (http://www.rchpr.org) was established in Trondheim 2010. The Centre takes part in the scientific exploration of what promotes, maintains and restores good health – both in healthy, vulnerable and diseased populations. The research group has a bio-psycho-social- existential health understanding. Health is understood as a positive resource which every person has more or less of. The Centre will contribute to new knowledge about the following:Factors that promote, sustain, and restore good health in healthy people, vulnerable or exposed groups, and those with health deficiencies.Factors that promote health (i.e., salutogenesis) as opposed to focusing on factors that generate illness and disease (i.e., pathogenesis). 

===Sri Lanka===
Health promotion in Sri Lanka has been very successful during recent decades as shown by the health indicators. Despite the numerous successes over the years, the integrity of the [[health system]] has been subjected to many challenges. Sri Lanka is already facing emerging challenges due to demographic, epidemiological, technological and socio-economic transitions.  The disease burden has started to shift rapidly towards lifestyle and environmental related [[non-communicable disease]]s. These are chronic and high cost and will cause more and perhaps unaffordable burden to the country’s health care expenditure, under the free of charge health services policy. The previous success of health development increased the life expectancy of Sri Lankan people to 72 for male and 76 for women but the estimated “healthy life expectancy” at birth of all Sri Lanka population is only 61.6<br />

:
Health is affected by biological, psychological, chemical, physical, social, cultural and economic factors in people’s normal living environments and people’s lifestyles. With the current rapid changing demographic, social and economic context and the epidemiological pattern of diseases, the previous health promotion interventions which found to be effective in the past may not be effective enough now and the future to address all the important determinants that affect health. Promoting people’s health must be the joint responsibility of all the social actors. These challenges require significant changes in the national health system toward new effective health promotion which has been accepted worldwide as the most cost effective measure to reduce the disease burden of the people and the burden of the nation on the increasing cost for treatment of diseases. <br />
 
The development of this [http://whosrilanka.healthrepository.org/bitstream/123456789/290/1/Sri%20Lanka%20National%20Health%20Promotion%20Policy-%20final%20draft-.pdf National Health Promotion Policy] is based on: (a) the evidences from Sri Lanka health promotion situation analysis, 
(b) the international accepted concept, the WHO guiding principle for health promotion and the World Health Assembly resolutions and WHO South East Asia Regional Committee Resolution, and (c) the State Policy and Strategy for Health and the Health Master Plan 2007–2016. <br />

The key strategies for health promotion are: advocacy and mediate between different interests in society for the pursuit of health; empower and enable individual and communities to take control over their own health and all determinants of health; improve the health promotion management, health promotion interventions, programs, plans and implementation; and partnership, networking, alliance building and integration of health promotion activities across sectors. <br />
   
      
In Sri Lanka, other non health government sectors and NGOs are currently active implementing  their community development projects with the community empowerment concept that resemble the healthy setting approach for health promotion. These projects are the high potential entry points and good opportunity for the formal commencement of the new effective setting approach health promotion and the holistic life course health promotion. It is also an opportunity for partnerships and alliance building for concerted action to promote health of the nation. 
This policy is formulated to promote health and well-being of the people by enabling all people to be responsible for their own health and address the broad determinants of health through the concerted actions of health and all other sectors to make Sri Lanka a Health Promoting Nation where all the citizens actively participate in health promotion activities continuously for a healthy life expectancy. <br />

The policy objectives are as follow : 

:#  To strengthen leaderships for health promotion at all levels and all sectors through advocacy. 
:#  To mobilize the society and create nationwide health promotion actions.  
:#  To develop and implement effective comprehensive holistic and multisectoral approach health promotion interventions.     
:#  To establish an effective system and mechanism for health promotion management and coordination at all levels.  
:#  To build capacity for health promotion at all levels and across sectors. 
:#  To improve financing and resources allocation and utilization for health promotion.  
:#  To establish an evidence-base for health promotion effectiveness. <br />

Various strategies have been developed for the attainment of each objective focus on the multi-sectoral comprehensive approach  and participation of all stakeholders and the people themselves. This National Health Promotion Policy will be monitored and evaluated at all levels. Participatory monitoring and evaluation will be encouraged at implementation level.The National Health Promotion Consortium and the National Health Council will be responsible for the regular monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of this National Health Promotion Policy. Implementation of this policy will also be monitored regularly as part of the overall process of monitoring the activities of the Government and Ministries and covering various sectors and levels of government.<br />
