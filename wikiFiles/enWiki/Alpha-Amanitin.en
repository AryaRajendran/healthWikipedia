'''''alpha''-Amanitin''' or '''α-amanitin''' is a [[cyclic peptide]] of eight [[amino acid]]s. It is possibly the most deadly of all the [[amatoxin]]s, [[toxin]]s found in several species of the ''[[Amanita]]'' genus of [[mushroom]]s, one being the [[Amanita phalloides|death cap]] (''Amanita phalloides'') as well as the [[destroying angel]], a complex of similar species, principally ''A. virosa'' and ''A. bisporigera''.  It is also found in the mushrooms ''[[Galerina marginata]]'' and ''[[Conocybe filaris]]''. The oral {{LD50}} of amanitin is approximately 0.1&nbsp;mg/kg.

The structure of the polypeptide is atypical of most polypeptides, due to the branching of the amino acid chain.  A cross bridge between 6-hydroxy-[[tryptophan]] and [[cysteine]] allows the formation of a second "inner loop," as seen in the diagram at right.  The "outer loop" is formed by the normal peptide bond of the carboxyl terminus to the amino terminus of the peptide chain.

Unlike other known fungal cyclic peptides, amatoxins (and [[phallotoxin]]s such as phalloidin) are synthesized on ribosomes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = H. Hallen, H. Luo, J.S.

== Scientific use ==

α-Amanitin is an inhibitor of [[RNA polymerase II]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = B. Meinecke and S. Meinecke-Tillmann | year = 1993 | journal = Journal of Reproduction and Fertility | volume = 98 | pages = 195–201 | url = http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/1/195 | pmid = 8345464 | doi = 10.1530/jrf.0.0980195 | title = Effects of  -amanitin on nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes in vitro | issue = 1}}</ref> This mechanism makes it a deadly toxin.

α-Amanitin can also be used to determine which types of RNA polymerase are present. This is done by testing the sensitivity of the polymerase in the presence of α-amanitin. RNA polymerase I is insensitive, RNA polymerase II is highly sensitive (inhibited at 1μg/ml), RNA polymerase III is moderately sensitive (inhibited at 10μg/ml), and RNA polymerase IV is slightly sensitive (inhibited at 50μg/ml).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== Symptoms of poisoning ==
α-Amanitin has an unusually strong and specific attraction to the enzyme RNA polymerase II. Upon ingestion and uptake by liver cells, it binds to the RNA polymerase II enzyme, effectively causing [[cytolysis]] of [[hepatocyte]]s (liver cells).<ref>{{cite journal | author = D. Michelot and R. Labia | year = 1988 | journal = Drug Metabol Drug Interact | volume = 6 | pages = 265–274 | pmid = 3078291 | title = alpha-Amanitin: a possible suicide substrate-like toxin involving the sulphoxide moiety of the bridged cyclopeptide. | issue = 3-4}}</ref> Few effects are reported within 10 hours; it is not unusual for significant effects to take as long as 24 hours after ingestion to appear, with this delay in symptoms making α-amanitin poisoning even more difficult to diagnose and all the more dangerous. By then, it is far past the time in which [[stomach]] pumping would yield an efficient result.  [[Diarrhea]] and [[cramps]] are the first symptoms, but those pass, giving a false sign of remission. Typically, on the 4th to 5th day, the toxin starts to have severe effects on the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]], leading to total system failure in both. Death usually takes place around a week from ingestion.<ref>{{cite journal | author = A. Mas | year = 2005 | title = Mushrooms | journal = Journal of Hepatology | volume = 42 | pages = 166–169 | url = http://www.jhep-elsevier.com/article/PIIS0168827804006002/fulltext | doi = 10.1016/j.jhep.2004.12.003 | pmid = 15664239 | issue = 2 }}</ref>

Around 15% of those poisoned will die within 10 days, progressing through a comatose stage to [[renal failure]], [[liver failure]], [[Hepatic encephalopathy|hepatic coma]], [[respiratory failure]] and death. Those who recover are at risk of permanent liver damage.<ref name ="benjamin95">{{cite journal |author=Benjamin DR |title=Amatoxin syndrome |pages=198–214}} in: {{cite book |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas — a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians |publisher=New York: WH Freeman and Company |year=1995}}</ref> Diagnosis is difficult, and is established by observation of the clinical symptoms as well as the presence of α-amanitin in the [[urine]]. Urine screening is generally most useful within 48 hours of ingestion. Treatment is mainly supportive ([[gastric lavage]], [[activated carbon]], [[Fluid replacement|fluid resuscitation]]) but includes various drugs to counter the amatoxins, including intravenous [[penicillin]] and [[cephalosporin]] derivatives, and, in cases of greater ingestion, can extend to an [[orthotopic liver transplant]]. The most reliable method to treat amanitin poisoning is through having the stomach pumped immediately after ingestion; however, the onset of symptoms is generally too late for this to be an option. Chemically modified [[silibinin]], silibinin dihydrogen disuccinate disodium (trade name Legalon SIL) a solution for [[injection (medicine)|injection]], is used in treatment of severe intoxications with hepatotoxic substances, such as [[Amanita phalloides|death cap]] (''Amanita phalloides'') poisoning.<ref name =Mitchell2009>{{cite journal |author=Mitchell, T |title=Intravenous Milk thistle (silibinin-legalon) for hepatic failure induced by amatoxin/''Amanita'' mushroom poisoning |journal=(Clinical study) |year=2009 |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00915681}}</ref>
