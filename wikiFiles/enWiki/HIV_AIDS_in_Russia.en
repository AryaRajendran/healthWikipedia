Coordination of activities in responding to AIDS remains a challenge for Russia, despite increased efforts. In 2006, [[HIV#Treatment|treatment]] for some patients was interrupted due to delays in tender procedures and unexpected difficulties with customs. Additionally, lack of full commitment to an in-depth program for [[sex education|education on sex]] and [[drug education|drugs]] in schools hinders effective prevention programs for children.<ref name=aids/>

At the 2010 International AIDS Conference in Vienna, a representative of the Andrei Rylkov Foundation for Health and Social Justice, criticized Russian authorities for their harsh line on [[Heroin|injecting drug users]], which makes people in this high-risk group afraid of seeking out the health services they need, causing HIV rates to rise.<ref>Aasland, Aadne: [http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post17 ”Rights here, right now!” – the reality of injecting drug users in Russia?] (NIBR International Blog 20.07.2010)</ref> A research project by [[NIBR]] in 2010 revealed that despite Federal authorities' increased efforts, there remains a systemic reluctance to fund programs targeted at risk groups, with big regional differences in level of commitment to and way of organizing campaigns and treatment. Influence of individuals at the local level and personal relations between key stakeholders in concrete regions seem to be of core importance. The NIBR project found that the 'bottleneck' is at the elite level rather than the popular level: representative surveys in [[Arkhangelsk]] and [[St. Petersburg]] found that 90% supported education on sexual issues in the schools, more than 70% supported needle exchange-programs, and a majority supported methadone treatment - despite the latter being illegal in Russia today.<ref name="NIBR International Blog 12.11.2010"/>
