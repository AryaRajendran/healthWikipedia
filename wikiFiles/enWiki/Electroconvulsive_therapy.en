'''Electroconvulsive therapy''' ('''ECT'''), formerly known as '''electroshock''', is a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] treatment in which [[seizure]]s are electrically induced in anesthetized patients for therapeutic effect. Its mode of action is unknown.<ref name=Rudorfer/> The use of electroconvulsive therapy evolved out of convulsive therapy. Long before electric shocks were being administered to induce seizures, doctors were using other drugs and methods to induce seizures as a means of treatment for severe depression and schizophrenia. Today, ECT is most often recommended for use as a treatment for  [[clinical depression|severe depression]] that has not responded to other treatment, and is also used in the treatment of [[mania]] and [[catatonia]].<ref name="The Royal College">{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/files/pdfversion/cr128.pdf |title=The ECT Handbook Second Edition: The Third Report of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Special Committee on ECT |format=PDF |work= |year=2005 |publisher=[[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] |author=Scott AIF (ed) ''et al.'' |accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref> It was first introduced in 1938 by [[Italy|Italian]] neuropsychiatrists [[Ugo Cerletti]] and [[Lucio Bini]], and gained widespread use as a form of treatment in the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shorter|first=Eward|title=A History of Electroconvulsive Treatment in Mental Illness|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=978-0-8135-4169-3|pages=46–47}}</ref><ref>Psychology Frontiers and Applications&nbsp;– Second Canadian Edition (Passer, Smith, Atkinson, Mitchell, Muir)</ref>

Electroconvulsive therapy can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, frequency of treatments, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus. These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and positive outcomes. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some patients receive continuation/maintenance ECT. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, drug therapy is continued during ECT.<ref name="The Royal College"/>

== History ==
[[File:Bergonic chair.jpg|thumb|A Bergonic chair "for giving general electric treatment for psychological effect, in psycho-neurotic cases", according to original photo description. World War I era.]]
As early as the 16th century, agents to produce seizures were used to treat psychiatric conditions. In 1785, the therapeutic use of seizure induction was documented in the ''London Medical Journal''.<ref name="Rudorfer" /> Convulsive therapy was introduced in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] who, believing mistakenly that [[schizophrenia]] and [[epilepsy]] were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures with first [[camphor]] and then [[metrazol]] (cardiazol).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9700802908 | last1 = Berrios | first1 = G E | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1997 | title = The scientific origins of electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = 29 pt 1| pages = 105–119 | pmid = 11619203 }}</ref><ref name="Fink-history">{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = The origins of convulsive therapy | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 141 | issue = 9| pages = 1034–41 | pmid = 6147103 }}</ref> Ladislas Meduna is thought to be the father of convulsive therapy.<ref name=Bolwig>{{cite journal|last=Bolwig|first=T.|title=How does electroconvulsive therapy work? Theories on its mechanism|journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|year=2011|volume=51|issue=1|pages=13-18|pmid=21324238|accessdate=4/22/13}}</ref> In 1937, the first international meeting on convulsive therapy was held in Switzerland by the Swiss psychiatrist Muller. The proceedings were published in the ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' and, within three years, cardiazol convulsive therapy was being used worldwide.<ref name="Fink-history" /> Italian Professor of neuropsychiatry [[Ugo Cerletti]], who had been using electric shocks to produce seizures in animal experiments, and his colleague [[Lucio Bini]] developed the idea of using electricity as a substitute for metrazol in convulsive therapy and, in 1937, experimented for the first time on a person. It was known early on that inducing convulsions aided in helping those with severe schizophrenia. Cerletti had noted a shock to the head produced convulsions in dogs. The idea to use electroshock on humans came to Cerletti when he saw how pigs were given an electric shock before being butchered to put them in an anesthetized state.<ref name=Sabbatini>{{cite web|last=Sabbatini|first=R.|title=The history of shock therapy in psychiatry|url=http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n04/historia/shock_i.htm|accessdate=4/24/13}}</ref> Cerletti and Bini practiced until they felt they had the right parameters needed to have a successful human trial. Once they started trials on patients they found that after 10-20 treatments the results were significant. Patients had much improved.  A positive side effect to the treatment was retrograde amnesia. It was because of this side effect that patients could not remember the treatments and had no ill feelings toward it.<ref name=Sabbatini>{{cite web|last=Sabbatini|first=R.|title=The history of shock therapy in psychiatry|url=http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n04/historia/shock_i.htm|accessdate=4/24/13}}</ref>
ECT soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient.<ref>Cerletti, U (1956). "Electroshock therapy". In AM Sackler ''et al''. (eds) ''The Great Physiodynamic Therapies in Psychiatry: an historical appraisal.'' New York: Hoeber-Harper, 91–120.</ref> Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a [[Nobel Prize]] but did not receive one. By 1940, the procedure was introduced to both England and the US. In Germany and Austria it was promoted by [[Friedrich Meggendorfer]]. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the use of ECT became widespread.

In the early 1940s, in an attempt to reduce the memory disturbance and confusion associated with treatment, two modifications were introduced: the use of unilateral electrode placement and the replacement of sinusoidal current with brief pulse. It took many years for brief-pulse equipment to be widely adopted.<ref name="Kiloh">Kiloh, LG, Smith, JS, Johnson, GF (1988). ''Physical Treatments in Psychiatry''. Melbourne: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 190–208. ISBN 0-86793-112-4</ref>  In the 1940s and early 1950s ECT was usually given in "unmodified" form, without muscle relaxants, and the seizure resulted in a full-scale convulsion. A rare but serious complication of unmodified ECT was fracture or dislocation of the long bones. In the 1940s psychiatrists began to experiment with [[curare]], the muscle-paralysing South American poison, in order to modify the convulsions. The introduction of [[suxamethonium]] (succinylcholine), a safer synthetic alternative to curare, in 1951 led to the more widespread use of "modified" ECT. A short-acting anesthetic was usually given in addition to the muscle relaxant in order to spare patients the terrifying feeling of suffocation that can be experienced with muscle relaxants.<ref name="Kiloh"/>

The steady growth of antidepressant use along with negative depictions of ECT in the mass media led to a marked decline in the use of ECT during the 1950s to the 1970s. The [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] stated there were problems with electroshock therapy in the initial years before anesthesia was routinely given, and that "these now-antiquated practices contributed to the negative portrayal of ECT in the popular media."<ref name="erica goode">

</ref> The New York Times described the public's negative perception of ECT as being caused mainly by one movie. "For Big Nurse in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' it was a tool of terror, and, in the public mind, ''shock therapy'' has retained the tarnished image given it by Ken Kesey's novel: dangerous, inhumane and overused".<ref name="Goleman 1990"/>

In 1976, Dr. Blatchley demonstrated the effectiveness of his constant current, brief pulse device ECT. This device eventually largely replaced earlier devices because of the reduction in cognitive side effects, although as of 2012 some ECT clinics still were using sine-wave devices.<ref name=Leiknes>Leiknes KA, et al (2012) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381633/ Contemporary use and practice of electroconvulsive therapy worldwide.]  Brain Behav. 2(3):283-344</ref> The 1970s saw the publication of the first American Psychiatric Association task force report on electroconvulsive therapy (to be followed by further reports in 1990 and 2001). The report endorsed the use of ECT in the treatment of depression. The decade also saw criticism of ECT.<ref>See Friedberg, J (1977). "Shock treatment, brain damage, and memory loss: a neurological perspective". ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' '''134''':1010–1014; and Breggin, PR (1979) ''Electroshock: its brain-disabling effects''. New York: Springer</ref>  Specifically critics pointed to shortcomings such as noted side effects, the procedure being used as a form of abuse, and uneven application of ECT. The use of ECT declined until the 1980s, "when use began to increase amid growing awareness of its benefits and cost-effectiveness for treating severe depression".<ref name="erica goode"/> In 1985 the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and [[National Institutes of Health]] convened a consensus development conference on ECT and concluded that, while ECT was the most controversial treatment in psychiatry and had significant side-effects, it had been shown to be effective for a narrow range of severe psychiatric disorders.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blaine | first1 = JD | last2 = Clark | first2 = SM | year = 1986 | title = Report of the NIMH–NIH consensus development conference on Electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = Psychopharmacology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 445–452 }}</ref></blockquote>

Due to the backlash noted previously, national institutions reviewed past practices and set new standards. In 1978, The American Psychiatric Association released its first task force report in which new standards for consent were introduced and the use of unilateral electrode placement was recommended. The 1985 NIMH Consensus Conference confirmed the therapeutic role of ECT in certain circumstances. The American Psychiatric Association released its second task force report in 1990 where specific details on the delivery, education, and training of ECT were documented. Finally in 2001 the American Psychiatric Association released its latest task force report. This report emphasizes the importance of informed consent, and the expanded role that the procedure has in modern medicine.

== Mechanism of action ==
The aim of ECT is to induce a therapeutic clonic [[seizure]] (a seizure where the person loses consciousness and has convulsions) lasting for at least 15 seconds. Although a large amount of research has been carried out, the exact mechanism of action of ECT remains elusive. [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] believed that chemically induced seizures, brought on by drugs, could change the chemical makeup of the brain of a patient with [[schizophrenia]]. Electroconvulsive therapy operates under similar beliefs. We know that the brain and heart are powered by a small electrical current and disrupting or restarting that current by inducing seizure has shown some positive side effects in patients with severe [[depression]] or schizophrenia.<ref name=Bolwig>{{cite journal|last=Bolwig|first=T.|title=How does electroconvulsive therapy work? Theories on its mechanism|journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|year=2011|volume=51|issue=1|pages=13-18|doi=1497-00015|accessdate=4/22/13}}</ref> ECT doctors claim it may "jumpstart the brain", helping boost neurotransmission, while others, such as [[Peter Breggin]], describe it as follows: "Shock treatment is simply closed-head injury caused by an overwhelming current of electricity sufficient to cause a [[grand mal seizure]]. When the patient becomes apathetic, the doctor writes in the hospital chart, 'No longer complaining.' When the patient displays the euphoria commonly associated with brain damage, the doctor writes, 'mood improved.' Meanwhile, the individual's brain and mind are so drastically injured that he or she is rendered unable to protest."<ref>Dr. Peter Breggin for Huffington Post. February 9, 2008. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-peter-breggin/braindisabling-treatments_b_85828.html Brain-Disabling Treatments in Psychiatry: Drugs, Electroshock and the Psychopharmaceutical Complex]</ref>  The main reasons for this are that the human brain cannot be studied directly before and after ECT and therefore scientists rely on animal models of depression and ECT, with major limitations. While animal models are acknowledged to model merely aspects of depressive illness, human and animal brains are very similar at a molecular level, enabling detailed study of the molecular mechanisms involved in ECT.<ref name="Rudorfer" />

There is a vast literature on the effects of Electroconvulsive Shock (ECS) in animals. In [[animal models of depression]], particularly "[[learned helplessness]]" and "[[social defeat]]", there is evidence of pruning of normally dense [[Synapse|synaptic]] connections in the [[hippocampus]], a richly connected area deep in the [[temporal lobe]] which is vital in controlling both mood and memory.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krishnan, et al. |title=The molecular neurobiology of depression |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=1 |pages=894–902 |year=2008 |month=October|pmid=18923511 |doi=10.1038/nature07455 |last2=Nestler |first2=EJ |pmc=2721780 |bibcode=2008Natur.455..894K}}</ref>

== Selection of patients for ECT ==
Experts disagree on whether ECT is an appropriate first-line treatment or if it should be reserved for patients who have not responded to other interventions such as medication and psychotherapy.<ref name="APA2001guideline"/>

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) 2001 guidelines give the primary indications for ECT among patients with depression as a lack of response to, or intolerance of, [[antidepressant]] medications; a good response to previous ECT; and the need for a rapid and definitive response (e.g. because of [[psychosis]] or a risk of [[suicide]]). The decision to use ECT depends on several factors, including the severity and chronicity of the depression, the likelihood that alternative treatments would be effective, the patient's preference and capacity to consent, and a weighing of the risks and benefits.<ref>Lisanby, S.H. (2007) [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/357/19/1939 Electroconvulsive Therapy for Depression] Volume 357, No. 19, pp. 1939–1945</ref>

Some guidelines{{which|date=March 2013}}  recommend [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] or other [[psychotherapy]] before ECT is used. However, treatment resistance is widely defined as lack of therapeutic response to two antidepressants at adequate doses for an adequate duration and with good compliance. The APA states that at times patients will prefer to receive ECT over alternative treatments, but commonly the opposite will be the case.

The APA ECT guidelines state that severe [[major depression]] with psychotic features, manic delirium, or [[catatonia]] are conditions where there is a clear consensus favoring early ECT. The [[UK]]'s [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] 2003 (NICE) guidelines recommended ECT for patients with severe depression, [[catatonia]], or prolonged or severe [[mania]]. It did not recommend the use of ECT as a maintenace therapy in depressive illness as "the long-term benefits and risks ... had not been clearly established"<ref name=NICE2003>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/59ectfullguidance.pdf |title=Guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] |date=2003-04 |work= |accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref>{{rp|5-6}}  and those recommendations were unchanged in the 2010 update.<ref name=NICE2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12329/45896/45896.pdf |title=Depression in adults (update) |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]]|page=526 |year=2010 |work= |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>{{rp|526}}  The 2001 APA guidelines support the use of ECT for relapse prevention.

The 2001 APA ECT guidelines say that ECT is rarely used as a first-line treatment for [[schizophrenia]], but is considered after unsuccessful treatment with antipsychotic medication, and may also be considered in the treatment of patients with [[schizoaffective]] or [[schizophreniform]] disorder. The 2003 NICE ECT guidelines do not recommend ECT for schizophrenia, and this has been supported by [[meta-analytic]] evidence showing no or little benefit versus [[placebo]], or in combination with [[antipsychotic]] drugs, including [[Clozapine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tharyan, P. Adams, C.E. |title=Electroconvulsive therapy for schizophrenia |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue=2 |year=2005 |pmid=15846598  |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000076.pub2  |pages=CD000076 |editor1-last=Tharyan |editor1-first=Prathap }}</ref>

The NICE 2003 guidelines state that doctors should be particularly cautious when considering ECT treatment for women who are [[pregnant]] and for older or younger people, because they may be at higher risk of complications with ECT. The 2001 APA ECT guidelines say that ECT may be safer than alternative treatments in the infirm elderly and during pregnancy, and the 2000 APA depression guidelines stated that the literature supports the safety for mother and [[fetus]], as well as the efficacy during pregnancy.

==Efficacy==

=== Non-clinical patient characteristics ===
About 70 percent of ECT patients are women.<ref name="Rudorfer"/> This is almost entirely due to women being at twice the risk of depression.<ref name="Rudorfer"/><ref name="Reid"/> Older and more affluent patients are also more likely to receive ECT. The use of ECT is not as common in ethnic minorities.<ref name="Reid"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Euba R, Saiz A |title=A comparison of the ethnic distribution in the depressed inpatient population and in the electroconvulsive therapy clinic |journal=J ECT |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=235–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17143151 |doi=10.1097/01.yct.0000235928.39279.52}}</ref>

===Degree of effectiveness and risks===
Scientific papers and articles reviewing studies of ECT effectiveness have reached conflicting conclusions.

A meta-analysis done on the effectiveness of ECT in unipolar and bipolar depression was conducted in 2012. Findings showed that although patients with unipolar depression and bipolar depression responded very differently to other medical treatments both groups responded equally as well to ECT. Overall remission rate for patients with unipolar depression was 51.5% and 50.9% in those with bipolar depression. The severity of each patient’s depression was assessed at the same baseline in each group.<ref name=Dierckx>{{cite journal|last=Dierckx|first=B.|title=Efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy in bipolar versus unipolar major depression: A meta-analysis|journal=Bipolar Disorders|year=2012|volume=12|issue=2|pages=146-150|pmid=22420590|accessdate=4/23/13}}</ref>

In 2003, The UK ECT Review group published a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing ECT to placebo and antidepressant drugs. This meta-analysis demonstrated a large effect size (high efficacy relative to the mean in terms of the standard deviation) for ECT versus placebo, and versus antidepressant drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=UK ECT Review Group |title=Efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy in depressive disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=The Lancet|volume=361 |issue=9360 |pages=799–808 |year=2003 |pmid=12642045 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12705-5}}</ref>

In 2006, a research article by Dr. Colin A. Ross found that no studies had ever shown that ECT was more effective than a placebo (sham ECT) treatment as of 1 month posttreatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ross CA |title=The sham ECT literature: implications for consent to ECT |journal=Ethical Human Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=17–28 |year=2006 |pmid=16856307 |doi=10.1891/ehpp.8.1.17}}</ref>

In 2008, a meta-analytic review paper found in terms of efficacy, "a significant superiority of ECT in all comparisons: ECT versus simulated ECT, ECT versus placebo, ECT versus antidepressants in general, ECT versus TCAs and ECT versus MAOIs."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://focus.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=52572|author=Daniel Pagnin, M.D., M.Sc.; Valéria de Queiroz, M.D., M.Sc.; Stefano Pini, M.D.; Giovanni Battista Cassano, M.D.|title=Efficacy of ECT in Depression: A Meta-Analytic Review|journal=Focus}}</ref>

In 2010, a paper by Dr. John Reed and Dr. Richard Bentall found that ECT was only minimally more effective than a placebo during the treatment period, and that there was no difference in effect after the treatment period. In light of this finding, and the risk of side-effects, the authors concluded that the use of ECT "cannot be scientifically justified".<ref name="Read 333–47"/>

A 2011 paper in the Journal of Psychiatric Nurses Association reported that ECT was effective.<ref>http://jap.sagepub.com/content/17/3/217.short</ref>

Surveys of public opinion, the testimony of former patients, legal restrictions on its use and disputes as to the efficacy, ethics and adverse effects of ECT within the psychiatric and wider medical community indicate that the use of ECT remains controversial.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Philpot|first=M|title=Barriers to the use of electroconvulsive therapy in the elderly: a European survey|journal=European Psychiatry|date=NaN undefined NaN|volume=17|issue=1|pages=41–45|doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(02)00620-X|pmid=11918992|last2=Treloar|first2=A|last3=Gormley|first3=N|last4=Gustafson|first4=L}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Robert|title=Mad in America : bad science, bad medicine, and the enduring mistreatment of the mentally ill|year=2010|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-02014-0|pages=102–106|edition=Rev. pbk.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Golenkov|first=A.|coauthors=Ungvari, G.

===Duration of effect===
ECT on its own does not usually have a sustained benefit. Half those who remit then relapse within six months. This is similar to the rate of relapse after discontinuing antidepressant medication, and it has been suggested that it is due to the severity and chronicity of pre-existing illness for which ECT is generally used.<ref>Sackeim HA, Haskett RF, Mulsant BH, Thase ME, Mann JJ, Pettinati HM, Greenberg RM, Crowe RR, Cooper TB, Prudic J.(2001) [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/285/10/1299?ijkey=26825a5fbea146e584cd6459ea113828f4f202fa&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha Continuation pharmacotherapy in the prevention of relapse following electroconvulsive therapy: a randomized controlled trial.] JAMA. 2001 Mar 14; '''285'''(10):1299–307.</ref> The relapse rate in the first six months is reduced by the use of psychiatric medications or further ECT, but remains high.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17453654  | author-separator =, | last1 = Tew Jr | author-name-separator=  | first1 = JD| doi=10.1080/10401230601163360 | last2 = Mulsant | first2 = BH | last3 = Haskett | first3 = RF | last4 = Joan | first4 = P | last5 = Begley | first5 = AE | last6 = Sackeim | first6 = HA | title = Relapse during continuation pharmacotherapy after acute response to ECT: a comparison of usual care versus protocolized treatment | journal = Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists | volume=19 | issue=1 | year=2007 | pages=1–4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17146008  | author-separator =, | last1 = Kellner | author-name-separator=  | first1 = CH| doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.12.1337 | last2 = Knapp | first2 = RG | last3 = Petrides | first3 = G | last4 = Rummans | first4 = TA | last5 = Husain | first5 = MM | last6 = Rasmussen | first6 = K | last7 = Mueller | first7 = M | last8 = Bernstein | first8 = HJ | last9 = O'Connor | first9 = K | title = Continuation electroconvulsive therapy vs pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention in major depression: a multisite study from the Consortium for Research in Electroconvulsive Therapy (CORE) | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume=63 | issue=12 | year=2006 | month=December | pages=1337–44}}</ref>

===Probability of remission===
The 1999 [[United States Surgeon General|U.S. Surgeon General]]'s Report on Mental Health summarized psychiatric opinion at the time about the effectiveness of ECT. It stated that both clinical experience and published studies had determined ECT to be effective (with an average 60 to 70 percent [[remission (medicine)|remission]] rate) in the treatment of severe depression, some acute [[psychotic]] states, and [[mania]]. Its effectiveness had not been demonstrated in [[dysthymia]], [[substance abuse]], [[anxiety]], or [[personality disorder]]. The report stated that ECT does not have a long-term protective effect against [[suicide]] and should be regarded as a short-term treatment for an acute episode of illness, to be followed by continuation therapy in the form of drug treatment or further ECT at weekly to monthly intervals.<ref name="SG">Surgeon General (1999). [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/home.html ''Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General''], chapter 4.</ref>

A 2004 large multicentre clinical follow-up study of ECT patients in [[New York]] — describing itself as the first systematic documentation of the effectiveness of ECT in community practice in the 65 years of its use — found remission rates of only 30 to 47 percent, with 64 percent of those [[relapsing]] within six months.<ref name="Prudic04">{{cite journal |author=Prudic J, Olfson M, Marcus SC, Fuller RB, Sackeim HA |title=Effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy in community settings |journal=Biol.

===Related experimental therapeutics===
Recent research has investigated whether implantable devices such as those used in DBS ([[deep brain stimulation]]) could result in clinical improvements for patients with [[treatment-resistant depression]]. However, in North America, DBS has not been authorized as an approved, effective therapy for treatment-resistant depression.

==Adverse effects==
Aside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief [[general anesthesia]]; the United States' Surgeon General's report says that there are "no absolute health [[contraindications]]" to its use.<ref name="SG"/>{{rp|259}} Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss. The state of confusion usually disappears after a few hours. It can be tolerated by pregnant women who are not suffering major complications. It can be used with diabetic or obese patients, and with caution in those whose cancers are in remission or under control. It can be used in some immunocompromised patients. It must be used very cautiously in people with epilepsy or other neurological disorders because by its nature it provokes small tonic-clonic seizures, and so would likely not be given to a person whose epilepsy is not well controlled.<ref name="DepNet">{{cite web|url=http://www.depnet.co.in/universe1/treatment/ect/|title=Electroshock|publisher=DepNet|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref><ref name="DoctorsLounge">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorslounge.com/psychiatry/procedures/ect.htm|title=Electroconvulsive therapy&nbsp;– Electroshock (ECT)|publisher=DoctorsLounge|accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>  Some patients experience muscle soreness after ECT.  This is due to the muscle relaxants given during the procedure and rarely due to muscle activity.

===Effects on memory===
It is the purported effects of ECT on long-term memory that give rise to much of the concern surrounding its use.<ref name="Lisanby 2000"/> The acute effects of ECT can include [[amnesia]], both retrograde (for events occurring before the treatment) and anterograde (for events occurring after the treatment).<ref name="Benbow">Benbow, SM (2004) "Adverse effects of ECT".

The use of either constant or pulsing electrical impulses also varied the memory loss results in patients.

[[Retrograde amnesia]] is most marked for events occurring in the weeks or months before treatment, with one study showing that although some people lose memories from years prior to treatment, recovery of such memories was "virtually complete" by seven months post-treatment, with the only enduring loss being memories in the weeks and months prior to the treatment.<ref name="Squire">{{cite journal |author=Squire LR, Slater PC, Miller PL |title=Retrograde amnesia and bilateral electroconvulsive therapy.

Forty-six patients participated in the study, which involved neuropsychological and psychological testing before and after ECT. The study documented substantial cognitive impairment after ECT on a variety of memory tests, including "verbal memory for word lists and prose passages and visual memory of geometric designs." Based on their findings, the authors issued the following recommendation:

{{cquote|When ECT is provided to adolescents, the potential impact of such cognitive changes should be discussed with the patients and their parents or guardians in terms of implications for not only the patient's emotional functioning but cognitive functioning as well, particularly upon his or her academic performance. In summary, we argue that an individual cost-benefit analysis should be made in light of the implications of the potential benefits versus costs of ECT upon improving emotional functioning and the impact that potential memory changes may have on real-world functioning and quality of life.<ref name="duke study"/> }}

===Controversy over long-term effects on general cognition===

According to prominent ECT researcher [[Harold Sackeim]], "despite over fifty years of clinical use and ongoing controversy", until 2007 there had "never been a large-scale, prospective study of the cognitive effects of ECT."<ref name="sackeim cognitive" /> In this first-ever large-scale study (347 subjects), Sackeim and colleagues found that at least some forms (namely bilateral application and outdated sine-wave currents) of ECT "routine[ly]" lead to "adverse cognitive effects," including global cognitive deficits and memory loss, that persist for up to six months after treatment, suggesting that the induced deficits may be permanent.<ref name="sackeim cognitive">{{cite journal |author=Sackeim HA, Prudic J, Fuller R, Keilp J, Lavori PW, Olfson M |title=The cognitive effects of electroconvulsive therapy in community settings |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=244–54 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=16936712 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1301180}}</ref><ref name="breggin sackeim"/> The authors also warned that their findings did not suggest that right-unilateral ECT did not also lead to chronic cognitive deficits. 

Harold Sackeim can be seen in a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvwVRn91bAU videotaped deposition] briefly discussing the findings of this study and why, in his opinion, earlier studies had failed to find evidence of long-term harm from ECT.<ref name="sackeim video">{{cite web| url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvwVRn91bAU |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |title= The Awakening; Harold Sackeim (YouTube) |year=2004}}</ref> Despite over fifty years of clinical use, Sackeim states that prior to 2001, "the field itself never really had an opportunity to have a discussion about patients who have complaints about long-term memory loss." In this video clip, Sackeim also reveals that at a California ECT conference with 200 practitioners present, when polled as to whether they think ECT can lead to chronic cognitive deficits, two-thirds raised their hands. Sackeim says this was "almost a watershed moment for the field", and was the "first time ''publicly'' that the field itself said 'no' to the position that it can't happen."<ref name="sackeim video"/><ref name="all sackeim video">{{cite web| url=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=harold+sackeim&search_type=&aq=f|accessdate=September 22, 2009 |title= All Clips from Harold Sackeim Deposition (YouTube) |year=2004}}</ref>

In July 2007, a second study was published concluding that ECT routinely leads to chronic, substantial cognitive deficits, and the findings were not limited to any particular forms of ECT.<ref name="macqueen" /> The study, led by psychiatrist Glenda MacQueen and colleagues, found that patients treated with ECT for bipolar disorder show marked deficits across multiple cognitive domains. According to the researchers, "Subjects who had received remote ECT had further impairment on a variety of learning and memory tests when compared with patients with no past ECT. This degree of impairment could not be accounted for by illness state at the time of assessment or by differential past illness burden between patient groups." Despite the findings of chronic, global cognitive deficits in post-ECT patients, MacQueen and colleagues suggest that it is "unlikely that such findings, even if confirmed, would significantly change the risk–benefit ratio of this notably effective treatment."<ref name="macqueen"/>

Six months after the publication of the Sackeim study<ref name="sackeim cognitive" /> documenting routine, long-term memory loss after ECT, prominent ECT researcher [[Max Fink]] published a review in the journal ''Psychosomatics'' concluding that patient complaints of memory loss after ECT are "rare" and should be "characterized as [[somatoform disorders]], rather than as evidence of brain damage, thus warranting psychological treatment for such disorders."<ref name="fink cognitive">{{cite journal |author=Fink, M. |title=Complaints of loss of personal memories after electroconvulsive therapy: evidence of a somatoform disorder?|journal=Psychosomatics |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=290–93 |year=2007 |month=July–August |pmid=17600164 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.48.4.290}}</ref>  Based on his findings, Fink suggests that, "Instead of endorsing these reports as the direct consequence of ECT, especially in patients who have recovered from their depressive illness, lost their suicidal drive, and have improved social functioning, is it not more useful to accept the complaint as a somatoform disorder, explore the basis in the individual's history and experience, and offer appropriate supportive treatment?"<ref name="fink cognitive" />

Breggin, chief editor of the journal ''Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry'', is a leading critic of ECT who believes the procedure is neither safe nor effective. In a published article reviewing the findings of Harold Sackeim's 2007 study<ref name="sackeim cognitive"/> on the cognitive effects of ECT, Breggin accuses [[Max Fink]] and other pro-ECT researchers of having a history of "systematically covering up damage done to millions of [ECT] patients throughout the world."<ref name="breggin sackeim">{{cite journal |author=Breggin Peter |title=ECT Damages the Brain: Disturbing News for Patients and Shock Doctors Alike |journal=Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry. |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=83–86 |year=2007 |url=http://breggin.com/index2.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=203&Itemid=3 |doi=10.1891/152315007782021196}}</ref> He disagrees with the position that findings of chronic, global cognitive deficits should have no bearing on the risk-benefit ratio of ECT, and he believes it's important to address the "actual impact of these losses on the lives of individual patients."  In his 2007 paper, a section is entitled ''Destroying Lives'', and in it, Breggin writes, "Even when these injured people can continue to function on a superficial social basis, they nonetheless suffer devastation of their identities due to the obliteration of key aspects of their personal lives. The loss of the ability to retain and learn new material is not only humiliating and depressing but also disabling. Even when relatively subtle, these activities can disrupt routine activities of living."<ref name="breggin sackeim"/>

A study published in 2004 in the ''Journal of Mental Health'' reported that 35 to 42% of patients responding to a questionnaire reported ECT resulted in loss of intelligence.<ref name="Eliciting users' views of ECT in two mental health trusts with a user-designed questionnaire">Philpot M, Collins C, Trivedi P, Treloar A, Gallacher S, Rose D: Eliciting users' views of ECT in two mental health trusts with a user-designed questionnaire.

Peter Breggin, a psychiatrist, has published books and journal reviews of the literature purporting to show that ECT routinely causes brain damage as evidenced by a considerable list of studies in humans and animals.<ref name="breggin81">{{cite web |title=Disabling the Brain with Electroshock |year=1981 |url= |author =Breggin, Peter}}</ref> In particular, Breggin asserts that animal and human autopsy studies have shown that ECT routinely causes '''widespread pinpoint hemorrhages and scattered cell death''.'<ref name="breggin_2007" />  According to Breggin, the 1990 APA task force report on ECT ignored much of the scientific literature pointing out the negative effects of electroshock therapy. For example, in 1952 Hans Hartelius conducted and published an animal study on cats entitled ''Cerebral Changes Following Electrically Induced Convulsions'' in which a double-blind microscopic pathology examination showed that it was possible to distinguish the 8 shocked animals from the 8 non-shocked animals with remarkable accuracy based on statistically significant structural changes to the brain, including vessel wall changes, [[gliosis]], and nerve cell changes. Based on the detection of shadow cells and neuronophagia, Hartelius determined that there was irreversible damage to neurons associated with electroshock.<ref name="breggin_2007" />

Proponents argue that the addition of hyperoxygenation and refinement in technique in the last thirty years has made ECT safe, and a majority of published reviews in recent decades have reflected this position.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Folkerts H |title=Electroconvulsive therapy of depressive disorders |journal=Therapeutische Umschau |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=90–94 |year=2000 |pmid=10730103}}</ref> A 2004 study was designed to evaluate whether modern ECT techniques lead to identifiable brain damage,  In the study: "Twelve adolescent Macaca mulatta, the initial subjects in an ongoing study of the cognitive and anatomic effects of ECT and magnetic seizure therapy, were divided into cohorts of three and matched for age, weight, and sex. Each cohort was housed in a group. Within each cohort, the monkeys were randomly assigned to ECT, magnetic seizure therapy, or sham. All staff not involved in the delivery of the interventions were masked to group assignment. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of New York State Psychiatric Institute.  Interventions were performed 4 days per week for 6 weeks. A 5-week recovery period was interposed before the last intervention week to permit maturation of possible neuropathological effects. Animals were euthanized 3 days after the last intervention." Their brains were compared to monkeys undergoing anesthesia alone. According to the researchers, "None of the ECT-treated monkeys showed pathological findings."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dwork AJ, et al.|title=Absence of histological lesions in primate models of ECT and magnetic seizure therapy |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=3 |pages=576–78 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14992989 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.3.576}}</ref>

Many expert proponents of ECT maintain that the procedure is safe and does not cause brain damage. Dr. Charles Kellner, a prominent ECT researcher and former chief editor of the ''Journal of ECT'',  stated in a 2007 interview<ref name="kellner interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1028 |title=In Session with Charles H.

Dr. Kellner cites a study<ref name="100 lifetime">{{cite journal|journal= The American Journal of Psychiatry |title=Absence of cognitive impairment after more than 100 lifetime ECT treatments|volume=148 |issue=7 |year=1991 |month=july |pages=929–32 |pmid=2053635 |author=Devanand DP, Sackeim HA, et al.}}</ref> purporting to show an absence of cognitive impairment in eight subjects after more than 100 lifetime ECT treatments.  Dr. Kellner stated "Rather than cause brain damage, there is evidence that ECT may reverse some of the damaging effects of serious psychiatric illness."

===Effects in pregnancy===
If steps are taken to decrease potential risks, ECT is generally accepted to be relatively safe during all trimesters of pregnancy, particularly when compared to pharmacological treatments.<ref name=miller>{{cite journal |author=Miller LJ |title=Use of electroconvulsive therapy during pregnancy |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=444–50 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=8045538 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8045538}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Walker R, Swartz CM |title=Electroconvulsive therapy during high-risk pregnancy |journal=Gen Hosp Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=348–53 |year=1994 |month=September |pmid=7995506 |doi= 10.1016/0163-8343(94)90022-1|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ferrill MJ, Kehoe WA, Jacisin JJ |title=ECT During Pregnancy: Physiologic and Pharmacologic Considerations |journal=Convuls Ther |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=186–200 |year=1992 |pmid=11941169 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Suggested preparation for ECT during pregnancy includes a [[pelvic examination]], discontinuation of nonessential [[anticholinergic]] medication, uterine tocodynamometry, intravenous hydration, and administration of a nonparticulate [[antacid]].

== Administration ==

ECT is selected as a therapy as described above, and normally requires the informed consent of the patient.<ref name="Rudorfer">Rudorfer, MV, Henry, ME, Sackeim, HA (2003).

Whether psychiatric medications are terminated prior to treatment or maintained, varies.<ref name="Rudorfer"/>{{rp|1885}}<ref>Haskett RF and Loo C (2010) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952444/ Role of Adjunctive Psychotropic Medications during ECT in the Treatment of Depression, Mania and Schizophrenia] J ECT. 2010 September; 26(3): 196–20</ref>  However, drugs that are known to cause toxicity in combination with ECT, such as lithium, are discontinued, and [[benzodiazapenes]], which increase seizure thresholds, are either discontinued, a benzodiazapene antagonist is administered at each ECT session, or the ECT treatment is adjusted accordingly.<ref name="Rudorfer"/>{{rp|1879}}{{rp|1875}}  

The placement of electrodes, as well as the dose and duration of the stimulation is determined on a per-patient basis.<ref name="Rudorfer"/>{{rp|1881}}  

Both electrodes can be placed on the same side of the patient's head. This is known as unilateral ECT. Unilateral ECT is used first to minimize side effects (memory loss).  When electrodes are placed on both sides of the head, this is known as bilateral ECT. In bifrontal ECT, an uncommon variation, the electrode position is somewhere between bilateral and unilateral.   Unilateral is thought to cause fewer cognitive effects than bilateral but is considered less effective if the dose administered is close to the seizure threshold.<ref name="Rudorfer"/>{{rp|1881}}    In the USA most patients receive bilateral ECT.<ref name="Prudic 01">{{cite journal |author=Prudic J, Olfson M, Sackeim HA |title=Electro-convulsive therapy practices in the community |journal=Psychol Med |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=929–34 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11459391 |doi= 10.1017/S0033291701003750|url=}}</ref>  In the UK almost all patients receive bilateral ECT.<ref name="Duffett">{{cite journal |author=Duffett R, Lelliott P |title=Auditing electroconvulsive therapy.

The electrodes deliver an electrical stimulus. The stimulus levels recommended for ECT are in excess of an individual's [[seizure threshold]]: about one and a half times seizure threshold for bilateral ECT and up to 12 times for unilateral ECT.<ref name="Rudorfer"/>{{rp|1881}}  Below these levels treatment may not be effective in spite of a seizure, while doses massively above threshold level, especially with bilateral ECT, expose patients to the risk of more severe [[mental function|cognitive impairment]] without additional therapeutic gains.<ref name="Lock"/> Seizure threshold is determined by trial and error ("dose titration"). Some psychiatrists use dose titration, some still use "fixed dose" (that is, all patients are given the same dose) and others compromise by roughly estimating a patient's threshold according to age and sex.<ref name="Prudic 01"/> Older men tend to have higher thresholds than younger women, but it is not a hard and fast rule, and other factors, for example drugs, affect seizure threshold.

Immediately prior to treatment, a patient is given a short-acting anesthetic such as [[methohexital]], [[etomidate]], or [[thiopental]],<ref name="Rudorfer"/> a muscle relaxant such as [[suxamethonium]] (succinylcholine), and occasionally [[atropine]] to inhibit salivation.  The patient's EEG, ECG, and blood oxygen levels are monitored during treatment.<ref name="Rudorfer"/>{{rp|1882}}

ECT is usually administered three times a week, on alternate days, over a course of two to four weeks.<ref name="Rudorfer"/>{{rp|1882-1883}}

=== ECT devices ===
[[File:Siemens konvulsator III (ECT machine).jpg|thumb|ECT machine from ca 1960.]]
Most modern ECT devices deliver a brief-pulse current, which is thought to cause fewer cognitive effects than the sine-wave currents which were originally used in ECT.<ref name="Rudorfer"/> A small minority of psychiatrists in the USA still use sine-wave stimuli.<ref name="Prudic 01"/> Sine-wave is no longer used in the UK or Ireland.<ref name="Duffett"/>
Typically, the electrical stimulus used in ECT is about 800 [[amperes|milliamps]] and has up to several hundred [[watt]]s, and the current flows for between one and 6 seconds.<ref name="Lock">Lock, T (1995). "Stimulus dosing". In C Freeman (ed.) ''The ECT Handbook''. London: Royal College of Psychiatrists, 72–87.</ref> In the USA, ECT devices are manufactured by two companies, Somatics, which is owned by psychiatrists Richard Abrams and Conrad Swartz, and [[Mecta]]. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] has classified the devices used to administer ECT as [[Medical devices#Class III: General Controls and Premarket Approval|Class III medical devices]].<!--
  --><ref>Federal Register (1979), p. 51776</ref>
Class III is the highest-risk class of medical devices.
In the UK, the market for ECT devices was long monopolized by Ectron Ltd, although in recent years some hospitals have started using American devices. Ectron Ltd was set up by psychiatrist Robert Russell, who together with a colleague from the Three Counties Asylum, Bedfordshire, invented the Page–Russell technique of intensive ECT.

=== Variations in international practice ===

There is wide variation in ECT use between different countries, different hospitals, and different psychiatrists.<ref name="Rudorfer"/> International practice varies considerably from widespread use of the therapy in many western countries to a small minority of countries that do not use ECT at all, such as Slovenia.<ref>See the [http://e-uprava.gov.si/e-uprava/en/faqKategorijaVprasanje.euprava?faq.id=74&faq.vprasanje.id=328 Slovenian government website] for information about ECT in Slovenia.</ref> Guidelines on the use of ECT are stringent in the USA and the UK. Modern standards are not always followed throughout the world and not all countries that use ECT have written technical standards. The use of both anesthesia and muscle relaxants is universally recommended in the administration of ECT. If anesthesia and muscle relaxants are not used the procedure is called unmodified ECT. In a minority of countries such as Japan,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Motohashi N, Awata S, Higuchi T |title=A questionnaire survey of ECT practice in university hospitals and national hospitals in Japan |journal=J ECT |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=21–3 |year=2004 |pmid=15087992 |doi=10.1097/00124509-200403000-00005}}</ref> India,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chanpattana W, Kunigiri G, Kramer BA, Gangadhar BN |title=Survey of the practice of electroconvulsive therapy in teaching hospitals in India |journal=J ECT |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=100–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15905751 |doi=10.1097/01.yct.0000166634.73555.e6}}</ref> and Nigeria,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ikeji OC, Ohaeri JU, Osahon RO, Agidee RO |title=Naturalistic comparative study of outcome and cognitive effects of unmodified electro-convulsive therapy in schizophrenia, mania and severe depression in Nigeria |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=76 |issue=11 |pages=644–50 |year=1999 |pmid=10734527 |doi= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&uid=10734527&cmd=showdetailview&indexed=google}}</ref> ECT may be used without anesthesia.

</ref> A small minority of countries never seek consent before administering ECT. This significantly uneven application of ECT around the world continues to make ECT a controversial procedure.

Sarah Hall reports, "ECT has been dogged by conflict between psychiatrists who swear by it, and some patients and families of patients who say that their lives have been ruined by it. It is controversial in some European countries such as the Netherlands and Italy, where its use is severely restricted".<ref name="Sarah Hall">[http://mindfreedomireland.com/new/index.php?view=article&catid=1%3Aadministrator&id=196%3Arise-in-electric-shock-therapy-in-county&format=pdf&option=com_content&Itemid=19 Rise In Electric Shock Therapy In County.] Sarah Hall, Norwich Evening News 24, June 4, 2008.

==== United States ====

ECT became popular in the United States in the 1940s. At this time psychiatric hospitals were overrun with patients whom doctors were desperate to treat and cure. The practices of ECT and lobotomies became popular because they held some promise of addressing the overpopulation problem. Whereas lobotomies would reduce a patient to a more manageable submissive state ECT helped to improve mood in those with severe depression.  In the United States, a survey of psychiatric practice in the late 1980s found that an estimated 100,000 people received ECT annually, with wide variation between metropolitan statistical areas.<!--

Accurate statistics about the frequency, context and circumstances of ECT in the United States are difficult to obtain because only a few states have reporting laws that require the treating facility to supply state authorities with this information.<ref>

One state which does report such data is Texas, where in the mid-1990s ECT was used in about one third of psychiatric facilities and given to about 1,650 people annually.<ref name="Reid">{{cite journal |author=Reid WH, Keller S, Leatherman M, Mason M |title=ECT in Texas: 19 months of mandatory reporting |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=8–13 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=9491059 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v59n0103|url=}}</ref>
Usage of ECT has since declined slightly; in 2000–01 ECT was given to about 1,500 people aged from 16 to 97 (in Texas it is illegal to give ECT to anyone under sixteen).<ref>Texas Department of State (2002) [http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/mhquality/ECT_Complete_Report_FY01.pdf Electroconvulsive therapy reports].</ref> ECT is more commonly used in private psychiatric hospitals than in public hospitals, and minority patients are underrepresented in the ECT statistics.<ref name="Rudorfer"/>
In the United States, ECT is usually given three times a week; in the UK, it is usually given twice a week.<ref name="Rudorfer"/> Occasionally it is given on a daily basis.<ref name="Rudorfer"/> A course usually consists of 6–12 treatments, but may be more or fewer. Following a course of ECT some patients may be given continuation or maintenance ECT with further treatments at weekly, fortnightly or monthly intervals.<ref name="Rudorfer"/> A few psychiatrists in the USA use multiple-monitored ECT (MMECT) where patients receive more than one treatment per anesthetic.<ref name="Rudorfer"/> Electroconvulsive therapy is not a required subject in US medical schools and not a required skill in psychiatric residency training. Privileging for ECT practice at institutions is a local option, no national certification standards are established, and no ECT-specific continuing training experiences are required of ECT practitioners.<ref name="Fink2007">Fink, M. & Taylor, A.M.

==== United Kingdom ====

In the United Kingdom in 1980, an estimated 50,000 people received ECT annually, with use declining steadily since then<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pippard J, Ellam L |title=Electroconvulsion treatment in Great Britain 1980 |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8256 |pages=1160–1 |year=1981 |pmid=6118592 |doi=}}</ref> to about 12,000 per annum in 2002.<ref name=UKstats2002 /> It is still used in nearly all psychiatric hospitals, with a survey of ECT use from 2002 finding that 71 percent of patients were women and 46 percent were over 65 years of age. Eighty-one percent had a diagnosis of mood disorder; schizophrenia was the next most common diagnosis. Sixteen percent were treated without their consent.<ref name=UKstats2002>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110605142554/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Statistics/StatisticalWorkAreas/Statisticalhealthcare/DH_4000216 Electro convulsive therapy: survey covering the period from January 2002 to March 2002]. . Department of Health.</ref> In 2003, the [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]], a government body which was set up to standardize treatment throughout the National Health Service in [[England]] and [[Wales]], issued guidance on the use of ECT. Its use was recommended "only to achieve rapid and short-term improvement of severe symptoms after an adequate trial of treatment options has proven ineffective and/or when the condition is considered to be potentially life-threatening in individuals with severe depressive illness, catatonia or a prolonged manic episode".<ref name="nice intro">

The guidance received a mixed reception. It was welcomed by an editorial in the British Medical Journal<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7403.1343 | last1 = Carney | first1 = S | last2 = Geddes | first2 = J | year = 2003 | title = Electroconvulsive therapy: recent recommendations are likely to improve standards and uniformity of use | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 326 | issue = 7403| pages = 1343–4 | pmid = 12816798 | pmc = 1126234 }}</ref> but the Royal College of Psychiatrists launched an unsuccessful appeal.<ref>NICE (2003).

London: NICE.</ref> The NICE guidance, as the British Medical Journal editorial points out, is only a policy statement and psychiatrists may deviate from it if they see fit. Adherence to standards has not been universal in the past. A survey of ECT use in 1980 found that more than half of ECT clinics failed to meet minimum standards set by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, with a later survey in 1998 finding that minimum standards were largely adhered to, but that two-thirds of clinics still fell short of current guidelines, particularly in the training and supervision of junior doctors involved in the procedure.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1192/bjp.172.5.401 | last1 = Duffett | first1 = R | last2 = Lelliot | first2 = P | year = 1998 | title = Auditing electroconvulsive therapy: the third cycle | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/172/5/401 | journal = [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] | volume = 172 | issue = 5| pages = 401–405 | pmid=9747401}}</ref> A voluntary accreditation scheme, ECTAS, was set up in 2004 by the Royal College, but as of 2006 only a minority of ECT clinics in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have signed up.<ref>Royal College of Psychiatrists (2006).

==== India ====
The Union Health Ministry of India has decided in the Mental Health Care Bill of 2010 that they will no longer use direct ECT. The Health Ministry recommended a ban on the whole procedure.<ref>Electroshocks for mentally ill patients to be banned (2011). [http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Electroshocks-for-mentally-ill-patients-to-be-banned/766051/] Teena Thacker</ref>

== Legal status ==

=== Informed consent ===

It is widely acknowledged internationally that obtaining the written, [[informed consent]] of the patient is important before ECT is administered. The [[World Health Organization]], in its 2005 publication "Human Rights and Legislation WHO Resource Book on Mental Health," specifically states, "ECT should be administered only after obtaining informed consent."<ref name="who.int"/>

In the US, this doctrine places a legal obligation on a doctor to make a patient aware of: the reason for treatment, the risks and benefits of a proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of alternative treatment, and the risks and benefits of receiving no treatment. The patient is then given the opportunity to accept or reject the treatment. The form states how many treatments are recommended and also makes the patient aware that the treatment may be revoked at anytime during a course of ECT.<ref name="SG"/> The Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health states that patients should be warned that the benefits of ECT are short-lived without active continuation treatment in the form of drugs or further ECT, and that there may be some risk of permanent, severe memory loss after ECT.<ref name="SG"/> The report advises psychiatrists to involve patients in discussion, possibly with the aid of leaflets or videos, both before and during a course of ECT.

To demonstrate what he believes should be required to fully satisfy the legal obligation for informed consent, one psychiatrist, working for an anti-psychiatry organisation, has formulated his own consent form<ref>{{cite web|author=Johnson, R |date= |url=http://www.psychrights.org/Research/Digest/InformedConsent/DrJohnsonECTInformedConsent.pdf |title=An informed consent form for electroconvulsive therapy, draft 1. |publisher=PsychRights|format=PDF}}</ref>
using the consent form developed and enacted by the Texas Legislature as a model.<ref name="TX578">Texas Legislature (2004). [http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.578.htm#578.001 Health & Safety Code Chapter 578, Electroconvulsive And Other Therapies Sec.578.001].</ref>

According to the Surgeon General, involuntary treatment is uncommon in the United States and is typically used only in cases of great extremity, and only when all other treatment options have been exhausted. The use of ECT is believed to be a potentially life-saving treatment.<ref name="surgeon">[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter4/sec3_1.html Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General&nbsp;– Chapter 4]. Retrieved 2007-12-29.</ref> However, caution must be exercised in interpreting this assertion as, in an American context, there does not appear to have been any attempt to survey at national level the usage of ECT as either an elective or involuntary procedure in almost twenty years.<ref>Data from a survey by the APA's Psychiatric Activities Survey 1988-89 indicated that at that time somewhat less than 8% of U.S. psychiatrists provided ECT for their patients, although this rate was highly variable. There was no data on the usage of involuntary ECT, however. {{cite journal|last=Hermann|first=RC|coauthors=Ettner, SL, Dorwart, RA, Hoover, CW, Yeung, E|title=Characteristics of psychiatrists who perform ECT|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1998 Jul|volume=155|issue=7|pages=889–94|pmid=9659852}}. In regard to the variability in the use of ECT by psychiatrists in the U.S. Carl Salzman suggests that this may indicate a degree of professional ambivalence towards the procedure {{cite journal|last=Salzman|first=C|title=ECT, research, and professional ambivalence|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1998 Jan|volume=155|issue=1|pages=1–2|pmid=9433330|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/155/1/1}}</ref> In one of the few jurisdictions where recent statistics on ECT usage are available, a national audit of ECT by the Scottish ECT Accreditation Network indicated that 77% of patients who received the treatment in 2008 were capable of giving informed consent.<ref name="SEAN">{{cite web|url=http://www.sean.org.uk/SEANReport2009.pdf |title=The Scottish ECT Accreditation Network (SEÁN) Annual Report 2009|format=PDF |work= |year=2009 |publisher=Scottish ECT Accreditation Network| author= Fergusson G (ed) "et al." |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>

In the UK, in order for consent to be valid it requires an explanation in "broad terms" of the nature of the procedure and its likely effects.<ref>Jones, R (1996) ''Mental Health Act Manual, 5th edition.'' London: Sweet and Maxwell, page 225.</ref> One review from 2005 found that only about half of patients felt they were given sufficient information about ECT and its adverse effects<ref name="Information, consent and perceived coercion">Rose D, Wykes T, Bindman J, Fleischmann P (2005)[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/186/1/54 "Information, consent and perceived coercion: patients' perspectives on electroconvulsive therapy"]. ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' '''186''':54–59.</ref> and another survey found that about fifty percent of psychiatrists and nurses agreed with them.<ref name="Lutchman">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/09638230124779 | last1 = Lutchman | first1 = RD ''et al.'' | year = 2001 | title = Mental health professionals' attitudes towards and knowledge of electroconvulsive therapy | url = http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09638230124779 | journal = Journal of Mental Health | volume = 10 | issue = 20| pages = 141–150 }}</ref>

A 2005 study published in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' described patients' perspectives on the adequacy of informed consent before ECT.<ref name="Information, consent and perceived coercion"/> The study found that, "About half (45–55%) of patients reported they were given an adequate explanation of ECT, implying a similar percentage felt they were not." The authors also stated:

{{quote|"Approximately a third did not feel they had freely consented to ECT even when they had signed a consent form. The proportion who feel they did not freely choose the treatment has actually increased over time. The same themes arise whether the patient had received treatment a year ago or 30 years ago. Neither current nor proposed safeguards for patients are sufficient to ensure informed consent with respect to ECT, at least in England and Wales."<ref name="Information, consent and perceived coercion" />}}

=== Involuntary ECT ===

Procedures for involuntary ECT vary from country to country depending on local [[mental health law]]s. Legal proceedings are required in some countries, while in others ECT is seen as another form of treatment that may be given involuntarily as long as legal conditions are observed. Involuntary electroshock contravenes the principle of autonomy in [[medical ethics]]. The maxim of autonomy is "Voluntas aegroti suprema lex." This rule states that the will of the patient is supreme. It implies that a patient has the right to consent to, or to refuse a medical treatment, such as ECT.  Persons considered not to be of sound mind are in many jurisdictions considered incapable of giving true consent. In such a case, the patient's "assent" may be sought; opinions are divided as to whether this should be routinely done, or whether a patient who is not competent to consent to therapy should retain the right to refuse it.

Citizens in western societies often undergo emergency medical procedures when they have lost the capacity to consent (such as neurosurgery after head injury). Under these circumstances, the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence must be adhered to.

====United States====
In most states in the USA, a judicial order following a formal hearing is needed before a patient can be forced to undergo involuntary ECT. Patients may be represented by legal counsel at the hearing. According to the Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health, "As a rule, the law requires that such petitions are granted only where the prompt institution of ECT is regarded as potentially lifesaving, as in the case of a person in grave danger because of lack of food or fluid intake caused by [[catatonia]]."<ref name="SG"/> However, ECT can also be involuntarily administered in situations with less immediate danger. Suicidal intent is a common justification for its involuntary use, especially when other treatments are ineffective.

====United Kingdom====
Until 2009 in England and Wales, the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] allowed the use of ECT on detained patients whether or not they had [[capacity (law)|capacity]] to consent to it. However, following [[Mental Health Act 2007|amendments]] which took effect in 2009, ECT may not generally be given to a patient who has capacity and refuses it, irrespective of his or her detention under the Act.<ref>[http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/mental_health_act_1983_201107084458_0.pdf The Mental Health Act 1983 (updated version)] Part IV, Section 58. [[Care Quality Commission]]</ref> In fact, even if a patient is deemed to lack capacity, if they made a valid [[Advance health care directive|advance decision]] refusing ECT then they should not be given it; and even if they do not have an advance decision, the psychiatrist must obtain an independent second opinion (which is also the case if the patient is under age of consent).<ref>Care Quality Commission (2010) [http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/20110609_mha_ect_leaflet_revised.pdf ECT: Your rights about consent to treatment]</ref> However, there is an exception regardless of consent and capacity; under Section 62 of the [[Mental Health Act 1983|Act]], if the treating psychiatrist says the need for treatment is urgent they may start a course of ECT without authorization.<ref>[http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/mental_health_act_1983_201107084458_0.pdf The Mental Health Act 1983 (updated version)] Part IV, Section 62.

== Patient experience ==

NICE ECT guidelines report that some individuals consider ECT to have been a beneficial and lifesaving treatment, while others reported feelings of terror, shame and distress, and found it positively harmful and an abusive invasion of personal [[autonomy]], especially when administered without their [[consent]].

=== Individual positive depictions ===

[[Katharine D. Dukakis|Kitty Dukakis]], wife of politician [[Michael Dukakis]], reports in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article mostly positive effects from electroconvulsive therapy, and regards memory loss as an acceptable price to pay for relief from depression.

{{quote|For me, the memory issues are real but manageable. Things I lose generally come back. Other memories I prefer to lose, including those about the depression I was suffering. But there are some memories—of meetings I have attended, people's homes I have visited—that I don't want to lose but I can't help it. They generally involve things I did two weeks before and two weeks after ECT. Often they are just wiped out....I have learned ways to partly compensate for whatever loss I still experience. I call my sister Jinny, Michael and my kids, asking what my niece Betsy's phone number is, what we did yesterday and what we are planning to do tomorrow. I apologize prior to asking. I wonder when they are going to run out of patience with "Kitty being Kitty." I hate losing memories, which means losing control over my past and my mind, but the control ECT gives me over my disabling depression is worth this relatively minor cost. It just is.<ref name="dukakis newsweek">{{cite journal | last1 = Dukakis | first1 = K | last2 = Tye | first2 = L | year = 2006 | title =  | url = | journal = September | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 62–63 }}</ref>}}

American psychotherapist Martha Manning's autobiographical ''Undercurrents''<ref>{{cite book | last = Manning | first = Martha | title = Undercurrents: A Therapist's Reckoning with Her Own Depression | publisher = Harper San Francisco | month =  March | year =  1996 | isbn = 978-0-06-251184-3}}</ref> acknowledges the downside of treatment: "I felt like I'd been hit by a truck for a while, but that was, comparatively speaking, not so bad," as well as the upside: "Afterwards, I thought, do regular people feel this way all the time? It's like you've not been in on a great joke for the whole of your life."

In his autobiographical book ''Electroboy'', American writer [[Andy Behrman]] describes undergoing ECT as a treatment for bipolar disorder while under house-arrest: "I wake up thirty minutes later and think I am in a hotel in Acapulco. My head feels as if I have just downed a frozen margarita too quickly. My jaws and limbs ache. But I am elated."<ref>{{cite book | last = Behrman | first = Andy | title = Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania | publisher = Random House | month = February | year = 2003| isbn = 978-0-8129-6708-1}}</ref>

Curtis Hartmann, a lawyer in western Massachusetts, stated: "ECT, a treatment of last resort for severe, debilitating depression, is all that has ever worked for me. I awaken about 20 minutes later, and although I am still groggy with anesthesia, much of the hellish depression is gone. It is a disease that for me, literally steals me from myself—a disease that executes me and then forces me to stand and look down at my corpse. Thankfully, ECT has kept my monster at bay, my hope intact".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/53/4/413 |title=Personal Accounts: Life as Death: Hope Regained With ECT&nbsp;– Hartmann '&#39;'53'&#39;'(4): 413&nbsp;– Psychiatr Serv |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.53.4.413 |publisher=Psychservices.psychiatryonline.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

[[Beverley Callard]] is a British actress, best known for her role as [[Liz McDonald]] in [[Coronation Street]]. In her recently published autobiography titled "Unbroken", she describes her experience with ECT for severe depression, stating that the treatment was in part responsible for her recovery.<ref>{{cite book | last = Callard| first = Beverley| title = Unbroken | publisher = Hodder | month = February | year = 2010| isbn = 978-1-4447-0527-0}}</ref>

[[Carrie Fisher]], an American actress and author best known for her role as [[Princess Leia]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', praises ECT as an ongoing treatment for her [[bipolar disorder]] in her autobiographical books ''[[Wishful Drinking]]'' and ''Shockaholic''.

[[Kay Redfield Jamison|Kay Redfield Jamieson]] also wrote about the experience of having ECT as a positive experience, that relieved her from the crushing pain of untreatable depression.

==== Depictions of severe long-term, permanent memory loss ====

[[Ernest Hemingway]], American author, committed suicide shortly after ECT at the Mayo Clinic in 1961. He is reported to have said to his biographer, "Well, what is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory, which is my capital, and putting me out of business? It was a brilliant cure but we lost the patient...."<ref>[[A. E. Hotchner]], ''Papa Hemingway: A Personal Memoir'', ISBN 0-7867-0592-2; pg 280</ref>

In a poem, ''The Hanging Man'', by [[Sylvia Plath]] ECT is described:
::By the roots of my hair some god got hold of me.
::I sizzled in his blue volts like a desert prophet.
::The nights snapped out of sight like a lizard's eyelid:
::A world of bald white days in a shadeless socket.
::A vulturous boredom pinned me in this tree.
::If he were I, he would do what I did.

In a letter to the editor published in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in December, 2000, registered nurse Barbara C. Cody wrote that her life was forever changed by 13 outpatient ECTs she received in 1983. She wrote, <blockquote>"Shock 'therapy' totally and permanently disabled me. EEGs [electroencephalograms] verify the extensive damage shock did to my brain. Fifteen to 20 years of my life were simply erased; only small bits and pieces have returned. I was also left with short-term memory impairment and serious cognitive deficits. ...  Shock 'therapy' took my past, my college education, my musical abilities, even the knowledge that my children were, in fact, my children. I call ECT a rape of the soul."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cody|first=Barbara|title=Letters in response to "Shock Therapy: It's Back (Wash.

Similarly, writer Johnanton Cott claims to have completely lost 15 years of memory in ''On the Sea of Memory: A Journey from Forgetting to Remembering.''<ref>Johnanton Cott, ''On the Sea of Memory: A Journey from Forgetting to Remembering'' Random House, October 4, 2005, ISBN 1-4000-6058-3, ISBN 978-1-4000-6058-0</ref>

Despite former patients having reported devastating, permanent amnesia and cognitive impairment since ECT was first invented, the first lawsuit for ECT amnesia, Marilyn Rice v. John Nardini, was not brought until 1975; dozens of suits followed. While there have been a few settlements, including one for half a million dollars, no former patient had won a case until 2005.  In a 2005 South Carolina court proceeding, Peggy S. Salters became the first ECT survivor to win a jury verdict and compensation. Ms. Salters sued Palmetto Baptist Medical Center in Columbia, as well as the three doctors responsible for her care, for an intensive course of outpatient ECT that she received in 2000, at age 55 years old, that caused her to lose all memories of the past 30 years of her life, including all memories of her husband of three decades, then deceased, and the births of her three children. She held a Masters of Science in nursing and, prior to the ECT, had a long career as a psychiatric nurse; but, as a result of the ECT, lost her knowledge of nursing skills and was unable to return to work. The jury awarded Salters $635,177 in compensation for her inability to work.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.peoplewho.org/documents/ctip.ectverdict.htm |title=ECT verdict awards dollar judgment |publisher=Peoplewho.org |date=June 17, 2005 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>  The judgement was upheld upon appeal in an unpublished opinion.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2007-UP-187| title=2007-UP-187 - Salters v.

====Accounts of severe cognitive diminishment====
Liz Spikol, the senior contributing editor of ''[[Philadelphia Weekly]]'', wrote of her ECT in 1996, <blockquote>"Not only was the ECT ineffective, it was incredibly damaging to my cognitive functioning and memory. But sometimes it's hard to be sure of yourself when everyone 'credible' — scientists, ECT docs, researchers — are telling you that your reality isn't real. How many times have I been told my memory loss wasn't due to ECT but to depression? How many times have I been told that, like a lot of other consumers, I must be perceiving this incorrectly? How many times have people told me that my feelings of trauma related to the ECT are misplaced and unusual? It's as if I was raped and people kept telling me not to be upset—that it wasn't that bad."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trouble.philadelphiaweekly.com/archives/2006/12/funday_ect_stud.html |title=Funday: ECT study shocks.

==== Involuntary or other problems in administrating ECT ====
ECT received a lot of bad press much like psychosurgery did. There were cases publicized of it being administered improperly. The news would boast examples of ECT being used as a means of punishment for patients in mental institutions with chronic behavior problems. At times these treatments were even administered without proper anesthetics or restraints.<ref name=Sabbatini>{{cite web|last=Sabbatini|first=R.|title=The history of shock therapy in psychiatry|url=http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n04/historia/shock_i.htm|accessdate=4/24/13}}</ref> In 2007, a judge canceled a two-year-old court order that allowed the involuntary electroshock of Simone D., a psychiatric patient at [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center]] in the state of New York.<ref name="MFIVict">[[MindFreedom International]].

In 2008, David Tarloff, a psychiatric patient who had received electroshock, assaulted two therapists in the city of New York. Tarloff injured one therapist and killed the other. One of the therapists was Kent Shinbach, a psychiatrist who had an interest in electroconvulsive therapy.

== Public perception and mass media ==

A questionnaire survey of 379 members of the general public in [[Australia]] indicated that more than 60% of respondents had some knowledge about the main aspects of ECT. Participants were generally opposed to the use of ECT on depressed individuals with psychosocial issues, on children, and on involuntary patients. Public perceptions of ECT were found to be mainly negative.<ref name=Teh>{{cite journal | last1=Teh | first1= S.P.C. | last2= Helmes | first2= E. | last3= Drake | first3= D. |year=2007 |url=http://isp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/53/3/247 |title=A Western Australian Survey On Public Attitudes Toward and Knowledge of Electroconvulsive Therapy |journal= International Journal of Social Psychiatry |volume= 53 |issue= 3 |pages= 247–271 |doi= 10.1177/0020764006074522 }}</ref>
