'''Veterinary oncology''' is a subspecialty of [[veterinary medicine]] that deals with cancer diagnosis and treatment in animals. Cancer is a major cause of death in pet animals. In one study, 45% of the dogs that reached 10 years of age or older died of cancer.<ref>Withrow, Stephen J. "Why worry about cancer in pets?" in Withrow, Stephen J., and MacEwen, E. Gregory, eds. Small Animal Clinical Oncology. 4th ed. Philadelphia, PA: W.B. Saunders, c2007, pp. xv-xvii.</ref>

[[Skin]] [[tumors]] are the most frequently diagnosed type of tumor in domestic animals for two reasons: 1. constant exposure of animal skin to the sun and external environment, 2. skin tumors are easy to see because they are on the outside of the animal.<ref>Tumors of the Skin and Soft Tissues: Introduction, The Merck Veterinary Manual http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/72200.htm&word=neoplasm</ref>

==Human-animal cancer connections==

Companion animals such as dogs and cats suffer from many of the same types of cancer as humans. Cancer research with dogs has helped in the design of [[clinical trials]] for cancer therapy for humans. In the spirit of the [[One Health]] movement (global collaborative research on human and animal health) such human-animal connections in cancer research could benefit both humans and animals with cancer in the future.<ref>Thamm, Douglas  & Steven Dow "How companion animals contribute to the fight against cancer in humans" Veterinaria Italiana. 2009; 45(1): 111-120. http://www.izs.it/vet_italiana/2009/45_1/111.htm. accessed March 3, 2012.</ref><ref>Withrow, Stephen J. "Why worry about cancer in pets?" in Withrow, Stephen J., and MacEwen, E. Gregory, eds. Small Animal Clinical Oncology. 4th ed. Philadelphia, PA: W.B. Saunders, c2007, pp. xv-xvii.</ref>

Animals with cancer also sometimes function as [[animal sentinels]] that provide an early warning of [[carcinogens]] and an environmental health hazard to humans.<ref>Rabinowitz, Peter, Matthew Scotch & Lisa Conti "Human and animal sentinels for shared health risks" Veterinaria Italiana. 2009; 45(1): 23-34.http://www.izs.it/vet_italiana/2009/45_1/23.htm. accessed March 3, 2012.</ref><ref>Withrow, Stephen J., and MacEwen, E. Gregory, eds. Small Animal Clinical Oncology. 4th ed. Philadelphia, PA: W.B. Saunders, c2007, pp. 12-15.</ref>

==Ethical issues==

[[Veterinarians]] use the HHHHHMM Scale to discuss animal [[quality of life]] with pet owners before a [[euthanasia]] decision is made for a pet with an incurable disease such as cancer (the letters stand for Hurt Hunger Hydration Hygiene Happiness Mobility and "More good days than bad days")<ref>The Merck/Merial Manual For Pet Health: The complete health resource for your dog, cat, horse or other pets - in everyday language, eds. Cynthia M. Kahn, Scott Line, Merck & Co., Inc., 2007, ISBN 0-911910-99-9, ISBN 978-0-911910-99-5, p. 1250.</ref><ref>Villalobos, A.E., Quality of Life Scale Helps Make Final Call, Veterinary Practice News, September 2004 in Canine and Feline Geriatric Oncology Honoring the Human-Animal Bond, Blackwell Publishing, Table 10.1, 2006 Adaption: http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/vet-practice-news-columns/bond-beyond/quality-of-life-scale.aspx</ref>
