'''Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia''' (also called '''lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis''' or '''LIP''') is a syndrome secondary to [[autoimmune]] and other [[lymphoproliferative]] disorders.  Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia applies to a disorders associated with both, monoclonal or polyclonal [[gammopathy]].<ref>The Pathology of Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias Carol Farver, MD</ref>

== Symptoms ==

In patients with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, these patients may present with [[lymphadenopathy]], enlarged [[liver]], enlarged [[spleen]], enlarged [[salivary gland]], thickening and widening of the extremities of the fingers and toes (clubbing), and breathing symptoms such as shortness of breath and wheezing.

== Diagnosis ==

[[Arterial]] blood gases may reveal [[hypoxemia]] when tested in a lab.  [[Respiratory alkalosis]] may also be present.<ref>Teirstein AS, Rosen MJ. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Clin Chest Med 1988;9:467-471</ref>  Peripheral lymphocytosis can be observed. <ref>Pitt J. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Pediatr Clin N Am 1991;38:89-95.</ref>A lung biopsy may also be indicated.<ref>Strimlan CV, Rosenow EC, Weiland LH, Brown LR. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Review of 13 cases. Ann Intern Med 1978;88:616-621</ref>

== Causes ==

Possible causes of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia include the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] and [[HIV|Human Immunodeficiency Virus]].  

== Treatment ==

Patients presenting with no symptoms, and not affected by the syndrome may not require treatment.  However, antibiotics are usually required for bacterial pulmonary infections.  [[Bronchodilator|Bronchodilators]] may assist with breathing issues and resolution may occur with the use of [[HAART|Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy]].  However, responses to different treatments are widely varied, and no single first line treatment represents the default treatment for lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.<ref>Teirstein AS, Rosen MJ.
