:''Not to be confused with Berger's disease ([[IgA nephropathy]])''
 
'''Thromboangiitis obliterans'''  (also known as '''Buerger's disease''' and '''Presenile gangrene'''<ref name=ferri>{{cite book|last=Ferri|first=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2004: Instant Diagnosis and Treatment. 6th edition|year=2003|isbn=0323026680|pages=840}}</ref> ) is a recurring progressive [[inflammation]] and [[thrombosis]] (clotting) of small and medium [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s of the hands and feet. It is strongly associated with use of [[tobacco]] products,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Joyce JW | title=Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) | journal=Rheum Dis Clin North Am | year=1990 | pages=463–70 | volume=16 | issue=2 | pmid=2189162 }}</ref> primarily from [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], but also from [[smokeless tobacco]].

==Signs and symptoms==
There is a recurrent acute and chronic [[inflammation]] and [[thrombosis]] of [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s of the hands and feet. The main symptom is [[pain]] in the affected areas, at rest and while walking ([[claudication]]).<ref name=ferri /> The impaired circulation increases sensitivity to cold. Peripheral [[pulse]]s are diminished or absent. There are color changes in extremity. The colour may range from [[Cyanosis|cyanotic blue]] to reddish blue. Skin becomes thin and shiny. Hair growth is reduced. [[Ulcer (dermatology)|Ulcerations]] and [[gangrene]] in the extremities are common [[Complication (medicine)|complication]]s, often resulting in the need for [[amputation]] of the involved extremity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Porth|first=Carol|title=Essentials of Pathophysiology: Concepts of Altered Health States, 2nd ed|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams&Wilkins|isbn=9780781770873|pages=264}}</ref> 

==Pathophysiology==
There are characteristic [[pathology|pathologic]] findings of acute [[inflammation]] and [[thrombosis]] (clotting) of [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s of the hands and feet (the lower limbs being more common). The mechanisms underlying Buerger's disease are still largely unknown, but smoking and tobacco consumption are major factors associated with it. It has been suggested that the tobacco may trigger an immune response in susceptible persons or it may unmask a clotting defect, either of which could incite an inflammatory reaction of the vessel wall.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pathology and pathogenesis of Buerger's disease.|journal=Int J Cardiol|year=1998|volume=66|pmid=9951825|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> This eventually leads to [[vasculitis]] and [[ischemic]] changes in [[distal]] parts of limbs. 

A possible role for ''[[Rickettsia]]'' in this disease has been proposed.<ref name=Fazeli2011>{{cite journal |author=Fazeli B, Ravari H, Farzadnia M |title=Does a species of Rickettsia play a role in the pathophysiology of Buerger's disease? |journal=Vascular |year=2011 |month=July |pmid=21803838 |doi=10.1258/vasc.2011.cr0271 |url=http://vascular.rsmjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21803838}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

A concrete diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans is often difficult as it relies heavily on exclusion of other conditions. The commonly followed diagnostic criteria are outlined below although the criteria tend to differ slightly from author to author. Olin (2000) proposes the following criteria:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olin JW |title=Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=343 |issue=12 |pages=864–9 |year=2000 |month=September |pmid=10995867 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM200009213431207|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=10995867&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref>
# Typically between 20–40 years old and male, although recently females have been diagnosed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas of Clinical Diagnosis 2e|year=2003|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780702026683|pages=238}}</ref> 
# Current (or recent) history of tobacco use.
# Presence of distal extremity [[ischemia]] (indicated by [[claudication]], pain at rest, ischemic ulcers or gangrene) documented by noninvasive vascular testing such as ultrasound.
# Exclusion of other autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and diabetes mellitus by laboratory tests.
# Exclusion of a proximal source of emboli by echocardiography and arteriography.
# Consistent arteriographic findings in the clinically involved and noninvolved limbs.

Buerger’s disease can be mimicked by a wide variety of other diseases that cause diminished blood flow to the extremities. These other disorders must be ruled out with an aggressive evaluation, because their treatments differ substantially from that of Buerger’s disease. For Buerger’s there is no treatment known to be effective.

Diseases with which Buerger’s disease may be confused include atherosclerosis (build-up of cholesterol plaques in the arteries), endocarditis (an infection of the lining of the heart), other types of vasculitis, severe [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] associated with connective tissue disorders (e.g., lupus or scleroderma), clotting disorders of the blood, and others.

]]
Angiograms of the upper and lower extremities can be helpful in making the diagnosis of Buerger’s disease. In the proper clinical setting, certain angiographic findings are diagnostic of Buerger’s. These findings include a “corkscrew” appearance of arteries that result from vascular damage, particularly the arteries in the region of the wrists and ankles. Collateral circulation gives "tree root" or "spider leg" appearance.<ref name=ferri /> Angiograms may also show occlusions (blockages) or stenosis (narrowings) in multiple areas of both the arms and legs. Distal [[plethysmograph|plethysmography]] also yields useful information about circulatory status in [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]].
To rule out other forms of vasculitis (by excluding involvement of vascular regions atypical for Buerger’s), it is sometimes necessary to perform angiograms of other body regions (e.g., a mesenteric angiogram).

Skin biopsies of affected extremities are rarely performed because of the frequent concern that a biopsy site near an area poorly perfused with blood will not heal well.

==Treatment==
Smoking cessation has shown to slow the progression of the disease and decrease the severity of amputation in most patients, but does not halt the progression.

[[File:Barokomora Nis hyperbaric center.JPG|thumb|Treatment by 100% hyperbaric oxygen.]]In [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] cases, drugs and procedures which cause vasodilation are effective in reducing pain experienced by patient. For example, [[prostaglandins]] like Limaprost<ref>{{cite journal |author=Matsudaira K, Seichi A, Kunogi J, ''et al.'' |title=The efficacy of prostaglandin E1 derivative in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis |journal=Spine |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=115–20 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19112336 |doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e31818f924d |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0362-2436&volume=34&issue=2&spage=115}}</ref> are vasodilators and gives relief in pain, but do not help in changing the course of disease. [[Epidural anesthesia]] and [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] also have vasodilator effect.<ref name=ferri />

In [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] cases, [[Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy#Procedure|Lumbar sympathectomy]] may be occasionally helpful.<ref>{{cite book|title=Clinical Surgery, 2e|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118343951}}</ref> It reduces vasoconstriction and increases blood flow to limb. It aids in healing and giving relief from pain of ischemic ulcers.<ref name=ferri />  [[Vascular surgery|Bypass]] can sometimes be helpful in treating limbs with poor perfusion secondary to this disease.  Use of vascular growth factor and stem cell injections have been showing promise in clinical studies. [[Debridement]] is done in necrotic ulcers. In gangrenous [[Digit (anatomy)|digit]]s, amputation is frequently required. [[Amputation#Types|Above-knee]] and [[Amputation#Types|below-knee]] amputation is rarely required.<ref name=ferri />

[[Streptokinase]] has been proposed as adjuvant therapy in some cases.<ref name=pmid8473086>{{cite journal |author=Hussein EA, el Dorri A |title=Intra-arterial streptokinase as adjuvant therapy for complicated Buerger's disease: early trials |journal=International surgery |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=54–8 |year=1993 |pmid=8473086 |doi=}}</ref>

Despite the clear presence of inflammation in this disorder, [[anti-inflammatory]] agents such as [[corticosteroids]] have not been shown to be beneficial in healing, but do have significant anti-inflammatory and pain relief qualities in low dosage intermittent form. Similarly, strategies of [[anticoagulation]] have not proven effective.

==Prognosis==
Buerger's is not immediately fatal.  Amputation is common and major amputations (of limbs rather than fingers/toes) are almost twice as common in patients who continue to smoke. Prognosis markedly improves if a person quits smoking.  Female patients tend to show much higher longevity rates than men, as is in society. The only way to slow the progression of the disease is to abstain from all tobacco products. 

==Prevention==
The cause of the disease is thought to be autoimmune in nature and heavily linked to tobacco use in patients with Buerger's as primary disease. There have also been links to persons with digestive disorders.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Epidemiology==
Buerger's is more common among men than women. It is more common in [[Japan]], [[India]], and [[Manipur]] along the "old silk route" than in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The disease is most common among South Asians.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Incidence of thromboangiitis obliterans is 8 to 12 per 100,000 [[adults]] in the [[United States]] (0.75% of all patients with [[peripheral vascular disease]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==History==
Buerger's disease was first reported by [[Felix von Winiwarter]] in 1879 in [[Austria]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=von Winiwarter F |title=Ueber eine eigenthumliche Form von Endarteriitis und Endophlebitis mit Gangran des Fusses |journal=Arch Klin Chir |volume=23 |pages=202–26 |year=1879}}</ref> It wasn't until 1908, however, that the disease was given its first accurate pathological description, by [[Leo Buerger]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buerger L |title=Thrombo-angiitis obliterans: a study of the vascular lesions leading to presenile spontaneous gangrene |journal=Am J Med Sci |volume=136 |pages=567–80 |year=1908 |url=http://www.amjmedsci.com/pt/re/ajms/pdfhandler.00000441-190810000-00011.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1097/00000441-190810000-00011}} {{dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> Buerger called it "presenile spontaneous gangrene" after studying amputations in 11 patients.

==Notable sufferers==
As reported by Alan Michie in ''God Save The Queen,'' published in 1952 (see pages 194 and following), King [[George VI]] was diagnosed with the disease in late 1948 and early 1949. Both legs were affected, the right more seriously than the left. The King's doctors prescribed complete rest and electric treatment to stimulate circulation, but as they were either unaware of the connection between the disease and smoking (the King was a heavy smoker) or unable to persuade the King to stop smoking, the disease failed to respond to their treatment. On March 12, 1949, the King underwent a lumbar [[sympathectomy]], performed at [[Buckingham Palace]] by Dr. [[James R. Learmonth]]. The operation, as such, was successful, but the King was warned that it was a palliative, not a cure, and that there could be no assurance that the disease would not grow worse. From all accounts, the King continued to smoke.

The author and journalist [[John McBeth]] describes his experiences of the disease, and treatment for it, in a chapter called 'Year of the Leg' in his book entitled ''Reporter. Forty Years Covering Asia''. <ref>{{Harvnb|McBeth|2011, p254-264.|}}</ref>
