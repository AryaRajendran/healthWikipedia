The fellowship is aimed at EU medical practitioners, public-health nurses, microbiologists, veterinarians and other [[health professional]]s with previous experience in [[Public Health]] and a keen interest in [[epidemiology]].

==Aims==
<ref name=Bremer group=EPIET>{{cite web|last=Bremer|first=Viviane|title=EPIET|url=http://www.epiet.org}}</ref> The aims of the prog ramme are:
* To strengthen the surveillance of [[infectious diseases]] in EU member states and at Community level 
* To develop response capacity at national and Community level to meet communicable disease threats through rapid and effective field investigation and control 
* To develop a European network of public health epidemiologists using standard methods, and sharing common objectives 
* To contribute to the development of the Community network for the surveillance and control of communicable diseases.

==Structure==
The EPIET Fellowship lasts two years. Ten percent of this time is taken up by formal training courses and the remainder by a placement at a training site in a European country. The fellowship starts with a three-week introductory course in infectious disease [[epidemiology]]. This course provides basic knowledge of intervention epidemiology, including outbreak investigation,  
surveillance and applied research. 

Following the introductory course, fellows spend 23 months at a training site in an [[EU member state]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], the [[WHO]] or at the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]] (ECDC). During the training period, fellows will: 
*analyse, design, or implement a surveillance system
*assist in the development of international surveillance networks
*perform [[outbreak]] investigations
*develop a research project on a relevant [[public health]] issue
*develop knowledge of  laboratory techniques
*assist in the analysis of [[public health]] decisions
*teach epidemiology
*present the results of their work at the annual scientific conference [[ESCAIDE]]

In addition to the introductory course, 4-5 one-week modules are organised throughout the fellowship. The modules focus on one or several specific public health topics, such as: computer tools in [[outbreak]] investigations; multivariable regression; [[time series]] analysis; [[vaccinology]]; laboratory methods for epidemiologists.

==Funding==
The Fellowship is funded by the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]] (ECDC) and the [[EU member states]]. The ECDC took over the coordination of the programme on November 1, 2007, as the [[European Commission]] funded project components ended in 2007.
