{{Wiktionary|Respiratory rate}}
'''Respiratory rate''' (V<sub>f</sub>, R<sub>f</sub> or RR) is also known by '''respiration rate''', '''pulmonary ventilation rate''', '''ventilation rate''', or '''breathing frequency''' is the number of breaths taken within a set amount of time, typically 60 seconds. A normal respiratory rate is termed [[eupnea]], an increased respiratory rate is termed [[tachypnea]] and a lower than normal respiratory rate is termed [[bradypnea]].

==Measurement==
Human respiration rate is measured when a person is at rest and involves counting the number of breaths for one minute by counting how many times the chest rises. An optical breath rate sensor can be used for monitoring patients during a magnetic resonance imaging scan.<ref>[http://www.opticsinfobase.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-3-12-3325&id=246274)]</ref> Respiration rates may increase with [[fever]], illness, or other medical conditions. When checking respiration, it is important to also note whether a person has any difficulty breathing.

Inaccuracies in respiratory measurement have been reported in the literature. One study compared respiratory rate counted using a 90 second count period, to a full minute, and found significant differences in the rates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Another study found that rapid respiratory rates in babies, counted using a [[stethoscope]], were 60–80% higher than those counted from beside the cot without the aid of the stethoscope.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Similar results are seen with animals when they are being handled and not being handled—the invasiveness of touch apparently is enough to make significant changes in breathing.

==Normal range==
Average respiratory rate reported in a healthy adult at rest is usually given as 12–18 breaths per minute<ref>G J Tortora & N P Anagnostakos, ''Principles of Anatomy and Physiology,'' 6th edition, New York: Harper-Collins, 1990, ISBN 0-06-046669-3, p. 707</ref><ref>Lauralee Sherwood, ''Fundamentals of Physiology: A Human Perspective,'' Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2006, ISBN 0-534-46697-4, p. 380 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4INVi-m7gX8C&pg=PA380&dq=average+respiratory+rate&lr=&sig=dAOi9TGxLJwOpQ9CTCFgpWyyLxI]</ref> but estimates do vary between sources, e.g., 12–20 breaths per minute, 10–14,<ref>[http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/MEDICINE/pulmonar/PD/pstep73.htm Respiratory Rate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> between 16–18,<ref>Brian S. Beckett, ''Illustrated Human and Social Biology,'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-19-914065-0, p. 78 [http://books.google.com/books?id=-mYIPXC0gEgC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=exercise+human+breathing+rate&source=web&ots=0weEwTGZ4z&sig=3iJ2fbpkYru_eQNrbpT0vrL6jw4]</ref> etc. With such a slow rate, more accurate readings are obtained by counting the number of breaths over a full minute.

===By age===
Average resting respiratory rates by age are:<ref name="DeBoer2004">{{cite book|author=Scott L.

* birth to 6 weeks: 30–60 breaths per minute
* 6 months: 25–40 breaths per minute
* 3 years: 20–30 breaths per minute
* 6 years: 18–25 breaths per minute
* 10 years: 15–20 breaths per minute
* adults: 12–24 breaths per minute

== Minute volume ==
[[Respiratory minute volume]] is the [[volume]] of [[air]] which can be [[inhalation|inhaled]] (inhaled minute volume) or [[exhalation|exhaled]] (exhaled minute volume) from a person's [[lung]]s in one minute.

==Diagnostic value==
The value of respiratory rate as an indicator of potential respiratory dysfunction has been investigated but findings suggest it is of limited value.

One study found that only 33% of people presenting to an emergency department with an [[oxygen saturation]] below 90% had an increased respiratory rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} An evaluation of respiratory rate for the differentiation of the severity of illness in babies under 6 months found it not to be very useful. Approximately half of the babies had a respiratory rate above 50 breaths per minute, thereby questioning the value of having a "cut-off" at 50 breaths per minute as the indicator of serious respiratory illness.

It has also been reported that factors such as [[crying]], [[sleep]]ing, agitation and age have a significant influence on the respiratory rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} As a result of these and similar studies the value of respiratory rate as an indicator of serious illness is limited.
