'''Anti-diabetic medications''' treat [[diabetes mellitus]] by lowering [[glucose]] levels in the blood. With the exceptions of [[insulin]], [[exenatide]], [[liraglutide]] and [[pramlintide]], all are administered orally and are thus also called '''oral hypoglycemic agents''' or '''oral antihyperglycemic agents'''.  There are different classes of anti-diabetic drugs, and their selection depends on the nature of the diabetes, age and situation of the person, as well as other factors.

[[Diabetes mellitus type 1]] is a disease caused by the lack of insulin.  Insulin must be used in Type I, which must be injected.

[[Diabetes mellitus type 2]] is a disease of insulin resistance by cells. Treatments include (1) agents that increase the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas, (2) agents that increase the sensitivity of target organs to insulin, and (3) agents that decrease the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

Several groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, are effective in Type II, often in combination. The therapeutic combination in Type II may include insulin, not necessarily because oral agents have failed completely, but in search of a desired combination of effects.  The great advantage of injected insulin in Type II is that a well-educated patient can adjust the dose, or even take additional doses, when blood glucose levels measured by the patient, usually with a simple meter, as needed by the measured amount of sugar in the blood.

==Insulin==
{{Main|insulin}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
Insulin is usually given [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneously]], either by injections or by an [[insulin pump]]. Research of other routes of administration is underway. In acute-care settings, insulin may also be given intravenously. In general, there are three types of insulin, characterized by the rate which they are metabolized by the body. They are rapid acting insulins, intermediate acting insulins and long acting insulins.
Examples of rapid acting insulins include
* Regular insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R)
* Insulin lispro (Humalog)
* Insulin aspart (Novolog)
* Insulin glulisine (Apidra)
* Prompt insulin zinc (Semilente, Slightly slower acting)
Examples of intermediate acting insulins include
* Isophane insulin, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) (Humulin N, Novolin N)
* Insulin zinc (Lente)
Examples of long acting insulins include
* Extended insulin zinc insulin (Ultralente)
* Insulin glargine (Lantus)
* Insulin detemir (Levemir)

Most anti-diabetic agents are contraindicated in pregnancy, in which insulin is preferred.<ref name=agabegi2nd-185/>

==Sensitizers==
Insulin sensitizers address the core problem in Type II diabetes—[[insulin resistance]].

===Biguanides===
{{Main|Biguanide}}
[[Biguanide]]s reduce [[liver|hepatic]] glucose output and increase uptake of glucose by the periphery, including skeletal muscle.  Although it must be used with caution in patients with impaired liver or [[kidney]] function, [[metformin]], a biguanide, has become the most commonly used agent for type 2 diabetes in children and teenagers. Among common diabetic drugs, metformin is the only widely used oral drug that does not cause weight gain.

Typical reduction in [[glycated hemoglobin]]&nbsp;(A1C) values for metformin is 1.5–2.0%

*[[Metformin]] (Glucophage) may be the best choice for patients who also have heart failure,<ref name=pmid17761999>{{cite journal |pmid=17761999 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39314.620174.80 |year=2007 |author1=Eurich |first2=FA |first3=DF |first4=SR |first5=RT |first6=J |first7=JA |title=Benefits and harms of antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and heart failure: systematic review |volume=335 |issue=7618 |pages=497 |pmc=1971204 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |last2=McAlister |last3=Blackburn |last4=Majumdar |last5=Tsuyuki |last6=Varney |last7=Johnson}}</ref> but it should be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic procedure involving intravenous [[iodine|iodinated]] [[radiocontrast|contrast]], as patients are at an increased risk of [[lactic acidosis]].
* [[Phenformin]] (DBI) was used from 1960s through 1980s, but was withdrawn due to lactic acidosis risk.<ref name=pmid16567854>{{cite journal |pmid=16567854 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16567854 |doi=10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc06-0012 |year=2006 |author1=Fimognari |first2=R |first3=RA |title=Phenformin-induced lactic acidosis in an older diabetic patient: a recurrent drama (phenformin and lactic acidosis) |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=950–1 |journal=Diabetes Care |last2=Pastorelli |last3=Incalzi}}</ref>
* [[Buformin]] also was withdrawn due to lactic acidosis risk.<ref name=Verdonck>{{cite journal |pmid=7202882 |doi=10.1007/BF01789112 |year=1981 |author1=Verdonck |first2=B |first3=AN |first4=G |first5=RA |title=Buformin concentrations in a case of fatal lactic acidosis |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=45–6 |journal=Diabetologia |last2=Sangster |last3=Van Heijst |last4=De Groot |last5=Maes}}</ref>

Metformin is usually the first-line medication used for treatment of type 2 diabetes.  In general, it is prescribed at initial diagnosis in conjunction with exercise and weight loss, as opposed to in the past, where it was prescribed after diet and exercise had failed. There is an immediate release as well as an extended-release formulation, typically reserved for patients experiencing [[gastrointestinal|GI]] side-effects. It is also available in combination with other oral diabetic medications.

===Thiazolidinediones===
{{Main|Thiazolidinedione}}
[[Thiazolidinedione]]s ([[TZD]]s), also known as "glitazones," bind to [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPARγ]], a type of nuclear regulatory protein involved in transcription of genes regulating glucose and fat metabolism. These PPARs act on peroxysome proliferator responsive elements (PPRE).<ref>http://www.healthvalue.net/diabetesinsulinPPAR.html</ref> The PPREs influence insulin-sensitive genes, which enhance production of mRNAs of insulin-dependent enzymes. The final result is better use of glucose by the cells.

Typical reductions in [[glycated hemoglobin]]&nbsp;(A1C) values are 1.5–2.0%.  Some examples are:

*[[rosiglitazone]] (Avandia): the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended in September 2010 that it be suspended from the EU market due to elevated cardiovascular risks.<ref>European Medicines Agency, [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2010/09/news_detail_001119.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1&jsenabled=true "European Medicines Agency recommends suspension of Avandia, Avandamet and Avaglim"], ''EMA'', 23 September 2009</ref>

Multiple retrospective studies have resulted in a concern about rosiglitazone's safety, although it is established that the group, as a whole, has beneficial effects on diabetes. The greatest concern is an increase in the number of severe cardiac events in patients taking it.

Concerns about the safety of rosiglitazone arose when a retrospective meta-analysis was published in [[the New England Journal of Medicine]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa072761 |pmid=17517853 |laysummary=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18783816 |laysource=[[Associated Press]] |laydate=May 21, 2007 |year=2007 |author1=Nissen |first2=K |title=Effect of rosiglitazone on the risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes |volume=356 |issue=24 |pages=2457–71 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |last2=Wolski}}</ref> There have been a significant number of publications since then, and a [[Food and Drug Administration]] panel<ref>{{cite web

The meta-analysis was not supported by an interim analysis of the trial designed to evaluate the issue, and several other reports have failed to conclude the controversy. This weak evidence for adverse effects has reduced the use of rosiglitazone, despite its important and sustained effects on [[glycemic control]].<ref name=Ajjan>{{cite journal |pmid=18613801 |doi=10.1517/14740338.7.4.367 |year=2008 |author1=Ajjan |first2=PJ |title=The cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=367–76 |journal=Expert opinion on drug safety |last2=Grant}}</ref> Safety studies are continuing.

In contrast, at least one large prospective study, PROactive 05, has shown that [[pioglitazone]] may decrease the overall incidence of cardiac events in people with type 2 diabetes who have already had a heart attack.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17466227 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2006.12.048 |year=2007 |author1=Erdmann |first2=JA |first3=B |first4=M |first5=IK |first6=AM |first7=Investigators |title=The effect of pioglitazone on recurrent myocardial infarction in 2,445 patients with type 2 diabetes and previous myocardial infarction: results from the PROactive (PROactive 05) Study |volume=49 |issue=17 |pages=1772–80 |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |last2=Dormandy |last3=Charbonnel |last4=Massi-Benedetti |last5=Moules |last6=Skene |last7=Proactive}}</ref>

==Secretagogues==
===Sulfonylureas===
{{Main|Sulfonylurea}}
[[Sulfonylurea]]s were the first widely used oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications.  They are ''insulin [[secretagogue]]s'', triggering insulin release by inhibiting the [[ATP-sensitive potassium channel|K<sub>ATP</sub>]] channel of the pancreatic [[beta cell]]s.  Eight types of these pills have been marketed in North America, but not all remain available.  The "second-generation" drugs are now more commonly used.  They are more effective than first-generation drugs and have fewer side-effects.  All may cause weight gain. A 2012 study found sulfonylureas raise the risk of death compared with metformin.<ref name="news.yahoo" />

Sulfonylureas bind strongly to [[plasma protein]]s. Sulfonylureas are useful only in Type II diabetes, as they work by stimulating endogenous release of insulin.  They work best with patients over 40 years old who have had diabetes mellitus for under ten years.  They cannot be used with type I diabetes, or diabetes of pregnancy.  They can be safely used with metformin or -glitazones.  The primary side-effect is [[hypoglycemia]].

Typical reductions in [[glycated hemoglobin]]&nbsp;(A1C) values for second-generation sulfonylureas are 1.0–2.0%.

* First-generation agents
** [[tolbutamide]] (Orinase brand name )
** [[acetohexamide]] (Dymelor)
** [[tolazamide]] (Tolinase)
** [[chlorpropamide]] (Diabinese)
* Second-generation agents
** [[glipizide]] (Glucotrol)
** glyburide or [[glibenclamide]] (Diabeta, Micronase, Glynase)
** [[glimepiride]] (Amaryl)
** [[gliclazide]] (Diamicron)
** [[glycopyramide]]
** [[gliquidone]]

===Nonsulfonylurea secretagogues===
====Meglitinides====
{{Main|Meglitinide}}
[[Meglitinide]]s help the pancreas produce insulin and are often called "short-acting secretagogues." They act on the same potassium channels as sulfonylureas, but at a different binding site.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15647714 |pmc=1474831 |year=2004 |author1=Rendell |title=Advances in diabetes for the millennium: drug therapy of type 2 diabetes |volume=6 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=9 |journal=MedGenMed : Medscape general medicine}}</ref> By closing the potassium channels of the pancreatic beta cells, they open the calcium channels, thereby enhancing insulin secretion.<ref name=diabetespancreasbeta>{{cite web

They are taken with or shortly before meals to boost the insulin response to each meal. If a meal is skipped, the medication is also skipped.

Typical reductions in [[glycated hemoglobin]]&nbsp;(A1C) values are 0.5–1.0%.

* [[repaglinide]] (Prandin)
* [[nateglinide]] (Starlix)

Adverse reactions include weight gain and hypoglycemia.

==Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors==
{{Main|Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor}}
[[Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor]]s are "diabetes pills" but not technically hypoglycemic agents because they do not have a direct effect on insulin secretion or sensitivity. These agents slow the digestion of starch in the small intestine, so that glucose from the starch of a meal enters the bloodstream more slowly, and can be matched more effectively by an impaired insulin response or sensitivity.  These agents are effective by themselves only in the earliest stages of [[impaired glucose tolerance]], but can be helpful in combination with other agents in [[type 2 diabetes]].

Typical reductions in [[glycated hemoglobin]]&nbsp;(A1C) values are 0.5–1.0%.

* [[miglitol]] (Glyset)
* [[acarbose]] (Precose/Glucobay)
* [[voglibose]]
These medications are rarely used in the United States because of the severity of their side-effects (flatulence and bloating).  They are more commonly prescribed in Europe.  They do have the potential to cause weight loss by lowering the amount of sugar metabolized.

==Peptide analogs==
[[Image:Incretins and DPP 4 inhibitors.svg|thumb|300px|right|Overview of insulin secretion]]

===Injectable Incretin mimetics ===
[[Incretin]]s are insulin [[secretagogue]]s.  The two main candidate molecules that fulfill criteria for being an incretin are [[glucagon-like peptide-1]] (GLP-1) and [[gastric inhibitory peptide]] (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, GIP). Both GLP-1 and GIP are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]] (DPP-4).

====Injectable Glucagon-like peptide analogs and agonists====
Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) agonists bind to a membrane GLP receptor.<ref name=diabetespancreasbeta/> As a consequence, insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells is increased.  Endogenous GLP has a half-life of only a few minutes, thus an analogue of GLP would not be practical.
* [[Exenatide]] (also Exendin-4, marketed as Byetta) is the first [[glucagon-like peptide-1|GLP-1]] agonist approved for the treatment of [[type 2 diabetes]]. Exenatide is not an analogue of GLP but rather a GLP agonist.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16722815 |doi=10.1517/14656566.7.8.1055 |year=2006 |author1=Briones |first2=M |title=Exenatide: a GLP-1 receptor agonist as novel therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=1055–64 |journal=Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy |last2=Bajaj}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17109672 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2006.01196.x |year=2006 |author1=Gallwitz |title=Exenatide in type 2 diabetes: treatment effects in clinical studies and animal study data |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=1654–61 |journal=International journal of clinical practice}}</ref> Exenatide has only 53% homology with GLP, which increases its resistance to degradation by DPP-4 and extends its half-life.<ref name="pmid17428109">{{cite journal |pmid=17428109 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200767060-00008 |year=2007 |author1=Cvetković |first2=GL |title=Exenatide: a review of its use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (as an adjunct to metformin and/or a sulfonylurea) |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=935–54 |journal=Drugs |last2=Plosker}}</ref> Typical reductions in [[Glycated hemoglobin|A1C]] values are 0.5–1.0%.
* [[Liraglutide]], a once-daily human analogue (97% homology), has been developed by [[Novo Nordisk]] under the brand name [[Victoza]]. The product was approved by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) on July 3, 2009, and by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on January 25, 2010.<ref>http://www.drugs.com/nda/liraglutide_080530.html May 2008</ref><ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/74913.php "Liraglutide Provides Significantly Better Glucose Control Than Insulin Glargine In Phase 3 Study" June 2007</ref><ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/110349.php "Clinical Study Shows Liraglutide Reduced Blood Sugar, Weight, And Blood Pressure In Patients With Type 2 Diabetes" June 2008</ref><ref>http://www.drugdevelopment-technology.com/projects/liraglutide/</ref><ref>http://www.novonordisk.com/science/about_rd/quarterly_rd_update.asp Oct 2008 Inc results of LEAD 6 extension</ref><ref>http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/marketwire/0580389.htm January 2009</ref>
* [[Taspoglutide]] is presently in Phase III clinical trials with [[Hoffman-La Roche]].

These agents may also cause a decrease in gastric motility, responsible for the common side-effect of nausea, and is probably the mechanism by which weight loss occurs.

====Gastric inhibitory peptide analogs====
* None are FDA approved

====Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors====

GLP-1 analogs resulted in weight loss and had more gastrointestinal side-effects, while in general DPP-4 inhibitors were weight-neutral and increased risk for infection and headache, but both classes appear to present an alternative to other antidiabetic drugs. However, weight gain and/or hypoglycaemia have been observed when DPP-4 inhibitors were used with sulfonylureas; effect on long-term health and morbidity rates are still unknown.<ref name=nps01>{{Cite journal|author=National Prescribing Service |journal=RADAR |title=Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors ('gliptins') for type 2 diabetes mellitus |date=August 1, 2010 |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_radar/2008/august_2008/gliptins}}</ref>

[[Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors|Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors]] increase blood concentration of the [[incretin]] GLP-1 by inhibiting its degradation by [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]].

Examples are:
* [[vildagliptin]] (Galvus) EU Approved 2008
* [[sitagliptin]] (Januvia) FDA approved Oct 2006
* [[saxagliptin]] (Onglyza) FDA Approved July 2009
* [[linagliptin]] (Tradjenta) FDA Approved May 2, 2011
* [[allogliptin]]
* [[septagliptin]]

===Injectable Amylin analogues===
[[Amylin]] agonist analogues slow gastric emptying and suppress [[glucagon]]. They have all the incretins actions except stimulation of insulin secretion. {{As of|2007}}, [[pramlintide]] is the only clinically available amylin analogue. Like insulin, it is administered by [[subcutaneous injection]]. The most frequent and severe adverse effect of pramlintide is [[nausea]], which occurs mostly at the beginning of treatment and gradually reduces. Typical reductions in A1C values are 0.5–1.0%.
