'''Volatile organic compounds''' ('''VOCs''') are [[organic chemicals]] that have a high [[vapour pressure]] at ordinary, [[room temperature|room-temperature]] conditions. Their high vapour pressure results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of molecules to [[evaporation|evaporate]] or [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] from the liquid or solid form of the compound and enter the surrounding air. An example is [[formaldehyde]], with a boiling point of –19 °C (–2 °F), slowly exiting [[paint]] and getting into the air.

VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Most [[Odour|scents or odours]] are of VOCs. VOCs play an important role in communication between plants. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1og25/PlantsADifferentPers/resources/73.htm |title=Plants: A Different Perspective |publisher=Content.yudu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> Some VOCs are dangerous to human health or cause harm to the [[natural environment|environment]]. [[Anthropogenic behaviour|Anthropogenic]] VOCs are regulated by law, especially indoors, where concentrations are the highest. Harmful VOCs are typically not acutely [[toxic]], but instead have compounding long-term health effects. Because the concentrations are usually low and the symptoms slow to develop, research into VOCs and their effects is difficult.

== Definitions ==
{{Cleanup|section|date=January 2009}}
Diverse definitions of the term VOC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofins.com/voc.aspx |title=What means VOC ? |publisher=Eurofins.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> are in use.

The definitions of VOCs used for control of precursors of photochemical smog used by EPA, and U.S.  States with their own outdoor air pollution regulations include exemptions for VOCs that are determined to be non-reactive, or of low-reactivity in the smog formation process. EPA formerly defined these compounds as reactive organic gases (ROG) but changed the terminology to VOC. 

In the USA, different regulation exists per state - most prominent is the VOC regulation by [[SCAQMD]] and by [[California Air Resources Board]].<ref>[http://www.eurofins.com/carb-consumer-products-voc.aspx California ARB]</ref> However, this specific use of the term VOCs can be misleading, specifically when applied to [[indoor air quality]] because many chemicals that are not regulated for controlling outdoor air pollution can still be important for indoor air pollution - there is no correlation between VOC content in a product and VOC emissions from that product into indoor air.

===Canada===
[[Health Canada]] classes VOCs as organic compounds that have boiling points roughly in the range of {{Convert|50|to|250|C|F}}. The emphasis is placed on commonly encountered VOCs that would have an effect on air quality.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/air/office_building-immeubles_bureaux/organic-organiques-eng.php Health Canada] <!-- retrieved January 22, 2009 --></ref>

===European Union===
A VOC is any organic compound having an initial boiling point less than or equal to {{Convert|250|C|F}} measured at a standard atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kPa and can do damage to visual or audible senses.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0042:EN:NOT Directive 2004/42/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products] ''EUR-Lex'', European Union Publications Office. Retrieved on 2010-09-28.</ref>

===US===
VOCs (or specific subsets of the VOCs) are legally defined in the various laws and codes under which they are regulated. Other definitions may be found from government agencies investigating or advising about VOCs.<ref>[http://toxics.usgs.gov/definitions/vocs.html USGS definition]</ref> The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulates VOCs in the air, water, and land. The [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] implementation includes a list labeled "VOCs in connection with contaminants that are organic and volatile."<ref>40CFR141</ref> The EPA also publishes testing methods for chemical compounds, some of which refer to VOCs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/method/files/524_2.pdf |title=Clean Water Act Analytical Methods &#124; CWA Methods &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref>

In addition to drinking water, VOCs are regulated in discharges to waters (sewage treatment and stormwater disposal), as hazardous waste,<ref>[[CERCLA]] and RCRA</ref> but not in non industrial indoor air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/voc.html |title=Volatile Organic Compounds &#124; Indoor Air &#124; US Environmental Protection Agency |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Labor]] and its Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate VOC exposure in the workplace. Volatile organic compounds that are [[hazardous material]] would be regulated by the [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration]] while being transported.

==Biologically generated VOCs==
Not counting [[methane]], biological sources emit an estimated 1150 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|teragrams]] of [[carbon]] per year in the form of VOCs.<ref name="unexplored">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/es072476p | title = Known and Unexplored Organic Constituents in the Earth's Atmosphere | year = 2007 | last1 = Goldstein | first1 = Allen H. | last2 = Galbally | first2 = Ian E. | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 1514}}</ref> The majority of VOCs are produced by plants, the main compound being [[isoprene]]. The remainder are produced by animals, microbes, and [[fungi]], such as [[molds]].

The strong odor emitted by many plants consists of [[green leaf volatiles]], a subset of VOCs. Emissions are affected by a variety of factors, such as temperature, which determines rates of volatilization and growth, and sunlight, which determines rates of [[biosynthesis]]. Emission occurs almost exclusively from the leaves, the [[stomata]] in particular. A major class of VOCs is <!--Predicate agrees in number with its subject.-->[[terpene]]s, such as [[myrcene]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2004.02.006 | title = Physiological and physicochemical controls on foliar volatile organic compound emissions | year = 2004 | last1 = Niinemets | first1 = Ülo | last2 = Loreto | first2 = Francesco | last3 = Reichstein | first3 = Markus | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 180–6 | pmid = 15063868}}</ref> Providing a sense of scale, a forest 62,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in area (the U.S. state of Pennsylvania) is estimated to emit 3,400,000 kilograms of terpenes on a typical August day during the growing season.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cssc.200900186 | title = Myrcene as a Natural Base Chemical in Sustainable Chemistry: A Critical Review | year = 2009 | last1 = Behr | first1 = Arno | last2 = Johnen | first2 = Leif | journal = ChemSusChem | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 1072–95 | pmid = 20013989}}</ref> Induction of genes producing volatile organic compounds, and subsequent increase in volatile terpenes has been achieved in maize using (Z)-3-Hexen-1-ol and other plant hormones.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Farag, Mohamed A., Mohamed Fokar, Haggag A.

==Anthropogenic sources==

[[Anthropogenic]] sources emit about 142 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|teragrams]] of [[carbon]] per year in the form of VOCs.<ref name="unexplored"/>

===Specific components===
====Paints and coatings====
A major source of man-made VOCs are coatings, especially paints and protective coatings. Solvents are required to spread a protective or decorative film. Approximately 12 billion litres of paints are produced annually. Typical solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, [[ethyl acetate]], glycol ethers, and [[acetone]]. Motivated by cost, environmental concerns, and regulation, the paint and coating industries are increasingly shifting toward [[aqueous solution|aqueous solvents]].<ref>Dieter Stoye "Paints and Coatings" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_359.pub2}}</ref>

====Chlorofluorocarbons and chlorocarbons====
[[Chlorofluorocarbon]]s, which are banned or highly regulated, were widely used cleaning products and refrigerants. Tetrachloroethene is used widely in dry cleaning and by industry. Industrial use of [[fossil fuels]] produces VOCs either directly as products (e.g., [[gasoline]]) or indirectly as byproducts (e.g., automobile exhaust).

====Benzene====
One VOC that is a known human carcinogen is benzene, which is a chemical found in environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels, and exhaust from cars in an attached garage. Benzene also has natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires. It is frequently used to make other chemicals in the production of plastics, resins, and synthetic fibers. Benzene evaporates into the air quickly and the vapor of benzene is heavier than air allowing the compound to sink into low-lying areas. Benzene has also been known to contaminate food and water and if digested can lead to vomiting, dizziness, sleepiness, rapid heartbeat, and at high levels, even death may occur.

====Methylene chloride====
Methylene chloride is another VOC that is highly dangerous to human health. It can be found in adhesive removers and aerosol spray paints and the chemical has been proven to cause cancer in animals. In the human body, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide and a person will suffer the same symptoms as exposure to carbon monoxide. If a product that contains methylene chloride needs to be used the best way to protect human health is to use the product outdoors. If it must be used indoors, proper ventilation is essential to keeping exposure levels down.

====Perchloroethylene====
Perchloroethylene is a volatile organic compound that has been linked to causing cancer in animals. It is also suspected to cause many of the breathing related symptoms of exposure to VOCs.{{cn|date=April 2013}} Perchloroethylene is used mostly in dry cleaning. While dry cleaners recapture perchloroethylene in the dry cleaning process to reuse it, some environmental release is unavoidable.  Studies show that people breathe in low levels of this VOC in homes where dry-cleaned clothes are stored and while wearing dry-cleaned clothing.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

====MTBE====
[[MTBE]] was banned in the US around 2004 in order to limit further contamination of drinking water [[aquifers]] primarily from leaking underground gasoline storage tanks where MTBE was used as an octane booster and oxygenated-additive.

===Indoor air===
{{Main|Indoor air quality}}
Since people today spend most of their time at home or in an office, long-term exposure to VOCs in the indoor environment can contribute to [[sick building syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.envint.2007.02.011 | title = Volatile organic compounds in indoor environment and photocatalytic oxidation: State of the art | year = 2007 | last1 = Wang | first1 = Shaobin | last2 = Ang | first2 = H.M. | last3 = Tade | first3 = Moses O. | journal = Environment International | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 694–705 | pmid = 17376530}}</ref> In offices, VOC results from new furnishings, wall coverings, and office equipment such as photocopy machines, which can [[Outgassing|off-gas]] VOCs into the air.<ref name="test" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Yu, C., & Crump, D. | year = 1998 | title = A review of the emission of VOCs from polymeric materials used in buildings | journal = Building and Environment | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 357–374 | doi = 10.1016/S0360-1323(97)00055-3}}</ref> Good ventilation and air-conditioning systems are helpful at reducing VOC emissions in the indoor environment.<ref name="test" /> Studies also show that relative [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]] can increase through prolonged exposure of VOCs in the indoor environment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Irigaray, P., Newby, J.

There are two standardized methods for measuring VOCs, one by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and another by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). Each method uses a single component solvent; [[butanol]] and [[hexane]] cannot be sampled, however, on the same sample matrix using the NIOSH or OSHA method.<ref>[http://galsonlabs.com/services/referenceinfo/technical_bulletins.php?tb_id=42 Who Says Alcohol and Benzene Don't Mix?]{{deadlink|date=November 2012}}</ref>

=== Regulation of indoor VOC emissions ===
In most countries, a separate definition of VOCs is used with regard to indoor air quality that comprises each organic chemical compound that can be measured as follows: Adsorption from air on Tenax TA, thermal desorption, gas chromatographic separation over a 100% nonpolar column (dimethylpolysiloxane). VOC (volatile organic compounds) are all compounds that appear in the gas chromatogram between and including n-hexane and n-hexadecane. Compounds appearing earlier are called VVOC (very volatile organic compounds) compounds appearing later are called SVOC (semi-volatile organic compounds). See also these standards: ISO 16000-6, ISO 13999-2, VDI 4300-6, German [http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/building-products/agbb.htm AgBB evaluating scheme], German [http://www.eurofins.com/agbb.aspx DIBt approval scheme], GEV testing method for the [http://www.eurofins.com/emicode.aspx EMICODE].
Some overviews over VOC emissions rating schemes <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofins.com/ecolabels.aspx |title=Ecolabels, Quality Labels, and VOC emissions |publisher=Eurofins.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> have been [http://www.eurofins.com/ecolabels-comparison.aspx collected and compared].

[[France]] and [[Germany]] have enacted regulations to limit VOC emissions from commercial products, and industry has developed numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems, such as EMICODE,<ref>[http://www.eurofins.com/emicode.aspx EMICODE]</ref> M1,<ref>[http://www.eurofins.com/m1.aspx M1]</ref> Blue Angel<ref>[http://www.eurofins.com/blue-angel.aspx Blue Angel]</ref> and Indoor Air Comfort<ref>[http://www.indoor-air-comfort.com Indoor Air Comfort]</ref> In the [[United States]], several standards exist; California Standard CDPH Section 01350<ref>[http://www.eurofins.com/section-1350.aspx CDPH Section 01350]</ref> is the most popular one. Over the last few decades, these regulations and standards changed the marketplace, leading to an increasing number of low-emitting products: The leading voluntary labels report that licenses to several hundreds of low-emitting products have been issued (see the respective webpages).

===Formaldehyde===
Many building materials such as paints, adhesives, wall boards, and ceiling tiles slowly emit [[formaldehyde]], which irritates the mucous membranes and can make a person irritated and uncomfortable.<ref name="test">Bernstein, J. A., Alexis, N., Bacchus, H., Bernstein, I. L., Fritz, P., Horner, E., et al. (2008). The health effects of nonindustrial indoor air pollution.

The dichotomy of relative humidity on indoor air quality. Environment International, 33(6), 850-857.</ref>

==Health risks==
Respiratory, allergic, or immune effects in infants or children are associated with man-made VOCs and other indoor or outdoor air pollutants.<ref>Mendell, M. J. (2007). Indoor residential chemical emissions as risk factors for respiratory and allergic effects in children: A review. Indoor Air, 17(4), 259-277.</ref>

Some VOCs, such as [[styrene]] and [[limonene]], can react with [[nitrogen oxides]] or with ozone to produce new oxidation
products and secondary aerosols, which can cause sensory irritation symptoms.<ref>Wolkoff, P., Wilkins, C. K., Clausen, P. A., & Nielsen, G. D. (2006).

Health effects include:

:Eye, nose, and [[throat irritation]]; headaches, loss of coordination, nausea; damage to liver, kidney, and central nervous system. Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans. Key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to VOCs include conjunctival irritation, nose and throat discomfort, headache, allergic skin reaction, [[dyspnea]], declines in serum [[cholinesterase]] levels, nausea, emesis, epistaxis, fatigue, dizziness.

The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effects. As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics. At present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes. Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/voc.html EPA -- An Introduction to Indoor Air Quality Pollutants and Sources of Indoor Air Pollution  Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)]</ref>

===Reducing exposure===

To reduce exposure to these toxins, one should buy products that contain Low-VOCs or No VOCs. Only the quantity which will soon be needed should be purchased, eliminating stockpiling of these chemicals. Use products with VOCs in well ventilated areas.  When designing homes and buildings, design teams can implement the best possible ventilation plans, call for the best mechanical systems available, and design assemblies to reduce the amount of infiltration into the building. These methods will help improve indoor air quality, but by themselves they cannot keep a building from becoming an unhealthy place to breathe.
	While proper building ventilation is a key component to improving indoor air quality, it cannot do the job on its own. As stated earlier, awareness is the key component to improving air quality, when choosing building materials, furnishings, and decorations. When architects and engineers implement best practices in ventilation and mechanical systems, the owner must maintain good air quality levels thereafter.

===Limit values for VOC emissions===
[http://www.eurofins.com/lci-cli-nik-crel.aspx Limit values for VOC emissions into indoor air] are published by e.g. AgBB, AFSSET, California Department of Public Health, and others.

==Chemical fingerprinting==

==VOCs Sensors==
{{Main|VOCs Sensor}}
VOCs in the environment or certain atmospheres can be detected based in different principles and interactions between the organic compounds and the sensor components. There are electronic devices that can detect ppm concentrations despite the non-selectivity. Others can predict with reasonable accuracy the molecular structure of the volatile organic compounds in the environment or enclosed atmospheres<ref>Detection of Hydrocarbons and Other Volatile Organic Compounds: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la102693m</ref> and could be used as accurate monitors of the Chemical Fingerprint and further as health monitoring devices.
