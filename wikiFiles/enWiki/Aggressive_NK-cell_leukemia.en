This rare form a leukemia is more common among Asians in comparison to other ethnic groups. It is typically diagnosed in adolescents and young adults, with a slight predominance in males.<ref name="cha1"/><ref name="ima1"/><ref name="cha2"/><ref name="kwo1">

==Clinical features==
===Etiology===
This disease has a strong association with the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV),<ref name="gel1"/> but the true pathogenesis of this disease has yet to be described. The cell of origin is believed to be an [[NK cell]].<ref name="who1"/> Blastoid NK cell lymphoma appears to be a different entity and shows no association with EBV.<ref name="cha1"/>

===Presentation===
Patients usually present with constitutional symptoms ([[malaise]], [[weight loss]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]), and [[hepatosplenomegaly]] is commonly found on physical exam. [[Lymphadenopathy]] is also found to a lesser extent. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, patients may initially present at a more advanced stage, with [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]], [[hemophagocytic syndrome]], and [[multi-organ failure]].<ref name="cha1"/><ref name="ima1"/><ref name="kwo1"/>

===Laboratory findings===
Leukemic cells are invariably present in samples of peripheral [[blood]] to a variable extent. [[Pancytopenia]] ([[anemia]], [[neutropenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]]) is commonly seen as well.<ref name="who1"/>

===Sites of involvement===
This disease is typically found and diagnosed in peripheral [[blood]], and while it can involve any organ, it is usually found in the [[spleen]], [[liver]], and [[bone marrow]].<ref name="who1"/>

==Morphology==
===Peripheral blood===
The leukemic cells have a diameter mildly greater than a [[large granular lymphocyte]] (LGL) and have azurophilic granules and nucleoli of varying prominence. Nuclei may be irregular and hyperchromatic.<ref name="who1"/>

===Bone marrow===
Bone marrow involvement runs the spectrum between an inconspicuous infiltrate to extensive marrow replacement by leukemic cells. Reactive [[histiocytes]] displaying [[hemophagocytosis]] can been seen interspersed in the [[neoplastic]] infiltrate.<ref name="who1"/>

===Other organs===
Leukemic involvement of organs is typically destructive on tissue sections with necrosis and possibly angioinvasion, and the monotonous infiltrate may be diffuse or patchy.<ref name="who1"/>

==Molecular findings==
===Immunophenotype===
The immunophenotype of this disease is the same as extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type and is shown in the table below. [[CD11b]] and [[CD16]] show variable expression.<ref name = "cha1"/><ref name="osh1"/>

===Genetic findings===
Due to the NK lineage, clonal rearrangements of [[lymphoid]] (T cell receptor; B cell receptor) genes are not seen.<ref name="who1"/> The genome of the [[Epstein Barr virus]] (EBV) is detected in many cases,<ref name="gel1"/> along with a variety of chromosomal abnormalities.<ref name="won1">{{cite journal |author=Wong KF, Zhang YM, Chan JK |title=Cytogenetic abnormalities in natural killer cell lymphoma/leukaemia—is there a consistent pattern? |journal=Leuk.

==Treatment==

Currently Aggressive NK-cell leukemia, being a subtype of PTCL, is treated similarly to B-cell lymphomas. However, in recent years, scientists have developed techniques to better recognize the different types of lymphomas, such as PTCL. It is now understood that PTCL behaves differently from B-cell lymphomas and therapies are being developed that specifically target these types of lymphoma. Currently, however, there are no therapies approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) specifically for PTCL. [[Anthracycline]]-containing [[chemotherapy regimens]] are commonly offered as the initial therapy. Some patients may receive a [[stem cell transplant]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reimer P, Rüdiger T, Geissinger E, ''et al.'' |title=Autologous stem-cell transplantation as first-line therapy in peripheral T-cell lymphomas: results of a prospective multicenter study |journal=J.
