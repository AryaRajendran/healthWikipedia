In the 1960s, the first [[antiandrogen]], or [[androgen]] antagonist, was discovered. Antiandrogens [[Receptor antagonist|antagonise]] the [[androgen receptor]] (AR) and thereby block the biological effects of [[testosterone]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT). Antiandrogens are important for men with hormonally responsive diseases like [[prostate cancer]], [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BHP), [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[Seborrhoeic dermatitis|seborrhea]], [[hirsutism]] and [[Alopecia areata|androgen alopecia]]. Antiandrogens are mainly used for the treatment of prostate diseases.<ref name="history"/><ref name="Therapeutic target"/><ref name="Antiandrogens"/> New research also suggests that ARs could be linked to the disease progression of [[triple-negative breast cancer]] and that antiandrogens can potentially be used to treat it.<ref name="Triple">{{cite journal|last=Gucalp|first=A|coauthors=Traina, TA|title=Triple-negative breast cancer: role of the androgen receptor.|journal=Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)|date=2010 Jan-Feb|volume=16|issue=1|pages=62–5|pmid=20164692|doi=10.1097/PPO.0b013e3181ce4ae1}}</ref>

Current antiandrogens are [[small molecule]] antiandrogens and can be either [[steroid]]al or nonsteroidal depending on [[ligand]] chemistry. Steroidal antiandrogens share a similar steroid structure, while nonsteroidal antiandrogens may have structurally distinctive [[pharmacophores]]. Only a limited number of compounds are available for [[clinic]]al use despite the fact that a very large variety of antiandrogen compounds have been discovered and researched.<ref name="Therapeutic target"/>

== History ==
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a relationship between the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]], [[Testicle|testes]] and [[Prostate|prostate gland]] was established. [[Charles Brenton Huggins]] established a method to measure the effect [[hormone]] changes have on prostatic [[function (biology)|function]]. He found out that [[castration]] or [[estrogen]] administration led to glandular [[atrophy]], which could be reversed by re-administration of androgen. In 1941 the beneficial effect of androgen ablation on [[metastatic]] prostate cancer was realised when Huggins and Clarence Hodges treated these patients by either castration or estrogen therapy. They monitored the prostate size and therapeutic efficacy by measuring serum [[Prostatic acid phosphatase|acid-phosphatase]] levels. They concluded that androgenic activity in the body influences prostate cancer at least with respect to serum phosphatase. Huggins was the first to use a systemic approach to treat prostate cancer. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1966.<ref name="history"/>

It became evident after many findings that androgen ablation, by means of castration or estrogen administration, was not enough to completely cure patients with advanced prostate cancer. In the late 1960s, the AR was discovered and characterised. Screening of [[chemical library|chemical libraries]] for AR blockers led to the discovery of cyproterone. An [[acetate]] group was then added to cyproterone creating [[Cyproterone|cyproterone acetate]]. In the 1970s, [[flutamide]] was discovered. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved it in 1989 for use in treating prostate cancer. In 1995, [[bicalutamide]] was also approved and [[nilutamide]] followed a year later.<ref name="history">{{cite journal|last=Denmeade|first=SR|coauthors=Isaacs, JT|title=A history of prostate cancer treatment.|journal=Nature reviews.

== Androgen receptor ==
[[File:Androgen receptor.png|thumb|370px|'''Figure 1''' The four main regions of the androgen receptor]]
The AR belongs to the [[Steroid hormone receptor|steroid receptor]] subfamily of the [[nuclear receptor]] superfamily. Its function is regulated by the [[Molecular binding|binding]] of androgens, which initiates sequential [[Conformational change|conformation changes]] of the [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] that affects receptor-[[protein]] and receptor-DNA interactions. [[Endogeny|Endogenous]] androgens are mainly testosterone and DHT.<ref name="Peptide antagonist">{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=W|title=Peptide antagonist of the androgen receptor.|journal=Current pharmaceutical design|year=2010|volume=16|issue=9|pages=1106–13|pmid=20030610}}</ref><ref name="Pharmacokinetics">{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=W|coauthors=Kim, J, Dalton, JT|title=Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nonsteroidal androgen receptor ligands.|journal=Pharmaceutical Research|date=2006 Aug|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1641–58|pmid=16841196|doi=10.1007/s11095-006-9024-3|pmc=2072875}}</ref><ref name="Foye">{{cite book|last=Lemke|first=David A.

The AR [[gene]] is more than 90kb long and codes for a protein of 919 [[amino acid]]s. Only one AR gene has been identified in humans which is located on [[X chromosome|chromosome X]]. It comprises four main regions, see figure 1:<ref name="Therapeutic target">{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=W|title=Androgen receptor as a therapeutic target.|journal=Advanced drug delivery reviews|date=2010-10-30|volume=62|issue=13|pages=1277–84|pmid=20708648|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2010.08.002}}</ref><ref name="Antiandrogens">{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=SM|coauthors=Gauthier, S, Labrie, F|title=Androgen receptor antagonists (antiandrogens): structure-activity relationships.|journal=Current medicinal chemistry|date=2000 Feb|volume=7|issue=2|pages=211–47|pmid=10637363}}</ref><ref name="Recent developments">{{cite journal|last=Haendler|first=B|coauthors=Cleve, A|title=Recent developments in antiandrogens and selective androgen receptor modulators.|journal=Molecular and cellular endocrinology|date=2011-06-16|pmid=21704118|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2011.06.002|volume=352|issue=1-2|pages=79–91}}</ref><ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>
# [[N-terminus|N-terminal domain]] (NTD) which serves a modulatory function.
# [[DNA-binding domain]] (DBD) which recognises and binds to androgen response elements (ARE) in target gene sequence.
# Ligand binding domain (LBD) which is responsible for ligand recognition and binding.
# A small hinge region between the DBD and LBD.

Two functions have been identified in AR that have critical roles in the regulation of target gene [[transactivation]], the N-terminal activation function 1 (AF1) and the [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] activation function 2 (AF2). AF1 is ligand-independent and plays the primary role in target gene transactivation. The AF2 is a ligand-dependent and only shows limited function.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/><ref name="Foye"/>

=== Mechanism of action ===

Unbound AR is mainly located in the [[cytoplasm]], like a typical steroid receptor, and is associated with a complex of [[heat shock protein]]s (HSP) through interactions with LBD. Androgens, either [[agonist]]s or antagonists, position themselves in the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of the [[cytosol]]ic AR and bind to the LBD, see figure 2. The AR goes through a series of [[conformational isomerism|conformational]] changes and HSP dissociate from AR. The transformed AR undergoes [[Protein dimer|dimerisation]], [[phosphorylation]] and [[Protein targeting#Protein translocation|translocates]] to the nucleus. The translocated receptor then binds to the androgen-response elements (ARE) on the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] of the androgen responsive gene, a consensus sequence located either upstream or downstream of the [[transcription start site]] (TSS) of AR target genes.  Recruitment of other [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] co-factors (including co-activators and co-repressors) and general transcriptional machinery further ensures the transactivation of AR-regulated [[gene expression]]. All these complicated processes are initiated by the ligand-induced conformational changes in the LBD. Ligand specific recruitment of [[Transcription coregulator|coregulators]] might be crucial for the agonist or antagonist activity of AR ligands. Binding of DNA is also required for AR-regulated gene expression, also known as classic genomic gene function of AR.<ref name="Recent developments"/><ref name="Peptide antagonist"/><ref name="Foye"/>

== Development of steroidal- and non-steroidal antiandrogens ==

Cyproterone is a steroidal antiandrogen that competitively inhibits the binding of testosterone or DHT to AR. Cyproterone binds to ARs that are expressed by prostate cancer cells as well as to the AR that are expressed in the [[hypothalamus]] and pituitary. Therefore cyproterone blocks the [[negative feedback]] of androgens at the hypothalamic-pituitary level leading to increased [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) serum levels. This rise in LH levels causes an increase in serum testosterone levels and ultimately diminishes the ability of cyproterone to compete for AR binding and to block androgenic [[stimulation]].<ref name="history"/><ref name="Recent developments"/>


Cyproterone acetate was developed to overcome this problem. It is formed by adding an acetate group to cyproterone, see figure 3. Cyproterone acetate has a dual mode of action as it competes directly with DHT for binding to AR, but also inhibits [[gonadotropin]] secretion. It thereby reduces androgen, estrogen and LH levels.<ref name="history"/><ref name="Recent developments"/> Cyproterone acetate acts both directly as an antiandrogen in prostate cancer cells and also functions to indirectly decrease serum testosterone levels. The latter causes the limitations of cyproterone acetate, which are central effects on androgen secretion, with subsequent loss of [[libido]] and sexual potency. Several reports also state that cyproterone acetate causes liver [[hyperplasia]]. These [[side effect]]s gave pharmaceutical companies the incentive to search for alternative non-steroidal "pure" antiandrogens that would not have these side effects.<ref name="history"/>  Pure antiandrogens block the androgen receptor without exerting any agonistic or any other hormonal activity.<ref name="Antiandrogens"/>

Flutamide became the first non-steroidal antiandrogen to be tested clinically. Later the non-steroidal antiandrogens bicalutamide and nilutamide were developed. The alleged advantages of these compounds were that they did not affect libido or potency like the other centrally acting compounds under development, [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone]] (LHRH) agonists and cyproterone acetate. But this theory did not prove to be true. These non-steroidal antiandrogens eventually crossed the [[blood–brain barrier]], like cyproterone, leading to a subsequent increase in serum testosterone levels.<ref name="history"/>

=== Flutamide ===
[[File:Flutamide structure.ext.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 4''' Flutamide]]
Flutamide is an arylpropionamide [[Structural analog|analog]] with pure antiandrogenic properties, seen in figure 4. It is completely absorbed from the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] after oral administration and undergoes extensive [[first pass effect|first pass metabolism]] to its active form, 2-hydroxyflutamide, and [[hydrolysis]] product, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitroaniline.<ref name="Recent developments"/><ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/><ref name="Foye"/> Hydroxyflutamide is a more potent AR antagonist than flutamide ''[[in vivo]]'', with higher binding affinity for the AR. Hydroxyflutamide has an elimination [[half-life]] of about 8 hours in humans. Hydrolysis of the [[Peptide bond|amide bond]] represents the major [[metabolic pathway]] for this active [[metabolite]]. By reversing the stimulatory effect of DHT on ventral prostate weight, flutamide is approximately 2-fold more [[Potency (pharmacology)|potent]] than cyproterone acetate. Hydroxyflutamide has relatively low binding affinity to AR and is therefore generally used at  high doses in order to achieve complete AR blockage in therapy.<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/><ref name="Comparison">{{cite journal|last=Poyet|first=P|coauthors=Labrie, F|title=Comparison of the antiandrogenic/androgenic activities of flutamide, cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate.|journal=Molecular and cellular endocrinology|date=1985 Oct|volume=42|issue=3|pages=283–8|pmid=3930312}}</ref>

=== Nilutamide ===
[[File:Nilutamide structure.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 5''' Nilutamide]]
Nilutamide is a nitroaromatic [[hydantoin]] analog of flutamide, as seen in figure 5.<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/><ref name="Foye"/> Nilutamide is eliminated exclusively by metabolism, mainly by reduction of the [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] [[Nitro compound|nitro group]]. Although the hydrolysis of one of the [[carbonyl]] functions of the imidazolinedione was identified, it is much less susceptible to hepatic metabolism than the amide bond in hydroxuflutamide. This results in a longer half-life of nilutamide in humans of 2 days. Nevertheless, the nitro anion-free [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] formed during nitro reduction could still be associated with [[hepatotoxicity]] in humans, especially when using relatively high dosage employed for androgen blockage.<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/> Nilutamide causes side-effects which limit its usage, such as [[pneumonitis]] and delayed adaption to darkness.<ref name="Recent developments"/>

=== Bicalutamide ===
[[File:Bicalutamide - chiral.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 6''' Bicalutamide]]
[[Bicalutamide]] is an arylpropionamide analog, seen in figure 6.<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/><ref name="Foye"/> It has replaced flutamide and nilutamide as the first choice antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment. Bicalutamide is not as hepatotoxic as flutamide and nilutamide and has a longer half-life, of 6 days in humans, that allows once a day administration at lower dosage. Bicalutamide shares the amide bond structure with flutamide. Even so, the amide bond hydrolysis was discovered in rats, not in humans, which could explain the prolonged half life of bicalutamide in humans.<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/>

Bicalutamide has a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] at the [[Arene substitution patterns#Ortho, meta, and para substitution|para position]] instead of a nitro group like flutamide and nilutamide. This change in groups avoids the nitro reduction observed in nilutamide. Bicalutamide has a [[Chirality#Chemistry|chiral]] carbon in its structure (labeled with an asterisk in figure 6), which is connected to the hydroxyl and methyl groups . It is therefore administered as a [[Racemic mixture|racemate]].<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/> Post-approval investigation revealed that its antiandrogenic activity resides almost entirely in the (R)-[[enantiomer]]. (R)-bicalutamide has an almost fourfold higher affinity for the prostate AR than hydroxyflutamide and has a better side-effect profile compared to other antiandrogens.<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/><ref name="Foye"/>

== Structure and activity relationship ==
=== Steroidal antiandrogens ===
Cyproterone acetate is a 6-chloro-1,2-methylene derivative of 17 α-acetoxyprogesterone. It shows major antiandrogenic activity together with androgenic activities. Cyproterone acetate displays high affinity for AR in rats which increases when the 1,2-methylene group is removed from the compound. If the [[chlorine]] atome is replaced by a [[methyl group]] the binding slightly decreases, whereas further removal of the C6 double bond modifies the binding kinetics, see figure 7.<ref name="Antiandrogens"/>

=== Non-steroidal antiandrogens ===
Hydroxyflutamide and it‘s analogs, bicalutamide and nilutamide, share an [[anilide]] ring structure. The structures can be seen in figure 7, where the anilide ring is coloured red. These three compounds require an electron-deficient aromatic ring for efficient AR binding. Replacing the anilide with an [[alkene]] gives weakly active compounds, which can be attributed to the lack of intramolecular [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen binding]] or to poor hydrogen-bond donor capability.<ref name="Antiandrogens"/> Various combinations of [[Polar effect|electron-withdrawing]] substitutions in the [[aniline]] ring of these drugs, have not shown higher binding to the AR receptor than compounds which have a chloro or trifluoromethyl group at the [[Arene substitution patterns#Ortho, meta, and para substitution|meta position]] (R1) and either a cyano or nitrogen group at the para position (R2).<ref name="Antiandrogens"/><ref name="Key structural">{{cite journal|last=Yin|first=D|coauthors=He, Y, Perera, MA, Hong, SS, Marhefka, C, Stourman, N, Kirkovsky, L, Miller, DD, Dalton, JT|title=Key structural features of nonsteroidal ligands for binding and activation of the androgen receptor.|journal=Molecular Pharmacology|date=2003 Jan|volume=63|issue=1|pages=211–23|pmid=12488554|pmc=2040236}}</ref>

For hydroxyflutamide, a group of compounds that differed in the aromatic ring did not bind to the AR. This suggests that the bisubstitution in the hydroxyflutamide ring is essential for high AR binding affinity. It has also been demonstrated that hydroxyflutamide requires the strong hydrogen bond donor ability of the tertiary hydroxyl group and fixed conformers involved in intramolecular hydrogen binding, to bind effectively to AR.<ref name="Antiandrogens"/><ref name="Key structural"/>

For bicalutamide, the antiandrogenic activities of [[sulfide]] and [[sulfone]] substitions of the X-linkage were tested ''[[in vitro]]''. The sulfides showed in most cases at least 2-fold higher binding affinity than corresponding sulfones. However, this relationship was reversed when the R3 group was NHSO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, where the binding affinity of sulfone was 3-fold higher than that of sulfide. These results indicate that substituents of the B-ring largely determine the effect of the X-linkage in AR binding. Researchers have proposed that the tertiary hydroxyl group is involved in direct interaction with AR because when an [[acetyl]] group is introduced to that hydroxyl moiety, the receptor binding affinity greatly decreases.<ref name="Key structural"/>

Nilutamide has very low affinity for AR when tested on castrated rat prostate. Modifications such as replacing the N3 atom with oxygen has little effect on affinity of the compound for prostate AR. By replacing the [[oxygen]] atom with a [[sulfur]] atom at the C2 position of the [[imidazole]] ring and adding [[Butanol|butylalcohol]] to the N3 atom, the receptor binding and biological activity of the compound increases 100 times that of non-steroidal antiandrogens. Also the compound does not bind to other steroid receptors. If a methyl group is changed for the butylalcohol group, the compound shows 3 and 10 times more antiandrogenic activity ''in vivo'' than bicalutamide and nilutamide, respectively.<ref name="Antiandrogens"/>

== Antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome ==
Antiandrogens that are currently on the market are particularly useful for the treatment of prostate cancer during the early stages. However, prostate cancer often progresses to a [[prostate cancer#Castration-resistant prostate cancer|hormone-refractory]] state in which the cancer progresses in the presence of continued androgen [[ablation#Medicine|ablation]] or antiandrogen therapy.<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/> This suggests that long term use of these antiandrogens during prostate cancer can lead to the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells or the ability of adrenal androgens to support [[tumor]] growth.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/> This phenomenon is called [[antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome]] (AWS) and is one of the major drawbacks of existing antiandrogens. AWS is defined as tumor regression or symptomatic relief observed upon discontinuation of the antiandrogen therapy. The mechanism for this is not fully understood but current theories include alterations of the AR gene, [[Nuclear receptor#Coregulatory proteins|coregulator proteins]] and/or signal transduction pathways. This antiandrogen resistance may also be linked to the relative weakness of current antiandrogens as they have an affinity 50 times or more lower than that of DHT for the AR. This may also explain why compensatory AR overexpression is often observed.<ref name="Recent developments"/>

== Androgen receptor gene mutations ==
AR gene [[mutation]]s in the LBD that alter ligand specificity and/or functional activity exist and are thought to contribute to the conversion of some AR antagonists into agonists, which explains the paradoxical temporary improvement sometimes observed in patients when antiandrogen therapy is stopped.<ref name="Molecular basis">{{cite journal|last=Miyamoto|first=H|coauthors=Rahman, MM, Chang, C|title=Molecular basis for the antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome.|journal=Journal of cellular biochemistry|date=2004-01-01|volume=91|issue=1|pages=3–12|pmid=14689576|doi=10.1002/jcb.10757}}</ref> These mutations can have great effect on the antagonist activities of current small molecule antiandrogens and make them less efficient in blocking AR function via indirect modulation from inside of the LBP. Recent studies with circulating tumor cells, suggest that the mutation frequency is higher than previously assumed based on tumor [[biopsy|biopsies]].<ref name="Detection">{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Y|coauthors=Palma, JF, Agus, DB, Wang, Y, Gross, ME|title=Detection of androgen receptor mutations in circulating tumor cells in castration-resistant prostate cancer.|journal=Clinical chemistry|date=2010 Sep|volume=56|issue=9|pages=1492–5|pmid=20581083|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2010.143297}}</ref>

The [[LNCaP]] prostate cancer [[cell culture|cell line]] expresses AR with a T877A point mutation that causes proliferation in the presence of the antiandrogens hydroxyflutamide and cyproterone acetate.

== Current status ==
=== Peptide antiandrogens ===
[[Peptide antiandrogen]]s have been proposed to overcome the limitations of current antiandrogens regarding mutant ARs, by directly blocking AR function from protein surface, outside of the LBP. This direct blockade is thought to provide a more efficient strategy to avoid or overcome abnormal AR action during AWS, as well as allowing for more flexibility in structural modification without the space limitations of the rigid LBP.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>

Steroid receptors have similarities in terms of gene sequences and protein structures, leading often to functional crosstalk among steroid receptors. One of the criteria for AR peptide antagonists is to achieve high degree of specificity for the AR. It is though important to realize that AR specificity does not necessarily translate ''in vivo'', since peptide antagonists may also interact with protein targets other than AR.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>

==== Ligand binding domain as target site ====
AR activation requires the formation of a functional activation function 2 (AF2) region in AR LBD that mediates the interactions between AR and various transcription [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]. Therefore most of the research on peptide AR antagonists focuses on [[peptide]]s that may directly block the AF2 in AR LBD from protein surface. Even in bound mutant AR, peptide antagonists would be able to block the AF2 function via direct surface interaction, regardless of the ligand bound.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>

Research on these peptide antagonists are usually carried out by affinity screening of [[phage display]] libraries that express random peptides containing various [[Sequence motif|signature motifs]]. ARs seem to have a distinct preference for ‘FxxLF’ type of binding motifs (where F = [[phenylalanine]], L = [[leucine]], and X = any amino acid residue), whereas other nuclear receptors have a highly similar binding mechanism for ‘LxxLL’ type of binding motifs. This provides a unique opportunity for the development of AR-specific peptides.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>

Even though small molecule antagonists and peptide antagonist targeting AF2 surface differ in binding sites, they both inhibit AR function by disrupting AF2 function. Therefore mechanistically, these peptide antagonists may also be classified as ‘AF2 antagonists’.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>

[[File:Sintokamide A.svg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 8''' Sintokamide A]]

==== N-terminal domain as target site ====
Functionally, AR N-terminal domain (NTD) plays the primary role in regulating target gene transcription activation and mediating various receptor-protein and intra-receptor N-terminal and C-terminal interactions. Therefore modulation of NTD function is considered an efficient strategy to target AR action. Among various functional domains in different nuclear receptors, NTD is the least conserved and so could maybe become the best target site for peptide antagonists to achieve AR specificity. However the structural features of the NTD are undetermined due to a high degree of flexibility in its conformation. Both [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[circular dichroism|circular dichroism spectroscopy]] analysis suggest that AR NTD is highly disordered under native conditions, making it a difficult target for drug discovery.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>

In 2008 there were reports of a chlorinated peptide, [[Sintokamide A]], isolated from marine sponges that effectively inhibits AR N-terminal domain-activated reporter gene transcription, see figure 8.<ref name="Sintokamides">{{cite journal|last=Sadar|first=MD|coauthors=Williams, DE, Mawji, NR, Patrick, BO, Wikanta, T, Chasanah, E, Irianto, HE, Soest, RV, Andersen, RJ|title=Sintokamides A to E, chlorinated peptides from the sponge Dysidea sp. that inhibit transactivation of the N-terminus of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.|journal=Organic Letters|date=2008-11-06|volume=10|issue=21|pages=4947–50|pmid=18834139|doi=10.1021/ol802021w}}</ref> The evidence presented was not sufficient enough to support the conclusion that Sintokamide A directly inhibits the function of AR NTD, and the mechanism of action needs further investigation.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>

=== Selective androgen receptor modulators ===
Small molecule antiandrogens that are available today have undesirable side effects caused by complete, non-selective inhibition of AR action. To minimize these side effects, a new class of tissue [[selective androgen receptor modulator]]s (SARMs) has been proposed as a novel approach for the treatment of prostate cancer. These ligands should behave as antagonists in the prostate with either no activity or agonist activity in other target tissues, so as to have little or no effects in the anabolic tissues or [[central nervous system]] (CNS). However discovering this new class of ligands might be challenging because the molecular mechanism of AR action is not well understood.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>

Several mechanisms have been proposed to achieve this tissue selectivity of AR ligands. The most definitive evidence exists for the role of [[5-alpha reductase]]. 5-alpha reductase is only expressed in specific tissues and could therefore be a unique contributor to tissue selectivity. Specific inhibition of the type 2 enzyme by [[finasteride]] blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT in the prostate.<ref name="Peptide antagonist"/>
Several approaches might make use of the potential tissue-specific conversion to develop SARMs, including:
# Inactive parent compounds that are activated by type 2 5-alpha reductase in the prostate to form antiandrogens.
# AR agonists that are inactivated by type 2 5-alpha reductase in the prostate.

=== Natural antiandrogens ===

[[Atraric acid]] and [[N-butylbenzenesulfonamide]] are natural compounds with antiandrogen properties which have been purified from the bark of the African tree [[Prunus africana|Pygeum africanum]], see figures 9 and 10.<ref name="Pygeum">{{cite journal|last=Schleich|first=S|coauthors=Papaioannou, M, Baniahmad, A, Matusch, R|title=Extracts from Pygeum africanum and other ethnobotanical species with antiandrogenic activity.|journal=Planta medica|date=2006 Jul|volume=72|issue=9|pages=807–13|pmid=16783690|doi=10.1055/s-2006-946638}}</ref> ''In vitro'' assays have shown them both to be selective AR agonists and that they inhibit proliferation of several prostate cancer cell lines. Atraric acid also hinders extracellular matrix invasion and both compounds are able to prevent androgen-induced nuclear translocation of the AR. More potent derivatives are currently being synthesized in hope of improving the pharmacological profile of these two compounds.<ref name="atraric acid">{{cite journal|last=Roell|first=D|coauthors=Baniahmad, A|title=The natural compounds atraric acid and N-butylbenzene-sulfonamide as antagonists of the human androgen receptor and inhibitors of prostate cancer cell growth.|journal=Molecular and cellular endocrinology|date=2011-01-30|volume=332|issue=1-2|pages=1–8|pmid=20965230|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2010.09.013}}</ref>
