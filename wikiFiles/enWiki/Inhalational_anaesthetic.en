An '''inhalational anaesthetic''' is a chemical compound possessing [[general anaesthetic]] properties that can be delivered via inhalation. They are administered by anaesthetists (a term which includes [[anesthesiologist|anaesthesiologist]]s, [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]]s, and [[Anesthesia#Anesthesiologist_assistants|anaesthesiologist assistants]]) through an anaesthesia mask, [[laryngeal mask airway]] or [[tracheal tube]] connected to some type of [[anaesthetic vaporiser]] and an [[anaesthetic machine|anaesthetic delivery system]]. Agents of significant contemporary clinical interest include [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] anaesthetic agents such as [[isoflurane]], [[sevoflurane]] and [[desflurane]], as well as certain anaesthetic gases such as [[nitrous oxide]] and [[xenon]].

==Gases==
Other [[gas]]es or vapours which produce general anaesthesia by inhalation include nitrous oxide, cyclopropane and xenon. These are stored in [[gas cylinder]]s and administered using [[Flow measurement|flowmeters]], rather than vaporisers. Cyclopropane is [[Explosive material|explosive]] and is no longer used for safety reasons, although otherwise it was found to be an excellent anaesthetic. Xenon is odourless and rapid in onset, but is expensive and requires specialised equipment to administer and monitor. Nitrous oxide, even at 80% concentration, does not quite produce surgical level anaesthesia in most persons at [[Atmospheric_pressure#Standard_atmospheric_pressure|standard atmospheric pressure]], so it must be used as an adjunct anaesthetic, along with other agents.

==Hyperbaric anaesthesia==
Under [[Wiktionary:hyperbaric|hyperbaric]] conditions ([[pressure]]s above normal [[atmospheric pressure]]), other gases such as [[nitrogen]], and [[noble gas]]es such as [[argon]], [[krypton]], and xenon become anaesthetics. When inhaled at high [[partial pressure]]s (more than about 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30 metres in [[scuba diving]]), nitrogen begins to act as an anaesthetic agent, causing [[nitrogen narcosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fowler |first=B |coauthors=Ackles, KN; Porlier, G |title=Effects of inert gas narcosis on behavior—a critical review. |journal=Undersea Biomed.

==Neurological theories of action==
{{Main|Theories of general anaesthetic action}}
The full mechanism of action of volatile anaesthetic agents is unknown and has been the subject of intense debate.  "Anesthetics have been used for 160 years, and how they work is one of the great mysteries of neuroscience," says anaesthesiologist James Sonner of the University of California, San Francisco. Anaesthesia research "has been for a long time a science of untestable hypotheses," notes Neil L. Harrison of Cornell University.<ref name="Comfortably Numb">John Travis, "Comfortably Numb, Anesthetics are slowly giving up the secrets of how they work," Science News. (July 3rd 2004). [http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040703/bob8.asp].</ref>

"Most of the injectable anesthetics appear to act on a single molecular target," says Sonner. "It looks like inhaled anesthetics act on multiple molecular targets. That makes it a more difficult problem to pick apart."

The possibility of anaesthesia by the inert gas argon in particular (even at 10 to 15 bar) suggests that the mechanism of action of volatile anaesthetics is an effect best described by [[physical chemistry]], and not a [[chemical bond]]ing action. However, the agent may bind to a receptor with a weak interaction . A physical interaction such as swelling of nerve cell membranes from gas solution in the lipid bilayer may be operative. Notably, the gases hydrogen, helium, and neon have not been found to have anaesthetic properties at any pressure. Helium at high pressures produces nervous irritation ("anti-anaesthesia"), suggesting that the anaesthetic mechanism(s) may be operated in reverse by this gas (i.e., nerve membrane compression). Also, some halogenated ethers (such as [[flurothyl]]) also possess this "anti-anaesthetic" effect, providing further evidence for this theory.
