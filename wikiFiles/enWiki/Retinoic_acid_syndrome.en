'''Retinoic acid syndrome''' (RAS) is a potentially life threatening complication observed in patients with [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]] (APML) and first thought to be specifically associated with [[Tretinoin|all-trans retinoic acid]] (ATRA) (also known as tretinoin) treatment.<ref name="pmid18945746">{{cite journal |author=Breccia M, Latagliata R, Carmosino I, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical and biological features of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients developing retinoic acid syndrome during induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and idarubicin |journal=Haematologica |volume=93 |issue=12 |pages=1918–20 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18945746 |doi=10.3324/haematol.13510 |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18945746}}</ref>  Subsequently it was recognized that so-called RAS appeared in APML patients who had been treated with another highly efficacious drug, [[arsenic trioxide]], and yet did not appear in patients treated with [[tretinoin]] for other disorders.  These facts and others support the notion that RAS depends on the presence of the malignant promyelocytes.  This has led to the growing deprecation of the term 'retinoic acid syndrome' and to an increasing use of the term '''differentiation syndrome''' to signify this APML treatment complication.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weinberger|first=Steven|title=Differentiation (retinoic acid) syndrome|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome|accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>

==Presentation==
The syndrome is characterized by dyspnea, fever, weight gain, hypotension, and pulmonary infiltrates.  This is effectively treated by giving [[dexamethasone]] and holding ATRA (or arsenic trioxide) in severe cases.  An elevated white count is sometimes associated with this syndrome, but is not a prerequisite.  

Once RAS has resolved, pro-differentiation chemotherapy can be resumed. 

==Etiology==
The etiology of RAS is not clear cut.  Several causes have been speculated including a [[capillary leak syndrome]] from [[cytokine]] release from the differentiating myeloid cells.  Alternatively, ATRA may cause the maturing myeloid cells to acquire the ability to infiltrate organs such as the lung.  

Mediation by [[cathepsin G]] has been suggested.<ref name="pmid11840279">{{cite journal |author=Tallman MS |title=Retinoic acid syndrome: a problem of the past? |journal=Leukemia |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=160–1 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11840279 |doi=10.1038/sj.leu.2402344}}</ref>
