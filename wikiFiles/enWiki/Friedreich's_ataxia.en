'''Friedreich's ataxia''' is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[inherited disease]] that causes [[Progressive illness|progressive damage]] to the [[nervous system]], resulting in symptoms ranging from [[gait disturbance]] to [[speech problem]]s; it can also lead to [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].

The [[ataxia]] of Friedreich's ataxia results from the [[degeneration]] of [[nerve tissue]] in the [[spinal cord]], in particular sensory neurons essential (through connections with the [[cerebellum]]) for directing muscle movement of the arms and legs. The spinal cord becomes thinner and nerve cells lose some of their [[myelin sheath]] (the insulating covering on some nerve cells that helps conduct [[nerve impulses]]). [[Mentation]] is spared in this condition.

The condition is named after the [[Germany|German]] physician [[Nikolaus Friedreich]], who first described it in the 1860s.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1406}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms typically begin sometime between the ages of 5 to 15 years, but in Late Onset FA may occur in the 20s or 30s. Symptoms include any combination, but not necessarily all, of the following:
* Muscle weakness in the arms and legs
* Loss of coordination
* [[Vision impairment]]
* [[Hearing impairment]]
* Slurred [[speech]]
* Curvature of the spine ([[scoliosis]])
* High [[plantar arch]]es ([[pes cavus]] deformity of the foot)
* [[Diabetes]] (about 20% of people with Friedreich's ataxia develop carbohydrate intolerance and 10% develop diabetes mellitus)<ref name=Diabetes>{{cite journal|last=Thoren|first=Claes|title=Diabetes Mellitus in Friedreich's Ataxia|journal=Acta Paediatrica|year=1962|month=June|volume=51|pages=239–247|pmid=13921008|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.1962.tb08680.x}}</ref>
* Heart disorders (e.g., [[atrial fibrillation]], and resultant [[tachycardia]] (fast heart rate) and hypertrophic [[cardiomyopathy]] )

It presents before 25 years of age with progressive staggering or stumbling gait and frequent falling. Lower extremities are more severely involved. The symptoms are slow and progressive. Long-term observation shows that many patients reach a plateau in symptoms in the patient's early adulthood. On average, after 10–15 years with the disease, patients are usually wheelchair bound and require assistance with all [[activities of daily living]].<ref>Pandolfo M (2009). "Friedreich ataxia: The clinical picture". ''Journal of Neurology'', '''256:''' (1 Suppl), 3-8, [[doi: 10.1007/s00415-009-1002-3]]</ref>

The following physical signs may be detected on [[physical examination]]:
* [[Cerebellar]]: [[Nystagmus]], fast [[saccadic]] eye movements, truncal ataxia, [[dysarthria]], [[dysmetria]].
* [[Lower motor neuron]] lesion: absent deep tendon reflexes.
* [[Pyramid (brainstem)|Pyramidal]]:  extensor plantar responses, and distal weakness are commonly found.
* [[Dorsal column]]: Loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation occurs.
* Cardiac involvement occurs in 91% of patients, including [[cardiomegaly]] (up to dilated [[cardiomyopathy]]), symmetrical [[hypertrophy]], [[heart murmurs]], and conduction defects. Median age of death is 35 years, while females have better prognosis with a 20-year survival of 100% as compared to 63% in men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

20% of cases are found in association with [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=Diabetes />

== Genetics ==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Friedreich&#39;s ataxia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Friedreich’s ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs when the FXN gene contains amplified [[intronic]] GAA repeats. The FXN gene encodes the protein [[frataxin]].<ref name="pmid21734495">{{cite journal |author=Klockgether T |title=Update on degenerative ataxias |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurol. |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=339–45 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21734495 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e32834875ba}}</ref>  GAA repeat expansion causes frataxin levels to be reduced. Frataxin is an iron binding protein responsible for forming iron-sulphur clusters. One result of frataxin deficiency is mitochondrial iron overload which can cause damage to many proteins.<ref name="pmid21734495"/> The exact role of frataxin in normal physiology remains unclear.<ref>{{cite pmid|21550666}}</ref>

The mutant gene contains expanded [[Trinucleotide repeat disorders|GAA triplet repeats]] in the first [[intron]];<ref>{{cite journal |author=Montermini L, Andermann E, Labuda M, ''et al.'' |title=The Friedreich ataxia GAA triplet repeat: premutation and normal alleles |journal=Hum. Mol. Genet. |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=1261–6 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9259271 |doi=10.1093/hmg/6.8.1261 |url=}}</ref> in a few pedigrees, [[point mutations]] have been detected. Because the defect is located in an [[intron]] (which is removed from the mRNA transcript between [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]), this mutation does not result in the production of abnormal frataxin proteins. Instead, the mutation causes [[gene silencing]] (i.e., the mutation decreases the transcription of the gene) through induction of a [[heterochromatin]] structure in a manner similar to [[position-effect variegation]].<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1150420-overview</ref>

Besides reducing expression of frataxin, long tracts of GAA repeats induce chromosome breaks in ''in vivo'' yeast studies.

== Pathology==

The primary site of pathology is spinal cord and [[peripheral nerves]]. [[Sclerosis (medicine)|Sclerosis]] and [[degeneration]] of dorsal root ganglion, [[spinocerebellar tracts]], [[Lateral corticospinal tract]]s, and posterior columns.<ref name="Delatycki M, Williamson R, Forrest S 2000 1–8 As">{{cite journal |author=Delatycki M, Williamson R, Forrest S |title=Friedreich ataxia: an overview |journal=J Med Genet |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 As |year=2000 |pmid=10633128 |doi=10.1136/jmg.37.1.1 |pmc=1734457}}</ref> The motor neurons of the spinal cord are spared.  In peripheral nerves there is a loss of large myelinated fibres.

Progressive destruction of [[dorsal root ganglium|dorsal root ganglia]] accounts for thinning of dorsal roots, degeneration of dorsal columns, transsynaptic atrophy of nerve cells in Clarke's column and [[dorsal spinocerebellar fiber]]s, atrophy of [[gracile nucleus|gracile]] and [[cuneate nucleus|cuneate nuclei]] and neuropathy of sensory nerves. The lesion of the [[dentate nucleus]] consists of progressive and selective atrophy of large glutamatergic neurons and grumose degeneration of corticonuclear synaptic terminals that contain [[gama-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA). Small GABA-ergic neurons and their projection fibers in the [[dentato-olivary tract]] survive. Atrophy of [[Betz cell]]s and [[corticospinal tract]]s constitute a second lesion. 

===Pathogenesis===

Low frataxin levels lead to insufficient biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters that are required for mitochondrial electron transport and assembly of functional [[aconitase]] and iron dysmetabolism of the entire cell.

== Treatment ==
A person suffering from Friedreich's Ataxia may require some surgical interventions (mainly for the spine and heart). Often, titanium screws and rods are inserted in the spine to help prevent or slow the progression of scoliosis. As progression of ataxia occurs, assistive devices such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair are required for mobility and independence. Other 
[[assistive technology]], such as a [[standing frame]], can help reduce the secondary complications of prolonged use of a [[wheelchair]]. The goal of surgery is to keep the patient ambulatory as long as possible.

In many cases, patients experience significant heart conditions as well. These conditions, fortunately, are much more treatable, and are often countered with [[ACE inhibitor]]s such as enalapril or lisinopril and other heart medications such as [[digoxin]].

Persons with Friedreich’s ataxia may also benefit from a conservative treatment approach for the management of symptoms. Health professionals educated in neurological conditions, such as [[physical therapists]] and [[occupational therapists]], can prescribe an exercise program tailored to maximize function and independence. To address the ataxic gait pattern and loss of [[proprioception]] typically seen in persons with Friedreich’s ataxia, [[physical therapists]] can use visual cueing during [[gait]] training to help facilitate a more efficient [[gait]] pattern.<ref name=powers>{{cite journal | title = Holding Steady: How physical therapy can help patients with Friedreich's Ataxia | journal = Advance | date = 2007-01-01 | first = Wendy | last = Powers | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 26| id = | url = http://www.fortnet.org/fapg/PTarticleFA.htm | accessdate = 2011-05-16}}</ref>  The prescription of an assistive device along with [[gait]] training can also prolong independent ambulation.<ref name=powers/> 

Low intensity strengthening exercises should also be incorporated to maintain functional use of the upper and lower extremities.<ref name=mda>{{cite web | url = http://www.mdausa.org/publications/fa-fried-qa.html | title = Facts About Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) | accessdate = 2011-05-16 | year = 2011 | work = Muscular Dystrophy Association  }}</ref>  Fatigability should be monitored closely. Stabilization exercises of the trunk and low back can help with postural control and the management of [[scoliosis]].<ref name=powers/> This is especially indicative if the person is non-ambulatory and requires the use of a wheelchair. Balance and coordination training using visual feedback can also be incorporated into activities of daily living.<ref name=powers/> Exercises should reflect functional tasks such as cooking, transfers and self-care.  Along with gait training, balance and coordination training should be developed to help minimize the risk of falls.<ref name=powers/> 

Stretching exercises can be prescribed to help relieve tight musculature due to [[scoliosis]] and [[pes cavus]] deformities.<ref name=mda/>

Idebenone, a prescription medicine, was recently removed from the Canadian market due to lack of effectiveness.<ref>http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2013/23519a-eng.php</ref>

==Epidemiology==

Friedreich's ataxia is the most prevalent inherited ataxia,<ref name="pmid16677089">{{cite journal |author=Lodi R, Tonon C, Calabrese V, Schapira AH |title=Friedreich's ataxia: from disease mechanisms to therapeutic interventions |journal=Antioxid. Redox Signal. |volume=8 |issue=3–4 |pages=438–43 |year=2006 |pmid=16677089 |doi=10.1089/ars.2006.8.438}}</ref> affecting about 1 in 50,000 people in the United States. Males and females are affected equally.  The estimated carrier prevalence is 1:110.

A 1984 Canadian study was able to trace 40 cases of classical Friedreich's disease from 14 [[French-Canadian]] kindreds previously thought to be unrelated to one common ancestral couple arriving in [[New France]] in 1634: [[Jean Guyon]] and Mathurine Robin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barbeau A, Sadibelouiz M, Roy M, Lemieux B, Bouchard JP, Geoffroy G |title=Origin of Friedreich's disease in Quebec |journal=The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

==History==
Friedreich, working as a professor of [[pathology]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]], reported five patients with the condition in a series of three papers in 1863.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Friedreich N | title=Ueber degenerative Atrophie der spinalen Hinterstränge | journal=Arch Pathol Anat Phys Klin Med | volume=26 | issue=3–4 | pages=391–419 | year=1863 | doi=10.1007/BF01930976 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q604471402843464/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Friedreich N | title=Ueber degenerative Atrophie der spinalen Hinterstränge | journal=Arch Pathol Anat Phys Klin Med | volume=26 | issue=5–6 | pages=433–459 | year=1863 | doi=10.1007/BF01878006 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p7v1w77p78q1u141/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Friedreich N | title=Ueber degenerative Atrophie der spinalen Hinterstränge | journal=Arch Pathol Anat Phys Klin Med | volume=27 | issue= 1–2| pages=1–26 | year=1863 | doi=10.1007/BF01938516 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x24714576631690x/}}</ref> Further observations appeared in a subsequent paper in 1876.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Friedreich N | title=Ueber Ataxie mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der hereditären Formen | journal=Arch Pathol Anat Phys Klin Med | volume=68 | issue=2 | pages=145–245 | year=1876 | doi=10.1007/BF01879049 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x5q361w022042147/ | format=PDF}}</ref>
