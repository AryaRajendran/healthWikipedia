'''3,4-DHSA''' is an organic compound which is the [[metabolite|intermediate product]] of the [[metabolism]] of [[cholesterol]], by the bacteria most commonly responsible for [[tuberculosis]] (''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'').<ref name="pmid19300498">{{PDB|2ZI8}}; {{cite journal | author = Yam KC, D'Angelo I, Kalscheuer R, Zhu H, Wang JX, Snieckus V, Ly LH, Converse PJ, Jacobs WR, Strynadka N, Eltis LD | title = Studies of a Ring-Cleaving Dioxygenase Illuminate the Role of Cholesterol Metabolism in the Pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = PLoS Pathog. | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = e1000344 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19300498 | pmc = 2652662 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000344 | editor1-last = Ramakrishnan | editor1-first = Lalita }}</ref>   3,4-DHSA is an acronym for 3,4-<u>'''d'''</u>i<u>'''h'''</u>ydroxy-9,10-<u>'''s'''</u>eco-<u>'''a'''</u>ndrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione, the [[IUPAC nomenclature|official name]] of this substance.

A particular type of [[enzyme]] known as  [[biphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase|extradiol dioxygenase]] is responsible for the [[redox|oxidation]] and [[Cyclic_compound#Ring-closing_.26_opening_reactions|ring opening]] of 3,4-DHSA to 4,9-DSHA (see metabolic scheme below). ''M. tuberculosis'' bacteria that are deficient in this enzyme are less lethal than wild-type bacteria.  3,4-DHSA itself appears to be toxic to the bacteria while the breakdown products of 3,4-DHSA can be used as energy source by the bacteria. Hence blocking the oxidation of 3,4-DHSA by the extradiol dioxygenase enzyme may be useful in the treatment of tuberculosis.<ref name="pmid19300498"/>

A crystal structure of DHSA in complex with ''M. tuberculosis'' iron-dependent extradiol dioxygenase has been determined.<ref name="pmid19300498"/>
