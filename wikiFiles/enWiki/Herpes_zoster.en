'''Herpes zoster''' (or simply '''zoster'''), commonly known as '''shingles''' and also known as '''zona''', is a [[viral disease]] characterized by a [[pain]]ful skin rash with [[blister]]s in a limited area on one side of the body, often in a stripe. The initial infection with [[varicella zoster virus]] (VZV) causes the acute (short-lived) illness [[chickenpox]] which generally occurs in children and young adults. Once an episode of chickenpox has resolved, the virus is not eliminated from the body but can go on to cause shingles — an illness with very different symptoms — often many years after the initial infection. Herpes zoster is not the same disease as [[herpes simplex]], despite the name similarity; both the varicella zoster virus and [[herpes simplex virus]] belong to the same viral subfamily [[Alphaherpesvirinae]].

Varicella zoster virus can become [[Virus latency|latent]] in the [[neuron|nerve cell bodies]] and less frequently in [[Satellite cells|non-neuronal satellite cells]] of [[Dorsal root ganglion|dorsal root]], [[Cranial nerves|cranial nerve]] or [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] [[ganglion]],<ref name=pmid12676845/> without causing any [[symptoms]].<ref name=pmid12211045/> Years or decades after a chickenpox infection, the virus may break out of nerve cell bodies and travel down nerve [[axon]]s to cause viral infection of the skin in the region of the nerve. The virus may spread from one or more ganglia along nerves of an affected [[Segmentation (biology)|segment]] and infect the corresponding [[Dermatomic area|dermatome]] (an area of skin supplied by one spinal nerve) causing a painful rash.<ref name=pmid1666443>{{cite journal |author=Peterslund NA |title=Herpesvirus infection: an overview of the clinical manifestations |journal=Scand J Infect Dis Suppl |volume=80 |issue= |pages=15–20 |year=1991 |pmid=1666443 }}</ref><ref name=pmid14583142/> Although the rash usually heals within two to four weeks, some sufferers experience residual nerve pain for months or years, a condition called [[postherpetic neuralgia]]. Exactly how the virus remains latent in the body, and subsequently re-activates is not understood.<ref name=pmid12676845/>

Throughout the world the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence rate]] of herpes zoster every year ranges from 1.2 to 3.4 cases  per 1,000 healthy individuals, increasing to 3.9–11.8 per year per 1,000 individuals among those older than 65 years.<ref name=pmid17143845/><ref name=pmid7618983/><ref name="pmid17939895"/> Over a lifetime, a large fraction of people develop herpes zoster, though usually only once — in a 1960s U.S. study, 50% of individuals living to age 85 had at least one attack, while 1% had at least two attacks.<ref name="hopesimpson65" /> [[Antiviral drug]] treatment can reduce the severity and duration of herpes zoster if a seven- to ten-day course of these drugs is started within 72 hours of the appearance of the characteristic rash.<ref name=pmid17143845/><ref name=pmid18241179>{{cite journal |author=Cunningham AL, Breuer J, Dwyer DE, Gronow DW, Helme RD, Litt JC, Levin MJ, Macintyre CR |title=The prevention and management of herpes zoster |journal=Med.

In most cases after one to two days, but sometimes as long as three weeks, the initial phase is followed by the appearance of the characteristic skin rash. The pain and rash most commonly occurs on the torso, but can appear on the face, eyes or other parts of the body. At first the rash appears similar to the first appearance of [[hives]]; however, unlike hives, herpes zoster causes skin changes limited to a [[Dermatomic area|dermatome]], normally resulting in a stripe or belt-like pattern that is limited to one side of the body and does not cross the midline.<ref name=pmid10794584/> <!-- Do not delete anchor, links from Bell's Palsy -->{{Anchor|Zoster sine herpete}} ''Zoster sine herpete'' ("zoster without herpes") describes a patient who has all of the symptoms of herpes zoster except this characteristic rash.<ref name=pmid10980741>{{cite journal |author=Furuta Y, Ohtani F, Mesuda Y, Fukuda S, Inuyama Y |title=Early diagnosis of zoster sine herpete and antiviral therapy for the treatment of facial palsy |journal=Neurology |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=708–710 |year=2000 |pmid=10980741 |doi=10.1212/WNL.55.5.708}}</ref>

Later the rash becomes [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicular]], forming small [[blister]]s filled with a [[serous exudate]], as the fever and general malaise continue. The painful vesicles eventually become cloudy or darkened as they fill with blood, crust over within seven to ten days; usually the crusts fall off and the skin heals, but sometimes, after severe blistering, scarring and discolored skin remain.<ref name=pmid10794584/>

Herpes zoster may have additional symptoms, depending on the [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]] involved. ''Herpes zoster [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmicus]]'' involves the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit of the eye]] and occurs in approximately 10% to 25% of cases. It is caused by the virus reactivating in the [[ophthalmic division]] of the [[trigeminal nerve]]. In a few patients, symptoms may include [[conjunctivitis]], [[keratitis]], [[uveitis]], and [[optic nerve]] [[:wikt:palsy|palsies]] that can sometimes cause chronic ocular inflammation, loss of vision, and debilitating pain.<ref name=pmid12449270>{{cite journal| author=Shaikh S, Ta CN| title=Evaluation and management of herpes zoster ophthalmicus| journal=Am Fam Physician| year=2002| volume=66| issue=9| pages=1723–1730| pmid=12449270| url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20021101/1723.html}}</ref> ''Herpes zoster oticus'', also known as [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II]], involves the [[ear]]. It is thought to result from the virus spreading from the [[facial nerve]] to the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]]. Symptoms include [[hearing loss]] and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] (rotational dizziness).<ref name=pmid12676845/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:A Course of Shingles diagram.png|right|Progression of herpes zoster. A cluster of small bumps (1) turns into blisters (2).

The causative agent for herpes zoster is [[varicella zoster virus]] (VZV), a double-stranded [[DNA virus]] related to the [[Herpes simplex virus]] group. Most people are infected with this virus as children, and suffer from an episode of [[chickenpox]]. The immune system eventually eliminates the virus from most locations, but it remains dormant (or [[viral latency|latent]]) in the [[ganglion|ganglia]] adjacent to the spinal cord (called the [[dorsal root ganglion]]) or the ganglion semilunare (ganglion Gasseri) in the base of the skull.<ref name=pmid17945155>{{cite journal|author=Steiner I, Kennedy PG, Pachner AR| title=The neurotropic herpes viruses: herpes simplex and varicella-zoster| journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet Neurol]]| volume=6| issue=11| pages=1015–1028| year=2007| pmid=17945155| doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70267-3}}</ref> Repeated attacks of herpes zoster are rare,<ref name=pmid10794584/> and it is extremely rare for patients to suffer more than three recurrences.<ref name=pmid17945155/>

Herpes zoster occurs only in people who have been previously infected with VZV; although it can occur at any age, approximately half of the cases in the USA occur in those aged 50 years or older.<ref name=pmid18021864>{{cite journal| author=Weinberg JM| title=Herpes zoster: epidemiology, natural history, and common complications| journal=J Am Acad Dermatol| volume=57| issue=6 Suppl| pages=S130–S135| year=2007| pmid=18021864| doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2007.08.046}}</ref> The disease results from the virus reactivating in a single sensory ganglion.<ref name="pmid14583142">{{cite journal| author=Gilden DH, Cohrs RJ, Mahalingam R| title=Clinical and molecular pathogenesis of varicella virus infection| journal=Viral Immunol| volume=16| issue=3| pages=243–258| year=2003| pmid=14583142| doi=10.1089/088282403322396073}}</ref> In contrast to [[Herpes simplex virus]], the latency of VZV is poorly understood.

Unless the [[immune system]] is compromised, it suppresses reactivation of the virus and prevents herpes zoster.

As with chickenpox and/or other forms of herpes, direct contact with an active rash can spread VZV to a person who has no immunity to the virus. This newly infected individual may then develop chickenpox, but will not immediately develop shingles. Until the rash has developed crusts, a person is extremely contagious. A person is not infectious before blisters appear, or during postherpetic neuralgia (pain after the rash is gone).<ref name=pmid10794584/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Herpes zoster chest.png|right|thumb|Herpes zoster on the chest]]
If the rash has appeared, identifying this disease (making a [[differential diagnosis]]) requires only a visual examination, since very few diseases produce a rash in a [[dermatomic area|dermatomal pattern (see map)]]. However, [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV) can occasionally produce a rash in such a pattern. The [[Tzanck test|Tsanck smear]] is helpful for diagnosing acute infection with a herpes virus, but does not distinguish between HSV and VZV.<ref name=pmid2842739>{{cite journal | author = Oranje AP, Folkers E | title = The Tzanck smear: old, but still of inestimable value | journal = Pediatr Dermatol | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–129 | year = 1988 | pmid = 2842739 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1470.1988.tb01154.x}}</ref>

When the rash is absent (early or late in the disease, or in the case of zoster sine herpete), herpes zoster can be difficult to diagnose.<ref name=pmid15334402>{{cite journal| author=Chan J, Bergstrom RT, Lanza DC, Oas JG| title=Lateral sinus thrombosis associated with zoster sine herpete| journal=Am J Otolaryngol| volume=25| issue=5| pages=357–360| year=2004| pmid=15334402| doi=10.1016/j.amjoto.2004.03.007}}</ref> Apart from the rash, most symptoms can occur also in other conditions.

In a recent study, samples of lesions on the skin, eyes, and lung from 182 patients with presumed herpes simplex or herpes zoster were tested with [[real-time PCR]] or with [[viral culture]].  In this comparison, viral culture detected VZV with only a 14.3% sensitivity, although the test was highly specific (specificity=100%). By comparison, real-time PCR resulted in 100% [[sensitivity and specificity]]. Overall testing for herpes simplex and herpes zoster using PCR showed a 60.4% improvement over viral culture.<ref name=pmid15072752>{{cite journal | author = Stránská R, Schuurman R, de Vos M, van Loon AM. | title = Routine use of a highly automated and internally controlled real-time PCR assay for the diagnosis of herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus infections | journal = J Clin Virol. | volume=30 | issue=1| pages=39–44 | year=2003 | pmid=15072752 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcv.2003.08.006}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, population-based varicella immunization is not practiced.

However, a study on untreated herpes zoster shows that, once the rash has cleared, postherpetic neuralgia is very rare in people under 50 and wears off in time; in older people the pain wore off more slowly, but even in people over 70, 85% were pain free one year after their shingles outbreak.<ref name=pmid11009518>{{cite journal | author= Sigurdur Helgason et al  | title = Prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia after a single episode of herpes zoster: prospective study with long term follow up | journal= British Medical Journal  | volume=321 | year=2000  | pmid=11009518  |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7264/794|format=PDF | doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7264.794 | issue= 7264 | pages= 794–796 | pmc= 27491}}</ref>

===Analgesics===
People with mild to moderate pain can be treated with [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[analgesics]]. Topical lotions containing [[calamine]] can be used on the rash or blisters and may be soothing. Occasionally, severe pain may require an opioid medication, such as [[morphine]]. Once the lesions have crusted over, [[capsaicin]] cream (Zostrix) can be used. Topical [[lidocaine]] and nerve blocks may also reduce pain.<ref name=pmid15061819>{{cite journal| author=Baron R| title=Post-herpetic neuralgia case study: optimizing pain control| journal=Eur. J. Neurol| volume=11 Suppl 1| pages=3–11| year=2004| pmid=15061819| doi=10.1111/j.1471-0552.2004.00794.x}}</ref>  Administering [[gabapentin]] along with antivirals may offer relief of postherpetic neuralgia.<ref name=pmid18021865/>

===Antivirals===
[[Antiviral drugs]] inhibit VZV replication and reduce the severity and duration of herpes zoster with minimal side effects, but do not reliably prevent [[postherpetic neuralgia]]. Of these drugs, [[acyclovir]] has been the standard treatment, but the new drugs [[valaciclovir]] and [[famciclovir]] demonstrate similar or superior efficacy and good safety and tolerability.<ref name=pmid18021865/> The drugs are used both as [[prophylaxis]] (for example in [[AIDS]] patients) and as therapy during the [[Acute (medical)|acute phase]]. Antiviral treatment is recommended for all [[immunocompetent]] individuals with herpes zoster over 50 years old, preferably given within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash.<ref name=PMID17939892>{{cite journal | author = Breuer J, Whitley R | title = Varicella zoster virus: natural history and current therapies of varicella and herpes zoster | journal = Herpes | volume = 14 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages =25–29 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17939892 | url =http://www.ihmf.org/journal/download/2%20-%20Herpes%2014.2%20suppl%20Breuer.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Complications in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] individuals with herpes zoster may be reduced with [[intravenous]] [[acyclovir]].

===Steroids===
Orally administered [[glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]] are frequently used in treatment of the infection, despite clinical trials of this treatment being unconvincing. Nevertheless, one trial studying [[immunocompetent]] patients older than 50 years of age with localized herpes zoster, suggested that administration of [[prednisone]] with [[aciclovir]] improved healing time and quality of life.<ref name=pmid8702088>{{cite journal |author=Whitley RJ, Weiss H, Gnann JW, Tyring S, Mertz GJ, Pappas PG, Schleupner CJ, Hayden F, Wolf J, Soong SJ |title=Acyclovir with and without prednisone for the treatment of herpes zoster.

Med. |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=376–383 |year=1996 |pmid=8702088}}</ref> Upon one-month evaluation, aciclovir with prednisone increased the likelihood of crusting and healing of lesions by about twofold, when compared to placebo. This trial also evaluated the effects of this drug combination on quality of life at one month, showing that patients had less pain, and were more likely to stop the use of [[analgesic]] agents, return to usual activities and have uninterrupted sleep. However, when comparing cessation of herpes zoster-associated pain or post herpetic neuralgia, there was no difference between aciclovir plus prednisone and simply aciclovir alone. Because of the risks of corticosteroid treatment, it is recommended that this combination of drugs only be used in people more than 50 years of age, due to their greater risk of postherpetic neuralgia.<ref name=pmid8702088/>

==Prognosis==
The rash and pain usually subside within three to five weeks, but about one in five patients develop a painful condition called [[postherpetic neuralgia]], which is often difficult to manage. In some patients, herpes zoster can reactivate presenting as ''zoster sine herpete'': pain radiating along the path of a single spinal nerve (a ''dermatomal distribution''), but without an accompanying [[rash]]. This condition may involve complications that affect several levels of the [[nervous system]] and cause many [[brain|cranial]] [[neuropathy|neuropathies]], [[neuritis|polyneuritis]], [[myelitis]], or [[aseptic meningitis]]. Other serious effects that may occur in some cases include partial [[Bell's palsy|facial paralysis]] (usually temporary), ear damage, or [[encephalitis]].<ref name=pmid12676845/> During pregnancy, first infections with VZV, causing chickenpox, may lead to infection of the fetus and complications in the newborn, but chronic infection or reactivation in shingles are not associated with fetal infection.<ref name=pmid3012334>{{cite journal |author=Paryani SG, Arvin AM |title=Intrauterine infection with varicella-zoster virus after maternal varicella |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine|N.

Although herpes zoster typically resolves within 2 weeks, certain complications may arise:
* Secondary bacterial infection
* Motor involvement — including weakness especially in "motor herpes zoster"
* Eye involvement — [[trigeminal nerve]] involvement (as seen in herpes ophthalmicus) should be treated early and aggressively as it may lead to blindness. Involvement of the tip of the nose in the zoster rash is a strong predictor of herpes ophthalmicus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec09/ch102/ch102e.html|title=Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus|work=Merck Manual (Merk.com)|date=October 2008|accessdate=June 2010}}</ref>

==History==
Herpes zoster has a long recorded history, although historical accounts fail to distinguish the blistering caused by VZV and those caused by [[smallpox]],<ref name=pmid18021864/> [[ergotism]], and [[erysipelas]]. It was only in the late 18th century that [[William Heberden]] established a way to differentiate between herpes zoster and smallpox,<ref>{{cite book|author=Weller TH |year=2000 |chapter=Chapter 1. Historical perspective |title=Varicella-Zoster Virus: Virology and Clinical Management |editor=Arvin AM, Gershon AA |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-66024-6}}</ref> and only in the late 19th century that herpes zoster was differentiated from [[erysipelas]]. In 1831, [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]] hypothesized that the disease arose from the dorsal root ganglion, and this was confirmed in an 1861 paper by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Felix von Bärensprung|Felix von Bärensprung]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oaklander AL |title=The pathology of shingles: Head and Campbell's 1900 monograph |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=56 |issue=10 |pages=1292–1294 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10520948 |doi= 10.1001/archneur.56.10.1292|url=}}</ref>

The first indications that chickenpox and herpes zoster were caused by the same virus were noticed at the beginning of the 20th century. Physicians began to report that cases of herpes zoster were often followed by chickenpox in the younger people who lived with the shingles patients. The idea of an association between the two diseases gained strength when it was shown that lymph from a sufferer of herpes zoster could induce chickenpox in young volunteers. This was finally proved by the first isolation of the virus in [[cell cultures]], by the Nobel laureate [[Thomas Huckle Weller]], in 1953.<ref name=pmid13064265>{{cite journal |author=Weller TH |title=Serial propagation in vitro of agents producing inclusion bodies derived from varicella and herpes zoster |journal=Proc.

Until the 1940s, the disease was considered benign, and serious complications were thought to be very rare.<ref>{{cite book |author=Holt LE, McIntosh R |title=Holt's Diseases of Infancy and Childhood |year=1936 |publisher=D Appleton Century Company |pages=931–933}}</ref> However, by 1942, it was recognized that herpes zoster was a more serious disease in adults than in children, and that it increased in frequency with advancing age. Further studies during the 1950s on immunosuppressed individuals showed that the disease was not as benign as once thought, and the search for various therapeutic and preventive measures began.<ref name=Weller>{{cite book |author=Weller TH |chapter=Varicella-herpes zoster virus |title=Viral Infections of Humans: Epidemiology and Control |editor=Evans AS, Kaslow RA |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1997 |pages=865–892 |isbn=978-0-306-44855-3}}</ref> By the mid-1960s, several studies identified the gradual reduction in cellular immunity in old age, observing that in a cohort of 1,000 people who lived to the age of 85, approximately 500 (i.e., 50%) would have at least one attack of herpes zoster, and 10 (i.e., 1%) would have at least two attacks.<ref name="hopesimpson65">{{cite journal |author=Hope-Simpson RE |year=1965 |title=The nature of herpes zoster; a long-term study and a new hypothesis |journal=Proc R Soc Med |volume=58 | pages=9–20 |pmid=14267505 |pmc=1898279 |issue=1}}</ref>

In historical shingles studies, shingles incidence generally increased with age.  However, in his 1965 paper, Dr. Hope-Simpson was first to suggest, “The peculiar age distribution of zoster may in part reflect the frequency with which the different age groups encounter cases of varicella and because of the ensuing boost to their antibody protection have their attacks of zoster postponed.”<ref name="Hope-Simpson"/>
Lending support to this hypothesis that contact with children with chickenpox boosts adult cell-mediated immunity to help postpone or suppress shingles, is the study by Thomas et al., which reported that adults in households with children had lower rates of shingles than households without children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thomas SL, Wheeler JG, Hall AJ |year=2002 |title=Contacts with varicella or with children and protection against herpes zoster in adults: a case-control study |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=360 | pages=678–682 |pmid=12241874 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09837-9 |issue=9334}}</ref> Also, the study by Terada et al. indicated that pediatricians reflected incidence rates from 1/2 to 1/8 that of the general population their age.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Terada K, Hiraga Y, Kawano S, Kataoka N |year=1995 |title=Incidence of herpes zoster in pediatricians and history of reexposure to varicella-zoster virus in patients with herpes zoster|journal=Kansenshogaku Zasshi |volume=69 |issue=8 | pages=908–912 |pmid=7594784}}</ref>

===Etymology===
The family name of all the [[herpesviridae]] is derived from the Greek word ''herpein'' ("to creep"),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/herpes |title=Herpes &#124; Define Herpes at Dictionary.com |work= |accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref> referring to the latent, recurring infections typical of this group of viruses. ''Zoster'' comes from Greek ''zōstēr'', meaning "belt" or "girdle", after the characteristic belt-like dermatomal rash.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Zoster |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |work= |accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref> The common name for the disease, ''shingles'', derives from the Latin ''cingulus'', a variant of Latin ''cingulum'' meaning "girdle".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=shingles&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |work= |accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref>
