'''''Dermatopathology''''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δέρμα}}, ''derma'', "skin"; {{lang|grc|πάθος}}, ''pathos'', "fate, harm"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is a subspecialty of both [[dermatology]] and [[surgical pathology]] that focuses on the study of cutaneous diseases at a microscopic level. It also encompasses analyses of the potential causes of skin diseases at a cellular level. Dermatopathologists work in close association with [[dermatologist]]s. In fact, some of them are trained primarily in dermatology themselves.<ref>http://www.abderm.org/subspecialties/derm.html</ref>

Dermatologists are able to recognize most skin diseases based on their appearances, anatomic distributions, and behavior. Sometimes, however, those criteria do not allow a conclusive diagnosis to be made, and a skin [[biopsy]] is taken to be examined under the [[microscope]]. That process reveals the [[histology]] of the disease and results in a specific diagnostic interpretation.  In some cases, additional specialized testing needs to be performed on biopsies, including [[immunofluorescence]], [[immunohistochemistry]], [[electron microscopy]], [[flow cytometry]], and molecular-pathologic analysis.<ref>http://www.dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermatopathology/stains.html</ref>

One of the greatest challenges of dermatopathology is its scope. More than 1500 different disorders of the skin exist, including cutaneous eruptions ("[[rashes]]") and [[neoplasms]]. Therefore, dermatopathologists must maintain a broad base of knowledge, and be familiar with several other specialty areas in [[Medicine]].<ref>http://booksfriend.blogspot.com/2010/10/dermatopathology-third-edition-by.html</ref>

Certification in dermatopathology in the United States requires the completion of a [[medical degree]], followed by residency training of 3 years in dermatology or 3 years in anatomic pathology (often completed as part of a 4 year combined residency in anatomic pathology and clinical pathology).  Thereafter, an additional 1 or 2 years of post-residency education in dermatopathology is undertaken. For trainees with a primary background in Pathology, the fellowship experience includes the equivalent of 6 months of clinical dermatology, and for those whose training is primarily in Dermatology, 6 months of the fellowship are devoted to anatomic pathology. In the United States, dermatopathologists are first certified by the [[American Board of Pathology|American Boards of Pathology]] or [[American Board of Dermatology|Dermatology]], or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Pathology|American Osteopathic Boards of Pathology]] or [[American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology|Dermatology]], and they then obtain subspecialty certification (termed "special competence") in dermatopathology by written examination.<ref>http://www.abpath.org/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aobd-derm.org/2012/02/12/certification-exam-summary/ |title=Certification Exam Summary |author= |year= 2012|work= |publisher=American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology |accessdate=2 October 2012}}</ref> Since 2003, the International Board of Dermatopathology (IBDP)-- headquartered in Graz, Austria—also has certified candidates from countries around the world.  This is done by IBDP review of applicants' professional qualifications, and a formal examination that is given in Europe each year.<ref>http://www.icdermpath.org/1/</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16420311 | doi=10.1111/j.0303-6987.2006.00390.x | volume=33 | issue=2 | title=International Board Certification in Dermatopathology: a worldwide effort to raise standards in dermatopathology | year=2006 | month=February | author=Kerl H, Cerroni L, Burg G, ''et al.'' | journal=J.
