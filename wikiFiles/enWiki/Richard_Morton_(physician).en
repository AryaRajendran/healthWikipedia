'''Richard Morton''' (1637–1698) was an English physician who was the first to state that [[Tubercle (anatomy)|tubercles]] were always present in the [[tuberculosis]] disease of the lungs. In Morton's time, this wasting disease was termed '''consumption''', or by its Greek name of '''phthisis'''.  Recognition of the many possible symptoms of this infection belonging to a single disease was not until the 1820s and it was [[Johann Lukas Schönlein|J.L. Schönlein]] in 1839 who introduced the term "tuberculosis".

==Life==
He was born in [[Worcestershire]] and, having trained at Oxford's [[Magdalen Hall]], elected to enter the Church, becoming Vicar of [[Kinver]] in [[Staffordshire]]. With his refusal to acquiesce to the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], he was forced to resign. His whereabouts for the following eight years are unclear, although he probably travelled to Holland. He reappeared in 1670 when, on the sponsorship of the [[Prince of Orange]], he was awarded doctorate of medicine by Oxford University.

==Works==
His landmark paper ''Phthisiologica, seu exercitationes de phthisi libris comprehensae. Totumque opus variis histories illustratum'' was published in Latin in 1689, with an English translation appearing in 1694.  A second English edition was published in 1720.   Its significance is partly due to the disease receiving little study by other doctors of the time despite it being a major cause of death; accounting for over 18% all deaths in the [[City of London]] in 1700. The paper is also significant in that it also contains the first recognised medical descriptions of the wasting condition now known as [[Anorexia Nervosa]]. 

Medicine of that time was deferential to the ideas of [[Galen]] and so Morton understandably mistook tubercles for being caused by glandular degenerations; ''mycobacterium tuberculosis'' not being identified until 1882 by [[Robert Koch]].
