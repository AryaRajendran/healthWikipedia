'''Thalidomide''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|θ|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|d|ə|m|aɪ|d}}) is an anti-nausea and [[sedative]] drug that was introduced in the late 1950s to be used as a [[sleeping pill]], and was quickly discovered to help pregnant women with the effects of [[morning sickness]].<ref name="UK Government grant"/> It was sold from 1957 until 1962, when it was withdrawn after being found to be a [[teratogen]], which caused many different forms of [[congenital disorder|birth defect]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2004/thalidomide.shtml|title=Thalidomide — A Second Chance? — programme summary|last=Anon|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref>

==History==

===Development===
Thalidomide was developed by German pharmaceutical company [[Grünenthal]], who obtained a patent for it in 1954.<ref name=grun>[http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Die_Fakten/Chronologie/152700079.jsp Thalidomide chronology on Grünenthal website]</ref> It was prescribed as a sedative, tranquilizer, and [[antiemetic]] for morning sickness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franks|first=Michael|coauthors=Gordon R. Macpherson and William D. Figg|title=Thalidomide|journal=Lancet|date=24|year=2004|month=May|volume=363|issue=9243}}</ref> Thalidomide, launched by Grünenthal on 1 October 1957,<ref name="Bombay">{{cite journal |last=Moghe |first=Vijay V |coauthors=Ujjwala Kulkarni, Urvashi I Parmar |year=2008|title=Thalidomide |journal=Bombay Hospital Journal|publisher=Bombay Hospital |location=Bombay |volume=50 |issue=3 |page=446 |url=http://www.bhj.org/journal/2008_5003_july/download/page-472-476.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref>  was proclaimed a "wonder drug" for [[insomnia]], coughs, colds, and headaches. It was also found to be an effective antiemetic that had an inhibitory effect on [[morning sickness]]. During this time period the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the fetus.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franks|first=Michael|coauthors=Gordon R. Macpherson and William D. Figg|title=Thalidomide|journal=lancet|date=24|year=2004|month=May|volume=363|page=1802}}</ref>  Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the [[placental barrier]] and harm the developing [[fetus]].<ref name="The chemical industry"/>, even though the effect of alcohol on foetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957<ref>See Rouquette (1957) cited by S. Landesman-Dwyer (1987) Maternal drinking and pregnancy outcome.  Applied Research in Mental Retardation 3, 241-263. ftp://senfiles.healthystartfv.org/Sort%20Literature%20Review%201970%20-%201989.Data/Landesman-Dwyer-1982-Maternal%20drinking%20an-0019226368/Landesman-Dwyer-1982-Maternal%20drinking%20an.pdf</ref>.  There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back to the use of the drug thalidomide. In late 1959, peripheral neuritis was noticed to develop in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over-the-counter.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kelsey|first=Frances|title=Events After Thalidomide|journal=Journal of Dental Research|year=1967|volume=46|issue=6|page=1202}}</ref>

In Canada, the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to April 1, 1961. There were many different forms sold, with the most common variant being Talimol.<ref name="autogenerated988">{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=J.F.|title=Canadian Thalidomide Experience|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=9|year=1963|month=November|volume=89|page=988}}</ref> Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects.<ref name="autogenerated988"/> It was not until March 2, 1962 that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the FDD, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=J.F.|title=Canadian Thalidomide Experience|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=9|year=1963|month=November|volume=89|page=989}}</ref>

===Birth defects crisis===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with [[deformities]] such as [[phocomelia]] as a consequence of thalidomide use.<ref name="Bren">{{cite news | first =Linda | last =Bren | author = | coauthors = | title =Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History | url =http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | work =FDA Consumer | publisher =U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date =2001-02-28 | accessdate =2009-12-23 }}</ref> It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been, although estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000.<ref name="nyt-answers"/> Despite the side effects, thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in Canada until 1962; Canada was the last country to end sales of the drug.<ref name="autogenerated988"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=21267|title=Turning Points of History — Prescription for Disaster|publisher=History Television|accessdate=24 February 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the drug was licensed in 1958 and withdrawn in 1961. Of the approximately 2,000 babies born with defects, around half died within a few months and 466 survived to at least 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8458855.stm|title=Apology for thalidomide survivors|date=14 January 2010|work=BBC News:Health|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref> 

The Australian obstetrician [[William McBride (doctor)|William McBride]] and the German [[pediatrician]] [[Widukind Lenz]] suspected a link between birth defects and the drug, a theory Lenz proved in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1002.html|title=Widukind Lenz|last=Anon|work=who name it?|publisher= Ole Daniel Enersen|accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref><ref name="40 years on">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2031459.stm|title=Thalidomide:40 years on|last=Anon|work=BBC news|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-05-01 | date=2002-06-07}}</ref> McBride was later awarded a number of honors, including a medal and prize money by L'Institut de la Vie in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Defect/page5i.htm |title=Report of Thalidomide at University of New South Wales |publisher=Embryology.med.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref>

The [[East German]] central pharmacy control also considered the drug. The head of the commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of [[glutamic acid]].<ref>[http://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/120351.html?sstr=Contergan DDR-Bürger schliefen ohne Contergan] [[Neues Deutschland]] 4 November 2007</ref> It took some time before the increase in [[dysmelia]] at the end of the 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958 Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in [[Bayreuth]] wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children.<ref name=daeb/> Based on this, [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] [[Whip (politics)|whip]] [[Erich Mende]] requested an official statement from the federal government.<ref name=daeb/> For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide.<ref name=daeb>[http://www.contergan-ag50.de/Seiten/presse/20111125-27_artikel/2007_Die_Contergan-Katastrophe_Die_truegerische_Sicherheit_der_harten_Daten-Deutsches_Aerzteblatt.pdf http://www.aerzteblatt.de/archiv/57224/ Klaus-Dieter Thomann, Die Contergan-Katastrophe: Die trügerische Sicherheit der „harten“ Daten] THEMEN DER ZEIT (Contergan disaster, the security illusion behind alleged hard facts )</ref> After the Nazi regime with its [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various [[Action T4|crimes]], western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor [[congenital disorder]]s in a similarly strict way. <ref Name ="th">Die Contergankatastrophe: Eine Bilanz Nach 40 Jahren, Ludwig Zichner, Michael A.

The project was led by pathologist [[Franz Büchner (pathologist)|Franz Büchner]] who ran the project to propagate his [[Teratology|teratological]] theory. Büchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons.<ref Name ="th"/> Furthermore, it took a while to install a Surgeon General in Germany; the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)]] was not founded until 1962, some months after thalidomide was banned from the market.<ref name=daeb/> In Germany approximately 2,500 thalidomide babies were born.<ref name="40 years on"/>

Several countries either restricted the drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, a member of the [[Austria]]n pharmaceutical admission conference enforced thalidomide (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of [[prescription medication]] and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland.<ref>[http://orf.at/070930-17124/index.html In Österreich bis 1962 auf dem Markt] auf [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]</ref> In the United States, [[pharmacologist]] [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] [[M.D.]] withstood pressure from the [[Marion Merrell Dow|Richardson-Merrell]] company and refused [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed.<ref name="Bren" /> This reduced the impact of thalidomide in United States patients. Although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States at the time, millions of tablets had been distributed to physicians during a clinical testing program. It was impossible to know how many pregnant women had been given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birthdefects.org/research/bendectin_1.php|title=How a Commonly Used Drug Caused Birth Defects|last=Mekdeci|first=Betty}}</ref>

===Aftermath of scandal===
[[Image:Kelsey 01.jpg|thumb|upright|1962: FDA pharmacologist [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] receives the [[President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service]] from President [[John F. Kennedy]] for blocking sale of thalidomide in the United States.]]
For correctly denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President [[John F. Kennedy]]. In September 2010, the FDA honored Kelsey with the first Kelsey award. The award, given annually to an FDA staff member, came 50 years after Kelsey, then a new medical officer at the agency, first reviewed the application from the William S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/health/14kelsey.html?_r=1&8dpc|title=The Public’s Quiet Savior From Harmful Medicines|date=13 September 2010|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

The numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women. The birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms. Possible birth defects include phocomelia, dysmelia, amelia, bone hypo plasticity, and other congenital defects affecting the ear, heart, or internal organs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franks|first=Michael|coauthors=Gordon R. Macpherson and William D. Figg|title=Thalidomide|journal=Lancet|date=29|year=2004|month=May|volume=363|page=1804}}</ref> Franks et al looked at how the drug affected new born babies, the severity of their deformities, and reviewed the drug in its early years. Webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused. “The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. this syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities.”<ref>{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=J.F.|title=Canadian Thalidomide Experience|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=9|year=1963|month=November|page=989}}</ref>

In 1968, after a long campaign by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', a compensation settlement for the UK victims was reached with [[Distillers Company]] (now part of [[Diageo]]), which had distributed the drug in the UK.<ref name="they didn't know">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3589173.stm|title=They just didn't know what it would do|last=Ryan|first=Caroline|date=1 April 2004|work=BBC News:Health|publisher=BBC news|accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article3602694.ece|title=Thalidomide: the battle for compensation goes on|last=Flintoff|first=John-Paul|date=March 23, 2008|work=The Sunday Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd.|accessdate=2009-05-01 | location=London}}</ref> This compensation, which is distributed by the Thalidomide Trust in the UK, was substantially increased by Diageo in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4658919.stm |title=Compensation offer on Thalidomide |publisher=BBC News |date=7 July 2005  |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> The UK Government gave survivors a grant of £20 million, to be distributed through the Thalidomide Trust, in December 2009.<ref name="UK Government grant">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8428838.stm |title=Thalidomide survivors to get £20m |publisher=BBC News |date=23 December 2009  |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

Melbourne woman Lynette Rowe, who was born without limbs, is leading an Australian [[class action]] lawsuit against the drug's manufacturer, Grünenthal, which fought to have the case heard in Germany. The Victorian Supreme Court dismissed Grünenthal's application in 2012, and the case was heard in Australia. More than a hundred Australian thalidomide survivors are involved in the class action, according to Rowe's lawyer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-19/australian-thalidomide-victims-win-hearing-bid/3738116|title=Australian thalidomide victims win right for hearing|date=19 December 2011|newspaper=ABC News}}</ref> On 17 July 2012, Lynette Rowe was awarded an out-of-court settlement, believed to be in the millions of dollars and paving the way for class action victims to receive further compensation.

On 31 August 2012, Grünenthal chief executive Harold Stock [http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Stellungnahme/Rede_anlaesslich_Einweihung_des_Contergan-Denkmals/224600963.jsp apologized] for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects. At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolize those harmed by thalidomide and apologized for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50&nbsp;years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology "insulting" and "too little, too late", and criticized the company for not compensating victims. They also criticized the company for their claim that no one could have known the harm the drug caused, arguing that there were plenty of red flags at the time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Thalidomide apology insulting, campaigners say|date=Septsmber 1, 2012 |work=BBC News |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19448046|date=September 1, 2012}}</ref>

====Change in drug regulations====

{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

The drug thalidomide’s birth defects in children affected many people’s lives, and from these events came the formation of the group called The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada, a group of 120 Canadian survivors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=Randolph|title=Living in a World With Thalidomide|journal=FDA Consumer|year=2001|month=May/April|volume=35|issue=2|page=40}}</ref> Their goal was to prevent future usage of the drug that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent tetrogenicity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franks|first=Michael|coauthors=Gordon R, Macpherson and William D. Figg|title=Thalidomide|journal=Lancet|year=1967|volume=363|page=1808}}</ref>

The effects of thalidomide increased the fear of the safety of pharmaceutical drugs. The Society of Toxicology of Canada was formed after the events of thalidomide were made public, focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Racz|first=William|coauthors=Donald J. Ecobichon and Marc Baril|title=On-Line Sourses of Toxicological Information in Canada|journal=Toxicology|year=2003|volume=190|page=3}}</ref> The need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster. The Society of Toxicology of Canada is responsible for the Conservation Environment Protection Act, focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Racz|first=William|coauthors=Donald J. Ecobichon and Marc Baril|title=On-Line Sources of Toxicological Information in Canada|journal=Toxicology|year=2003|page=3}}</ref> Thalidomide brought on the change in the way drugs are tested, what type of drugs are used during pregnancy, and increasing the awareness of potential side effects of drugs.

==Possible indications==

After being removed from the pharmaceutical market, thalidomide has been the subject of significant clinical research. To prevent birth defects, Celgene developed the STEPS protocol for clinical trials, which monitors trial participants for signs of pregnancy and requires use of two forms of contraception to prevent birth defects.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Fox|agency=Reuters|title=FDA Approves Drug that was Once Feared|newspaper=New Brunswick Telegraph Journal|date=17 July 1998}}</ref> The drug has since shown promise in the treatment of leprosy and certain forms of cancer.

Research also suggests that thalidomide is useful in treating complications of infection with [[HIV]], such as wasting syndrome, nausea, and prurigo nodularis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Haslett|first=Patrick|title=Adverse Reactions to Thalidomide in Patients Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=1997|month=June|volume=24|issue=6|page=1223|doi= 10.1086/513665}}</ref> However, it was also found that thalidomide's toxic side-effects are less well-tolerated in HIV patients, requiring caution during treatment.

Thalidomide has also been found to be effective in treating [[actinic prurigo]], an autoimmune skin disease.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2133.1983.tb04601.x}}</ref> Thalidomide has been used in chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood (CBDC) with encouraging results.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Madnani NA, Khan KJ |year=2010 |title=Linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood: Response to thalidomide |journal=Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology, and Leprology |volume=76 |issue=4 |page=427 |pmid=20657136 |doi=10.4103/0378-6323.66601 |url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2010;volume=76;issue=4;spage=427;epage=429;aulast=Madnani}}</ref> Peripheral neuritis may be a limiting factor for long term use of thalidomide.

Studies carried out in animal models have suggested the use of combined therapy with thalidomide and [[glucantime]] could have a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of visceral [[leshmaniasis]].<ref>{{ cite journal | last = Ghassem | first = S. | coauthors = Kariminia, A.; Abdi, K.; Darabi, M.; Ghareghozloo, B. | year = 2006 | title = Effects of combined therapy with thalidomide and glucantime on leishmaniasis induced by ''Leishmania major'' in BALB/c mice | journal = The Korean Journal of Parasitology | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–61 | url = http://synapse.koreamed.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/0066KJP/kjp-44-55.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.3347/kjp.2006.44.1.55 | pmid = 16514283 | pmc = 2532651 }}</ref>

A study published in April 2010 discussed the ability of thalidomide to induce vessel maturation, which may be useful as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of vascular malformations. The research was conducted in an experimental model of the genetic disease [[hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lebrin|first=Franck|coauthors=Srun S., Raymond2] K, Martin S., van den Brink S, Freitas C., Bréant C., Mathivet T., Larrivée B., Thomas J., Arthur H., Westermann C., Disch F., Mager J., Snijder R., Eichmann A., Mummery C.|month=April | year=2010|title=Thalidomide stimulates vessel maturation and reduces epistaxis in individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia|journal=Nature Medicine|pmid=20364125|volume=16|issue=4|pages=420–8|url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v16/n4/full/nm.2131.html|doi=10.1038/nm.2131|unused_data=Published online: 4 April 2010}}</ref>

===Leprosy treatment===
In 1964, biologist [[Jacob Sheskin]] administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited  [[Erythema nodosum|erythema nodosum leprosum&nbsp;(ENL)]], a painful skin condition, one of the complications of [[leprosy]]. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favorable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite journal |last= Silverman, MD |first= William |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2002-04-22|title=The Schizophrenic Career of a "Monster Drug" |journal=Pediatrics |volume= 110 |issue= 2 |pages= 404–6 |id= |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/110/2/404 |doi=10.1542/peds.110.2.404|pmid=12165600 }}</ref>

Thalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, resulting in 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy in people born in Brazil after 1965.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Castilla|first=E.E.|coauthors=et al.| year=1996|title=Thalidomide, a current teratogen in South America |journal=Teratology|publisher=Wiley-Liss|volume=54|pages=273–7|url=http://www.fundaciongillow.org/publicaciones/articulo4.pdf|pmid=9098920|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199612)54:6<273::AID-TERA1>3.0.CO;2-#|issue=6}}</ref> In 1990 a group of researchers in Brazil noted that TNF alpha levels went up in leprosy reactional states <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2015700</ref> and observed that TNF levels decreased in some patients on treatment with thalidomide.  A research fellow was sent to explore the mechanism of this effect to the lab of Dr. Kaplan at Rockefeller university.  Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, but cases of thalidomide embryopathy continue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paumgartten|first=J.R.|coauthors=Chahoud, Ibrahim|month=July | year=2006|title=Thalidomide embryopathy cases in Brazil after 1965|journal=Reproductive Toxicology |volume=22 |issue=1|pages=1, 2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TC0-4J2W0DX-1&_user=899537&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000047642&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=899537&md5=064ddf875924b5b116f6ed8d82049b07|doi=10.1016/j.reprotox.2005.11.007|pmid=16427249|last1=Paumgartten|first1=FJ|last2=Chahoud|first2=I}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Correio Braziliense|month=January | year=2006|title=Talidomida volta a assustar|url=http://www.saude.df.gov.br/003/00301009.asp?ttCD_CHAVE=31041}}</ref>

Further work conducted in 1991 by Gilla Kaplan and the brazilian fellow at [[Rockefeller University]] in New York City showed that thalidomide decreased TNF alpha levels in leprosy by enhancing the degradation of its mRNA. Kaplan believed thalidomide could be an effective treatment for AIDS given the cachectic effects of TNF alpha in this disease. She partnered with Celgene to further develop the potential for thalidomide in AIDS and tuberculosis.  However, clinical trials for AIDS proved disappointing.

In 1998 the FDA approved the drug's use in the treatment of ENL.<ref name="nyt-fda">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/us/thalidomide-approved-to-treat-leprosy-with-other-uses-seen.html|title=Thalidomide Approved to Treat Leprosy, With Other Uses Seen|newspaper=New York Times|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|accessdate=8 January 2012|date=17 July 1998}}</ref> Because of thalidomide's potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions.  The FDA required that [[Celgene Corporation]], which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name ''Thalomid'', establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program.  The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights only to authorized prescribers and pharmacies, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.<ref name="nyt-fda"/>

More recently, the [[World Health Organisation|World Health Organisation (WHO)]] has stated:

<blockquote>

"The WHO does not recommend the use of thalidomide in leprosy as experience has shown that it is virtually impossible to develop and implement a fool-proof surveillance mechanism to combat misuse of the drug. The drug [[clofazimine]] is now a component of the multidrug therapy (MDT), introduced by WHO in 1981 as the standard treatment for leprosy and now supplied free of charge to all patients worldwide."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/lep/research/thalidomide/en/index.html |title=Use of thalidomide in leprosy |last=Anon |work=WHO:leprosy elimination |publisher=WHO |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>
</blockquote>

===Cancer treatment===
In 1994 Harvard Professor Robert D'Amato at Boston Children's Hospital discovered that thalidomide was a potent inhibitor of new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis), which is required for tumor growth.<ref>{{cite pmid|7513432}}</ref>  He then showed in a rabbit cancer model that thalidomide suppressed tumor growth in animals.<ref>{{cite pmid|10408702}}</ref>  He also found that a subset of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as sulindac and dexamethasone, had moderate anti-angiogenic activity.  When these anti-inflammatory anti-angiogenic drugs were combined with thalidomide they increased both thalidomide's anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity.  Based on these discoveries, numerous cancer clinical trials for thalidomide were initiated with and without dexamethasone.<ref>http://vectorblog.org/2013/04/from-thalidomide-to-pomalyst-better-living-through-chemistry/</ref> 

Thalidomide was initially tested in humans as a single agent for the treatment of [[multiple myeloma]] due to its anti-angiogenic activity.<ref name="nejm-myeloma">{{cite doi| 10.1056/NEJM199911183412102}}</ref> The early foundation for this work was laid out in a 1993 keynote lecture at the American Society of Hematology by Dr. Folkman when he hypothesized that all blood borne malignancies are angiogenesis dependent based upon his discovery that the levels of the angiogenic growth factor FGF were elevated in the urine of patients with leukemia <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7508518</ref>. Further studies in his lab showed efficacy with the angiogenesis inhibitor TNP-470 in mouse models of leukemia.  Additionally, in 1994 Vacca had shown a five fold increase in angiogenesis in the bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7527645</ref>.  When the family of a patient with late stage multiple myeloma requested any possible help from Dr. Folkman in 1997, he attempted to obtain TNP-470 as a therapy.  However TNP-470 could not be obtained outside of the ongoing clinical trial and thus Dr. D'Amato suggested that thalidomide be used instead for this patient<ref>http://vectorblog.org/2013/04/from-thalidomide-to-pomalyst-better-living-through-chemistry/</ref>.  A small study was then initiated with thalidomide for this patient and several others by Dr. Bart Barlogie with dramatic effects<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10564685</ref>. 

Since then, many studies have shown that thalidomide, in combination with [[dexamethasone]], has increased the survival of multiple myeloma patients. The combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone, often in combination with [[melphalan]], is now one of the most common regimens for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, with an improved response rate of up to 60-70%.<ref>{{cite journal

Thalidomide appears to inhibit disease progression in multiple myeloma by several mechanisms:
*Inhibition of angiogenesis in the bone marrow, which is needed for myeloma cell proliferation.
*Inhibition of the production of [[interleukin-6]] (IL‑6), which is a growth factor for the proliferation of myeloma cells<ref name=Anderson2005>{{cite pmid|16344099}}</ref>
*Activation of [[apoptotic pathway]]s through [[caspase&nbsp;8]]-mediated cell death<ref name=Anderson2005/>
*At the mitochondrial level, thalidomide results in induction of [[c-jun terminal kinase]] (JNK).<ref name=Anderson2005/>
*Activation of [[T&nbsp;cells]] to produce [[Interleukin 2|IL‑2]], thereby altering the amount and function of [[natural killer cell]]s (NK&nbsp;cells), thus augmenting the activity of NK‑dependent cytotoxicity<ref name=Anderson2005/>

All [[physicians]] prescribing and patients receiving thalidomide must go through the STEPS process to ensure that no more children are born with birth defects traceable to the medication.  Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as [[lenalidomide]], that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects&nbsp;— except for greater [[myelosuppression]].<ref>{{cite journal
