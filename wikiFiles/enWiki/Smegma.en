'''Smegma''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''smēgma'', "soap"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smegma |title=Websters dictionary definition for smegma |accessdate=2008-08-26 |work= |publisher=Mirriam-Webster |date= }}</ref>) is a combination of [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliated]] (shed) [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]], [[transudate]]d skin oils, and moisture. It occurs in both [[female mammals|female]] and [[male mammal]]ian [[genitalia]].
==Human smegma==
Both sexes can produce smegma. In males, smegma is produced and can collect under the [[foreskin]]; in females, it collects around the [[clitoris]] and in the folds of the [[labia minora]]. 

===Females===
The accumulation of [[sebum]] combined with dead skin cells forms smegma.  Smegma clitoridis is defined as the secretion of the [[apocrine glands]] of the clitoris, in combination with [[Desquamation|desquamating]] epithelial cells.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Medilexicon  | title = Medical Dictionary | url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=82565}}</ref> Glands that are located around the clitoris and the vulva majoris secrete [[sebum]].  Contaminated, and retained smegma (smegmaliths) usually disappear when the cause is removed.<ref>C.F. McDonald, M.D. [http://www.noharmm.org/circumfemale.htm] "Circumcision of the Female"</ref>

===Males===

Smegma was originally thought to be produced by [[sebaceous gland]]s near the [[frenulum]] called [[Preputial gland|Tyson's glands]]; however, subsequent studies have failed to find these glands.<ref name = "Parkashsmegma">{{cite journal

According to Wright, little smegma is produced during childhood, although the foreskin may contain sebaceous glands. She also says that production of smegma increases from adolescence until sexual maturity when the function of smegma for lubrication assumes its full value, and from middle-age production starts to decline and in old age virtually no smegma is produced.<ref name = "Wright1970"/> Oster reported that the incidence of smegma increased from 1% among 6-7 and 8-9 year olds to 8% among 14-15 and 16-17 year olds (an overall incidence of 5%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oster J |title=Further fate of the foreskin.

==Other mammals==
In healthy animals, smegma helps clean and lubricate the genitals. In veterinary medicine, analysis of this smegma is sometimes used for detection of urogenital tract pathogens, such as ''[[Tritrichomonas foetus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=X.G. |authorlink= |coauthors=J.
