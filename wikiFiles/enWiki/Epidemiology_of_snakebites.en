Although Africa is home to four venomous snake families—[[Atractaspididae]], [[Colubridae]], [[Elapidae]], and [[Viperidae]]—approximately 60% of all bites are caused by vipers alone. In drier regions of the continent, such as [[sahel]]s and savannas, the [[Echis|saw-scaled vipers]] inflict up to 90% of all bites.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.456">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=456}}</ref> The [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]] is responsible for the most fatalities overall,<ref>{{Cite book |title=True Vipers: Natural History and Toxinology of Old World Vipers |last=Mallow |first=David |coauthors=David Ludwig, Goran Nilson |year=2004 |publisher=Krieger Publishing Company |location=Malabar, FL |isbn=0-89464-877-2}}</ref> although saw-scaled vipers inflict more bites in [[North Africa]]n countries, where the puff adder is typically not found.<ref name="Gutierrez2006">{{Cite journal |last=Gutiérrez |first=José María|coauthors=R.

Most bites occur in industrial [[plantations]], which attract many types of snake prey. Banana plantations are associated with vipers such as [[Causinae|night adder]]s, while [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber]] and palm tree plantations attract elapids, including [[Naja|cobras]] and [[Dendroaspis polylepis|black mamba]]s.<ref name="Chippaux 1998"/> Important cobra species include the [[Naja melanoleuca|forest cobra]] and the [[Naja nigricollis|black-necked spitting cobra]].<ref name="Valenta2010,p.20">{{harvnb|Valenta|2010|p=20}}</ref> In forested areas of [[Guinea]], cobras may inflict more than 30% of all venomous bites.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.459">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=459}}</ref> 

[[Dendroaspis|Mambas]], cobras, and some larger [[Bitis|puff adder]] species may claim territories of up to {{convert|1|to|2|sqkm|sqmi|sigfig=1}}, which are used by the snakes for hunting and reproduction. These snakes are large enough to defend their territory from intruders, including humans.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.456"/> The black mamba, in particular, is among the most venomous snakes in the world and one of the most aggressive. It is the longest snake on the continent and is able to move at {{convert|11|km/h|mph|sigfig=2}}, making it unusually dangerous.<ref name="Greene1997,p.40">{{harvnb|Greene|1997|p=40}}</ref> 

There are also venomous colubrids in Africa, although of these only two [[arboreal]] genera, the [[Dispholidus typus|boomslang]] and the [[Thelotornis|twig snakes]], are likely to inflict life-threatening bites. Of the Atractaspididae, ''[[Atractaspis]]'' is the species involved in the majority of bites. Since these snakes are [[nocturnal]] and [[fossorial]], living in burrows underground, bites remain rare, peaking at 1 to 3% in certain areas of the [[Sudanian savanna]]. However, there is no [[anti-venom]] or other effective therapy for ''Atractaspis'' envenomation, and the [[case fatality rate]] remains approximately 10%, with death typically occurring quickly.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.455">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=455}}</ref> 

Snakebites in Africa are most common in the [[sub-Saharan]] countries ([[scorpion sting]]s are more common in Northern Africa), and typically occur during the rainy season when snakes are more active.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.468">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=468}}</ref> Agricultural plantations and pastoral areas are involved in approximately 50 to  60% of reported snakebites,<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.459"/> while outdoor activities such as collecting firewood and water account for another 20% of bites.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.456"/> Approximately 1 million snakebites occur in sub-Saharan Africa each year,<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.454">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=454}}</ref> resulting in up to 500,000 envenomations, 25,000 deaths and another 25,000 permanent disabilities.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.465">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=465}}</ref> 

Because there is no reliable reporting system in place and because most victims never report their injury to health care facilities, these numbers are uncertain.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.454"/> One comprehensive study estimates that 91,000 to 420,000 snake envenomings occur in sub-Saharan Africa annually, resulting in anywhere from 4,000 to 30,000 deaths.<ref name="Kasturiratne"/> The same study estimates that 3,000 to 80,000 envenomations occur in North Africa, although far fewer people, less than 100, die each year.<ref name="Kasturiratne"/> The variability of these estimates is indicative of the difficulty in accurately assessing snakebite morbidity and mortality. 

In sub-Saharan Africa, over 50% of snakebite injuries are not appropriately treated.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.454"/> Between 40 and 80% of victims, depending on the country, exclusively rely on traditional medicine for treatment.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.454"/> Most victims who receive treatment by health care professionals have nevertheless delayed seeking medical attention for over 24 hours, and often up to 1 to 2 weeks.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.454"/> In many sub-Saharan countries, poor availability of expensive antivenom contributes to morbidity, and snakebites continue to remain a neglected health problem.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.454"/>

On the [[Indian subcontinent]], almost all snakebite deaths have traditionally been attributed to the [[Big Four (Indian snakes)|Big Four]], consisting of the [[Daboia|Russell's viper]], [[Naja naja|Indian cobra]], [[Echis carinatus|saw-scaled viper]], and the [[Bungarus caeruleus|common krait]].

[[Mexico]] is estimated to have at least 28,000 snake envenomings annually, although only a small number of these lead to death.<ref name="Kasturiratne"/> [[Central America]] is home to 23 species of pit vipers, and they inflict the vast majority of reported bites. Of these, ''[[Bothrops asper]]'' is the most important species, partly because it is abundant in lowland areas and partly because it is frequently found in agricultural and pastoral areas where humans work. Of the elapids, the [[yellow-bellied sea snake]] has, very rarely, caused venomous bites, while the [[coral snakes]], although common, inflict only 1 to 2% of all reported snake bites.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.491">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=491}}</ref> Of the coral snakes, ''[[Micrurus nigrocinctus]]'' is responsible for the most bites.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.492"/> 

Colubrid species found in Central America only cause mild to moderate envenomation in healthy adults, and most of these bites have occurred in humans handling the snakes.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.492">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=492}}</ref> [[Panama]] may have the greatest incidence of snakebites in Latin America, while [[El Salvador]] has the lowest (mostly because ''B. asper'' is not found in this country).<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.494">{{harvnb|Mackessy|2010|p=494}}</ref> The total number of snakebites in Central America is estimated to be 4,000 to 5,000, although as in other regions of the world, snakebites are probably underreported.<ref name="Mackessy2010,p.494"/>

In the [[Neotropics]], the [[Bothrops|lance-headed vipers]] inflict the majority of fatal bites, although of the many known species, only two, the [[Bothrops atrox|common lancehead]] and [[Bothrops asper|terciopelo]], are responsible for most fatalities.<ref name="Gutierrez2007"/><ref name="Gutierrez2006"/> The [[tropical rattlesnake]] is another important species.
