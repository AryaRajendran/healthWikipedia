'''Hantaviruses''' are negative sense [[RNA virus]]es in the [[Bunyaviridae]] family. Humans may be infected with hantaviruses through urine, saliva or contact with rodent waste products. Some hantaviruses cause potentially fatal diseases in humans, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), but others have not been associated with known human disease.<ref name="Martinez2005">{{Cite pmid|16485469|noedit}}</ref>

Human infections of hantaviruses have almost entirely been linked to human contact with rodent excrement, but recent human-to-human transmission has been reported with the [[Andes virus]] in South America.<ref name="Martinez2005" /> The name ''hantavirus'' is derived from the [[Hantan River]] area in [[South Korea]], which provided the founding member of the group: Hantaan virus (HTNV), isolated in the late 1970s by Ho-Wang Lee, Karl M.

== History ==
The hantaviruses are a relatively newly discovered genus of viruses. An outbreak of Korean Hemorrhagic Fever among American and Korean soldiers during the [[Korean War]](1951-1953) was later found to be caused by a hantavirus infection. More than 3000 troops became ill with symptoms that included renal failure, generalized hemorrhage, and shock. It had a 10% mortality rate. This outbreak sparked a 25-year search for the etiologic agent. Ho-Wang Lee, a South Korean virologist, Karl M. Johnson, an American tropical virologist, and his colleagues isolated Hantaan virus in 1976 from the lungs of striped field mice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/8/1843.full |title=Hantavirus infection—haemorrhagic fever in the Balkans—potential nephrological hazards in the Kosovo war |publisher=Ndt.oxfordjournals.org |date=2013-04-04 |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref><ref>Lee HW, Baek LJ, Johnson KM.

In late [[Medieval England]] a mysterious [[sweating sickness]] swept through the country in 1485 just before the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]]. Noting the similar symptoms which overlap with Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS, see [[#HPS|below]]), several scientists have theorised that the virus may have been the cause of the disease.<ref>{{Cite pmid|9023099|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The English sweating sickness, 1485-1551: a viral pulmonary disease? |author=M.

In 1993, an outbreak of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurred in the [[Four Corners]] region in the southwestern United States. The viral cause of the disease was found only weeks later and was called the [[Sin Nombre virus]] (SNV, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], "Virus sin nombre", for "nameless virus"). Its rodent host, the Deer mouse (''[[Peromyscus maniculatus]]''), was first identified by [[Terry Yates]], a professor at the [[University of New Mexico]].<ref name=bg>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Schudel |title=Terry Yates, 57; biologist found source of hantavirus |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2007/12/24/terry_yates_57_biologist_found_source_of_hantavirus/ |work= [[Washington Post]] |publisher=Boston Globe |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref>

== Two major clinical syndromes ==

=== Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ===
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by species of hantaviruses from the family Bunyaviridae. It is also known as Korean hemorrhagic fever, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, and nephropathis epidemica. The species that cause HFRS include Hantaan, Dobrava, Saaremaa, Seoul, and Puumala.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> It is found in Europe, Asia, and Africa. 

In hantavirus induced hemorrhagic fever, [[incubation time]] is between two to four weeks in humans before symptoms of infection present. Severity of symptoms depends on the [[viral load]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Yi J., Xu Z., Zhuang R., Wang J., Zhang Y., Ma Y., Liu B., Zhang Y., Zhang C., Yan G., Zhang F., Xu Z., Yang A. and Jin B.|year=2013|title=Hantaan Virus RNA Load in Patients Having Hemorrhagic Fever With Renal Syndrome: Correlation With Disease Severity|journal=Journal of Infectious Disease|volume=207|issue=9|pages=1457-1461|publisher=Oxford Journals|doi=10.1093/infdis/jis475|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/207/9/1457}}</ref> 

The course of the illness can be split into five phases:

* '''Febrile phase''': Symptoms include redness of cheeks and nose, [[fever]], chills, sweaty palms, diarrhea, [[malaise]], [[headache]]s, [[nausea]], [[abdominal pain|abdominal]] and [[back pain]], [[respiratory]] problems such as the ones common in the [[influenza]] [[virus]], as well as gastro-intestinal problems. These symptoms normally occur for three to seven days and arise about two to three weeks after exposure.

* '''Hypotensive phase''': This occurs when the blood platelet levels drop and symptoms can lead to [[tachycardia]] and [[hypoxemia]]. This phase can last for 2 days.

* '''Oliguric phase''': This phase lasts for three to seven days and is characterised by the onset of [[renal failure]] and [[proteinuria]].

* '''Diuretic phase''': This is characterized by [[Polyuria|diuresis]] of three to six litres per day, which can last for a couple of days up to weeks.

* '''Convalescent phase''': This is normally when recovery occurs and symptoms begin to improve.

This syndrome can also be fatal. In some cases, it has been known to cause permanent renal failure.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7784996 |title=[Acute kidney failure caused by Hantaviruses&#93;. [Ther Umsch. 1994&#93; - PubMed - NCBI |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref>

=== {{anchor|HPS}}Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome ===
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is found in the United States and Central and South America. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hps/ |title=CDC - Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) - Hantavirus |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2013-02-06 |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> It is an often fatal pulmonary disease. In the United States, the causative agent is Sin Nombre virus carried by deer mice. Prodromal symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and lethargy. It is characterized by a sudden onset of shortness of breath with rapidly evolving pulmonary edema that is often fatal despite mechanical ventilation and intervention with potent diuretics. It has a fatality rate of 60%. 

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was first recognized during the 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. It was identified by Dr. Bruce Tempest. It was originally called "[[Four Corners]] disease," but the name was changed to [[Sin Nombre virus]] after complaints by Native Americans that the name 'Four Corners' stigmatized the region. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1993/dec/deathatthecorner320#.UVDARxmzI7A |title=Death at the Corners |publisher=DiscoverMagazine.com |date=1993-12-01 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> It has since been identified throughout the United States. Rodent control in and around the home remains the primary prevention strategy.

== Epidemiology ==
Regions especially affected by hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome include [[China]], the [[Korean Peninsula]], [[Russia]] (Hantaan, Puumala and Seoul viruses), and northern and western [[Europe]] ([[Puumala virus|Puumala]] and Dobrava virus). Regions with the highest incidences of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome include Patagonia [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Panama]]. 

===Asia===

In [[China]], the [[Korean Peninsula]], and [[Russia]], hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is caused by Hantaan, Puumala and Seoul viruses. Korean Hemorrhagic Fever was first documented during the [[Korean War]] when American troops became ill. 

===South America===

The two agents of HPS in [[South America]] are [[Andes virus]] (also called Oran, Castelo de Sonhos, Lechiguanas, Juquitiba, Araraquara, and Bermejo viruses, among many other synonyms), which is the only hantavirus that has shown (albeit uncommonly) an interpersonal form of transmission, and [[Laguna Negra virus]], an extremely close relative of the previously-known Rio Mamore virus.

Rodents that have been shown to carry hantaviruses include ''[[Abrothrix longipilis]]'' and ''[[Oligoryzomys longicaudatus]]''.<ref name=Medina2009>{{cite doi|10.1128/JVI.01057-08|noedit}}</ref>

===North America===

In the U.S., minor cases of HPS include [[Sin Nombre virus]], [[New York virus]], [[Bayou virus]], and possibly [[Black Creek Canal virus]].

In the United States, as of July 2010 eight states had reported 30 or more cases of Hantavirus since 1993<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/epislides/episls.htm "Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) Cases, by State"], CDC Website, July 9, 2010, accessed November 9, 2010.</ref>&nbsp;– [[New Mexico]] ([[Sin Nombre virus|84]]), [[Colorado]] (70), [[Arizona]] (62), [[California]] (42), [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] (41), [[Texas]] (37), [[Utah]] (31) and [[Montana]] (30).  Other states reporting a significant number of cases include [[Idaho]] (16), [[Kansas]] (15), [[South Dakota]] (15), [[North Dakota]] (12) and [[Oregon]] (11). 

In late August and early September of 2012, eight new cases of Hantavirus were confirmed, including three deaths, in the [[Curry Village, California|Curry Village]] area of [[Yosemite National Park]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Yosemite extends hantavirus warning; death toll rises|url=http://news.yahoo.com/yosemite-extends-hantavirus-warning-death-toll-rises-020953730.html |newspaper=|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>

In addition to infecting rodents hantaviruses are known to be carried by shrews (order ''[[Soricomorpha]]'', family ''[[Soricidae]]'') and moles (family ''[[Talpidae]]'').<ref name=Kang2011>{{cite doi|10.1128/JVI.02450-10|noedit}}</ref>

In Mexico a number of rodents have been found to carry hantaviruses: ''[[Megadontomys thomasi]]'', ''[[Neotoma picta]]'', ''[[Peromyscus beatae]]'', ''[[Reithrodontomys megalotis]]'' and ''[[Reithrodontomys sumichrasti]]''.<ref>{{cite pmid|22138671|noedit}}</ref>

In Canada, one confirmed death in Northern B.C in Jan 2013.

===Europe===

In Europe three hantaviruses - Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses - are known to cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.<ref name=Vapalahti2003>{{cite pmid|14522264|noedit}}</ref> Puumala usually causes a generally mild disease - nephropathia epidemica - which typically presents with fever, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, impaired renal function and blurred vision. Dobrava infections while similar often also have haemorrhagic complications. There are few reports of confirmed Saaremaa infections but these appear to be similar to those caused by Puumala and less pathogenic than Dobrava. 

Puumala is carried by its rodent host, the bank vole (''[[Clethrionomys glareolus]]'') and is present through most of Europe excluding the Mediterranean region. Dobrava and Saaremaa carried respectively by the yellow necked mouse (''[[Apodemus flavicollis]]'') and the striped field mouse (''[[Apodemus agrarius]]'') are reported mainly in eastern and central Europe.

===Africa===

A hantavirus (Sangassou virus) has been isolated in Africa that causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. <ref name=Klempa2012>{{cite pmid|22278233|noedit}}</ref>

== Prevention and treatment ==
There is no known antiviral treatment, but natural recovery from the virus is possible with supportive treatment. Patients with suspected hantavirus are usually admitted to the hospital and given oxygen and mechanical ventilation support to help them breathe during the acute pulmonary stage.<ref name=CLA/> As the virus can be transmitted by rodent saliva, excretia, and bites, control of rats and mice in areas frequented by humans is key for disease prevention. General prevention can be accomplished by disposing of rodent nests, sealing any cracks and holes in homes where mice or rats could get in, setting up traps, laying down poisons or using natural predators such as cats in the home.<ref name=CLA/>

[[Leptospirosis]] causes similar symptoms and is also carried by rodent vectors, but it is due to a bacterial [[spirochete]] rather than a virus. Presumptive treatment of leptospirosis with [[penicillin]] (and other) antibiotics is often started for severe symptoms when a diagnostic dilemma between the two diseases is encountered.

== Virology ==

=== Classification ===
Hantaviruses are Bunyaviruses. The ''Bunyaviridae'' family is divided into five genera: ''[[Orthobunyavirus]]'', ''[[Nairovirus]]'', ''[[Phlebovirus]]'', ''[[Tospovirus]]'', and ''Hantavirus''. Like all members of this family, hantaviruses have [[genomes]] comprising three [[negative-sense]], single-stranded RNA segments, and so are classified as negative sense [[RNA virus]]es. Members of other ''Bunyaviridae'' family genera are generally [[arthropod]]-borne viruses,<ref name="doi10.1099/0022-1317-77-11-2677">{{Cite doi|10.1099/0022-1317-77-11-2677|noedit}}</ref> but hantaviruses are thought to be transmitted to humans mainly through inhalation of aerosolized [[rodent]] excreta or rodent bites.

=== Genome ===
Like other members of the bunyavirus family, hantaviruses are enveloped viruses with a genome that consists of three single-stranded, negative sense RNA segments designated S (small), M (medium), and L (large). The S RNA encodes the [[nucleocapsid]] (N) protein. The M RNA encodes a [[polyprotein]] that is cotranslationally cleaved to yield the envelope [[glycoprotein]]s Gn (formerly G1) and Gc (formerly G2).<ref name="doi10.1099/0022-1317-77-11-2677"/><ref name="doi10.1128/CMR.00062-09">{{Cite doi|10.1128/CMR.00062-09|noedit}}</ref>  

The L RNA encodes the L protein, which functions as the viral transcriptase/replicase. Within [[virion]]s, the genomic RNAs of hantaviruses are thought to complex with the N protein to form helical nucleocapsids, the RNA component of which circularizes due to sequence complementarity between the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of genomic segments.

As with other Bunyaviridae, each of the three segments has a consensus 3'-terminal [[nucleotide]] sequence (AUCAUCAUC), which is complementary to the 5' terminal sequence and is distinct from those of the other four genera in the family.<ref>{{cite pmid|2179464|noedit}}</ref> These sequences appear to form panhandle structures which seem likely to play a role in replication and encapsidation facilitated by binding with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein.<ref>{{cite pmid|15650206|noedit}}</ref> The large segment is 6530-6550 nucleotides (nt) in length, the medium is 3613-3707 nt in length and the small is 1696-2083 nt in length. 

No nonstructural proteins are known unlike the other genera in this family. At the 5' and 3' of each segment are short noncoding sequences: the noncoding segment in all sequences at the 5' end is 37-51 nt. The 3' noncoding regions differ: L segment 38-43 nt; M segment 168-229 nt; and S segment 370-730 nt. The 3'end of the S segment is conserved between the genera suggesting a functional role.

===Virions===
Hantavirus virions are about 100 [[nanometre]]s (nm) in diameter. The lipid bilayer of the [[viral envelope]] is about five nm thick and is embedded with viral surface proteins to which sugar residues are attached. These glycoproteins, known as G1 and G2, are encoded by the M segment of the viral genome. They tend to associate ([[Dimer (chemistry)|heterodimerize]]) with each other and have both an interior tail and an exterior domain that extends to about six nm beyond the envelope surface. 

Inside the envelope are the nucleocapsids. These are composed of many copies of the nucleocapsid protein N, which interact with the three segments of the viral genome to form helical structures. The virally encoded [[RNA polymerase]] is also found in the interior. By mass, the virion is greater than 50% protein, 20-30% lipid and 2-7% carbohydrate. The density of the virions is 1.18&nbsp;gram per cubic centimeter. These features are common to all members of the Bunyaviridae.

===Life cycle===
Entry into host cells is thought to occur by attachment of virions to cellular receptors and subsequent [[endocytosis]]. Nucleocapsids are introduced into the cytoplasm by pH-dependent fusion of the virion with the [[endosomal membrane]]. Subsequent to release of the nucleocapsids into cytoplasm, the complexes are targeted to the ER-Golgi Intermediate compartments (ERGIC) through microtubular associated movement resulting in the formation of viral factories at ERGIC. 

These factories then facilitate transcription and subsequent translation of the viral proteins. Transcription of viral genes must be initiated by association of the L protein with the three nucleocapsid species. In addition to transcriptase and replicase functions, the viral L protein is also thought to have an endonuclease activity that cleaves cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for the production of capped primers used to initiate transcription of viral mRNAs. As a result of this "cap snatching," the mRNAs of hantaviruses are capped and contain nontemplated 5' terminal extensions. 

The G1 (aka Gn) and G2 (Gc) glycoproteins form [[hetero-oligomers]] and are then transported from the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi complex]], where [[glycosylation]] is completed. The L protein produces nascent genomes by replication via a positive-sense RNA intermediate. Hantavirus virions are believed to assemble by association of nucleocapsids with glycoproteins embedded in the membranes of the Golgi, followed by budding into the [[Golgi cisternae]]. Nascent virions are then transported in secretory [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] to the [[plasma membrane]] and released by [[exocytosis]].

[[Image:Sigmodon hispidus1.jpg|thumb|250px|The cotton rat, ''[[Sigmodon hispidus]]'', is a hantavirus carrier that becomes a threat when it enters human habitation in rural and suburban areas.]]

=== Pathogenesis ===
The pathogenesis of Hantavirus infections is unclear as there is a lack of animal models to describe it (rats and mice do not seem to acquire severe disease). While the primary site of viral replication in the body is not known, in HFRS the main effect is in the blood vessels while in HPS most symptoms are associated with the lungs. In HFRS, there are increased vascular permeability and decreased blood pressure due to endothelial dysfunction and the most dramatic damage is seen in the kidneys, whereas in HPS, the lungs, spleen, and gall bladder are most affected. Early symptoms of HPS tend to present similarly to the flu (muscle aches, fever and fatigue) and usually show up around 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Later stages of the disease (about 4 to 10 days after symptoms start) will include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and coughing.<ref name=CLA>{{cite web

== Weaponization ==
The species that cause hantavirus hemorrhagic fever have not been shown to transfer from person to person. Transmission by aerosolized rodent excreta still remains the only known way the virus is transmitted to humans. Similar negative-stranded RNA viruses such as Marburg and Ebola hemorrhagic fevers, can be transmitted by contact with infected blood and body fluids, and are known to spread to patient-care workers in African hospitals. But those viruses do not transfer readily in the modern hospital setting with universal precautions. In general, drop-let and/or fomite transfer has not been shown in the hantaviruses in either the hemorrhagic or pulmonary forms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=C.J.|year=2006|title=Emerging Infections: Lessons from the Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers|journal=Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association|volume=117|issue=|pages=189-197|publisher=Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1500910/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ebola and Marburg Virus Genomic Structure, Comparative and Molecular Biology|url=http://www.mcb.uct.ac.za/ebola/ebolagen.html|last1=Crowley|first1=J.|last2=Crusberg|first2=T.|publisher=Dept. of Biology & Biotechnology, Worcester Polytechnic Institute}}</ref>

== Evolution ==
Findings of significant congruence between phylogenies of hantaviruses and phylogenies of their rodent reservoirs have led to the theory that rodents, although infected by the virus are not harmed by it because of long-standing hantavirus-rodent host coevolution.<ref name="doi10.1099/0022-1317-77-11-2677"/><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1093/molbev/msg232|noedit}}</ref>  However, recent findings have led to scientific debate and new hypotheses regarding hantavirus evolution.<ref name="doi10.1128/CMR.00062-09"/><ref name="doi10.1093/molbev/msn234">{{Cite doi|10.1093/molbev/msn234|noedit}}</ref>   

Various hantaviruses have been found to infect multiple rodent species, and cases of cross-species transmission (host switching) have been recorded.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.3201/eid1409.080455}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1099/Vir.0.006155-0|noedit}}</ref><ref name="doi10.1128/Jvi.01226-09">{{Cite doi|10.1128/Jvi.01226-09|noedit}}</ref>  Additionally, rates of substitution based on nucleotide sequence data reveal that hantavirus clades and rodent subfamilies may not have diverged at the same time.<ref name="doi10.1093/molbev/msn234"/><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1093/molbev/msn093|noedit}}</ref>  Furthermore, hantaviruses have been found in multiple species of shrews and moles.<ref name="doi10.1093/molbev/msn234"/><ref name="doi10.1128/Jvi.02450-10">{{Cite doi|10.1128/Jvi.02450-10|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|18214168|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|18217572|noedit}}</ref>

Taking into account the inconsistencies in the theory of coevolution, Ramsden et al. (2009) have proposed that the patterns seen in hantaviruses in relation to their reservoirs could be attributed to preferential host switching directed by geographical proximity and adaptation to specific host types.<ref name="doi10.1093/molbev/msn234"/> Ulrich et al. (2010) have proposed that the observed geographical clustering of hantavirus sequences may have been caused by an isolation-by-distance mechanism.<ref name="doi10.1128/Jvi.01226-09"/> Upon comparison of the hantaviruses found in hosts of orders Rodentia and Soricomorpha, Yanagihara et al. (2011) have proposed that the evolutionary history of the hantavirus consists of a complex mix of both host switching and codivergence and suggest that ancestral shrews or moles rather than rodents may have been the early original hosts of ancient hantaviruses.<ref name="doi10.1128/Jvi.02450-10"/>

== Vaccine Research ==
The Korean Army is one of the largest consumers of the hantavirus vaccine, second only to public health centers.  There are more than 20 recognized hantaviruses, some of which are associated with one of two serious human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).  Efforts are continuing to develop safe and effective hantavirus vaccines. Several classical and molecular vaccine approaches are in pre-clinical stages of development. The development of hantavirus vaccines is hampered by the lack of adequate animal models of hantavirus-associated disease. No specific antiviral therapy is yet available. No hantavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the US, and no WHO-approved vaccine has gained widespread acceptance.<ref>{{cite doi|10.3201/eid1012.040684|noedit}}</ref>
