'''Mechanography''' (also referred to as ''jumping mechanography'') is a medical diagnostic measurement method for [[motion analysis]] by means of physical parameters. The variation of the ground reaction forces over the time of a motion like typical every day movements (e.g. chair rise or jumps) are measured and [[centre of gravity]] related physical parameters like relative maximum forces, velocity, power output, kinetic energy, potential energy, height of jump or whole body stiffness<ref>Farley CT, Houdijk HH, Van Strien C, Louie M: ''Mechanism of leg stiffness adjustment for hopping on surfaces of different stiffnesses'', Mechanism of leg stiffness adjustment for hopping on surfaces of different stiffnesses, PMID 9729582</ref> are calculated. If the ground reaction forces are measured separately for left and right leg in addition body imbalances during the motions can be analysed. This enables for example to document the results of therapy.<ref name="Fricke1">Fricke O, Witzel C, Schickendantz S, Sreeram N, Brockmeier K, Schoenau E: ''Mechanographic characteristics of adolescents and young adults with congenital heart disease'', Eur J Pediatr. 2007 May 22, PMID 17516086</ref> The same methodology can also be used for [[gait analysis]]<ref name="Veilleux11">Veilleux LN, Robert M, Ballaz L, Lemay M, Rauch F: ''Gait analysis using a force-measuring gangway: Intrasession repeatability in healthy adults'', J Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact., 11(1):27-33, 2011; PMID 21364272</ref><ref name="Veilleux12">Veilleux LN, Cheung M, Ben Amor M, Rauch F: ''Abnormalities in Muscle Density and Muscle Function in Hypophosphatemic Rickets.'', J Clin Endocrinol Metab, ():, 2012; PMID 22639288</ref> or for analysis of stair climbing.

Typical fields of applications of Mechanography are in the field of [[geriatrics]]<ref name="Runge04">Runge M, Rittweger J, Russo CR, Schiessl H, Felsenberg D: ''Is muscle power output a key factor in the age-related decline in physical performance?

Based on this test (maximum relative power output of a jump as high as possible)  Runge et al. and Schönau et al. defined reference values of a fit population in order to match the individual power output in relation to bodyweight, age and gender<ref name="Runge04"/><ref name="Fricke06a"/> Tsubaki<ref name="Tsubaki09">Tsubaki A, Kubo M, Kobayashi R, Jigami H, Takahashi HE: ''Normative values for maximum power during motor function assessment of jumping among physically active Japanese'', J Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact., 9(4):263-7, 2009; PMID 19949284</ref><ref name="Tsubaki10">Tsubaki A, Kubo M, Kobayashi R, Jigami H, Takahashi HE: ''Age-Related Changes in Physical Function in Community-Dwelling People Aged 50-79 Years'', J.

Runge et al. also showed the interrelation between the measured individual power output and the [[neuromuscular]] caused fall risk.<ref>Runge M, Hunter G: ''Determinants of musculoskeletal frailty and the risk of falls in old age'', J Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact. 2006 Apr-Jun;6(2):167-73, PMID 16849828</ref>

Due to this objective and highly reproducible quantification of typical every day movements by means of physical parameters the Mechanography is well suited to document the physical state of a person<ref name="Runge04"/><ref name="Ward08">Ward KA, Das G, Berry JL, Roberts SA, Rawer R, Adams JE, Mughal Z: ''Vitamin D status and muscle function in post-menarchal adolescent girls'', J Clin Endocrinol Metab., :, 2008; PMID 19033372</ref><ref name="Yanovich08">Yanovich R, Evans R, Israeli E, Constantini N, Sharvit N, Merkel D, Epstein Y, Moran DS: ''Differences in physical fitness of male and female recruits in gender-integrated army basic training'', Med Sci Sports Exerc., 40(11 Suppl):S654-9, 2008; PMID 18849869</ref> as well as the effects of training or therapy.<ref name="Fricke1"/><ref name="Buehring08"/><ref name="Rauch12"/><ref name="Rittweger07">Rittweger J, Felsenberg D, Maganaris C, Ferretti JL: ''Vertical jump performance after 90 days bed rest with and without flywheel resistive exercise, including a 180 days follow-up'', Eur J Appl Physiol., 100(4):427-36, 2007; {{DOI|10.1007/s00421-007-0443-6}} PMID 17406887</ref><ref name="Rittweger09a">Rittweger J, di Prampero PE, Maffulli N, Narici MV: ''Sprint and endurance power and ageing: an analysis of master athletic world records'', Proc Biol Sci., 276(1657):683-9, 2009; PMID 18957366</ref><ref name="Item11">Item F, Denkinger J, Fontana P, Weber M, Boutellier U, Toigo M: ''Combined Effects of Whole-Body Vibration, Resistance Exercise, and Vascular Occlusion on Skeletal Muscle and Performance.'', Int J Sports Med, 32(10):781-7, 2011; PMID 21870317</ref> Because of this it is also one of the standard measurements in recent and current Bed Rest Studies of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).<ref name="Rittweger07"/><ref name="Buehring11">Buehring B, Belavy DL, Michaelis I, Gast U, Felsenberg D, Rittweger J: ''Changes in lower extremity muscle function after 56 days of bed rest.'', J Appl Physiol, 111(1):87-94, 2011; PMID 21527664</ref>

Mechanography has also been used to explore the relation between muscle and bone. According to the [[Mechanostat]] theorem muscle function influences bone growth. By combining functional measurement methods like Mechanography and [[Peripheral quantitative computed tomography|quantitative computer tomographic]] measurements analysing bone density, geometry and strength this relationship can be assessed.<ref name="Binkley08"/><ref name="Anliker12">Anliker E, Dick C, Rawer R, Toigo M: ''Effects of jumping exercise on maximum ground reaction force and bone in 8- to 12-year-old boys and girls: a 9-month randomized controlled trial.'', J Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact, 12(2):56-67, 2012; PMID 22647278</ref><ref name="Anliker12">Anliker E, Toigo M: ''Functional assessment of the muscle-bone unit in the lower leg.'', J Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact, 12(2):46-55, 2012; PMID 22647277</ref><ref name="Anliker11">Anliker E, Rawer R, Boutellier U, Toigo M: ''Maximum Ground Reaction Force in Relation to Tibial Bone Mass in Children and Adults.'', Med Sci Sports Exerc, (43):2102-9, 2011; PMID 21502901</ref>
