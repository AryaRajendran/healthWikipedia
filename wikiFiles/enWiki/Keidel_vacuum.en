The '''Keidel [[vacuum]] tube''' was a type of [[blood]] collecting device, first manufactured by Hynson, Wescott and Dunning in around 1922.<ref name="Handbook of Phlebotomy">Pendergraph, Garland E.

ISBN 0-683-30556-5</ref> This vacuum was one of the first evacuated systems, predating the more well known [[Vacutainer]].<ref name="Handbook of Phlebotomy"/> Its primary use was to test for [[syphilis]] and [[typhoid fever]].<ref name="Medical Diagnosis">Greene, Charles Lyman (1917) ''Medical Diagnosis for the Student and Practitioner''.

==How it worked==
Essentially, the Keidel vacuum consists of a sealed [[ampule]] with or without a [[culture medium]].  Connected to the ampule was a short rubber tube with a needle at the end, using a small glass tube as a cap.  The insertion of the needle into the [[vein]] crushes the ampule, thus creating a vacuum and forcing blood into the container.  Typically, a prominent vein in the forearm such as the [[median cubital vein]] would suffice, although the Keidel vacuum can take blood for any prominent peripheral vein.  This concept did not become popular until during [[World War II]], when quick and efficient first aid care was necessary in the battle field.  As a result, the vacutainer became the forefront device used for blood collection.<ref name="Handbook of Phlebotomy"/>
