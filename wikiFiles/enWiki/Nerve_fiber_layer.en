The [[retina]]l '''nerve fiber layer''' ('''nerve fiber layer''', '''stratum opticum''', '''RNFL''') is formed by the expansion of the fibers of the [[optic nerve]]; it is thickest near the [[porus opticus]], gradually diminishing toward the [[ora serrata]]. 

As the nerve fibers pass through the [[lamina cribrosa]] sclerae they lose their [[medullary sheath]]s and are continued onward through the [[choroid]] and [[retina]] as simple axis-cylinders. 

When they reach the internal surface of the retina they radiate from their point of entrance over this surface grouped in bundles, and in many places arranged in [[plexuses]].  

Most of the fibers are centripetal, and are the direct continuations of the axis-cylinder processes of the cells of the [[ganglionic layer]], but a few of them are [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] and ramify in the [[inner plexiform]] and [[inner nuclear layer]]s, where they end in enlarged extremities.

Patients with [[retinitis pigmentosa]] have abnormal thinning of the RNFL which correlates with the severity of the disease.<ref>Walia S, Fishman GA, Edward DP, Lindeman M. Retinal nerve fiber layer defects in RP patients. ''Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.'' 2007 Oct;48(10):4748-52. PMID 17898300</ref> However the thickness of the RNFL also decreases with age and not visual acuity.<ref>Oishi A, Otani A, Sasahara M, Kurimoto M, Nakamura H, Kojima H, Yoshimura N. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. ''Eye.'' 2008 Mar 14, online advance publication. PMID 18344951</ref> The sparing of this layer is important in the treatment of the disease as it is the basis for connecting retinal prostheses to the optic nerve, or implanting stem cells that could regenerate the lost photoreceptors.

RNFL is a sensitive structure. Some process can excites its natural apoptosis. Harmful situation can make some damage on RNFL such as high intraocular pressure, high fluctuation on phase of intraocular pressure, inflammation, vascular disease and any kind of hypoxia. Gede Pardianto (2009) reported 6 cases of RNFL thickness change after the procedures of phacoemulsification.<ref>Pardianto G, Mastering phacoemulsification in Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2009;10:26.</ref>
