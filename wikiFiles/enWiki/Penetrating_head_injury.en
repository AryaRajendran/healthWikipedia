A '''penetrating head injury''', or '''open head injury''', is a [[head injury]] in which the [[dura mater]], the outer layer of the [[meninges]], is breached.<ref name="uv">University of Vermont College of Medicine. [http://web.archive.org/web/20030821142023/http://cats.med.uvm.edu/cats_teachingmod/pathology/path302/np/home/neuroindex.html "Neuropathology: Trauma to the CNS."] Accessed through web archive on August 8, 2007. </ref>   Penetrating injury can be caused by high-[[velocity]] [[projectiles]] or objects of lower velocity such as knives, or bone fragments from a [[skull fracture]] that are driven into the brain.  A '''perforating head injury''' is one in which the object passes through the head and leaves an exit wound.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis">Vinas FC and Pilitsis J. 2006.

==Mechanisms==

In penetrating injury from high-velocity missiles, injuries may occur not only from initial [[laceration]] and crushing of brain tissue by the [[projectile]] but also from the subsequent [[cavitation]].   High-velocity objects create rotations and can create a [[shock wave]] that cause stretch injuries, forming a cavity that is three to four times greater in [[diameter]] than the missile itself.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/> A pulsating temporary cavity is also formed by a high-speed missile and can have a diameter thirty times greater than that of the missile.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/> Though this cavity is reduced in size once the force is over, the tissue that was compressed during cavitation remains injured.  Destroyed brain tissue may either be ejected from [[entrance wound|entrance]] or [[exit wound]]s or packed up against the sides of the cavity formed by the missile.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/>

Low-velocity objects usually cause penetrating injuries in the regions of the [[Human skull|skull]]'s [[temporal bone]]s or [[orbital bone|orbital surface]]s, where the bones are thinner and thus more likely to break.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/>  Damage from lower-velocity penetrating injuries is restricted to the tract of the stab wound, because the lower-velocity object does not create as much cavitation.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/>  However, low-velocity penetrating objects such as slow bullets may ricochet inside the skull, continuing to cause damage until they stop moving.<ref name="biausa">Brain Injury Association of America (BIAUSA).

==Pathophysiology==
Though it is more likely to cause [[infection]], penetrating trauma is similar to [[closed head injury]] such as [[brain contusion|cerebral contusion]] or [[intracranial hemorrhage]] in a number of ways.  As in closed head injury, [[intracranial pressure]] is likely to increase due to [[cerebral edema|swelling]] or bleeding, potentially crushing delicate brain tissue.  Most deaths from penetrating trauma are caused by damage to [[blood vessel]]s, which can lead to [[intracranial hematoma]]s and [[ischemia]], which can in turn lead to a [[biochemical cascade]] called the [[ischemic cascade]]. The injury in penetrating brain trauma is mostly [[focal brain injury|focal]] (that is, it affects a specific area of tissue).<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/>

Studies with [[PET scan]]ning and [[transcranial Doppler imaging]] have shown that changes in [[cerebral blood flow]], such as [[hypoperfusion]] and [[vasospasm]], can follow penetrating head injury.<ref name="Blissitt06"/> These changes can last for two weeks.<ref name="Blissitt06"/>  An [[ischemic cascade]] similar to the course of cellular and metabolic events that follow other head injuries may follow penetrating head injuries.<ref name="Blissitt06"/> Sometimes in penetrating injuries, the brain releases [[thromboplastin]], which can lead to problems with blood [[clot]]ting.<ref name="Orlando Regional">Orlando Regional Healthcare, Education and Development. 2004. [http://www.orlandoregional.org/pdf%20folder/overview%20adult%20brain%20injury.pdf "Overview of Adult Traumatic Brain Injuries."] Retrieved on January 16, 2008.</ref> 

While blunt head trauma does not present a risk of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] due to hemorrhage, penetrating head trauma does.<ref name="Blissitt06">

==Diagnosis and treatment==

A person with a penetrating head injury may be evaluated using [[X-ray]], [[CT scan]], or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] (however MRI can only be used when the penetrating object would not be magnetic, because MRI uses magnetism and could move the object, causing further injury).<ref name="Blissitt06"/>

[[Surgery]] may be required to [[debridement|debride]] or repair the injury or to relieve excessive [[intracranial pressure]].<ref name="Blissitt06"/>  Intracranial pressure is monitored and attempts are made to maintain it within normal ranges.<ref name="Blissitt06"/> Intravenous fluids are given and efforts are taken to maintain high [[blood oxygen]] levels.<ref name="Blissitt06"/>

==Prognosis==	
The highest-velocity injuries tend to have the worst associated damage.<ref name="Dawodu ">Dawodu S. 2007. [http://www.emedicine.com/pmr/topic212.htm "Traumatic Brain Injury: Definition, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology"] Emedicine.com.  Retrieved on February 6, 2007.</ref>   Penetrating injury from any missile such as a bullet has a mortality rate of 92%.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/> Thus, [[firearm]]s cause the most head injury-related deaths.<ref name="biausa"/>
Perforating injuries have an even worse prognosis.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/>

Penetrating head trauma can cause impairment or loss of abilities controlled by parts of the brain that are [[Brain damage|damaged]].  A famous example is [[Phineas Gage]], whose personality appears to have changed (though not as dramatically as usually described) after a penetrating injury to his [[frontal lobe]](s).

People with [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], a [[blown pupil]], [[respiratory distress]], [[hypotension]], or [[cerebral vasospasm]] are more likely to have worse outcomes.<ref name="Blissitt06"/> 

People with penetrating head trauma may have complications such as [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], and [[neurogenic]] [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name="Blissitt06"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Leary|first=R.|coauthors=McKinlay, J.|title=Neurogenic pulmonary oedema|journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia, Critical Care & Pain|volume=11|issue=3|pages=87–92|doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkr006|year=2011}}</ref>   Up to 50% of patients with penetrating brain injuries get late-onset [[post-traumatic epilepsy]].<ref name="Shepherd">Shepherd S. 2004.
