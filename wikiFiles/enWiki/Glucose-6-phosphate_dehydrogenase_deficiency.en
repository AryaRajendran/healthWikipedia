'''Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency''' is an [[X-linked recessive]] [[hereditary disease]] characterised by abnormally low levels of [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (abbreviated '''G6PD''' or '''G6PDH'''), a metabolic enzyme involved in the [[pentose phosphate pathway]], especially important in [[red blood cell]] metabolism. G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect.<ref name=Frank/> Individuals with the disease may exhibit nonimmune [[hemolytic anemia]] in response to a number of causes, most commonly [[infection]] or exposure to certain medications or chemicals.  G6PD deficiency is closely linked to '''favism''', a disorder characterized by a hemolytic reaction to consumption of [[Vicia faba|broad bean]]s, with a name derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] name of the broad bean (''fava'').  The name favism is sometimes used to refer to the enzyme deficiency as a whole, although this is misleading as not all people with G6PD deficiency will manifest a physically observable reaction to consumption of broad beans.

==Classification==
The [[World Health Organization]] classifies G6PD genetic variants into five classes, the first three of which are deficiency states.<ref>{{cite journal|last=WHO Working Group|title=Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|year=1989|volume=67|issue=6|pages=601-11|pmid=2633878}}</ref> 

# Severe deficiency (<10% activity) with chronic (nonspherocytic) hemolytic anemia
# Severe deficiency (<10% activity), with intermittent hemolysis
# Mild deficiency (10-60% activity), hemolysis with stressors only
# Non-deficient variant, no clinical sequelae
# Increased enzyme activity, no clinical

== Signs and symptoms ==

Most individuals with G6PD deficiency are [[asymptomatic]]. 

Symptomatic patients are almost exclusively male, due to the [[X-linked]] pattern of inheritance, but female carriers can be clinically affected due to unfavorable [[lyonization]], where random inactivation of an X-chromosome in certain cells creates a population of G6PD-deficient [[red blood cell]]s coexisting with normal red cells. A typical female with one affected X chromosome will show the deficiency in approximately half of her red blood cells.  However, in rare cases, including double X deficiency, the ratio can be much more than half, making the individual almost as sensitive as a male.

Abnormal red blood cell breakdown ([[hemolysis]]) in G6PD deficiency can manifest in a number of ways, including the following:
* Prolonged [[neonatal jaundice]], possibly leading to [[kernicterus]] (arguably the most serious complication of G6PD deficiency)
* [[Hemolysis|Hemolytic crises]] in response to:
** Illness (especially infections)
** Certain [[medication|drugs]] (see below)
** Certain foods, most notably [[broad bean]]s
** Certain chemicals
** [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]]
* Very severe crises can cause [[acute renal failure]] after 40 days of ingestion causing a hemolytic crisis symptoms of which can include dark urine, an enlarged spleen, fatigue, paleness, [[asthma | shortness of breath]], [[hypertension | rapid heart rate]], and jaundice. Severe hemolytic crisis can produce [[hemoglobinuria]]. Laboratory tests may reveal an elevated absolute reticulocyte count, elevated [[bilirubin]] levels, elevated serum LDH, low red blood cell count, and low [[hemoglobin]] levels. Spontaneous recovery from hemolytic crises is the usual outcome, although kidney failure or death may occur following a severe hemolytic event.<ref>http://genetics.emory.edu/egl/tests/view.php?testid=125</ref>


'''Favism''' may be formally defined as a haemolytic response to the consumption of broad beans.  All individuals with favism show G6PD deficiency.  However, not all individuals with G6PD deficiency show favism.  For example, in a small study of 757 Saudi men, more than 42% showed a variant of G6PD deficiency, but none displayed symptoms of favism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Al-Ali |first=AK |year=1996 |title=Common G6PD variant from Saudi population and its prevalence |journal=[[Annals of Saudi Medicine]] |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=654–6 |issn=02564947 |pmid=17429252 |url=http://www.kfshrc.edu.sa/annals/Old/166/95-371.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=May 17, 2009 |quote=This has led to the identification of one genetically determined common variant, 'G6PD

Mediterranean.' The overall prevalence rate of this deficiency in these areas was determined to be in excess of

42%. None of the subjects studied displayed any sign of favism}}</ref>  Favism is known to be more prevalent in infants and children, and G6PD genetic variant can influence chemical sensitivity.<ref>Luzzatto, L. "GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY." Advanced Medicine-Twelve: Proceedings of a Conference Held at the Royal College of Physicians of London, 11-14 February 1985. Vol. 21. Churchill Livingstone, 1986.</ref>  Other than this, the specifics of the chemical relationship between favism and G6PD are not well understood.

==Cause==

===Environmental triggers===
Many substances are potentially harmful to people with G6PD deficiency. Variation in response to these substances makes individual predictions difficult. [[Antimalarial drug]]s that can cause acute haemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include [[primaquine]], [[pamaquine]], and [[chloroquine]]. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|Sulfonamides]] (such as [[sulfanilamide]], [[sulfamethoxazole]], and [[mafenide]]), thiazolesulfone, [[methylene blue]], and [[naphthalene]] should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency, as should certain [[analgesic]]s (such as [[aspirin]], [[phenazopyridine]], and [[acetanilide]]) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics ([[nalidixic acid]], [[nitrofurantoin]], [[isoniazid]], [[dapsone]], and [[furazolidone]]).<ref name=Frank>{{cite journal |author=Frank JE |title=Diagnosis and management of G6PD deficiency |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=72 |issue=7 |pages=1277–82 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16225031 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20051001/1277.html}}</ref><ref name="OHM">{{cite book | last=Warrell | first=David A. | coauthors=Timothy M.

=== Genetics ===

The two variants (G6PD A− and G6PD Mediterranean) are the most commonly inherited variants.  G6PD A− has an occurrence of 10% of American blacks while G6PD Mediterranean is prevalent in the Middle East.  These variants are believed to stem from a protective effect against ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' malaria.<ref>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; Aster, Jon (2009-05-28).

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Pathology of G6PD deficiency.png|right|none|500px|]]
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an [[enzyme]] in the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] (see image, also known as the HMP shunt pathway).  G6PD converts [[glucose-6-phosphate]] into [[6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone]] and is the rate-limiting enzyme of this [[metabolic pathway]] that supplies [[redox|reducing]] energy to cells  by maintaining the level of the [[co-enzyme]] [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADPH). The NADPH in turn maintains the supply of reduced [[glutathione]] in the cells that is used to mop up free radicals that cause [[oxidation|oxidative]] damage.

The G6PD / NADPH pathway is the ''only'' source of reduced glutathione in red blood cells ([[erythrocyte]]s).  The role of red cells as oxygen carriers puts them at substantial risk of damage from oxidizing free radicals except for the protective effect of G6PD/NADPH/glutathione.

People with G6PD deficiency are therefore at risk of [[hemolytic anemia]] in states of [[oxidative stress]]. Oxidative stress can result from  infection and from chemical exposure to [[medication]] and certain foods. [[Broad bean]]s, e.g., fava beans, contain high levels of [[vicine]], [[divicine]], convicine and isouramil, all of which are [[oxidant]]s.

When all remaining reduced [[glutathione]] is consumed, enzymes and other proteins (including [[hemoglobin]]) are subsequently damaged by the oxidants, leading to [[electrolyte]] imbalance, cross-bonding and protein deposition in the red [[cell membranes]].  Damaged red cells are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] and sequestered (taken out of circulation) in the [[spleen]]. The hemoglobin is metabolized to [[bilirubin]] (causing [[jaundice]] at high concentrations).  The red cells rarely disintegrate in the circulation, so hemoglobin is rarely excreted directly by the [[kidney]], but this can occur in severe cases, causing [[acute renal failure]] .

Deficiency of G6PD in the alternative pathway causes the build up of glucose and thus there is an increase of [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s (AGE). The deficiency also reduces the amount of NADPH, which is required for the formation of nitric oxide (NO). The high prevalence of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]] and [[hypertension]] in Afro-Caribbeans in the West could be directly related to the incidence of G6PD deficiency in those populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaskin RS, Estwick D, Peddi R |title=G6PD deficiency: its role in the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus |journal=Ethnicity & disease |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=749–54 |year=2001 |pmid=11763298 |doi=}}</ref>

Although female carriers can have a mild form of G6PD deficiency (dependent on the degree of inactivation of the unaffected X chromosome – see ''[[lyonization]]''), homozygous females have been described; in these females there is co-incidence of a [[rare disease|rare]] [[immunology|immune disorder]] termed [[chronic granulomatous disease]] (CGD).

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is generally suspected when patients from certain ethnic groups (see epidemiology) develop [[anemia]], [[jaundice]] and symptoms of [[hemolysis]] after challenges from any of the above causes, especially when there is a positive family history.

Generally, tests will include:
* [[Complete blood count]] and [[reticulocyte]] count; in active G6PD deficiency, [[Heinz body|Heinz bodies]] can be seen in [[red blood cell]]s on a [[blood film]];
* [[Liver enzyme]]s (to exclude other causes of [[jaundice]]);
* [[Lactate dehydrogenase]] (elevated in hemolysis and a marker of hemolytic severity)
* [[Haptoglobin]] (decreased in hemolysis);
* A "[[Coombs test|direct antiglobulin test]]" (Coombs' test) – this should be negative, as [[hemolysis]] in G6PD is not immune-mediated;

When there are sufficient grounds to suspect G6PD, a direct test for G6PD is the "[[Beutler fluorescent spot test]]", which has largely replaced an older test (the Motulsky dye-decolouration test). Other possibilities are direct DNA testing and/or sequencing of the G6PD gene.

The ''Beutler fluorescent spot test'' is a rapid and inexpensive test that visually identifies [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] produced by G6PD under [[ultraviolet light]]. When the blood spot does not fluoresce, the test is positive; it can be falsely negative in patients who are actively hemolysing. It can therefore only be done 2–3 weeks after a hemolytic episode.

When a macrophage in the spleen identifies a RBC with a Heinz body, it removes the precipitate and a small piece of the membrane, leading to characteristic "[[bite cells]]".  However, if a large number of Heinz bodies are produced, as in the case of G6PD deficiency, some Heinz bodies will nonetheless be visible when viewing RBCs that have been stained with crystal violet.  This easy and inexpensive test can lead to an initial presumption of G6PD deficiency, which can be confirmed with the other tests.

==Treatment==
The most important measure is prevention – avoidance of the drugs and foods that cause hemolysis. [[Vaccination]] against some common pathogens (e.g. [[hepatitis A]] and [[hepatitis B]]) may prevent infection-induced attacks.<ref name="pmid18159462">{{cite journal |author=Monga A, Makkar RP, Arora A, Mukhopadhyay S, Gupta AK |title=Case report: Acute hepatitis E infection with coexistent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency |journal=Can J Infect Dis |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=230–1 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=18159462 |pmc=2094938 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

In the acute phase of hemolysis, [[blood transfusion]]s might be necessary, or even [[dialysis]] in [[acute renal failure]]. Blood transfusion is an important symptomatic measure, as the transfused red cells are generally not G6PD deficient and will live a normal lifespan in the recipient's circulation.

Some patients may benefit from removal of the [[spleen]] ([[splenectomy]]),<ref name="pmid15621740">{{cite journal |author=Hamilton JW, Jones FG, McMullin MF |title=Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Guadalajara – a case of chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia responding to splenectomy and the role of splenectomy in this disorder |journal=Hematology |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=307–9 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15621740 |doi=10.1080/10245330410001714211 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1080/10245330410001714211&magic=pubmed }}</ref> as this is an important site of red cell destruction. [[Folic acid]] should be used in any disorder featuring a high red cell turnover. Although [[vitamin E]] and [[selenium]] have antioxidant properties, their use does not decrease the severity of G6PD deficiency.

==Epidemiology==
G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect, being present in more than 400 million people worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cappellini MD, Fiorelli G |title=Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9606 |pages=64–74 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18177777 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60073-2 |url=}}</ref> African, Middle Eastern and South Asian people are affected the most along with those who are mixed with any of the above.<ref>[http://www.rddiagnostics.com/g6pd_faq.htm G-6-PD FAQ section<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A side effect of this disease is that it confers protection against [[malaria]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mehta A, Mason PJ, Vulliamy TJ |title=Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency |journal=Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=21–38 |year=2000 |pmid=10916676 |doi=}}</ref> in particular the form of malaria caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', the most deadly form of malaria. A similar relationship exists between malaria and [[sickle-cell disease]]. One theory to explain this is that cells infected with the ''Plasmodium'' parasite are cleared more rapidly by the [[spleen]]. This phenomenon might give G6PD deficiency carriers an evolutionary advantage by increasing their fitness in malarial endemic environments.

==Prognosis==
G6PD-deficient individuals do not appear to acquire any illnesses more frequently than other people, and may have less risk than other people for acquiring [[ischemic heart disease]] and [[cerebrovascular disease]].<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/G6PD+deficiency+anaemia thefreedictionary.com > glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency] citing: Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine.

==History==
Favism is a disorder characterized by hemolytic anemia in response to ingestion of fava beans.  Favism as a diagnosis has been known since antiquity. One theory for the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans']] avoidance of beans is avoidance of favism, but more likely, this was a philosophical matter, such as the belief that beans and humans were created from the same material.<ref>Gabrielle Hatfield, ''review'' of Frederick J. Simoons, ''Plants of Life, Plants of Death'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1999. ISBN 0-299-15904-3.  In ''Folklore'' '''111''':317–318 (2000).

The modern understanding of the condition began with the analysis of patients who exhibited sensitivity to [[primaquine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alving AS, Carson PE, Flanagan CL, Ickes CE |title=Enzymatic deficiency in primaquine-sensitive erythrocytes |journal=Science |volume=124 |issue=3220 |pages=484–5 |year=1956 |month=September |pmid=13360274 |doi= 10.1126/science.124.3220.484-a|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/124/3220/484-a | format=PDF |bibcode=1956Sci...124..484C}}</ref> The discovery of G6PD deficiency relied heavily upon the testing of prisoner volunteers at [[Illinois State Penitentiary]], although today such studies cannot be performed. When some prisoners were given the drug primaquine, some developed [[hemolytic anemia]] but others did not. After studying the mechanism through [[Chromium|Cr<sup>51</sup>]] testing, it was conclusively shown that the hemolytic effect of primaquine was due to an intrinsic defect of erythrocytes.<ref name="beutler">{{cite journal |author=Beutler E |title=Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: a historical perspective |journal=Blood |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=16–24 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18156501 |doi=10.1182/blood-2007-04-077412 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/111/1/16}}</ref>
