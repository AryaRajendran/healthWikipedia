'''Atypical depression''' or depression with "atypical features" is a specifier, of a current or most recent [[Major Depressive Episode]] or component of [[Dysthymic Disorder]]. Despite its name, "atypical" depression is not meant to connote uncommon or unusual clinical presentation. Up to 40% of the depressed population may be classified as having atypical depression.<ref>http://www.mcmanweb.com/article-200.htm Atypical Depression</ref> It shares many of the typical symptoms of a Major Depressive Episode, but being characterized by mood reactivity in response to positive events. In contrast, sufferers specified with [[Melancholic depression|"melancholic features"]] generally do not experience an improvement in mood, even in reaction to pleasurable stimuli. Additionally, atypical depression is characterized by significant weight gain or an increased appetite, [[hypersomnia]], a heavy sensation in the limbs and [[Rejection sensitivity|interpersonal rejection sensitivity]] that results in significant social or occupational impairment.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000">American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Mood Disorders. In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) Washington, DC: Author.</ref>

Atypical depression is two to three times more common in women than in men.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/> Individuals with atypical features tend to report an earlier age of onset (e.g. while in high school) in their depressive episode, which also tend to be more chronic and only have partial remission between episodes. Younger individuals may be more likely to have atypical features, whereas, older individuals may more often have episodes with melancholic features.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/>

Atypical depression is more common in individuals with [[Bipolar I Disorder|Bipolar I]], [[Bipolar II Disorder|Bipolar II]], and [[Major Depressive Disorder]], Recurrent, with seasonal pattern.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/>

==Symptoms==
The [[DSM-IV-TR]] defines Atypical Depression as a subtype of Major Depressive Disorder with Atypical Features, characterized by:

a) Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events)

b) At least two of the following:

*Significant weight gain or increase in appetite;
*Hypersomnia (sleeping too much, as opposed to the insomnia present in melancholic depression);
*Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs);
*Long-standing pattern of [[Rejection_sensitivity#Rejection_sensitivity|interpersonal rejection sensitivity]] (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment.

c) Criteria are not met for [[Melancholic Depression|With Melancholic Features]] or [[Catatonia|With Catatonic Features]] during the same episode.

==Research==
In general, atypical depression tends to cause greater functional impairment than other forms of depression. Atypical depression is a chronic syndrome that tends to begin earlier in life than other forms of depression — usually beginning in the teenage years. Similarly, patients with atypical depression are more likely to suffer from [[personality disorder]]s and [[anxiety disorder]]s such as: [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]], [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]], and [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder]].<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/>

Recent research suggests that young people are more likely to suffer from [[hypersomnia]] while older people are more likely to suffer from [[polyphagia]].<ref name=Posternak,M.>{{cite journal|last=Posternak|first=Michael|coauthors=Zimmerman,M.|title=Symptoms of Atypical Depression|journal=Psychiatry Research|year=2001|month=November|volume=104|issue=2|pages=175–181|doi=10.1016/S0165-1781(01)00301-8|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/14067166576737150868.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2011|pmid=11711170}}</ref>

Medication response differs between chronic atypical depression and acute [[melancholic depression]]. Some studies<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/atypical-depression/AN01363 Atypical depression: How is it different from 'regular' depression?</ref> suggest that the older class of antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors ([[MAOI]]s), may be more effective at treating atypical depression. While the more modern [[SSRI]]s and [[SNRI]]s are usually quite effective in this illness, the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s typically are not.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/>

In addition, antidepressant responses can often be enhanced with supplimental medications, such as [[Bupropion]] or the atypical antipsychotic, [[Aripiprazole|Abilify]], which creates a combination treatment, and are offered additional effectiveness combined with psychotherapy.<ref>http://www.workpsychcorp.com/newsweek2.html Depression Update: Atypical Depression</ref> It is important to remember that such co-morbid syndromes as [[panic disorder]] may not be fully treated without additional medication(s).

Some experts hypothesize that atypical depression may be related to thyroid dysregulation. Some studies have found subtle [[thyroid]] abnormalities in people with atypical depression.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20070317050218/http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20040315/atypical-depression-thyroid-link-still-alive Atypical Depression: Thyroid Link Still Alive</ref> Another study suggests that patients may benefit from [[triiodothyronine]], a medication used to treat [[hypothyroidism]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v66n0812 |author=Iosifescu DV, Nierenberg AA, Mischoulon D, ''et al.'' |title=An open study of triiodothyronine augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=1038–42 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16086620 |url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10001405}}</ref>
