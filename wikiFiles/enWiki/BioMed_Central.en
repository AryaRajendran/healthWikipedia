'''BioMed Central''' ('''BMC''') is a [[United Kingdom]]-based, for-profit scientific publisher specialising in [[open access]] [[scientific journal|journal]] publication. BioMed Central and its sister companies [[Chemistry Central]] and [[PhysMath Central]] publish over 200 [[scientific journal]]s. Most BioMed Central journals are now published only online. BioMed Central describes itself as the first and largest open access science publisher. It is owned by [[Springer Science+Business Media]]. The Managing Director is [[Matthew Cockerill]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/35013218}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|10617188}}</ref>

== History ==
BioMed Central was founded in 2000 as part of the Current Science Group (now Science Navigation Group, SNG), a nursery of scientific publishing companies.  SNG chairman [[Vitek Tracz]] developed the concept for the company after NIH director [[Harold Varmus]]'s [[PubMed Central]] concept for open-access publishing was scaled back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infotoday.com/it/jan05/poynder.shtml |title=Interview with Vitek Tracz: Essential for Science |publisher=Infotoday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref>  The first director of the company was [[Jan Velterop]].  In 2002, the company's business model evolved to include article processing charges, and these have since been the primary source of revenue.

Tracz's SNG also publishes ''[[The Scientist]]'' (a [[popular science]] magazine&mdash;the daily news section is free access; the remainder is by subscription), [[Faculty of 1000]] (a subscription-only current awareness service highlighting recent biological and medical research), [[Global DataPoint]],  [[Telmap]] and [[People's Archive]].  Other companies that have been part of SNG in the past include Current Medicine Group, which publish medical books, journals, websites and the Images.MD medical image database (both acquired by Springer in 2005), Current Drugs (acquired by [[Thomson Reuters]]), and [[Current Biology]] and the [[Current Opinion]] journals (acquired by [[Elsevier]]).

In October 2008, it was announced that BioMed Central, [[Chemistry Central]], and [[PhysMath Central]] had been acquired by [[Springer Science+Business Media]], the second largest STM publister.<ref>{{cite web|last=Suber |first=Peter |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/10/springer-buys-biomed-central.html |title=Peter Suber, Open Access News |publisher=Earlham.edu |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref>

In 2007 [[Yale University Libraries]] stopped subsidizing page charges for affiliates of Yale who are using BioMed Central as the publisher of their works.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Connor|first=Elizabeth|year=2008|title=Interview with Harold E. Varmus of PLoS|journal=[[Journal of Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries]]|issue=2|pages=149–159|doi=10.1080/15424060802064352|volume=5|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15424060802064352}}</ref>

In November 2008, BioMed Central became an official supporting organisation of [[Healthcare Information For All by 2015]], a global initiative committed to a future where people are no longer dying for lack of knowledge.

== Products ==
BioMed Central owns and produces in-house six flagship journals: ''[[Journal of Biology]]'', ''[[Genome Biology]]'', ''[[Genome Medicine]]'', ''[[Arthritis Research and Therapy]]'', ''[[Breast Cancer Research]]'', and ''[[Critical Care (journal)|Critical Care]]''.  It also produces the [[BMC journals|BMC series]] of 65 journals covering the fields of biology and medicine, and including the leading titles ''[[BMC Biology]]'' and ''[[BMC Medicine]]''.  ''[[Chemistry Central Journal]]'' and the ''[[PhysMath]]'' series of journals are also produced by the company.  Most of the other journals published by BioMed Central are owned and produced independently by societies and academic editorial boards, with BioMed Central providing the hosting, publishing platform and marketing. 

All journals are published online; some of the flagship journals have in the past also been available as print subscriptions, but currently ''[[Arthritis Research and Therapy]]'' is the only journal to offer this.  Publications in BioMed Central journals are, immediately upon publication, released under the [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons "Attribution" license]] which grants permission to reuse publications and produce derivative work.  The only exceptions to this are the flagship journals, which reserve rights on review and commentary content; those articles are available to purchase on a subscription or on a pay-per-view basis, becoming freely available (but not fully open access){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} to all after six months.

The company also hosts three biomedical databases: [[Cases Database]], a database of medical [[case report]]s;<ref>[http://casesdatabase.com/ casesdatabase.com]</ref> [[Current Controlled Trials]], a database of [[clinical trials]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.controlled-trials.com/ |title=Current Controlled Trials - Clinical Trial Search. ISRCTN numbering scheme. Database of Clinical Trials |publisher=Controlled-trials.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref> and [[Biology Image Library]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biologyimagelibrary.com/ |title=Biology Image Library |publisher=Biology Image Library |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref>  The company also provides hosting for institutional repositories of publications based on the [[DSpace]] platform under the brand Open Repository.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openrepository.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Open Repository |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref>

The company resells subscriptions to the review journals of its former sister company, [[Current Drugs]], on its platform.  Those journals are now published by [[Thomson Reuters]] and are not open-access.
