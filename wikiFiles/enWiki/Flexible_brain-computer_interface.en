'''Flexible brain-computer interfaces''' ('''fBCIs''') are [[Multielectrode array|microelectode arrays]] fabricated on layers of [[polymer]]s (e.g. [[polyimide]]) as seen in [[flexible electronics]] 1) to record and process [[neural coding|neuronal signaling patterns]] and 2) to use this data to control an external device. The increased bendability of these devices make them less harmful to [[human brain|brain tissues]] after immediate [[implant (medicine)|implantation]] and long-term while also helping the arrays access areas of the brain that stiffer silicon-based arrays cannot.<ref name="Viventi">{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nn.2973|year=2011|last1=Viventi|first1=J|title=Flexible, foldable actively multiplexed, high-density electrode array for mapping brain activity in vivo|volume=14|pages=1599–1605|journal=Nature Neuroscience}}</ref><ref name="Wester">{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/6/2/024002|year=2009|last1=Wester|first1=BA|title=Development and characterization of in vivo flexible electrode compatible with large tissue displacements|volume=6|pages=1–7|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering}}</ref> Surface, flexible microelectrode arrays can attain [[angular resolution|resolutions]] comparable to those of invasive silicon-based arrays and higher than surface [[silicon]]-based arrays, making them good candidates for [[brain–computer interface|BCIs]] requiring the ability to resolve signaling patterns on the [[micrometre|microscale]].<ref name="Viventi"/>

==History and Development of fBCIs==

===Brain-Computer Interface Background===
{{Main|Brain-computer interface}}
[[Brain-computer interface]]s (BCIs) allow communication directly between the brain and external devices, for example letting patients operate an arm remotely or move a wheelchair by thinking about it. This process involves the ability to measure neuronal signaling patterns ''in vivo'' in real-time, transmit this data to an external device, analyze the signals using [[signal processing]], and translate the signals obtained into a certain movement.

====Origins====
The origin of BCIs was the [[electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG). Created in 1924 by the Germany physicist and professor [[Hans Berger]], this device used silver-foil electrodes attached to a patient's [[scalp]] to record brain activity via a [[galvanometer]]. Today, EEG has become an important [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] and research tool in studying patients' neuronal signaling patterns ''in vivo'' and can record [[action potential|neuronal signaling]] with high [[temporal resolution]]; it has also been pursued since the 1980s in noninvasive BCI research. Though there have been some successes in using this technology (including [[Lawrence Farwell]] and Emanuel Donchin at the [[University of Central Florida]] helping [[Locked-in syndrome]] patients communicate using a [[speech-generating device|speech synthesizer]], Jessica Bayliss at the [[University of Rochester]] allowing patients to control their environment by turning room lights on and off, and [[Bin He]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] using EEG to control the flight of a [[virtual reality|virtual]] helicopter in [[three-dimensional space|3D space]]). Though EEGs have potential in BCI applications because of their high temporal resolution, they are limited due to susceptibility to environmental [[noise (electronics)|noise]] and the need to train patients extensively to properly use them.<ref name = "Nicolelis">{{cite book | last = Nicolelis|first = Axel|title = Beyond boundaries: The new neuroscience of connecting brains with machines and how it will change our lives.| publisher = Time Books|year = 2011|month= March|pages = 368|isbn =0805090525}}</ref><ref name = "Pine">{{cite book | last = Pine|first = J|title = A history of microelectrode array development.| publisher = Springer|series = Advances in Network Electrophysiology (1st Ed.)|year = 2006|month=May|chapter = 1|pages = 3–23|url = http://www.springer.com/biomed/neuroscience/book/978-0-387-25857-7|isbn =9780387258584}}</ref>

====Microelectrode Arrays and Current BCIs====
[[File:Utah array pat5215088.jpg|200x135px|right|frame|Penetrating, silicon-based Utah microelectrode array.]] More widespread is the use of [[microelectrode array]]s in  BCIs for recording neuronal signaling. Developed originally in the late 1930s and early 1940s, microelectrodes are usually thin, rigid rods with a sharp tip, allowing individual [[electrode]]s to be inserted into the brain and record neuronal signals in real-time from the [[extracellular]] or [[intracellular]] neuron space; though the electrode [[drill bit shank|shanks]] were originally made of [[steel]] or [[tungsten]], microelectrodes today are usually made from [[silicon]]. Penetrating, sub-[[dura mater|dural]] microelectrodes have been organized into arrays since the 1970s to attain signaling patterns from a greater number of [[neuron]]s and a larger area than can be done by individual micrelectrodes; this includes the well established ''in vivo'' Utah and Michigan arrays. However these electrodes can only cover a small surface area of the brain, and microelectrode array technologies for BCIs are currently shifting towards development of surface microelectrode arrays that lay on top of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]]. Surface microelectrode arrays do not have the high [[angular resolution|spatial resolution]] of penetrating arrays; for ''in vivo'' use, however, the less harmful effects of surface arrays on the brain is important.<ref name = "Nicolelis"/><ref name = "Pine"/>

[[File:Monkey using a robotic arm.jpg|256x144px|left|frame|Implementation of a brain-computer interface (BCI) by the Schwartz group showing a rhesus monkey controlling a robotic arm through cortical activity.]] The first major BCI work was done in 1969 by Eberhard Fetz at the [[University of Washington]], in which monkeys controlled deflection of a [[biofeedback]] needle with [[cortex|cortical]] activity. Since, BCI technologies have advanced significantly (especially since the year 2000) with the creation of better [[algorithm]]s to reconstruct neuronal signaling patterns and advances in [[microfabrication|microelectronics fabrication]] techniques. At [[Duke University]], [[Miguel Nicolelis]] showed a [[robotic arm]] moving in the same pattern as a [[rhesus monkey]] reaching for an object on a [[computer monitor|computer screen]] due to a BCI reading the monkey's neuronal signaling patterns as it conducted the reaching motion. Taking this a step further, Andrew Schwartz at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] showed that rhesus monkeys could feed themselves using a robotic arm controlled by their thoughts; similarly, John Donoghue at [[Brown University]] showed that monkeys could move a [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] using their mind to track visual targets on a computer screen.<ref name = "Nicolelis"/> Currently, many of these pioneers in the BCI field have created the private company [[BrainGate]] to advance BCI technologies that will allow disabled individuals (e.g. [[amputation|loss of limbs]] or [[spinal cord injury|traumatic spinal cord injury]]) to conduct everyday functions using thought.<ref name="Hochberg">{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature04970|year=2006|last1=Hochberg|first1=LR|title=Neuronal ensemble control of prosthetic devices by a human with tetraplegia|volume=442|pages=164–171|journal=Nature|pmid=16838014}}</ref>

==Flexible Electronics for BCIs==
{{Main|Flexible electronics}}
[[Flexible electronics]] are [[polymer]]s or other flexible materials (e.g. [[silk]],<ref name="KimSilk">{{cite journal|year=2010|last1=Kim|first1=DH|title=Dissolvable films of silk fibroin for ultrathin, conformal bio-integrated electronics|volume=9|pages=511–517|journal=Nature Materials}}</ref> [[pentacene]], [[polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]], [[parylene]], [[polyimide]]<ref name="Boppart">{{cite journal|year=1992|last1=Boppart|first1=SA|title=A flexible perforated microelectrode array for extended neural recording|volume=39|pages=37–42|journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering}}</ref>) that are printed with [[electronic circuit|circuitry]]; the flexible nature of the [[organic compound|organic]] background materials allowing the electronics created to bend, and the [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication techniques]] utilized to create these devices resembles those used to create [[integrated circuit]]s and [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS).<ref name = "Blau">{{cite book | last = Blau|first = A|title = Prospects for neuroprosthetics: Flexible microelectrode arrays with polymer conductors| publisher = InTech|series = Applied Biomedical Engineering|year = 2011|month= August|chapter = 5|pages = 84–122|url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/applied-biomedical-engineering/prospects-for-neuroprosthetics-flexible-microelectrode-arrays-with-polymer-conductors|doi = 10.5772/23186|isbn =9789533072562}}</ref> Flexible electronics were first developed in 1960s and 1970s, but research interest increased in the mid-2000s. It is expected that flexible electronics will be used in everyday devices ranging from [[watch|wrist watches]] to [[solar cell]]s in the coming decade due to their adaptability.<ref name="KimBME">{{cite journal|year=2012|last1=Kim|first1=DH|title=Flexible and stretchable electronics for bio-integrated devices|volume=14|pages=113–128|journal=Annual Reviews in Biomedical Engineering|doi = 10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150018}}</ref> Therefore, it is expected that these devices will be used more widely in the future of fBCI technology. 

There are currently many fabrication approaches that are being pursued to create efficient, flexible microelectrode arrays. The most notable was for the fBCI created by Jonathan Viventi, now at the [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]], in 2011.<ref name="Viventi"/> This flexible [[microelectrode array]] was fabricated using a [[Multilayer soft lithography|multi-layer]] process, with the first layer containing [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[silicon]] ribbons on polyimide, the second layer containing horizontal and vertical interconnects on polyimide, subsequent layers composed of vertical [[network switch|interconnect]] access structures [[potting (electronics)|encapsulated]] in polyimide or epoxy, and finally [[platinum]] contact electrodes. There were 360 individual electrodes of 300 x 300 μm size spaced 500 μm apart in the final array. The polyimide backbone allowed the device to be able to be folded and slid into the [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] or [[Human anatomical terms|medial areas]] of the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. This array also used [[multiplexing]] to efficiently transmit signals recorded ''in vivo'' via a wire to an external computer.

==Benefits of fBCIs==
When [[biointerface|interfacing]] [[neuron]]s ''in vitro'' with [[microelectrode array|microelectrodes]], only cytocompatibility is important; this means that that the cell contents must not be adversely affected by the electrode. However, when implanting a BCI device into the brain, [[biocompatibility]] is necessary; this means that the entire biological system must be compatible with the device. This includes the [[pressure]] the device puts on the [[human brain|brain tissues]], the cytocompatibility with the neurons, and the long-term [[scar]]ring effects the device might have on the tissues.<ref name="LaPlaca">{{cite interview |last=LaPlaca |first=MC |subject= Flexible Microelectrode Arrays|interviewer= Ankita Tippur|format= In-Person|city=Atlanta, Georgia|date=October 2, 2012}}</ref> [[Silicon]] arrays such as the Utah array have been shown ''in vivo'' to lack strong biocompatibility. After 6–12 months, these arrays become [[biodegradation|degraded]] in the brain and must be replaced; further, long-term use of these arrays can cause [[cerebral hemorrhage|hemorrhaging]] and tissue [[inflammation]].<ref name="Viventi"/><ref name="Wester"/> For these reasons, fBCIs show promise of being more biocompatible with the brain ''in vivo'' than silicon BCIs.

The lack of biocompatibility of silicon microelectrode arrays with the brain seems to be related to the [[stiffness]] of the microelectrodes implanted.<ref name="Wester"/><ref name="Boppart"/> Conventional silicon BCIs with [[Elastic modulus|Young's moduli]] of approximately 140 GPa do not deform or conform to  brain tissues, which have a Young's modulus of approximately 3.24 kPa (5 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] different).<ref name="Wester"/> This "mechanical mismatch" between brain tissue and the silicon electrodes/microelectrode arrays currently implanted ''in vivo'' was further confirmed by Ravi Bellamkonda at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] using [[finite element method|finite element]] [[computer simulation|computational simulations]] of this system.<ref name="LaPlaca"/> For this reason, [[flexible electronics|flexible]] microelectrodes with lower Young's moduli (for example, 3.78 GPa for penetrating flexible microelectrodes created by Michelle LaPlaca at Georgia Tech<ref name="Wester"/> and 100 kPa for the surface flexible microelectrode array created by Jonathan Viventi<ref name="Viventi"/>) better match the stiffness of the neural environment in which they must exist long-term (ranging from months to decades). The increased bendability of the microelectrode array means not only that the arrays can better conform to the brain and [[single-unit recording|record signals]], but that the arrays also do not harm the brain tissue. Lastly, the use of [[flexible electronics]] in other biotechnological applications has shown that these systems do not degrade for ten years, meaning that fBCIs are a good long-term alternative to silicon BCIs.<ref name="Viventi"/>

==Applications and Current Uses of fBCIs==
[[Flexible electronics]] have been researched for many biomedical applications, including [[pressure]] [[sensor]]s for [[stent]]s in [[blood vessel]]s and electrodes on the [[heart]].<ref name="KimNat">{{cite journal|year=2012|last1=Kim|first1=DH|title=Inorganic semiconductor nanomaterials for flexible and stretchable bio-integrated electronics|volume=4|pages=1–9|journal=Nature Publishing Group Asia Materials|doi = 10.1038/am.2012.27|issue=4}}</ref> Because of this versatility, there have been in recent years many promising applications of flexible [[microelectrode array]]s in the brain. Jonathan Viventi, for example, performed experiments ''in vivo'' within [[cat|feline cat]] brains to spatially (in a certain space) and temporally (over a certain time) map neuronal signaling patterns (see "Neuronal mapping patterns" section in [[neurocomputational speech processing]]).<ref name="Viventi"/> In one experiment, visual [[evoked potential|evoked responses]] in the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] were measured by displaying a white flash of light for 200 ms at various locations on a screen (the [[visual field]]); the flexible microelectrode array he created then recorded various patterns of [[action potential|neuronal activity]] based on the location of the flash on the screen. This data was then used to train a [[restricted Boltzmann machine|deep belief net]] (DBN) [[statistical classification|classifier]] to identify the location of the flash on the screen, and more recordings were taken to test the trained DBN. Even for the small area (~90&nbsp;mm^2) of the brain covered, the DBN was able to correctly identify 23 of the 64 screen locations from neuronal recordings, and 42 of 64 locations were identified within 1 neighboring square.<ref name="Viventi"/>

In another experiment, seizures were introduced in the feline brain [[animal model|model]] using local administration of [[picrotoxin]] adjacent to the electrode array on the [[frontal lobe|frontal-medial]] area of the brain.<ref name="Viventi"/><ref name="Boppart"/> Because of the device’s ability to mold to this curved portion of the brain and the high [[angular resolution|spatial resolution]] of the array, this experiment for the first time mapped spatial patterns of neuronal signaling over time during [[seizure]]s. It was shown that clockwise and counterclockwise [[transverse wave|spiraling]] occurs very [[rhythm]]ically during picrotoxin-induced [[epilepsy]] with the direction of spiraling being changed by various [[plane wave]]s propagating through the measured area. In addition, it was shown that the spirals detected on the [[microscopic scale|micro-scale]] were vastly different than the recordings obtained on the [[macroscopic scale|macro-scale]].<ref name="Viventi"/>

Flexible microelectrode arrays have also been shown to have potential in [[visual prosthesis]] technologies, as shown in 2011 by researchers at the Seoul National University.<ref name="Koo">{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2090498|year=2011|last1=Koo|first1=K|title=Arrowhead-shaped microelectrodes fabricated on a flexible substrate for enhancing the spherical conformity of retinal prostheses|volume=20|pages=251–259|journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems}}</ref> After fabrication,  arrow-shaped microelectrodes in an array were placed both inside of [[agar]] balls modeling the [[eye]]s and ''in vivo'' into rabbit eyeballs. The flexible microelectrode array curved and attached to the inside of the eyeballs well, and [[optical coherence tomography]] images of the implanted arrays showed good [[biocompatibility]] by not tearing the [[retina|retinal tissue]]. This first design of a flexible microelectrode array for visual prostheses that fBCIs can be versatile and not only limited to [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] measurements.

==Future Aims of fBCI Technology==
The implications of fBCIs are vast. One possible [[medicine|clinical]] implication of this technology is that the fBCI itself may be able to first detect erratic signaling patterns ''in vivo'' (such as [[epilepsy|epileptic]] micropatterns) that underlie certain [[neuropathology|neuropathologies]] and then counteract these patterns by sending their own [[interference (wave propagation)|"cancelling"]] [[signal (electrical engineering)|electrical signals]].<ref name="Viventi"/>

The high [[angular resolution|resolution]] provided by this sub-[[dura mater|dural]] [[flexible electronics|flexible]] [[microelectrode array]] would also be able to adequately measure brain activity patterns spatially and temporally for applications in BCI systems without loss of [[reliability engineering|device performance]] or injuring [[human brain|brain tissue]] in the long-term. Expanding the device to cover larger areas of the brain or using more arrays to cover more parts of the brain would allow for more holistic analysis of neural signaling, thus creating more patient control and confidence in performing tasks using an external device.<ref name="Rubehn">{{cite journal|year=2009|last1=Rubehn|first1=B|title= A MEMS-based flexible multichannel ECoG-electrode array|volume=6|pages=1–10|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|doi = 10.1088/1741-2560/6/3/036003}}</ref> In addition, it may also be possible for patients to control multiple devices that serve various purposes simultaneously using fBCIs implanted in various regions of the brain.<ref name="Blau"/>

Lastly, flexible recording arrays would be able to be implanted between the two [[cerebral hemispheres|hemispheres]] of the brain, allowing [[brain-computer interface|BCI]] devices, for example, to record information from the [[motor cortex]] on both sides of the brain; this signaling could then be used to implement movements requiring multiple [[prosthesis|artificial prosthetic limbs]]. Further, the flexible nature of fBCIs implies that other implanted electrode technologies, such as the [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) electrode that is implanted to suppress [[tremor]]s in [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[essential tremor]] patients, may be able to conform and bend to important areas of the brain for recording more efficiently. For these reasons, the creation of fBCI technologies is an emerging field with major implications for how the human body will interface with external devices in the near future.
