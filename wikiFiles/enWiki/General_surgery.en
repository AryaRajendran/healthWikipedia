'''General surgery''' is a surgical specialty that focuses on [[abdominal]] contents including [[esophagus]], [[stomach]], small bowel, [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], [[liver]], [[pancreas]], [[gallbladder]] and [[bile duct]]s, and often the [[thyroid]] gland (depending on the availability of head and neck surgery specialists). They also deal with diseases involving the [[human skin|skin]], [[breast]], [[soft tissue]], and [[hernia]]s.

==Scope==

General surgeons may sub-specialize into one or more of the following disciplines:

===Trauma surgery===
{{Main|Trauma surgery}}
In the United States and Canada, the overall responsibility for trauma care falls under the auspices of general surgery. Some general surgeons obtain advanced training and specialty certification in this field alone. General surgeons must be able to deal initially with almost any surgical emergency. Often they are the first port of call to critically ill or gravely injured patients, and must perform a variety of procedures to stabilize such patients, such as [[intubation]], [[burr hole]], [[cricothyroidotomy]], and emergency [[laparotomy]] or [[thoracotomy]] to stanch bleeding.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

All general surgeons are trained in emergency surgery. Bleeding, infections, bowel obstructions and organ perforations are the main problems they deal with. [[Cholecystectomy]], the surgical removal of the gallbladder, is one of the most common surgical procedures done worldwide. This is most often done electively, but the gallbladder can become acutely inflamed and require an emergency operation. Ruptures of the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and small bowel obstructions are other common emergencies.

===Laparoscopic surgery===
{{Main|Laparoscopic surgery}}
This is a relatively new specialty dealing with minimal access techniques using cameras and small instruments inserted through 0.3 to 1&nbsp;cm incisions. [[Robotic surgery]] is now evolving from this concept (see below). Gallbladders, appendices, and colons can all be removed with this technique. Hernias are now repaired mostly laparoscopically. Most [[bariatric surgery]] is performed laparoscopically.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} General surgeons that are trained today are expected to be proficient in laparoscopic procedures.

===Colorectal surgery===
{{Main|Colorectal surgery}}
General surgeons treat a wide variety of major and minor colon and rectal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (such as [[ulcerative colitis]] or [[Crohn's disease]]), [[diverticulitis]], colon and rectal cancer, gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhoids.

===Breast surgery===
{{Main|Breast surgery}}
General surgeons perform a majority of all non-cosmetic breast surgery from lumpectomy to [[mastectomy]], especially pertaining to the evaluation and diagnosis, of [[breast cancer]].

===Vascular surgery===
{{Main|Vascular surgery}}
General surgeons can perform vascular surgery if they receive special training and certification in vascular surgery. Otherwise, these procedures are performed by vascular surgery specialists. However, general surgeons are capable of treating minor vascular disorders.

===Endocrine surgery===
{{Main|Endocrine surgery}}
General surgeons are trained to remove all or part of the thyroid and [[parathyroid gland]]s in the neck and the [[adrenal glands]] just above each [[Kidney (organ)|kidney]] in the abdomen. In many communities, they are the only surgeon trained to do this. In communities that have a number of subspecialists, other subspecialty surgeons may assume responsibility for these procedures.

===Transplant Surgery===
{{Main|Transplant surgery}}

Responsible for all aspects of pre-operative, operative, and post-operative care of abdominal organ transplant patients.  Transplanted organs include liver, kidney, pancreas, and more rarely small bowel.

===Surgical Oncology===
{{Main|Surgical Oncology}}

Surgical oncologist refers to a general surgical oncologist (a subspecialty of general surgery), but thoracic surgical oncologists, gynecologic oncologists and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients.  The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, supported by a number of clinical trials, that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume—i.e., the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient he becomes, and his or her patients experience improved survival rates as a result. This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted—even as common sense—that a surgeon who performs a given operation more often, will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. This is particularly true of complex cancer resections such as pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) for pancreatic cancer, and gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer.

===Cardiothoracic surgery===
{{Main|Cardiothoracic surgery}}

Cardiothoracic surgeons in the U.S. (D.O. or M.D.) first complete a general surgery residency (typically 5–7 years), followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship (typically 2–3 years).

==Trends==
In the last few years [[minimally invasive surgery]] has become more prevalent. Considerable enthusiasm has built around [[robotic surgery]] (also known as ''robotic-assisted surgery''), despite a lack of data suggesting it has significant benefits that justify its cost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lunca S, Bouras G, Stanescu AC |title=Gastrointestinal robot-assisted surgery. A current perspective |journal=Romanian journal of gastroenterology |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=385–91 |year=2005 |pmid=16400356 |doi=}}</ref>

==Training==
In Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States general surgery is a five to seven year [[resident (medicine)|residency]] and follows completion of [[medical school]], either [[Doctor of Medicine|MD, MBBS, MBChB]], or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] degrees. In Australia and New Zealand, a residency leads to eligibility for Fellowship of the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]]. In Canada, residency leads to eligibility for certification by and Fellowship of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]], while in the United States, completion of a residency in general surgery leads to eligibility for board certification by the [[American Board of Surgery]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Surgery]] which is also required upon completion of training for a general surgeon to have operating privileges at most hospitals in the United States.

In the United Kingdom, surgical trainees enter training after five years of medical school and two years of the [[Foundation Programme]]. During the two to three-year core training programme, doctors will sit the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. On award of the MRCS examination, surgeons may hold the title 'Mister' or 'Miss/Ms' rather than doctor. This is a tradition dating back hundreds of years in the United Kingdom. Trainees will then go onto Higher Surgical Training (HST), lasting a further four to five years. During this time they may choose to subspecialise. Before the end of HST, the examination of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) must be taken in general surgery plus the subspeciality. Upon completion of training, the surgeon will become a consultant surgeon and will be eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist Register and may work both in the NHS and independent sector as a consultant general surgeon. However, with the implementation of the European Working Time Directive limiting UK surgical residents to a 48-hour working week.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The introduction of a sub-consultant grade to enable those who have recently received a UK Certificate of Completion of Training may be necessary.
