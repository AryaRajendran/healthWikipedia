'''Nail diseases''' are distinct from diseases of the [[skin]]. Although [[nail (anatomy)|nail]]s are a [[skin appendage]], they have their own signs and symptoms which may relate to other medical conditions. Nail conditions that show signs of [[infection]] or [[inflammation]] require medical assistance.  [[Deformity]] or [[disease]] of the nails may be referred to as '''onychosis'''.

==Diseases==
[[File:Human nail anatomy.jpg|thumb|Anatomy of the basic parts of a human nail. A. Nail plate; B. lunula; C. root; D. sinus; E. matrix; F. nail bed; G. eponychium; H. free margin.]]

*''Onychia'' is an [[inflammation]] of the nail folds (surrounding tissue of the nail plate) of the nail with formation of [[pus]] and shedding of the nail.  Onychia results from the introduction of microscopic [[pathogen]]s through small wounds.

*''[[Ingrown nail|Onychocryptosis]]'', commonly known as "ingrown nails" (''unguis incarnatus''), can affect either the fingers or the toes.  In this condition, the nail cuts into one or both sides of the [[nail (anatomy)#nail bed|nail bed]], resulting in [[inflammation]] and possibly [[infection]]. The relative rarity of this condition in the fingers suggests that [[pressure]] from the ground or shoe against the toe is a prime factor. The movements involved in [[walking]] or other physical disturbances can contribute to the problem.  Mild [[onychocryptosis]], particularly in the absence of infection, can be treated by trimming and rounding the nail.  More advanced cases, which usually include [[infection]], are treated by [[surgically]] excising the ingrowing portion of the nail down to its bony origin and [[thermally]] or [[chemically]] [[cauterizing]] the matrix, or 'root', to prevent recurrence.  This surgery is called [[matrixectomy]]. The best results are achieved by cauterizing the matrix with [[phenol]]. The [[Ingrown nail|Vandenbos Procedure]] is a highly effective method that focuses on excision of excessive nail fold tissue without affecting the healthy nail and nail matrix. The Vandenbos procedure is showing high success rates in eliminating Onychocryptosis without altering the normal nail. Another, much less effective, treatment is [[Surgery#excision|excision]] of the matrix, sometimes called a 'cold steel procedure'.

*''[[Onychodystrophy]]'' is a [[deformity|deformation]] of the nails that can result from cancer [[chemotherapy]] which includes [[bleomycin]], [[hydroxyurea]], or [[5-fluorouracil]]. It can include [[discoloration]] of the nail, or [[dyschromia]].

*''[[Onychogryposis]]'', also called "ram's-horn nail", is a thickening and increase in [[curvature]] of the nail.  It is usually the result of injury to the matrix.  It may be partially [[hereditary]] and can also occur as a result of long-term neglect.  It is most commonly seen in the great [[toe]] but may be seen in other toes as well as the fingernails.  An affected nail has many grooves and ridges, is brownish in color, and grows more quickly on one side than on the other.  The thick curved nail is difficult to cut, and often remains untrimmed, exacerbating the problem.
[[File:Onychomycosis.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Onychomycosis]] in every nail of the right foot.]]

*''[[Onycholysis]]'' is a loosening of the exposed portion of the nail from the nail bed, usually beginning at the free edge and continuing to the [[lunula (anatomy)|lunula]].  It is frequently associated with an [[internal disorder]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[infection]], [[nail fungi]], [[allergy]] to [[nail enhancement product]]s, or side effects of [[drug]]s.
*''[[Onychomadesis]]'' is the separation and falling off of a nail from the [[nail (anatomy)#nail bed|nail bed]].Common causes include localized [[infection]], minor injury to the [[matrix bed]], or severe [[systemic illness]]. It is sometimes a side effect of [[chemotherapy]] or [[x-ray]] treatments for [[cancer]]. A new nail plate will form once the cause of the disease is removed.
*''[[Onychomycosis]]'', also known as [[tinea|''tinea unguium'']], is a contagious [[infection]] of the nail caused by the same [[fungal organism]]s which cause [[ringworm]] of the [[skin]] (''Trichophyton rubrum'' or ''T. mentagrophytes'', rarely other [[trichophyton]] species or ''Epidermophyton floccosum'' <ref name="mycology">{{cite book |last= Hall |first= John C. |editor= John C. Hall |title= Sauer's Manual of Skin Diseases |edition= 9th |year= 2006 |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location= Philadelphia |isbn= 0-7817-2947-5|pages= 244=266 |chapter= 25. Dermatologic mycology.}}</ref>). It can result in [[discoloration]], [[thickening]], [[chalkiness]], or crumbling of the nails and is often treated by powerful oral medications which, rarely, can cause severe side effects including [[liver failure]]. Mild [[onychomycosis]] sometimes responds to a combination of [[topical]] [[antifungal medication]], sometimes applied as special [[medicinal]] nail [[lacquer]], and [[periodic filing]] of the nail surface. For advanced onychomycosis, especially if more than one nail is [[infection|infected]], systemic medication (pills) is preferred. Home remedies are often used, although their effectiveness is disputed. In a study at the University of Rochester [[tea tree oil]] applied twice daily in conjunction with [[debridement]] was found to be an appropriate initial treatment strategy, equally effective to topical use of [[clotrimazole]].<ref name="scratch">{{cite journal | author=Buck DS, Nidorf DM, Addino JG | title=Comparison of two topical preparations for the treatment of onychomycosis: Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil and clotrimazole | pmid=8195735 | year=1994 | volume=38 | issue=6 | pages=601â€“5 | journal=The Journal of family practice}}</ref>

[[Image:HEMORRHAGESUBUNG1.JPG|thumb|right|Subungual hematoma (mild)]]
*''[[Onychophosis]]'' is a growth of [[horn (anatomy)|horny]] [[epithelium]] in the nail.
*''[[Onychoptosis]]'' is the periodic shedding of one or more nails, in whole or part. This condition may follow certain diseases such as [[syphilis]], or can result from [[fever]], trauma, [[systemic upset]]s or [[adverse reaction]] to drugs.
*''[[Onychorrhexis]]'' also known as brittle nails, is brittleness with breakage of fingernails or toenails.
*''[[Paronychia]]'' is a [[bacterial]] or [[fungal]] [[infection]] where the nail and [[skin]] meet.
*''[[Koilonychia]]'' is when the nail curves upwards (becomes spoon-shaped) due to an [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]].  The normal process of change is: brittle nails, straight nails, spoon-shaped nails.

*''[[Subungual hematoma]]'' occurs when trauma to the nail results in a collection of [[blood]], or [[hematoma]], under the nail.  It may result from an acute injury or from repeated minor [[Physical trauma|trauma]] such as running in undersized shoes.  Acute [[subungual hematoma]]s are quite painful, and are usually treated by releasing the [[blood]] by creating a small hole in the nail.  [[Drilling]] and [[cauterization|thermal cautery]]  are common methods for creating the hole.  Thermal cautery is not used on [[acrylic nails]] because they are [[flammable]].

*''[[Onychomatricoma]]'', a tumor of the nail matrix.

*''Nail [[Pemphigus]]'', an auto-immune disease.

*''[[Longitudinal erythronychia|Erythronychia]]'', red bands in the nail from some inflammatory conditions.

*''[[Melanonychia]]'', a black or brown discoloration of the of the nail, with numerous causes.

==Nail changes and conditions associated with them==

Nail inspection can give a great deal of information about the internal working of the body as well, and like tongue or [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] inspection, has a long history of diagnostic use in traditional medical practices such as [[Chinese medicine]]. 
Nail disease can be very subtle and should be evaluated by a dermatologist with a focus in this particular area of medicine.<ref>http://www.nailsmag.com/feature.aspx?fid=762&ft=1</ref>  A nail technician may be the first to note a subtle change in nail health.<ref>Common nail tumors.
