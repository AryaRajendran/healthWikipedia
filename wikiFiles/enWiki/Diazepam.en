'''Diazepam''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|d|aɪ|ˈ|æ|z|ɨ|p|æ|m}}), first marketed as '''Valium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|v|æ|l|i|ə|m}}) by [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], is a [[benzodiazepine]] [[drug]].

It is commonly used to treat [[anxiety]], [[panic attacks]], [[insomnia]], [[seizure]]s (including ''[[status epilepticus]]''), [[muscle spasms]] (such as in [[tetanus]] cases), [[restless legs syndrome]], [[alcohol withdrawal]], [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]], [[opiate withdrawal syndrome]] and [[Ménière's disease]]. It may also be used before certain medical procedures (such as [[endoscopy|endoscopies]]) to reduce tension and anxiety, and in some surgical procedures to induce [[amnesia]].<ref name="PubChem">{{cite web|author=|year= 2006|url=http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=3016|title=Diazepam|work=[[PubChem]]| publisher=National Institute of Health: National Library of Medicine|accessdate= 2006-03-11}}</ref><ref name="NLM">{{cite web|author=|year=2006|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2006/MB_cgi?mode=&term=Diazepam|title=Diazepam|work=Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)|publisher= National Library of Medicine|accessdate= 2006-03-10}}</ref>

Adverse effects of diazepam include [[anterograde amnesia]] (especially at higher doses) and [[sedation]], as well as [[paradoxical effects]] such as excitement, rage or worsening of seizures in epileptics. Benzodiazepines also can cause or worsen [[Major depression|depression]]. [[Long-term effects of benzodiazepines]] such as diazepam include [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[benzodiazepine dependence]] and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] upon dose reduction. After cessation of benzodiazepines, [[cognitive]] deficits may persist for at least six months and it was suggested that longer than six months may be needed for recovery from some deficits.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> Diazepam also has physical dependence potential and can cause serious problems of physical dependence with long term use. Compared to other benzodiazepines, though, physical withdrawal from diazepam following long term use is usually far more mild due to its long elimination half-life. Nevertheless, urgent action by national governments to improve prescribing practices has been recommended<ref name="Dièye-2006"/>. Diazepam is the drug of choice for treating [[benzodiazepine dependence]], with its low potency, long duration of action and the availability of low-dose tablets making it ideal for gradual dose reduction and the circumvention of withdrawal symptoms.

Advantages of diazepam are a rapid onset of action{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and high efficacy rates, which is important for managing acute seizures, anxiety attacks and panic attacks; benzodiazepines also have a relatively low toxicity in overdose.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> Diazepam is a core medicine in the [[World Health Organization]]'s ''[[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|Essential Drugs List]]'', which list minimum medical needs for a basic health care system.<ref name="essentialWHO">{{cite web | month = March | year = 2005 | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2005/a87017_eng.pdf | title = WHO Model List of Essential Medicines | format = PDF | publisher = World Health Organization | accessdate = 2006-03-12 }}</ref> Diazepam was first synthesized by [[Leo Sternbach]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = L.

===Availability===
Diazepam is marketed in over 500 brands throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ilae.org/Visitors/Centre/AEDs/index.cfm| title=International AED Database| accessdate=2009-09-16| publisher=ILAE}}</ref> It is supplied in oral, injectable, inhalation and rectal forms.<ref name="Inchem" /><ref name="ElephantCare" /><ref>Pharmaceutical Patents. http://www.pharmcast.com/Patents100/Yr2004/Oct2004/101904/6805853_Diazepam101904.htm</ref>

The [[United States military]] employs a specialized diazepam preparation known as CANA {{Anchor|CANA}}(Convulsive Antidote, Nerve Agent), which contains a mixture of diazepam, [[atropine]] and [[pralidoxime]]. One CANA kit is typically issued to service members, along with three [[Mark I NAAK]] kits, when operating in circumstances where chemical weapons in the form of [[nerve agents]] are considered a potential hazard. Both of these kits deliver drugs using [[autoinjector]]s. They are intended for use in "buddy aid" or "self aid" administration of the drugs in the field prior to [[decontamination]] and delivery of the patient to definitive medical care.<ref>[[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense|U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense]], ''Medical Management of Chemical Casualties Handbook'', Third Edition (June 2000), [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], MD, pp. 118–126.</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam include [[anterograde amnesia]] and confusion (especially pronounced in higher doses) and [[sedation]]. The elderly are more prone to adverse effects of diazepam, such as confusion, [[amnesia]], [[ataxia]] and hangover effects, as well as falls.

===Tolerance and dependence===
Diazepam, as with other [[benzodiazepine]] drugs, can cause [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[physical dependence]], [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] and what is known as the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Withdrawal from diazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms similar to those seen during [[barbiturate]] or [[alcohol withdrawal]]. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. 

Withdrawal symptoms can occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use, and can range from insomnia and anxiety to more serious symptoms, including seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble pre-existing conditions and be misdiagnosed. Diazepam may produce less intense withdrawal symptoms due to its long [[elimination half-life]]. 

Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.<ref name="Riss-2008"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = MacKinnon GL | coauthors = Parker WA. | year = 1982 | title = Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome: a literature review and evaluation | journal = The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse. | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–33 | pmid = 6133446 | doi = 10.3109/00952998209002608}}</ref> Tolerance develops to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines; for example tolerance occurs to the anticonvulsant effects and as a result benzodiazepines are not generally recommended for the long-term management of epilepsy. Dose increases may overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may increase. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines includes uncoupling of receptor sites, alterations in [[gene expression]], down-regulation of receptor sites, and desensitisation of receptor sites to the effect of GABA. Approximately one-third of individuals who take benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks become dependent and experience a withdrawal syndrome upon cessation.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> 

Differences in rates of withdrawal (50–100%) vary depending on the patient sample. For example, a random sample of long-term benzodiazepine users typically finds around 50% experience little or no withdrawal symptoms, with the other 50% experiencing notable withdrawal symptoms. Certain select patient groups show a higher rate of notable withdrawal symptoms, up to 100%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Onyett SR |title=The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and its management |journal=The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners |volume=39 |issue=321 |pages=160–3 |year=1989 |month=April |pmid=2576073 |pmc=1711840}}</ref>

Patients from the aforementioned groups should be monitored very closely during therapy for signs of abuse and development of dependence. Therapy should be discontinued if any of these signs are noted, although if [[physical dependence]] has developed, therapy must still be discontinued gradually to avoid severe [[withdrawal symptoms]]. Long-term therapy in these people is not recommended.<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="RXL.Abuse" />

People suspected of being physiologically dependent on benzodiazepine drugs should be very gradually tapered off the drug. Although rare, withdrawals can be life-threatening, particularly when excessive doses have been taken for extended periods of time. Equal prudence should be used whether dependence has occurred in therapeutic or recreational contexts.

Diazepam in and of itself is not a recreational drug{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, but may be used to either enhance or "come down" from the effects of other recreational drugs. For example, diazepam increases the euphoriant effects of heroin (and other recreational opiates), yet decreases the undesirable side effects of cocaine and/or methamphetamine come-down.

===Overdose===

Although not usually fatal when taken alone, a diazepam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The [[antidote]] for an overdose of diazepam (or any other benzodiazepine) is [[flumazenil]] (Anexate). This drug is only used in cases with severe respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications. Because flumazenil is a short-acting drug, and the effects of diazepam can last for days, several doses of flumazenil may be necessary. [[Artificial respiration]] and stabilization of cardiovascular functions may also be necessary. Although not routinely indicated, [[activated charcoal]] can be used for decontamination of the stomach following a diazepam overdose. [[Emesis]] is contraindicated. [[Dialysis]] is minimally effective. Hypotension may be treated with [[levarterenol]] or [[metaraminol]].<ref name="Inchem"/><ref name="Drugs.com"/><ref name="RXL.Overdose"/><ref name="Barondes1"/>

===Interactions===
If diazepam is administered concomitantly with other drugs, attention should be paid to the possible pharmacological interactions. Particular care should be taken with drugs that enhance the effects of diazepam, such as barbiturates, [[phenothiazines]], [[narcotics]] and [[antidepressants]].<ref name="Drugs.com" />

Diazepam does not increase or decrease hepatic enzyme activity, and does not alter the metabolism of other compounds. No evidence would suggest diazepam alters its own metabolism with chronic administration.<ref name="Inchem" />

Agents that have an effect on hepatic cytochrome P450 pathways or conjugation can alter the rate of diazepam metabolism. These interactions would be expected to be most significant with long-term diazepam therapy, and their clinical significance is variable.<ref name="Inchem" />

===Mechanism of action===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine}}
Diazepam binds to a specific subunit on the [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] receptor at a site distinct from the binding site of the [[endogenous]] GABA molecule, known as an allosteric site. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is an inhibitory channel which, when activated, decreases neuronal activity. Benzodiazepines do not supplement for the neurotransmitter GABA, rather benzodiazepines such as diazepam bind to a different location on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, resulting in enhanced GABA effects. Benzodiazepines cause an increased opening of the chloride ion channel when GABA binds to its site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, leading to more chloride ions entering the neuron, which in turn leads to enhanced central nervous system depressant effects.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> Diazepam binds non-selectively to alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 subunit containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.<ref name="Atack-2005">{{Cite journal | last1 = Atack | first1 = JR. | title = The benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors as a target for the development of novel anxiolytics | journal = Expert Opin Investig Drugs | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 601–18 | month = May | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1517/13543784.14.5.601 | pmid = 15926867 }}</ref>

Because of the role of diazepam as a positive [[Allosteric regulation|allosteric modulator]] of GABA, when it binds to benzodiazepine receptors, it causes [[inhibitory]] effects. This arises from the [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] of the post[[synapse|synaptic]] membrane, owing to the control exerted over negative [[chloride]] [[ion]]s by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.<ref name="Drugs.com">{{cite web | author= Thomson Healthcare (Micromedex) | month= March | year= 2000 | url= http://www.drugs.com/pdr/diazepam.html | title= Diazepam | work= Prescription Drug Information | publisher= Drugs.com | accessdate= 2006-03-11 }}</ref><ref name="Barondes2" />

The anticonvulsant properties of diazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors.

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:Diazepam5mgPack.JPG|thumb|right|[[Generic drug|Generic]] pack of 5 mg Diazepam.]]
Diazepam can be administered orally, [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]]ly (IV) (needs to be diluted, as it is painful and damaging to veins), [[intramuscular injection|intramuscular]]ly (IM), or as a [[suppository]].<ref name="Inchem">{{cite web | author= Pere Munne/M. Ruse, Ed. | year= 1990/1998 Ed. | url= http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim181.htm | title= Diazepam | work= Inchem.org | publisher= Inchem.org | accessdate= 2006-03-11}}</ref>

When administered orally, it is rapidly absorbed and has a fast onset of action. The onset of action is one to five minutes for IV administration and 15–30 minutes for IM administration. The duration of diazepam's peak pharmacological effects is 15 minutes to one hour for both routes of administration.<ref name="Cuny.edu">{{cite web | author= Langsam, Yedidyah | year= <!––Unknown––> | url= http://eilat.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/newnyc/DRUGS/Diazepam.htm | title= DIAZEPAM (VALIUM AND OTHERS) | work= | publisher= Brooklyn College (Eilat.sci.Brooklyn.CUNY.edu) | accessdate= 2006-03-23}}</ref> The bioavailability after oral administration is 100%, and 90% after rectal administration. Peak plasma levels occur between 30 and 90 minutes after oral administration and between 30 and 60 minutes after intramuscular administration; after rectal administration, peak plasma levels occur after 10 to 45 minutes. Diazepam is highly protein bound, with 96 to 99% of the absorbed drug being protein bound. The distribution half-life of diazepam is two to 13 minutes.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

When diazepam is administered IM, absorption is slow, erratic and incomplete.<ref name="DrugBank">{{cite journal | title = Drug Bank - Diazepam | url = http://redpoll.pharmacy.ualberta.ca/drugbank/cgi-bin/getCard.cgi?CARD=APRD00642.txt }}</ref>

Diazepam is highly lipid-soluble, and is widely distributed throughout the body after administration. It easily crosses both the [[blood–brain barrier]] and the [[placenta]], and is excreted into breast milk. After absorption, diazepam is redistributed into [[muscle]] and [[adipose]] tissue. Continual daily doses of diazepam quickly build to a high concentration in the body (mainly in [[adipose tissue]]), far in excess of the actual dose for any given day.<ref name="Riss-2008"/><ref name="Inchem" />

Diazepam is stored  preferentially in some organs, including the heart. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the [[neonate]], and withdrawal of diazepam during pregnancy and breast feeding is clinically justified.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olive G | coauthors = Dreux C. | year = 1977 | month = January | title = Pharmacologic bases of use of benzodiazepines in peréinatal medicine | volume = 34 | pages = 74–89 | pmid = 851373 | journal = Arch Fr Pediatr. | issue = 1 }}</ref>

Diazepam undergoes oxidative metabolism by demethylation (CYP 2C9, 2C19, 2B6, 3A4, and 3A5), hydroxylation (CYP 3A4 and 2C19) and [[glucuronidation]] in the [[liver]] as part of the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme system. It has several pharmacologically [[active metabolites]]. The main active metabolite of diazepam is [[nordiazepam|desmethyldiazepam]] (also known as nordazepam or nordiazepam). Its other active metabolites include the minor active metabolites [[temazepam]] and [[oxazepam]]. These metabolites are conjugated with [[glucuronide]], and are excreted primarily in the urine. Because of these active metabolites, the serum values of diazepam alone are not useful in predicting the effects of the drug. Diazepam has a biphasic [[half-life]] of about one to three days, and two to seven days for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

Most of the drug is metabolised; very little diazepam is excreted unchanged.<ref name="Inchem" />

The elimination half-life of diazepam and also the active metabolite [[desmethyldiazepam]] increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action, as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vozeh S. | coauthors = | date = November 21, 1981 | title = [Pharmacokinetic of benzodiazepines in old age] | journal = Schweiz Med Wochenschr. | volume = 111 | issue = 47 | pages = 1789–93 | pmid = 6118950 }}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
Diazepam may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma diazepam concentrations are usually in a range of 0.1-1.0&nbsp;mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1–5&nbsp;mg/L in those arrested for impaired driving and 2–20&nbsp;mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with diazepam, but confirmation and quantitation is usually performed using chromatographic techniques.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=A.

===Physical properties===
Diazepam occurs as solid white or yellow crystals with a melting point of 131.5 to 134.5 °C. It is odorless, and has a slightly bitter taste. The [[British Pharmacopoeia]] lists diazepam as being very slightly soluble in water, soluble in alcohol and freely soluble in chloroform. The [[United States Pharmacopoeia]] lists diazepam as soluble 1 in 16 ethyl alcohol, 1 in 2 of chloroform, 1 in 39 [[ether]], and practically insoluble in water. The [[pH]] of diazepam is neutral (i.e., pH = 7). Diazepam has a shelf life of five years for oral tablets and three years for IV/IM solutions.<ref name="Inchem" />
Diazepam should be stored at room temperature (15–30°C). The solution for parenteral injection should be protected from light and kept from freezing. The oral forms should be stored in air-tight containers and protected from light.<ref name="ElephantCare">{{cite web|author=Mikota, Susan K. and Plumb, Donald C.|year=2005|url= http://www.elephantcare.org/Drugs/diazepam.htm|title=Diazepam|work=The Elephant Formulary|publisher= Elephant Care International|accessdate=}}</ref>

Diazepam can absorb into plastic, so is not stored in plastic bottles or syringes, etc. It can absorb into plastic bags and tubing used for intravenous infusions. Absorption appears to depend on several factors, such as temperature, concentration, flow rates, and tube length. Diazepam should not be administered if a precipitate has formed and does not dissolve.<ref name="ElephantCare"/>

===Chemistry===
From a chemical point of view, diazepam, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one, is the most simple of all of the examined derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones. Various ways for the synthesis of diazepam from 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone have been proposed. The first two ways consist of the direct cyclocondensation of 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone or 2-methylamino-5-chlorobenzophenone with the ethyl ester of glycine hydrochloride. The amide nitrogen atom of the obtained 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one, is methylated by dimethylsulfate, which leads to the formation of diazepam.
[[File:Diazepam synthesis.png|600px|center]]
The second way differs from the first in that the methylation of nitrogen is accomplished
before the cyclocondensation reaction. To do this, the initial 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone is first tosylated by p-toluenesulfonylchloride and the obtained tosylate transformed into the N-sodium salt, which is then alkylated by dimethylsulfate. The resulting 2-N-tosyl-N-methyl-5-chlorobenzophenone is hydrolyzed in an acidic medium, giving 2-methylamino-5-chlorobenzophenone, which undergoes cyclocondensation by reaction with ethyl ester of glycine hydrochloride, forming the desired diazepam.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1021/jo01070a038}}</ref><ref>K.B.

==History==
Diazepam was the second benzodiazepine invented by Dr. [[Leo Sternbach]] of [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] at the company's [[Nutley, New Jersey]], facility<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/business/roche-to-shut-down-former-us-headquarters-after-83-years.html, Roche to Shut Former U.S. Headquarters, New York Times on-line, June 26, 2012]</ref>following [[chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium), which was approved for use in 1960. Released in 1963 as an improved version of Librium, diazepam became incredibly popular, helping Roche to become a pharmaceutical industry giant. It is 2.5 times more potent than its predecessor, which it quickly surpassed in terms of sales. After this initial success, other pharmaceutical companies began to introduce other benzodiazepine derivatives.<ref name="Obituary">{{cite news

The benzodiazepines gained popularity among medical professionals as an improvement upon [[barbiturate]]s, which have a comparatively narrow [[therapeutic index]], and are far more sedating at therapeutic doses. The benzodiazepines are also far less dangerous; death rarely results from diazepam overdose, except in cases where it is consumed with large amounts of other [[depressants]] (such as alcohol or other sedatives).<ref name="Barondes1">{{cite book | first= Samuel H. | last= Barondes | year= 2003 | month= | title= Better Than Prozac | pages= 47–59 | location= New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn= 0-19-515130-5 }}</ref> Benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam initially had widespread public support, but with time the view changed to one of growing criticism and calls for restrictions on their prescription.<ref name="Marshall-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Marshall | first1 = KP. | last2 = Georgievskava | first2 = Z. | last3 = Georgievsky | first3 = I. | title = Social reactions to Valium and Prozac: a cultural lag perspective of drug diffusion and adoption | journal = Res Social Adm Pharm | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–107 | month = June | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.sapharm.2008.06.005 | pmid = 19524858 }}</ref>

A large-scale, nationwide study conducted by [[SAMHSA]] found benzodiazepines in the USA are the most frequently abused pharmaceutical, with 35% of drug-related visits to the emergency department involving benzodiazepines. They are more commonly abused than opiate pharmaceuticals, which accounted for 32% of visits to the emergency department. No other pharmaceutical is more commonly abused than benzodiazepines. Males abuse benzodiazepines as commonly as females. Of drugs used in attempted suicide, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used pharmaceutical drug, with 26% of attempted suicides involving benzodiazepines. The most commonly abused benzodiazepine is, however, [[alprazolam]]. [[Clonazepam]] is the second-most-abused benzodiazepine. [[Lorazepam]] is the third-most-abused benzodiazepine, and diazepam the fourth-most-abused benzodiazepine in the [[USA]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/files/DAWN2k4ED.htm|title= Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2004: National Estimates of Drug-Related Emergency Department Visits|accessdate= 9 May 2008|author= United States Government|authorlink= samhsa|coauthors= U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES|year= 2004|publisher= Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080331184508/http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/files/DAWN2k4ED.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 31 March 2008}}</ref>
