==History==
===Overview===
Originally named the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, the school was founded in 1916 by [[William H. Welch]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]]. The school was renamed the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health on April 20, 2001 in honor of [[Michael Bloomberg]] (founder of the [[Bloomberg L.P.|eponymous media company]]) for his financial support and commitment to the school and Johns Hopkins University. Bloomberg has donated a total of $1.1 billion to the school over a period of several decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/publichealthnews/press_releases/PR_2001/bloomberg_name.html|title=Hopkins Names Public Health School for Michael Bloomberg}}</ref> 

The school is also the founder of [[Delta Omega]] (est. 1924), the national honorary society for graduate studies in public health.<ref>[http://www.deltaomega.org/about.cfm Deltaomega.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.jhsph.edu/Delta_Omega/index.html JHSPH.edu]</ref> The Bloomberg School is fully accredited by the [[Council on Education for Public Health|Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/publichealthnews/articles/2007/accreditation2007.html|title=Bloomberg School Receives Seven Year Accreditation}}</ref>

===Origins===
In 1913, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] sponsored a conference on the need for public [[health education]] in the United States. Foundation officials were convinced that a new profession of public health was needed. It would be allied to medicine but also distinct, with its own identity and educational institutions.<ref>Gebbie, Kristine, Rosenstock, Linda, & Hernandez, Lyla M. eds. (2003) ''Who will keep the public healthy?: Educating public health professionals for the 21st century''. Washington D.C.: National Academies Press. p. 228</ref> The result of deliberations between public health leaders and foundation officials was the Welch-Rose Report of 1915, which laid out the need for adequately trained public [[health workers]] and envisioned an "institute of hygiene" for the United States.<ref>ibid p. 229</ref> The Report, reflected the different preferences of the plan's two architects--[[William Henry Welch]] favoured [[scientific research]], whereas Wickliffe Rose wanted an emphasis on public [[Health science|health practice]].<ref>ibid p. 228</ref>

In June 1916, the executive committee of the Rockefeller Foundation approved the plan to organize an institute or school of public health at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The institute was named the School of Hygiene and Public Health, indicating a compromise between those who wanted the practical public health training on the British model and those who favoured basic scientific research on the German model.<ref>ibid p. 229</ref> Welch, the first Dean of the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] also became the founding Dean of the first school of public health in the United States.

===Legacy===
The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health represents the archetype for formalized public health education in the United States. By 1922, other schools of public health at [[Harvard School of Public Health|Harvard]], [[Mailman School of Public Health|Columbia]] and [[Yale School of Public Health|Yale]] had all been established in accordance with the Hopkins model.<ref>ibid p. 230</ref> The Rockefeller Foundation continued to sponsor the creation of public health schools in the United States and around the world in the 1920s and 1930s, extending the American model of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health to countries such as Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, England, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Rumania, Sweden, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.<ref>ibid.</ref>
