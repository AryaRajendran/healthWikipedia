'''Hepatitis D''', also referred to as '''hepatitis D virus''' ('''HDV''') and classified as ''Hepatitis delta virus'', is a [[disease]] caused by a small circular enveloped [[RNA virus]]. It is one of five known [[hepatitis]] viruses: [[hepatitis A|A]], [[hepatitis B|B]], [[hepatitis C|C]], D, and [[hepatitis E|E]]. HDV is considered to be a [[Satellite (biology)|subviral satellite]] because it can propagate only in the presence of the [[hepatitis B|hepatitis B virus]] (HBV).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Makino S|title=Molecular cloning and sequencing of a human hepatitis delta (delta) virus RNA|journal=Nature|volume=329|issue=6137|pages=343–6|year=1987|pmid=3627276|doi=10.1038/329343a0|author-separator=,|author2=Chang MF|author3=Shieh CK|display-authors=3|last4=Kamahora|first4=Toshio|last5=Vannier|first5=David M.|last6=Govindarajan|first6=Sugantha|last7=Lai|first7=Michael M. C.}}</ref> Transmission of HDV can occur either via simultaneous infection with HBV ([[coinfection]]) or superimposed on chronic hepatitis B  or hepatitis B carrier state ([[superinfection]]).

Both superinfection and coinfection with HDV results in more severe complications compared to infection with HBV alone. These complications include a greater likelihood of experiencing liver failure in acute infections and a rapid progression to liver [[cirrhosis]], with an increased chance of developing [[liver cancer]] in chronic infections.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fattovich G|title=Influence of hepatitis delta virus infection on morbidity and mortality in compensated cirrhosis type B|journal=Gut|volume=46|issue=3|pages=420–6|year=2000|month=March|pmid=10673308|pmc=1727859|url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10673308|doi=10.1136/gut.46.3.420|author-separator=,|author2=Giustina G|author3=Christensen E|display-authors=3|last4=Pantalena|first4=M|last5=Zagni|first5=I|last6=Realdi|first6=G|last7=Schalm|first7=SW}}</ref> In combination with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis D has the highest mortality rate of all the hepatitis infections, at 20%.

===History===
Hepatitis D virus was first reported in the mid-1977, by an Italian researcher, Mario Rizzetto,<ref>Manuale di Gastroenterologia Unigastro pag. 260</ref> as a nuclear antigen in patients infected with HBV who had severe liver disease <ref>{{cite journal|last=Rizzetto|first=M|coauthors=Canese MG, Arico S, Criello O, Trepo C, Bonino F, Verme G|title=Immunofluorescence detection of new antigen-antibody system (delta/anti-delta) associated to hepatitis B virus in liver and in serum of HBsAg carriers|journal=Gut|year=1997|volume=18|issue=12|pages=997–1003|pmid=75123|pmc=1411847|doi=10.1136/gut.18.12.997}}</ref> This nuclear antigen was then thought to be a hepatitis B antigen and was called the delta antigen.

The HDV is a small, spherical virus with a 36&nbsp;nm diameter. It has an outer coat containing three HBV envelope proteins (called large, medium, and small hepatitis B surface antigens), and host lipids surrounding an inner nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid contains single-stranded, circular RNA of 1679 nucleotides and about 200 molecules of hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) for each genome. The central region of HDAg has been shown to bind RNA.<ref name="pmid8245865">{{cite journal | author = Poisson F, Roingeard P, Baillou A, Dubois F, Bonelli F, Calogero RA, Goudeau A | title = Characterization of RNA-binding domains of hepatitis delta antigen | journal = J.

Normally RNA polymerase II utilizes DNA as a template and produces mRNA. Consequently, if HDV indeed utilizes RNA polymerase II during replication, it would be the only known animal pathogen capable of using a DNA-dependent polymerase as an RNA-dependent polymerase.

The RNA polymerases treat the RNA genome as double stranded DNA due to the folded rod-like structure it is in. Three forms of RNA are made; circular genomic RNA, circular complementary antigenomic RNA, and a linear polyadenylated antigenomic RNA, which is the mRNA containing the open reading frame for the HDAg. Synthesis of antigenomic RNA occurs in the nucleolus, mediated by RNA Pol I, whereas synthesis of genomic RNA takes place in the nucleoplasm, mediated by RNA Pol II.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Li|first=YJ|coauthors=Macnaughton, T, Gao, L, Lai, MM|title=RNA-Templated Replication of Hepatitis Delta Virus: Genomic and Antigenomic RNAs Associate with Different Nuclear Bodies|journal=Journal of Virology|date=2006 Jul|volume=80|issue=13|pages=6478–86|pmid=16775335|doi=10.1128/JVI.02650-05|pmc=1488965}}</ref> HDV RNA is synthesized first as linear RNA that contains many copies of the genome.

There are eight reported genotypes of HDV with unexplained variations in their geographical distribution and pathogenicity.

===Delta antigens===

A significant difference between viroids and HDV is that, while viroids produce no proteins, HDV is known to produce one protein, namely HDAg. It comes in two forms; a 27kDa large-HDAg, and a small-HDAg of 24kDa. The N-terminals of the two forms are identical, they differ by 19 more amino acids in the C-terminal of the large HDAg.<ref name="Weiner1988">{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=AJ|coauthors=Choo, QL, Wang, KS, Govindarajan, S, Redeker, AG, Gerin, JL, Houghton, M|title=A single antigenomic open reading frame of the hepatitis delta virus encodes the epitope(s) of both hepatitis delta antigen polypeptides p24 delta and p27 delta|journal=Journal of Virology|date=1988 Feb|volume=62|issue=2|pages=594–9|pmid=2447291|pmc=250573}}</ref> Both isoforms are produced from the same reading frame which contains an UAG stop codon at codon 196, which normally produces only the small-HDAg. However, editing by cellular enzyme adenosine deaminase-1 changes the stop codon to UCG, allowing the large-HDAg to be produced <ref name="Weiner1988" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Jayan|first=GC|coauthors=Casey, JL|title=Inhibition of Hepatitis Delta Virus RNA Editing by Short Inhibitory RNA-Mediated Knockdown of ADAR1 but Not ADAR2 Expression|journal=Journal of Virology|date=2002 Dec|volume=76|issue=23|pages=12399–404|pmid=12414985|doi=10.1128/JVI.76.23.12399-12404.2002|pmc=136899}}</ref> 
Despite having 90% identical sequences, these two proteins play diverging roles during the course of an infection. HDAg-S is produced in the early stages of an infection and  enters the nucleus and supports viral replication. HDAg-L, in contrast, is produced during the later stages of an infection, acts as an inhibitor of viral replication, and is required for assembly of viral particles.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sato S, Cornillez-Ty C, Lazinski DW|title=By Inhibiting Replication, the Large Hepatitis Delta Antigen Can Indirectly Regulate Amber/W Editing and Its Own Expression|journal=J.

==Transmission==

The routes of transmission of hepatitis D are similar to those for hepatitis B. Infection is largely restricted to persons at high risk of hepatitis B infection, particularly injecting drug users and persons receiving clotting factor concentrates. Worldwide more than 15 million people are co-infected. HDV is rare in most [[Developed country|developed countries]], and is mostly associated with [[Drug injection|intravenous drug use]]. However, HDV is much more common in the immediate Mediterranean region, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and the northern part of South America.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Radjef N|title=Molecular Phylogenetic Analyses Indicate a Wide and Ancient Radiation of African Hepatitis Delta Virus, Suggesting a Deltavirus Genus of at Least Seven Major Clades|journal=J.

==Treatment and prevention==
The vaccine for hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D virus because of the latter's dependence on the  presence of hepatitis B virus for it to replicate .<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001264/ U.S. National Library of Medicine "Delta Agent (hepatitis D)]"</ref><ref name="isbn0-12-375147-0">{{cite book |author= Tayor, JM|title=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=121 |isbn=0-12-375147-0}}</ref>

==Evolution==

Three genotypes (I-III) were originally described. Genotype I has been isolated in Europe, North America, Africa and some Asia. Genotype II has been found in Japan, Taiwan, and Yakutia (Russia). Genotype III has been found exclusively in South America (Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela). Some genomes from Taiwan and the Okinawa islands have been difficult to type but have been placed in genotype 2. However it is now known that there are at least 8 genotypes of this virus (HDV-1 to HDV-8).<ref name=Celik2011>{{cite journal |author=Celik I, Karataylı E, Cevik E, ''et al.'' |title=Complete genome sequences and phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis delta viruses isolated from nine Turkish patients |journal=Arch.
