'''Diseases of poverty''' is a term sometimes used to collectively describe [[disease]]s, [[Disability and poverty|disabilities]], and health conditions that are more [[prevalent]] among the [[poverty|poor]] than among [[wealth]]ier people.  In many cases poverty is considered the leading [[risk factor]] or determinant for such diseases, and in some cases the diseases themselves are identified as barriers to economic development that would end poverty. These diseases are in contrast to so-called "[[diseases of affluence]]", which are diseases thought to be a result of increasing wealth in a society. Diseases of poverty are often co-morbid and ubiquitous with malnutrition.<ref name= primary>Singh, A. R., & Singh, S. A. (2008). Diseases of Poverty and Lifestyle, Well-Being and Human Development. Mens Sana Monographs, 6(1), 187-225.</ref>

==Contributing factors==
For many environmental and social reasons, including crowded living and working conditions, inadequate [[sanitation]], and disproportionate occupation as [[sex worker]]s, the poor are more likely to be exposed to [[infectious disease]]s.  Malnutrition, stress, overwork, and inadequate, inaccessible, or non-existent health care can hinder recovery and exacerbate the disease.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Health and Poverty |chapterurl=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch5/index.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch1/index.htm}}</ref>  [[Malnutrition]] is associated with 54% of childhood deaths from diseases of poverty, and lack of skilled attendants during childbirth is primarily responsible for the high maternal and infant death rates among the poor.<ref name="who.int"/><ref>[http://www.who.int/mdg/goals/goal4/en/index.html WHO | Goal 4: reduce child mortality<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Contaminated Water Supply===
Each year many children and adults die as a result of a lack of access to clean drinking water and poor sanitation.  Many combinable diseases and many of the poverty related diseases spread as a result of inadequate access to clean drinking water.  According to UNICEF 3,000 children die every day, worldwide due to contaminated drinking water and poor sanitation.<ref name= unicef>http://www.unicefusa.org/work/water/</ref> Although the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people who did not have access to clean water by 2015, was reached five years ahead of schedule in 2010, there are still 783 million people who rely on unimproved water sources.<ref name=unicef/> In 2010 the United Nations declared access to clean water a fundamental human right, integral to the achievement of other rights.  This made it enforceable and justifiable to permit governments to ensure their populations access to clean water.<ref name= water1>Singh, Nandita, Per Wickenberg, Karsten Åström, and Håkan Hydén. 2012. "Accessing water through a rights-based approach: problems and prospects regarding children." Water Policy 14, no. 2: 298-318.</ref> Though access to water has improved for some, it continues to be especially difficult for women and children.  Women and girls bear most of the burden for accessing water and supplying it to their households.  In India and Sub- Saharan Africa, and parts of Latin America, women are required to travel long distance in order to access clean water source. This has a significant impact on girls’ educational attainment .<ref name=water1/><ref>Access to Clean Water and Sanitation Pose 21st-Century Challenge for Millions. JAMA. 2004;292(3):318-320. doi:10.1001/jama.292.3.318.</ref> There have been further efforts to improve water quality using new technology which allows water to be disinfected immediately upon collection and during the storage process.  Clean water is necessary for cooking, cleaning, and laundry because many people come into contact with disease causing pathogens through their food, or while bathing or washing.<ref>Mintz, E., Reiff, F., & Tauxe, R. (1995). Safe water treatment and storage in the home. A practical new strategy to prevent waterborne disease. JAMA: The Journal Of The American Medical Association, 273(12), 948-953.</ref>

===Inadequate sanitation===
Contaminated water and inadequate sanitation are related to diseases of poverty such as malaria, [[parasitic disease]]s, and [[schistosomiasis]].<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=Common water and sanitation-related diseases |year=2005 |work= |publisher=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/wash/index_wes_related.html}}</ref> These infections act as cofactors that increase the risk of HIV transmission.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/>
Standpipes and sanitation are provided in most developing areas, but the death rates are not significantly reduced. One of the reasons that water-related diseases are still occurring because water supplies can be contacted by contaminated surface water. To effectively decrease the morbidity and mortality of diseases, the population should get access to water from home instead from outside. Therefore in addition to the installation of standpipes, water supplies and sanitation should be provided within houses.<ref>Walsh, Julia A., and Kenneth S. Warren. 1980. Selective primary health care: An interim strategy for disease control in developing countries. Social Science & Medicine. Part C: Medical Economics 14 (2):145-163.</ref>

===Poor nutrition===
Malnutrition disproportionately affect those in sub-Saharan Africa. Over 35 percent of children under the age of 5 in sub-Saharan Africa show physical signs of malnutrition.<ref name=Piwoz00>{{cite web |author=Piwoz, Ellen G.; Preble, Elizabeth A. |title=HIV/AIDS and Nutrition: A Review of the Literature and Recommendations for Nutritional Care and Support in Sub-Saharan Africa |date=December 2000 |publisher=Academy for Educational Development |location=Washington DC |url=http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PNACK673.pdf |id=PN-ACK-673 |format=PDF}}</ref> Malnutrition, the immune system, and infectious diseases operate in a cyclical manner: infectious diseases have deleterious effects on nutritional status, and nutritional deficiencies can lower the strength of the immune system which affects the body’s ability to resist infections.<ref name=Piwoz00/> Similarly, malnutrition of both [[macronutrients]] (such as [[protein]] and [[energy]]) and [[micronutrients]] (such as [[iron]], [[zinc]], and [[vitamins]]) increase susceptibility to HIV infections by interfering with the immune system and through other biological mechanisms. Depletion of macronutrients and micronutrients promotes [[viral replication]] that contributes to greater risks of HIV transmission from mother-to-child as well as those through sexual transmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friis H, Michaelsen KF |title=Micronutrients and HIV infection: a review |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=157–63 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9537299 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600546 }}</ref> Increased mother-to-child transmission is related to specific deficiencies in micronutrients such as vitamin A.<ref name=Semba94/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Nimmagadda A, O'Brien WA, Goetz MB |title=The significance of vitamin A and carotenoid status in persons infected by the human immunodeficiency virus |journal=Clin.

In the United States, 11.1 percent of households struggle with food insecurity.<ref name=food>Chilton, M. (2009). A Rights-Based Approach to Food Insecurity in the United States. American Journal Of Public Health, 99(7), 1203.</ref>   Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to quality food for a healthy lifestyle.<ref name= food />  The rate of hunger and malnutrition in female headed households was three times the national average at 30.2 percent.  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 10 percent of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean are affected by hunger and malnutrition.<ref name=hunger>Freeing Latin America and the Caribbean from hunger http://www.fao.org</ref>

===Improper health care===
Degrees of social status are closely linked to health inequalities.<ref name= commission>Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. Closing the Gap in a Generation. World Health Organization, 2008.</ref>   Those with poor health tend to fall into poverty and the poor tend to have poor health.  According to the World Health Organization, within countries those of lower socioeconomic strata have the worst health outcomes. Health also appears to have a strong social component linking it to education and access to information.<ref>World Health Organization</ref>  In terms of health, poverty includes low income, low education, social exclusion and environmental decay.<ref name= Ghana>Adjei, P., & Buor, D. (2012). From poverty to poor health: Analysis of socio-economic pathways influencing health status in rural households of Ghana. Health Sociology Review, 21(2), 232-241.</ref>  The poor within most countries are trapped in a cycle in which poverty breeds ill health and ill health breeds poverty.<ref name= Adam>Adam Wagstaff. Poverty and Health Sector Inequalities. Policy and Practice, 2002</ref>

====Health Disparities====
Socioeconomic status affects three areas of health; healthcare in general, environmental exposure, and health behavior. When examining child health within the United States, those with the worst health were found to be those from low incomes families and those with little education. As socioeconomic status increased so did overall health outcomes.<ref name= paula>Paula A. Braveman. Socioeconomic Disparities in Health in the United States: What the Patterns Tell Us. American Journal of Public Health, Vol 100, 2010.</ref>   The same was found for African American children as well as Hispanic children with indicators of health improving as income and education levels increased.<ref name= paula/>   For adults within the United States, health status and life expectancy improved as education levels and levels of income increased across racial groups.<ref name= paula/> 

In sub-Saharan Africa, there are extreme differences in the maternal and child health indicators between the richest and poorest 20 percent of the populations.<ref>Rispel, L. C., Palha de Sousa, C. D., & Molomo, B. G. (2009). Can Social Inclusion Policies Reduce Health Inequalities in Sub-Saharan Africa?--A Rapid Policy Appraisal. Journal Of Health, Population, & Nutrition, 27(4), 492-504. P 494.</ref>  Many African countries also face regional and geographic disparities. By 2025 the rural population of Africa is expected to grow from 510 to 702 million people and these populations face deteriorating conditions, such as poor sanitation, that adversely affects their health.<ref>Adjei, P., & Buor, D. (2012). From poverty to poor health: Analysis of socio-economic pathways influencing health status in rural households of Ghana. Health Sociology Review, 21(2), 232-241. (1)
</ref>  In rural communities of Ghana for example, poverty has become the largest determinant of poor health and life expectancy. In the case of Ghana and other developing countries, poverty causes more death and illness than plague, pestilence or faming.<ref name= Ghana/>   Of the Developing World Latin America appears to have the highest inequalities in child health between the poor and non-poor.<ref name= Adam/>  Poor populations of both the developed and developing world face the challenges of limited access to care, a lack of information about healthcare options, and living conditions that predispose them to many poverty related diseases. In all parts of the world, including industrialized nations the gap in health inequalities is growing rather than narrowing.<ref name= Adam/> 
There are a number of underlying causes for these disparities, such as a lack of control by poor women over household resources leading to poor health outcomes for children, as well as a lack of availability of health resources in poorer areas.<ref name= Adam/>

===Poverty===
{{See also|Social determinants of health in poverty}}

Poverty and disease are tied closely together, with each factor aiding the other.<ref name= primary/> Many diseases that primarily affect the poor serve to also deepen poverty and worsen conditions.  Poverty also significantly reduces people's capabilities making it more difficult to avoid poverty related diseases.<ref name= primary/>
The majority of diseases and related mortality in poor countries is due to preventable, treatable diseases for which medicines and treatment regimes are readily available. Poverty is in many cases the single dominating factor in higher rates of prevalence of these diseases. Poor hygiene, ignorance in health-related education, non-availability of safe drinking water, inadequate nutrition and indoor pollution are factors exacerbated by poverty.<ref name="IPN 10/90"/>

Just the big three PRDs — TB, AIDS/HIV and Malaria — account for 18% of diseases in poor countries.<ref name="IPN 10/90"/> The disease burden of treatable childhood diseases in high-mortality, poor countries is 5.2% in terms of [[disability-adjusted life year]]s but just 0.2% in the case of advanced countries.<ref name="IPN 10/90"/>

In addition, [[infant mortality]] and [[maternal mortality]] are far more prevalent among the poor. For example, 98% of the 11,600 daily maternal and [[neonate|neonatal]] deaths occur in [[developing countries]].<ref name="who.int">[http://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/en/ WHO | Ensuring skilled care for every birth.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Diseases==
Together, diseases of poverty kill approximately 14 million people annually.<ref name="results.org"/>  [[Gastroenteritis]] with its associated [[diarrhea]] results in about 1.8&nbsp;million deaths in children yearly with most of these in the world's poorest nations.<ref name=M93>{{cite book|last=Dolin|first=[edited by] Gerald L. Mandell, John E.

At the global level, the three primary poverty-related diseases (PRDs) are [[AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="wpro.who.int">[http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20020916.htm WHO/WPRO-Poverty Issues Dominate RCM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  [[Developing countries]] account for 95% of the global AIDS prevalence<ref>{{cite book |chapter=HIV/AIDS and Poverty |chapterurl=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch6/index.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch1/index.htm}}</ref> and 98% of active tuberculosis infections.<ref name="results.org">[http://www.results.org/website/article.asp?id=238 RESULTS: World Health/Diseases of Poverty.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Furthermore, 90% of malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>[http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/372/RBMInfosheet_1.htm Roll Back Malaria Partnership: What is malaria?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Together, these three diseases account for 10% of global [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name="wpro.who.int"/>

Treatable childhood diseases are another set which have disproportionately higher rates in poor countries despite the availability of cures for decades. These include [[measles]], [[pertussis]] and [[polio]].<ref name="IPN 10/90">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf |title=Diseases of Poverty and the 10/90 gap |author=Stevens, Philip |date=November 2004 |publisher=International Policy Network |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>

Three other diseases, [[measles]], [[pneumonia]], and [[diarrheal diseases]], are also closely associated with poverty, and are often included with AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis in broader definitions and discussions of diseases of poverty.<ref>http://www.results.org/website/article.asp?id=238</ref>

===Neglected diseases===
Based upon the spread of research in cures for diseases, certain diseases are identified and referred to as "[[neglected diseases]]". These include the following diseases:<ref name="IPN 10/90"/>
*[[African trypanosomiasis]]
*[[Chagas disease]]
*[[Leishmaniasis]]
*[[Lymphatic filariasis]]
*[[Guinea worm]]
*[[Onchocerciasis]]
*[[Schistosomiasis]]
*[[Trichomoniasis]]
Tropical diseases such as these tend to be neglected in research and development efforts. Of 1393 new drugs brought into use over a period of 25 years (1975–1999), only a total of thirteen, less than 1%, related to these diseases. Of 20 MNC drug companies surveyed for research on PRDs, only two had projects targeted towards these neglected PRDs. However, the combined total number of deaths due to these diseases is dwarfed by the enormous number of patients affected by PRDs such as respiratory infections, HIV/AIDs, diarrhoea and tuberculosis, besides many others.<ref name="IPN 10/90"/>
Similar to the spread of tropical neglected diseases in developing nations, these neglected infections disproportionately affect poor and minority populations in the United States.<ref>Hotez PJ (2008)Neglected Infections of Poverty in the United States of America.PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2(6):e256.doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000256</ref>   These diseases have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as priorities for public health action based on the number of people infected, the severity of the illnesses, and the ability to prevent and treat them.<ref>Centers For Disease Control http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/npi.html</ref>

====Trichomoniasis====
Trichomoniasis is the most common STI affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. It is especially prevalent among young, poor and African American Women.  This infection is also common in poor communities is Sub-Saharan Africa and impoverished parts of Asia. This neglected infection is one of special concern because it is associated with a heightened risk for contracting HIV and pre-term deliveries.<ref>Ko, H., Jamieson, D. J., Hogan, J. W., Anderson, J., Klein, R. S., Susan, C., & Paula, S. (2002). Prevalence, Incidence, and Persistence or Recurrence of Trichomoniasis among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Positive Women and among HIV-Negative Women at High Risk for HIV Infection. Clinical Infectious Diseases, 34(10), 1406-1411.
</ref>  

In addition, availability of cures and recent advances in medicine have led to only three diseases being considered as neglected diseases, namely, African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis.<ref name="IPN 10/90"/>

===Malaria===
Africa accounts for a majority of [[malaria]] infections and deaths worldwide. Over 80 percent of the 300 to 500 million malaria infections occurring annually worldwide are in Africa.<ref name= malaria>Crosse, M. (2005).

===Intestinal parasites===
[[Intestinal parasites]] are extremely prevalent in tropical areas.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/> These include [[hookworms]], [[roundworms]], and other [[amoebas]]. They can aggravate malnutrition by depleting essential nutrients through intestinal [[blood loss]] and chronic [[diarrhea]]. Chronic worm infections can further burden the immune system.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bentwich Z, Kalinkovich A, Weisman Z |title=Immune activation is a dominant factor in the pathogenesis of African AIDS |journal=Immunol.

===Schistosomiasis===
[[Schistosomiasis]] (bilharzia) is a parasitic disease caused by the parasitic flatworm [[trematodes]]. Moreover, more than 80 percent of the 200 million people worldwide who have schiostosomiasis live in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name=WHO04Schisto>World Health Organization (WHO). 2004. http://www.who.int/tdt/diseases/schisto/diseaseinfo.htm (accessed March 2011).</ref> Infections often occur in contaminated water where freshwater snails release larval forms of the parasite. After penetrating the skin and eventually traveling to the intestines or the urinary tract, the parasite lays eggs and infects those organs.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/><ref name=WHO04Schisto/> It damages the [[intestines]], [[bladder]], and other organs and can lead to anemia and protein-energy deficiency.<ref name=Scrimshaw97/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Stephenson L |title=The impact of schistosomiasis on human nutrition |journal=Parasitology |volume=107 |issue=Suppl|pages=S107–23 |year=1993 |pmid=8115176 |doi=10.1017/S0031182000075545 }}</ref> Along with malaria, schiostosomiasis is one of the most important parasitic cofactors aiding in HIV transmission.

===Tuberculosis===
[[Tuberculosis]] is the leading cause of death around the world for an infectious disease.<ref>Tuberculosis: Commentary on a Reemergent Killer. Barry R. Bloom and Christopher J. L. Murray.</ref> This disease is especially prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Latin American and Caribbean region.  While the tuberculosis rate is decreasing in the rest of the world, it is increasing by rate of 6 percent per year in Sub-Saharan Africa.  It is the leading cause of death for people with HIV in Africa. Tuberculosis (TB) is closely related to lifestyles of poverty, overcrowded conditions, alcoholism, stress, drug addiction and malnutrition.   This disease spreads quickly among people who are undernourished.<ref name= primary/> According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in the United States, tuberculosis is more prevalent among foreign born persons, and ethnic minorities.  The rates are especially high among Hispanics, Blacks and Asians.<ref>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Morbidity and Mortality Report. March 25, 2011.</ref>
HIV infection and TB are also closely tied.  Being infected with HIV increases the rate of activation of latent TB infections, and having TB, increases the rate of HIV replication, therefore accelerating the progression of AIDS.<ref name= primary/>

Many of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are ravaged with poverty and many people live on less than one United States dollar a day.<ref name= Stillwaggon>Elieen Stillwaggon, Aids and the Ecology of Poverty. Oxford University Press. New York</ref> The poverty in these countries gives rise to many other factors that explain the high prevalence of AIDS. The poorest people in most African countries suffer from malnutrition, lack of access to clean water, and have improper sanitation.  Because of a lack of clean water many people are plagued by intestinal parasites that significantly increase their chances of contracting HIV due to compromised immune system.  Malaria, a disease still rampant in Africa also increases the risk of contracting HIV.  These parasitic diseases, affect the body’s immune response to HIV, making people more susceptible to contracting the disease once exposed.  Genital schistosomiasis, also prevalent in the topical areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and many countries worldwide, produces genital lesions and attract CD4 cells to the genital region which promotes HIV infection.  All these factors contribute to the high rate of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. Many of the factors seen in Africa are also present in Latin America and the Caribbean and contribute to the high rates of infections seen in those regions.  In the United States, poverty is a contributing factor to HIV infections.  There is also a large racial disparity, with African Americans having a significantly higher rate of infection than their white counterparts.<ref name= Stillwaggon/>

===Asthma===
More than 300 million people worldwide have [[asthma]]. The rate of asthma increases as countries become more urbanized and in many parts of the world those who develop asthma do not have access to medication and medical care.<ref>“Global Burden of Asthma.” Matthew Masoli, Denise Fabian, Shaun Holt, Richard Beasley. Report developed for: Global Initiative for Asthma. http://www.ginasthma.org/reports-global-burden-of-asthma.html</ref> Within the United States, African Americans and Latinos are four times more likely to suffer from severe asthma than white.  The disease is closely tied to poverty and poor living conditions.<ref>Flores, G.,. (2009). Urban Minority Children with Asthma: Substantial Morbidity, Compromised Quality and Access to Specialists, and the Importance of Poverty and Specialty Care. Journal Of Asthma, 46(4), 392-398.</ref>  Asthma is also prevalent in children in low income countries. Homes with roaches and mice, as well as mold and mildew put children at risk for developing asthma as well as exposure to cigarette smoke.<ref name= asthmafacts/> 
Unlike many other Western countries, the mortality rate for asthma has steadily risen in the United States over the last two decades.<ref>“Global Burden of Asthma.” Matthew Masoli, Denise Fabian, Shaun Holt, Richard Beasley. Report developed for: Global Initiative for Asthma. http://www.ginasthma.org/pdf/GINABurdenReport.pdf p.86</ref> Mortality rates for African American children due to asthma are also far higher than that of other racial groups.<ref>Yinusa-Nyahkoon, L.

===Cardiovascular disease===
Though [[heart disease]] is not exclusive to the poor, there are aspects of a life of poverty that contribute to its development.  This category includes [[coronary heart disease]], [[stroke]] and [[heart attack]].  Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and there are disparities of morbidity between the rich and poor.  Studies from around the world link heart disease to poverty. Low neighborhood income and education were associated with higher risk factors.   Poor diet, lack of exercise and limited (or no) access to a specialist were all factors related to poverty, though to contribute to heart disease.<ref>John Yinger, Housing Discrimination and Residential Segregation.  Understanding Poverty. New York.</ref>
Both low income and low education were predictors of coronary heart disease, a subset of cardiovascular disease.  Of those admitted to hospital in the United States for heart failure, women and African Americans were more likely to reside in lower income neighborhoods.  In the developing world, there is a 10 fold increase in cardiac events in the black and urban populations.<ref>Lee, G., & Carrington, M. (2007). “Tackling heart disease and poverty.” Nursing & Health Sciences, 9(4), 290-294. doi:10.1111/j.1442-2018.2007.00363.x</ref>

===Obstetrical fistula===
[[Obstetric fistula]] or vaginal fistula is a medical condition in which a [[fistula]] (hole) develops between either the [[rectum]] and [[vagina]] (see [[rectovaginal fistula]]) or between the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and vagina (see [[vesicovaginal fistula]]) after severe or failed [[childbirth]], when adequate medical care is not available.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Creanga|first=A.

"Obstetric Fistula In Ilorin, Nigeria." Plos Medicine 1.1 (2004): 022-024. Academic Search Complete. Web. 25 Oct. 2012.</ref>

===Dental decay===
Dental Decay or [[Dental caries]] is the gradual destruction of tooth enamel.  Poverty is a significant determinant for oral health.<ref>DYE, B. (2010). Trends in Oral Health by Poverty Status as Measured by Healthy People 2010 Objectives. Public Health Reports, 125(6), 817.</ref> Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide.  In the United States it is the most common chronic disease of childhood.  Risk factors for dental caries includes living in poverty, poor education, low socioeconomic status, being part of an ethnic minority group, having a developmental disability, recent immigrants and people infected with HIV/AIDS.<ref>Selwitz, R. H., Ismail, A. I., & Pitts, N. B. (2007). Dental caries. Lancet, 369(9555), 51-59</ref>  In Peru, poverty was found to be positively correlated with dental caries among children.<ref name="Delgado-Angulo, E. 2009">Delgado-Angulo, E., Hobdell, M., & Bernabé, E. (2009). Poverty, social exclusion and dental caries of 12-year-old children: a cross-sectional study in Lima, Peru. BMC Oral Health, (1), 16.</ref>  According to a report by U.S health surveillance, tooth decay peaks earlier in life and is more severe in children with families living below the poverty line.<ref name="Delgado-Angulo, E. 2009"/> Tooth decay is also strongly linked to dietary behaviors, and  in poor rural areas where nutrient dense foods, fruits and vegetables are unavailable, the consumption  of sugary and fatty food increases the risk of dental decay.<ref>Mobley C; Marshall TA; Milgrom P; Coldwell, S. (2009). The contribution of dietary factors to dental caries and disparities in caries. Academic Pediatrics, 9(6), 410-414.</ref>   Because the mouth is a gateway to the repertory and digestive tracts, oral health has a significant impact on other health outcomes.  Gum disease has been linked to diseases such as cardiovascular disease.<ref>Ehrlich, R. (2010). HOLISTIC HEALTHCARE: A DENTAL PERSPECTIVE. Australasian College Of Nutritional & Environmental Medicine Journal, 29(3), 9-12</ref>

==Consequences==
Diseases of poverty reflect the dynamic relationship between poverty and poor health; while such diseases result directly from poverty, they also perpetuate and deepen impoverishment by sapping personal and national health and financial resources. For example, malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations, and by killing tens of millions in sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS alone threatens “the economies, social structures, and political stability of entire societies”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/363/RBMInfosheet_10.htm |title=Roll Back Malaria Partnership: Economic costs of malaria |publisher=Rbm.who.int |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch6/page2.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=Unfpa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>

===For women===
Women and children are often put at a high risk of being infected by schiostosomiasis, which in turn puts them at a higher risk of acquiring HIV.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/> Since the mode of schiostosomiasis transmission is usually through contaminated water in streams and lakes, women and children who do their household chores by the water are more likely to acquire the disease. Activities that women and children often do around waterfront include washing clothes, collecting water, bathing, and swimming.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/><ref name=WHO04Schisto/> Women who have schiostosomiasis lesions are three times more likely to be infected with HIV.<ref name=Kjetland06>{{cite journal |author=Kjetland EF |title=Association between genital schistosomiasis and HIV in rural Zimbabwean women |journal=AIDS |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=593–600 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16470124 |doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000210614.45212.0a |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000210614.45212.0a |author-separator=, |author2=Ndhlovu PD |author3=Gomo E |display-authors=3 |last4=Mduluza |first4=Takafira |last5=Midzi |first5=Nicholas |last6=Gwanzura |first6=Lovemore |last7=Mason |first7=Peter R |last8=Sandvik |first8=Leiv |last9=Friis |first9=Henrik}}</ref>

Women also have a higher risk of HIV transmission through the use of medical equipment such as needles.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/> Because more women than men use health services, especially during pregnancy, they are more likely to come across unsterilized needles for injections.<ref name=Gisselquist03/><ref name=Kjetland06/> Although statistics estimate that unsterilized needles only account for 5 to 10 percent of primary HIV infections, studies show this mode of HIV transmission may be higher than reported.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Drucker E, Alcabes PG, Marx PA |title=The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9297 |pages=1989–92 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11747942 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06967-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(01)06967-7}}</ref> This increased risk of contracting HIV through non-sexual means has social consequences for women as well. Over half of the husbands of HIV-positive women in Africa tested HIV-negative.<ref name=Gisselquist07>{{cite journal |author=Gisselquist, David; Potterat, John J.; Salerno, Lilian |title=Injured and Insulted: Women in Africa Suffer from Incomplete Messages about HIV Risks |journal=Horn of Africa Journal of AIDS |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=15–8 |year=2007 |doi= |url=}}</ref> When HIV-positive women reveal their HIV status to their HIV-negative husbands, they are often accused of [[infidelity]] and face violence and abandonment from their family and community.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/><ref name=Gisselquist07/>

===Relating to human capabilities===
Malnutrition associated with HIV impacts people’s ability to provide for themselves and their dependents, thus limiting the [[capabilities approach|human capabilities]] of both themselves and their dependents.<ref name=Piwoz00/> HIV can negatively affect work output, which impacts the ability to generate income.<ref>Hsu, Jean W-C., Paul B. Pencharz, Dereck Macallan, and Andrew Tomkins. 2005 "Macronutrients and HIV/AIDS: A Review of Current Evidence." Presented April 2005 for the Consultation on Nutrition and HIV/AIDS in Africa: Evidence, lessons and recommendations for action.</ref> This is crucial in parts of Africa where [[farming]] is the primary occupation and obtaining food is dependent on the agricultural outcome. Without adequate [[food production]], malnutrition becomes more prevalent. Children are often collateral damage in the AIDS crisis. As dependents, they can be burdened by the illness and eventual death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. Studies have shown that orphaned children are more likely to display physical symptoms of malnutrition than children whose parents are both alive.<ref name=Piwoz00/>

==Public policy proposals==

There are a number of proposals for reducing the diseases of poverty and eliminating health disparities within and between countries.  The World Health Organization proposes closing the gaps by acting on social determinants.<ref name= commission/>   
Their first recommendation is to improve daily living conditions.  This area involves improving the lives of women and girls so that their children are born in healthy environments and placing an emphasis on early childhood health.  
Their second recommendation is to tackle the inequitable distribution of money, power and resources.  This would involve building stronger public sectors and changing the way in which society is organized.  
Their third recommendation is to measure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action. This would involve training policy makers and healthcare practitioners to recognize problems and form policy solutions.<ref name= commission/>

===HIV/AIDS policy===
* Nutrition Supplements: Focusing on reversing the pattern of malnutrition in sub-Saharan African and other poor countries is a one possible way of decreasing susceptibility to HIV infections. Micronutrients such as iron and vitamin A can be delivered and provided at a very low cost. For example, vitamin A supplements cost $0.02 per capsule if provided twice a year. Iron supplements per child cost $0.02 if provided weekly or $0.08 if provided daily.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/>
* Eliminating Cofactors: Tackling the very diseases that increase risk of HIV infections can help slow down the rates of HIV transmission. Cofactors such as malaria and parasitic infections can be combated in an effective and cost-efficient manner. For example, [[mosquito nets]] can be easily used to prevent malaria.<ref name=Stillwaggon08/> Parasites can be eliminated with medication that is cost-effective and easy to administer. Twice-yearly treatments range from $0.02 to $0.25 depending on the type of worm.<ref>World Bank.  2003. “School Deworming At a Glance.” http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTHEALTHNUTRITIONANDPOPULATION/EXTPHAAG/0,,contentMDK:20785786~menuPK:1314819~pagePK:64229817~piPK:64229743~theSitePK:672263,00.html#PDFl (accessed March 2011).</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Montresor A |title=Extending anthelminthic coverage to non-enrolled school-age children using a simple and low-cost method |journal=Trop.
