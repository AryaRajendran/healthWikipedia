An '''influenza pandemic''' is an epidemic of an [[influenza]] virus that spreads on a worldwide scale and infects a large proportion of the [[human population]]. In contrast to the regular seasonal epidemics of influenza, these pandemics occur irregularly, with the 1918 [[Spanish flu]] the most serious pandemic in recent history. Pandemics can cause high levels of mortality, with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic estimated as being responsible for the deaths of approximately 50&nbsp;million people or more.  There have been about three influenza pandemics in each century for the last 300 years.  The most recent one was the [[2009 flu pandemic]].<ref>

Influenza pandemics occur when a new strain of the influenza virus is transmitted to humans from another animal species. Species that are thought to be important in the emergence of new human strains are pigs, chickens and ducks. These novel strains are unaffected by any immunity people may have to older strains of human influenza and can therefore spread extremely rapidly and infect very large numbers of people. [[Influenza A virus]]es can occasionally be transmitted from wild birds to other species causing outbreaks in domestic poultry and may give rise to human influenza pandemics.<ref name=sobrino6>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir|author=Klenk et al.|year=2008|chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range|title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/avir isbn=978-1-904455-22-6]}}</ref><ref name=Kawaoka>{{cite book | author=Kawaoka Y (editor). | title = Influenza Virology: Current Topics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | year = 2006 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/flu  ] | isbn = 1-904455-06-9}}</ref>   The propagation of influenza viruses throughout the world is thought in part to be by bird migrations, though commercial shipments of live bird products might also be implicated, as well as human travel patterns.  

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has produced a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ Current WHO phase of pandemic alert] ''World Health Organization'' 2009</ref>{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}

One strain of virus that may produce a pandemic in the future is a highly [[pathogen]]ic variation of the [[H5N1]] subtype of [[influenza A virus]]. On 11 June 2009, a new strain of [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|H1N1]] influenza was declared to be a global pandemic (Stage 6) by the WHO after evidence of spreading in the southern hemisphere.<ref>World Health Organization.

Influenza, commonly known as flu, is an [[infectious disease]] of birds and [[mammal]]s caused by an [[RNA virus]] of the [[biological family|family]] [[Orthomyxoviridae]] (the influenza viruses). In humans, common symptoms of influenza infection are fever, sore throat, [[myalgia|muscle pains]], severe headache, coughing, and [[malaise|weakness and fatigue]].<ref name=Merck>{{cite web |author=Merck Manual Home Edition |title=Influenza: Viral Infections |url= http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec17/ch198/ch198c.html}}</ref> In more serious cases, influenza [[sequela|causes]] [[pneumonia]], which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly.

Typically, influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating [[particulate|aerosols]] containing the virus, and from infected birds through their [[feces|droppings]].  Influenza can also be transmitted by [[saliva]], [[mucus|nasal secretions]], feces and blood.  Healthy individuals can become infected if they breathe in a virus-laden aerosol directly, or if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching any of the aforementioned bodily fluids (or surfaces contaminated with those fluids). Flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature, over 30 days at 0 °C (32 °F), and indefinitely at very low temperatures (such as lakes in northeast [[Siberia]]). Most influenza strains can be inactivated easily by [[disinfectant]]s and [[detergent]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Suarez | first = DL | coauthors = Spackman E, Senne DA, Bulaga L, Welsch AC, Froberg K | title = The effect of various disinfectants on detection of avian influenza virus by real time RT-PCR | journal=[[Avian Diseases]] | volume = 47 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 1091–5 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14575118 | doi = 10.1637/0005-2086-47.s3.1091 | ref = harv}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html  Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)]: Implications for Human Disease.

Flu spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics. Three influenza [[pandemics]] occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new [[strain (biology)|strain]] of the virus in humans. Often, these new strains result from the spread of an existing flu virus to humans from other animal [[species]]. When it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s, a deadly avian strain of H5N1 posed a great risk for a new influenza pandemic; however, this virus did not [[mutation|mutate]] to spread easily between people.<ref>{{cite web | title=Avian influenza ("bird flu") fact sheet | url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/ | month=February | year=2006 | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | accessdate=20 October 2006}}</ref>

==Variants and subtypes of Influenzavirus A==
{{Main|Influenzavirus A}}
Variants of [[Influenzavirus A]] are identified and named according to the isolate that they are like and thus are presumed to share lineage (example [[Fujian flu]] virus like); according to their typical host (example [[Human flu]] virus); according to their subtype (example [[H3N2]]); and according to their deadliness (example LP). So a flu from a virus similar to the  isolate A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) is called Fujian flu, human flu, and H3N2 flu.

[[File:Influenza subtypes.svg|thumb|right|375px|The various types of [[influenza]] viruses in humans. Solid squares show the appearance of a new strain, causing recurring influenza pandemics. Broken lines indicate uncertain strain identifications.<ref name=Palese>{{cite journal |author=Palese P |title=Influenza: old and new threats |journal=[[Nature Medicine]] |volume=10 |issue=12 Suppl |pages=S82–7 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15577936 |doi=10.1038/nm1141 |ref=harv}}</ref>]]

Variants are sometimes named according to the species (host) the strain is endemic in or adapted to. Some variants named using this convention are:<ref>See the articles for references that use these names.</ref>
* [[Avian influenza|Bird Flu]]
* [[Human flu|Human Flu]]
* [[Swine flu|Swine Flu]]
* [[Horse flu|Horse Flu]]
* [[Dog flu|Dog Flu]]

Avian variants have also sometimes been named according to their deadliness in poultry, especially chickens:
* Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI)
* Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), also called: deadly flu or death flu

The Influenza A virus subtypes are labeled according to an H number (for [[hemagglutinin]]) and an N number (for [[neuraminidase]]). Each subtype virus has [[mutate]]d into a variety of strains with differing [[pathogenic]] profiles; some pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Most known strains are extinct strains. For example, the annual flu subtype H3N2 no longer contains the strain that caused the [[Hong Kong Flu]].<ref name=Harder>{{cite book

==Nature of a flu pandemic==
Some pandemics are relatively minor such as [[H2N2|the one in 1957 called "Asian flu"]] (1 – 4&nbsp;million dead, depending on source).

</ref> There were not enough doctors, hospital rooms, or medical supplies for the living as they contacted the disease. Dead bodies were  often left unburied as few people were available to deal with them. There can be great social disruption as well as a sense of fear. Efforts to deal with pandemics can leave a great deal to be desired because of human selfishness, lack of trust, illegal behavior, and ignorance. For example in the 1918 pandemic: "This horrific disconnect between reassurances and reality destroyed the credibility of those in authority. People felt they had no one to turn to, no one to rely on, no one to trust."<ref>{{cite book

We have been averaging about 100 deaths per day [...]. Pneumonia means in about all cases death [...]. We have lost an outrageous number of Nurses and Drs.

===Variable mortality===
Mortality varies widely in a pandemic. In the 1918 pandemic:

:In U.S. Army camps where reasonably reliable statistics were kept, case mortality often exceeded 5 percent, and in some circumstances exceeded 10 percent. In the British Army in India, case mortality for white troops was 9.6 percent, for Indian troops 21.9 percent. In isolated human populations, the virus killed at even higher rates. In the Fiji islands, it killed 14 percent of the entire population in 16 days. In Labrador and Alaska, it killed at least one-third of the entire native population.<ref>{{cite book

===Russian Flu (1977–1978)===
In 1977, a strain of H1N1 appeared. It was a "benign" pandemic, primarily affecting people born after 1950, because the older generation had protective immunity resulting from prior experience with H1N1 strains. The 1977 virus was similar to other A/H1N1 viruses that had circulated prior to 1957. The virus was included in the 1978–79 vaccine.

HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease. There is no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission or of [[airborne transmission]] of HPAI A(H5N1) to humans. In almost all cases, those infected with H5N1 had extensive physical contact with infected birds. Still, around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the current Asian strain of HPAI A(H5N1) have died from it, and H5N1 may [[mutation|mutate]] or [[reassortment|reassort]] into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission.<ref name=ECDPC>"Avian influenza strains are those well adapted to birds"[http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:72mkmIQKbIQJ:www.ecdc.eu.int/documents/AF050930/AF3_13_Actions_taked_in_connection_with_Avian_Flu.doc+%22Avian+influenza%22+%22adapted+to+birds%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=3 EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL].{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref><ref name=influenzareport>[http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/ai.htm Chapter Two : Avian Influenza by Timm C.

H5N1 is just one of the many subtypes of the species [[Influenza A virus]]. Any one of them can combine with each other or with different variant genotypes within its own subtype creating new variants, any one of which could become a pandemic strain. We know enough about the genetics to know what strains to fear most (example: only H5 and H7 subtypes are "highly pathogenic") and we know what genetic factors make a flu virus a human virus (i.e. easily passed human to human); so we know H5N1 is the biggest pandemic threat of all the strains in circulation and we know it is only a few [[antigenic shift]] mutations or [[antigenic drift]] mutations from being an avian influenza virus to being a [[human flu]] virus. If it does this it may or may not still be in the H5N1 subtype. Both the drift and the shift can happen in any infected animal and then be passed to a human and spread like wildfire. Possible shift scenarios include the shift occurring in humans, pigs, or cats. To acquire the needed mutation through drift, it simply has to continue being an epidemic in birds long enough for the mutations to occur and then be passed to a human.

==Other pandemic threat subtypes==
"Human influenza virus" usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. H1N1, [[H1N2]], and H3N2 are the only known Influenza A virus subtypes currently circulating among humans.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/facts.htm CDC] ''Key Facts About Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) and Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus''</ref>

Genetic factors in distinguishing between "[[human flu]] viruses" and "avian influenza viruses" include:
:'''PB2''': ([[RNA polymerase]]): [[Amino acid]] (or [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]) position 627 in the PB2 protein encoded by the PB2 [[RNA]] gene. Until [[H5N1]], all known avian influenza viruses had a [[Glutamic acid|Glu]] at position 627, while all human influenza viruses had a [[lysine]].
:'''HA''': ([[hemagglutinin]]): Avian influenza HA bind alpha 2–3 [[sialic acid]] receptors while human influenza HA bind alpha 2–6 sialic acid receptors.

"About 52 key genetic changes distinguish avian influenza strains from those that spread easily among people, according to researchers in Taiwan, who analyzed the genes of more than 400 A type flu viruses."<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=a6S3ZQwqZkS4&refer=latin_america Bloomberg News] article '' Scientists Move Closer to Understanding Flu Virus Evolution'' published 28 August 2006</ref> "How many mutations would make an avian virus capable of infecting humans efficiently, or how many mutations would render an influenza virus a pandemic strain, is difficult to predict. We have examined sequences from the 1918 strain, which is the only pandemic influenza virus that could be entirely derived from avian strains. Of the 52 species-associated positions, 16 have residues typical for human strains; the others remained as avian signatures. The result supports the hypothesis that the 1918 pandemic virus is more closely related to the avian influenza A virus than are other human influenza viruses."<ref>

;H7N7
{{Main|H7N7}}
[[H7N7]] has unusual zoonotic potential. In 2003 in Netherlands 89 people were confirmed to have H7N7 influenza virus infection following an outbreak in poultry on several farms. One death was recorded.

;H1N2
{{Main|H1N2}}
[[H1N2]] is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. The new [[H1N2]] strain appears to have resulted from the reassortment of the genes of the currently circulating influenza H1N1 and [[H3N2]] subtypes. The [[hemagglutinin]] protein of the [[H1N2]] virus is similar to that of the currently circulating H1N1 viruses and the [[neuraminidase]] protein is similar to that of the current [[H3N2]] viruses.

If influenza remains an animal problem with limited human-to-human transmission it is not a pandemic, though it continues to pose a risk. To prevent the situation from progressing to a pandemic, the following short-term strategies have been put forward:
* Culling and [[Vaccination|vaccinating]] livestock
* Vaccinating poultry workers against common flu
* Limiting travel in areas where the virus is found<ref name="The Threat of Global Pandemics"/>

The rationale for vaccinating poultry workers against common flu is that it reduces the probability of common influenza virus recombining with avian H5N1 virus to form a pandemic strain. Longer term strategies proposed for regions where highly pathogenic H5N1 is endemic in wild birds have included:
*changing local farming practices to increase farm hygiene and reduce contact between livestock and wild birds.
*altering farming practices in regions where animals live in close, often unsanitary quarters with people, and changing the practices of open-air "[[wet markets]]" where birds are kept for live sale and slaughtered on-site. A challenge to implementing these measures is widespread poverty, frequently in rural areas, coupled with a reliance upon raising fowl for purposes of [[subsistence farming]] or income without measures to prevent propagation of the disease.
*changing local shopping practices from purchase of live fowl to purchase of slaughtered, pre-packaged fowl.
*improving veterinary [[vaccine]] availability and cost.<ref name="The Threat of Global Pandemics"/>

===Vaccines===
A [[vaccine]] probably would not be available in the initial stages of population infection.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/pandemics.htm CDC]</ref> A vaccine cannot be developed to protect against a virus which does not exist yet. The Avian Flu virus H5N1 has the potential to mutate into a pandemic strain, but so do other types of flu virus. Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.<ref>World Health Organization. Pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing process and timeline. http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_vaccine_20090806/en/.</ref>

The capability to produce vaccines varies widely from country to country; in fact, only 19 countries are listed as "influenza vaccine manufacturers" according to the World Health Organization.<ref>{{cite web

  | url = http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/manulist/en/index.html
  | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> It is estimated that, in a best scenario situation, 750&nbsp;million doses could be produced each year, whereas it is likely that each individual would need two doses of the vaccine to become immuno-competent. Distribution to and inside countries would probably be problematic.<ref>{{cite web

  | publisher=Phacilitate
  | url = http://www.phacilitate.co.uk/pages/phaciliate/article_fedson.html
  | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}</ref> Several countries, however, have well-developed plans for producing large quantities of vaccine. For example, Canadian health authorities say that they are developing the capacity to produce 32&nbsp;million doses within four months, enough vaccine to inoculate every person in the country.<ref>{{cite news

Another concern is whether countries which do not manufacture vaccines themselves, including those where a pandemic strain is likely to originate, will be able to purchase vaccine to protect their population. Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access to vaccines produced with those samples. So far, it has not received those assurances.<ref>{{cite web

U.S. to offer 10 pct of H1N1 vaccine internationally. 17 September 2009. http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE58G4MW20090917?feedType=RSS&feedName=healthNews.</ref><ref>France to donate swine flu vaccines to WHO: presidency. 17 September 2009. http://www.france24.com/en/20090917-france-donate-swine-flu-vaccines-who-presidency.</ref>

There are two serious technical problems associated with the development of a vaccine against H5N1. The first problem is this: seasonal influenza vaccines require a single injection of 15 μg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90&nbsp;µg H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people {{Harv|Treanor|2006}}. Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900&nbsp;million doses at a strength of 15 μg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 μg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70&nbsp;million {{Harv|Poland|2006}}.  Trials using [[adjuvant]]s such as [[alum]], [[AS03]], [[AS04]] or [[MF59]] to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed.  The second problem is this: there are two circulating [[clade]]s of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.

Since 2009, most vaccine development efforts have been focused on the current pandemic influenza virus H1N1. As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials are have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines.<ref>World Health Organization. Tables on the Clinical trials of pandemic influenza prototype vaccines. July 2009. http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/immunogenicity/immunogenicity_table.xls.</ref> In September 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, and expect the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month.<ref>US Food & Drug Administration.

===Anti-viral drugs===

There are two groups of antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as [[Oseltamivir]] (trade name Tamiflu)and [[Zanamivir]] (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as amantadine and rimantadine. Due to the high rate of side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pandemic Influenza: Use of Antiviral Agents|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/biofacts/panflu_antiviral.html|publisher=Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP)}}</ref> 

Many nations, as well as the World Health Organization, are working to stockpile [[anti-viral drug]]s in preparation for a possible pandemic. [[Oseltamivir]] is the most commonly sought drug, since it is available in pill form.  [[Zanamivir]] is also considered for use, but it must be inhaled. Other anti-viral drugs are less likely to be effective against pandemic influenza.

Both Tamiflu and Relenza are in short supply, and production capabilities are limited in the medium term. Some doctors say that co-administration of Tamiflu with [[probenecid]] could double supplies.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7064/full/438006a.html Wartime tactic doubles power of scarce bird-flu drug] Nature 438, 6. 3 November 2005. {{doi|10.1038/438006a}}</ref>

There also is the potential of viruses to evolve drug resistance. Some H5N1-infected persons treated with oseltamivir have developed resistant strains of that virus.

Tamiflu was originally discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]] and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing.

===Public response measures===
* '''Social distancing:''' By traveling less, working from home or closing schools, there is less opportunity for the virus to spread. Reduce the time spent in crowded settings if possible. And keep your distance (preferably at least 1 metre) from people who show symptoms of influenza-like illness, such as coughing and sneezing.<ref name="WHO-What-can-I-do">{{cite web

* '''Respiratory hygiene:''' Advise people to cover their coughs and sneezes. If using a tissue, make sure you dispose of it carefully and then clean your hands immediately afterwards. (See "Handwashing Hygiene" below.) If you do not have a tissue handy when you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth as much as possible with the crook of your elbow.<ref name="WHO-What-can-I-do" />

* '''Other hygiene:''' Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth as much as possible.<ref name="WHO-What-can-I-do" />
* '''[[Surgical mask|Masks]]:''' No mask can provide a perfect barrier but products that meet or exceed the [[NIOSH]] N95 standard recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] are thought to provide good protection. [[WHO]] recommends that health-care workers wear N95 masks and that patients wear surgical masks (which may prevent respiratory secretions from becoming airborne).<ref name="non-pharm-interven">{{cite web

This can reduce infection due to contact with contaminated surfaces, especially in crowded public places where coughing or sneezing people have no way of washing their hands.  The mask itself can become contaminated and must be handled as medical waste when removed.

* '''Risk communication:''' To encourage the public to comply with strategies to reduce the spread of disease, "communications regarding possible community interventions [such as requiring sick people to stay home from work, closing schools] for pandemic influenza that flow from the federal government to communities and from community leaders to the public not overstate the level of confidence or certainty in the effectiveness of these measures."<ref>{{cite book

<!--from [[File:WHO_Pandemic_Influenza_Phases_(2009).png|thumb|310px|[[World Health Organization|WHO]] Pandemic Influenza Phases (2009)]]-->
The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a global influenza preparedness plan, which defines the stages of a pandemic, outlines WHO's role and makes recommendations for national measures before and during a pandemic.<ref>The [[World Health Organization]] announces the current phase of the pandemic alert [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html here].{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}

See "Assessing the pandemic threat" at [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/en/]. The WHO published a first edition of the Global Influenza Preparedness Plan in 1999, and updated it in April 2005 and 2009.[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html].{{Dead link|date=March 2013}} See [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/pandemic/en/index.html]{{Dead link|date=March 2013}} and [http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_CSR_EDC_99_1/en/] which define the responsibilities of the WHO and national authorities in case of an influenza pandemic. This is the first time a pandemic has been anticipated and is being prepared for.

The aims of such plans are, broadly speaking, the following:

* Before a pandemic, attempt to prevent it and prepare for it in case prevention fails.
* If a pandemic does occur, to slow its spread and allow societies to function as normally as possible.
</ref>

In the 2009 revision of the phase descriptions, the WHO has retained the use of a six-phase approach for easy incorporation of new recommendations and approaches into existing national preparedness and response plans. The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them easier to understand, more precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1–3 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4–6 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.

The phases are defined below.<ref>{{cite news| title=Current WHO phase of pandemic alert| url =http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/|publisher=WHO}}</ref>

In nature, influenza viruses circulate continuously among animals, especially birds. Even though such viruses might theoretically develop into pandemic viruses, in '''Phase 1''' no viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.

In '''Phase 2''' an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.

In '''Phase 3''', an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.

'''Phase 4''' is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause "community-level outbreaks". The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with the WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a foregone conclusion.

'''Phase 5''' is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.

'''Phase 6''', the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5. Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way.

During the '''post-peak period''', pandemic disease levels in most countries with adequate surveillance will have dropped below peak observed levels. The post-peak period signifies that pandemic activity appears to be decreasing; however, it is uncertain if additional waves will occur and countries will need to be prepared for a second wave.

Previous pandemics have been characterized by waves of activity spread over months. Once the level of disease activity drops, a critical communications task will be to balance this information with the possibility of another wave. Pandemic waves can be separated by months and an immediate "at-ease" signal may be premature.

In the '''post-pandemic period''', influenza disease activity will have returned to levels normally seen for seasonal influenza. It is expected that the pandemic virus will behave as a seasonal influenza A virus. At this stage, it is important to maintain surveillance and update pandemic preparedness and response plans accordingly. An intensive phase of recovery and evaluation may be required.

==Government preparations for a potential H5N1 pandemic (2003–2009)==

On 27 October 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $62.5&nbsp;million contract to [[Chiron Corporation]] to manufacture an avian influenza vaccine designed to protect against the H5N1 influenza virus strain.  This followed a previous awarded $100&nbsp;million contract to [[sanofi pasteur]], the vaccines business of the [[sanofi-aventis]] Group, for avian flu vaccine.

In October 2005, President Bush urged bird flu vaccine manufacturers to increase their production.<ref>{{cite news

The [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] follows the [[World Health Organization|WHO's]] categories, but has expanded them.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cpip-pclcpi/index-eng.php | publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada | title = The Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector}}</ref>  The Avian Flu scare of 2006 prompted The Canadian Public Health Agency to release an updated Pandemic Influenza Plan for Health Officials.  This document was created to address the growing concern over the hazards faced by public health officials when exposed to sick or dying patients.

===Malaysia===
Since the [[Henipavirus|Nipah]] virus outbreak in 1999, the [[Healthcare in Malaysia|Malaysian Health Ministry]] have put in place processes to be better prepared to protect the Malaysian population from the threat of infectious diseases. Malaysia was fully prepared during the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)]] situation (Malaysia was not a SARS affected country) and the episode of the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 (bird flu)]] outbreak in 2004.

The [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian government]] has developed a [http://www.moh.gov.my/MohPortal/DownloadServlet?id=2873&type=2 National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan (NIPPP)] which serves as a time bound guide for preparedness and response plan for influenza pandemic. It provides a policy and strategic framework for a multisectoral response and contains specific advice and actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Health at the different levels, other governmental departments and agencies and non governmental organizations to ensure that resources are mobilized and used most efficiently before, during and after a pandemic episode.
