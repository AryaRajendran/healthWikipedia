The diagnostic category '''pervasive developmental disorders''' ('''PDD'''), as opposed to [[specific developmental disorder]]s (SDD), refers to a group of five [[mental illness|disorder]]s characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including [[socialization]] and [[communication]]. The pervasive developmental disorders are:<ref name="NICHCY">[[National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities]] (NICHCY) (October 2003) ''[http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs20txt.htm Disability Info: Pervasive Developmental Disorders (FS20).]'' Fact Sheet 20 (FS20)</ref>

Parents may note symptoms of PDD as early as infancy and typically onset is prior to three years of age. PDD itself does not affect [[life expectancy]].

There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD.<ref name="NICHCY"/> Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS.<ref name="NICHCY"/> Others use the general category label of PDD because they are hesitant to diagnose very young children with a specific type of PDD, such as autism.<ref name="NICHCY"/>  Both approaches contribute to confusion about the term, because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label.<ref name="NICHCY"/>

==PDD and PDD-NOS==
There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD.<ref name="NICHCY"/> Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS.<ref name="NICHCY"/> Others use the general category label of PDD because they are hesitant to diagnose very young children with a specific type of PDD, such as autism.<ref name="NICHCY"/>  Both approaches contribute to confusion about the term, because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label.<ref name="NICHCY"/>

PDD is not itself a diagnosis, while PDD-NOS is a diagnosis. To further complicate the issue, PDD-NOS can also be referred to as "atypical personality development", "atypical PDD", or "atypical Autism".

Because of the "NOS", which means "not otherwise specified", it is hard to describe what PDD-NOS is, other than its being an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some people diagnosed with PDD-NOS are close to having Asperger syndrome, but do not quite fit. Others have near full fledged autism, but without some of its symptoms. The psychology field is considering creating several subclasses within PDD-NOS.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of PDD may include communication problems such as:
* Difficulty using and understanding language
* Difficulty relating to people, objects, and events; for example, lack of eye contact, pointing behavior, and lack of facial responses
* Unusual play with toys and other objects
* Difficulty with changes in routine or familiar surroundings
* [[Stereotypy|Repetitive body movements]] or behavior patterns, such as hand flapping, hair twirling, foot tapping, or more complex movements
* Unable to cuddle or be comforted

==Degrees==
Children with PDD vary widely in abilities, intelligence, and behaviors. Some children do not speak at all, others speak in limited phrases or conversations, and some have relatively normal language development. Repetitive play skills and limited social skills are generally evident as well. Unusual responses to sensory information &ndash; loud noises, lights &ndash; are also common.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually done during early childhood. Some clinicians use PDD-NOS as a "temporary" diagnosis for children under the age of five when, for whatever reason, they are reluctant to diagnose autism. There are several justifications for this. Very young children have limited social interaction and communication skills to begin with, so it can be tricky to diagnose milder cases of autism in toddlers. The unspoken assumption is that by the age of five, unusual behaviors will either resolve or develop into diagnosable autism. However, some parents view the PDD label as no more than a euphemism for [[autism spectrum]] disorders, problematic because this label makes it more difficult to receive aid for [[early childhood intervention]].

==Care==
Medications are used to address certain behavioral problems; therapy for children with PDD should be specialized according to the child's specific needs.
Some children with PDD benefit from specialized classrooms in which the class size is small and instruction is given on a one-to-one basis. Others function well in standard special education classes or regular classes with support. Early intervention, including appropriate and specialized educational programs and support services, play a critical role in improving the outcome of individuals with PDD.
