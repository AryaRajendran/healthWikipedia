A '''subconjunctival hemorrhage''' (or '''subconjunctival haemorrhage''') also known as '''hyposphagma''', is bleeding underneath the [[conjunctiva]]. The conjunctiva contains many small, fragile [[blood vessels]] that are easily ruptured or broken. When this happens, blood leaks into the space between the conjunctiva and [[sclera]].

Such a hemorrhage may be caused by a sudden or severe sneeze or cough, or due to [[hypertension]] or as a [[side effect]] of [[blood thinner]]s.<ref name=NIH>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002583/|work=PubMed Health on the [[National Institutes of Health]] website|title=Subconjunctival hemorrhage|date=May 1, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref>  It may also be caused by heavy lifting, [[vomiting]], or even rubbing one's eyes too roughly.<ref name=FTD>{{cite web|url=http://fittodo.com/Fun-Healthy-Living/Health-And-Wellness/Medical--Diseases-A-Z/Broken-blood-vessel-in-eye-(See--Subconjunctival-hemorrhage).aspx |work=Fit To Do website|title=Subconjunctival hemorrhage |date=May 1, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Disease>{{cite web|url=http://disease.disease.com/Signs/Subconjunctival-Hemorrhage.html |work=Disease.com|title=Subconjunctival hemorrhage |date=n.d.|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref>  In other cases, it may be due to extreme [[flatulence]], from being choked, or from straining due to [[constipation]]. Also, it can result as a minor post-operative complication in eye surgeries such as [[LASIK]].

Whereas a [[bruise]] typically appears black or blue underneath the [[human skin|skin]], a subconjunctival hemorrhage initially appears bright-red underneath the transparent conjunctiva. Later, the hemorrhage may spread and become green or yellow, like a bruise. Usually this disappears within 2 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic270.htm |title=Subconjunctival Hemorrhage |author=Robert H.

Although its appearance may be alarming, in general a subconjunctival hemorrhage is a painless and harmless condition; however, it may be associated with [[high blood pressure]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to the [[human eye|eye]], or a base of skull fracture if there is no posterior border of the hemorrhage visible.

==Causes==
*[[Eye trauma]]
*Congenital or acquired ([[coagulopathy|coagulation disorder]])
*[[Diving hazards and precautions#Effects of barotrauma or pressure damage|Diving accidents]] - Mask squeeze (volume inside in mask creates increased pressure with increased depth)
*Head injury
*[[Whooping cough]] or other extreme sneezing or coughing <ref name=NIH /> <ref name=FTD />
*Severe [[hypertension]]
*[[LASIK]]
*Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (caused by [[Enterovirus]] 70 or [[Coxsackie A virus]])
*[[Leptospirosis]]
*Increased venous pressure (e.g., extreme [[g-force]], [[Valsalva maneuver|straining]], [[vomiting]], [[choking]], or [[coughing]]) <ref name=NIH /> <ref name=FTD /> <ref name=Disease />

==Management==
A subconjunctival hemorrhage is typically a self-limiting condition that requires no treatment in the absence of infection or significant trauma. The elective use of [[aspirin]] and [[NSAID]]s is typically discouraged. Artificial tears may be applied four to six times a day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic270.htm |title=Subconjunctival Hemorrhage |author=Robert H.
