'''Diarrhea''' (AmE) (or '''diarrhoea''') (BrE) (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[Wiktionary:διάρροια|διάρροια]]}}, δια ''dia'' "through" + ρέω ''rheo'' "flow" meaning "flowing through"<ref>{{cite journal |author=medterms dictionary |title=Definition of Diarrhea |journal=Medterms.com |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2985}}</ref>) is the condition of having three or more loose or liquid [[bowel movement]]s per day.<ref name=WHO2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/diarrhoea/en/ |title=Diarrhoea |work=World Health Organization }}</ref> The most common cause is [[gastroenteritis]].

[[Oral rehydration therapy|Oral rehydration solutions (ORS)]] with modest amounts of salts and [[Zinc deficiency|zinc tablets]] are the treatment of choice and have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years.<ref name=WHO2010a/> In cases where ORS is not available, homemade solutions are often used.

It is a common cause of death in [[Developing country|developing countries]] and the second most common cause of [[Infant mortality|infant deaths]] worldwide.  The loss of [[body fluid|fluids]] through diarrhea can cause [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte disturbance]]s such as [[Hypokalemia|potassium deficiency]] or other salt imbalances. In 2009 diarrhea was estimated to have caused 1.1 million deaths in people aged 5 and over<ref>[http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Tech%2Band%2BScience/Story/STIStory_448440.html Straits Times:Diarrhoea kills 3 times more]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> and 1.5 million deaths in children under the age of 5.<ref name=WHO2010a>{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598415_eng.pdf |title=whqlibdoc.who.int |format=PDF |work=[[World Health Organization]] }}</ref>

==Definition==
[[Image:Bristol stool chart.svg|thumb|Types 5-7 on the [[Bristol Stool Scale|Bristol Stool Chart]] indicate diarrhea]]
Diarrhea is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as having three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or as having more stools than is normal for that person.<ref name=WHO2010/>

===Secretory===
Secretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion, or there is an inhibition of absorption. There is little to no structural damage. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a [[cholera toxin]] that stimulates the secretion of [[anion]]s, especially [[chloride]] ions. Therefore, to maintain a charge balance in the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], sodium is carried with it, along with water. In this type of diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion is isotonic with plasma even during fasting.<ref name="webmd.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea |title=The Basics of Diarrhea |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref> It continues even when there is no oral food intake.

===Osmotic===
Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt, these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005>{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title = The Treatment Of Diarrhea, A manual for physicians and other senior health workers|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|version = Sometimes needs to be downloaded twice.  See “4.2 Treatment Plan A: home therapy to prevent dehydration and malnutrition,” “4.3 Treatment Plan B: oral rehydration therapy for children with some dehydration,” and “4.4 Treatment Plan C: for patients with severe dehydration” on pages 8 to 16 (12 -20 in PDF).  See also “8. MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHOEA WITH SEVERE MALNUTRITION” on pages 22-24 (26-30 in PDF) and “ANNEX 2: ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS REHYDRATION SOLUTIONS” on pages 33-37 (37-41 in PDF).|year = 2005}}</ref> Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or [[Coeliac disease]]), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic [[laxatives]] (which work to alleviate [[constipation]] by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much [[magnesium]] or [[vitamin C]] or undigested [[lactose]] can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has [[lactose intolerance]] can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have [[fructose malabsorption]], excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea.<ref name="webmd.com"/> In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped.

=== Exudative ===
Exudative diarrhea occurs with the presence of blood and pus in the stool. This occurs with [[inflammatory bowel diseases]], such as [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]], and other severe infections such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' or other forms of food poisoning.<ref name="webmd.com"/>

=== Motility-related ===
[[Motility]]-related diarrhea is caused by the rapid movement of food through the intestines (hypermotility). If the food moves too quickly through the [[gastrointestinal]] tract, there is not enough time for sufficient nutrients and water to be absorbed. This can be due to a [[vagotomy]] or [[diabetic neuropathy]], or a complication of [[menstruation]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. [[Hyperthyroidism]] can produce hypermotility and lead to [[pseudodiarrhea]] and occasionally real diarrhea. Diarrhea can be treated with antimotility agents (such as [[loperamide]]). Hypermotility can be observed in people who have had portions of their bowel removed, allowing less total time for absorption of nutrients.

===Inflammatory===
Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea can be found in this type of diarrhea. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Dysentery===
Generally, if there is blood visible in the stools, it is not diarrhea, but [[dysentery]]. The blood is trace of an invasion of bowel tissue. Dysentery is a symptom of, among others, ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', and ''[[Salmonella]]''.

==Differential diagnosis==
[[File:Stomach colon rectum diagram.svg|right|thumb|Diagram of the human [[gastrointestinal tract]].]]

Diarrhea is most commonly due to viral [[gastroenteritis]] with [[rotavirus]], which accounts for 40% of cases in children under five.<ref name=WHO2010a/> (p.&nbsp;17)  In [[traveler's diarrhea|travelers]] however [[bacterial infections]] predominate.<ref name="pmid16267716"/> Various toxins such as [[Amanita phalloides#Symptoms|mushroom poisoning]] and drugs can also cause acute diarrhea.

Chronic diarrhea can be the part of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[microscopic colitis]], [[celiac disease]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and [[bile acid malabsorption]].

===Infections===

===Malabsorption===
{{Main|Malabsorption}}
[[Malabsorption]] is the inability to absorb food fully, mostly from disorders in the small bowel, but also due to maldigestion from diseases of the [[pancreas]].

Causes include:
* ''enzyme deficiencies or mucosal abnormality'', as in [[food allergy]] and [[food intolerance]], e.g. [[celiac disease]] (gluten intolerance), [[lactose intolerance]] (intolerance to milk sugar, common in non-Europeans), and [[fructose malabsorption]].
* ''[[pernicious anemia]]'', or impaired bowel function due to the inability to absorb [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]],
* ''loss of pancreatic secretions'', which may be due to [[cystic fibrosis]] or [[pancreatitis]],
* ''structural defects'', like [[short bowel syndrome]] (surgically removed bowel) and radiation fibrosis, such as usually follows cancer treatment and other drugs, including agents used in [[chemotherapy]]; and
* ''certain drugs'', like [[orlistat]], which inhibits the absorption of fat.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
{{Main|Inflammatory bowel disease}}
The two overlapping types here are of unknown origin:
* [[Ulcerative colitis]] is marked by chronic bloody diarrhea and inflammation mostly affects the distal [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] near the [[rectum]].
* [[Crohn's disease]] typically affects fairly well demarcated segments of bowel in the colon and often affects the end of the small bowel.

===Irritable bowel syndrome===
{{Main|Irritable bowel syndrome}}
Another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool (diarrhea or [[constipation]]) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Longstreth GF, Thompson WG, Chey WD, Houghton LA, Mearin F, Spiller RC |title=Functional bowel disorders |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=1480–91 |year=2006 |pmid=16678561 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.11.061 }}</ref>  Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed through a combination of dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements, and/or medications such as [[loperamide]] or [[codeine]]. About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have [[bile acid malabsorption]] diagnosed with an abnormal [[SeHCAT]] test.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wedlake|first=L|coauthors=A'Hern, R, Russell, D, Thomas, K, Walters, JR, Andreyev, HJ|title=Systematic review: the prevalence of idiopathic bile acid malabsorption as diagnosed by SeHCAT scanning in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome|journal=Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics|year=2009|volume=30|issue=7|pages=707–17|pmid=19570102|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04081.x}}</ref>

===Other causes===
*Diarrhea can be caused by chronic [[ethanol]] ingestion.<ref name=Harrison>Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL. [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]]. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. ISBN 0-07-139140-1.</ref>
*[[Ischemia|Ischemic]] bowel disease. This usually affects older people and can be due to blocked arteries.
*[[Microscopic colitis]], a type of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] where changes are only seen on histological examination of colonic biopsies.
*[[Bile salt malabsorption]] ([[primary bile acid diarrhea]]) where excessive [[bile acids]] in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] produce a secretory diarrhea.
*Hormone-secreting tumors: some hormones (e.g., [[serotonin]]) can cause diarrhea if excreted in excess (usually from a tumor).
*Chronic mild diarrhea in infants and toddlers may occur with no obvious cause and with no other ill effects; this condition is called [[toddler's diarrhea]].

==Pathophysiology==

===Evolution===
According to two researchers, [[Randolph M. Nesse|Nesse]] and [[George C. Williams|Williams]], diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism. As a result, if it is stopped, there might be a delay in recovery.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, George; Nesse, Randolph M. |title=Why we get sick: the new science of Darwinian medicine |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=36–38 |isbn=0-679-74674-9 }}</ref> They cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 which found that treating ''Shigella'' with the anti-diarrhea drug (Co-phenotrope, [[Lomotil]]) caused people to stay [[fever]]ish twice as long as those not so treated. The researchers indeed themselves observed that: "Lomotil may be contraindicated in shigellosis. Diarrhea may represent a defense mechanism".<ref>{{cite journal |author=DuPont HL, Hornick RB |title=Adverse effect of lomotil therapy in shigellosis |journal=JAMA |volume=226 |issue=13 |pages=1525–8 |year=1973 |month=December |pmid=4587313 |doi= 10.1001/jama.226.13.1525}}</ref>

==Diagnostic approach==
The following types of diarrhea may indicate further investigation is needed:

*In infants
*Moderate or severe diarrhea in young children
*Associated with blood
*Continues for more than two days
*Associated non-cramping [[abdominal pain]], [[fever]], [[weight loss]], etc.
*In [[Traveler's diarrhea|travelers]]
*In food handlers, because of the potential to infect others;
*In institutions such as hospitals, child care centers, or geriatric and convalescent homes.

A severity score is used to aid diagnosis in children.<ref name="pmid2371542">{{cite journal |author=Ruuska T, Vesikari T |title=Rotavirus disease in Finnish children: use of numerical scores for clinical severity of diarrhoeal episodes |journal=Scand.

==Prevention==
A [[rotavirus vaccine]] decrease the rates of diarrhea in a population.<ref name=WHO2010a/> New vaccines against rotavirus, ''Shigella'', ETEC, and cholera are under development, as well as other causes of infectious diarrhea.

[[Probiotics]] decrease the risk of diarrhea in those taking [[antibiotics]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hempel|first=S|coauthors=Newberry, SJ, Maher, AR, Wang, Z, Miles, JN, Shanman, R, Johnsen, B, Shekelle, PG|title=Probiotics for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2012 May 9|volume=307|issue=18|pages=1959–69|pmid=22570464|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.3507}}</ref> In institutions and in communities, interventions that promote hand washing lead to significant reductions in the incidence of diarrhea.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ejemot RI, Ehiri JE, Meremikwu MM, Critchley JA |title=Hand washing for preventing diarrhoea |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD004265 |year=2008 |pmid=18254044 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004265.pub2 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004265/frame.html |editor1-last=Ejemot |editor1-first=Regina I}}</ref>

==Management==
In many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth &ndash; [[oral rehydration therapy]] &ndash; or, in severe cases, [[intravenously]].<ref name=WHO2010a/>  Diet restrictions such as the [[BRAT diet]] are no longer recommended.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King CK, Glass R, Bresee JS, Duggan C |title=Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=52 |issue=RR–16 |pages=1–16 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14627948 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5216a1.htm}}</ref> Research does not support the limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1728 |title=BestBets: Does Withholding milk feeds reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children with acute gastroenteritis? }}</ref>  To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain and that continuing to eat speeds also recovery of normal intestinal functioning.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>  CDC recommends that children and adults with cholera also continue to eat.<ref name = CDCmanualCholera/>

Medications such as [[loperamide]] (Imodium) and [[bismuth subsalicylate]] may be beneficial; however they may be [[contraindicated]] in certain situations.<ref name="pmid18192963">{{cite journal |author=Schiller LR |title=Management of diarrhea in clinical practice: strategies for primary care physicians |journal=Rev Gastroenterol Disord |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=S27–38 |volume=7 |year=2007 |pmid=18192963 }}</ref>

===Fluids===
{{See also|Management of dehydration}}
[[Image:Cholera rehydration nurses.jpg|thumb| A person consuming oral rehydration solution.]] 
[[Oral rehydration therapy|Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)]] can be used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given.  Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter.  Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> There are commercial solutions such as [[Pedialyte]], and relief agencies such as [[UNICEF]] widely distribute packets of salts and sugar.  A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> (approximately the "taste of tears"<ref name=2010WorldCupTravellersGuide>[http://www.who.int/topics/test/food_safety/safe_food_travel.pdf A GUIDE ON SAFE FOOD FOR TRAVELLERS], WELCOME TO SOUTH AFRICA, HOST TO THE 2010 FIFA WORLD CUP (bottom left of page 1).</ref>).  Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness.<ref name=RehydrationProject>Rehydration Project, http://rehydrate.org/ Homemade Oral Rehydration Solution Recipe.</ref>  Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/><ref name=RehydrationProject/>

Appropriate amounts of supplemental zinc and potassium should be added if available.  But the availability of these should not delay rehydration.  As WHO points out, the most important thing is to begin preventing dehydration as early as possible.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>  In another example of prompt ORS hopefully preventing dehydration, CDC recommends for the treatment of cholera continuing to give Oral Rehydration Solution during travel to medical treatment.<ref name = CDCmanualCholera>[http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf Community Health Worker Training Materials for Cholera Prevention and Control], CDC, slides at back are dated 11/17/2010. Page 7 states " . . . Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently."</ref>

Vomiting often occurs during the first hour or two of treatment with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration since most of the fluid is still absorbed.  WHO recommends that if a child vomits, to wait five or ten minutes and then start to give the solution again more slowly.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>

Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as [[soft drinks]] and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may ''increase'' dehydration.  A too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water.<ref name=NICE2009>{{cite web|title=Management of acute diarrhoea and vomiting due to gastoenteritis in children under 5|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG84|work=National Institute of Clinical Excellence|month=April|year=2009}}</ref><ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>  Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable.<ref name=NICE2009/> Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, which the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>  A [[nasogastric tube]] can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.<ref name=Webb2005>{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=A|coauthors=Starr, M|title=Acute gastroenteritis in children.|journal=Australian family physician|date=2005 Apr|volume=34|issue=4|pages=227–31|pmid=15861741}}</ref>

===Eating===
WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed.  Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function.  In contrast, children whose food is restricted, have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly.  A child should also continue to be breastfed.  A 2005 WHO manual for physicians and other senior health workers is quite emphatic regarding this point:  "Food should ''never'' be withheld and the child's usual foods should ''not'' be diluted. Breastfeeding should ''always'' be continued."<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>  And in the specific example of cholera, CDC also makes the same recommendation.<ref name = CDCmanualCholera/>

===Medications===
While [[antibiotic]]s are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhea, they are usually not used except in specific situations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dryden MS, Gabb RJ, Wright SK |title=Empirical treatment of severe acute community-acquired gastroenteritis with ciprofloxacin |journal=Clin.

Anti motility agents like [[loperamide]] are effective at reducing the duration of diarrhea.<ref name=CE08/> [[Codeine]] is used in the treatment of diarrhea to slow down [[peristalsis]] and the passage of fecal material through the bowels - this means that more time is given for water to reabsorb back into the body, which gives a firmer stool, and also means that feces is passed less frequently.<ref name="codeinephos1">{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100000565.html|title=Codeine phosphate tablets|publisher=netdoctor.co.uk|accessdate=5 July 2010|location=London}}</ref>

[[Bile acid sequestrants]] such as [[cholestyramine]] can be effective in chronic diarrhea due to [[bile acid malabsorption]]. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as [[SeHCAT]] retention.

===Alternative therapies===
Zinc supplementation benefits children suffering from diarrhea in developing countries, but only in infants over six months old. This supports the World Health Organisation guidelines for zinc, but not in the very young.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lazzerini M, Ronfani L |title=Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3|pages=CD005436 |year=2008 |pmid=18646129 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005436.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005436/frame.html |editor1-last=Lazzerini |editor1-first=Marzia}}</ref>

World wide in 2004 approximately 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea occurred which results in 1.5 million deaths among children under the age of five.<ref name=WHO2010a/>  Greater than half of these were in Africa and South Asia.<ref name=WHO2010a/>  This is down from a death rate of 5 million per year two decades ago.<ref name=WHO2010a/>  Diarrhea remains the second leading cause of [[infant mortality]] (16%) after [[pneumonia]] (17%) in this age group.<ref name=WHO2010a/>
