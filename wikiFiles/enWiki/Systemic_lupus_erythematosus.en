'''Systemic lupus erythematosus''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Systemic lupus erythematosus pronunciation.ogg|s|ɪ|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|m|ɪ|k|_|ˈ|l|u:|p|ə|s|_|ˌ|ɛr|ɪ|θ|i:|m|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ə|s}}),   often abbreviated to '''SLE''' or '''lupus''', is a [[systemic autoimmune disease]] (or [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] [[connective tissue disease]]) that can affect any part of the body. As occurs in other autoimmune diseases, the [[immune system]] attacks the body's cells and tissue, resulting in [[inflammation]] and tissue damage.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref> It is a [[Type III hypersensitivity]] reaction in which antibody-immune complexes precipitate and cause a further immune response.

SLE most often harms the [[heart]], [[joint]]s, [[skin]], [[lung]]s, [[blood vessel]]s, [[liver]], [[kidney]]s, and [[Nervous system#Vertebrates|nervous system]]. The course of the disease is unpredictable, with periods of illness (called ''flares'') alternating with [[remission (medicine)|remission]]s. The disease occurs nine times more often in women than in men, especially in women in child-bearing years ages 15 to 35, and is also more common in those of non-European descent.<ref name="rahman"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lupus.org/education/stats.html#1 |title=LUPUS FOUNDATION OF AMERICA |accessdate=2007-07-04 |work=}}</ref><ref name=HarrisonsOnline/>

There is no cure for SLE. It is treated with immunosuppression, mainly with [[cyclophosphamide]], [[corticosteroid]]s and other [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressants]]. SLE can be fatal. The leading cause of death is from cardiovascular diseases acquired from corticosteroid therapy. Survival for people with SLE in the United States, Canada, and Europe has risen to approximately 95% [[five-year survival rate|at five years]], 90% at 10 years, and 78% at 20 years,<ref name=HarrisonsOnline>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=2859070 |title=Harrison's Internal Medicine, 17th ed. Chapter 313. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus |publisher=Accessmedicine.com |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> and now approaches that of matched controls without lupus. 

Childhood systemic lupus erythematosus generally presents between the ages of 3 and 15, with girls outnumbering boys 4:1, and typical skin manifestations being butterfly eruption on the face and [[Photosensitivity in humans|photosensitivity]].<ref name="Andrews"/>

Lupus is Latin for wolf. In the 18th century, when lupus was just starting to be recognized as a disease, it was thought that it was caused by the bite of a wolf.<ref name="pmid6348430">{{cite journal |author=Blotzer JW |title=Systemic lupus erythematosus I: historical aspects. |journal=Md State Med J |volume= 32|issue= 6|pages= 439–41|year=1983 |month=June |pmid=6348430}}</ref> This may have been because of the distinctive rash characteristic of lupus. (Once full-blown, the round, disk-shaped rashes heal from the inside out, leaving a bite-like imprint.)

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of SLE.png|thumb|Common symptoms of SLE.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus/page2.htm#3whatcauses MedicineNet: Systemic Lupus (cont.)] Last Editorial Review: 2009-01-30</ref>]]

SLE is one of several diseases known as "[[the great imitator]]s" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://healthcare.utah.edu/healthtools/articles/lupus.html|title=Lupus, "The Great Imitator"|publisher=University Health Care|accessdate=2009-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> SLE is a classical item in [[differential diagnosis]],<ref name="rahman"/> because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people suffering unexplained symptoms of untreated SLE for years.

Common initial and chronic complaints include [[fever]], [[malaise]], [[arthralgia|joint pains]], [[myalgia]]s, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and temporary loss of cognitive abilities. Because they are so often seen with other diseases, these signs and symptoms are not part of the diagnostic criteria for SLE. When occurring in conjunction with other signs and symptoms (see below), however, they are considered suggestive.<ref name=mayo_lupussymptoms>{{cite web|title=Lupus: Symptoms — MayoClinic.com|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/lupus/DS00115/DSECTION=symptoms|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>

===Dermatological===
[[Image:Vacuolar interface dermatitis - high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing [[vacuolar interface dermatitis]], as may be seen in SLE. [[H&E stain]].]]
As many as 30%{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} of sufferers have some dermatological symptoms (and 65%{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}{{inconsistent}} suffer such symptoms at some point), with 30% to 50%{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}{{inconsistent}} suffering from the classic [[malar rash]] (or ''[[malar rash|butterfly rash]]'') associated with the disease. Some may exhibit thick, red scaly patches on the skin (referred to as [[Discoid lupus erythematosus|discoid lupus]]). [[Alopecia]]; [[Mouth ulcer|mouth]], nasal, [[urinary tract]] and [[Genital ulcer|vaginal]] ulcers, and lesions on the skin are also possible manifestations. Tiny tears in delicate tissue around the eyes can occur after even minimal rubbing.

===Musculoskeletal===
The most commonly sought medical attention is for [[joint pain]], with the small joints of the hand and wrist usually affected, although all joints are at risk. The [[Lupus Foundation of America]] estimates more than 90 percent of those affected will experience joint and/or muscle pain at some time during the course of their illness.<ref name="lfa1">[http://www.lupus.org/webmodules/webarticlesnet/templates/new_aboutaffects.aspx?articleid=99&zoneid=17 Joint and Muscle Pain] Lupus Foundation of America</ref> Unlike [[rheumatoid arthritis]], lupus arthritis is less disabling and usually does not cause severe destruction of the joints. Fewer than ten percent of people with lupus arthritis will develop deformities of the hands and feet.<ref name="lfa1"/> SLE patients are at particular risk of developing osteoarticular [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="pmid19246552">{{cite journal |author=Hodkinson B, Musenge E, Tikly M |title=Osteoarticular tuberculosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=[[QJM]] |volume= 102|issue= 5|pages= 321–8|year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19246552 |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcp015 |url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19246552}}</ref>

A possible association between [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and SLE has been suggested,<ref name="pmid19248111">{{cite journal |author=Hemminki K, Li X, Sundquist J, Sundquist K |title=Familial associations of rheumatoid arthritis with autoimmune diseases and related conditions |journal=[[Arthritis Rheum.]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=661–8 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19248111 |doi=10.1002/art.24328}}</ref> and SLE may be associated with an increased risk of [[bone fracture]]s in relatively young women.<ref name="pmid19224131">{{cite journal |author=Mendoza-Pinto C, García-Carrasco M, Sandoval-Cruz H, ''et al.'' |title=Risk factors of vertebral fractures in women with systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=Clin.

===Hematological===
[[Anemia]] may develop in up to 50%{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} of cases. Low [[platelet]] and [[white blood cell]] counts may be due to the disease or a side effect of pharmacological treatment. People with SLE may have an association with [[Antiphospholipid syndrome|antiphospholipid antibody syndrome]]<ref name="pmid19224124">{{cite journal |author=Syuto T, Shimizu A, Takeuchi Y, ''et al.'' |title=Association of antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=Clin.

Abnormalities associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome include a paradoxical prolonged [[partial thromboplastin time]] (which usually occurs in hemorrhagic disorders) and a positive test for antiphospholipid antibodies; the combination of such findings have earned the term "[[lupus anticoagulant]]-positive".  Another autoantibody finding in SLE is the [[anticardiolipin antibody]], which can cause a false positive test for [[syphilis]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Cardiac===
A person with SLE may have inflammation of various parts of the [[heart]], such as [[pericarditis]], [[myocarditis]], and [[endocarditis]]. The endocarditis of SLE is characteristically noninfective ([[Libman-Sacks endocarditis]]), and involves either the [[mitral valve]] or the [[tricuspid valve]]. [[Atherosclerosis]] also tends to occur more often and advances more rapidly than in the general population.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Yu Asanuma, M.D., Ph.D., Annette Oeser, B.S., Ayumi K.

===Pulmonary===
Lung and pleura inflammation can cause [[Pleurisy|pleuritis]], [[pleural effusion]], lupus pneumonitis, chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease, [[pulmonary hypertension]], [[Pulmonary embolism|pulmonary emboli]], [[pulmonary hemorrhage]], and shrinking lung syndrome.

===Renal===
Painless [[hematuria]] or [[proteinuria]] may often be the only presenting renal symptom. Acute or chronic renal impairment may develop with [[lupus nephritis]], leading to acute or end-stage [[renal failure]]. Because of early recognition and management of SLE, end-stage renal failure occurs in less than 5%{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} of cases.

A histological hallmark of SLE is membranous [[glomerulonephritis]] with "wire loop" abnormalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://erl.pathology.iupui.edu/C603/GENE607.HTM |title=General Pathology Images for Immunopathology |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>  This finding is due to immune complex deposition along the [[glomerular basement membrane]], leading to a typical granular appearance in [[immunofluorescence]] testing.

===Neuropsychiatric===
[[Neuropsychiatry|Neuropsychiatric]] syndromes can result when SLE affects the [[central nervous system|central]] or [[peripheral nervous system]]s. The [[American College of Rheumatology]] defines 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus.<ref name="pmid10211873">{{cite journal |title=The American College of Rheumatology nomenclature and case definitions for neuropsychiatric lupus syndromes |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=599–608 |year=1999 |month=April |pmid=10211873 |doi=10.1002/1529-0131(199904)42:4<599::AID-ANR2>3.0.CO;2-F }}</ref> The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric syndromes concurrent with SLE is one of the most difficult challenges in medicine, because it can involve so many different patterns of symptoms, some of which may be mistaken for signs of infectious disease or stroke.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neuwelt CM and Young RG |title=Managing neuropsychiatric lupus: Top 10 clinical pearls  |journal=The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=April 2, 2009 |url=http://jmm.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145622/1396901}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>

===Systemic===
[[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]] in SLE is probably multifactorial and has been related to not only disease activity or complications such as [[anemia]] or [[hypothyroidism]], but also to [[pain]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], poor [[sleep]] quality, poor [[physical fitness]] and lack of [[social support]].<ref name="pmid16613963">{{cite journal |author=D'Cruz DP |title=Systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7546 |pages=890–4 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16613963 |pmc=1440614 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7546.890 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16142863">{{cite journal |author=Jump RL, Robinson ME, Armstrong AE, Barnes EV, Kilbourn KM, Richards HB |title=Fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus: contributions of disease activity, pain, depression, and perceived social support |journal=J.

==Causes==
There is no one specific cause of SLE.  There are, however, a number of environmental triggers and a number of genetic susceptibilities.<ref name="cruzlancet"/><ref name="pmid19262576">{{cite journal |author=Kanta H, Mohan C |title=Three checkpoints in lupus development: central tolerance in adaptive immunity, peripheral amplification by innate immunity and end-organ inflammation |journal=Genes Immun. |volume= 10|issue= 5|pages= 390–6|year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19262576 |doi=10.1038/gene.2009.6}}</ref>

===Genetics===
The first mechanism may arise genetically. Research indicates SLE may have a [[genetics|genetic]] link.  SLE does run in families, but no single causal gene has been identified. Instead, multiple genes appear to influence a person's chance of developing lupus when triggered by environmental factors. The most important genes are located in the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] region on [[Chromosome 6 (human)|chromosome 6]], where mutations may occur randomly (''de novo'') or may be inherited. HLA class I, class II, and class III are associated with SLE, but only classes I and II contribute independently to increased [[risk]] of SLE.<ref name="pmid19255932">{{cite journal |author=Martens HA, Nolte IM, van der Steege G, ''et al.'' |title=An extensive screen of the HLA region reveals an independent association of HLA class I and class II with susceptibility for systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=Scand.

===Environmental triggers===
The second mechanism may be due to environmental factors. These factors may not only exacerbate existing SLE conditions, but also trigger the initial onset.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Researchers have sought to find a connection between certain infectious agents ([[virus]]es and [[bacteria]]), but no pathogen can be consistently linked to the disease. Some researchers have found that women with [[silicone]] gel-filled [[breast implant]]s have produced antibodies to their own [[collagen]], but it is not known how often these antibodies occur in the general population, and there are no data that show these antibodies cause [[connective tissue disease]]s such as SLE.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Drug reactions===
[[Drug-induced lupus erythematosus]] is a (generally) reversible condition that usually occurs in people being treated for a long-term illness. Drug-induced lupus mimics SLE. However, symptoms of drug-induced lupus generally disappear once the medication that triggered the episode is stopped. More than 38 medications can cause this condition, the most common of which are [[procainamide]], [[isoniazid]], [[hydralazine]], [[quinidine]], and [[phenytoin]].<ref name="rahman"/>

===Non-SLE forms of lupus===
Discoid (cutaneous) lupus is limited to skin symptoms and is diagnosed by biopsy of rash on the face, neck, scalp or arms. Approximately 5% of patients with DLE progress to SLE.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Pathophysiology==
One manifestation of SLE is abnormalities in [[apoptosis]], a type of programmed cell death in which aging or damaged cells are neatly disposed of as a part of normal growth or functioning.

===Transmission===
In SLE, the body's immune system produces antibodies against itself, particularly against [[Sm protein|proteins in the cell nucleus]]. SLE is triggered by environmental factors that are unknown.

In order to preserve homeostasis, the immune system must balance between being sensitive enough to protect against infection, and becoming sensitized to  attack the body's own proteins (autoimmunity). During an immune reaction to a foreign stimulus, such as bacteria, virus, or allergen, immune cells that would normally be deactivated due to their affinity for self tissues can be abnormally activated by signaling sequences of [[antigen-presenting cells]]. Thus triggers may include viruses, bacteria, allergens (both [[IgE]] and [[hypersensitivity]]), and can be aggravated by environmental stimulants such as ultraviolet light and certain drug reactions. These stimuli begin a reaction that leads to [[apoptosis|destruction]] of other cells in the body and exposure of their DNA, [[histones]], and other proteins, particularly parts of the cell nucleus. The body's sensitized [[B-lymphocyte]] cells will now produce antibodies against these nuclear-related proteins. These antibodies clump into antibody-protein complexes which stick to surfaces and damage blood vessels in critical areas of the body, such as the [[glomeruli]] of the kidney; these antibody attacks are the cause of SLE.

===Abnormalities in cell death signaling===
*Apoptosis is increased in [[monocyte]]s and [[keratinocyte]]s
*[[Gene expression|Expression]] of [[FAS ligand|Fas]] by [[B cell]]s and [[T cell]]s is increased
*There are correlations between the apoptotic rates of lymphocytes and disease activity.
*Necrosis in increased in T lymphocytes.

[[Tingible body macrophage]]s (TBMs)&nbsp;– large phagocytic cells in the [[germinal center]]s of secondary [[lymph node]]s&nbsp;– express CD68 protein. These cells normally engulf B cells that have undergone apoptosis after [[somatic hypermutation]]. In some people with SLE, significantly fewer TBMs can be found, and these cells rarely contain material from apoptotic B cells. Also, uningested apoptotic nuclei can be found outside of TBMs. This material may present a threat to the tolerization of B cells and T cells. [[Dendritic cell]]s in the germinal center may endocytose such antigenic material and present it to T cells, activating them. Also, apoptotic chromatin and nuclei may attach to the surfaces of [[follicular dendritic cell]]s and make this material available for activating other B cells that may have randomly acquired self-specificity through [[somatic hypermutation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaipl US, Kuhn A, Sheriff A, ''et al.'' |title=Clearance of apoptotic cells in human SLE |journal=Curr.

===Clearance deficiency===
[[File:Picture1 englisch.jpg|thumb|Clearance deficiency]] Impaired clearance of dying cells is a potential pathway for the development of this systemic [[autoimmune disease]]. This includes deficient phagocytic activity and scant serum components in addition to increased [[apoptosis]].

[[Monocytes]] isolated from [[whole blood]] of SLE sufferers show reduced expression of CD44 surface molecules involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells. Most of the monocytes and tingible body macrophages (TBMs), which are found in the [[germinal centre]]s of [[lymph nodes]], even show a definitely different morphology; they are smaller or scarce and die earlier. Serum components like [[Complement system|complement]] factors, [[C-reactive protein|CRP]], and some [[glycoproteins]] are, furthermore, decisively important for an efficiently operating phagocytosis. With SLE, these components are often missing, diminished, or inefficient.

Recent research has found an association between certain lupus patients (especially those with [[lupus nephritis]]) and an impairment in degrading [[neutrophil extracellular traps]] (NETs). These were due to [[Deoxyribonuclease I|DNAse1]] inhibiting factors, or NET protecting factors in patient serum, rather than abnormalities in the DNAse1 itself.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hakkim A, Fürnrohr BG, Amann K, ''et al.'' |title=Impairment of neutrophil extracellular trap degradation is associated with lupus nephritis |journal=Proc.

The clearance of early apoptotic cells is an important function in multicellular organisms. It leads to a progression of the apoptosis process and finally to secondary [[necrosis]] of the cells if this ability is disturbed. Necrotic cells release nuclear fragments as potential [[autoantigens]], as well as internal danger signals, inducing maturation of [[dendritic cells]] (DCs), since they have lost their membranes' integrity. Increased appearance of apoptotic cells also simulates inefficient clearance. That leads to maturation of DCs and also to the presentation of intracellular antigens of late apoptotic or secondary necrotic cells, via MHC molecules.
[[Autoimmunity]] possibly results by the extended exposure to nuclear and intracellular autoantigens derived from late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells. B and [[T cell]] tolerance for apoptotic cells is abrogated, and the [[lymphocytes]] get activated by these autoantigens; [[inflammation]] and the production of autoantibodies by [[plasma cells]] is initiated. A clearance deficiency in the skin for apoptotic cells has also been observed in people with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaipl US, Munoz LE, Grossmayer G, ''et al.'' |title=Clearance deficiency and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) |journal=J. Autoimmun. |volume=28 |issue=2–3 |pages=114–21 |year=2007 |pmid=17368845 |doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2007.02.005 }}</ref>
[[File:Picture2 englisch.jpg|thumb|Germinal centres]]

===Accumulation in germinal centers===
In healthy conditions, apoptotic lymphocytes are removed in germinal centres by specialized phagocytes, the tingible body macrophages (TBM), which is why no free apoptotic and potential autoantigenic material can be seen. In some people with SLE, [[accumulation]] of apoptotic [[debris]] can be observed in GC because of an ineffective clearance of apoptotic cells. In close proximity to TBM, [[follicular dendritic cells]] (FDC) are localised in GC, which attach antigen material to their surface and, in contrast to [[bone marrow]]-derived DC, neither take it up nor present it via [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] molecules.

Autoreactive [[B cells]] can accidentally emerge during [[somatic hypermutation]] and migrate into the [[germinal center]] light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally do not receive survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells, and perish by apoptosis. In the case of clearance deficiency, apoptotic nuclear debris accumulates in the light zone of GC and gets attached to FDC. This serves as a germinal centre survival signal for autoreactive B-cells. After migration into the mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B memory cells. In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic [[autoimmune disease]] may be the consequence.

===Anti-nRNP autoimmunity===
[[Autoantibodies]] to [[nRNP A]] and [[nRNP C]] initially targeted restricted, [[proline]]-rich [[sequence motif|motifs]]. Antibody binding subsequently spread to other [[epitopes]]. The similarity and [[cross-reactivity]] between the initial targets of [[nRNP]] and [[Sm protein|Sm]] autoantibodies identifies a likely commonality in cause and a focal point for intermolecular epitope spreading.<ref name="pmid19248110">{{cite journal |author=Poole BD, Schneider RI, Guthridge JM, ''et al.'' |title=Early targets of nuclear RNP humoral autoimmunity in human systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=[[Arthritis Rheum.]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=848–859 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19248110 |doi=10.1002/art.24306 |pmc=2653589}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Lupus band test.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Microphotograph of a [[histology|histological section]] of human skin prepared for direct [[immunofluorescence]] using an anti-IgG antibody. The skin is from a person with systemic lupus erythematosus and shows IgG deposits at two different places: The first is a bandlike deposit along the epidermal [[basement membrane]] ("lupus band test" is positive); the second is within the nuclei of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] cells (antinuclear antibodies are present).]]

===Laboratory tests===
[[Antinuclear antibody]] (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen ([[anti-ENA]]) form the mainstay of [[Serology|serologic]] testing for SLE. Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. Clinically the most widely used method is indirect [[immunofluorescence]]. The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the patient's serum.

ANA screening yields positive results in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include [[LSm|anti-Smith]] and anti-double stranded [[DNA]] (dsDNA) antibodies (which are linked to SLE) and [[anti-histone antibodies]] (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE.<ref name="rahman"/> The anti-dsDNA antibody [[titer]]s also tend to reflect disease activity, although not in all cases.<ref name="rahman"/> Other ANA that may occur in SLE sufferers are [[U1 spliceosomal RNA|anti-U1 RNP]] (which also appears in [[systemic sclerosis]]), [[SS-A]] (or [[anti-Ro]]) and [[SS-B]] (or [[anti-La]]; both of which are more common in [[Sjögren's syndrome]]). SS-A and SS-B confer a specific risk for heart conduction block in neonatal lupus.<ref name="pmid14671725">{{cite journal |author=Buyon JP, Clancy RM |title=Maternal autoantibodies and congenital heart block: mediators, markers, and therapeutic approach |journal=Semin. Arthritis Rheum. |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=140–54 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14671725 |doi= 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2003.09.002|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049017203001598}}</ref>

Other tests routinely performed in suspected SLE are [[complement system]] levels (low levels suggest consumption by the immune system), [[electrolyte]]s and [[renal function]] (disturbed if the kidney is involved), [[Liver function test|liver enzyme]]s, and [[complete blood count]].

The lupus erythematosus (LE) cell test was commonly used for diagnosis, but it is no longer used because the [[LE cell]]s are only found in 50–75% of SLE cases, and they are also found in some people with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and drug sensitivities. Because of this, the LE cell test is now performed only rarely and is mostly of historical significance.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003635.htm NIM encyclopedic article on the LE cell test]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>

===Diagnostic criteria===
Some physicians make a diagnosis on the basis of the [[American College of Rheumatology]] (ACR) classification criteria. The criteria, however, were established mainly for use in scientific research including use in [[randomized controlled trial]]s which require higher confidence levels, so some people with SLE may not pass the full criteria.

====Criteria====
The American College of Rheumatology established eleven criteria in 1982,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rheumatology.org/publications/classification/index.asp?aud=mem |title=Article on the classification of rheumatic diseases |publisher=Rheumatology.org |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> which were revised in 1997<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rheumatology.org/publications/classification/SLE/1982SLEupdate.asp?aud=mem |title=Revision of Rheumatology.org's diagnostic criteria |publisher=Rheumatology.org |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> as a classificatory instrument to operationalise the definition of SLE in clinical trials. They were not intended to be used to diagnose individuals and do not do well in that capacity. For the purpose of identifying patients for clinical studies, a person has SLE if any 4 out of 11 symptoms are present simultaneously or serially on two separate occasions.

====Criteria for individual diagnosis====
Some people, especially those with [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], may have SLE without four of the above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria.<ref name="pmid12892393">{{cite journal |author=Asherson RA, Cervera R, de Groot PG, ''et al.'' |title=Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome: international consensus statement on classification criteria and treatment guidelines |journal=Lupus |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=530–4 |year=2003 |pmid=12892393 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0961-2033&volume=12&issue=7&spage=530&aulast=Asherson |doi=10.1191/0961203303lu394oa}}</ref><ref name="pmid15608315">{{cite journal |author=Sangle S, D'Cruz DP, Hughes GR |title=Livedo reticularis and pregnancy morbidity in patients negative for antiphospholipid antibodies |journal=Ann.

[[Recursive partitioning]] has been used to identify more parsimonious criteria.<ref name="pmid3060613">{{cite journal |author=Edworthy SM, Zatarain E, McShane DJ, Bloch DA |title=Analysis of the 1982 ARA lupus criteria data set by recursive partitioning methodology: new insights into the relative merit of individual criteria |journal=J.

# Full classification tree: Uses 6 criteria. It has sensitivity = 97% and specificity = 95%.

Other alternative criteria have been suggested, e.g. the St. Thomas' Hospital "alternative" criteria in 1998.<ref name="pmid9631744">{{cite journal |author=Hughes GR |title=Is it lupus?

==Prevention==
SLE cannot be prevented, but the consequences can be prevented.<ref name=niams>{{cite web |url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Lupus/default.asp |title=Handout on Health: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus |accessdate=2007-11-23 |month=August | year=2003 |work=The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}</ref>

As longevity of people with SLE increases, the likelihood of [[complication (medicine)|complication]]s also increases in four areas: [[cardiovascular disease]], [[infection]]s, [[osteoporosis]], and [[cancer]].  Standard preventive measures, screening for related diseases may be necessary to deal with the increased risks due to the side effects of medications.  Extra vigilance is considered warranted in particular for cancers affecting the immune system.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yazdany J|title=Strategies for preventive care in systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine| year = 2008  | url=http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/display/article/1145622/1404652 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
The treatment of SLE involves preventing flares and reducing their severity and duration when they occur.

Treatment can include [[corticosteroid]]s and anti-malarial drugs. Certain types of lupus nephritis such as diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis require bouts of cytotoxic drugs. These drugs include [[cyclophosphamide]] and [[mycophenolate]].

[[Hydroxychloroquine]] (HCQ) was approved by the FDA for lupus in 1955.<ref name=Vasudevan/> Some drugs approved for other diseases are used for SLE 'off-label'. In November 2010, an FDA advisory panel recommended approving [[belimumab]] (Benlysta) as a treatment for the pain and flare-ups common in lupus. The drug was approved by the FDA in March 2011.<ref name="Benlysta">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm246489.htm |title=FDA approves first new lupus drug in 56 years |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref><ref name="Vincent FB, Morand EF and Mackay F 2012 293–303">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/icb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/icb2011111a.html |author=Vincent FB, Morand EF and Mackay F |title=BAFF and innate immunity: new therapeutic targets for systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=Immunology and cell biology |year=2012 |doi=10.1038/icb.2011.111 |accessdate=10 January 2012|volume=90|issue=3|pages=293–303|pmid=22231653}}</ref> N-acetylcysteine has been shown to reverse depletion of the natural anti-oxidant glutathione and to safely improve disease activity in a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study.<ref title="N-acetylcysteine reduces disease activity by blocking mammalian target of rapamycin in T cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial".>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22549432|title=N-acetylcysteine reduces disease activity by blocking mammalian target of rapamycin in T cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. |author=Lai ZW, Hanczko R, Bonilla E, Caza TN, Clair B, Bartos A, Miklossy G, Jimah J, Doherty E, Tily H, Francis L, Garcia R, Dawood M, Yu J, Ramos I, Coman I, Faraone SV, Phillips PE, Perl A}}</ref>

===Medications===
Due to the variety of symptoms and organ system involvement with SLE, its severity in an individual must be assessed in order to successfully treat SLE. Mild or remittent disease may, sometimes, be safely left untreated. If required, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s and [[malaria|antimalarials]] may be used. Medications such as Prednisone, Cellcept and Prograf have been used in the past. A number of potential treatments are in clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v27/n9/fig_tab/nbt0909-779_T1.html |title=Table 1. Current lupus drugs in development |year=2009}}</ref>

====Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs====
[[Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s (DMARDs) are used preventively to reduce the incidence of flares, the process of the disease, and lower the need for steroid use; when flares occur, they are treated with [[corticosteroids]]. DMARDs commonly in use are antimalarials such as [[Plaquenil]] and [[immunosuppressants]] (e.g. [[methotrexate]] and [[azathioprine]]). [[Plaquenil]] ([[hydroxychloroquine]]) is an FDA-approved antimalarial used for constitutional, cutaneous, and articular manifestations. Hydroxychloroquine has relatively few side effects, and there is evidence that it improves survival among people who have SLE.<ref name="Vasudevan">{{cite journal |author=Vasudevan AR and Ginzler EM |title=Established and novel treatments for lupus|journal=The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine |volume=26 |issue=8 |date=August 4, 2009 |url=http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/lupus/article/1145622/1434518}}</ref>
[[Cyclophosphamide]] is used for severe [[glomerulonephritis]] or other organ-damaging complications. [[Mycophenolic acid]] is also used for treatment of lupus nephritis, but it is not FDA-approved for this indication, and FDA is investigating reports that it may be associated with birth defects when used by pregnant women.<ref>{{cite journal|title=FDA Alert: Mycophenolate Mofetil (marketed as CellCept) and Mycophenolic Acid (marketed as Myfortic)|date=May 16, 2008|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm124776.htm
}}</ref>

====Immunosuppressive drugs====
In more severe cases, medications that modulate the immune system (primarily corticosteroids and [[immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressants]]) are used to control the disease and prevent recurrence of symptoms (known as flares). Depending on the dosage, people who require steroids may develop [[Cushing's syndrome]], symptoms of which may include [[obesity]], puffy round face, [[diabetes mellitus]], increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and [[osteoporosis]]. These may subside if and when the large initial dosage is reduced, but long-term use of even low doses can cause elevated [[blood pressure]] and [[cataracts]].

Numerous new immunosuppressive drugs are being actively tested for SLE. Rather than suppressing the immune system nonspecifically, as corticosteroids do, they target the responses of individual [types of] immune cells. Some of these drugs are already FDA-approved for treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name=Vasudevan/>  See also [[Belimumab]] and [[Atacicept]].  [[Lupuzor]] has given encouraging results in a phase IIb trial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/171853.php |title=ImmuPharma Announces Final Results Of PhaseIIb Study Of LUPUZOR™ In Lupus |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>

====Analgesia====
Since a large percentage of people with SLE suffer from varying amounts of [[chronic pain]], stronger prescription [[analgesics]] (pain killers) may be used if over-the-counter drugs (mainly [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s) do not provide effective relief. Potent NSAIDs such as indomethacin and diclofenac are relatively contraindicated for patients with SLE because they increase the risk of kidney failure and heart failure.<ref name=Vasudevan/>

Moderate pain is typically treated with mild prescription opiates such as [[dextropropoxyphene]] and [[co-codamol]]. Moderate to severe chronic pain is treated with stronger opioids, such as [[hydrocodone]] or longer-acting continuous-release [[opioids]], such as [[oxycodone]], [[MS Contin]], or [[methadone]]. The [[fentanyl]] duragesic transdermal patch is also a widely used treatment option for the chronic pain caused by complications because of its long-acting timed release and ease of use. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and addiction may occur. Opiate addiction is not typically a concern, since the condition is not likely to ever completely disappear. Thus, lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen.

====Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIGs)====
[[Intravenous immunoglobulin]]s  may be used to control SLE with organ involvement, or [[vasculitis]]. It is believed that they reduce [[antibody]] production or promote the clearance of [[immune complex]]es from the body, even though their [[mechanism of action]] is not well-understood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Lupus/default.asp |title=Handout on Health: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> Unlike [[immunosuppressive]]s and [[corticosteroids]], [[IVIG]]s do not suppress the [[immune system]], so there is less risk of serious [[infection]]s with these drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theodora.com/lupus_central_station/intravenous_immunoglobulins_ivigs.html |title=Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIGs) in Lupus Central Station, sourced from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref>

===Lifestyle changes===
Avoiding sunlight is the primary change to the lifestyle of SLE sufferers, as sunlight is known to exacerbate the disease, as is the debilitating effect of intense fatigue. These two problems can lead to patients becoming housebound for long periods of time. Drugs unrelated to SLE should be prescribed only when known not to exacerbate the disease. Occupational exposure to [[silica]], [[pesticide]]s and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] can also make the disease worsen.<ref name="cruzlancet">{{cite journal | author = D'Cruz DP, Khamashta MA, Hughes GR | title = Systemic lupus erythematosus | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9561 | pages = 587–96 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17307106 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60279-7 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(07)60279-7| accessdate = 2009-02-01}}</ref>

===Renal transplantation===
Renal transplants are the treatment of choice for [[end-stage renal disease]], which is one of the complications of [[lupus nephritis]], but the recurrence of the full disease is common in up to 30% of patients.<ref name="pmid19247694">{{cite journal |author=Cochat P, Fargue S, Mestrallet G, ''et al.'' |title=Disease recurrence in paediatric renal transplantation |journal=Pediatr. Nephrol. |volume= 24|issue= 11|pages= 2097–108|year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19247694 |doi=10.1007/s00467-009-1137-6 |pmc=2753770}}</ref>

===Antiphospholipid syndrome===
[[Antiphospholipid syndrome]] is also related to the onset of neural lupus symptoms in the brain. In this form of the disease the cause is very different from lupus: thromboses (blood clots or "sticky blood") form in blood vessels, which prove to be fatal if they move within the blood stream.<ref name="pmid12892393"/> If the thromboses migrate to the brain, they can potentially cause a [[stroke]] by blocking the blood supply to the brain.

If this disorder is suspected in patients, brain scans are usually required for early detection. These scans can show localized areas of the brain where blood supply has not been adequate. The treatment plan for these patients requires anticoagulation. Often, low-dose [[aspirin]] is prescribed for this purpose, although for cases involving thrombosis anticoagulants such as [[warfarin]] are used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Danchenko N, Satia JA, Anthony MS |title=Epidemiology of systemic lupus erythematosus: a comparison of worldwide disease burden |journal=Lupus |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=308–18 |year=2006 |pmid=16761508 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0961-2033&volume=15&issue=5&spage=308&aulast=Danchenko |doi=10.1191/0961203306lu2305xx}}</ref>

===Management of pregnancy===
{{Further|Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy}}
While most infants born to mothers who have SLE are healthy, pregnant mothers with SLE should remain under medical care until delivery. [[Neonatal lupus]] is rare, but identification of mothers at highest risk for complications allows for prompt treatment before or after birth. In addition, SLE can flare up during pregnancy, and proper treatment can maintain the health of the mother longer. Women pregnant and known to have [[Anti-Ro antibodies|anti-Ro]] (SSA) or [[anti-La antibodies]] (SSB) often have echocardiograms during the 16th and 30th weeks of pregnancy to monitor the health of the heart and surrounding vasculature.<ref name=niams/>

[[Contraception]] and other reliable forms of pregnancy prevention is routinely advised for women with SLE, since getting pregnant during active disease was found to be harmful. [[Lupus nephritis]] was the most common manifestation.

==Prognosis==
SLE is [[incurable]], but [[treatable]].

In the 1950s, most people diagnosed with SLE lived fewer than five years. Today, over 90% now survive for more than ten years, and many live relatively asymptomatically. 80-90% can expect to live a normal lifespan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prognosis and a Hopeful Future|url=http://www.lupus.org/webmodules/webarticlesnet/templates/new_learnunderstanding.aspx?articleid=2238&zoneid=523|work=Lupus Foundation of America website|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>)

Prognosis is normally worse for men and children than for women; however, if symptoms are present after age 60, the disease tends to run a more benign course. Early mortality, within 5 years, is due to organ failure or overwhelming infections, both of which can be modified by early diagnosis and treatment. The mortality risk is fivefold when compared to the normal population in the late stages, which can be attributed to cardiovascular diseases acquired from corticosteroid therapy, the leading cause of death for people with SLE.<ref name=Vasudevan/>

To reduce potential for cardiovascular issues, high blood pressure and high cholesterol should be prevented or treated aggressively. Steroids should be used at the lowest dose for the shortest possible period, and other drugs that can reduce symptoms should be used whenever possible.<ref name=Vasudevan/> High serum creatinine, hypertension, [[nephrotic syndrome]], anemia and hypoalbuminemia are poor prognostic factors.<ref name="prognosis">{{cite web|url=http://pn.lifehugger.com/doc/302/sle-systemic-lupus-erythematosus |title=Poor prognostic factors,Sudheer, SLE document |publisher=Pn.lifehugger.com |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>

The ANA is the most sensitive screening test for evaluation, whereas [[LSm#History|anti-Sm (anti-Smith)]] is the most specific. The dsDNA (double-stranded [[DNA]]) antibody is also fairly specific and often fluctuates with disease activity; as such, the dsDNA titre is sometimes useful to monitor disease flares or response to treatment.<ref>EARLY STEROIDS MAY PREVENT RELAPSES IN LUPUS, P Jarman (Published in Journal Watch (General) July 18, 1995)</ref>

==Epidemiology==
The rate of SLE varies considerably between countries, ethnicity, gender, and changes over time.<ref name=Epi2006>{{cite journal |author=Danchenko N, Satia JA, Anthony MS |title=Epidemiology of systemic lupus erythematosus: a comparison of worldwide disease burden |journal=Lupus |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=308–18 |year=2006 |pmid=16761508 |doi= 10.1191/0961203306lu2305xx|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0961-2033&volume=15&issue=5&spage=308&aulast=Danchenko}}</ref> In the United States, one estimate of the [[prevalence]] of SLE is 53 per 100,000.;<ref name=Epi2006/> other estimates range from 322,000 to over 1 million.<ref name=CDC/> In Northern Europe the rate is about 40 per 100,000 people.<ref name=Rahman2008>{{cite journal |author=Rahman A, Isenberg DA |title=Systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=358 |issue=9 |pages=929–39 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18305268 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra071297 }}</ref> SLE occurs more frequently and with greater severity among those of non-European descent.<ref name=CDC>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/omhd/AMH/factsheets/lupus.htm |title=OMHD&#124;AMH&#124;Factsheets&#124;Lupus }}</ref> That rate has been found to be as high as 159 per 100,000 among those of Afro-Caribbean descent.<ref name=Epi2006/>

SLE, like many autoimmune diseases, affects females more frequently than males, at a rate of almost 9 to 1.<ref name=Epi2006/> This is due to the presence of two X chromosomes in the female as opposed to the one X chromosome present in males. The X chromosome carries immunological related genes, which can mutate and contribute to the onset of SLE. The Y chromosome has no identified mutations associated with autoimmune disease.<ref name=Tsokos>{{cite journal |author=Tsokos GC |title=Systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=365 |issue=22 |pages=2110–21 |year=2011 |month=December |pmid=22129255 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1100359}}</ref>

The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of SLE in the United States increased from 1.0 in 1955 to 7.6 in 1974. Whether the increase is due to better diagnosis or to increasing frequency of the disease is unknown.<ref name=Epi2006/>

==History and culture==

===Etymology===

There are several explanations ventured for the term '''lupus erythematosus'''.  Lupus is [[Latin]] for wolf,<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition in Dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lupus|publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> and "erythro" is derived from {{lang|grc|ερυθρός}}, Greek for "red."  All explanations originate with the reddish, butterfly-shaped [[malar rash]] that the disease classically exhibits across the nose and cheeks.
# In various accounts, some doctors thought the rash resembled the pattern of fur on a wolf's face.
# In other accounts, doctors thought that the rash, which was often more severe in earlier centuries, created lesions that resembled wolf bites or scratches.
# Another account claims that the term "lupus" did not come from Latin directly, but from the term for a French style of mask that women reportedly wore to conceal the rash on their faces. The mask is called a "loup," French for "wolf."

===History===
The history of SLE can be divided into three periods: classical, neoclassical, and modern. The classical period began when the disease was first recognized in the [[Middle Ages]] and saw the description of the dermatological manifestation of the disorder. The term ''lupus'' is attributed to 12th-century [[physician]] [[Rogerius (physician)|Rogerius]], who used it to describe the classic malar rash. The neoclassical period was heralded by [[Móric Kaposi]]'s recognition in 1872 of the systemic manifestations of the disease. The modern period began in 1948 with the discovery of the LE cell (the ''lupus erythematosus'' cell—a misnomer, as it occurs with other diseases as well) and is characterised by advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiology and clinical-laboratory features of the disease, as well as advances in treatment.<ref name="historyof">{{cite journal |author=Hochberg MC |title=The history of lupus erythematosus |journal=Md Med J |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=871–3 |year=1991 |month=October |pmid=1943516 }}</ref>

Medical historians have theorized that people with [[porphyria]] (a disease that shares many symptoms with SLE) generated folklore stories of vampires and werewolves, due to the photosensitivity, scarring, hair growth, and porphyrin brownish-red stained teeth in severe recessive forms of porphyria (or combinations of the disorder, known as dual, homozygous, or compound heterozygous porphyrias).<ref name="historyof"/>

Useful medication for the disease was first found in 1894, when [[quinine]] was first reported as an effective therapy. Four years later, the use of [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]]s in conjunction with quinine was noted to be of still greater benefit. This was the best available treatment until the middle of the twentieth century, when Hench discovered the efficacy of [[corticosteroid]]s in the treatment of SLE.<ref name="historyof"/>

==Research==
Since lupus is considered to be currently incurable, current research is being geared towards finding a possible cause, a cure, and more effective treatment plans to extend and increase the quality of life for lupus patients.

A study called BLISS-76 tested the drug, Belimumab (HGS1006, LymphoStat-B ), a fully human monoclonal anti-BAFF (or anti-BLyS) antibody.<ref name="Vincent FB, Morand EF and Mackay F 2012 293–303"/> stimulates and extends the life of B lymphocytes, which produce antibodies against foreign and self cells.<ref>[http://tarc.med.unc.edu/research_bliss76.php Bliss76 Study – UNC School of Medicine]. Retrieved 2009-11-30.</ref> The drug, branded Benlysta, was approved by the FDA in March 2011. Notwithstanding the approval, the FDA emphasized that the drug will not work in all cases, and that more research and advanced therapies are called for.<ref name=Benlysta/>
