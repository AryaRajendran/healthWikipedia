==Consultant, child trauma==
Perry has served as a consultant and [[expert witness]] on many high-profile incidents involving traumatized children, including the [[Columbine High School massacre]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], the [[Waco siege]], and the [[YFZ Ranch]] custody cases. His clinical research and practice focuses on examining the long-term effects of trauma in children, adolescents, and adults and has been instrumental in describing how traumatic events in childhood change the biology of the brain. He is the author of more than 200 journal articles, book chapters, and scientific proceedings and is the recipient of a variety of professional awards.  Perry's Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics is currently the working model used by [[Youthville]]'s Trauma Recovery Center in [[Wichita, Kansas]].<ref>[http://www.youthville.org/NeurosequentialModelofTherapeutics/Default.aspx Youthville’s Partnership with Dr. Bruce Perry]</ref>
