'''Medical gloves''' are disposable [[glove]]s used during medical examinations and procedures that help prevent contamination between caregivers and patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ppe/gloves.html |title=Medical Gloves and Gowns |accessdate=2010-03-10 |quote=Medical gloves are disposable gloves used during medical procedures. Medical gloves help prevent contamination between caregivers and patients. Some are designed to prevent contact with certain chemotherapy drugs. Medical gloves include examination gloves, surgical gloves, and medical gloves for handling chemotherapy agents (chemotherapy gloves). These gloves are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA makes sure that manufacturers of these devices meet performance criteria such as leak resistance, tear resistance, etc. |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] }}</ref>  Medical gloves are made of different polymers including [[latex]], [[nitrile rubber]], [[vinyl]] and [[neoprene]]; they come unpowdered, or powdered with [[cornstarch]] to lubricate the gloves, making them easier to put on the hands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ansell.eu/medical/index.cfm?page=manu_ppf_powder&lang=EN |title=Glove manufacturing |publisher=Ansell.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>  Cornstarch replaced tissue-irritating [[Lycopodium powder]] and talc, but since even cornstarch can impede healing if it gets into tissues (as during surgery), unpowdered gloves are being used more often during surgery and other sensitive procedures. Special manufacturing processes are used to compensate for the lack of powder. There are two main types of gloves: exam and surgical.  Surgical gloves have more precise sizing with a better precision and sensitivity and are made to a higher standard.

==History==
In 1890 [[William Stewart Halsted]] was the first to use sterilized medical gloves when he was at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Hopkins Ceases Use Of Latex Gloves During Surgery |url=http://wjz.com/local/johns.hopkins.hospital.2.629922.html |quote=A surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital is credited with being the first to introduce the rubber surgical glove back in 1894.  |work=[[WJZ-TV]] |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Rubber Gloves |url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/press_releases/2008/01_15_08.html  |quote=William Stewart Halsted, The Johns Hopkins Hospital’s first surgeon in chief, is credited as the first to develop and introduce rubber surgical gloves in the United States. That was in 1894, five years after the institution opened. |work=[[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] |date=January 14, 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-03 }}</ref> With the publication of [[germ theory]] Halsted was using [[carbolic acid]], introduced by [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], to sterilize his hands and his nurse's hands. She was sensitive to the chemical, and it was damaging the skin on her hands; so he asked the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] if they could make a glove of rubber that could be dipped in carbolic acid.

The first disposable latex medical gloves were manufactured in 1964 by [[Ansell Limited|Ansell]]. They based the production on the technique for making condoms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biotechnology-innovation.com.au/innovations/instruments/latex_gloves.html |title=100 Years of Australian Innovation - latex gloves |accessdate=2010-03-07 |quote=In 1945, Ansell designed and built the first automatic dipping machine, which produced 300 dozen pairs of synthetic gloves in eight hours. Ansell introduced disposable surgical gloves in 1964, which won the company an Export Award in 1967. International expansion over the next two decades saw Ansell become the world's largest producer of latex gloves for household and medical use. |publisher= }}</ref> These gloves have a range of  clinical uses ranging from dealing with human excrement to dental applications.

Criminals have also been known to wear these gloves during the commission of their crimes. These gloves are often chosen because their thinness and tight fit allow for dexterity. Ironically, because of the thinness of these gloves, fingerprints may actually pass through the material as [[glove prints]], thus transferring the wearer's prints onto whatever surface is touched or handled.<ref>{{cite web|author=Weather &amp; Time |url=http://www.chacha.com/question/do-latex-gloves-conceal-fingerprints%3F-if-so%2C-why |title=Do latex gloves conceal fingerprints?

The participants of the [[Watergate burglaries]] infamously did so wearing rubber surgical gloves in an effort to hide their fingerprints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAwatergate.htm |title=Watergate |publisher=Spartacus.Schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>

==Alternatives to latex==
{{Main|latex allergy}}

Due to the increasing rate of latex allergy among health professionals, and in the general population, gloves made of non-latex materials such as vinyl, nitrile rubber or neoprene have become widely used. Chemical processes may be employed to reduce the amount of [[antibody generator|antigenic protein]] in Hevea latex, resulting in alternative natural-rubber-based materials such [[Vytex Natural Rubber Latex]]. However, non-latex gloves have not yet replaced latex gloves in surgical procedures, as gloves made of alternative materials generally do not fully match the fine control or greater sensitivity to touch available with latex surgical gloves. (High-grade [[Isoprene]] gloves are the only exception to this rule, as they have the same chemical structure as natural latex rubber.  However, fully artificial polyisoprene—rather than 'hypoallergenic' cleaned natural latex rubber<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm070925.htm |title=User Labeling for Devices that Contain Natural Rubber (21 CFR 801.437); Small Entity Compliance Guide |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>--is also the most expensive natural latex substitute available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html |title=Polyisoprene Surgical Gloves |publisher=SurgicalGlove.net |accessdate= 2012-12-14}}</ref>) Other high-grade non-latex gloves, such as nitrile gloves, can cost over twice the price of their latex counterparts, a fact that has often prevented switching to these alternative materials in cost-sensitive environments, such as many hospitals.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/952/Korniewicz_Tech%5B1%5D.pdf |title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Non-latex Surgical Gloves |format=PDF |publisher= touchbriefings.com |accessdate= 2012-12-14}}</ref>

Powder-free medical gloves are used in medical cleanroom environments, where the need for cleanliness is often similar to that in a sensitive medical environment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
