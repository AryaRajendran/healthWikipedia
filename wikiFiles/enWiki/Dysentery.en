'''Dysentery''' (formerly known as '''flux''' or the '''bloody flux''') is an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] disorder of the [[intestine]], especially of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], that results in severe [[diarrhea]] containing [[blood]] and [[mucus]] in the [[feces]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000033012|dysentery}}</ref> with [[fever]], [[abdominal pain]],<ref>Traveller's Diarrhea: Dysentery [[ISBN|ISBN 0-86318-864-8]] p. 214</ref> and [[rectal tenesmus]] (a feeling of incomplete defecation), caused by any kind of infection.

== Signs and symptoms ==
In developed countries, dysentery is, in general, a mild illness, causing mild symptoms normally consisting of mild stomach pains and frequent passage of stool.  Symptoms normally present themselves after one to three days and are usually no longer present after a week.  The frequency of urges to defecate, the volume of feces passed, and the presence of mucus,  pus and blood depend on the [[pathogen]] that is causing the disease.  Temporary [[lactose intolerance]] can occur.  In some caustic occasions, vomiting of blood, severe abdominal pain, [[fever]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and [[delirium]] can all be symptoms.<ref name="pmid359524">{{cite journal |author=DuPont HL |title=Interventions in diarrheas of infants and young children |journal=J.

==Mechanism==
Dysentery results from [[virus|viral]] infections, [[bacteria]]l infections, or [[parasitism|parasitic]] infestations. These pathogens typically reach the [[large intestine]] after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so on.

Each specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general the result is damage to the intestinal lining, leading to the [[inflammation|inflammatory immune response]]. This can cause elevated temperature, painful spasms of the intestinal muscles ([[cramping]]), swelling due to water leaking from capillaries of the intestine ([[edema]]), and further tissue damage by the body's immune cells and the chemicals, called [[cytokine]]s, they release to fight the infection. The result can be impaired nutrient absorption, excessive water and mineral loss through the stools due to breakdown of the control mechanisms in the intestinal tissue that normally remove water from the stools, and in severe cases the entry of pathogenic organisms into the bloodstream.

Some microorganisms &ndash; for example, bacteria of the genus ''[[Shigella]]'' &ndash; secrete substances known as [[cytotoxin]]s, which kill and damage intestinal tissue on contact. Viruses directly attack the intestinal cells, taking over their metabolic machinery to make copies of themselves, which leads to cell death.

Definitions of ''dysentery'' can vary by region and by medical specialty. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits its definition to "diarrhea with visible blood."<ref>{{cite web|title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf|work=WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.8|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta, Georgia 1999}}</ref> Others define the term more broadly.<ref name=TFD>{{cite web|title=Dysentery|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dysentery|publisher=TheFreeDictionary's Medical dictionary}}</ref> These differences in definition must be taken into account when defining mechanisms. For example, using the CDC definition requires that intestinal tissue be so severely damaged that blood vessels have ruptured, allowing visible quantities of blood to be lost with defecation. Other definitions require less specific damage.

===Amoebic dysentery===
{{main|Amoebic dysentery}}
Dysentery may be caused by [[amoebiasis]], an infection by the [[amoeba]] ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] | title=''Amoebiasis. Report of a WHO Expert Committee |journal=WHO Technical Report Series |year=1969 |volume=421 |pages=1–52 |pmid=4978968 }}</ref> and is then known as [[amoebic dysentery]].<ref>{{MeshName|Amebic+Dysentery}}</ref> Proper treatment of the underlying infection of [[amoebic dysentery]] is important; insufficiently treated amoebiasis can lie dormant for years and then lead to [[Amoebiasis#Complications|severe, potentially fatal, complications]].
Amoebic dysentery (amoebiasis) is caused by an amoeba (a single-celled parasite) called Entamoeba histolytica. It is mainly found in tropical areas.
When the amoebas inside the bowel of an infected person are ready to leave the body, they group together and form a shell that surrounds and protects them. This group of amoebas is known as a cyst.
The cyst passes out of the person's body in their feces and is able to survive outside the body. If hygiene standards are poor; for example, if the person does not dispose of their feces hygienically, it can contaminate the surroundings, such as nearby food and water.
If another person then eats or drinks food or water that has been contaminated with feces containing the cyst, they will also become infected with the amoeba. Amoebic dysentery is particularly common in parts of the world where human feces are used as fertilizer.
After entering the person's body through their mouth, the cyst will travel down into their stomach. The amoebas inside the cyst are protected from the stomach's digestive acid. From the stomach, the cyst will travel to the intestines where it will break open and release the amoebas, causing the infection. The amoebas are able to burrow into the walls of the intestines and cause small abscesses and ulcers to form. The cycle then begins again.
The amoebas that cause dysentery can be transmitted during mouth-to-anus contact.

===Bacillary dysentery===
{{main|Shigellosis}}
Severe dysentery may also be caused by [[shigellosis]], an infection by [[bacteria]] of the genus ''[[Shigella]]'',<ref>[[World Health Organization|WHO]]. [http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index6.html Diarrhoeal Diseases – Shigellosis].</ref> and is then known as bacillary dysentery (or Marlow Syndrome).

==Diagnosis==
A clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a history and doing a brief examination. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis.

===Medical history===
Exposed individuals may experience either mild, severe, or even no symptoms at all. In extreme cases  dysentery patients may pass over a litre of fluid an hour. More often, individuals will complain of [[nausea]], [[abdominal pain]], and frequent watery and usually foul-smelling [[diarrhea]] accompanied by [[mucus]] and [[blood]], rectal pain, and [[fever]]. [[Vomiting]], rapid weight loss, and generalized [[muscle ache]]s  sometimes also accompany dysentery. On rare occasions, the amoebic parasite will invade the body through the bloodstream and spread beyond the intestines. In such cases, it may more seriously infect other organs such as the [[Human brain|brain]], [[Human lungs|lungs]], and the [[liver]].<ref name=Diagnosis>{{cite web | author=mdguidelines.com | title=Dysentery-Diagnosis | url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/dysentery/diagnosis | accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref>

===Physical exam===
The mouth, skin, and lips may appear dry due to dehydration. Lower abdominal tenderness may also be present.<ref name=Diagnosis/>

===Stool and blood tests===
[[cell culture|Cultures]] of [[stool sample]]s are examined in order to identify the [[organism]] causing dysentery. Usually, several samples must be obtained due to the changing number of amoeba, which changes daily.<ref name=Diagnosis/>

[[Blood test]]s can be used to measure abnormalities in the levels of essential [[electrolytes|minerals and salts]].<ref name=Diagnosis/>

==Prevention==
To reduce the risk of contracting dysentery the following precautions are suggested:<ref>{{Cite web

</ref>

*Washing one's hands after using the toilet, after contact with an infected person, and regularly throughout the day.
*Washing one's hands before handling, cooking and eating food, handling babies, and feeding young or elderly people.
*Keeping contact with someone known to have dysentery to a minimum.
*Washing laundry on the hottest setting possible.
*Avoiding sharing items such as towels and face cloths.

Vaccines currently in development may eventually become a critical part of the strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea, particularly among children in low-resource settings. For example, ''Shigella'' is a longstanding World Health Organization (WHO) target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent this disease should be feasible. Currently, no licensed vaccine targeting ''Shigella'' exists. The development of vaccines against these types of infection has been hampered by technical constraints, insufficient support for coordination, and a lack of market forces for research and development. Most vaccine development efforts are taking place in the public sector or as research programs within biotechnology companies. Several vaccine candidates are currently in various phases of research and development, including a number of ongoing clinical trials.<ref name="ETEC/Shig VRL">{{cite web|last=Vaccine Resource Library|title=More about shigellosis and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)|url=http://www.path.org/vaccineresources/shigella-etec-info.php|accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Dysentery is initially managed by maintaining fluid intake using [[oral rehydration therapy]]. If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for [[intravenous]] fluid replacement. In ideal situations, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an [[amebicide|amoebicidal]] drug to kill the [[parasite]] and an [[antibiotic]] to treat any associated bacterial infection.

If shigella is suspected and it is not too severe, the doctor may recommend letting it run its course — usually less than a week. The patient will be advised to replace fluids lost from diarrhea. If the shigella is severe, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics, such as [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|TMP-SMX]] (Bactrim). However, many strains of shigella are becoming resistant to common antibiotics, and effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries. If necessary, a doctor may have to reserve antibiotics for those at highest risk for death, including young children, people over 50, and anyone suffering from dehydration or malnutrition.

Amoebic dysentery usually calls for a two-pronged attack. Treatment should start with a 10-day course of the antimicrobial drug [[metronidazole]] (Flagyl). To finish off the parasite, the doctor can prescribe a course of [[diloxanide furoate]] (available only through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), [[paromomycin]] (Humatin), or [[iodoquinol]] (Yodoxin).

The seed, leaves, and bark of the [[kapok]] tree have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples of the rain forest regions in [[the Americas]], West-Central Africa, and South East Asia to treat this disease.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kapok Tree|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/kapok.htm|work=Blue Planet and Biomoes|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ceiba pentandra|url=http://www.zoo.org/page.aspx?pid=1954|work=Human Uses and Cultural Importance|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.encyclocenter.com/Kapok-Emergent-24736.html Kapok Emergent Tree Of Tropical Rain Forest Used To Treat Asthma Dysentery Fever Kidney Diseases]</ref>

==Prognosis==
With correct treatment, most cases of amoebic and bacterial dysentery subside within ten days, and most individuals will achieve a full recovery within two to four weeks after beginning proper treatment.  If the disease is left untreated, the prognosis varies with the immune status of the individual patient and the severity of disease. Extreme dehydration can prolong recovery and significantly raises the risk for serious complications.<ref>{{cite web | author=mdguidelines.com | title=Dysentery-Prognosis | url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/dysentery/prognosis | accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Insufficient data exists, but conservative estimates from the WHO suggest that 90 million cases of ''Shigellosis'' are contracted annually, with at least 100,000 of these resulting in death.<ref name="DD WHO">{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Diarrhoeal Diseases|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index6.html|accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref>  ''Amebiasis'' is infecting over 50 million people each year, killing about 50,000.<ref>{{Cite book
