{{Pulmonary function}}

'''Spirometry''' (meaning ''the measuring of breath'') is the most common of the [[pulmonary function test]]s (PFTs), measuring [[lung]] function, specifically the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Spirometry is an important tool used for generating pneumotachographs, which are helpful in assessing conditions such as [[asthma]], [[pulmonary fibrosis]], [[cystic fibrosis]], and [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]].

==Indications==
Spirometry is indicated for the following reasons:
*to diagnose or manage asthma<ref name="AAAAIfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology |author1-link = American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AAAAI.pdf |accessdate = 14 August 2012}}</ref><ref name="NIHasthmaguide">{{cite book|title=Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma|year=2007|publisher=National Institutes of Health|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthgdln.pdf|edition=NIH Publication Number 08-5846}}</ref><ref name="globalstrategy">{{cite doi|10.1183/09031936.00138707}}</ref>

===Spirometer===
The spirometry test is performed using a device called a [[spirometer]], which comes in several different varieties. Most spirometers display the following graphs, called spirograms:
*a ''volume-time curve'', showing volume (liters) along the Y-axis and time (seconds) along the X-axis
*a ''flow-volume loop'', which graphically depicts the rate of airflow on the Y-axis and the total volume [[inhalation|inspired]] or [[exhalation|expired]] on the X-axis

===Procedure===
The basic forced volume vital capacity (FVC) test varies slightly depending on the equipment used. 

Generally, the patient is asked to take the deepest breath they can, and then exhale into the sensor as hard as possible, for as long as possible, preferably at least 6 seconds. It is sometimes directly followed by a rapid inhalation (inspiration), in particular when assessing possible [[upper airway obstruction]].  Sometimes, the test will be preceded by a period of quiet breathing in and out from the sensor (tidal volume), or the rapid breath in (forced inspiratory part) will come before the forced exhalation. 

During the test, soft nose clips may be used to prevent air escaping through the nose. Filter mouthpieces may be used to prevent the spread of microorganisms.

===Limitations of test===
The maneuver is highly dependent on patient cooperation and effort, and is normally repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Since results are dependent on patient cooperation, FVC can only be underestimated, never overestimated. 

Due to the patient cooperation required, spirometry can only be used on children old enough to comprehend and follow the instructions given (6 years old or more), and only on patients who are able to understand and follow instructions — thus, this test is not suitable for patients who are unconscious, heavily sedated, or have limitations that would interfere with vigorous respiratory efforts. Other types of lung function tests are available for infants and unconscious persons.

Another major limitation is the fact that many intermittent or mild asthmatics have normal spirometry between acute exacerbation, limiting spirometry's usefulness as a diagnostic. It is more useful as a monitoring tool:  a sudden decrease in FEV1 or other spirometric measure in the same patient can signal worsening control, even if the raw value is still normal.  Patients are encouraged to record their personal best measures.

===Related tests===
Spirometry can also be part of a [[bronchial challenge test]], used to determine [[bronchial]] hyperresponsiveness to either rigorous exercise, inhalation of cold/dry air, or with a pharmaceutical agent such as [[methacholine]] or [[histamine]].

Sometimes, to assess the reversibility of a particular condition, a [[bronchodilator]] is administered before performing another round of tests for comparison. This is commonly referred to as a ''reversibility test'', or a ''post bronchodilator test'' (Post BD), and is an important part in diagnosing asthma versus COPD.

Other complementary lung functions tests include [[plethysmography]] and [[nitrogen washout]].

==Parameters==

The most common parameters measured in spirometry are Vital capacity (VC), Forced vital capacity (FVC), Forced expiratory volume (FEV) at timed intervals of 0.5, 1.0 (FEV1), 2.0, and 3.0 seconds, forced expiratory flow 25–75% (FEF 25–75) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV),<ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Spirometry-Tests.html surgeryencyclopedia.com > Spirometry tests]. Retrieved 14 March 2010.</ref> also known as Maximum breathing capacity.<ref>[http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Maximum_breathing_capacity MVV and MBC]</ref> Other tests may be performed in certain situations.

Results are usually given in both raw data (litres, litres per second) and percent predicted—the test result as a percent of the "predicted values" for the patients of similar characteristics (height, age, sex, and sometimes race and weight). The interpretation of the results can vary depending on the physician and the source of the predicted values. Generally speaking, results nearest to 100% predicted are the most normal, and results over 80% are often considered normal. Multiple publications of predicted values have been published and may be [http://www.dynamicmt.com/dataform3.html calculated online] based on age, sex, weight and ethnicity.  However, review by a doctor is necessary for accurate diagnosis of any individual situation.

A bronchodilator is also given in certain circumstances and a pre/post graph comparison is done to assess the effectiveness of the bronchodilator. See the example printout. 

[[Functional residual capacity]] (FRC) cannot be measured via spirometry, but it can be measured with a [[plethysmograph]] or dilution tests (for example, helium dilution test).

[[Image:LungVolume.jpg|frameless|600px|Output of a 'spirometer']]

===Forced vital capacity (FVC)===
Forced [[vital capacity]] (FVC) is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration,<ref name="Office">{{Cite journal|last1=Perez|first1=LL|title=Office spirometry|journal= Osteopathic Family Physician  |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=65–69 |year=2013 |month=March–April|pmid= |doi =10.1016/j.osfp.2012.09.003}}</ref> measured in liters. FVC is the most basic maneuver in spirometry tests.

===Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)===
FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration.<ref name="Office"/> Average values for FEV1 in healthy people depend mainly on sex and age, according to the diagram at left.
Values of between 80% and 120% of the average value are considered normal.<ref name=uppsala>LUNGFUNKTION — Practice compendium for semester 6. Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Physiology, Academic Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. Retrieved 2010.</ref> Predicted normal values for FEV1 can be [http://www.dynamicmt.com/dataform3.html calculated online] and depend on age, sex, height, weight and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based on.

===FEV1/FVC ratio (FEV1%)===
[[FEV1/FVC ratio|FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC]] (FEV1%) is the ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub> to FVC. In healthy adults this should be approximately 75–80%. In obstructive diseases (asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema) FEV<sub>1</sub> is diminished because of increased airway resistance to expiratory flow; the FVC may be decreased as well, due to the premature closure of airway in expiration, just not in the same proportion as FEV<sub>1</sub> (for instance, both FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC are reduced, but the former is more affected because of the increased airway resistance). This generates a reduced value (<80%, often ~45%). In restrictive diseases (such as [[pulmonary fibrosis]]) the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC are both reduced proportionally and the value may be normal or even increased as a result of decreased lung compliance.

A derived value of FEV1% is '''FEV1% predicted''', which is defined as FEV1% of the patient divided by the average FEV1% in the population for any person of similar age, sex and body composition.

===Forced expiratory flow (FEF)===
Forced expiratory flow (FEF) is the flow (or speed) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of a forced expiration. 
It can be given at [[discrete time]]s, generally defined by what fraction remains of the forced vital capacity (FVC). 
The usual intervals are 25%, 50% and 75% (FEF25, FEF50 and FEF75), or 25% and 50% of FVC. 
It can also be given as a mean of the flow during an interval, also generally delimited by when specific fractions remain of FVC, usually 25–75% (FEF25–75%). Average ranges in the healthy population depend mainly on sex and age, with FEF25–75% shown in diagram at left. Values ranging from 50-60% and up to 130% of the average are considered normal.<ref name=uppsala/> Predicted normal values for FEF can be [http://www.dynamicmt.com/dataform3.html calculated online] and depend on age, sex, height, weight and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based on.

'''MMEF''' or '''MEF''' stands for maximal (mid-)expiratory flow and is the peak of expiratory flow as taken from the flow-volume curve and measured in liters per second. It should theoretically be identical to [[peak expiratory flow]] (PEF), which is, however, generally measured by a peak flow meter and given in liters per minute.<ref name=hedenstrom2009>Interpretation model — compendium at Uppsala Academic Hospital. By H. Hedenström. 2009-02-04</ref>

Recent research suggests that FEF25-75% or FEF25-50% may be a more sensitive parameter than FEV1 in the detection of obstructive small airway disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Michael R.|coauthors=Chinchilli, Vernon M., Phillips, Brenda R., Sorkness, Christine A., Lemanske Jr., Robert F., Szefler, Stanley J., Taussig, Lynn, Bacharier, Leonard B., Morgan, Wayne|title=Forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity and FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio in relation to clinical and physiological parameters in asthmatic children with normal FEV1 values|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=1 September 2010|volume=126|issue=3|pages=527–534.e8|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2010.05.016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ciprandi|first=Giorgio|coauthors=Cirillo, Ignazio|title=Forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity may be a marker of bronchial impairment in allergic rhinitis|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=1 February 2011|volume=127|issue=2|pages=549–549|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2010.10.053}}</ref>  However, in the absence of concomitant changes in the standard markers, discrepancies in mid-range expiratory flow may not be specific enough to be useful, and current practice guidelines recommend continuing to use FEV1, VC, and FEV1/VC as indicators of obstructive disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pellegrino|first=R|coauthors=Viegi, G, Brusasco, V, Crapo, RO, Burgos, F, Casaburi, R, Coates, A, van der Grinten, CP, Gustafsson, P, Hankinson, J, Jensen, R, Johnson, DC, MacIntyre, N, McKay, R, Miller, MR, Navajas, D, Pedersen, OF, Wanger, J|title=Interpretative strategies for lung function tests|journal=The European respiratory journal : official journal of the European Society for Clinical Respiratory Physiology|date=2005 Nov|volume=26|issue=5|pages=948–68|pmid=16264058|doi=10.1183/09031936.05.00035205}}</ref><ref name="ACP Medicine">{{cite web|last=Kreider|first=Maryl|title=Chapter 14.1 Pulmonary Function Testing|url=http://online.statref.com/Notes/ResolveNote.aspx?NoteID=48177&grpalias=TEX|work=ACP Medicine|publisher=Decker Intellectual Properties|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> 

More rarely, forced expiratory flow may be given at intervals defined by how much remains of total lung capacity. In such cases, it is usually designated as e.g. FEF70%TLC, FEF60%TLC and FEF50%TLC.<ref name=hedenstrom2009/>

===Forced inspiratory flow 25–75% or 25–50%===
Forced inspiratory flow 25–75% or 25–50% (FIF 25–75% or 25–50%) is similar to FEF 25–75% or 25–50% except the measurement is taken during inspiration.

===Peak expiratory flow (PEF)===
[[File:Normal values for peak expiratory flow - EU scale.svg|thumb|right|250px|Normal values for peak expiratory flow (PEF), shown on EU scale.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nunn AJ, Gregg I |title=New regression equations for predicting peak expiratory flow in adults |journal=BMJ |volume=298 |issue=6680 |pages=1068–70 |year=1989 |month=April |pmid=2497892 |pmc=1836460 |doi=10.1136/bmj.298.6680.1068}} Adapted by Clement Clarke for use in EU scale — see [http://www.peakflow.com/top_nav/normal_values/index.html Peakflow.com ⇒ Predictive Normal Values (Nomogram, EU scale)]</ref>]]
[[Peak expiratory flow]] (PEF) is the maximal flow (or speed) achieved during the maximally forced expiration initiated at full inspiration, measured in liters per minute.

===Tidal volume (TV)===
[[Tidal volume]] is the amount of air inhaled and exhaled normally at rest

===Total lung capacity (TLC)===
[[Total lung capacity]] (TLC) is the maximum volume of air present in the lungs

===Diffusing capacity (DLCO)===
[[Diffusion capacity|Diffusing capacity]] (or [[DLCO]]) is the carbon monoxide uptake from a single inspiration in a standard time (usually 10 sec). Since air consists of very minute or trace quantities of CO, 10 seconds is considered to be the standard time for inhalation, then rapidly blow it out (exhale). The exhaled gas is tested to determine how much of the tracer gas was absorbed during the breath. This will pick up diffusion impairments, for instance in pulmonary fibrosis.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003854|Lung diffusion testing}}</ref> This must be corrected for anemia (because rapid CO diffusion is dependent on hemoglobin in RBC's; a low hemoglobin concentration, anemia, will reduce DLCO) and pulmonary hemorrhage (excess RBC's in the interstitium or alveoli can absorb CO and artificially increase the DLCO capacity). Atmospheric pressure and/or altitude will also affect measured DLCO, and so a correction factor is needed to adjust for standard pressure. Online calculators are available to [http://www.dynamicmt.com/DLCOadjust.html correct for hemoglobin levels] and [http://www.dynamicmt.com/DLCOaltitude.html altitude and/or pressure] where the measurement was taken.

===Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV)===
Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) is a measure of the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled and exhaled within one minute. For the comfort of the patient this is done over a 15 second time period before being extrapolated to a value for one minute expressed as liters/minute. Average values for males and females are 14–18 and 8–12 liters per minute respectively.

===Static lung compliance (C<sub>st</sub>)===
When estimating static lung compliance, volume measurements by the spirometer needs to be complemented by [[pressure transducer]]s in order to simultaneously measure the [[transpulmonary pressure]]. When having drawn a curve with the relations between changes in volume to changes in transpulmonary pressure, C<sub>st</sub> is the slope of the curve during any given volume, or, mathematically, ΔV/ΔP.<ref name=Ronald>{{cite book |first=Ronald B. |last=George |title=Chest medicine: essentials of pulmonary and critical care medicine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlX2zJMbdgC |year=2005 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-5273-2 |page=96}}</ref> Static lung compliance is perhaps the most sensitive parameter for the detection of abnormal pulmonary mechanics.<ref>{{cite pmid|11434468}}</ref> It is considered normal if it is 60% to 140% of the average value in the population for any person of similar age, sex and body composition.<ref name=uppsala/>

In those with acute respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, "the static compliance of the total respiratory system is conventionally obtained by dividing the tidal volume by the difference between the "plateau" pressure measured at the airway opening (PaO) during an occlusion at end-inspiration and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set by the ventilator".<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 4003913 | volume=131 | issue=5 | title=Measurement of static compliance of the total respiratory system in patients with acute respiratory failure during mechanical ventilation.
