==Disease mechanism==
Although the gross histological features of AD in the brain are well characterized, three major hypotheses have been advanced regarding the primary cause. The oldest hypothesis suggests that deficiency in [[cholinergic]] signaling initiates the progression of the disease. Two alternative misfolding hypotheses instead suggest that either tau protein or amyloid beta initiates the cascade. While researchers have not identified a clear causative pathway originating from any of the three molecular hypotheses to explain the gross anatomical changes observed in advanced AD, variants of the amyloid beta hypothesis of molecular initiation have become dominant among the three possibilities.

===Cholinergic hypothesis===

The oldest hypothesis is the "cholinergic hypothesis". It states that Alzheimer's begins as a deficiency in the production of [[acetylcholine]], a vital [[neurotransmitter]]. Much early therapeutic research was based on this hypothesis, including restoration of the "cholinergic nuclei". The possibility of cell-replacement therapy was investigated on the basis of this hypothesis. All of the first-generation anti-Alzheimer's medications are based on this hypothesis and work to preserve acetylcholine by inhibiting [[acetylcholinesterase]]s (enzymes that break down acetylcholine). These medications, though sometimes beneficial, have not led to a cure. In all cases, they have served to only treat symptoms of the disease and have neither halted nor reversed it. These results and other research have led to the conclusion that acetylcholine deficiencies may not be directly causal, but are a result of widespread brain tissue damage, damage so widespread that cell-replacement therapies are likely to be impractical. More recently, cholinergic effects have been proposed as a potential causative agent for the formation of plaques and tangles<ref name="Shen">{{cite journal |author=Shen ZX |title=Brain cholinesterases: II. The molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Med. Hypotheses |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=308–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15236795 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.02.031}}</ref> leading to generalized neuroinflammation.<ref name="Wenk">{{cite journal |author=Wenk GL |title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease |journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry |volume=64 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=7–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12934968 |doi=}}</ref>

More recent hypotheses center on the effects of the misfolded and aggregated proteins, amyloid beta and tau. The two positions are lightheartedly described as "ba-ptist" and "tau-ist" viewpoints in one scientific publication. Therein, it is suggested that "Tau-ists" believe that the [[tau protein]] abnormalities initiate the disease cascade, while "ba-ptists" believe that [[beta amyloid]] deposits are the causative factor in the disease.<ref name="Mudher">{{cite journal |author=Mudher A, Lovestone S |title=Alzheimer's disease-do tauists and baptists finally shake hands? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=22–6 |year=2002 |pmid=11801334 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)02031-2}}</ref>

===Tau hypothesis===

The hypothesis that tau is the primary causative factor has long been grounded in the observation that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss.<ref name="Schmitz">{{cite journal |author=Schmitz C, Rutten BP, Pielen A, ''et al.'' |title=Hippocampal neuron loss exceeds amyloid plaque load in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Am.

===Amyloid hypothesis===

The amyloid hypothesis is initially compelling because the gene for the amyloid beta precursor APP is located on [[chromosome 21]], and patients with [[trisomy 21]] - better known as Down syndrome - who thus have an extra [[gene dosage|gene copy]] almost universally exhibit AD-like disorders by 40 years of age.<ref name="Nistor">{{cite journal |author=Nistor M, Don M, Parekh M, ''et al.'' |title=Alpha- and beta-secretase activity as a function of age and beta-amyloid in Down syndrome and normal brain |journal=Neurobiol.
