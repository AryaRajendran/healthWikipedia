An '''emerging infectious disease''' (EID) is an [[infectious disease]] whose incidence has increased in the past 4.5 billion years and could increase in the near future. Emerging infections account for at least 12% of all human [[pathogen]]s.<ref>Taylor, L. ''et al.'' (2001). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11516376  Risk factors for human disease emergence] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B'', 356(1411):983-9.</ref> EIDs are caused by newly identified species or strains (e.g. [[SARS]], [[AIDS]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fauci AS |title=Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases: the perpetual challenge |journal=Academic Medicine|volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=1079–85 |year=2005 |pmid=16306276 |doi=}}</ref> that may have [[evolution|evolved]] from a known infection (e.g. [[influenza]]) or spread to a new population (e.g. [[West Nile virus]]) or area undergoing ecologic transformation (e.g. [[Lyme disease]]), or be ''reemerging'' infections, like [[drug resistance|drug resistant]] [[tuberculosis]].  Of growing concern are adverse synergistic interactions between emerging diseases and other infectious and [[non-communicable diseases|non-infectious conditions]] leading to the development of novel [[syndemic]]s.

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) publishes a journal ''[[Emerging Infectious Diseases]]'' that identifies the following factors contributing to disease emergence:
* Microbial adaption; e.g. [[genetic drift]] and [[genetic shift]] in [[Influenza A]]
* Changing human susceptibility; e.g. mass immunocompromisation with [[HIV/AIDS]]
* Climate and weather; e.g. diseases with [[zoonotic vector]]s such as [[West Nile virus|West Nile]] Disease (transmitted by [[mosquitoes]]) are moving further from the tropics as the climate warms
* Change in human [[demographics]] and trade; e.g. rapid travel enabled [[SARS]] to rapidly propagate around the globe
* Economic development; e.g. use of [[antibiotics]] to increase meat yield of farmed cows leads to [[antibiotic resistance]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* Breakdown of public health; e.g. the current situation in [[Zimbabwe]]
* Poverty and social inequality; e.g. [[tuberculosis]] is primarily a problem in low-income areas
* [[War]] and [[famine]]
* [[Bioterrorism]]; e.g. [[2001 Anthrax attacks]]
* Dam and irrigation system construction; e.g. [[malaria]] and other mosquito borne diseases
