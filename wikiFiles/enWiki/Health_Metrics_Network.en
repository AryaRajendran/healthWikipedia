The '''Health Metrics Network (HMN)''' is a global partnership that facilitates better health information at country, regional and global levels. The Network was formally launched in May 2005 during the 58th session of the [http://www.who.int/gb/ World Health Assembly (WHA)]. Hosted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], HMN aims to increase the availability and use of timely and accurate health information by catalysing the joint funding and development of core country health information systems.<ref>[http://www.who.int/healthmetrics/about/whatwillhmndo/en/index.html HMN website] .

==Mission==
HMN aims to improve health and save lives through stronger, locally-owned health information systems.

HMN has a single strategic goal: increasing the availability and use of timely and accurate health information by catalyzing the development of core country health information systems. In pursuit of this goal, HMN lays out a vision and identifies strategies for health information system (HIS) development.
  
HMN supports this goal through partnership, advocacy, resource mobilization, catalytic country implementation support. HMN also promotes the generation of new knowledge and global public goods through research, technical innovation, and sharing lessons learned. Specifically, HMN pursues interrelated objectives as below:
* Creating a harmonized framework for country HIS development (the HMN Framework) which describes standards for health information systems;
* Recording every birth, death and cause of death (MOVE-IT for the MDGs);
* Developing methods to track progress in health information systems; and
* Ensuring access and use of information by local, regional and global constituencies.<ref name=hmn/>

==Structure==

HMN has an organizational structure composed of an Executive Board and a Secretariat. The HMN Executive Board is the highest coordinating and decision-making body for the Network. Board membership comprises key stakeholders in health information, including health and statistical experts, developing countries, technical and development partners and funding agencies. The Boardâ€™s primary functions relate to strategy and accountability for HMN. It approves the strategic vision, direction and policies of HMN.
 
The HMN Secretariat supports HMN partners to achieve HMN's goal and objectives. The Secretariat consists of an Executive Secretary and core technical and administrative staff. These staff are based at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.

==Achievements==
* With strong WHO leadership, the ''HMN Framework and Standards for Country Health Information Systems'' was used by over 85 countries in all six WHO Regions to make an assessment of their health information systems. The  ''HMN Framework'' was also used by partners such as the World Bank, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, USAID, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Africa Development Bank. 
* The ''HMN Framework'' is credited for health information system-related improvements in terms of lives and money saved, and for cost-effectiveness. HMN has tracked and documented over US $500 million being associated with the improvements of country health information systems.
* In 2007, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution (WHA60.27) entitled ''Strengthening of health information systems''. The resolution acknowledges that sound information is critical in framing evidence-based health policy and making decisions, and is fundamental for monitoring progress towards internationally agreed health-related development goals. The resolution urges Members States, all stakeholders and the WHO Director-General to take specific steps to support the strengthening of health information systems, given that such systems in most developing countries are weak.
* A joint initiative with The Lancet launched a successful global advocacy campaign on the monitoring of vital events in 2006. The published findings and ideas have since positively influenced  advocacy efforts on the strengthening of civil registration and vital statistics strengthening  in Africa and Asia in 2010 alone.
* HMN has helped foster a growing cluster of regional networks such as the Caribbean Group, an e-health network spearheaded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the m-health Alliance, and the West African Health Organization.
* The HMN Secretariat has provided assistance to several countries including Ethiopia, Belize, and Kenya, enabling them to secure financing from the Global Fund to strengthen health information systems.
* Information-driven improvements have been achieved in countries. For example, in rural Western District, Sierra Leone where the percentage of women giving birth rose in 2009 from around 13% to nearly 60% due to a policy of free health services,information from a revitalized health information system was used to identify the problem of high maternal mortality, to understand contributing factors, to design a relevant intervention with active participation of clients, civil society, and district officials to track the effect of implementing the intervention.  

In Belize, the percentage of HIV+ pregnant women receiving full prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) went from just under 60% in 2006 to virtually 100% in the first half of 2008. Thanks to information system driven improvements, including a national electronic medical record system, HIV+ pregnant women are now readily identified and are closely followed with medical and psychosocial support. This has contributed to the virtual elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in the country.

==Partners==
HMN works with and through partners, including countries, donors, development agencies and technical experts. By linking with other networks and partnerships involved in health information, such as RHINO and [[PARIS21]], HMN extends its reach and both draws upon and contributes to such initiatives. By forging alliances with major consumers of health information, in particular global health initiatives such as The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, HMN ensures that countries and programmes benefit from coherent and consistent technical support.<ref name=hmn>[http://www.who.int/healthmetrics/network/partners/en/index.html HMN website] .

==Funding==
HMN has benefited from an initial grant of US$ 50 million awarded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2004 and additional contributions from other donors including: Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), European Commission, Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Paris 21, Rockefeller Foundation, Systems Research Institute of Thailand, United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Bank.
