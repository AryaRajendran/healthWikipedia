In [[anatomy]], '''lymph vessels''' (or '''lymphatic vessels''') are thin walled, [[valve]]d structures that carry [[lymph]]. As part of the [[lymphatic system]], lymph vessels are complementary to the [[cardiovascular system]]. Lymph vessels are lined by [[endothelium|endothelial cells]], and have a thin layer of [[smooth muscle]]s, and [[adventitia]] that bind the lymph vessels to the surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to propulsion of the lymph from the [[lymph capillaries]], which are mainly concerned with absorption of [[interstitial fluid]] from the tissues. Lymph capillaries are slightly larger than their counterpart capillaries of the vascular system. Lymph vessels that carry lymph to a [[lymph node]] are called the [[afferent lymph vessel]], and one that carries it from a lymph node is called the [[efferent lymph vessel]], from where the lymph may travel to another lymph node, may be returned to a vein, or may travel to a larger [[lymph duct]]. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one of the [[subclavian vein]]s and thus return it to general [[circulation (physiology)|circulation]].

Generally, lymph flows away from the [[biological tissue|tissues]] to [[lymph node]]s and eventually to either the [[right lymphatic duct]] or the largest lymph vessel in the body, the [[thoracic duct]]. These vessels drain into the right and left [[subclavian veins]] respectively.

==Function==
Lymph vessels act as reservoirs for plasma and other substances including cells that have leaked from the vascular system and transport lymph fluid back from the tissues to the circulatory system. Without functioning lymph vessels, lymph cannot be effectively drained and [[edema]] typically results.

=== General structure of Lymphatics ===
<!--There is a lot of ambiguity in terminology regarding which vessels are lymph and which is a capillary. Also which have valves, smooth muscles, etc. I'll alter the text when the confusion clears up--[[User:KC Panchal]]-->
The general structure of lymphatics is based on that of [[Blood vessel#Anatomy|blood vessel]]s. There is an inner lining of single flattened epithelial cells (simple squamous epithelium) composed of a type of [[epithelium]] that is called [[endothelium]], and the cells are called ''endothelial cells''. This layer functions to mechanically transport fluid and since the [[basement membrane]] on which it rests is discontinuous; it leaks easily.<ref name=pepper>{{cite journal  | last=Pepper|first=Michael S.|coauthors=Michaela Skobe|date=2003-10-27  | title =  Lymphatic endothelium  :  morphological, molecular and functional properties

The outermost layer is the [[adventitia]] that consists of fibrous tissue. The general structure described here is seen only in larger lymphatics; smaller lymphatics have fewer layers. The smallest vessels (''lymphatic'' or ''[[lymph capillaries]]'') lack both the muscular layer and the outer adventitia. As they proceed forward and in their course are joined by other capillaries, they grow larger and first take on an adventitia, and then smooth muscles.
<!--The text on the whole needs reorganization. Right now, am trying to add as much info as possible, which can later be easily organized into appropriate sections. So, there can be some info that is "overlapping"--[[User:KC Panchal]]-->

The whole lymphatic conducting system broadly consists of two types of channels&mdash;the ''initial lymphatics'', the ''prelymphatics'' or ''[[lymph capillaries]]'' that specialize in collection of the lymph from the ISF, and the larger ''lymph vessels'' that propel the lymph forward.

Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed and has no central pump.  Lymph movement occurs  despite low pressure due to [[peristalsis]] (propulsion of the lymph due to alternate contraction and relaxation of [[smooth muscle]]), valves, and compression during contraction of adjacent skeletal muscle and [[arterial]] [[pulse|pulsation]].<ref name=Shayan2006>{{cite journal  | author = Shayan, Ramin; Achen, Marc G.; Stacker, Steven A.

=== Lymph capillaries ===
[[Image:Lymph vessel.png|thumb|200px|left|Propulsion of lymph through lymph vessel]]

The lymphatic circulation begins <!--at the skin--> with blind ending (closed at one end) highly permeable superficial lymph capillaries, formed by endothelial cells with button-like junctions between them that allow fluid to pass through them when the interstitial pressure is sufficiently high.<ref name=baluk>{{cite journal |last= Baluk|first= Peter|coauthors= Jonas Fuxe,  Hiroya Hashizume,  Talia Romano,  Erin Lashnits,  Stefan Butz,  Dietmar Vestweber,  Monica Corad,  Cinzia Molendini,  Elisabetta Dejana,  and  Donald M.

There is another system of semilunar (''semi''=half; ''lunar''=related to the Moon) valves that prevents back-flow of lymph along the lumen of the vessel.<ref name=baluk/> Lymph capillaries have many interconnections ([[anastomoses]]) between them and form a very fine network.<ref name=hollinshead/><!--Like in veins, the [[semilunar valves]] in the lymphatics ensure unidirectional movement of the lymph.-->

Rhythmic contraction of the vessel walls through movements may also help draw fluid into the smallest lymphatic vessels, [[capillary|capillaries]]. <!--Tight clothing can restrict this, thus reducing the removal of wastes and allowing them to accumulate: This is somewhat out of context--[[User:KC Panchal]]--> If tissue fluid builds up the tissue will swell; this is called [[edema]]. As the circular path through the body's system continues, the fluid is then transported to progressively larger lymphatic vessels culminating in the [[right lymphatic duct]] (for lymph from the right upper body) and the [[thoracic duct]] (for the rest of the body); both ducts ''drain'' into the circulatory system at the right and left [[subclavian vein]]s. The system collaborates with white blood cells in lymph nodes to protect the body from being infected by cancer cells, fungi, viruses or bacteria. This is known as a secondary circulatory system.

=== Lymph vessels ===
The lymph capillaries drain the lymph to larger ''contractile'' lymphatics, which have valves as well as smooth muscle walls. These are called the ''collecting [[lymphatics]]''.<ref name=Shayan2006/> As the collecting lymph vessel accumulates lymph from more and more lymph capillaries in its course, it becomes larger and is called the [[afferent lymph vessel]] as it enters a lymph node. Here the lymph percolates through the lymph node tissue and is removed by the [[efferent lymph vessel]]. An efferent lymph vessel may directly drain into one of the ([[Right lymph duct|right]] or [[Thoracic duct|thoracic]]) lymph ducts, or may empty into another lymph node as its afferent lymph vessel.<ref name=hollinshead>{{cite book |last= Rosse|first= Cornelius|coauthors= Penelope Gaddum-Rosse|title= Hollinshead's Textbook of Anatomy|accessdate= 2008-07-09|edition= Fifth|publisher= Lippincott-Raven|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 0-397-51256-2|pages= 72–73|chapter= The Cardiovascular System (Chapter 8)}}</ref> Both the lymph ducts return the lymph to the blood stream by emptying into the [[subclavian vein]]s

The functional unit of a lymph vessel is known as a ''[[lymphangion]]'', which is the segment between two valves. Since it is contractile, depending upon the ratio of its length to its radius, it can act either like a contractile chamber propelling the fluid ahead, or as a resistance vessel tending to stop the lymph in its place.<ref name=venu>{{Cite journal
