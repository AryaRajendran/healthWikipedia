A '''blood test''' is a [[medical laboratory|laboratory]] analysis performed on a [[blood]] sample that is usually extracted from a [[vein]] in the arm using a [[hypodermic needle|needle]], or via [[fingerprick]].  Blood tests are used to determine [[physiological]] and [[biochemical]] states, such as [[disease]], [[mineral]] content, drug effectiveness, and organ function. They are also used in [[drug test]]s.

==Extraction==
[[Venipuncture]] is useful as it is a relatively [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|non-invasive]] way to obtain [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and [[extracellular fluid]] ([[blood plasma|plasma]]) from the body for analysis. Since blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium for providing [[oxygen]] and nutrients, and drawing waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal, the state of the bloodstream affects, or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed [[medical test]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003423.htm | title=Venipuncture - the extraction of blood using a needle and syringe | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>
 
If only a few drops of blood are needed, a [[fingerstick]] is performed instead of drawing blood from a vein.<ref name="pmid17630562">{{cite journal |author=MacLennan CA, van Oosterhout JJ, White SA, Drayson MT, Zijlstra EE, Molyneux ME |title=Finger-prick blood samples can be used interchangeably with venous samples for CD4 cell counting indicating their potential for use in CD4 rapid tests |journal=AIDS (London, England) |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1643–5 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17630562 |pmc=2408852 |doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e32823bcb03 |url=}}</ref>

[[Phlebotomist]]s, [[medical laboratory|laboratory practitioners]] and [[nurse]]s are those charged with patient blood extraction. However, in special circumstances, and emergency situations, [[paramedic]]s and [[physician]]s sometimes extract blood. Also, [[respiratory therapist]]s are trained to extract arterial blood for [[arterial blood gas]]es.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aaron SD, Vandemheen KL, Naftel SA, Lewis MJ, Rodger MA |title=Topical tetracaine prior to arterial puncture: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial |journal=Respir Med. |volume=97 |issue=11 |pages=1195–1199 |year=2003 |pmid=14635973  |doi=10.1016/S0954-6111(03)00226-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/careers/0,1607,7-170-46398-64537--,00.html |title=http://www.michigan.gov/careers/0,1607,7-170-46398-64537-,00.html |publisher=Michigan.gov |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>

==Types of blood tests==
[[File:Blood test.jpg|right|thumb|Samples of human blood collected for testing. The [[barcode]]s contain information that is used to identify the individual from whom the sample was taken and the blood test requested.]]

===Biochemical analysis===
A [[basic metabolic panel]] measures [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[bicarbonate]], [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN), [[magnesium]], [[creatinine]], [[glucose]], and sometimes includes [[calcium]].  Blood tests focusing on cholesterol levels can determine [[LDL cholesterol|LDL]] and [[HDL cholesterol]] levels, as well as [[triglyceride]] levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ldlhdlcholesterollevels.org/|title=Cholesterol Levels|last=Belargo|first=Kevin|publisher=Manic EP|accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>

Some blood tests, such as those that measure [[glucose]], [[cholesterol]], or for determining the existence or lack of [[sexually-transmitted disease|STD]], require fasting (or no food consumption) eight to twelve hours prior to the drawing of the blood sample.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1018.aspx?CategoryID=69&SubCategoryID=693 | title=Fasting blood samples | publisher=NHS UK | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>

For the majority of blood tests, blood is usually obtained from the patient's vein. However, other specialized blood tests, such as the [[arterial blood gas]], require blood extracted from an [[artery]]. Blood gas analysis of arterial blood is primarily used to monitor [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]] levels related to [[pulmonary]] function, but it is also used to measure blood [[pH]] and [[bicarbonate]] levels for certain metabolic conditions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-gases-test/Pages/Introduction.aspx | title=Blood gases | publisher=NHS UK | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>

While the regular [[glucose test]] is taken at a certain point in time, the [[glucose tolerance test]] involves repeated testing to determine the rate at which [[glucose]] is processed by the body.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003466.htm | title=Glucose tolerance test | publisher=Medline | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>

===Molecular profiles===
* [[Protein electrophoresis]] (general technique—not a specific test)
* [[Western blot]] (general technique—not a specific test)
* [[Liver function tests]]
* [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (DNA). [[DNA profiling]] is today possible with even very small quantities of blood: this is commonly used in [[forensic science]], but is now also part of the diagnostic process of many disorders.
* [[Northern blot]] (RNA)
* [[Sexually transmitted disease]]s

===Cellular evaluation===
* [[Full blood count]] (or "complete blood count")
* [[Hematocrit]] and [[mean corpuscular volume|MCV]] ("mean corpuscular volume")
* [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR)
* [[Cross-matching]]. Determination of [[blood type]] for [[blood transfusion]] or [[Organ transplant|transplants]]
* [[Blood culture]]s are commonly taken if infection is suspected. Positive cultures and resulting sensitivity results are often useful in guiding medical treatment.

==Future alternatives==

===Saliva tests===
In 2008, scientists announced that the more cost effective [[saliva testing]] could eventually replace some blood tests, as saliva contains 20% of the proteins found in blood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=49062&sectionid=3510210 |title=Press TV - Saliva test to substitute blood test |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>

===Microemulsion===
February 2011: Canadian researchers have developed a microchip for blood tests. It is called microemulsion, a droplet of blood captured inside a layer of another substance. It can control the exact size and spacing of the droplets. The new test could improve the efficiency, accuracy and speed of laboratory tests while also doing it cheaply. The microchip costs $25, whereas the robotic dispensers currently in use cost around $10,000.

===SIMBAS===
March 2011: A team of researchers from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], [[Dublin City University|DCU]] and [[University of Valparaíso]] have developed [[lab-on-a-chip]] that can diagnose diseases within 10 minutes without the use of external tubing and extra components. It is called Self-powered Integrated Microfluidic Blood Analysis System (SIMBAS). It uses tiny trenches to separate blood cells from plasma (99 percent of blood cells were captured during experiments). Researchers used plastic components, to reduce manufacturing costs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Kate|title=Blood analysis chip detects diseases in minutes|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/general-sciences-features/54744-blood-analysis-chip-detects-diseases-in-minutes|accessdate=2011-03-26|date=2011-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dailey|first=Jessica|title=New SIMBAS Blood Analysis Biochip Can Diagnose Diseases In Minutes|url=http://inhabitat.com/new-simbas-blood-analysis-biochip-can-diagnose-diseases-in-minutes/|publisher=Inhabitat.com|accessdate=2011-03-26|date=2011-03-22}}</ref>
