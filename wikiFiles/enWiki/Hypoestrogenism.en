'''Hypoestrogenism''', or '''estrogen deficiency''', refers to a lower than normal level of [[estrogen]], the primary sex hormone for women. In general, lower levels of estrogen may cause differences in the breasts, genitals, urinary tract and skin.

Hypoestrogenism is most commonly found in women who are postmenopausal, have premature ovarian failure, or are suffering from [[amenorrhoea]]; however, it is also associated with [[hyperprolactinaemia]] and the use of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog]]s in treatment of [[endometriosis]]. Additionally, it has also been linked to [[scoliosis]] and young women with [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]].

==Symptoms==
Presentations of depressed estrogen levels include [[hot flash]]es, headaches, and lowered libido. Reduced bone mass density leading to secondary [[osteoporosis]] and atrophic changes such as pH change in the vagina <ref>{{cite web|last=Sartori, Feldner|first=MG, PC, et al.|title=Sexual steroids in urogynecology.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/pubmed/20839956|work=Sexual steroids in urogynecology.|publisher=PubMed|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref> is also linked to hypoestrogenism.
Low levels of estrogen can lead to [[dyspareunia]] and limited genital arousal because of changes in the four layers of the vaginal wall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lara, Useche|first=LA, B, et al.|title=The effects of hypoestrogenism on the vaginal wall: interference with the normal sexual response.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/pubmed/19170834|work=The effects of hypoestrogenism on the vaginal wall: interference with the normal sexual response.|publisher=PubMed|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref> 
Hypoestrogenism is also considered one of the major risk factors for developing uncomplicated urinary tract infections(UTI) in post menopausal women who do not take hormone replacement therapy.

==Treatment==
In patients under long-term therapy, small amounts of estrogens could be given back (“add-back regimen”) through estrogen cremes, estrogen rich foods and supplements to combat such side-effects and to prevent bone wastage. Though long-term patients, both male and female, tend to undergo annual [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA]] scans to appraise bone density.
