'''Alcoholic hepatitis''' is [[hepatitis]] (inflammation of the [[Human liver|liver]]) due to excessive intake of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. It is usually found in association with [[hepatosteatosis]], an early stage of [[alcoholic liver disease]], and may contribute to the progression of fibrosis, leading to [[cirrhosis]] . Symptoms are [[jaundice]], [[ascites]] (fluid accumulation in the [[abdominal cavity]]), [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[hepatic encephalopathy]] ([[Human brain|brain]] dysfunction due to [[liver failure]]). Mild cases are self-limiting, but severe cases have a high risk of [[death]]. Severe cases may be treated with [[glucocorticoids]].

==Symptoms and signs==

Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by a variable constellation of symptoms, which may include feeling unwell, enlargement of the liver, development of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), and modest elevation of liver [[enzyme]] levels (as determined by [[liver function tests]]).  Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from mild with only liver enzyme elevation to severe liver inflammation with development of jaundice, prolonged [[prothrombin time]], and even liver failure.  Severe cases are characterized by either [[obtundation]] (dulled consciousness) or the combination of elevated [[bilirubin]] levels and prolonged prothrombin time; the mortality rate in both severe categories is 50% within 30 days of onset.

Alcoholic hepatitis is distinct from cirrhosis caused by long-term alcohol consumption.  Alcoholic hepatitis can occur in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis.  Alcoholic hepatitis by itself does not lead to cirrhosis, but cirrhosis is more common in patients with long term alcohol consumption.  Some alcoholics develop acute hepatitis as an inflammatory reaction to the cells affected by [[Steatosis|fatty change]]. This is not directly related to the dose of alcohol. Some people seem more prone to this reaction than others.  This is called alcoholic [[Fat cell|steato]][[necrosis]] and the inflammation probably predisposes to liver [[fibrosis]].

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made in a patient with history of significant alcohol intake who develops worsening [[liver function tests]], including elevated [[bilirubin]] and aminotransferases.  The ratio of [[aspartate aminotransferase]] to [[alanine aminotransferase]] is usually 2 or more.<ref name="pmid10201476">{{cite journal |author=Sorbi D, Boynton J, Lindor KD |title=The ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase: potential value in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from alcoholic liver disease |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1018–22 |year=1999 |pmid=10201476|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.01006.x}}</ref><!-- This elevation in AST is secondary to its induction by ethanol.--> In most cases, the liver enzymes do not exceed 500.  The changes on liver biopsy are important in confirming a clinical diagnosis.

==Pathophysiology==
Some signs and pathological changes in liver histology include:
* [[Mallory body|Mallory's hyaline body]] - a condition where pre-keratin filaments accumulate in [[hepatocytes]]. This sign is not limited to alcoholic liver disease, but is often characteristic.<ref name="robspath">{{cite book | title=Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease| last=Cotran| coauthors=Kumar, Collins| publisher=W.B Saunders Company| location=Philadelphia| isbn=0-7216-7335-X | year=1998}}</ref>
* [[Ballooning degeneration]] - hepatocytes in the setting of alcoholic change often swell up with excess fat, water and [[proteins|protein]]; normally these proteins are exported into the bloodstream. Accompanied with ballooning, there is necrotic damage. The swelling is capable of blocking nearby biliary ducts, leading to diffuse [[cholestasis]].<ref name="robspath" />
* [[Inflammation]] - [[neutrophil]]ic invasion is triggered by the necrotic changes and presence of cellular debris within the [[lobules]]. Ordinarily the amount of debris is removed by [[Kupffer cells]], although in the setting of inflammation they become overloaded, allowing other white cells to spill into the [[parenchyma]]. These cells   to hepatocytes with Mallory bodies.<ref name="robspath" />
If chronic liver disease is also present:
* [[Fibrosis]]
* [[Cirrhosis]] - a progressive and permanent type of fibrotic degeneration of liver tissue.

==Treatment and management==
[[Clinical practice guidelines]] by the [[American College of Gastroenterology]] recommend corticosteroids.<ref name="pmid9820369">{{cite journal |author=McCullough AJ, O'Connor JF |title=Alcoholic liver disease: proposed recommendations for the American College of Gastroenterology |journal=Am.

Patients with a [[modified Maddrey's discriminant function]] score > 32 or hepatic encephalopathy should be considered for treatment with [[prednisolone]] 40&nbsp;mg daily for four weeks followed by a taper.<ref name="pmid9820369"/>
