In [[radiotherapy]], '''radiation treatment planning''' is the process in which a team consisting of [[radiation oncologists]], [[radiation therapist]], [[Medical physics|medical physicists]] and [[Dosimetrist|medical dosimetrists]] plan the appropriate external beam [[radiotherapy]] or internal [[brachytherapy]] treatment technique for a patient with [[cancer]]. 

Typically, medical imaging (i.e., [[computed tomography]] often the primary image set for treatment planning, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] excellent secondary image set for soft tissue contouring, and [[positron emission tomography]] less commonly used and reserved for cases where specific uptake studies can enhance planning target volume delineation) are used to form a ''virtual patient'' for a computer-aided design procedure. Treatment simulations are used to plan the geometric, radiological, and dosimetric aspects of the therapy using radiation transport simulations and [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For [[intensity modulated radiation therapy]] ([[IMRT]]), this process involves selecting the appropriate beam energy (photons, and perhaps protons), energy (e.g. 6 [[MV]], 18 MV) and arrangements. For [[brachytherapy]], involves selecting the appropriate catheter positions and source dwell times<ref>

Plans are often assessed with the aid of [[dose-volume histogram]]s, allowing the clinician to evaluate the uniformity of the dose to the diseased tissue (tumor) and sparing of healthy structures.

Today, treatment planning is almost entirely computer based using patient [[computed tomography]] (CT) data sets. Modern treatment planning systems provide tools for multimodality image matching, also known as image coregistration or fusion.

==Forward planning==

Forward planning is a technique used in [[Radiotherapy|external-beam radiotherapy]] to produce a treatment plan.  In forward planning, a treatment [[oncologist]] places beams into a radiotherapy [[treatment planning]] system which can deliver sufficient radiation to a [[tumour]] while both sparing critical [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and minimising the dose to healthy tissue.  The required decisions include how many radiation beams to use, which angles each will be delivered from, whether attenuating [[Wedge (radiotherapy)|wedges]] be used, and which [[multileaf collimator]] configuration will be used to shape the radiation from each beam.

Once the treatment planner has made an initial plan, the treatment planning system calculates the required monitor units to deliver a prescribed dose to a specific area in the patient which is dependant on beam modifiers that include wedges, specialized collimation, field sizes, tumor depth, etc.  The information from a prior [[CT scan]] of the patient allows more accurate modeling of the behaviour of the radiation as it travels through the patient's tissues.  Different dose prediction models are available, including [[pencil beam]], [[convolution-superposition]] and [[Monte Carlo method|monte carlo simulation]], with precision versus computation time being the relevant trade-off.

This type of planning is used for the majority of external-beam radiotherapy treatments, but is only sufficiently adept to handle relatively simple cases—cases in which the tumour has a simple shape and is not near any critical organs.  For more sophisticated plans, [[inverse planning]] is used to create an [[IMRT|intensity-modulated treatment plan]]. This is now also used as a part of post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) planning.

==Inverse planning==

Inverse planning is a technique used to design a [[radiotherapy]] treatment plan. A radiation oncologist defines a patient's critical organs and tumour and gives target doses and importance factors for each.  Then, an optimisation program is run to find the treatment plan which best matches all the input criteria.

The term "inverse planning" is somewhat of a misnomer; it was devised in contrast to the manual trial-and-error process known in  oncology as "[[forward planning]]".  It has stuck for historical reasons.  Outside of the field of oncology, this procedure would be better described as "automated [[planning]]".

HIPO ([http://www.pi-medical.gr/development/hipo/ Hybrid Inverse Planning & Optimization]), developed by Pi-Medical Ltd., is one algorithm.
