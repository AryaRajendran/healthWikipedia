== History ==
Over a third of a century ago – in 1971 – a meeting was convened in Cambridge as a result of one grandmother's search to find out why her baby grandson had died suddenly and unexpectedly. This gathering led to the founding of the world's first organisation devoted to research, information and support in the field of infant deaths. 

Since FSID teamed up with the Department of Heath to launch the campaign to reduce the risk of cot death in 1991, the UK cot death rate has fallen by 75%, and has been hailed one of the most successful [[public health]] campaigns ever, estimated to have saved more than 20,000 lives.

FSID has gone on to become one of the world's leading authorities on cot death, the UK's largest funder of [[medical research]] into sudden infant death, the main source of support for bereaved families and a major information provider.{{cn|date=January 2013}}
