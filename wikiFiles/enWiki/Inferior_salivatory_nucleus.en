In the [[brain]], the '''inferior salivatory nucleus''' is a cluster of [[neuron]]s controlling the [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] input to the [[parotid gland]]. It is one of the components of the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] ([[cranial nerve]] IX).

==Location==
Its precise location in humans has not yet been identified, but in other mammals it is located in the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] within the [[general visceral efferent]] cell column, superior to the [[nucleus ambiguus]] and inferior to the [[superior salivatory nucleus]].

==Pathway==
While still in the medulla, fibers of the inferior salivatory nucleus join with fibers of the [[gustatory nucleus]], [[nucleus ambiguus]], and [[trigeminal nerve|spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve]], and exit the medulla as the mixed [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] ([[cranial nerve]] IX). It sends fibers through the glossopharyngeal nerve's [[tympanic nerve]] and into the [[tympanic plexus]]. Exiting the plexus within the [[lesser petrosal nerve]], these preganglionic fibers synapse with cells in the [[otic ganglion]], which send postganglionic fibers into the [[mandibular nerve|mandibular division]] of the [[trigeminal nerve]], then into the [[auriculotemporal nerve]], finally reaching their target, the [[parotid gland]].

==Function==
Parasympathetic input from fibers of the inferior salivatory nucleus stimulates the parotid gland to [[vasodilation|vasodilate]] and secrete [[saliva]].
