'''Mario Ramberg Capecchi''' ([[Verona]], [[Italy]], 6 October 1937) is an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[United States|American]] molecular [[geneticist]] and a co-winner of the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for discovering a method to create mice in which a specific gene is turned off, known as ([[knockout mouse|knockout mice]]).<ref>{{cite pmid|2822260}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/336348a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|6256082}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|1673020}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|3002636}}</ref> He shared the prize with [[Martin Evans]] and [[Oliver Smithies]].<ref name = "Nobel 2007">{{cite web

==Life==
Mario Capecchi was born in the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Verona]] as the only child of Luciano Capecchi, an Italian airman who would be later reported as missing in action while manning an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]] in the [[Western Desert Campaign]],<ref name="RepubblicaItalia2007-10"/><!-- was it in Libya or in Ethiopia? the sources cite the "African front" but there were actually two --> and Lucy Ramberg, an American-born<ref name="DeseretNews2007_10_08">{{cite web|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695216829,00.html|title=U. scientist Capecchi wins Nobel Prize|author=Lois M.

He almost died of malnutrition. His mother, meanwhile, had been freed from Dachau and began a year-long search for him. She finally found him in a hospital bed in [[Reggio Emilia]],<ref name="RepubblicaItalia2007-10"/> ill with a fever and subsisting on a daily bowl of [[chicory]] coffee and bread crust. She took him to Rome, where he had his first bath in six years.<ref name="WashingtonPost2007_10_10">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/08/AR2007100800252_pf.html|title=From Child on Street to Nobel Laureate|author=Christopher Lee|date=2007-10-10|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref>

In 1946 his uncle, [[Edward Ramberg]], an American physicist at [[RCA]], sent his mother money to return to the United States. He and his mother moved to [[Pennsylvania]] to live at an "intentionally cooperative community" called [[Bryn Gweled]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/r/ramberg.htm|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|title=Edward G.

Taylor}}</ref>) He graduated from [[George School]], a Quaker boarding school in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], in 1956.<ref name="SusanSample"/>

Mario Capecchi received his [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] in 1961 from [[Antioch College]] in [[Ohio]]. Capecchi came to [[MIT]] as a graduate student intending to study physics and mathematics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article3041565.ece|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|title=Mario Capecchi: The man who changed our world|author=Andrew Gumbel|date=2007-10-09}}</ref> but during the course of his studies, he became interested in molecular biology.  He subsequently transferred to Harvard to join the lab of [[James D. Watson]], co-discoverer of the structure of DNA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N46/nobel.html|title=Two Nobel Prize Winners MIT-Affiliated|author=Arkajit Dey|date=2007-10-16|publisher=''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]''}}</ref> Capecchi received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[biophysics]] in 1967<ref name="capecchiphd">{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Mario|last=Capecchi |title=On the Mechanism of Suppression and Polypeptide Chain Initiation |publisher=Harvard University |date=1967 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302261581|authorlink=Mario Capecchi}}</ref> from [[Harvard University]], with his doctoral thesis completed under the tutelage of Watson.

Capecchi was a Junior Fellow of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University from 1967 to 1969. In 1969 he became an Assistant Professor in the Department of [[Biochemistry]] at [[Harvard Medical School]]. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971. In 1973 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah. Since 1988 Capecchi has also been an investigator of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]. He is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. He has given a talk for [[Duke University]]'s Program in Genetics and Genomics as part of their Distinguished Lecturer Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upg.duke.edu/seminars/distinguished.html|title=Distinguished Lecture Series|publisher=[[Duke University]]}}</ref> He was the speaker for the 2010 Racker Lectures in Biology & Medicine and Cornell Distinguished Lecture in Cell and Molecular Biology at [[Cornell University]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.cornell.edu/event/mbg_annual_racker_lecture|title=MBG Annual Racker Lecture|publisher=[[Cornell University]]}}</ref>

After the Nobel committee publicly announced that Capecchi had won the Nobel prize, an [[Austria]]n woman named Marlene Bonelli claimed that Capecchi was her long-lost half-brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article3073785.ece|title=Reunion beckons for Nobel winner and his long lost step-sister|author=Peter Popham|date=2007-10-18|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]}}</ref>
In May 2008, Capecchi met with Bonelli, 69, in northern Italy, and confirmed that she was his sister.<ref>"'Looking at the pictures, it was obviously my sister,' Capecchi said, noting her resemblance to their mother."{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=5018719|title=Nobel Winner Reunited With Sister Lost in WWII|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=2008-06-06|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref>

==Knockout mice==
Capecchi is particularly well known for his pioneering work in gene targeting of the mouse embryo-derived stem cells, working on the [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] (a genetically engineered mouse in which one or more genes have been turned off through a targeted mutation). This work was accomplished together with the efforts of [[Martin Evans]] and [[Oliver Smithies]], and recognized in the  2007 Nobel prize for medicine or physiology.<ref name="SusanSample"/>

Capecchi has also pursued a systematic analysis of the mouse [[Hox gene]] family. This gene family plays a key role in the control of [[embryonic development]] in all [[multicellular animal]]s.
