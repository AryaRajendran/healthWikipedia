'''Soranus''' (1st/2nd century AD) was a [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physician]] from [[Ephesus]]. He practiced in [[Alexandria]] and subsequently in [[Rome]], and was one of the chief representatives of the [[Methodic school]] of medicine. Several of his writings still survive, most notably his four-volume treatise on [[gynaecology]], and a Latin translation of his ''On Acute and Chronic Diseases''.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Soranus. According to the [[Suda]] (which has two entries on him)<ref>Suda, ''Soranos'', σ851, σ852</ref> he was a native of [[Ephesus]], was the son of Menander and Phoebe, and practised medicine at [[Alexandria]] and [[Rome]] in the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]] (98-138). He lived at least as early as [[Archigenes]], who used one of his medicines;<ref>ap. ''Aët.'' ii. 2. 55</ref> he was tutor to [[Attalus]]; and he was dead when [[Galen]] wrote his work ''De Methodo Medendi'', c. 178.<ref>Galen, ''De Meth. Med.'', i. 7. vol. x.</ref>

He belonged to the [[Methodic school]],<ref>Pseudo-Galen, ''Introd.'' c. 4, vol. xiv.</ref> and was one of the most eminent physicians of that school. Little else is known about his life, except that he passed some time in [[Aquitania]] for the purpose of treating some skin diseases which were very prevalent there at the time.<ref>Marcellus Empiricus, ''De Medicam.'' c. 19</ref>

==Works==
His treatise ''[[Gynaecology]]'' is extant (first printed in 1838, later by [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|V. Rose]], in [http://books.google.com/books?id=3-CeNbbVox8C 1882], with a 6th-century Latin translation by one [[Muscio]]).  Also extant are parts of treatises ''On Signs of Fractures'' and ''On Bandages''.  Of his most important work (''On Acute and Chronic Diseases'') only a few fragments in Greek remain, but we possess a complete Latin translation by [[Caelius Aurelianus]] (5th century). The ''Life of [[Hippocrates]]'' probably formed one of the collection of medical biographies by Soranus referred to in the Suda, and is valuable as the only authority for the life of the great physician, with the exception of articles in the Suda and in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] (s.v. {{lang|grc|Κώς}}). The ''Introduction to the Science of Medicine''<ref>V. Rose, ''Anecdota graeca'', ii. 1870</ref> is considered spurious. 

Besides these works, Soranus was the author of several others, of which only the titles and some fragments have been preserved. Galen mentions two works on ''Pharmacy'', from which he quotes some passages.<ref>Galen, ''De Compos. Medicam. sec. Loc.'', i. 2, vi. 7, 8, vii. 2. vol. xii., xiii. 42</ref> [[Caelius Aurelianus]] quotes from several other works,<ref>Caelius Aurelianus, ''De Morb. Acut.'', ii. 29, 33; ''De Morb. Chron.'', i. 3, iv. 1</ref> and Soranus himself refers to many additional works which have not survived.<ref>Soranus, ''De Arte Obst.'', passim.</ref> [[Tertullian]] quotes a work ''De Anima'', in four books,<ref>Tertullian, ''De Anima'', cc. 8, 15, 25, 44</ref> in which Soranus divided the [[soul]] into seven parts,<ref>Tertullian, ''De Anima'', c. 14</ref> and denied its immortality.<ref name="frog1">Tertullian, ''De Anima'', c. 6</ref> He is quoted by [[Paulus Aegineta]],<ref>Paulus Aegineta, iv. 59</ref> as being one of the earliest Greek medical writers who had described the [[Guinea Worm]]; and he appears to have enjoyed a great reputation among the ancients, as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] calls him "Medicinae auctor nobilissimus,"<ref>Augustine, ''Cont. Julian'', v. 51</ref> and Tertullian, "Methodicae Medicinae instructissimus auctor."<ref name="frog1"/>
