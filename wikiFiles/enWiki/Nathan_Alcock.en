==Early life and education==

Nathan Alcock was born at [[Aston, Vale Royal|Aston]], near [[Runcorn]], [[Cheshire]], the second son of David Alcock and his wife Mary née Breck.<ref>{{cite book | last =Starkey | first =H.

==Medical career==

He returned to England and went to [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].  Here he found that one of the [[professor]]s in the medical faculty gave no lectures and the other did not reside there.  He therefore began to give unauthorised lectures in [[anatomy]] and [[chemistry]].  This led to opposition from the professors who argued that his [[Theology|theological]] opinions were unsound.  However his lectures were popular with the students and he was supported by eminent people including [[William Blackstone]] and [[Robert Lowth]] (who was later [[Bishop of London]]).  In 1741 he was granted the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] and was incorporated from [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]].<ref name="nick"/>  He graduated [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|B.M.]] in 1744, and M.D. in 1749. Also in 1749 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and in 1754 was made Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], London.<ref name="dnb"/>

He built up a large practice in [[Oxford]] and became very wealthy.<ref name="nick"/>  However, possibly because of ill health,<ref name="chalmers"/> or following the death of a woman he intended to marry,<ref name="dnb"/> he returned to Runcorn.  Here he built up a practice as large as his practice had been in Oxford.<ref name="nick"/>  He died from a [[stroke]] in Runcorn in 1779 and was buried in the [[parish church]] there.<ref name="chalmers"/>

Politically he was a [[British Whig Party|whig]] and theologically he was a follower of [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]].  His Leiden [[thesis]] was on [[pneumonia]].  He published nothing during his lifetime but his brother [[Thomas Alcock (clergyman)|Thomas]], vicar of Runcorn, edited and published his ''The Rise of Mahomet, Accounted for on Natural and Civil Principles'' in 1796.<ref name="dnb"/>  Also after Nathan's death, in 1780, Thomas Alcock published his [[biography]] entitled ''Some Memoirs of the Life of Dr. Nathan Alcock''.<ref name="nick"/>
