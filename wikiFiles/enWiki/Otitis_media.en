'''Otitis media''' ([[Latin]] for "inflammation of the middle ear") is the medical term for [[middle ear]] infection. Although several subtypes of otitis media are distinguished, the term is often used synonymously with ''acute otitis media''. It is very common in childhood.

==Causes==
The common cause of all forms of otitis media is blockage of the [[Eustachian tube]]. This is usually due to swelling of the [[mucous membranes]] in the [[nasopharynx]], which in turn can be caused by a viral [[upper respiratory infection]] or by [[allergy|allergies]].<ref name="John D Donaldson">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/859316-overview#aw2aab6b2b4aa |title=Acute Otitis Media |author=John D Donaldson |publisher=Medscape |accessdate= 17 March 2013}}</ref> Because of the blockage of the Eustachian tube, the air volume in the middle ear is trapped and parts of it are slowly absorbed by the surrounding tissues, leading to a mild [[vacuum]] in the middle ear. Eventually the vacuum can reach a point where fluid from the surrounding tissues is sucked in to the middle ear's cavity (also called [[tympanic cavity]]), causing middle ear effusion. This is seen as a progression from a Type A [[tympanogram]] to a Type C to a Type B tympanogram. 

By reflux or suction of material from the nasopharynx into the normally sterile middle ear space, the fluid may then become infected - usually with [[bacteria]]. In rare cases, however, the virus that caused the initial upper respiratory tract infection can itself be identified as the [[pathogen]] causing the infection in the middle ear.<ref name="John D Donaldson"/>

An integral symptom of acute otitis media is ear pain; other possible symptoms include fever, and irritability (in infants). Since an acute otitis media is usually precipitated by an upper respiratory tract infection, there often are accompanying symptoms like cough and nasal discharge.<ref name=AAP2013/>

==Diagnosis==
As its typical symptoms overlap with other conditions, clinical history alone is not sufficient to predict whether acute otitis media is present; it has to be complemented by visualization of the [[tympanic membrane]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Laine MK, Tähtinen PA, Ruuskanen O, Huovinen P, Ruohola A |title=Symptoms or symptom-based scores cannot predict acute otitis media at otitis-prone age |journal=Pediatrics |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=e1154–61 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20368317 |doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2689 }}</ref>

To confirm the diagnosis, middle ear effusion and inflammation of the eardrum have to be identified; signs of these are fullness, bulging, cloudiness and redness of the eardrum.<ref name=AAP2013>{{cite journal|last=Lieberthal|first=AS|coauthors=Carroll, AE; Chonmaitree, T; Ganiats, TG; Hoberman, A; Jackson, MA; Joffe, MD; Miller, DT; Rosenfeld, RM; Sevilla, XD; Schwartz, RH; Thomas, PA; Tunkel, DE|title=The Diagnosis and Management of Acute Otitis Media.|journal=Pediatrics|date=2013 Feb 25|pmid=23439909}}</ref> Viral otitis may also result in blisters on the external side of the tympanic membrane, which is called ''bullous myringitis'' (''myringa'' being Latin for "eardrum")<ref name="bm">{{cite journal|author=Roberts DB |title=The etiology of bullous myringitis and the role of mycoplasmas in ear disease: a review|journal=Pediatrics |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=761–6 |year=1980 |month=April |pmid=7367083 }}</ref>

However, sometimes even examination of the eardrum may not be able to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the canal is small and there is wax in the ear that obscures a clear view of the eardrum. Also, an upset child's crying can cause the eardrum to look inflamed due to distension of the small blood vessels on it, mimicking the redness associated with otitis media.

==Subtypes==

===Acute otitis media===
Acute otitis media (AOM) is usually developing on the basis of a (viral) [[Upper respiratory tract infection|upper respiratory infection]] with blockage of the [[Eustachian tube]] and effusion in the middle ear, when the fluid in the middle ear gets additionally infected with bacteria. The most common bacteria found in this case are [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], [[Haemophilus influenzae]], and [[Moraxella catarrhalis]].<ref name="AAP2013"/>

===Otitis media with effusion===
Otitis media with effusion (OME), also called serous or secretory otitis media (SOM) or glue ear,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Glue-ear/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Glue Ear |work=NHS Choices |publisher=Department of Health |accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> is simply a collection of fluid that occurs within the middle ear space due to the negative pressure produced by altered Eustachian tube function. This can occur purely from a viral URI, with no pain or bacterial infection, or it can precede and/or follow acute bacterial otitis media. Fluid in the middle ear sometimes causes conductive hearing impairment, but only when it interferes with the normal vibration of the eardrum by sound waves. Over weeks and months, middle ear fluid can become very thick and glue-like (thus the name glue ear), which increases the likelihood of its causing [[Conductive hearing loss|conductive hearing impairment]]. Early-onset OME is associated with feeding while lying down and early entry into group [[child care]], parental [[smoking]], too short a period of [[breastfeeding]] and greater amounts of time spent in group child care increased the duration of OME in the first two years of life.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Owen MJ, Baldwin CD, Swank PR, Pannu AK, Johnson DL, Howie VM |title=Relation of infant feeding practices, cigarette smoke exposure, and group child care to the onset and duration of otitis media with effusion in the first two years of life |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=123 |issue=5 |pages=702–11 |year=1993 |pmid=8229477 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(05)80843-1}}</ref>

===Chronic suppurative otitis media===
Chronic suppurative otitis media involves a perforation (hole) in the tympanic membrane and active bacterial infection within the middle ear space for several weeks or more. There may be enough pus that it drains to the outside of the ear (otorrhea), or the [[purulence]] may be minimal enough to only be seen on examination using a binocular microscope. This disease is much more common in persons with poor Eustachian tube function. Hearing impairment often accompanies this disease.

===Adhesive otitis media===
Adhesive otitis media has occurred when a thin [[tympanic membrane retraction|retracted ear drum]] becomes sucked into the middle ear space and stuck, i.e. adherent, to the [[ossicle]]s and other bones of the middle ear.

==Complications==
Complications of acute otitis media consist in perforation of the ear drum, [[mastoiditis|infection of the mastoid space behind the ear]], or [[bacterial meningitis]] in rare cases.<ref name=Mastoiditis>{{cite journal |journal=Bosn J Basic Med Sci. |date=2007 May |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=127–31 |title=Acute mastoiditis in children: susceptibility factors and management |author=Spremo S, Udovcić B |pmid=17489747}}</ref><ref name=BactMen>{{cite journal |title=Recherche et prise en charge de la porte d'entrée ORL des méningites aiguës bactériennes communautaires |journal=Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses |date=2009 Jul-Aug |volume=39 |issue=7–8 |pages=554–9 |trans_title=Diagnosis and management of ENT conditions responsible for acute community acquired bacterial meningitis |language=French |author=Klossek JM |pmid=19419828|doi=10.1016/j.medmal.2009.02.027 }}</ref>

===Rupture===
In severe or untreated cases, the tympanic membrane may [[tympanic membrane perforation|rupture]], allowing the [[pus]] in the middle ear space to drain into the [[ear canal]]. If there is enough of it, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the rupture of the tympanic membrane suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, it is almost always associated with the dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute otitis media in an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses are likely to resolve the [[infection]] and the ear drum nearly always heals.

Children with recurrent episodes of acute otitis media and those with otitis media with effusion or chronic otitis media, have higher risks of developing [[conductive hearing loss|conductive]] and [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Globally approximately 141&nbsp;million people have mild hearing loss due to otitis media (2.1% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012/> This is more common in males (2.3%) than females (1.8%).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607}}</ref>

This hearing loss is mainly due to fluid in the middle ear or rupture of the tympanic membrane. Prolonged duration of otitis media is associated with ossicular complications, and together with persistent tympanic membrane perforation contributes to the severity of both the disease and the hearing loss. When a cholesteatoma or granulation tissue is present in the middle ear, the degree of hearing loss and ossicular destruction is even greater.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Da Costa SS |title=Sensorineural hearing loss in patients with chronic otitis media |journal=Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol |volume=266 |issue=2 |pages=221–4 |date=February 2009 |doi=10.1007/s00405-008-0739-0 |pmid=18629531 |last2=Rosito |first2=Letícia Petersen Schmidt |last3=Dornelles |first3=Cristina}}</ref>

==Treatment==

===Symptomatic===
Oral and topical [[analgesics]] are effective to treat the pain caused by otitis media. Oral agents include [[ibuprofen]], [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), and [[opiates]]. Topical agents shown to be effective include [[antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Best evidence topic reports. Bet 1.

===Antibiotics===
{{update|section|{{doi|10.1002/ebch.1839}} |date=April 2013}}
It is important to weigh the benefits and harms before using antibiotics for acute otitis media. As over 80% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one [[perforation]], and 11 children to prevent one opposite side ear infection. The harms include, for every 14 children treated one child has an episode of either vomiting, diarrhea or a rash.<ref name=Venekamp2013>{{cite Cochrane |review=CD000219 |version=3 |last=Venekamp|first=Roderick P|coauthors=Sharon Sanders2, Paul P Glasziou, Chris B Del Mar, Maroeska M Rovers |title=Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children (Systematic Review) |date=31 January 2013 |issue=1 |pmid=14973951|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000219.pub3/abstract}}</ref> Deferring the start of antibiotics in acute otitis media for one to three days if pain is manageable with analgesics is currently recommended.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Damoiseaux R | title = Antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media: time to think again | journal = [[CMAJ]] | volume = 172 | issue = 5 | pages = 657–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15738492 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.050078 | pmc = 550637}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Marchetti F, Ronfani L, Nibali S, Tamburlini G | title = Delayed prescription may reduce the use of antibiotics for acute otitis media: a prospective observational study in primary care | journal = [[Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med]] | volume = 159 | issue = 7 | pages = 679–84 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15997003 | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.159.7.679}}</ref> 

The first line antibiotic treatment, if warranted, is [[amoxicillin]].<ref name=AAP2013/> If there is [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] or use of amoxicillin in the last 30 days then [[co-amoxiclav|amoxicillin-clavulanate]] or another penicillin derivative plus beta lactamase inhibitor is recommended.<ref name=AAP2013/> While less than 7 days of antibiotics have less side effects more than seven days appear to be more effective.<ref>{{cite Cochrane |author=Kozyrskyj A, Klassen TP, Moffatt M, Harvey K |title=Short-course antibiotics for acute otitis media |issue=9 |review=CD001095 |version=2 |year=2010 |pmid=20824827 |editor1-last=Klassen |editor1-first=Terry P }}</ref> Among short-course antibiotics, long-acting [[azithromycin]] was found more likely to be successful than short-acting alternatives.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Indian Pediatr |date=January 2010 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=74–87 |title=Efficacy of short course (<4 days) of antibiotics for treatment of acute otitis media in children: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials |author=Gulani A, Sachdev HP, Qazi SA |pmid=19736367 |doi=10.1007/s13312-010-0010-9}}</ref> If there is no improvement after 2–3&nbsp;days of treatment a change in therapy may be considered.<ref name=AAP2013/>

===Tympanostomy tube===
In chronic cases with effusions, insertion of [[tympanostomy tube]] (also called a "grommet") into the [[eardrum]] reduces recurrence rates in the 6&nbsp;months after placement<ref>{{cite journal |author=McDonald S, Langton Hewer CD, Nunez DA |title=Grommets (ventilation tubes) for recurrent acute otitis media in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD004741 |year=2008 |pmid=18843668 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004741.pub2 |editor1-last=McDonald |editor1-first=Stephen }}</ref> but have little effect on long term hearing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Browning GG, Rovers MM, Williamson I, Lous J, Burton MJ |title=Grommets (ventilation tubes) for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=10 |pages=CD001801 |year=2010 |pmid=20927726 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001801.pub3 |editor1-last=Browning |editor1-first=George G }}</ref> Thus tubes are recommended in those who have more than 3 episodes of acute otitis media in 6 month or 4 in a year associated with an effusion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilson SA, Mayo H, Fisher M |title=Clinical inquiries.
