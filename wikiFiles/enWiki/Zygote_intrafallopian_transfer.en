'''Zygote intrafallopian transfer''' ('''ZIFT''') is an [[infertility treatment]] where a blockage in the [[fallopian tube]]s prevents the normal binding of sperm to the egg. [[Egg cells]] are removed from a woman's [[ovaries]], and [[in vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilised]]. The resulting [[zygote]] is placed into the [[fallopian tube]] by the use of [[laparoscopy]]. The procedure is a spin-off of the [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]] (GIFT) procedure. {{Reference necessary|text=ZIFT has a success rate of 64.8% in all cases.|date=September 2011}}

==Procedure==
The average ZIFT cycle takes five weeks to complete. First, the female must take a [[fertility medication]] to [[ovulation induction|stimulate egg production]] in the ovaries. The doctor will monitor the growth of the [[ovarian follicles]], and once they are mature, the woman will receive an injection containing [[human chorionic gonadotropin]]s (HCG or hCG). The eggs will be harvested approximately 36 hours later, usually by [[transvaginal ovum retrieval]]. After fertilization in the laboratory, the resulting early embryos or zygotes are placed into the woman's fallopian tubes using a [[laparoscope]].

==Indications==
ZIFT has been used in infertility situations where at least one fallopian tube is normal and other treatments have failed; however, the need for two interventions and the fact that [[IVF]] results are equal or better (as of 2004), leaves few indications for this procedure. Accordingly, the number of ZIFTs performed has been declining.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Toner JP| title=Progress we can be proud of: U.S. trends in assisted reproduction over the first 20 years. |journal=Fertil Steril. | pmid=12413976 |year=2002 |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=943â€“50}}</ref>
