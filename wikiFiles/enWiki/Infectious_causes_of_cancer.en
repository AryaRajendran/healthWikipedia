A virus that can cause cancer is called an ''[[oncovirus]]''.  These include [[human papillomavirus]] ([[cervical carcinoma]]), [[Epstein-Barr virus]] ([[B-cell lymphoproliferative disease]] and [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]]), [[Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus]] ([[Kaposi's Sarcoma]] and primary effusion lymphomas), [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]] viruses ([[hepatocellular carcinoma]]), and [[Human T-cell leukemia virus-1]] (T-cell leukemias). Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in [[Helicobacter pylori]]-induced [[gastric carcinoma]].<ref name=Viral04>{{cite journal |author=Pagano JS, Blaser M, Buendia MA, ''et al.'' |title=Infectious agents and cancer: criteria for a causal relation |journal=Semin.

== Viruses ==
According to some authors, viruses are one of the most important risks factor for cancer development in humans, second only to [[tobacco]] use.<ref name="zur Hausen-viruses">{{cite journal | author = zur Hausen H | title = Viruses in human cancers | journal = Science | volume = 254 | issue = 5035 | pages = 1167–73 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1659743| doi = 10.1126/science.1659743}}</ref>  

There are two types of cancers caused by viruses: ''acutely transforming'' or ''slowly transforming'' cancers. In acutely transforming viruses, the virus carries an overactive [[oncogene]], and the infected cell becomes cancerous as soon as the overactive viral gene is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the virus genome is inserted near a previously existing [[proto-oncogene]] in the genome of the infected cell. The virus causes overexpression of that proto-oncogene, which typically induces uncontrolled [[cell division]]. Because the virus' genes might not insert near enough to a proto-oncogene to trigger the cancerous changes, and, even if optimally located, it might take some time to become activated, slowly transforming viruses usually cause tumors much longer after infection than the acutely transforming viruses, if at all.

Infection by some hepatitis viruses, especially [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]], can induce a chronic viral infection that leads to [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] in about 1 in 200 of people infected with [[hepatitis B]] each year (more in Asia, fewer in North America), and in about 1 in 45 of people infected with [[hepatitis C]] each year.<ref name=Sung />  People with chronic hepatitis B infection are more than 200 times more likely to develop liver cancer than uninfected people.<ref name=Sung>{{cite book

Because chronic viral hepatitis is so common, and liver cancer so deadly, liver cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in the world, and is especially common in East Asia and parts of sub-Sarahan Africa.

[[Human papillomavirus]]es (HPV) are another particularly common cancer-causing virus.  HPV is well known for causing [[genital warts]] and essentially all cases of [[cervical cancer]], but it can also infect and cause cancer in several other parts of the body, including the [[larynx]], [[oropharyngeal mucosa|lining of the mouth, nose, and throat]], [[anus]], and [[esophagus]].  The [[Papanicolaou smear]] ("Pap" smear) is a widely used cancer screening test for cervical cancer.  DNA-based tests to identify the virus are also available.<ref>{{cite book

[[Herpesvirus]]es are a third group of common cancer-causing viruses.  Two types of herpesviruses have been associated with cancer:  the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) and [[human herpesvirus 8]] (HHV-8).<ref name=Cohen>{{cite book

HHV-8 causes all cases of [[Kaposi’s sarcoma]], and has been found in some cases of a cancer-related condition called [[Castleman's disease]].<ref name=Cohen />  Studies involving other kinds of cancer, particularly [[prostate cancer]], have been inconsistent.<ref name=Cohen />  Both of these herpesviruses are commonly found in cancerous cells of [[primary effusion lymphoma]].<ref name=Cohen />  Herpesviruses also cause cancer in animals, especially leukemias and lymphomas.<ref name=Cohen />

[[HIV]] does not directly cause cancer, but it is associated with a number of malignancies, especially [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[anal cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]]. Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by [[human herpesvirus 8]].  [[AIDS]]-related cases of anal cancer and cervical cancer are commonly caused by [[human papillomavirus]].  After HIV destroys the immune system, the body is no longer able to control these viruses, and the infections manifest as cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wood C, Harrington W |title=AIDS and associated malignancies |journal=Cell Res. |volume=15 |issue=11-12 |pages=947–52 |year=2005 |pmid=16354573 |doi=10.1038/sj.cr.7290372}}</ref> Certain other immune deficiency states (e.g. [[common variable immunodeficiency]] and [[IgA deficiency]]) are also associated with increased risk of malignancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mellemkjaer L, Hammarstrom L, Andersen V, ''et al.'' |title=Cancer risk among patients with IgA deficiency or common variable immunodeficiency and their relatives: a combined Danish and Swedish study |journal=Clin.

==Bacteria==
In addition to viruses, [[cancer bacteria|certain kinds of bacteria]] can cause some cancers. The most prominent example is the link between chronic infection of the wall of the stomach with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' and [[gastric cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peter S, Beglinger C |title=Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer: the causal relationship |journal=Digestion |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |year=2007 |pmid=17429205 |doi=10.1159/000101564}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang C, Yuan Y, Hunt RH |title=The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and early gastric cancer: a meta-analysis |journal=Am.

== Parasites ==
The [[parasite]]s that cause [[schistosomiasis]] (bilharzia), especially ''[[S. haematobium]]'', can cause [[bladder cancer]] and cancer at other sites.<ref name=Mustacchi>{{cite book

[[Distomiasis]], caused by parasitic [[liver fluke]]s, is associated with [[cholangiocarcinoma]] (cancer of the [[bile duct]]) in East Asia.<ref name=Mustacchi />

[[Malaria]] is associated with [[Burkitt's lymphoma]] in Africa, especially when present in combination with [[Epstein-Barr virus]], although it is unclear whether it is causative.<ref name=Mustacchi />

Parasites are also a significant cause of [[cancer in animals]].  ''Cysticercus fasciolaris'', the larval form of the common tapeworm of the cat, ''Taenia taeniaformis'', causes cancer in rats.<ref name=Mustacchi />  ''Spirocerca lupi'' is associated with [[esophageal cancer]] in dogs, at least within the southern United States.<ref name=Mustacchi />
