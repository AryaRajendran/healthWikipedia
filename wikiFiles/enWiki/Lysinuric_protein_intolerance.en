'''Lysinuric protein intolerance''' (LPI), also called '''hyperdibasic aminoaciduria type 2''','''cationic aminoaciduria''' or '''familial protein intolerance''', is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1155480 |year=1975 |month=August |author=Simell O, Perheentupa J, Rapola J, Visakorpi JK, Eskelin LE |title=Lysinuric protein intolerance |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=229–240 |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+56-41-7 |format=Free full text |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(75)90358-7}}</ref> [[metabolic disorder]] affecting [[amino acid]] transport. 

About 140 patients have been reported, almost half of them of [[Finland|Finnish]] origin. Individuals from Japan, Italy, Morocco and North Africa have also been reported.

==Causes==
It has been associated with [[SLC7A7]].<ref name="pmid10080183">{{cite journal |author=Borsani G, Bassi MT, Sperandeo MP, ''et al.'' |title=SLC7A7, encoding a putative permease-related protein, is mutated in patients with lysinuric protein intolerance |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=297–301 |year=1999 |month=March |pmid=10080183 |doi=10.1038/6815}}</ref>

==Presentation==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Lysinuric protein intolerance has an [[Recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

In LPI, [[urine|urinary]] excretion of cationic amino acids ([[ornithine]], [[arginine]] and [[lysine]]) is increased and these amino acids are poorly absorbed from the [[intestine]]. Therefore, their [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations are low and their body pools become depleted. Deficiency of arginine and ornithine restricts the function of the [[urea cycle]] and leads to [[hyperammonemia]] after [[protein]]-rich meals. Deficiency of lysine may play a major role in the [[skeleton|skeletal]] and [[immunology|immunological]] abnormalities observed in LPI patients. 

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis is based on the [[biochemistry|biochemical]] findings (increased concentrations of lysine, arginine and ornithine in urine and low concentrations of these amino acids in plasma, elevation of urinary [[orotic acid]] excretion after protein-rich meals, and inappropriately high concentrations of serum [[ferritin]] and [[lactate dehydrogenase]] [[isozyme|isoenzymes]]) and the [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] of known [[mutation]]s of the causative [[gene]] from a [[DNA]] sample.

==Symptoms==
[[Infant]]s with LPI are usually [[symptom]]-free when [[breastfeeding|breastfed]] because of the low protein concentration in human [[breast milk|milk]], but develop [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] after weaning. The patients show [[failure to thrive]], poor [[appetite]], [[Human development (biology)|growth]] retardation, enlarged [[liver]] and [[spleen]], prominent [[osteoporosis]] and [[osteopenia]],<ref name=OMIM_LPI>{{OMIM|222700}}</ref> delayed [[bone age]] and spontaneous protein aversion. Forced feeding of protein may lead to [[convulsion]]s and [[coma]]. Mental development is normal if prolonged episode of hyperammonemia can be avoided. Some patients develop severe [[lung|pulmonary]] and [[kidney|renal]] complications. High levels of plasma glutamine and glycine are observed. 

==Treatment and prognosis==
Treatment of LPI consists of protein-restricted [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[dietary supplement|supplementation]] with oral [[citrulline]]. Citrulline is a neutral amino acid that improves the function of the urea cycle and allows sufficient protein intake without hyperammonemia. Under proper dietary control and supplementation, the majority of the LPI patients are able to have a nearly normal life. However, severe complications including [[pulmonary alveolar proteinosis]] and [[renal insufficiency]] may develop even with proper treatment. <ref name="pmid17517249">{{cite journal |author=Tanner LM, Näntö-Salonen K, Niinikoski H, ''et al.'' |title=Nephropathy advancing to end-stage renal disease: a novel complication of lysinuric protein intolerance |journal=J Pediatr. |volume=150 |issue=6 |pages=161–164 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17517249 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2007.01.043}}</ref>

[[Fertility]] appears to be normal in women, but mothers with LPI have an increased risk for complications during [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth|delivery]]. <ref name="pmid16423630">{{cite journal |author=Tanner LM, Näntö-Salonen K, Niinikoski H, ''et al.'' |title=Hazards associated with pregnancies and deliveries in lysinuric protein intolerance |journal=Metabolism |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=224–231 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16423630 |doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2005.08.016}}</ref>
