<!-- alternate names?: '''still bumps''', '''chicken skin''', '''Dasler Bumps''', '''chicken bumps''', '''people humps'''-->

'''Goose bumps''', also called '''goose flesh''', '''goose pimples''', the medical term '''''cutis anserina''''', are the bumps on a person's [[skin]] at the base of body [[hair]]s which may involuntarily develop when a person is [[cold]] or experiences strong emotions such as [[fear]], [[nostalgia]], [[pleasure]], [[euphoria]], [[awe]], admiration and sexual arousal.<ref>http://www.exploratorium.edu/music/questions/goosebumps.html</ref> 

The [[reflex]] of producing goose bumps is known as '''arasing''', '''piloerection''', or the '''pilomotor reflex'''. It occurs in many [[mammal]]s besides humans; a prominent example is [[porcupine]]s, which raise their quills when threatened, or [[sea otter]]s when they encounter sharks or other predators.

Other creatures get goose bumps for the same reason, for example this is why a [[cat]] or [[dog]]’s hair stands on end. In cold situations, the rising hair traps air between the hairs and skin, creating insulation and warmth. In response to fear, goose bumps make an animal appear larger – hopefully scaring away the enemy.

== Etymology ==

The phrase "goose bumps" derives from the phenomenon's association with [[goose]] skin. Goose feathers grow from stores in the epidermis which resemble human [[hair follicle]]s. When a goose's feathers are plucked, its skin has 
protrusions where the feathers were, and these bumps are what the human [[phenomenon]] resembles.

It is not clear why the particular fowl, goose, was chosen in English, as most other birds share this same anatomical feature. Some authors have applied "goose bumps" to the symptoms of sexually-transmitted diseases.<ref>{{citation | title=Heavy words lightly thrown: the reason behind the rhyme | first=Chris | last=Roberts | publisher=Granta | year=2004 | isbn= 978-1-86207-765-2 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MdMZqhMzfpYC&pg=PA24 | page=24}}</ref> Certainly being "bitten by a Winchester goose" was a common euphemism for [[syphilis]]<ref>{{citation | title=Syphilis to-day and among the ancients v. 2-3 | year=1895 | first=Frédéric | last=Buret | publisher= F.A.

However, this seductive etymology does not explain why other languages use the same bird as in English. "Goose skin" is used in [[German language|German]] (''Gänsehaut''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''pelle d'oca''), [[Russian language|Russian]] (гусиная кожа), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (гусяча шкіра), [[Polish language|Polish]] (''gęsia skórka''), [[Czech language|Czech]] (''husí kůže''), [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (''husia koža''), [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (''gåsehud''), [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (''zosāda'') and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (''libabőr''). In other languages, however, the "goose" may be replaced by other kinds of poultry. For instance, "[[Chicken|hen]]" is used in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''piel de gallina''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''pele de galinha''), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (''piele de găină'') and [[French language|French]] (''chair de poule''). "[[Chicken]]" is used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''kippenvel''), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (雞皮疙瘩, lit. ''lumps on chicken skin''), [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (''kananliha''), [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] (''hoendervleis'') and [[Korean language|Korean]] (닭살, ''daksal''). In Hindi/Urdu it is called ''rongtey khade ho jaana''.  The equivalent [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term, 鳥肌, ''torihada'', translates literally as "bird skin". In Arabic, it is called ''kash'arirah'', in Hebrew it is called simply "duck skin" (עור ברווז).

The same effect is manifested in the root word "horror" in [[English language|English]], which is derived from [[Latin]] ''horrere'', which means "to bristle", and "be horrified", because of the accompanying hair reaction.

== Anatomy and biology ==
[[File:Cat-hairs-standing-on-end.jpg|thumb|Cat fur standing on end]]

Goose bumps are created when tiny [[muscle]]s at the base of each [[hair]], known as ''[[arrector pili muscle]]s'', contract and pull the hair erect. The reflex is started by the [[sympathetic nervous system]], which is responsible for many [[fight-or-flight response]]s.

As a response to cold: in animals covered with [[fur]] or hair, the erect hairs trap air to create a layer of [[thermal insulation|insulation]].  Goose bumps can also be a response to anger or fear: the erect hairs make the animal appear larger, in order to intimidate enemies. This can be observed in the intimidation displays of [[chimpanzee]]s,<ref>Martin Muller and John Mitan.

In humans, it can even extend to piloerection as a reaction to hearing nails scratch on a chalkboard, listening to awe-inspiring music,<ref>David Huron. Biological Templates for Musical Experience:

Bubenik. Why do humans get "goosebumps" when they are cold, or under other circumstances? [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu]</ref>
During the formation of goose bumps, the body is warmed from the muscle tension in piloerection.

In humans, goose bumps are strongest on the forearms, but also occur on the legs, neck, and other areas of the skin that have hair. In some people, they even occur in the face or on the head.

In humans, the [[areolas]] of the breasts of females typically show piloerection because of hormonal distribution, for example, when aroused or inside the maternity cycle. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Piloerection is also a classic [[symptom]] of some diseases, such as temporal lobe [[epilepsy]], some [[brain tumor]]s, and [[autonomic hyperreflexia]]. Goose bumps can also be caused by withdrawal from [[opiate]]s such as [[heroin]]. A skin condition that mimics goose bumps in appearance is [[keratosis pilaris]].

== Cause ==

=== Extreme temperatures ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}

Goosebumps can be experienced in the presence of [[cold]] temperatures. The stimulus of cold surroundings causes the tiny muscles attached to each [[hair follicle]] to contract. This contraction causes the hair strands to literally "stand on end." At the same time, the tiny muscles that are contracting are causing a "bunching" of the skin surrounding the hairs, which results in the "bumps" in goosebumps. 

This is the body's way of preserving its own heat by causing the hairs on the skin to stand up, thus reducing heat loss. Goosebumps are often seen in conjunction with [[shivering]] in these instances.

People also get goosebumps when they are hot, or in the presence of extreme heat. The main reason for this is [[sweat]]. As the [[perspiration]] accumulates on the skin, it naturally [[evaporate]]s. As the sweat evaporates, it cools down the skin surface. As this process occurs, a dramatic temperature difference occurs and the body responds to the "chill" of the evaporation of the sweat and the "goosebump response" kicks in.

=== Intense emotion ===

People often say they feel their "hair standing on end" when they are frightened or in awe. Another intense emotional situation that can cause goosebumps is the "[[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]" response the body can employ in an extremely [[stress (biology)|stress]]ful situation. As the body prepares itself for either fighting or running, the [[sympathetic nervous system]] floods the blood with [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine), a hormone that speeds up [[heart rate]], [[metabolism]], and body temperature in the presence of extreme stress.  The sympathetic nervous system also causes a reflex called piloerection, which makes the muscles attached to the base of each hair follicle contract and force the hair up.  Goose bumps cause the hairs to stand up, just as [[porcupine]]s raise their [[quill]]s when threatened.
