'''2-1-1''' is a special [[Abbreviated dialing|abbreviated]] telephone number reserved in Canada and the United States as an easy-to-remember three-digit [[telephone number]] meant to provide quick information and referrals to health and human service organizations.

== History ==

===United States===
For many years [[New York Telephone]] (now a unit of [[Verizon]]) used 2-1-1 as an automated credit request number for disconnected or mis-dialed calls. This service was in service from the 1970s through the early 2000s (decade).

From many larger cities, the long-distance operator was reached by dialing 2-1-1 in order to place a long-distance call.

United Way of Metropolitan [[Atlanta]] was the first to introduce a 2-1-1 service in 1997. Many states began implementation plans soon after, aided by the [[United Way of America]] in partnership with the [http://www.airs.org/ Alliance of Information and Referral Systems]. On July 20, 2000, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approved 2-1-1 for nation-wide use as a short number in the United States along with [[5-1-1]]. In Texas, particularly in the Coastal Bend area, 2-1-1 is also the number to call for elderly and handicapped people needing evacuation assistance in the event of a pending disaster such as a hurricane.

===Canada===
The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) approved the use of 2-1-1 throughout Canada on August 9, 2001. The first Canadian 2-1-1 service opened in Toronto on June 13, 2002.

== Operation ==
2-1-1 center hours vary. Many are open [[24/7]] to refer callers to organizations that provide services in such areas as:

*[[Substance dependence|Addiction]] counseling
*[[Affordable housing]]
*[[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] assistance
*Child care
*[[Debt]] counseling
*[[Disaster relief]]
*[[Donation]] opportunities
*Education
*Emergency food, such as [[food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s
*[[English language learning and teaching|ESL]]
*[[Social welfare provision|Financial assistance]]
*[[Homeless]] services
*[[Employment counsellor|Job counseling]]
*Parenting programs
*[[Psychotherapy]] counseling
*[[Senior citizen]] programs
*Suicide prevention
*Telephone reassurance, care for the elderly
*Volunteer opportunities
*[[Youth]] programs

Where available, 2-1-1 is operated by a private non-profit community-service organization, local government or local affiliates of the national organization of the [[United Way of America]]. 2-1-1 provides information and [[referral]] to callers on where to obtain assistance from local and national social service programs, local and national governmental agencies and local and national non-profit organizations as well as where to volunteer or make a [[donation]] locally. Referrals are often given from databases accessed by call specialists. These databases could be housed off site or on site, are often regional, and linked to a specific brand of software used to access and edit database records. To ensure the most up to date referrals are given to callers information in the database should not be older than one year.

Many 2-1-1 centers are exploring Memorandums of Understanding with state and federal governments to facilitate the efficient handling of future disasters. Television or Radio stations could easily tell citizens to call 2-1-1 in the event of an emergency. Call specialist at these centers would be informed of current disaster plans or place to receive help and could then inform the public of the correct course of action. Recently in Florida, Texas, [[Arizona]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Iowa]], and the [[Gulf Coast]] region, 2-1-1 centers were instrumental in coordinating with local government officials and providing information to communities before and after local disasters.

Plans to introduce 2-1-1 services are also in development in other Canadian communities.<ref>[http://www.211Canada.ca 211Canada.ca]</ref>

In the Canadian province of [[Prince Edward Island]], for unknown reasons, when 2-1-1 is dialed it causes a [[busy signal]] to occur, and the dialer's telephone line will "go dead" for several minutes afterward.

The ''[[Windsor Star]]'' has reported on March 20, 2003 that [[Windsor, Ontario]] intended to have a 2-1-1 service up by 2009, as the [[Government of Ontario|Provincial Government]] allocated [[Canadian Dollar|$]]311,000 to start it up, with much of the money being donated by the [[United Way of Canada]], but had a set time limit on how long those funds would be available. On November 26, 2007, the City of Windsor's [http://citywindsor.ca website] announced that 2-1-1 service for Windsor and [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]] began, and was being run by the United Way (who also runs the local [[3-1-1]] service).

== Accreditation ==

=== United States ===
The American accrediting body for 2-1-1 centers is the [http://www.airs.org Alliance of Information & Referral Systems] (AIRS). AIRS provides an in-depth accreditation process for 2-1-1 centers. AIRS also certifies 2-1-1 Call Center Representatives as Certified Information and Referral Specialists (CIRS), Certified Information and Referral Specialists for Aging (CIRS-A) and Certified Resource Specialists (CRS) annually. AIRS standards have been created to provide a benchmark for 2-1-1 centers and its staff. The standards regulate nationally how a 2-1-1 centers provides services and how they collect and store information. 

INFOLINE of Los Angeles, an information and referral services agency serving the greater Los Angeles area, developed a national taxonomy of human services that provides a standard language for information and referral providers nationally. AIRS adopted this taxonomy as its national standard for use in the field of information and referral.  This taxonomy provides standard definition of terms, an exact coding structure for referrals and search methodology for providing referrals to consumers. More information about the AIRS/Infoline Taxonomy of Human Services can be found at [http://www.211taxonomy.org www.211taxonomy.org].

Accredited 2-1-1 centers<ref>[http://411newyork.org/guide/2010/03/27/3-digit-numbers-in-new-york-state/ 3-Digit Numbers Used in New York City]</ref> must have active Memorandums of Understanding with local 9-1-1 service as well as domestic violence providers, elder care providers, mental health providers and local law enforcement to name a few.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, professional certification is handled by InformCanada [http://www.informcanada.ca]. The national 211 initiative is a partnership between InformCanada and [[United Way of Canada|United Way of Canada – Centraide Canada]].

Work is underway to create a bilingual, Canadian Taxonomy of human services based on the AIRS/Infoline Taxonomy. This project is led by InformCanada and significant steps have been made on the creation of a starter taxonomy by the 211 Ontario phase 2 project, funded by the Ontario Trillium Foundation and the government of Canada. Updates on the Canadian Taxonomy Project are maintained by 211.ca.<ref>http://211canada.typepad.com/canadian_taxonomy_news/</ref>

== The process of implementing 2-1-1 ==
The number 2-1-1 must be captured and approved for assigning through the local telecom companies providing services in the local area. The process of implementing a 2-1-1 service in a community has taken many paths since its beginning in 1997. Some places have a centralized state-wide system while others have decentralized regional networks with different types of affiliations.

In the United States, each implementation is monitored by the national accrediting entity [http://www.airs.org Alliance of Information & Referral Systems] (AIRS) and its local statewide affiliate.

In Canada, the deployment of 2-1-1 service is subject to InformCanada accreditation and [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) approval.
