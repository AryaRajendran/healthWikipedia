'''Acute intermittent porphyria''' ('''AIP''') is a rare [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Whatley SD, Roberts AG, Llewellyn DH, Bennett CP, Garrett C, Elder GH |title=Non-erythroid form of acute intermittent porphyria caused by promoter and frameshift mutations distant from the coding sequence of exon 1 of the HMBS gene |journal=Hum.

Chief Editor: Stephen A Berman. Updated: Mar 23, 2009</ref>

==Mechanism of disease==
A Swedish study indicated that approximately 90% of cases of acute intermittent porphyria are due to a [[mutation]] that causes decreased amounts of the enzyme, and to a lesser degree by a mutation that causes decreased activity of each enzyme molecule.<ref>{{cite pmid|    2607315}}</ref>

Under normal circumstances, heme synthesis begins in the [[mitochondrion]], proceeds into the [[cytoplasm]], and finishes back in the mitochondrion.  However, without [[porphobilinogen deaminase]], a necessary cytoplasmic enzyme, heme synthesis cannot finish, and the metabolite [[porphobilinogen]] accumulates in the cytoplasm.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Aarsand | first=AK | coauthors=Petersen PH, Sandberg S | title=Estimation and application of biological variation of urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in healthy individuals and in patients with acute intermittent porphyria | journal=Clinical Chemistry | volume=52 | issue=4 | pages=650–656 | month=April | year=2006 | url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/52/4/650 | pmid=16595824 | doi=10.1373/clinchem.2005.060772 }}</ref>

Additional factors must also be present such as [[hormone]]s, [[medication|drugs]], and [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] changes that trigger the appearance of symptoms. Symptoms of AIP may include [[abdominal pain]], [[constipation]], and [[muscle weakness]].

Patients with AIP are commonly misdiagnosed with psychiatric diseases. Subsequent treatment with anti-psychotics increases the accumulation of porphobilinogen, thus aggravating the disease enough that it may prove fatal.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms in AIP can be variable. They include abdominal pain which is severe and poorly localized (most common, 95% of patients experience), Urinary symptoms (Dysuria, urinary retention/incontinence or dark urine), peripheral neuropathy (patchy numbness and paresthesias), Proximal motor weakness (usually starting in upper extremities which can progress to include respiratory impairment and death), autonomic nervous system involvement (circulating [[catecholamine]] levels are increased, may see tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, restlessness and tremor), neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, agitation, hallucination, hysteria, delirium, depression), Electrolyte abnormalities (Hyponatremia may be due to hypothalamic involvement leading to [[SIADH]] that may lead to seizures).

(Eds), McGraw-Hill, New York 2001. p.2991.</ref> Unlike other porphyrias, rash is not typically seen in AIP.

==Treatment==
A high-[[carbohydrate]] (10% [[glucose]]) infusion is recommended, which may aid in recovery. If drugs have caused the attack, discontinuing the offending substances is essential. [[Infection]] is one of the top causes of attacks and requires vigorous treatment. [[Pain]] is extremely severe and almost always requires the use of opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated early as medically possible due to its severity. Nausea can be severe; it may respond to [[phenothiazine]] drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot water baths or showers may lessen nausea temporarily, but can present a risk of burns or falls.<ref>*American Porphyria Foundation.

[[Hematin]] and [[heme arginate]] are the drugs of choice in acute porphyria, in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], respectively. These drugs need to be given very early in an attack to be effective. Effectiveness varies among individuals. They are not curative drugs, but can shorten attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side-effects are rare but can be serious. These [[heme]]-like substances, in theory, inhibit [[ALA synthase]] and, hence, the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of this drug are maintained at two national centers. In the United States, one company manufactures Panhematin for infusion. The American Porphyria Foundation has information regarding the quick procurement of the drug.

Patients with a history of acute porphyria are recommended to wear an [[medical alert jewelry|alert bracelet]] or other identification at all times in case they develop severe symptoms, a result of which may be that they cannot explain to healthcare professionals about their condition and the fact that some drugs are absolutely contraindicated.  An attack of acute intermittent porphyria may be precipitated by one of the "four Ms": medication, menstruation, malnutrition, maladies.

Patients that experience frequent attacks can develop chronic neuropathic pain in extremities as well as chronic pain in the gut.  This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system. In these cases, treatment with long-acting opioids may be indicated. Some cases of chronic pain can be difficult to manage and may require treatment using multiple modalities. Depression often accompanies the disease and is best dealt with by treating the offending symptoms and, if needed, the judicious use of anti-depressants. Earl Campbell from University of Maryland performed the first successful clinical trial. Although results for this trial are still undergoing rigorous testing.

[[Seizures]] often accompany this disease. Most seizure medications exacerbate this condition. Treatment can be problematic: [[Barbiturates]] and Primidone must be avoided as they commonly precipitate symptoms.<ref>{{cite book | last = Marcucci | first = Lisa | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = PathCards | publisher = Lippincott Willians & Wilkins | year = 2004 | location = Baltimore, MD | pages = 105–106 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7817-4399-0 }}</ref> Some [[benzodiazepines]] are safe, and, when used in conjunction with newer anti-seizure medications such as [[gabapentin]], offer a possible regimen for seizure control.

[[Urine]] from a person experiencing an acute attack may be red or "port wine" in color because of the presence of porphyrins. In addition, urine of AIP sufferers may turn purple when exposed to ultraviolet light for a period of time.

==Famous sufferers==
One of the many [[Vincent van Gogh's medical condition|hypothesized diagnoses]] of the artist [[Vincent van Gogh]] is that he and his siblings, in particular his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], suffered from AIP and syphilis.<ref>Arnold, Wilfred N. ''Vincent van Gogh: Chemicals, Crises, and Creativity,''  Birkhãuser, Boston, 1992. ISBN 0-8176-3616-1.</ref> Another theorized sufferer was King [[George III of the United Kingdom]] <ref name="macalpine">Macalpine, Ida and Hunter,Richard  'The Insanity of King George III: A Classic Case of Porphyria', ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' (1966)</ref> who even had a medallion struck to commemorate his "curing". His great-great-great-great-grandson [[Prince William of Gloucester]] was reliably diagnosed with variegate porphyria in 1968.<ref name="porphyria">Rohl, John C.G.  et al, ''Purple Secret'', London: Bantam Press (1998)</ref>

Acute intermittent porphyria is also mentioned briefly in Season 4, Episode 4, "Guardian Angels." Porphyria is again briefly mentioned as the possible cause of "relapsing and remitting" symptoms (suggesting ''acute intermittent'' porphyria) in a patient in Season 4, Episode 6, "Whatever it Takes." Other types of porphyria also appeared on House. In season 3 episode 9, "Finding Judas", a little girl was diagnosed with [[Erythropoietic protoporphyria]]. In season 5 episode 10, "Let Them Eat Cake", House diagnoses another patient as having [[Hereditary coproporphyria]]. In season 7 episode 10, "Carrot or Stick", House diagnoses a father and a son with [[Variegate porphyria]]. In season 1 episode 6, "The Socratic Method," porphyria is mentioned as a differential diagnosis for psychiatric symptoms thought to be schizophrenia.

AIP has also made two appearances on the [[television]] show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'': in the thirteenth episode of season 4, "[[My Ocardial Infarction]],"  <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scrubs_episodes#Season_4_.282004.E2.80.932005.29</ref> and in the ninth episode of season 7, "[[My Dumb Luck]]." <ref>http://www.tv.com/scrubs/my-dumb-luck/episode/1179430/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;9</ref> 

It later appeared in Castle: Vampire Weekend (Season 2, Episode 6), and in Grey's Anatomy: The Time Warp (Season 6, Episode 15).

Also in CSI: Crime Scene Investigators: Justice is Served (Season 1, Episode 21) aired 26 April 2001.

Series 4, episode 2 of Doc Martin also features a patient with porphyria.
