'''ABC''' and its variations are [[initialism]] [[mnemonic]]s for essential steps used by both medical professionals and lay persons (such as [[first aid]]ers) when dealing with a patient. In its original form it stands for ''[[Airway]]'', ''[[Breath]]ing'' and <!--NOTE:Do NOT change this to  Compressions' or 'CPR' - please read the article for further explanation -->''[[Circulatory system|Circulation]]''.<ref name=grauniad/> The protocol was originally developed as a memory aid for rescuers performing [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], and the most widely known use of the initialism is in the care of the [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] or unresponsive patient, although it is also used as a reminder of the priorities for assessment and treatment of patients in many acute medical and trauma situations, from first-aid to hospital medical treatment.<ref name=rsukalert/> Airway, breathing, and circulation are vital for life, and each is required, in that order, for the next to be effective. Since its development, the mnemonic has been extended and modified to fit the different areas in which it is used, with different versions changing the meaning of letters (such as from the original 'Circulation' to 'Compressions') or adding other letters (such as an optional "D" step for ''Disability'' or ''[[Defibrillation]]'').

In 2010, the [[American Heart Association]] and [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] changed the recommended order of [[CPR]] interventions for most cases of cardiac arrest to chest compressions, airway, breathing or CAB.<ref name=CircEx10>{{cite journal |author=Field JM, Hazinski MF, Sayre MR, ''et al.'' |title=Part 1: executive summary: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S640–56 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20956217 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970889 |url=}}</ref>{{rp|S642}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hazinski MF, Nolan JP, Billi JE, ''et al.'' |title=Part 1: executive summary: 2010 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=16 Suppl 2 |pages=S250–75 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20956249 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970897 |url=}}</ref>

==Importance==
At all levels of care, the ABC protocol exists to remind the person delivering treatment of the importance of airway, breathing, and circulation to the maintenance of a patient's life.  These three issues are paramount in any treatment, in that the loss (or loss of control of) any one of these items will rapidly lead to the patient's death. The three objectives are so important to successful patient care that they form the foundation of training for not only first aid providers, but also participants in many advanced medical training programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofdearborn.org/departments/fire/firedocs/firstaid.htm|title=First Aid (City of Dearborn MI FD website)|accessdate=2008-12-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071209122010/http://www.cityofdearborn.org/departments/fire/firedocs/firstaid.htm |archivedate = December 9, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Marianne Gausche-Hill |title=Pediatric airway management |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7637-2066-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpr-pro.com/fa_primary_survey.html|title=Emergency Scene Management|accessdate=2008-12-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090203042035/http://cpr-pro.com/fa_primary_survey.html| archivedate= 3 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=American College of Physicians; American Academy of Pediatrics |title=APLS: The Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource, Fourth Edition |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2003 |pages=11 |isbn=978-0-7637-3316-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Smith, Roger K.; Joseph S.

[[hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]], the result of insufficient oxygen in the blood, is a potentially deadly condition and one of the leading causes of [[cardiac arrest]]. Cardiac arrest is the ultimate cause of [[clinical death]] for all animals<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| last = Kastenbaum| first = Robert| title = Definitions of Death| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Death and Dying| year = 2006| url = http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Definitions-of-Death.html| accessdate = 2007-01-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070203141750/http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Definitions-of-Death.html| archivedate= 3 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> (although with advanced intervention, such as [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] a cardiac arrest may not necessarily lead to death), and it is linked to an absence of circulation in the body, for any one of a number of reasons.  For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.

Airway, breathing, and circulation therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.

==Simple application for CPR==
The basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].

In this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''"head tilt - chin lift"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.

In the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.

Previously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use ''''circulation'''' as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean ''''Compressions'''' in their basic first aid training.

== Airway ==
=== Unconscious patients ===
In the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  Common problems with the airway of patient with a seriously reduced level of consciousness involve blockage of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] by the [[tongue]], a [[foreign body]], or [[vomiting|vomit]].

At a basic level, opening of the airway is achieved through manual movement of the head using various techniques, with the most widely taught and used being the "head tilt — chin lift", although other methods such as the "modified [[jaw thrust]]" can be used, especially where spinal injury is suspected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement|title=Airway Management|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081021030909/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement| archivedate= 21 October 2008| deadurl= yes}} </ref> although in some countries, its use is not recommended for lay rescuers for safety reasons.<ref name=rsukbls>{{cite journal|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|title=Adult Basic Life Support|journal=Resuscitation UK Guidelines|publisher=Resuscitaton Council (UK)|page=14|accessdate=2008-12-19|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051202034805/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2005}}</ref>

Higher level practitioners such as [[emergency medical service]] personnel may use more advanced techniques, from [[oropharyngeal airway]]s to [[intubation]], as deemed necessary.<ref>{{cite book |author=Grande, Christopher M.; Søreide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=211 |isbn=978-0-8247-0537-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Conscious patients===
In the conscious patient, other signs of airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and [[cyanosis]].<ref name=rsukils>{{cite book|title=Immediate Life Support|publisher=Resuscitation Council(UK)|coauthors=Soar, J; Nolan, J; Perkins, G; Scott, M; Goodman, N;Mitchell, S|year=2006|isbn=978-1-903812-12-9|author=editors Jasmeet Soar ...}}</ref>

== Breathing ==
===Unconscious patients===
In the unconscious patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the patient's breathing,<ref name=rsukbls/> primarily to find if the patient is making normal respiratory efforts.  Normal breathing rates are between 12 and 30 breaths per minute,<ref name=rsukils/> and if a patient is breathing below the minimum rate, then in current ILCOR basic life support protocols, CPR should be considered, although professional rescuers may have their own protocols to follow, such as [[artificial respiration]].

Rescuers are often warned against mistaking [[agonal breathing]], which is a series of noisy gasps occurring in around 40% of cardiac arrest victims, for normal breathing.<ref name=rsukbls/>

If a patient is breathing, then the rescuer will continue with the treatment indicated for an unconscious but breathing patient, which may include interventions such as the [[recovery position]] and summoning an [[ambulance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstaid.ie/tip_recovery.htm|title=Recovery Position|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref>

===Conscious or breathing patients===
In a conscious patient, or where a pulse and breathing are clearly present, the care provider will initially be looking to diagnose immediately life-threatening conditions such as severe [[asthma]], [[pulmonary oedema]] or [[haemothorax]].<ref name=rsukils/>  Depending on skill level of the rescuer, this may involve steps such as:<ref name=rsukils/>
* Checking for general respiratory distress, such as use of accessory muscles to breathe, abdominal breathing, position of the patient, [[sweat]]ing, or [[cyanosis]]
* Checking the respiratory rate, depth and rhythm - Normal breathing is between 12 and 20 in a healthy patient, with a regular pattern and depth.  If any of these deviate from normal, this may indicate an underlying problem (such as with [[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]])
* Chest deformity and movement - The chest should rise and fall equally on both sides, and should be free of deformity.  Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as [[pneumothorax]] or [[haemothorax]]
* Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or [[stridor]] (which indicates airway obstruction)
* Checking for [[surgical emphysema]] which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a [[pneumothorax]]
* [[Auscultation]] and [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] of the chest by using a [[stethoscope]] to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities
* Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing

== Circulation ==
Once oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body.

===Non-breathing patients===
Circulation is the original meaning of the 'C' as laid down by Jude, Knickerbocker & Safar, and was intended to suggest assessing the presence or absence of circulation, usually by taking a [[carotid]] [[pulse]], before taking any further treatment steps.

In modern protocols for lay persons, this step is omitted as it has been proven that lay rescuers may have difficulty in accurately determining the presence or absence of a pulse, and that, in any case, there is less risk of harm by performing chest compressions on a beating heart than failing to perform them when the heart is not beating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cjstudios.com/Aquatics/new_cpr_standards.htm|title=New CPR Standards|accessdate=208-12-19}}</ref> For this reason, lay rescuers proceed directly to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, starting with chest compressions, which is effectively artificial circulation.  In order to simplify the teaching of this to some groups, especially at a basic first aid level, the C for Circulation is changed for meaning CPR or Compressions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emergency Action Plan|publisher=Parasol EMT|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=drabc|accessdate=2008-12-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090108043458/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=drabc| archivedate= 8 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessor's guide to passing your First Aid at Work exam|publisher=Mediaid Training Services|url=http://www.mediaid.co.uk/assessors-guide.php|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref><ref name=SRAB>{{cite web|title=The Priority Action Plan|publisher=St John New Zealand|url=http://www.stjohn.org.nz/tips/srabcs.aspx|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

It should be remembered, however, that health care professionals will often still include a pulse check in their ABC check, and may involve additional steps such as an immediate [[ECG]] when cardiac arrest is suspected, in order to assess heart rhythm.

===Breathing patients===
In patients who are breathing, there is the opportunity to undertake further diagnosis and, depending on the skill level of the attending rescuer, a number of assessment options are available, including:
* Observation of colour and temperature of hands and fingers where cold, blue, pink, pale, or mottled extremities can be indicative of poor circulation
* [[Capillary refill]] is an assessment of the effective working of the capillaries, and involves applying cutaneous pressure to an area of skin to force blood from the area, and counting the time until return of blood.  This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead
* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses
* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock
* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals
* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as oedema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)
* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infarctions]]

== Variations ==
Nearly all first aid organisations use "ABC" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).

===DR ABC===
One of the most widely used adaptations is the addition of "DR" in front of "ABC", which stands for '''Danger''' and '''Response'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The primary survey|publisher=St John Ambulance|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/first-aid-advice/lifesaving-procedures/primary-survey.aspx|accessdate=2008-12-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081206031853/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/first-aid-advice/lifesaving-procedures/primary-survey.aspx| archivedate= 6 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  This refers to the guiding principle in first aid to protect yourself before attempting to help others, and then ascertaining that the patient is unresponsive before attempting to treat them, using systems such as [[AVPU]] or the [[Glasgow Coma Score]].  As the original initialism was devised for in-hospital use, this was not part of the original protocol.<ref>Committee on CPR of the Division of Medical Sciences, National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, JAMA 1966;198:372-379 and 138-145.</ref>

In some areas, the related SR ABC is used, with the S to mean '''Safety'''.<ref name=SRAB/>

===DRsABC===
A modification to DRABC is that when there is no response from the patient, the rescuer is told to ''send for help'''<ref>{{cite web|last=Stebbing|first=James|url=http://www.jamesstebbing.co.uk/FirstAid_Primary_Survey.pdf|title=The Primary Survey|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation|coauthors=Gibson, Tracey;Cole, Elaine;McLeod, Anne|publisher=Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning|url=http://www.cetl.org.uk/learning/print/cpr-print.pdf}}</ref>

===ABCDE===
Additionally, some protocols call for an 'E' step to patient assessment.
