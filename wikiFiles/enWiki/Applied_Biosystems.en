'''Applied Biosystems, Inc.''', started as GeneCo (Genetic Systems Company), was the name of a pioneer [[biotechnology]] company founded in 1981 in [[Foster City, California]], in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name="appliedtime">[http://marketing.appliedbiosystems.com/mk/get/25YRSEMS_HERRITAGE_TIMELINE Applied Biosystems Timeline], AppliedBiosystems.com</ref> Through the 1980s and early 1990s it operated independently and manufactured [[biochemical]]s and automated [[genetic engineering]] and diagnostic research instruments, including the principal brand of [[DNA sequencing]] machine used by the [[Human Genome Project]] consortium centers. Applied Biosystems' close ties to the consortium project led to the idea for the founding of [[Celera Genomics]]  in 1998 as one of several independent competitors to the consortium.<ref name="nytweb000627">[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/062700sci-genome-history.html READING THE BOOK OF LIFE, Double Landmarks for Watson: Helix and Genome], The New York Times on the Web, By NICHOLAS WADE, June 27, 2000</ref>

In 1993 Applied Biosystems was delisted from the [[NASDAQ]] when it was acquired by the old company known then as [[Perkin-Elmer]] (formerly {{nyse2|PKN}}). As the '''PE Applied Biosystems Division''' under that parent in 1998, it became consolidated with other acquisitions as the primary '''PE Biosystems Division'''.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1994-10-K"/> In 1999 its parent company reorganized and changed its name to [[PE Corporation]],<ref name="PE-Corp-Mar-1999-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1316/7755199000007/filing-main.htm |title=PE Corp, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 16, 1999 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref> and the '''PE Biosystems Group''' (formerly {{NYSE2|PEB}}) again became publicly traded, as a [[tracking stock]] of its parent, along with its sister tracking stock company, Celera Genomics. In 2000 the parent became [[Applera]] Corporation. The Applied Biosystems name also returned that year, in the name change of the tracking stock from PE Biosystems Group to '''Applera Corporation-Applied Biosystems Group''' ({{nyse2|ABI}}), an [[S&P 500]] company, which remains as a publicly traded operating group within Applera Corp., along with its sibling operating group, Applera Corporation-Celera Group. Applera derives its name from the combination of its two component groups' names, '''Appl'''<sup>(iedCel)</sup>'''era'''<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Nov-2000-8-K"/> In November 2008, a merger between Applied Biosystems and [[Invitrogen]] <ref name="Applera-Oct-2008-8-K"/> was finalized "creating a global leader in biotechnology reagents and systems". The new company is called [[Life Technologies]].

==History==
In May 1981, the company was founded by two scientist/engineer from [[Hewlett Packard]], [[Sam Eletr]] and [[Andre Marion]]<ref name="appliedtime" />

In August 1982, Applied Biosystems released its first commercial instrument, the Model 470A [[protein sequencing|Protein Sequencer]]. The machine enabled scientists to determine the order of [[amino acid]]s within a purified [[protein]], which in turn correlated with the protein's function. With 40 employees, the company, reported first-time revenue of US$402,000.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1983 the company was led by its president and Chairman of the Board, Sam Eletr and Chief Operating Officer Andre Marion, the company doubled its number of employees to 80, and its stock went public on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange under the symbol ABIO, with revenues of US$5.9 million. A new product was a fluorescent [[molecular tag]] for [[Immunodiagnostics|immunodiagnostic]] assays.<ref name="appliedtime" />

The company released its second commercial instrument, the Model 380A DNA Synthesizer, which made [[oligonucleotide]]s, short [[DNA strand]]s, for [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), DNA sequencing, and gene identification. The two sequencer and synthesizer products allowed [[molecular biologist]]s to [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] [[gene]]s by building oligonucleotides with the desired protein's DNA sequence.<ref name="appliedtime" />

Automated DNA sequencing began at the [[California Institute of Technology]], using fluorescent dyes, with Rights to the technology granted to Applied Biosystems.<ref name="appliedtime" /> At CIT, Dr. [[Leroy Hood]] and Dr. [[Lloyd Smith]], together pioneered those first DNA sequencing machines.<ref name="nytweb000627" />

In 1984, Applied Biosystems sales revenue tripled to over US$18 million, with a second yearly profit, and with over 200 employees. 
Services included synthesizing custom DNA and protein fragments, and the sequencing of protein samples submitted from customers. The third major instrument made by Applied, the Model 430A [[peptide synthesis|Peptide Synthesizer]], was introduced.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1985, Applied Biosystems sales revenue grew nearly 70% to over US$35 million, with a third yearly profit. Two new products included the Model 380B DNA Synthesizer and the 381A DNA Synthesizer. That year the company went international for the first time, when it established a wholly owned subsidiary in [[Great Britain]] to save shipping costs on chemical sales, which overall by then accounted for 17% of sales.<ref name="appliedtime" />

Also in 1985, Applied Biosystems acquired Brownlee Labs, a manufacturer of columns and pumps for [[high performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) systems, after its founder, [[Robert Brownlee (chemist)|Robert Brownlee]] was diagnosed with [[AIDS-related complex]] in 1984.<ref>''New York Times'', Dec. 12, 1984 "for 130,000 shares"</ref> Brownlee's technology brought the new on-line 120A PTH [[amino acid analysis|Amino Acid Analyzer]].<ref name="appliedtime" />

However, Brownlee then began a new company, which was viewed by Applied as a competitor. In 1989 Applied and Brownlee settled in a   lawsuit over the conflict.<ref>Brownlee v. Applied Biosystems, Inc., 1989-1 Trade Cas. (CCH)  68, (N.D. Cal. 1989) 8,14</ref> As late as 1990, Brownlee publicly discussed what had been his contributions in the rocky relationship with Applied, before he died early the next year.<ref>[http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/10166/ ''The Scientist'', 25 June, 1990]</ref>

In 1986, Andre Marion became President and Chief Executive Officer. Sales revenue increased by 45% to nearly US$52 million. The company introduced six new products, totalling eleven automated instruments. The release of the Model 370A DNA Sequencing System, using fluorescent tags, revolutionized gene discovery. The Model 340A Nucleic Acid Extractor became used in medical labs to isolate DNA from bacteria, blood, and tissue.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1987, Sam Eletr resigned for health reasons. Revenues increase by 63% to nearly US$85 million, with 788 employees, and another six new instruments. Applied Biosystems acquired the Kratos Division of [[Spectros International]] PLC.<ref name="appliedtime" />

By 1988, the product line had increased to over 25 different automated instruments, over 400 liquid chromatography columns and components, and about 320 chemicals, biochemicals, and consumables. Sales revenue grew to over US$132 million, with almost 1000 employees in eight countries. In that year for the first time, genetic science reached the milestone of being able to identify  individuals by their DNA.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1989, sales revenue reached nearly $160 million. Applied Biosystems maintained 15 offices in 9 different countries, and introduced four new products. The company developed enzyme-based [[reagent]] kits made by [[Promega]] Corporation, and in the new field of [[bioinformatics]], licensed with [[TRW Inc.]] ({{nyse2|TRW}}) Also, joint marketing began with [[Perkin-Elmer]] Corporation and [[Cetus Corporation]] (formerly {{NASDAQ|CTUS}}) of instruments and reagents for [[DNA replication]], the fastest growing segment in biotechnology.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1990, instrument sales underwent a cyclical slowdown, as the economy entered the [[1990-1991 recession]]. For the first year, Applied revenues did not grow, and came in at less than $159 million, with 1,334 employees. New company developments included new instrumentation for [[robotics]] and detection of DNA fragments using the company's fluorescent labelling.<ref name="appliedtime" />

Also in 1990, the U.S. government approved financing to support the Human Genome Project. Dr. [[James D. Watson]], who founded the consortium, forecast that the project could be completed in 15 years from its 1990 starting date, at a cost of cost US$3 billion.<ref name="nytweb000627" /> Over the next couple years, Japan began a project to sequence the rice genome, and other laboratories initiated programs to sequence the mouse, fruit fly, and yeast genomes.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1991, Applied sales revenue grew slightly, to almost $164 million, with consumables and service contracts up by 24% to account for 47% of total sales, and DNA sequencer and DNA synthesis instruments having record sales. Forty-five new consumable products and six new instruments were introduced.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1992, sales revenue grew by more than 11% to over $182 million, with Europe representing 25% of revenue, and Asia and the [[Pacific Rim]] accounting for 26%. The company formed a new subsidiary, [[Lynx Therapeutics]], Inc., to focus on [[antisense]] DNA research in the area of therapeutics for [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], [[melanoma]], [[colorectal cancer]], and AIDS.<ref name="appliedtime" />

===Perkin-Elmer===

In February 1993 Applied Biosystems was acquired by [[Perkin-Elmer]],<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1994-10-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/803/91335594000020/filing-main.htm |title=Perkin-Elmer, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Sep 28, 1994 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref> and became the '''Applied Biosystems Division''', as part of the [[Life Sciences]] markets segment of that company. Andre Marion, who had been Applied Biosystems's Chairman, President and CEO, became a Senior Vice President of Perkin-Elmer, and President of the Applied Biosystems Division. That year the company was the world's leading manufacturer of instruments and reagents for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It marketed PCR reagents kits in alliance with [[Hoffman-La Roche]] Inc.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1994-10-K"/>

In 1994, Perkin-Elmer reported net revenues of over $1 billion, of which Life Sciences accounted for 42% of the business. The company has 5,954 employees.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1994-10-K"/> A brand-new highly competitive genomics industry had formed for the development of new pharmaceuticals, based on the work of the Human Genome Project. Companies such as [[Human Genome Sciences]] ({{NASDAQ|HGSI}}) in Maryland, [[Myriad Genetics]] ({{NASDAQ|MYGN}}) in Utah, [[INCYTE Pharmaceuticals]] (later Incyte Genomics) ({{NASDAQ|INCY}})  in California, and [[Millennium Pharmaceuticals]] relied on the Applied Biosystems Division, which made [[thermal cyclers]] and automated sequencers for these new genomics companies.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1995, upon Andre Marion retirement, Mike Hunkapiller became President of PE Applied Biosystems Division which sold its 30,000th thermal cycler. To meet Human Genome Project goals, Perkin-Elmer developed mapping kits with markers every 10 million bases along each chromosome. Also that year, [[DNA fingerprinting]] using PCR became accepted in court as reliable forensic evidence.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1996, Perkin-Elmer acquired [[Tropix]], Inc., a [[chemiluminescence]] company, for its life sciences division.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-May-1996-10-Q">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/314/7755196000005/filing-main.htm |title=Perkin-Elmer, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date May 13, 1996 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1996-10-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/318/7755196000009/filing-main.htm |title=Perkin-Elmer, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Sep 24, 1996 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref>

===PE Applied Biosystems===

In September 1995, [[Tony L. White]] from [[Baxter International]] Inc. became President and Chief Executive Officer of Perkin-Elmer.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1995-10-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1987/7755195000012/filing-main.htm |title=Perkin-Elmer, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Sep 27, 1995 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref> In 1996 the company was reorganized into two separate operating divisions, Analytical Instruments and '''PE Applied Biosystems'''. The PE Applied Biosystems division accounted for half of Perkin-Elmer's total revenue, with net revenues up by 26%.<ref name="appliedtime" />

In 1997, revenues reached almost US$1.3 billion, of which PE Applied Biosystems was US$653 million.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1997-10-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1648/7755197000006/filing-main.htm |title=Perkin-Elmer, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Sep 12, 1997 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref> The company acquired [[GenScope]], Inc., and [[Linkage Genetics]], Inc. The Linkage Genetics unit was combined with [[Zoogen]] to form '''PE AgGen''', focused on genetic analysis services for plant and animal breeding. The PE Applied Biosystems division partnered with [[Hyseq]], Inc., for work on the new [[DNA chip]] technology, and also worked with [[Tecan U.S.]], Inc., on [[combinatorial chemistry]] automation systems, and also with [[Molecular Informatics]], Inc. on genetic data management and analysis automated systems.<ref name="appliedtime" />

===PE Biosystems===

In 1998, PE Applied Biosystems became '''PE Biosystems''', and the division's revenues reached US$921.8 million. In January 1998 Perkin-Elmer acquired [[PerSeptive Biosystems]] (formerly {{NASDAQ|PBIO}}) of [[Framingham, Massachusetts]].<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1998-10-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2991/7755198000016/filing-main.htm |title=Perkin-Elmer, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Sep 25, 1998 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref> It was a leader in the bio-instrumentation field where it made [[biomolecule]] purification systems for protein analysis.<ref name="stockguide">Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, various issues</ref><ref name="mit">[http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/practitioners.php Practitioners, NOUBAR B. AFEYAN, Ph.D., Senior Lecturer], MIT Entrepreneurship Center</ref> [[Noubar B. Afeyan]], Ph.D., had been the founder, Chairman, and CEO of PerSeptive, and with the Perkin-Elmer successor company he set up the later tracking stock for Celera.

In 1998, Perkin-Elmer formed the PE Biosystems division, by consolidating Applied Biosystems, PerSeptive Biosystems, Tropix and PE Informatics.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1998-10-K"/> Informatics was formed from the Perkin-Elmer combination of two other acquisitions, [[Molecular Informatics]] and [[Nelson Analytical Systems]], with existing units of Perkin-Elmer.

While planning the next new generation of machines, PE Biosystems' president, Michael W. Hunkapiller, calculated that it would be possible for their own private industry to decode the human genome before the academic consortium could complete it, by using the resources of a single, industrial-scale center, even though it would require starting from scratch.<ref name="nytweb000627" /> It was a bold prediction, given that the consortium target date set by Dr. Watson back in 1990 had been the forward year of 2005, only seven years away, and with the consortium already half the way to the completion target date.

Also, it meant that Dr. Hunkapiller's idea would require competing against his own customers, to all of whom Applied Biosystems sold its sequencing machines and their chemical reagents. However, he calculated that it would also mean doubling the market for that equipment.<ref name="nytweb000627" />

Hunkapiller brought in Dr. [[J. Craig Venter]] to direct the project. Tony White, president of the Perkin-Elmer Corporation backed Hunkapiller on the venture. They organized the new company to accomplish the task. In May 1998, [[Celera Genomics]] was formed, to rapidly accelerate the human DNA sequencing process.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1998-10-K"/> Dr. Venter boldly declared to the media that he would complete the genome decoding by 2001.<ref name="buswire990429">[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc.aspx?id=1G1:54506273 PE Biosystems Chosen to Supply DNA Sequencers to Public Human Genome Project.], High Beam Encyclopedia.com, From: Business Wire, press release, Date: 4/29/1999</ref><ref name="forbes">[http://www.forbes.com/1999/04/29/feat2_print.html Human genome race tweaked by Celera's stock offer], Forbes.com, April 29, 1999</ref> That bold announcement prompted the academic consortium to accelerate their own deadline by a couple years, to 2003.<ref name="nytweb000627" />

Also in 1998, PE Biosystems partnered with [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], Ltd. to develop [[electrophoresis]]-based genetic analysis systems, which resulted in their chief new [[genomics]] instrument, the ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer, which advanced the Human Genome sequencing project by nearly five years ahead of schedule. The partnerships sold hundreds of the 3700 analyzers to Celera, and also to others worldwide.<ref name="appliedtime" /><ref name="buswire990429" />

The new machine cost US$300,000 each, but was a major leap beyond its predecessor, the 377, and was fully automated, allowing genetic decoding to run around the clock with little supervision. According to Venter, the machine was so revolutionary that it could decode in a single day the same amount of genetic material that most DNA labs could produce in a year.<ref name="forbes" /> 

The public consortium also bought one of the PE Biosystems 3700 sequencers, and had plans to buy 200 more. The machine proved to be so fast that by late March 1999 the consortium announced that it had revised its timeline, and would release by the Spring of 2000 a "first draft sequence" for 80% of the human genome.<ref name="forbes" />

At year end 1998, the PE Biosystems Group's sales reached US$940 million.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Sep-1998-10-K"/>

===PE Corporation===

In 1999, to focus on the new genomics, Perkin-Elmer Corporation was renamed '''PE Corporation''',<ref name="PE-Corp-Mar-1999-8-K"/> and sold its old Analytical Instruments division to [[EG&G]], Inc., which also acquired the Perkin-Elmer name. PE Biosystems remained with PE Corp., and became '''PE Biosystems Group''', with 3,500 employees and net revenues of over $1.2 billion.<ref name="PE-Corp-Sep-1999-10-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2368/108614499000067/filing-main.htm |title=PE Corp, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Sep 28, 1999 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref> New instruments were developed and sold for [[forensic]] human identification, protein identification and characterization, [[metabolite]] pathway identification, and lead compound identification from combinatorial libraries.<ref name="appliedtime" />

On April 27, 1999,<ref name="forbes" /> the shareholders of Perkin-Elmer Corporation approved the reorganization of Perkin-Elmer into PE Corporation, a pure-play life science company.<ref name="pebletter99">[http://www.applera.com/annualreports/annual99/letter_mike.html How can we enable new exploration? a letter from michael hunkapiller, ph.d., president, PE Biosystems], PE Corporation, 1999 Annual Report</ref> Each share of the Perkin-Elmer stock (PKN) was to be exchanged for one share and for ½ of a share respectively of the two new common share tracking stocks for the two component Life Sciences groups, '''PE Biosystems Group''' (NYSE:PEB) and '''Celera Genomics Group''' (NYSE:CRA).<ref name="buswire990429" /><ref name="PE-Corp-Mar-1999-S-4/A">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/349/104746999010576/filing-main.htm |title=PE Corp, Form S-4/A, Filing Date Mar 19, 1999 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref>

On April 28, 1999, the two replacement tracking stocks for the new PE Corporation were issued to shareholders.<ref name="forbes" /><ref name="pebletter99" /> Dr. Michael W. Hunkapiller remained as a Senior Vice President of PE Corporation, and as president of PE Biosystems.<ref name="buswire990429" /> 

On May 6, 1999, the recapitalization of the company resulted in issuance of the two new classes of common stock, called PE Corporation-PE Biosystems Group Common Stock and PE Corporation-Celera Genomics Group Common Stock.<ref name="PE-Corp-Sep-1999-10-K"/> On that date, trading began in both new stocks on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], to great excitement.<ref name="forbes" /> 

On June 17, 1999 the Board of PE Corporation announced a two-for-one split of PE Biosystems Group Common Stock.<ref name="PE-Corp-Sep-1999-10-K"/>

By June 2000, the genomics segment of the [[technology bubble]] was peaking. Celera Genomics (CRA) and PE Biosystems (PEB) were among five genetics pioneers leading at that time, along with [[Incyte Genomics]] ({{NASDAQ|INCY}}), [[Human Genome Sciences]] ({{NASDAQ|HGSI}}), and [[Millennium Pharmaceuticals]] ({{NASDAQ|MLNM}}). All five of those stocks by then had exceeded a price above $100 per share in the market, before ultimately crashing back down.<ref name="busweek2000">[http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_24/b3685011.htm The Slow, Painful Path to Payday in Genomic Stocks], Businessweek Online, By David Shook in New York, JUNE 12, 2000 ISSUE</ref>

===Applera===
On November 30, 2000, PE Corporation changed its name to '''Applera''', combining the two partial names Applied and Celera into one, with 5,000 employees.<ref name="Perkin-Elmer-Nov-2000-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2762/111053800000004/filing-main.htm |title=Perkin-Elmer, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Nov 28, 2000 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 12, 2013}}</ref> PE Biosystems Group was renamed once again to '''Applied Biosystems Group''', and changed its ticker symbol from PEB to ABI.

The instrument analyzed 1,000 protein samples per hour.<ref name="appliedtime" />

On April 22, 2002, the Celera Genomics Group announced its decision to shift the role of marketing data from its genetic database over to its sister company, the Applied Biosystems Group. Celera would instead develop pharmaceutical drugs. Applied Biosystems was a better fit for the database, because Applied already had the huge sales force in place for the marketing of its instruments. Plans were to expand those sales and those of the database into an electronic commerce system.<ref name="nyt020422">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9A01EED6103FF931A15757C0A9649C8B63 Sequencer of Genome to Change Focus], New York Times, By ANDREW POLLACK, Published: April 22, 2002</ref>

In 2002, Applied Biosystems reached revenues of US$1.6 billion for the year, and took control from Celera of the support of [[Celera Discovery System]] (CDS), a data tool to answer specific genomic and proteomic queries, involving the new genetic data field of tens of thousands of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) within the human genome.
