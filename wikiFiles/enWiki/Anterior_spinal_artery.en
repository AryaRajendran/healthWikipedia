In [[human anatomy]], the '''anterior spinal artery''' is the [[blood vessel]] that supplies the anterior portion of the [[spinal cord]]. It arises from branches of the [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]] and courses along the anterior aspect of the spinal cord. It is reinforced by several contributory arteries, especially the [[artery of Adamkiewicz]].

==Path==
The anterior spinal artery arises bilaterally as two small branches near the termination of the [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]]. One of these vessels is usually larger than the other, but occasionally they are about equal in size. Descending in front of the [[medulla oblongata]], they unite at the level of the [[foramen magnum]]. The single trunk descends in the front of the [[medulla spinalis]], extending to the lowest part of the medulla spinalis. It is continued as a slender twig on the [[filum terminale]]. 

On its course artery takes several small branches (i.e. [[Segmental medullary artery|anterior segmental medullary arteries]]), which enter the [[vertebral canal]] through the [[intervertebral foramina]]. These branches are derived from the [[vertebral artery]], the [[ascending cervical artery]], a branch of the [[inferior thyroid artery]] in the neck, the [[intercostal arteries]] in the [[thorax]], and from the [[lumbar artery]], [[iliolumbar artery]] and [[lateral sacral arteries]] in the [[abdomen]] and [[pelvis]]. 

The vessel is placed in the [[pia mater]] along the [[anterior median fissure]]. It supplies that membrane, and the substance of the medulla spinalis, also sending off branches at its lower part to be distributed to the [[cauda equina]].

==Disorders==
Disruption of the anterior spinal cord leads to bilateral disruption of the [[corticospinal tract]], causing motor deficits, and bilateral disruption of the [[spinothalamic tract]], causing sensory deficits in the form of pain/temperature sense loss. It is called [[anterior spinal artery syndrome]]. This occurs when the disruption of the anterior spinal artery is at the level of the spinal cord. Contrast this with [[medial medullary syndrome]], when the anterior spinal artery is occluded at the level of the [[medulla oblongata]].
