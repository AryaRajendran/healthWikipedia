==Early life==
'''Annie Jean Macnamara''' was born on 1 April 1899 to John and Annie Macnamara in Beechworth, Victoria. Her family moved to [[Melbourne]] when she was seven and she attended Spring Road State School. She received a scholarship to study at the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne|Presbyterian Ladies' College]].

==Career==
In 1923 Macnamara became a resident doctor at the [[Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne|Royal Children's Hospital]] in Melbourne. Hospital authorities had at first been reluctant to employ her on the grounds that it had no toilet facilities for women doctors.<ref>Sherratt, T. [http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/hi/journal/as_macna.htm No Standing Back: Dame Jean Macnamara], ''Australasian Science'', 1993</ref> During her time at the Children's Hospital there was a [[polio]] outbreak, she and Burnet demonstrated that there was more than one strain of the virus, a fact that would be important in the later development of the [[Salk vaccine]]. Between 1925 and 1931 she was consultant and medical officer responsible to the Poliomyelitis Committee of Victoria, and between 1930 and 1931 was honorary adviser on polio to official authorities in [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]].<ref>Ann G. Smith, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100337b.htm Macnamara, Dame Annie Jean (1899 - 1968)], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', vol. 10, Melbourne University Press, 1986, pp. 345-347.</ref>

In 1931 she received a Rockefeller Fellowship to travel to England and United States to study [[orthopaedics]]. When she returned to Australia in 1934 she married dermatologist Joseph Ivan Connor, and they had two daughters, Joan and Merran. She conducted a successful orthopaedic work, and for this contribution was created DBE in 1935. Although she was considered the foremost Australian authority on the treatment of poliomyelitis, she continued to recommend the use of convalescent serum and splinting to immobilise limbs long after these treatments were abandoned in America.<ref>Paul JR (1971) A History of Poliomyelitis, London, Yale University Press</ref>

In the 1930s she encouraged the Australian government to trial the [[myxoma virus]] to combat the Australian rabbit plague. Although trials were initially unsuccessful, she lobbied that they be continued, and when the virus became [[epizootic]] in 1951, the mosquito vector spread the virus among rabbits, causing the successful reduction of wild rabbit numbers. {{citation needed|date=September 2009}}
