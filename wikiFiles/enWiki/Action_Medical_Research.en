==History==
Founded in 1952 as the National Fund for Poliomyelitis Research by Duncan Guthrie, the charity's original aim was the eradication of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]].<ref name="charitycommission" /> During the 1940s and 1950s, epidemics of paralytic poliomyelitis were frequent in the UK, and the charity helped to fund the first British [[polio vaccine]].<ref name="BBC_2000">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/994799.stm BBC News: 'Polio milestone passed' (29 October 2000)] (accessed 28 September 2007)</ref><ref name="BBC_2002">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2051284.stm BBC News: 'Europe achieves polio milestone' (18 June 2002)] (accessed 28 September 2007)</ref> After the steep reduction in paralytic poliomyelitis resulting from the introduction of the vaccine, the charity's activities diversified. It became The National Fund for Research into Poliomyelitis and Other Crippling Diseases in 1960 and The National Fund for Research into Crippling Diseases in 1967, becoming known informally as Action Research for the Crippled Child. It was renamed Action Research in 1990, and became Action Medical Research in 2003.<ref name="charitycommission" /><ref name="AMR_Name">[http://www.action.org.uk/about_us/history_name_changes.php Action Medical Research: History of name changes] (accessed 28 September 2007)</ref> The [[World Health Organization]]'s 2002 declaration that Europe is free from polio coincided with the charity's fiftieth anniversary.<ref name="BBC_2002" />

==Projects==
Their major focus has been on [[pregnancy]] and conditions affecting babies, with involvement in projects including the [[rubella]] vaccine, [[ultrasound scanning]] in pregnancy, intrauterine blood typing, [[folic acid]] in the prevention of [[spina bifida]], and the diagnosis of [[retinopathy]] in [[Premature birth|premature babies]]. Projects in older children include diet in [[liver disease]] and treatment of [[Burn (injury)|burns]] in children. Other projects include treatment for [[epilepsy]]. The charity has also been involved in [[hip replacement surgery]] and the development of aids for the elderly and severely disabled, including communication aids, the shapeable 'matrix' wheelchair and the 'Tools for Living' programme. The charity has also funded research into [[osteoporosis]], [[nerve]] repair, [[hydrocephalus]] and [[myasthenia gravis]].

Their current appeal 'Touching Tiny Lives' is raising money for research to prevent premature births, and [[pre-eclampsia]] and other life-threatening complications of pregnancy. It also aims to improve treatments for babies requiring special care. Supported by celebrities including [[Tony Hadley]] and [[Martin Fry]], the campaign had raised almost £4 million by March 2009.<ref name="EDM">[http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=33599&SESSION=885 Parliamentary Information Management Services: Early Day Motion 1762: Touching Tiny Lives campaign and pre-term birth] (accessed 28 September 2007)</ref>{{Fact|date=March 2009}} Action Medical Research is also involved in lobbying the UK government to increase funding for research in these areas, which has led to an [[early day motion]] from [[Stewart Jackson]], [[List of United Kingdom MPs|MP]], signed by a total of 69 MPs.<ref name="EDM" />
