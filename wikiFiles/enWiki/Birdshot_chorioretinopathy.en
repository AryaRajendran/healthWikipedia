'''Birdshot chorioretinopathy''' is a rare form of bilateral posterior [[uveitis]] affecting the [[human eye|eye]]. It causes severe, progressive [[inflammation]] of both the [[choroid]] and [[retina]]. 

Affected individuals are usually diagnosed in the fourth to sixth decade of their lives.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cassoux N, Lehoan GP |title=Birdshot retinochoroidopathy  |journal=Ann Med Interne. |volume=151 |issue=Suppl. 1 |pages=1s45–1s47 |year=2000 |pmid=10896989 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a rare form of posterior [[uveitis]] and accounts for 1-3% of uveitis cases in general. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is thought to be an [[Autoimmune diseases|autoimmune disease]]. The disease has strong association with the [[Human leukocyte antigen]] [[haplotype]] (HLA)-A29, which is the strongest association between a disease and HLA class I documented (85 to 97.5% of patients are [[HLA-A29]] positive). This indicates a role for  [[T-lymphocytes]] in the pathogenesis. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is associated with [[Interleukin 17|IL-17]], a hallmark [[cytokine]] of TH17 cells that play an important role in autoimmunity .<ref name=dacl>{{cite journal |author=Kuiper JJW, Mutis T, de Jager W, de Groot-Mijnes JD, Rothova A. |title=Intraocular interleukin-17 and proinflammatory cytokines in HLA-A29-associated birdshot chorioretinopathy. |journal=Am J Ophthalmol.  |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=177–182 |year=2011 |PMID:21570674 |doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2011.01.031}}</ref> The disease affects typically middle aged or elderly [[Caucasian race|caucasians]]. HLA-A29 is less prevalent in Asia and no birdshot chorioretinopathy cases have been reported in Asia.  When birdshot chorioretinopathy is suspected, a person is usually tested to determine if they are [[HLA-A29]] positive. However, HLA-A29 testing is not considered necessary for definitive diagnosis because HLA-A29 is also common in the general healthy population (7%). Additional (genetic or environmental) or unknown factors may be associated with HLA-A29 in the pathogenesis.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of this disorder include floaters, blurred vision, [[photopsia]] (flashing lights in eyes), loss of color vision and [[nyctalopia]]. In eye examination light-colored spots on the retina is seen. Complete loss of [[visual acuity]] may happen. 

The name of the condition comes from the small light-colored fundus spots on the retina, scattered in a pattern like [[birdshot]] from a [[shotgun]], but these spots might not be present in early stages.

==Treatment==

Birdshot chorioretinopathy may show resistance to treatment. [[Immunosuppressant]] therapy alongside with oral corticosteroid have been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual intregrity as much as possible. Long-term use of such medications must be closely monitored, however, due to the discomforting, and potentially debilitating and life-threatening side-effects.<ref name=bcrt/><ref name=bcrttwo>{{cite journal |author=Becker MD, Wertheim MS, Smith JR, Rosenbaum JT |title=Long-term follow-up of patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy treated with systemic immunosuppressants |journal=Ocul Immuno Inflamm. |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=289–293 |year=2005 |pmid=16159719 |doi=10.1080/09273940490912407 }}</ref><ref name=bcrt>{{cite journal |author=Kiss S, Ahmed M, Letko E, Foster CS |title=Long-term follow-up of patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy treated with corticosteroid-sparing systemic immunomodulatory therapy |journal=Ophthalmology. |volume=112 |issue=6 |pages=1066–1071 |year=2005 |pmid=15936442 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2004.12.036 }}</ref>

Immunosuppressive drugs such as the [[monoclonal antibodies|therapeutic monoclonal antibody]] [[Daclizumab]], [[Cyclosporine]] and [[Methotrexate]] have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction, and even stabilization of both [[vitreous humour|vitreous inflammation]] and [[vasculitis|retinal vasculitis]] has been evident via [[electroretinography]], during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. This is also supported by the observation of elevated levels of IL-2 in the eyes of patients. <ref name=dacl>{{cite journal |author=Kuiper JJW, Mutis T, de Jager W, de Groot-Mijnes JD, Rothova A. |title=Intraocular interleukin-17 and proinflammatory cytokines in HLA-A29-associated birdshot chorioretinopathy. |journal=Am J Ophthalmol.  |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=177–182 |year=2011 |PMID:21570674 |doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2011.01.031}}</ref>Loss of visual acuity unrelated to the inflammation caused by the disorder, however, often remains unchanged despite usage of the drug.
