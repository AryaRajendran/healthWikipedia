'''Enoxaparin''' is a [[low molecular weight heparin]] marketed under the trade names '''Lovenox''', '''Xaparin''' and '''Clexane''', among others. It is an anticoagulant used to prevent and treat [[deep vein thrombosis]] or [[pulmonary embolism]], and is given as a [[subcutaneous]] injection (by a health care provider or the patient). Its use is evolving in [[acute coronary syndrome]]s (ACS).

Enoxaparin is manufactured by [[Sanofi]] and is derived from the [[intestine|intestinal]] [[mucous membrane|mucosa]] of pigs.  Generic versions are available from [[Amphastar Pharmaceuticals]] and Sandoz.
==Indications==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
* treatment of unstable [[Angina pectoris|angina]] (UA) and non-Q-wave [[myocardial infarction]] (NQMI), administered concurrently with [[aspirin]]
* prophylaxis of DVT
* total hip and knee replacement
* abdominal surgery
* treatment of DVT with or without PE
* treatment of DVT inpatient, with ACS, including STEMI

==Mechanism of action==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Enoxaparin binds to and accelerates the activity of [[antithrombin III]]. By activating antithrombin III, enoxaparin preferentially potentiates the inhibition of [[coagulation factors]] Xa and IIa. The anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin can be directly correlated to its ability to inhibit [[factor Xa]]. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to [[thrombin]], so enoxaparin's inhibition of this process results in decreased thrombin and ultimately the prevention of [[fibrin]] clot formation.

==Monitoring==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
{{Citation needed|reason=Anecdotally, I've often seen LMWHs raise APTT to a lesser extent than unfractionated heparin. They also have less or no effect on thrombin time, depending on which LMWH. However, I don't know at which dosage.|date=October 2010}}
* Anti-[[factor Xa]] levels can be measured, and are generally used to monitor enoxaparin activity in certain subgroups of patients. Anti-factor Xa levels may be recommended in underweight, obese, pregnant, or renally impaired patients. Anti-Xa levels should be checked at their peak at 4 hours after dosing (both q12 and q24 variations). Since the action on F10a/F2a generation is much more important than just anti-F10a concentration LMWH should be monitored by an ultra-specific and ultra-sensitive thrombin generation assay (INCA or EXCA).

==Pregnancy==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Enoxaparin is an FDA pregnancy category B drug, and is not expected to harm an unborn baby. Enoxaparin does not cross the placenta. In animal models, there was no evidence of teratogenic effects or fetotoxicity due to enoxaparin.
Pregnancy alone can raise a woman's risk of life threatening thromboembolic event. Enoxaparin can be used during all stages of pregnancy, however it should be closely monitored by a physician.

==Reversal agent==
[[Protamine]] is less effective at reversing enoxaparin compared to heparin, with a maximum neutralisation of approximately 60% of the anti-factor Xa effect.<ref>http://products.sanofi.ca/en/lovenox.pdf</ref>
