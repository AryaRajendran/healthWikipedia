'''Lotus birth''' is the practice of leaving the [[umbilical cord]] uncut after childbirth so that the baby is left attached to his/her [[placenta]] until the cord naturally separates at the [[umbilicus]], usually a few days after birth.<ref>{{cite book |author=Walsh, Denis Patrick |title=Evidence-based care for normal labour and birth: a guide for midwives |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2007 |page=133 |isbn=0-415-41890-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Lotus births are rare in Western culture.

There is no evidence that there are any benefits for the health of the baby with lotus birth. A spokesman for the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] (RCOG) has stated, "If left for a period of time after the birth, there is a risk of infection in the placenta which can consequently spread to the baby. The placenta is particularly prone to infection as it contains blood. At the post-delivery stage, it has no circulation and is essentially dead tissue," and the RCOG strongly recommends that any baby that undergoes lotus birthing to be monitored closely for infection.<ref>{{cite web|title=RCOG statement on umbilical non-severance or "lotus birth"|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/what-we-do/campaigning-and-opinions/statement/rcog-statement-umbilical-non-severance-or-%E2%80%9Clotus-birth|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>
