A '''chromosomal fragile site''' is a specific heritable point on a [[chromosome]] that tends to form a gap or constriction and may tend to break <ref>Sutherland, GR and Hecht, F: ''Fragile Sites on Human Chromosomes''.

Common fragile sites are considered part of normal chromosome structure and are present in all (or nearly all) individuals in a population. Under normal conditions, most common fragile sites are not especially prone to spontaneous breaks. Common fragile sites are of interest in cancer studies because they are frequently affected in cancer and they can be found in healthy individuals. Sites FRA3B (harboring the ''[[FHIT]]'' gene) and FRA16D (harboring the ''[[WWOX]]'' gene) are two well known examples and have been a major focus of research.  

Rare fragile sites are found in less than 5% of the population, and are often composed of two- or three-nucleotide repeats. They are often susceptible to spontaneous breakage during replication, frequently affecting neighboring genes. Clinically, the most important rare fragile site is FRAXA, which is associated with the [[fragile X syndrome]], the most common cause of hereditary mental retardation.

==Rare Fragile Sites==

===Classification===
Rare fragile sites (RFSs) are classified into two sub-groups based on the compounds that elicit breakage: [[folate]]-sensitive groups (for examples, see <ref>{{cite journal|last=Sutherland|first=GR|coauthors=Jacky, PB; Baker, E; Manuel, A|title=Heritable fragile sites on human chromosomes.

===Mechanisms of Instability===
The CGG and AT-rich repeats characteristic of RFSs can form [[Beta hairpin|hairpins]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gacy|first=AM|coauthors=Goellner, G; Juranić, N; Macura, S; McMurray, CT|title=Trinucleotide repeats that expand in human disease form hairpin structures in vitro.|journal=Cell|date=1995 May 19|volume=81|issue=4|pages=533–40|pmid=7758107}}</ref>  and other non-B DNA structures that block [[replication fork]]s and can result in breakage.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=RD|title=Molecular basis of genetic instability of triplet repeats.|journal=The Journal of biological chemistry|date=1996 Feb 9|volume=271|issue=6|pages=2875–8|pmid=8621672}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Haihua|coauthors=Freudenreich, Catherine H.|title=An AT-Rich Sequence in Human Common Fragile Site FRA16D Causes Fork Stalling and Chromosome Breakage in S. cerevisiae|journal=Molecular Cell|date=NaN undefined NaN|volume=27|issue=3|pages=367–379|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2007.06.012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Aguilera|first=A|coauthors=Gómez-González, B|title=Genome instability: a mechanistic view of its causes and consequences.|journal=Nature reviews.

==Common Fragile Sites==

===Classification===
Unlike RFSs, common fragile sites (CFSs) are not the result of [[Trinucleotide repeat expansion|nucleotide repeat expansion mutations]].  They are a normal part of the human genome and are typically stable when not under replicative stress.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=DI|coauthors=Huang, H; Wang, L|title=Common fragile sites and cancer (review).|journal=International journal of oncology|date=1998 Jan|volume=12|issue=1|pages=187–96|pmid=9454904}}</ref>  The majority of breakages at CFSs are induced by low doses of the antibiotic aphidocilin (APH).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glover|first=TW|coauthors=Berger, C; Coyle, J; Echo, B|title=DNA polymerase alpha inhibition by aphidicolin induces gaps and breaks at common fragile sites in human chromosomes.|journal=Human genetics|year=1984|volume=67|issue=2|pages=136–42|pmid=6430783}}</ref>  Co-treatment with low concentrations of the [[topoisomerase I]] inhibitor, [[camptothecin]] (CPT), reduces APH-induced breakage.<ref name="Arlt">{{cite journal|last=Arlt|first=MF|coauthors=Glover, TW|title=Inhibition of topoisomerase I prevents chromosome breakage at common fragile sites.|journal=DNA repair|date=2010 Jun 4|volume=9|issue=6|pages=678–89|pmid=20413351}}</ref>  CFS regions are highly conserved in mouse<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shiraishi|first=T|coauthors=Druck, T; Mimori, K; Flomenberg, J; Berk, L; Alder, H; Miller, W; Huebner, K; Croce, CM|title=Sequence conservation at human and mouse orthologous common fragile regions, FRA3B/FHIT and Fra14A2/Fhit.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2001 May 8|volume=98|issue=10|pages=5722–7|pmid=11320209}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Krummel|first=KA|coauthors=Denison, SR; Calhoun, E; Phillips, LA; Smith, DI|title=The common fragile site FRA16D and its associated gene WWOX are highly conserved in the mouse at Fra8E1.|journal=Genes, chromosomes & cancer|date=2002 Jun|volume=34|issue=2|pages=154–67|pmid=11979549}}</ref> and other species, including primates, cat, dog, pig, horse, cow, Indian mole rat, and yeast (for review, see <ref name="Durkin 2007" />).  While CFSs could be a result of higher-order chromosome structure, the conservation throughout species could also indicate that they may have some conserved biological purpose.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schmid|first=M|coauthors=Ott, G; Haaf, T; Scheres, JM|title=Evolutionary conservation of fragile sites induced by 5-azacytidine and 5-azadeoxycytidine in man, gorilla, and chimpanzee.|journal=Human genetics|year=1985|volume=71|issue=4|pages=342–50|pmid=4077049}}</ref>

===Mechanisms of Instability===
The instability of CFSs is proposed to stem from late replication: CFSs are likely to initiate proper replication but slow to complete it, introducing breaks from unreplicated regions of DNA.<ref name="Durkin 2007" />  Late-replication may be a result of formation of non-B DNA structures like hairpins and toroids that stall the replication fork in AT rich regions, analogous to the proposed mechanism of rare fragile site instability.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zlotorynski|first=E|coauthors=Rahat, A; Skaug, J; Ben-Porat, N; Ozeri, E; Hershberg, R; Levi, A; Scherer, SW; Margalit, H; Kerem, B|title=Molecular basis for expression of common and rare fragile sites.|journal=Molecular and cellular biology|date=2003 Oct|volume=23|issue=20|pages=7143–51|pmid=14517285}}</ref>  Ataxia-telengiectasia and Rad3 Related (ATR) checkpoint kinase is required for maintaining stability of CFS under both stressed and normal replicating conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Casper|first=Anne M.|coauthors=Nghiem, Paul; Arlt, Martin F.; Glover, Thomas W.|title=ATR Regulates Fragile Site Stability|journal=Cell|date=1 December 2002|volume=111|issue=6|pages=779–789|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01113-3}}</ref>  Breakage is reduced after treatment with CPT (without APH), signifying that CPT also has a necessary role in stabilizing CFSs.<ref name="Arlt" />

==Clinical Relevance==
	Fragile sites are associated with numerous disorders and diseases, both [[heritable]] and not.  The FRAXA site is perhaps most famous for its role in [[Fragile X syndrome]], but fragile sites are clinically implicated in many other important diseases, such as [[cancer]].

High frequency of deletions at breakpoints within these fragile sites has been associated with many cancers, including breast, lung, and gastric cancers (for review, see <ref name="Durkin 2007" /> )
	[[MicroRNA]] genes, which are preferentially involved in chromosomal alterations, are frequencly located at fragile sites.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Calin|first=GA|coauthors=Sevignani, C; Dumitru, CD; Hyslop, T; Noch, E; Yendamuri, S; Shimizu, M; Rattan, S; Bullrich, F; Negrini, M; Croce, CM|title=Human microRNA genes are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2004 Mar 2|volume=101|issue=9|pages=2999–3004|pmid=14973191}}</ref>  Chromosomal alterations may lead to deregulation of microRNA, which could be of diagnostic and prognostic significance for cancers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Calin|first=GA|coauthors=Croce, CM|title=Chromosomal rearrangements and microRNAs: a new cancer link with clinical implications.|journal=The Journal of clinical investigation|date=2007 Aug|volume=117|issue=8|pages=2059–66|pmid=17671640}}</ref>
