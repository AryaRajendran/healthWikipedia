The '''[[dopamine]] [[active transport|transporter]]''' (also '''dopamine active transporter''', '''DAT''', '''SLC6A3''') is a membrane-spanning protein that pumps the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]] out of the synapse back into [[cytosol]], from which other transporters sequester DA and NE into vesicles for later storage and release.  Dopamine reuptake via DAT provides the primary mechanism through which dopamine is cleared from [[synapse]]s, although  there may be an exception in the prefrontal cortex, where evidence points to a possibly larger role of the [[norepinephrine transporter]].<ref>[neuro dot cjb dot net/cgi/content/abstract/22/2/389 Blockade of the Noradrenaline Carrier Increases Extracellular Dopamine Concentrations in the Prefrontal Cortex: Evidence that Dopamine Is Taken up In Vivo by Noradrenergic Terminals]</ref><ref>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/22/2/389</ref>
 
DAT is thought to be implicated in a number of dopamine-related disorders, including [[ADHD|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[clinical depression]], and [[alcoholism]]. The [[gene]] that encodes the DAT protein is located on human chromosome 5, consists of 15 coding [[exons]], and is roughly 64 [[base pair#Length measurements|kbp]] long. Evidence for the associations between DAT and dopamine related disorders has come from a type of [[genetic polymorphism]], known as a [[VNTR]], in the DAT gene ([[DAT1]]), which influences the amount of protein expressed.<ref name="Vandenbergh DJ 1992 1104–1106">{{cite journal |author=Vandenbergh DJ |title=Human dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) maps to chromosome 5p15.3 and displays a VNTR |journal=Genomics |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=1104–1106 |year=1992 |pmid=1478653 |doi=10.1016/S0888-7543(05)80138-7 |author-separator=, |author2=Persico AM |author3=Hawkins AL |display-authors=3 |last4=Griffin |first4=C |last5=Li |first5=X |last6=Jabs |first6=E |last7=Uhl |first7=G}}</ref>

==Function==

DAT is an [[integral membrane protein]] that removes dopamine from the [[synaptic cleft]] and deposits it into surrounding cells, thus terminating the signal of the neurotransmitter.  [[Dopamine]] underlies several aspects of cognition, including reward, and DAT facilitates regulation of that signal.<ref name=Schultz>{{cite journal |author=Schultz W |title=Predictive reward signal of dopamine neurons |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |year=1998 |pmid=9658025 |doi=}}</ref>

==Mechanism==

DAT is a [[symporter]] that moves dopamine across the cell membrane by coupling the movement to the energetically-favorable movement of sodium ions moving from high to low concentration into the cell. DAT function requires the sequential binding and [[co-transport]] of two [[Na+]] [[ion]]s and one [[Cl-]] ion with the dopamine substrate. The driving force for DAT-mediated dopamine reuptake is the ion concentration gradient generated by the plasma membrane [[Na+/K+ ATPase]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Torres GE, Gainetdinov RR, Caron MG |title=Plasma membrane monoamine transporters: structure, regulation and function |journal=Nat. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=13–25 |year=2003 |pmid=12511858 |doi=10.1038/nrn1008}}</ref>

In the most widely-accepted model for [[monoamine transporter]] function, sodium ions must bind to the extracellular domain of the transporter before dopamine can bind. Once dopamine binds, the protein undergoes a conformational change, which allows both sodium and dopamine to unbind on the intracellular side of the membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sonders MS, Zhu SJ, Zahniser NR, Kavanaugh MP, Amara SG |title=Multiple ionic conductances of the human dopamine transporter: the actions of dopamine and psychostimulants |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=960–74 |year=1997 |pmid=8994051 |doi=}}</ref>

Studies using [[electrophysiology]] and radioactive-labeled dopamine have confirmed that the dopamine transporter is similar to other monoamine transporters in that one molecule of neurotransmitter can be transported across the membrane with one or two sodium ions.  Chloride ions are also needed to prevent a buildup of positive charge.  These studies have also shown that transport rate and direction is totally dependent on the sodium gradient.<ref name=wheeler>{{cite journal |author=Wheeler DD, Edwards AM, Chapman BM, Ondo JG |title=A model of the sodium dependence of dopamine uptake in rat striatal synaptosomes |journal=Neurochem. Res. |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=927–936 |year=1993 |pmid=8371835 |doi=10.1007/BF00998279}}</ref>

Because of the tight coupling of the [[membrane potential]] and the sodium gradient, activity-induced changes in membrane polarity can dramatically influence transport rates.  In addition, the transporter may contribute to dopamine release when the neuron depolarizes.<ref name=wheeler/>

==Protein Structure==

The initial determination of the membrane topology of DAT was based upon [[Hydrophilicity plot|hydrophobic sequence analysis]] and sequence similarities with the GABA transporter. These methods predicted twelve [[transmembrane domain]]s (TMD) with a large extracellular loop between the third and fourth TMDs.<ref name=kilty>{{cite journal |author=Kilty JE, Lorang D, Amara SG |title=Cloning and expression of a cocaine-sensitive rat dopamine transporter |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5031 |pages=578–579 |year=1991 |pmid=1948035 |doi=10.1126/science.1948035}}</ref> Further characterization of this protein used [[proteases]], which digest proteins into smaller fragments, and glycosylation, which occurs only on extracellular loops, and largely verified the initial predictions of membrane topology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vaughan RA, Kuhar MJ |title=Dopamine transporter ligand binding domains.

==Location and distribution==

Regional distribution of DAT has been found in areas of the brain with established dopaminergic circuitry including: [[nigrostriatal pathway|nigrostriatal]], [[mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]], and [[mesocortical pathway|mesocortical]] pathways.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ciliax BJ |title=Immunocytochemical localization of the dopamine transporter in human brain |journal=J.

DAT in the [[mesocortical pathway]], labeled with radioactive antibodies, was found to be enriched in dendrites and cell bodies of neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] pars compacta and [[ventral tegmental area]]. This pattern makes sense for a protein that regulates dopamine levels in the synapse.

Staining in the [[striatum]] and [[nucleus accumbens]] of the mesolimbic pathway was dense and heterogeneous.  In the striatum, DAT is localized in the plasma membrane of axon terminals. Double [[immunocytochemistry]] demonstrated DAT colocalization with two other markers of [[nigrostriatal]] terminals, [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] and [[Receptors, dopamine d2|D2 dopamine receptors]]. The latter was thus demonstrated to be an [[autoreceptor]] on cells that release dopamine.

Surprisingly, DAT was not identified within any synaptic active zones. These results suggest that striatal dopamine reuptake may occur outside of synaptic specializations once dopamine diffuses from the synaptic cleft.

In the [[substantia nigra]], DAT appears to be specifically transported into dendrites, where it can be found in [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]], [[plasma membrane]], and pre- and postsynaptic active zones. These localizations suggest that DAT modulates the intracellular and extracellular dopamine levels of nigral dendrites.

Within the [[perikarya]] of [[pars compacta]] neurons, DAT was localized primarily to rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, [[Golgi complex]], and multivesicular bodies, identifying probable sites of synthesis, modification, transport, and degradation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hersch SM, Yi H, Heilman CJ, Edwards RH, Levey AI |title=Subcellular localization and molecular topology of the dopamine transporter in the striatum and substantia nigra |journal=J.

==Biological role and disorders==

The rate at which DAT removes dopamine from the synapse can have a profound effect on the amount of dopamine in the cell.  This is best evidenced by the severe cognitive deficits, motor abnormalities, and hyperactivity of mice with no dopamine transporters.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gainetdinov RR, Wetsel WC, Jones SR, Levin ED, Jaber M, Caron MG |title=Role of serotonin in the paradoxical calming effect of psychostimulants on hyperactivity |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5400 |pages=397–401 |year=1999 |pmid=9888856 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5400.397}}</ref>  These characteristics have striking similarities to the symptoms of [[ADHD]].

==Pharmacology==

[[Image:DAT1regulation.jpg|thumb|400px|Mechanisms of Cocaine and Amphetamine DAT blocking]]DAT is also the target of several "DAT-releasers" & “DAT-blockers” including [[amphetamines]] and [[cocaine]].  These chemicals inhibit the action of DAT and, to a lesser extent, the other monoamine transporters, but their effects are mediated by separate mechanisms.

Cocaine blocks DAT by binding directly to the transporter and reducing the rate of transport.<ref name=kilty/> In contrast, amphetamines trigger a signal cascade thought to involve PKC or MAPK that leads to the internalization of DAT molecules, which are normally expressed on the neuron’s surface.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kahlig KM, Javitch JA, Galli A |title=Amphetamine regulation of dopamine transport.

Amphetamine on DAT also has a direct effect in the increased levels of secreted dopamine.  Lipophilic AMPH diffuses into the cytoplasm and into the dopamine secretory vesicles disrupting the proton gradient established across the vesicle wall.  This induces a leaky channel and DA diffuses out into the cytoplasm.  Additionally, AMPH causes a reversal of normal DA flow at the DAT.  Instead of DA reuptake, in the presence of AMPH, a reversal in the mechanism of DAT occurs causing an outflow of dopamine released into the cytoplasm into the synaptic space changing it from a symporter to an antiporter-like functionality.<ref name="pmid17437">{{cite journal |author=Moore KE |title=The actions of amphetamine on neurotransmitters: a brief review |journal=Biol.
