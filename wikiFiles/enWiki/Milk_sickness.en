'''Milk sickness''', also known as '''tremetol vomiting''' or, in animals as '''trembles''', is characterized by trembling, vomiting, and severe intestinal pain that affects individuals who ingest [[milk]], other dairy products, or meat from a cow that has fed on [[White Snakeroot|white snakeroot]], which contains the poison tremetol. 

Although very rare today, milk sickness claimed thousands of lives among European-American migrants to the Midwest in the early 19th century in the United States, especially in frontier areas along the [[Ohio River]] Valley and its tributaries where white snakeroot was prevalent, because the new settlers were unfamiliar with the plant and its properties. A notable victim was [[Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], the mother of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Nursing calves and lambs may have died from their mothers' milk contaminated with snakeroot, although the adult cows and sheep showed no signs of poisoning. Cattle, horses, and sheep are the animals most often poisoned. 

Anna Pierce Hobbs Bixby, called Dr. Anna on the frontier, is credited today by the American medical community with having identified white snakeroot as the cause of the illness. Told about the plant's properties by an elderly [[Shawnee]] woman she befriended, Bixby did testing to observe and document evidence, and wrote up her findings to share the discovery. The Shawnee woman's name has been lost to history.

Milk sickness was suspected as a disease in the early 19th century, as European-American migrants moved into the Midwest, first into the areas bordering the [[Ohio River]] and its tributaries. They often grazed their cattle in frontier areas where white snakeroot grows; it is a member of the daisy family. They were unfamiliar with the plant and its properties, as it is not found on the East Coast. The high rate of fatalities from milk sickness made people fear it as they did the [[infectious diseases]] of [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]], whose causes were not understood at the time.<ref name="snively">{{cite journal|last=Snively|first=William D.|coauthors=Furbee, Louanna|title=Discoverer of the Cause of Milk Sickness|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=20 June 1966|volume=196|issue=12|pages=1055–1060|doi=10.1001/jama.1966.03100250065022}}</ref> Cattle do not graze on the plant unless other forage is not available. When pastures were scarce or in times of drought, the cattle would graze in woods, the habitat of white snakeroot. Early settlers often let their livestock roam freely in the woods.

Milk sickness was first described in writing by a European American in 1809, when Dr. Thomas Barbee of [[Bourbon County, Kentucky]], detailed its symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Kleber, John E | url = http://books.google.com/?id=8eFSK4o--M0C&pg=PA637&lpg=PA637&dq=%22milk+sickness%22+1809 | title = Milk Sickness | work = The Kentucky Encyclopedia | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-8131-1772-0 | unused_data = John E. Kleber, Kentucky Bicentennial Commission, Lowell H. Harrison, Thomas Dionysius Clark}}</ref> Variously described as "the trembles", "the slows" or the illness "under which man turns sick and his domestic animals tremble," it was a frequent cause of illness and death. The fatality rate was so high that sometimes half the people in a frontier settlement might die of milk sickness. Doctors used their contemporary treatment of [[bloodletting]], but it had little success as it was unrelated to the cause of the illness. 

Cases were identified in [[Ohio]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Indiana]], and [[Illinois]]. The illness was particularly ruinous in [[Henderson County, Kentucky]], along the banks of the [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]]. Because of the losses from the illness, on January 29, 1830, the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] offered a US$600 reward to anyone discovering its cause. Many scientists in the area tried to determine the cause of the illness, but without success. Farmers found that only clearing the riverbanks and grazing cattle on tended fields ended the occurrence of milk sickness.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/27792690 Walter J. Daly, "'The Slows', The Torment of Milk Sickness on the Midwest Frontier"], ''Indiana Magazine of History'', Vol. 102, No. 1, March 2006</ref>

American medical science did not officially identify the cause of milk sickness as the tremetol of the white snakeroot plant until 1928, when advances in [[biochemistry]] enabled the analysis of the plant's toxin.<ref name="snively1"/> However, anecdotal evidence and local Illinois legend today credit Dr. [[Anna Pierce Hobbs Bixby|Anna Pierce Hobbs]] (1808–1869) of [[Hardin County, Illinois]], as the first European American to learn the cause of the illness in the 1830s. She first learned of the plant's properties and its effect on humans from an elder Shawnee woman, who had deep knowledge of herbs and plants in the area.<ref name="Allen">[http://books.google.com/books?id=CB64JHyHII0C&source=gbs_book_other_versions John W. Allen, ''It Happened in Southern Illinois''], Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1968 (reprint, paperback, 2010 - Googlebook version), pp. 5-6, accessed 1 July 2011</ref> 

Hobbs had migrated as a girl to the Illinois country with her parents, but returned to Philadelphia to study medicine: her studies included nursing, midwifery and [[dental extraction]], the sum of what women at the time could study in medicine.<ref name="snively1"/> After her return to southern Illinois, she started practicing and also worked as a teacher. She was familiarly called Dr. Anna. She soon married Isaac Hobbs, son of a neighboring farmer. When milk sickness broke out, Anna Hobbs studied the characteristics of the illness and noted the results in her diary. She determined that it occurred seasonally, beginning in summer and continuing until the first frost. She noted that it was more prominent in cattle than in other animals, and thought it might be due to a plant which the cattle were eating.

The legend says that while following the cattle in search of the cause, Dr. Hobbs happened upon an elderly [[Shawnee]] woman, whom she befriended. During their conversations, the Shawnee told her that the white snakeroot plant caused milk sickness in humans. Hobbs tested this by feeding the plant to a calf and observed its poisonous properties when the animal died; she had fed other plants to other calves that survived. With that evidence, she gathered members of her community to dig up and eradicate the plant from their settlement. Although Dr. Hobbs learned valuable information from the Shawnee woman and did additional study to demonstrate proof of it, by her death in 1869, she had received no official credit from the medical community for her writing about milk sickness.<ref name="snively1">W. D. Snively, ''Minnesota Medicine,'' V. 50, April 1967, pp. 469-476</ref> After her first husband died of pneumonia, Anna Hobbs married Eson Bixby;<ref name="Allen"/> she subsequently came to be known by his surname.

== Milk sickness today ==
Human milk sickness is uncommon today in the United States. Current practices of animal husbandry generally control the pastures and feed of cattle, and the pooling of milk from many producers lowers the risk of tremetol present in dangerous amounts. The poison tremetol is not inactivated by pasteurization<ref name="Maratea">[http://www.addl.purdue.edu/newsletters/2004/winter/finaldx.asp Kim Maratea, "Final Diagnosis: White Snakeroot Intoxication in a Calf"], ''Winter 2003 Newsletter,'' Purdue University, accessed 9 January 2012</ref><!--Note, particularly, the Discussion portion.  Generally, alcohols are not broken down by low heat.-->. Although extremely rare, milk sickness can occur if a person drinks contaminated milk or eats dairy products gathered from a single cow or from a smaller herd that has fed on the white snakeroot plant.
