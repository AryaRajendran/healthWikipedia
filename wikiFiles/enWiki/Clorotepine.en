'''Clorotepine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; '''Clotepin''', '''Clopiben'''), also known as '''octoclothepin''' or '''octoclothepine''', is a very [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[atypical neuroleptic]] and [[central depressant]] of the [[tricyclic]] series which was derived from [[perathiepin]] in 1965 and soon thereafter marketed in the [[Czech Republic]] by [[Spofa]] for the treatment of [[schizophrenic]] [[psychosis]].<ref name="Index nominum 2000: international drug directory">{{cite book | title = Index nominum 2000: international drug directory | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&pg=PA265 | accessdate = 26 November 2011 | year = 2000 | publisher = Taylor & Francis US | isbn = 978-3-88763-075-1 | pages = 265}}</ref><ref name="GanellinTriggle1997">{{cite book | author1 = C.
