==History==
The European Institute of Oncology was established to implement an innovative model for health and advanced research in the international oncology field. Its Division and Unit Directors come from eight European countries.
 
Conceived by [[Umberto Veronesi]] and inaugurated in May 1994, the Institute became a research hospital and treatment centre (IRCCS or “Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico”) through the Ministerial Decree issued in January 1996. The European Institute of Oncology adopts the non-profit private-law organisation model and provides services through agreements with Italy’s National Health Service.
 
In keeping with the standards of the most advanced international oncology centres, the Institute fully integrates different activities involved in the fight against cancer: prevention and diagnosis, health education and training, research and treatment.

In addition to the centre in Via Ripamonti, where all clinical, research and training activities take place, in 2002 the institute opened IEO CENTRO, an integrated cancer diagnosis centre located in Milan down town.

===Online publication===
In 2007 the institute launched ''e''cancermedicalscience, a [[not for profit]] [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] [[peer-reviewed]] cancer journal founded by the European Institute of Oncology in [[Milan, Italy]]. It publishes the latest oncology research, with all content free to read. It publishes at no charge to the researcher, with the aim of improving the dissemination of scientific research on cancer and benefiting the patient.  It is unusual as a medical journal in that it is entirely online, using video, blogs, and internet forums to encourage comment and interaction by its users.  Its founding editors are Professor [[Umberto Veronesi]] and Professor [[Gordon McVie]].
