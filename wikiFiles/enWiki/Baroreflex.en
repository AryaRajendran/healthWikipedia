The '''baroreflex''' or '''baroreceptor reflex''' is one of the body's [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms for maintaining [[blood pressure]]. It provides a [[negative feedback loop]] in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes heart rate to decrease therefore causing blood pressure to decrease; likewise, decreased blood pressure activates the baroreflex, causing heart rate to increase thus causing an increase in blood pressure.

The system relies on specialized [[neuron]]s, known as [[baroreceptor]]s, in the [[aortic arch]], [[carotid sinus]]es, and elsewhere to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the [[brainstem]]. Subsequent changes in blood pressure are mediated by the [[autonomic nervous system]]. [[Atrial natriuretic peptide]] forms a parallel negative feedback loop in an endocrinological contrast to the [[renin-angiotensin system]].

==Anatomy of the reflex==
Baroreceptors are present in the auricles of the [[heart]] and [[vena cavae]], but the most sensitive baroreceptors are in the [[carotid sinus]]es and [[aortic arch]]. The [[carotid sinus]] [[baroreceptors]] are innervated by the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX); the aortic arch baroreceptors are innervated by the [[vagus nerve]] (CN X). Baroreceptor activity travels along these nerves, which contact the [[nucleus of the solitary tract]] (NTS) in the brainstem.

The NTS sends excitatory fibers ([[glutamate]]rgic) to the [[caudal ventrolateral medulla]] (CVLM), activating the CVLM.  The activated CVLM then sends inhibitory fibers (GABAergic) to the [[rostral ventrolateral medulla]] (RVLM), thus inhibiting the RVLM.  The RVLM is the primary regulator of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], sending excitatory fibers ([[glutamate]]rgic) to the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] preganglionic neurons located in the intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord.  Hence, when the baroreceptors are activated (by an increased blood pressure), the NTS activates the CVLM, which in turn inhibits the RVLM, thus inhibiting the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] branch of the autonomic nervous system, leading to a decrease in blood pressure.  Likewise, low blood pressure causes an increase in [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] tone via "disinhibition" (less inhibition, hence activation) of the RVLM.

The NTS also sends excitatory fibers to the [[Nucleus ambiguus]] (vagal nuclei) that regulate the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], aiding in the decrease in sympathetic activity during conditions of elevated blood pressure.

==Baroreceptor activation==
The [[baroreceptors]] are [[stretching|stretch]]-sensitive [[mechanoreceptor]]s. When blood pressure rises, the carotid and aortic sinuses are distended, resulting in stretch and, therefore, activation of the baroreceptors. Active baroreceptors fire [[action potential]]s ("spikes") more frequently than inactive baroreceptors. The greater the stretch the more rapidly baroreceptors fire action potentials.

These action potentials are relayed to the nucleus of the [[Solitary nucleus|tractus solitarius]] (NTS), which uses frequency as a measure of blood pressure. As discussed previously, increased activation of the NTS inhibits the [[vasomotor center]] and stimulates the [[vagal]] nuclei. The end-result of baroreceptor activation is inhibition of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and activation of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]].

The [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic]] branches of the [[autonomic nervous system]] have opposing effects on blood pressure. Sympathetic activation leads to an elevation of [[total peripheral resistance]] and [[cardiac output]] via increased [[contractility]] of the heart, [[heart rate]], and arterial [[vasoconstriction]], which tends to increase blood pressure. Conversely, [[parasympathetic]] activation leads to decreased [[cardiac output]] via decrease in heart rate, resulting in a tendency to lower blood pressure.

By coupling [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] inhibition and [[parasympathetic]] activation, the baroreflex maximizes blood pressure reduction. [[sympathetic nervous system|Sympathetic]] inhibition leads to a drop in peripheral resistance, while parasympathetic activation leads to a depressed heart rate ([[reflex bradycardia]]) and [[contractility]]. The combined effects will dramatically decrease blood pressure.

In a similar manner, [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] activation with [[parasympathetic]] inhibition allows the baroreflex to elevate blood pressure.

==Set point and tonic activation==
Baroreceptor firing has an inhibitory effect on sympathetic outflow. The sympathetic neurones fire at different rates, releasing various amounts of Norepinephrine. Norepinephrine constricts blood vessels to increase blood pressure. When Baroreceptors are stretched (due to an increased blood pressure) their firing rate increases which in turn increases the inhibitory effect on sympathetic outflow resulting in reduced norepinephrine production and a corresponding reduction in blood pressure. When the blood pressure is low, baroreceptor firing is lowered; this reduces the inhibitory effect on the sympathetic outflow and consequently an increased amount of norepinephrine is released to receptors, causing blood vessels to constrict thus increasing blood pressure.

==Effect on heart rate variability==
The baroreflex may be responsible for a part of the low-frequency component of [[heart rate variability]], the so-called [[Mayer waves]], at 0.1 Hz [Sleight, 1995].

== Baroreflex activation therapy for treatment of resistant hypertension==
Published feasibility studies have shown that a pacemaker-like device designed to electrically activate the baroreflex, also known as baroreflex activation therapy, significantly lowers blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. One study published on a group of 16 patients reported an average systolic blood pressure reduction of 34 mmHg after three months of treatment and 35 mmHg after 24 months. A drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg was achieved in 12 of 16 (75%) patients at 2 years, and 5 of 16 (31%) achieved a systolic BP of less than 140 mmHg at 2 years.<ref>Scheffers. Journal of Hypertension 2008;26(Suppl 1):S19.</ref> Results published on a separate group of 10 patients from another feasibility trial reported an average systolic blood pressure reduction of 24 mmHg after three months of treatment.<ref>Bisognano J. The Journal of Clinical Hypertension 2006; Suppl A8 (No 4):A43</ref> Baroreflex activation therapy devices have received CE Mark for European sale, but have not received FDA approval for sale in the United States.
