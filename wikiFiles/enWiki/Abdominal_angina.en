'''Abdominal angina''' is [[postprandial]] [[abdominal pain]] that occurs in individuals with insufficient blood flow to meet [[mesenteric]] [[visceral]] demands.<ref name="pmid16424623">{{cite journal |author=Kapadia S, Parakh R, Grover T, Agarwal S |title=Side-to-side aorto-mesenteric anastomosis for management of abdominal angina |journal=Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=256–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16424623 |doi=}}</ref> The term ''angina'' is used in reference to [[angina pectoris]], a similar symptom due to obstruction of the [[coronary artery]]. The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines abdominal angina as "Intermittent abdominal pain, frequently occurring at a fixed time after eating, caused by inadequacy of the [[mesenteric]] circulation. Also called  [[intestinal]] angina."

== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiology is similar to that seen in [[angina pectoris]] and [[intermittent claudication]]. The most common cause of abdominal angina is atherosclerotic vascular disease, where the occlusive process commonly involves the ostia and the proximal few centimeters of the mesenteric vessels. 
It can be associated with:

== Frequency ==
*''Internationally'': Extremely rare. True incidence is unknown
*''Race'': No data available
*''Sex'': Females outnumber males by approximately 3 to 1{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
*''Age'': Mean age of affected individuals is slightly older than 60 years{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

== Clinical ==
*''Hallmark of condition'': Disabling midepigastric or central abdominal pain within 10–15 minutes after eating.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
*''Physical examination'': The abdomen typically is scaphoid and soft, even during an episode of pain. Patients present with stigmata of weight loss and signs of peripheral vascular disease, particularly aortoiliac occlusive disease, may be present.
*''Causes'': Smoking is an associated risk factor. In most series, approximately 75-80% of patients smoke.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Treatment==
[[Stent]]s have been used in the treatment of abdominal angina.<ref name="pmid11292915">{{cite journal |author=Senechal Q, Massoni JM, Laurian C, Pernes JM |title=Transient relief of abdominal angina by Wallstent placement into an occluded superior mesenteric artery |journal=The Journal of cardiovascular surgery |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=101–5 |year=2001 |pmid=11292915 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid9418203">{{cite journal |author=Busquet J |title=Intravascular stenting in the superior mesenteric artery for chronic abdominal angina |journal=Journal of endovascular surgery : the official journal of the International Society for Endovascular Surgery |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=380–4 |year=1997 |pmid=9418203 |doi=10.1583/1074-6218(1997)004<0380:ISITSM>2.0.CO;2 |issn=1074-6218}}</ref>
