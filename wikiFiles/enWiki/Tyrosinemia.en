'''Tyrosinemia''' (or "Tyrosinaemia") is an error of [[metabolism]], usually inborn, in which the body cannot effectively break down the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]]. Symptoms include liver and kidney disturbances and mental retardation. Untreated, tyrosinemia can be fatal.

Most inborn forms of tyrosinemia produce hypertyrosinemia (high levels of tyrosine).<ref>

==Types==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Tyrosinemia is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern.]] There are three types of tyrosinemia, each with distinctive symptoms and caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme. 
* [[Type I tyrosinemia]]
* [[Type II tyrosinemia]]
* [[Type III tyrosinemia]]

==Treatment==
Treatment varies depending on the specific type. A [[low protein diet]] may be required in the management of tyrosinemia. Recent experience with [[NTBC]] has shown to be very effective. The most effective treatment in patients with tyrosinemia type I seems to be full or partial liver transplant.
