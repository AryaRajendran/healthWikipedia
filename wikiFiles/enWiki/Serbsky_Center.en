'''The Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry''' ({{lang-ru|Госуда́рственный нау́чный центр социа́льной и суде́бной психиатри́и им. В.П.Се́рбского}}) is a [[psychiatric hospital]] and the main center for the [[forensic psychiatry]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]]. The institution was in the past briefly called the Serbsky Institute and is now called the Serbsky Center. Its hospital got much negative publicity because many [[Soviet dissidents]] were [[incarcerated]] and [[tortured]] there.

The Institute was organized in 1921. The institute is named after Russian psychiatrist [[Vladimir Serbsky]]. One of the main stated purpose of the institute is forensic psychiatry for the criminal courts. Moscow Serbsky Institute conducts more than 2,500 court-ordered evaluations per year.<ref name=serbskyru>[http://www.serbsky.ru/ Official Site] {{ru icon}}</ref>

The Institute also claimed leadership in studying different types of [[psychosis]], brain trauma, [[alcoholism]] and [[drug addiction]].

The official Soviet psychiatric science also came up with the definition of "[[sluggishly progressing schizophrenia]]", a special form of the illness that supposedly affects only the person's social behavior, with no trace on other traits: "most frequently, ideas about a ''struggle for truth and justice'' are formed by personalities with a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] structure," according to the Serbsky Institute professors (a quote <ref>Applebaum, 2003</ref> from [[Vladimir Bukovsky]]'s archives). Some of them had high rank in the [[MVD]], such as the infamous Danil Luntz, who was characterized by [[Viktor Nekipelov]] as "no better than the criminal doctors who performed inhuman experiments on the prisoners in [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s".<ref name="Applebaum">{{cite book|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|authorlink=Anne Applebaum|title=Gulag: a history|year=2004|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=1-4000-3409-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fCurJRhH-GgC}}</ref>

== Post-Soviet times ==
The Center underwent many changes over the last 10 or 15 years and psychiatry is not used for suppression of dissenters anymore, the Center Director [[Tatyana Dmitrieva]] said. The rooms where Soviet dissidents were imprisoned are used only to treat alcohol and drug addicts now.<ref name=newsru/>

Many psychiatric trials were pursued in order to confirm the inability to understand of many high-rank officials in cases of rapes and murders, as occurred in [[Chechnya]] by [[Yuri Budanov]] (he was eventually charged for his crimes, after more than three years of trials).

On the other hand, [[Yuri Savenko]], the head of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]], alleges that "practically nothing has changed. They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, and they do not want to apologize for all their actions in the past."<ref name="Glasser"/> Attorney Karen Nersisyan agrees: "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It’s an organ of power."<ref name="Glasser"/> In Savenko's words, breaking the main commandment of doctor, the very practice of the institution is not often determined by professional interests. As a result, the healthy are declared the severely mentally ill (for example, general P. Grigorenko or colonel Yu. Budanov), exceptional conditions (for example, major D. Evsyukov’s, actor F. Yalovega’s) are declared a norm, and the ill are declared the healthy (for example, diplomat [[Platon Obukhov]]).<ref name="К 120-летию">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|title=К 120-летию Осипа Мандельштама и 90-летию ГНЦ социальной и судебной психиатрии им.

== Drop in the level of forensic expert reports of the Serbsky Center ==
In 2004, Yuri Savenko stated that the passed law on state expert activity and introduction of profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into a complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule.<ref name="Отчетный доклад"/> Formerly, a court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution.<ref name="Отчетный доклад"/> An expert has the right to participate only in commissions, in which he is included by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years.<ref name="Отчетный доклад"/> The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is only one in the country and is located in her Center.<ref name="Отчетный доклад"/> No one had ever had such a monopolism.<ref name="Отчетный доклад"/>

According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center has long labored to legalize its monopolistic position of the Main expert institution of the country.<ref name="Савенко, Бартенев">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last1=Савенко|first1=Юрий|last2=Бартенев|first2=Дмитрий|title=Психиатр и юрист о новой инициативе центра им.

On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko wrote to the [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] an [[open letter]], in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the [[State Duma]] a draft law prepared by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address a sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to a lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization.<ref name="Открытое письмо"/> The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped to such an extent that it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of a report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise.<ref name="Открытое письмо"/> According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts’ findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.<ref name="Открытое письмо"/> In the spring of 2009, the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia appealed against an expert report whose descriptive part was first distorted, that paves the way for unlimited falsifications; this is a case whose four of six examinations were carried out in the Serbsky Center, wrote Savenko in the letter.<ref name="Открытое письмо"/>

On 15 June 2009, the working group chaired by the Director of the Serbsky Center [[Tatyana Dmitrieva]] sent the [[Supreme Court of Russia]] a joint application whose purport was to declare appealing against the forensic expert reports of state expert institutions illegal and prohibit courts from receiving lawsuits filed to appeal against the reports.<ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/> The reason put forward for the proposal was that appeals against expert reports are allegedly filed “without regard for the scope of case” and that one must appeal against an expert report “only together with a sentence.”<ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/> In other words, according to Yuri Savenko, all professional errors and omissions are presented as untouchable by virtue of the fact that they were infiltrated into the sentence.<ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/> That is cynicism of administrative resources, cynicism of power, he says.<ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/>

The draft of the application to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper “Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation” by E.Y. Shchukina and S.N. Shishkov<ref name="Щукина, Шишков">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last1=Щукина|first1=Елена|last2=Шишков|first2=Сергей|title=Актуальные правовые вопросы судебно-психиатрической экспертизы|journal=Российский психиатрический журнал|year=2009|issue=№ 6|pages=24–28|url=http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=13037938|publisher=Издательская группа "ГЭОТАР-Медиа"|issn=1560–957X}}</ref> focusing on the inadmissibility of appealing against an expert report without regard for the scope of evaluated case.<ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/> While talking about appealing against “reports”, the authors of the paper, according to lawyer Dmitry Bartenev, mistakenly equate reports with actions of experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of “parallel” examination and evaluation of actions of experts without regard for the scope of evaluated case.<ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/> Such a point of view taken by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a separate appeal.<ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/>

In 2010, when the outpatient forensic-psychiatric examination of [[Yulia Privedyonnaya]], a member of a youth organization, was carried out in the Sebsky Center, its experts asked her the question “What do you think of Putin?” that Savenko called an inappropriate, unseemly, indelicate, and police one.<ref name="Как Вы относитесь к Путину?">{{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|title=Как Вы относитесь к Путину?|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2010|issue=№ 1|pages=93–94|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2010/1/20_putin.htm|accessdate=31 July 2011}}</ref>
