In [[nephrology]], '''vascular access steal syndrome''' or '''Dialysis-associated Steal Syndrome (DASS)''', also known less precisely as '''steal syndrome''', refers to [[ischemia|vascular insufficiency]] resulting from an [[arteriovenous fistula]] or synthetic vascular graft-AV fistula).  

==Signs==
*[[Pallor]] 
*Diminished [[pulse]]s (distal to the fistula)
*Necrosis<ref>{{cite journal | author = Porcellini M, Selvetella L, De Rosa P, Baldassarre M, Bauleo A, Capasso R | title = [Hand ischemia due to "steal syndrome" in vascular access for hemodialysis] | journal = G Chir | volume = 18 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 27–30 | year = 1997| pmid = 9206477}}</ref>
*Decreased wrist-[[brachial artery|brachial]] index (ratio of [[blood pressure]] measured in the wrist and the blood pressure measured in the upper arm), especially if below 0.6<ref>{{cite journal | author = Shemesh D, Mabjeesh NJ, Abramowitz HB | title = Management of dialysis access-associated steal syndrome: use of intraoperative duplex ultrasound scanning for optimal flow reduction | journal = J Vasc Surg | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 193–5 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10394170 | doi = 10.1016/S0741-5214(99)70192-8}}</ref> 

==Symptoms==
*[[Pain and nociception|Pain]] distal to the fistula.

==Incidence==
DASS occurs in about 1% of AV fistulas and 2.7-8% of PTFE grafts. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Morsy AH, Kulbaski M, Chen C, Isiklar H, Lumsden AB. | title = Incidence and characteristics of patients with hand ischemia after a hemodialysis access procedure | journal = J Surg Res | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–10 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9536965 | doi = 10.1006/jsre.1997.5206}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Goff CD, Sato DT, Bloch PH, DeMasi RJ, Gregory RT, Gayle RG, Parent FN, Meier GH, Wheeler JR. | title = Steal syndrome complicating hemodialysis access procedures: can it be predicted? | journal = Ann Vasc Surg | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 138–44 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10742428 | doi = 10.1007/s100169910025}}</ref>

==Investigations==
*[[Arteriography]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Asif A, Leon C, Merrill D, Bhimani B, Ellis R, Ladino M, Gadalean F | title = Arterial steal syndrome: a modest proposal for an old paradigm | journal = Am J Kidney Dis | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–97 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16797390 | doi = 10.1053/j.ajkd.2006.03.077}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The fistula flow can be restricted through banding, or modulated through surgical revision.
===Revascularization Techniques===
*[[DRIL]] (Distal Revascularisation and Interval Ligation) procedure
*[[PAI]] (Proximalization of the Arterial Inflow)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zanow J, Kruger U, Scholz H. | title = Proximalization of the arterial inflow: a new technique to treat access-related ischemia | journal = J Vasc Surg | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1216–21 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16765242 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2006.01.025}}</ref>
*RUDI ([[Revision using distal inflow | Revision Using Distal Inflow]])<ref>{{cite journal | author = Minion DJ, Moore E, Endean E. | title = Revision using distal inflow: a novel approach to dialysis-associated steal syndrome | journal = Ann Vasc Surg | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 625–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16052391 | doi = 10.1007/s10016-005-5827-7}}</ref>

===Banding Techniques===
*Narrowing suture<ref>{{cite journal | author = J.C. West, D.J. Bertsch, S.L. Peterson, M.P. Gannon, G. Norkus and R.P. Latsha, Kelley SE. | title = Arterial insufficiency in hemodialysis access procedures: correction by “banding” technique | journal = Transpl Proc | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 1838–40 | year = 1991 | pmid = 2053173}}</ref>
*Plication<ref>{{cite journal | author = S.P. Rivers, L.A. Scher and F.J.

*Minimally invasive [[MILLER banding]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goel N, Miller GA, Jotwani MC, Licht J, Schur I, Arnold WP. | title = Minimally Invasive Limited Ligation Endoluminal-assisted Revision (MILLER) for treatment of dialysis access-associated steal syndrome | journal = Kidney Int | volume = 70 | issue = 4 | pages = 765–70 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16816841 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ki.5001554}}</ref>
*Tapering<ref>{{cite journal | author =  Kirkman RL. | title = Technique for flow reduction in dialysis access fistulas | journal = Surg Gyn Obstet | volume = 172 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–3 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1994500}}</ref>
*Surgical banding<ref>{{cite journal | author =  Anderson CB, Groce MA. | title = Banding of arteriovenous dialysis fistulas to correct high-output cardiac failure | journal = Surgery | volume = 78 | issue = 5 | pages = 552–4 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1188596}}</ref>

If the above methods fail, the fistula is ligated, and a new fistula is created in a more proximal location in the same limb, or in the contralateral limb.
