==Fermentation species==

===Saliva-fermented beverages===
{{main|Saliva-fermented beverages}}
The mycological significance of this '''dual fermentation''' process was previously unrecognized.<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16389951</ref> The process of chewing grains or other starches was used in the production of alcoholic beverages in pre-modern cultures around the world; sake in Japan is an example. To date this tradition is still popular among indigenous communities around the world with cassava being the most commonly used plant.

===Edible mushroom fermentation===
* Wine can be made by using mushroom fruit bodies instead of microorganisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [[Pleurotus ostreatus]] have been demonstrated to produce 12.2% ABV, and [[Agaricus blazei]] 8% ABV. It seems to be a [[functional food]] which can be expected to have preventive effects against [[alcohol and cancer|cancer]] and thrombosis.<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515544</ref>

==Alcoholic beverages by alcohol type==
<!-- Please do not remove this section without Talking (see Talk:Alternative alcohol use) about it first as 20% of the intoxication effects cause by another alcohol than ethanol is large enough to write something about it. -->
Excessive concentrations of some alcohols other than ethanol may cause off-flavors, sometimes described as "spicy", "hot", or "solvent-like".  Some beverages, such as [[rum]], [[whisky]] (especially [[Bourbon whiskey|Bourbon]]), incompletely rectified vodka (e.g. [[Siwucha]]), and traditional [[ale]]s and [[cider]]s, are expected to have relatively high concentrations of non-hazardous alcohols as part of their flavor profile. However, in other beverages, such as [[Korn (liquor)|Korn]], [[vodka]], and [[lager]]s, the presence of other alcohols than ethanol is considered a [[Wine fault|fault]].<ref name="ReferenceB">Aroma of Beer, Wine and Distilled Alcoholic Beverages</ref>

==Ethyl alcohol substitutes==

===Tertiary alcohols===
Alcohols other than ethanol have been used as they are usually not covered by [[alcohol tax]]es and [[alcohol law]]s. Most alcohols are also significantly more potent than ethanol (e.g. 2M2B requires 20 times lower dose), which provides minimal energy intake.

Some tertiary alcohols with historical medical use have been used as ethyl alcohol substitutes as they are not metabolized into toxic aldehydes like acetaldehyde:
* [[2M2B]] - Found in trace quantities in alcoholic beverages, especially cassava fermented. 20 times more potent than ethanol. 2M2B have, despite being 20 x more potent than EtOH, a [[therapeutic index]] of 2.8 that of ethanol (potency compared to EtOH/(EtOH LD50/''t''-AmOH LD50<ref name=oralrat>{{cite PMID | 13028241}}</ref> ratio) = 20/(7060/1000) = 2.8) oral in rat.
* [[Ethchlorvynol]] - During their heyday, they were known on the street as "jelly-bellies" or "pickles".
* [[Methylpentynol]]
* [[UMB68]] - similar in structure to [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]].

===Synthetic alcohol substitute===
A [[Synthetic alcohol substitute]] is a proposed substitute for [[alcoholic beverage]]s, and gives the drinker the effects of drunkenness without many of the risks of alcohol. It is currently being developed by a team at [[Imperial College London]], led by Professor David Nutt, chair of the [[Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs|ISCD]]. It is based on [[benzodiazepine]]s.<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1241069/Ex-drugs-tsar-creates-synthetic-alcohol-gives-buzz-hangover.html</ref>

==Alcohol state of matter==
{{see also|State of matter}}

* [[Solid]]: [[Alcohol powder]] made by molecular encapsulate alcohol, usually with [[cyclodextrin]]. The powder is usable with  different routes of administration (see [[#Routes of adminstration|ROA]] on this page).
* [[Liquid]]: This is the normal state of matter for most alcohols. A unique exception being [[2-Methylpropan-2-ol]] which tends to be a solid at room temperature, with a melting point slightly above 25 °C.
* [[Ga]]s: Alcohol mist can be formed with a [[nebulizer]] for inhalation (see [[#Routes of adminstration|ROA]] on this page).

==Routes of administration==
{{see also|Ethanol#Routes of administration}}

===Orally===
[[Alcohol powder]] is useful with capsules to eliminate the burning taste of [[rectified spirit]] upon ingestion. The powder will produce an alcoholic drink when mixed with water.

====Capsules====
It will require about 20 x 1 gram capsules to provide 20 cL pure ethanol which may be inconvenient. [[2-Methyl-2-butanol|2M2B]] is one of few alcohols potent enough for practical use for alcohol supplementation as it is 20 times more potent. When used in this way combined with [[time release technology]] [[dosage form]] (e.g. a few small-sized capsules with different time-release), potent alcohols can provide low-dose alcohol therapy to eliminate alcohol intoxication, lower the risk for [[alcohol dependency]], and yet provide eventual health effects.

===Inhalation===

====Nebulizer====
[[Alcohol without liquid|Alcohols without liquid]] (AWOL) are a set of nebulizers that evaporate alcohol into mist by mixing it with oxygen for inhalation. Also, [[alcohol powder]] that is molecularly encapsulated with [[cyclodextrin]] can be used with a [[nebulizer]]<ref>{{cite PMID|17089700}}</ref> for easier inhalation into the lungs than the ordinarily harsh vapors.

====Smoking====
[[Menthol]] is an alcohol which act as an analgesic, and has GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic activity.  It is also a weak kappa opioid receptor agonist. It may be smoked from [[Menthol cigarette]]s.

===Injection===

====Intravenously====
Ethanol is usually only injected intravenously as antidote against [[ethylene glycol]] or [[methanol]] poisoning (see [[#Antidote]]). However, diluted distilled beverages are also injected by intravenous drug users, occasionally when they are unable to access other drugs and there is limited alcohol available to get intoxicated orally. One of the tertiary alcohols, [[ethchlorvynol]], is not compatible with intravenous injection and serious injury or death can occur when it is used in this manner<ref>{{cite pmid | 942681}}</ref>

====Intramuscular====
[[Ethanol]] is safe to use intramuscularly.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Rectal and vaginal===
Teens have been known to use vodka-soaked tampons to get drunk.<ref>http://www.kpho.com/story/15981315/teens-using-vodka-tampons-to-get-drunk</ref>

==Applications==

===Medical===

====Antidote====
Pharmaceutical grade ethanol ([[rectified spirit]]) diluted 5–10% in 5% [[dextrose]] is usually given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] as an [[ethylene glycol]] or [[methanol]] poisoning treatment.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent">{{cite journal | author = Brent J | title = Current management of ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Drugs | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 979–88 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11434452 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200161070-00006 | issn = 0012-6667}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1306022/ |title=Standardized Treatment of Severe Methanol Poisoning With Ethanol and Hemodialysis |author=Brent R. Ekins, et al. |journal=West J Med. |year=1985 |month=Mar |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=337–40 |pmc=1306022}}</ref>

However, sometimes ethanol is given orally in the form of [[distilled beverages]] such as [[whisky]], [[vodka]], or [[gin]] for [[ethylene glycol]] or [[methanol]] poisoning treatment when no pharmaceutical ethanol solutions are available.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> In one case, doctors saved a poisoned tourist using a vodka drip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21219366/ns/world_news-weird_news/t/doctors-save-poisoned-tourist-using-vodka-drip/#.UQ79VBipMUM |title=Poisoned tourist saved with vodka drip |publisher=NBC News |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}</ref>

====Tincture====
{{main|Tincture}}
A [[tincture]] is typically an alcoholic extract of plant or animal material or solution.

To qualify as an alcoholic tincture, the extract should have an [[ethanol]] percentage of at least 40-60% or 80-120 [[Alcohol proof|proof]]. Sometimes even a 90% or 180 proof tincture is achieved.<ref name="ReferenceA">Groot Handboek Geneeskrachtige Planten by Geert Verhelst</ref>

====Elixir====
{{main|Elixir}}

Vodka can be used for making elixirs.

An '''elixir''' ({{Lang-ar|الإكسير, ''Al-Ikseer'', ''the effective recipe''}}, {{Lang-gr|ξήριον, ''medical powder''}}, xerion "powder for drying wounds", from ξηρός, xeros ''dry''<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=elixir</ref><ref>http://www.wordnik.com/words/elixir/etymologies</ref>) is a clear, sweet-flavored liquid used for medicinal purposes, to be taken orally and intended to cure one's ills. When used as a [[dosage form|pharmaceutical preparation]], an elixir contains at least one [[active ingredient]] designed to be taken orally.

===Fire breathing===
Distilled beverages (spirits) are often used as fuel in [[fire breathing]].
