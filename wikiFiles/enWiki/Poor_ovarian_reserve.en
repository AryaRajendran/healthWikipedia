'''Poor ovarian reserve:''' (also known as '''impaired ovarian reserve''', '''premature ovarian aging''' or '''declining ovarian reserve''') is a condition of low fertility characterized by 1): low numbers of remaining [[oocytes]] in the ovaries or 2) possibly impaired preantral oocyte development or recruitment.  Recent research suggests that premature ovarian aging and [[premature ovarian failure]] (aka primary ovarian insufficiency) may represent a continuum of premature ovarian senescence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gleicher N, Weghofer A, Oktay K, Barad D |title=Do etiologies of premature ovarian aging (POA) mimic those of premature ovarian failure (POF)? |journal=Hum.

Quality of the eggs (oocytes) may also be impaired as a 1989 study by Scott et al. of 758 IVF cycles showed a dramatic decline in implantation rates between high (> 25 mIU/mL) and low day three FSH (<15 mIU/mL) women even though the ages of the women were equivalent between the two groups (mean age 35 years).<ref>{{cite book |author=Gardner, David K; Weissman, Ariel; Howles, Colin M.; Shoham, Zeev |title=Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Techniques: Laboratory and Clinical Perspectives |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2001 |isbn=1-85317-870-5 |page=528 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Scott RT, Toner JP, Muasher SJ, Oehninger S, Robinson S, Rosenwaks Z |title=Follicle-stimulating hormone levels on cycle day 3 are predictive of in vitro fertilization outcome |journal=Fertil.

==Etiology==
* Natural decline of [[ovarian reserve]] due to age.<ref name="WKmodel">{{cite journal |author=Wallace WH, Kelsey TW |title=Human ovarian reserve from conception to the menopause |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=e8772 |year=2010 |pmid=20111701 |pmc=2811725 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0008772 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008772}}</ref>
* [[Idiopathic]].
* Genetic factors, such as fragile x syndrome.  Approximately 20–28% of women with an FMR1 premutation (55–200 CGG repeats) experience fragile x primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and another 23% experience early menopause (i.e., menopause before the age of forty five).<ref>[http://www.fragilex.org/html/menopause.htm The National Fragile X Foundation]</ref>
* [[Autoimmune disorders]].
* Adrenal gland impairment.
* Iatrogenic, e.g., due to radiation, chemotherapy or surgery, such as laserization of the surface of the ovary to treat endometriosis. Excessive laparoscopic ovarian drilling has been reported to cause premature ovarian failure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seow KM, Juan CC, Hwang JL, Ho LT |title=Laparoscopic surgery in polycystic ovary syndrome: reproductive and metabolic effects |journal=Semin.

==Diagnosis==
There is some controversy as the accuracy of the tests used to predict poor ovarian reserve.  One systematic review concluded that the accuracy of predicting the occurrence of pregnancy is very limited. When a high threshold is used, to prevent couples from wrongly being refused IVF,  only approximately 3% of IVF-indicated cases are identified as having unfavourable prospects in an IVF treatment cycle. Also, the review concluded the use of any ORT (Ovarian Reserve Testing) for outcome prediction cannot be supported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Broekmans FJ, Kwee J, Hendriks DJ, Mol BW, Lambalk CB |title=A systematic review of tests predicting ovarian reserve and IVF outcome |journal=Hum. Reprod. Update |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=685–718 |year=2006 |pmid=16891297 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dml034 |url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16891297}}</ref>  Also [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] statistics show that the success rates for IVF with diminished ovarian reserve vary widely between IVF centers.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ART/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — Assisted Reproduction Technology]</ref>

===Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)===
Elevated serum [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) level measured on day three of the menstrual cycle.  (First day of period flow is counted as day one.  Spotting is not considered start of period.) If a lower value occurs from later testing, the highest value is considered the most predictive. FSH assays can differ somewhat so reference ranges as to what is normal, premenopausal or menopausal should be based on ranges provided by the laboratory doing the testing.  Estradiol (E2) should also be measured as women who ovulate early may have elevated E2 levels above 80 pg/mL (due to early follicle recruitment, possibly due to a low serum inhibin B level) which will mask an elevated FSH level and give a false negative result.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ghumman |first=Surveen |title=Step by Step Ovulation Induction |publisher=Anshan |location=Kent UK |year=2006 |isbn=1-904798-96-9 |page=134 |ref=harv}}</ref>

High FSH strongly predicts poor IVF response in older women, less so in younger women. One study showed an elevated basal day-three FSH is correlated with diminished ovarian reserve in women aged over 35 years and is associated with poor pregnancy rates after treatment of ovulation induction(6% versus 42%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Navot D, Rosenwaks Z, Margalioth EJ |title=Prognostic assessment of female fecundity |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8560 |pages=645–7 |year=1987 |month=September |pmid=2887939 }}</ref> 

The rates for spontaneous pregnancy in older women with elevated FSH levels have not been studied very well and the spontaneous pregnancy success rate, while low, may be underestimated due to non reporting bias, as most infertility clinics will not accept women over the age of forty with FSH levels in the premenopausal range or higher.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

A woman can have a normal day-three FSH level yet still respond poorly to ovarian stimulation and hence can be considered to have poor reserve.  Thus, another FSH-based test is often used to detect poor ovarian reserve: the [[clomid]] challenge test,  also known as CCCT(clomiphene citrate challenge test).

===Antral follicle count===
Transvaginal ultrasonography can be used to determine [[antral follicle count]] (AFC). This is an easy-to-perform and noninvasive method (but there may be some discomfort).  Several studies show this test to be more accurate than basal FSH testing for older women (< 44 years of age) in predicting IVF outcome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klinkert ER, Broekmans FJ, Looman CW, Habbema JD, te Velde ER |title=The antral follicle count is a better marker than basal follicle-stimulating hormone for the selection of older patients with acceptable pregnancy prospects after in vitro fertilization |journal=Fertil.

Silber, author and medical director of the Infertility Center of St. Louis.<ref>{{cite book |last=Silber |first=Sherman J. |title=How to Get Pregnant |publisher=Little Brown and Company |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=0-316-06650-8 |ref=harv}}</ref>

===Other===
* Declining serum levels of [[anti-müllerian hormone]]. Recent studies have validated the use of serum AMH levels as a marker for the quantitative aspect of ovarian reserve. Because of the lack of cycle variations in serum levels of AMH, this marker has been proposed to be used as part of the standard diagnostic procedures to assess ovarian dysfunctions, such as premature ovarian failure.  One study has shown AMH to be a better marker than basal FSH for women with proven (prior) fertility in measuring age related decline in ovarian reserve.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Rooij IA, Broekmans FJ, Scheffer GJ, ''et al.'' |title=Serum antimullerian hormone levels best reflect the reproductive decline with age in normal women with proven fertility: a longitudinal study |journal=Fertil.

* [[Activin and inhibin|Inhibin B]] blood level.  Inhibin B levels tend to decline in advanced reproductive aged women due to both fewer follicles and decreased secretion by the granulosa cells.  Inhibin B levels start to rise around day zero  and low day three levels are associated with poor IVF outcome.<ref>{{harvnb|Ghumman|2006|pp=134–5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Speroff L, Fritz MA |title=Clinical Gynecologic Endocrinology and Infertility |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia PA |year=2005 |isbn=0-7817-4795-3 |edition=7th}}</ref>

* Dynamic Assessment Following GnRH-a Administration (GAST). This test measures the change in serum estradiol levels between cycle day two and three after administration of one mg of subcutaneous leuprolide acetate, a gonadatropin releasing hormone agonist.  Patients with estradiol elevations by day two followed by a decline by day three had improved implantation and pregnancy rates than those patients with either no rise in estradiol or persistently elevated estradiol levels.<ref>{{harvnb|Ghumman|2006|pp=136–7}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Variable success rate with treatment, very few controlled studies, mostly case reports. Treatment success strongly tends to diminish with age and degree of elevation of FSH.

* Donor oocyte.  Oocyte donation is the most successful method for producing pregnancy in perimenopausal women.  In the UK the use of donor oocytes after natural menopause is controversial.<ref>"Clinical Guideline, February 2004: Fertility assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems."  National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health.</ref> A 1995 study reported that women age fifty or higher experience similar pregnancy rates after oocyte donation as younger women.  They are at equal risk for multiple gestation as younger women. In addition, antenatal complications were experienced by the majority of patients, and that high risk obstetric surveillance and care is vital.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sauer MV, Paulson RJ, Lobo RA |title=Pregnancy in women 50 or more years of age: outcomes of 22 consecutively established pregnancies from oocyte donation |journal=Fertil.

* Natural or Mini-IVF, but without the use of hCG to trigger ovulation, instead the GnRH agonist Synarel (nafarelin acetate) in a diluted form is taken as a nasal spray to trigger ovulation.  Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has a long half life and may stimulate (luteinize) small follicles prematurely and cause them to become cysts.  Whereas nafarelin acetate in a nasal spray induces a short lived LH surge that is high enough to induce ovulation in large follicles, but too short lived to adversely affect small follicles.  This increases the likelihood of the small follicles and oocytes therein developing normally for upcoming cycles and also allows the woman to cycle without taking a break and consequently increases the probability of conception in poor ovarian reserve women and advanced reproductive aged women.<ref>http://www.newhopefertility.com/ivf-forum.shtml#response7</ref>
* Pretreatment with 50 mcg [[ethinyl estradiol]] three times a day for two weeks, followed by recombinant FSH 200 IU/day subcutaneously.  Ethinyl estradiol treatment was maintained during FSH stimulation.  When at least one follicle reached 18mm in diameter and serum estradiol was greater or equal to 150 pg/ML ovulation was induced with an intramuscular injection of 10,000 IU of hCG ([[human chorionic gonadotropin]] hormone).  For luteal phase support 5,000 IU of hCG was administered every 72 hours.  Out of 25 patients 8 ovulated and 4 became pregnant.  In the control group there were no ovulations.   The patients ranged in age between 24 and 39 years with an average age of 32.7.  All women had amenorrhea for at least 6 months (average 16.75 months) and FSH levels greater or equal than 40 mIU/mL (average FSH 68 mIU/ML).  The researchers believe this protocol would work for women in early post menopause as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tartagni M, Cicinelli E, De Pergola G, De Salvia MA, Lavopa C, Loverro G |title=Effects of pretreatment with estrogens on ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins in women with premature ovarian failure: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial |journal=Fertil.

* [[Ethinyl estradiol]] or other synthetic estrogens along with [[luteal phase]] [[progesterone]] (twice daily 200&nbsp;mg vaginal suppositories) and estradiol support. Ethinyl estradiol lowers high FSH levels which then, it is theorized, up regulates FSH receptor sites and restores sensitivity to FSH.  Ethinyl estradiol also has the advantage that it does not interfere with the measurement of serum levels of endogenous estradiol.  During the luteal phase the FSH levels should be kept low for subsequent cycles, thus the phase is supplemented with 4&nbsp;mg<ref>{{cite journal |author=Check JH, Check ML, Katsoff D |title=Three pregnancies despite elevated serum FSH and advanced age: case report |journal=Hum.

* A combined pentoxifylline-tocopherol treatment has been reported effective in improving uterine parameters in women with POF undergoing IVF with donor oocytes (IVF-OD).  Three women with uterine hormonoresistance despite high estradiol (E2) plasma levels received treatment with 800&nbsp;mg pentoxifylline and 1000 IU of vitamin E for at least nine months. Three frozen-thawed embryo transfers (ETs) resulted in two viable pregnancies. Mean endometrial thickness increased from 4.9&nbsp;mm (with thin uterine crosses) to 7.4&nbsp;mm with nice uterine crosses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Letur-Konirsch H, Delanian S |title=Successful pregnancies after combined pentoxifylline-tocopherol treatment in women with premature ovarian failure who are resistant to hormone replacement therapy |journal=Fertil.

* [[Traditional Chinese medicine|TCM]]: There are reports in the medical literature of successful treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shen W, Yu CQ |title=[Treating premature ovarian failure by reinforcing kidney] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=653–6 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17090388 |url=http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/showAbstrPage.aspx?articleid=630}}</ref>  For example, a case history was published in 2003 by the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan.  Ovulation and pregnancy occurred after the administration of TCM medicine using concentrated extracts for a total of four nonconsecutive months in a 26 year old women with premature ovarian failure and secondary amenorrhea of eight years duration.  Her FSH, LH and E2 levels were 80.4 mIU/mL, 19.6 mIU/mL and 25.8 pg/mL respectively.  A modified version of zuoguiwan (左歸丸 restore the left pill) was prescribed for three months.  After three months of treatment menstrual bleeding and a biphasic body temperature were noted.  The patient then discontinued TCM therapy and at a new clinic commenced clomiphene citrate therapy.  FSH and LH were still in the menopausal range (43 mIU/mL and 11 mIU/ml, respectively) after eights months of clomiphene citrate.  Ovulation did not occur.  She then returned to the first clinic and the same TCM treatment was resumed (one year after first commencing TCM treatment) and the patient conceived one month later and subsequently gave birth by Cesarean section to a healthy 3450&nbsp;gram baby girl.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chao SL, Huang LW, Yen HR |title=Pregnancy in premature ovarian failure after therapy using Chinese herbal medicine |journal=Chang Gung Med J |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=449–52 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12956293 |url=http://www.cgmh.org.tw/cgmj/2606/260609.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

==Unproven treatments with possible merit==
* [[Melatonin]]: One double blind study showed that extended treatment with melatonin lowered FSH levels (only in woman with low initial nocturnal melatonin levels) and in some cases restored normal menstruation in early menopausal women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bellipanni G, DI Marzo F, Blasi F, Di Marzo A |title=Effects of melatonin in perimenopausal and menopausal women: our personal experience |journal=Ann.

One Japanese study (IVF-ET) showed improved fertilization rate (50.0% versus 22.8%, p &lt; 0.01) and pregnancy rate (11/56 versus 6/59, result not statistically significant) in poor responders with treatment of 3&nbsp;mg melatonin daily from 5th day of previous menstrual cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tamura H, Takasaki A, Miwa I, ''et al.'' |title=Oxidative stress impairs oocyte quality and melatonin protects oocytes from free radical damage and improves fertilization rate |journal=J. Pineal Res. |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=280–7 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18339123 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-079X.2007.00524.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0742-3098&date=2008&volume=44&issue=3&spage=280}}</ref>
* [[Maca]]: One double blind, placebo-controlled study of eight menopausal women between the ages of 45 and 62 showed a statistically significant decline in serum FSH levels after eight months of treatment with oral administration of capsules containing 2000&nbsp;mg pre-gelatinized dried and pulverized hypocotyls of Maca (''Lepidium peruvianum'' Chacon). (See table below.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meissner HO,  Kapczynski W, Mscisz A, Lutomski J |title=Use of Gelatinized Maca (''Lepidium peruvianum'') in Early Postmenopausal Women – a Pilot Study |journal=IJBS |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=33–45 |year=2005 }}</ref>)  However, in perimenopausal women Maca elevated E2 and FSH.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meissnera HO, Reich-Bilinskab H, Msciszc A, Kedziac B |title=Therapeutic Effects of Pre-Gelatinized Maca (''Lepidium peruvianum Chacon'') used as a non-hormonal alternative to HRT in perimenopausal women – Clinical Pilot Study |journal=IJBS |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=143–159 |year=2006 }}</ref> Though such supplementation may have led to statistically significant changes in FSH, this may be less likely to have clinically meaningful impact. The reason is that many IVF studies show no live births with FSH &gt; 17-20 and case reports of live births (i.e. not just pregnancy with a miscarriage) with an FSH >25 are exceptionally rare.

* Homeopathy plus herbs, vitamins and lifestyle changes may possibly help.  An article by Liz Lalor titled "Fertility Success using homeopathy" outlines a protocol that she states has been successful in forty out of fifty cases of infertility.  Of note is that two of the ten that failed later conceived in one IVF cycle and she writes: "it was reported back to me that the doctors were very surprised at the quality and numbers of eggs as well as the health of the endometrium."<ref>http://www.similima.com/fertility-success-using-homeopathy</ref>

* While the primary cause of the end to menstrual cycles is the exhaustion of ovarian follicles, there is some evidence that a defect in the [[hypothalamus]] is critical in the transition from regular to irregular cycles.  This  is supported by at least one study in which transplantation of ovaries from old rats to young ovariectomized rats resulted in follicular development and ovulation. Also, electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus is capable of restoring reproductive function in aged animals. Due to the complex interrelationship among the [[hypothalamus]], [[pituitary]] and [[ovaries]] ([[HPO axis]]) defects in the functioning of one level can cause defects on the other levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brann DW, Mahesh VB |title=The aging reproductive neuroendocrine axis |journal=Steroids |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=273–83 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=16080236 }}</ref>

==Related conditions==
* [[Premature ovarian failure]]: Defined as no menses for six months before the age of forty due to any cause. Often diagnosed by elevated gonadotropin ([[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]) levels.  In some cases (more so in younger women) ovarian function and ovulation can spontaneously resume.  With POF up to 50% of women may ovulate once in any given year and 5–10% may become pregnant.  POF is often associated with autoimmune diseases.
* [[Premature menopause]]: A outdated synonym for [[premature ovarian failure]].  The term encompasses premature menopause due to any cause, including surgical removal of the ovaries for any reason.  Early menopause and premature ovarian failure are no longer considered to be the same condition.
