The '''False Memory Syndrome Foundation''' ('''FMSF''') is a nonprofit organization founded in 1992<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fmsfonline.org/about.html | title = About the False Memory Syndrome Foundation | publisher = False Memory Syndrome Foundation | accessdate = 2009-09-16 }}</ref> by [[Peter Freyd|Pamela and Peter Freyd]], after being accused by their adult daughter [[Jennifer Freyd]] of [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse when she was a child]].<ref name="Dallam">{{cite journal | title = Crisis or Creation: A Systematic Examination of 'False Memory Syndrome' | last = Dallam | first = SJ | url = http://www.leadershipcouncil.org/1/res/dallam/6.html | journal = Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | publisher = [[Haworth Press]] |volume= 9 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 9–36 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1300/J070v09n03_02 | pmid = 17521989 }}</ref> The FMSF describes its purpose as the examination of the concept of [[false memory syndrome]] and [[recovered memory therapy]] and advocacy on behalf of individuals believed to be [[False allegation of child sexual abuse|falsely accused of child sexual abuse]]<ref name="olio">{{cite book |editor =Cosgrove L; Caplan PJ | last = Olio | first = KA | title = Bias in psychiatric diagnosis | publisher = Jason Aronson | location = Northvale, N.J | year = 2004 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=6XPLguPHzHoC&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q=&f=false 163–168] |isbn=0-7657-0001-8 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = | chapter = The Truth About 'False Memory Syndrome' }}</ref> with a focus on preventing future incidents, helping individuals and reconciling families affected by FMS, publicizing information about FMS, sponsoring research on it and attempting to discover methods to distinguish a true or false allegation of abuse.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kinnear | first = KL | year = 2007 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=V1rogCrcOMwC&pg=PA256 256–7] | publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]] | isbn = 1-85109-905-0 | title = Childhood sexual abuse: a reference handbook }}</ref> The FMSF was conceived during meetings at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins Medical Center]] by several families accused of abusing their adult children when younger. This initial group was composed of academics and professionals and the organization sought out researchers in the fields of memory and clinical practice to form its advisory board. The goal of the FMSF expanded to become more than an advocacy organization, instead attempting to address the issues of [[memory]] that seemed to have caused the behavioral changes in their now-adult children.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fmsfonline.org/advboard.html | title = The FMSF Scientific and Professional Advisory Board&nbsp;– Profiles | publisher = False Memory Syndrome Foundation | accessdate = 2009-09-16 }}</ref>

The FMSF originated the terms 'false memory syndrome' and 'recovered memory therapy' to describe what they believe is the orientation of patients towards [[confabulation]]s created by inappropriate [[psychotherapy]], and the methods through which these confabulations are created respectively.<ref>{{cite book | last = McHugh | first = PR | authorlink = Paul R.

== Background ==
In 1990 Jennifer Freyd, with the support of her grandmother and uncle, privately accused her father of sexually abusing her throughout her teenage years after allegedly recovering memories surfaced treatment by a therapist. In 1991, Pamela Freyd published an anonymous first-person account of the accusation in a journal that focused on false accusations of child sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Doe | first = J | year = 1991 | url = http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume3/j3_3_3.htm | title = How could this happen? Coping with a false accusation of incest and rape | journal = Issues in Child Abuse Accusations | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 154–165 | authorlink = John Doe}}</ref> The article was reproduced and circulated widely, including to Jennifer Freyd's department at the [[University of Oregon]]. Jennifer Freyd later stated that there were numerous inaccuracies in the article. The FMSF was formed one year later by Pamela and [[Peter Freyd]], with the support and encouragement of therapists Hollida Wakefield and Ralph Underwager. Initially the early membership and advisory board of the FMSF consisted of parents who had been accused of sexually abusing their now-adult children when they were younger, but it rapidly expanded to include professionals with expertise in the area of memory.<ref name="Dallam" />

The founders of the FMS Foundation were concerned that alleged recovered memories were reported after the use of controversial therapy techniques hat including [[hypnosis]], relaxation exercises, [[guided imagery]], drug-mediated interviews, [[Body memory|body memories]], literal [[dream interpretation]] and journaling. It is the position of the FMSF that there is no scientific evidence that the use of consciousness-altering techniques such as these can reveal or accurately elaborate factual information about previously forgotten past experiences, including sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fmsfonline.org/fmsffaq.html#Practices | title = Frequently Asked Questions&nbsp;– What therapy practices cause concern? | accessdate = 2009-09-16 | publisher = False Memory Syndrome Foundation}}</ref> 

According to the FMS Foundation, "The controversy is not about whether children are abused. Child abuse is a serious social problem that requires our attention. Neither is the controversy about whether people may not remember past abuse. There are many reasons why people may not remember something: childhood amnesia, physical trauma, drugs or the natural decay of stored information. The controversy is about the accuracy of claims of recovered "repressed" memories of abuse. The consequences profoundly affect the law, the way therapy is practiced, families and people's lives."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://FMSFonline.org | title = Welcome To Memory and Reality: Website of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation FMS Foundation website | accessdate = 2009-09-16 | publisher = False Memory Syndrome Foundation}}</ref>

Members of the FMS Foundation Scientific Advisory Board now include a number of members of the National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine: [[Aaron T. Beck]], Rochel Gelman, Leila Gleitman, [[Ernest Hilgard]] (deceased), Philip S. Holzman, [[Elizabeth Loftus]], [[Paul R. McHugh]] and [[Ulric Neisser]]. The Scientific Advisory Board includes both clinicians and researchers. The FMS Foundation is funded by contributions and has no ties to any commercial ventures.

Astrophysicist and astrobiologist [[Carl Sagan]]  cited material from a 1995 issue of the ''FMS Newsletter''  in his critique of the recovered memory claims of UFO abductees and those purporting to be victims of [[Satanic ritual abuse]]  in his last book, ''The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark'', signalling his approval of the Foundation's work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|title=The Demon-Haunted world: Science as a Candle in the Dark|year=1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-345-40946-9|pages=166}}</ref> 

The FMSF claimed 2000 members in 1993.<ref name="Calof">{{cite journal | last = Calof | first = DL | year = 1993 | title = A Conversation With Pamela Freyd, Ph.D. Co-Founder And Executive Director, False Memory Syndrome Foundation, Inc | url = http://fmsf.com/v3n3-pfreyd.shtml | journal = Treating Abuse Today | volume = 3 | issue = 3 }}</ref>

== Controversies ==

=== Social criticisms ===
The FMSF has been described as reversing the gains made by feminists and victims in gaining acknowledgment of the incestuous sexual abuse of children.<ref name="Walker">{{cite book | last = Walker | first = JA | title = Trauma cinema: documenting incest and the Holocaust | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2005 | pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=aJqcdb6-y4AC&pg=PA64 64–5] |isbn=0-520-24175-4 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> The FMSF has also been criticized for describing itself as a scientific organization while undertaking partisan political and social activity.<ref name="Dallam" />

=== Resignation of Ralph Underwager ===

In 1991, an interview with founding member of the FMSF [[Ralph Underwager]] was published in ''[[Paidika: The Journal of Paedophilia]]'' containing statements which were interpreted as supportive of paedophilia and the idea that it was actually a positive experience for some children.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wakefield | first = H | coauthors = [[Ralph Underwager|Underwager R]] | title = Interview with Hollida Wakefield and Ralph Underwager | journal = [[Paidika: the Journal of Paedophilia|Paidika]] | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | year = 1993 }}</ref> In the controversy that followed, Underwager resigned from the FMSF's scientific advisory board. Underwager later stated that the quotations in the ''Paidika'' article were taken out of context, used to discredit his ability to testify in courts and through [[Association fallacy|guilt by association]], damage the reputation of the FMSF.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Underwager | first = R | authorlink = Ralph Underwager | coauthors = Wakefield H | url = http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume6/j6_2_5.htm | year = 1994 | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | title = Misinterpretation of a Primary Prevention Effort | pages = 96–107 | journal = Issues in Child Abuse Accusations }}</ref>
