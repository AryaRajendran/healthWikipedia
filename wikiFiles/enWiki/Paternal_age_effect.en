The '''paternal age effect''' can refer to the statistical relationships of: (1) a man's age to [[sperm]] and [[semen]] abnormalities; (2) a man's age to his [[fertility]]; (3) a man's age to adverse pregnancy outcomes in his female partner (including [[miscarriage]] and [[Perinatal mortality|fetal death]]); (4) a father's age at the birth of his offspring on the probability of an adverse birth outcome (such as low [[Birth mass|birthweight]]); or (5) a father's age at the birth of his offspring on the probability that the offspring will have a health-related condition (e.g., decreased [[intelligence]]), a specific disease/disorder (e.g., [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[Down syndrome]], and [[schizophrenia]]), or risk of mortality, or social and other psychological end-points.

The genetic quality of sperm, as well as its volume and motility, all typically decrease with age.<ref name="About.com article by R. Gurevich">{{Cite web|url=http://infertility.about.com/od/causesofinfertility/f/maleagefertile.htm|title=Does Age Affect Male Fertility?|last=Gurevich|first=Rachel|date=06-10-2008|work=About.com:Fertility|publisher=About.com|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> Scientists have formulated at least two hypotheses to explain how paternal age might cause health effects.

The population geneticist [[James F. Crow]] said that the fact that DNA in sperm degrades as men age and can then be passed along to children in permanently degraded and irreparable form, which they likely pass on as well, means that the "greatest mutational health hazard to the human genome is fertile older males".  He described mutations that have a direct visible effect on the child's health and also mutations that can be latent or have minor visible effects on the child's health; many such mutations allow the child to reproduce, but cause more serious problems for grandchildren, greatgrandchildren and later generations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crow|first=James F.|title=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.|date=1997 August 5|volume=94|issue=16|pages=8380–8386|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33757/|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>

==Mortality of offspring==
A 2008 paper from Denmark found a higher overall mortality rate for children (i.e., mortality rate up to age 18) of older fathers versus younger fathers.<ref name="Zhu-2008">{{Cite journal | author = Zhu JL, Vestergaard M, Madsen KM, Olsen J | title = Paternal age and mortality in children | journal = Eur J Epidemiol | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 443–7 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/0r7507752277k8r4/ | doi = 10.1007/s10654-008-9253-3 | pmid = 18437509 }}</ref> The relative mortality rates were especially high for certain conditions; for example, for congenital malformations and injury/poisoning, the adjusted mortality rate ratios were 2.35 and 3.43 respectively for children of fathers aged 45 years or more compared with children of fathers aged 25–29 years.<ref name="Zhu-2008"/>

==Paternal mortality before adulthood of child ==
The risk of the father dying before the child becomes an adult increases by increased paternal age, such as can be demonstrated by the following data from France in 2007:<ref name=Schmidt2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr040}}</ref>
{|class="wikitable"
! Paternal age at childbirth
| 25 || 30 || 35 || 40 || 45
|-
! Risk of father not surviving until child's 18th birthday (in [[percent|%]])<ref name=Schmidt2011/>
| 2.2 || 3.3 || 5.4 || 8.3 || 12.1
|}

==Social associations==
Later age at parenthood is associated with a more stable family environment, higher socio-economic position, higher income and better living conditions, as well as better parenting practices,<ref name=Schmidt2011/> but it is more or less uncertain whether these entities are ''effects'' of advanced parental age, are ''contributors'' to advanced parental age, or common effects of a certain state such as personality type.

==Pathophysiology==
At least two hypothesized chains of causality exist whereby increased paternal age may lead to health effects:
* Genetic mutations: In contrast to [[oogenesis]], which involves 22 [[mitosis|mitotic]] divisions before birth and 2 [[meiosis|meiotic]] divisions after birth, [[spermatogenesis]] involves 30 mitotic divisions before puberty, and 4 mitotic and 2 meiotic divisions after puberty.<ref name="Crow-2000"/> Advanced paternal age may therefore lead to "copy error" in replication or the accumulation of [[mutagen]]s, thereby leading to ''[[Mutation|de novo]]'' mutations in sperm DNA.<ref name="Crow-2000"/>
* [[Epigenetics|Epigenetic]] processes such as [[Genomic imprinting|parental imprinting]] could explain the association between paternal age and schizophrenia.<ref name="Perrin-2007">{{Cite journal | author = Perrin MC, Brown AS, Malaspina D | title = Aberrant Epigenetic Regulation Could Explain the Relationship of Paternal Age to Schizophrenia | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 1270–3 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbm093 | url = http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/sbm093v1 | pmid = 17712030 | pmc = 2779878 }}</ref>

==Clinical implications==
The [[American College of Medical Genetics]] notes that there is no standard definition of "advanced paternal age."<ref name="Toriello-2008">{{Cite journal | author = Toriello HV, Meck JM; Professional Practice and Guidelines Committee, American College of Medical Genetics | title = Statement on guidance for genetic counseling in advanced paternal age | journal = Genet Med | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 457–60 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1097/GIM.0b013e318176fabb | url = http://journals.lww.com/geneticsinmedicine/Abstract/2008/06000/Statement_on_guidance_for_genetic_counseling_in.10.aspx | pmid = 18496227 | pmc = 3111019 }}</ref>  Although the College recommends [[obstetric ultrasonography]] at 18–20 weeks gestation in cases of advanced paternal age "to evaluate fetal growth and development," it notes that this procedure "is unlikely to detect many of the conditions of interest."<ref name="Toriello-2008"/>  Bray ''et al.''. (2006) expressed an opinion that any adverse effects of advanced paternal age "should be weighed up against potential social advantages for children born to older fathers who are more likely to have progressed in their career and to have achieved financial security."<ref name="Bray-2006"/>
