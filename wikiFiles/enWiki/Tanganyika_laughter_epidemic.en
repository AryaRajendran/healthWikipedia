The laughter epidemic began on January 30, 1962, at a mission-run boarding school for girls in Kashasha. The laughter started with three girls and spread haphazardly throughout the school, affecting 95 of the 159 pupils, aged 12–18.<ref name="epidemic">{{cite journal |author=Provine, Robert R. |title=Laughter |journal=American Scientist |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=38–47 |date=January-February 1996 |doi= |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/laughter/1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

The school was forced to close down on March 18, 1962.<ref name=Radiolab>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/2008/feb/25/ |title=Laughter |publisher=Radiolab |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref>

After the school was closed and the students were sent home, the epidemic spread to Nshamba, a village that was home to several of the girls.<ref name=Radiolab /> In April and May, 217 people had laughing attacks in the village, most of them being school children and young adults. The Kashasha school was reopened on May 21, only to be closed again at the end of June. In June, the laughing epidemic spread to Ramashenye girls’ middle school, near [[Bukoba, Tanzania|Bukoba]], affecting 48 girls.<ref name="epidemic"/>

The school from which the epidemic sprang was sued; the children and parents transmitted it to the surrounding area. Other schools, Kashasha itself, and another village, comprising thousands of people, were all affected to some degree.<ref name=Radiolab /> Six to eighteen months after it started, the phenomenon died off. The following symptoms were reported on an equally massive scale as the reports of the laughter itself: pain, fainting, flatulence, respiratory problems, rashes, attacks of crying, and random screaming.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sebastian|first=Simone|title=Examining 1962's 'laughter epidemic'|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-07-29/features/0307290281_1_laughing-40th-anniversary-village|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 29, 2003}}</ref>  In total 14 schools were shut down and 1000 people were affected.<ref name=Barth>{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Robert E. |title=Little Green Men, Meowing Nuns and Head-Hunting Panics: A Study of Mass Psychogenic Illness and Social Delusion |year=2001 |publisher=Macfarland & Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0997-5 |pages=52}}</ref>
