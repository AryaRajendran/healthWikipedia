'''Steroid-induced osteoporosis''' (SIOP) is [[osteoporosis]] arising due to use of [[glucocorticoid]]s - analogous to [[Cushing's syndrome]] and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug [[prednisone]] is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Some professional guidelines recommend prophylactic [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] supplementation in patients who take the equivalent of more than 30&nbsp;mg hydrocortisone (7.5&nbsp;mg of prednisolone), especially when this is in excess of three months.<ref name="Bone2003">{{cite book |author=Bone and Tooth Society of Great Britain, [[National Osteoporosis Society]], Royal College of Physicians |title=Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis |year=2003 |publisher=Royal College of Physicians of London |location=London, UK |isbn=1-86016-173-1 | url=http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/contents/966c62dd-8011-4f65-a61d-dd0c7fe4fa4b.pdf}}</ref><ref>Cochrane Reviews.

* Direct inhibition of [[osteoblast]] function
* Direct enhancement of [[bone resorption]]
* Inhibition of gastrointestinal calcium absorption
* Increased urine calcium loss
* Inhibition of [[sex steroids]]
