Halo nevi are estimated to be present in approximately 1% of the general population, and are found to be more prevalent in people with [[vitiligo]], [[melanoma|malignant melanoma]],<ref name=skinsite/> or [[Turner syndrome]].<ref name=EMed>{{EMedicine|derm|174|Halo Nevis}}</ref>  All races and sexes are equally susceptible to this disease, although a familial tendency has been reported.  The average age of onset is in a persons teenage years.

==Treatment==
As halo nevi are only of cosmetic significance, no treatment is required,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carefair.com/Skincare/Disorders/Halo_Nevus_148.html|title=CareFair.com - Halo Nevis|accessdate=August 4, 2008}}</ref> and patients will be [[asymptomatic]]. Although halo nevi are harmless, it is important to monitor the lesion on regular basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dermatalk.com/blogs/skin-disorders/halo-nevus|title=DermaTalk - Halo Nevus}}</ref> Watch out for any changes in appearance of existing or new halo nevi. If there is any change in appearance or is associated with pain, itch, and infection, a doctor should be consulted immediately to exclude the possibility of melanoma.
