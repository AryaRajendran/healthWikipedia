'''[[Surgery]]''' (cheirourgia, from cheir hand + ergon work) is the branch of medicine that deals with the physical manipulation of a bodily structure to diagnose, prevent, or cure an ailment. [[Ambroise Paré]], a 16th century French surgeon, stated that to perform surgery is: "To eliminate that which is superfluous, restore that which has been dislocated, separate that which has been united, join that which has been divided and repair the defects of nature."

Since humans first learned to make and handle tools, they have employed their talents to develop surgical techniques, each time more sophisticated than the last; however, until the [[industrial revolution]], surgeons were incapable of overcoming the three principal obstacles which had plagued the medical profession from its infancy — [[bleeding]], [[pain]] and [[infection]]. Advances in these fields have transformed surgery from a risky "art" into a scientific discipline capable of treating many diseases and conditions.

==Origins==
The first surgical techniques were developed to treat injuries and traumas. A combination of archaeological and anthropological studies offer insight into man's early techniques for suturing lacerations, amputating insalvageable limbs, and draining and cauterizing open wounds. Many examples exist: some Asian tribes used a mix of saltpeter and sulfur that was placed onto wounds and lit on fire to cauterize wounds; the Dakota Indians used the quill of a feather attached to an animal bladder to suck out purulent material; the discovery of needles from the stone age seem to suggest they were used in the suturing of cuts (the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] used needles of [[acacia]] for the same purpose); and tribes in India and South America developed an ingenious method of sealing minor injuries by applying termites or scarabs who ate around the edges of the wound and then twisted the insects neck leaving their heads rigidly attached like staples.<ref>W. J. Bishop, The early history of Surgery. Hale, London, 1960</ref>

===Trepanation===
The oldest operation for which evidence exists is [[trepanation]]<ref>(Capasso 2001)</ref> (also known as trepanning, trephination, trephining or burr hole from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''τρύπανον'' and ''τρυπανισμός''), in which a hole is [[drill]]ed or scraped into the [[human skull|skull]] for exposing the [[dura mater]] to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. In the case of head wounds, surgical intervention was implemented for investigating and diagnosing the nature of the wound and the extent of the impact while bone splinters were removed preferably by scraping followed by post operation procedures and treatments for avoiding infection and aiding in the healing process.<ref>A. Agelarakis, “Early Evidence of Cranial Surgical Intervention in Abdera, Greece, A Nexus to ''On Head Wounds of the Hippocratic Corpus''”. Mediterranean Archaeology & Archaeometry, Vol.6, No.1, 5-18, 2006</ref><ref>A. Agelarakis, “Artful Surgery: Greek Archaeologists Discover Evidence of a Skilled Surgeon Who Practiced Centuries Before Hippocrates”, Archaeology, Vol. 59/2: 26-29, 2006</ref> Evidence has been found in prehistoric human remains from Proto-Neolithic<ref>Ralph Solecki, Rose Solecki and Anagnostis Agelarakis, “The Proto-Neolithic Cemetery in Shanidar Cave”,Texas: A&M University Press, College Station, 2004</ref> and [[Neolithic]] times, in [[cave painting]]s, and the procedure continued in use well into recorded history (being described by [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writers such as [[Hippocrates]] among others). Out of 120 prehistoric skulls found at one burial site in [[France]] dated to 6500 BCE, 40 had trepanation holes.<ref>Restak (2000)</ref> Folke Henschen, a Swedish doctor and historian, asserts that Soviet excavations of the banks of the [[Dnieper River]] in the 1970s show the existence of trepanation in [[Mesolithic]] times dated to approximately 12000 BCE.<ref>The human skull. A cultural history. Folke Henschen, Frederick A. Praeger, New York, 1995</ref> The remains suggest a belief that trepanning could cure [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[migraines]], and [[mental disorder]]s.<ref>Brothwell, D.R. Digging up Bones. 1963:126</ref>

Many prehistoric and premodern patients had signs of their skull structure healing, suggesting that many of those that proceeded with the surgery survived their operation. In some studies, the rate of survival surpassed 50%.<ref>La tribu Yanto en el Perú. Manuel Antonio Muñiz y W. J. Mc. Gree. In this study, 250 of 400 skulls showed evidence of surviving trepanation.</ref>

===Setting bones===
Examples of healed fractures in prehistoric human bones, suggesting setting and splinting have be found in the archeological record.<ref name="Bradley1994">{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Edward L.|title=A patient's guide to surgery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YJAbAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 December 2012|year=1994|publisher=Consumer Reports Books|isbn=9780890437520}}</ref>
Among some treatments used by the [[Aztecs]], according to Spanish texts during the conquest of Mexico, was the reduction of fractured bones: "...the broken bone had to be splinted, extended and adjusted, and if this was not sufficient an incision was made at the end of the bone, and a branch of [[fir]] was inserted into the cavity of the [[bone marrow|medulla]]..."<ref>Lucena SM. America 1492 Retrato de un Continente hace quinientos años. Anaya Editores Milano 1990</ref> Modern medicine developed a technique similar to this in the 20th century known as medullary fixation.

===Anesthesia===

===Bloodletting===
[[File:Blutegel.png|thumb|''Hirudo medicinalis''. Leeches for bloodletting]]

Bloodletting is one of the oldest medical practices, having been practiced among diverse ancient peoples, including the [[Mesopotamia]]ns, the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], the Greeks, the [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]]s, and the Aztecs. In Greece, bloodletting was in use around the time of Hippocrates, who mentions bloodletting but in general relied on dietary techniques. [[Erasistratus]], however, theorized that many diseases were caused by plethoras, or overabundances, in the blood, and advised that these plethoras be treated, initially, by exercise, sweating, reduced food intake, and vomiting. [[Herophilus]] advocated bloodletting. [[Archagathus]], one of the first Greek physicians to practice in Rome, practiced bloodletting extensively and gained a most sanguinary reputation. The art of bloodletting became very popular in the [[Western World|West]], and during the [[Renaissance]] one could find bloodletting calendars that recommended appropriate times to bloodlet during the year and books that claimed bloodletting would cure [[inflammation]], [[infections]], [[stroke]]s, [[manic psychosis]] and more.<ref>http://ciruelo.uninorte.edu.co/pdf/salud_uninorte/16/1.la_sangria.pdf</ref>

==Antiquity==

===Mesopotamia===
[[File:Codex Hammurapi Stela top.jpg|thumb|''[[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's Code]] itself contains specific legislation regulating surgeons and medical compensation as well as malpractice and victim's compensation.'']]

[[Berossus]], a 3rd century BCE [[Assyria]]n philosopher wrote considerably about the traditional Babylonian medical techniques (principally in the archives of Borsippa) and went on to assert that the god [[Oannes]] taught the Sumerian people all that was to be known about civilization and that nothing new had been invented. This assertion seemed hyperbolic until analysis of Sumerian tablets showed that the Mesopotamian civilization had developed or invented numerous medical techniques thousands of years before they were re-developed or re-invented by the Europeans.{{Citation needed|reason=Please give references to techniques known by the Sadie Bradehoft not known again for thousands of years.|date=April 2009}}

Some 4000 BCE the Sumerian civilization was established in Mesopotamia between the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers, creating the oldest form of writing, cuneiform. Of the 30,000 or so cuneiform tablets that have been discovered, about 800 of them deal with medical themes (one of these being the first prescription known to have been written). The name of the first surgeon is [[Urlugaledin]], from the 4000 BCE, whose personal seal depicts two knives encircled by medicinal plants. This seal is now housed in the [[Louvre]].

The Sumerians saw sickness as a divine punishment imposed by different demons when an individual broke a rule. For this reason, to be a physician, one had to learn to identify approximately 6,000 possible demons that might cause health problems. To do this, the Sumerians employed divining techniques based on the flight of birds, position of the stars and the livers of certain animals. In this way, medicine was intimately linked to priests, relegating surgery to a second-class medical specialty.<ref>La historia empieza en Sumer. Samuel Noah Kramer, Círculo de lectores, 1975</ref>

Nevertheless, the Sumerians developed several important medical techniques: in [[Ninevah]] archaeologists have discovered bronze instruments with sharpened obsidian resembling modern day scalpels, knives, trephines, etc. [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's Code]] itself contains specific legislation regulating surgeons and medical compensation as well as malpractice and victim's compensation:<ref>[[wikisource:en:Codex Hammurabi|''Codex Hammurabi'']]</ref>

{{quotation|215. If a physician make a large incision with an operating knife and cure it, or if he open a tumor (over the eye) with an operating knife, and saves the eye, he shall receive ten [[shekel]]s in money.

217. If he be the slave of some one, his owner shall give the physician two shekels.

218. If a physician make a large incision with the operating knife, and kill him, or open a tumor with the operating knife, and cut<br> out the eye, his hands shall be cut off.

220. If he had opened a tumor with the operating knife, and put out his eye, he shall pay half his value.

===India===
[[Image:Shushrut statue.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Sushruta]] Statue in [[Patanjali Yogpeeth]], [[Haridwar]]]]
Archaeologists made the discovery that the people of [[Indus Valley Civilization]], even from the early Harappan periods (c. [[3300 BCE]]), had knowledge of medicine and dentistry. The physical anthropologist that carried out the examinations, Professor Andrea Cucina from the University of Missouri-Columbia, made the discovery when he was cleaning the teeth from one of the men. Later research in the same area found evidence of teeth having been drilled, dating back 9,000 years to 7000 BCE.<ref>BBC News Stone age man used dentist drill [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4882968.stm]</ref>

Much of what is known about Sushruta is in [[Sanskrit]] contained in a series of volumes he authored, which are collectively known as the ''[[Susrutha Samhita]]''. It is the oldest known surgical text and it describes in detail the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments, as well as procedures on performing various forms of cosmetic surgery, [[plastic surgery]] and [[rhinoplasty]].<ref>[http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2002;volume=48;issue=1;spage=76;epage=8;aulast=Rana History of plastic surgery in India.

The [[Sushruta Samhita]] contains the first known description of several operations, including the uniting of bowel, the removal of the prostate gland, the removal of cataract lenses and the draining of abscesses. Susrutha was also the first surgeon to advocate the practice of operations on inanimate objects such as watermelons, clay plots and reeds.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Egypt===
{{See also|Egyptian medical papyri}}
[[File:KomOmbo03.jpg|thumb|Pictures of surgery tools at [[Kom Ombo]], Egypt]]

Around 3100 BCE Egyptian civilization began to flourish when [[Narmer]], the first Pharaoh of Egypt, established the capital of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Just as cuneiform tablets preserved the knowledge of the ancient Sumerians, [[hieroglyphics]] preserved the Egyptian's.

In the first monarchic age (2700 BCE) the first treaty on surgery was written by Imhotep, the vizier of Pharaoh [[Djoser]], priest, astronomer, physician and first notable architect. So much was he famed for his medical skill that he was deified, becoming the Egyptian god of medicine.<ref>Laín Entralgo P: Historia de la Medicina. Salvat. Barcelona, 1982.</ref> Other famous physicians from the Ancient Empire (from 2500 to 2100 BCE) were [[Sachmet]], the physician of Pharaoh [[Sahure]] and [[Nesmenau]], whose office resembled that of a medical director.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

On one of the doorjambs of the entrance to the Temple of Memphis there is the oldest recorded engraving of a medical procedure: [[circumcision]] and engravings in [[Kom Ombo]], Egypt depict surgical tools. Still of all the discoveries made in ancient Egypt, the most important discovery relating to ancient Egyptian knowledge of medicine is the [[Ebers Papyrus]], named after its discoverer [[Georg Ebers]].
The Ebers Papyrus, conserved at the [[University of Leipzig]], is considered one of the oldest treaties on medicine and the most important [[medical papyri]]. The text is dated to about 1550 BCE and measures 20 meters in length. The text includes recipes, a pharmacopoeia and descriptions of numerous diseases as well as cosmetic treatments. It mentions how to surgically treat crocodile bites and serious burns, recommending the drainage of pus-filled inflammation but warns against certain diseased skin.

====Edwin Smith Papyrus====
The Edwin Smith Papyrus is a lesser known papyrus dating from the 1600 BCE and only 5 meters in length. It is a manual for performing traumatic surgery and gives 48 case histories.<ref name="Bradley1994"/><ref name="ZimmermanVeith1993">{{cite book|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Leo M.|last2=Veith|first2=Ilza|title=Great Ideas in the History of Surgery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ABbCI7z4UwMC&pg=PA179|accessdate=3 December 2012|date=1993-08-01|publisher=Norman Publishing|isbn=9780930405533|pages=179–}}</ref> For example, it gives instructions for dealing with dislocated vertabra:{{quotation|Thou shouldst bind it with fresh meat the first day. Thou shouldst loose his bandages and apply grease to his head as far as his neck, (and) thou shouldst bind it with ymrw . Thou shouldst treat it afterwards with honey every day, (and) his relief is sitting until he recovers.}}

===Greece and the Hellenized world===
{{See also|Ancient Greek medicine}}

Surgeons are now considered to be specialized [[physician]]s, whereas in the early ancient Greek world a trained general physician had to use his hands (''χείρ'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) to carry out all medical and medicinal processes including for example the treating of wounds sustained in the battle field, or the treatment of broken bones (a process called in Greek: ''χειρουργείν'').

====Homer====
In ''[[The Iliad]]'' [[Homer]]  names two doctors, “the two sons of [[Asklepios]], the admirable physicians [[Podaleirius]] and [[Machaon (physician)|Machaon]] and one acting doctor, [[Patroclus]]. Because Machaon is wounded and Podaleirius is in combat [[Eurypylus]] asks Patroclus “to cut out this arrow from my thigh, wash off the blood with warm water and spread soothing ointment on the wound."<ref name="Silverberg1967" />

====Hippocrates====
The [[Hippocratic Oath]],<ref>Hippocrates, The Oath, Vol. I, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard, 2004, pp:298-301</ref> written in the 5th century BC provides the earliest protocol for professional conduct and ethical behavior a young physician needed to abide by in life and in treating and managing the health and privacy of his patients. The multiple volumes of the [[Hippocratic corpus]]<ref>Hippocrates, Vol. I-VIII, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard, 2004</ref> and the [[Hippocratic Oath]] elevated and separated the standards of proper Hippocratic medical conduct and its fundamental medical and surgical principles from other practitioners of folk medicine often laden with superstitious constructs, and/or of specialists of sorts some of whom would endeavor to carry out invasive body procedures with dubious consequences, such as [[lithotomy]]. Works from the Hippocartic corpus include; ''On the Articulations or On Joints'', ''On Fractures'', ''On the Instruments of Reduction'', ''The Physician's Establishment or Surgery'', ''On Injuries of the Head'', ''On Ulcers'', ''On Fistulae'', and ''On Hemorrhoids''.<ref name="ZimmermanVeith1993" />

==== Celsus and Alexandria ====
Two great [[Alexandria]]ns laid the foundations for the scientific study of anatomy and physiology, [[Herophilus of Chalcedon]] and [[Erasistratus of Ceos]].<ref name="Longrigg1993" /> Other Alexandrian surgeons gave us; ligature (hemostasis), lithotomy, hernia operations, ophthalmic surgery, plastic surgery, methods of reduction of dislocations and fractures,tracheotomy, and mandrake as anesthesia. Most of what we know of them comes from [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] and [[Galen]] of Pergamum (Greek: ''Γαληνός'')<ref name="ReferenceA">Galen, On the Natural Faculties, Books I, II, and III, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard, 2000</ref><ref name="ZimmermanVeith1993" />

====Galen====
Galen, On the Natural Faculties, Books I, II, and III, is an excellent paradigm of a very accomplished Greek surgeon and physician of the Roman period (2nd century), who carried out very complex surgical operations and added significantly to the corpus of animal and human physiology and the art of surgery.<ref name="ZimmermanVeith1993" /><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===China===
[[Hua Tuo]] was a famous Chinese physician during the Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms era. He was the first person to perform surgery with the aid of [[anesthesia]], some 1600 years before the practice was adopted by Europeans.<ref>Sherer, Adina; Epstein, Fred; and Constantini, Shlomi; "Hua Tuo, patron of surgeons, or how the surgeon lost his head!" Surgical Neurology, 61 5 497-498 (2004).</ref>
[[Bian Que]] (Pien Ch'iao) was a "miracle doctor" described by the Chinese historian Qima Nan in [[Shi Ji]] who was credited with many skills. Another book, [[Liezi]] (Lieh Tzu) describes that Bian Que conducted a two way exchange of hearts between people.<ref>Kahan BD. Pien Ch'iao, the legendary exchange of hearts, traditional Chinese medicine, and the modern era of cyclosporine. Transplant Proc. 1988 Apr;20(2 Suppl 2):2-12.</ref> This account also credited Bian Que with using general anaesthesia which would place it far before Hua Tuo, but the source in Liezi is questioned and the author may have been compiling stories from other works.<ref>Graham, A.C. "The Date and Composition of Liehtzyy," Asia Major 8, pp. 139-198. 1961.</ref> Nonetheless, it establishes the concept of heart transplantation back to around 300 CE.

===Abulcasis===
[[Abulcasis]] (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi) was an [[Sadie Bradehoft|Andalusian-Arab]] physician and scientist who practised in the [[Zahra (Spain)|Zahra]] suburb of [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]. He is considered a great medieval surgeon, whose comprehensive medical texts, combining [[Islamic medicine]] with [[Greco-Roman]], shaped European surgical procedures until the Renaissance. He is often regarded as the [[father of surgery]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=A|first=Martín-Araguz|coauthors=Bustamante-Martínez, C, Fernández-Armayor Ajo, V, Moreno-Martínez, JM|title=Neuroscience in Al Andalus and its influence on medieval scholastic medicine|journal=Revista de Neurología|year=2002|volume=34|issue=9|pages=877–92|pmid=12134355}}</ref> Patients and students from all parts of Europe came to him for treatment and advice. According to [[Will Durant]], Cordoba was in this period the favorite resort of Europeans for surgical operations.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===School of Salerno===
Based on oral tradition from [[Calabri]], the translation by [[Constantine the African]] of [[Haly Abbas]], and the ''Bamberg Surgery'', which draws on Paul of Aegina and Abulcasis as well as the notes and observations of Salerno surgens, surgery reached new heights in Salerno. [[Rogerius (physician)|Rogerius Salernitanus]] composed his ''Chirurgia'' also known as ''The Surgery of Roger'' 1170, which laid the foundation for the species of the occidental surgical manuals, influencing them up to modern times. Roger seems to have been influenced more by the 6th-century [[Aëtius of Amida|Aëtius]] and [[Alexander of Tralles]], and the 7th-century [[Paul of Aegina]], than by the Arabs.<ref name="Crombie1959">{{cite book|last=Crombie|first=Alistair Cameron|title=The History of Science From Augustine to Galileo|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&pg=PA4|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=1959|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=9780486288505}}</ref>  [[Roland of Parma]] and ''Surgery of the Four Masters''  were responsible for spreading Rogers work to Italy, France, and England.<ref name="ZimmermanVeith1993" />

==13th-19th Century==
By the 13th century, many European towns were demanding that physicians have several years of study or training before they could practice. [[Montpellier]], [[Padua]] and [[Bologna]] Universities were particularly interested in the academic side to Surgery, and by the 15th century at the latest, Surgery was a separate university subject to Physic (Medicine).

==Foundations of modern surgery==
To make the transition to the modern era, the art of surgery had to solve three major problems — [[bleeding]], [[infection]], and [[pain and nociception|pain]] — that effectively prevented surgery from progressing into modern science.

===Hemostasis (Bleeding)===
[[Rufus of Ephesus]] described all the known methods of hemostasis; digital compression, styptics, cautery, torsion and the ligature.<ref name="Garrison1921">{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Fielding Hudson|title=An Introduction to the history of medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JvoIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA102|accessdate=21 November 2012|year=1921|publisher=W.B.

*Torsion/tourniquet also thought to be pre-recorded history{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
*Early cultures realized they could close wounds using a procedure called [[cauterization|cauterizing]]. The early cauterization was successful, but only usable in a limited fashion, highly destructive, and painful, with very poor long term outcomes.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
*styptics
*[[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]]s. A ligature is a piece of material used to tie closed the end of a severed [[blood vessel]] to prevent further bleeding. Ligatures form the basis of modern bleeding control, but prior to the development of [[germ theory]], they were more of a hazard than a help because the surgeons using them had no concept of infection control. Ligatures were used by [[Galen]] in his experiments on animals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lois N. Magner|title=A History of Medicine|publisher=CRC Press|year=1992|pages=91}}</ref> Galen is also known as "The king of the catgut suture"<ref name="Nutton2005">{{cite book|last=Nutton|first=Dr Vivia|title=Ancient Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PREr9_rojrQC|accessdate=21 November 2012|date=2005-07-30|publisher=Taylor & Francis US|isbn=9780415368483}}</ref> [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Abulcasis]] used the technique in the 10th century<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Surgical Paediatrics|year=2009|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=981277226X|editor=Carachi, Robert; Young Daniel Greer; Buyukunal Cenk|page=144}}</ref>  although the ligature has commonly been attributed to [[Ambroise Paré]] in the 16th century, Paré cites his sources (Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna).

Another barrier to be overcome was the problem of replacing blood lost. Limiting bleeding is important, but ultimately, a surgeon is fighting a losing battle if blood cannot be replaced, and this final barrier was only conquered when early 20th century research into [[blood group]]s allowed the first effective [[blood transfusion]]s.

The ultimate problem, however, was for the medical profession to recognize that blood loss was a major threat to the survival of the patient. In fact, doctors would typically bleed patients. [[Bloodletting]] was used to treat almost every disease and it was thought to prevent infection. Before surgery blood was removed to prevent inflammation. Before amputation it was customary to remove a quantity of blood equal to the amount believed to circulate in the limb that was to be removed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carter|first=K.

===Pain===
{{Further|History of general anesthesia|History of neuraxial anesthesia}}

Attempts at reducing pain and at producing a state of general anesthesia were made in ancient times. Opium was used by a number of ancient cultures for pain reduction, and various herbal concoctions were also used for this purpose.

In the 1500s, [[Ether]] was synthesized by [[Valerius Cordus]], and [[Paracelsus]] discovered the chemical's [[analgesic]] properties in chickens.

In the early 1800s, [[Humphry Davy]] discovered the anesthetic properties of [[nitrous oxide]], and wrote on the gas's potential benefits in relieving pain during surgery. In Japan, [[Hanaoka Seishū]] developed a plant-derived anesthesia drug. [[Friedrich Sertürner]] first isolated [[morphine]] from opium in 1804.

Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically with the discovery of effective and practical anesthetic chemicals such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]]. Pioneers in the use of ether and chloroform in surgery include British physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], Scottish obstetrician [[James Young Simpson]], and American dentists [[Horace Wells]], [[William T. G. Morton]], and [[Gardner Quincy Colton]].

In The 20th century, [[tracheotomy]], [[endoscopy]], and non-surgical [[tracheal intubation]] became essential components of the practices of anesthesia, and a number of highly effective chemical local and general anesthetics were developed.

===Sepsis===
The gradual development of [[germ theory]] has allowed the final step to be taken to create the highest quality of aseptic conditions in modern hospitals, allowing modern surgeons to perform nearly infection-free surgery.

[[William of Saliceto]] (AD ca 1210-1280) held that wounds should heal by first intention opposing the Galenic theory of "laudable pus". [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] (1478-1553), thought infection was due to the passage of minute bodies from person to another as opposed to [[miasma theory]]. The work of [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822-1895)  started the association between bacteria and infection but it was slow to be accepted. [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] (1818-1865) noted a connection between bacterial infection and puerperal fever. [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] (1827-1912) began the modern movement to control infection with his work in antiseptic surgery. [[Ernst von Bergmann]] 1836-1907; steam sterilization of instruments and [[William Stewart Halstead]] (1852-1922; rubber gloves for surgeons). [[John Charnley]] (1911-1982; the laminar flow enclosure). The development of antibacterial drugs [[Gerhard Domagk]] (1895-1964; [[sulfonamides]]) and was followed by [[Alexander Fleming]] (1881-1955), [[Howard Walter Florey]] (1898-1968) and [[Ernest Boris Chain]] (1906-1979; [[penicillin]] and [[Selman Waksman]] 1888-1973; [[actinomycin]].
