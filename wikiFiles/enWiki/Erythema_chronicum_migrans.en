'''Erythema chronicum migrans''' refers to the rash often (though not always) seen in the early stage of [[Lyme disease]].  It can appear anywhere from one day to one month after a tick bite.  This rash does not represent an allergic reaction to the bite, but rather an actual skin infection with the Lyme bacteria, [[Lyme disease microbiology|''Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato'']].  "Erythema migrans is the only manifestation of Lyme disease in the United States that is sufficiently distinctive to allow clinical diagnosis in the absence of laboratory confirmation.".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wormser GP, Dattwyler RJ, Shapiro ED, ''et al.'' |title=The clinical assessment, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis, and Babesiosis: Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America |journal=Clin.

These rashes are characteristic of ''Borrelia'' infections and no other pathogens are known that cause this form of rash.

This [[erythema]] is also sometimes called erythema migrans<ref>{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 }}</ref> or EM. However, this phrase is also used to describe [[geographic tongue]].

==History==

In a 1909 meeting of the Swedish Society of Dermatology, [[Arvid Afzelius]] first presented research about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed. Afzelius published his work 12 years later and speculated the rash came from the bite of an ''[[Ixodes]]'' [[tick]], [[meningitis|meningitic]] symptoms and signs in a number of cases and that both sexes were affected. This rash is now known as erythema chronicum migrans, the skin rash found in early-stage Lyme disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lipschütz, B. |title=Zur Kenntnis der "Erythema chronicum migrans" |journal=Acta dermato-venereologica |location=Stockholm |volume=12 |pages=100–2 |year=1931 }}</ref>

In the 1920s, French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a patient with meningoencephalitis, painful sensory radiculitis, and erythema migrans following a tick bite, and they postulated the symptoms were due to a [[spirochete|spirochetal]] infection. In the 1940s, German neurologist [[Alfred Bannwarth]] described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and [[polyneuritis|polyradiculoneuritis]], some of which were accompanied by [[erythematous]] skin lesions.

== Description ==
The erythema migrans rash is classically 5 to 6.8&nbsp;cm in diameter, appearing as an annular homogenous erythema (59%), central erythema (30%), central clearing (9%), or central [[purpura]] (2%).<ref name="pmid17113969">{{cite journal |author=Feder HM, Abeles M, Bernstein M, Whitaker-Worth D, Grant-Kels JM |title=Diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of erythema migrans and Lyme arthritis |journal=Clin.

A significant group of practitioners disputes the generally accepted [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of the rash, claiming it occurs in less than 50% of infections.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Donta ST | title=Late and chronic Lyme disease | journal=Med Clin North Am | year=2002 | pages=341–9, vii | volume=86 | issue=2 | pmid=11982305 | url=http://www.immunesupport.com/library/print.cfm?ID=3579&t=CFIDS_FM | doi=10.1016/S0025-7125(03)00090-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Cameron D, Gaito A, Narris N, Bach G, Bellovin S, Bock K, Bock S, Burrascano J, Dickey C, Horowitz R, Phillips S, Meer-Scherrer L, Raxlen B, Sherr V, Smith H, Smith P, Stricker R; ILADS Working Group | title=Evidence-based guidelines for the management of Lyme disease | journal=Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther | year=2004 | pages=S1–13 | volume=2 | issue=1 Suppl | pmid=15581390 | url=http://www.ilads.org/files/ILADS_Guidelines.pdf | format=PDF | doi=10.1586/14789072.2.1.S1}}</ref> These practitioners suggest a condition they call "chronic Lyme" (resembling [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] or [[fibromyalgia]]) exists in the absence of evidence for ''Borrelia'' infection.

===Oral erythema migrans===
'''Oral erythema migrans''' also called [[migratory stomatitis]] when extensive areas in the [[oral cavity]] [[mucosa]] are affected, or [[geographic tongue]] when confined to the dorsal and lateral aspects of the [[tongue]] mucosa, is a very common entity of unknown [[etiology]] and [[pathogenesis]] that affects 1% to 2.5% of the general population.<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |year=2011 |month=Aug |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0190-9622/PIIS0190962210004883.pdf| format=PDF}}</ref>
