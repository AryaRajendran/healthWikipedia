'''High-density lipoprotein''' ('''HDL''') is one of the five major groups of [[lipoprotein]]s, which, in order of sizes, largest to smallest, are [[chylomicron]]s, [[Very low-density lipoprotein|VLDL]], [[Intermediate-density lipoprotein|IDL]], [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]], and '''HDL''', which enable [[lipids]] like [[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]] to be transported within the water-based bloodstream. In healthy individuals, about thirty percent of blood cholesterol is carried by HDL.<ref name="am180">{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=180 |title=LDL and HDL Cholesterol: What's Bad and What's Good? |publisher=[[American Heart Association]] |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref>

[[Blood tests]] typically report HDL-C level, i.e. the amount of cholesterol contained in HDL particles. It is often contrasted with low-density or [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] cholesterol or LDL-C. HDL particles are able to remove cholesterol from within [[artery]] [[atheroma]]{{Citation needed|reason=need a citation that HDL can remove LDL from within an arterial wall|date=September 2010}} and transport it back to the liver for excretion or re-utilization, which is the main reason why the cholesterol carried within HDL particles (HDL-C) is sometimes called "good cholesterol" (despite the fact that it is exactly the same as the cholesterol in LDL particles). Those with higher levels of HDL-C seem to have fewer problems with [[cardiovascular diseases]], while those with low HDL-C cholesterol levels (less than 40&nbsp;mg/dL or about 1&nbsp;mmol/L) have increased rates for heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Toth|first=Peter|title=The "Good Cholesterol"  High-Density Lipoprotein|journal=Circulation|year=2005|volume=111|pages=e89-e91|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/111/5/e89|accessdate=2 June 2011|issue=5}}</ref> Higher HDL levels are correlated with better cardiovascular health.

Recent research suggests that high levels of HDL particles that contain apoC-III on its surface could increase the risk of future chronic heart disease{{cite web |url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/hdl-cholesterol-heart-disease/ |title= (Some HDL, or "Good" Cholesterol, May Not Protect Against Heart Disease)}}

==Structure and function==
HDL is the smallest of the [[lipoprotein]] particles. They are the densest because they contain the highest proportion of [[protein]] to [[cholesterol]]. Their most abundant [[apolipoprotein]]s are [[Apolipoprotein A1|apo A-I]] and [[Apolipoprotein A2|apo A-II]].<ref>{{Cite web|first=Jean-Pierre |last=Després |title=The Atherogenic Triad of New Metabolic Risk Factors: Importance of Waist and Fasting Triglycerides as Screening Tools |url=http://www.lipidsonline.org/slides/slide01.cfm?q=apolipoprotein&dpg=59 |work=Visceral Adipose Tissue and Cardiometabolic Risk: Does It Really Matter? Part 2 |accessdate=8 October 2009}}{{Self-published inline|date=October 2009}}</ref> The liver synthesizes these lipoproteins as complexes of apolipoproteins and phospholipid, which resemble cholesterol-free flattened spherical lipoprotein particles. They are capable of picking up cholesterol, carried internally, from cells by interaction with the [[ABCA1|ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)]]. A [[Blood plasma|plasma]] enzyme called [[lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase]] (LCAT) converts the free cholesterol into cholesteryl ester (a more hydrophobic form of cholesterol), which is then sequestered into the core of the lipoprotein particle, eventually making the newly synthesized HDL spherical. They increase in size as they circulate through the bloodstream and incorporate more cholesterol and phospholipid molecules from cells and other lipoproteins, for example by the interaction with the [[ABCG1|ABCG1 transporter]] and the [[PLTP|phospholipid transport protein (PLTP)]].

HDL transports cholesterol mostly to the [[liver]] or [[Steroidogenesis|steroidogenic organs]] such as [[adrenal]]s, [[ovary]], and [[testes]] by direct and indirect pathways. HDL is removed by HDL receptors such as [[SCARB1|scavenger receptor BI]] (SR-BI), which mediate the selective uptake of cholesterol from HDL. In humans, probably the most relevant pathway is the indirect one, which is mediated by [[CETP|cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)]]. This protein exchanges triglycerides of [[VLDL]] against cholesteryl esters of HDL. As the result, VLDLs are processed to [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]], which are removed from the circulation by the [[LDL receptor]] pathway. The triglycerides are not stable in HDL, but degraded by [[hepatic lipase]] so that finally small HDL particles are left, which restart the uptake of cholesterol from cells.

The cholesterol delivered to the liver is excreted into the [[bile]] and, hence, [[intestine]] either directly or indirectly after conversion into [[bile acid]]s. Delivery of HDL cholesterol to adrenals, ovaries, and testes is important for the synthesis of [[steroid hormone]]s.

[[Image:hdl1.svg|right|400px]]
Several steps in the metabolism of HDL can contribute to the transport of cholesterol from lipid-laden [[macrophages]] of [[atherosclerotic]] [[arteries]], termed [[foam cell]]s, to the liver for secretion into the bile. This pathway has been termed ''[[reverse cholesterol transport]]'' and is considered as the classical protective function of HDL toward atherosclerosis.

However, HDL carries many lipid and protein species, several of which have very low concentrations but are biologically very active. For example, HDL and their protein and lipid constituents help to inhibit [[oxidation]], [[inflammation]], [[Endothelium|activation of the endothelium]], [[coagulation]], and [[Platelet|platelet aggregation]]. All these properties may contribute to the ability of HDL to protect from atherosclerosis, and it is not yet known what are the most important. In addition, a small subfraction of HDLs lend protection against the protozoan parasite ''Trypanosoma brucei brucei''. These HDLs, termed trypanosome lytic factor, contains specialized proteins that, while very active, are unique to the TLF molecule. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23059119</ref>

In the [[fight-or-flight response|stress response]], [[serum amyloid A]], which is one of the [[acute-phase proteins]] and an apolipoprotein, is under the stimulation of [[cytokine]]s ([[Interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]]), and [[cortisol]] produced in the [[adrenal cortex]] and carried to the damaged tissue incorporated into HDL particles. At the inflammation site, it attracts and activates leukocytes. In chronic inflammations, its deposition in the tissues manifests itself as [[amyloidosis]].

It has been postulated that the concentration of large HDL particles more accurately reflects protective action, as opposed to the concentration of total HDL particles.<ref>{{cite pmid|11374859}}</ref> This ratio of large HDL to total HDL particles varies widely and is measured only by more sophisticated lipoprotein assays using either [[electrophoresis]] (the original method developed in the 1970s) or newer [[NMR spectroscopy]] methods (See also: [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[spectroscopy]]), developed in the 1990s.

===Subfractions===

Five subfractions of HDL have been identified.  From largest (and most effective at cholesterol removal) to smallest (and least effective), the types are 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, and 3c.<ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/84/1/129 HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 subfractions, and the risk of acute myocardial infarction. A prospective population study in eastern Finnish men.]</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Men tend to have noticeably lower HDL levels, with smaller size and lower cholesterol content, than women. Men also have an increased incidence of [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] heart disease. Alcohol consumption tends to raise HDL levels,<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1732002 | pmid=11801616 | volume=56 | issue=1 | title=Types of alcoholic beverages and blood lipids in a French population | year=2002 | month=January | author=Ruidavets JB, Ducimetière P, Arveiler D, ''et al.'' | journal=J Epidemiol Community Health | pages=24–8}}</ref> and moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Recent study confirm the fact that HDL has a buffering role in balancing the effects of hypercoagulable state in type 2 diabetics and decreases high risk of cardiovascular complications in these patients. Also, the results obtained in this study revealed that there was negative significant correlation between HDL and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mard-Soltani M, Dayer MR, Shamshirgar-Zadeh A, Ali-Bahar H, Nasirbagheban Z|title=The Buffering Role of HDL in Balancing the Effects of Hypercoagulable State in Type 2 Diabetes |journal=J Applied sciences|year=2012|month=Aprill|doi=10.3923/jas.2012.745.752 |volume=12 |issue=8|pages=745–52}}</ref>

Epidemiological studies have shown that high concentrations of HDL (over 60&nbsp;mg/dL) have protective value against [[cardiovascular disease]]s such as ischemic stroke and [[myocardial infarction]]. Low concentrations of HDL (below 40&nbsp;mg/dL for men, below 50&nbsp;mg/dL for women) increase the risk for [[atherosclerotic]] diseases. 

Data from the landmark [[Framingham Heart Study]] showed that, for a given level of LDL, the risk of heart disease increases 10-fold as the HDL varies from high to low. On the converse, however, for a fixed level of HDL, the risk increases 3-fold as LDL varies from low to high.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rahilly|first=Catherine|title=Relation between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and survival to age 85 years in men (from the VA normative aging study)|journal=Am J Cardiol|year=2011|pmid=21296318|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.12.015|volume=107|issue=8|pages=1173–7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=HB|first=HB|title=Diabetes, plasma insulin, and cardiovascular disease: subgroup analysis from the Department of Veterans Affairs high-density lipoprotein intervention trial (VA-HIT)|year=2002|pmid=12456232|volume=162|issue=22|journal=Arch. Intern. Med.|pages=2597–604}}</ref>  <!--The prior sentences make more sense than this garbled explanation of it...So, for example, for a fixed LDL level of 220 mg/dl, the risk of coronary heart disease is 3-times normal if the HDL is low (25 mg/dl) but just one-third of normal if the HDL is high (85 mg/dl). On the other hand, for a fixed HDL level of 85 mg/dl, the risk of coronary heart disease is one-tenth normal if the LDL is low (100 mg/dl) and still only three-tenths of normal if the LDL is high (220 mg/dl). Phrased differently, this data implies that HDL is a more potent risk factor than LDL. Indeed, for a high HDL level (85 mg/dl), the risk of coronary disease remains lower than average even when the LDL level is high. Lowering LDL levels in such people, while of some benefit, merely converts a low risk situation to a very low risk situation.-->

Even people with very low LDL levels are exposed to increased risk if their HDL levels are not high enough.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa064278 |title=HDL Cholesterol, Very Low Levels of LDL Cholesterol, and Cardiovascular Events |year=2007 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |pages=1301–10 |first1=Philip |last1=Barter |first2=Antonio M. |last2=Gotto |first3=John C. |last3=LaRosa |first4=Jaman |last4=Maroni |first5=Michael |last5=Szarek |first6=Scott M. |last6=Grundy |first7=John J.

==Measuring HDL concentration and sizes==
As technology has reduced costs and clinical trial have continued to demonstrate the importance of HDL, methods for directly measuring HDL concentrations, and size (which indicates function) at lower costs have become increasingly available and regarded as more important for assessing individual risk for progressive [[atherosclerosis|arterial disease]] and improve treatment methods.

===Chemical measurements===
HDL, as discussed above, forms from two large proteins, predominantly [[Apolipoprotein A1|apo A-I]] and [[Apolipoprotein A2|apo A-II]], positioned, back to back. Charged amino acids on the outer surface attract water, making the particles both water-soluble (so as to carry fats within the blood) and able to associate with HDL receptors on in the surface of cells, e.g. the [[macrophage]]s of which [[atherosclerosis|plaque]] is predominantly composed, at least in the early stages. Cholesterol is carried within and between the two particles. If the particles pick up more cholesterol, then the particles enlarge and a third or fourth apo A protein joins the grouping, termed large HDL. Chemical measurements can be used to estimate HDL concentrations present in a blood sample, though such measurements may not indicate how well the HDL particles are functioning to reverse transport cholesterol from tissues. HDL-cholesterol is measured by first removing LDL particles by aggregation or precipitation with divalent ions (such as Mg++) and then coupling the products of a cholesterol oxidase reaction to an indicator reaction. The measurement of apo-A reactive capacity can be used to measure HDL cholesterol but is thought to be less accurate.

===Electrophoresis measurements===
Since the HDL particles have a net negative charge and vary by size, [[electrophoresis]] measurements have been utilized since the 1960s to both indicate the number of HDL particles and additionally sort them by size. Larger HDL particles are carrying more cholesterol.

===NMR measurements===
The newest methodology for measuring HDL particles, available clinically since the late 1990s<ref>[http://www.liposcience.com/index2.cfm?scid1=72&id=28 liposcience.com]</ref> uses [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]] fingerprinting of the particles to measure both concentration and sizes. This methodology was pioneered by researcher [[Jim Otvos]] and the North Carolina State University academic research spinoff company<ref>[http://www.liposcience.com liposcience.com]</ref> and dramatically reduced the cost of HDL measurements.

====Optimal total and large HDL concentrations====
The HDL particle concentrations are typically categorized by event rate percentiles based on the people participating and being tracked in the MESA<ref>[http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org mesa-nhlbi.org]</ref> trial, a medical research study sponsored by the United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

The lowest incidence of atherosclerotic events over time occurs within those with both the highest concentrations of total HDL particles, the top quarter (>75%), and the highest concentrations of large HDL particle concentrations. Multiple other measures, including LDL particle concentrations, small LDL particle concentrations, along with VLDL concentrations, estimations of [[Insulin resistance]] pattern and standard cholesterol lipid measurements (for comparison of the plasma data with the estimation methods discussed above) are also routinely provided.

==Memory==
Fasting serum lipids have been associated with short term verbal memory. In a large sample of middle aged adults, low HDL cholesterol was associated with poor memory and decreasing levels over a five year follow-up period were associated with decline in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=18591462 |year=2008 |last1=Singh-manoux |first1=A |last2=Gimeno |first2=D |last3=Kivimaki |first3=M |last4=Brunner |first4=E |last5=Marmot |first5=MG |title=Low HDL cholesterol is a risk factor for deficit and decline in memory in midlife: the Whitehall II study |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1556–62 |doi=10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.163998 |pmc=2581752 |journal=Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology}}</ref>

Pharmacological therapy to increase the level of HDL cholesterol includes use of [[fibrate]]s and [[niacin]]. Fibrates have not been proven to have an effect on overall deaths from all causes, despite their effects on lipids.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=17853928 |url=http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/120-1261/2706/ |year=2007 |last1=Benatar |first1=JR |last2=Stewart |first2=RA |title=Is it time to stop treating dyslipidaemia with fibrates? |volume=120 |issue=1261 |pages=U2706 |journal=The New Zealand medical journal}}</ref>

In contrast, while the use of [[statins]] is effective against high levels of LDL cholesterol, it has little or no effect in raising HDL cholesterol.<ref name="rhcrcr"/> As statins are associated with side effects like myopathy which causes sore muscles, patients who experience these side effects may need to be given a lower dose of statin to control cholesterol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cholesteroladvice.net/treatment-high-cholesterol-level/|title=When is treatment indicated for high cholesterol level?}}</ref>

The statins act by inhibiting, temporarily, the enzyme, in a dose response relationship whereas the magnesium ion (Mg2+) is an important part of a complex control and regulation of this important pathway. Both lower LDL-C, some statins can raise HDL-C and lower triglycerides, but Mg supplements do both quite reliably.}}</ref>
