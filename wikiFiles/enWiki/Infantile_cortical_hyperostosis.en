'''Infantile cortical hyperostosis''' is a self-limited [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] disorder of [[infant]]s that causes [[bone]] changes, [[soft tissue]] swelling and [[irritability]].  The disease may be present at birth or occur shortly thereafter. The cause is unknown.  Both familial and sporadic forms occur.  It is also known as '''Caffey disease''' or '''Caffey's disease'''.

==Genetics==
It has been associated with ''[[COL1A1]]''.<ref name="pmid18553566">{{cite journal |author=Kamoun-Goldrat A, Martinovic J, Saada J, ''et al.'' |title=Prenatal cortical hyperostosis with COL1A1 gene mutation |journal=Am.

==Features==
An affected infant typically has the following triad of [[Medical sign|signs]] and [[symptom]]s:  soft-tissue swelling, bone lesions, and irritability.  The swelling occurs suddenly, is deep, firm, and may be tender.  Lesions are often asymmetric and may affect several parts of the body.  Affected bones have included the [[Human mandible|mandible]], [[tibia]], [[ulna]], [[clavicle]], [[scapula]], [[rib]]s, [[humerus]], [[femur]], [[fibula]], [[Human skull|skull]], [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], and [[Metatarsus|metatarsals]]. When the mandible (lower jaw bone) is affected, infants may refuse to eat, leading to [[failure to thrive]].

==Diagnosis==

Most infants with infantile cortical hyperostosis are diagnosed by [[physical examination]]. [[X-ray]]s can confirm the presence of bone changes and soft tissue swelling.  [[Biopsy]] of the affected areas can confirm the presence of typical [[Histopathology|histopathological]] changes.  No specific blood tests exist, but tests such as [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) and [[alkaline phosphatase]] levels are often elevated.  A [[complete blood count]] may show [[anemia]] (low red blood cell count) and [[leukocytosis]] (high white blood cell count).  Other tests may be done to help exclude other diagnoses.  [[Obstetric ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] imaging can help diagnose [[prenatal]] cases.

===Differential diagnosis===
[[Osteomyelitis]] (bone infection), which is much more common than infantile cortical hyperostosis, must be excluded, since it requires urgent treatment.  Other diagnoses that can mimic this disorder and need to be excluded include [[physical trauma]], [[child abuse]], [[Retinol|Vitamin A]] excess, [[hyperphosphatemia]], [[prostaglandin]] E1 and E2 administration, [[scurvy]], infections (including [[syphilis]]), [[Ewing's sarcoma|Ewing sarcoma]], and [[Metastasis|metastatic]] [[neuroblastoma]].

==Pathophysiology==
In the early stages of infantile cortical hyperostosis, biopsy shows inflammation of the [[periosteum]] and adjacent soft tissues. After this resolves, the periosteum remains thickened, and subperiosteal immature lamellar bone can be seen on biopsy, while the [[bone marrow]] spaces contain vascular fibrous tissue. Eventually the inflammation and subperiosteal changes resolve, and hyperplasia of lamellar cortical bone can be seen.

Radiographs initially show layers of periosteal new bone formation with cortical thickening.  Periosteal new bone may cover the diaphysis of the bone, causing an increase in diameter of the bone. Over time, the periosteal new bone density increases, becoming homogenous with the underlying cortex. Eventually the bone remodels and resumes a normal appearance.

==Prognosis==
Infantile cortical hyperostosis is a self-limited condition, meaning that the disease resolves on its own without treatment, usually within 6-9 months. Long-term deformities of the involved bones, including bony fusions and limb-length inequalities, are possible but rare.

==Epidemiology==
The disease has been reported to affect 3 per 1000 infants younger than 6 months in the United States. No predilection by race or sex has been established. Almost all cases occur by the age of 5 months.  The familial form is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion with variable [[penetrance]].  The familial form tends to have an earlier onset and is present at birth in 24% of cases, with an average age at onset of 6.8 weeks. The average age at onset for the sporadic form is 9–11 weeks.

==History==
Dr. John Caffey (1895–1978) first described infantile cortical hyperostosis in 1945.  He described a group of infants with tender swelling in the soft tissues and cortical thickenings in the skeleton, with onset of these findings during the first 3 months of life. Dr. Caffey was regarded throughout the world as the father of pediatric radiology. His classic textbook, Pediatric X-Ray Diagnosis, which was first published in 1945, has become the recognized bible and authority in its field. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Caffey J |title=Infantile cortical hyperostoses |journal=J.
