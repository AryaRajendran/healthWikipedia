A '''technetium-99m generator''', or colloquially a '''technetium cow''' or '''moly cow''', is a device used to extract the metastable isotope [[Technetium-99m|<sup>99m</sup>Tc]] of [[technetium]] from a source of decaying [[molybdenum]]-99. <sup>99</sup>Mo has a [[half-life]] of 66 hours<ref>{{cite journal | title = Technetium-99m | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/technetium.html | author = R. Nave | work = HyperPhysics | publisher = [[Georgia State University]]}}</ref> and can be easily transported over long distances to hospitals where its decay product technetium-99m (with a half-life of only 6 hours, inconvenient for transport) is extracted and used for a variety of [[nuclear medicine]] [[Technetium#Applications|diagnostic procedures]], where its short half-life is very useful.

== Parent isotope source ==
<sup>99</sup>Mo can be obtained by the [[neutron]] activation (n,γ reaction) of <sup>98</sup>Mo in a high [[neutron flux]] reactor. However, the most frequently used method is through fission of [[uranium]]-235 in a [[nuclear reactor]]. While most reactors currently engaged in <sup>99</sup>Mo production use highly enriched Uranium-235 targets, proliferation concerns have prompted some producers to transition to low enriched uranium targets <ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12569|title=Medical Isotope Production Without Highly Enriched Uranium|author=The National Research Council|accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref> The target is irradiated with [[neutrons]] to form <sup>99</sup>Mo as a [[fission product]] [http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/rp/factsheets/factsheets-pdf/fs32mo99.pdf]. Molybdenum-99 is then separated from other fission products in a [[hot cell]].[http://www.rertr.anl.gov/MO99/JLS.pdf]

== Generator invention and history ==
Tc-99m remained a scientific curiosity until the 1950s when Powell Richards realized in the potential of technetium-99m as a medical radiotracer and promoted its use among the medical community. While Richards was in charge of the radioisotope production at the Hot Lab Division of the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], [[Walter Tucker]]{{dn|date=June 2012}} and Margaret Greene were working on how to improve the separation process purity of the short-lived [[elution|eluted]] [[daughter product]] [[iodine-132]] from [[tellurium-132]], its 3.2-days parent, produced in the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/BGRR.asp|work=bnl.gov|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> They detected a trace contaminant which proved to be Tc-99m, which was coming from Mo-99 and was following tellurium in the chemistry of the separation process for other fission products. Based on the similarities between the chemistry of the tellurium-iodine parent-daughter pair, Tucker and Greene developed the first technetium-99m generator in 1958 (see photo of this generator at the beginning of the article).<ref>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Powell|title=Technetium-99m: The Early Days|year=1989|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|location=New York|url= http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/5612212-IkoOXK/5612212.pdf|volume=BNL-43197 CONF-8909193-1|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1= W.D.|last2= Greene|first2= M.W.|last3= Weiss|first3=A.J.|last4= Murrenhoff |first4=A.|title=Methods of preparation of some carrier-free radioisotopes involving sorption on alumina|journal=Transactions American Nuclear Society|year=1958|volume=1|pages=160–161}}</ref> It was not until 1960 that Richards became the first to suggest the idea of using technetium as a medical tracer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Powell|title=A survey of the production at Brookhaven National Laboratory of radioisotopes for medical research|year=1960|journal=VII Rassegna Internazionale Elettronica e Nucleare Roma|pages=223–244}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/tc-99m.asp|work=Bnl.gov|title=The Technetium-99m Generator}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=P.|last2=Tucker|first2= W.D.|last3=Srivastava|first3= S.C.|title=Technetium-99m: an historical perspective|journal=The International journal of applied radiation and isotopes|year=1982 |month=October|volume=33|issue=10 |pages=793–9 |pmid=6759417|doi=10.1016/0020-708X(82)90120-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stang|first1=Louis G.|last2=Richards|first2= Powell|title=Tailoring the isotope to the need|journal=Nucleonics|year=1964|volume=22|issue=1|issn=0096-6207}}</ref>

== Generator function and mechanism ==
Technetium-99m's short half-life of 6 hours makes storage impossible and would make transport very expensive. It is instead its parent nuclide <sup>99</sup>Mo that is supplied to hospitals after its extraction from the neutron-irradiated uranium targets and its purification  in dedicated processing facilities.<ref name="Dilw">{{cite journal| first1=Jonathan R.|last1=Dilworth|last2=Parrott,|first2=Suzanne J.|title=The biomedical chemistry of technetium and rhenium|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|year= 1998|volume=27|pages=43–55|doi=10.1039/a827043z| ref=harv| postscript=.}}</ref> It is shipped by specialised radiopharmaceutical companies in the form of technetium-99m generators worldwide or directly distributed to the local market. The generators, colloquially known as a moly cows, are devices designed to provide radiation shielding for transport  and to minimize the extraction work done at the medical facility. A typical dose rate at 1 metre from Tc-99m generator is 20-50 [[μSv/h]] during transport.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Ken B.|title=Worker Exposures: How Much in the UK?|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull271/27104592527.pdf|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=IAEA Bulletin|date=Spring 1985}}</ref> These generators' output declines with time and must be replaced weekly, since the half-life of <sup>99</sup>Mo is still only 66 hours.

Since the half-life of the parent nuclide (<sup>99</sup>Mo) is much longer than that of the daughter nuclide (<sup>99m</sup>Tc), 50% of equilibrium activity is reached within one daughter half-life, 75% within two daughter half-lives. Hence, removing the daughter nuclide ([[elution]] process) from the generator ("milking" the cow) is reasonably done as often as every 6 hours in a <sup>99</sup>Mo/<sup>99m</sup>Tc generator.

Most commercial <sup>99</sup>Mo/<sup>99m</sup>Tc generators use [[column chromatography]], in which <sup>99</sup>Mo in the form of molybdate, MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). When the Mo-99 decays it forms [[pertechnetate]] TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized <sup>99</sup>Mo elutes the soluble <sup>99m</sup>Tc, resulting in a saline solution containing the <sup>99m</sup>Tc as the pertechnetate, with sodium as the counterbalancing cation.

The solution of sodium pertechnetate may then be added in an appropriate concentration to the organ-specific pharmaceutical to be used, or sodium pertechnetate can be used directly without pharmaceutical tagging for specific procedures requiring only the <sup>99m</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> as the primary radiopharmaceutical. A large percentage of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc generated by a <sup>99</sup>Mo/<sup>99m</sup>Tc generator is produced in the first 3 parent half-lives, or approximately one week. Hence, clinical nuclear medicine units purchase at least one such generator per week or order several in a staggered fashion.

== Isomeric ratio ==
When the generator is left unused, <sup>99</sup>Mo decays to <sup>99m</sup>Tc, which in turn decays to <sup>99</sup>Tc. The half-life of <sup>99</sup>Tc is far longer than its metastable isomer, so the ratio of <sup>99</sup>Tc to <sup>99m</sup>Tc increases over time. Both isomers are carried out by the elution process and react equally well with the ligand, but the <sup>99</sup>Tc is an impurity useless to imaging. 

The generator is washed of Tc-99 and Tc-99m at the end of the manufacturing process of the generator, but the ratio of <sup>99</sup>Tc to <sup>99m</sup>Tc then builds up again during transport or any other period when the generator is left unused. The first few elutions will have reduced effectiveness because of this high ratio.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=P.W.|title=Technetium-99 in generator systems.|journal=Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine|year=1984|month=April|volume=25|issue=4|pages=499–502|pmid=6100549|url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/25/4/499.full.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref>
