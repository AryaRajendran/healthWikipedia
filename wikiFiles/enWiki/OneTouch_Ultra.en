'''OneTouch Ultra''' is a [[blood sugar|blood glucose]] monitoring device for [[Diabetes mellitus|people with diabetes]] and is the foundation product for LifeScan's OneTouch Ultra Family of blood glucose monitoring systems.  

OneTouch Ultra Blood Glucose Meters provide blood glucose test results in 5 seconds, offer alternative test site options, and various memory and flagging features.  The results are displayed as plasma values.  

OneTouch Meters are sold in kits containing a carry case, a lancing device, control solution, sample quantities of lancets, and a replacement cap for use with the sampling device when using alternative site testing.  

The OneTouch Ultra 2 is similar in design and operation to the OneTouch Ultra Meter, but also offers Before and After Meal Flags, Comments, and a list style memory recall. This meter also provides 7 day, 14 day, and 30-day averages, with the option of averaging Before meal or After Meal records.

Other OneTouch Ultra Meters include the OneTouch UltraSmart and the OneTouch UltraMini Meter (known as the OneTouch UltraEasy in Europe). In addition to the original Silver Moon color, LifeScan introduced three additional colors of the OneTouch UltraMini Meter in summer 2007: Pink Glow, Limelight, and Jet Black.

OneTouch Meters with data ports can be used in combination with the downloadable OneTouch Diabetes Management Software and a PC to compute averages and trends. The software is available from LifeScan's Web site but an interface cable must be purchased.
