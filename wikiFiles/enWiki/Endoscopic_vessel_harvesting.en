'''Endoscopic vessel harvesting''' (EVH) is a surgical technique that may be used in conjunction with [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] (commonly called a "bypass"). For patients with coronary artery disease, a physician may recommend a bypass to reroute blood around blocked arteries to restore and improve [[blood flow]] and [[oxygenation (medicine)|oxygen]] to the heart. To create the [[Medical grafting|bypass graft]], a surgeon will remove or "harvest" healthy blood vessels from another part of the body, often from the patient's leg or arm. This vessel becomes a graft, with one end attaching to a blood source above and the other end below the blocked area, creating a "conduit" channel or new blood flow connection across the heart.

The success of [[CABG|coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)]] may be influenced by the quality of the conduit and how it is handled or treated during the vessel harvest and preparation steps prior to grafting.

Success can be measured in terms of:

* The need for repeat [[revascularization]] to treat a new blockage
* [[Disease|Morbidity]]
* Mortality (death)

==Method==
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery has been in practice since the 1960s. Historically, vessels—such as the [[great saphenous vein]] in the leg or the [[radial artery]] in the arm—were obtained using a traditional "open" procedure that required a single, long incision from groin to ankle, or a "bridging" technique that used three or four smaller incisions.

The most minimally invasive technique is known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH), a procedure that requires a single 2&nbsp;cm incision plus one or two smaller incisions of 2–3&nbsp;mm in length.

Each method involves carefully cutting and sealing off smaller blood vessels that branch off the main vessel conduit prior to removal from the body. This practice does not harm the remaining blood vessel network, which heals and maintains sufficient blood flow to the extremities, allowing the patient to return to normal function without noticeable effects.

==Usage==
EVH uses small incisions and specialized [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally invasive]] instruments to internally view, cut and seal side branches and remove the healthy blood vessel with minimal trauma to the vessel or surrounding tissues.  In [[clinical trial|clinical studies]], EVH has shown important benefits, including a reduced risk of infection<ref name="carpino">{{cite journal |author=Carpino PA |title=Clinical benefits of endoscopic vein harvesting in patients with risk factors for saphenectomy wound infections undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. |journal=Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery |volume=119 |page=69 |year=2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Patel AN |title=Clinical benefits of endoscopic vein harvesting in obese patients. |journal=Abstract presented at: International Society of Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery (ISMICS) 6th Annual Scientific Meeting |year=June 20–23, 2003 |location=San Francisco, CA}}</ref> and wound complications;<ref name="carpino" /><ref name="ismics">{{cite journal |author=Allen KB |title=Endoscopic Vascular Harvest in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery: A Consensus Statement of the International Society of Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery (ISMICS) 2005 |journal=Innovations: Technology & Techniques in Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgery |issue=Winter |page=51 |year=2005}}</ref><ref name="yun">{{cite journal |author=Yun KL |title=andomized trial of endoscopic versus open vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting: six-month patency rates |journal=Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. |volume=129 |page=496 |year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis Z |title=Endoscopic vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting: technique and outcomes. |journal=Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. |volume=116 |page=228 |year=1998}}</ref><ref name="allen">{{cite journal |author=Allen KB |title=Endoscopic versus traditional saphenous vein harvesting: a prospective, randomized trial. |journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery. |volume=66 |page=26 |year=1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kan CD |title=Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest decreases leg wound complications in coronary artery bypass grafting patients. |journal=Journal of Cardiac Surgery. |volume=1 |page=157 |year=1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Crouch JD |title=Open versus endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting: wound complications and vein quality. |journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery |volume=68 |page=1513 |year=1999}}</ref><ref name="patel">{{cite journal |author=Patel AN |title=Prospective analysis of endoscopic vein harvesting. |journal=American Journal of Surgery. |volume=182 |page=716 |year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Allen KB |title=Influence of endoscopic versus traditional saphenectomy on event-free survival: five-year followup of a prospective randomized trial. |journal=Heart Surgery Forum. |volume=6 |page=E143 |year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Connolly MW |title=Endoscopic radial artery harvesting: results of first 300 patients. |journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery. |volume=74 |page=502 |year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Patel AN |title=Endoscopic radial artery harvesting is better than the open technique. |journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery. |volume=78 |page=149 |year=2004}}</ref> less postoperative pain and swelling;<ref name="ismics" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Morris RJ |last2=Butler |first2=MT |last3=Samuels |first3=LE |title=Minimally invasive saphenous vein harvesting |journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery |volume=66 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pmid=9768995 |pages=1026–8}}</ref><ref name="gazoni">{{cite journal |author=Gazoni LM |title=Endoscopic versus open saphenous vein harvest for femoral to below the knee arterial bypass using saphenous vein graft |journal=J Vasc Surg |volume=44 |page=282 |year=2006}}</ref> and faster recovery<ref name="allen" /><ref name="patel" /><ref name="erdoes">{{cite journal |author=Erdoes LS |title=ncouraging results with endoscopic vein harvest for infrainguinal bypass |journal=J Vasc Surg |volume=42 |page=442 |year=2005}}</ref><ref name="suggs">{{cite journal |author=Suggs WD |title=Endoscopically assisted in situ lower extremity bypass graft: a preliminary report of a new minimally invasive technique |journal=J Vasc Surg |volume=34 |page=668 |year=2001}}</ref><ref name="illig">{{cite journal |author=Illig KA |title=Financial impact of endoscopic vein harvest for infrainguinal bypass |journal=J Vasc Surg |volume=37 |page=323 |year=2003}}</ref> with minimal scarring.<ref name="gazoni" /><ref name="erdoes" /> The reduction in pain allows patients to get back on their feet and return to normal mobility much sooner,<ref name="patel" /><ref name="erdoes" /><ref name="suggs" /><ref name="illig" /> and have a reduced length of hospital stay.

Developed in 1995, adoption of EVH accelerated in 2005 after the International Society for Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery (ISMICS) concluded that EVH should be the standard of care for vessel harvest.<ref name="allen-k">{{cite journal |author=Allen K |title=Endoscopic Vascular Harvest in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery: A Consensus Statement of the International Society of Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery (ISMICS) 2005 |journal=Innovations |volume=1(2) |page=51 |year=2005}}</ref><ref name="cheng">{{cite journal |author=Cheng D |title= |journal=Innovations |volume=1(2) |page=61 |year=2005}}</ref> EVH is now the de facto standard of care, and is performed at most hospitals in the United States. However, a 2009 study published by Dr. Renato Lopes et al. in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' concluded that the clinical outcomes of EVH were inferior to open vessel harvesting (OVH),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lopes RD |title=Endoscopic versus open vein-graft harvesting in coronary-artery bypass surgery |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=361 |issue=3 |page=235 |year=2009 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0900708 | pmid = 19605828 }}</ref> prompting a flurry of articles in mainstream media. This study was performed between 2002–2007. Some clinicians challenged the study's conclusion, while others questioned the [[research methodology|methodology]] of the study. Other seasoned clinicians wondered if EVH adoption and practitioners' experience have affected the data, as practitioners' experiences, techniques and technologies have evolved since the study began in 2002. Many clinicians called for more long-term studies to be conducted.

In randomized clinical trials as well as other studies looking specifically at EVH,<ref name="yun" /><ref name="gazoni" /><ref name="erdoes" /><ref name="suggs" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Perrault LP |title=A prospective randomized angiographic study of open versus endoscopic saphenectomy for CABG |journal=Heart Surgery Forum |volume=6 |supplement=1 |page=S48 |year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis Z |title=Graft patency following endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting is equivalent to or better than traditional harvest |journal=Heart Surgery Forum |volume=6 |supplement=1 |page=S15 |year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Meyer DM |title=Histologic evidence of the safety of endoscopic saphenous vein graft preparation |journal=Ann Thorac Surg |volume=70 |page=487 |year=2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cook RC |title=Traction injury during minimally invasive harvesting of the saphenous vein is associated with impaired endothelial function |journal=J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=127 |page=65 |year=2004}}</ref> the endoscopic harvesting technique has been found to offer comparable graft patency at six months—meaning that, in these studies, EVH did not compromise the grafted vessel's ability to remain open and unblocked.

In 2011, a large study by Dr. Lawrence Dacey et al. was published in ''Circulation'' supporting the use of endoscopic vessel harvesting in [[cardiac surgery]].<ref name="Dacey">{{cite journal |author=Dacey LJ |title=Long-term outcomes of endoscopic vein harvesting after coronary bypass grafting |journal=Circulation |volume=123 |page=147 |year=2011}}</ref> The study compared more than 8,500 [[propensity score matching|propensity-adjusted]] patients and revealed that EVH significantly reduced wound complications without compromising long-term survival or freedom from repeat revascularization. These findings contradicted the conclusion drawn by Lopes et al. that EVH is inferior to OVH with respect to long-term survival. EVH was not associated with increased mortality or need for repeat revascularization at four years follow up.<ref name="Dacey" /> An accompanying editorial in ''Circulation'' further concluded that "EVH is here to stay" and predicted that "OVH will be obsolete in a few years." {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Dacey's study supported the findings of two other large, observational studies and reaffirmed the significant benefits of EVH in reducing wound complications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ad N |title=The impact of endoscopic vein harvest on outcome first time coronary artery bypass grafting surgery |journal=Presented at the Annual Meeting of ISMICS, Berlin, Germany. |year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ouzounian M |title=Impact of endoscopic versus open saphenous vein harvest techniques on outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting |journal=Ann Thorac Surg |volume=89 |page=403 |year=2010}}</ref> Totaling more than 16,000 patients tracked, these three studies provide strong evidence that EVH is a safe and viable technique to use to obtain a saphenous vein conduit for CABG surgery.

==Conduit Quality: Important Considerations in Successful Vessel Harvesting==
As mentioned above, the success of [[CABG]] surgery may be influenced by the quality of the "conduit" vessel and how it is handled or treated during the harvest and preparation steps prior to grafting.

The harvested blood vessel used in coronary artery bypass graft surgery must be free from damage to ensure proper long-term function and good patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Motwani JG |title=Autocoronary saphenous vein graft disease: pathogenesis, predisposition and prevention |journal=Circulation |volume=97 |issue=9 |page=916 |year=1998 |month=March}}</ref> In fact, conduit quality is a significant factor in long-term patient results. Conduit quality is not always visibly evident when looking at the exterior of the harvested vessel. Damage to the [[endothelium]], the interior of the vessel, has been shown to increase the likelihood of graft occlusion or blockage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poston RS |title=Role of procurement-related injury in early saphenous vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass surgery |journal=Future Cardiol |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=503 |year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chong CF |title=Effects of hydrostatic distention on in vitro vasoreactivity of radial artery conduits |journal=J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=128 |issue=4 |page=609 |year=2004}}</ref> Specifically, damage can be caused during the procedure by:

*	Extent of thermal injury during the branch division, cutting and sealing
*	Overhandling of the vessel – during and after harvest
*	Overdistension of the vessel – when flushing as part of graft preparation
*	Storage conditions between harvest and graft procedure

To preserve and optimize conduit quality, clinical specialists take care to avoid unnecessary thermal injury, overhandling and overdistension, and ensure proper storage conditions for the harvested vessel.

'''Thermal Injury'''

In EVH, clinical experience, comprehensive training and a careful approach are needed when cutting and removing side branches from the main vessel being harvested. As branches are cut, they must be sealed, or cauterized, to prevent bleeding after disconnection from the main vessel. In surgical practice it is common to use a form of heat or electrical energy to [[cauterization|cauterize]], or seal tissues in order to stop bleeding. If not properly controlled, the application of heat or energy to seal off the branch vessels can cause unintended thermal injury to the surrounding cells including the [[endothelium]] of the main vessel or conduit.

There are two main forms of electrical energy used for cutting and sealing off branch vessels during EVH procedures: bipolar radiofrequency (RF) and direct current (DC).

''Bipolar RF''

Bipolar RF tools pass [[alternating current|alternating electrical current]] (AC) through the tissue – in this case, the branch vessel – located between two electrodes.  As the energy passes through the vessel tissue, water molecules within the cells begin to vibrate rapidly, creating heat, resulting in tissue vaporization and coagulation.  The amount of cutting (vaporization) and sealing (coagulations) is defined by the wave form of the RF energy passed through the tissue.

''Direct Current''

With [[direct current]] devices, current flows to the heating elements contained within a set of "jaws" that clamp down on the branch vessel. The amount of heat generated by the heating elements defines the cutting and sealing.  The combination of the heat and pressure results in a single, simultaneous cut-and-seal motion.

The distance between the location at which the side branch is cut and the main conduit is especially critical to minimize thermal injury to the main vessel during dissection. On some devices, a mechanical feature is used to physically distance the main conduit from the cautery device.

'''Overhandling'''

It is important to minimize handling, which may damage or cause strain on the internal endothelial layer of the conduit. Harvester training and experience reduce the likelihood of damage. The risk of damage can also be lessened with techniques such as EVH (rather than bridging), or by using EVH devices that minimize the amount of torque or stretch to the main conduit during harvesting.

'''Overdistension'''

When a vessel is prepared for use as a bypass graft, a standard syringe is typically used to flush the vessel and check for leaks. Using uncontrolled pressure to flush or clear the vessel can result in damage to the internal cellular lining of the vessel, known as the endothelium.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poston |title=Heparin administration prior to endoscopic vein harvest limits clot retention and improves graft patency |journal=Presented at ISMICS, San Francisco, California |year=2009}}</ref> Limiting the maximum pressure that can be applied to the vessel may prevent injury and improve the overall quality and long term patency of the graft.  Pressure-limiting syringes are available, and they have been clinically shown to protect against overdistension.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ramos JR |title=Histologic fate and endothelial changes of distended and nondistended vein grafts |journal=Ann of Surg |volume=183 |page=205 |year=1976}}</ref>

'''Storage Conditions'''

Studies have indicated that endothelium and [[smooth muscle]] cells are affected by the type of storage solution, and may play a role in long-term vessel [[wikt:patency|patency]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thatte HS |title=The coronary artery bypass conduit: I.
