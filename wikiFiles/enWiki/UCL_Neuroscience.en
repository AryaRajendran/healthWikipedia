'''UCL Neuroscience''' is a [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slms/domains Research Domain] that encompasses the breadth of [[neuroscience]] research activity across [[University College London|University College London’s (UCL)]] [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slms/ School of Life and Medical Sciences]. The [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuroscience/ UCL Neuroscience Domain] was established in January 2008, to coordinate neuroscience activity across the many UCL departments and institutes in which neuroscience research takes place.   

UCL Neuroscience comprises over 450 senior [[principal investigator]]s and includes 26 [[Royal Society#Fellows|Fellows of the Royal Society]] and 60 [[Academy of Medical Sciences#Fellowship|Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080819/full/454922b.html|title=Europe gets centre of excellence for neuroscience

==History==
===20th century===
UCL has a long tradition in the neurosciences. [[Henry Hallett Dale|Henry Dale]] and [[Otto Loewi]] both worked in [[Ernest Starling|Ernest Starling’s]] laboratory in 1904 and went on to share the 1936 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for Medicine]] for their seminal investigation on the chemical transmission of nerve impulses. Starling’s successor, [[Archibald Hill|AV Hill]], fostered the career of [[Bernard Katz]], whose long association with UCL began in 1935. Later on in 1970, he shared the Nobel Prize with [[Ulf von Euler]], who had also worked in Hill’s laboratory at UCL, and Julius Axelrod, once again for work on chemical [[neurotransmission]].  

Fatt and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] were the first to propose that neurotransmitter release at synapses was quantal in nature. They also uncovered the mechanism underlying inhibitory synaptic transmission. 

In a series of seminal papers in the early 70’s, [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] and [[Ricardo Miledi]], described a statistical analysis of fluctuations they observed in the membrane potential at the frog neuromuscular junction, which were induced by [[acetylcholine]]. This approach, which became known as ‘noise analysis’, allowed the first measurement of the conductance and lifetime of single ACh receptor channels.

Katz’s work had a strong influence on another future Nobel Prize winner, [[Bert Sakmann]]. He spent two years at UCL in Katz’s biophysics laboratory and it was here that he developed his interest in the molecular aspects of synaptic transmission.
He went on to directly measure singe [[ion channel]] currents by developing the now ubiquitously used [[patch clamp|patch-clamp]] technique with [[Erwin Neher]]. They shared the 1991 Prize in recognition of their work on the function of single ion channels

Neuroscience at UCL has long been a major cross-disciplinary endeavour. Indeed, [[John Zachary Young|JZ Young]], Professor of Anatomy, 1945-74, discovered and was the first to investigate the [[squid giant axon]]. Young’s work on squid giant axons was utilized by [[Andrew Huxley]] and [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Alan Hodgkin]] who in 1963 received the Nobel Prize for [[Hodgkin-Huxley model|their work on the conduction of action potentials along nerve fibres]]. To achieve this, they developed a voltage-clamp technique to demonstrate that impulse transmission relied upon the selective permeablity of the nerve fibre membrane to particular ions. This ground-breaking advance laid the foundations for much of modern-day [[electrophysiology]].

===21st century===
