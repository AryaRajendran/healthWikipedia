The '''chronic endothelial injury hypothesis''' is one of two major mechanisms postulated to explain the underlying cause of [[atherosclerosis]] and [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD), the other being the [[lipid hypothesis]].  Although an ongoing debate involving connection between dietary lipids and CHD sometimes portrays the two hypotheses as being opposed, they are in no way mutually exclusive.  Moreover, since the discovery of the role of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] [[cholesterol]] (LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of [[atherosclerosis]], the two hypotheses have become tightly linked by a number of molecular and cellular processes.<ref>cf. {{Cite book| first = Robert III | last =  Carter | first2 = Harlan P| last2 = Jones| editor-last = Moffatt| editor-first = Robert J.| editor2-last = Stamford | editor2-first = Bryand | contribution = The Vascular Biology of Athersclerosis | title = Lipid Metabolism and Health| year = 20| pages = 61–84| place = New York| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 0-8493-2680-X  }}</ref>

== Origins of the hypothesis ==

== The inflammatory process ==

The first phase of the inflammatory process is marked by the accumulation of [[lipid]] and [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) particles  beneath the [[endothelium]].  This is followed by the attachment of [[leukocytes]], [[monocytes]], and [[T-lymphocytes]] to the endothelial cell surface.   Leukocytes migrate to the subendothelial space and aggregate within the [[intima]]. 

In the presence of elevated levels of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), monocytes are converted to activated [[macrophages]]. Macrophages accumulate modified lipid particles and become [[foam cells]].  The formation of foam cells and their continued accumulation in the intima lead to the formation of [[fatty streaks]]. Continued cell migration and proliferation eventually result in the formation of a fibrous plaque.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Ross  | first = R  | title = Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease | journal = The American Heart Journal | volume = 138 | issue = 5 | pages = S419–S420 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-8703(99)70266-8  }}</ref>

== The role of oxidized LDL ==

Once LDL accumulates in the subendothelial space, it tends to become  modified or oxidized.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Vasankari|first= Tommi| title=Oxidized LDL and thickness of carotid intima-media are associated with coronary atherosclerosis in middle-aged men: lower levels of oxidized LDL with statin therapy |journal= Atherosclerosis |volume= 155|issue=2 |pages=403–412  |doi = 10.1016/S0021-9150(00)00573-6 |pmid= 11254911 |year= 2001 |last2= Ahotupa |first2= M |last3= Toikka |first3= J |last4= Mikkola |first4= J |last5= Irjala |first5= K |last6= Pasanen |first6= P |last7= Neuvonen |first7= K |last8= Raitakari |first8= O |last9= Viikari |first9= J |display-authors= 1  }}</ref>  This oxidized LDL plays several key roles in furthering the course of the inflammatory process.  It is [[chemotactic]] to [[monocytes]];  oxidized LDL causes endothelial cells to secrete molecules that cause monocytes to penetrate between the endothelial cells and accumulate in the intima.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Libby  | first = P  | title = Inflammation and cardiovascular disease mechanisms | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | year = 2006 | volume = 83(suppl) | issue = 2| pages = 456S–460S| id = 994471841 }}</ref>

Oxidized LDL  promotes death of endothelial cells by augmenting [[apoptosis]].  Also, through the activation of [[collagenases]], ox-LDL contributes to a process which may lead to the rupture of the fibrous plaque<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Libby  | first = P  | title = The Molecular Mechanisms of the Thrombotic Complications of Atherosclerosis | journal = Journal of Internal Medicine | year = 2008 | volume = 263 | issue = 5| pages = 517–527 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2008.01965.x  | pmid = 18410595  | pmc = 2562742}}</ref> Oxidized LDL decreases the availability of endothelial nitric oxide (NO), which, in turn, increases the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Laufs | first = U  | title = Upregulation of Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase by HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitors  | journal = Circulation | year = 1998 | volume =  97 | pages = 1129–1135 | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/12/1129  | pmid = 9537338  | issue = 12  | author2 = L  | author3 = P  | author4 = L  | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.97.12.1129}}</ref> Moreover, NO is involved in paracrine signalling between the endothelium and the smooth muscle that maintains vascular tone; without it, the muscle will not relax, and the blood vessel remains constricted. Thus, oxidized LDL also contributes to the [[hypertension]] often seen with atherosclerosis.

==Implications for the treatment and prevention of arteriosclerosis==

The role LDL plays suggests two different approaches to treatment and prevention.  The first approach involves discouraging the accumulation of LDL  by lowering the levels of  serum LDL, an idea more closely associated with the [[lipid hypothesis]].   A major breakthrough involved the discovery of [[statins]], a class of drugs which help to clear LDL from the bloodstream.  It has been demonstrated conclusively  that elevated levels of LDL are associated with higher risk of mortality from [[Coronary disease|coronary heart disease]] (CHD); it has also been shown that statins substantially lower the risk of mortality in patients with high LDL.

A second approach would be to discourage the oxidation of LDL, thereby breaking the inflammatory cycle.  [[Lipoproteins]] consist of a packaging of [[triglycerides]] and [[esterfied]] [[cholesterol]] within a monolayer shell consisting of [[phospholipids]] and a class of proteins called [[apolipoproteins]].  The phospholipds are [[amphipathic]], consisting of a [[hydrophobic]] tail which faces inwards, binding with the triglycerides and cholesterol, and a [[hydrophilic]] head which faces outwards, making the lipoproteins water soluble.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Davis | first = Paul G | last2 = Wagganer | first2 = Jason D |  year = 2006 | contribution = Lipid and Lipoprotein Metabolism | title = Lipid Metabolism  and Health | editor-last = Moffatt | editor-first = Robert J | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton |pages = 47–60 | isbn = 0-8493-2680-X | editor3-last = Stamford | editor3-first = Bryant }}</ref>

[[Polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFA) contained in the outer shell make the lipoproteins especially susceptible to oxidation. However, lipoproteins also contain  [[antioxidants]] which protect the components, [[vitamin E]] and [[carotenoids]] being the two major naturally-occurring antioxidants in human lipoprotein.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bowry| first =  V.W. | last2 = Ingold | first2 = K.U. | last3 = Stocker | last4 = R | title = Vitamin E in human low-density lipoprotein.

Although some studies have shown positive results following anti-oxidant therapy with [[vitamin C]],<ref>{{cite journal | last = Solzbach | first =  U| last2 = Horning | first2 = B | last3 = Jeserich | first3 = M | title = Vitamin C improves endothelial dysfunction of epicardial coronary arteries in hypertensibe patients | journal = Circulation | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 1273–4 | pmid = 9315540 | year = 1997 | last4 = Just | first4 = H  }}</ref> vitamin E therapy has attracted the most public attention.

== Implications for diet: Dietary lipids and LDL levels ==

An early incarnation of the [[lipid hypothesis]] which focused on [[hypercholesterolemia]] lead to the suggestion that mortality from CHD might be reduced by controlling dietary input of cholesterol.  Studies have demonstrated that increasing dietary cholesterol leads to an increase in both total cholesterol (TC) and LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C), however it also leads to increases in the level of [[high-density lipoprotein]] cholesterol (HDL-C), offsetting the effect of the increase in LDL-C.  Epidemological studies which attempted to correlate dietary cholesterol with risk of mortality in CHD have produced mixed results.<ref name="Hilpert2006">{{Cite book | first = Kirsten F | last =Hilpert | last2 = Criel | first3 = Tricia | last3 = Psota | first4 = Sarah | last4 = Gbauer | first5 = Yumei |last5 = Coa | first6 = Penny M. | last6 = Kris-Etherton | editor-last = Moffatt | editor-first = Robert J. | editor2-last = Stamford | editor2-first =  Bryant | contribution = New insights on the Role of Lipids and Lipoproteins in Cardiovascular Disease |  title = Lipid Metabolism and Health  | year = 2006| pages = 211–263 | place = Boca Raton | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 0-8493-2680-X }}</ref>

Recent studies have focused more on the ratio of [[saturated fatty acids]] (SFAs) and [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFAs) in the diet.   It has been demonstrated that intake of SFA raises TC in humans, whereas PUFA lowers TC; however SFA also increases the level of HDL-C,  once more offsetting the effect of increased TC. Studies of individual fatty acids show that some SFAs, ''e.g.'' [[stearic acid]] and [[palmitic acid]] have little effect of LDL-C levels; stearic acid actually ''lowers'' the LDL/HDL ratio due to a greater increase of HDL-C levels relative to TC.<ref name="Hilpert2006" />  

Epidemiological  studies designed to test the relationship between high SFA/PUFA ratios and CHD mortality have tended to produce mixed results.  Two recent studies provide an example of this lack of consensus:  a study from Poland correlated a decline in CHD mortality with a decrease in the ratio of SFA to PUFA in the population's diet following the collapse of communism.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Zatonski | first = W | last2 = Willett |  title = Changes in dietary fat and declining coronary heart disease in Poland: population based study | journal = BMJ | volume =  331| issue = 32  | pages = 187–188 |  date =  July 2005| doi =  10.1136/bmj.331.7510.187 | first2 = W | pmid = 16037448 | pmc = 1179759 }}</ref> Yet a large population study from Sweden covering roughly the same time period showed ''no'' association between fat intake and CHD.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Leosdottitr | first =  M |  last2 = Nilsson | first2 = PM | last3 = Nilsson | first3 = JÅ | last4 = Månsson | first4 = H | last5 = Berglund | first5 = G |  title = Cardiovascular event risk in relation to dietary fat intake in middle-aged individuals: data from The Malmö Diet and Cancer Study | date = October 2007 | journal = Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil | volume = 14  | issue = 5 | pages =  701–6| pmid=17925631 | doi = 10.1097/HJR.0b013e3282a56c45 }}</ref>

== The AHA guidelines and the beginning of a controversy ==

The early studies associating the ratio of dietary SFA and PUFA with TC levels led the [[American Heart Association]] (AHA) to promulgate a set of dietary guidelines which included the recommendation to replace saturated fats found in  dairy and meat products with polyunsaturated fats found in natural vegetable oils such as those derived from "corn, cottonseed, and soya".  This first set of recommendations, published in the Journal ''Circulation''  in 1961, specifically sanctioned the use of products containing [[partially hydrogenated]] vegetable oils, ''i.e.'' [[margarine]] and vegetable [[shortening]].<ref>{{cite journal | last =  Page| first =  Irving H.  | title = Dietary fat and its relation to heart attacks and strokes: report by the Central Committee for Medical and Community Program of the American Heart Association  | journal = Circulation| volume =  23| issue = 1  | year = 1961 | pages = 133–136 | author-separator =  , | display-authors =  1  }}</ref>  Despite the lack of uncontrovertable epidemiological evidence of their effectiveness, these initial guidelines  received widespread acceptance among the medical community in the US.  

The suggestion to replace saturated animal fats with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils lead to a reaction which will be discussed below.    However, is important to note that the AHA's dietary guidelines have undergone several revisions since the initial report.  Although the most recent (2006) guidelines still recommend reducing the consumption of saturated fat, they no longer suggest switching to polyunsaturated fats. Moreover, the guidelines now recommend ''minimizing''  the intake of partially hydrogenated fats while increasing the consumption of fish and other sources rich in [[omega-3 fatty acids]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lichtenstein | first = Alice H | title = Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations Revision 2006. A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee  | journal = Circulation | volume = 114 | issue =  1 | pages =  82–96| publisher = | location = | date = June 16, 2006 |doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.176158 | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/114/1/82 | pmid = 16785338 | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = AH | last3 = Appel | first3 = LJ | last4 = Brands | first4 = M | last5 = Carnethon | first5 = M | last6 = Daniels | first6 = S | last7 = Franch | first7 = HA | last8 = Franklin | first8 = B | last9 = Kris-Etherton | first9 = P | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 }}</ref>  Thus,  the position of the AHA is now much closer to that of its critics.

== Criticism of the AHA guidelines: the “Cholesterol Skeptics” ==

Critics of the AHA dietary guidelines point out that incidence of CHD in the US  increased markedly during a 60 year period beginning in 1910.   During the same period, consumption of saturated fat fell, while consumption of processed vegetable oils rose more than 400%.<ref>{{cite book | last = Eng  | first = Mary G  | title = Trans Fatty Acids in the Food Supply: A Comprehensive Report Covering 60 Years of Research y | volume = 9  | issue = 1 | pages = 65–71 | publisher = Enig Associates | location = Silver Spring | date = 1993 (2nd edition) | asin =  B0006P0694 }}</ref> (Much of the evidence presented to support this claim of a large increase in incidence of CHD in the early part of the century is anecdotal.  Statistics covering the period from 1950 to 1980 show that mortality from CHD in the US, although much higher than in most other countries, began to decline slowly after 1966 (mortality in the  UK, although initially much lower than in the US, rose continuously during this period).  These are ''mortality'' figures; the downward trend in the US probably reflects improvements in survival rate and not a decrease in ''incidence''.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Dwyer  | first = Terry | last2 = Hetzed | first2 = Basik | title = A Comparison of Trends of Coronary Heart Disease Mortality in Australia, USA and England and Wales with Reference to Three Major Risk Factors – Hypertension, Cigarette Smoking and Diet | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 9  | issue = 1 | pages = 65–71 | publisher = | location = | date = March, 1980 | url = http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/65| doi =10.1093/ije/9.1.65 | pmid = 7419332 }}</ref>)

This observation led some critics to ''invert'' the AHA guidelines. They stress benefits of dietary SFA, citing presence of natural antioxidants in animal fats, while encouraging people to avoid foods containing processed vegetable oils. They focus on deleterious effect of dietary PUFA, often mentioning two factors: (1) the vulnerability of PUFA to oxidation and the formation of [[free radicals]], and (2) the high ratio of [[omega-6]] to [[omega-3]] PUFA in the more common vegetable oils—those derived from “corn, cottonseed, and soya”. Their considerations are not limited to CHD, they point to an entire litany of inflammatory disorders which can be linked to diet and the consumption of processed vegetable oils.<ref>{{cite book| last = Enig | first = Marry | first2 = Sally  |  title = Nourishing Traditions: The Cookbook that Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats | publisher =  New Trends Publishing| year =  1999|  isbn = 0-9670897-3-5| unused_data = last 2 = Fallon }}.  Relevant parts of the book are excerpted in the on-line article {{cite journal |  title = The Skinny on Fats | url = http://www.westonaprice.org/knowyourfats/skinny.html }} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> Some critics also question the ''safety'' of cholesterol-lowering drugs, suggesting that CHD is best controlled using a combination of diet and exercise.  

This preoccupation with inflammatory processes has led some authors to popularize the chronic endothelial injury hypothesis. They also criticize the “lipid hypothesis”;  however, for the most part, what is being criticized is not the lipid hypothesis itself, but a set of dietary guidelines that evolved from it. The debate is not (or should not be) about ''validity'' of the two hypotheses, but rather the ''relative benefits'' of two different therapeutic approaches: whether it is more productive to concentrate on lowering LDL levels or to focus on the underlying inflammatory mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Many of these critics appeal to a popular, anti-establishment audience. At the most radical end of this spectrum, a number of  books have been written which suggest the existence of a conspiracy between the “medical establishment” and  “financial interests”, ''i.e.'' the food-processing industry and drug companies.<ref>One recent example is: {{cite book | last = Kendrick | first = Malcolm  | title = The Great Cholesterol Con: The Truth About What Really Causes Heart Disease and How to Avoid It |   publisher = John Blake |  pages = 238 | year =  2008| isbn = 1-84454-610-1 }}</ref>
