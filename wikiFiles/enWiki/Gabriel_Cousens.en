In 1974 he went to India to study with [[Muktananda|Swami Muktananda]], ending up staying for seven years. After experiencing a [[Kundalini]] awakening in 1975, Cousens sought the ideal diet to support his spiritual experience and nurture spiritual growth, concluding that a live-food diet would do so. He returned to the United States in 1981 and returned to the study of the Essene Way, becoming ordained in 1988; he also became a [[Reiki]] master.<ref name="Melton"/> Among consumers and supporters of [[alternative medicine]], Cousens acquired a reputation as an expert in spirituality,<ref>Arlene Fine.

[[Joel Fuhrman]], nutritional specialist and author who advocates more raw food consumption, said that an all-raw food diet could lead to vitamin and caloric deficiencies in children. A 2005 study in Archives of Internal Medicine found no major deficiencies in the bone health of adults on raw diets. While the raw food group had lower weights and bone mass, they had normal vitamin D levels.<ref name="Columbia"/>

In 1998, 57-year-old Charles Levy of New Jersey died after being treated at the center over a five-day period. The cause of death was determined by the [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona|Santa Cruz County]] Medical Examiner, who along with the Arizona Osteopathic Medical Board attributed the death to a [[gas gangrene]] infection caused by "bovine adrenal fluid" injections given by Cousens as part of a treatment for [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name="sandal">{{cite news |author=Sandal, Inger |date=June 24, 1999 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=0EACE66215238763 |title=Homeopathic doctor sued over death linked to bovine-fluid shots |publisher=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref><ref name="phoenixnews1">{{cite news |author=Dickerson, John |date=April 10, 2008 |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2008-04-10/news/arizona-s-homeopathic-board-is-the-second-chance-for-doctors-who-ve-lost-their-conventional-medical-licenses-in-other-states/3/ |title=Arizona's homeopathic board is the second chance for doctors who may not deserve one |publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]] |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}</ref><ref name="azcentral1">{{cite news |author=Sherwood, Robbie |date=October 9, 2005 |url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/1009homeopathic09sidebar.html |title=Homeopath patient's death debated despite Ariz. board clearing doctor |publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]] |accessdate=March 4, 2012 }}</ref> The autopsy also found that Levy had [[hepatitis]], [[encephalomyelitis]], and [[coronary atherosclerosis]].<ref name="sandal"/> Levy's son said that his father was healthy, able to run three miles, not overweight, and had no high blood pressure at the time of his visit to the spa, and the family sued for [[malpractice]].<ref name="phoenixnews1"/> Cousens settled the suit for an undisclosed amount paid to the family. The case came up before the Arizona Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners in 2001. Despite the medical examiner's report and testimony, then Board Chairman Dr. Bruce Shelton said he "found no medical fault with Dr. Cousens' care of" Levy and the board found "no violation of homeopathic law" in Cousens' treatment.<ref name="phoenixnews1"/><ref name="azcentral1"/> Cousens argued that the medical examiner had misdiagnosed the cause of death, which he said was toxic shock unrelated to the injections, a claim that the Levy family attorney called "outrageous".<ref name="azcentral1"/>

A 2009 documentary, ''[[Simply Raw: Reversing Diabetes in 30 Days|Simply Raw]]'', followed six people with [[diabetes]] who go through a thirty-day program at the Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center in an attempt to cure their disease with a raw food diet and without drugs.<ref name="welte">{{cite news |author=Welte, Jim |date=August 23, 2009 |url=http://www.marinij.com/sanrafael/ci_13191323  |title=San Rafael man touts raw food in new documentary |publisher=[[Marin Independent Journal]] |accessdate=March 5, 2012}}</ref>
