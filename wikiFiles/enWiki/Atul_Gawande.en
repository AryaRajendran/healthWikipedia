==Early years==
Gawande was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to Indian [[Marathi people|Maharashtrian]] immigrants to the United States, both doctors. The family soon moved to [[Athens, Ohio]], where he and his sister grew up.  He obtained an undergraduate degree from [[Stanford University]] in 1987, was a [[Rhodes scholar]] (earning a degree in Philosophy, Politics & Economics from [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1989), and later graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1995. He also has a [[Master of Public Health]] degree from the Harvard School of Public Health (earned 1999).

==Political career and medical school==
As a student Gawande was a volunteer for [[Gary Hart]]'s campaign. As a Rhodes Scholar, he spent one year at Oxford University. After graduation, he joined [[Al Gore]]'s 1998 presidential campaign. He worked as a health-care researcher for Congressman [[Jim Cooper]] (D-TN), who was author of a "managed competition" health care proposal for the [[Conservative Democratic Forum]]. After two years he left medical school to become [[Bill Clinton]]'s health care lieutenant during the 1992 campaign and became a senior adviser in the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] after Clinton's inauguration. He directed one of the three committees of the [[1993 Clinton health care plan#Task Force|Clinton Health Care Task Force]], supervising 75 people and defined the benefits packages for Americans and subsidies and requirements for employers. He returned to medical school in 1993 and earned his M.D in 1994.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/05/30/uo.php Former Policymaker Opts for Hands-On Health Care - International Herald Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Journalism==
Soon after he began his [[residency (medicine)|residency]], his friend [[Jacob Weisberg]], editor of ''Slate'', asked him to contribute to the online magazine. His pieces on the life of a surgical resident caught the eye of the ''New Yorker'' which published several pieces by him before making him a staff writer in 1998.

A June 2009 ''New Yorker'' essay by Gawande<ref name="Conundrum">{{cite news |title=The Cost Conundrum – What a Texas town can teach us about health care |author=Atul Gawande |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |date=June 1, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all |accessdate=June 29, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110610174307/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all| archivedate= June 10 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> compared the health care of two towns in Texas to show why health care was more expensive in one town compared to the other. Using the town of [[McAllen, Texas]] as an example, it argued that a revenue-maximizing businessman-like culture (which can provide substantial amounts of [[Overutilization|unnecessary care]]) was an important factor in driving up costs, unlike a culture of low-cost high-quality care as provided by the [[Mayo Clinic]] and other efficient health systems. 

[[Ezra Klein]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "the best article you'll see this year on American health care—why it's so expensive, why it's so poor, [and] what can be done."<ref>Ezra Klein (May 27, 2009).
