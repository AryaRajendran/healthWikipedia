'''Köhler disease''' (also spelled "Kohler") is a rare [[bone]] disorder of the [[foot]] found in children between six and nine years of age. The disease typically affects [[boy]]s, but it can also affect [[girl]]s.  It was first described in 1908 by [[Alban Köhler]] (1874–1947), a [[Germany|German]] [[radiologist]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Köhler A |title=Über eine häufige, bisher anscheinend unbekannte Erkrankung einzelner kindlicher Knochen |journal=Münchener medizinische Wochenschrift |volume=55 |pages=1923–5 |year=1908 }}</ref><ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2676}}</ref>

It is caused when the [[navicular bone]] temporarily loses its [[blood]] supply. As a result, [[Biological tissue|tissue]] in the bone dies and the bone collapses.  When treated, it causes no long term problems in most cases although rarely can return in adults. As the navicular bone gets back to normal, symptoms typically abate.  

In February 2010 the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that the 19-year-old king [[Tutankhamun]] may well have died of complications from malaria combined with Kohler disease II.<ref>{{cite news |author=Roberts, Michelle |title='Malaria and weak bones' may have killed Tutankhamun |work=BBC News |date=16 February 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8516425.stm}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Sufferers experience [[pain]] and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] in the middle part of the foot and usually limp as a result. Patients that walk with a limp tend to walk with increased weight on the lateral side of the foot. Also, there can be tenderness over the navicular. Patients often complain of pain  over the apex.
An [[X-ray]] of both feet is used to diagnose disease. The affected foot tends to have a sclerotic and flattened navicular bone.

==Treatment==

Treatment usually involves resting the affected foot, taking pain relievers and trying to avoid putting pressure on the foot. In acute cases, the patient is often fitted with a [[Cast (orthopedic)|cast]] that stops below the [[knee]]. The cast is usually worn for 6 to 8 weeks. After the cast is taken off, some patients are prescribed arch support for about 6 months. Also, moderate [[physical exercise|exercise]] is often beneficial, and physical therapy may help as well.

Prognosis for children with this disease is very good. It may persist for some time, but most cases are resolved within two years of the initial diagnosis.
