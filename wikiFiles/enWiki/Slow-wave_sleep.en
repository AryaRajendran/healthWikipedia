An epoch (30 seconds of sleep) which consists of 20% or more slow wave (delta) sleep, now is considered to be stage 3.

Slow-wave sleep is considered important to consolidate new memories.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/health/brain-aging-linked-to-sleep-related-memory-decline.html</ref>

==Discussion==

The highest [[arousal]] thresholds (i.e. difficulty of awakening, such as by a sound of a particular volume) are observed in deep sleep. A person will typically feel more groggy when awoken from slow-wave sleep, and indeed, cognitive tests administered after awakening then indicate that mental performance is somewhat impaired for periods of up to 30 minutes or so, relative to awakenings from other stages. This phenomenon has been called "[[sleep inertia]]."

After [[sleep deprivation]] there is a sharp rebound of SWS, that is, the following bout of sleep will include more and deeper SWS than normal.

The major factor determining how much slow-wave sleep is observed in a given sleep period is the duration of preceding wakefulness, likely related to accumulation of sleep-promoting substances in the brain. Some of the few factors known to increase slow-wave sleep in the sleep period that follows them include body heating (as by immersion in a hot tub), high carbohydrate ingestion, and intense prolonged exercise. The latter probably exerts its influence by increasing body temperature.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In addition to these factors, the duration of SWS periods can be increased by the ingestion of THC,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truthonpot.com/2012/11/03/marijuana-and-sleep/|title=Marijuana and Sleep |publisher=TruthOnPot.com |date=2012-11-03 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> certain [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s, and other antidepressants. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In instances such as these, TST (Total Sleep Time) is often unaffected due to [[circadian rhythms]] and/or a person's alarm clock and early morning obligations. This increase of SWS can lead to increased [[REM sleep|REM]] latency and a decrease in REM period durations. If the total time spent in REM is decreased long enough and repeatedly over a substantial number of nights a "REM rebound" will occur in response to removal of its inhibitor. An increase in REM is believed to produce symptoms of depression and bipolar disorder in many patients for an amount of time relative to the severity of the previous "REM suppression." It is debatable whether or not this could explain the return in symptoms of depression disorder after removal of [[SSRI]] medications.

Certain substances, such as [[benzodiazepines]] (e.g. [[Ativan]], [[Valium]], [[Klonopin]]) seem to have the reverse effect on the time spent in SWS.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Instead of lengthening SWS (as do the substances mentioned above), they are known to shorten the time. While these sedatives can increase sleep duration or shorten the time it takes before sleep-onset occurs, they tend to deprive patients of deep sleep.

The chemical [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB) is known to promote SWS.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] permits the use of GHB under the trade name [[Xyrem]] to reduce [[cataplexy]] attacks and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with [[narcolepsy]].

Reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) may predict high blood pressure in older men. <ref>http://www.brighamandwomens.org/about_bwh/publicaffairs/news/pressreleases/PressRelease.aspx?sub=0&PageID=942</ref>

A study from the Department of Endocrinology at [[Boston Children's Hospital]], an affiliate of [[Harvard Medical School]], indicated that regular deep sleep in children is helpful in triggering the steady release of the hormones that cause [[puberty]].<ref>http://www.massgeneral.org/about/pressrelease.aspx?id=1502</ref>

==Electroencephalographic characteristics==
[[File:Sleep EEG Stage 4.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Polysomnogram demonstrating SWS, stage 4.<br>High amplitude EEG is highlighted in red.]]
Large 75-microvolt (0.5–2&nbsp;Hz) [[delta wave]]s predominate the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG). Stage N3 is defined by the presence of 20% [[delta wave]]s in any given 30-second epoch of the EEG during sleep, by the current 2007 AASM guidelines.<ref name="2007 AASM Guidelines"/>

Longer periods of slow-wave sleep occur in the first part of the night, primarily in the first two sleep cycles (roughly 3 hours). Children and young adults will have more total slow-wave sleep in a night than older adults. The elderly may not go into slow-wave sleep at all during many nights of sleep.

Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is an active phenomenon probably brought about by the activation of [[serotonergic]] neurons of the [[raphe]] system.

The slow wave seen in the cortical EEG is generated through thalamocortical communication through the thalamocortical [[neuron]]s.<ref>Williams SR, Tóth TI, Turner JP, Hughes SW, Crunelli W (1997) The window component of the low threshold Ca2+ current produces input signal amplification and bistability in cat and rat thalamocortical neurones. J Physiol 505:689–705.</ref> In the TC neurons this is generated by the "slow oscillation" and is dependent on [[membrane potential]] [[bistability]], a property of these neurons due to an electrophysiological component known as I t Window. I t Window is due to the overlap underneath activation/inactivation curves if plotted for T-type calcium channels (inward current). If these two curves are multiplied, and another line superimposed on the graph to show a small Ik leak current (outward), then the interplay between these inward (I t Window) and outward (small Ik leak), three [[equilibrium points]] are seen at −90, −70 and −60 mv, −90 and −60 being stable and −70 unstable. This property allows the generation of slow waves due to an oscillation between two stable points. It is important to note that in ''[[in vitro]]'', mGluR must be activated on these neurons to allow a small Ik leak, as seen in ''[[in vivo]]'' situations.
