'''Freshers' Flu''' is the name commonly given to a battery of illnesses contracted by as many as 90%<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/hub/A645211 BBC - Freshers' Flu]**</ref> of new students during the first few weeks at a [[university]], in some form; common symptoms include fever, sore throat, severe headache, coughing and general discomfort
.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/students/diaries/suzanne_w/1_flu.shtml BBC Student Diary]</ref> The illnesses may or may not include actual [[influenza|flu]], and is often simply a bad [[Common Cold|cold]], but is so named simply due to [[alliteration]]. This is mostly a [[United Kingdom|British]] term, and is rarely heard outside the UK.

==Causes==
The most likely cause is the convergence of large numbers of people arriving from all over the world, many of whom carry "germs" (it is more accurate to call it bacteria or virus or even fungi) to which they are immune, but others have not had a chance to acquire the necessary immunity.<ref>[http://student.independent.co.uk/into_university/clearing/article2862108.ece Independent Online]</ref>  The poor diet and heavy consumption of alcohol during [[Orientation week|Freshers' Week]] is also reported as a cause for many of the illnesses contracted during this time. "Stress, which may be induced by tiredness, combined with a poor diet, late nights and too much alcohol, can weaken the immune system and be a recipe for ill health. All this can make students and staff working with the students more susceptible to infections within their first weeks of term." <ref>[http://www.bupa.co.uk/about/html/pr/100907_freshers_flu.html Dr Peter Mace, clinical director at BUPA Wellness]</ref> In addition to this, nearly all university academic years in the UK commence around the end of September or beginning of October, which "marks the start of the annual flu season". The increased susceptibility to illness from late nights, heavy alcohol consumption and stress peaks 2â€“4 weeks after arrival at university and happens to coincide with the seasonal surge in the outbreaks of colds and influenza in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref>http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2010PressReleases/101006flu/</ref>

==Other effects==
As well as the usual viral effects, Freshers' Flu can also have some psychological effects. These effects arise where the stress of leaving home and other consequences of being independent, not to mention various levels of [[homesickness]] and the attempts at making new friends, can further weaken the immune system, increasing susceptibility to illness.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/hub/A645211 BBC -  Freshers' Flu]</ref>
