'''Microbiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μῑκρος}}, ''mīkros'', "small"; {{lang|grc|βίος}}, ''bios'', "[[life]]"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of  [[microscopic]] [[organisms]], either [[unicellular]] (single cell), [[multicellular]] (cell colony), or [[acellular]] (lacking cells).<ref name=Brock>{{cite book | author = Madigan M, Martinko J (editors) | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 13th | publisher = Pearson Education | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-321-73551-X |page = 1096}}</ref>  Microbiology includes the disciplines [[virology]], [[mycology]], [[parasitology]], [[bacteriology]], and so on.

[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] microorganisms exhibit cell [[organelles]] and include [[fungi]] and [[protists]], whereas [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms—which all are microorganisms—are conventionally classified as lacking organelles and include [[eubacteria]] and [[archaebacteria]].  Microbiologists traditionally relied on culture, staining, and microscopy.  Apparently, however, only some 1% of the microorganisms present in some environments are culturable.<ref name="Amann1995">{{cite journal | author = Nitesh RAI, Ludwig W, Schleifer KH | year = 2011 | title = Phylogenetic identification and in situ detection of individual microbial cells without cultivation | journal = Microbiology Rev. | volume = 59 | pages = 143–169 | pmid = 7535888 | issue = 1 | pmc = 239358}}</ref>  Microbiologists often rely on extraction or detection of [[nucleic acid]], either DNA or RNA sequences.

[[Virus]]es are not always classified as organisms,<ref>{{cite web | author = Rice G | title = Are Viruses Alive? | url = http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/yellowstone/viruslive.html | date = 2007-03-27 |accessdate = 2007-07-23}}</ref> as they have been identified either as very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules.  [[Prions]], never considered microorganisms, have been investigated by virologists, however, as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to chronic viral infections, and virologists took search—discovering "infectious proteins".

As an application of microbiology, [[medical microbiology]] is often introduced with medical principles of immunology as ''microbiology and immunology''.  Otherwise, microbiology, virology, and immunology as [[basic science]]s have greatly exceeded the medical variants, [[applied science]]s.<ref>Penn M & Dworkin M, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/786252 "Robert Koch and two visions of microbiology"], ''Bacteriol Rev'', 1976 Jun;'''40'''(2):276-83</ref><ref>Paracer S & Ahmadjian  V, ''Symbiosis: An Introduction to Biological Associations'', 2nd edn (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), [http://books.google.com/books?id=OmZ6CfHQIZ8C&pg=PA10&dq=Bacteria+multicellular+organisms p 10]</ref><ref>Smith KA, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12437786 "Medical immunology: A new journal for a new subspecialty"], ''Med Immunol'', 2002 Sep 30;'''1'''(1):1</ref>

==Branches==
The branches of microbiology can be classified into pure and applied sciences.<ref name="Pharmaceutical Microbiology Principles and Applications">{{cite book|title=Pharmaceutical Microbiology Principles and Applications|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VN9Oj2MKTkQC&pg=SA1-PA1|accessdate=18 June 2011|publisher=Nirali Prakashan|isbn=978-81-85790-61-9|pages=1.1–1.2}}</ref> Microbiology can be also classified based on taxonomy, in the cases of bacteriology, mycology, protozoology, and phycology. There is considerable overlap between the specific branches of microbiology with each other and with other disciplines.

==Benefits==
[[File:Samadams2.jpg|thumb|right|Fermenting tanks with [[yeast]] being used to [[Brewing|brew]] [[beer]] ]]
While some fear microbes due to the association of some microbes with various human illnesses, many microbes are also responsible for numerous beneficial processes such as [[industrial fermentation]] (e.g. the production of [[alcohol]], [[vinegar]] and [[dairy products]]), [[antibiotic]] production and as vehicles for [[cloning]] in more complex organisms such as plants. Scientists have also exploited their knowledge of microbes to produce biotechnologically important [[enzyme]]s such as [[Taq polymerase]], [[reporter gene]]s for use in other genetic systems and novel molecular biology techniques such as the [[two-hybrid screening|yeast two-hybrid system]].

Bacteria can be used for the industrial production of [[amino acid]]s. ''Corynebacterium glutamicum'' is one of the most important bacterial species with an annual production of more than two million tons of amino acids, mainly L-glutamate and L-lysine.<ref name= BurkovskiA>{{cite book | author = Burkovski A (editor). | title = Corynebacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/cory | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/cory isbn = 1-904455-30-1]}}</ref>

A variety of [[biopolymer]]s, such as [[polysaccharide]]s, [[polyester]]s, and [[polyamide]]s, are produced by microorganisms. Microorganisms are used for the biotechnological production of biopolymers with tailored properties suitable for high-value medical application such as [[tissue engineering]] and drug delivery. Microorganisms are used for the biosynthesis of [[xanthan]], [[alginate]], [[cellulose]], [[cyanophycin]], poly(gamma-glutamic acid), [[levan polysaccharide|levan]], [[hyaluronic acid]], organic acids, [[oligosaccharide]]s and [[polysaccharide]], and polyhydroxyalkanoates.<ref name= RehmBHA>{{cite book | author = Rehm BHA (editor). | title = Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors: Applications and Perspectives | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/biopolymers | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/biopolymers   isbn = 978-1-904455-36-3]}}</ref>

Microorganisms are beneficial for [[microbial biodegradation]] or [[bioremediation]] of domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes and subsurface [[pollution]] in soils, sediments and marine environments. The ability of each microorganism to degrade [[toxic waste]] depends on the nature of each [[contaminant]]. Since sites typically have multiple pollutant types, the most effective approach to [[microbial biodegradation]] is to use a mixture of bacterial species and strains, each specific to the [[biodegradation]] of one or more types of contaminants.<ref name=Diaz>{{cite book | author = Diaz E (editor). | title = Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/biod | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/biod isbn = 1-904455-17-4]}}</ref>

There is considerable evidence supporting microbial contributions to human and animal health. Some benefit may be be conferred by consuming fermented foods,  [[probiotics]] (bacteria potentially beneficial to the digestive system) and/or [[prebiotics]] (substances consumed to promote the growth of probiotic microorganisms). <ref>"Probiotics and prebiotics: can regulating the activities of intestinal bacteria benefit health?"  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115424/</ref><ref name=Tannockpro3>{{cite book | author = Tannock GW (editor). | title = Probiotics and Prebiotics: Scientific Aspects | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/pro3 | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/pro3   isbn = 978-1-904455-01-1]}}</ref> The importance of bacteria to human health is only beginning to be investigated, a field that is certain to expand in light of recent discoveries that, in humans, bacterial cells outnumber somatic cells by a factor of 10 to one. <ref>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-humans-carry-more-bacterial-cells-than-human-ones</ref>

Recent research has suggested that microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of [[cancer]].  Various strains of non-pathogenic [[Clostridium|clostridia]] can infiltrate and replicate within solid tumors. Clostridial vectors can be safely administered and their potential to deliver therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models.<ref name= Mengesha>{{cite book |author= Mengesha et al.|year=2009|chapter=Clostridia in Anti-tumor Therapy |title=Clostridia: Molecular Biology in the Post-genomic Era|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn =  978-1-904455-38-7 }}</ref>

<!-- These traits allowed Joshua and Esther Lederberg to devise an elegant experiment in [[1951]] demonstrating that [[adaptive mutation]]s arise from [[preadaptation]] rather than [[directed mutation]]. For this purpose, they invented [[replica plating]], which allowed them to transfer numerous [[colony (biology)|bacterial colonies]] from their specific locations on one [[agar]]-filled [[petri dish]] to analogous locations on several other petri dishes. After replicating a plate of ''E. coli'', they exposed each of the new plates to a [[bacteriophage]] (also called phage). They observed that phage-resistant colonies were present at analogous locations on each of the plates, allowing them to conclude that the phage resistance trait had existed in the original colony, which had never been exposed to phage, instead of arising after the bacteria had been exposed to the virus.  <!-- This was on the page before I modified it to read more like a general description of the field of microbiology, but it just didn't seem to make sense with the rest of the page the way I wrote it. I didn't want to just throw it out, but I don't know what to do with it now! Any suggestions? -->

==History==
===Ancient===
The existence of microorganisms was hypothesized for many centuries before their actual discovery. The existence of unseen microbiological life was postulated by [[Jainism]] which is based on [[Mahavira]]’s teachings as early as 6th century BCE.<ref>Mahavira is dated 599 BC - 527 BC. See. {{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul | coauthors =John Hinnels ed. | title =The Jain | publisher =Routledge | year =2002 | location =London | isbn =0-415-26606-8 }} p. 24</ref>  Paul Dundas notes that Mahavira asserted existence of unseen microbiological creatures living in earth, water, air and fire.<ref>Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 88</ref> [[Jain scriptures]] also describe [[nigoda]]s which are sub-microscopic creatures living in large clusters and having a very short life and are said to pervade each and every part of the universe, even in tissues of plants and flesh of animals.<ref>*{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }}  p. 109</ref> The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] made references to microbes when he warned against locating a homestead in the vicinity of swamps "because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there by cause serious diseases."<ref>''Varro on Agriculture'' 1, xii Loeb.</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1546 [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] proposed that [[epidemic]] [[diseases]] were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or vehicle transmission.<ref>Fracastoro, Girolamo (1546), ''De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis'' transl. Wilmer Cave Wright (1930). New York: G.P. Putnam's</ref>

However, early claims about the existence of microorganisms were speculative, and not based on microscopic observation. Actual observation and discovery of microbes had to await the invention of the [[microscope]] in the 17th century.

===Modern===
[[File:Anton van Leeuwenhoek.png|thumb|right|[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], is considered to be the one of the first to observe microorganisms using a microscope.]]

In 1676, [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] observed [[bacteria]] and other microorganisms, using a single-lens microscope of his own design.<ref name=Brock /> While Van Leeuwenhoek is often cited as the first to observe microbes, [[Robert Hooke]] made the first recorded microscopic observation, of the fruiting bodies of [[mold]]s, in 1665.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gest H |title=The remarkable vision of Robert Hooke (1635-1703): first observer of the microbial world |journal=Perspect. Biol. Med. |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=266–72 |year=2005 |pmid=15834198 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2005.0053}}</ref> The first observation of microbes using a microscope is generally credited to the Dutch draper and haberdasher, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who lived for most of his life in Delft, Holland. It has, however, been suggested that a Jesuit priest called [[Athanasius Kircher]] was the first to observe micro-organisms.<ref name=pmid12964250>{{cite journal |last1=Wainwright |first1=Milton |title=Advances in Applied Microbiology Volume 52 |volume=52 |pages=333–55 |year=2003 |pmid=12964250 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2164(03)01013-X |chapter=An Alternative View of the Early History of Microbiology |series=Advances in Applied Microbiology |isbn=978-0-12-002654-8 |journal=Advances in applied microbiology}}</ref> He was among the first to design magic lanterns for projection purposes, so he must have been well acquainted with the properties of lenses.<ref name=pmid12964250/> One of his books contains a chapter in Latin, which reads in translation – ‘Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by Microscope. Here, he wrote ‘who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms.’ He also noted that putrid material is full of innumerable creeping animalcule. These observations antedate Robert Hooke’s Micrographia by nearly 20 years and were published some 29 years before van Leeuwenhoek saw protozoa and 37 years before he described having seen bacteria.<ref name=pmid12964250/>
[[File:Tableau Louis Pasteur.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Innovative [[laboratory glassware]] and experimental methods developed by [[Louis Pasteur]] and other biologists contributed to the young field of bacteriology in the late 19th century.]]
The field of [[bacteriology]] (later a subdiscipline of microbiology) was founded in the 19th century by [[Ferdinand Cohn]], a botanist whose studies on [[algae]] and [[Phototroph|photosynthetic bacteria]] led him to describe several bacteria including ''[[Bacillus]]'' and ''[[Beggiatoa]]''. Cohn was also the first to formulate a scheme for the [[taxonomic classification]] of bacteria and discover spores.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drews G |title=Ferdinand Cohn, among the Founder of Microbiology |journal=ASM News |volume=65 |issue=8 |page=547 |year=1999}}</ref> [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Robert Koch]] were contemporaries of Cohn’s and are often considered to be the father of microbiology<ref name=pmid12964250/> and [[medical microbiology]], respectively.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> Pasteur is most famous for his series of experiments designed to disprove the then widely held [[theory of spontaneous generation]], thereby solidifying microbiology’s identity as a biological science.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bordenave G |title=Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=553–60 |year=2003 |pmid=12758285 |doi=10.1016/S1286-4579(03)00075-3}}</ref>  Pasteur also designed methods for food preservation ([[pasteurization]]) and vaccines against several diseases such as [[anthrax]], fowl cholera and [[rabies]].<ref name=Brock /> Koch is best known for his contributions to the [[germ theory of disease]], proving that specific diseases were caused by specific pathogenic micro-organisms. He developed a series of criteria that have become known as the [[Koch's postulates]].  Koch was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in [[pure culture]] resulting in his description of several novel bacteria including ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the causative agent of [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=Brock />

While Pasteur and Koch are often considered the founders of microbiology, their work did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of their exclusive focus on micro-organisms having direct medical relevance.  It was not until the late 19th century and the work of [[Martinus Beijerinck]] and [[Sergei Winogradsky]], the founders of '''general microbiology''' (an older term encompassing aspects of microbial physiology, diversity and ecology), that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed.<ref name=Brock />  Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of [[virus]]es and the development of [[enrichment culture]]<!-- should this be [[Growth medium]] or [[Microbiological culture]] ? --> techniques.<ref>{{cite web | author = Johnson J | title = Martinus Willem Beijerinck | work = APSnet| publisher = American Phytopathological Society | url = http://www.apsnet.org/Education/feature/TMV/intro.html | year = 2001 |origyear = 1998 | accessdate = May 2, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  While his work on the [[Tobacco Mosaic Virus]] established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing  that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation of a wide range of microbes with wildly different physiologies.  Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of [[chemolithotrophy]] and to thereby reveal the essential role played by micro-organisms in geochemical processes.<ref>{{cite book | author = Paustian T, Roberts G | chapter = Beijerinck and Winogradsky Initiate the Field of Environmental Microbiology | title = Through the Microscope: A Look at All Things Small | page = §&nbsp;1–14 | nopp = y | edition = 3rd | year = 2009 | publisher = Textbook Consortia  | chapterurl = http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book&func=displayarticle&art_id=32| accessdate = May 2, 2010}}</ref> He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both [[nitrifying bacteria|nitrifying]] and [[nitrogen-fixing bacteria]].<ref name=Brock /> French-Canadian microbiologist [[Felix d'Herelle]] co-discovered [[bacteriophage]]s and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.<ref name =Keen>{{cite journal |author=Keen EC |title=Felix d’Herelle and Our Microbial Future |journal=Future Microbiology |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=1337–1339 |year=2012 |pmid=23231482|doi=10.2217/fmb.12.115}}</ref>
