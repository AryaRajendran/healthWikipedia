'''Posturography''' is a general term that covers all the techniques used to quantify postural control in upright stance in either static or dynamic conditions. Among them, '''Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP)''', also called '''test of balance (TOB)''', is a [[non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] specialized clinical assessment technique used to quantify the [[central nervous system]] adaptive mechanisms ([[sensory system|sensory]], [[motor system|motor]] and central) involved in the control of [[Human position|posture]] and balance, both in normal (such as in [[physical education]] and sports training) and abnormal conditions (particularly in the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[balance disorder]]s and in [[physical therapy]] and postural re-education). Due to the complex interactions among sensory, motor, and central processes involved in posture and balance, CDP requires different [[Clinical trial protocol|protocol]]s in order to differentiate among the many defects and impairments which may affect the patient's posture control system. Thus, CDP challenges it by using several combinations of visual and support surface stimuli and parameters.

Clinical applications for CDP were first described by L.M. Nashner in 1982, and the first commercially available testing system was developed in 1986, when NeuroCom International, Inc., launched the EquiTest system.

==How it works==
Static posturography is carried out by placing the patient in a standing posture on a fixed instrumented platform  ([[forceplate]]) connected to sensitive detectors (force and movement [[transducer]]s), which are able to detect the tiny oscillations of the body.
Dynamic posturography differentiates from static posturography generally by using a special apparatus with a movable horizontal platform.  As the patient makes small movements, they transmit in [[Real-time computing|real time]] to a [[computer]]. The computer is also used to command [[electric motor]]s which can move the forceplate in the horizontal direction (translation) as well as to incline it (rotations). Thus, the posturography test protocols generate a sequence of standardized motions in the support platform in order to desequilibrate the patient's posture in an orderly and reproducible way. The platform is contained within an enclosure which can also be used to generate apparent visual surround motions. These stimuli are calibrated relative to the patient's height and weight. A special computer software integrates all this and produces detailed graphics and reports which can then be compared with normal ranges.

==Components of Balance==
[[Center of gravity|Center of gravity (COG)]] is an important component of balance and should be assessed when evaluating someoneâ€™s posture. COG is often measured with COP because COG is hard to quantify. According to Lafage et al. (2008) the COG should be located at the midpoint of the base of support if an individual has ideal posture. COP excursion and velocity are indicators of control over COG and are key factors for identifying proper posture and the ability to maintain balance. COP excursion is defined by Collins & De Luca (1992) as the Euclidean*LINK* displacement in the anterior/posterior and medial/lateral directions within the base of support (perimeter around the feet). <ref>{{Citation

==Types of Tests==
The test protocols usually include a Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Limits of Stability Test (LOS), a Motor Control Test (MCT) and an Adaptation Test (ADT). The SOT test was developed by Nashner and is a computerized system that is made up of dual movable force plates and movable visual screen (EquiTest). <ref>{{Citation

The limits of stability (LOS) is defined as the distance outside the base of support that can be traveled before a loss of balance occurs. The LOS test is frequently used to quantify this distance and has been sugested as a hybrid between static and dynamic balance assessment. <ref>{{Citation

The patient begins with their COP directly in the center of the targets (displayed as a figure as a computerized person). At the onset of the test, the patient attempts to lean in the direction of the indicated perimeter target, without lifting their feet, and hold there until the test is complete. 

According to necessity of the diagnostic workup, CDP can be combined with other techniques, such as [[electronystagmography]] (ENG) and [[electromyography]].

The main indications for CDP are [[dizziness]] and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and postural imbalances ([[balance disorder]]s).
