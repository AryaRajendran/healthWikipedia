'''Joseph Louis Melnick''' (October 9, 1914 &ndash; January 7, 2001) was an American [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] who performed breakthrough research on the spread of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], with ''[[The New York Times]]'' calling him "a founder of modern [[virology]]".

==Early life and education==
Melnick was born on October 9, 1914, in [[Boston]] and moved with his family to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], when he was seven years old. He earned his undergraduate degree from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1936 and was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physiological chemistry from [[Yale University]]. He became a member of the Yale faculty under Dr. [[John R. Paul]], and was named a professor of epidemiology in 1954.<ref name=NYTObit/>

==Polio research==
Research by Melnick found that the most common way that polio was spread was by fecal contamination, usually by soiled hands, and that the [[poliovirus]] could survive for extended periods in sewage.<ref name=NYTObit/> Other viruses, such as [[hepatitis]], were also found in sewage, leading to improved purification standards. Higher levels of the polio virus were found in sewage during the summer, at the same time of year that the outbreaks of the disease were at their most severe, which John R. Paul observed "spoke loudly in favor of the idea that polio viruses circulate widely in the population and environment only during epidemic seasons". Together with Dr. [[Dorothy Horstmann]], Melnick published the results of a study that showed that polio could be transmitted by flies, though they were not the primary vector for the disease. He was among the first to discover that the polio virus belonged to a larger class now known as the [[enterovirus]]es &mdash; a form of virus that could enter the [[central nervous system]] under certain conditions &mdash; and was among those who discovered that polio and other enteroviruses only rarely invade the central nervous system.<ref name=NYTObit>Altman, Lawrence K.

Accessed September 27, 2010.</ref>

==Chief virologist==
Melnick was chosen as the chief virologist at the division of biological standards at the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1957. He was hired by the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] in 1958 as the first head of the school's department of virology and epidemiology. Research he published in 1960 showed that the form of the [[attenuated vaccine]] used in the [[Polio vaccine#Oral vaccine|oral polio vaccine]] developed by Dr. [[Albert Sabin]] was less harmful to the nervous system than comparable vaccines. A study he performed found that polio vaccine could be stored for long periods by using [[magnesium chloride]] as a preservative, eliminating the need for refrigeration. Melnick was named as dean of graduate sciences at Baylor in 1968, a position he held until 1991. Together with heart surgeon [[Michael E. DeBakey]], Melnick investigated the possible effects that [[cytomegalovirus]] might have on [[coronary artery disease]]s.<ref name=NYTObit/>

Research performed by Melnick with a team at Baylor and published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968 found evidence that implicated viruses, including [[herpes simplex virus]], as a cause of some forms of [[cervical cancer]].<ref>via ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

A regimen for the treatment of a polio outbreak in the 1980s in the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] by a joint effort of Israeli and Palestinian health officials used a combination of live attenuated and inactivated forms of the polio vaccine as recommended by Melnick and Dr. [[Natan Goldblum]], as those receiving as many as four doses of the oral polio vaccine alone were still susceptible to polio.<ref>Tulchinsky, Theodore.

Accessed September 27, 2010.</ref> 

An editor of multiple scientific journals, Melnick wrote and edited the section on virology in a standard text on [[microbiology]].<ref name=NYTObit/> Melnick was recognized by the [[Sabin Vaccine Institute]] in 1996 with its [[Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal]], recognizing his pioneering research in the study of polio and the more than 100 virologists he trained during his career.<ref>[http://www.sabin.org/updates-events/events/gold-medal-awards Gold Medal Award], [[Sabin Vaccine Institute]]. Accessed September 27, 2010.</ref>

Melnick died at age 86 on January 7, 2001, in [[Houston]], as a result of complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He was survived by his wife, Dr. Matilda Benyesh-Melnick, as well as by a daughter and a granddaughter.<ref name=NYTObit/>
