'''Glasses''', also known as '''eyeglasses''' (formal) or '''spectacles''', are frames bearing [[lens (optics)|lenses]] worn in front of the [[Human eye|eye]]s. They are normally used for [[Corrective lens | vision correction]] or [[eye protection]]. Safety glasses are a kind of [[eye protection]] against flying debris or against visible and near visible [[light]] or [[radiation]]. [[Sunglasses]] allow better vision in bright daylight, and may [[UV Coating|protect against damage]] from high levels of [[ultraviolet light]].  Other types of glasses may be used for viewing visual information (such as [[stereoscopy]]) or simply just for aesthetic or fashion purposes.

Historical types of glasses include the ''[[pince-nez]]'', [[monocle]], [[lorgnette]], and scissor or [[scissors-glasses]].

Modern glasses are typically supported by pads on the bridge of the [[human nose|nose]] and by '''temple arms''' (sides) placed over the [[ear]]s.  [[CR-39]] lenses are the most common plastic lenses due to their low weight, high scratch resistance, low [[Dispersion (optics)| dispersion]], and low transparency to ultraviolet and infrared radiation.{{Citation needed| reason= There are multiple statements in this sentence without any proof.|date=December 2011}} [[Polycarbonate]] and Trivex lenses are the lightest and most shatter-resistant, making them the best for impact protection.<ref name="polycarb" />

Though modern frames can be both lightweight and flexible, and new lens materials and [[optical coating]]s are resistant to breakage and scratching, glasses can pose problems during rigorous sports. Scraping, fracturing, or breakage of the lenses can require repair by a Licensed Optician professional.

[[File:El Greco 048.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of cardinal Fernando Niño de Guevara by [[El Greco]] circa 1600 shows spectacles with temples passing over the ears]]
The earliest historical reference to [[magnification]] dates back to [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs | hieroglyphs]] in the 5th century BC, which depict "simple glass meniscal [[Lens (optics) | lenses]]". The earliest written record of magnification dates back to the 1st century AD, when [[Seneca the Younger]], a tutor of Emperor [[Nero]] of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], wrote: "Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or glass filled with water".<ref name=Kriss>{{Cite journal|last1= Kriss|first1= Timothy C |last2= Kriss|first2 = Vesna Martich | title=History of the Operating Microscope: From Magnifying Glass to Microneurosurgery|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=42|issue=4|pages=899–907|date=April 1998|doi = 10.1097/00006123-199804000-00116 |pmid= 9574655}}</ref> Nero (reigned 54–68 AD) is also said to have watched the [[gladiator| gladiatorial games]] using an [[emerald]] as a corrective lens.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+37.16 |accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

The use of a [[Lens (optics)|convex lens]] to form a magnified image is discussed in [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s  ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). Its [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation into Latin]] from Arabic in the 12th century was instrumental to the invention of eyeglasses in 13th century [[Italy]].<ref name=Kriss/>{{verify source|date=June 2011}}

[[Englishman]] [[Robert Grosseteste]]'s treatise ''De iride'' ("On the Rainbow"), written between 1220 and 1235, mentions using optics to "read the smallest letters at incredible distances".  A few years later, [[Roger Bacon]] is also known to have written on the magnifying properties of lenses in 1262.<ref>{{cite web |title=...Optics Highlights: II.

[[Sunglasses]], in the form of flat panes of [[smoky quartz]], were used in [[China]] in the 12th century.{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | Chinese judges wore dark glasses to hide their facial expressions during court proceedings{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = 121}}.}}  Similarly, the [[Inuit]] have used [[Inuit snow goggles| snow goggles]] for eye protection.

=== Invention of eyeglasses ===
[[File:Conrad von Soest, 'Brillenapostel' (1403).jpg|thumb|left|The 'Glasses Apostle' by [[Conrad von Soest]] (1403)]]
The first eyeglasses were made in Italy at about 1286, according to a sermon delivered on February 23, 1306 by the Dominican friar [[Jordan of Pisa| Giordano da Pisa]] (ca. 1255–1311): "It is not yet twenty years since there was found the art of making eyeglasses, which make for good vision …  And it is so short a time that this new art, never before extant, was discovered …  I saw the one who first discovered and practiced it, and I talked to him."{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false  5]}}  Giordano's colleague Friar [[Alessandro della Spina]] of Pisa (d. 1313) was soon making eyeglasses. The ''Ancient Chronicle of the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine in Pisa'' records: "Eyeglasses, having first been made by someone else, who was unwilling to share them, he [Spina] made them and shared them with everyone with a cheerful and willing heart."{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = 6}}  By 1301, there were guild regulations in Venice governing the sale of eyeglasses.{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = 9}}

Although there have been claims that [[Salvino degli Armati]] of Florence invented eyeglasses, these claims have been exposed as hoaxes.<ref>{{Citation | first = Edward | last = Rosen | year = 1956 | title = The invention of eyeglasses | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 11 | pages = 13–46 (part 1), 183–218 (part 2)}}.</ref>{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | pp = [http://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false  13-18]}}  Furthermore, although there have been claims that [[Marco Polo]] encountered eyeglasses during his travels in China in the 13th century, no such statement appears in his accounts.{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=oJ9nayZZ2oEC&pg=119#v=onepage&q&f=false  119, footnote c]}}<ref>{{Citation | first = Julius | last = Hirschberg | contribution = Geschichte der Augenheilkunde | trans_contribution = History of Ophthamology | page = 265 | editor1-first = Alfred K | editor1-last = Graef | editor2-first = Theodor | editor2-last = Saemisch | title = Handbuch der gesamten Augenheilkunde | trans_title = Handbook of all ophthalmology | place = Leipzig, [[Germany | DE]] | publisher = Wilhelm Engelmann | year = 1911 | volume = 13}}.</ref> Indeed, the earliest mentions of eyeglasses in China occur in the 15th century and those Chinese sources state that eyeglasses were imported.{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = 119}}

[[File:Medieval Spectacles.jpg|thumb|right|Seated apostle holding lenses in position for reading. Detail from ''[[Death of the Virgin]]'', by the [[Master of Heiligenkreuz]], ca. 1400–30 ([[Getty Center]]).]]
The earliest pictorial evidence for the use of eyeglasses is [[Tommaso da Modena]]'s 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Provence reading in a [[scriptorium]]. Another early example would be a depiction of eyeglasses found north of the [[Alps]] in an altarpiece of the church of [[Bad Wildungen]], [[Germany]], in 1403.

These early spectacles had [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|convex lenses]] that could correct both [[hyperopia]] (farsightedness), and the [[presbyopia]] that commonly develops as a symptom of [[aging]].  It was not until 1604 that [[Johannes Kepler]] published the first correct explanation as to why convex and concave lenses could correct presbyopia and myopia.{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | In his treatise ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena'' [Emendations (or Supplement) to Witelo] (1604), Kepler explained how eyeglass lenses compensate for the distortions that are caused by presbyopia or myopia, so that the image is once again properly focused on the retina.{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = 244}}<ref>{{Citation | first = Vasco | last = Ronchi | coauthors = Edward Rosen, transl | title = Optics: The Science of Vision | place = Mineola, [[New York | NY]] | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1991 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Ht695-SFJYoC&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = 45–46}}.</ref>}}

===Later developments===
[[File:Don francisco de quevedo-villegas.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of [[Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas]], 1580–1645]]
The [[United States|American]] scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]], who suffered from both [[myopia]] and [[presbyopia]], invented bifocals. Serious historians have from time to time produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between [[George Whatley]] and [[John Fenno]], editor of ''[[The Gazette of the United States]]'', suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 'Inventor' of Bifocals?|publisher=The College of Optometrists | url =http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm}}</ref>

The first lenses for correcting [[Astigmatism (eye)|Astigmatism]] were constructed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] astronomer [[George Airy]] in 1825.{{cn|date=April 2012}}

Over time, the construction of spectacle frames also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (''pince-nez''). [[Girolamo Savonarola]] suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a [[hat]]. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed some time before 1727, possibly by the British optician [[Edward Scarlett]]. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as "[[scissors-glasses]]" and [[lorgnette]]s were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century.

In the early 20th century, [[Moritz von Rohr]] at [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] (with the assistance of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.zeiss.com/C12567A100537AB9/Contents-Frame/6B49EEA709EAE719C1256919003DAE2B |title=Eyeglass Lenses and Visual Aids from Industrial Production |publisher= Zeiss | accessdate =2007-09-02}}</ref>), developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years.

Despite the increasing popularity of [[contact lenses]] and [[laser]] [[Refractive surgery|corrective eye surgery]], glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, it is now possible to purchase frames made of special [[memory metal]] alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offers dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as [[titanium]] alloys, which were not available in the earlier times.

==Types==
===Corrective===
{{Main|Corrective lens|Pinhole glasses|Refractive error}}
[[File:Refraction through glasses 090306.jpg|thumb|right|[[Seattle]] [[skyline]] as seen through a corrective lens, showing the effect of [[refraction]]]]
Corrective lenses are used to correct [[refractive error]]s of the eye by modifying the effective focal length of the lens in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as [[myopia | nearsightedness (myopia)]], [[hypermetropia | farsightedness (Hypermetropia)]] or [[Astigmatism (eye)| astigmatism]]. Another common condition in older patients is [[presbyopia]], which is caused by the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to [[accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye).

The power of a lens is generally measured in [[diopter]]s. Glasses correcting for myopia will have negative diopter strengths, and glasses correcting for hypermetropia will have positive diopter strengths. Glasses correcting for astigmatism require two different strengths placed at right angles in the same lens.  [[Eyeglass prescription|Prescription lenses]], made to conform to the prescription of an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]], are used to make prescription glasses, which are then verified correct using a professional [[lensmeter]].

[[Pinhole glasses]] are a type of corrective glasses that do not use a lens and are claimed to help correct the eye's refractive error without introducing the image distortion of traditional lens-based glasses. Pinhole glasses do not actually refract the light or change the focal length, they operate by reducing the size of the blur circles in the retinal images. In blurry vision, every point on the object corresponds with a blur circle in the image. By reducing the size of the blur circles, they reduce the overlap of the blur circles in the image, clarifying the vision somewhat. They do not heal the eye of refractive error, as sometimes claimed, and vision with pinhole glasses, although clearer than without them, is not as clear as with conventional lenses.

Correcting one's vision is effected by use of lenses to move the focal point on the [[retina]] accordingly with one's particular needs. The depth of the curve, the thickness of the lens, and the precise shape of the lens can all be used to change the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]].{{fact|date=February 2013}}

[[File:Mo Enagi.jpg|thumb|Man wearing modern prescription glasses]]
Eyeglasses can normally correct and compensate for four types of vision deficiencies:
* Myopia is a vision disorder that causes far objects to appear blurred but near objects are seen clearly.<ref name="Eyeglasses Prescription Eyeglasses">{{cite web|url = http://www.eyeglassdirect.com/ |title= Eyeglasses direct | accessdate= 2010-06-14}}</ref> Individuals suffering from myopia are prescribed eyeglasses with [[Concave lens#Types of simple lenses |concave lenses]], which compensate for the refraction error by moving the image of the distant objects that cannot be seen clearly backward onto the retina.
* Correcting hypermetropia is normally done with eyeglasses with [[Convex lens#Types of simple lenses| convex lenses]]. With this disorder, the patients can see distant objects clearly but they have trouble with seeing objects that are close to them. Eyeglasses with convex lenses compensate for the refraction errors by moving the image of a distant object forward onto the retina.<ref name ="Eyeglasses Prescription Eyeglasses"/>
* Astigmatism is typically corrected with a [[cylindrical lens]]. This disorder is caused by a non-uniform curvature in the refractive surfaces of the eye, which leads to an abnormality in focusing the [[light rays]] on the retina. As a result, a part of the light rays are focused on the retina and the other part is focused behind it or in front of it.
* [[Presbyopia]] is a condition where the eye exhibits a progressively diminished ability to focus on near objects with age. It is  more frequent in people over 40 years old and it is corrected with convex lenses. These patients need reading or [[bifocals|bifocal]] eyeglasses.

Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the [[life quality]] of the patient as they are helpful in both correcting vision disorders and reducing problems that appear when such lenses are needed, such as [[headaches]] or squinting. A small amount of time is needed to adapt to the new lenses, usually 1–2 weeks.

Corrective lenses can also be added to work masks or eyeglasses used in [[sports]].

Eyeglass lenses are commonly made from [[plastic]], including [[CR-39]] and [[polycarbonate]]. These materials reduce the danger of breakage and weigh less than glass lenses. Some plastics also have more advantageous optical properties than glass, such as better transmission of [[visible light]] and greater absorption of [[ultraviolet light]].<ref name= "polycarb">{{cite web | last = DeFranco | first =Liz |work=All About Vision |url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/polycarb.htm |title= Polycarbonate Lenses: Tough as Nails |month= April | year= 2007 |accessdate = 2007-09-01}}</ref> Some plastics have a greater [[index of refraction]] than most types of glass; this is useful in the making of corrective lenses shaped to correct various [[List of eye diseases and disorders|vision abnormalities]] such as [[myopia]], allowing thinner lenses for a given [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]].

Scratch-resistant coatings can be applied to most plastic lenses giving them similar scratch resistance to glass. [[Hydrophobic]] coatings designed to ease cleaning are also available, as are [[anti-reflective coating]]s intended to reduce glare, improve night vision and make the wearer's eyes more visible.<ref name="Coatings">{{cite web |last=DeFranco |first= Liz |work= All About Vision | url = http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/coatings.htm |title=Do You Need Lens Coatings? |month=May | year=2006 |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

===Safety===
{{See also|Eye protection}}
Safety glasses are usually made with shatter-resistant plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris. Although safety lenses may be constructed from a variety of materials of various impact resistance, certain standards suggest that they maintain a minimum 1&nbsp;millimeter thickness at the thinnest point, regardless of material. Safety glasses can vary in the level of protection they provide. For example, those used in medicine may be expected to protect against blood splatter while safety glasses in a factory might have stronger lenses and a stronger frame with additional shields at the temples to protect from sawdust, flying wood, or metal. The lenses of safety glasses can also be shaped for correction.

[[File:SafetyGlassesShield.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eye protection|Safety glasses]] with side shields]]
The American National Standards Institute has established standard ANSI Z87.1<ref>{{Citation | url = http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ANSI+Z87%2E1%2D2003 | titre = Doc | type = store | contribution = Z87.1 | publisher = ANSI | place = [[United States of America | US]]}}.</ref> for safety glasses in the United States, and similar standards have been established elsewhere.

OSHA<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9778 | title = OSHA}}.</ref> provides guidance on the type of safety eyewear that should be used for a particular application.

Some safety glasses are designed to fit over corrective glasses or sunglasses. They may provide less eye protection than [[goggles]] or other forms of eye protection, but their light weight increases the likelihood that they will actually be used. Modern safety glasses tend to be given a more stylish design in order to encourage their use.  Corrective glasses with plastic lenses can be used in place of safety glasses in many environments; this is one advantage that they have over [[contact lens]]es.

There are also safety glasses for [[welding]], which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash.

Worker safety eyewear is available in various lens colors and/or with coatings to protect or enable eyesight in different lighting conditions, particularly when outdoors.

Nylon frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties.  They are able to bend slightly and return to their original shape instead of breaking when pressure is applied to them.  Nylon frames can become very brittle with age and they can be difficult to adjust.

Safety lenses are usually made of [[polycarbonate]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allaboutvision.com/askdoc/eye-safety.htm| title = Safety Glasses and Eye Safety | type = Q&A| work = Ask Doc | publisher = All about glasshes |accessdate= 2010-06-14}}</ref>  Polycarbonate and Trivex lenses are the lightest and most shatter-resistant, making them the best for impact protection,<ref name ="polycarb" /> though polycarbonate offers poor optics due to high dispersion, having a low [[Abbe number]] of 31. Safety glasses are also available in prescription form for those persons who need corrective lenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyesafety.4ursafety.com/eye-safety-articles.html#choosing| title=Choosing and Using Eye Protection| work = Eye safety | publisher = For your safety |accessdate= 2010-06-14}}</ref> Depending on the particular area in which the individuals work, they may be required to wear side protectors additionally to safety eyeglasses.

In order to comply with the [[ANSI]] Z87.1 requirements, safety eyeglasses must pass the high velocity and high mass tests. Also, the lenses of protective goggles, faceshield windows and welding filters cannot be thinner than 3&nbsp;mm, excepting high-impact lenses meant to be installed in prescription frames, which cannot be thinner than 2&nbsp;mm.

===Sunglasses===
{{Main|Sunglasses}}
[[File:Woman wearing sunglasses.jpg|thumb|right|Woman wearing [[sunglasses]]]]
Sunglasses may be made with either prescription or non-prescription lenses that are darkened to provide protection against bright [[visible light]] and, possibly, [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. [[Photochromic lens]]es, which are [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]], darken when struck by UV light.

Light [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] is an added feature that can be applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed, or instrument readings on [[liquid crystal displays]] may be blocked.

Gray or gray-green lenses produce the most natural appearance of colors. Yellow lenses increase color contrast and improve depth perception. They are worn by people driving at dusk, but are detrimental to vision at night. Any tint further reduces incoming light to the retina, and yellow tints also reduce glare-recovery times for night drivers.<ref>{{cite web |title= Dangerous Misconceptions of Night-Driving Lenses |publisher=Laramy K Optical |url=http://www.laramyk.com/ | month =April | year = 2009}}</ref> Brown lenses are common among golfers, but cause color distortion. Blue, purple, and intense green lenses provide less vision enhancement, and are mainly cosmetic.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Some sunglasses with interchangeable lenses have optional clear lenses to protect the eyes during low light or night time activities and a colored lens with UV protection for times where sun protection is needed.

Sunglasses are often worn just for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include teashades and [[Mirrorshades (fashion) | mirrorshades]]. Many [[blindness|blind]] people wear opaque glasses to hide their eyes for aesthetic reasons.

===3D glasses===
{{Main|Stereoscopy#3D viewers}}
The [[Stereoscopy|illusion of three dimensions]] on a two dimensional surface can be created by providing each eye with different visual information. 3D glasses create the illusion of three dimensions by filtering out the light not intended for that eye, resulting in each eye receiving a different image. The traditional [[anaglyph 3D]] glasses have one red lens and one blue or cyan lens or similar color filters.

A [[polarized 3D system]] on the other hand uses [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] filters, with each lens using opposite polarization, with the two images required for stereo vision polarized the same way and a silver screen so that polarization is preserved. Circular polarization is used so the image separation is maintained even if the viewer tilts their head (although the depth effect will suffer as the head tilt increases), which would not be possible with the more usual linear polarizers. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce a dull black-and-white picture with red and blue fringes. 

An [[active shutter 3D system]] uses electronic [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]]s, while [[virtual reality]] glasses and helmets have separate video screens for each eye, such as [[Head-mounted display]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ocbmedia.com/news/56/Technologies-for-Consumer-3D-Anatomical-Interactivity/| title= Technologies for Consumer 3D Anatomical Interactivity | date = 1 October 2008| publisher = OCB Media| accessdate = 2009-01-26}}</ref> The first three types have been distributed to audiences at [[3D film|3D movies]], while video glasses are used by a single person.

===Ready-made reading glasses===
Reading glasses come in two main styles: full frames, in which the entire lens is made in the reading prescription, and half-eyes, the smaller "Ben Franklin" style glasses that sit lower down on the [[human nose| nose]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allaboutvision.com/over40/readers.htm| work = Over 40 | publisher = All about vision | title = Reading Glasses | accessdate= 2010-06-14}}</ref> Ready made reading glasses are available in strengths ranging from 1.00 to 3.50
Magnifying lenses or generic spectacles that are used to treat mild [[presbyopia]] and [[hyperopia]] can be bought off the shelf. Although such glasses are generally considered safe, an individual prescription, as determined by an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] and made by a qualified [[optician]], usually results in better visual correction and fewer headaches & visual discomfort. There have also been many cases where people have delayed having a proper eye examinaton with an optometrist or ophthalmologist, preferring to purchase off the shelf glasses, who have put their sight at risk from conditions such as [[Macular degeneration|AMD]], [[glaucoma]] and complications from [[diabetes]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It is important to stress off the shelf readers are not a replacement for regular eye examinations.

[[File:Reading glasses.jpg|thumb|right|Typical pair of reading glasses]]
Full reading glasses are more suitable for people who only need them for close-up reading while half-eye reading glasses can be used to read at smaller or larger distances.  The reading glasses are most of the time needed by people who have never worn glasses.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

Although specialists recommend individuals who need to wear eyeglasses have them custom-made according to their needs, most people prefer buying them at a [[pharmacy]] or [[department store]]. This type of eyeglass-shopping became very popular in the 1990s when it was estimated that over 30 million pairs were sold per year. These reading glasses are not as expensive as custom-made glasses and can be purchased off the shelf in a wide variety of colors and designs, suitable for different tastes.{{Cn|date=March 2013}}

One downside of ready-made eyeglasses is that their prescription is the same for each eye. The optical center of each lens is also the same. Yet, most individuals who need reading glasses need different prescriptions in each eye. Wearing ready-made eyeglasses can result in headaches, [[eyestrain]] or [[nausea]], and these "side effects" increase with the extent of the prescriptions' mismatch. Another disadvantage is that they usually cannot be found with spherical corrections greater than three or four [[dioptre]]s, and of course are never corrected for astigmatism.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

Sometimes people with broken frames get ready-made glasses with the idea of putting their old lenses into the new frames. While this might work, there are two problems with the idea. There is no standard for lens shapes, so without resorting to extreme fitting methods like glue, it is unlikely that the right fitting can be found. Furthermore the ready-mades themselves might have their existing lenses glued in place making difficult to remove the lenses.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

===Bifocals, trifocals, and progressive lenses===
As people age, their ability to focus is lessened and many decide to use multiple-focus lenses, which can be [[Bifocals|bifocal]] or even [[Trifocal lenses|trifocal]], to cover all the situations in which they use their sight. Traditional multifocal lenses have two or three distinct horizontal viewing areas, each requiring a conscious effort of refocusing. Some modern multifocal lenses, such as [[progressive lens]]es (known as "no-line bifocals"), give a smooth transition between these different focal points, unnoticeable by most wearers, while other glasses have lenses specifically intended for use with computer monitors at a fixed distance. People may have several pairs of glasses, one for each task or distance, with specific glasses for reading, computer use, television watching, and writing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Extreme magnification (bioptics)===
A form of glasses with extreme magnification to improve the distance vision of those with severe eyesight impairment, especially people with [[albinism]], are known as ''[[Bioptics (device) |bioptics]]'' or a ''bioptic telescope''. They may take the form of self-contained glasses that resemble [[goggles]] or [[binoculars]], or may be attached to existing glasses.

For most of their history, eyeglasses were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen (as those in religious vocation were the most likely to be literate and therefore the most likely to need reading glasses), elderly, or physically weak and passive.<ref name = mount>{{Citation | url = http://www.seikoeyewear.com/CE/CECourse.cfm?ceID=6 | title = Eyewear | contribution = Understanding Three-Piece Mounting | publisher = Seiko}}.</ref><ref name = har>{{Citation | url = http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:ZFCwrjE3p_IJ:www.haroldlloyd.us/index2.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D28+harold+lloyd+glasses&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESj_MCop6_2_lT0-IZxl98FMNlCqvG0K49hJEesJFSUHGeSYJ1JXJjadjDH3wCKD3odO6TDmtBQEeaKRbEONoEtEO56bfmnl8YuqswoBnveM9drSRQyxrwqAKSBZvwEetYF0bP6K&sig=AHIEtbS_WjGJbmXTL_p3fxf9uf474ksuJA | last = Lloyd | first = Annette | title = The Fashion of Harold Lloyd | year = 1996}}.</ref> The stigma began to fall away in the early 1900s when the popular [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian [[Harold Lloyd]] began wearing a pair of [[horn-rimmed glasses]] as "The Glass Character" in his films.<ref name = mount /><ref name=har/>

Since, eyeglasses have become an acceptable fashion item and often act as a key component in individuals' personal image. Musicians [[Buddy Holly]] and [[John Lennon]] became synonymous with the styles of eye-glasses they wore to the point that thick, black horn-rimmed glasses are often called "Buddy Holly glasses" and perfectly round metal eyeglass frames called "John Lennon Glasses." [[United Kingdom|  British]] comedic actor [[Eric Sykes]] was known in the United Kingdom for wearing thick, square, horn-rimmed glasses, which were in fact a sophisticated [[hearing aid]] that alleviated his [[deafness]] by allowing him to "hear" vibrations.<ref name= eric>{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4134965.stm | publisher = BBC | title = News | first = Eric | last = Sykes | contribution = Comedy Great | date = 12-31-2004}}.</ref>  Some celebrities have become so associated with their eyeglasses that they continued to wear them even after taking alternate measures against vision problems: United States Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] and comedian [[Drew Carey]] continued to wear non-prescription glasses after being fitted for contacts and getting [[LASIK|laser eye surgery]], respectively.

Other celebrities have used glasses to differentiate themselves from the characters they play, such as [[Anne Kirkbride]], who wears oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as [[Deirdre Barlow]] on the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', and [[Masaharu Morimoto]], who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a [[chef]] from his stage persona as [[Iron Chef]] [[Japan]]ese.

Recently, many [[NBA]] players wear [[lensless glasses]] with thick plastic frames like [[horn-rimmed glasses]] during [[Post-game show | post-game interviews]], [[geek chic]] that draws comparisons to [[Steve Urkel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0330Drfkk&feature=plcp |title=Whacky NBA Playoff Fashion! |publisher= Google | work = YouTube | accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref><ref name="wsj-nba">{{citation |last= Cacciola |first= Scott |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303822204577466402604980564.html?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_TheA-Hed |title=NBA Finals: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Other Fashion Plates of the NBA Make Specs of Themselves | edition = oline | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref>

In [[superhero]] fiction, eyeglasses have become a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor when they are not in their superhero persona: [[Superman]] is well known for wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as [[Clark Kent]], while [[Wonder Woman]] wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style [[bug-eye glasses]] as [[Diana Prince]].

===Styles===
In the 20th century, eyeglasses came to be considered a component of [[fashion]]; as such, various different styles have come in and out of popularity. Most are still in regular use, albeit with varying degrees of frequency.
