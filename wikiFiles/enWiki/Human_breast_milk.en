'''Human breast milk''' is the [[milk]] produced by the [[breast]]s (or mammary glands) of a [[human]] female for her infant offspring. Milk is the primary source of nutrition for [[newborn]]s before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be [[breastfeeding|breastfed]], either exclusively or in combination with other foods.

==Benefits== 

The baby [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] from its own mother is the most common way of obtaining breast milk, but the milk can be [[breast pump|pumped]] and then fed by [[baby bottle]], cup and/or spoon, supplementation drip system, and [[nasogastric tube]]. Breast milk can be supplied by a woman other than the baby's mother; either via donated pumped milk (for example from a milk bank), or when a woman nurses a child other than her own at her breast — an ancient and storied practice known as [[wetnurse|wetnursing]].

The [[World Health Organization]] recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, with solids gradually being introduced around this age when signs of readiness are shown. Supplemented breastfeeding is recommended until at least age two and then for as long as the mother and child wish.<ref name="who1">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Exclusive breastfeeding |publisher=Who.int |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref>

Breastfeeding also provides health benefits for the mother. It assists the uterus in returning to its pre-pregnancy size and reduces post-partum bleeding, as well as assisting the mother in returning to her pre-pregnancy weight. Breastfeeding also reduces the risk of breast cancer later in life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breast-Feeding Might Cut Risk for Tough-to-Treat Breast Cancer: Study|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/news/headlines/669591.cfm|accessdate=18 October 2012|coauthors=Alyssa Gillego, M.D and Stephanie Bernik, M.D}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Roy J.|title=The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality|journal=Sexual & Relationship Therapy|year=2006|month=May|volume=21|issue=2|pages=237–249}}</ref>

==Production==
[[File:Breastfeeding(milkfinal).png|frame|right|When the baby sucks its mother's breast, a hormone called oxytocin compels the milk to flow from the alveoli, through the ducts (milk canals) into the sacs (milk pools) behind the areola and then into the baby's mouth]]

Under the influence of the hormones [[prolactin]] and [[oxytocin]], women produce milk after [[childbirth]] to feed the [[baby]].  The initial milk produced is referred to as [[colostrum]], which is high in the [[immunoglobulin]] [[IgA]], which coats the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  This helps to protect the newborn until its own [[immune system]] is functioning properly, and creates a mild laxative effect, expelling [[meconium]] and helping to prevent the build-up of [[bilirubin]] (a contributory factor in [[jaundice]]).

Actual inability to produce enough milk is rare, with studies showing that mothers from developing countries experiencing nutritional hardship still produce amounts of milk of similar quality to that of mothers in developed countries.<ref>Prentice, A.M., Paul, A., Prentice, A., Black, A., Cole, T., & Whitehead, R. (1986). Cross - cultural differences in lactational performance. In Maternal Environmental Factors in Human Lactation. Human Lactation 2, pp. 13 = 44 [Hamosh, M., & Goldman, A.S. (eds). New York: Plenum Press.</ref> There are many reasons a mother may not produce enough breast milk. Some of the most common are an improper latch (i.e., the baby does not connect efficiently with the nipple), not nursing or pumping enough to meet supply, certain medications (including estrogen-containing [[hormonal contraceptives]]), illness, and dehydration.  A rarer reason is [[Sheehan's syndrome]], also known as postpartum [[hypopituitarism]], which is associated with prolactin deficiency: This syndrome may require hormone replacement.

The amount of milk produced depends on how often the mother is nursing and/or [[breast pump|pumping]]; the more the mother nurses her baby, or [[breast pump|pumps]], the more milk is produced.<ref name="mayo1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-feeding/FL00120 |title=Breast-feeding: Pumping and maintaining your milk supply |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/FAQ/increase.html |title=How Can I Increase My Milk Supply? |publisher=LLLI |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T022800.asp |title=Increasing Your Milk Supply &#124; Ask Dr. Sears® |publisher=Askdrsears.com |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://parenting.ivillage.com/newborn/nbreastfeed/0,,456z,00.html |title=Breast milk: Increasing supply - iVillage |publisher=Parenting.ivillage.com |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babies.sutterhealth.org/breastfeeding/bf_production.html |title=How Breast Milk is Produced |publisher=Babies.sutterhealth.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref> It is very helpful to nurse on demand - to nurse when the baby wants to nurse rather than on a schedule.

If nutrient supply is found lacking, content is obtained from the mother's bodily stores.  The exact composition of breast milk varies from day to day, depending on food consumption and environment, meaning that the ratio of water to [[fat]] fluctuates.
[[File:Colostrum vs breastmilk.jpg|thumb|Colostrum vs breastmilk]]

During the first few days after delivery, the mother produces [[colostrum]]. This is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that sometimes leaks from the breasts during pregnancy. It is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby (the baby's immune system is not fully developed at birth). Colostrum also helps the newborn's digestive system to grow and function properly.

[[Colostrum]] will gradually change to become mature milk.  In the first 3-4 days it will appear thin and watery and will taste very sweet; later, the milk will be thicker and creamier.  Human milk quenches the baby's thirst and hunger and provides the proteins, sugar, minerals, and antibodies that the baby needs. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, lactation professionals used to make a differentiation between foremilk and hindmilk.  But this differentiation causes confusion as there are not two types of milk.  Instead, as a baby breastfeeds, the fat content very gradually increases, with the milk becoming fattier and fattier over time. <ref>Mohrbacher, https://breastfeedingusa.org/content/article/worries-about-foremilk-and-hindmilk </ref>

[[Image:Human Breastmilk - Foremilk and Hindmilk.png|thumb|400px|Two 25-milliliter samples of human breast milk. The lefthand sample is foremilk and the righthand sample is hindmilk.]] 

The level of [[Immunoglobulin A]] (IgA) in breast milk remains high from day 10 until at least 7.5 months post-partum.<ref>Rechtman, DJ and Ferry, B. and Lee, ML and Chapel, H.  2002. International Journal of Infectious Diseases 6, pS58.</ref>

Human milk contains 0.8% to 0.9% protein, 4.5% fat, 7.1% carbohydrates, and 0.2% ash (minerals).<ref>Belitz, H Food Chemistry, 4th Edition, p.501 table 10.5</ref> Carbohydrates are mainly [[lactose]]; several lactose-based oligosaccharides have been identified as minor components.
The fat fraction contains specific [[triglycerides]] of [[palmitic acid|palmitic]] and [[oleic acid]] (O-P-O triglycerides), and also quite a large quantity of lipids with trans bonds (see: [[trans fat]]) that are considered to have a health benefit. They are [[vaccenic acid]], and [[Conjugated linoleic acid]] (CLA) accounting for up to 6% of the human milk fat.<ref>Precht, D and J.Molkentin C18:1, C18:2, and C8:3 trans and cis fatty acid isomers including conjugated cis delta 9, trans delta 11 linoleic acid (CLA) as well as total fat composition of German human milk lipids, Nahrung 1999 43(4) 233-244</ref><ref>Friesen, R, and S.M. Innis, Trans Fatty acids in Human milk in Canada declined with the introduction of trans fat food labeling, J. Nut 2006, 136 2558-2561</ref>

The principal proteins are [[casein]] ([[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to bovine beta-casein), alpha-[[lactalbumin]], [[lactoferrin]] (apo-lactoferrin), [[IgA]], [[lysozyme]], and [[serum albumin]]. In an acidic environment such as the [[stomach]], alpha-lactalbumin [[protein folding|unfolds]] into a different form and binds [[oleic acid]] to form a complex called [[Experimental cancer treatment#HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells)|HAMLET]] that kills [[tumor]] cells. This is thought to contribute to the protection of breastfed babies against cancer.<ref>{{Cite journal

At one time it was thought that breast milk was [[sterile]], however it is now known that it is more similar to cultured [[yoghurt]], containing as many as 600 different species of beneficial bacteria.  It is also now known that breast milk contains a unique type of sugars, [[oligosaccharides]], which are long chains of complex sugars. So far scientists have identified 140 of them and estimate there are about 200.  These types of sugars are found nowhere else in nature, and not every mother produces the same ones, since they vary by blood type. However, the oligosaccharides are not digestible by infants and are instead meant to feed the beneficial bacteria that live in the intestine and help to fight infections. Also found in breast milk are endo-[[cannabinoids]], which may act as a appetite stimulant, but they also regulate appetite so infants don't eat too much. It is thought that it may be related to the fact that formula-fed babies have a higher caloric intake than breastfed babies, and there is also speculation that it may be related to the recent  childhood obesity epidemic.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/16/breasts-breastfeeding-milk-florence-williams The wonder of breasts | Life and style | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The breast milk of diabetic mothers has been shown to have a different composition from that of non-diabetic mothers. It may contain elevated levels of glucose and insulin and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids. A dose-dependent effect of diabetic breast milk on increasing language delays in infants has also been noted, although doctors recommend that diabetic mothers breastfeed despite this potential risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodekamp E, Harder T, Kohlhoff R, Dudenhausen JW, Plagemann A |title=Impact of breast-feeding on psychomotor and neuropsychological development in children of diabetic mothers: role of the late neonatal period |journal=Journal of Perinatal Medicine |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=490–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17140300 |doi=10.1515/JPM.2006.095 |url=}}</ref>

Though it now is almost universally prescribed, in some countries in the 1950s the practice of [[breastfeeding]] went through a period where it was out of vogue and the use of [[infant formula]] was considered superior to breast milk.  However, it is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk. In addition to the appropriate amounts of [[carbohydrate]], [[protein]], and [[fat]], breast milk provides [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[digestive enzyme]]s,<ref name="pmid21091243">{{cite pmid|21091243}}</ref> and [[hormones]].<ref name="pmid21091243"/> Breast milk also contains antibodies and lymphocytes from the mother that help the baby resist infections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1792611/ |title=Lymphocytes bearing the T cell receptor gamma delta in human breast milk |publisher=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=1990-11-01 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}</ref> The immune function of breast milk is individualized, as the mother, through her touching and taking care of the baby, comes into contact with pathogens that colonize the baby, and, as a consequence, her body makes the appropriate antibodies and immune cells.<ref>[http://www.gentlebirth.org/vre/newimmun.html The Newborn Immune System and Immunological Benefits of Breastmilk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Breast milk contains less iron than formula, as iron is an essential nutrient for the survival of pathogens inside a host.<ref>{{cite pmid|22191452}}</ref>  However, the iron supplied in breast milk is more available to the infant than that supplied in formula feedings or supplements. At around four to six months of age  the internal iron supplies of the infant, held in the hepatic cells of the liver, is exhausted , hence this is the time that complementary feeding is introduced.<ref>[http://www.nancymohrbacher.com/blog/2010/11/29/do-breastfeeding-babies-need-extra-iron-at-4-months.html Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple - Breastfeeding Reporter - Do Breastfeeding Babies Need Extra Iron at 4 Months?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://aapnews.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/10/05/aapnews.20101005-1.full First AAP recommendations on iron supplementation include directive on universal screening<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Women [[breastfeeding]] should consult with their physician regarding substances that can be unwittingly passed to the infant via breast milk, such as [[alcohol]], viruses ([[HIV]] or [[HTLV-1]]) or medications.

Most women that do not breastfeed use [[infant formula]], but breast milk donated by volunteers to human milk banks can be obtained by prescription in some countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/index.cfm?page=359 |title=Breastfeeding &#124; Health benefits for mother and baby |publisher=womenshealth.gov |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref>

== Comparison to other milks ==
All [[mammal]]ian species produce milk, but the composition of milk for each species varies widely and other kinds of milk are often very different from human breast milk.  As a rule, the milk of mammals that nurse frequently (including human babies) is less rich, or more watery, than the milk of mammals whose young nurse less often.  Human milk is noticeably thinner and sweeter than cow's milk.

Whole cow's milk contains too little [[iron]], [[retinol]], [[vitamin E]], [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin D]], [[unsaturated fat]]s or essential [[fatty acid]]s for human babies.<ref>Department of Health, 1994.

== Alternative uses for breast milk ==

In addition to providing essential nourishment to infants, human milk; i.e., breast milk, has a number of valuable uses, especially medicinal uses, for both children and adults. It has been used medicinally for thousands of years.<ref>Newsvine.com. ''The Milk Of Human Kindness: Uses For Human Breast Milk'' http://daniel-slack.newsvine.com/_news/2009/04/26/2733785-the-milk-of-human-kindness-uses-for-human-breast-milk</ref><ref>Bella Online: ''Medicinal Uses of Breast milk''  http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art41924.asp</ref> Breast milk contains strong [[antibodies]] and [[antitoxin]]s that many people believe promote healing and better overall health. However, breast milk lacks sterile and antiseptic properties if a nursing mother is infected with certain [[communicable disease]]s, such as [[HIV]] and CMV, as breast milk can transmit such diseases to infants and other people.<ref>New England Journal of Medicine ''Breast Milk & Risk of CMV 1980'' http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/citation/302/19/1073</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|22719248}}</ref>

Breast milk has been used as a [[home remedy]] for minor [[ailment]]s, such as [[conjunctivitis]], [[insect bites and stings]], [[contact dermatitis]], and infected [[wounds]], [[burn]]s, and [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]]s. Breast milk has also been used [[alternative medicine|alternatively]] to boost the [[immune system]] of ill persons having [[viral gastroenteritis]], [[influenza]], the [[common cold]], [[pneumonia]], etc., because of its [[immunology|immunologic]] properties. However, breast milk should never be seen or [[construals|construed]] as a "[[panacea (medicine)|cure-all]]". Some medical experts are convinced that breast milk can induce [[apoptosis]] in some types of [[cancer cells]].  However, more research and evidence are needed in this area of cancer treatment.<ref name="Hallgren O, Aits S, Brest P, Gustafsson L, Mossberg AK, Wullt B, Svanborg C 2008 217–40">{{cite journal| author=Hallgren O, Aits S, Brest P, Gustafsson L, Mossberg AK, Wullt B, Svanborg C| title=Apoptosis and tumor cell death in response to HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells| year=2008| journal=Adv Exp Med Biol.| volume=606| pages=217–40| pmid=18183931| doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74087-4_8}}</ref>

A minority of people, including ''[[restaurant|restaurateur]]'' Hans Lochen of [[Switzerland]] and ''[[restaurant|restaurateur]]'' Daniel Angerer of [[Austria]], who operates a restaurant in New York City, have used human breast milk, or at least advocated its use, as a substitute for cow's milk in [[dairy]] products and food [[recipe]]s.<ref>New York Daily News: ''Restaurant Drops Plan to Cook with Breast Milk'' http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/09/18/2008-09-18_restaurant_drops_plan_to_cook_with_breas.html</ref> Tammy Frissell-Deppe, a family counselor specialized in [[attachment parenting]], published a book, titled ''A Breastfeeding Mother's Secret Recipes'', providing a lengthy compilation of detailed food and beverage recipes containing human breast milk.<ref>Tammy Frissell-Deppe.

Attempts to formulate [[soap]] from breast milk have also been made, and those using it claim that its effectiveness as a [[cleanser]] is greater than, or equal to, that of traditional soaps.<ref>The Traditional Midwife: ''Mother's Milk Soap'' http://traditionalmidwife.com/mothersmilksoap.html</ref>

==Passing of unwanted substances==
Despite the risk of substances transmitting from the mother to the child through breast milk, breastfeeding has far more advantages than [[infant formula]]s, and, with few exceptions, the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.<ref>http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/gs_infant_feeding_text_eng.pdf</ref>

The milk-producing cells are most permeable to drugs during the first [[postpartum]] week.<ref name=breastfeedingbasics>[http://www.breastfeedingbasics.org/cgi-bin/deliver.cgi/content/Drugs/pre_pass.html breastfeedingbasics.org - a site for parents developed by pediatricians --> Breastfeeding & Drugs: Does the medication pass into the breast milk?] Retrieved on June 19, 2009</ref>

Drug characteristics that increase excretion in milk include:<ref name=breastfeedingbasics/>
#Not [[plasma protein binding]]
#Non-ionized
#Low molecular weight
#[[Lipid solubility]] rather than water solubility
#Weakly alkaline rather than weak acid

Drugs are transferred from blood plasma across ductal cells to the milk by [[diffusion]] or [[active transport]]. The latter may result in higher concentration of the drug in the breast milk than in the plasma of the mother.<ref name=breastfeedingbasics/>

The amounts of most drugs in milk do not exceed 2% of the total ingested dose.<ref name=breastfeedingbasics/>

===Environmental pollutants===
[[Environmental pollutant]]s found in breast milk are usually not harmful, and should be considered only when environmental levels are unusually high. In addition, there has been a decrease in environmental levels, also resulting in a decrease breast-milk levels. Pollutants that are of most concern are [[pesticides]], [[organic mercury]], and [[lead]]. [[DDT]] and [[dieldrin]] are unavoidable, and can also be detected in infant formulas.<ref name=kidsgrowth>[http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 kidsgrowth.org --> Drugs and Other Substances in Breast Milk] Retrieved on June 19, 2009</ref> Pesticides and other toxic substances [[bioaccumulate]]; i.e., creatures higher up the [[food chain]] will store more of them in their [[body fat]]. This is an issue in particular for the [[Inuit]], whose [[Inuit diet|traditional diet]] is predominantly meat. Studies are looking at the effects of [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] and [[persistent organic pollutants]] in the body; the breast milk of Inuit mothers is extraordinarily high in toxic compounds.<ref>''Silent Snow: The Slow Poisoning of the Arctic'' by Marla Cone, Grove Press.</ref>

Persistent toxins were first discovered in breast milk in 1951, when a group of mothers were tested for the pesticide DDT. In 1966, a Swedish researcher found that his wife's breast milk contained [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) and five years later Sweden banned PCB's, with the United States following a few years later. But because of their widespread use and persistence, they are still the highest-concentration toxins in breast milk. Most scientists maintain that prenatal exposure to PCB's can do real damage. Researchers in the Great Lakes region, the Arctic and the Netherlands found that babies born to mothers with mid- to upper-range background levels of PCB contamination (most likely because of diets rich in contaminated fish and animal products) have reduced immunities against infections, delayed learning capabilities, lower I.Q.'s and delayed learning capabilities, with some problems lasting  at least into early adolescence.  However, researchers were surprised to learn that although the children who were breast-fed had higher PCB levels than children who were not breastfed, they consistently performed better than those who drank formula--breast milk appeared to be at least partly protective against the effects of toxic chemicals.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/09/magazine/09TOXIC.html?_r=0</ref>  

In 1981 reseachers  in the U.S. discovered the flame retardant [[PBDE]] in stored human milk samples.  Testing showed that between the early 70s when the chemical first came into use and up to 1998, levels of PBDE's in breast milk were doubling every five years and levels were found to be 10 to 100 times higher than those of women in Europe and Japan.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Extraordinary consumption==
Preliminary research indicates that breast milk can induce [[apoptosis]] in some types of cancer cells.<ref name="Hallgren O, Aits S, Brest P, Gustafsson L, Mossberg AK, Wullt B, Svanborg C 2008 217–40"/> Adults with GI disorders and organ donation recipients can also benefit from the immunologic powers of human breast milk.

In Costa Rica, there have been trials to produce cheese and custard from human milk as an alternative to [[weaning]]<ref name="Nacion">''[http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/junio/17/aldea1131695.html Clínica busca cómo hacer queso de leche materna]'', [[Nación]], 17 June 2007</ref>

An Icecreamists in London's Covent Garden started selling an ice cream named Baby Gaga in February 2011. Each serving costs £14. All the milk was donated by Mrs Hiley who earns £15 for every 10 ounces and calls it a "great recession beater".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12569011 | work=BBC News | location=London | title=Breast milk ice cream goes on sale in Covent Garden. | date=2011-02-24 | accessdate=2011-03-07}}</ref> The ice cream sold out on its first day.

== Importance of breastfeeding ==
It is generally accepted that breastfeeding is very important in the early period of life. Furthermore, it has potentially long-lasting or lifelong biological effects in one's life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biological and Nutritional Aspects of Human Milk in Feeding of Preterm Infants|url=http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=25294}}</ref>
