In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]], there are nine recognized '''dental specialties''' in which some [[dentist]]s choose to train and practice, in addition to or instead of [[Dentistry|general dentistry]].

To become a specialist requires training in a [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] or advanced graduate training program. Once a residency is completed, the doctor is granted a [[Academic certificate|certificate]] of specialty training. Many specialty programs have optional or required [[advanced degree]]s such as a [[master's degree]], such as the [[Master of Science]] (MS or MSc), [[Dental degree|Master of Dental Surgery/Science]] (MDS/MDSc), [[Dental degree|Master of Dentistry]] (MDent), [[Dental degree|Master of Clinical Dentistry]] (MClinDent), [[Master of Philosophy]] (MPhil), [[Master of Medical Science]] (MMS or (MMSc); [[doctorate]] such as Doctor of Clinical Dentistry (DClinDent), [[Doctor of Medical Science|Doctor of Medical Science/Sciences]] (DMSc), or [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]];or [[Medical school|medical degree]]: [[Doctor of Medicine]]/[[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MD/MBBS) specific to [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|maxillofacial surgery]] and sometimes [[oral medicine]]).

==Official specialties==
* [[Dental public health]] - The study of dental [[epidemiology]] and social health policies.
* [[Endodontics]] - [[Root canal]] therapy and study of diseases of the [[dental pulp]].
* Oral and maxillofacial [[pathology]] - The study, diagnosis, and sometimes the treatment of oral and maxillofacial related diseases.
* Oral and maxillofacial [[radiology]] - The study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]] - [[Extraction (dental)|Extractions]], [[Dental implant|implants]], and facial surgery.
* [[Orthodontics]] and [[dentofacial orthopedics]]  - The straightening of teeth and modification of midface and mandibular growth.
* [[Periodontology|Periodontics]] (also periodontology) - Study and treatment of diseases of the [[periodontium]] (non-surgical and surgical) as well as placement and maintenance of dental implants
* [[Pediatric dentistry]] (formerly pedodontics) - Dentistry for children
* [[Prosthodontics]] - [[Denture]]s, [[Bridge (dentistry)|bridges]] and the restoration of implants. Some prosthodontists further their training in "oral and maxillofacial prosthodontics", which is the discipline concerned with the replacement of missing facial structures, such as ears, eyes, noses, etc.

Specialists in these fields are designated "registrable" (in the [[United States]], "board eligible") and warrant exclusive titles such as orthodontist, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, endodontist, pediatric dentist, periodontist, or prosthodontist upon satisfying certain local (U.S., "Board Certified"), ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]: Fellow of the [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]], designated by the [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominal]] "FRACDS"), or ([[Canada]]: Fellow of the [[Royal College of Dentists]], designated by the postnominal "FRCD(C)") registry requirements.

The [[American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine]] (ABDSM) provides board-certification examinations annually for qualified dentists. These dentists collaborate with sleep physicians at accredited sleep centers and can provide oral appliance therapy and upper airway surgery to treat sleep-related breathing disorders.[http://www.abdsm.org/] While Diplomate status granted by the ABDSM is not one of the recognized dental specialties, it is recognized by the [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]] (AASM). (See ''sleep dentistry'' in the section of [[sleep medicine]] about the US.)

A few other post-graduate formal advanced education programs: [[Postgraduate training in general dentistry|GPR, GDR, MTP residencies]] (advanced clinical and didactic training with intense hospital experience) and [[Postgraduate training in general dentistry|AEGD, SEGD, and GradDipClinDent programs]] (advanced training in clinical dentistry) are recognized but do not lead to specialization.

Other dental education exists where no postgraduate formal university training is required: [[cosmetic dentistry]], [[dental implant]], [[Temporomandibular joint disorder|temporo-mandibular joint therapy]]. These usually require the attendance of one or more continuing education courses that typically last for one to several days. There are restrictions on allowing these [[dentists]] to call themselves specialists in these fields. The specialist titles are registrable titles and controlled by the local dental licensing bodies.

==Other specialties==
* [[Dental anesthesiology]] - The study of how to relieve pain through advanced use of local and general anesthesia techniques is not yet considered to be one of the recognized dental specialties. However, the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) is in the process of accrediting all dental anesthesiology programs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} On Nov 1, 2012, the ADA House of Delegates voted to deny specialty recognition to the branch.  The application can be resubmitted in 2 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/news/7885.aspx  |title=Specialty recognition for dental anesthesiology rejected |publisher=ada.org|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref>
* [[Special needs dentistry]] - Dentistry for those with developmental and acquired disabilities. It is a recognized specialty by the [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]]. It has also been recently recognised as a specialty by the General Dental Council in the United Kingdom. The American Board Special Care Dentistry is hoping to also obtain accreditation for special needs dentistry by CODA.,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scdaonline.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=116 |title=Special Care Dentistry: Education & Courses: Diplomate |publisher=Scdaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jdentaled.org/cgi/content/full/69/2/249 |title=Preparing Dental Graduates to Provide Care to Individuals with Special Needs - Waldman et al. 69 (2): 249 - Journal of Dental Education |publisher=Jdentaled.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref>
