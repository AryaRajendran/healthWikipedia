'''Posthumous sperm retrieval (PSR)''' is a procedure in which [[Semen extraction|spermatozoa are extracted]] from a man after he has been pronounced legally [[brain death|brain dead]]. There has been significant debate over the ethicality and legality of the procedure, and on the [[legal rights]] of the child and surviving parent if the [[gamete]]s are used for [[pregnancy|impregnation]].<ref name="Orr">Orr, RD; Siegler, M (2002) Is posthumous semen retrieval ethically permissible? ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics|J Med Ethics]] 2002;'''28''':299–302''</ref>

Cases of post-mortem conception have occurred ever since human [[artificial insemination]] techniques were first developed, with sperm donated to a [[sperm bank]] being used following the death of the donor. While religious arguments have been brought against the process even under these circumstances, far more censure has arisen from a number of quarters with regards to [[Invasive (medical)|invasive]] retrieval from fresh [[cadaver]]s or patients either on [[life support]] or in a [[persistent vegetative state]], particularly when the procedure is carried out without explicit consent from the donor. 

==Procedure==
[[Image:Icsi.JPG|right|thumb|[[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]], the most common method of fertilisation using posthumously extracted sperm.]]
The first successful retrieval of sperm from a cadaver was reported in 1980, in a case involving a 30-year-old man who became brain dead following a motor vehicle accident and whose family requested sperm preservation.<ref name="Rothman">Rothman, CM (1980) "A method for obtaining viable sperm in the postmortem state." ''[[Fertility and Sterility|Fertil. Steril.]] 1980;'''34'''(5):512.''</ref> The first successful conception using sperm retrieved post-mortem was reported in 1998, leading to a successful birth the following year.<ref name="Strong">Strong, C; Gingrich, JR; Kutteh, WH (2000), "Ethics of sperm retrieval after death or persistent vegetative state," ''[[Human Reproduction]] 2000;'''15'''(4):739–745''</ref> Since 1980, a number of requests for the procedure have been made, with around one third approved and performed.<ref name="Orr"/> Gametes have been extracted through a variety of means, including removal of the [[epididymis]], [[irrigation]] or [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspiration]] of the [[vas deferens]], and rectal probe [[electroejaculation]].<ref name="Strong"/> Since the procedure is rarely performed, studies on the efficacy of the various methods have been fairly limited in scope. 

While [[medical literature]] recommends that extraction take place no later than 24&nbsp;hours after death, [[motility|motile]] sperm has been successfully obtained as late as 36&nbsp;hours after death, generally regardless of the [[cause of death]] or method of extraction. Up to this limit, the procedure has a high success rate, with sperm retrieved in nearly 100% of cases, and motile sperm in 80–90%.<ref name="Shefi">Shefi S et al. (2006) "Posthumous sperm retrieval: Analysis of time interval to harvest sperm", ''Human Reproduction 2006;'''21'''(11):2890–2893''</ref>

If the sperm is viable, fertilisation is generally achieved through [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]], a form of [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]]. The success rate of ''in vitro'' fertilisation remains unchanged regardless of whether the sperm was retrieved from a living or dead donor.<ref name="Shefi"/>

==Legality==

The legality of posthumous sperm extraction varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, legislation falls into one of three camps: a full ban, a requirement of written consent from the donor, or implied consent obtained from the family.

===Areas with full bans===
Following the 1984 [[Parpalaix case]] in [[France]], in which the widow of deceased [[cancer]] patient Alain Parpalaix obtained permission from the courts to be inseminated with her husband's spermatozoa after his death, the [[Centre d’Etude et de Conservation du Sperme Humain]] (Center for the Study and Preservation of Human Sperm) petitioned the courts successfully for a full ban on posthumous insemination,<ref name="Bahadur">Bahadur, G (2002) "Death and conception", ''Human Reproduction Oct 2002;'''17'''(10):2769–2775</ref> in line with the country's ban on ''in vitro'' fertilisation for post-[[menopause|menopausal]] women.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/05/30/france.mom/index.html "62-year-old woman gives birth"], [[CNN]], May 30, 2001. Retrieved June 28, 2007.</ref>

Similar legislation exists in [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Canada]] and the [[Australia]]n states of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]].<ref name="Bahadur"/>

===Areas requiring written consent===
Guidelines outlining the legal use of posthumously extracted [[gamete]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] were laid out in the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]]. The Act dictates that explicit written consent by the donor must be provided to the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] in order for extraction and fertilisation to take place.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900037_en_1.htm Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (c. 37)], specifically [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900037_en_5.htm#sdiv3 Schedule&nbsp;3,&nbsp;Paragraph&nbsp;5]</ref>  Following the 1997 case of ''[[Regina v. Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]]'', the terms of the Act were extended to [[coma]]tose patients, and so theoretically [[assault]] charges could be (but in this case were not) brought against doctors for overseeing or performing the procedure.<ref name="Bahadur"/>

There are few other jurisdictions that fall into this category. [[New York State Senate|New York senator]] [[Roy M. Goodman]] proposed a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] in 1997 requiring written consent by the donor in 1998, but it was never passed into law.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15721263.600-life-after-death--new-york-state-moves-to-keep-dead-mens-sperm-in-the-family.html "Life after death – New York state moves to keep dead men's sperm in the family"]; Cohen, Philip; ''[[New Scientist]]'' (21 March 1998. Retrieved 28 June 2007)</ref>

===Areas requiring implied consent===
In 2003, [[Israel]]i [[Attorney General]] [[Elyakim Rubinstein]] published several guidelines outlining the legal situation of  posthumous sperm retrieval for the purpose of later insemination by a surviving female partner. The guidelines specified firstly that only requests by a partner (married or otherwise) of the deceased would be honoured – requests by other members of the donor's family would be flatly denied. While extraction of the sperm was guaranteed following a request by the partner, permission to use the sperm was to be determined case by case, a court of law deciding on the basis of the effect on the presumed wishes of the donor, and the effect of the procedure on the donor's dignity. If it could be demonstrated that the deceased took definite steps towards parenthood (implied consent), use of extracted sperm by the female partner would generally be permitted.<ref name="Landau">Landau, R (2004) "Posthumous sperm retrieval for the purpose of later insemination or IVF in Israel: an ethical and psychosocial critique", ''Human Reproduction  2004 19(9):1952–1956''</ref>

===No legislation===
Many other countries, including [[Belgium]] and the [[United States]],<ref name="Bahadur"/> have no specific legislation regarding the rights of men on gamete donation following their death, leaving the decision in the hands of individual [[clinic]]s and [[hospital]]s. As such, many medical institutions in such countries institute in-house policies regarding circumstances in which the procedure would be performed.<ref name="Cornell">See [http://www.cornellurology.com/uro/cornell/guidelines.shtml guidelines] provided by [[Cornell University]] to various [[New York]] hospitals for an example.</ref>

==Ethics==
There are several ethical issues surrounding the extraction and use of gametes from cadavers or patients in a [[persistent vegetative state]]. The most debated are those concerning religion, consent, and the rights of the surviving partner and child if the procedure results in a birth.

A number of major religions view posthumous sperm retrieval in a negative light, including [[Roman Catholicism]]<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19870222_respect-for-human-life_en.html Instruction on respect for human life in its origin and on the dignity of procreation], [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], February 22, 1987. Retrieved June 28, 2007.</ref> and [[Judaism]].<ref name="Jude">Grazi, R V; Wolowelsky J B. (1995) "The Use of Cryopreserved Sperm and Pre-embryos In Contemporary Jewish Law and Ethics",  ''Assisted Reproductive Technology-Andrology, 8:53–61''</ref> Roman Catholicism proscribes the procedure on much the same grounds as ''in vitro'' fertilisation, namely the rights of the unborn. Judaic strictures are based on the [[Halakha|halakhic]] prohibition on deriving personal benefit from a corpse, and in the case of those in a persistent vegetative state, their categorisation as ''gosses'' (dying person) prohibits anyone from touching or moving them for anything that does not relate to their immediate care.<ref name="Jude"/>

Consent of the donor is a further ethical barrier. Even in jurisdictions where implicit consent is not required, there are occasions in which clinicians have refused to perform the procedure on these grounds.<ref name="Cornell"/> If no proof of consent by the donor can be produced, implied consent, often in the form of prior actions, must be evident for clinicians to proceed with the extraction. Sperm retrieval is rarely carried out if there is evidence that the deceased clearly objected to the procedure prior to his death.

Finally, if the procedure is performed and results in a birth, there are several issues involving the legal rights of the child and its mother. Because posthumous insemination can take place months or even years after the father's death, it can in some cases be difficult to prove the paternity of the child. As such, [[inheritance]] and even the legal rights of the child to marry (due to the possibility of [[consanguinity]] between partners) can be affected. For this reason, several countries, including [[Israel]] and the [[United Kingdom]], impose a maximum term for the use of extracted sperm, after which the father will not be legally recognised on the child's [[birth certificate]].<ref name="Bahadur"/><ref name="Landau"/>
