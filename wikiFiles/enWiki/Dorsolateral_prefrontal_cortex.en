The '''dorsolateral prefrontal cortex''' (DL-PFC or DLPFC) is an area in the primate brain. It is, according to a more restricted definition, roughly equivalent to [[Brodmann area]]s [[Brodmann area 9|9]] and [[Brodmann area 46|46]].<ref>http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/jessica.grahn/neuroanatomy.html</ref> According to a broader definition, DL-PFC consists of the lateral portions of Brodmann areas 9 â€“ 12, of areas 45, 46, and the superior part of area 47.<ref name="Zelazo">Philip David Zelazo and Ulrich Muller: ''Executive function in typical and atypical development'', in: Usha Goswam (ed): Blackwell Handbook of Child Cognitive Development, 2002</ref> These regions mainly receive their blood supply from the [[middle cerebral artery]]. With respect to [[neurotransmitter]] systems, there is evidence that [[dopamine]] plays a particularly important role in DL-PFC.<ref name="Zelazo"/> <br />
DL-PFC is connected to the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], and to a variety of brain areas, which include the [[thalamus]], parts of the [[basal ganglia]] (specifically, the dorsal [[caudate nucleus]]), the [[hippocampus]], and primary and secondary association areas of [[neocortex]], including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas.<ref name="Zelazo"/> <br />
DL-PFC is the last area, 45th, to [[Myelinogenesis|myelinate]] in the human [[cerebrum]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Function==
DL-PFC serves as the highest cortical area responsible for motor planning, organization, and regulation. It plays an important role in the integration of sensory and mnemonic information and the regulation of intellectual function and action. It is also involved in [[working memory]]. However, DL-PFC is not exclusively responsible for the executive functions. All complex mental activity requires the additional cortical and subcortical circuits with which the DL-PFC is connected.<ref name="Zelazo"/><ref>Hale & Fiorello: ''School neuropsychology,'' 2004</ref>

Damage to the DL-PFC can result in the [[dysexecutive syndrome]],<ref>http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5545;year=2009;volume=51;issue=3;spage=180;epage=190;aulast=John</ref> which leads to problems with [[Affect (psychology) |affect]], [[social judgement]], [[Baddeley's_model_of_working_memory#Central_executive|executive memory]], 
[[abstract thinking]] and [[intentionality]].<ref>http://www.neuro.spc.org/vaughan/ExecutiveFunctionLecture.pdf</ref>

===Truth Telling===
The DL-PFC may also be involved in the act of deception and lying, which is thought to inhibit normal propensity to truth telling. Research suggests that using [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] on the DL-PFC can hamper a person's ability to lie, or indeed to tell the truth. <ref>http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128284.400-powerful-magnets-hamper-our-ability-to-lie.html</ref>

===Lucid dream states===
More recent research has found a connection between the DL-PFC and [[lucid dream]] states in which executive function is retained. <ref>http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827815.700-50-ideas-to-change-science-neuroscience.html</ref>
