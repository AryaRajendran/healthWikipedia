'''Jakub Hořčický''' (in [[Latin]] '''Jacobus Sinapius''') (1575–25 September 1622), later granted the title '''z Tepence''' ("'''of Tepenec'''"), was a [[Bohemia]]n pharmacist and personal doctor of Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].  The [[latinized name]] is a translation of his family name, which means "[[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]" in [[Czech language|Czech]] ("sinapis" in Latin).

==Biography==
According to his college records, Jakub was born in [[Bořenovice]] in [[Moravia]]<ref name=rzand>

There he worked in the college's [[pharmacy]] under the overseeing of [[Martin Schaffner]] (1564–1608).<ref name=schmidl>

Jakub eventually graduated from the Krumlov Gymnasium, and became a pharmacist himself.  By 1598 he started studying [[Aristotelian philosophy]] at the [[Clementinum]] college in Prague (which was later merged with [[Charles University]]), but continued working in chemistry and pharmacy.  He grew herbs and set up a laboratory at [[Smichov]], the Clementinum's [[botanical garden]].  There he distilled a very popular ''Aqua Sinapis'' ("water of mustard", perhaps a reference to his own name) whose sale made him a wealthy man.  He lent emperor [[Rudolf II]] enormous sums of money and received from him an estate in [[Mělník]].

In 1600 he became the administrator of the Jesuit college in [[Jindřichův Hradec]], and in 1606 he became ''capitaneus'' and administrator of the properties of the [[St. George's Convent, Prague|St. George's Convent]] in the [[Prague Castle]]. In 1607 he was named imperial chemist by Rudolf II.  In return for curing the emperor of a grave disease, he was ennobled with the title "de Tepenec", presumably after the historic [[Tepenec Castle]] (destroyed in 1391) near [[Olomouc]].

In the religious disputes of the early 17th century, Jakub strongly defended the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] side.  He became the leader of the township of Mělník but was jailed in 1620, when the Protestants took charge of the town.  He was subsequently exchanged by another prisoner ([[Jessenius]]) and exiled, but later returned to Mělník and lived there the rest of his life.

He died in 1622, from a horse-fall that he had suffered a year before.  Two days before his death he was moved to the Clementinum at the care of the Jesuits, and left them the sum of 50,000 gold coins and his Mělník estate.  He is buried in the [[Church of the Savior]] in the Clementinum.<ref name=schmidl/>

==Writings==
In 1609 he published a pro-Catholic pamphlet which saw several reprintings.<ref name=schmidl/>  According to a 1777 source, he had written several manuscripts on chemistry and botany.<ref name=pelzl>Franz Martin Pelzel [Pelcl] (1782), ''Abbildungen Böhmischer und Mährischer Gelehrten und Küstler nebst kurzen Nachrichten von Ihrem Leben und Wirken''. Tome IV, pages. 50-54.</ref>

==Connection to the Voynich manuscript==

Book dealer [[Wilfrid Voynich]] claimed that Jakub's name and title was barely readable at the bottom of the first page of the [[Voynich Manuscript]], and therefore it is believed that the book was once in his possession.  Unfortunately, attempts by Voynich to bring out more hidden writing on that page by chemical treatment only succeeded in erasing Jakub's name, which is now preserved only in photocopies.<ref name=rzand/>
