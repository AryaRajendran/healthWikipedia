'''Familial dysautonomia''' (FD), sometimes called '''Riley–Day syndrome'''<ref>[http://www.pediatriconcall.com/fordoctor/CaseReports/hsan.asp pediatriconcall.com]</ref> and '''[[hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy]] type III''' (HSAN-III) — is a disorder of the [[autonomic nervous system]] which affects the development and survival of sensory, sympathetic and some parasympathetic [[neurons]] in the autonomic and sensory [[nervous system]] resulting in variable symptoms including: [[Pain#Insensitivity to pain|insensitivity to pain]], inability to produce tears, poor growth, and labile blood pressure (episodic hypertension and postural hypotension). People with FD have frequent vomiting crises, pneumonia, problems with speech and movement, difficulty swallowing, inappropriate perception of heat, pain, and taste, as well as unstable blood pressure and gastrointestinal dysmotility. FD does not affect intelligence. Originally reported by Conrad Milton Riley and Richard Lawrence Day in 1949,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Riley CM, Day RL, Greely D, Langford WS | title=Central autonomic dysfunction with defective lacrimation | journal=Pediatrics | year=1949 | pages=468–77 | volume=3 |issue=4 |pmid=18118947 }}</ref> FD is one example of a group of disorders known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies ([[HSAN]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Axelrod FB | title=Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies. Familial dysautonomia and other HSANs | series=12 | journal=Clin Auton Res | year=2002 | pages=I2–14 | issue=7 | volume=Suppl 1 | pmid=12102459 | doi=10.1007/s102860200014}}</ref> All HSAN are characterized by widespread sensory dysfunction and variable autonomic dysfunction caused by incomplete development of sensory and autonomic neurons. The disorders are believed to be genetically distinct from each other.

==Incidence==
Familial dysautonomia is seen almost exclusively in [[Ashkenazi]] Jews and is inherited in an autosomal [[recessive]] fashion. Both parents must be carriers in order for a child to be affected. The carrier frequency in Jewish individuals of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) ancestry is about 1/30, while the carrier frequency in non-Jewish individuals is unknown. If both parents are carriers, there is a one in four, or 25%, chance with each pregnancy for an affected child. [[Genetic counseling]] and [[genetic testing]] is recommended for families who may be carriers of familial dysautonomia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Worldwide, there have been approximately 600 diagnoses recorded since discovery of the disease, with approximately 350 of them still living.<ref>http://www.familialdysautonomia.org/history.php</ref>

==Etiology==

Familial Dysautonomia, is the result of mutations in [[IKBKAP]] gene on [[chromosome 9]], which encodes for the [[IKAP protein]] (IkB kinase complex associated protein). There have been three mutations in IKBKAP identified in individuals with FD. The most common FD-causing mutation occurs in [[intron]] 20 of the donor gene. Conversion of T-->C in intron 20 of the donor gene resulted in shift splicing that generates an IKAP transcript lacking [[exon]] 20. Translation of this mRNA results in a truncated protein lacking all of the amino acids encoded in exons 20-37. Another less common mutation is a G-->C conversion resulting in one amino acid mutation in 696, where [[Proline]] substitutes normal [[Arginine]]. The decreased amount of functional IKAP protein in cells causes Familial Dysautonomia.

===Symptoms===

Symptoms displayed by a baby with FD might include:

# The most distinctive clinical feature is absence of overflow tears with emotional crying after age 7 months. This symptom can manifest less dramatically as persistent bilateral eye irritation.
# High prevalence of breech presentation
# Weak or absent suck and poor tone
# Poor suck and misdirected swallowing
# Red blotching of skin

Symptoms in an older child with FD might include:

# Delayed speech and walking
# Unsteady gait
# Spinal curvature
# [[Corneal abrasion]]
# Less perception in pain or temperature with [[nervous system]].
# Poor growth
# Erratic or unstable [[blood pressure]].
# Red puffy hands
# Dysautonomia crisis: constellation of symptoms response to physical and emotional stress; usually accompanied by [[vomiting]], increased heart rate, increase in [[blood pressure]], [[sweating]], [[drooling]], blotching of the skin and a negative change in personality.

===Clinical Diagnosis===
[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|200px|thumb|[[Recessive gene|Autosomal recessive]] inheritance]]

A clinical diagnosis of FD is supported by a constellation of criteria:
*Parents of [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish Background
*No fungiform papillae on the tongue
*Decreased deep tendon reflexes
*Lack of an axon flare following intradermal histamine
*No overflow tears with emotional crying

===Genetic Testing===
Genetic testing is performed on a small sample of blood from the tested individual. The [[DNA]] is examined with a designed probe specific to the known mutations. The accuracy of the test is above 99%. Dr. [[Anat Blumenfeld]] of the Hadasah Medical center in Jerusalem identified chromosome number 9 as the responsible chromosome.

===Prenatal Testing===

Familial Dysautonomia is inherited in an autosomal [[recessive]] pattern, which means 2 copies of the gene in each cell are altered. If both parents are shown to be carriers by genetic testing, there is a 25% chance that the child will produce FD. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk for FD by [[amniocentesis]] (for 14–17 weeks) or [[chorionic villus sampling]] (for 10–11 weeks) is possible.

==Treatment and treatment locations==
There currently is no cure for FD and death occurs in 50% of affected individuals by age 30. There are only two treatment centers,
one at [[New York University Hospital]]<ref>[http://www.med.nyu.edu/fd/ Dysautonomia Treatment and Evaluation Center]</ref> and one at the [[Hadassah Hospital]] in [[Israel]].
<ref>[http://www.hadassah.org.il/English/Eng_SubNavBar/Departments/Medical+departments/Pediatric+Mount+Scopus/FAMILIAL+DYSAUTONOMIA+CENTER.htm Familial Dysautonomia Center]</ref> One is being planned for the San Francisco area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/2528/ |title=San Francisco To Get a Genetics Center - Forward.com |accessdate=2007-11-02 |format= |work=}}</ref>

The survival rate and quality of life has increased since the mid 80's mostly due to greater understanding of the most dangerous symptoms.
At present, FD patients can be expected to function independently if treatment is begun early and major disabilities avoided.

A major issue has been Aspiration Pneumonias, where food or regurgitated stomach content would be aspirated into the lungs causing infections. [[Nissen fundoplication|Fundoplications]] (by preventing regurgitation) and gastrostomy tubes (to provide non oral nutrition) have reduced the frequency of hospitalization.

Other issues which can be treated include FD Crises, [[Scoliosis]], and various eye conditions due to limited or no tears.

An FD crisis is the body's loss of control of various [[Autonomic nervous system]] functions including blood pressure, heartrate, and body temperature. Both short term and chronic periodic high or low blood pressure have consequences and medication is used to stabilize blood pressure.

===Treatment of Manifestations===
[[Image:Kyphoscoliosis hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy III.jpg|thumb|[[Kyphoscoliosis]] in a 10-year-old girl with HSANIII.]]

Although the FD-causing gene has been identified and it seems to have tissue specific expression, there is no definitive treatment at present.
Treatment of FD remains preventative, symptomatic and supportive. FD does not express itself in a consistent manner. The type and severity of symptoms displayed vary among patients and even at different ages on the same patients. So patients should have specialized individual treatment plans. Medications are used to control vomiting, eye dryness, and [[blood pressure]]. There are some commonly needed treatments including:

# Artificial tears: using eye drop containing artificial tear solutions (methylcellulose)
# Feeding: Maintenance of adequate nutrition, avoidance of aspiration; thickened formula and different shaped nipples are used for baby.
# Daily chest [[physiotherapy]] (nebulization, [[bronchodilators]], and postural drainage): for Chronic lung disease from recurrent aspiration [[pneumonia]]
# Special drug management of autonomic manifestations such as vomiting: intravenous or rectal [[diazepam]] (0.2&nbsp;mg/kg q3h) and rectal chloral hydrate (30&nbsp;mg/kg q6h)
# Protecting the child from injury (coping with decreased taste, temperature and pain perception)
# Combating [[orthostatic hypotension]]: hydration, leg exercise, frequent small meals, a high-salt diet, and drugs such as [[fludrocortisone]].
# Treatment of orthopedic problems (tibial torsion and spinal curvature)
# Compensating for labile blood pressures

There is no cure for this genetic disorder.

===Therapies under investigation===

It is noted that in cell lines derived from [[heterozygous]] carriers of FD who display a normal phenotype, there are decreased levels of the wild-type IKAP transcript and also functional [[IKAP protein]] respectively. This would suggest that increasing the amount of the wild-type IKAP transcript may improve the manifestation in patients with FD.

==Prognosis==

The outlook for patients with FD depends on the particular diagnostic category. Patients with chronic, progressive, generalized [[dysautonomia]] in the setting of central nervous system degeneration have a generally poor long-term [[prognosis]]. Death can occur from [[pneumonia]], acute respiratory failure, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest in such patients.  (There needs to be a transition here to interventions re:  eye care.  This comment below has nothing to do with prognosis, but supportive care.)
Educate parents and patients regarding daily eye care and early warning signs of corneal problems as well as use of punctual cautery. This education has resulted in decreased corneal scarring and need for more aggressive surgical measures such as [[tarsorrhaphy]], conjunctival flaps, and [[corneal transplant]]s.

==Future==
In January 2001, researchers at [[Fordham University]] and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] simultaneously reported finding the genetic mutation that causes FD, a discovery that opens the door to many diagnostic and treatment possibilities.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Anderson SL, Coli R, Daly IW, Kichula EA, Rork MJ, Volpi SA, Ekstein J, Rubin BY | title=Familial dysautonomia is caused by mutations of the IKAP gene | journal=Am J Hum Genet | year=2001 | pages=753–8 | volume=68 | issue=3 | pmid=11179021 | doi=10.1086/318808 | pmc=1274486}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Slaugenhaupt SA, Blumenfeld A, Gill SP, Leyne M, Mull J, Cuajungco MP, Liebert CB, Chadwick B, Idelson M, Reznik L, Robbins C, Makalowska I, Brownstein M, Krappmann D, Scheidereit C, Maayan C, Axelrod FB, Gusella JF | title=Tissue-specific expression of a splicing mutation in the IKBKAP gene causes familial dysautonomia | journal=Am J Hum Genet | year=2001 | pages=598–605 | volume=68 | issue=3 | pmid=11179008 | doi=10.1086/318810 | pmc=1274473}}</ref>

Despite that it probably would not happen in the near future, some expect that stem-cell therapy will result. Eventually, treatment could be given in utero.{{Citation needed|reason="some expect" is inappropriate without a source, although both sentences should be sourced, otherwise they are speculation and should be deleted.|date=July 2010}}

While that may be years ahead, genetic screening became available around April 2001, enabling Ashkenazi Jews to find out if they are carriers. Screening organization [[Dor Yeshorim]] offers testing as part of its panel, which also includes [[Tay-Sachs disease]] and [[cystic fibrosis]].

In the meantime more research into treatments are being funded by the foundations that exist. These foundations are organized and run by parents of those with FD. There is no governmental support beyond recognizing those diagnosed with FD as eligible for certain programs.<ref>[http://www.familialdysautonomia.org/resguide/chapter4.htm Benefits for people with FD] - from [[Dysautonomia foundation]]</ref>
