'''Anti-streptolysin O''' (ASO or ASLO) is the antibody made against streptolysin O, an immunogenic, oxygen-labile hemolytic toxin produced by most strains of group A and many strains of groups C and G [[streptococcus|streptococci]]. The O in the name stands for ''oxygen-labile''; the other related toxin being oxygen-stable streptolysin-S.  The main function of streptolysin O is to cause hemolysis (the breaking open of red blood cells) in particular, beta-hemolysis.

== Significance ==
When the body is infected with streptococci, it produces [[antibodies]] against the various antigens that the streptococci produce. ASO is one such antibody. A raised or rising levels can indicate past or present infection. Historically it was one of the first bacterial markers used for diagnosis and follow up of [[rheumatic fever]] or [[scarlet fever]]. Its importance in this regard has not diminished.

Since these antibodies are produced as a delayed antibody reaction to the above mentioned bacteria, there is no normal value. The presence of these antibodies indicates an exposure to these bacteria. However, as many people are exposed to these bacteria and remain asymptomatic, the mere presence of ASO does not indicate disease.

Acceptable values, where there is no clinical suspicion of rheumatism are as follows:
*Adults: less than 200 units
*Children: less than 400 units

This [[titre]] has a significance only if it is greatly elevated (>200) , or if a rise in titre can be demonstrated in paired blood samples taken days apart.The antibody levels begin to rise after 1 to 3 weeks of strep infection, peaks in 3 to 5 weeks and falls back to insignificant levels in  6 months.

Values need to be correlated with a clinical diagnosis.

== Estimation ==
{{details3|[[serology]]}}
It is done by [[serology|serological]] methods like latex agglutination or slide agglutination. [[ELISA]] may be performed to detect the exact titre value.

To detect the titre value, by a non-ELISA method, one has to perform the above agglutination using a serial dilution technique.

== Mechanism of action ==
{{details3|[[rheumatic fever]]}}
These antibodies produced against the bacteria cross-react with human antigens (mainly [[collagen]]) and hence attack the [[cellular matrix]] of various organs, mainly the heart, joints, skin, brain, etc.

== Antistreptolysin O titre ==
Antistreptolysin O titre ('''AS(L)O titre''' or '''AS(L)OT''') is a measure of the blood plasma levels of antistreptolysin O [[antibodies]] used in tests for the diagnosis of a [[Streptococcus|streptococcal infection]] or indicate a past exposure to streptococci.

The ASOT helps direct [[antimicrobial]] treatment and is used to assist in the diagnosis of scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, and [[glomerulonephritis|post infectious glomerulonephritis]].
