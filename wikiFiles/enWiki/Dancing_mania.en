'''Dancing mania''' (also known as '''dancing plague''', '''choreomania''', '''St John's Dance''' and, historically, '''St. Vitus' Dance''') was a [[social phenomenon]] that occurred primarily in mainland Europe between the 14th and 17th centuries. It involved groups of people dancing erratically, sometimes thousands at a time. The mania affected men, women, and children, who danced until they collapsed from exhaustion. One of the first major outbreaks was in [[Aachen]], Germany, in 1374, and it quickly spread throughout Europe; one particularly notable outbreak occurred in [[Dancing Plague of 1518|Strasbourg in 1518]].

Affecting thousands of people across several centuries, dancing mania was not an isolated event, and was well documented in contemporary reports. It was nevertheless poorly understood, and remedies were based on guesswork. Generally, musicians accompanied dancers, to help ward off the mania, but this tactic sometimes backfired by encouraging more to join in. There is no consensus among modern-day scholars as to the cause of dancing mania.<ref>Sirois, F. (1982). Perspectives on epidemic hysteria. In M. J. Colligan, J. W. Pennebaker, & L. R. Murphy (eds.), Mass psychogenic illness: A social psychological analysis (pp. 217-236). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref>

The several theories proposed range from religious cults being behind the processions to people dancing to relieve themselves of stress and put the poverty of the period out of their minds. It is, however, thought to be as a [[mass psychogenic illness]] in which the occurrence of similar physical symptoms, with no known physical cause, affect a large group of people as a form of social influence.<ref>Sirois, F. (1982). Perspectives on epidemic hysteria. In M. J. Colligan, J. W. Pennebaker, & L. R. Murphy (eds.), Mass psychogenic illness: A social psychological analysis (pp. 217-236).

==Definition==
"Dancing mania" is derived from the term "choreomania", from the Greek ''choros'' (dance) and ''mania'' (madness),<ref name = "Bartholomew">Bartholomew.</ref>{{rp |133–4}} and is also known as "dancing plague".<ref name = "DirkBlom">Dirk Blom.</ref>{{rp |125}}  The term was coined by [[Paracelsus]],<ref name = "DirkBlom" />{{rp |126}} and the condition was initially considered a curse sent by a saint,<ref name = lancet /> usually [[St John the Baptist]]<ref name = "Midelfort">Midelfort.</ref>{{rp |32}} or [[St Vitus]], and was therefore known as "St Vitus' Dance" or "St John's Dance". Victims of dancing mania often ended their processions at places dedicated to that saint,<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}} who was prayed to in an effort to end the dancing;<ref name= "DirkBlom" />{{rp |126}} incidents often broke out around the time of the feast of St Vitus.<ref name = "Marks">Marks.</ref>{{rp |201}}  

St Vitus' Dance was diagnosed, in the 17th century, as [[Sydenham chorea]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/sydenham/sydenham.htm |title=NINDS Sydenham Chorea Information Page |work= NINDS | publisher = NIH | location = USA | accessdate = 4 September 2010}}</ref> Dancing mania has also been known as epidemic chorea<ref name= "DirkBlom" />{{rp |125}} and epidemic dancing.<ref name= lancet /> A disease of the nervous system, [[chorea (disease)|chorea]] is characterized by symptoms resembling those of dancing mania,<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |134}} which has also rather unconvincingly been considered a form of [[epilepsy]].<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |32}}  Scientists have described dancing mania as a "collective mental disorder", "[[Mass hysteria|collective hysterical disorder]]", and "mass madness".<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}}

==Outbreaks==
The earliest known outbreak of dancing mania occurred in the 7th&nbsp;century,<ref name=oxford>{{cite journal |author= Schullian, DM |year= 1977 |title= The Dancing Pilgrims at Muelebeek | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=315–9 |pmid=326865}}</ref> and it reappeared many times across Europe until about the 17th&nbsp;century, when it stopped abruptly.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp | 132}}  One of the earliest known incidents occurred sometime in the 1020s in [[Bernburg]], where 18&nbsp;peasants began singing and dancing around a church, disturbing a [[Christmas Eve]] service.<ref name = "Marks">Marks.</ref>{{rp | 202}} 

Further outbreaks occurred during the 13th century, including one in 1237 in which a large group of children travelled from [[Erfurt]] to [[Arnstadt]], jumping and dancing all the way,<ref name = "Marks" />{{rp |201}} in marked similarity to the legend of the ''[[Pied Piper of Hamelin]]''.<ref name=oxford /> Another incident, in 1278, involved about 200&nbsp;people dancing on a bridge over the [[Meuse (river)|River Meuse]] in Germany, resulting in its collapse. Many of the survivors were restored to full health at a nearby chapel dedicated to St Vitus.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |134}} The first major outbreak of the mania occurred between 1373 and 1374, with incidents reported in England, Germany and the Netherlands.<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |33}} 

On 24&nbsp;June 1374, one of the biggest outbreaks began in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]], Aachen (now [[Germany]]),<ref name= "DirkBlom" />{{rp |126}} before spreading to other places such as [[Cologne]], [[Flanders]], [[Franconia]], [[County of Hainaut | Hainaut]], [[Metz]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Tongeren]], [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]],<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |33}} and to countries such as Italy and [[Luxembourg]].  Further episodes occurred in 1375 and 1376, with incidents in France, Germany and [[Holland]],<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp | 138}} and in 1381 there was an outbreak in [[Augsburg]].<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |33}} Further incidents occurred in 1418 in [[Strasbourg]], where people fasted for days and the outbreak was possibly caused by exhaustion.<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp | 137}}  In another outbreak, in 1428 in [[Schaffhausen]], a monk danced to death and, in the same year, a group of women in [[Zurich]] were reportedly in a dancing frenzy.  

One of the biggest outbreaks occurred in July 1518, in [[Strasbourg]] (see [[Dancing Plague of 1518]]), where a woman named Frau Troffea began dancing in the street; within four days she had been joined by 33&nbsp;others, and within a month there were 400, many of whom suffered heart attacks and died.<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |33}}  Further incidents occurred during the 16th century, when the mania was at its peak: in 1536 in [[Basel]], involving a group of children; and in 1551 in [[Anhalt]], involving just one man.<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp | 37}}  In the 17th century, incidents of recurrent dancing were recorded by professor of medicine Gregor Horst, who noted:

{{quote |Several women who annually visit the chapel of St. Vitus in Drefelhausen... dance madly all day and all night until they collapse in ecstasy.  In this way they come to themselves again and feel little or nothing until the next May, when they are again... forced around St. Vitus' Day to betake themselves to that place... [o]ne of these women is said to have danced every year for the past twenty years, another for a full thirty-two.<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |39}}}}

Dancing mania appears to have completely died out by the mid-17th century.<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp | 46}}  According to John Waller, although numerous incidents were recorded, the best documented cases are the outbreaks of 1374 and 1518, for which there is abundant contemporary evidence.<ref name = lancet>{{cite journal |author= Waller J |title=A forgotten plague: making sense of dancing mania |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9664 |pages=624–5 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19238695 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60386-X |url= http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2960386-X/fulltext}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
The outbreaks of dancing mania varied, and several characteristics of it have been recorded.  Generally occurring in times of hardship,<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}} up to tens of thousands of people would appear to dance for hours,<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |133}}<ref name="waller-psychologist">{{cite journal| format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_22-editionID_177-ArticleID_1541-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist%5C0709look.pdf | title = Looking Back: Dancing plagues and mass hysteria| author = Waller, John| journal = The Psychologist| location = UK| publisher = British Psychological Society | volume = 22| issue = 7| month = July| year = 2009| pages = 644–7}}</ref> days, weeks, and even months.<ref name=lancet /><ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |132}}  

Women have often been portrayed in modern literature as the usual participants in dancing mania, although contemporary sources suggest otherwise.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |139}}  Whether the dancing was spontaneous, or an organised event, is also debated.<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |138}}  What is certain, however, is that dancers seemed to be in a state of unconsciousness,<ref name= "Marks" />{{rp |201}} and unable to control themselves.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}}

In his research into social phenomena, author Robert Bartholomew notes that contemporary sources record that participants often did not reside where the dancing took place. Such people would travel from place to place, and others would join them along the way. With them they brought customs and behaviour that were strange to the local people.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |137}}  Bartholomew describes how dancers wore "strange, colorful attire" and "held wooden sticks".<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |132}}  

Robert Marks, in his study of hypnotism, notes that some decorated their hair with [[garland]]s.<ref name= "Marks" />{{rp |201}}  However, not all outbreaks involved foreigners, and not all were particularly calm. Bartholomew notes that some "paraded around naked"<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |132}} and made "obscene gestures".<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |133}}  Some even had sexual intercourse.<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}}  Others acted like animals,<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |133}} and jumped,<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |32}} hopped and leaped about.<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |33}}  

They hardly stopped,<ref name= "waller-psychologist" /> and some danced until they broke their ribs and subsequently died.<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |32}}  Throughout, dancers screamed, laughed, or cried,<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |132}} and some sang.<ref name= "Vuillier">Vuillier.</ref>{{rp |60}}  Bartholomew also notes that observers of dancing mania were sometimes treated violently if they refused to join in.<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |139}}  Participants demonstrated odd reactions to the colour red; in ''A History of Madness in Sixteenth-Century Germany'', Midelfort notes they "could not perceive the color red at all",<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |32}} and Bartholomew reports "it was said that dancers could not stand... the color red, often becoming violent on seeing [it]".  

Bartholomew also notes that dancers "could not stand pointed shoes", and that dancers enjoyed their feet being hit.<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |133}}  Throughout, those affected by dancing mania suffered from a variety of ailments, including chest pains, convulsions, hallucinations, hyperventilation,<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}} epileptic fits,<ref name= "DirkBlom" />{{rp |126}} and visions.<ref name= "Hetherington">Hetherington.</ref>{{rp |71}}  In the end, most simply dropped down, overwhelmed with exhaustion.<ref name = "DirkBlom" />{{rp |126}}  Midelfort, however, describes how some ended up in a state of ecstasy.<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |39}}  Typically, the mania was contagious but it often struck small groups, such as families, and individuals.<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |37–8}}

=== Tarantism ===

{{See|Tarantism}}
In Italy, a similar phenomenon was [[tarantism]], in which the victims were said to have been poisoned by a [[tarantula]] or [[scorpion]]. Its earliest known outbreak was in the 13th century, and the only antidote known was to dance to particular music to separate the venom from the blood.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |133}}  It occurred only in the summer months. As with dancing mania, people would suddenly begin to dance, sometimes affected by a perceived bite or sting and were joined by others, who believed the venom from their own old bites was reactivated by the heat or the music.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |134}}  Dancers would perform a [[tarantella]], accompanied by music which would eventually "cure" the victim, at least temporarily.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |135}}  

Some participated in further activities, such as tying themselves up with vines and whipping each other, pretending to sword fight, drinking large amounts of wine, and jumping into the sea.  Some died if there was no music to accompany their dancing.  Sufferers typically had symptoms resembling those of dancing mania, such as headaches, trembling, twitching and visions.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |134}}  

As with dancing mania, participants apparently did not like the colour black,<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |133}} and women were reported to be most affected.<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}}  Unlike dancing mania, tarantism was confined to Italy and southern Europe.  It was common until the 17th century, but ended suddenly, with only very small outbreaks in Italy until as late as 1959.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |134}}  

A study of the phenomenon in 1959 by religious history professor Ernesto de Martino revealed that most cases of tarantism were probably unrelated to spider bites.  Many participants admitted that they had not been bitten, but believed they were infected by someone who had been, or that they had simply touched a spider.  The result was mass panic, with a "cure" that allowed people to behave in ways that were, normally, prohibited at the time.<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |135}}  Despite their differences, tarantism and dancing mania are often considered synonymous.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |134}}

==Reactions==
[[File:Dance at Molenbeek.jpg|thumb|250px|Music was typically played during outbreaks of dancing mania, as it was thought to remedy the problem. A painting by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], after drawings by his father.]]
As the real cause of dancing mania was unknown, many of the treatments for it were simply hopeful guesses, although some did seem effective. The 1374 outbreak occurred only decades after the [[Black Death]], and was treated in a similar fashion: dancers were isolated, and some were exorcised.<ref name = "Hetherington" />{{rp |70}}  People believed that the dancing was a curse brought about by St&nbsp;Vitus;<ref name="waller-psychologist" /> they responded by praying<ref name= "DirkBlom" />{{rp |126}} and making pilgrimages to places dedicated to Vitus.<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |34}}  

Prayers were also made to [[St John the Baptist]], who others believed also caused the dancing.<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |32}}  Others claimed to be possessed by demons,<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}} or [[Satan]],<ref name="waller-psychologist" /> therefore [[exorcism]]s were often performed on dancers.<ref name = "Vuillier" />{{rp |60}}  Bartholomew notes that music was often played while participants danced, as that was believed to be an effective remedy,<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}} and during some outbreaks musicians were even employed to play.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |139}}  Midelfort describes how the music encouraged others to join in however, and thus effectively made things worse, as did the dancing places that were sometimes set up.<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |35}}

==Explanations==
Numerous hypotheses have been proposed for the causes of dancing mania, and it remains unclear whether it was a real illness or a social phenomenon. One of the most prominent theories is that victims suffered from [[ergot]] poisoning, which was known as St Anthony's Fire in the Middle Ages. During floods and damp periods, ergots were able to grow and affect [[rye]] and other crops. [[Ergotism]] can cause hallucinations, but cannot account for the other strange behaviour most commonly identified with dancing mania.<ref name= "DirkBlom" />{{rp |126}}<ref name="waller-psychologist" /><ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |140}}<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |43}}  

Other theories suggest that the symptoms were similar to [[encephalitis]], [[epilepsy]], and [[typhus]], but as with ergotism, those conditions cannot account for all symptoms.<ref name = "DirkBlom" />{{rp |126}}  Numerous sources discuss how dancing mania, and tarantism, may have simply been the result of stress and tension caused by natural disasters around the time,<ref name = "Midelfort" />{{rp |43}} such as plagues and floods.<ref name = "Hetherington" />{{rp |72}}  Hetherington and Munro describe dancing mania as a result of "shared stress";<ref name= "Hetherington" />{{rp |73}} people may have danced to relieve themselves of the stress and poverty of the day,<ref name= "Hetherington" />{{rp |72}} and in so doing, attempted to become ecstatic and see visions.<ref>Feldman, p.191</ref>

Another popular theory is that the outbreaks were all staged,<ref name="Hetherington" />{{rp |71}} and the appearance of strange behaviour was due to its unfamiliarity.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |137}}  Religious cults may have been acting out well-organised dances, in accordance with ancient Greek and Roman rituals.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}}<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |137}}  Despite being banned at the time, these rituals could be performed under the guise of uncontrollable dancing mania.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |140}}  [[Justus Hecker]], a 19th-century medical writer, described it as a kind of festival, where a practice known as "the kindling of the Nodfyr" was carried out. This involved jumping through fire and smoke, in an attempt to ward off disease. Bartholomew notes how participants in this ritual would often continue to jump and leap long after the flames had gone.<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |139}}

It is certain that many participants of dancing mania were psychologically disturbed,<ref name = "Bartholomew" />{{rp |136}} but it is also likely that some took part out of fear,<ref name= "waller-psychologist" /> or simply wished to copy everyone else.<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |43}}  Sources agree that dancing mania was one of the earliest-recorded forms of [[mass hysteria]],<ref name= "Bartholomew" />{{rp |135}}<ref name= "Hetherington" />{{rp |73}} and describe it as a "psychic epidemic", with numerous explanations that might account for the behaviour of the dancers.<ref name= "Midelfort" />{{rp |43}}
