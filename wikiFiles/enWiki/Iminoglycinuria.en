== Pathophysiology ==
Glycine, proline and hydroxyproline share common [[Nephron#Renal tubule|renal tubular]] mechanisms of reabsorption,<ref name=omim/> a function specific to the [[proximal tubule]].<ref name=igaur/><ref name=ig05/> Both reabsorption or absorption of glycine and imino acids takes place respectively at the proximal tubule or intestinal [[brush border]] [[epithelium]]. The more selective transport of proline and other imino acids is driven at the molecular level by a [[mammal]]ian cellular transport mechanism aptly known as system IMINO.<ref name=ig05/><ref name=iag>{{cite journal |pmid=15632147 |year=2005 |month=Mar |author=Takanaga H, Mackenzie B, Suzuki Y, Hediger MA |title=Identification of mammalian proline transporter SIT1 (SLC6A20) with characteristics of classical system imino. |volume=280 |issue=10 |pages=8974–8984 |issn=0021-9258 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M413027200 |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15632147 |format=Free full text}}</ref><ref name=mouse>{{cite journal |pmid=15689184 |year=2005 |month=Mar |author=Kowalczuk S, Bröer A, Munzinger M, Tietzel N, Klingel K, Bröer S |title=Molecular cloning of the mouse IMINO system: an Na+- and Cl--dependent proline transporter. |volume=386 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=417–422 |issn=0264-6021 |pmc=1134859 |doi=10.1042/BJ20050100 |journal=The Biochemical journal |url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/386/0417/bj3860417.htm |format=Free full text}}</ref>

While no single genetic mutation has been established as the cause of iminoglycinuria; several mutations, affecting transport mechanisms shared by glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, as well as those that selectively transport either glycine or imino acids, including the IMINO system, are known to be associated with the disorder.<ref name=igaur/> When combined, these factors will result in a variable [[phenotype]] for iminoglycinuria depending on which mutations are present.<ref name=igaur/> However, despite the role that intestinal malabsorption of glycine and imino acids can play in iminoglycinuria, the primary defect disrupts their renal transport and reabsorption.<ref name=igaur/><ref name=ig71/> This is evident, as inherited iminoglycinuria can be clinically present with no intestinal involvement.<ref name=eye/>

In mammals, including [[human]]s, the transport of amino and imino acids from the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] (interior) of the intestine or the renal proximal tubule into the cells occurs at the brush border membrane of the epithelium (moist, tightly packed cellular lining of many [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (biology)|organs]] of the body). Here, [[cotransporter]]s such as [[sodium]] or [[chloride]] (part of the system of [[Na-K-Cl cotransporter]]s) couple with the amino or imino acids on the molecular level and transport them through specific [[integral membrane protein]]s that form [[ion channel]]s, which are located within the [[cell membrane]].<ref name=mouse/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9050235 |year=1997 |month=Jan |author=Castagna M, Shayakul C, Trotti D, Sacchi VF, Harvey WR, Hediger MA |title=Molecular characteristics of mammalian and insect amino acid transporters: implications for amino acid homeostasis. |volume=200 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=269–286 |issn=0022-0949 |journal=The Journal of experimental biology}}</ref> From the cells, the absorbed or reabsorbed amino and imino acids eventually reach the blood. Absorption refers to the overall process happening in the intestine in lieu of normal digestive breakdown of proteins, while reabsorption refers to the process occurring in the renal proximal tubule to reclaim amino and imino acids that have been filtered out of the blood via the [[glomerulus]].  

These forms of transport require energy, as the products being transported are usually moving against a higher [[concentration gradient]]. This process, called [[active transport]], get its energy from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and other ATP-related [[Co-transport|cotransport]] systems that produce energy, like the [[sodium-potassium pump]].

=== Mechanism ===

The primary defect associated with iminoglycinuria is a [[homozygous]] (recessive) mutation of the ''[[SLC36A2]]'' (PAT2) gene.<ref name=igaur/> One of several [[membrane transport proteins]] in the [[solute carrier family]] of amino acid transporters, PAT2 is the high-affinity renal transporter of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline found to be defective in both [[allele]]s when iminoglycinuria is present in an individual. This is in contrast to the fact that when only one PAT2 allele is defective, hyperglycinuria will be present instead of iminoglycinuria. These findings delineate iminoglycinuria as the homozygous form of hyperglycinuria, with the former having a higher degree of urinary excretion of glycine and imino acids correlating to mutations in both alleles.<ref name=igaur/><ref name=omim/>

Another mutation suspected to convey the iminoglycinuria phenotype may be found in the ''[[SLC36A1]]'' (PAT1) gene.<ref name=pat04>{{cite journal |pmid=15521011 |year=2004 |month=Nov |author=Anderson CM, Grenade DS, Boll M, Foltz M, Wake KA, Kennedy DJ, Munck LK, Miyauchi S, Taylor PM, Campbell FC, Munck BG, Daniel H, Ganapathy V, Thwaites DT |title=H+/amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) is the imino acid carrier: An intestinal nutrient/drug transporter in human and rat. |volume=127 |issue=5 |pages=1410–1422 |issn=0016-5085 |journal=Gastroenterology |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2004.08.017}}</ref><ref name=pat07>{{cite journal |pmid=17123464 |year=2007 |month=Feb |author=Thwaites DT, Anderson CM |title=Deciphering the mechanisms of intestinal imino (and amino) acid transport: the redemption of SLC36A1. |volume=1768 |issue=2 |pages=179–197 |issn=0006-3002 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.10.001 |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta}}</ref> Identified as the low-affinity intestinal transporter of glycine and imino acids, PAT1 works in cooperation with the renal [[sodium-hydrogen antiporter 3|sodium-hydrogen exchanger]] NHE3 (''[[SLC9A3]]'').<ref name=pat07/> As absorption and reabsorption of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline occurs through PAT1 as well, it is believed to play another role in expressing the malabsorptive iminoglycinuria phenotype. Recent reports, however, suggest a more diminished role from PAT1 in some cases of the disorder.<ref name=igaur/><ref name=ig05/><ref name=pat07/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16052352 |year=2006 |month=Jan |author=Bröer A, Cavanaugh JA, Rasko JE, Bröer S |title=The molecular basis of neutral aminoacidurias. |volume=451 |issue=4 |pages=511–517 |issn=0031-6768 |doi=10.1007/s00424-005-1481-8 |journal=Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology}}</ref>

While PAT2 is strongly indicated as the primary mutagen responsible for iminoglycinuria, the variability of the phenotype is found to be instituted by three modifying genetic mutations. The major one among these is believed to be system IMINO.<ref name=igaur/>

Defined as the sodium-dependant proline transporter not inhibited by [[alanine]], system IMINO, believed to be formed by the ''[[SLC6A20]]'' (SIT1) gene, is a crucial mammalian transport mechanism responsible for both renal reabsorption and intestinal absorption of proline and other imino acids, such as hydroxyproline and [[pipecolate]].<ref name=iag/><ref name=mouse/> The [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] sequence for SIT1 is expressed in a great deal of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], including the [[stomach]], [[duodenum]], [[jejunum]], [[ileum]], [[cecum]] and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. It is also found in the [[kidney]], optical choroid, and parts of the [[central nervous system]] such the [[brain]] and [[microglia]]l cells.<ref name=iag/>

Reduced [[penetrance]] is a phenomenon where a fully inherited genetic trait, such as a disease or disorder, fails to exhibit the expected phenotype. This has been reported in some cases of iminoglycinuria.<ref name=igaur/> Here, system IMINO is thought to play a role in reduced penetrance of iminoglycinuria by compensating for imino acid malabsorption related specifically to mutations of PAT2.<ref name=igaur/> Conversely, SIT1 mutations are believed to result in full expression of iminoglycinuria in some cases where heterozygous mutations of PAT2 would otherwise have only been sufficient to cause hyperglycinuria.<ref name=igaur/>

Two other transport systems are believed to play subsequent roles in iminoglycinuria, when mutations in them are present. The neutral amino acid transporter ''[[SLC6A19]]'' (affecting [[glycine]], [[proline]], and other neutral amino acids like [[cysteine]] and [[tryptophan]]), associated with [[Hartnup disease]], plays a role in iminoglycinuria as a modifier to PAT2 mutations and is also directly affected by the actions of SIT1.<ref name=igaur/><ref name=neut>{{cite journal |pmid=16234310 |year=2006 |month=Apr |author=Ristic Z, Camargo SM, Romeo E, Bodoy S, Bertran J, Palacin M, Makrides V, Furrer EM, Verrey F |title=Neutral amino acid transport mediated by ortholog of imino acid transporter SIT1/SLC6A20 in opossum kidney cells. |volume=290 |issue=4 |pages=F880–F887 |issn=0363-6127 |doi=10.1152/ajprenal.00319.2005 |journal=American journal of physiology. Renal physiology |url=http://ajprenal.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16234310 |format=Free full text}}</ref> The glycine-specific transporter, ''[[SLC6A18]]'', also has an effect on the iminoglycinuria phenotype by either compounding or compensating for failures of glycine transport.<ref name=igaur/>

To summarize, iminoglycinuria is primarily expressed by homozygous mutations of the PAT2 renal transporter, while the overall iminoglycinuria phenotype may be modified by normal or defective activity of SIT1 (IMINO), ''SLC6A19'' and ''SLC6A18''.<ref name=igaur/>

== Inheritance ==

[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Iminoglycinuria has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]         

Iminoglycinuria is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.<ref name=igaur/> This means a defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and inheritance requires two copies of the defective gene&mdash;one from each parent. Parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

A non-inherited cause of excess urinary excretion of proline and glycine, similar to that found in iminoglycinuria, is quite common to newborn infants younger than 6 months. Sometimes referred to as neonatal iminoglycinuria, it is due to underdevelopment of high-affinity transport mechanisms within the renal circuit, specifically PAT2, SIT1 and SLC6A18. The condition corrects itself with age.<ref name=igaur/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7110792 |year=1982 |month=Aug |author=Scriver CR, Arthus MF, Bergeron M |title=Neonatal iminoglycinuria: evidence that the prolinuria originates in selective deficiency of transport activity in the proximal nephron. |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=684–687 |issn=0031-3998 |journal=Pediatric research |doi=10.1203/00006450-198208000-00022}}</ref> In cases where this persists beyond childhood, however, inherited hyperglycinuria or iminoglycinuria may be suspected.<ref name=igaur/>
