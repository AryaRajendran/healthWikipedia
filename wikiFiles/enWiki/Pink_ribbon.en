The '''pink ribbon''' is an international symbol of [[breast cancer awareness]].  Pink ribbons, and the color [[pink]] in general, identify the wearer or promoter with the [[breast cancer brand]] and express [[moral support]] for women with [[breast cancer]]. Pink ribbons are most commonly seen during [[National Breast Cancer Awareness Month]].

==History==

The first known use of a pink ribbon in connection with breast cancer awareness was in the fall of 1991, when the [[Susan G. Komen Foundation]] handed out pink [[Ribbon (award)|ribbons]] to participants in its New York City race for breast [[cancer survivor]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkbeforeyoupink.org/Pages/PrettyInPink.html |title=Pretty in Pink |publisher=Thinkbeforeyoupink.org |date=1998-07 |accessdate=2009-06-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071218231238/http://thinkbeforeyoupink.org/Pages/PrettyInPink.html |archivedate = December 18, 2007}}</ref>

The pink ribbon was adopted as the official symbol of [[National Breast Cancer Awareness Month]] the next year, in 1992.<ref name=Sulik47>{{cite book

Estée Lauder and ''Self'' initially approached [[Charlotte Haley]], who had began a peach-coloured ribbon campaign to press the [[National Cancer Institute]] to increase its budget for cancer prevention research. Haley refused to be part of what she felt was a commercial effort, so Estée Lauder and ''Self'' changed the color of their ribbon to light pink in 2005, to circumvent Haley's efforts to stop them.<ref name=Barnard>{{cite news|last=Barnard|first=Linda|title=Pink Ribbons Inc. review: Not so pretty in pink|url=http://www.toronto.com/article/712145|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=Campbell>{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Marlo|title=We’ve been pinkwashed|url=http://www.uptownmag.com/news-and-views/and-another-thing/Weve-been-pinkwashed-138072903.html|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=[[Uptown (newspaper){{!}}Uptown]]|date=26 January 2012}}</ref>

A [[pink and blue ribbon]] is sometimes used to symbolize [[male breast cancer|breast cancer in men]], which is relatively rare. The pink and blue ribbon was designed in 1996 by Nancy Nick, president and founder of the John W. Nick Foundation to bring awareness that "Men Get Breast Cancer Too!"<ref>{{Cite web

==Meaning==
The color [[pink]] is considered feminine in modern Western countries.  It evokes traditional feminine [[gender role]]s, caring for other people, being beautiful, being good, and being cooperative.<ref name=Sulik47 />

The pink ribbon represents [[fear]] of breast cancer, [[hope]] for the future, and the charitable goodness of people and businesses who publicly support the breast cancer movement.<ref>Sulik, 2010.  pages 146–150.</ref>  It is intended to evoke solidarity with women who currently have breast cancer.

Breast cancer organizations use the pink ribbon to associate themselves with breast cancer, to promote breast cancer awareness, and to support fundraising.<ref>Sulik, 2010.  pages 124–125.</ref>  Some breast cancer-related organizations, such as Pink Ribbon International,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkribbon.com |title=Pink Ribbon International |publisher=Pinkribbon.com |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> use the pink ribbon as their primary symbol.  [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]] uses a stylized "running ribbon" as their logo.<ref>Sulik, 2010. p. 147.</ref>

While specifically representing [[breast cancer awareness]], the pink ribbon is also a [[symbol]] and a [[wikt:proxy|proxy]] of goodwill towards women in general.<ref>Sulik, 2010.  p. 112, 125, 132.</ref>  Buying, wearing, displaying, or sponsoring pink ribbons signals that the person or business cares about women.  The pink ribbon is a marketing [[brand]] for businesses that allows them to promote themselves with women and identify themselves as being socially aware.<ref>Sulik, 2010.  p. 67, 132.</ref>  Compared to other women's issues, promoting [[breast cancer awareness]] is politically safe.<ref>{{cite book

==Products==
Each October, hundreds, if not thousands, of products are emblazoned with pink ribbons, colored pink, or otherwise sold with a promise of a small portion of the total cost being donated to support breast cancer awareness or research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/10/06/Tampabay/All_may_not_be_in_the.shtml |title=Tampabay: All may not be in the pink |publisher=Sptimes.com |date=2006-10-06 |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref>

The first breast cancer awareness stamp in the U.S., featuring a pink ribbon, was issued 1996. As it did not sell well, a [[breast cancer research stamp|new stamp]] with an emphasis on research was designed. The new stamp does not feature the pink ribbon.

In Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint produced a silver commemorative breast cancer coin.<ref>[http://www.mint.ca/royalcanadianmintpublic/]</ref> 15,000 coins were minted during 2006. On one side of the coin, a portrait of Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]] is illustrated, while on the other side a pink ribbon has been enameled. Additionally, 30 million 25-cent coins were minted with pink ribbons during 2006 for normal circulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060331/pink_coin_060331/20060331?hub=Health |title=Pink coin to raise breast cancer awareness |publisher=CTV.ca |date=2006-03-31 |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> Designed by the mint's director of engraving, Cosme Saffioti, this colored coin is the second in history to be put into regular circulation.<ref>[http://lifewise.canoe.ca/Style/2006/04/04/pf-1519402.html ]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}</ref>

==Intellectual property status==
In most jurisdictions, the pink ribbon is considered [[public domain]]. However, in Canada, the [[Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation]] claims ownership of the ribbon as an [[official mark]], a special form of [[trademark]] reserved for governmental and charitable organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alive.com/1526a4a2.php?subject_bread_cramb=351 |title=Borage for Breasts :: breast cancer |publisher=Alive.com |date=2003-10 |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref>

==Uses==
* In 2000, NABCO paid [[Namco]] to put the pink ribbon on Ms. Pac-Man.
* On Sunday, October 10, 2010, all [[King Features Syndicate]] comic strips were printed in shades of red and pink, with the ribbon appearing prominently in one panel.

==Criticism==
The Pink ribbon campaign is frequently used in [[cause-related marketing]], a cooperation between non-profits and businesses to promote a product that also supports a cause. Because the pink ribbon is not licensed by any corporation, it is more open to being abused by businesses that donate little or none of their revenue to breast cancer research. While companies such as Estée Lauder have distributed over 70 million pink ribbons, and donated over $25 million to breast cancer research, other companies have been discovered using the pink ribbon inappropriately—either by not donating their profits, or by using the pink ribbon on products that include ingredients which cause cancer.<ref name="J Am Coll Radiol">{{cite journal|last=A.

===Pinkwashing===
{{seealso|Breast cancer awareness#Shopping for the cure}}

The misuse of marketing campaigns by businesses using the pink ribbon on their products have been described as ''pinkwashing'', a [[portmanteau]] of ''pink ribbon'' and [[whitewash (censorship)|''whitewash'']], which was coined by [[Breast Cancer Action]]. They use the term to highlight companies or products which feature a pink ribbon without donating more than a negligible or token amount of money to a charity or with no transparency regarding where the funds are going. 

It also describes the use of a pink ribbon on products with known or suspected links to cancer.<ref name="Forbes">{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/amywestervelt/2011/11/04/the-pinkwashing-debate-empty-criticism-or-serious-liability/|title=The Pinkwashing Debate: Empty Criticism or Serious Liability?|last=Westervelt|first=Amy|date=11-04-2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>
