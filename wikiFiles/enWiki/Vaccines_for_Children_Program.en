The '''Vaccines for Children Program''' (VFC) is a [[Federal government of the United States|federally]] funded program in the United States providing no-cost vaccines to children who lack [[health insurance]] or who cannot otherwise afford the cost of the vaccination. The VFC program was created by the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] and is required to be a new entitlement of each state's [[Medicaid]] plan. The program was officially implemented in October 1994.<ref name="VFCCDC">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/default.htm |title=Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |work=Vaccines & Immunizations |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref>

==History==
From 1989 through 1991, a [[measles]] [[epidemic]] in the United States resulted in several tens of thousands of cases of measles and hundreds of deaths. Upon investigation, CDC found that more than half of the children who had measles had not been immunized, despite seeing a health care provider.<ref name="pmid8273330">{{cite journal |author=Dales LG, Kizer KW, Rutherford GW, Pertowski CA, Waterman SH, Woodford G |title=Measles epidemic from failure to immunize |journal=West. J. Med. |volume=159 |issue=4 |pages=455â€“64 |year=1993 |month=October |pmid=8273330 |pmc=1022280 }}</ref>

In partial response to that epidemic, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) on August 10, 1993, creating the VFC Program. It became operational October 1, 1994 and is known as section 1928 of the [[Social Security Act]], the VFC program is an [[entitlement]]  for eligible children, age 18 and below.

==Program==

The VFC program is funded through an approval by the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), and the funds are allocated to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). The CDC buys vaccines at a discount directly from manufacturers and distributes them to state health departments and certain local and territorial public health agencies.  The agencies then redistribute the vaccines at no cost to those private physicians' offices and public health clinics that are registered as VFC program providers.<ref name="VFCCDC"/>

==Patient eligibility==

Children and adolescents are eligible if it is before their 19th birthday and they meet one or more of the following criteria:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/parents/default.htm#eligible |title=Which children are eligible? |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref>
* [[Medicaid]]-eligible 
* Uninsured (lacking health insurance)
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] or [[Alaska Native]]
* Underinsured, that is, a child that is covered by some type of health insurance, but the insurance either does not cover any vaccines, covers only certain vaccines, or does cover some vaccines, but has a cap on the annual cost for vaccines.

==Covered vaccines==

The [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) makes recommendations to the VFC program as to what are the most appropriate selection of vaccines and related agents for control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States.<ref name="ACIP">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/acip-vfc-resolutions.htm#about |title=About the ACIP |work=Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref>  VFC resolutions passed by the ACIP form the basis for VFC program policies on vaccine availability and usage.  They may not necessarily match the general usage recommendations of the ACIP, but rather represent the rules that providers must follow for administering each specific vaccine under the VFC program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/acip-vfc-resolutions.htm#addresol |title=Adding Vaccines to the VFC Program |work=Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref>
