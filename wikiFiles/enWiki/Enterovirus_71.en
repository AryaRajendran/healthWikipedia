==Evolution==

This virus is a member of the enterovirus species A. This virus appears to have evolved only recently with the first known strain isolated in 1965. It was associated with an outbreak of neurological disease in the United States in 1969. It spread then to Europe with outbreaks there in Bulgaria (1975) and Hungary (1978). It has since spread to various countries in Asia where it has been responsible for several outbreaks, most recently in [[Cambodia]] (2012). 

The strains fall into three taxa - named A, B and C. Both the B and C clades have been subdivided into B1-B5 and C1-C5. The C taxon appears to have evolved ~1970 while the A and B taxa evolved prior to this. 

An analysis of strains isolated in [[Europe]] ([[Austria]], [[France]] and [[Germany]]) showed that the clades  C1b and C2b originated in 1994 (95% confidence interval 1992.7-1995.8) and 2002 (95% confidence interval 2001.6-2003.8) respectively.<ref name=Mirand2009>{{cite journal | author = Mirand A, Schuffenecker I, Henquell C, Billaud G, Jugie G, Falcon D, Mahul A, Archimbaud C, Terletskaia-Ladwig E ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Phylogenetic evidence for a recent spread of two populations of human enterovirus 71 in European countries | url = | journal = J Gen Virol | volume = 91 | issue = 9| pages = 2263–2277 }}</ref>

==Virology==

The receptors for EV71 and CVA16 have been identified as [[P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1]] and scavenger receptor class B, member 2 ([[SCARB2]]); both are transmembrane proteins.<ref name=Nishimura2012>{{cite journal | author = Nishimura Y, Shimizu H | year = 2012 | title = Cellular receptors for human enterovirus species A. | url = | journal = Front Microbio | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 105 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00105 }}</ref>

==Pathology==
"The Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection may be asymptomatic or it may cause diarrhea, rashes, and [[hand, foot and mouth disease]] (HFMD). However, EV71 also has the potential to cause severe neurological disease. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the host response to EV71 infection. [...] EV71 infection led to increases in the level of mRNAs encoding chemokines, proteins involved in protein degradation, complement proteins, and proapoptotis proteins."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shih SR, Stollar V, Lin JY, Chang SC, Chen GW, Li ML |title=Identification of genes involved in the host response to enterovirus 71 infection |journal=J.

"Enterovirus 71 (EV71), one of the major causative agents for hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), is sometimes associated with severe central nervous system diseases. In 1997, in Malaysia and Japan, and in 1998 in Taiwan, there were HFMD epidemics involving sudden death among young children, and EV71 was isolated from the HFMD patients, including the fatal cases. The nucleotide sequences of each EV71 isolate were determined and compared by phylogenetical analysis. EV71 strains from previously reported epidemics belonged to genotype A-1, while those from recent epidemics could be divided into two genotypes, A-2 and B."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shimizu H, Utama A, Yoshii K, ''et al.'' |title=Enterovirus 71 from fatal and nonfatal cases of hand, foot and mouth disease epidemics in Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan in 1997–1998 |journal=Jpn. J. Infect. Dis. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=12–5 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=10808253 }}</ref>

"Ever since the 1980s, large and small EV71 [[epidemic]]s caused by distinct genotypes have occurred in [[Asia]]n countries and regions sharing trade with [[China]]. In [[Hong Kong]], sporadic EV71 infections with incidences of [[monoplegia]] were reported in 1987, and a fatal case was documented in 2001. A large outbreak of HFMD due to EV71 infection occurred in [[Taiwan in 1998]], including 129,106 case reports, 405 children with severe complications, and more than 80 deaths. After 1998, smaller EV71 epidemics occurred almost annually in Taiwan, primarily associated with EV71 viruses of genotypes C2 and B4. In [[Malaysia]], EV71 outbreaks occurred in 1997 and 2000, mainly associated with genotypes B3 and B4. Since 1997, EV71 epidemics (genotypes B and C) have been reported annually in Singapore, with genotype B4 forming the predominant causative agent of a large outbreak in 2000 (5). In Korea, an EV71 epidemic in 2000 was caused by a relatively new genotype, C3, which has only rarely been identified outside of Korea in recent years (10). Thus, the EV71 genotypes of these HFMD epidemics seem to be regionally and temporally unrestricted."<ref name=China>1</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no [[vaccine]] or [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] agent known to be effective in treating or preventing EV71 infection. Experimental vaccines and antiviral agents are being worked on.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Feng-Cai|coauthors=Liang, Zheng-Lun; Li, Xiu-Ling; Ge, Heng-Ming; Meng, Fan-Yue; Mao, Qun-Ying; Zhang, Yun-Tao; Hu, Yue-Mei; Zhang, Zhen-Yu; Li, Jing-Xin; Gao, Fan; Chen, Qing-Hua; Zhu, Qi-Yan; Chu, Kai; Wu, Xing; Yao, Xin; Guo, Hui-Jie; Chen, Xiao-Qin; Liu, Pei; Dong, Yu-Ying; Li, Feng-Xiang; Shen, Xin-Liang; Wang, Jun-Zhi|title=Immunogenicity and safety of an enterovirus 71 vaccine in healthy Chinese children and infants: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial|journal=The Lancet|date=NaN undefined NaN|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61764-4|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2961764-4/fulltext?elsca1=ETOC-LANCET&elsca2=email&elsca3=E24A35F}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |author=Tung WS, Bakar SA, Sekawi Z, Rosli R |title=DNA vaccine constructs against enterovirus 71 elicit immune response in mice |journal=Genet Vaccines Ther |volume=5 |page=6 |year=2007 |pmid=17445254 |doi=10.1186/1479-0556-5-6 |url=http://www.gvt-journal.com/content/5//6 |pmc=3225814}}</ref> For example, "both [[bovine]] and human [[lactoferrin]]s were found to be potent inhibitors of EV71 infection"<ref name=lac/> and "[[ribavirin]] could be a potential anti-EV71 drug."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li ZH, Li CM, Ling P, ''et al.'' |title=Ribavirin reduces mortality in enterovirus 71-infected mice by decreasing viral replication |journal=J.

==Research==
A joint UK and Chinese team working at the [[UK]]'s national synchrotron facility near [[Oxford]] determined the structure of EV71 in 2012. Researchers observed movements resembling breathing in the virus, and found that this accompanied the infection process, together with a small molecule picked up from the body's cells and used to switch state. This particular molecule must be discarded in order to start an infection, and new research will be aimed at creating a synthetic replica that would bond strongly to the virus and stop the infection process. <ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21481223</ref><ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21531550</ref>

==Outbreaks==

===Cambodia===
From April through July 2012, at least 64 children died and two survived from a disease affecting  children under 7 years old in [[Cambodia]]. Most died within 24 hours and had exhibited symptoms including respiratory illnesses, fever and generalized neurological abnormalities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kwok|first=Yenni|title=Mystery illness claims dozens of Cambodian children|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/05/world/asia/cambodia-mystery-illness/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 July 2012|date=5 July 2012}}</ref> 
An initial sampling taken from 24 patients found that 15 tested positive for EV71 on July 6, 2012. The [[World Health Organization]] noted that the cause of the outbreak has not been fully solved and that more analysis was needed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Officials make break in baffling disease killing Cambodian children|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/08/world/asia/cambodia-children-disease/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 July 2012|date=8 July 2012}}</ref>

On 15 July 2012 it was announced that no further cases had been noted in Cambodia, and that the deaths were a result of a combination of infections with EV 71, [[Dengue fever]], and [[Streptococcus suis]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/10/world/asia/cambodia-children-disease/index.html?hpt=wo_c1 |title=Mystery illness in Cambodia solved, doctors say |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref> and the use of [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] in the treatment of the infections.

===Taiwan===

Enteroviruses were isolated from a total of 1,892 patients in this laboratory during this period. Of the virus
isolates, enterovirus 71 (EV71) was diagnosed in 44.4% of the patients (132 of 297) in 1998, 2% (13 of 646) in
1999, and 20.5% (195 of 949) in 2000. Genetic analyses of the 5�-untranslated{{clarify|date=December 2011}} and VP1 regions of EV71 isolates
by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing were performed to understand the diversity of EV71 in these
outbreaks of HFMD. Most EV71 isolates from the 1998 epidemic belonged to genotype C, while only one-tenth
of the isolates were genotype B. Interestingly, all EV71 isolates tested from 1999 to 2000 belonged to genotype
B. This study indicated that two genogroups of EV71 capable of inducing severe clinical illness have been
circulating in Taiwan. Furthermore, the predominant EV71 genotypes responsible for each of the two major
HFMD outbreaks within the 3-year period in Taiwan were different.

Significant outbreaks of the Enterovirus 71 (EV71) occurred in 1998, 2000 and 2001 with 78 deaths in 1998, 25 in 2000 and 26 in 2001. There are two patterns observed in outbreaks of the virus where they may be small with occasional cases resulting in death or they are severe with a high fatality rate.  The 1998 outbreak came in two waves to Taiwan. The first wave reached its peak of fatalities in the week of June 7 with cases in all four regions of Taiwan. There were approximately 405 severe cases and 91% of fatal cases were children of under the age of five.<ref name="Lin 2003">{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=Tzou-Yien|title=Enterovirus 71 outbreaks, Taiwan: Occurance and Recognition|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2003|month=March|accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref> After further investigation into the fatalities among children 16% were six months or younger, 43% were from seven to twelve months meaning it was more fatal for children under the age of one. 65 out of 78 patients died from pulmonary edema or haemorrhage making it the most lethal effect which results from the virus.<ref name="Ho 1999">{{cite journal|last=Ho|first=Monto|title=An Epidemic of Enterovirus 71 in Taiwan|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=23|year=1999|month=September|volume=10|issue=341|accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref> The second wave occurred in the week of October 4 and had fewer cases that were more confined to Southern Taiwan. Total number of cases of Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) and herpangina in Taiwan was 129,106.

'''The Development and Detection of the Enterovirus 71 in Taiwan
'''

The outbreaks of the Enterovirus 71 in Taiwan and the number of cases and fatalities that resulted became an indication of the significance of the threat of the virus. New anti-viral drugs should be developed and vaccination of children under five years old should be considered in areas the virus is more susceptive.<ref name="Lin 2003"/> In July 1989 a sentinel surveillance system for infectious diseases was established in Taiwan by Disease, Surveillance and Quarantine Service, Ministry of Health of Taiwan. The sentinel surveillance system is physician based and has approximately 850 Taiwanese physicians participating from various regions all over Taiwan. Public health officers contact the physicians on a weekly basis collecting disease information and on the occasion where there is a suspected outbreak of an infectious disease they are responsible for public notification. After the observed outbreak of HFMD and herpangina in Malaysia in 1997, they were included in the detection system.<ref name="Wu 1999 458–460">{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Trong-Neng|title=Sentinal Surveillance for Enterovirus 71, Taiwan, 1998|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=1999|month=May–June|volume=5|issue=3|pages=458–460|accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref>

In March 1998, under the sentinel surveillance system, it was noticed that there was an increasing amount of HFMD cases and herpangina in Taiwan. By the end of April that year, numbers of cases involving children HFMD had increased significantly.<ref name="Lin 2003"/> Due to the presence of a possible threat of an epidemic a warning was released on May 12 for the virus and preventative measures were advised to the public such as practicing better hygiene and isolating infected children. Although public notification had been given and preventatives taken, the number of HFMD cases continued to rise. On May 29 another report system, based on hospitals rather than just physicians, was developed in response to this where all severe and fatal cases were more carefully monitored from 597 hospital and medical centres.<ref name="Wu 1999 458–460"/> 

Exact reasons behind the outbreaks are hard to and yet to be defined however through the reporting systems developed, detection of the virus is of large significance and gives way for further study and investigation. Possible reasons behind the developments of the outbreaks are that the virus may have mutated with increased virulence made it more easily contractible or that the population and genetics became more susceptible to contraction of the disease.<ref name="Wu 1999 458–460"/> Studies for serial serum antibody titers to the Enterovirus 71 in blood samples taken yearly from 81 children born in 1988 was conducted from 1989 to 1994 and 1997 to 1999. They discovered an increase in EV71 seroconversion (increased susceptibility to the disease) from 3% to 11% from 1989 to 1997 and by 1997 68% of the children had evidence of being infected by the virus. The virus was also evident in HFMD patients from as early on as 1981.<ref name="Lin 2003"/> Other studies conducted in early 1999 showed that half the adult population of Taiwan had antibodies against the enterovirus 71 prior to the 1998 outbreak meaning the population of children were more susceptible to the virus.<ref name="Ho 1999"/> It is possible that prior to the outbreak in 1998 there were severe and fatal cases that went unrecognised as EV71 cases in children who died of unexplained illnesses and studies are still ongoing.<ref name="Lin 2003"/><ref name=Taiwan/>
