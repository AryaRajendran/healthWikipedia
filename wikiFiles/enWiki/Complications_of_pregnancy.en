'''Complications of pregnancy''' are the symptoms and problems that are associated with [[pregnancy]]. There are both routine problems and serious, even potentially fatal problems. The routine problems are normal complications, and pose no significant danger to either the woman or the [[fetus]]. Serious problems can cause both [[maternal death]] and [[fetal death]] if untreated.

==Maternal routine problems==
===[[Back pain]]===
* Common, particularly in the third trimester when the patient's center of gravity has shifted.
* ''Treatment'': mild exercise, gentle [[massage]], heating pads, [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), and (in severe cases) [[muscle relaxant]]s or [[narcotic]]s

===[[Carpal tunnel syndrome]]===
* Occurs in between an estimated 21% to 62% of cases, possibly due to [[edema]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mondelli M, Rossi S, Monti E, ''et al.'' |title=Long term follow-up of carpal tunnel syndrome during pregnancy: a cohort study and review of the literature |journal=Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=259–71 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17918501 }}</ref>

===[[Constipation]]===
* ''Cause'': decreased bowel motility secondary to elevated [[progesterone]] (normal in pregnancy), which causes the "[[smooth muscle]]" along the walls of the [[intestines]] to relax. Thus, making sure that the future mother will absorb as much [[nutrients]] from her diet as possible in order to nourish the [[fetus]] and herself. As a side effect the feces can get extremely dehydrated and hard to pass.<ref>[http://constipationduringpregnancy.net/ ConstipationDuringPregnancy.net]</ref>
* ''Treatment'': increased PO fluids, stool softeners, [[bulking agents]] Drinking plenty of water and eating fruit and fiber enriched foods often help

A woman experiencing sudden [[defecation]] should report this to her [[obstetrics|practitioner]].

===Contractions===
* occasional, irregular, painless contractions that occur several times per day are normal and are known as [[Braxton Hicks contraction]]s
* ''Caused by'': dehydration
* ''Treatment'': fluid intake
* regular contractions (every 10–15 min) are a sign of [[preterm labor]] and should be assessed by [[colposcopy|cervical exam]].

===Dehydration===
* ''Caused by'': expanded intravascular space and increased [[Fluid_compartments#Third_spacing|Third spacing of fluids]]
* ''Treatment'': fluid intake
* ''Complication'': uterine contractions, which may occur because dehydration causes body release of [[antidiuretic hormone|ADH]], which is similar to [[oxytocin]] in structure. Oxytocin itself can cause uterine contractions and thus ADH can cross-react with oxytocin receptors and also cause contractions.

===Edema===
* ''Caused by'': compression of the [[inferior vena cava]] (IVC) and pelvic veins by the [[uterus]] leads to increased hydrostatic pressure in lower extremities.
* ''Treatment'': raising legs above the heart, patient sleeps on her side.

===[[Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease]] (GERD)===
* ''Caused by'': relaxation of the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES) and increased transit time in the stomach (normal in pregnancy)
* ''Treatment'': antacids, multiple small meals a day, avoid lying down within an hour of eating, H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors

===[[Hemorrhoid]]s===
* ''Caused by'': increased venous stasis and IVC compression leading to congestion in venous system along with increased abdominal pressure secondary to constipation.
* ''Treatment'': topical anesthetics, steroids, treatment of constipation

===[[Pica (disorder)|Pica]]===
* cravings for nonedible items such as dirt or clay. Caused by Iron deficiency which is normal during pregnancy and can be overcome with Iron supplements, [[prenatal vitamins]] or if severe enough [[parenteral iron]]

===[[Lower abdominal pain]]===
* ''Caused by'': rapid expansion of the [[uterus]] and stretching of ligaments such as the [[round ligament]].
* ''Treatment'': [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen)(kulot)

===Increased urinary frequency===
* ''Caused by'': increased intravascular volume, elevated GFR ([[glomerular filtration rate]]), and compression of the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] by the expanding uterus. Patients are advised to continue fluid intake despite this. [[Urinalysis]] and culture should be ordered to rule out infection, which can also cause increased urinary frequency but typically is accompanied by [[dysuria]] (pain when urinating).

===[[Varicose veins]]===
* ''Caused by'': relaxation of the venous [[smooth muscle]] and increased intravascular pressure.
* ''Treatment'': elevation of the legs, pressure stockings
* relieve swelling and pain with warm sitz bath.
* Avoid obesity, lengthy standing or sitting, constrictive clothing and constipation and bearing down with bowel movements

===''[[Diastasis recti]]'' or abdominal separation===
During pregnancy, many women experience a separation of their stomach muscles, known as diastasis recti. In order to understand this condition, it is important to understand the muscle that it affects. This particular condition affects the rectus abdominis muscle, that muscle that gives you a “six pack”. (See figure)

The rectus abdominis muscle is divided down the middle by the tendinous line called the linea alba.<ref>{{cite book |author=Saladin, Kenneth S. |title=Anatomy & Physiology: the Unity of Form and Function |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York NY |year=2012 |edition=6th}}</ref> It is kept in line by your transverse abdominal and your oblique abdominal muscles. During pregnancy, the growth of the fetus exerts pressure on abdominal cavity muscles, in particular the rectus abdominis. In pregnancies that experience rapid fetus growth or women with particularly weak abdominal muscles, this pressure can sometimes causes the rectus abdominis muscle to separate along the linea alba, creating a split between the left and right sides of the rectus abdominis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Separated Muscles |date=2011 |work=Pregnancy Info: Birth, Baby, and Maternity Advice |url=http://www.pregnancy-info.net/separated_muscles.html}}</ref>

About one-third of all pregnant women experience diastasis recti at some point in their pregnancy, however it is much more likely to occur during the second trimester or third trimester of pregnancy. However, separation also frequently occurs during labor and delivery, or with women carrying more than one baby.<ref>{{cite web |author=Rohmann, Riana |title=Exercises To Correct Abdominal Separation After Pregnancy |date=11 August 2011 |publisher=LIVESTRONG.COM |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/332482-exercises-to-correct-abdominal-separation-after-pregnancy/}}</ref> Many cases of diastasis recti correct themselves after birth, but some do not. In cases where it persists, exercise may help improve the condition, and sometimes surgery is needed to correct the problem to prevent pain and future complications.<ref>{{cite news |title=Diastasis Recti |work=Health Guide |newspaper=The New York Times |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diastasis-recti/overview.html}}</ref><ref>Pictures from: [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/medical/IM04619 Mayo Clinic] and [http://www.gymcompany.co.uk/blog/2011/5-top-exercises-for-a-toned-tum GymCompany]</ref>

==Serious maternal problems==
The following problems originate mainly in the mother.

===Pelvic girdle pain (PGP)===
* ''Caused by'': [[Pelvic girdle pain|PGP]] disorder is complex and multi-factorial and likely to be represented by a series of sub-groups with different underlying pain drivers from peripheral or central nervous system, altered laxity/stiffness of muscles, laxity to injury of tendinous/ligamentous structures to ‘mal-adaptive’ body mechanics. Musculo-Skeletal Mechanics involved in [[gait]] and [[weight bearing]] activities can be mild to grossly impaired. PGP can begin [[Childbirth|peri or postpartum]]. For most women PGP resolves in weeks after delivery but for some it can last for years resulting in a reduced tolerance for weight bearing activities.
* ''Treatment'': The degree of treatment is based on the severity. A mild case would require rest, rehabilitation therapy and pain is usually manageable. More severe cases would also include mobility aids, strong [[analgesics]] and sometimes surgery. One of the main factors in helping women cope is with education, information and support. Many treatment options are available.

===Severe hypertensive states===
{{See|Gestational hypertension}}
Potential severe hypertensive states of pregnancy are mainly:
* [[Preeclampsia]] = gestational hypertension, [[proteinuria]] (>300&nbsp;mg), and [[edema]]. Severe preeclampsia involves a BP over 160/110 (with additional signs)
* [[Eclampsia]] = seizures in a preeclamptic patient
* [[HELLP syndrome]] = [[Hemolytic anemia]], Elevated [[liver enzyme]]s and [[Thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]]
* [[Acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] is sometimes included in the preeclamptic spectrum.

===Deep vein thrombosis===
{{for|more info on DVT and pregnancy|Deep vein thrombosis}}
[[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) has an incidence of 0.5 to 7 per 1,000 pregnancies, and is the second most common cause of [[maternal death]] in developed countries after bleeding.<ref name=uppsala>Venös tromboembolism (VTE) — Guidelines for treatment in C counties. Bengt Wahlström, Emergency department, Uppsala Academic Hospital. January 2008</ref>
* ''Caused by'': [[Hypercoagulability]] as a physiological response to potential massive bleeding at [[childbirth]].
* ''Treatment'': Prophylactic treatment, e.g. with [[low molecular weight heparin]] may be indicated when there are additional risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.<ref name=uppsala/>

===Anaemia===

WHO levels of [[haemoglobin]] are lower in the three timesters. According to the United Nations (UN) estimates, approximately half of pregnant women suffer from anaemia worldwide. Anemia prevalences during pregnancy differed from 18% in developed countries to 75% in South Asia.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wang S, An L, Cochran SD |chapter=Women |editor=Detels R, McEwen J, Beaglehole R, Tanaka H |title=Oxford textbook of public health |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |pages=1587–601 |edition=4th}}</ref>
Treatment varies due to the severity of the anaemia, and can be used by increasing iron containing foods, oral iron tablets or by the use of [[parenteral iron]].

==Serious fetal problems==
The following problems occur in the fetus or [[placenta]], but may have serious consequences on the mother as well.

===[[Ectopic pregnancy]] (implantation of the embryo outside the uterus)===
{{main|Ectopic pregnancy}}

* ''Caused by'': Unknown, but risk factors include [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking]], advanced maternal age, and prior damage to the [[Fallopian tube]]s.
* ''Treatment'': If there is no spontaneous resolution, the pregnancy must be [[abortion|aborted]] either surgically or by the drug [[methotrexate]].

===[[Placental abruption]] (separation of the placenta from the uterus)===
{{Main|Placental abruption}}
* ''Caused by'': Various causes; risk factors include maternal [[hypertension]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], and drug use.
* ''Treatment'': Immediate [[birth|delivery]] if the fetus is mature (36 weeks or older), or if a younger fetus or the mother is in distress. In less severe cases with immature fetuses, the situation may be monitored in hospital, with treatment if necessary.

===Multiple pregnancies===
Main Article: [[Multiple birth#Risks|Multiple Birth Risks]]

Multiples may become [[monochorionic]], sharing the same [[chorion]], with resultant risk of [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]]. Monochorionic multiples may even become [[monoamniotic]], sharing the same [[amniotic sac]], resulting in risk of [[umbilical cord compression]] and [[umbilical cord entanglement|entanglement]]. In very rare cases, there may be [[conjoined twins]], possibly impairing function of internal organs.
