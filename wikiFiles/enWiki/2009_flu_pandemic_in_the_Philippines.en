The '''2009 flu pandemic in the [[Philippines]]''' is a part of larger [[2009 flu pandemic|global flu epidemic]] that involves new [[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A]] virus strain, [[A(H1N1)|H1N1]]. The pandemic reached the Philippines on May 21, 2009 when a young Filipina girl first contracted the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|A(H1N1)]] virus while vacationing in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[US]]. In the following days, several local cases were reported to be caused by contact with two infected [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] women who attended a wedding ceremony in Zambales.

The 10-year-old Filipina girl arrived at the country on May 18 and was hospitalized the day after at the [[Research Institute for Tropical Medicine]] in [[Muntinlupa City]]. On May 21, Department of Health (DOH) secretary [[Francisco Duque]] confirmed the case being the first Philippine swine flu case. On a May 22 press conference at World Health Organization Regional Office in Manila, Secretary Duque announced the first A(H1N1) case in the country:

{{Quote|The DOH confirms today the first case of A(H1N1) in the Philippines. She is a female traveler who arrived in the country on May 18 from the United States, whose throat specimen tested positive based on results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.<ref name="first swine flu"/>|Health Secretary Francisco Duque|[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}

Since the outbreak of A(H1N1) in the Americas, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] urged the Department of Health, the [[Bureau of Immigration (Philippines)|Bureau of Immigration]], the [[Bureau of Quarantine (Philippines)|Bureau of Quarantine]] and other concerned agencies to control monitor airport and seaport arrivals for possible flu infection.

Around two months after the memorandum ordering extra precautions on the mob regarding catching flu in churches, the [[Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines]] (CBCP) announced that the new flu strain failed to drag Filipino believers out of churches. According to Msgr. Achilles Dakay of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cebu]], church attendance in the archdiocese remained normal despite advisories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/church-attendance-remains-high-catholic-officials-say|title=Church attendance remains high, Catholic officials say|date=6 July 2009|publisher=Sun Star Cebu|accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref>

===Policy of mitigation===
[[Image:Tamiflu.JPG|thumb|left|120px|Tamiflu, influenza [[antiviral drug]]]]
Though the influenza virus is now treated mild, DOH will only then treat it like an ordinary [[flu]], whereas it is no longer an obligation to follow all sick persons.<ref name="mitigation policy"/> According to Duque, if they shall continue their containment policy, the DOH will lose all their resources. He added, "''Ituturing na lamang namin ito na parang [isang] karaniwang trangkaso na lamang. Mahirap namang babantayan mo[/natin] lahat ng [mga] 'yan[g pasyente].''" (We shall treat this disease like an ordinary [[influenza]].

On the other hand, DOH shifted into policy of mitigation where patients with symptoms anomaly exhibiting swine flu will just go see a doctor.<ref name="DOH hinay"/>

===Government action===
====Vaccine issues and benefits====
[[File:Philippine 2009 H1N1 Health Advisory.png|thumb|right|250px|Department of Health's poster about what-to-do and response level system of the government regarding the flu.]]

Dr. Lyndon Lee Suy, head of the Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases Program of the Department of Health (DOH), said that the Philippine government, on July 5, still cannot afford to buy mass vaccine, which is estimated to cost [[Philippine peso|PhP]] 1,000 per dosage.<ref name="no budget july 5">{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/july/05/yehey/top_stories/20090705top1.html|title=Special Report: Can RP cope with full-blown Novel A(H1N1) epidemic?  DOH budget not enough for vaccines|last=Icamina|first=Paul|date=5 July 2009|publisher=Manila Times|accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref> He said that the elderly, among the high-risk group in the Philippines, has a population of around 3.6 million, and vaccination among them requires PhP 3.6 billion (which is a tentative equivalent for the health department's three-year budget).<ref name="no budget july 5"/> Dr. Lee Suy also added that the stocked 1.5 million anti-viral medicines such as [[Tamiflu]] by the DOH is not enough for possible epidemic since most of them are given free to discourage uncontrolled and [[panic buying]].<ref name="no budget july 5"/> He also said that high-risked group does not only includes elderly, but individuals 5 years and below and with naturally harmful diseases.<ref name="no budget july 5"/>

On July 7, [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche Philippines]] announced that it would cut down prices of Tamiflu from PhP 1,000 to PhP 880, to ensure adequate supply of the said anti-viral drug in the Philippines and the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/BW070809/content.php?src=3&id=075|title=Antiviral drug’s price cut; additional budget rejected|date=8 July 2009|publisher=BusinessWorld|accessdate=2009-08-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The same day, in a hearing at the [[Philippine House of Representatives]] (Congress), Health secretary Francisco Duque requested PhP 19.8 billion fund for H1N1 resistance. He said that the money will be used for buying vaccines (PhP 16 billion), subsidizing poor patients and assistance to the families of poor victims (PhP 3 billion), and implementing rules and rehabilitation of target hospitals for H1N1 patients (PhP 800 million). The Congress questioned the amount of fund largely it is too huge to award and that there are no vaccine yet to buy. On the same hand, [[Iloilo]] Representative Ferjenel Biron, also the chairman of the House Committee on Health, asked the secretary to cut its requested budget down to 10% or PhP 2 billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/166824/Bantay-A(H1N1)-P198B-pondo-hiningi-ni-Duque-pangontra-sa-virus|title=Bantay A(H1N1): P19.8B pondo hiningi ni Duque pangontra sa virus|date=07 july 2009|publisher=GMA News.TV|accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref>

On July 27, 2009, the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] announced that the doctors and other health workers such as nurses, aides and volunteers that helped the government to assist H1N1 patients and victims will be among the group that will become the first recipient of 100,000 H1N1 vaccine from the World Health Organization.<ref name="health workers: vaccine">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168505/DOH-Health-workers-to-get-first-batch-of-A(H1N1)-vaccines|title=DOH: Health workers to get first batch of A(H1N1) vaccines|date=29 July 2009|publisher=GMA News.TV|accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref> The vaccine is expected to be out from United States by mid-October.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168112/US-160M-doses-of-swine-flu-vaccine-due-in-Oct|title=US: 160M doses of swine flu vaccine due in Oct|date=24 July 2009|work=AP|publisher=GMA News.TV|accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref>

On August 2, [[San Juan City]] officials created a city ordinance seeking PhP 1 million budget seeking for an immediate purchase for health workers in the said city.

{{Vquote|right|width=400px|Mitigation means that we only do early detection and aggressive treatment of cases as they come especially for those with high-risk preexisting conditions.  Those manifesting with mild symptoms can be managed and monitored at home so that only patients at risk who develop complications will have to be hospitalized. H1N1 will now become part of our Influenza-like Illness (ILI) surveillance activity and one of our notifiable diseases.  It offers little benefit to do extensive tracing of this virus when it is clear that the disease can be passed on to others at a rate faster than it will ever be humanly possible to find the contacts. | Francisco Duque|DOH secretary<ref name="mitigation policy">{{cite news|url=http://www.doh.gov.ph/h1n1/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=105:update-no-35-duque-readies-doh-for-shift-toward-mitigation&catid=35:daily-influenza-a-h1n1-updates&Itemid=61|title=Update No. 35 - Duque Readies DOH for Shift Toward Mitigation |date=8 June 2009|publisher=Department of Health, Philippines|accessdate=2009-08-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><br>''In response to mitigation policy of the department''|}}
