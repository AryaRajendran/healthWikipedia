'''Diatrizoic acid''' (or its anionic form, '''diatrizoate'''), also known as amidotrizoic acid, or 3,5-diacetamido-2,4,6-triiodobenzoic acid, is a [[radiocontrast]] agent containing [[iodine]]. Trade names include '''Hypaque''', '''Gastrografin''' and '''Urografin''', the latter being a combination of the [[sodium]] and [[meglumine]] salts.

Diatrizoate is considered a high-[[osmolality]] contrast agent. Its osmolality ranges from approximately 1500 [[Osmole (unit)|mOsm]]/kg (50% solution)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?id=1808&type=display | title = Hypaque sodium (Diatrizoate Sodium) injection, solution. Product label | author = Amersham Health | month = April | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-03-29 | publisher = U.S. [[National Library of Medicine]] | work = DailyMed}}</ref> to over 2000 mOsm/kg (76% solution).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?id=997&type=display | title = Hypaque (Diatrizoate Meglumine and Diatrizoate Sodium) injection, solution.

==Indications==
Diatrizoic acid may be used as an alternative to [[barium sulfate]] for [[medical imaging]] of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], such as [[upper gastrointestinal series]] and [[small bowel series]]. It is indicated for use in patients who are allergic to barium, or in cases where the barium might leak into the abdominal cavity.  It does not coat the stomach/bowel lining as well as barium, so it is not used commonly for this purpose.

Under the trade name ''Urografin'' it is used for [[intravenous pyelography]].

It is also used to [[taeniacide|kill tapeworms]].<ref name="Sood">{{cite book|author=Sood|title=Surgical Diseases in Tropical Countries|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kpxMrfCtUs8C&pg=PA72|accessdate=11 August 2010|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-7179-444-7|pages=72–}}</ref><ref name="ScheinRogers2010">{{cite book|author1=Moshe Schein|author2=Paul Rogers|author3=Ahmad Assalia|title=Schein's Common Sense Emergency Abdominal Surgery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BUdLUsbxTjQC&pg=PA391|accessdate=11 August 2010|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-74820-5|pages=391–}}</ref>

==Administration==
*It is given [[intravenously]] (under brand name Hypaque, [[GE Healthcare]]) to enhance contrast in [[computed tomography]], to image the [[kidney]]s and related structures, and to image blood vessels.
*It is given orally or by [[enema]] (Gastrografin, Gastrovist, Gastrovision, MD-Gastroview) to image the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  The taste is foul, even when mixed and diluted with [[fruit juice]].
*It is given by [[Foley catheter]] (Cystografin) to image the [[urinary tract]]

==Contraindications==
A history of sensitivity to iodine is not a contraindication to using diatrizoate, although it suggests caution in use of the agent. In this case, a regimen of oral or intravenous corticosteroids may be given as prophylaxis, or an alternative such as [[barium sulfate]] may be preferable. 

Gastrografin is contraindicated to use along with certain medications that can cause [[lactic acidosis]], such as [[metformin]]. Concurrent use may lead to renal failure and lactic acidosis, and a clinician may need to space the agents apart over a number of days to prevent an interaction.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thomsonhc.com/hcs/librarian/ND_T/HCS/ND_PR/Main/CS/B469E9/DUPLICATIONSHIELDSYNC/8D376E/ND_PG/PRIH/ND_B/HCS/SBK/2/ND_P/Main/PFActionId/hcs.common.RetrieveDocumentCommon/DocId/2697/ContentSetId/31#contraindicationsSection | title = DIATRIZOATE MEGLUMINE/DIATRIZOATE SODIUM | author = Micromedex Healthcare Series | month = November | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2010-11-10 | publisher = Thomson Reuters (Healthcare) Inc. | work = DRUGDEX}}</ref>

Gastrografin is a hypertonic solution, and therefore it should be avoided in imaging studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract in patients who are at risk of aspiration, as it will cause prompt pulmonary edema if accidentally introduced into the tracheobronchial tree.

Urografin is not to be used for myelography, ventriculography or cisternography, since it is likely to provoke neurotoxic symptoms in these examinations.
