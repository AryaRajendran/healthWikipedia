'''Age-related macular degeneration''' (AMD) is a medical condition which usually affects older adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the [[macula]]) because of damage to the [[retina]]. It occurs in "dry" and "wet" forms. It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in older adults (>50 years). Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life. 

Starting from the inside of the [[human eye|eye]] and going towards the outer surface, the three main layers at the back of the eye are the [[retina]], which is light-sensitive tissue that is considered part of the [[central nervous system]] and is actually brain tissue; the [[choroid]], which contains the blood supply; and the [[sclera]], which is the white, outer, layer of the eye. 

The macula is the central area of the retina, which provides the most detailed central vision. 

In the dry (nonexudative) form, cellular debris called [[drusen]] accumulates between the retina and the choroid, and the retina can become detached. In the wet (exudative) form, which is more severe, blood vessels grow up from the choroid behind the retina, and the retina can also become detached. It can be treated with laser coagulation, and with medication that stops and sometimes reverses the growth of blood vessels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Jong PT |title=Age-related macular degeneration |journal=[[N Engl J Med.]] |volume=355 |issue=14 |pages=1474–1485 |year=2006 |pmid=17021323 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra062326 }}</ref><ref>Ch. 25, Disorders of the Eye, Jonathan C. Horton, in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed.</ref> 

Although some macular dystrophies affecting younger individuals are sometimes referred to as macular degeneration, the term generally refers to age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD). 

Age-related macular degeneration begins with characteristic yellow deposits ([[drusen]]) in the macula, between the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] and the underlying [[choroid]]. Most people with these early changes (referred to as age-related maculopathy) have good vision. People with drusen can go on to develop advanced AMD.  The risk is higher when the drusen are large and numerous and associated with disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft drusen are related to elevated [[cholesterol]] deposits and may respond to cholesterol-lowering agents.

==Dry AMD==

'''Central geographic atrophy''', the "dry" form of advanced AMD, results from atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelial layer below the retina, which causes vision loss through loss of photoreceptors (rods and cones) in the central part of the eye. No medical or surgical treatment is available for this condition; however, vitamin supplements with high doses of antioxidants, [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]], have been suggested by the [[National Eye Institute]] and others to slow the progression of dry macular degeneration and, in some patients, improve [[visual acuity]].<ref name=BMES>{{cite journal |author=Tan JS, Wang JJ, Flood V, Rochtchina E, Smith W, Mitchell P.|title=Dietary antioxidants and the long-term incidence of age-related macular degeneration: the Blue Mountain Eye Study   |journal=Ophthalmology. |date=February 2008 |volume=115|issue= 2|pages=334–41|pmid=17664009 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2007.03.083}}</ref> However, recent advancements within the field of stem cell research in the [[United States]] have led to the first human embryonic stem cell trial for dry AMD, which reports positive results.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lanza|first=R|coauthors=SD Schwartz|title=Embryonic stem cell trials for macular degeneration: a preliminary report.|journal=Lancet|date=25|year=2012|month=Feb}}</ref> 

Higher [[beta-carotene]] intake was associated with an increased risk of AMD.<ref name=BMES/>

==Wet AMD==

[[Neovascular]] or [[exudative]] AMD,  the "wet" form of advanced AMD, causes vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth ([[choroidal neovascularization]]) in the [[choriocapillaris]], through [[Bruch's membrane]], ultimately leading to blood and protein leakage below the macula.  Bleeding, leaking, and scarring from these blood vessels eventually cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and rapid vision loss if left untreated.  

Only about 10% of patients suffering from macular degeneration have the wet type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lasiksurgerycost.net/articles/macular-degeneration.html |title=Eye Conditions: Macular Degeneration |publisher=lasiksurgerycost.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-18}}</ref>

Macular degeneration is not painful, which may allow it to go unnoticed for some time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionenhancers.co.uk/agerelatedmaculardegeneration.html |title=Age Related Macular Degeneration |publisher=visionenhancers.co.uk |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Signs and symptoms of macular degeneration include:
*[[Drusen]]
*Pigmentary alterations
*Exudative changes: [[hemorrhages]] in the eye, hard exudates, subretinal/sub-RPE/intraretinal fluid
*Atrophy: incipient and geographic
*Visual acuity drastically decreasing (two levels or more), e.g.: 20/20 to 20/80.
*[[Preferential hyperacuity perimetry]] changes (for wet AMD) <ref>[http://www.revoptom.com/index.asp?page=2_14021.htm ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medcompare.com/spotlight.asp?spotlightid=175 |title=Preferential Hyperacuity Perimetry (PHP) as an Adjunct Diagnostic Tool to Funduscopy in Age–related Macular Degeneration - Ophthalmology Technology Spotlight |publisher=Medcompare |date= |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref>

*Blurred vision: Those with nonexudative macular degeneration may be asymptomatic or notice a gradual loss of central vision, whereas those with exudative macular degeneration often notice a rapid onset of vision loss.
*Central [[scotoma]]s (shadows or missing areas of vision)
*[[Distorted vision]] in the form of [[metamorphopsia]], in which a grid of straight lines appears wavy and parts of the grid may appear blank:  Patients often first notice this when looking at miniblinds in their home.
*Trouble discerning colors, specifically dark ones from dark ones and light ones from light ones
*Slow recovery of visual function after exposure to bright light
*A loss in  [[Contrast (vision)|contrast sensitivity]]

Macular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a very small number of people with visual impairment are totally blind. In almost all cases, some vision remains. Other complicating conditions may possibly lead to such an acute condition (severe stroke or trauma, untreated glaucoma, etc.), but few macular degeneration patients experience total visual loss.<ref>{{cite journal | first = DL | last = Roberts | year = 2006 | month = September | title = The First Year--Age Related Macular Degeneration | journal = (Marlowe & Company) | page = 100}}</ref> The area of the macula comprises only about 2.1% of the retina, and the remaining 97.9% (the peripheral field) remains unaffected by the disease. Interestingly, even though the macula provides such a small fraction of the visual field, almost half of the visual cortex is devoted to processing macular information.<ref>{{cite journal | first = DL | last = Roberts | year = 2006 | month = September | title = The First Year--Age Related Macular Degeneration | journal = (Marlowe & Company) | page = 20}}</ref>

The loss of central vision profoundly affects visual functioning. It is quite difficult, for example, to read without central vision. Pictures that attempt to depict the central visual loss of macular degeneration with a black spot do not really do justice to the devastating nature of the visual loss. This can be demonstrated by printing letters six inches high on a piece of paper and attempting to identify them while looking straight ahead and holding the paper slightly to the side.  Most people find this difficult to do.

There is a loss of contrast sensitivity, so that contours, shadows, and color vision are less vivid. The loss in contrast sensitivity can be quickly and easily measured by a [[contrast sensitivity test]] performed either at home or by an eye specialist.

Similar symptoms with a very different etiology and different treatment can be caused by [[epiretinal membrane]] or [[macular pucker]] or leaking blood vessels in the eye.

*'''Macular degeneration gene:''' The genes for the [[complement system]] proteins [[factor H]] (CFH), factor B (CFB) and factor 3 (C3) are strongly associated with a person's risk for developing AMD. CFH is involved in inhibiting the inflammatory response mediated via C3b (and the [[alternative pathway]] of complement) both by acting as a cofactor for cleavage of C3b to its inactive form, C3bi, and by weakening the active complex that forms between C3b and factor B.  C-reactive protein and polyanionic surface markers such as [[glycosaminoglycans]] normally enhance the ability of factor H to inhibit complement.  But the mutation in CFH (''Tyr402His'') reduces the affinity of CFH for CRP and probably also alters the ability of factor H to recognise specific glycosaminoglycans.  This change results in reduced ability of CFH to regulate complement on critical surfaces such as the specialised membrane at the back of the eye and leads to increased inflammatory response within the macula. In two 2006 studies<!-- at Yale Department of Epidemiology and Public Health and the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah School of Medicine-->, another gene that has implications for the disease, called ''HTRA1'' (encoding a secreted serine protease), was identified.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yang Z, Camp NJ, Sun H, Tong Z, Gibbs D, Cameron DJ, Chen H, Zhao Y, Pearson E ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | month = Nov | title = A variant of the HTRA1 gene increases susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration | url = | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5801| pages = 992–3 | pmid = 17053109 | doi=10.1126/science.1133811}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17053108 | doi=10.1126/science.1133807 | volume=314 | issue=5801 | journal = Science | year=2006 | title = HTRA1 Promoter Polymorphism in Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration | month=November | pages=989–92 | author=Dewan A, Liu M, Hartman S, ''et al.''}}</ref> <br/>The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in humans is contained on a single circular chromosome, 16,569 basepairs around, and each mitochondrion contains five to 10 copies of the mitochondrial chromosome. Several essential genes in mtDNA are involved in replication and translation, along with some genes that are crucial for the machinery that converts metabolic energy into ATP.  These include NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome C oxidase, ubiquinol/cytochrome C oxidoreductase, and ATP synthase, as well as the genes for unique ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA particles that are required for translating these genes into proteins.<br/> Specific diseases are associated with mutations in some of these genes. Below is one of the affected genes and the disease that arises from its mutation.
* '''Mutation of the ATP synthase gene:''' [[Retinitis pigmentosa]] (RP) is a genetically linked dysfunction of the retina and is related to mutation of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase gene 615.1617.

*'''[[Stargardt's disease]]''' (juvenile macular degeneration, STGD) is an autosomal recessive retinal disorder characterized by a juvenile-onset macular dystrophy, alterations of the peripheral retina, and subretinal deposition of lipofuscin-like material. A gene encoding an [[ATP-binding cassette]] transporter was mapped to the ''2-cM'' (centiMorgan) interval at'' 1p13-p21'' previously shown by linkage analysis to harbor this gene. This gene, ABCR, is expressed exclusively and at high levels in the retina, in rod but not cone photoreceptors, as detected by ''in situ'' hybridization. Mutational analysis of ABCR in STGD families revealed a total of 19 different mutations including homozygous mutations in two families with consanguineous parentage. These data indicate that ABCR is the causal gene of STGD/FFM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/279/5354/1107a |title="ABCR Gene and Age-Related Macular Degeneration " Science. 1998 |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=1998-02-20 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref>

*'''Drusen''': CMSD studies indicate [[drusen]] are similar in molecular composition to plaques and deposits in other age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. While there is a tendency for drusen to be blamed for the progressive loss of vision, drusen deposits can be present in the retina without vision loss.  Some patients with large deposits of drusen have normal visual acuity. If normal retinal reception and image transmission are sometimes possible in a retina when high concentrations of drusen are present, then, even if drusen can be implicated in the loss of visual function, there must be at least one other factor that accounts for the loss of vision.

*'''Arg80Gly variant of the [[complement system|complement protein C3]]''': Two independent studies published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' and ''Nature Genetics'' in 2007 showed a certain common mutation in the C3 gene, which is a central protein of the [[complement system]], is strongly associated with the occurrence of AMD.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yates JR, Sepp T, Matharu BK, Khan JC, Thurlby DA, Shahid H, Clayton DG, Hayward C, Morgan J, Wright AF, Armbrecht AM, Dhillon B, Deary IJ, Redmond E, Bird AC, Moore AT  | title = Complement C3 Variant and the Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration | journal = N Engl J Med.| volume = 357 | issue = 6| pages = 553–561 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17634448  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa072618}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Maller JB, Fagerness JA, Reynolds RC, Neale BM, Daly MJ, Seddon JM | title= Variation in Complement Factor 3 is Associated with Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 1200–1201 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1038/ng2131 | pmid = 17767156}}</ref> The authors of both papers consider their study to underscore the influence of the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease.

A powerful predictor of AMD is found on chromosome ''10q26'' at LOC 387715.

Other gene markers of progression risk includes tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 ([[TIMP3]]), suggesting a role for intracellular matrix metabolism in AMD progression. Variations in cholesterol metabolising genes such as the [[hepatic lipase]], cholesterol ester transferase, [[lipoprotein lipase]] and the [[ABCA1|ABC-binding cassette A1]] correlate with disease progression.  The early stigmata of disease, drusen, are rich in cholesterol, offering face validity to the results of genome-wide association studies.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Genetic variants near TIMP3 and high-density lipoprotein–associated loci influence susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | year=2010   |volume=107 | issue =16| pages=7401–6 |author = Chen W, Stambolian D, Edwards AO, Branham KE, Othman M, Jakobsdottir J |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912702107 |pmid = 20385819 |pmc = 2867722}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title = Genome-wide association study of advanced age-related macular degeneration identifies a role of the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. | year=2010   |volume=107 | issue =16| pages=7395–400 |author = Neale BM, Fagerness J, Reynolds R, Sobrin L, Parker M, Raychaudhuri S |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912019107 |pmid = 20385826 |pmc = 2867697}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Opthalmology AMD Super Resolution Cremer.png|thumb||250px|Super resolution microscopic investigation of human eye tissue affected by AMD]]
[[Fluorescein angiography]] allows for the identification and localization of abnormal vascular processes.
[[Optical coherence tomography]] is now used by most ophthalmologists in the diagnosis and the follow-up evaluation of the response to treatment by using either [[bevacizumab]] (Avastin) or [[ranibizumab]] (Lucentis), which are injected into the vitreous humor of the eye at various intervals. 

Recently, structured illumination [[light microscopy]], using a specially designed super resolution microscope setup has been used to resolve the fluorescent distribution of small autofluorescent structures ([[lipofuscin]] granulae) in retinal pigment epithelium tissue sections.<ref>Best G, Amberger R, Baddeley D, Ach T, Dithmar S, Heintzmann R and Cremer C (2011).

== Management ==

Drugs approved for some variety of macular degeneration include [[ranibizumab]] and [[aflibercept]] (for wet AMD).

===Treatments for wet AMD===
The proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF). [[Angiogenesis inhibitor|Antiangiogenics]] or anti-VEGF agents can cause regression of the abnormal blood vessels and improve vision when injected directly into the vitreous humor of the eye. The injections must be repeated monthly or bimonthly. Several antiangiogenic drugs have been approved for use in the eye by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and regulatory agencies in other countries. 

The first angiogenesis inhibitor, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A, was [[bevacizumab]], which is approved for use in cancer. [[Ranibizumab]] is a smaller fragment, Fab fragment, of the parent bevacizumab molecule specifically designed for eye injections. The cost of ranibizumab is approximately {{Currency|742|GBP}} per treatment in the United Kingdom.<ref name=copleyreuters2012>{{Cite news |last=Copley |first=Caroline |first2=Ben |last2=Hirschler |publication-date=April 24, 2012 |title=Novartis challenges UK Avastin use in eye disease |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/24/us-novartis-britain-idUSBRE83N0GM20120424 }}</ref>  Bevacizumab is packaged and used for cancer in larger doses than the doses used in the eye. It can be administered in smaller doses in the eye, [[off label]], at a cost of less than one-tenth that of ranibizumab per treatment.<ref name=copleyreuters2012/>  Eye infections have been reported as a result of dividing the doses.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the UK, [[NICE]] issued guidelines<ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12057/41719/41719.pdf NICE guidelines]</ref> for the treatment of wet AMD in the [[National Health Service|NHS]]. NICE only approved use of ranibizumab for wet AMD in the NHS in England. NHS hospitals and Primary Care Trusts in England are required to follow NICE guidance.

Other approved antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of neo-vascular AMD include [[pegaptanib]] (Macugen) and [[aflibercept]] (Eylea).<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/Ophthalmology/GeneralOphthalmology/29811 FDA approves Eylea for macular degeneration]</ref>

[[Photodynamic therapy]] has also been used to treat wet AMD.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Health Technology Assessment]] |year=2003 |volume=7 |issue=9 |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/execsumm/summ709.shtml |title=Clinical effectiveness and cost–utility of photodynamic therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review and economic evaluation }}</ref> The drug [[verteporfin]] is administered intravenously; light of the correct wavelength is then applied to the abnormal blood vessels. This activates the verteporfin and obliterates the vessels.

===Nondrug interventions===

Some evidence supports a reduction in the risk of AMD with increasing intake of two carotenoids, [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carpentier S, Knaus M, Suh M |title=Associations between lutein, zeaxanthin, and age-related macular degeneration: An overview|journal=Critical reviews in Food Science and Nutrition |volume=49 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=313–326 |pmid=19234943 |doi=10.1080/10408390802066979 |quote=Abstract doesn't include conclusion}}</ref>

Consuming [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s ([[docosahexaenoic acid]] and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]]) has been [[correlation|correlated]] with a reduced progression of early AMD, and in conjunction with low [[glycemic index]] foods, with reduced progression of advanced AMD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chiu CJ, Klein R, Milton RC, Gensler G, Taylor A |title=Does eating particular diets alter the risk of age-related macular degeneration in users of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study supplements? |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume= 93|issue= 9|pages= 1241–6|year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19508997 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2008.143412 |url= |quote=Conclusions: The findings show an association of consuming a diet rich in DHA with a lower progression of early AMD.

== Adaptive devices ==
[[Image:Josef Tal & Computer Screen.jpg|thumb|[[Josef Tal]], an Israeli composer who was affected by macular degeneration, checks a manuscript using a [[Closed-circuit television camera|CCTV]] desktop unit.]]

Because peripheral vision is not affected, people with macular degeneration can learn to use their remaining vision to partially compensate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdsupport.org/lvrehab.html |title=Low Vision Rehabilitation Delivery Model |publisher=Mdsupport.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> Assistance and resources are available in many countries and every state in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdsupport.org/resource_index.html |title=Agencies, Centers, Organizations, & Societies |publisher=Mdsupport.org |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> Classes for "independent living" are given and some technology can be obtained from a state department of rehabilitation.

Adaptive devices can help people read. These include magnifying glasses, special eyeglass lenses, computer screen readers, and TV systems that enlarge reading material. 

Computer screen readers such as [[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]] or [[Thunder (assistive technology)|Thunder]] work with standard [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computers. 

Video cameras can be fed into standard or special-purpose computer monitors, and the image can be zoomed in and magnified. These systems often include a movable table to move the written material. 

[[Accessible publishing]] provides larger fonts for printed books, patterns to make tracking easier, [[audiobooks]] and [[DAISY Digital Talking Book|DAISY]] books with both text and audio.

==Amsler grid test==
The '''Amsler grid test''' is one of the simplest and most effective methods for patients to monitor the health of their maculae. The [[Amsler grid]] is, in essence, a pattern of intersecting lines (identical to graph paper) with a black dot in the middle. The central black dot is used for fixation (a place for the eye to focus). With normal vision, all lines surrounding the black dot will look straight and evenly spaced, with no missing or odd-looking areas when fixating on the grid's central black dot. When  disease is affecting the macula, as in macular degeneration, the lines can look bent, distorted and/or missing.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
