'''Family aggregation''', also known as '''familial aggregation''', is the clustering of certain [[phenotypic trait|trait]]s, behaviors, or disorders within a given family. Family aggregation may arise because of [[gene|genetic]] or environmental similarities.<ref>Butcher, J., S. Mineka, and J. Hooley. Abnormal Psychology. 15. Boston: Pearson, 2010. Print.</ref>

==Schizophrenia==
The data from the family aggregation studies have been extensively studied to determine the mode of inheritance of [[schizophrenia]]. Studies to date have shown that when numerous families are studied, simple modes of inheritance are not statistically supported. The majority of studies analyzing for the mode of inheritance have concluded that a multifactorial threshold mode is most likely.<ref name="Tasman1991">{{cite book|author=Allan Ed.

==Cardiovascular problems==
The most consistent and dramatic evidence of family influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) is family aggregation of physiological factors. In several studies the parent-child and sibling-sibling correlations of [[blood pressure]] are approximately .24. [[gene|Genetic]] determination of blood pressure is strong, but does not explain all of the variance.<ref name="Bahar1988">{{cite book|author=Sonya Bahar|title=Health Behavior|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6bkgqiot7Q0C&pg=PA108|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=31 August 1988|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-42874-6|pages=108–}}</ref>

==Parkinson's disease==
Familial Parkinson's disease (PD) exists but is infrequent. Early investigations failed to show substantial family aggregation for PD.<ref name="VuylsteekHallen1994">{{cite book|author1=Karel Vuylsteek|author2=Manuel Hallen|title=Epidemiology: Results of the 4th EC Medical and Health Research Program|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bZ2ztn0nLawC&pg=PA194|accessdate=10 January 2013|year=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-90-5199-150-5|pages=194–}}</ref>
