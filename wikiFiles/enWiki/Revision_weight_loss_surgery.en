'''Revision Weight Loss Surgery''' is a surgical procedure that is performed on patients who have already undergone a form of [[bariatric surgery]], and have either had complications from such surgery or have not successfully achieved significant [[weight loss]] results from the initial surgery.<ref>*Mal Fobi1, Hoil Lee2, Daniel Igwe Jr3, Elaine James4, Malgorzata Stanczyk5, Philomina Eyong6, Basil Felahy7 and Julius Tambi8.

'Obesity Surgery', 'Volume 11, Number 2 / April, 2001', 'Springer New York', ISSN 1708-0428</ref> Procedures are usually performed [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]], though open surgery may be required if prior bariatric surgery has resulted in extensive scarring.

With the increase in the number of weight loss surgeries performed every year,<ref>AHRQ Study Finds Weight-loss Surgeries Quadrupled in Five Years. Press Release, July 12, 2005. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. http://www.ahrq.gov/news/press/pr2005/wtlosspr.htm</ref> there are growing numbers of individuals who have experienced an unsatisfactory result from their [[bariatric]] procedures. There are several [[Bariatric surgery|weight loss surgery]] options,<ref>Medical and surgical options in the treatment of severe obesity, Barry L. Fisher, M.D., Philip Schauer, M.D., American Journal of Surgery, Volume 184 • Number 6B • December 2002</ref> some of which may limit later options for revision weight loss surgery.<ref>Revisional Surgery After Failed Vertical Banded Gastroplasty: Restoration of Vertical Banded Gastroplasty or Conversion to Gastric Bypass, Journal	Obesity Surgery, Springer New York, ISSN	0960-8923 (Print) 1708-0428 (Online), Issue	Volume 8, Number 1 / February, 1998, DOI	10.1381/096089298765555006, Pages	21-28

==Procedures==

*An '''[[adjustable gastric band]]''' is an inflatable silicone prosthetic device that is placed around the top portion of the stomach. This procedure can be performed as a revision procedure for many patients who have had a previous stomach stapling, gastroplasty procedure, or roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery but have regained weight. The procedure is normally performed laparoscopically, though in a small minority of instances prior surgery may have resulted in extensive scarring,<ref>Adjustable Gastric Banding as a Revisional Bariatric Procedure after Failed Gastric Bypas, M Bessler, A Daud, MF DiGiorgi, L Olivero-Rivera, Obesity Surgery, 2005 - Springer</ref> requiring open surgery.

*'''[[Gastric bypass#Variations of the gastric bypass|Roux-en-Y gastric bypass]]''' is a commonly chosen revision technique,<ref>The weight reduction operation of choice : vertical banded gastroplasty or gastric bypass, CAPELLA J. F. (1) ; CAPELLA R. F. ; SUGERMAN H. J. (Commentateur) ; BROLIN R. E. (Commentateur) ;, The American journal of surgery,   ISSN 0002-9610,   CODEN AJSUAB </ref>  particularly in patients who have not been successful in meeting their weight loss goals after [[stomach stapling]], [[gastroplasty]], [[vertical gastric banding]], or [[laparoscopic-adjustable gastric banding]]. Often the prior procedure still lends itself to a revision to become a [[roux-en-Y anastomosis|roux-en-Y]] gastric bypass. It may be performed laparoscopically, and the average recovery time is approximately two weeks.<ref>Outcomes After Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity,  Schauer, Philip R.

*'''[[Sleeve gastrectomy]]''' removes a large portion of the stomach, with the remaining portion reshaped to become tube-like or sleeve-shaped. This creates an increased sense of satiety and decreased hunger in patients, often leading to weight loss and improved health.<ref> Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy as Treatment for Morbid Obesity: Technique and Short-Term Outcome, Paul E Roa, Orit Kaidar-Person, David Pinto, Minyoung Cho, Samuel Szomstein and Raul J Rosenthal, Obesity Surgery, Volume 16, Number 10 / October, 2006 Springer New York, ISSN 0960-8923 </ref> The procedure is generally less invasive than many other weight loss surgeries and has a lower potential for complications than may be associated with [[gastric bypass surgery]].<ref>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy is Superior to Endoscopic Intragastric Balloon as a First Stage, L Milone, V Strong, M Gagner - Obesity Surgery, 2005 - Springer</ref>

*'''[[StomaphyX]]''' revision is a completely [[endoscopic]] revision technique<ref>The role of endoscopy in bariatrics, Shou-jiang Tang MDa and Don C. Rockey MDa, 2008 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Published by Elsevier Inc.</ref> used to tighten a stretched gastric pouch using internal sutures or fasteners. It may be used in patients who have had prior roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and have a stretched stomach pouch.
