A '''stabbing''' is penetration with a sharp or pointed object at close range. ''Stab'' connotes purposeful action, as by an [[assassination|assassin]] or [[murderer]], but it is also possible to accidentally stab oneself or others. Stabbing differs from [[penetrating trauma|slashing]] or [[cutting]] in that the motion of the object used in a stabbing generally moves perpendicular to and directly into the victim's body, rather than being drawn across it.

Stabbings today are common among [[gangs]] and in [[prisons]] because knives are cheap, easy to acquire (or manufacture), easily concealable and relatively effective.

==History==
[[File:Assassinato luigi.jpg|thumb|After being attacked and stabbed, empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth of Austria]] boarded a ship, unaware of the severity of her condition as consequence of an [[acute stress reaction]]. Bleeding to death from a puncture wound to the heart, Elisabeth's last words were, "What happened to me?"]]
Stabbings have been common throughout human history and were the means used to [[assassinate]] a number of distinguished historical figures, such as [[Julius Caesar]] and the Roman Emperor [[Caligula]].

In Japan, the historical practice of stabbing oneself deliberately in [[ritual suicide]] is known as ''[[seppuku]]'' (more colloquially ''hara-kiri'', literally "belly-cutting" since it involves cutting open the abdomen). The ritual is highly codified, and the person committing suicide is assisted by a "second" who is entrusted to decapitate him cleanly (and thus expedite death and prevent an undignified spectacle) once he has made the abdominal wound.

==Mechanism==
The human [[skin]] has a somewhat elastic property as a self-defense; when the human body is stabbed by a thin object such as a kitchen knife, the skin often closes tightly around the object and closes again if the object is removed, which can trap some blood within the body. It has thus been speculated that the [[fuller (weapon)|fuller]], an elongated concave depression in a metal blade, functions to let blood out of the body in order to cause more damage. This misconception has led to fullers becoming widely known as "blood grooves".  The fuller is actually a structural reinforcement of the blade similar in design to a metal I-beam used in construction. However, [[internal bleeding]] is just as dangerous as external bleeding; if enough blood vessels are severed to cause serious injury, the skin's elasticity will do nothing to prevent blood from exiting the circulatory system and accumulating uselessly in other parts of the body.

Death from stabbing is caused by [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], severe [[blood loss]], infection, or loss of function of an essential organ such as the [[heart]] or [[lung]]s.

==Medical treatment==
{{see|Stab wound}}
Although previously a victim of abdominal stabbing would be subject to exploratory surgery [[laparotomy]], it is now considered safe not to operate if the patient is stable.  In that case, they should be observed for signs of decompensation indication a serious injury.  In the event that the patient initially presents stabbing injuries and is unstable, laparotomy should be initiated to discover and rectify any internal injury.
