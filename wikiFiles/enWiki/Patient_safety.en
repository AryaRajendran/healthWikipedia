'''Patient safety''' is a new healthcare discipline that emphasizes the reporting, analysis, and prevention of [[medical error]] that often leads to [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse healthcare events]]. The frequency and magnitude of avoidable adverse patient events was not well known until the 1990s, when multiple countries reported staggering numbers of patients harmed and killed by medical errors. Recognizing that healthcare errors impact 1 in every 10 patients around the world, the [[World Health Organization]] calls patient safety an endemic concern.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/patientsafety/en/index.html | title= World Alliance for Patient Safety |accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= Organization Web Site | publisher= World Health Organization|date=}}</ref>  Indeed, patient safety has emerged as a distinct healthcare discipline supported by an immature yet developing scientific framework.  There is a significant transdisciplinary body of theoretical and research literature that informs the science of patient safety.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Patrick A. Palmieri, et al. | year = 2008 | title = The anatomy and physiology of error in averse healthcare events | journal =Advances in Health Care Management | volume = 7 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-8231(08)07003-1 | pages = 33–68|accessdate =2008-08-29}}</ref>  The resulting patient safety knowledge continually informs improvement efforts such as: applying lessons learned from business and industry, adopting innovative technologies, educating providers and consumers, enhancing error reporting systems, and developing new economic incentives.

Millennia ago, Hippocrates recognized the potential for injuries that arise from the well intentioned actions of healers.  Greek healers in the 4th Century B.C., drafted the [[Hippocratic Oath]] and pledged to "prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone."<ref>National Institute of Health, History of Medicine: [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html Greek Medicine]</ref> 
Since then, the directive ''primum non nocere'' (“first do no harm) has become a central tenet for contemporary medicine.  However, despite an increasing emphasis on the [[Medicine#History|scientific basis of medical practice]] in Europe and the United States in the late 19th Century, data on adverse outcomes were hard to come by and the various studies commissioned collected mostly anecdotal events.<ref>The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, [http://www.apsf.org/about/brief_history.mspx A Brief History]</ref>

In the United States, the public and the medical specialty of [[anesthesia]] were shocked in April 1982 by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television program [[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]] entitled ''The Deep Sleep''. Presenting accounts of anesthetic accidents, the producers stated that, every year, 6,000 Americans die or suffer brain damage related to these mishaps.<ref>Janice Tomlin (producer): ''The Deep Sleep: 6,000 will die or suffer brain damage'', WLS-TV Chicago, 20/20. April 22, 1982</ref> 
In 1983, the British [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Harvard Medical School]] jointly sponsored a symposium on anesthesia deaths and injuries, resulting in an agreement to share statistics and to conduct studies.<ref>Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation: [http://www.apsf.org/about/rovenstine/part4.mspx The establishment of the APSF]  by Ellison C. Pierce, Jr., M.D.</ref> 
By 1984 the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] (ASA) had established the [[APSF|Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation]] (APSF). The APSF marked the first use of the term "patient safety" in the name of professional reviewing organization.<ref>Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation: [http://www.apsf.org/about_safety.php Comments From the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation]</ref> Although anesthesiologists comprise only about 5% of physicians in the United States, anesthesiology became the leading medical specialty addressing issues of patient safety.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  David M Gaba | year = 2000 | title = Anesthesiology as a model for patient safety in health care | journal = Medical Care | volume = 320 | pages = 785–788 | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7237/785 | accessdate = 2006-06-24 | pmid = 10720368 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.785 | issue =  7237 | pmc =  1117775 }}</ref> Likewise in Australia, the [[#Australian Patient Safety Foundation .28APSF.29|Australian Patient Safety Foundation]] was founded in 1989 for anesthesia error monitoring. Both organizations were soon expanded as the magnitude of the medical error crisis became known.

The IOM called for a broad national effort to include establishment of a Center for Patient Safety, expanded reporting of adverse events, development of safety programs in health care organizations, and attention by regulators, health care purchasers, and professional societies. The majority of media attention, however, focused on the staggering statistics: from 44,000 to 98,000 preventable deaths annually due to medical error in hospitals, 7,000 preventable deaths related to medication errors alone. Within 2 weeks of the report's release, Congress began hearings and President Clinton ordered a government-wide study of the feasibility of implementing the report's recommendations.<ref>{{cite web | last=Charatan | first=Fred | year=2000 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7235/597?ijkey=190e9b6dd6e8fec4ca3c2e353f290efb8237b334&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | title=Clinton acts to reduce medical mistakes | publisher=BMJ Publishing Group | accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref>

*Infrastructure failure. According to the [[WHO]], 50% of medical equipment in developing countries is only partly usable due to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment.<ref name=who/>

The [[JCAHO|Joint Commission]]'s Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007 found that inadequate communication between healthcare providers, or between providers and the patient and family members, was the root cause of over half the serious adverse events in accredited hospitals.<ref>The Joint Commission’s Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007: [http://www.jointcommissionreport.org/ Improving America’s Hospitals] (Accessed 2008-04-09)</ref> Other leading causes included inadequate assessment of the patient's condition, and poor leadership or training.

* "High risk procedures or medical specialties are responsible for most ''avoidable'' adverse events".

;Limits of the industrial safety model
:[[Unintended consequence]]s may occur as improvements in safety are undertaken. It may not be possible to attain maximum safety goals in healthcare without adversely affecting patient care in other ways. An example is blood transfusion; in recent years, to reduce the risk of transmissible infection in the blood supply, donors with only a small probability of infection have been excluded. The result has been a critical shortage of blood for other lifesaving purposes, with a broad impact on patient care.<ref name=barrier /> Application of high-reliability theory and normal accident theory can help predict the organizational consequences of implementing safety measures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tamuz M, Harrison MI |title=Improving patient safety in hospitals: Contributions of high-reliability theory and normal accident theory |journal=Health Serv Res |volume=41 |issue=4 Pt 2 |pages=1654–76 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16898984 |pmc=1955347 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2006.00570.x }}</ref>

===Technology in Healthcare===
{{Further|Health information technology}}
;Overview
According to a study by RAND Health, the U.S. healthcare system could save more than $81 billion annually, reduce adverse healthcare events, and improve the quality of care if [[Health Information Technology|health information technology]] (HIT) is widely adopted.<ref>RAND Healthcare: [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9136/index1.html Health Information Technology: Can HIT Lower Costs and Improve Quality?] Retrieved on July 8, 2006</ref>  The most immediate barrier to widespread adoption of technology is cost despite the patient benefit from better health, and payer benefit from lower costs.  However, hospitals pay in both higher costs for implementation and potentially lower revenues (depending on reimbursement scheme) due to reduced patient length of stay.  The benefits provided by technological innovations also give rise to serious issues with the introduction of new and previously unseen error types.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ross Koppel, PhD, et al. | year = 2005 | title = Role of Computerized Physician Order Entry Systems in Facilitating Medication Errors | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | pages = 1197–1203 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/293/10/1197 | accessdate = 2006-06-28 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.10.1197 | pmid = 15755942 | issue = 10 }}</ref>

====Types of Healthcare Technology====
Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to substantial errors and injuries, according to the IOM (2000) report.<ref name=IOM />  The follow-up IOM report, ''Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century'', advised rapid adoption of electronic patient records, electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions.<ref>{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | first= | year=2001 | url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309072808/html | title=Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>  This section contains only the patient safety related aspects of HIT.

===== Electronic Health Record (EHR) =====
The [[Electronic health record]] (EHR), previously known as the [[Electronic medical record]] (EMR), reduces several types of errors, including those related to prescription drugs, to emergent and preventive care, and to tests and procedures.<ref>American College of Physicians Observer: [http://www.acponline.org/journals/news/sep04/emr.htm How EMR software can help prevent medical mistakes] by Jerome H. Carter (September 2004)</ref>  Important features of modern EHR include automated drug-drug/drug-food interaction checks and allergy checks, standard drug dosages and patient education information.  Drug Information at the point-of-care and drug dispensing points help in reducing errors. Example: India, MedCLIK. Also, these systems provide recurring alerts to remind clinicians of intervals for preventive care and to track referrals and test results. Clinical guidelines for disease management have a demonstrated benefit when accessible within the electronic record during the process of treating the patient.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kensaku Kawamoto, fellow1, Caitlin A Houlihan, E Andrew Balas, David F Lobach | year = 2005 | title = Improving clinical practice using clinical decision support systems: a systematic review of trials to identify features critical to success | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 330 | pages = 765–768 | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/330/7494/765 | accessdate = 2006-06-29 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38398.500764.8F | pmid = 15767266 | issue = 7494 | pmc = 555881}}</ref>  Advances in [[health informatics]] and widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records promise access to a patient's records at any health care site. Still, there may be a weak link because of physicians' deficiencies in understanding the patient safety features of e.g. government approved software.<ref>{{cite journal | author = C J Morris, B S P Savelyich, A J Avery, J A Cantrill and A Sheikh | year = 2005 | title = Patient safety features of clinical computer systems: questionnaire survey of GP views | journal = Quality and Safety in Health Care | volume = 14 | pages = 164–168 | url = http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/14/3/164 | accessdate = 2006-07-08 | doi = 10.1136/qshc.2004.011866 | pmid = 15933310 | issue = 3 | pmc = 1744017 }}</ref> Errors associated with patient misidentification may be exacerbated by EHR use, but inclusion of a prominently displayed patient photograph in the EHR can reduce errors and near misses.<ref name = AHRQ Health Care Innovations Exchange>{{cite web | url = http://innovations.ahrq.gov/content.aspx?id=3755 |title=Verification Screen That Includes Prominent Patient Photograph Significantly Reduces Errors Caused by Orders Placed in Wrong Chart | publisher = [[AHRQ Health Care Innovations Exchange]] | date = 2013-04-24 | accessdate = 2013-04-26 }}</ref>

Portable offline emergency medical record devices have been developed to provide access to health records during widespread or extended infrastructure failure, such as in natural disasters or regional conflicts.<ref>[http://www.emergentag.com/ EMERGENTag], portable offline emergency medical record</ref>

===== Active RFID platform =====

These [[RFID|systems']] basic security measures are based on sound identifying electronic tags, in order that the patient details provided in different situations are always reliable. These systems offer three differently qualified options: 
* Identification upon request of health care personnel, using scanners (similar to readers for passive RFID tags or scanners for barcode labels) to identify patient semi-automatically upon presentation of patient with tag to staff
* Automatic identification upon entry of patient. An automatic identification check is carried out on each person with tags (primarily patients) entering the area to determine the presented patient in contrast to other patient earlier entered into reach of the used reader.
* Automatic identification and range estimation upon approach to most proximate patient, excluding reads from more distant tags of other patients in the same area<ref>[http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=bibdat&docid=DE102009039879A1 Method and components for registering and controlling of services with patients]</ref>

Any of these options may be applied whenever and wherever patient details are required in electronic form Such identifying is essential when the information concerned is critical. There are increasing numbers of hospitals that have an RFID system to identify patients, for instance: [http://www.tsbtecnologias.es/e-health-products/SPHERAhospital/success-stories Hospital La Fe in Valencia(Spain)]; Wayne Memorial Hospital (USA); Royal Alexandria Hospital (UK).

=====Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE)=====
Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable errors in hospitals (IOM, 2000; 2007). The IOM (2006) estimates that each hospitalized patient, on average, is exposed to one medication error each day.<ref name=iom06>{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = Preventing Medication Errors | last = The Institute of Medicine | journal = The National Academies Press | url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11623.html | accessdate = 2006-07-21 }}</ref>  Computerized provider order entry (CPOE), formerly called [[computer physician order entry]], can reduce medication errors by 80% overall but more importantly decrease harm to patients by 55%.<ref>{{cite journal | author = David W. Bates, MD, et al. | year = 1998 | title = Effect of Computerized Physician Order Entry and a Team Intervention on Prevention of Serious Medication Errors | journal = JAMA | volume = 280 | pages = 1311–1316 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/280/15/1311 | accessdate = 2006-06-20 | doi = 10.1001/jama.280.15.1311 | pmid = 9794308 | issue = 15}}</ref>  A [[Leapfrog group|Leapfrog]] (2004) survey found that 16% of US clinics, hospitals, and medical practices are expected to utilize [[CPOE]] within 2 years.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hospital Quality & Safety Survey  | publisher = The Leapfrog Group  | year = 2004  | url = http://www.leapfroggroup.org/media/file/Leapfrog-Survey_Release-11-16-04.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2006-07-08}}</ref>
;Complete Safety Medication System
A standardized [[bar code]] system for dispensing drugs might prevent 25% of drug errors.<ref name=iom06 />  Despite ample evidence to reduce medication errors, compete medication delivery systems (barcoding and [[Electronic prescribing]]) have slow adoption by doctors and hospitals in the United States, due to concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Kaufman  | first = Marc  | title = Medication Errors Harming Millions, Report Says. Extensive National Study Finds Widespread, Costly Mistakes in Giving and Taking Medicine  | pages = A08  | publisher = The Washington Post   | date = 2005-07-21  | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/20/AR2006072000754.html  | accessdate = 2006-07-21 }}</ref> Such concerns are not inconsequential; standards for electronic prescribing for [[Medicare Part D]] conflict with regulations in many US states.<ref name=iom06 />

====Technological Iatrogenesis====
Technology induced errors are significant and increasingly more evident in care delivery systems.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Lohr  | first = Steve  | title = Doctors' Journal Says Computing Is No Panacea  | publisher = The New York Times  | date = 2005-03-09 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/technology/09compute.html?ei=5089&en=402b792e748d99a2&ex=1268110800&adxnnl=1&partner=rssyahoo&adxnnlx=1150474153-xVix1BcYkvTKJpuLyHStrQ  | accessdate = 2006-07-15 }}</ref>  
This idiosyncratic and potentially serious problems associated with HIT implementation has recently become a tangible concern for healthcare and information technology professionals. As such, the term technological iatrogenesis describes this new category of adverse events that are an emergent property resulting from technological innovation creating system and microsystem disturbances.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Patrick Palmieri, et al. | year = 2007 | title = Technological iatrogenesis: New risks force heightened management awareness | journal = Journal of Healthcare Risk Management | volume = 27 | number = 4 | url = http://www.hom.ba.ttu.edu/FordPub/Palmieri_JHCRM_2008_Technological%20iatrogenesis.pdf |format=PDF | pages = 19–24|accessdate =2008-07-02 | doi = 10.1002/jhrm.5600270405 | pmid = 20200891 | issue = 4}}</ref> Healthcare systems are complex and adaptive, meaning there are many networks and connections working simultaneously to produce certain outcomes. When these systems are under the increased stresses caused by the diffusion of new technology, unfamiliar and new process errors often result. If not recognized, over time these new errors can collectively lead to catastrophic system failures.  The term "e-iatrogenesis"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Weiner, et al. | year = 2007 | title =e-Iatrogenesis: The most critical unintended consequence of CPOE and other HIT | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 14 | number = 3 | url = http://www.jamia.org/cgi/reprint/14/3/387.pdf |format=PDF | pages = 387–388 | doi = 10.1197/jamia.M2338 | pmid = 17329719|accessdate =2008-08-24 | last2 = Kfuri | first2 = T | last3 = Chan | first3 = K | last4 = Fowles | first4 = JB | issue = 3 | pmc = 2244888}}</ref> can be used to describe the local error manifestation. The sources for these errors include:
*Prescriber and staff inexperience may lead to a false sense of security; that when technology suggests a course of action, errors are avoided.<ref name=barcode />
*Shortcut or default selections can override non-standard medication regimens for elderly or underweight patients, resulting in toxic doses.
*CPOE and automated drug dispensing was identified as a cause of error by 84% of over 500 health care facilities participating in a surveillance system by the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Santell | first=John P | year=2004 | url=http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/patientSafety/slideShows2004-12-09.pdf | title=Computer Related Errors: What Every Pharmacist Should Know | format = PDF | publisher=United States Pharmacopia  | accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref>
*Irrelevant or frequent warnings can interrupt work flow.
Solutions include ongoing changes in design to cope with unique medical settings, supervising overrides from automatic systems, and training (and re-training) all users.

===Evidence-based medicine===
[[File:PharyngitisAlgorithm.png|thumb|240px|National Guideline Clearinghouse [http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=8170&mode=full&ss=14 "Acute pharyngitis algorithm"]]]
[[Evidence-based medicine]] integrates an individual doctor's exam and diagnostic skills for a specific patient, with the best available evidence from medical research. The doctor's expertise includes both diagnostic skills and consideration of individual patient's rights and preferences in making decisions about his or her care. The clinician uses pertinent clinical research on the accuracy of diagnostic tests and the efficacy and safety of therapy, rehabilitation, and prevention to develop an individual plan of care.<ref>{{cite journal | author = David L Sackett, William M C Rosenberg, J A Muir Gray, R Brian Haynes, W Scott Richardson | year = 1996 | title = Editorials: Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 312 | pages = 71–72 | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/312/7023/71 | accessdate = 2006-06-28 | pmid = 8555924 | issue = 7023 | pmc = 2349778 }}</ref> The development of evidence-based recommendations for specific medical conditions, termed [[Guideline (medical)|clinical practice guidelines]] or "best practices", has accelerated in the past few years.  In the United States, over 1,700 guidelines (see example image, right) have been developed as a resource for physicians to apply to specific patient presentations.<ref name=guidelines>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: [http://www.guideline.gov/about/about.aspx The National Guideline Clearinghouse]</ref> The [[#The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence .28NICE.29|National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) in the United Kingdom provides detailed "clinical guidance" for both health care professionals and the public about specific medical conditions.<ref name=NICE>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) [http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=home Providing national guidance on promoting good health]</ref> National Guideline Agencies from all continents collaborate in the [[Guidelines International Network]], which entertains the largest guideline library worldwide.<ref>[[Ollenschlaeger|G.

===Quality and safety initiatives in community pharmacy practice===
Community pharmacy practice is making important advances in the quality and safety movement despite the limited number of federal and state regulations that exist and in the absence of national accreditation organizations such as the Joint Commission - a driving force for performance improvement in health care systems.  Community pharmacies are using automated drug dispensing devices (robots), computerized drug utilization review tools, and most recently, the ability to receive electronic prescriptions from prescribers to decrease the risk for error and increase the likelihood of delivering high quality of care.  

Quality Assurance (QA) in community practice is a relatively new concept. {{As of|2006}}, only 16 states have some form of legislation that regulates QA in community pharmacy practice.  While most state QA legislation focuses on error reduction, North Carolina has recently approved legislation<ref>[http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2005&BillID=hb1493 North Carolina General Assembly - House Bill 1493 Information/History (2005–2006 Session)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that requires the pharmacy QA program to include error reduction strategies and assessments of the quality of their pharmaceutical care outcomes and pharmacy services.<ref>Kessler, JM.  Pharmacy Quality Assurance.  Journal of the North Carolina Association of Pharmacists 2005: Winter</ref>

===Quality Improvement and Safety Initiatives in Pediatrics===
Quality improvement and patient safety is a major concern in the pediatric world of health care. This next section will focus on quality improvement and patient safety initiatives in inpatient settings.

Over the last several years, pediatric groups have partnered to improve general understanding, reporting, process improvement methodologies, and quality of pediatric inpatient care. These collaborations have created a robust program of projects, benchmarking efforts, and research.<ref name="ahrq.gov">Susan Lacey, Janis B. Smith, and Karen Cox. Patient Safety and Quality: An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses. www.ahrq.gov/qual/nurseshdbk/docs/LaceyS_PSQ.pdf</ref> Much of the research and focus on adverse events has been on medication errors–the most frequently reported adverse event for both adult and pediatric patients.<ref>Institutes of Medicine. To err is human: building a safer health system. Washington, DC: National Academies Press; 2000.</ref> It is also of interest to note that medication errors are also the most preventable type of harm that can occur within the pediatric population. It has been reported that when pediatric medication errors occur, these patients have a higher rate of death associated with the error than adult patients.<ref>Kaushal R, Bates DW, Landrigan C, et al. Medication errors and adverse drug events in pediatric inpatients, JAMA 2001; 284(16):2114-20</ref> A more recent review of potential pediatric safety issues conducted by Miller, Elixhauser, and Zhan found that hospitalized children who experienced a patient safety incident, compared with those who did not, had <ref>Miller MR, Elixhauser A, Zhan C. Patient safety events during pediatric hospitalizations. Pediatrics 2003 Jun;111(6):1358-66.</ref> 
* 1) Length of stay 2- to 6-fold longer
* 2) Hospital mortality 2- to 18-fold greater
* 3) Hospital charges 2- to 20-fold higher
In order to reduce these errors the attention on safety needs to revolve around designing safe systems and processes. Slonim and Pollack point out that safety is critical to reduce medical errors and adverse events. These problems can range from diagnostic and treatment errors to hospital-acquired infections, procedural complications, and failure to prevent problems such as pressure ulcers.<ref>AD Slonim and MM Pollack. Integrating the Institute of Medicine’s six quality aims into pediatric critical care: Relevance and applications. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine 2005 6(3), pp. 264-269.</ref> In addition to addressing quality and safety issues found in adult patients there are a few characteristics that are unique to the pediatric population.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Beal AC, Co JPT, Dougherty D ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | month = Jan | title = Quality Measures for Children's Health Care | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = 1| pages = 199–209 }}</ref> 

* '''Development:''' As children mature both cognitively and physically, their needs as consumers of health care goods and services change. Therefore, planning a unified approach to pediatric safety and quality is affected by the fluid nature of childhood development.
*
* '''Dependency:''' Hospitalized children, especially those who are very young and/or nonverbal, are dependent on caregivers, parents, or other surrogates to convey key information associated with patient encounters. Even when children can accurately express their needs, they are unlikely to receive the same acknowledgment accorded adult patients. In addition, because children are dependent on their caregivers, their care must be approved by parents or surrogates during all encounters.
*
* '''Different epidemiology:''' Most hospitalized children require acute episodic care, not care for chronic conditions as with adult patients. Planning safety and quality initiatives within a framework of “wellness, interrupted by acute conditions or exacerbations,” presents distinct challenges and requires a new way of thinking.
*
* '''Demographics:''' Children are more likely than other groups to live in poverty and experience racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Children are more dependent on public insurance, such as State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and Medicaid.

One of the main challenges faced by pediatric safety and quality efforts is that most of the work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for pediatric patient safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying pediatric adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced.<ref>Woods DM, Johnson J, Holl JL, et al. Anatomy of a patient safety event: pediatric patient safety taxonomy. Qual Saf Health Care 2005 Dec;14:422-7.</ref> Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate multisite studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.<ref name="ahrq.gov"/>

'''Leaders in Pediatric Safety and Quality'''

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the Federal authority for patient safety and quality of care and has been a leader in pediatric quality and safety. The AHRQ has developed Pediatric Quality Indicators (PedQIs) with the goal to highlight areas of quality concern and to target areas for further analysis.<ref>Pediatric Quality Indicators Overview. AHRQ Quality Indicators. February 2006. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/pdi_overview.htm.</ref> Eighteen pediatric quality indicators are included in the AHRQ quality measure modules; based on expert input, risk adjustment, and other considerations. Thirteen inpatient indicators are recommended for use at the hospital level, and five are designated area indicators. Inpatient indicators are treatments or conditions with the greatest potential of an adverse event for hospitalized children.<ref name="ahrq.gov"/> 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Pediatric Quality & Provider-Level Indicators !! Area-Level Indicators 
|-

Possible additions to the dataset will address the patient’s condition on admission and increase the understanding of how laboratory and pharmacy utilization impact patient outcomes. The goal of AHRQ is to refine the area-level indicators to improve outcomes for children receiving outpatient care and reduce the incidence of hospitalization for those defined conditions.<ref name="ahrq.gov"/>

'''Nurse Staffing and Pediatric Outcomes'''

While the number of nurses providing patient care is recognized as an inadequate measure of nursing care quality, there is hard evidence that nurse staffing is directly related to patient outcomes. Studies by Aiken and Needleman have demonstrated that patient death, nosocomial infections, cardiac arrest, and pressure ulcers are linked to inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios.<ref>Aiken LH, Clarke SP, Sloane DM, et al. Hospital nurse staffing and patient mortality, nurse burnout, and job dissatisfaction. JAMA 2002 Oct 23-30;288:1987-93.</ref><ref>Needleman J, Buerhaus P, Mattke S, et al. Nurse-staffing levels and the quality of care in hospitals. N Engl J Med 2002 May 30;346:1715-22.</ref> The presence or absence of registered nurses (RNs) impacts the outcome for pediatric patients requiring pain management and/or peripheral administration of intravenous fluids and/or medications. These two indicators of pediatric nursing care quality are sensitive measures of nursing care. Professional nurses play a key role in successful pain management, especially among pediatric patients unable to verbally describe pain. Astute assessment skills are required to intervene successfully and relieve discomfort.33 Maintenance of a patient’s intravenous access is a clear nursing responsibility. Pediatric patients are at increased risk for intravenous infiltration and for significant complications of infiltration, should it occur.<ref>Lamagne P, McPhee M. Troubleshooting pediatric peripheral IVs: phlebitis and infiltration. Nurs Spectrum 2004 (N Engl):;8(13):18-20.</ref><ref>Infusion Nursing Society. Infusion nursing standards of practice. J Intraven Nurs 2000: 23(6S):Suppl.S1-85.</ref>

The characteristics of effective indicators of pediatric nursing care quality include the following:<ref name="ahrq.gov"/> 
* '''Scalable:''' The indicators are applicable to pediatric patients across a broad range of units and hospitals, in both intensive care and general care settings.
* '''Feasible:''' Data collection does not pose undue burden on staff of participating units as the data is available from existing sources, such as the medical record or a quality improvement database, and can be collected in real time.
* '''Valid and reliable:''' Indicator measurement within and across participating sites is accurate and consistent over time.

'''Conclusions'''

Pediatric care is complex due to developmental and dependency issues associated with children. How these factors impact the specific processes of care is an area of science in which little is known. Throughout health care providing safe and high quality patient care continues to provide significant challenges. Efforts to improve the safety and quality of care are resource intensive and take continued commitment not only by those who deliver care, but also by agencies and foundations that fund this work. Advocates for children’s health care must be at the table when key policy and regulatory issues are discussed. Only then will the voice of our most vulnerable groups of health care consumers be heard.<ref name="ahrq.gov"/>

===Health literacy===
[[Health literacy]] is a common and serious safety concern.

===Pay for performance (P4P)===
{{Main|Pay for performance (healthcare)}}
{{Off-topic|date=May 2012}}

Pay for performance systems link compensation to measures of work quality or goals. {{As of|2005}}, 75 percent of all U.S. companies connect at least part of an employee's pay to measures of performance, and in healthcare, over 100 private and federal pilot programs are underway. Current methods of healthcare payment may actually reward less-safe care, since some insurance companies will not pay for new practices to reduce errors, while physicians and hospitals can bill for additional services that are needed when patients are injured by mistakes.<ref name=fiveyears>The Commonwealth Fund: [http://www.cmwf.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=278113 Five Years After "To Err Is Human": What Have We Learned?]</ref> However, early studies showed little gain in quality for the money spent,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Meredith B.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) began an ambitious pay for performance initiative in 2004, known as the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF).<ref name=UK/> General practitioners agreed to increases in existing income according to performance with respect to 146 quality indicators covering clinical care for 10 chronic diseases, organization of care, and patient experience. Unlike proposed quality incentive programs in the United States, funding for primary care was increased 20% over previous levels. This allowed practices to invest in extra staff and technology; 90% of [[general practitioner]]s use the [[NHS Electronic Prescription Service]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, and up to 50% use [[electronic health record]]s for the majority of clinical care{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Early analysis showed that substantially increasing physicians' pay based on their success in meeting quality performance measures is successful. The 8,000 family practitioners included in the study earned an average of $40,000 more by collecting nearly 97% of the points available.<ref name="pmid16870916">{{cite journal |author=Doran T, Fullwood C, Gravelle H, ''et al.'' |title=Pay-for-performance programs in family practices in the United Kingdom |journal=N.

A component of this program, known as '' exception reporting'', allows physicians to use criteria to exclude individual patients from the quality calculations that determine physician reimbursement.  There was initial concern that exception reporting would allow inappropriate exclusion of patients in whom targets were missed ("gaming"<ref>Wiktionary: [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/game_the_system Game the system]</ref>).  However, a 2008 study has shown little evidence of widespread gaming.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Tim Doran, M.D., Catherine Fullwood, Ph.D., David Reeves, Ph.D., Hugh Gravelle, Ph.D., and Martin Roland, D.M. |title=Exclusion of Patients from Pay-for-Performance Targets by English Physicians |journal=N.

====United States====

In the United States, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] has various pay-for-performance ("P4P") initiatives in offices, clinics and hospitals, seeking to improving quality and avoid unnecessary health care costs.<ref>Medicare: [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=1343 "Pay For Performance (P4P) Initiatives"]</ref> The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) has several demonstration projects underway offering compensation for improvements:

*Payments for '''better care coordination''' between home, hospital and offices for patients with chronic illnesses. In April 2005, CMS launched its first value-based purchasing pilot or "demonstration" project- the three-year Medicare Physician Group Practice (PGP) Demonstration.<ref>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=1341 Medicare Begins Performance-Based Payments For Physician Groups] (Retrieved 2007-04-15)</ref> The project involves ten large, multi-specialty physician practices caring for more than 200,000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Participating practices will phase in quality standards for preventive care and the management of common chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Practices meeting these standards will be eligible for rewards from savings due to resulting improvements in patient management. The ''First Evaluation Report to Congress'' in 2006 showed that the model rewarded high quality, efficient provision of health care, but the lack of up-front payment for the investment in new systems of case management "have made for an uncertain future with respect for any payments under the demonstration."<ref>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Medicare Physician Group Practice Demonstration: [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/DemoProjectsEvalRpts/downloads/PGP_Final_Congress.pdf First Evaluation Report to Congress] (Retrieved 2007-04-15)</ref>

*A set of 10 '''hospital quality measures''' which, if reported to CMS, will increase the payments that hospitals receive for each discharge. By the third year of the demonstration, those hospitals that do not meet a threshold on quality will be subject to reductions in payment. Preliminary data from the second year of the study indicates that pay for performance was associated with a roughly 2.5% to 4.0% improvement in compliance with quality measures, compared with the control hospitals.<ref name="pmid17259444">{{cite journal |author=Lindenauer PK, Remus D, Roman S, ''et al.'' |title=Public reporting and pay for performance in hospital quality improvement |journal=N.

====Complex illness====

Pay for performance programs often target patients with serious and complex illnesses; such patients commonly interact with multiple healthcare providers and facilities. However, pilot programs now underway focus on simple indicators such as improvement in lab values or use of emergency services, avoiding areas of complexity such as multiple complications or several treating specialists.<ref>American Academy of Neurology, Federal Legislation Position Statements: [http://www.aan.com/advocacy/federal/pdfs/P4P_statement.pdf Pay-For-Performance]  (Retrieved 2007-04-15)</ref> A 2007 study analyzing Medicare beneficiaries' healthcare visits showed that a median of two primary care physicians and five specialists provide care for a single patient.<ref name="pmid17360991">{{cite journal |author=Pham HH, Schrag D, O'Malley AS, Wu B, Bach PB |title=Care patterns in Medicare and their implications for pay for performance |journal=N.

===Public reporting===
====Mandatory reporting====
;Denmark :The Danish Act on Patient Safety<ref>[http://www.patientsikkerhed.dk/admin/media/pdf/133907d0940e4d5f751852ec8f6b1795.pdf Danish Act on Patient Safety]</ref> passed Parliament in June 2003, and on January 1, 2004, Denmark became the first country to introduce nation-wide mandatory reporting. The Act obligates frontline personnel to report adverse events to a national reporting system. Hospital owners are obligated to act on the reports and the National Board of Health is obligated to communicate the learning nationally. The reporting system is intended purely for learning and frontline personnel cannot experience sanctions for reporting. This is stated in Section 6 of the Danish Act on Patient Safety (as of January 1, 2007: Section 201 of the Danish Health Act): "A frontline person who reports an adverse event cannot as a result of that report be subjected to investigation or disciplinary action from the employer, the Board of Health or the Court of Justice." The reporting system and the Danish Patient Safety Database is described in further detail in a National Board of Health publication.<ref>[http://www.patientsikkerhed.dk/admin/media/pdf/0a9d4fdf5645d9b29a159288ff2a2a69.pdf Danish National Board of Health: Danish Patient Safety Database 2007]</ref>

;United Kingdom :The [[Patient safety organization#National Patient Safety Agency .28NPSA.29|National Patient Safety Agency]] encourages voluntary reporting of health care errors, but has several specific instances, known as "Confidential Enquiries", for which investigation is routinely initiated: maternal or infant deaths, childhood deaths to age 16, deaths in persons with mental illness, and perioperative and unexpected medical deaths. Medical records and questionnaires are requested from the involved clinician, and participation has been high, since individual details are confidential.<ref>National Confidential Enquiries {{PDF|1=[http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=212731 Strategy]}}</ref>

;United States :The 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report recommended "a nationwide mandatory reporting system … that provides for … collection of standardized information by state governments about adverse events that result in death or serious harm."<ref>Institute of Medicine: To Err is Human (1999) [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309068371/html/9.html Recommendation 5.1: Mandatory Reporting]</ref> Professional organizations, such as the [[#Prevalence of adverse events|Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation]], responded negatively: "Mandatory reporting systems in general create incentives for individuals and institutions to play a numbers game.

====Individual patient disclosures====
For a health care institution, disclosing an unanticipated event should be made as soon as possible. Some health care organizations may have a policy regarding the disclosure of unanticipated events. The amount of information presented to those effected is dependent on the the family's readiness and the organization's culture. The employee disclosing the event to family requires support from risk management, patient safety officers and senior leadership. Disclosures are objectively documented in the medical record.

====Voluntary disclosure====
In public surveys, a significant majority of those surveyed believe that health care providers should be required to report all serious medical errors publicly.<ref>US Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality: [http://www.ahrq.gov/news/ulp/ptsafety/ptsafety7.htm Beyond State Reporting: Medical Errors and Patient Safety Issues] (Accessed 2008-03-23)</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Melanie Hingorani, Tina Wong, Gilli Vafidis  | date=6 March 1999| title = Patients' and doctors' attitudes to amount of information given after unintended injury during treatment: cross sectional, questionnaire survey | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 318 | pages = 640–641 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7184/640 | accessdate = 2008-03-23 | pmid = 10066205 | issue = 7184 | pmc = 27769 }}</ref> However, reviews of the medical literature show little effect of publicly reported performance data on patient safety or the quality of care.<ref name=public>{{cite journal | author = Constance H.

======Performance======
In April 2008, consumer, employer and labor organizations announced an agreement with major physician organizations and health insurers on principles to measure and report doctors' performance on quality and cost.<ref>Consumer-Purchaser Disclosure Project: Consumers, Purchasers, Physicians, and Insurers Agree on Principles to Guide Physician Performance Reporting (2008-04-01):  [http://healthcaredisclosure.org/docs/files/PatientCharterDisclosureRelease040108.pdf News Release]</ref>

=====United Kingdom=====
In the United Kingdom, [[whistleblowing]] is well recognised and is government sanctioned, as a way to protect patients by encouraging employees to call attention to deficient services. Health authorities are encouraged to put local policies in place to protect whistleblowers.<ref>Whistleblowing.org [http://www.whistleblowing.org.uk/] Retrieved on 2008-03-17</ref><ref>UK Department of Health: News Release(1999-09-01: [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Pressreleases/DH_4025596 Government Moves To Halt Secrecy In NHS]  Retrieved 2008-03-17</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Naomi Craft | year = 1995 | title = Medicine and books:  Whistleblowing in the Health Service: Accountability, Law and Professional Practice; Whistleblowing: Subversion or Corporate Citizenship? | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 311 | page = 1444 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/311/7017/1444 | accessdate = 2008-03-17 | issue=7017}}</ref>

===Studies of patient safety===
Numerous organizations, government branches, and private companies conduct research studies to investigate the overall health of patient safety in America and across the globe. Despite the shocking and widely publicized statistics on preventable deaths due to medical errors in America's hospitals, the 2006 National Healthcare Quality Report<ref>AHRQ: [http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/nhqr06/nhqr06.htm 2006 National Healthcare Quality Report] Retrieved 2007-01-12</ref> assembled by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) had the following sobering assessment:<blockquote>
*Most measures of Quality are improving, but the pace of change remains modest.
*Quality improvement varies by setting and phase of care.
*The rate of improvement accelerated for some measures while a few continued to show deterioration.
*Variation in heath care quality remains high.</blockquote>

A 2011 study of more than 1,000 patients with advanced colon cancer found that one in eight was treated with at least one drug regimen with specific recommendations against their use in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The study focused on three chemotherapy regimens that were not supported by evidence from prior clinical studies or clinical practice guidelines. One treatment was rated "insufficient data to support," one had been "shown to be ineffective," and one was supported by "no data, nor is there a compelling rationale."  Many of the patients received multiple cycles of non-beneficial chemotherapy and some received two or more unproven treatments. Potential side effects for the treatments include [[hypertension]], heightened risk of bleeding and bowel perforation.<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110607094517.htm</ref>

==Organizations advocating patient safety==
{{Main|Patient safety organization}}
Several authors of the 1999 Institute of Medicine report revisited the status of their recommendations and the state of patient safety, five years after "To Err is Human".<ref name=fiveyears /> Discovering that patient safety had become a frequent topic for journalists, health care experts, and the public, it was harder to see overall improvements on a national level. What was noteworthy was the impact on attitudes and organizations. Few health care professionals now doubted that preventable medical injuries were a serious problem. The central concept of the report—that bad systems and not bad people lead to most errors—became established in patient safety efforts. A broad array of organizations now advance the cause of patient safety. For instance, in 2010 the principal European anaesthesiology organisations launched [[The Helsinki Declaration for Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology]], which incorporates many of the principles described above.
