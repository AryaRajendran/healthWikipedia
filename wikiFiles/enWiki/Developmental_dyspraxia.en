==Epidemiology==
Developmental dyspraxia is a lifelong [[neurological]] condition that is more common in males than in females, with a ratio of approximately four males to every female. The exact proportion of people with the disorder is unknown since the disorder can be difficult to detect due to a lack of specific laboratory tests, thus making diagnosis of the condition one of elimination of all other possible causes/diseases. Approximately 5–6% of children are affected by this condition.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Educational outreach and collaborative care enhances physician's perceived knowledge about Developmental Coordination Disorder | journal = BMC Health Services Research | date = 2008-01-22 | first = Robin | last = Gaines | coauthors = Cheryl Missiuna , Mary Egan, Jennifer McLean| id =  | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/8/21 | accessdate = 2011-07-20 | pmid=18218082 | doi=10.1186/1472-6963-8-21 | volume=8 | pmc=2254381 | pages=21}}</ref>

==Assessment and diagnosis==
Assessments for dyspraxia typically require a developmental history, detailing ages at which significant [[developmental milestones]], such as [[crawling]] and [[walking]], occurred. Motor skills screening includes activities designed to indicate dyspraxia, including balancing, physical sequencing, touch sensitivity, and variations on walking activities. A baseline motor assessment establishes the starting point for developmental intervention programs. Comparing children to normal rates of development may help to establish areas of significant difficulty.

However, research in the ''British Journal of Special Education'' has shown that knowledge is severely limited in many who should be trained to recognise and respond to various difficulties, including developmental coordination disorder, [[dyslexia]] and [[Deficits in Attention, Motor control and Perception|deficits in attention, motor control and perception (DAMP)]]. The earlier that difficulties are noted and timely assessments occur, the quicker intervention can begin.  A teacher or [[General practitioner|GP]] could miss a diagnosis if they are only applying a cursory knowledge.

<blockquote>"Teachers will not be able to recognise or accommodate the child with learning difficulties in class if their knowledge is limited. Similarly GPs will find it difficult to detect and appropriately refer children with learning difficulties."<ref>{{Cite document| title=Do teachers know more about specific learning difficulties than general practitioners?|last1=Kirby| first1=Amanda| last2=Davies| first2=Rhys| last3=Bryant| first3=Amy| publisher=British Journal of Special Education

==Developmental profiles==
Various areas of development can be affected by developmental dyspraxia and these will persist into adulthood,<ref name="Kirby et al, 2010"/> as dyspraxia has no cure. Often various coping strategies are developed, and these can be enhanced through occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, or psychological training.

===Speech and language===
Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD) is a type of ideational dyspraxia, causing linguistic or phonological impairment. This is the favoured term in the UK; however, it is also sometimes referred to as articulatory dyspraxia, and in the United States the usual term is [[Apraxia of speech|childhood apraxia of speech (CAS)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk/downloads/Developmental_Verbal_Dyspraxia.pdf+ |title=Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia - Pam Williams of Nuffield Hearing and Speech Centre |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Key problems include:
* Difficulties controlling the [[speech organ]]s.
* Difficulties making speech sounds
* Difficulty sequencing sounds
** Within a word
** Forming words into sentences
* Difficulty controlling breathing, suppressing salivation and [[phonation]] when talking or singing with lyrics.
* Slow [[language development]].
* Difficulty with feeding.

===Fine motor control===
Difficulties with fine motor co-ordination lead to problems with handwriting, which may be due to either ideational or ideo-motor difficulties. Problems associated with this area may include:
* Learning basic movement patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lacquaniti F |title=Central representations of human limb movement as revealed by studies of drawing and handwriting |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=287–91 |year=1989 |month=August |pmid=2475946 |doi= 10.1016/0166-2236(89)90008-8|url=}}</ref>
* Developing a desired writing speed.
* The acquisition of [[grapheme]]s – e.g. the letters of the [[Latin alphabet]], as well as numbers.
* Establishing the correct pencil grip<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical News Today - What is Dyspraxia? How is Dyspraxia treated?|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151951.php}}</ref>
* Hand aching while writing.

Fine-motor problems can also cause difficulty with a wide variety of other tasks such as using a knife and fork, fastening buttons and shoelaces, cooking, brushing one's teeth, applying cosmetics, styling one's hair, opening jars and packets, locking and unlocking doors, shaving, and doing housework.<ref name="dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk/services/ad_symptoms.php |title=Dyspraxia Foundation - Symptoms |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Whole body movement, coordination, and body image===
Issues with gross [[motor coordination]] mean that major developmental targets including walking, running, climbing and jumping can be affected. The difficulties vary from child to child and can include the following:

* Poor timing
* Poor balance (sometimes even falling over in mid-step).  Tripping over one's own feet is also common.
* Difficulty combining movements into a controlled sequence.
* Difficulty remembering the next movement in a sequence.
* Problems with spatial awareness, or [[proprioception]].
* Some people with dyspraxia have trouble picking up and holding onto simple objects such as picking pencils and things up, owing to poor muscle tone and/or proprioception.
* This disorder can cause an individual to be clumsy to the point of knocking things over and bumping into people accidentally.
* Some people with dyspraxia have difficulty in [[Relative direction#Left-right confusion|determining left from right]].
* Cross-laterality, ambidexterity, and a shift in the preferred hand are also common in people with dyspraxia.
* Problems with chewing foods
* People with dyspraxia may also have trouble determining the distance between themselves and other objects.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book | last1 = Biggs | first1 = Victoria | title = Caged in chaos : a dyspraxic guide to breaking free | chapter = 2 The Hidden People at Home | publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers | year = 2005 | location = London ; Philadelphia | accessdate = 2011-07-20 | isbn = 978-1-84310-347-9}}</ref>

==General difficulties==
In addition to the physical impairments, dyspraxia is associated with problems with memory, especially [[Working memory|short-term memory]].<ref name="dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Alloway TP, Rajendran G, Archibald LM |title=Working memory in children with developmental disorders |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=372–82 |year=2009 |pmid=19380495 |doi=10.1177/0022219409335214 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk/services/gu_symptoms.php |title=Dyspraxia Foundation - Symptoms (children) |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book | last1 = Biggs | first1 = Victoria | title = Caged in chaos : a dyspraxic guide to breaking free | chapter = 1 A Recipe for Chaos | publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers | year = 2005 | location = London ; Philadelphia | accessdate = 2011-07-20 |oclc=57316751 | isbn = 978-1-84310-347-9}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite book | last1 = Biggs | first1 = Victoria | title = Caged in chaos : a dyspraxic guide to breaking free | chapter = 3 A Survival Guide to School | publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers | year = 2005 | location = London ; Philadelphia | accessdate = 2011-07-20 |oclc=57316751  | isbn = 978-1-84310-347-9}}</ref> This typically results in difficulty remembering instructions, difficulty organizing one's time and remembering deadlines, increased propensity to lose things or problems carrying out tasks which require remembering several steps in sequence (such as cooking). Whilst most of the general population experience these problems to some extent, they have a much more significant impact on the lives of dyspraxic people.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> However, many dyspraxics have excellent [[Long-term memory|long-term memories]], despite poor [[short-term memory]].<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Many dyspraxics benefit from working in a structured environment,<ref>http://www.dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk/services/ad_employers.php</ref> as repeating the same routine minimises difficulty with time-management and allows them to commit procedures to long-term memory.

People with dyspraxia may have [[sensory processing disorder]], including abnormal oversensitivity or undersensitivity to physical stimuli, such as touch, light, sound, and smell.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> This may manifest itself as an inability to tolerate certain textures such as [[sandpaper]] or certain fabrics and including oral toleration of excessively textured food (commonly known as picky eating), or even being touched by another individual (in the case of touch oversensitivity) or may require the consistent use of sunglasses outdoors since sunlight may be intense enough to cause discomfort to a dyspraxic (in the case of light oversensitivity). An aversion to loud music and naturally loud environments (such as clubs and bars) is typical behavior of a dyspraxic individual who suffers from [[Hyperacusis|auditory oversensitivity]], while only being comfortable in unusually warm or cold environments is typical of a dyspraxic with temperature oversensitivity. Undersensitivity to stimuli may also cause problems. Dyspraxics who are undersensitive to pain may injure themselves without realising.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Some dyspraxics may be oversensitive to some stimuli and undersensitive to others.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>  These are commonly associated with [[autism]] spectrum conditions.

People with dyspraxia sometimes have difficulty moderating the amount of sensory information that their body is constantly sending them, so as a result these people are prone to [[panic attack]]s.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Having other autistic traits (which is common with dyspraxia and related conditions)<ref name="ReferenceA"/> may also contribute to sensory-induced panic attacks.

Dyspraxia can cause problems with perception of distance, and with the speed of moving objects and people<ref name="ReferenceB"/> This can cause problems moving in crowded places and crossing roads and can make learning to drive a car extremely difficult or impossible.

Many dyspraxics struggle to [[Relative direction#Left-right confusion|distinguish left from right]], even as adults, and have extremely poor sense of direction generally.<ref name="dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk"/>

Moderate to extreme difficulty doing physical tasks is experienced by some dyspraxics, and fatigue is common because so much extra energy is expended while trying to execute physical movements correctly. Some (but not all) dyspraxics suffer from [[hypotonia]], which in this case is chronically low muscle tone caused by dyspraxia. People with this condition can have very low muscle strength and endurance (even in comparison with other dyspraxics) and even the simplest physical activities may quickly cause soreness and fatigue, depending on the severity of the hypotonia. Hypotonia may worsen a dyspraxic's already poor balance.<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hypotonia/hypotonia.htm NINDS, information on hypotonia]</ref>

==Overlap with other conditions==
Dyspraxics may have other difficulties that are not due to dyspraxia itself but often co-exist with it. This is sometimes referred to as comorbidity.<ref name="titleAmanda Kirby speaking to dysTalk on The Co-occurrence of learning difficulties">{{cite web|url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/57-co-occurrence-of-learning-difficulties|title=Amanda Kirby speaking on the co-occurrence of learning difficulties|publisher=dysTalk|accessdate=2009-04-22|format=}}</ref> Dyspraxics may have characteristics of [[dyslexia]] (difficulty with reading and spelling), [[dyscalculia]] (difficulty with mathematics), [[dysgraphia]] (an inability to write neatly and/or draw), [[autism spectrum disorder]]<ref>Dziuk, M. A., Gidley Larson, J. C., Apostu, A., Mahone, E. M., Denckla, M. B., & Mostofsky, S. H. (2007). Dyspraxia in autism: Association with motor, social, and communicative deficits. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 49(10), 734-739. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17880641 <!--"Impaired performance of skilled gestures, referred to as dyspraxia, is consistently reported in children with autism"--></ref> or [[ADHD]] (poor attention span and impulsive behaviour). However, they are unlikely to have problems in all of these areas. The pattern of difficulty varies widely from person to person, and it is important to understand that a major weakness for one dyspraxic can be a strength or gift for another. For example, while some dyspraxics have difficulty with reading and spelling due to an overlap with dyslexia, or numeracy due to an overlap with dyscalculia, others may have brilliant reading and spelling or mathematical abilities. Some estimates show that up to 50% of dyspraxics have ADHD.<ref name="pmid22186361">{{cite journal |author=Fliers EA, Franke B, Buitelaar JK |title=[Motor problems in children with ADHD receive too little attention in clinical practice] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=155 |issue=50 |pages=A3559 |year=2011 |pmid=22186361 }}</ref>

Students with dyspraxia struggle most in visual-spatial memory. When compared to their peers who don’t have motor difficulties, students with dyspraxia are seven times more likely than typically developing students to achieve very poor scores in visual-spatial memory.<ref>{{cite journal|first=TP|last=Alloway|title=Working Memory, Reading and Mathematical Skills in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=96|issue=1|pages=20–36|year=2007|pmid=17010988|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2006.07.002}}</ref> As a result of this working memory impairment, students with dyspraxia have learning deficits as well.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/acp.1284|last1=Alloway|first1=TP|last2=Temple|first2=K|title=A Comparison of Working Memory Profiles and Learning in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder and Moderate Learning Difficulties|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=473–487|year=2007}}</ref>

Some students with dyspraxia can also have  comorbid [[specific language impairment]] (SLI). Research has found that students with dyspraxia and normal language skills still experience learning difficulties despite relative strengths in language. This means that for students with dyspraxia their working memory abilities determine their learning difficulties. Any strength in language that they have is not able to sufficiently support their learning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alloway|first1=TP|last2=Archibald|first2=L|title=Working Memory and Learning in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder and Specific Language Impairment|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=41|issue=3|pages=251–62|year=2008|pmid=18434291|doi=10.1177/0022219408315815}}</ref>

==Other names==
Collier first described developmental dyspraxia as 'congenital maladroitness'. [[Anna Jean Ayres|A. Jean Ayres]] referred to it as a disorder of sensory integration in 1972, while in 1975 Dr Sasson Gubbay called it the 'clumsy child syndrome'.<ref name="nzsupportgroup-whatisdyspraxia">{{cite web|url=http://74.53.228.194/~praxia/index.php?page=what-is-dyspraxia|title=What is dyspraxia?|author=The Dyspraxia Support Group of New Zealand|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> It has also been called minimal brain dysfunction although the two latter names are no longer in use. Other names include:

* Developmental Apraxia
* [[Deficits in attention, motor control and perception|Disorder of Attention and Motor Perception (DAMP)]]
* Dyspraxia
* Developmental Co-ordination Disorder (DCD) - a subtly different condition by definition, in practice, very similar.
* Motor Learning Difficulties
* Perceptuo-motor dysfunction
* Sensorimotor dysfunction<ref name="Gibbs et al 2007"/>

The World Health Organisation currently lists Developmental Dyspraxia as Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function.<ref name="nzsupportgroup-whatisdyspraxia"/>

==Notable dyspraxics==
Living people who have publicly stated they have been diagnosed with dyspraxia include actor [[Daniel Radcliffe]],<ref name="NZHarry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe has dyspraxia">{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2573230/Harry-Potters-Daniel-Radcliffe-has-dyspraxia.html |title=Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe has dyspraxia |accessdate=2010-05-16 |work= The Daily Telegraph|location=London |first=Chris |last=Irvine |date=2008-08-17}}</ref>
photographer [[David Bailey (photographer)|David Bailey]], [[Florence Welch]] from [[Florence and the Machine]], and actress [[Hannah McDonnell]].<ref name="NZHannah: You're not wrong and you're not broken">{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/health/hannah-youre-not-wrong-and-youre-not-broken-1673538.html |title=Hannah: You're not wrong and you're not broken |accessdate=2011-11-03 |work= Irish Independent |first=Andrea |last=Smith |date=2009-03-15}}</ref>

Writers suspected to have had the condition include [[Emily Brontë]], [[Charlotte Brontë]], poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[G.K. Chesterton]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[George Orwell]].

Helen Burns, a character from [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', is alleged to have been based on the author's dyspraxic elder sister [[Maria Bronte]].
