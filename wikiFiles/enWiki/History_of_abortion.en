The practice of [[abortion]], the termination of a [[pregnancy]] so that it does not result in [[birth]], dates back to ancient times. Pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of [[abortifacient]] herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques.

[[Abortion law]]s and their enforcement have fluctuated through various eras.  In many [[Western world|western nations]] during the 20th century various [[women's rights]] groups, doctors, and social reformers successfully worked to have abortion bans repealed. While abortion remains legal in most of the West, this legality is regularly challenged by [[anti-abortion]] groups.<ref name=frontline>{{cite video |date=2005-11-08 |title=The Last Abortion Clinic |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/clinic/ |publisher=[[Frontline (TV series)|Frontline]] |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref>

===Earliest evidence===

The written evidence of abortion reflects the interests of class and caste. Fines are listed in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], ca. 1760 BCE, for the crime of causing a miscarriage through assault, with the amount varying according to the social rank of the woman.<ref>Krason, Stephen, and Hollberg, Willian.

===Classical Greece===
Much of what is known about the methods and practice of abortion in Greek and Roman history comes from early classical texts. Abortion, as a gynecological procedure, was primarily the province of women who were either midwives or well-informed laypeople. In his ''Theaetetus'', Plato mentions a midwife's ability to induce abortion in the early stages of pregnancy.<ref name=past>{{Cite journal|last=Depierri |first=Kate P. |year=1968 |month=March |title=One Way of Unearthing the Past |journal=The American Journal of Nursing |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=521–524 |doi=10.2307/3453443 |pmid=4865614 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &#38|jstor=3453443 }}</ref><ref>[[Plato]] (1921) [{{circa|369&nbsp;BC}}].

The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed the fetus to be plantlike in nature, and not an animal until the moment of birth, when it finally breathed air.

The ancient Greeks relied upon the herb [[silphium]] as an abortifacient and contraceptive. The plant, as the chief export of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], was driven to [[extinction]], but it is suggested that it might have possessed the same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the [[Apiaceae|Apiaceae family]].

[[Pliny the Elder]] cited the refined oil of [[Common Rue|common rue]] as a potent abortifacient. [[Serenus Sammonicus]] wrote of a concoction which consisted of rue, [[egg (food)|egg]], and [[dill]]. Soranus, Dioscorides, [[Oribasius]] also detailed this application of the plant.

[[Aristolochia|Birthwort]], an herb used to ease [[childbirth]], was also used to induce abortion. [[Galen]] included it in a potion formula in ''de Antidotis'', while Dioscorides said it could be administered by mouth, or in the form of a [[vagina]]l pessary also containing [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[myrrh]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Riddle |first=John M. |authorlink=John M.

====Hippocratic Oath====
The [[Hippocratic oath|Oath]] is part of the Hippocratic [[text corpus|Corpus]]. Often ascribed to [[Hippocrates]], the [[Greek people|Greek]] physician, the Corpus is believed to be the collective work of Hippocratic practitioners. The Oath forbids the use of [[Pessary|pessaries]]  to induce abortion.

====Soranus' ''Gynecology''====
[[Soranus (Greek physician)|Soranus]], a 2nd century Greek physician, recommended abortion in cases involving health complications as well as emotional immaturity, and provided detailed suggestions in his work ''Gynecology''. [[Diuretic]]s, [[emmenagogue]]s, [[enemas]], fasting, and bloodletting were prescribed as safe abortion methods, although Soranus advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage, due to the risk of organ [[perforation]]. He also advised women wishing to abort their pregnancies to engage in energetic walking, carrying heavy objects, riding animals, and jumping so that the woman's heels were to touch her buttocks with each jump, which he described as the "Lacedaemonian Leap."<ref name=lefkowitz1992/><ref>Soranus.

=== Classical Rome ===
No evidences exists for the illegality of abortion under the Roman republic.  Attitudes changes with the spread of Christianity and around 211 CE emperors [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Caracalla]] banned abortion as infringing on parental rights; temporary exile was the punishment.<ref name=OCD>{{Citation | last = Sallares| first = J.

This new attitude is reflected in the third century legal compilation ''Pauli sententiae'' (attributed to [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus]]):  

<blockquote>
[T]hose who administer a beverage for the purpose of producing abortion, or of causing affection, although they may not do so with malicious intent, still, because the act offers a bad example, shall, if of humble rank, be sent to the mines; or, if higher in degree, shall be relegated to an island, with the loss of a portion of their property. If a man or a woman should lose his or her life through such an act, the guilty party shall undergo the extreme penalty."{{cn|date=October 2012}} 
</blockquote>

And also Ulpian, as it appears in the Digest regarding to the institution of ''curator ventris'' (protector of the womb): "An unborn child is considered being born, as far as it concerns his profits."  Despite this, abortion continued to be practiced "with little or no sense of shame."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hopkins |first=Keith |year=1965 |month=October |title=Contraception in the Roman Empire |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=124–151 |doi=10.1017/S0010417500003935 |jstor=177539}} "We know that Romans practiced abortion with little or no sense of shame." Hopkins cites R. Hähnel's "Der künstliche Abortus in Altertum," p.127.</ref> 


Suzanne Dixon, a senior lecturer in the Department of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Queensland, writes that abortion was a threat to traditional power structures in the classical [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world.  A husband had power over his wife, her body, and their children. She explains that writings from the classical world portray abortion as expressions of an ideological agenda where men maintain or reestablish patterns of power between the sexes, not as information about historical realities.<ref name=bakke>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VBN6r3cC6v0C&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=early+christianity+and+abortion When Children Became People: the birth of childhood in early Christianity] by Odd Magne Bakke</ref>{{rp|27}} Punishment for abortion in the Roman Republic was inflicted as a violation of the father's right to dispose of his offspring.<ref name="christianperspectives">[http://books.google.com/books?id=fVZXBeNCffwC Johannes M.

[[Tertullian]], a 2nd- and 3rd-century [[Christian]] [[theology|theologian]], also described surgical implements which were used in a procedure similar to the modern [[dilation and evacuation]]. One tool had a "nicely-adjusted flexible frame" used for dilation, an "annular blade" used to curette, and a "blunted or covered hook" used for extraction. The other was a "copper needle or spike."

Various methods of abortion were documented regionally in the 19th century and early 20th century. A paper published in 1870 on the abortion services to be found in [[Syracuse, New York]], concluded that the method most often practiced there during this time was to [[douche|flush]] inside of the uterus with injected water. The article's author, Ely Van de Warkle, claimed this procedure was affordable even to a [[maid]], as a man in town offered it for $10 on an [[installment plan]].<ref>{{Cite book|first=Ely |last=Van de Warkle |year=1870 |title=The detection of criminal abortion and a study of fœticidal drugs |url=http://www.archive.org/details/detectionofcrimi00vanduoft |publisher=James Campbell |location=Boston |accessdate=2008-12-14}}</ref> Other prices which 19th-century abortion providers are reported to have charged were much more steep.

In France during the latter half of the 19th century, social perceptions of abortion started to change. In the first half of the 19th century, abortion was viewed as the last resort for pregnant but unwed women. But as writers began to write about abortion in terms of family planning for married women, the practice of abortion was reconceptualized as a logical solution to [[unwanted pregnancies]] resulting from ineffectual contraceptives.<ref name=mclaren-french>{{Cite journal|last=McLaren |first=Angus |year=1978 |month=Spring |title=Abortion in France: Women and the Regulation of Family Size 1800–1914 |journal=French Historical Studies |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=461–484 [469] |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=7358418&site=ehost-live |accessdate= 2007-11-17 |quote=Increasingly, writers in the latter half of the nineteenth century no longer referred to abortion as a last resort for the single, seduced girl but as a family planning measure employed by the married woman.

In the United States and England, the latter half of the 19th century saw abortion become increasingly punished. One writer justified this by claiming that the number of abortions among married women had increased markedly since 1840.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=dfICAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22therapeutic%20abortion%22&pg=PA374#v=onepage&q&f=false Transactions of the Washington Obstetrical and Gynecological Society]</ref> In the United States, these laws had a limited effect on middle and upper class women who could, though often with great expense and difficulty, still obtain access to abortion, while poor and young women had access only to the most dangerous and illegal methods.<ref>Brodie, Janet Farrell.

The 20th century saw improvements in abortion technology, increasing its safety, and reducing its [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]]s. [[Vacuum]] devices, first described in medical literature in the 19th century, allowed for the development of [[suction-aspiration abortion]].<ref name="nafhistory"/> This method was practiced in the [[Soviet Union]], Japan, and China, before being introduced to [[UK|Britain]] and the United States in the 1960s.<ref name="nafhistory"/> The invention of the [[Karman cannula]], a flexible [[plastic]] [[cannula]] which replaced earlier metal models in the 1970s, reduced the occurrence of perforation and made suction-aspiration methods possible under [[local anesthesia]].<ref name=nafhistory/> In 1971, [[Lorraine Rothman]] and [[Carol Downer]], founding members of the feminist self-help movement, invented the Del-Em, a safe, cheap suction device that made it possible for people with minimal training to perform early abortions called [[menstrual extraction]].<ref name=nafhistory/> During the mid-1990s in the United States the medical community showed renewed interest in [[manual vacuum aspiration]] as a method of early surgical abortion. This resurgence is due to technological advances that permit early pregnancy detection (as soon as a week after conception) and a growing popular demand for safe, effective early abortion options, both surgical and medical. An innovator in the development of early surgical abortion services is Jerry Edwards, a physician, who developed a protocol in which women are offered an abortion using a handheld vacuum syringe as soon as a positive pregnancy test is received. This protocol also allows the early detection of an ectopic pregnancy.<ref name=nafhistory/>

[[Intact dilation and extraction]] was developed by Dr. James McMahon in 1983. It resembles a procedure used in the 19th century to save a woman's life in cases of obstructed labor, in which the fetal skull was first punctured with a perforator, then crushed and extracted with a [[forceps]]-like instrument, known as a [[cranioclast]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Atul |last=Gawande |authorlink=Atul Gawande |date=2006-10-09 |title=The Score: How Childbirth Went Industrial |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/09/061009fa_fact |accessdate=2008-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcgapultoscollection.com/dobfor.html |title=Destructive OB Forceps |first=F.

{{See also|Timeline of reproductive rights legislation|Abortion law|History of Abortion Law Debate}}

=== Effects of legislation on population ===

Abortion has been banned or restricted throughout history in countries around the world. Multiple scholars have noticed a that in many cases, this has caused women to seek dangerous, illegal abortions underground or inspired trips abroad for "reproductive tourism."<ref name="Whittaker">Whittaker, Andrew.

==== China ====

{{See also|Abortion in China}}

In the early 1950s, the Chinese government made abortion illegal, with punishments for those who received or performed illegal abortions written into the law.<ref name="Jing-Bao">Jing-Bao, Nie. ''Behind the Silence: Chinese Voices on Abortion'' Lanham, ML: Rowman & Litterfield Publishers, 2005.</ref> These restrictions were seen as the government's way of emphasizing the importance of population growth.<ref name="Jing-Bao"/> As the decade went on, however, the laws were relaxed with the intent of reducing the number of deaths and life-long injuries women sustained due to illegal abortions as well as serving as a form of population control when used in conjunction with birth control.<ref name="Jing-Bao"/> In the early 1980s, the state implemented a form of family planning which used abortion as a "back-up method"; and in 2005, there has been legislation trying to curb sex-selective abortion.<ref name="Jing-Bao"/>

==== India ====

{{See also|Abortion in India}}

India enforced the [[Indian Penal Code]] from 1860 to 1971, criminalizing abortion and punishing both the practitioners and the women who sought out the procedure.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/> As a result, countless women died in an attempt to obtain illegal abortions from unqualified midwives and "doctors."<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/> Abortion was made legal under specific circumstances in 1971, but as scholar S. Chandrasekhar notes, lower class women still find themselves at a greater risk of injury or death as a result of a botched abortion.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>

==== Japan ====

{{See also|Abortion in Japan}}

Japan is known today worldwide for its acceptance of abortion.<ref name="Whittaker">Whittaker, Andrea. "Abortion in Asia: An Overview." In Whittaker, Andrea, ed.

''Abortion before Birth Control: The Politics of Reproduction in Postwar Japan'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001.</ref> It is estimated that two-thirds of Japanese women have an abortion by age forty, partially due to former government restrictions on contraceptive pills on 'public hygiene grounds'.<ref name="Whittaker"/> 

The Eugenics Protection Law of 1948 made abortion on demand legal up to twenty-two weeks' gestation so long as the woman's health was endangered; in 1949, this law was extended to consider the risk the child's birth would place on a woman's economic welfare.<ref name="Whittaker"/><ref name="Norgren"/> Originally, each case would have to be approved by a local eugenics council, but this law was removed from the law in 1952, making the decision a private one between a woman and her physician.<ref name="Whittaker"/><ref name="Norgren"/>

In 1964, the creation of the conservative right-wing nationalist political lobbying group called [[Seicho-no-Ie]] brought about a strong opposition to the abortion laws.<ref name="Whittaker"/>  This campaign reached its peak strength in the early 1980s, but ultimately failed in 1983.<ref name="Whittaker"/>

==== Romania ====

{{See also|Abortion in Romania}}

In 1957, Romania legalized abortion, but in 1966, after a decline in the national birthrate, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] approved Decree 770, which criminalized abortion and encouraged childbirth. As a result of this decree, women were forced to seek out illegal methods of abortion that caused the deaths of over 9,000 women and left countless unwanted children abandoned in orphanages. Abortion remained illegal until 1989, when the decree was overturned.<ref name="Kligman short">Kligman, Gail. "Political Demography: The Banning of Abortion in Ceausescu's Romania."

==== Thailand ====

There was intense public debate throughout the 1980s and 1990s over legal abortion reform.<ref name="Whittaker"/>  These debates portrayed abortion as un-Buddhist and anti-religious; abortion opponents ultimately labeled it as a form of Western corruption that was inherently anti-Thai and threatened the integrity of the nation.<ref name="Whittaker"/>  Despite this, in 2006, abortions became legal in cases of [[rape]] or [[foetal impairment]].<ref name="Whittaker"/>  Mental health also became a factor in determining the legality of an abortion procedure.<ref name="Whittaker"/>  The strict regulations involved in qualifying for a legal abortion, however, cause approximately 300,000 women a year to seek illegal avenues according to scholar Andrea Whittaker, with the poorest undergoing the most dangerous of procedures.<ref name="Whittaker"/>

[This is good; don't know where it goes yet.]

In the West, the matter was dealt with in [[Ecclesiastical courts]], which treated abortion of an "unformed fetus" (prior to [[quickening]]) as ''quasi-homicide'', imposing a lesser penance than for full homicide. Starting with ''Leges Henrici Primi'', around 1115, abortion was treated as a misdeamenor prior to "[[quickening]]," accruing a penalty of 3 years' penance, or as a "quasi homicide," with ten years' penance, after quickening.<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/445/Abortion-Abortion-in-English-law.html Abortion - Abortion In English Law]</ref>  With the notable exception of [[Henry Bracton]],<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[Henry de Bracton]] |chapter=The crime of homicide and the divisions into which it falls |editor=George E.

[[William Staunford]] first formulated the [[born alive rule]] in accordance with the definition of [[Murder in English law]], which states that the victim be "a reasonable creature ''in rerum natura''," language which dates back to the [[Leges Henrici Primi]]. [[William Blackstone]]'s commentaries are usually consulted for the modern formulation of this rule.
