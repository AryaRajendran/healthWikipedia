'''Patient-centered care''' supports active involvement of patients and their families in the design of new care models and in decision-making about individual options for treatment. The IOM (Institute of Medicine) defines patient-centered care as: "Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions." <ref name=IOM_2001/> Patient-centered care is also one of the overreaching goals of [[health advocacy]], in addition to safer medical systems, and greater patient involvement in healthcare delivery and design.<ref>Jo Anne L. Earp, Elizabeth A. French, & Melissa B. Gilkey: Patient Advocacy for Health Care Quality.</ref>  Given that non-consumer stakeholders often don't know what matters most to patients regarding their ability to get and stay well,<ref name=Sepucha>{{cite journal|last=Sepucha|first=Karen|coauthors=Uzogarra, Barry, O'Connor, Mulley|title=Developing instruments to measure the quality of decisions: early results for a set of symp tom-driven decisions|journal=Patient Educ Counsel.|year=2008|volume=73|issue=3|pages=504–510}}</ref> care that is truly patient-centered cannot be achieved without active patient engagement at every level of care design and implementation.

==Attributes==
These four attributes of patient-centered care are the following:<ref name=Bechtel>{{cite web|last=Bechtel|first=Christine|title=If You Build it, Will They Come?

* "Whole-person" care.
* Coordination and communication
* Patient support and empowerment
* Ready access

Patient-centered care is about much more than simply educating patients about a diagnosis, potential treatment, or healthy behavior.  It does not mean giving patients whatever they want; rather, patients want guidance from their care providers, but they expect that guidance to be provided in the context of full and unbiased information about options, benefits, and risks.  “Patient-centered” means considering patients’ cultural traditions, personal preferences and values, family situations, social circumstances and lifestyles, as used by the [[Institute of Medicine]] and [[Institute for Healthcare Improvement]].<ref name=IHI>Institute for Healthcare Improvement. http://www.ihi.org/IHI/Topics/PatientCenteredCare/PatientCenteredCareGeneral/</ref> A 2001 [[Institute of Medicine]] report identified a focus on patient-centered care as one of six interrelated factors constituting high-quality health care.<ref Name=IOM_2001>{{cite web|title=Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century|url=http://iom.edu/Reports/2001/Crossing-the-Quality-Chasm-A-New-Health-System-for-the-21st-Century.aspx|author=Institute on Medicine|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref>
Patient centered care leads to higher level of patient engagement. The 5 constituent dimensions of patient engagement include: communication, provider effectiveness, alignment of objective, information & encouragement, and patient incentive. <ref name="JHWS_Gill2013">{{cite journal |first1=P.S. |last1=Gill |title=Improving Health Outcomes: Applying Dimensions of Employee Engagement to Patients |journal=The International Journal of Health, Wellness and Society |volume=3 |issue=1|year=2013 |pages=1-9|url=http://ijw.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.198/prod.116 }}</ref> Engaged patients seem to have better perceived health outcomes. <ref name="IJGM_Gill2013">{{cite journal |first1=P.S. |last1=Gill |title=Patient Engagement: An investigation at a primary care clinic |journal=International Journal of General Medicine  |volume=6 |year=2013 |pages=85-98|url=http://www.dovepress.com/patient-engagement-an-investigation-at-a-primary-care-clinic-peer-reviewed-article-IJGM |doi=10.2147/IJGM.S42226}}</ref>

==Perspectives==
Don Berwick, formerly of IHI, defined patient-centered care as:
The experience (to the extent the informed, individual patient desires it) of transparency, individualization,
recognition, respect, dignity, and choice in all matters, without exception, related to one’s person, circumstances,
and relationships in health care.<ref name=Berwick>{{cite web|last=Berwick|first=Don|title=What Patient-Centered Should Mean: Confessions of an Extremist|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/4/w555.full|work=Health Affairs Web Exclusive|accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref>

Patient-centered care is also about empowering patients by giving the right weight to their opinions about the health-care system.<ref name =campat>

In its ''Declaration on Patient-Centred Healthcare'', The International Alliance of Patients' Organizations (IAPO) states that the essence of patient-centered healthcare is that the healthcare system is designed and delivered to address the healthcare needs and preferences of patients so that healthcare is appropriate and cost-effective. The Declaration sets out five principles of patient-centered healthcare: respect; choice and empowerment; patient involvement in health policy; access and support and information.<ref name=IAPO_2006>{{cite web|last=International Alliance of Patients' Organizations (IAPO, 2006) |title=Declaration on Patient-Centred Healthcare|url=http://www.patientsorganizations.org/showarticle.pl?id=712&n=312|accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref>
