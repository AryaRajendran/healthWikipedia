'''Purpura''' (from {{lang-la|purpura}}, meaning "purple") is the appearance of red or purple discolorations on the [[skin]] that do not [[Blanch (medical)|blanch]] on applying pressure. They are caused by [[bleeding]] underneath the skin usually secondary to [[vasculitis]] or dietary deficiency of vitamin C ([[scurvy]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=UCSF Purpura Module|url=http://www.dermatology.ucsf.edu/education_training/140.01ClinicalDermatology/Module.8.Purpura%20Module%20REVISED2.pdf}}</ref> Purpura measure 0.3–1&nbsp;cm (3–10&nbsp;mm), whereas [[petechia]]e measure less than 3&nbsp;mm, and [[Ecchymosis|ecchymoses]] greater than 1&nbsp;cm.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book |author=Mitchell RS; Kumar V; Robbins SL; Abbas AK; Fausto N |title=Robbins basic pathology (8th ed.) |publisher=[[Elsevier|Saunders/Elsevier]] |location= |year=2007 |pages= 10–11 |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

This is common with [[typhus]] and can be present with [[meningitis]] caused by meningococcal meningitis or [[Sepsis|septicaemia]].  In particular, meningococcus (''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]''), a [[Gram-negative]] diplococcus organism, releases endotoxin when it lyses.  Endotoxin activates the Hageman factor (clotting factor XII), which causes [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).  The DIC is what appears as a rash on the affected individual.

==Classification==
Purpura are a common and nonspecific medical sign; however, the underlying mechanism commonly involves one of the following:

*[[Platelet|Platelet disorders]] ([[Thrombocytopenic purpura]])
**[[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura|Primary thrombocytopenic purpura]]
**Secondary thrombocytopenic purpura
**[[Post-transfusion purpura]]
*Vascular disorders ([[nonthrombocytopenic purpura]])
**Microvascular injury, as seen in senile (old age) purpura, when blood vessels are more easily damaged
**[[Hypertensive]] states
**Deficient vascular support
**[[Vasculitis]], as in the case of [[Henoch-Schönlein purpura]]
*[[Coagulopathy|Coagulation disorders]]
**[[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC)
**[[Scurvy]] ([[vitamin C]] deficiency) - defect in collagen synthesis due to lack of hydroxylation of procollagen results in weakened capillary walls and cells
*[[Meningococcal disease|Meningococcemia]]
*[[Cocaine]] use with concomitant use of the one-time chemotherapy drug and now veterinary deworming agent [[levamisole]] is added predominantly by South American cocaine traffickers to cocaine because it dilutes, cuts it, and supposedly makes it cheaper prolonging the high.  This chemical combination can cause purpura of the ears, face, trunk, or extremities, sometimes needing [[reconstructive surgery]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Toxic Effects of Levamisole in a Cocaine User|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1008722|publisher=New England Journal of Medicine}}</ref>
There are also cases of [[psychogenic]] purpura described in the medical literature,<ref name="pmid10069314">{{cite journal |author=Anderson JE, DeGoff W, McNamara M |title=Autoerythrocyte sensitization (psychogenic purpura): a case report and review of the literature |journal=Pediatric emergency care |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=47–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10069314 |doi=10.1097/00006565-199902000-00014}}</ref> some claimed to be due to "autoerythrocyte sensitization". Other studies<ref name="pmid8340191">{{cite journal |author=Lotti T, Benci M, Sarti MG, Teofoli P, Senesi C, Bonan P, et al. |title=Psychogenic purpura with abnormally increased tPA dependent cutaneous fibrinolytic activity |journal=Int J Dermatol |volume=32| issue=7 |pages=521–3 |year=1993 |pmid=8340191 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1993.tb02840.x}}</ref> suggest the local (cutaneous) activity of [[Tissue plasminogen activator|tPA]] can be increased in psychogenic purpura, leading to substantial amounts of localized plasmin activity, rapid degradation of fibrin clots, and resultant bleeding. Petechial rash is also characteristic of a [[rickettsial]] infection.
