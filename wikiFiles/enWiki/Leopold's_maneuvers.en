[[Image:Handgriffe.JPG|thumb|Leopold's Maneuvers]]
In [[obstetrics]], '''Leopold's Maneuvers''' are a common and systematic way to determine the position of a [[fetus]] inside the woman's [[uterus]]; they are named after the gynecologist [[Christian Gerhard Leopold]]. They are also used to estimate term fetal weight.<ref name="pmid12012878">{{cite journal |author=Nahum GG |title=Predicting fetal weight. Are Leopold's maneuvers still worth teaching to medical students and house staff? |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=271â€“8 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=12012878 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

The maneuvers consist of four distinct actions, each helping to determine the position of the fetus. The maneuvers are important because they help determine the position and presentation of the [[fetus]], which in conjunction with correct [[Health assessment|assessment]] of the shape of the [[Mother|maternal]] [[human pelvis|pelvis]] can indicate whether the [[Childbirth|delivery]] is going to be complicated, or whether a [[Cesarean section]] is necessary.

The [[Physical examination|examiner's]] skill and practice in performing the maneuvers are the primary factor in whether the fetal lie is correctly ascertained, and so the maneuvers are not truly [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]]. Actual position can only be determined by [[ultrasound]] performed by a competent [[technician]] or [[physician]].

==Performing the maneuvers==
Leopold's Maneuvers are difficult to perform on [[obesity|obese]] [[woman|women]] and women who have [[polyhydramnios]]. The [[palpation]] can sometimes be [[Pain and nociception|uncomfortable]] for the woman if care is not taken to ensure she is relaxed and adequately positioned. To aid in this, the [[health care provider]] should first ensure that the woman has recently emptied her [[urinary bladder|bladder]]. If she has not, she may need to have a straight urinary [[catheter]] inserted to empty it if she is unable to [[micturate]] herself. The woman should lie on her back with her [[shoulder]]s raised slightly on a pillow and her [[knee]]s drawn up a little. Her [[abdomen]] should be uncovered, and most women appreciate it if the individual performing the maneuver warms their hands prior to  [[palpation]].

===First maneuver: Fundal Grip===
While facing the woman, [[palpate]] the woman's upper abdomen with both hands. A professional can often determine the size, consistency, shape, and mobility of the form that is felt. The [[fetal]] head is hard, firm, round, and moves independently of the [[Torso|trunk]] while the [[buttocks]] feel softer, are [[Symmetry|symmetric]], and the shoulders and limbs have small bony [[Bone|processes]]; unlike the [[Human head|head]], they move with the [[Torso|trunk]].

===Second maneuver: Umbilical Grip===
After the upper [[abdomen]] has been palpated and the form that is found is identified, the individual performing the maneuver attempts to determine the location of the fetal back. Still facing the woman, the health care provider palpates the abdomen with gentle but also deep pressure using the palm of the [[hand]]s. First the right hand remains steady on one side of the abdomen while the left hand explores the right side of the woman's [[uterus]]. This is then repeated using the opposite side and hands. The fetal back will feel firm and smooth while fetal [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]] (arms, legs, etc.) should feel like small irregularities and protrusions. The fetal back, once determined, should connect with the form found in the upper abdomen and also a mass in the [[Pelvimetry|maternal inlet]], lower abdomen.

===Third maneuver:  Pawlick's Grip===
In the third maneuver the health care provider attempts to determine what fetal part is lying above the inlet, or lower abdomen.<ref name="urlPregnancy - antenatal checks of your baby - Better Health Channel.">{{cite web |url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Antenatal_checks_of_your_baby?OpenDocument |title=Pregnancy - antenatal checks of your baby - Better Health Channel. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> The individual performing the maneuver first grasps the lower portion of the abdomen just above the [[pubic symphysis]] with the [[thumb]] and [[finger]]s of the right hand. This maneuver should yield the opposite information and validate the findings of the first maneuver. If the woman enters [[Childbirth|labor]], this is the part which will most likely come first in a [[Childbirth|vaginal birth]]. If it is the head and is not actively engaged in the [[Childbirth|birthing process]], it may be gently pushed back and forth.
The Pawlick's Grip, although still used by some obstetricians, is not recommended as  it is more uncomfortable for the woman. Instead, a two-handed approach is favored by placing the fingers of both hands laterally on either side of the presenting part.

===Fourth maneuver:  Pelvic Grip===
The last maneuver requires that the health care provider face the woman's feet, as he or she will attempt to locate the fetus' [[Forehead|brow]]. The fingers of both hands are moved gently down the sides of the [[uterus]] toward the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]]. The side where there is resistance to the descent of the fingers toward the pubis is greatest is where the [[Forehead|brow]] is located. If the head of the fetus is well-flexed, it should be on the opposite side from the fetal [[Human back|back]]. If the fetal head is extended though, the [[occiput]] is instead felt and is located on the same side as the back.

==Cautions==

Leopold's maneuvers are intended to be performed by [[Health care provider|health care professionals]], as they have received the training and instruction in how to perform them. That said, as long as care taken not to roughly or excessively disturb the fetus, there is no real reason it cannot be performed at [[home]] as an informational exercise. It is important to note that all findings are not truly [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]], and as such [[ultrasound]] is required to conclusively determine the fetal position.
