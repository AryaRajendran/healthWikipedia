== Background ==

After a golf injury caused Dr. Darrow chronic pain, he discovered [[Prolotherapy]] (short for “proliferation therapy”) which promotes rapid, or prolific, growth of cartilage and collagen integral in human joint function.<ref> [http://prolotherapy.com/prolodefine.htm Prolotherapy]</ref> Such growth occurs when benign natural substances are injected into targeted areas of the body known as “trigger points,” activating the natural healing process and growth of new collagen and cartilage.<ref> http://www.sportsmedicalcenter.com/painrelief.htm </ref> By rejuvenating deteriorated connective tissue and joint capsules, chronic pain can be relieved.<ref> [http://www.connecticutcenterforhealth.com/prolotherapy.html Connecticut Center for Health] </ref>

Such chronic pain is suffered by millions of Americans, even avid sports enthusiasts like Darrow himself. After realizing the healing potential of the then little-known Prolotherapy,<ref>[http://www.sportsrehabtreatment.com/marc_darrow_prolotherapy_los_angeles.htm Sports Rehab Treatment]</ref> Darrow devoted his practice to bringing his methods to many suffering with debilitating pain, eventually developing an approach called the Trinity of Healing.<ref>[http://jointrehab.com/doctor-marc-darrow.htm Trinity of Healing]</ref> This threefold method focuses on treating the body in need of repair, the mind coping with the pain, and the emotional state of the patient helping them to transcend the physical and move to a higher level of consciousness.<ref> [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0971450323 Amazon Books: Prolotherapy - Living Pain Free]</ref>
