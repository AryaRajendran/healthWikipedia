'''Verotoxin-producing ''Escherichia coli''''' consists of strains of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' that, when infecting humans, have been linked with the severe complication [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS). They are known by a number of names, including '''[[enterohemorrhagic]] ''E. coli''''' (EHEC), '''shiga-like toxin-producing ''E. coli''''' (STEC or SLTEC), '''hemolytic uremic syndrome–associated enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli''''' (HUSEC) and '''verocytotoxin-''' or '''verotoxin-producing ''E. coli''''' ('''VTEC''').<ref name=Karch_2005>{{cite journal|author=Karch H, Tarr P, Bielaszewska M|title=Enterohaemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'' in human medicine.|journal=Int J Med Microbiol|volume=295|issue=6-7|pages=405–18|year=2005|pmid=16238016|doi=10.1016/j.ijmm.2005.06.009}}</ref>

All these ''E. coli'' strains produce [[Shiga-like toxin]] (also known as verotoxin), a major cause of [[foodborne illness]].  These are distinguished from other pathotypes of intestinal pathogenic ''E. coli'' including enterotoxigenic ''E. coli'' (ETEC), enteropathogenic ''E. coli'' (EPEC), enteroinvasive ''E. coli'' (EIEC), enteroaggregative ''E. coli'' (EAEC), and diffusely adherent ''E. coli'' (DAEC).<ref name=Bae>{{cite journal|pmc=2688167 |title=A Case of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Caused by Escherichia coli O104:H4|author=Woo Kyun Bae, Youn Kyoung Lee, Min Seok Cho, Seong Kwon Ma, Soo Wan Kim, Nam Ho Kim, and Ki Chul Choi|journal=Yonsei Med J||date=2006-06-30|volume=47|issue=3|pages=437–439|pmid=16807997|doi=10.3349/ymj.2006.47.3.437}}  Two sentences were taken from this source verbatim.</ref>

The best known of these strains is [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]], but non-O157 strains cause an estimated 36,000 illnesses, 1,000 hospitalizations and 30 deaths in the United States yearly.<ref name = fsn>{{cite news |title=Lawyer Battles FSIS on Non-O157 E. coli |author=Zach Mallove |url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2010/04/marler-seeks-great-e-coli-regulation |newspaper=Food Safety News |date=26 April 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> Food safety specialists recognize "Big Six" strains; O26, O45, O103, O111, [[Escherichia coli O121|O121]], and O145.<ref name = fsn/>  A [[2011 E. coli O104:H4 outbreak|2011 outbreak in Germany]] was caused by another STEC, [[Escherichia coli O104:H4|O104:H4]]. This strain has both enteroaggregative and enterohemorrhagic properties. Both the O145 and O104 strains can cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome; the former strain shown to account for 2% to 51% of known HUS cases; an estimated 56% of such cases are caused by O145 and 14% by other EHEC strains.

EHECs that induce bloody diarrhea lead to HUS in 10% of cases. The clinical manifestations of postdiarrheal HUS include [[acute kidney injury|acute renal failure]], [[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]].  The verocytotoxin (shiga-like toxin) can directly damage renal and endothelial cells.  Thrombocytopenia occurs as platelets are consumed by clotting.  Hemolytic anemia results from intravascular [[fibrin]] deposition, increased fragility of red blood cells, and fragmentation.<ref name=Bae />

Antibiotics are of questionable value and have not shown to be of clear clinical benefit. Antibiotics that interfere with DNA synthesis, such as [[fluoroquinolones]], have been shown to induce the Stx-bearing bacteriophage and cause increased production of toxins.<ref>Zhang X, McDaniel AD, Wolf LE, Keusch GT, Waldor MK, Acheson DW. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10669353 Quinolone antibiotics induce Shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophages, toxin production, and death in mice.] J Infect Dis. 2000 Feb;181(2):664-70. PMID 10669353.</ref> Attempts to block toxin production with antibacterials which target the ribosomal protein synthesis are conceptually more attractive. [[Plasmapheresis|Plasma exchange]] offers a controversial but possibly helpful treatment. The use of [[antimotility agent]]s (medications that suppress diarrhea by slowing bowel transit) in children under 10 years of age or in elderly patients should be avoided, as they increase the risk of HUS with EHEC infections.<ref name=Bae />
