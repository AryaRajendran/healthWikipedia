'''Patient participation''', also called shared decision making, is a process in which both the patient and physician contribute to the medical decision-making process. Under this operating system, health care providers explain treatments and alternatives to patients in order to provide the necessary resources for patients to choose the treatment option that most closely aligns with their unique cultural and personal beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Florin|first=J|coauthors=Ehrenberg, A., & Ehnfors, M.|title=Clinical decision-making: Predictors of patient participation in nursing care|journal=Journal Of Clinical Nursing|year=2008|volume=17|issue=21|pages=2935–2944|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02328.x}}</ref>  In contrast, the current dominant form of medicine, the biomedical care system, places physicians in a position of authority with patients playing a passive role in care.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lyttle|first=D.J.|coauthors=Ryan, A.|title=Factors' influencing older patients' participation in care: A review of the literature|journal=International Journal Of Older People Nursing|year=2010|volume=5|issue=4|pages=274–282|doi=10.1111/j.1748-3743.2010.00245.x}}</ref>  Under this paradigm, known as medical paternalism, physicians instruct patients about what to do, and the patients often follow the physicians' advice.<ref name="pmid11664929">{{cite journal | author = Buchanan A | title = Medical paternalism | journal = Philos Public Aff | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–90 | year = 1978 | pmid = 11664929 | doi =  }}</ref> Relatively recently, however, a general shift has occurred in which patients are more involved in medical decision-making than before.<ref name="pmid8409892">{{cite journal | author = Epstein RM, Campbell TL, Cohen-Cole SA, McWhinney IR, Smilkstein G | title = Perspectives on patient-doctor communication | journal = J Fam Pract | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 377–88 | year = 1993 | month = October | pmid = 8409892 | doi = }}</ref> A recent review of 115 patient participation studies, for example, found that the majority of respondents preferred to participate in medical-decision making in only 50% of studies prior to 2000, while 71% of studies after 2000 found a majority of respondents who wanted to participate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chewning|first=Betty|coauthors=Bylund, Carma L., Shah, Bupendra, Arora, Neeraj K., Gueguen, Jennifer A., Makoul, Gregory|title=Patient preferences for shared decisions: A systematic review|journal=Patient Education And Counseling|year=2012|volume=86|issue=1|pages=9–18|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2011.02.004}}</ref> Variations of each method, including medical paternalism and patient participation, may be preferred by different patients.

Many well-renowned health agencies, including the American Cancer Society<ref>{{cite journal|last=von Eschenbach|first=A.|coauthors=Ho, R., Murphy, G. P., Cunningham, M., and Lins, N.|title=American Cancer Society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 1997|journal=CA Cancer Journal Clin|year=1997|volume=17|pages=261–264}}</ref> and the American College of Physicians,<ref name="pmid9072936">{{cite journal | author = Coley CM, Barry MJ, Mulley AG | title = Screening for prostate cancer.

Med. | volume = 126 | issue = 6 | pages = 480–4 | year = 1997 | month = March | pmid = 9072936 | doi = }}</ref> recommend a shared decision model in their medical practices.

== Patient Autonomy and Informed Consent ==
In recognition of the fact that many factors influence medical decisions, the basic premise of patient participation emphasizes patient autonomy. The model recognizes that patients have personal values that influence the interpretation of risks and benefits differently from a physician. Frequently, there is more than one option with no clear choice of which option is best; this occurs when the decision at hand is about a preference-sensitive condition.<ref name="pmid3290528">{{cite journal | author = Mulley AG, Eagle KA | title = What is inappropriate care? | journal = JAMA | volume = 260 | issue = 4 | pages = 540–1 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3290528 | doi =  }}</ref>  In certain situations, for example, the physician's point of view may differ from the decision that aligns most with the patient's values, judgments, and opinions. For this reason, [[informed consent]] is at the core of shared decision making.<ref name="pmid14706973">{{cite journal | author = Whitney SN, McGuire AL, McCullough LB | title = A typology of shared decision making, informed consent, and simple consent | journal = Ann. Intern. Med. | volume = 140 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–9 | year = 2004 | month = January | pmid = 14706973 | doi =  }}</ref> That is, without fully understanding the advantages and disadvantages of all treatment options, patients cannot engage in making decisions based on their personal values and beliefs.

== The Ecological Model ==
The ecological model of patient participation, proposed by researcher and professor Donald J. Cegala and based on previous research by Richard Street,<ref>{{cite book|last=Street|first=R. R.|title=Communication in medical encounters: An ecological perspective|year=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|pages=63–89}}</ref>  includes four main components of patient participation.<ref name="Cegala">{{cite journal | author = Cegala DJ | title = An exploration of factors promoting patient participation in primary care medical interviews | journal = Health Commun | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 427–36 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21416422 | doi = 10.1080/10410236.2011.552482  }}</ref> The first of these is termed information seeking. Assessment for this component includes the number of health-related questions the patient asks, along with the number of times the patient asks for the physician to verify information. Examples of information verifying may include asking a physician to repeat information, or summarizing what the physician said in order to ensure that the patient understood the information. The second facet of patient participation, as proposed by this model, is assertive utterances, which may include making recommendations to physicians, expressing an opinion or preference, or expressing disagreement. The third component of the model is information provision of symptoms and medical history with or without prompting from the physician. The final component of patient participation is expressions of concern, including affective responses such as anxiety, worry, or negative feelings. The extent of participation can be determined based on how often a patient displays these four overarching behaviors.

== Factors that Predict Participation ==
There are certain patient characteristics that influence the extent of involvement.<ref name="Arora">{{cite journal | author = Arora NK, McHorney CA | title = Patient preferences for medical decision making: who really wants to participate? | journal = Med Care | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–41 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10718358 | doi = }}</ref> Research shows that female patients who are younger, more educated, and who have a less severe illness than other patients are more likely to participate in medical decisions.<ref name=Arora/>  That is, an increase in age leads to a decrease in desire to participate, while higher levels of education increase participation levels. However, other research has offered conflicting evidence for the effect of age on level of participation. One study found that age did not inversely relate to participation levels.<ref name="Galesic">{{cite journal | author = Galesic M, Garcia-Retamero R | title = Do low-numeracy people avoid shared decision making? | journal = Health Psychol | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 336–41 | year = 2011 | month = May | pmid = 21553977 | doi = 10.1037/a0022723 }}</ref> In addition, [[numeracy]] levels may play an important role in patient participation. Recent research has shown that, in general, low-numeracy individuals in both Germany and the United States prefer to play a more passive role than their high-numeracy counterparts.<ref name=Galesic/> That is, individuals who are not as fluent with numbers and statistics tended to let their physicians make medical decisions without much input from the patients. In general, however, Americans play a more active role in the physician-patient relationship, by performing activities like asking follow-up questions and researching treatment options, than do Germans.<ref name=Galesic/> Furthermore, research shows that race plays an important role in whether a patient participates. Though African American patients report that they participate less in shared decision-making than whites,<ref name="Cooper">{{cite journal | author = Cooper-Patrick L, Gallo JJ, Gonzales JJ, Vu HT, Powe NR, Nelson C, Ford DE | title = Race, gender, and partnership in the patient-physician relationship | journal = JAMA | volume = 282 | issue = 6 | pages = 583–9 | year = 1999 | month = August | pmid = 10450723 | doi = 10.1001/jama.282.6.583 }}</ref> studies have shown that African American patients desire to participate just as much as their white counterparts and are more likely to report initiating conversation about their health care with their physicians.<ref name="pmid21127318">{{cite journal | author = Peek ME, Tang H, Cargill A, Chin MH | title = Are there racial differences in patients' shared decision-making preferences and behaviors among patients with diabetes? | journal = Med Decis Making | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 422–31 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21127318 | doi = 10.1177/0272989X10384739 }}</ref>

Interestingly, individuals who place a higher value on their health are more likely to play a passive role when it comes to medical decision-making than those who placed a lower value on health.<ref name=Arora/> Researchers Arora and McHorney posit that this finding may be the result of apprehension when it comes to health-related concerns among those who place a high value on health, leading to a tendency to let an expert, rather than themselves, make important medical decisions.<ref name=Arora/>

== The Role of Physicians ==
Physicians, of course, play an important role in the patient participation model. Researchers have developed specific measures to evaluate the effectiveness of a physician-patient relationship. One such measure explores the following three components of patient-centered behavior: physician's general ability to conceptualize both illness and disease in relation to a patient's life; physicians exploring the full context of illness in the patient's life setting (e.g., work, social supports, family) and personal development; physicians' ability to reach common ground with the participants in which the treatment goals and management strategies, nature of the problems and priorities, and roles of both the physician and patient are addressed.<ref name="pmid11370920">{{cite journal | author = Meredith L, Stewart M, Brown JB | title = Patient-centered communication scoring method report on nine coded interviews | journal = Health Commun | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–31 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11370920 | doi = 10.1207/S15327027HC1301_03 }}</ref>

Previous research has demonstrated that increased patient-centered behavior by physicians leads to greater compliance of patients' at-home medical care, such as taking pills.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=M. A.|title=What is a successful doctor–patient interview? A study of interactions and outcomes.|journal=Social Science & Medicine|year=1984|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–175|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(84)90284-3}}</ref> It is important to note that, generally, physicians engage in more patient-centered communication when speaking with high participation patients rather than with low participation patients.<ref name=Cegala/> However, when a patient sees a physician of the same race, the patient perceives that physician as involving the patient more so than a physician of a different race.<ref name=Cooper/>

== Consequences ==
=== Benefits ===
A recent study found that individuals who participate in shared decision-making are more likely to feel secure and may feel a stronger sense of commitment to recover.<ref name="pmid20230518">{{cite journal | author = Höglund AT, Winblad U, Arnetz B, Arnetz JE | title = Patient participation during hospitalization for myocardial infarction: perceptions among patients and personnel | journal = Scand J Caring Sci | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 482–9 | year = 2010 | month = September | pmid = 20230518 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2009.00738.x }}</ref> Also, research has shown that patient participation leads to higher judgments of the quality of care.<ref name="pmid21307118">{{cite journal | author = Weingart SN, Zhu J, Chiappetta L, Stuver SO, Schneider EC, Epstein AM, David-Kasdan JA, Annas CL, Fowler FJ, Weissman JS | title = Hospitalized patients' participation and its impact on quality of care and patient safety | journal = Int J Qual Health Care | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 269–77 | year = 2011 | month = June | pmid = 21307118 | doi = 10.1093/intqhc/mzr002 }}</ref> Furthermore, patient participation leads to greater [[self-efficacy]] in patients, which in turn, leads to better health outcomes.<ref name="pmid11972720">{{cite journal | author = Heisler M, Bouknight RR, Hayward RA, Smith DM, Kerr EA | title = The relative importance of physician communication, participatory decision making, and patient understanding in diabetes self-management | journal = J Gen Intern Med | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 243–52 | year = 2002 | month = April | pmid = 11972720 | pmc = 1495033 | doi =  }}</ref> When a patient participates more in the decision-making process, the frequency of self-management behaviors increases, as well.<ref name="pmid17610432">{{cite journal | author = Hibbard JH, Mahoney ER, Stock R, Tusler M | title = Do increases in patient activation result in improved self-management behaviors? | journal = Health Serv Res | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 1443–63 | year = 2007 | month = August | pmid = 17610432 | pmc = 1955271 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2006.00669.x }}</ref>  Self-management behaviors fall into three broad categories: health behaviors (e.g., exercise); consumeristic behaviors (e.g., reading the risks about a new treatment); and disease-specific management strategies.<ref name="pmid16336556">{{cite journal | author = Hibbard JH, Mahoney ER, Stockard J, Tusler M | title = Development and testing of a short form of the patient activation measure | journal = Health Serv Res | volume = 40 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1918–30 | year = 2005 | month = December | pmid = 16336556 | pmc = 1361231 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00438.x }}</ref>  In a similar vein, a recent study found that among patients with diabetes, the more an individual remembers information given by a physician, the more the patient participated in self-care behaviors at home.<ref name="pmid21035296">{{cite journal | author = Bundesmann R, Kaplowitz SA | title = Provider communication and patient participation in diabetes self-care | journal = Patient Educ Couns | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–7 | year = 2011 | month = November | pmid = 21035296 | doi = 10.1016/j.pec.2010.09.025 }}</ref>

Previous research has demonstrated that providing patients with personal coronary risk information may assist patients in improving cholesterol levels.<ref name="pmid18039987">{{cite journal | author = Grover SA, Lowensteyn I, Joseph L, Kaouache M, Marchand S, Coupal L, Boudreau G | title = Patient knowledge of coronary risk profile improves the effectiveness of dyslipidemia therapy: the CHECK-UP study: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Arch.

Additionally, the findings of another study indicate that the use of a cardiovascular risk calculator led to increased patient participation and satisfaction with the treatment decision process and outcome, and reduced decisional regret.<ref name="pmid18474884">{{cite journal | author = Krones T, Keller H, Sönnichsen A, Sadowski EM, Baum E, Wegscheider K, Rochon J, Donner-Banzhoff N | title = Absolute cardiovascular disease risk and shared decision making in primary care: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Ann Fam Med | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 218–27 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18474884 | pmc = 2384995 | doi = 10.1370/afm.854 }}</ref>

=== Disadvantages ===
Some patients do not find the patient participation model to be the best approach to care. A qualitative study found that barriers to patient participation may include: a patient's desire to avoid participation due to lack of perceived control over the situation, a medical professional's inability to make an emotional connection with the patient, an interaction with an overconfident and overly assertive medical professional, and general structural deficits in care that may undermine opportunities for a patient to exert control over the situation.<ref name="pmid21241347">{{cite journal | author = Larsson IE, Sahlsten MJ, Segesten K, Plos KA | title = Patients' perceptions of barriers for participation in nursing care | journal = Scand J Caring Sci | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 575–82 | year = 2011 | month = September | pmid = 21241347 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2010.00866.x }}</ref> Furthermore, dispositional factors may play an important role in the extent to which a patient feels comfortable with a participating in medical decisions. Individuals who exhibit high trait anxiety, for example, prefer not to participate in medical decision-making.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graugaard|first=Peter|coauthors=Finset, Arnstein|title=Trait anxiety and reactions to patient-centered and doctor-centered styles of communication: An experimental study|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=2000|volume=62|issue=1|pages=33–39}}</ref> 

For those who do participate in decision-making, there are potential disadvantages. As patients take part in the decision process, physicians may communicate uncertain or unknown evidence about the risks and benefits of a decision.<ref name="Politi">{{cite journal | author = Politi MC, Clark MA, Ombao H, Dizon D, Elwyn G | title = Communicating uncertainty can lead to less decision satisfaction: a necessary cost of involving patients in shared decision making? | journal = Health Expect | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–91 | year = 2011 | month = March | pmid = 20860780 | pmc = 3010418 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00626.x }}</ref> The communication of scientific uncertainty may lead to decision dissatisfaction.<ref name=Politi/> Critics of the patient participation model assert that physicians who choose not to question and challenge the assumptions of patients do a medical disservice to patients, who are overall less knowledgeable and skilled than the physician.<ref name="pmid21592264">{{cite journal | author = Cribb A, Entwistle VA | title = Shared decision making: trade-offs between narrower and broader conceptions | journal = Health Expect | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 210–9 | year = 2011 | month = June | pmid = 21592264 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-7625.2011.00694.x  }}</ref> Physicians who encourage patient participation can help the patient make a decision that is aligned with the patients' values and preferences.

== Decision Aids ==
Patient participation increasingly relies on the use of [[decision aids]] in assisting the patients in choosing the best treatment option. Patient decision aids, which may include leaflets, video or audio tapes, or interactive media, supplement the patient-physician relationship and assist patients in making medical decisions that most closely aligns with their values and preferences.<ref>{{cite journal|last=van Til|first=J.A.|coauthors=Drossaert, C.

The International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration, a group of researchers led by professors Annette O'Connor in Canada and [[Glyn Elwyn]] in England, has published a set of standards, representing the efforts of more than 100 participants from fourteen countries around the world, that will help determine the quality of patient decision aids.<ref name="pmid16908462">{{cite journal | author = Elwyn G, O'Connor A, Stacey D, Volk R, Edwards A, Coulter A, Thomson R, Barratt A, Barry M, Bernstein S, Butow P, Clarke A, Entwistle V, Feldman-Stewart D, Holmes-Rovner M, Llewellyn-Thomas H, Moumjid N, Mulley A, Ruland C, Sepucha K, Sykes A, Whelan T | title = Developing a quality criteria framework for patient decision aids: online international Delphi consensus process | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7565 | pages = 417 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 16908462 | pmc = 1553508 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38926.629329.AE  }}</ref> The report determined that there are certain components of an aid, such as providing information about options, using patient stories, and disclosing conflicts of interest, that will assist patients and health practitioners to assess the content, development process and effectiveness of decision aids.
