'''Facial nerve paralysis''' is a common problem that involves the [[paralysis]] of any structures innervated by the [[facial nerve]]. The pathway of the facial nerve is long and relatively convoluted, and so there are a number of causes that may result in facial nerve paralysis.<ref name="urlFacial Nerve">{{cite web |url=http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/nanatomy/vii.htm |title=Facial Nerve |work= |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref> The most common is [[Bell's palsy]], an [[idiopathic]] disease that may only be diagnosed by exclusion.

A thorough [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]] are the first steps in making a diagnosis.

During the '''physical examination''', a distinction must first be made between paralysis and [[paresis]] (incomplete paralysis). Not surprisingly, paralysis is far more serious and requires immediate treatment. It must also be determined whether the [[forehead]] is involved in the motor defect or not. This is usually accomplished by assessing how well a patient can raise his or her [[eyebrow]]s. The question is an important one because it helps determine if the lesion is in the [[upper motor neuron]] component of the facial nerve, or in its [[lower motor neuron]] component. If the mimetic muscles do not contract anymore, facial nerve surgery is indicated, for example [[smile surgery]].

Laboratory investigations include an [[audiogram]], [[nerve conduction study|nerve conduction studies]] ([[Electroneuronography|ENoG]]), [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).

==Causes==
===Supranuclear and nuclear lesions===
[[Central facial palsy]] can be caused by a [[lacunar infarct]] affecting fibers in the [[internal capsule]] going to the nucleus.

The [[facial nucleus]] itself can be affected by infarcts of the [[pontine arteries]].

===Infranuclear lesions===
====Bell's palsy====
[[Bell's palsy]] is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis (>80%). Previously considered [[idiopathic]], it has been recently linked to [[herpes simplex]] infection.<ref>Musani MA, Farooqui AN, Usman A, Atif S, Afaq S, Khambaty Y, Ahmed L. Association of herpes simplex virus infection and Bell's palsy. J Pak Med Assoc. 2009 Dec;59(12):823-5. PubMed PMID: 20201172.</ref> Another more severe form of facial palsy, called Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, is linked to [[herpes zoster]] infection of the facial nerve. Other, less common, etiologies are [[Lyme disease]] polio, TB.

Bell's palsy is an exclusion diagnosis. Some factors that tend to rule out Bell's palsy include:
# Recurrent paralysis
# Slowly progressive paralysis (The onset of Bell's palsy is very sudden, usually within 24 hours all the symptoms have been manifested) <ref>[http://allbellspalsy.info/ "Bell's Palsy Information Site: Newly Diagnosed with Bell's Palsy FAQs"] (Website). Bell's Palsy Information Site.</ref>
# Twitching
# Associated symptoms (either [[cochlea]]r or neurologic)
Bell's palsy is believed in the most recent studies to be due to herpes virus. Other proposed etiologies include vascular problems in the inner ear. Treatment includes [[steroids]] and antivirals.

====Trauma====
[[Physical trauma]], especially [[fracture]]s of the [[temporal bone]], may also cause acute facial nerve paralysis. Understandably, the likelihood of facial paralysis after trauma depends on the location of the trauma. Most commonly, facial paralysis follows temporal bone fractures, though the likelihood depends on the type of fracture.

''Transverse fractures'' in the horizontal plane present the highest likelihood of facial paralysis (40-50%). Patients may also present with [[hemotympanum]] (blood behind the tympanic membrane), sensory [[deaf]]ness, and [[Dizziness|vertigo]] &ndash; the latter two symptoms due to damage to [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] ([[cranial nerve]] VIII) and the inner ear. ''Longitudinal fracture'' in the vertical plane present a lower likelihood of paralysis (20%). Patients may present with [[hematorrhea]] ([[blood]] coming out of the [[external auditory meatus]]), [[tympanic membrane]] tear, fracture of [[external auditory canal]], and [[conductive hearing loss]].

Traumatic injuries can be assessed by [[computed tomography]] (CT) and nerve conduction studies (ENoG). In patients with mild injury, management is the same as with Bell's palsy &ndash; protect the [[human eye|eye]]s and wait. In patients with severe injury, progress is followed with nerve conduction studies. If nerve conduction studies show a large (>90%) change in nerve conduction, the nerve should be decompressed. The facial paralysis can follow immediately the trauma due to direct damage to the facial nerve, in such cases a surgical treatment may be attempted. In other cases the facial paralysis can occur a long time after the trauma due to oedema and inflammation. In those cases steroids can be a good help.

====''Herpes zoster oticus''====
{{main|Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II}}

[[Herpes zoster oticus]] is essentially a [[herpes zoster]] [[infection]] that affects [[cranial nerve]]s VII ([[facial nerve]]) and VIII ([[vestibulocochlear nerve]]).
Patients present with facial paralysis, ear pain, [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s, [[sensorineural hearing loss]], and [[dizziness|vertigo]].
Management includes [[Antiviral drug]]s and oral [[steroid]]s.

====Acute and chronic ''otitis media''====
''[[Otitis media]]'' is an infection in the middle ear, which can spread to the facial nerve and inflame it, causing compression of the nerve in its canal.
[[Antibiotic]]s are used to control the ''otitis media'', and other options include a wide [[myringotomy]] (an incision in the [[tympanic membrane]]) or decompression if the patient does not improve.

Chronic ''otitis media'' usually presents in an ear with chronic discharge ([[otorrhea]]), or hearing loss, with or without ear pain ([[otalgia]]). Once suspected, there should be immediate surgical exploration to determine if a [[cholesteatoma]] has formed as this must be removed if present.  Inflammation from the middle ear can spread to the canalis facialis of the temporal bone - through this canal travels the facial nerve together with the steatoacoustisus nerve. In the case of inflammation the nerve is exposed to edema and subsequent high pressure, resulting in a periferic type palsy.

====Neurosarcoidosis====
Facial nerve paralysis, sometimes bilateral, is a common manifestation of [[neurosarcoidosis]] ([[sarcoidosis]] of the nervous system), itself a rare condition.

====Moebius syndrome====
[[Moebius syndrome]] is a bilateral facial paralysis resulting from the underdevelopment of the VII cranial nerve (facial nerve), which is present at birth. The VI cranial nerve, which controls lateral eye movement, is also affected, so people with Moebius syndrome cannot form facial expression or move their eyes from side to side. Moebius syndrome is extremely rare, and its cause or causes are not known.

===Multiple===
====Tumors====
A [[tumor]] compressing the facial nerve anywhere along its complex pathway can result in facial paralysis. Common culprits are [[facial neuroma]]s, congenital [[cholesteatoma]]s, [[hemangioma]]s, [[acoustic neuroma]]s, [[parotid gland]] [[neoplasm]]s, or [[metastases]] of other tumours.

Patients with facial nerve paralysis resulting from tumours usually present with a progressive, twitching paralysis, other neurological signs, or a recurrent Bell's palsy-type presentation.
The latter should always be suspicious, as Bell's palsy should not recur. A chronically discharging ear must be treated as a cholesteatoma until proven otherwise; hence, there must be immediate [[surgery|surgical]] exploration.

Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging should be used to identify the location of the tumour, and it should be managed accordingly.

Often, since facial neoplasms have such an intimate relationship with the facial nerve, removing tumors in this region becomes perplexing as the physician is unsure how to manage the tumor without causing even more palsy. Typically, benign tumors should be removed in a fashion that preserves the facial nerve, while malignant tumors should always be resected along with large areas of tissue around them, including the facial nerve.  While this will inevitably lead to heightened paralysis, safe removal of a malignant neoplasm is worth the often treatable palsy that follows.  In the best case scenario, paralysis can be corrected with techniques including hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, end-to-end nerve repair, cross facial nerve grafting, or muscle transfer/transposition techniques, such as the gracilis free muscle transfer.
