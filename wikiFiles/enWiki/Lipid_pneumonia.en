'''Lipid pneumonia''' or '''lipoid pneumonia''' is a specific form of lung inflammation ([[pneumonia]]) that develops when [[lipids]] enter the bronchial tree. The disorder is sometimes called '''[[Cholesterol]] pneumonia''' in cases where that lipid is a factor.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Pelz L, Hobusch D, Erfurth F, Richter K | title=[Familial cholesterol pneumonia] | journal=Helv Paediatr Acta | year=1972 | pages=371–9 | volume=27 | issue=4  | pmid=4644274}}</ref>

==History==
Laughlen first described lipid pneumonia in 1925 with infants that inhaled oil droplets.<ref name="pmid3686744">{{cite journal |author=Kizer KW, Golden JA |title=Lipoid pneumonitis in a commercial abalone diver |journal=Undersea Biomedical Research |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=545–52 |year=1987 |month=November |pmid=3686744 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2451 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}</ref> It is a condition that has been seen as an occupational risk for [[commercial diving]] operations but documented cases are rare.<ref name="pmid3686744"/>

==Causes==
Sources of such lipids could be either exogenous or endogenous.<ref name="urlPulmonary Pathology">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/LUNGHTML/LUNG026.html |title=Pulmonary Pathology |work= |accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref>

'''Exogenous''': from outside the body. For example, inhaled nose drops with an oil base, or accidental inhalation of cosmetic oil. [[Amiodarone]] is an anti-arrythmic known to cause this condition. 

'''Endogenous''': from the body itself, for example, when an airway is obstructed, it is often the case that distal to the obstruction, lipid-laden [[macrophages]] ([[Foam_cell|foamy macrophages]]) and [[giant cells]] fill the lumen of the disconnected airspace.

==Appearance==
The gross appearance of a [http://www-medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/LUNGHTML/LUNG026.html lipid pneumonia] is that in which there is an ill-defined, pale yellow area on the lung. This yellow appearance explains the colloquial term "golden" pneumonia. 

At the microscopic scale foamy macrophages and giant cells are seen in the airways, and the inflammatory response is visible in the parenchyma.

==Treatment==
Treatment is with [[corticosteroids]] and possibly intravenous [[immunoglobulins]].
