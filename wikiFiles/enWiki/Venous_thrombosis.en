A '''venous thrombosis''' or [[phlebothrombosis]] is  a [[blood clot]] (thrombus) that forms within a [[vein]]. ''[[Thrombosis]]'' is a term for a blood clot occurring inside a blood vessel. A classical venous thrombosis is [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT), which can break off ([[Embolism|embolize]]), and become a life-threatening [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE). The disease process '''venous thromboembolism''' (abbreviated as '''VTE''' or '''DVT/PE''') can refer to DVT and/or PE. An inflamatory reaction is usually present, mainly in the superficial veins and, for this reason this pathology is called most of the time [[thrombophlebitis]]. In fact, the inflamatory reaction and the white blood cells play a role in the resolution of venous clots.<ref name="Saha">{{cite journal| author=Saha P, Humphries J, Modarai B, et al.| title=Leukocytes and the natural history of deep vein thrombosis: Current concepts and future directions | journal=Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol | year= 2011 | volume= 31 | issue= 3 | pages= 506–12 | pmid=21325673 | doi=10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.213405 | pmc=3079895 }}</ref>

==Classification==
''[[Superficial venous thromboses]]'' causes discomfort but generally do not cause serious consequences, as the ''[[deep venous thrombosis|deep venous thromboses]]'' (DVTs) that form in the deep veins of the legs or in the pelvic veins. Nevertheless they can progress to the deep veins through the [[perforator vein]]s  or, they can be responsible for a lung embolism mainly if the head of the clot is poorly attached to the vein wall and is situated near the [[great saphenous vein|sapheno-femoral junction]]. 

Since the veins return [[blood]] to the [[heart]], if a piece of a blood clot formed in a vein breaks off it can be transported to the right side of the heart, and from there into the [[lung]]s. A piece of thrombus that is transported in this way is an ''[[embolus]]'': the process of forming a thrombus that becomes embolic is called a ''thromboembolism''. An embolism that lodges in the lungs is a ''[[pulmonary embolism]]'' (PE). A pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition that can be fatal dependeing of the embolus dimensions. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) refers to both DVTs and PEs.

Systemic embolisms of venous origin can occur in patients with an [[Atrial septal defect|atrial]] or [[ventricular septal defect]], through which an embolus may pass into the arterial system. Such an event is termed a [[paradoxical embolism]].

==Causes==
Venous thrombi are caused mainly by a combination of [[venous stasis]] and [[hypercoagulability]]—but to a lesser extent endothelial damage and [[Endothelial activation|activation]].<ref name="Basic patho"/> The three factors of stasis, hypercoaguability, and alterations in the blood vessel wall represent [[Virchow's triad]], and changes to the vessel wall are the least understood.<ref name="Whatis"/> Various risk factors increase the likelhood of any one individual developing a thrombosis.

==Pathophysiology==

In contrast to the understanding for how arterial thromboses occur, as with [[Myocardial_infarction#Pathophysiology|heart attacks]], venous thrombosis formation is not well understood.<ref name="Lopez">{{cite journal| author=López JA, Chen J| title=Pathophysiology of venous thrombosis | journal=Thromb Res | year= 2009 | volume= 123 | issue= Suppl 4 | pages= S30–4 | pmid=19303501 | doi=10.1016/S0049-3848(09)70140-9 }}</ref> With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required for thrombosis formation, as it initiates [[coagulation]],<ref name="Lopez"/> but the majority of venous thrombi form without any injured epithelium.<ref name="Basic patho"/> 

[[Red blood cell]]s and [[fibrin]] are the main components of venous thrombi,<ref name="Basic patho"/> and the thrombi appear to attach to the blood vessel wall [[endothelium]], normally a non-thrombogenic surface, with fibrin.<ref name="Lopez"/> [[Platelet]]s in venous thrombi attach to downstream fibrin, while in arterial thrombi, they compose the core.<ref name="Lopez"/> As a whole, platelets constitute less of venous thrombi when compared to arterial ones.<ref name="Basic patho"/> The beginning of the process is thought to be initiated by [[tissue factor]] effected thrombin production, which leads to fibrin deposition.<ref name="Whatis"/>

The valves of veins are a recognized site of VT initiation. Due to the blood flow pattern, the base of the valve sinus is particularly deprived of oxygen ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]]). Stasis excacerbates hypoxia, and this state is linked to the activation of white blood cells ([[leukocytes]]) and the endothelium. Specifically, the two pathways of [[hypoxia-inducible factor-1]] (HIF-1) and [[early growth response 1]] (EGR-1) are activated by hypoxia, and they contribute to [[monocyte]] and endothelial activation. Hypoxia also causes [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production that can activate HIF-1, EGR-1, and [[nuclear factor-κB]] (NF-κB), which regulates HIF-1 transcription.<ref name="Whatis"/>

HIF-1 and EGR-1 pathways lead to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as [[P-selectin]], prompting monocytes to release tissue factor filled [[microvesicles]], which presumably initiate fibrin deposition (via thrombin) after binding the endothelial surface.<ref name="Whatis"/>

==Prevention==

Evidence supports the use of [[heparin]] in surgical patients who have a high risk of thrombosis to reduce the risk of DVTs; however, the effect on PEs or overall mortality is not known.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Oates-Whitehead|first=RM|coauthors=D'Angelo, A, Mol, B|title=Anticoagulant and aspirin prophylaxis for preventing thromboembolism after major gynaecological surgery|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|year=2003|issue=4|pages=CD003679|pmid=14583989|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003679}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Handoll|first=HH|coauthors=Farrar, MJ, McBirnie, J, Tytherleigh-Strong, G, Milne, AA, Gillespie, WJ|title=Heparin, low molecular weight heparin and physical methods for preventing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following surgery for hip fractures|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|year=2002|issue=4|pages=CD000305|pmid=12519540|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000305|editor1-last=Handoll|editor1-first=Helen HG}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Roderick|first=P|coauthors=Ferris, G, Wilson, K, Halls, H, Jackson, D, Collins, R, Baigent, C|title=Towards evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism: systematic reviews of mechanical methods, oral anticoagulation, dextran and regional anaesthesia as thromboprophylaxis|journal=Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)|date=2005 Dec|volume=9|issue=49|pages=iii–iv, ix–x, 1–78|pmid=16336844}}</ref> In hospitalized non-surgical patients, heparin results in an almost [[statistically significant]] decrease in mortality and may decrease the risk of PE and DVT, but it increases major bleeding events yielding little or no overall clinical benefit.<ref name=Review11>{{cite journal|last=Lederle|first=FA|coauthors=Zylla, D, Macdonald, R, Wilt, TJ|title=Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients and those with stroke: a background review for an american college of physicians clinical practice guideline|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2011-11-01|volume=155|issue=9|pages=602–15|pmid=22041949|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-155-9-201111010-00008|url=http://www.annals.org/content/155/9/602.long}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Alikhan|first=R|coauthors=Cohen, AT|title=Heparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in general medical patients (excluding stroke and myocardial infarction)|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2009-07-08|issue=3|pages=CD003747|pmid=19588346|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003747.pub2|editor1-last=Alikhan|editor1-first=Raza}}</ref> It does not appear however to decrease the rate of symptomatic DVTs.<ref name=Review11/> In hospitalized non-surgical [[stroke]] patients, mechanical measures ([[compression stockings]]) resulted in skin damage and no clinical improvement.<ref name=Review11/> Data on the effectiveness of compression stockings among hospitalized non-surgical patients without stroke is scarce.<ref name=Review11/>

A 2011 [[Medical guideline|clinical guideline]] from the [[American College of Physicians]] (ACP) gave three strong recommendations with moderate quality evidence on VTE prevention in non-surgical patients: that hospitalized patients be assessed for their risk of thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis (prevention); that heparin or a related drug is used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used.<ref name="ACP CPG">{{cite journal| author=Qaseem A, Chou R, Humphrey LL, Starkey M, Shekelle P, Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians| title=Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians | journal=Ann Intern Med | year= 2011 | volume= 155 | issue= 9 | pages= 625–32 | pmid=22041951 | doi=10.1059/0003-4819-155-9-201111010-00011 | url=http://www.annals.org/content/155/9/625.long }}</ref> As an ACP policy implication, the guideline stated a lack of support for any performance measures that incentivize physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.<ref name="ACP CPG"/>

Despite development of various practice guidelines for prevention of VTE, they remain underused in most countries.{{mcn|date=September 2012}}
