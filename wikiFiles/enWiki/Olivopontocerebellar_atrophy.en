'''Olivopontocerebellar atrophy''' ('''OPCA''') is the degeneration of neurons in specific areas of the brain – the cerebellum, pons, and inferior olives.<ref name=nidsopca>{{cite web |title=NINDS Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy Information Page |accessdate = 7 Feb 2012|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/opca/opca.htm}}</ref> OPCA is present in several neurodegenerative syndromes, including inherited and non-inherited forms of ataxia (such as the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia known as [[Machado–Joseph disease]]) and [[Multiple system atrophy|multiple system atrophy (MSA)]], with which it is primarily associated.<ref name=nidsopca/>

OPCA  may also be found in the brains of individuals with prion disorders and inherited metabolic diseases.  The characteristic areas of brain damage that indicate OPCA can be seen by imaging the brain using CT scans or MRI studies.<ref name=nidsopca/>

The term was originally coined by [[Joseph Jules Dejerine]] and [[André Thomas]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1903}} - "Dejerine-Thomas atrophy"</ref><ref>J. J. Dejerine, A. Thomas. L’atrophie olivo-ponto-cérébelleuse. Nouvelle iconographie de la Salpêtrière, Paris, 1900, 13: 330-370. 1912, 25: 223-250.</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
OPCA is characterized by progressive [[cerebellar ataxia]], leading to clumsiness in body movements, veering from midline when walking, wide-based stance, and falls without signs of [[paralysis]] or weakness.<ref name=Landers>{{cite journal|last=Landers|first=M|coauthors=Adams M, Acosta K, Fox A.|title=Challenge-oriented gait and balance training in sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy: a case study.|journal=J Neurol Phys Ther|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=160–168}}</ref><ref name=Berciano>{{cite journal|last=Berciano|first=J|coauthors=Boesch S, Pérez-Ramos JM, Wenning GK|title=Olivopontocerebellar atrophy: toward a better nosological definition.|journal=Mov Disord.|year=2006|volume=21|issue=10|pages=1607–13}}</ref> Clinical presentation can vary greatly between patients, but mostly affects speech, balance and walking.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001765/</ref>  Other possible neurological problems include [[spasmodic dysphonia]], [[hypertonia]], [[hyperreflexia]], rigidity, [[dysarthria]], [[dysphagia]] and neck [[dystonic]] posture.<ref name=Berciano/>

==Cause==
Olivopontocerebellar atrophy is hereditary, but has an unknown genetic basis.  There are two forms:

A few non-hereditary diseases formerly categorized as olivopontocerebellar atrophy have been reclassified as forms of [[multiple system atrophy]]<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=mesh&cmd=search&term=multiple+system+atrophy MeSH Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as well as to four hereditary types, that have been currently reclassified as four different forms of [[spinocerebellar ataxia]]:

|}

==Physiotherapy intervention==
[[Physiotherapy]] intervention aims to improve balance and [[gait]] of OPCA patients, by stimulating [[neuroplastic]] changes in the [[atrophied]] neural structure. A challenge-oriented treatment program has previously been shown to be beneficial for individuals with [[ataxia]] from OPCA. The treatment program was composed of repetitive training with task challenges (e.g. obstacle course) and/or novel motor skills acquisition over a 12-week period under the supervision of a [[physiotherapist]]. Task challenges were progressed only when the patient showed mastery of a task.<ref name=Landers/> 

Overground harness systems may be used to allow OPCA patients to challenge their balance without chance of falling. Furthermore, home exercise programs and/or aquatic exercises are used to allow more repetitions to facilitate balance learning. Treatment programs should be frequently monitored and adjusted based on a patient's progress. Outcome measures such as the [[Berg Balance Scale]], Dynamic Gait Index and activities-specific balance confidence scales are useful to assess patient’s progress over time.<ref name=Landers/>
