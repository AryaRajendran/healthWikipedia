==Structure and anatomy==
===Location===
C fibers are found in the [[nerves]] of the [[somatosensory system|somatic sensory system]].<ref name="Purves">{{cite book | last =Purves | first =Dale | coauthors =et.al| title =Neuroscience| publisher =Sinauer Associates, Inc. | year =2004 | location =Massachusetts | isbn =0-87893-725-0 }}</ref> They are [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent fibers]], conveying input signals from the [[peripheral nervous system|periphery]] to the central nervous system.<ref name= Craig2002>{{cite journal |last1= Craig |first1= AD|last2= |first2= |last3= |first3= |title= How do you feel? Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the body|journal= Nature Reviews Neuroscience|year= 2002|month= Aug|volume= 3|issue= 8|pages= 655–66|pmid= 12154366|doi= 10.1038/nrn894|url= }}</ref>

===Structure===
C fibers are [[myelin|unmyelinated]] unlike most other [[nerve fibers|fibers]] in the nervous system.<ref name="Purves" /> This lack of myelination is the cause of their slow [[nerve conduction study|conduction velocity]], which is on the order of no more than 2 {{val/unitswithlink|m/s}}.<ref name="Purves" /> C fibers are on average 0.2-1.5 [[Micrometre|μm]] in diameter.<ref name="Purves" />

===Remak bundles===
C fiber axons are grouped together into what is known as [[Remak bundles]].<ref name="Murinson">{{cite journal | last=Murinson |first=BB|coauthors=JW Griffin |year= 2004 | title= C-fiber structure varies with location in peripheral nerve | journal= Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology  | volume= 63 |pages=246–254 | pmid=15055448 | issue=3 }}</ref> These occur when an unmyelinated [[Schwann cell]] bundles the axons close together by surrounding them.<ref name="Fagan">{{cite journal | last=Fagan |first=Tom |year= 2003 | title= Glial Cells Critical for Peripheral Nervous System Health | journal= News from Harvard Medical, Dental and Public Health Schools}}</ref> The Schwann cell keeps them from touching each other by squeezing its [[cytoplasm]] between the axons.<ref name="Fagan" /> The condition of Remak bundles varies with age.<ref name="Fagan" /> The number of C fiber axons in each Remak bundle varies with location.<ref name="Murinson" /> For example in a rat model, large bundles of greater than 20 axons are found exiting the L5 [[dorsal root ganglion]], while smaller bundles of average 3 axons are found in distal nerve segments.<ref name="Murinson" /> Multiple neurons contribute axons to the Remak bundle with an average ratio of about 2 axons contributed per bundle.<ref name="Murinson" /> The cross sectional area of a Remak bundle is proportional to the number of axons found inside it.<ref name="Murinson" /> Remak bundles in the distal peripheral nerve are clustered with other Remak bundles.<ref name="Murinson" /> The Remak Schwann cells have been shown to be electrochemically responsive to [[action potential]]s of the axons contained within them.<ref name="Murinson" /> 

In experiments where nerve injury is caused but nearby C fibers remain intact, increased spontaneous activity in the C fibers is observed.<ref name="Murinson" /> This phenomenon supports the theory that damaged nerve fibers may release factors that alter the function of neighboring undamaged fibers.<ref name="Murinson" /> Study of Remak bundles has important implications in nerve regeneration after sustaining injury.<ref name="Murinson" /> Currently, recovery of distal C fiber function takes months and may still only regain incomplete function.<ref name="Murinson" /> This may result in abnormal sensory function or [[neuropathy|neuropathic pain]].<ref name="Murinson" /> Remak bundles are thought to release certain trophic factors that promote the regeneration of the damaged axons.<ref name="Murinson" />

==Pathway==
C fibers synapse to second-order projection neurons in the spinal cord at the upper laminae of the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] in the [[Substantia gelatinosa of Rolando|substantia gelatinosa]].<ref name="Baron1">{{cite journal | last=Baron |first=Ralph |year= 2006 | title= Mechanisms of Disease: neuropathic pain—a clinical perspective | journal= Nature Clinical Practice Neurology| volume= 2 }}</ref> The second-order projection neurons are of the wide dynamic range (WDR) type, which receive input from both nociceptive terminals as well as myelinated A-type fibers.<ref name="Baron1" /> There are three types of second order projection neurons in the [[spinothalamic tract]]: wide dynamic range (WDR), high threshold (HT), and low threshold (LT).<ref name="Chung">{{cite journal | last=Chung |first=J.M. |coauthors= et. al |year= 1979 | title= Excitation of primate spinothalamic neurons by cutaneous C-fiber volleys| journal= Journal of Neurophysiology | volume= 42| pages= 1354–1369 }}</ref> These classifications are based on their responses to mechanical stimuli.<ref name="Chung" />  The second-order neurons ascend to the [[brain stem]] and [[thalamus]] in the [[anatomical terms of location|ventrolateral]], or [[anatomical terms of location|anterolateral]], quadrant of the [[anatomical terms of location|contralateral]] half of the [[spinal cord]], forming the spinothalamic tract.<ref name="Purves" /> The spinothalamic tract is the main pathway associated with pain and temperature perception, which immediately crosses the spinal cord laterally.<ref name="Purves" /> This crossover feature is clinically important because it allows for identification of the location of injury.

==Function==
Because of their higher conduction velocity, Aδ fibers are responsible for the sensation of a quick  shallow pain that is specific on one area, termed as first [[pain]].<ref name="Purves" /> They respond to a weaker intensity of stimulus.<ref name="Purves" /> C fibers respond to stimuli which have stronger intensities and are the ones to account for the slow, but deeper and spread out over an unspecific area, second pain.<ref name="Purves" />  

C fibers are considered polymodal because they can react to various stimuli. They react to stimuli that are thermal, or mechanical, or chemical in nature..<ref name="Purves" /> C fibers respond to all kinds of physiological changes in the body.<ref name="Craig">{{cite journal | last=Craig |first=AD|year= 2003 | title= Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the body | journal= Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume= 13 |pages=500–505 | doi= 10.1016/S0959-4388(03)00090-4 | pmid=12965300 | issue=4 }}</ref> For example, they can respond to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[hypoglycemia]], hypo-osmolarity, the presence of muscle metabolic products, and even light or sensitive touch.<ref name="Craig" /> C fiber receptors include: 
*C fiber nociceptors
**responsible for the second, burning pain
*C fiber warming specific receptors
**responsible for warmth
*ultra-slow histamine-selective C fibers
**responsible for itch
*tactile C fibers
**sensual touch
*C mechano- and metabo- receptors in muscles or joints
**responsible for muscle exercise, burn and cramp<ref name="Craig" />

This variation of input signals calls for a variety of cells of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] in lamina 1 to have different modality-selectiveness and morphologies.<ref name="Craig" /> These varying neurons are responsible for the different feelings we perceive in our body and can be classified by their responses to ranges of stimuli.<ref name="Craig" /> The brain uses the integration of these signals to maintain [[homeostasis]] in the body whether it is temperature related or pain related.<ref name="Craig" />

===Vanilloid receptor===
The [[vanilloid receptor]] (VR-1, TRPV1) is a [[sensory receptor|receptor]] that is found on the free nerve endings of both C and Aδ fibers that responds to elevated levels of heat (>43°C) and the chemical [[capsaicin]].<ref name="Purves" /> Capsaicin activates C fibers by opening a [[ligand]]-gated [[ion channel]] and causing an action potential to occur.<ref name="Purves" /> Because this receptor responds to both capsaicin and heat, chili peppers are sensed as hot.<ref name="Purves" /> VR-1 is also able to respond to [[extracellular]] acidification and can integrate simultaneous exposure to all three sensory stimuli.<ref name="Davis">{{cite journal | last=Davis |first=JB|coauthors=et. al |year= 2000 | title= Vanilloid receptor-1 is essential for inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia | journal= Nature  | volume=405 |pages=183–7 | doi= 10.1038/35012076 | pmid=10821274 | issue=6783 }}</ref> VR1 is essential for the inflammatory sensitization to noxious thermal stimuli.<ref name="Davis" /> A second type of receptor, a [[TRPV2|vanilloid-like receptor]] (TRPV2,VRL-1), has a higher threshold of activation regarding heat of about 52°C and also responds to capsaicin and low pH.<ref name="Purves" /> Both types of receptors are [[transmembrane receptor]]s that are closed during resting conditions.<ref name="Purves" /> When open, these receptors allow for an influx of [[sodium]] and [[calcium]] which initiates an action potential across the fibers.<ref name="Purves" /> Both receptors are part of a larger family of receptors called [[transient receptor potential]] (TRP) receptors.<ref name="Purves" /> If damage to these heat transducer receptors occurs, the result can be chronic neuropathic pain caused by lowering the heat pain threshold for their [[phosphorylation]].<ref name="Scholz">{{cite journal | last=Scholz |first=Joachim|coauthors=Clifford Woolf |year= 2002 | title= Can we conquer pain? | journal= Nature Neuroscience | volume=5 |pages=1062–1067 | doi= 10.1038/nn942 | pmid=12403987 }}</ref>

==Role in neuropathic pain==
Activation of nociceptors is not necessary to cause the sensation of pain.<ref name="Scholz" /> Damage or injury to nerve fibers that normally respond to innocuous stimuli like light touch may lower their activation threshold needed to respond; this change causes the organism to feel intense pain from the lightest of touch.<ref name="Scholz" />  Neuropathic pain syndromes are caused by lesions or diseases of the parts of the nervous system that normally signal pain.<ref name="Baron2">{{cite journal | last=Baron |first=Ralph |year= 2000 | title= Peripheral neuropathic pain: from mechanisms to symptoms | journal= Clinical Journal of Pain | volume= 16 |pages=S12–20 | doi= 10.1097/00002508-200003000-00003 | pmid=10870735 | issue=2 Suppl | last2=Ogawa | first2=Setsuro | last3=Katz | first3=Joel | last4=Nagai | first4=Hitoshi | last5=Kashiwazaki | first5=Miho | last6=Saeki | first6=Shigeru | last7=Suzuki | first7=Hajime }}</ref> There are four main classes: 
*peripheral focal and multifocal nerve lesions
**traumatic, [[ischemia|ischemic]] or [[inflammation|inflammatory]]
*peripheral generalized [[polyneuropathy|polyneuropathies]]
**toxic, [[metabolism|metabolic]], [[heredity|hereditary]] or inflammatory
*[[central nervous system|CNS]] lesions
**[[stroke]], [[multiple sclerosis]], spinal cord injury
*complex neuropathic disorders
**[[complex regional pain syndrome]]s [CRPSs]<ref name="Baron1" />

After a nerve lesion of either C fibers or Aδ fibers, they become abnormally sensitive and cause [[pathology|pathological]] spontaneous activity.<ref name="Baron1" /> This alteration of normal activity is explained by molecular and cellular changes of the primary [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] nociceptors in response to the nerve damage.<ref name="Baron1" /> The abnormal activity of the damaged nerves is associated with the increased presence of [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] for voltage-gated [[sodium channel]]s.<ref name="Lai">{{cite journal | last=Lai |first=J |year= 2003 | title= The role of voltage-gated sodium channels in neuropathic pain | journal= Current Opinion Neurobiology | volume= 13 |pages=291–297 | doi= 10.1016/S0959-4388(03)00074-6 | last2=Hunter | first2=John C | last3=Porreca | first3=Frank | issue=3 }}</ref> Irregular grouping of these channels in sites of the abnormal activity may be responsible for lowering the activation threshold, thus leading to [[hyperactivity]].<ref name="Lai" />

===Central sensitization===
After nerve damage or repeated stimulation, WDR (wide dynamic range) neurons experience a general increase in excitability.<ref name="Baron1" /> This hyper-excitability can be caused by an increased neuronal response to a noxious stimulus ([[hyperalgesia]]), a larger neuronal [[receptive field]], or spread of the hyper-excitability to other segments.<ref name="Baron1" /> This condition is maintained by C fibers.<ref name="Baron1" /> C fibers cause central sensitization of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord in response to their hyperactivity.<ref name="Baron1" /> The mechanism underlying this phenomenon involves the release of [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] by these pathologically sensitized C fibers.<ref name="Baron1" /> The glutamate interacts with the [[chemical synapse|postsynaptic]] [[NMDA receptor]]s, which aids the sensitization of the dorsal horn.<ref name="Baron1" /> [[chemical synapse|Presynaptic]] neuronal voltage-gated N-calcium channels are largely responsible for the release of this glutamate as well as the [[neuropeptide]], [[substance P]].<ref name="Baron1" /> The expression of [[chemical synapse|presynaptic]] neuronal voltage-gated N-calcium channels increases after a nerve lesion or repeated stimulation.<ref name="Baron1" /> [[NMDA receptor]] activation (by glutamate) enhances postsynaptic [[Nitric Oxide Synthase]]. Nitric Oxide is thought to migrate back to the presynaptic membrane to enhance the expression of the voltage-gated N-calcium channels resulting in a [[pain wind-up]] phenomenon.  This abnormal central sensitization cycle results in increased pain (hyperalgesia) and pain responses from previously non-noxious stimuli evoke a pain response ([[allodynia]]).<ref name="Baron1" />  

Central sensitization of the dorsal horn neurons that is evoked from C fiber activity is responsible for [[Time|temporal]] summation of “second pain” (TSSP).<ref name="Staud">{{cite journal | last=Staud |first=Roland |coauthors= et. al |year= 2007 | title= Brain activity related to temporal summation of C-fiber evoked pain | journal= Pain | volume= 129 |edition=1-2|pages=130–142 | doi= 10.1016/j.pain.2006.10.010 | pmid=17156923 | issue=1–2 | pmc=1997296 }}</ref> This event is called ‘windup’ and relies on a [[frequency]] greater or equal to 0.33[[Hertz|Hz]] of the stimulus.<ref name="Staud" /> Windup is associated with [[chronic pain]] and central sensitization.<ref name="Staud" /> This minimum frequency was determined experimentally by comparing healthy patient [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI’s]] when subjected to varying frequencies of heat pulses.<ref name="Staud" /> The fMRI maps show common areas activated by the TSSP responses which include contralateral thalamus (THAL), S1, bilateral S2, anterior and posterior insula (INS), mid-anterior [[cingulate cortex]] (ACC), and supplemental motor areas (SMA).<ref name="Staud" /> TSSP events are also associated with other regions of the brain that process functions such as somatosensory processing, pain perception and modulation, [[cognition]], pre-motor activity in the cortex.<ref name="Staud" />

===Treatment===
Currently, the availability of drugs proven to treat neuropathic pain is limited and varies widely from patient to patient.<ref name="Scholz" /> Many developed drugs have either been discovered by accident or by observation.<ref name="Scholz" /> Some past treatments include [[opiate]]s like [[poppy]] extract, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like [[salicylic acid]], and local anesthetics like [[cocaine]].<ref name="Scholz" /> Other recent treatments consist of [[antidepressant]]s and [[anticonvulsant]]s, although no substantial research on the actual mechanism of these treatments has been performed.<ref name="Scholz" /> However, patients respond differently to these treatments possibly because of gender differences or [[genetics|genetic]] backgrounds.<ref name="Scholz" /> Therefore, researchers have come to realize that no one drug or one class of drugs will reduce all pain.<ref name="Scholz" /> Research is now focusing on the underlying mechanisms involved in pain perception and how it can go wrong in order to develop an appropriate drug for patients afflicted with neuropathic pain.<ref name="Scholz" />

==Microneurography==
[[Microneurography]] is a technique using metal [[electrode]]s to observe neural traffic of both myelinated and unmyelinated axons in [[efferent nerve|efferent]] and afferent neurons of the skin and muscle.<ref name="Mano">{{cite journal | last=Mano |first=Tadaaki |coauthors= et. al |year= 2006 | title= Microneurography as a tool in clinical neurophysiology to investigate peripheral neural traffic in humans | journal= Clinical Neurophysiology | volume= 117 |pages=2357–2384 | doi= 10.1016/j.clinph.2006.06.002 | pmid=16904937 | issue=11 }}</ref> This technique is particularly important in research involving C fibers.<ref name="Mano" /> Single action potentials from unmyelinated axons can be observed.<ref name="Mano" /> Recordings from efferent [[postganglionic fibers|postganglionic]] sympathetic C fibers of the muscles and skin yield important insights into the neural control [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] effector organs like [[blood vessel]]s and [[sweat gland]]s.<ref name="Mano" /> Readings of afferent discharges from C nociceptors identified by marking method have also proved as important tools to revealing the mechanisms underlying sensations such as [[itch]].<ref name="Mano" />  

Unfortunately, interpretation of the microneurographic readings can be difficult because axonal membrane potential can not be determined from this method.<ref name="Moalem-Taylor">{{cite journal | last=Moalem-Taylor |first=Gila |coauthors= et. al |year= 2007 | title= Post-spike excitability indicates changes in membrane potential of isolated c-fibers| journal= Muscle and Nerve | volume= 36 |pages=172–182 | pmid=17487863 | issue=2 | doi=10.1002/mus.20793 }}</ref> A supplemental method used to better understand these readings involves examining recordings of [[action potential|post-spike]] excitability and shifts in latency; these features are associated with changes in membrane potential of unmyelinated axons like C fibers.<ref name="Moalem-Taylor" /> Moalem-Taylor et al. experimentally used chemical modulators with known effects on membrane potential to study the post-spike super-excitability of C fibers.<ref name="Moalem-Taylor" /> The researchers found three resulting events.<ref name="Moalem-Taylor" /> Chemical medulators can produce a combination of loss of super-excitability along with increased axonal excitability, indicating membrane [[depolarization]].<ref name="Moalem-Taylor" /> Secondly, membrane [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] can result from a blockade of axonal hyperpolarization-activated current.<ref name="Moalem-Taylor" /> Lastly, a non-specific increase in surface charge and a change in the voltage-dependent activation of sodium channels results from the application of calcium.<ref name="Moalem-Taylor" />
