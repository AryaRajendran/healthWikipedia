'''Clitoromegaly''' (or macroclitoris<ref>{{cite web|title=''Dorland Medical Dictionary'' |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_m_01zPzhtm#12508261}}</ref>) is an abnormal enlargement of the [[clitoris]] (not to be confused with the normal enlargement of the clitoris seen during [[sexual arousal]]).

Although clitoromegaly denotes just a clitoris larger than expected (thus involving some uncertainty about what can be defined as ''normal''), it is commonly seen as a [[congenital anomaly of the genitalia]].

In ''Atlas of Human Sex Anatomy (1949)''<ref>{{cite book |title=Atlas of Human Sex Anatomy |isbn=0-88275-014-3 |publisher=Williams & Wilkins Co |year=1949 |last=Dickinson |first=Robert Latou}}</ref> by [[Robert Latou Dickinson|Dr. Robert Latou Dickinson]], the ''typical'' clitoris is defined as having a crosswise width of 3 to 4&nbsp;mm. (0.12 - 0.16&nbsp;inches) and a lengthwise width of 4 to 5&nbsp;mm (0.16 - 0.20&nbsp;inches). On the other hand, in Obstetrics and Gynecology medical literature, a frequent definition of clitoromegaly is when there is a CI{{definition|date=December 2011}} of greater than 35&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (0.05&nbsp;inches<sup>2</sup>), which is almost twice the size given above for an ''average'' sized clitoral hood.<ref>{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Anatomy: Clitoral and Labia Size |url=http://www.the-clitoris.com/f_html/c_size.htm}}</ref>

==Presentation==

In the most pronounced cases, clitoromegaly is a symptom of [[intersexuality]] since the large clitoris resembles a penis.
The different grade of genital ambiguity is commonly measured by the [[Andrea Prader|Prader]] classification<ref>Prader Von, A. (1954). "Der genitalbefund beim Pseudohermaproditismus femininus des kongenitalen adrenogenitalen Syndroms. Morphologie, Hausfigkeit, Entwicklung und Vererbung der verschiedenen Genitalformen." Helv. Pediatr. Acta. 9: 231-248.</ref> ranging, in ascending order of masculinisation, from '''1''': ''Female external genitalia with clitoromegaly'' through '''5''': ''Pseudo-Phallus looking like normal male external genitalia''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sickkids.ca/childphysiology/cpwp/genital/GenitalCAH.htm |title=Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia(CAH), Prader Scale |accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080509182258/http://www.sickkids.ca/childphysiology/cpwp/genital/GenitalCAH.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-09}}</ref>

==Causes==
Clitoromegaly is otherwise a rare condition and can be either present by birth or acquired later in life.
If present at birth, [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] can be one of the causes, since in this condition the adrenal gland of the female fetus produces additional androgens and the newborn baby has ambiguous genitalia which are not clearly male or female. In pregnant women, who received [[norethisterone]] during pregnancy masculanization of fetus occurs, resulting in hypertrophy of clitoris;<ref>{{cite journal|last=NA|first=Beischer|coauthors=Cookson T, Sheedy M, Wein P.|title=Norethisterone and gestational diabetes.|journal=Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol.|date=Aug 1992|volume=32|issue=3|pages=233–8|pmid=1445134|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1445134|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> although this is rarely seen nowadays due to use of safer [[progestogens]]. It can also be caused by the [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] congenital disorder known as [[Fraser syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Haelst MM, Scambler PJ, Hennekam RC |title=Fraser syndrome: A clinical study of 59 cases and evaluation of diagnostic criteria |journal=Am J Med Genet a |volume= 143a|issue= 24|pages= 3194–203|year=2007 |pmid=18000968 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31951}}</ref>

In acquired clitoromegaly, the main cause is due to endocrine hormonal imbalance affecting the adult women, including [[polycystic ovarian syndrome|polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome |author=Mukhtar I Khan, MD |accessdate=2008-09-28 |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2173.htm}}</ref> and [[hyperthecosis]].  Acquired clitoromegaly may also be caused by pathologies affecting the ovaries and other endocrine glands.  These pathologies may include virulent (such as [[arrhenoblastoma]]) and [[neurofibromatosis|neurofibromatosic]] tumors.<ref name="Horejsí">{{cite journal |author=Horejsí J.|title=Acquired clitoral enlargement.

Deliberately induced [[clitoris enlargement]] as a form of female genital [[body modification]] is achieved through various uses of anabolic steroids, including [[testosterone]], and may also be referred to as clitoromegaly.<ref name="Copcu"/><ref name="Atilla">{{cite journal |authors=Atilla Şenaylı, Etlik Ankara |title=Controversies on clitoroplasty |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Urology |volume= 3 |issue= 6|pages=273–277|year=2011|month= December|pmid=22164197 |doi=10.1177/1756287211428165 |pmc=3229251}}</ref><ref name="Perovic">{{cite journal|authors=S.V.
