An '''abdominal pregnancy''' is a form of an [[ectopic pregnancy]] where the [[pregnancy]] is implanted within the [[peritoneal cavity]] outside the fallopian tube or ovary and not located in the [[broad ligament]].<ref name=atrash>{{cite journal |author=Atrash HK, Friede A, Hogue CJR |title=Abdominal Pregnancy in the United States: Frequency and Mortality |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology | month=March |volume=63 |pages=333–7| pmid=3822281| issue=3 |year=1987 }}</ref> While rare, abdominal pregnancies have a higher [[maternal mortality|mortality]] rate than ectopic pregnancies in general but, on occasion, can lead to a delivery of a viable infant.

==Frequency==
About 1% of ectopic pregnancies in the United States are abdominal, or about 10 out of every 100,000 pregnancies.<ref name=atrash/> A report from Nigeria places the frequency in that country at 34 per 100,000 deliveries.<ref name=Sunday>{{cite journal|  author= Sunday-Adeoye I, Twomey D, Egwuatu EV, Okonta PI  |title=A 30-year review of advanced abdominal pregnancy at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Afikpo, southeastern Nigeria (1976-2006)| journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics |pmid=19876640|  year= 2011|  volume= 283|  issue= 1|  pages=19–24|  doi= 10.1007/s00404-009-1260-4}}</ref> Risk factors are similar to tubal pregnancy with [[sexually transmitted disease]] playing a major role.<ref name=hk>{{cite journal |url= http://www.hkmj.org/article_pdfs/hkm0012p425.pdf |title= Abdominal pregnancy presenting as a missed abortion at 16 weeks' gestation |author=KY Kun, PY Wong, MW Ho, CM Tai, TK Ng |journal=Hong Kong Medical Journal |accessdate=January 25, 2009|pmid= 11177167 |year= 2000 |volume= 6 |issue= 4 |pages= 425–7}}</ref> The [[maternal mortality]] rate is estimated to be about 5 per 1,000 cases, about seven times the rate for ectopics in general, and about 90 times the rate for a delivery (US data).<ref name=atrash/>

==Anatomy==
[[Implantation (human embryo)|Implantation]] sites includes the [[peritoneum]] outside of the uterus, the [[rectouterine pouch]] (culdesac of Douglas), [[Greater omentum|omentum]],  [[bowel]] and its [[mesentery]], [[mesosalpinx]], and the peritoneum of the pelvic wall and the abdominal wall.<ref name=atrash/><ref name=bonn/> The growing placenta may be attached to several organs including tube and ovary.  Rare other sites have been the [[liver]] and [[spleen]].<ref name=ogi>{{cite journal |url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ogi/2009/247452.html |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology International| year=2009 |doi=10.1155/2009/247452Case+Report |title=An Early Abdominal Wall Ectopic Pregnancy Successfully Treated with Ultrasound Guided Intralesional Methotrexate: A Case Report| author=Anderson PM, Opfer EK, Busch JM, Magann EF |pmid=}}</ref> giving rise to a '''hepatic pregnancy'''<ref>{{cite journal| author=Chui AK, Lo KW, Choi PC, Sung MC, Lau JW.|title=Primary hepatic pregnancy |journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery |pmid=11355741|month=April |year=2001 |volume=71 |issue=4| pages=260–1}}</ref> or '''splenic pregnancy''', respectively.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Yagil Y, Beck-Razi N, Amit A, Kerner H, Gaitini D |title=Splenic Pregnancy: The Role of Abdominal Imaging |journal=Journal of Ultrasound Medicine | pmid=17957059| year=2007| volume=26| issue=11| pages=1629–32}}</ref> Even an early diaphragmatic pregnancy has been described in a patient where an embryo began growing on the underside of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Norenberg DD, Gundersen JH, Janis JF, Gundersen AL. |title=Early pregnancy on the diaphragm with endometriosis |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |pmid=850582|month=May | year=1977| volume=49| issue=5| pages=620–2}}</ref>

===Primary versus secondary implantation===
A primary abdominal pregnancy refers to a pregnancy that implanted directly in the abdominal cavity and its organs, save for the tubes and ovaries; such pregnancies are very rare, only 24 cases had been reported by 2007.<ref name=dahiya>{{cite journal |title=Advanced Abdominal Pregnancy: A Diagnostic and Management Dilemma| author=Krishna Dahiya, Damyanti Sharma |journal= Journal of Gynecologic Surgery |doi=10.1089/gyn.2007.B-02259-1 |url= http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/gyn.2007.B-02259-1?cookieSet=1&journalCode=gyn  |pmid= |month=June |year=2007 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=69–72 }}</ref> Typically an abdominal pregnancy is a secondary implantation which means that it originated from a tubal (less common an ovarian) pregnancy and re-implanted.<ref name=bonn>{{cite web |url= http://www.meb.uni-bonn.de/dtc/primsurg/docbook/html/x5173.html |title=Primary Surgery; Volume One: Non-trauma. Chapter 8,  Abdominal pregnancy |author= Maurice King, Peter C. Bewes, James Cairns, Jim Thornton (editors) |publisher=[[Bonn University]] |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>  To diagnose the rare primary abdominal pregnancy, Studdiford's criteria need to be fulfilled: tubes and ovaries should be normal, there is no abnormal connection ([[fistula]]) between the uterus and the abdominal cavity, and the pregnancy is related solely to the peritoneal surface without signs that there was a tubal pregnancy first.<ref name=ogi/>

==Diagnosis==
A patient with an abdominal pregnancy may just display the normal signs of pregnancy or have [[non-specific symptom]]s such as [[abdominal pain]], [[vaginal bleeding]], and/or gastrointestinal symptoms.<ref name=bonn/> Frequently the diagnosis of an abdominal pregnancy is missed.<ref name=Sunday/> However, it is a dangerous condition as it can bleed  intraperitoneally resulting in a [[medical emergency]] with [[hemorrhagic shock]] and can be fatal; other causes of maternal death in patients with an abdominal pregnancy include [[toxemia]]{{dn|date=March 2013}}, [[anemia]], [[pulmonary embolus]], [[coagulopathy]], and infection.<ref name=hk/>

Suspicion of an abdominal pregnancy is raised when the baby‘s parts can be easily felt, or the [[Lie (obstetrics)|lie]] is abnormal. [[Obstetrical ultrasonography|Sonography]] is extremely helpful in the diagnosis as it can demonstrate that the pregnancy is outside an empty uterus, there is no [[amniotic fluid]] between the placenta and the fetus,  no uterine wall surrounding the  fetus,   fetal parts are close to the abdominal wall, and the fetus is in abnormal lie.<ref name=hk/> [[MRI]] has also been used with success to diagnose abdominal pregnancy.<ref name=dahiya/> Elevated [[alpha-fetoprotein]] levels are another clue of the presence of an abdominal pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Tromans PM, Coulson R, Lobb MO, Abdulla U |title= Abdominal pregnancy associated with extremely elevated serum alphafetoprotein: case report |journal= British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology |pmid=6200135 | year=1984 | volume=91 | issue=3 | pages=296–8}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Potential treatments consist of surgery with termination of the pregnancy (removal of the fetus) via [[laparoscopy]] or [[laparotomy]], use of [[methotrexate]], [[embolization]], and combinations of these.  Sapuri and Klufio indicate that conservative treatment is also possible if the following criteria are met: 1. there are no major congenital malformations; 2. the fetus is alive; 3. there is continuous hospitalization in a well-equipped and well-staffed maternity unit which has immediate blood transfusion facilities; 4. there is careful monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing; and 5. placental implantation is in the lower abdomen away from the liver and spleen.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.pngimr.org.pg/png_med_journal/Advanced%20viable%20-%20%20Mar%2097.pdf |author=Sapuri M, Klufio C |title=A case of advanced viable extrauterine pregnancy |journal= Papua New Guinea Medical Journal | volume=40 |pages=44–47 |date=March, 1997 |pmid=10365569| issue=1 }}</ref> The choice is largely dictated by the clinical situation.  Generally, treatment is indicated when the diagnosis is made; however, the situation of the advanced abdominal pregnancy is more complicated.

===Advanced abdominal pregnancy===
Advanced abdominal pregnancy refers to situations where the pregnancy continues past 20 weeks of [[gestation]].<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=0q502jvng20024u6&size=largest |author=White RG |title=Advance Abdominal Pregnancy – A Review of 23 Cases  |journal= Irish Journal of Medical Science | volume=158 |pages=77–8 |date=March, 1989 |pmid=2753657| issue=3 |doi= 10.1007/BF02942151}}</ref>  In those situations, live births have been reported, so in a report from Nigeria with four live births out of a series of 20 abdominal pregnancies.<ref name=Sunday/> Often, however, with  advancement of the  pregnancy the support for the fetus becomes compromised and the fetus dies.  A patient may carry a dead fetus but will not go into labor. Over time, the fetus calcifies and becomes a [[lithopedion]].

It is generally recommended to perform a laparotomy when the diagnosis of an abdominal pregnancy is made.<ref name=bonn/> However, if the pregnancy is past 24 weeks and the baby alive and medical support systems are in place, careful watching could be considered to bring the baby to [[Viability (fetal)|viability]] (34–36 weeks).<ref name=bonn/> Women with an abdominal pregnancy will not go into labor. Delivery in a case of an advanced abdominal pregnancy will have to be via [[laparotomy]]. The survival of the baby is reduced and high [[perinatal mortality]] rates between 40-95% have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin JN Jr, Sessums JK, Martin RW, Pryor JA, Morrison JC| title=Abdominal pregnancy: current concepts of management |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |pmid=3281075 |year=1988 |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=549–57}}</ref>

Babies of abdominal pregnancies often have [[birth defect]]s due to compression in the absence of the [[amniotic fluid]] buffer. The rate of [[malformation]]s and deformations is estimated to be about 21%; typical deformations are facial and cranial asymmetries and joint abnormalities and the most common malformations are limb defects and central nervous malformations.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Stevens CA| title=Malformations and deformations in abdominal pregnancy |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics | pmid=8291554| year=1993| volume=47| issue=8| pages=1189–95| doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320470812}}</ref>

Once the baby has been delivered [[placenta]]l management becomes an issue. In normal deliveries the contraction of  uterus  provides a powerful mechanism to control blood loss, however, in an abdominal pregnancy the placenta is located over tissue that cannot contract and attempts of its removal may lead to significant blood loss. Generally, unless the placenta can be easily tied off or removed, it may be preferable to leave it in place and allow for a natural regression.<ref name=hk/><ref name=bonn/> This process may take about four months and can be monitored by checking [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] levels. Use of  [[methotrexate]] to accelerate placental regression is controversial as the large amount of necrotic tissue is a potential site for infection.<ref name=hk/> Placental vessels have also been blocked by angiographic [[embolization]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cardosi RJ, Nackley AC, Londono J, Hoffman MS |title=Embolization for advanced abdominal pregnancy with a retained placenta. A case report |journal=Reproductive Medicine |pmid=12418072 |year=2002 |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=861–3}}</ref>
