'''Maxwell Myer Wintrobe''' (October 27, 1901-December 9, 1986) was an Austrian-born physician who was a 20th century authority in the medical field of [[hematology]]. His textbook on hematology was the first dedicated work in the field, and he contributed to the diagnostic approach of [[anemia]] and [[copper]] metabolism, amongst many other achievements.

==Biography==
Wintrobe was born in Austria (Fred 2007), contrary to previous historical records. His family name of reflects the Jewish origin of his parents, Herman and Ethel, who emigrated from Austria with their son Max in 1906. Canadian census records show that the family arrived in  [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] in 1906 where Ethel's four brothers were living at the time. The family moved to Manitoba in 1912.  Wintrobe attended the [[University of Manitoba]] from the early age of fifteen, where he graduated in 1921 and obtained his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1926. He married Becky Zamphir, and moved to the [[United States]], where he obtained a [[PhD]] at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] in 1929; his thesis was titled "The Erythrocyte in Man".

Initially working in [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], where he served on the faculty, he was appointed as professor of [[internal medicine]] at the College of Medicine of the [[University of Utah]] in 1943; he also served as the first Chairman of the Department of Medicine and physician-in-chief for the [[Salt Lake County General Hospital]].

In Salt Lake City he led research in hereditary and metabolic disorders (1945–1973) and cardiovascular research (1969–1973). He retired officially in 1965, but remained in function until 1973 (Valentine 1990). In that year he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].

==Works==
In New Orleans, Wintrobe pioneered new ways of measuring the [[hematocrit]], including what are now known as Wintrobe indices: [[mean cell volume]], [[mean cell hemoglobin]], and [[mean cell hemoglobin concentration]], all quantitative measures of the [[red blood cell]] population (Wintrobe 1932). Much of this work continued in Hopkins and Utah, where he also worked on [[pernicious anemia]], [[copper]] metabolism and [[Wilson's disease]], [[sickle-cell disease]] and other [[anemia]]s.

Wintrobe was the principal editor of ''Clinical Hematology'', which first appeared in 1942 and is in its eleventh edition (Greer ''et al.'' {{As of|2003|lc=on}}), still bearing his name. He was part of the team that pioneered the use of [[chemotherapy]] in [[cancer]] (Goodman ''et al.'' 1946). He was one of the editors of the first edition (1950) of ''[[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]]''.

In 1980 he published ''Blood, pure and eloquent'', and in 1985 appeared ''Hematology, the Blossoming of a Science''. Both works are historical overviews of his field.
