'''Andromachus''' ({{lang-el|Ἀνδρόμαχος}}; 1st century) was the name of two [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physicians]], father and son, who lived in the time of [[Nero]].

*'''Andromachus the Elder''', was born in [[Crete]], and was physician to [[Nero]], 54-68 AD. He is principally celebrated for having been the first person on whom the title of "[[Archiater]]" is known to have been conferred, and also for having been the inventor of a very famous compound medicine and antidote, which was called after his name ''[[Theriac|Theriaca Andromachi]]'', which long enjoyed a great reputation. Andromachus has left us the directions for making this strange mixture in a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[elegiac]] poem, consisting of 174 lines, and dedicated to Nero. [[Galen]] has inserted it in two of his works,<ref>Galen, ''De Antid.'' i. 6, and ''De Ther. ad Pis.'' c. 6. vol. xiv. pp. 32-42</ref> and says that Andromachus chose this form as being more easily remembered than prose, and less likely to be altered. Some persons suppose him to be the author of a work on [[pharmacy]], but this is generally attributed to his son, Andromachus the Younger.

*'''Andromachus the Younger''', the son of Andromachus the Elder, may also have been an imperial physician. Nothing is known of the events of his life, but he is generally supposed to have been the author of a work on [[pharmacy]] in three books,<ref>Galen, ''De Compos. Medicam. sec. Gen.'' ii. 1. vol. xiii. p. 463</ref> which is quoted very frequently and with approbation by Galen, but of which only a few fragments remain.
