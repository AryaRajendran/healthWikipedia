'''Adrenal insufficiency''' is a condition in which the [[adrenal gland]]s, located above the [[kidney]]s, do not produce adequate amounts of [[steroid hormone]]s (chemicals produced by the body that regulate organ function), primarily [[cortisol]]; but may also include impaired production of [[aldosterone]] (a [[mineralocorticoid]]), which regulates [[sodium]] conservation, [[potassium]] secretion, and water retention.<ref name="addisons_disease.aspx">{{cite journal | author=Eileen K.

[[Addison's disease]] and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] can manifest as adrenal insufficiency. If not treated, adrenal insufficiency may result in severe abdominal pains, vomiting, profound muscle weakness and fatigue, [[clinical depression|depression]], extremely low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]), weight loss, kidney failure, changes in mood and personality, and shock (adrenal crisis).<ref name="ch164b.html">{{cite journal | author=Ashley B.

Adrenal insufficiency can also occur when the [[hypothalamus]] or the [[pituitary gland]], both located at the base of the [[Human skull|skull]], does not make adequate amounts of the hormones that assist in regulating adrenal function.<ref name="addisons_disease.aspx"/><ref name="urlJAMA -- Adrenal Insufficiency, November 16, 2005, Brender et al. 294 (19): 2528">{{cite journal |author=Brender E, Lynm C, Glass RM |title=JAMA patient page.

==Types==
There are three major types of adrenal insufficiency.
* ''Primary adrenal insufficiency'' is due to impairment of the adrenal glands.
** One subtype is called [[idiopathic]], or of unknown cause.
** 80% are due to an [[autoimmune disease]] called [[Addison's disease]] or [[autoimmune adrenalitis]].
** Other cases are due to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] or an [[adenoma]] (tumor) of the adrenal gland.
* ''Secondary adrenal insufficiency'' is caused by impairment of the [[pituitary gland]] or [[hypothalamus]].<ref name="Hypopituitary">{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hypopituitary |title=hypopituitary |year=2006}}</ref> The most common cause in the United States is exogenous steroid use. Other causes are a pituitary adenoma or microadenoma; a hypothalamic tumor (surgical removal of a pituitary tumor can also suppress production of ACTH and lead to adrenal deficiency); and [[Sheehan's syndrome]], which is associated with impairment of only the pituitary gland.
* ''Tertiary adrenal insufficiency'' is due to hypothalamic disease and decrease in corticotropin releasing factor (CRF).<ref>http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal13/adrenal13.htm</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include: [[hypoglycemia]], [[dehydration]], [[weight loss]], and disorientation. Symptoms may also include weakness, tiredness, dizziness, [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]] that falls further when standing ([[orthostatic hypotension]]), [[cardiovascular]] collapse, [[muscle]] [[aches]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]]. These problems may develop gradually and insidiously. [[Addison's disease]] can present with tanning of the skin that may be patchy or even all over the body. Characteristic sites of tanning are skin creases (e.g. of the hands) and the inside of the cheek ([[buccal mucosa]]). [[Goitre]] and [[vitiligo]] may also be present.<ref name="ch164b.html"/>

== Causes ==
Causes of acute adrenal insufficiency are mainly [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]], sudden withdrawal of long-term [[corticosteroid therapy]], and [[Stress (biology)|stress]] in patients with underlying chronic adrenal insufficiency.<ref name=Robbins20-7>Table 20-7 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref> The latter is termed [[critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency]].

For chronic adrenal insufficiency, the major contributors are [[autoimmune adrenalitis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[AIDS]], and [[metastatic]] disease.<ref name=Robbins20-7/> Minor causes of chronic adrenal insufficiency are [[systemic amyloidosis]], [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]]s, [[hemochromatosis]], and [[sarcoidosis]].<ref name=Robbins20-7/>

Autoimmune adrenalitis may be part of [[Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2|Type 2 autoimmune polyglandular syndrome]], which can include [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], [[hyperthyroidism]], and autoimmune [[thyroid disease]] (also known as [[autoimmune thyroiditis]], [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], and Hashimoto's disease).<ref name="topic47.htm">{{cite journal | author=Thomas A Wilson, MD | title=Adrenal Insufficiency | journal=Adrenal Gland Disorders|year=2007|url=http://www.emedicine.com/PED/topic47.htm}}</ref> [[Hypogonadism]] and [[pernicious anemia]] may also present with this syndrome.

[[Adrenoleukodystrophy]] can also cause adrenal insufficiency.<ref name="921176192.html">{{cite journal | author=Thomas A Wilson, MD | title= Adrenoleukodystrophy |year=1999|url=http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/921176192.html}}</ref>

Adrenal insufficiency can also result when a patient has a [[Craniopharyngioma|craniopharyngioma]], which is a histologically benign tumor that can damage the pituitary gland and so cause the adrenal glands not to function. This would be an example of secondary adrenal insufficiency syndrome.

Adrenal insufficiency can also occur when a patients suffers [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]] long term.  This can induce Adrenal Insufficiency through oxidative damage to any of the [[Hypothalamus]] the [[Pituitary gland]] or the [[Adrenal gland]].  Onset in these cases is often insidious.

==Diagnosis==
If the person is in [[adrenal crisis]], the [[ACTH stimulation test]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=21656493 | doi=10.1024/0040-5930/a000174 | volume=68 | issue=6 | title=[Adrenal insufficiency--diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice] | year=2011 | month=June | author=Henzen C | journal=Ther Umsch | pages=337–43}}</ref>  may be given. If not in crisis, cortisol, ACTH, aldosterone, renin, potassium, and sodium are tested from a blood sample before the decision is made whether the ACTH stimulation test needs to be performed. X-rays or CT of the adrenals may also be done.<ref name="addisons_disease.aspx"/> The best test for adrenal insufficiency of autoimmune origin, representing more than ninety percent of all cases in a Western population, is measurement of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies.
