'''Sue Ryder''' is a charity (originally called the '''Sue Ryder Foundation''' and more recently '''Sue Ryder Care''') which was founded in 1953 by [[Sue Ryder]], with the creation of a nursing home in [[Suffolk]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. 

With over 50 years experience providing health and social care, Sue Ryder supports people with complex needs and life-threatening illnesses throughout their pathway of needs across the UK.  The charity supports people living with conditions including cancer, multiple sclerosis, dementia and stroke at 7 specialist palliative care centres, 6 care centres for people with complex conditions, 15 homecare services and a growing portfolio of tailored, community-based services.

Care Centres are currently located in the following areas:

* Aberdeen - Neurological Care
* Arbroath - Homecare
* [[Birchley Hall]], Nr Wigan - Neurological Care
* [[Cuerden Hall]], Preston - Neurological Care
* Duchess of Kent House, Reading - Palliative Care
* [[Holme Hall, East Riding of Yorkshire|Holme Hall, East Yorks]] - Neurological Care
* Leckhampton Court Hospice, Cheltenham - Palliative Care
* Manorlands Hall, Keighley - Palliative Care
* Nettlebed Hospice, Henley-on-Thames - Palliative Care
* St Johns Hospice, Bedford - Palliative Care
* Stagenhoe, Hitching - Neurological Care
* Stirling - Homecare
* The Chantry, Ipswich - Neurological Care
* Thorpe Hall Hospice, Peterborough - Palliative Care
* Wheatfields Hospice, Leeds - Palliative Care

In line with many people’s preference to be cared for at home, Sue Ryder is increasingly focussing on developing more community-based services that support people to remain independent and live well in their own homes for as long as possible.  

Sue Ryder's name is also associated with services in 12 countries across the globe.  Since 1953, the charity has played a leading role in influencing national and international policy debates and stimulating the evolution of care services in developing countries.  The charity's overseas partners, in places including Albania and Malawi, play an important role in providing palliative care, residential care for disabled people and older people, and community-based nursing for people with chronic conditions.    

Sue Ryder needs to raise approximately £13million (pounds sterling) each year to supplement its statutory income to continue providing 4 million hours of care a year, which is raised from fundraising and through Sue Ryder [[Charity shop|Shops]], of which there are around 350 in the UK.

Sue Ryder also relies on volunteering support and currently has 9000 volunteers across the UK supporting its work.  The charity has the largest range of volunteering roles listed on its website in the third sector - over 400 - and also offers bespoke opportunities, matching individual skills and interests to roles.  Sue Ryder launched its Prisoner Volunteer Programme in January 2007, which has placed approximately 400 prisoners in 60 shops nationwide, all of whom have provided valued support in helping its charity shops raise vital funds.  

In 2008-9 Sue Ryder had an annual expenditure of £75.516 million, placing it in the top 70 of UK charities ranked by expenditure.<ref>[http://www.charitiesdirect.com/CharitiesSearchTop500.asp?sortby=E Charities Direct: Top 500 Charities - Expenditure]</ref> 

The charity is headquartered at [[Upper Woburn Place]] in [[London]] and is a Registered Charity in England & Wales.<ref>[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1052076&submit=Run+Search Charity Commission for England and Wales: Charity Number 1052076]</ref> It dropped the word "Care" from its operating name in April 2011 after a public consultation suggested that it sounded unclear, [[corporate]] and distant.<ref>Tania Mason, [http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/8771/sue_ryder_wins_five-year_county-wide_care_contract Sue Ryder wins five-year county-wide care contract], ''Civil Society'', 7 April 2011.

==Workfare Controversy ==
In February 2013 Sue Ryder was criticised for taking part in the UK Government [[workfare]] schemes. <ref>[http://johnnyvoid.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/we-make-millions-from-forcing-sick-and-disabled-to-work-boast-sue-ryder/ we-make-millions-from-forcing-sick-and-disabled-to-work-boast-sue-ryder]</ref> This criticism came in light of a broader backlash against the UK Government's workfare policies where people living on benefits, including the unemployed and sick and disabled people, are instructed to attend unpaid work at various companies and charities, at the risk of losing their benefits if they do not comply.

A Rolling Online Pickett was organised. <ref>[http://www.boycottworkfare.org/?p=2121]</ref>

Sue Ryder responded with this defence but were criticised for confusing workfare participants with volunteers. <ref>[http://www.sueryder.org/Get-involved/Volunteering/~/media/Files/Get-involved/Volunteering/Sue%20RyderQAWorkfareFeb13.ashx Workfare defence]</ref>

Sue Ryder later bowed to public pressure and promised a "phased withdrawal" from the controversial scheme. <ref>[http://www.sueryder.org/Get-involved/Volunteering/~/media/Files/Get-involved/Volunteering/Sue_RyderPosition%20Statement_Workfare_Feb_25%202013.ashx]</ref> 

Sue Ryder executives were also criticised for looking to profit from the privatization of the NHS. <ref>[http://tompride.wordpress.com/2013/02/23/sue-ryder-executives-looking-to-profit-from-the-privatisation-of-nhs-services/ Sue Ryder and NHS profiteering]</ref>

On the 25th of January 2013, Sue Ryder Care announced it would be withdrawing from participation in the government's workfare schemes. <ref>[http://www.sueryder.org/Get-involved/Volunteering/~/media/Files/Get-involved/Volunteering/Sue_RyderPosition%20Statement_Workfare_Feb_25%202013.ashx]</ref>
