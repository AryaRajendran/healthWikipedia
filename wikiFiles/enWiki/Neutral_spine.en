== Posture and natural curvatures ==

The word ''posture'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''ponere'', which means "to put or place." The general concept of [[human posture]] refers to "the carriage of the body as a whole, the attitude of the body, or the position of the limbs (the arms and legs)." <ref>{{Citation

Reduction in curvature is typically termed flat back if present in the thoracic region and lumbar kyphosis if present in the lumbar region.<ref name="Marieb 2001 215–216"/> In [[Posture Assessment|posture analysis]], the spine is compared to a plumb line to detect the aforementioned abnormalities. From the anterior/posterior view this plumb line should run vertically down the midline of the body dividing it symmetrically into right and left halves indicating even weight distribution on left and right sides. From the sagittal view the plumb line should bisect the ear, odontoid process of C2, the cervical vertebral bodies, the center of the glenohumeral joint, the lumbar vertebral bodies, the center of the acetabulum, just posterior to the patella, and through the tarsals of the feet.<ref>{{Citation

== Quantifying abnormalities ==

[[Scoliosis]] is well established and even evaluated at an early age. It is typically quantified using the standardized [[Cobb angle|Cobb angle method]]. This method consists of measuring the degree of deformity by the angle between two successive vertebrae. The Cobb method was accepted by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) in 1966. It serves as the standard method for quantification of scoliosis deformities.<ref name="Vrtovec 2009 593–605"/> Sagittal plane posture aberrations such as cervical and lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis have yet to be quantified due to considerable inter-individual variability in normal sagittal curvature.<ref>{{Citation

As a 2D measurement technique it has limitations and new techniques are being proposed for measurement of these curvatures.<ref name="Vrtovec 2009 593–605"/> Most recently, 3D imaging techniques using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) have been attempted. These techniques are promising but lack the reliability and validity necessary to be used as a reference for clinical purposes.<ref name="Vrtovec 2009 593–605"/> 

Posture assessment has also become quite popular in many practical environments like the personal training and sports conditioning settings. The need for reliable methods of posture assessment as a screening tool is warranted. Current available programs such as those through the National Posture Institute (NPI) and Posture Print are recommended for the practical setting but cost close to $1000 and may not be feasible for all practitioners.

Chronic deviations from neutral spine leads to improper posture. Increased stress on your back and causes discomfort and damage. When the spine is left in non-neutral posture for extended periods of time, it raises the diaphragm, preventing the body from taking a full breath. This can lead to reduced oxygenation throughout the body. It can also compromise the internal organs' performance by putting pressure throughout the abdomen.<ref>www.thesoarmethod.com</ref> People who sit for long hours on the job are susceptible to a number of misalignments."<ref>{{Citation
