A '''limb infarction''' is an [[infarction|area of tissue death]] of an [[arm]] or [[leg]]. It may cause ''skeletal muscle infarction'', [[avascular necrosis]] of bones, or necrosis of a part of or an entire limb.

==Affected tissues==
The major tissues affected are nerves and muscles, where irreversible damage starts to occur after 4–6 hours of cessation of blood supply.<ref name=bergqvist>[http://www.internetmedicin.se/dyn_main.asp?page=1529 internetmedicin.se > Artäremboli / thrombos] Professor David Bergqvist. Reviewed by Professor Joar Svanvik. Updated 2007-11-10</ref>

[[Skeletal muscle]], the major tissue affected, is still relatively resistant to infarction compared to the heart and brain because its ability to rely on [[anaerobic metabolism]] by [[glycogen]] stored in the cells, which may supply the muscle tissue long enough for any clot to dissolve, either by intervention or the body's own system for thrombus breakdown. In contrast, brain tissue (in [[cerebral infarction]]) does not store glycogen, and the heart (in [[myocardial infarction]]) is so specialized on aerobic metabolism that not enough energy can be liberated by [[Lactic acid#Exercise and lactate|lactate production]] to sustain its needs.<ref>Ganong, Review of Medical Physiology, 22nd Edition.Specialized form of muscle that is peculiar to the vertebrate heart.p81</ref>

[[Bone]] is more susceptible to ischemia, with [[hematopoietic cell]]s usually dying within 12 hours, and other [[bone cell]]s ([[osteocyte]]s, [[osteoclast]]s, [[osteoblast]]s etc.) within 12–48 hours.<ref name=nawazkhan>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/387545-overview eMedicine Specialties > Bone Infarct] Author: Ali Nawaz Khan. Coauthors: Mohammed Jassim Al-Salman, Muthusamy Chandramohan, Sumaira MacDonald, Charles Edward Hutchinson</ref> On the other hand, it has better regenerative capacity once blood supply is reestablished, as the remaining dead inorganic [[osseous tissue]] forms a framework upon which immigrating cells can reestablish functional bone tissue in optimal conditions.<ref name=nawazkhan/>

==Causes==
Causes include:
*[[Thrombosis]] (approximately 40%<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |author=Campbell WB, Ridler BM, Szymanska TH |title=Current management of acute leg ischaemia: results of an audit by the Vascular Surgical Society of Great Britain and Ireland |journal=Br J Surg |volume=85 |issue=11 |pages=1498–503 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9823910 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2168.1998.00906.x |url=}}</ref> of cases)
*[[Arterial embolism]] (approximately 40%<ref name=Campbell/>)
*[[arteriosclerosis obliterans]]<ref name=aho/>
Another cause of limb infarction is ''skeletal muscle infarction'' as a rare complication of long standing, poorly controlled [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=Grigoriadis>{{cite journal |author=Grigoriadis E, Fam AG, Starok M, Ang LC |title=Skeletal muscle infarction in diabetes mellitus |journal=J. Rheumatol. |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=1063–8 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10782838 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Early symptoms of an arterial embolism in the arms or legs appear as soon as there is [[ischemia]] of the tissue, even before any frank infarction has begun. Such symptoms may include:
* Coldness in a leg, arm, hand or fingers<ref name=medlineplus>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001102.htm MedlinePlus > Arterial embolism] Sean O. Stitham, MD and David C. Dugdale III, MD. Also reviewed by David Zieve, MD. Reviewed last on: 5/8/2008.

Retrieved on April 30, 2010</ref>
* Decreased or no pulse in an arm or leg beyond the site of blockage<ref name=medlineplus/><ref name=mdguidelines/>
* Pain in the affected area<ref name=medlineplus/><ref name=mdguidelines/>
* Muscle spasm in the affected area<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Numbness and tingling in an arm or leg<ref name=medlineplus/><ref name=mdguidelines/>
* Paleness ([[pallor]])<ref name=medlineplus/><ref name=mdguidelines/> of the skin of the arm or leg
* [[Muscle weakness]] of an arm or leg,<ref name=medlineplus/><ref name=mdguidelines/> possibly to the grade of [[paralysis]]<ref name=mdguidelines/>

Later symptoms are closely related to [[infarction]] of the tissue supplied by the occluded artery:
* [[Blister]]s of the skin in the affected area<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Shedding of skin ([[desquamation]])<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Skin erosion ([[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]])<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Discoloration ([[mottling]],<ref name=mdguidelines/> [[cyanosis]]<ref name=mdguidelines/> or darkening<ref name=medlineplus/>) of the skin following necrosis. The discoloration usually has a distinct demarcation at the blockage.<ref name=mdguidelines/>

A major presentation of diabetic ''skeletal muscle infarction'' is painful thigh or leg swelling.<ref name=Grigoriadis/>

==Diagnosis==
In addition to evaluating the symptoms described above, [[angiography]] can distinguish between cases caused by [[arteriosclerosis obliterans]] (displaying abnormalities in other vessels and [[collateral circulation]]s) from those caused by emboli.<ref name=aho/>

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is the preferred test for diagnosing ''skeletal muscle infarction''.<ref name=Grigoriadis/>

==Treatment==
Oxygen consumption of skeletal muscle is approximately 50 times larger while contracting than in the resting state.<ref>[http://www.cvphysiology.com/CAD/CAD003.htm Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts > Myocardial Oxygen Demand] Richard E. Klabunde, PhD</ref> Thus, resting the affected limb should delay onset of infarction substantially after arterial occlusion.

[[Low molecular weight heparin]] is used to reduce or at least prevent enlargement of a thrombus, and is also indicated before any surgery.<ref name=aho/>

In the legs, below the inguinal ligament, percutaneous [[aspiration thrombectomy]] is a rapid and effective way of removing thromboembolic occlusions.<ref name=Oguzkurt>{{cite journal |author=Oğuzkurt L, Ozkan U, Gümüş B, Coşkun I, Koca N, Gülcan O |title=Percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy in the treatment of lower extremity thromboembolic occlusions |journal=Diagn Interv Radiol |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=79–83 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20044798 |doi=10.4261/1305-3825.DIR.2654-09.1 |url=}}</ref> [[Balloon thrombectomy]] using a [[Fogarty catheter]] may also be used.<ref name=aho/> In the arms, balloon thrombectomy is an effective treatment for thromboemboli as well.<ref name=Magishi>{{cite journal |author=Magishi K, Izumi Y, Shimizu N |title=Short- and long-term outcomes of acute upper extremity arterial thromboembolism |journal=Ann Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=31–4 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20190707 |doi= |url=}}</ref> However, local thrombi from atherosclerotic plaque are harder to treat than embolized ones.<ref name=aho>''Kirurgiska åtgärder vid akut ischemi i nedre extremitet''.

No. 1, 2003</ref> If results are not satisfying, another angiography should be performed.<ref name=aho/>

[[Thrombolysis]] using analogs of [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (tPA) may be used as an alternative or complement to surgery.<ref name=aho/>

Where there is extensive vascular damage, [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]] of the vessels may be necessary to establish other ways to supply the affected parts.<ref name=aho/>

[[Image:Fasciotomy (Post Skin-Graft).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wound covered with a skin graft after pressure was relieved by [[fasciotomy]]. <span style="font-size:87%;">(Underlying disease not specified for this picture)</span>]]
Swelling of the limb may cause inhibited flow by increased pressure, and in the legs (but very rarely in the arms), this may indicate a [[fasciotomy]], opening up all four [[fascial compartments of leg|leg compartments]].<ref name=aho/>

Because of the high recurrence rates of thromboembolism, it is necessary to administer [[anticoagulant]] therapy as well.<ref name=Magishi/> [[Aspirin]] and [[low molecular weight heparin]] should be administered, and possibly [[warfarin]] as well.<ref name=aho/>

Follow-up includes checking [[peripheral pulse]]s and the [[arm-leg blood pressure gradient]].<ref name=aho/>

==Prognosis==
With treatment, approximately 80% of patients are alive<ref name=aho/> (approx. 95% after surgery<ref name=aho/>) and approximately 70% of infarcted limbs remain vital after 6 months.<ref name=aho/>

==Popular culture==
[[Gregory House]], the main character of the medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House M.D.]]'', was stricken with a limb infarction in his right quadriceps muscle.  The infarction became advanced.  Muscle death occurred and the doctors at the hospital tried a risky procedure in order to save his leg.  The quadriceps was removed, forcing House to walk with a cane.  The condition plays a large role in the development of his character.  It should be noted that the injury suffered by House is a rather extreme example of limb infarction.
