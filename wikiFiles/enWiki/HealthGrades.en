'''Healthgrades Inc.''' is a U.S. company that develops and markets quality and safety ratings of health care providers, including [[hospital]]s, [[nursing home]]s, [[physician]]s and [[dentist]]s. Quality ratings are devised from publicly available patient safety data and analyzed with proprietary technology developed by Healthgrades.<ref name=RD /> In addition to these ratings, Healthgrades offers consulting services to health care providers to improve safety and enhance marketing and public relations.

According to Healthgrades, hospital quality varies significantly from state to state. It rates [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Illinois]] and [[Ohio]] as having the best hospitals, while [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Nevada]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[West Virginia]] have the worst rated hospitals.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=USA Today |date=October 23, 2012 |page=5B |title=Which states have safest hospitals |author=Janice Lloyd |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/23/hospital-grades-ratings/1649811/ |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Origins==
The for-profit company, based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], was founded in 1998 by Kerry Hicks, who served as president and CEO of the predecessor ''Specialty Care Network'' from 1995 to 1999. Healthgrades grew steadily and in 2008, the company purchased Alijor, an internet company that gave health care providers the ability to display information about their business, including location(s), hours, insurance acceptance and credentials.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sibley |first=Lisa |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2008/07/28/newscolumn1.html |title=Alijor's online directory of providers growing |newspaper=San Jose Business Journal |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> Consumers could search the Ailjor site to find a health care provider that met their needs.<ref>[http://www.levelwing.com/case_study_alijor.html "Alijor"] Level Wing Marketing, Case studies</ref> Hicks grew Healthgrades into one of Colorado's largest public companies<ref name=WALK>[http://www.walkersresearch.com/profilePages/Show_Executive_Title/Executiveprofile/K/Kerry_R__Hicks_100000566.html "Profile of Kerry Hicks"] Walkers Research</ref> (formerly {{NASDAQ|HGRD}})<ref name=PR /> until [[Vestar Capital Partners]] acquired  the company in 2010<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9H851VG1.htm?dbk |title=Health Grades agrees to $294 private equity buyout |agency=Associated Press |work=[[Business Week]] |date=July 28, 2010 |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> and took the company private.<ref name=HOV>[http://www.hoovers.com/company/Health_Grades_Inc/htxfki-1.html "Healthgrades"] Hoovers Business Intelligence, Company profiles</ref>
In November 2011, Healthgrades merged with CPM Marketing, a [[Madison, Wisconsin]]–based company that provides [[customer relationship management]] solutions to hospitals. After the merger, CPM Marketing became CPM Healthgrades, a division of Healthgrades.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_19252043 |title=HealthGrades merges with monitoring firm CPM |author=David Migoya |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Ratings==
[[Image:HG5star.PNG|thumb|left|80px|sample award]]
Hospital ratings reports for specific procedures and diagnoses are compiled primarily from [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] claim data, and include all hospitals that are Medicare participants. Some critics insist that medical records should be used instead of claim records which do not include factors that affect patient outcomes. Ratings are updated yearly, but data is two years old before Medicare releases it. Therefore, the 2011 ratings are derived using data from 2007 to 2009.<ref name=RD>[http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/healthgrades.htm "Healthgrades.com - Consumer complaints for doctors"] Right Diagnosis website</ref><ref name=TRIB>{{cite news |last=Graham |first=Judith |url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/triage/2008/10/healthgrades-po.html |title=Healthgrades posts 2009 hospital rankings |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=October 15, 2008 |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.palmettohealth.org/body.cfm?id=3161&oTopID=3057 "Healthgrades"] Palmetto Health, facility evaluations</ref>

Healthgrades develops objective ratings based on data and information obtained from several sources, mostly available to the public. The data is analyzed using a proprietary methodology that identifies the recipients of the various awards and the "1-3-5 Star" designation.<ref name=SUIT /> Specifically, most ratings are determined from [[Multivariate statistics|multivariate]] [[logistic regression]]s of medical outcomes at a given healthcare provider and 1-, 3- and 5-star awards are given to providers whose negative outcomes are worse than expected, near predicted levels, and better than expected, respectively.<ref name=Sullivan/> The ratings have been criticized for oversights in the methodology that may actually penalize some institutions with ideal medical outcomes.<ref name=Sullivan>{{cite journal |author=Sullivan T |title=Editor's Commentary: A failing grade |journal=Ann Vasc Surg |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=707–8 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17103078 |doi=10.1007/s10016-006-9131-y |url=}}</ref> Because Healthgrades' algorithms are proprietary, outside experts have "expressed concern about the reliability and validity of such 'black box' rating scales."<ref name=Nash>{{cite journal |author=Nash, I |title=Web alert: Healthgrades |journal=Current Cardiology Reports |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=92–93 |year=|month=|pmid=|doi=10.1007/s11886-003-0073-5 |quote=The algorithms used to create the scores are proprietary; therefore, it is not possible to “score the scorecard.” Many quality experts have expressed concern about the reliability and validity of such “black box” rating scales.}}</ref>

[[Image:cardiac-award1.PNG|thumb|right|80px|sample award]]
In addition to "Star" ratings, Healthgrades identifies facilities for their ''Top 10% in the Nation'', ''Top 5% in the Nation'', ''America's 50 Best Hospitals'', ''Distinguished hospital award for Clinical Excellence'', and ''Excellence Awards'' in 26 areas:

Outstanding patient experience, Patient safety, Pediatric patient safety, Women's health, Bariatric surgery, Cardiac care, Cardiac surgery, Critical care, Coronary intervention, Gastrointestinal care, Gastrointestinal surgery, General surgery, Gynecologic surgery, Heart transplant, Joint replacement, Kidney transplant, Liver transplant, Lung transplant, Maternity services, Orthopedic services, Prostatectomy, Pulmonary care, Spine surgery, Stroke care and Vascular surgery.<ref>[http://www.healthgrades.com/find-a-hospital "Find a Hospital"] Healthgrades website</ref> Emergency medicine, Healthgrades newest rating area, was added in 2010.<ref name=PR />

===Licensing===
Hospitals are Healthgrades biggest customers and provide the bulk of the company's income. Hospitals that are highly rated providers will license Healthgrades' ratings and trademarks to use in their marketing promotions. The company uses litigation to protect its' name and ratings. Healthgrades sued the [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital]] in 2006 for copyright and trademark infringement after the hospital used Healthgrade's ratings and logo in promotional publications without paying licensing fees.<ref name=SUIT>[http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/Documents/Judges/Opinions/06-CV-02351-JLK.pdf "Healthgrades vs. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital"] US District Court files, June 19, 2009</ref>

===Consulting===
Healthgrades provides consulting services to more than 350 hospitals for recommendations on how to preserve or improve their quality of care, as well as marketing and business development.<ref name=WALK /><ref name=HOV />

==Independent evaluation ==
Medical experts have questioned the reliability of the 1-, 3- and 5-star ratings given to healthcare providers, criticizing the lack of transparency and perceived oversights in Healthgrades' methodology.<ref name=Sullivan/><ref name=Nash/>

A 2004 report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' concluded that Healthgrades had inaccurate physician disciplinary records (while competitor [[ChoicePoint]] had much greater accuracy).<ref name=RMN>{{cite news |url=http://m.rockymountainnews.com/news/2004/oct/16/analysis-gives-health-grades-flunking-marks/ |title=Analysis gives Health Grades flunking marks |author=Rachel Brand |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |date=October 16, 2004 |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> The report also detailed the complaints of former Healthgrades employees and physicians that pursued legal actions after inaccurate reports.<ref name=RMN/>

A 2002 study published in ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' reported that Healthgrades ratings for [[Mortality rate|mortality]] associated with [[acute myocardial infarction]] identified "groups of hospitals differing in the aggregate in quality of care and outcomes" but heterogeneity within the ratings for individual hospitals could not reliably discriminate between individual hospitals in quality of care or mortality.<ref name="Krumholz et al.">{{cite journal |author=Krumholz HM, Rathore SS, Chen J, Wang Y, Radford MJ |title=Evaluation of a consumer-oriented internet health care report card: the risk of quality ratings based on mortality data |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=10 |pages=1277–87 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11886319 |doi=10.1001/jama.287.10.1277 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11886319}}<p>Editoral comment: {{cite journal |author=Naylor CD |title= |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=10 |pages=1323–1325 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=|doi=10.1001/jama.287.10.1323 |url=}}<p>Letters: {{cite journal |author= |title= |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=24 |pages=3206–3208 |year=2002 |month=June|pmid=|doi=10.1001/jama.287.24.3206 |url=}}</ref> To illustrate: for any pair of hospitals rated to two different rating groups (1-, 3- or 5-star) by Healthgrades, the researchers determined that standardized [[mortality rate]]s were "comparable or even better in the lower-rated hospital in more than 90% of the comparisons".<ref name="Krumholz et al."/>

A 2011 study published in ''[[Archives of Surgery]]'' evaluated Healthgrades and ''[[US News & World Report]]'' ratings in [[Surgical oncology|oncologic surgeries]], comparing top-rated hospitals in the two reports to all other U.S. hospitals.<ref name="Osborne et al.">{{cite journal |author=Osborne NH, Ghaferi AA, Nicholas LH, Dimick JB |title=Evaluating popular media and internet-based hospital quality ratings for cancer surgery |journal=Arch Surg |volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=600–4 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21576612 |doi=10.1001/archsurg.2011.119 |url=}}<p>Invited critique: {{cite journal |author=Linehan DC, Jaques D |title=Choosing "The Best": Comment on "Evaluating Popular Media and Internet-Based Hospital Quality Ratings for Cancer Surgery" |journal=Arch Surg |volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=604–605 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=|doi=10.1001/archsurg.2011.97 |url=}}</ref> The authors determined that both ratings systems had substantive flaws in the evaluation of mortality following [[pancreatectomy]], [[esophagectomy]] or [[colectomy]]; only the top rated hospitals for colectomy in the ''US News & World Report'' ratings had a [[statistically significant]] lower mortality than national averages&mdash;mortality rates at Healthgrades' best hospitals were not not significantly lower for any of the three procedures.<ref name="Osborne et al."/>

A similar study, published in ''[[Journal of the American College of Surgeons]]'' in 2010, compared mortality in ''US News and World Report'' and HealthGgrades lists of "Best Hospitals" for [[abdominal aortic aneurysm repair]], [[coronary artery bypass]], [[aortic valve repair]] and [[mitral valve repair]].<ref name=Osborne2010>{{cite journal |author=Osborne NH, Nicholas LH, Ghaferi AA, Upchurch GR, Dimick JB |title=Do popular media and internet-based hospital quality ratings identify hospitals with better cardiovascular surgery outcomes? |journal=J.

==Criticism ==
Healthgrades has been criticized for its use of "automatic renewal" subscription charges to customers that purchase reports.<ref name=Brendler>[http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/07/14/online-subscription-auto-renewals-can-cost-you-money/ "Healthgrades.com illustrates risk of losing money with 'auto-renew' subscriptions"], Beau Brendler, [[AOL]] ''DailyFinance News'', July 14, 2010</ref> [[ConsumerAffairs.com]] lists multiple complaints from healthcare providers alleging inaccurate information and from consumers alleging [[credit card]] charges for unwanted subscription services.<ref name=CA>[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/healthgrades.html Consumer Complaints & Reviews: Healthgrades]</ref>

The company discontinued all consumer based credit card solution product offerings during 2011.

HealthGrades board members include Norm Alpert, Joel Liffman, Marc Mazur, and Dan O'connell
