'''Albertus Dominicus Marcellinus Erasmus Osterhaus''', [[PhD]] (born 2 June 1948), known as '''Ab Osterhaus''', is a leading [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[virology|virologist]] and [[influenza]] expert. A Professor of Virology at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] since 1993, Osterhaus is known throughout the world for his work on [[SARS]] and [[H5N1]], the pathogen that causes [[avian influenza]]. As the country's foremost virus expert, he frequently appears on Dutch television. He has been criticised for exaggerating the consequences of the [[2009 flu pandemic]] and pushing for extensive measures, even though the Mexican flu is now treated as if it were a common [[flu]]. In September 2009, a controversy arose when it became known Osterhaus has a 9.8% share in ViroClinics B.V, a pharmaceutical company that supposedly benefits from the 34 million vaccines [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Health minister]] [[Ab Klink]] bought based on his advice as government consultant. Osterhaus maintains he did nothing against the law and that he does not personally benefit from the order.

==Life==
Osterhaus was born into a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] family of seven and grew up in Slotermeer, [[Amsterdam]]. From 1967 onwards he studied [[veterinary medicine]] at [[Utrecht University]] and graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1974. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in 1978 at the same university for a dissertation entitled "Feline infectious peritonitis: identification, propagation and epidemiology".

He fulfilled several positions in his 16-year career at the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] (RIVM) in [[Bilthoven]], the last of which was head of the laboratory for [[Immunobiology]]. During that period he was also a [[part-time]] Professor of Environmental Virology at the Institute for Virology in Utrecht, a position he still holds as of 2009. In 1993 he became Professor of Virology at the Medical Faculty of [[Erasmus University]] and also head of the Department of Virology at [[Erasmus MC|Erasmus University Medical Centre Rotterdam]].

Osterhaus played an important role in the identification of the [[SARS coronavirus]]. In February 2004, his team found that ''Pegylated interferon alpha'', a drug used for the treatment of patients with [[Hepatitis C]], helps combat the virus that causes [[SARS]]. The results were published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in March 2004. On 2 January 2008 an article appeared in ''[[PLoS ONE]]'' describing a new vaccine for [[H5N1 virus]], developed by Rotterdam pharmaceutical company ViroClinics B.V., a spin-out company of the Erasmus MC where Osterhaus works as scientific advisor.

Professor Osterhaus holds various editorial positions for scientific journals, holds several patents, has been supervisor of more than 35 PhD students and has identified more than a dozen “new” viral pathogens<ref name="eswi">{{cite web|url=http://www.eswi.org/who-are-we/eswis-people/dr-albert-osterhaus|publisher=ESWI|title=Dr. Albert Osterhaus|accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref> and he is author of more than 700 scientific papers, including more than fifty in world-class international journals like ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]''.<ref name="vk">{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1146221.ece/De_David_Beckham_van_de_virologie|publisher=[[De Volkskrant]]|title=De David Beckham van de virologie|language=Dutch|date=2009-02-10|first=Broer|last=Scholtens}}</ref>
Dr Osterhaus served as member and chairman of many international scientific committees, most notably four WHO reference centres, the Dutch Influenza Centre, the Dutch Health Council and the European Scientific Working group on Influenza (ESWI). He is also a member of Royal Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW).

==Awards and recognition==
Professor Osterhaus has been named one of the most important virologists in the world. New Zealand influenza expert [[Robert Webster (virologist)|Robert Webster]] described him as "outstanding" and [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]] Professor John Oxford called him "a superstar, absolutely the best". His PhD supervisor Marian Horzinek described his doctoral student as one of the world's most successful virologists with untameable and admirable enthusiasm.<ref name="vk"/>

Osterhaus received many awards in his life, including the prestigious "[[M.W. Beijerinck]] Virology Award", a prize awarded [[triennially]] by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knaw.nl/cfdata/prijzen/prijzen_detail.cfm?orgid=18|publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|language=Dutch|title=M.W.

He shared the € 750.000 prize money with [[National Institute for Medical Research]] Professor John J.

==Criticism==
Osterhaus has been criticised for what has been described as a 'fear campaign', calling for far-reaching measures to combat the [[Mexican flu]].
Physician and microbiologist Miquel Ekkelenkamp called Osterhaus a 'scaremonger' in an opinion piece in ''[[nrc.next]]'' and said: "'Expert' Osterhaus should be banned indefinitely from television. Everything he claimed turned out to be untrue: we're not all going to die like we did in 1918, not everyone needs a vaccination, we are not going to give [[Tamiflu]] to everyone and the virus has not mutated into something much more dangerous."<ref name="miquel">{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmusmagazine.nl/nieuws/detail/article/1716|publisher=Erasmus Magazine|date=2009-09-29|accessdate=2009-10-02|language=Dutch|title='Ab Osterhaus is paniekzaaier'}}</ref> Osterhaus claimed he has not exaggerated the risks. During debate 'De Kwestie live' he said "I have named a wide spectrum of possibilities and minister Ab Klink decided to go for the [[worst-case scenario]]" <ref name="miquel"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmusmagazine.nl/nieuws/detail/article/1696|title=Overheid moet internet slimmer inzetten bij vaccinatie-campagne|accessdate=2009-10-02|language=Dutch|publisher=Erasmus Magazine|date=2009-09-25}}</ref>
