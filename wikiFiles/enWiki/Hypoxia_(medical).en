'''Hypoxia''', or '''hypoxiation''', is a [[Pathology|pathological]] condition in which the body as a whole ('''generalized hypoxia''') or a region of the body ('''tissue hypoxia''', or less commonly '''regional hypoxia''') is deprived of adequate [[oxygen]] supply. Variations in arterial oxygen concentrations can be part of the normal physiology, for example, during strenuous physical exercise. A mismatch between oxygen supply and its demand at the cellular level may result in a hypoxic condition. Hypoxia in which there is complete deprivation of oxygen supply is referred to as '''anoxia'''.

Hypoxia differs from [[hypoxemia]] in that, in the latter, the oxygen concentration within the arterial blood is abnormally low.<ref>{{cite book |last=West |first=John B. |title=Pulmonary Pathophysiology: The Essentials |year=1977 |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |pages=22 |isbn=0-683-08936-6}}</ref> It is possible to experience hypoxia and have a low oxygen content (e.g., due to anemia) but maintain high oxygen partial pressure (p{{chem|O|2}}). Incorrect use of these terms can easily lead to confusion, especially as hypoxemia is among the causes of hypoxia (in [[hypoxemic hypoxia]]).

Generalized hypoxia occurs in healthy people when they ascend to [[high altitude]], where it causes [[altitude sickness]] leading to potentially fatal complications: [[high altitude pulmonary edema]] ([[HAPE]]) and [[high altitude cerebral edema]] ([[HACE]]).<ref name=MedicalProblems>{{cite journal |author=Cymerman, A; Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments. A Handbook for Medical Officers |publisher=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |volume=USARIEM-TN94-2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7976 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref>  Hypoxia also occurs in healthy individuals when breathing mixtures of gases with a low oxygen content, e.g. while diving underwater especially when using closed-circuit [[rebreather]] systems that control the amount of oxygen in the supplied air.  A mild and non-damaging intermittent hypoxia is used intentionally during [[altitude training]]s to develop an athletic performance adaptation at both the systemic and cellular level.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gore CJ, Clark SA, Saunders PU |title=Nonhematological mechanisms of improved sea-level performance after hypoxic exposure |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1600–9 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17805094 |doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e3180de49d3 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0195-9131&volume=39&issue=9&spage=1600}}</ref>

Hypoxia is also a serious consequence of [[preterm birth]] in the neonate. The main cause for this is that the lungs of the human fetus are among the last organs to develop during pregnancy. To assist the lungs to distribute oxygenated blood throughout the body, infants at risk of hypoxia are often placed inside an incubator capable of providing [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (also known as a humidicrib).

In humans, hypoxia is detected by chemoreceptors in the [[carotid body]]. This response does not control ventilation rate at normal p{{chem|O|2}}, but below normal the activity of neurons innervating these receptors increases dramatically, so much so to override the signals from central chemoreceptors in the [[hypothalamus]], increasing p{{chem|O|2}} despite a falling p{{CO2}}

==Classification==
*'''Hypoxemic hypoxia''' is a state of oxygen deficiency in which the arterial ''content'' of oxygen is low because the arterial partial pressure of oxygen is low. Hypoxemic hypoxia may be due to:<ref> {{cite book |last=West |first=John B. |title=Respiratory Physiology: The Essentials |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=La Jolla |year=2008 |pages=88–89 |edition=8th}}</ref>
** [[Hypoventilation]]. Inadequate pulmonary minute ventilation (e.g., [[respiratory failure|respiratory arrest]] or by drugs such as [[opiates]])
** [[Shunt (medical)|Shunts]] in the pulmonary circulation or a right-to-left shunt in the heart.  Shunts can be caused by collapsed [[alveoli]] that are still perfused or a block in ventilation to an area of the lung. Whatever the mechanism, blood meant for the pulmonary system is not ventilated and so no gas exchange occurs (the ventilation/perfusion ratio is decreased).
***Normal anatomical shunt occur due to [[Smallest cardiac veins|Thebesian veins]] which empty into the left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and the bronchial circulation which supplies the [[bronchi]] with oxygen.
*** Normal physiological shunts occur due to the effect of gravity. The highest concentration of blood in the pulmonary circulation occurs in the bases of the pulmonary tree compared to the highest pressure of gas in the apices of the lungs.
** [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio|V/Q mismatch]]. When the ventilation does not match the perfusion through the paranchyema of the lung. This can occur for a variety of reasons, the commonest being a [[Pulmonary embolism]]
** Diffusing defects such as pulmonary fibrosis where the [[Alveolar-arterial gradient|Aa gradient]] has increased.
** Decreased concentration of oxygen in inspired air. Low [[partial pressure]] of [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] oxygen such as found at high altitude<ref name="02_calc">{{cite web | author=Kenneth Baillie and Alistair Simpson | title=Altitude oxygen calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/oxygen_levels.php | publisher= Apex (Altitude Physiology Expeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10}} – Online interactive oxygen delivery calculator.</ref> or by reduced replacement of oxygen in the breathing mix.
***Low partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs when switching from inhaled [[anesthesia]] to atmospheric air, due to the [[Fink effect]], or diffusion hypoxia.
*'''Anemic hypoxia''' is a state in which the arterial partial pressure of oxygen is normal, but total oxygen content of the blood is reduced due to a decreased ability for hemoglobin to carry oxygen.
**Anemic hypoxia occurs in chronic anemia and carbon monoxide poisoning.
*'''Ischemic hypoxia''' occurs when there is decreased blood flow.
** Ischemic hypoxia can occur in heart failure and vasodilatory shock.
*'''Histotoxic hypoxia''' in which quantity of oxygen reaching the cells is normal, but the cells are unable to use the oxygen effectively, due to disabled oxidative phosphorylation enzymes. [[Cyanide poisoning|Cyanide toxicity]] is one example.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of generalized hypoxia depend on its severity and acceleration of onset. In the case of [[altitude sickness]], where hypoxia develops gradually, the symptoms include [[headache]]s, fatigue, shortness of breath, a feeling of euphoria and [[nausea]]. In severe hypoxia, or hypoxia of very rapid onset, changes in levels of consciousness, [[seizure]]s, [[coma]], [[priapism]], and death occur. Severe hypoxia induces a blue discoloration of the skin, called [[cyanosis]]. Because [[haemoglobin]] is a darker red when it is not bound to oxygen ([[deoxyhaemoglobin]]), as opposed to the rich red color that it has when bound to oxygen ([[oxyhaemoglobin]]), when seen through the skin it has an increased tendency to reflect blue light back to the eye. In cases where the oxygen is displaced by another molecule, such as carbon monoxide, the skin may appear 'cherry red' instead of cyanotic.

==Pathophysiology==
After mixing with water vapor and expired {{chem|link=Carbon dioxide|CO|2}} in the lungs, oxygen diffuses down a pressure gradient to enter [[artery|arterial]] blood where its partial pressure is around 100&nbsp;mmHg (13.3&nbsp;kPa).<ref name="02_calc"/> Arterial blood flow delivers oxygen to the peripheral tissues, where it again diffuses down a pressure gradient into the cells and into their [[mitochondria]]. These bacteria-like [[cytoplasm]]ic structures strip [[hydrogen]] from fuels ([[glucose]], [[fat]]s and some [[amino acid]]s) to burn with oxygen to form [[water]].  The fuel's carbon is oxidized to {{CO2}}, which diffuses down its partial pressure gradient out of the cells into venous blood to be exhaled finally by the lungs.  Experimentally, oxygen diffusion becomes rate limiting (and lethal) when arterial oxygen partial pressure falls to 40&nbsp;mmHg (5.3&nbsp;kPa) or below.

If oxygen delivery to cells is insufficient for the demand (hypoxia), hydrogen will be shifted to [[pyruvic acid]] converting it to [[lactic acid]].  This temporary measure (anaerobic metabolism) allows small amounts of energy to be released.  Lactic acid build up (in tissues and blood) is a sign of inadequate mitochondrial oxygenation, which may be due to hypoxemia, poor blood flow (e.g., shock) or a combination of both.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hobler |first=K.E. |coauthors=L.C. Carey | title=Effect of acute progressive hypoxemia on cardiac output and plasma excess lactate | journal=Ann Surg | year=1973 | pages=199–202 | volume=177 | issue=2 | pmid= 4572785 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-197302000-00013 | pmc=1355564}}</ref>  If severe or prolonged it could lead to cell death.

===Vasoconstriction and vasodilation===
In most tissues of the body, the response to hypoxia is [[vasodilation]]. By widening the blood vessels, the tissue allows greater perfusion.

By contrast, in the [[lungs]], the response to hypoxia is [[vasoconstriction]]. This is known as "[[Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]]", or "HPV".

==Treatment==
To counter the effects of high-altitude diseases, the body must return arterial p{{chem|O|2}} toward normal. [[Acclimatization]], the means by which the body adapts to higher altitudes, only partially restores p{{chem|O|2}} to standard levels. [[Hyperventilation]], the body’s most common response to high-altitude conditions, increases alveolar p{{chem|O|2}} by raising the depth and rate of breathing. However, while p{{chem|O|2}} does improve with hyperventilation, it does not return to normal. Studies of miners and astronomers working at 3000 meters and above show improved alveolar p{{chem|O|2}} with full acclimatization, yet the p{{chem|O|2}} level remains equal to or even below the threshold for continuous oxygen therapy for patients with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).<ref name="West 2004 789–800">{{cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=2004 |title=The Physiologic Basis of High-Altitude Diseases |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=141 |pages=789–800 |issue=10 |pmid=15545679 |author2=American College Of Physicians |author3=American Physiological Society}}</ref> In addition, there are complications involved with acclimatization. [[Polycythemia]], in which the body increases the number of red blood cells in circulation, thickens the blood, raising the danger that the heart can’t pump it.

In high-altitude conditions, only oxygen enrichment can counteract the effects of hypoxia. By increasing the concentration of oxygen in the air, the effects of lower barometric pressure are countered and the level of arterial p{{chem|O|2}} is restored toward normal capacity. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At 4000 m, raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 percent via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an altitude equivalent of 3000 m, which is much more tolerable for the increasing number of low-landers who work in high altitude.<ref>{{cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=1995 |title=Oxygen Enrichment of Room Air to Relieve the Hypoxia of High Altitude |journal=Respiration Physiology |volume=99 |pages=225–32 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(94)00094-G |issue=2 |pmid=7777705}}</ref> In a study of astronomers working in Chile at 5050 m, oxygen concentrators increased the level of oxygen concentration by almost 30 percent (that is, from 21 percent to 27 percent). This resulted in increased worker productivity, less fatigue, and improved sleep.<ref name="West 2004 789–800"/>

[[Oxygen concentrator]]s are uniquely suited for this purpose. They require little maintenance and electricity, provide a constant source of oxygen, and eliminate the expensive, and often dangerous, task of transporting oxygen cylinders to remote areas. Offices and housing already have climate-controlled rooms, in which temperature and humidity are kept at a constant level. Oxygen can be added to this system easily and relatively cheaply.
