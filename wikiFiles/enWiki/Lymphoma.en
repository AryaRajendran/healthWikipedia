'''Lymphoma''' is a type of [[blood cancer]] that occurs when [[B cell|B]] or [[T cell|T]] [[lymphocyte]]s,<ref>{{cite web|last=Medical News Today|title=What is lymphoma?|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146136.php{{!}}|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> the [[white blood cell]]s that form a part of the [[immune system]] and help protect the body from [[infection]] and [[disease]], begin behaving abnormally. Abnormal lymphocytes may divide faster than normal cells or they may live longer than they are supposed to. Lymphoma may develop in many parts of the body, including the [[lymph nodes]], [[spleen]], [[bone marrow]], blood or other organs<ref name=lymphoma.org>{{cite web|title=About Lymphoma|url=http://www.lymphoma.org/site/pp.asp?c=bkLTKaOQLmK8E&b=6299689|publisher=Lymphoma Research Foundation|accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref> and eventually they form a mass of cells called a tumor. Tumors grow and invade the space of surrounding tissues and organs, depriving them of oxygen and nutrients.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical News Today|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146136.php|work=What is Lymphoma?|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>   

Typically, lymphoma presents as a solid [[tumor]] of lymphoid cells. Treatment might involve [[chemotherapy]] and in some cases [[radiotherapy]] and/or [[bone marrow transplantation]], and can be curable depending on the [[histology]], type, and stage of the disease.<ref name="isbn0-8153-4093-1">{{cite book |author=Parham, Peter |title=The immune system |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2005 |page=414 |isbn=0-8153-4093-1 }}</ref> These malignant cells often originate in [[lymph node]]s, presenting as an enlargement of the node (a tumor). It can also affect other organs in which case it is referred to as extranodal lymphoma. Extranodal sites include the skin, brain, bowels and bone. Lymphomas are closely related to [[lymphoid leukemia]]s, which also originate in lymphocytes but typically involve only circulating blood and the [[bone marrow]] (where blood cells are generated in a process termed [[haematopoesis]]) and do not usually form static tumors.<ref name="isbn0-8153-4093-1" /> There are many types of lymphomas, and in turn, lymphomas are a part of the broad group of diseases called [[Hematological malignancy|hematological neoplasms]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Lymphoma presents with certain non-specific symptoms. If symptoms are persistent, lymphoma needs to be excluded medically.
*[[Lymphadenopathy]]<ref name=lymphoma.org/><ref name=lymphoma.about.com/> or swelling of lymph nodes - It is the primary presentation in lymphoma.
*[[B symptoms]] - Can be associated with both Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It consists of:
**[[Fever of unknown origin|Fever]]<ref name=lymphoma.org/><ref name=lymphoma.about.com/>
**[[Night sweats]]<ref name=lymphoma.org/><ref name=lymphoma.about.com/>

[[Immunophenotyping]] plays a major role in diagnosis. [[Histopathology|Histopathological]] findings of the various types of lymphoma are given in the table in the next section.
A number of various classification systems exist for lymphoma.
As an alternative to the American Lakes-Butler classification, in the early 1970s, Karl Lennert of [[Kiel]], Germany, proposed a new system of classifying lymphomas based on cellular [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and their relationship to cells of the normal peripheral lymphoid system.<ref name="isbn3-540-63801-6">{{cite book |first1=Alfred C. |last1=Feller |first2=Jacques |last2=Diebold |title=Histopathology of Nodal and Extranodal Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VdCebhgHaEsC |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-63801-8 |edition=3rd}}</ref>

Some forms of lymphoma are categorized as indolent (e.g. [[small lymphocytic lymphoma]]), compatible with a long life even without treatment, whereas other forms are aggressive (e.g. [[Burkitt's lymphoma]]), causing rapid deterioration and death.  However, most of the aggressive lymphomas respond well to treatment and are curable. The [[prognosis]] therefore depends on the correct diagnosis and classification of the disease, which is established after examination of a [[biopsy]] by a [[pathology|pathologist]] (usually a [[hematopathology|hematopathologist]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Wagman LD. |chapter=Principles of Surgical Oncology |chapterurl=http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter01/article/10165/1399286 |editor=Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ |title=Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach |publisher=CMPMedica |year=2008 |isbn=9781891483622 |edition=11th |url=http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/}}</ref>

==Classification==
[[Thomas Hodgkin]] published the first description of lymphoma in 1832, specifically of the form named after him, Hodgkin's lymphoma.<ref name="Mauch1999">{{cite book | last = Hellman | first = Samuel | coauthors = Mauch, P.M. Ed. | title = Hodgkin's Disease | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year = 1999 | location = Chapter 1 | page = 5 | isbn = 0-7817-1502-4}}</ref> Since then, many other forms of lymphoma have been described, grouped under several proposed classifications. The 1982 [[Working formulation]] became very popular. It introduced the category non-Hodgkin lymphoma, divided into 16 different diseases. However, because these different lymphomas have little in common with each other, the NHL label is of limited usefulness for doctors or patients and is slowly being abandoned. The latest classification by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] (2008) lists 70 different forms of lymphoma divided in four broad groups.<ref name=Swerdlow08>{{cite book |first1=Steven H. |last1=Swerdlow |author2=International Agency for Research on Cancer |author3=World Health Organization |title=WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues |url=http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&codcol=70&codcch=4002 |year=2008 |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer |edition=4th | volume=2 |series=World Health Organization classification of tumours |isbn=9789283224310}}</ref>

The two main types of lymphomas:<ref name=lymphoma.org/>
* [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] (HL) — There are six types of HL, an uncommon form of lymphoma that involves the [[Reed–Sternberg cell]]s.

Hodgkin’s disease has a bimodal distribution, occurring most commonly at ages 15–34 years and above 50 years. It is generally asymptomatic and presents with painless lymphadenopathy, usually in the cervical region. There are four main histological subtypes of Hodgkin’s: lymphocyte predominant, mixed cellularity, nodular sclerotic and lymphocyte depleted. Nodular sclerotic Hodgkin’s occurs most commonly in young adult patients. Staging of Hodgkin’s is based on the [[Ann Arbor staging|Ann Arbor classification]], which is defined by lymph node involvement above and below the diaphragm and the presence of [[B symptoms]] (fever, night sweats or unexplained weight loss). Overall 10-year prognosis is good, but the presence of B symptoms is associated with adverse outcome.

* [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (NHL) — There are more than 61 types of NHL, some of which are more common than others.  Any lymphoma that does not involve Reed-Sternberg cells is classified as non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Although older classifications referred to histiocytic lymphomas, these are recognized in newer classifications as of [[B cell|B]], [[T cell|T]] or [[NK cell]] lineage. True [[histiocyte|histiocytic]] malignancies are rare and are classified as [[sarcoma]]s.<ref name = "isbn92-832-2411-6"/>

===Working formulation===
{{Main|Working Formulation}}
The 1996 [[Working Formulation]] is a classification of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].  It excluded the Hodgkin lymphomas and divided the remaining lymphomas into four grades (Low, Intermediate, High, and Miscellaneous) related to prognosis, with some further subdivisions based on the size and shape of affected cells.  This purely histological classification included no information about [[cell surface markers]], or genetics, and it made no distinction between [[T-cell lymphoma]]s or [[B-cell lymphoma]]s.

It was widely accepted at the time of its publication but is now obsolete.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clarke CA, Glaser SL, Dorfman and Dorfwoman RF, Bracci PM, Eberle E, Holly EA |title=Expert review of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in a population-based cancer registry: reliability of diagnosis and subtype classifications |journal=Cancer Epidemiol. Bio-markers Prev. |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=138–43 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14744745 |doi= 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-03-0250|url=}}</ref> It was superseded by subsequent classifications (see below) but it is still used by cancer agencies for compilation of lymphoma statistics and historical rate comparisons.

===REAL===
In the mid 1990s,the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) Classification attempted to apply immunophenotypic and genetic features in identifying distinct clinicopathologic entities among all the lymphomas except [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|203399|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma}}</ref>  REAL has been superseded by the WHO classification.

•B-cell neoplasms
–precursor
–mature
•T-cell neoplasms 
–precursor

•Hodgkin lymphoma
•Non-HodgkinLymphomas

===World Health Organization===
The WHO Classification, published in 2001 and updated in 2008,<ref name=Swerdlow08/><ref name="isbn92-832-2411-6">{{cite book |first=Elaine Sarkin |last=Jaffe |title=Pathology & Genetics: Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XSKqcy7TUZUC |year=2001 |publisher=IARC |isbn=978-92-832-2411-2 |series=WHO classification of tumours, pathology and genetics series |volume=3}}</ref> is the latest classification of lymphoma and is based upon the foundations laid within the "Revised European-American Lymphoma classification" (REAL). This system attempts to group lymphomas by cell type (i.e. the normal cell type that most resembles the tumor) and defining [[phenotypic]], [[molecular]] or [[cytogenetic]]characteristics. There are three large groups: the [[B cell]], [[T cell]], and [[natural killer cell]] tumors. Other less common groups, are also recognized. Hodgkin lymphoma, although considered separately within the [[World Health Organization]] (and preceding) classifications, is now recognized as being a tumor of, albeit markedly abnormal, lymphocytes of mature B cell lineage.

Lymphoma is the most common form of [[hematological malignancy]], or "blood cancer", in the developed world.

Taken together, lymphomas represent 5.3% of all cancers (excluding simple basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers) in the United States and 55.6% of all blood cancers.<ref>{{cite web |title=SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975–2006

According to the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]], lymphomas account for about five percent of all cases of cancer in the United States, and Hodgkin's lymphoma in particular accounts for less than one percent of all cases of cancer in the United States.

Because the whole system is part of the body's immune system, patients with a weakened immune system such as from HIV infection or from certain drugs or medication also have a higher incidence of lymphoma.

==Research directions==
Significant research into the causes, prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of lymphoma is being performed. Hundreds of [[clinical trials]] are being planned or conducted at any given time.<ref>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=lymphoma</ref> Studies may focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, improving the quality of life for patients, or appropriate care in remission or after cures.

In general, there are two types of lymphoma research: clinical or [[translational research]] and [[basic research]]. Clinical/translational research focuses on studying the disease in a defined and generally immediately patient-applicable way, such as testing a new drug in patients.  By contrast, basic science research studies the disease process at a distance, such as seeing whether a suspected carcinogen can cause healthy cells to turn into lymphoma cells in the laboratory or how the DNA changes inside lymphoma cells as the disease progresses.  The results from basic research studies are generally less immediately useful to patients with the disease.<ref>{{cite web|first=The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society|title=Understanding Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers|url=http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1162487596.pdf|publisher=Leukemia and Lymphoma Society|accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>
