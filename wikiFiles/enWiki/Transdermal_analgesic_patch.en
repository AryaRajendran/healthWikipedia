A '''transdermal analgesic''' or '''pain relief patch''' is a [[Transdermal patch|medicated adhesive patch]] used to relieve minor to severe [[pain]]. There are two primary types of analgesic patches: patches containing [[counterirritant]]s, which are used to treat mild to moderate pain, and patches containing [[fentanyl]], a narcotic used to relieve moderate to severe pain in opioid-tolerant patients.

==Counterirritant patches==

Counterirritant patches contain ingredients such as [[capsaicin]], [[methyl salicylate]], [[camphor]], or [[menthol]], which are thought to mask pain signals by causing other sensations (itching, warmth, or cooling) in the areas they are applied to.<ref name=USPharm>{{cite web |last=Pray |first=W.

Other products, including brand names such as [[Ben Gay]] and [[Mentholatum]], which are not covered by NDA, indicate relief of minor pain.<ref name=USPharm/> Counterirritant patches are sold over the counter and do not require a prescription. Other over-the-counter products marketed for the relief of minor injury or arthritis pain include Absorbine Jr. Pain Relief, Excedrin Cooling Pads, and Icy Hot Patches.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Levy |first=Sandra  |title=External painkillers lead sales in analgesics market |journal=Drug Topics |date=10 December 2001 |url=http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drugtopics/Pain+Management/External-painkillers-lead-sales-in-analgesics-mark/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/118028?contextCategoryId=6962 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> 

In [[Japan]] Salonpas, produced by [[Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical]], remains a popular brand. Other manufacturers, including Yutoku Pharmaceutical, SS Pharmaceutical, and Suzuki Nippondo also produce similar over-the-counter patches containing methyl salicylate or glycol salicylate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ghosh |first=Tapash K. |coauthors=William R.

==Fentanyl patches==
{{Main|Fentanyl|Duragesic}}
Fentanyl transdermal patches are sold under the brand name Duragesic, or as [[Generic drug|generic]] equivalents. Fentanyl is an [[opioid]] with rapid onset of pain relief; it is often used to treat [[Pain#Breakthrough_pain|breakthrough pain]]. Duragesic and similar patches release fentanyl through the skin. A patch may provide pain relief for up to 72 hours.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Several deaths or life-threatening overdoses have been linked to misuse of fentanyl patches.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web |author=US Department of Health and Human Services |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Fentanyl Transdermal System (marketed as Duragesic and generics) |work=US Food and Drug Administration Postmarket Drug Safety Information for Patients and Providers |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm084307.htm |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> Fentanyl patches are indicated only for patients with moderate to severe chronic pain who have been taking regular narcotic pain medication for more than a week and who are considered opioid-tolerant. Overdose can occur when patients use more patches than prescribed, change the patches too frequently, or expose the patch to heat.<ref name=FDA/>
