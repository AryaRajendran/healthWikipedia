==Presentation==
The hair is normal in quantity and is usually silvery-[[blond]] or straw-colored. It is disorderly, it stands out from the scalp, and cannot be combed flat. The underlying structural anomaly is longitudinal grooving of the hair shaft, which appears triangular in cross section. There usually is no family history, though the characteristic hair shaft anomaly can be demonstrated in asymptomatic family members by scanning electron microscopy. To be noticeable, 50% of hairs must be affected by the structural abnormality. Improvement often occurs in later childhood.<ref name=ORPHA>{{cite web| title=Uncombable hair syndrome |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert=1410 |publisher=Orphanet|accessdate=1 Septerber 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Trüeb |first=Ralph |title=Uncombable hair syndrome |url=http://www.orpha.net/data/patho/GB/uk-uncombable.pdf |date=September 2003 |publisher=Orphanet Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 Septermber 2012}}</ref> An [[autosomal dominant]] mode of inheritance has been suggested though an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern with varying degrees of [[penetrance]] has also been noted.<ref name=NCBI /><ref name=ORPHA /> The stiffness of the uncombable hair has been reasoned to be due to the triangular form of the hair shaft in cross section. It has been suggested that the condition may result from premature keratinization of the inner root sheath.<ref name=ORPHA />

==History==
A possible case of uncombable hair syndrome was reported in 1912 by A.F. Le Double and F. Houssay.<ref name=Calderon /> The syndrome was described in 1973 by A. Dupré, P. Rochiccioli and J.L. Bonafé, who named it "cheveux incoiffables".<ref name=Calderon /> Later that year it was independently described as "spun-glass hair" by J.D. Stroud and A.H. Mehregan.<ref name=Calderon/> The famous term was coined in the early eighties.

==Similar conditions==
Other syndromes with hair abnormalities may also show features of uncombable hair syndrome such as [[Rapp–Hodgkin ectodermal dysplasia syndrome]], [[loose anagen syndrome]], [[EEC syndrome]] ([[ectodermal dysplasia]], [[ectrodatyly]] and [[cleft lip/palate]]) and familial tricho-odonto-onychial ectodermal dysplasia with [[syndactyly]]. However unlike these conditions, uncombable hair syndrome alone is not associated with physical, neurologic, or mental abnormalities.<ref name=NCBI />
