A '''nabothian cyst''' (or '''nabothian follicle''')<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:nabothian follicles">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/three/000041439.htm#000041439 |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:nabothian follicles |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> is a mucus-filled cyst on the surface of the [[cervix]]. They are most often caused when [[stratified squamous epithelium]] of the ectocervix (toward the vagina) grows over the [[simple columnar epithelium]] of the endocervix (toward the uterus).  This tissue growth can block the cervical crypts (subdermal pockets usually 2-10&nbsp;mm in diameter), trapping cervical mucus inside the crypts.  The transformation of tissue types is called [[metaplasia]].

==Presentation==
Nabothian cysts appear most often as firm bumps on the cervix's surface<ref>[http://www.medicotips.com/2010/11/nabothian-cyst-cause-appearance.html Nabothian Cysts appear as bumps on cervix]</ref>.  A woman may notice the cyst when inserting a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] or [[cervical cap]], or when checking the cervix as part of [[fertility awareness]].<!--

==Prognosis, treatment, and associated conditions==
Nabothian cysts are considered harmless and usually disappear on their own,<ref name="tcoyf" /> although some will persist indefinitely.{{fact|date=June 2008}}  Some women notice they appear and disappear in relation to their [[menstrual cycle]].  If a woman is not sure the anomaly she has found on her cervix is a nabothian cyst, a visit to a doctor is recommended to rule out other conditions.<ref name="tcoyf" /> 

Rarely, nabothian cysts have a correlation with chronic cervicitis, an inflammatory infection of the cervix.

Nabothian cysts are not considered problematic unless they grow very large and present secondary symptoms. A [[physician]] may wish to perform a [[colposcopy]] or [[biopsy]] on a nabothian cyst to check for [[cancer]] or other problems. Two methods for removing these cysts include [[electrocautery]] and [[cryofreezing]], although new cysts may form after the procedure.

==Eponym==
Nabothian cysts are also known as nabothian follicles, mucinous retention cysts, or epithelial inclusion cysts. They are named after German [[anatomist]] Martin Naboth (1675-1721), who wrote about them in a 1707 treatise titled ''De sterilitate mulierum''. However, they were earlier described by French [[surgeon]] Guillaume Desnoues (1650-1735).<!--
