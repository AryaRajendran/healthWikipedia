'''Ototoxicity''' is damage to the [[ear]] (''oto-''), specifically the [[cochlea]] or [[vestibulocochlear nerve|auditory nerve]] and sometimes the [[vestibular system]], by a [[toxin]]. It is commonly medication-induced; ototoxic drugs include [[antibiotic]]s such as the [[aminoglycoside]] [[gentamicin]], [[loop diuretic]]s such as [[furosemide]], and [[platinum]]-based [[chemotherapy]] agents such as [[cisplatin]]. A number of [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDS) have also been shown to be ototoxic. This can result in [[sensorineural hearing loss]], [[dysequilibrium]], or both. Either may be reversible and temporary, or irreversible and permanent.

The [[vinca alkaloid]]s, including [[vincristine]], are also associated with reversible ototoxicity.<ref name="ototoxicity"/>

The erectile dysfunction medications Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis have also been reported to cause hearing loss.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm</ref>

===Mixed Exposures===
Ototoxic chemicals interact with mechanical stresses on the hair cells of the cochlea in different ways.   For organic solvents such as Toluene, styrene or xylene, the combined exposure with noise increases the risk of hearing loss in a synergistic manner <ref>Fechter L.D. "Promotion of noise-induced hearing loss by chemical contaminants," J. Tox. Env. Health Part A. 67:727-740 (2004)</ref>  Heavy metals, asphyxiants and endocrine disruptors have a variety of interactions as well.  Specific toxicity limits for combined exposures are not well established. However, given the potential for enhanced risk of hearing loss, the noise exposures should be kept below 85 decibels and the chemical exposures should be below the recommended exposure limits given by agencies such as OSHA, NIOSH, or ACGIH.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of ototoxicity include partial or profound [[Hearing impairment|hearing loss]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and [[tinnitus]].<ref name="ototoxicity"/>

Ototoxicity is the result of the inner ear being poisoned by a medication which subsequently causes damage to the cochlea, vestibule, semi-circular canals, or auditory/ vestibulocochlear nerve. The structure afflicted with Ototoxicity also affects the symptoms the patient presents with.
The cochlea is primarily a hearing structure. Within the inner ear, it is the snail shaped shell that contains several nerve endings and makes hearing possible.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ototoxicity|work=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|title=ototoxicity}}</ref> When a patient develops ototoxicity in the cochlea, they experience hearing loss that can range from loss of the high frequency pitch ranges to complete deafness.<ref name=Mudd>{{cite web|last=Mudd|first=Pamela|title=Ototoxicity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/857679-overview|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=30 Nov. 11}}</ref>  Ototoxicity most commonly presents itself with bilaterally symmetrical symptoms, but if the symptoms do present asymmetrically, it is possible the other ear will develop the condition at a later time.<ref name=Mudd/> The time frame in which the patient experiences hearing loss remains debatable as the symptoms which patients suffer vary greatly. In many instances, symptoms are temporary; however, there are many cases in which the hearing loss is permanent.<ref name=Farlex/> The cochlea can also develop tinnitus from ototoxicity, causing a ringing sound in the ears which only the patient can hear. 

The vestibule and semi-circular canal are inner-ear components which comprise the vestibular system, another area of the ear affected by ototoxicity. Due to the difference in the function of these structures, ototoxic poisoning affects the patient differently than in the case of cochlear damage. The vestibule is where the two types of otolith organs are housed: the saccule, which points vertically and detects vertical acceleration, and the utricle, which points horizontally and detects horizontal acceleration. The otolith organs detect the head’s position with respect to gravity when the body is static, the head’s movement in an angular or tilted direction, and pitch changes during any linear motion of the head. The saccule and utricle work together to detect different motions that the brain later integrates to correctly determine exactly where the head is and how and where it is moving. 

The vestibule and the semi-circular canals work together to detect all forms of head movement. The semi-circular canals are three bony structures that are filled with fluid. Just as the vestibule, the primary purpose of the canals is to detect movement. Each canal is oriented independently at right angles from the others, enabling detection of movement in any plane. The posterior canal detects rolling motion, or motion about the X axis; the anterior canal detects pitch, or motion about the Y axis; the horizontal canal detects yaw motion, or motion about the Z axis. 
When a medication causes an ototoxic reaction in either the vestibule or semi-circular canals, the patient suffers from problems in balance and orientation rather than hearing issues. Symptoms in these organs present as vertigo, difficulties walking at night, and disequilibrium, oscillopsia among other balance related problems.<ref name=Mudd/> Each of these problems is directly related to balance and the mind being confused with the direction of motion or lack of motion. Because both the vestibule and semi-circular canals transmit information to the brain about movement, when these are poisoned, they are unable to function properly which results in miscommunication with the brain. 

When the vestibule and/or semi-circular canals are affected by ototoxicity, the eye can also be affected. Nystagmus and oscillopsia are two conditions that overlap the vestibular and ocular systems. These symptoms cause the patient to have difficulties with seeing and processing images. The body subconsciously tries to compensate for the imbalance signals being sent to the brain by trying to obtain visual cues to support the information it is receiving. This results in that dizziness and “woozy” feeling patients use to describe conditions such as oscillopsia and vertigo.<ref name=Mudd/> 

The auditory/vestibulocochlear nerve, or cranial nerve VIII, is the least afflicted component of the ear when ototoxicity arises, but if the nerve is affected, the damage is most often permanent. Cranial nerve VIII “has a vestibular part which functions in balance, equilibrium, and orientation in three-dimensional space, and a cochlear part which functions in hearing."<ref name=Farr>{{cite web|last=Farr|first=Gary|title=The Cranial Nerves|url=http://www.becomehealthynow.com/article/bodynervousadvanced/812/4/|work=Cranial Nerves|publisher=BecomeHealthyNow.com|accessdate=30 Nov. 11}}</ref>  Despite the vestibular or cochlear structures functioning normally, affliction of the nerve effectively arrests communication between these structures and the brain. Symptoms present similar to those resulting from vestibular and cochlear damage, including tinnitus, ringing of the ears, difficultly walking, deafness, and balance and orientation issues.<ref name=Farr/>

==Treatment==
No specific treatment is available, but immediate withdrawal of the drug may be warranted in cases where the consequences of doing so are less severe than the consequences of the ototoxicity.<ref name="ototoxicity"/>

It is difficult to distinguish between nerve damage and structural damage due to similarity of the symptoms.  Often ototoxicity diagnoses result from ruling out all other possible sources of hearing loss and is the catchall explanation for the sudden problem. Treatment options vary depending on the patient and the diagnosis. Some patients only experience temporary symptoms, which do not require drastic treatment while other patients can be treated with medication. Physical therapy remains particularly useful with regaining balance and walking abilities. Cochlear implants are sometimes an option as well to restore hearing. However, these treatments are more often made in an effort to make the patient as comfortable as possible and to help them cope with the symptoms, not to cure them of the disease or damage caused by ototoxicity. There is no cure or restoration capability if the damage becomes permanent.<ref>{{cite web|last=My Deafness|title=Ototoxicity: Ear Poisoning|url=http://www.mydeafness.com/ototoxicity-ear-poisoning|work=Causes of Deafness and Types of Deafness (Hearing Loss)|publisher=My Deafness|accessdate=30 Nov. 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=VEDA|title=VEDA-VEstibular Disorders Association-Ototoxicity|url=http://www.vestibular.org/vestibular-disorders/specific-disorders/ototoxicity.php|work=VEDA-Vestibular Disorders Association|publisher=VEDA|accessdate=30 Nov. 2011}}</ref>
