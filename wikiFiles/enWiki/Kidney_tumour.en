'''Kidney tumours''' (or '''kidney tumors'''), also known as '''renal tumours''', are [[tumour]]s, or growths, on or in the [[kidney]]. These growths can be [[benign]] or [[malignant]] (cancerous). They may be discovered on [[medical imaging]] incidentally (i.e. an [[incidentaloma]]), or may be present in patients as an abdominal mass, [[hematuria]], [[abdominal pain]], or manifest first in a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]] that seems unrelated to the kidney.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gill IS, Aron M, Gervais DA, Jewett MA |title=Small renal mass |journal=N.

==Classification==
There are many forms of kidney tumours:

===Malignant (cancerous)===
* The most frequent, malignant, primary kidney cancer is '''[[renal cell carcinoma]] (RCC)''' - which has several subtypes:
** Clear cell RCC.
** Papillary RCC
** Chromophobe RCC
** Collecting duct RCC
*Metastatic tumour, e.g. ovarian carcinoma.

===Benign===
*[[Renal oncocytoma]]
*[[Cystic nephroma]]
*[[Angiomyolipoma]]
*[[Metanephric adenoma]]
*[[Renal medullary fibroma]]
