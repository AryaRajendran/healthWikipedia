The '''William P. Didusch Center for Urologic History''' is a museum and the headquarters of the [[American Urological Association]] in [[Linthicum]], [[Maryland]]. It is described as encompassing "a rich and varied collection of drawings, photographs, and instruments of historical importance to [[urology]], many displayed in the urological exhibits during the American Urological Association (AUA) conventions."<ref name=Urologic>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21340591|title=The William P.

==Background==
The center is named in honor of [[William Didusch]], the museum's founder and first curator. Didusch was a notable [[Scientific illustration|scientific illustrator]],<ref name="Faulk2012">{{cite book|last=Faulk|first=Richard|title=Gross America: Your Coast-to-Coast Guide to All Things Gross|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CjFqrxzahEUC&pg=PT159|accessdate=27 October 2012|date=11 October 2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-60133-4|pages=159–}}</ref> and Executive Secretary of the AUA.<ref name="National1968">{{cite book|author=National Academy of Sciences (U.S.)|title=Scientific and technical societies of the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pS8rAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA71|accessdate=27 October 2012|year=1968|publisher=National Academies|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=71–|id=NAP:00039}}</ref> Didusch had begun working at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1915 as an illustrator and eventually a lecturer.<ref name="Lake2006"/> Didusch was an artist but more committed to the drawing of illustrations, rather than paintings, of anatomy. As result he became a legend during his time after his work in John Hopkins Hospital. Some of his many illustrations were those of the anatomy of the urinary tract and instruments used to treat the urinary diseases.<ref name="Lake2006">{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Matt|title=Weird Maryland|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L0iv57e2mXEC&pg=PA136|accessdate=27 October 2012|date=25 July 2006|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-3906-4|pages=136–}}</ref>  The museum was formally established in 1971 as the William P. Didusch Museum, following Didusch's gift to the American Urological Association of his many original urological drawings. It was accommodated within the headquarters buildings of the AUA, then on Charles Street in Baltimore.<ref name=Urologic/> Didusch curated the museum until his death in 1981, when he was succeeded by Herbert Brendler. After Brendler's death in 1986, William W. Scott (a colleague of [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Charles Huggins]] at the [[University of Chicago]]) became curator of the museum. When Scott retired in 1993, the post of curator went to Rainer Engel of Johns Hopkins.<ref name="History">{{Cite web|url=http://www.urologichistory.museum/content/about/history/p1.cfm|title=History of the William P.

Its scope was extended to relate to the topic of research in urologic history.<ref name=Urologic/> Engel remained curator until 2011, when Michael Moran took over the position.<ref name="History"/>

The museum provides 300&nbsp;years of the history of urology, beginning from early and extremely dangerous [[kidney stone]] [[surgeries]] to modern [[ultra sound]] treatments that "pulverizes these jagged mineral clumps without any need to enter the body".<ref name="Faulk2012" /> It includes illustrations, urological tools such as [[catheter]]s, [[Cystoscopy|cytoscopes]] (includes Nitze cystoscopes made in 1890 with [[platinum]] loops for illumination and rotating cystoscopes), operating resectoscopes, [[laparoscope]]s, [[lithotriptor]]s, and resectoscopes; some of this urologic equipment was sterilized using formaldehyde or cyanide. All was donated by urologists,<ref name="Faulk2012" /> including Ernest F. Hock of [[Binghampton]], New York, Hans Reuter of [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] and Adolf A. Kutzmann of [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=donor>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urologichistory.museum/content/about/history/p2.cfm|title= Urologic History|accessdate=27 October 2012|publisher =Official website of Urologic History Museum}}</ref> 

The Center also aids research in all fields of urologic history in the USA. It contains an extensive urological library, with early urological and medical texts, and the AUA archives.<ref name=Urologic/> 

Current AUA Historian Engel considers the museum to show how medical history in urology evolved, and notes that the implements on display frequently scare visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bliwuiLLosc|title=William P. Didusch Center for Urologic History|publisher=William P. Didusch Center for Urologic History, accessed via [[YouTube]]|accessdate=27 October 2012}}</ref> Amongst its items are "long, thick metal tubes that once opened the floodgates between some unfortunate soul's bladder and the outside world", lassoes and nutcrackers on the end of steel tubes to break [[bladder stone]]s, and Hugh Hampton Young's "Prostate Punch", which resembles a "massively enlarged and curved [[hypodermic needle]] designed for the blind resection of prostate tissues", used in prostrate surgery (to ream out the tube of prostate tissue blindly); this last implement was used on the wealthy railway magnate [[Diamond Jim Brady]], who - cured of prostate problem - gave a generous donation to Johns Hopkins which enabled the establishment of the Brady Urological Institute and also the museum.<ref name="Lake2006"/><ref name="MoranSceurman2008">{{cite book|last1=Moran|first1=Mark|last2=Sceurman|first2=Mark|last3=Lake|first3=Matt|title=Weird U.S. The Odyssey Continues: Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eCQ_rQmzqfgC&pg=PA233|accessdate=27 October 2012|date=4 November 2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-4544-7|page=233}}</ref>  

A number of very large mineral samples of [[kidney stones]] are also on display.<ref name="Lake2006"/> The collection in the museum also includes more than 30&nbsp;[[microscopes]] from the 18th&nbsp;century, along with operating manuals; this acquisition on loan from a German urology family.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.urologichistory.museum/content/about/history/p3.cfm |title= History|accessdate=27 October 2012|publisher =Official website of Urologic History Museum}}</ref>

A popular display is the "spermatorrhea ring", a device from the early 20th&nbsp;century used to prevent [[Nocturnal emission|ejaculations while sleeping]]. It is made of a double ring of metal, with the inner ring clipped over the [[penis]] and the outer ring, which is lined on the inside with an armature of blunt metal teeth, on the shaft. These teeth constitute what could be called the "medically active ingredient". In the event of voluntary unknowing erection while sleeping, "the sensitive skin of the engorged part expands against the spiky outer ring, and the sleeper is pricked into consciousness in time to prevent nature from committing an unspeakable crime against itself".<ref name="Faulk2012"/>
