A '''loline alkaloid''' is a member of the '''1-aminopyrrolizidines''' (often referred to as '''lolines'''), which are [[bioactive]] [[natural product]]s with several distinct biological and chemical features. The lolines are [[Insecticide|insecticidal]] and insect-deterrent compounds that are produced in [[Pooideae|grasses]] infected by  [[Endophyte|endophytic]] [[Fungus|fungal]] [[Symbiosis|symbionts]] of the genus ''[[Epichloë]]'' ([[anamorphic]] species: ''[[Neotyphodium]]''). Lolines increase resistance of endophyte-infected grasses to insect [[herbivore]]s, and may also protect the infected plants from environmental stresses such as [[drought]] and spatial competition. They are [[alkaloids]], organic compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms. The basic [[Molecular geometry|chemical structure]] of the lolines comprises a saturated  [[pyrrolizidine]] ring, a [[primary amine]] at the C-1 carbon, and an internal [[ether]] bridge—a hallmark feature of the lolines, which is uncommon in organic compounds—joining two distant ring (C-2 and C-7) carbons (see Fig. 1). Different [[substituent]]s at the C-1 amine, such as [[methyl]], [[formyl]], and [[acetyl]] groups, yield loline species that have variable [[bioactivity]] against insects. Besides endophyte–grass symbiota, loline alkaloids have also been identified in some [[Eudicot|other plant species]]; namely, ''[[Adenocarpus]]'' species (family [[Fabaceae]]) and ''Argyreia mollis'' (family [[Convolvulaceae]]).

==Discovery==
A member of the loline alkaloids was first isolated from the grass ''[[Lolium temulentum]]'' and its elemental composition determined in 1892. It was initially named ''temuline'' and later renamed ''norloline''. (Reviewed by Schardl et al.

==Mechanism of action==
Lolines are insecticidal and deterrent to a broad range of insects, including species in the [[Hemiptera]], [[Homoptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[Lepidoptera]], and [[Blattaria]], such as the bird cherry-oat aphid (genus [[Rhopalosiphum]]), [[large milkweed bug]] (''Oncopeltus fasciatus''), and [[American cockroach]] (''Periplaneta americana'').<ref name="Schardl et al 2007"/><ref name="Dahlman et al 1991">{{cite book |author=Dahlman DL, Eichenseer H, Siegel MR|editors= P Barbosa, VA Krischnik, CG Jones|title= Microbial mediation of plant-herbivore interactions|publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1991|pages=227–252 |chapter=Chemical perspectives of endophyte–grass interactions and their implications to insect herbivory |isbn=0-471-61324-X}}</ref> [[LC50|LC<sub>50</sub>]] values of ''N''-formylloline or ''N''-acetylloline from grass seed extracts are 1-20&nbsp;µg/ml for aphids and milkweed bugs and impair insect development and [[fecundity]] and cause avoidance of loline-containing grass tissues.<ref name="Dahlman et al 1991"/>  However, results of feeding tests with grass extracts are occasionally difficult to interpret due to the presence of other endophyte alkaloids in these extracts,<ref name="Schardl et al 2007"/> and the exact mechanisms of the insecticidal actions of the lolines are unknown. The lolines may be [[Neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] to the insects, and differences in the chemical groups at the C-1-amine result in different levels of insect toxicity; for example, ''N''-formylloline (see Fig. 2), which occurs in higher concentrations in endophyte-infected grass plants,<ref name="Dahlman et al 1991"/> has greater insect toxicity than some other lolines, which occur at lower concentrations in the grass plant.<ref name="Schardl et al 2007"/> 
[[Image:N-formylloline structure.png|thumb|left|Figure 2. ''N''-formylloline, one of the most abundant lolines in endophyte-infected grasses.]]
Loline bioactivities show some unexpected variability with variation in their concentration in grass tissues. For example, the tall fescue endophyte, ''[[Neotyphodium coenophialum|N. coenophialum]]'', has been associated with enhanced resistance to the migratory root-endoparasitic nematode, ''[[Pratylenchus scribneri]]''. Interestingly, at low concentrations, ''N''-formylloline serves as a chemoattractant for ''P. scribneri'', but acts as a repellant at higher concentrations.<ref name="Bacetty et al 2009">{{cite journal|author= Bacetty A, Snook M, Glenn A, Noe J, Nagabhyru P, Bacon C|year=2009|title=Chemotaxis disruption in ''Pratylenchus scribneri'' by tall fescue root extracts and alkaloids|journal = [[Journal of Chemical Ecology]]|volume=35|pages=844–850|doi=10.1007/s10886-009-9657-x|pmid= 19575265|issue= 7}}</ref> However, [[ergot alkaloid]]s also have repellent and immobilizing effects on ''P. scribneri'',<ref name="Bacetty et al 2009"/> and an endophyte of perennial ryegrass lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no ergot alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode.<ref name="Panaccione et al 2006">{{cite journal|author= Panaccione DG, Kotcon JB, Schardl CL, Johnson RD, Morton JB|year=2006|title= Ergot alkaloids are not essential for endophytic fungus-associated population suppression of the lesion nematode, ''Pratylenchus scribneri,'' on perennial ryegrass|journal = [[Nematology (journal)|Nematology]]|volume=8|pages=583–590|doi=10.1163/156854106778614074}}</ref> Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and ergot alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear. 

Many epichloae endophytes—including ''[[Neotyphodium coenophialum|N. coenophialum]]'' symbiotic with ''[[Lolium arundinaceum]]'' (syn. ''Festuca arundinacea'', tall fescue)—also produce ergot alkaloids that are toxic to mammalian herbivores. The ergot alkaloids occur at relatively low concentrations in the plant and are often difficult to detect analytically.

==Production and distribution in the grass plant==
[[Image:Neotyphodium coenophialum.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 3. ''Neotyphodium coenophialum'' [[hyphae]] in tall fescue leaf tissue. Lolines commonly accumulate in the ''N. coenophialum''–tall fescue symbiosis, providing protection from insects and other environmental stresses.<ref name="Schardl et al 2007"/>]]
Lolines are produced by several grass–endophyte symbioses involving epichloae species, often along with other bioactive metabolites including ergot alkaloids and [[indole]] [[diterpenoid]]s, and the unusual pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, peramine, which is not found in other biological communities or organisms. The lolines are produced at levels, however, that can exceed 10&nbsp;mg/g grass tissue (ranging from 2–20,000&nbsp;µg/g<ref name="Schardl et al 2007"/><ref name="Justus et al 1997">{{cite journal|author=Justus, M, Witte, L, Hartmann, T| year=1997|title=Levels and tissue distribution of loline alkaloids in endophyte-infected Festuca pratensis|journal = Phytochemistry|volume=44|pages=51–57|doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(96)00535-3}}</ref>), exceeding  the concentrations of the other endophyte alkaloids by >1000-fold.<ref name="Dahlman et al 1991"/> Lolines produced in the grasses ''[[Lolium pratense]]'' (syn.

==Biosynthesis==
The lolines are [[Molecular geometry|structurally]] similar to pyrrolizidine alkaloids produced by many plants, notably the necine ring containing a [[tertiary amine]].
