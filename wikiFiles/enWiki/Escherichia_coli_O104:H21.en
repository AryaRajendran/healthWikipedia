'''''Escherichia coli'' O104:H21''' is a rare [[serotype]] of ''[[Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli|Escherichia coli]]'', a species of [[bacteria]] that lives in the [[lower intestines]] of [[mammals]].<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5602a2.htm Laboratory-Confirmed Non-O157 Shiga Toxin Producing ''E. Coli'', [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], accessed March 16, 2007</ref> The presence of many serotypes of E. coli in animals is beneficial or does not cause disease in animals. However, some serotypes of '' E. coli'' have been recognized as [[pathogenic]] to humans, e.g. [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|E. coli O157:H7]], [[Escherichia coli O121|E. coli O121]] and E. coli O104:H21.

==History==
''E. coli'' O104:H21 was discovered in 1982, when it caused an outbreak of severe bloody [[diarrhea]]. It had [[Infection|infected]] hamburgers, and those affected had eaten these hamburgers not fully cooked.<ref name="cdc.gov">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/escherichiacoli_g.htm#What%20is%20Escherichia%20coli%20O157:H7 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Last Accessed August 1, 2007</ref>

An [[2011 Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak|outbreak]] of ''E. coli'' responsible for at least 22 deaths in Northern Europe in May 2011 was reported to be caused by another O104 strain, [[Escherichia coli O104:H4]].

==Effects==
''E. coli'' O104:H21 can cause outbreak of infection similar to that caused by [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]], the most common shiga-like toxin-producing ''E. coli'' (SLTEC). SLTECs are the most well-known causes of gastrointestinal illness and diarrhea.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00038146.htm

==Treatment==
The body usually rids itself of harmful ''E. coli'' O104:H21 on its own within 5 to 10 days. [[Antibiotics]] should not be used, and neither should antidiarrheal agents such as [[loperamide]].<ref name="cdc.gov"/>
