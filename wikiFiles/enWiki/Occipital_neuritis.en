'''Occipital neuritis''', also called posttraumatic neck syndrome, is a pain in the back of the neck area.<ref name="primary">{{Cite web| url = http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Neuralgia_explained?open| title = Neuralgia explained| date = June 2006| accessdate = 2007-10-21| publisher = Better Health Channel Victoria}}</ref>

== Description ==
The pain is generally caused by [[Physical trauma|trauma]] in the neck area and/or [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] of some form.<ref name="dru">{{cite encyclopedia |editor= |encyclopedia=Stedman's Electronic Medical Dictionary |title=posttraumatic neck syndrome |url=http://www.drugs.com/dict/posttraumatic-neck-syndrome.html |accessdate=2007-11-21 |date= |publisher=Stedmanâ€™s|quote=a syndrome of neck pain, tenderness, and spasm, often associated with ill-defined symptoms (dizziness, blurred vision), resulting from neck trauma, most often of the whiplash variety.Synonym(s): cervical fibrositis, cervical tension syndrome}}</ref>  It's not considered an illness on its own, but generally a [[symptom]] of a greater illness.<ref name="primary" />

Because of the general [[syndrome]] that it is, many things can trigger it.  For example [[shingles]], [[injury]], [[infection]], and sometimes even [[syphilis]].<ref name="primary" />  Statistically almost everyone will have experienced this to a varying degree sometime throughout their life.  In some cases, it can get even worse (based on the underlying condition), to the point that the afflicted person can no longer function properly, or the overall [[lifestyle]] is affected.<ref name="primary" />

== Symptoms ==
Some of the 'Known' symptoms are
* [[Pain]]
* [[Dizziness]]
* [[Blurred vision]]
* [[tenderness (medicine)|Tenderness]]
* [[Spasm]]s of the neck area

== Types ==
("Tip Douloureus" /* Types */ is misspelled by someone?)

Tic Douloureux (commonly referred to as [[trigeminal neuralgia]]), but it is not directly associated with Occipital Neuritis, or Occipital Neuralgia.  Occipital Neuralgia affects the nerves at the base of the skull, where the nerves leave the spine and travel to the sides of the head, and over the top of the head.  (The Occipital nerves are between the scalp and the skull.) Diagnosis can be made through injections at the site of the pain; if a person thought to have Occipital Neuralgia gets relief from an injection, the diagnosis is positive.

With [[trigeminal neuralgia]], the [[fifth cranial nerve]] is affected (this nerve is inside the [[skull]], and is part of the [[brain]].) The [[trigeminal nerve]] is one main nerve, a [[ganglion]] with three sections, branching out into the facial areas, (one near the eye area and brow, one in the general vicinity of the cheek and into the side of the nose and lips, and one into the lower jaw and chin area.)  It is believed that the [[trigeminal nerve]] is irritated through contact with a small [[artery]] within the brain. This is a highly painful affliction.  [[Diagnosis]] is made by [[symptoms]] relayed by the patient to their physician, and through a process of elimination of other facial disorders.  There are currently several [[surgical procedure]]s that can be done to try to relieve the pain of [[trigeminal neuralgia]], but none of them are guaranteed to cure the disorder.

== Treatments ==
The primary treatment of occipital neuritis is treatment of the initial cause of the problem, which in turn will generally eliminate the pain itself.<ref name="primary" />  Alternate strategies include [[surgery]], various types of [[pain medication]], and other forms of treatment.<ref name="primary" />

One treatment for Occipital Neuralgia is injections at the site of pain.  Here the disease has progressed into the [[optic nerve]], and has different symptoms than Occipital Neuralgia.  Occipital Neuritis affects the [[optic nerve]], potentially causing [[vision loss]], [[blurred vision|blurriness]], and pain in the eye itself. Occipital Neuralgia affects the nerves in between the skull and scalp.  It can be very painful, and may require treatment, and injections to the area of pain.
