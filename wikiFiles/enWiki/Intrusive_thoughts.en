==Description==
Many people experience the type of bad or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts.<ref name=OCDAction/>  For most people, intrusive thoughts are a "fleeting annoyance."<ref name="Baer5">Baer (2001), p. 5</ref>  London psychologist Stanley Rachman presented a questionnaire to healthy college students and found that virtually all said they had these thoughts from time to time, including thoughts of sexual violence, sexual punishment, "unnatural" sex acts, painful sexual practices, blasphemous or obscene images, thoughts of harming elderly people or someone close to them, violence against animals or towards children, and impulsive or abusive outbursts or utterances.<ref name="BaerRachman">As reported in Baer (2001), p. 7: {{cite journal |author=Rachman S, de Silva P |title=Abnormal and normal obsessions |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=233–48 |year=1978 |pmid=718588 | doi = 10.1016/0005-7967(78)90022-0 }}</ref>  Such bad thoughts are universal among humans, and have "almost certainly always been a part of the human condition".<ref>Baer (2001), p. 8</ref>  

When intrusive thoughts occur with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), patients are less able to ignore the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing.<ref name=OCDAction/>  The thoughts may become obsessions which are paralyzing, severe, and constantly present, and can range from thoughts of violence or sex to religious blasphemy.<ref name="Baer5"/>  Distinguishing them from normal intrusive thoughts experienced by many people, the intrusive thoughts associated with OCD may be anxiety provoking, irrepressible, and persistent.<ref name=Colino>Colino, Stacey.

For Some Women, Though, Such Fears Become Overwhelming".] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (March 7, 2006).  Retrieved on December 30, 2006.</ref>  

How people react to intrusive thoughts may determine whether these thoughts will become severe, turn into obsessions, or require treatment.  Intrusive thoughts can occur with or without compulsions. Carrying out the compulsion reduces the anxiety, but makes the urge to perform the compulsion stronger each time it recurs, reinforcing the intrusive thoughts.<ref name=OCDAction/>  According to Baer, suppressing the thoughts only makes them stronger, and recognizing that bad thoughts do not signify that one is truly evil is one of the steps to overcoming them.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 17</ref>  There is evidence of the benefit of acceptance as an alternative to suppression of intrusive thoughts.  A study showed that those instructed to suppress intrusive thoughts experienced more distress after suppression, while patients instructed to accept the bad thoughts experienced decreased discomfort.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marcks BA, Woods DW |title=A comparison of thought suppression to an acceptance-based technique in the management of personal intrusive thoughts: a controlled evaluation |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=433–45 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15701355 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2004.03.005}}</ref>  These results may be related to underlying [[cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in OCD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tolin DF, Abramowitz JS, Przeworski A, Foa EB |title=Thought suppression in obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1255–74 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12384322|doi= 10.1016/S0005-7967(01)00095-X }}</ref>  But, accepting the thoughts can be more difficult for persons with OCD.  In the 19th century, OCD was known as "the doubting sickness";<ref name="PenzelGay">Penzel, Fred. [http://www.homestead.com/westsuffolkpsych/am_i_gay.html "How Do I Know I'm Not Really Gay?"]  Retrieved on January 1, 2007</ref> the "pathological doubt" that accompanies OCD can make it harder for a person with OCD to distinguish "normal" intrusive thoughts as experienced by most people, causing them to "suffer in silence, feeling too embarrassed or worried that they will be thought crazy".<ref name="PenzelSin">Penzel, Fred.

The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low. Patients who are experiencing intense [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], and upset over these thoughts are different from those who actually act on them.  The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or [[remorse]]; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts.  Patients who are not troubled or shamed by their thoughts, do not find them distasteful, or who have actually taken action, might need to have more serious conditions such as [[psychosis]] or potentially criminal behaviors ruled out.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 37–38</ref>  According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person does not feel upset by the thoughts, or rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others do not see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 43–44</ref>

===Inappropriate aggressive thoughts===
Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or themselves.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 33, 78</ref>  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile.<ref name="Baerxiv"/>  Rachman's survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including:<ref name="BaerRachman"/>
* Causing harm to elderly people
* Imagining or wishing harm upon someone close to oneself
* Impulses to violently attack, hit, harm or kill a person, small child, or animal
* Impulses to shout at or abuse someone, or attack and violently punish someone, or say something rude, inappropriate, nasty or violent to someone.
These thoughts are part of being human, and need not ruin the quality of life.<ref>Baer (2001), p. xv</ref>  Treatment is available when the thoughts are associated with OCD and become persistent, severe, or distressing.

===Inappropriate sexual thoughts===
Sexual obsessions involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]], and [[rape]]" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures", involving "[[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[homosexuality|homosexual]] content" with persons of any age.<ref name="Osgood"/>

Like other unwanted intrusive thoughts or images, everyone has some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress.  The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the intrusive thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing.<ref name="Osgood"/>

One of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts his or her sexual identity.  As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity.<ref name="PenzelGay"/> 

A person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, "embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear that you may act on the thought or perceived impulse, and doubt about whether you have already acted in such a way."  Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress.<ref name="Osgood"/>  Their concern over these thoughts may cause them to scrutinize their bodies to determine if the thoughts result in feelings of arousal.  But, focusing attention of any part of the body can result in feelings in that part of the body, hence doing so may decrease confidence and increase fear about acting on the urges.  Part of treatment of sexual intrusive thoughts involves therapy to help sufferers accept intrusive thoughts and stop trying to reassure themselves by checking their bodies.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 35</ref>

===Blasphemous religious thoughts===
{{see also|Scrupulosity}}
[[Blasphemy|Blasphemous]] thoughts are a common component of OCD, documented throughout history; notable religious figures such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]] were known to be tormented by intrusive, blasphemous or religious thoughts and urges.<ref name="Baer106">Baer (2001), p.106</ref>  Martin Luther had urges to curse God and Jesus, and was obsessed with images of "the Devil's behind".<ref name="Baer106"/><ref>Erickson, Erik H.  ''Young Man Luther: A Study in Psychoanalysis and History''.  New York: W.W. Norton, 1962</ref>  St. Ignatius had numerous obsessions, including the fear of stepping on pieces of straw forming a cross, fearing that it showed disrespect to Christ.<ref name="Baer106"/><ref>Ciarrocchi, Joseph W.  "Religion, Scrupulosity, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder," in Michael A. Jenike, Lee Baer, and William A. MInichiello, eds., ''Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders:  Practical Management'', 3rd ed.  St. Louis: Mosby, 1998</ref>  A study of 50 patients with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder found that 40% had religious and blasphemous thoughts and doubts—a higher, but not statistically significantly different number than the 38% who had the obsessional thoughts related to dirt and contamination more commonly associated with OCD.<ref> {{cite journal |author=Shooka A, al-Haddad MK, Raees A |title=OCD in Bahrain: a phenomenological profile |journal=Int J Soc Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=147–54 |year=1998 |pmid=9675634 |doi= 10.1177/002076409804400207}}</ref>  One study suggests that content of intrusive thoughts may vary depending on culture, and that blasphemous thoughts may be more common in men than in women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ghassemzadeh H, Mojtabai R, Khamseh A, Ebrahimkhani N, Issazadegan AA, Saif-Nobakht Z |title=Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder in a sample of Iranian patients |journal=Int J Soc Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=20–8 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=12008904 |doi= 10.1177/002076402128783055 }}</ref>

According to Fred Penzel, a New York psychologist, some common religious obsessions and intrusive thoughts are:<ref name="PenzelSin"/>
* sexual thoughts about God, saints, and religious figures
* bad thoughts or images during prayer or meditation
* thoughts of being [[demonic possession|possessed]]
* fears of sinning or breaking a religious law or performing a ritual incorrectly
* fears of omitting prayers or reciting them incorrectly
* repetitive and intrusive blasphemous thoughts
* urges or impulses to say blasphemous words or commit blasphemous acts during religious services.

Suffering can be greater and treatment complicated when intrusive thoughts involve religious implications;<ref name="Baer106"/> patients may believe the thoughts are inspired by Satan,<ref>Baer (2001), p. 108</ref> and may fear  punishment from God or have magnified shame because they perceive themselves as sinful.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 109</ref>  Symptoms can be more distressful for sufferers with strong religious convictions or beliefs.<ref name="PenzelSin"/>

Baer believes that blasphemous thoughts are more common in [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] than in other religions, whereas [[Jew]]s or [[Muslim]]s tend to have obsessions related more to complying with the laws and rituals of their faith, and performing the rituals perfectly.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 111–112</ref>  He hypothesizes that this is because what is considered inappropriate varies among cultures and religions, and intrusive thoughts torment their sufferers with whatever is considered most inappropriate in the surrounding culture.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 112</ref>

==Associated conditions== 
Intrusive thoughts are associated with OCD or [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]],<ref>Baer (2001), p. 40, 57</ref> but may also occur with other conditions<ref name=BrewinIntrusiveImages/> such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michael T, Halligan SL, Clark DM, Ehlers A |title=Rumination in posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Depress Anxiety |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=307–17 |year=2007 |pmid=17041914 |doi=10.1002/da.20228 }}</ref> [[clinical depression]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Christopher G, MacDonald J |title=The impact of clinical depression on working memory |journal=Cogn Neuropsychiatry |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=379–99 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16571468 |doi=10.1080/13546800444000128}}</ref> [[postpartum depression]],<ref name=Colino/> and [[anxiety]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Antoni MH, Wimberly SR, Lechner SC, ''et al.'' |title=Reduction of cancer-specific thought intrusions and anxiety symptoms with a stress management intervention among women undergoing treatment for breast cancer |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=10 |pages=1791–7 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17012691 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.10.1791}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Compas BE, Beckjord E, Agocha B, ''et al.'' |title=Measurement of coping and stress responses in women with breast cancer |journal=Psychooncology |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1038–54 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17009343 |doi=10.1002/pon.999}}</ref>  One of these conditions<ref>Baer also mentions [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS), but notes that it is the combination of [[comorbid]] OCD—when present—and [[tic]]s that accounts for the intrusive, obsessive thoughts.

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
The key difference between OCD and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is that the intrusive thoughts of PTSD sufferers are of traumatic events that actually happened to them, whereas OCD sufferers have thoughts of imagined catastrophes.  PTSD patients with intrusive thoughts have to sort out violent, sexual, or blasphemous thoughts from memories of traumatic experiences.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 62–64</ref>  When patients with intrusive thoughts do not respond to treatment, physicians may suspect past physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 67</ref>

===Depression===
People who are clinically depressed may experience intrusive thoughts more intensely, and view them as evidence that they are worthless or sinful people.  The [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]] that are common in depression must be distinguished from intrusive thoughts, because suicidal thoughts—unlike harmless sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts—can be dangerous.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 51–53</ref>

===Postpartum depression===
Unwanted thoughts by mothers about harming their newborn infants are common in [[postpartum depression]].<ref>Baer (2001), p. 20</ref>  A 1999 study of 65 women with postpartum major depression by Katherine Wisner ''et al.'' found the most frequent aggressive thought for women with postpartum depression was causing harm to their newborn infants.<ref name=Wisner>As reported in Baer (2001), pp. 20–23, 139–40: {{cite journal |author=Wisner KL, Peindl KS, Gigliotti T, Hanusa BH |title=Obsessions and compulsions in women with postpartum depression |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=176–80 |year=1999 |month=March |pmid=10192593 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v60n0305}}</ref>  A study of 85 new parents found that 89% experienced intrusive images, for example, of the baby suffocating, having an accident, being harmed, or being kidnapped.<ref name=Colino/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Abramowitz JS, Khandker M, Nelson CA, Deacon BJ, Rygwall R |title=The role of cognitive factors in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective study |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=1361–74 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16352291 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.09.011}}</ref> 

Some women may develop symptoms of OCD during pregnancy or the postpartum period.<ref name=Colino/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Arnold LM |title=A Case Series of Women With Postpartum-Onset Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=103–108 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=15014682 |pmc=181073 |doi= 10.4088/PCC.v01n0402}}</ref> Postpartum OCD occurs mainly in women who may already have OCD, perhaps in a mild or undiagnosed form.  Postpartum depression and OCD may be [[comorbid]] (often occurring together). And though physicians may focus more on the depressive symptoms, one study found that obsessive thoughts did accompany postpartum depression in 57% of new mothers.<ref name=Colino/>

Wisner found common obsessions about harming babies in mothers experiencing postpartum depression include images of the baby lying dead in a casket or being eaten by sharks; stabbing the baby; throwing the baby down the stairs; or drowning or burning the baby (as by submerging it in the bathtub in the former case or throwing it in the fire or putting it in the microwave in the latter).  <ref name=Wisner/><ref>Baer (2001), p. 21</ref>  Baer estimates that up to 200,000 new mothers with postpartum depression each year may develop these obsessional thoughts about their babies;<ref>Baer (2001), p. 22</ref> and because they may be reluctant to share these thoughts with a physician or family member, or suffer in silence and fear they are "crazy", their depression can worsen.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 23</ref>

Intrusive fears of harming immediate children can last longer than the postpartum period.  A study of 100 clinically depressed women found that 41% had obsessive fears that they might harm their child, and some were afraid to care for their children.  Among non-depressed mothers, the study found 7% had thoughts of harming their child<ref>As reported in Baer (2001), p. 51:  {{cite journal |author=Jennings KD, Ross S, Popper S, Elmore M |title=Thoughts of harming infants in depressed and nondepressed mothers |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=54 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–8 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10403143 |doi= 10.1016/S0165-0327(98)00185-2}}</ref>—a rate that yields an additional 280,000 non-depressed mothers in the United States with intrusive thoughts about harming their children.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 24</ref>

===Unconscious complexes===

In the field of [[analytical psychology]] intrusive thoughts can be understood as unconscious parts of one's personality that affect them directly (due to the contents of the intrusive thoughts being associated with unconscious [[Complex (psychology)|complexes]]). The self-sabotaging nature of intrusive thoughts is also seen in a more [[Teleology|teleological]] approach, as a way for the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] to reach consciousness and be dealt with and integrated by the ego.

==Frequency==
According to Baer, most people who suffer bad or unacceptable thoughts have not identified themselves as having OCD, because they may not have what they believe to be classic symptoms of OCD, such as handwashing.  Yet, he says, [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies suggest that intrusive thoughts are the most common kind of OCD worldwide; if people in the United States with intrusive thoughts gathered, they would form the fourth-largest city in the US, following [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].<ref>Baer (2001), p. xvii</ref>  A 2007 study found that 78% of a clinical sample of OCD patients had intrusive images.<ref name=BrewinIntrusiveImages/> 

The prevalence of OCD in every culture studied is at least 2% of the population, and the majority of those have obsessions, or bad thoughts, only; this results in a conservative estimate of more than 2 million sufferers in the United States alone (as of 2000).<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 36–37</ref>  One author estimates that one in 50 adults has OCD and about 10–20% of these have sexual obsessions.<ref name="Osgood">{{cite web |author= Osgood-Hynes, Deborah |url=  http://www.ocfoundation.org/UserFiles/File/Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |title= Thinking Bad Thoughts |format= PDF |work= MGH/McLean OCD Institute, Belmont, MA |publisher= OCD Foundation, Milford, CT |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625161358/http://www.ocfoundation.org/UserFiles/File/Thinking+Bad+Thoughts.pdf |archivedate= June 25, 2008 |accessdate= December 27, 2010}}</ref>  A recent study found that 25% of 293 patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD had a history of sexual obsessions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grant JE, Pinto A, Gunnip M, Mancebo MC, Eisen JL, Rasmussen SA |title=Sexual obsessions and clinical correlates in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=325–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16905392 |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2006.01.007}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment for intrusive thoughts is similar to treatment for OCD.  [[Exposure therapy|Exposure and response prevention therapy]]—also referred to as habituation or [[Systematic desensitization|desensitization]]—is useful in treating intrusive thoughts.<ref name="Osgood"/>  Mild cases can also be treated with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], which helps patients identify and manage the unwanted thoughts.<ref name=Colino/> 

===Exposure therapy===
Exposure therapy is the treatment of choice for intrusive thoughts.<ref name="Baer91">Baer (2001), p. 91</ref> According to Deborah Osgood-Hynes, Psy.D. Director of Psychological Services and Training at the MGH/McLean OCD Institute, "In order to reduce a fear, you have to face a fear. This is true of all types of anxiety and fear reactions, not just OCD."<ref name="Osgood"/> 

Because it is uncomfortable to experience bad thoughts and urges, shame, doubt or fear, the initial reaction is usually to do something to make the feelings diminish.  By engaging in a ritual or compulsion to diminish the anxiety or bad feeling, the action is strengthened via a process called negative reinforcement—the mind learns that the way to avoid the bad feeling is by engaging in a ritual or compulsions.  When OCD becomes severe, this leads to more interference in life and continues the frequency and severity of the thoughts the person sought to avoid.<ref name="Osgood"/>

Exposure therapy (or exposure and response prevention) is the practice of staying in an anxiety-provoking or feared situation until the distress or anxiety diminishes.  The goal is to reduce the fear reaction, learning to not react to the bad thoughts.  This is the most effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of the intrusive thoughts.<ref name="Osgood"/>  The goal is to be able to "expose yourself to the thing that most triggers your fear or discomfort for one to two hours at a time, without leaving the situation, or doing anything else to distract or comfort you."<ref>Baer (2001), p. 73</ref>  Exposure therapy will not completely eliminate intrusive thoughts—everyone has bad thoughts—but most patients find that it can decrease their thoughts sufficiently that intrusive thoughts no longer interfere with their lives.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 86</ref>

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is a newer therapy than exposure therapy, available for those unable or unwilling to undergo exposure therapy.<ref name="Baer91"/>  Cognitive therapy has been shown to be useful in reducing intrusive thoughts,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deblinger E, Stauffer LB, Steer RA |title=Comparative efficacies of supportive and cognitive behavioral group therapies for young children who have been sexually abused and their nonoffending mothers |journal=Child Maltreat |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=332–43 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11675816 |doi= 10.1177/1077559501006004006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sousa MB, Isolan LR, Oliveira RR, Manfro GG, Cordioli AV |title=A randomized clinical trial of cognitive-behavioral group therapy and sertraline in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=67 |issue=7 |pages=1133–9 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16889458 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v67n0717}}</ref> but developing a conceptualization of the obsessions and compulsions with the patient is important.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Purdon C |title=Cognitive-behavioral treatment of repugnant obsessions |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=1169–80 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15389619 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20081 }}</ref>

===Pharmaceutical=== 
[[Antidepressant]]s or [[antipsychotic]] medications may be used for more severe cases if intrusive thoughts do not respond to cognitive behavioral or exposure therapy alone.<ref name=Colino/><ref name="Baer113114">Baer (2001), pp. 113–114</ref>  Whether the cause of intrusive thoughts is OCD, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder, the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) drugs (a class of antidepressants) are the most commonly prescribed.<ref name="Baer113114"/>  Intrusive thoughts may occur in persons with [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS) who also have OCD; the obsessions in TS-related OCD are thought to respond to SSRI drugs as well.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 144</ref>  

Antidepressants which have been shown to be effective in treating OCD include [[fluvoxamine]] (trade name<ref>Medication trade names may differ between countries. In general, this article uses North American trade names.</ref> Luvox), [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), [[paroxetine]] (Paxil), [[citalopram]] (Celexa), and [[clomipramine]] (Anafranil).<ref>Baer (2001), p. 116</ref>  Although SSRIs are known to be effective for OCD in general, there have been fewer studies on their effectiveness for intrusive thoughts.<ref name="Baer115">Baer (2001), p. 115</ref>  A retrospective chart review of patients with sexual symptoms treated with SSRIs showed the greatest improvement was in those with intrusive sexual obsessions typical of OCD.<ref>As reported in Baer (2001), p. 115:  {{cite journal |author=Stein DJ, Hollander E, Anthony DT, ''et al.'' |title=Serotonergic medications for sexual obsessions, sexual addictions, and paraphilias |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=267–71 |year=1992 |month=August |pmid=1386848}}</ref>  A study of ten patients with religious or blasphemous obsessions found that most patients responded to treatment with fluoxetine or clomipramine.<ref>As reported in Baer (2001), p. 115:  {{cite journal |author=Fallon BA, Liebowitz MR, Hollander E, et al. |title=The pharmacotherapy of moral or religious scrupulosity |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=12 |pages=517–21 |year=1990 |month=December |pmid=2258366}}</ref>  Women with postpartum depression often have anxiety as well, and may need lower starting doses of SSRIs; they may not respond fully to the medication, and may benefit from adding cognitive behavioral or response prevention therapy.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 120</ref>

Patients with intense intrusive thoughts that do not respond to SSRIs or other antidepressants may be prescribed [[Typical antipsychotics|typical]] and [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical]] [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptics]] including [[risperidone]] (trade name Risperdal), [[ziprasidone]] (Geodon), [[haloperidol]] (Haldol), and [[pimozide]] (Orap).<ref>Baer (2001), p. 119</ref>

Studies suggest that therapeutic doses of [[inositol]] may be useful in the treatment of obsessive thoughts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Albert U, Bergesio C, Pessina E, Maina G, Bogetto F |title=Management of treatment resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder.
