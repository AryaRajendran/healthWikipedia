'''Pulmonary edema''' (American English), or '''oedema''' ([[British English]]; both words from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἴδημα}}), is [[edema|fluid accumulation]] in the air spaces and parenchyma of the [[human lung|lung]]s.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000033856|pulmonary edema}}</ref> It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause [[respiratory failure]]. It is due to either failure of the [[left ventricle]] of the [[heart]] to adequately remove blood from the [[pulmonary]] circulation ("cardiogenic pulmonary edema"), or an injury to the lung [[parenchyma]] or vasculature of the lung ("noncardiogenic pulmonary edema").<ref name=Ware>{{cite journal |author=Ware LB, Matthay MA |title=Clinical practice. Acute pulmonary edema |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=353 |issue=26 |pages=2788–96 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16382065 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp052699}}</ref> Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially in the acute setting, can lead to [[Respiratory distress|respiratory failure]], cardiac arrest due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and death.

==Symptoms and signs==
The overwhelming symptom of pulmonary edema is [[shortness of breath|difficulty breathing]], but may also include [[haemoptysis|coughing up blood]] (classically seen as pink, frothy sputum), [[diaphoresis|excessive sweating]], [[anxiety]], and [[pallor|pale skin]]. [[Shortness of breath]] can manifest as [[orthopnea]] (inability to lie down flat due to breathlessness) and/or [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]] (episodes of severe sudden breathlessness at night), indeed these are common presenting symptoms of chronic pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure. The chronic development of pulmonary edema may be associated with symptoms and signs of "fluid overload", this is a non specific term to describe the manifestations of left ventricular failure on the rest of the body and includes peripheral [[edema]] (swelling of the legs, in general, of the "pitting" variety, wherein the skin is slow to return to normal when pressed upon), raised [[jugular venous pressure]] and [[hepatomegaly]], where the liver is enlarged and may be tender or even pulsatile. Other signs include end-inspiratory [[crackles]] (sounds heard at the end of a deep breath) on [[auscultation]] and the presence of a [[third heart sound]].<ref name=Ware/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Pulmonary oedema.jpg|thumb|right|X-Ray showing Pulmonary oedema]]
There is no one single test for confirming that breathlessness is caused by pulmonary edema; indeed, in many cases, the cause of shortness of breath is probably multifactorial. 

Low [[oxygen saturation]] and disturbed [[arterial blood gas]] readings support the proposed diagnosis by suggesting a [[pulmonary shunt]]. Chest [[X-ray]] will show fluid in the alveolar walls, [[Kerley B lines]], increased vascular shadowing in a classical batwing peri-[[hilum of lung|hilum]] pattern, upper lobe diversion (increased blood flow to the superior parts of the lung), and possibly [[pleural effusion]]s. In contrast, patchy alveolar infiltrates are more typically associated with noncardiogenic edema<ref name=Ware/>

Especially in the case of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, urgent [[echocardiography]] may strengthen the diagnosis by demonstrating impaired left ventricular function, high [[central venous pressure]]s and high [[pulmonary artery]] pressures.

Blood tests are performed for [[electrolyte]]s (sodium, potassium) and markers of [[renal function]] (creatinine, urea). [[Liver enzyme]]s, inflammatory markers (usually [[C-reactive protein]]) and a [[complete blood count]] as well as [[coagulation]] studies (PT, aPTT) are also typically requested. [[Brain natriuretic peptide|B-type natriuretic peptide]] (BNP) is available in many hospitals, sometimes even as a point-of-care test. Low levels of BNP (<100 pg/ml) suggest a cardiac cause is unlikely.<ref name=Ware/>

Pulmonary edema is an accumulation of fluid within the [[parenchyma]] and air spaces of the lungs. Classically it is cardiogenic (left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]]) but fluid may also accumulate due to damage to the lung. This damage may be direct injury or injury mediated by high pressures within the pulmonary circulation. When directly or indirectly caused by increased left ventricular pressure pulmonary edema may form when mean pulmonary pressure rises from the normal of 15 mmHg<ref>[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/pah/pah_what.html What Is Pulmonary Hypertension?] From Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI).

===Cardiogenic===
* Left ventricular failure may be due to a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] leading to [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]] ([[tachycardia]]/fast heartbeat or [[bradycardia]]/slow heartbeat) and fluid overload, e.g., from [[renal failure|kidney failure]] or [[intravenous therapy]] which may cause dilatation and failure of the left ventricle or may cause pulmonary edema in the absence of heart failure.

===Non-cardiogenic===
* [[Hypertensive crisis]]. The cause of pulmonary edema in the presence of a [[hypertensive crisis]] is probably due to a combination of increased pressures in the [[right ventricle]] and pulmonary circulation and also increased [[systemic vascular resistance]] and left ventricle [[contractility]] increasing the [[hydrostatic pressure]] within the pulmonary [[capillaries]] leading to [[extravasation]] of fluid and [[edema]].
* Upper airway obstruction (negative pressure pulmonary edema<ref>{{cite journal|last=Papaioannou|first=V.|coauthors=Terzi, I.; Dragoumanis, C.; Pneumatikos, I.|title=Negative-pressure acute tracheobronchial [[hemorrhage]] and pulmonary edema|journal=Journal of Anesthesia|year=2009|volume=23|issue=3|pages=417–420|doi=10.1007/s00540-009-0757-0|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r7256106w24031lr/}}</ref> )
* Neurogenic causes<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Leary|first=R.|coauthors=McKinlay, J.|title=Neurogenic pulmonary oedema|journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia, Critical Care & Pain|year=2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=87–92|doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkr006}}</ref>  ([[seizures]], head trauma, [[strangulation]], [[electrocution]]).

===Other/unknown===

Injury to the lung may also cause pulmonary oedema through injury to the vasculature and parenchyma of the lung. The acute lung injury-acute respiratory distress syndrome ([[Acute lung injury|ALI]]-[[ARDS]]) covers many of these causes, but they may include:

* Inhalation of hot or toxic gases
* [[Pulmonary contusion]], i.e., [[Physical trauma|high-energy trauma]] (e.g. vehicle accidents)
* [[Pulmonary aspiration|Aspiration]], e.g., gastric fluid
* Reexpansion, i.e. post large volume [[thoracocentesis]], resolution of pneumothorax, post decortication, removal of endobronchial obstruction, effectively a form of negative pressure pulmonary oedema.
* Reperfusion injury, i.e. postpulmonary [[thromboendartectomy]] or [[lung transplantation]]
* Immersion pulmonary edema<ref name="pmid9068153">{{cite journal |author=Hampson NB, Dunford RG |title=Pulmonary edema of scuba divers |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=29–33 |year=1997 |pmid=9068153 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2388 |accessdate=2008-09-04}}</ref><ref name="pmid15796313">{{cite journal |author=Cochard G, Arvieux J, Lacour JM, Madouas G, Mongredien H, Arvieux CC |title=Pulmonary edema in scuba divers: recurrence and fatal outcome |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=39–44 |year=2005 |pmid=15796313 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4032 |accessdate=2008-09-04}}</ref>
* Multiple [[blood transfusion]]s
* Severe [[infection]] or [[inflammation]] which may be local or systemic. This is the classical form of [[Acute lung injury|ALI]]-[[ARDS]].

There are also a range of causes of pulmonary edema which are less well characterised and arguably represent specific instances of the broader classifications above.

* [[Arteriovenous malformation]]
* [[Hantavirus]] pulmonary syndrome
* [[High altitude pulmonary edema]] (HAPE), probably a manifestation of neurogenic pulmonary edema<ref name="pmid18578641">{{cite journal |author=Luks AM |title=Do we have a "best practice" for treating high altitude pulmonary edema? |journal=High Alt.

==Management==
Focus is initially on maintaining adequate oxygenation. The patient is given high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation (either [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) or [[variable positive airway pressure]] (VPAP)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Masip J, Roque M, Sánchez B, Fernández R, Subirana M, Expósito JA |title=Noninvasive ventilation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=294 |issue=24 |pages=3124–30 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16380593 |doi=10.1001/jama.294.24.3124 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/294/24/3124}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Peter JV, Moran JL, Phillips-Hughes J, Graham P, Bersten AD |title=Effect of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) on mortality in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9517 |pages=1155–63 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16616558 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68506-1}}</ref>) or [[mechanical ventilation]] and [[positive end-expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) in very severe cases.

When circulatory causes have led to pulmonary edema, treatment with intravenous nitrates ([[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|glyceryl trinitrate]]), and [[loop diuretic]]s, such as [[furosemide]] or [[bumetanide]], is the mainstay of therapy. These improve both preload and afterload, and aid in improving cardiac function.

==Prevention==
In those with underlying heart disease, effective control of congestive symptoms prevents pulmonary edema.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Dexamethasone]] is in widespread use for the prevention of high altitude pulmonary edema. [[Sildenafil]] is used as a preventive treatment for altitude-induced pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richalet JP, Gratadour P, Robach P, ''et al.'' |title=Sildenafil inhibits altitude-induced hypoxemia and [[pulmonary hypertension]] |journal=Am.
