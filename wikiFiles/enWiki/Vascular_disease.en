'''Vascular disease''' is a form of [[cardiovascular disease]] primarily affecting the [[blood vessels]].

Some conditions, such as [[angina]] and [[myocardial ischemia]], can be considered both vascular diseases and [[heart disease]]s.<ref>http://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/conditions/cardiovascular-disease.aspx</ref>

[[Cigarette smoking]] is the major [[risk factor]].<ref name="urlWhat is Vascular Disease?">{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/vascular/whatis.cfm |title=What is Vascular Disease? |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Background==
Vascular disease is a pathological state of large and medium sized muscular arteries and is triggered by [[endothelial cell]] dysfunction. Because of factors like pathogens, oxidized LDL particles and other inflammatory stimuli [[endothelial cell]]s become activated. This leads to change in their characteristics: [[endothelial cell]]s start to excrete [[cytokines]] and [[chemokines]] and express [[adhesion molecules]] on their surface. This in turn results in recruitment of white blood cells ([[monocytes]] and [[lymphocytes]]), which can infiltrate the blood vessel wall. Stimulation of [[smooth muscle cell]] layer with [[cytokines]] produced by [[endothelial cell]]s and recruited white blood cells causes [[smooth muscle cell]]s to proliferate and migrate towards the blood vessel lumen. The process causes thickening of the vessel wall, forming a plaque consisting of proliferating [[smooth muscle cell]]s, [[macrophage]]s and various types of [[lymphocyte]]s. This plaque result in obstructed blood flow leading to diminished amounts of oxygen and nutrients, that reach the target organ. In the final stages, the plaque may also rupture causing the formation of clots, and as a result [[strokes]].

==Diagnosis== 
It can be very difficult to make a vascular disease diagnosis as there are a wide variety of symptoms that a person can carry.<ref>[http://www.vasculardiseasediagnosis.com/ Vascular Disease diagnosis] 2010-02-12</ref> Vascular diagnosis is primarily made upon the symptoms, [[family history (medicine)|family history]] and after a [[physical examination]] performed by a specialist.

The physical exam may be slightly different depending on the type of vascular disease that is suspected. In the case of a [[peripheral vascular disease]] the physical exam consists in checking the [[blood flow]] in the legs or flow or the [[blood pressure]]. During the physical examination of a [[cerebrovascular disease]] the doctor listens with the help of a [[stethoscope]] to detect abnormal sounds of blood flow (called [[bruit]]) on the neck.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Tests  and exams==
In order to confirm a cerebrovascular disease, few additional tests may be required whenever there are doubts in what the diagnosis concerns. These may include tests such as the [[cerebral angiography]] (carotid angiogram). This test is made by inserting a [[catheter]] into the patient's [[artery]] in the leg with the help of a needle through the [[blood vessel|vessels]] in the abdomen and chest, until it reaches the arteries of the neck. The coronary [[angiography|angiogram]] is basically the same procedure which is however utilized for detecting [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular]] conditions.

The carotid duplex (carotid ultrasound) is another type of noninvasive test which uses [[ultrasound]] waves in order to detect [[Atheroma|plaque]], [[thrombus|blood clots]] or any other type of blood flow abnormalities in the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]]. The specialists may detect hemorrhagic [[stroke]]s with the help of a [[X-ray computed tomography]]. They are easily visualized due to the differences in density between the blood, bone and brain tissue. The CT scans are also useful in finding out abnormalities in the heart and in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions.<ref>University of Maryland medical center.

The Doppler ultrasound is a test used to diagnose both cerebrovascular disease and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. It utilizes high frequency sound waves that are being directed to the [[vein]] or artery which presents abnormalities and are then detected on the Doppler.

[[Electroencephalography]] may be required in order to detect electrical impulses in the brain by placing small metal discs called electrodes on the scalp of the patient.

The [[magnetic resonance imaging]] technique is able to obtain 3D images of the body structure. The images are very clear and they are produced by using magnetic fields and recent computer technology. Due to the clarity of the pictures, the MRI can detect any signs of prior strokes. The MRI may also be performed on the heart if a cardiovascular disease is suspected.
A [[lumbar puncture]] may also be performed but this is an invasive test which consists in taking a sample of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] from the space surrounding the [[spinal cord]]. The purpose of this test is finding traces of blood which may be due to [[cerebral hemorrhage]].<ref>[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4649 Lumbar Puncture and Stroke] American Heart Association. Retrieved on 2010-02-12</ref>

Upon suspicion of [[peripheral vascular disease]], the first-line study is the [[ankle brachial pressure index]] (ABPI/ABI) which is a measure of the fall in blood pressure in the arteries supplying the legs. A ABPI value that exceeds 0.9 is the confirmation that a peripheral vascular disease is not present. If the value of the ABPI is lower than 0.8, the peripheral vascular disease exists but it is normally a mild case. On the other hand, a value below 0.5 is the proof of a serious vascular condition.
