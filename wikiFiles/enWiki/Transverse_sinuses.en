: ''For the transverse pericardial sinus, see: [[pericardial sinus]].''

The '''transverse sinuses''' (left and right lateral sinuses), within the human head, are two areas beneath the brain which allow blood to drain from the back of the head. They run laterally in a [[groove for transverse sinus|groove]] along the interior surface of the [[occipital bone]]. They drain from the [[confluence of sinuses]] (by the [[internal occipital protuberance]]) to the [[sigmoid sinuses]], which ultimately connect to the [[internal jugular vein]].  ''See diagram (at right)'': labeled under the brain as "<small>SIN. TRANS.</small>" (for Latin: ''sinus transversus'').

The transverse sinuses are of large size and begin at the [[internal occipital protuberance]]; one, generally the right, being the direct continuation of the [[superior sagittal sinus]], the other of the [[straight sinus]].

Each transverse sinus passes lateralward and forward, describing a slight curve with its convexity upward, to the base of the [[petrous portion]] of the [[temporal bone]], and lies, in this part of its course, in the attached margin of the [[tentorium cerebelli]]; it then leaves the tentorium and curves downward and medialward (an area sometimes referred to as the [[sigmoid sinus]]) to reach the [[jugular foramen]], where it ends in the [[internal jugular vein]].

In its course it rests upon the [[squama]] of the [[Occipital bone|occipital]], the [[mastoid angle]] of the [[Parietal bone|parietal]], the [[mastoid part]] of the [[Temporal bone|temporal]], and, just before its termination, the [[jugular process]] of the [[Occiput|occipital]]; the portion which occupies the groove on the mastoid part of the temporal is sometimes termed the [[sigmoid sinus]].

The transverse sinuses are frequently of unequal size, with the one formed by the [[superior sagittal sinus]] being the larger; they increase in size as they proceed, from back to center.

On transverse section, the horizontal portion exhibits a prismatic form, the curved portion has a semicylindrical form.

They receive the blood from the superior petrosal sinuses at the base of the petrous portion of the [[temporal bone]]; they communicate with the veins of the [[pericranium]] by means of the [[mastoid]] and [[condyloid]] [[emissary vein]]s; and they receive some of the [[inferior cerebral]] and [[inferior cerebellar vein]]s, and some veins from the [[diploÃ«]].

The [[petrosquamous sinus]], when present, runs backward along the junction of the squama and petrous portion of the temporal, and opens into the transverse sinus.
