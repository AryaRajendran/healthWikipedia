'''Matthias Eugen Oscar Liebreich''' (14 February 1839 – 2 July 1908) was a German [[pharmacologist]].

==Biography==
He was a native of [[Königsberg]]. He studied chemistry under [[Carl Remigius Fresenius]] (1818–1897) in [[Wiesbaden]], and studied medicine in [[Königsberg]], [[Tübingen]] and [[Berlin]], achieving his degree in 1865. Beginning in 1867 he worked as an assistant in the [[chemistry]] department of the [[pathology|pathological]] institute under [[Rudolf Virchow]]. Later he became professor of therapeutics (1868) and director of the Pharmacology Institute in Berlin (1872). In 1889 he co-founded the ''Balneologischen Gesellschaft'' ([[Balneology]] Society) in Berlin, and was its chairman until his death in 1908.

==Contributions==
Liebreich introduced the method of phaneroscopic illumination for the study of [[lupus]]; showed the value of [[cantharidin]] in [[tuberculosis]], of mercuric formamide and of [[lanolin]] in [[syphilis]], of butylchloral hydrate and of ethylene chloride<ref group="note">The modern chemical which has anesthetic properties which is referred to as ethylene chloride is [[vinyl chloride]], which is toxic.</ref> as [[anesthetic]]s. In 1865, he gave the name protagon to a proximate principle discovered in the brain and in [[blood corpuscle]]s.

He is well known for his investigations of the sedative and hypnotic properties of [[chloral hydrate]] (1869), and was a major figure concerning the drugs' popularity in the latter half of the 19th century. He also made important contributions in his chemical research of [[boracic acid]].

Liebreich edited the ''Therapeutische Monatshefte'' (1887 sqq.) and the ''Encyklopädie der Therapie'' (1895 sqq.), and with Alexander Langgard published a ''Kompendium der Arzneiverordnung'' (5th ed. 1902).

==Family==
He was a younger brother of [[ophthalmologist]] [[Richard Liebreich]] (1830–1917).
