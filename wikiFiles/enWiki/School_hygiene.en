== History of school hygiene ==
School hygiene expert Fletcher B. Dresslar explained in his 1915 work ''School Hygiene'' that “School Hygiene is the branch of this science [hygiene] which has to do with the conservation and development of the health of school children.”<ref name = "Dresslar1">{{cite book|title=School hygiene|first1=Fletcher B.|last1=Dresslar|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_FkWAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=school+hygiene&hl=en&ei=wB1-Tqy-DsXRiALg1dW6Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=1|publisher=The MacMillan Company|year=1913|location=New York}}</ref> The school was looked upon as existing “not only for the welfare of each child in attendance, but also for the welfare of the state and the nation.”<ref name = "Dresslar2">{{cite book|title=School hygiene|first1=Fletcher B.|last1=Dresslar|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_FkWAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=school+hygiene&hl=en&ei=wB1-Tqy-DsXRiALg1dW6Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=2|publisher=The MacMillan Company|year=1913|location=New York}}</ref> Dresslar broke school hygiene up into two essential parts: “the physical environment of the child during his school life” and “the laws of mental hygiene as illustrated by the proper adjustment of the subjects of the curriculum to the mental powers and needs of the children.”<ref name = "Dresslar3">{{cite book|title=School hygiene|first1=Fletcher B.|last1=Dresslar|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_FkWAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=school+hygiene&hl=en&ei=wB1-Tqy-DsXRiALg1dW6Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=3|publisher=The MacMillan Company|year=1913|location=New York}}</ref> 

School hygiene as a major discipline was at its zenith in the United States and England in the late 19th and early 20th century, with major works of the subject being offered by various authors, among them Sir Arthur Newsholme,<ref name = "newsholme1">{{cite book|title=School hygiene: the laws of health in relation to school life|first1=Arthur|last1=Newsholme|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iZ4WAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=school+hygiene&hl=en&ei=rh9-Tq2cOoHgiALp-dy5Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Swan Sonnenschein and Co.|year=1898|location=London}}</ref> Edward R.

Schools can determine children's health and well-being by their exposure to a healthy or unhealthy school environment.<ref name="unicef">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/wash/index_schools.html|title=Water, Sanitation and Hygiene |date=19 July 2010|work=unicef.org|publisher=UNICEF Unite for children |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref> There are lot of architectural and aesthetic aspects related to a school's hygienic needs, such as: school's building plan, safe water supply, disposition of waste, emergency lighting, heating and ventilation, as well as adequate school facilities (halls, classrooms, and common areas) and furniture.

=== School location ===
Due to health reasons (influence of noise, exhaust gases from vehicles, and potential risk of accident), schools in an urban and suburban areas should be located more than 100 meters away from major traffic and causeways.<ref name="higijena" /> Some studies suggest it is best to orientate and design a school building so that [[sunlight|natural light]] can be a part of the lighting scheme of the school, and that buildings should avoid being placed in a [[valley]], due to air quality issues.<ref name="higijena" />

== Importance of school hygiene ==
Schools have a central place in the health of a community. Inappropriate hygiene in schools can cause many diseases. If there are no school sanitation and hygiene facilities, or if they aren't maintained and used adequately, schools become places where diseases are likely transmitted.<ref name="unicef2">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/wash/files/Sch_e.pdf|title=A Manual on School Sanitation and Hygiene|date=September 1998 |work=unicef.org|publisher=UNICEF/Programme Division|pages=1–2|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>
