'''Acute bronchitis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the large [[bronchus|bronchi]] (medium-size airways) in the [[lung]]s that is usually caused by [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]] and may last several days or weeks.<ref name="pmid17108344">{{cite journal |author=Wenzel RP, Fowler AA |title=Clinical practice. Acute bronchitis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=355 |issue=20 |pages=2125–30 |year=2006 |pmid=17108344 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp061493}}</ref> Characteristic symptoms include [[cough]], [[sputum]] (phlegm) production, and shortness of breath and wheezing related to the obstruction of the inflamed airways. Diagnosis is by clinical examination and sometimes [[microbiology|microbiological]] examination of the phlegm. Treatment for acute bronchitis is typically symptomatic. As viruses cause most cases of acute bronchitis, [[antibiotic]]s should not be used unless microscopic examination of [[Gram stain|gram-stained]] sputum reveals large numbers of bacteria.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bronchitis may be indicated by an [[expectorate|expectorating]] [[cough]], shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), and wheezing. On occasion, [[chest pain]]s, [[fever]], and [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] or [[malaise]] may also occur. In addition, bronchitis caused by [[Adenoviridae]] may cause systemic and gastrointestinal symptoms as well. However, the coughs due to bronchitis can continue for up to three weeks or more even after all other symptoms have subsided.

==Cause==
Acute bronchitis can be caused by contagious [[pathogen]]s, most commonly viruses. Typical viruses include [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|respiratory syncytial virus]], [[rhinovirus]], [[influenza]], and others. Bacteria are uncommon pathogens but may include ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', ''[[streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[haemophilus influenzae]]''.
*Damage caused by irritation of the airways leads to inflammation and leads to neutrophils infiltrating the lung tissue.
*Mucosal hypersecretion is promoted by a substance released by [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]].
*Further obstruction to the airways is caused by more [[goblet cells]] in the small airways. This is typical of [[chronic bronchitis]].
*Although infection is not the reason or cause of chronic bronchitis, it is seen to aid in sustaining the bronchitis.

==Diagnosis==
A [[physical examination]] will often reveal decreased intensity of breath sounds, wheezing,  [[rhonchi]], and prolonged [[Exhalation|expiration]].  Most physicians rely on the presence of a persistent dry or wet cough as evidence of bronchitis.

A variety of tests may be performed in patients presenting with cough and shortness of breath:
* A [[chest X-ray]] that reveals hyperinflation; collapse and consolidation of lung areas would support a diagnosis of [[pneumonia]]. Some conditions that predispose to bronchitis may be indicated by chest radiography.
* A sputum sample showing [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s (inflammatory white blood cells) and [[microbiological culture|culture]] showing that has pathogenic microorganisms such as [[Streptococcus|Streptococcus species]]
* A [[blood test]] would indicate inflammation (as indicated by a raised [[white blood cell]] count and elevated [[C-reactive protein]]).

==Prevention==
In 1985, [[University of Newcastle, Australia]] [[Professor Robert Clancy]] developed an oral vaccine for [[Haemophilus influenza]]. This vaccine was commercialised four years later.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clancy RL, Cripps AW, Gebski V|title=Protection against recurrent acute bronchitis after oral immunization with killed Haemophilus influenzae |journal=Med J Aust. |volume=152 |issue=8 |pages=413–6 |year=1990 |month=Apr |pmid=2184330 }}</ref>
==Treatment==
===Antibiotics===
Only about 5-10% of bronchitis cases are caused by a bacterial infection. Most cases of bronchitis are caused by a viral infection and are [[Self-limiting (biology)|self-limited]] and resolve themselves in a few weeks. Acute bronchitis should not be treated with antibiotics unless microscopic examination of the sputum reveals large numbers of bacteria. Treating non-bacterial illnesses with antibiotics leads to the promotion of [[antibiotic-resistant bacteria]], which increase morbidity and mortality.<ref name="Cough">{{cite journal | author = Hueston WJ | title = Antibiotics: neither cost effective nor 'cough' effective | journal = The Journal of Family Practice | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–5 | year = 1997 | month = March | pmid = 9071245 | accessdate = 2009-06-30 }}</ref>

===Smoking cessation===
{{details|Smoking cessation}}
Many physicians recommend that, to help the bronchial tree heal faster and not make bronchitis worse, [[tobacco smoking|smokers]] should quit smoking completely in order to allow their lungs to recover from the layer of tar that builds up over time.

===Antihistamines===
An effect of antihistamines is to thicken mucus secretions.  Expelling infected mucus via coughing can be beneficial in recovering from bronchitis.  Expulsion of the mucus may be hindered if it is thickened.  Antihistamines can help bacteria to persist <ref name="pmid21346365">{{cite journal |author=Metz M, Doyle E, Bindslev-Jensen C, Watanabe T, Zuberbier T, Maurer M.|title=Effects of Antihistamines on Innate Immune Responses to Severe Bacterial Infection in Mice|journal=Int Arch Allergy Immunol|volume=155|issue=4|pages=355–60 |year=2011|pmid=21346365|doi=10.1159/000321614}}</ref> and multiply in the lungs by increasing its [[residence time]] in a warm, moist environment of thickened mucus.

==Prognosis==
Acute bronchitis usually lasts a few days or weeks.<ref>{{Cite document | title = Bronchitis | publisher = Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research  | date = 2007-04-20 | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bronchitis/DS00031/DSECTION=1 | accessdate = 2008-05-30 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> It may accompany or closely follow a cold or the flu, or  may occur on its own. Bronchitis usually begins with a dry cough, including waking the sufferer at night. After a few days, it progresses to a wetter or productive cough, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, and headache. The fever, fatigue, and malaise may last only a few days; but the wet cough may last up to several weeks.

Should the cough last longer than a month, some doctors may issue a referral to an [[Otorhinolaryngology|otorhinolaryngologist]] (ear, nose and throat doctor) to see if a condition other than bronchitis is causing the irritation. It is possible that having irritated bronchial tubes for as long as a few months may inspire [[asthma]]tic conditions in some patients.

In addition, if one starts coughing  mucus tinged with blood, one should see a doctor. In rare cases, doctors may conduct tests to see whether the cause is a serious condition such as [[tuberculosis]] or [[lung cancer]].
