'''Lipoprotein lipase''' ('''LPL''') ({{EC number|3.1.1.34}}) is a member of the [[lipase]] gene family, which includes [[pancreatic lipase]], [[hepatic lipase]], and [[endothelial lipase]]. It is a water soluble [[enzyme]] that [[hydrolyze]]s [[triglyceride]]s in [[lipoprotein]]s, such as those found in [[chylomicron]]s and [[very low density lipoprotein|very low-density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL), into two free [[fatty acid]]s and one [[monoacylglycerol]] molecule.  It is also involved in promoting the cellular uptake of chylomicron remnants, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, and free fatty acids.<ref name="Mead-2002">{{cite journal | author = Mead JR, Irvine SA, Ramji DP | title = Lipoprotein lipase: structure, function, regulation, and role in disease | journal = J.

==Synthesis==

In brief, LPL is secreted from [[parenchymal cells]] as a [[glycosylation|glycosylated]] homodimer, after which it is translocated through the [[extracellular matrix]] and across endothelial cells to the capillary lumen. After translation, the newly synthesized protein is glycosylated in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. The glycosylation sites of LPL are Asn-43, Asn-257, and Asn-359.<ref name="Mead-2002" /> [[Glucosidases]] then remove terminal glucose residues; it is believed that this glucose trimming is responsible for the conformational change needed for LPL to form homodimers and become catalytically active.<ref name="Mead-2002" /><ref name="Braun-1992" /><ref name="Semb-1989">{{cite journal | author = Semb H, Olivecrona T | title = The relation between glycosylation and activity of guinea pig lipoprotein lipase | journal = J.

==Structure==

The [[crystal structure]] of LPL has not been discovered; however, there are substantial experimental evidence and [[structural homology, protein|structural homology]] between members of the lipase family to predict the likely structure and functional regions of the enzyme.<ref name="Wong-1994" /><ref name="McIlhargey-2003">{{cite journal | author = McIlhargey TL, Yang Y, Wong H, Hill JS | title = Identification of a lipoprotein lipase cofactor-binding site by chemical cross-linking and transfer of apolipoprotein C-II-responsive lipolysis from lipoprotein lipase to hepatic lipase | journal = J.

These two regions are attached by a peptide linker. The N-terminus domain has an [[alpha/beta hydrolase fold|α/β hydrolase fold]], which is a globular structure containing a central [[beta sheet|β sheet]] surrounded by [[alpha helix|α helices]]. The C-terminus domain is a β sandwich formed by two β sheet layers, and resembles an elongated cylinder.

Lid region blocking the active site is shown in dark blue. Triglyceride binds to the C-terminal domain and the lid region, inducing a conformation change in LPL to make the active site accessible.]]
The active site of LPL is composed of the conserved Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241 triad. Other important regions of the N-terminal domain for catalysis includes an [[oxyanion hole]] (Trp-55, Leu-133), a lid region (residues 216-239), as well as a β5 loop (residues 54-64).<ref name="Mead-2002" /><ref name="Wang-1992" /><ref name="Wong-1994" /> The ApoC-II binding site is currently unknown, but it is predicted that residues on both N-and C-terminal domains are necessary for this interaction to occur. The C-terminal domain appears to confer LPL’s substrate specificity; it has a higher affinity for large triacylglyceride-rich lipoproteins than cholesterol-rich lipoproteins.<ref name="Lookene-2000">{{cite journal | author = Lookene A, Nielsen MS, Gliemann J, Olivecrona G | title = Contribution of the carboxy-terminal domain of lipoprotein lipase to interaction with heparin and lipoproteins | journal = Biochem.

The LPL non-covalent homodimer has a head-to-tail arrangement of the monomers. The Ser/Asp/His triad is contained in a hydrophobic groove that is blocked from solvent by the lid.<ref name="Mead-2002" /><ref name="Wang-1992" /> Upon binding to ApoC-II and lipid in the lipoprotein, the C-terminal domain presents the lipid substrate to the lid region. The lipid interacts with both the lid region and the hydrophobic groove at the active site; this causes the lid to move, providing access to the active site. The β5 loop folds back into the protein core, bringing one of the electrophiles of the oxyanion hole into position for lipolysis.<ref name="Mead-2002" /> The [[glycerol]] backbone of the lipid is then able to enter the active site and is hydrolyzed.

Two molecules of ApoC-II can attach to each LPL dimer.<ref name="McIlhargey-2003" /> It is estimated that up to forty LPL dimers may act simultaneously on a single lipoprotein.<ref name="Mead-2002" /> In regard to kinetics, it is believed that release of product into circulation is the [[rate-limiting step]] in the reaction.<ref name="Wang-1992" />

== Function ==

LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed on endothelial cells in the heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Through catalysis, VLDL is converted to [[Intermediate-density lipoprotein|IDL]] and then to LDL. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: LPL lipoprotein lipase| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=4023| accessdate = }}</ref>

==Regulation==

LPL [[isozymes]] are regulated differently depending on the tissue. For example, [[insulin]] is known to activate LPL in [[adipocytes]] and its placement in the capillary endothelium.  By contrast, insulin has been shown to decrease expression of muscle LPL.<ref name="pmid2677048">{{cite journal | author = Kiens B, Lithell H, Mikines KJ, Richter EA | title = Effects of insulin and exercise on muscle lipoprotein lipase activity in man and its relation to insulin action | journal = J. Clin. Invest. | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 1124–9 | year = 1989 | month = October | pmid = 2677048 | pmc = 329768 | doi = 10.1172/JCI114275 | url =  }}</ref> Muscle and [[myocardium|myocardial]] LPL is instead activated by glucagon and adrenaline. This helps to explain why during fasting, LPL activity increases in muscle tissue and decreases in adipose tissue, whereas after a meal, the opposite occurs.<ref name="Mead-2002" /><ref name="Braun-1992" /> 

Consistent with this, dietary macronutrients differentially affect adipose and muscle LPL activity. After 16 days on a high-carbohydrate or a high-fat diet, LPL activity increased significantly in both tissues 6 hours after a meal of either composition, but there was a significantly greater rise in adipose tissue LPL in response to the high-carbohydrate diet compared to the high-fat diet. There was no difference between the two diets' effects on  or insulin sensitivity, or on fasting LPL activity in either tissue.<ref name=Yost>{{cite journal | author = Yost TJ, Jensen DR, Haugen BR, Eckel RH | title = Effect of dietary macronutrient composition on tissue-specific lipoprotein lipase activity and insulin action in normal-weight subjects | journal = Am.

The concentration of LPL displayed on endothelial cell surface cannot be regulated by endothelial cells, as they neither synthesize nor degrade LPL. Instead, this regulation occurs by managing the flux of LPL arriving at the lipolytic site and being released into circulation attached to lipoproteins.<ref name="Braun-1992" /><ref name="Goldberg-1996">{{cite journal | author = Goldberg IJ | title = Lipoprotein lipase and lipolysis: central roles in lipoprotein metabolism and atherogenesis | journal = J. Lipid Res. | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 693–707 | year = 1996 | month = April | pmid = 8732771 | doi =  }}</ref> The typical concentration of LPL in plasma is in the nanomolar range.<ref name="Medh-1996" />

==Pathology==
[[Lipoprotein lipase deficiency]] leads to [[hypertriglyceridemia]] (elevated levels of [[triglyceride]]s in the bloodstream).<ref name="pmid17706445">{{cite journal | author = Okubo M, Horinishi A, Saito M, Ebara T, Endo Y, Kaku K, Murase T, Eto M | title = A novel complex deletion-insertion mutation mediated by Alu repetitive elements leads to lipoprotein lipase deficiency | journal = Mol.

A high tissue LPL response to a high-carbohydrate diet may predispose toward fat gain. One study reported that subjects gained more body fat over the next four years if, after following a high-carbohydrate diet and partaking of a high-carbohydrate meal, they responded with an increase in adipose tissue LPL activity per adipocyte, or a decrease in skeletal muscle LPL activity per gram of tissue.<ref name=Ferland,2012>{{cite journal | author = Ferland A, Château-Degat ML, Hernandez TL, Eckel RH | title = Tissue-specific responses of lipoprotein lipase to dietary macronutrient composition as a predictor of weight gain over 4 years | journal = Obesity (Silver Spring) | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 1006–11 | year = 2012 | month = May | pmid = 22262159 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2011.372 }}</ref>
