'''Brodmann area 47''', or BA47, is part of the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] in the [[human brain]]. Curving from the lateral surface of the frontal lobe into the ventral (orbital) frontal cortex. It is below areas [[Brodmann area 10|BA10]] and [[Brodmann area 45|BA45]], and beside [[Brodmann area 11|BA11]].

This area is also known as '''orbital area 47'''. In the human, on the orbital surface it surrounds the caudal portion of the [[orbital sulcus]] (H) from which it extends laterally into the orbital part of [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (H). [[cytoarchitecture|Cytoarchitectonically]] it is bounded caudally by the [[triangular area 45]], medially by the [[prefrontal area 11]] of Brodmann-1909, and rostrally by the [[frontopolar area 10]] (Brodmann-1909).  

It incorporates the region that Brodmann identified as "Area 12" in the monkey, and therefore, following the suggestion of [[Michael Petrides]], some contemporary neuroscientists refer to the region as "BA47/12."  

BA47 has been implicated in the processing of [[syntax]] in oral and sign languages, and more recently in musical syntax.
