'''Endophthalmitis''' is an inflammation of the internal coats of the [[human eye|eye]]. It is a possible complication of all [[eye surgery|intraocular surgeries]], particularly [[cataract surgery]], with possible [[vision loss|loss of vision]] and the eye itself. Infectious etiology is the most common and various bacteria and fungi have been isolated as the cause of the endophthalmitis. Other causes include penetrating trauma and retained intraocular foreign bodies.

==Signs and symptoms==
In cases of endophthalmitis, one usually finds a history of recent intraocular surgery or penetrating ocular trauma. In some cases of metastatic endophthalmitis—particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with [[diabetes]]—the spread of infection may have been hematogenous (via the blood-stream).

Endophthalmitis is usually accompanied by severe pain, loss of vision, and redness of the [[conjunctiva]] and the underlying [[episclera]]. Also present are signs of inflammation of the various coats of the eye. [[Hypopyon]] can be present in endophthalmitis and should be looked for on examination by a [[slit lamp]].

An eye exam may indicated in severe forms of [[candidiasis]].  1-3% of cases of candidal blood infections include endophthalmitis.

==Treatment==
The patient needs urgent examination by an [[ophthalmologist]] and/or vitreo-retina specialist who will usually decide for urgent intervention to provide intravitreal injection of potent antibiotics and also prepare for an urgent pars plana [[vitrectomy]] as needed. [[Enucleation of the Eye|Enucleation]] may be required to remove a blind and painful eye.
