'''Malignant hyperthermia''' ('''MH''') or '''malignant hyperpyrexia'''<ref name=Rosen2007>{{cite journal |author=Rosenberg H, Davis M, James D, Pollock N, Stowell K |title=Malignant hyperthermia |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=2 |issue= |pages=21 |year=2007 |pmid=17456235 |pmc=1867813 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-21 |url=}}</ref> is a rare life-threatening condition that is usually triggered by exposure to certain drugs used for [[general anesthesia]], specifically the [[volatile anesthetic]] agents and the [[Neuromuscular-blocking drug|neuromuscular blocking agent]], [[succinylcholine]]. In susceptible individuals, these drugs can induce a drastic and uncontrolled increase in [[skeletal muscle]] [[oxidative metabolism]], which overwhelms the body's capacity to supply [[oxygen]], remove [[carbon dioxide]], and regulate [[body temperature]], eventually leading to [[blood circulation|circulatory]] collapse and death if not treated quickly.

Susceptibility to MH is often inherited as an [[autosomal dominant]] disorder, for which there are at least 6 genetic loci of interest,<ref name="Litman_2005"/> most prominently the [[ryanodine receptor]] gene (''RYR1''). MH susceptibility is phenotypically and genetically related to [[central core disease]] (CCD), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized both by MH symptoms and [[myopathy]]. MH is usually revealed by anesthesia, or when a family member develops the symptoms. There is no simple, straightforward test to diagnose the condition. When MH develops during a procedure, treatment with [[dantrolene|dantrolene sodium]] is usually initiated; dantrolene and the avoidance of anesthesia in susceptible people have markedly reduced the mortality from this condition.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Classification==
This condition is known by a number of names, including malignant hyperthermia (MH), malignant hyperthermia syndrome (MHS), and malignant hyperpyrexia.<ref name=Rosen2007/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical symptoms of malignant hyperthermia are due to a [[hypermetabolism|hypercatabolic]] state, which presents as [[hyperpyrexia|a very high temperature]], [[tachycardia|an increased heart rate]] and [[tachypnea|breathing rate]], increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, [[acidosis]], [[muscle rigidity|rigid muscles]], and [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name=Rosen2007/>

The symptoms usually develop within one hour after exposure to trigger substances, but may even occur several hours later in rare instances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Causes==
Malignant hyperthermia is most commonly due to volatile anesthetic gases, such as [[halothane]], [[sevoflurane]], [[desflurane]], [[isoflurane]], [[enflurane]] or the depolarizing muscle relaxants [[suxamethonium]] and [[decamethonium]] used primarily in general anesthesia.<ref name=Rosen2007/>   Other drugs that have been suspected of causing MH include [[ketamine]], [[catecholamines]], [[phenothiazines]], and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]].  There are also few reports of MH being triggered by nitrous oxide administration.

Other anesthetic drugs are considered safe.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} These include local anesthetics ([[lidocaine]], [[bupivicaine]], [[mepivacaine]]), opiates ([[morphine]], [[fentanyl]]),  [[ketamine]], [[barbiturates]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[propofol]], [[etomidate]], [[benzodiazepines]].  

The nondepolarizing muscle relaxants [[pancuronium]], [[cisatracurium]], [[atracurium]], [[mivacurium]], [[vecuronium]] and [[rocuronium]] also do not cause MH.

===Genetics===
Malignant hyperthermia's inheritance is [[autosomal dominant]].<ref name=Rosen2007/> The defect is typically located on the long arm of [[chromosome 19 (human)|chromosome 19]] (19q13.1) involving the [[ryanodine receptor]].<ref name=Rosen2007/> More than 25 different mutations in this gene are linked with malignant hyperthermia.<ref name=Rosen2007/> These mutations tend to cluster in one of three domains within the protein, designated MH1-3. MH1 and MH2 are located in the N-terminus of the protein, which interacts with L-type calcium channels and {{chem|Ca|2+}}. MH3 is located in the transmembrane forming C-terminus. This region is important for allowing {{chem|Ca|2+}} passage through the protein following opening.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Chromosome 7q and chromosome 17 have also been implicated.  It has also been postulated that MH and [[central core disease]] may be allelic and thus can be co-inherited.

==Pathophysiology==
===Disease mechanism===
In a large proportion (50–70%) of cases, the propensity for malignant hyperthermia is due to a [[mutation]] of the [[ryanodine receptor]] (type 1), located on the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (SR), the [[organelle]] within [[skeletal muscle]] cells that stores [[calcium in biology|calcium]].<ref name="Gillard_1991">{{cite journal | author = Gillard E, Otsu K, Fujii J, Khanna V, de Leon S, Derdemezi J, Britt B, Duff C, Worton R, MacLennan D | title = A substitution of cysteine for arginine 614 in the ryanodine receptor is potentially causative of human malignant hyperthermia | journal = Genomics | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 751–5 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1774074 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(91)90084-R}}</ref><ref name="Galli_2006">{{cite journal | author = Galli L, Orrico A, Lorenzini S, Censini S, Falciani M, Covacci A, Tegazzin V, Sorrentino V | title = Frequency and localization of mutations in the 106 exons of the RYR1 gene in 50 individuals with malignant hyperthermia | journal = Hum Mutat | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 830 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16835904 | doi = 10.1002/humu.9442}}</ref> RYR1 opens in response to increases in intracellular {{chem|link=Calcium|Ca|2+}} level mediated by L-type [[calcium channel]]s, thereby resulting in a drastic increase in intracellular calcium levels and muscle contraction. RYR1 has two sites believed to be important for reacting to changing {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentrations: the A-site and the I-site. The A-site is a high [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] {{chem|Ca|2+}} binding site that mediates RYR1 opening. The I-site is a lower affinity site that mediates the protein's closing. [[Caffeine]], halothane, and other triggering agents act by drastically increasing the affinity of the A-site for {{chem|Ca|2+}} and concomitantly decreasing the affinity of the I-site in mutant proteins. {{chem|Mg|2+}} also affect RYR1 activity, causing the protein to close by acting at either the A- or I-sites. In MH mutant proteins, the affinity for {{chem|Mg|2+}} at either one of these sites is greatly reduced. The end result of these alterations is greatly increased {{chem|Ca|2+}} release due to a lowered activation and heightened deactivation threshold.<ref name="Balog_2001">{{cite journal | author = Balog E, Fruen B, Shomer N, Louis C | title = Divergent effects of the malignant hyperthermia-susceptible Arg(615)-->Cys mutation on the Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) dependence of the RyR1 | journal = Biophys J | volume = 81 | issue = 4 | pages = 2050–8 | year = 2001 | pmid=11566777 | url=http://www.biophysj.org/cgi/content/full/81/4/2050 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75854-7 | pmc = 1301678 | bibcode=2001BpJ....81.2050B}}</ref><ref name="Yang_2003">{{cite journal | author = Yang T, Ta T, Pessah I, Allen P | title = Functional defects in six ryanodine receptor isoform-1 (RyR1) mutations associated with malignant hyperthermia and their impact on skeletal excitation-contraction coupling | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 278 | issue = 28 | pages = 25722–30 | year = 2003 | pmid= 12732639 | url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/278/28/25722 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M302165200}}</ref> The process of sequestering this excess {{chem|Ca|2+}} consumes large amounts of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the main cellular energy carrier, and generates the excessive heat (hyperthermia) that is the hallmark of the disease.

The other known causative gene for MH is ''CACNA1S'', which encodes an [[L-type calcium channel|L-type]] [[voltage-gated calcium channel]] α-subunit. There are two known mutations in this protein, both affecting the same residue, R1086.<ref name="Monnier_1997">{{cite journal | author = Monnier N, Procaccio V, Stieglitz P, Lunardi J | title = Malignant-hyperthermia susceptibility is associated with a mutation of the alpha 1-subunit of the human dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type voltage-dependent calcium-channel receptor in skeletal muscle | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 1316–25 | year = 1997 | pmid=9199552 | doi = 10.1086/515454 | pmc = 1716149}}</ref><ref name="unknown">The R1086C mutant has never been published, but has nevertheless been referenced multiple times in the literature, e.g. {{cite journal | author = Jurkat-Rott K, McCarthy T, Lehmann-Horn F | title = Genetics and pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia | journal = Muscle Nerve | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–17 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10590402 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(200001)23:1<4::AID-MUS3>3.0.CO;2-D}}</ref> This residue is located in the large intracellular loop connecting domains 3 and 4, a domain possibly involved in negatively regulating RYR1 activity. When these mutant channels are expressed in human embryonic kidney ([[HEK cell|HEK 293]])  cells, the resulting channels are five times more sensitive to activation by caffeine (and presumably halothane) and activate at 5–10mV more hyperpolarized. Furthermore, cells expressing these channels have an increased basal cytosolic {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentration. As these channels interact with and activate RYR1, these alterations result in a drastic increase of intracellular {{chem|Ca|2+}}, and, thereby, muscle excitability.<ref name="Weiss_2004">{{cite journal | author = Weiss R, O'Connell K, Flucher B, Allen P, Grabner M, Dirksen R | title = Functional analysis of the R1086H malignant hyperthermia mutation in the DHPR reveals an unexpected influence of the III-IV loop on skeletal muscle EC coupling | journal = Am J Physiol Cell Physiol | volume = 287 | issue = 4 | pages = C1094–102 | year = 2004 | pmid=15201141 |url=http://ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/287/4/C1094 | doi = 10.1152/ajpcell.00173.2004}}</ref>

Other mutations causing MH have been identified, although in most cases the relevant gene remains to be identified.<ref name="Litman_2005"/>

===Animal model===
Research into malignant hyperthermia was limited until the discovery of "porcine stress syndrome" (PSS) in [[Danish Landrace]] and other [[pig]] breeds selected for muscling, a condition in which stressed pigs develop [[PSE meat|"pale, soft, exudative" flesh]] (a manifestation of the effects of malignant hyperthermia) rendering their meat less marketable at slaughter. This "awake triggering" was not observed in humans, and initially cast doubts on the value of the animal model, but subsequently, susceptible humans were discovered to "awake trigger" (develop malignant hyperthermia) in stressful situations. This supported the use of the pig model for research. Pig farmers use halothane cones in swine yards to expose piglets to halothane. Those that die were MH-susceptible, thus saving the farmer the expense of raising a pig whose meat he would not be able to market.  This also reduced the use of breeding stock carrying the genes for PSS.  The condition in swine is also due to a defect in ryanodine receptors.<ref>

An MH mouse has been constructed, bearing the R163C mutation prevalent in humans. These mice display symptoms similar to human MH patients, including sensitivity to halothane (increased respiration, body temperature, and death). Blockade of RYR1 by [[dantrolene]] prevents adverse reaction to halothane in these mice, as with humans. Muscle from these mice also shows increased {{chem|K|+}}-induced depolarization and an increased caffeine sensitivity.<ref name="Yang_2006">{{cite journal |author=Yang T |title=Pharmacologic and functional characterization of malignant hyperthermia in the R163C RyR1 knock-in mouse |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1164–75 |year=2006 |pmid=17122579 |url=http://www.anesthesiology.org/pt/re/anes/fulltext.00000542-200612000-00016.htm |doi=10.1097/00000542-200612000-00016 |author-separator=, |author2=Riehl J |author3=Esteve E |display-authors=3 |last4=Matthaei |first4=Klaus I. |last5=Goth |first5=Samuel |last6=Allen |first6=Paul D. |last7=Pessah |first7=Isaac N. |last8=Lopez |first8=Jos??

==Diagnosis==
===During an attack===
The earliest signs are early masseter muscle contracture following administration of succinylcholine, a rise in [[Hypercapnia|end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration]] (despite increased minute ventilation), unexplained tachycardia, and muscle rigidity.<ref name=Rosen2007/>  Despite the name, elevation of body temperature is often a late sign. Other signs may include acidosis, [[tachypnea]] (in a spontaneously breathing patient), cyanosis, hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias and [[hyperkalemia]]. Core body temperatures should be measured in any patient undergoing general anesthesia longer than 20 minutes.

Malignant hyperthermia is diagnosed on clinical grounds, but various investigations are generally performed. This includes [[blood test]]s, which may show a raised creatine kinase level, elevated potassium, increased phosphate (leading to decreased calcium) and—if determined—raised myoglobin; this is the result of damage to muscle cells. [[Metabolic acidosis]] and [[respiratory acidosis]] (raised acidity of the blood) may both occur. Severe rhabdomyolysis may lead to [[acute renal failure]], so [[renal function|kidney function]] is generally measured on a frequent basis.  Patients may also get cardiac arrythmias (PVCs) due to the increased levels of potassium released from the muscles during episodes.  {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Susceptibility testing===
In those who have experienced an episode of MH, further testing is not usually useful, as even a normal test does not mean there is no risk of recurrence. The exception would be if it is unclear whether the initial attack was due to a different medical problem, such as [[sepsis]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

====Muscle testing====
The main candidates for testing are those with a close relative who has suffered an episode of MH or has been shown to be susceptible. The standard procedure is the "caffeine-halothane contracture test", CHCT. A muscle [[biopsy]] is carried out at an approved research center, under local anesthesia. The fresh biopsy is bathed in solutions containing caffeine or halothane and observed for contraction; under good conditions, the [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] is 97% and the [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] 78%.<ref name="Allen_1998">{{cite journal | author = Allen G, Larach M, Kunselman A | title = The sensitivity and specificity of the caffeine-halothane contracture test: a report from the North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 88 | issue = 3 | pages = 579–88 | year = 1998 | pmid= 9523799 | url = http://www.anesthesiology.org/pt/re/anes/fulltext.00000542-199803000-00006.htm | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199803000-00006}}</ref> Negative biopsies are ''not'' definitive, so any patient who is suspected of MH by their medical history or that of blood relatives is generally treated with nontriggering anesthetics, even if the biopsy was negative. Some researchers advocate the use of the "calcium-induced calcium release" test in addition to the CHCT to make the test more specific.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Less invasive diagnostic techniques have been proposed. Intramuscular injection of halothane 6 vol% has been shown to result in higher than normal increases in local {{chem|link=pCO2|pCO|2}} among patients with known malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 75%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study, this leads to a [[positive predictive value]] of 80% and [[negative predictive value]] of 100%. This method may provide a suitable alternative to more invasive techniques.<ref name="pmid17697213">{{cite journal |author=Schuster F, Gardill A, Metterlein T, Kranke P, Roewer N, Anetseder M |title=A minimally invasive metabolic test with intramuscular injection of halothane 5 and 6 vol% to detect probands at risk for malignant hyperthermia |journal=Anaesthesia |volume=62 |issue=9 |pages=882–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17697213 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2007.05173.x }}</ref> 
A 2002 study examined another possible metabolic test. In this test, intramuscular injection of caffeine was followed by local measurement of the {{chem|pCO|2}}; those with known MH susceptibility had a significantly higher {{chem|pCO|2}} (63 versus 44 mmHg). The authors propose larger studies to assess the test's suitability for determining MH risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anetseder M, Hager M, Müller CR, Roewer N |title=Diagnosis of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia by use of a metabolic test |journal=Lancet |volume=359 |issue=9317 |pages=1579–80 |year=2002 |pmid=12047971 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08506-9}}</ref>

====Genetic testing====
[[Genetic testing]] is being performed in a limited fashion to determine susceptibility to MH.<ref name=Rosen2007/> In people with a family history of MH, analysis for ''RYR1'' mutations maybe useful.<ref name="Litman_2005">{{cite journal | author = Litman R, Rosenberg H | title = Malignant hyperthermia: update on susceptibility testing | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | issue = 23 | pages = 2918–24 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15956637 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.23.2918}}</ref>

===Criteria===
A 1994 consensus conference led to the formulation of a set of diagnostic criteria. The higher the score (above 6), the more likely a reaction constituted MH:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Larach MG |title=A clinical grading scale to predict malignant hyperthermia susceptibility |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=771–9 |year=1994 |pmid=8024130 |doi=10.1097/00000542-199404000-00008 |author-separator=, |author2=Localio AR |author3=Allen GC |display-authors=3 |last4=Denborough |first4=Michael A. |last5=Ellis |first5=F Richard |last6=Gronert |first6=Gerald A. |last7=Kaplan |first7=Richard F. |last8=Muldoon |first8=Sheila M. |last9=Nelson |first9=Thomas E.}}</ref>
* Respiratory acidosis (end-tidal {{chem|CO|2}} above 55 mmHg/7.32 kPa or arterial {{chem|pCO|2}} above 60 mmHg/7.98 kPa)
* Heart involvement (unexplained [[sinus tachycardia]], [[ventricular tachycardia]] or [[ventricular fibrillation]])
* Metabolic acidosis (base excess lower than -8, pH <7.25)
* Muscle rigidity (generalized rigidity including severe masseter muscle rigidity)
* Muscle breakdown (CK >20,000/L units, cola colored urine or excess myoglobin in urine or serum, potassium above 6&nbsp;mmol/l)
* Temperature increase (rapidly increasing temperature, T >38.8°C)
* Other (rapid reversal of MH signs with dantrolene, elevated resting serum CK levels)
* Family history (autosomal dominant pattern)

==Prevention==
In the past, the [[prophylactic]] use of dantrolene was recommended for MH susceptible patients undergoing general anesthesia.<ref name=Krause/> However, multiple retrospective studies have demonstrated the safety of trigger-free general anesthesia in these patients in the absence of prophylactic dantrolene administration. The largest of these studies looked at the charts of 2214 patients who underwent general or [[regional anesthesia]] for an elective muscle biopsy. About half (1082) of the patients were muscle biopsy positive for MH. Only five of these patients exhibited symptoms consistent with MH, four of which were treated successfully with [[parenteral]] dantrolene, and the remaining one recovered with only symptomatic therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carr AS, Lerman J, Cunliffe M, McLeod ME, Britt BA |title=Incidence of malignant hyperthermia reactions in 2,214 patients undergoing muscle biopsy |journal=Can J Anaesth |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=281–6 |year=1995 |pmid=7788824 |doi=10.1007/BF03010703}}</ref> After weighing its questionable benefits against its possible adverse effects (including nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and prolonged duration of action of nondepolarising neuromuscular blocking agents<ref name=Halsall_2003/>), experts no longer recommend the use of prophylactic dantrolene prior to trigger-free general anesthesia in MH susceptible patients.<ref name=Krause/>

Anaesthesia for known MH susceptible patients requires avoidance of triggering agents (all volatile anaesthetic agents and succinylcholine). All other drugs are safe (including nitrous oxide), as are regional anaesthetic techniques. Where general anaesthesia is planned, it can be provided safely by removing vaporisers from the anaesthetic machine, placing a new breathing circuit on the machine, flushing the machine and ventilator with 100% oxygen at maximal gas flows for 20–30 minutes, and inducing and maintaining anaesthesia with nontriggering agents (e.g.: propofol).<ref name=Halsall_2003/>  Modern anaesthetic machines have more rubber and plastic components which provide a reservoir for volatile anaesthetics, and should be flushed for 60 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Kim Tae W., Nemergut, ME |title=Preparation of Modern Anesthesia Workstations for Malignant Hyperthermia–susceptible Patients: A Review of Past and Present Practice |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=205–212 |year=2011 |doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181ee2cb7 |pmid= 21169802}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Image:Dantrolene.svg|right|thumb|Dantrolene sodium, the only available medical treatment for malignant hyperthermia]]
The current treatment of choice is the intravenous administration of [[dantrolene]], the only known antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia.<ref name=Halsall_2003>{{cite journal|author=Halsall PJ, Hopkins PM |title=Malignant hyperthermia |journal=Continuing Education in Anaethesia, Critical Care and Pain |volume=3| issue=1 |pages=5–9| year=2003 |doi=10.1093/bjacepd/mkg002 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/1/5}}</ref>

Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that appears to work directly on the ryanodine receptor to prevent the release of calcium.
After the widespread introduction of treatment with dantrolene, the mortality of malignant hyperthermia fell from 80% in the 1960s to less than 10%. Dantrolene remains the only drug known to be effective in the treatment of MH.<ref name=Krause>{{cite journal |author=Krause T, Gerbershagen MU, Fiege M, Weisshorn R, Wappler F |title=Dantrolene--a review of its pharmacology, therapeutic use and new developments |journal=Anaesthesia |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=364–73 |year=2004 |pmid=15023108 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2004.03658.x | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2004.03658.x}}</ref>

Its clinical use has been limited by its low [[water solubility]], leading to requirements of large fluid volumes, which may complicate clinical management. [[Azumolene]] is a 30-fold more water-soluble [[Analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of dantrolene that also works to decrease the release of intracellular calcium by its action on the ryanodine receptor. In MH susceptible swine, azumolene was as potent as dantrolene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dershwitz M, Sréter FA |title=Azumolene reverses episodes of malignant hyperthermia in susceptible swine |journal=Anesth. Analg. |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=253–5 |year=1990 |pmid=2305975|doi=10.1213/00000539-199003000-00004}}</ref> It has yet to be studied ''in vivo'' in humans, but may present a suitable alternative to dantrolene in the treatment of MH.

Research in mouse models suggests that azumolene "is likely uncoupling the efficiency of a {{chem|Ca|2+}}-dependent RyR1 signal coupled directly or indirectly to the [store-operated calcium entry] machinery." There may be two different pathways of store-operated calcium entry: one, RyR1-reliant and the other, RyR1-non-reliant (see Disease Mechanism section above for RyR1 description). Furthermore, elucidating earlier ideas on the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia, researchers point out that it may be "as much a syndrome of exaggerated {{chem|Ca|2+}} entry as it is of exaggerated {{chem|Ca|2+}} release."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhao X, Weisleder N, Han X, Pan Z, Parness J, Brotto M, Ma J |title=Azumolene Inhibits a Component of Store-operated Calcium Entry Coupled to the Skeletal Muscle Ryanodine Receptor |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=281 |issue=44 |pages=33477–86 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M602306200 |year=2006 | pmid=16945924}}</ref>

Azumolene has also been shown to be as effective as dantrolene at preventing and reversing contracture in in vitro experiments with human skeletal muscle.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sudo RT, Carmo, PL, Trachez MM, Pan Z, Zapata-Sudo G |title=Effects of Azumolene on Normal and Malignant Hyperthermia-Susceptible Skeletal Muscle |journal=Basic & Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=308–16 | doi=10.1111/j.1742-7843.2007.00156.x |year=2008 | pmid=18047479}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is poor if this condition is not aggressively treated.<ref name=Rosen2007/> In the 1970s, mortality was greater than 80%;  with the current management, however, mortality is now less than 5%.<ref name=Rosen2007/>

==Epidemiology==
The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is between 1:5,000 to 1:50,000–100,000 procedures involving general anaesthesia.<ref name=Rosen2007/> This disorder occurs worldwide and affects all racial groups. Most cases, however, occur in children and young adults, which might be related to the fact many older people will have already had surgeries and thus would know about and be able to avoid this condition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==In other animals==
Other animal including certain pig breeds, dogs, and horses are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia.<ref name=Rosen2007/> In dogs its inheritance is [[autosomal recessive]].<ref name=Rosen2007/>
