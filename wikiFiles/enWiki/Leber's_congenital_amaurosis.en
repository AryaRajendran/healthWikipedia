'''Leber's congenital amaurosis''' ('''LCA''') is a rare [[heredity|inherited]] [[List of eye diseases and disorders|eye disease]] that appears at [[congenital|birth]] or in the first few months of life, and affects around 1 in 80,000 of the population.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Stone EM | title= Leber congenital amaurosis — a model for efficient genetic testing of heterogeneous disorders: LXIV Edward Jackson Memorial Lecture | journal= Am J Ophthalmol | volume = 144 | issue = 6 | pages = 791–811 | year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17964524 |doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2007.08.022 |url=http://www.ajo.com/article/PIIS0002939407007672/}}</ref> One form of LCA became well known in the scientific community following its [[Adeno associated virus and gene therapy of the human retina|successful treatment]] with [[gene therapy]] in 2008.<ref name="Maguire, 2008">{{cite journal |author=Maguire AM, Simonelli F, Pierce EA, ''et al.'' |title=Safety and efficacy of gene transfer for Leber's congenital amaurosis |journal=N.

LCA was first described by [[Theodor Leber]] in the 19th century.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt |synd|1189|Leber's congenital amaurosis}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Leber T | title = Über Retinitis pigmentosa und angeborene Amaurose | journal = Archiv für Ophthalmologie | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages= 1–25 |year= 1869 |language= German |doi= 10.1007/BF02721213}}</ref>  It should not be confused with [[Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy]], which is a different disease also described by Theodor Leber.

==Presentation==
The term [[congenital]] refers to a condition present from birth (not acquired) and [[Amaurosis]] refers to a loss of vision ''not'' associated with a [[lesion]]. However, beyond these general descriptions, the presentation of LCA can vary, because it is associated with multiple genes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

LCA is typically characterized by [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} sluggish or no [[Pupillary reflex|pupillary responses]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and severe [[vision loss]] or [[blindness]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Genetics==
It is an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder thought to be caused by abnormal development of [[photoreceptor cell]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[OMIM]] currently recognizes 11 types of LCA:<ref>{{OMIM|204000| LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS, TYPE I; LCA1}}</ref>

==Treatment==

{{Main|Adeno associated virus and gene therapy of the human retina}}

One form of LCA, patients with LCA2 bearing a mutation in the [[RPE65]] gene, has been successfully treated by gene therapy in clinical trials.  The results of three early clinical trials were published in 2008 demonstrating the safety and efficacy of [[adeno-associated virus]] to restore vision in LCA patients. In all three clinical trials, patients recovered functional vision without apparent side-effects.<ref name="Maguire, 2008"/><ref  name="Simonelli, 2010"/><ref name="Cideciyan, 2009"/><ref name="Bainbridge, 2008"/> These studies, which used [[adeno-associated virus]], have spawned a number of new studies investigating gene therapy for human retinal disease.

The results of a phase 1 trial conducted, by the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in 2009, showed sustained improvement in 12 subjects (ages 8 to 44) with RPE65-associated LCA after treatment with AAV2-hRPE65v2, a gene replacement therapy.<ref name="Maguire, High, 2009">{{cite journal|last1=Maguire|first1=Albert M|last2=High|first2=Katherine A|last3=Auricchio|first3=Alberto|last4=Wright|first4=J Fraser|last5=Pierce|first5=Eric A|last6=Testa|first6=Francesco|last7=Mingozzi|first7=Federico|last8=Stone|first8=Edwin |author9=''et al'' |title=Age-dependent effects of RPE65 gene therapy for Leber's congenital amaurosis: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial|journal=Lancet|volume=374|issue=9701|year=2009|pages=1597–1605 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61836-5 |pmid=19854499}}</ref> Early intervention was associated with better results. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}  In that study patients were excluded based on the presence of particular antibodies to the vector AAV2 and treatment was only administered to one eye as a precaution. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A 2010 study testing the effect of administration of AAV2-hRPE65v2 in both eyes in animals with antibodies present suggested that immune responses may not complicate use of the treatment in both eyes.<ref name="Amado, 2010">{{cite journal|last1=Amado|first1=D.|last2=Mingozzi|first2=F. |last3=Bennicelli|first3=J.

==In Popular Culture==
*In the episode ''The Blackout in the Blizzard'' (season 6, episode 16) of the television drama ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', Dr. [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Jack Hodgins]] and his pregnant wife [[Angela Montenegro]], who is an LCA carrier, have to wait during a citywide blackout for Hodgins's genetic test results, to see if he is also an LCA carrier. He does indeed turn out to be a carrier, giving their unborn child a 25% chance of having LCA.
*In the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' (season 14, episode 12 named "Believe the Unseen") Dr. [[Abby Lockhart]] diagnoses a young foster girl with Leber's congenital amaurosis. The girl to this point hid her condition from her foster families. The episode contains some information about symptoms, clinical diagnosis and mentions gene replacement therapy and clinical trials as hope for help in managing the condition.
*In the [[Korean drama]] ''[[The King of Dramas]]'' (episode 16, "In Search Of Lost Time") Anthony Kim, played by [[Kim Myung-min]], is diagnosed with Leber's congenital amaurosis, the same disease that made his mother blind.
