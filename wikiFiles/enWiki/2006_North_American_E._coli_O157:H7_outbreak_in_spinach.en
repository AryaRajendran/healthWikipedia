== History ==
In September 2006, there was an outbreak of [[food-borne illness]] caused by ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') bacteria found in uncooked [[spinach]]<ref name="fda14">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108731.htm|title=FDA Warning on Serious Foodborne E.coli O157:H7 Outbreak|date=September 14, 2006|accessdate=November 23, 2009|work=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]]|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5v6kxay5k |archivedate = December 19, 2010}}</ref> in 26 U.S. states.<ref name="cdc" />

By October 6, 2006 199 people had been infected, including three people who died and 31 who suffered a type of kidney failure called [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]]<ref name="cdc" />
after eating spinach contaminated with the [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]], a potentially deadly bacterium that causes bloody [[diarrhea]] and dehydration.<ref name="reuters">{{cite news|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2006-09-17T022232Z_01_N14336072_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-ECOLI-DC.XML&pageNumber=1&imageid=∩=&sz=13&WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage1|title=U.S. expands warning to cover all fresh spinach|date=September 17, 2006|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> This strain is more potent than in any other food poisoning scares.

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) called for bagged fresh spinach to be removed from shelves and warned people not to eat any kind of fresh spinach or fresh spinach-containing products.<ref name="reuters"/><ref name="fda17"/> The FDA has also speculated that washing the spinach is insufficient to sanitize it because the bacteria is systemic, meaning that it is not just on the outside of the spinach, but that it has been absorbed through the [[root]]s and is now inside the spinach.  This hypothesis has since been deemed only hypothetical as there is no evidence that this can happen in spinach. The FDA has since reduced its warning to certain brands with specific dates.

The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] has advised consumers not to eat fresh spinach from the U.S., including bagged, loose in bulk or in salad blends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/recarapp/2006/20060918e.shtml|title=Expanded health hazad alert.

<!-- 6/5/2011 - replaced copyrighted image with PD image from USGOV-USDA -->

The outbreak was traced to organic [[Plastic shopping bag|bagged]] fresh [[spinach]]—sold as conventional produce—grown on a {{convert|50|acre|m2|sing=on}} farm in San Benito County, California. Investigators with the [[Centers for Disease Control]] initially speculated that the dangerous strain of bacteria, [[E. coli O157:H7]], originated from irrigation water contaminated with cattle feces or from grazing [[deer]].<ref>

The report found 26 samples of ''E. coli'' “indistinguishable from the outbreak strain” in water and cattle manure on the San Benito County ranch, some within a mile from the tainted spinach fields.

Paicines Ranch is not under investigation for its alleged role in the outbreak.

Soon after the reports were released, California's farm industry announced that it will adopt a set of "good agricultural practices" to reduce the risk of ''E. coli'' contamination for leafy green vegetables.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/March/24/local/stories/13local.htm|title=Tainted spinach linked to Paicines Ranch: Officials say San Juan Bautista plant though failed to follow its own safety procedures|date=March 24, 2007|publisher=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930201158/http%3A//www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/March/24/local/stories/13local.htm |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Those participating in the voluntary program will be eligible for product seal of approval.

=== Economic impact ===
In California, where three-quarters of all domestically grown spinach is harvested, farmers could face up to $74 million in losses due to the ''E. coli'' outbreak. In 2005, the spinach crop in California was valued at $258.3 million, and each acre lost amounts to a roughly $3,500 loss for the farmer.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15095551/ October 2, 2006 and in October 4, 2006 AP story reported on MSNBC.com] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5v6niujXD|date =December 19, 2010| accessdate= 20 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

The [[Pulsenet|PulseNet system]], part of the Association of Public Health Laboratories and coordinated by CDC, detected clusters of infection in two states, Oregon and Wisconsin, which initiated investigations in each state. The first cluster was detected on Friday September 8 in one state, and the second cluster emerged in the second state on Wednesday September 13, by which time PulseNet had also identified potential associated cases in other states.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2006/september/response/091606.htm CDC | E. coli Outbreak From Spinach | What CDC and Other Agencies Are Doing – Sep. 16, 2006] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5v6njHImh|date =December 19, 2010| accessdate= 20 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

The OutbreakNet, a group of state public health officers who investigate foodborne infection outbreaks, shared information with CDC that indicated that Oregon and Wisconsin were considering the same hypothesis: fresh spinach was the possible vehicle of infection. The group tracked and updated the increasing case count and exposure information. During a multistate call on Thursday, September 14, the group noted that the data strongly suggested that fresh spinach was a likely source. Within 24 hours of the outbreak, the data indicated that the outbreak was probably ongoing.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

CDC made communication to the public a priority by developing press releases, coordinating with FDA on press documents, conducting interviews with major media, and sending out notices on Thursday September 14 to the public health community via the Health Alert Network (HAN) and the Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X). By the next morning, the news media warned the U.S. population not to eat bagged spinach, with remarkable coverage.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

== Timeline ==

On September 14, 2006, the FDA warned consumers about an ''E. coli'' outbreak that was tied to bags of fresh spinach. The FDA reported that they received complaints from 19 states in the United States.<ref name="fda14"/><ref name="linked"/> The FDA advised "that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach."<ref name="fda14"/> Three days later, their updated warning said not to eat "fresh spinach or fresh spinach-containing products."<ref name="fda17"/>

On October 9, 2006, a popular brand of lettuce grown in California's Salinas Valley, the region at the center of the nationwide spinach scare has been recalled over concerns about ''E. coli'' contamination.

On October 26, 2006, some of the largest grocery chains, including [[Vons]], [[New Albertsons Inc.|Albertsons]], [[Ralphs]] and others, sent a letter to the farmer's associations, giving them 6 weeks to come up with a plan to prevent problems like the E. coli breakout from happening again.

==== Overall toll ====
The overall toll of the spinach incident was 199 people in 28 states being infected, resulting in 141 hospitalizations, 31 people having kidney failure, and three deaths.<ref>Surak, John G. "A Recipe for Safe Food: ISO 22000 and HACCP". ''Quality Progress''. October 2007. p. 21.</ref>
