==Technique==
Transnasal esophagoscopy is an office based procedure in which the patient is anesthetized locally in the nose and sometimes the oropharynx. The scope is advanced into the ipsilateral pyriform sinus and through the esophageal inlet to the [[stomach]], where the [[esophagus]] can be examined, with special attention paid to the gastroesophageal (GE) junction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Amin MR, Postma GN, Setzen M, Koufman JA|title=Transnasal esophagoscopy: A position statement from the American Broncho-Esophagological Association|journal=Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery|volume=138 |issue=1 |pages=411–414 |year=2008 |url=http://transnasalesophagoscopy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/TNE-White-paper-20081.pdf}}</ref>  An advantage of TNE over other more invasive cancer screening methods that require conscious sedation is that it can be performed using topical anesthesia alone with the patient sitting upright in an exam chair unencumbered by cardiac monitoring equipment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Belafsky PC, Postma GN, Daniel E, Koufman JA|title=Transnasal esophagoscopy|journal=Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery|volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=588–589 |year=2001 |url=http://transnasalesophagoscopy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/TNE-Paper-20011.pdf}}</ref>
