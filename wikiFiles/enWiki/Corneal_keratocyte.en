'''Corneal keratocytes''' ('''corneal fibroblasts''') are specialized [[fibroblast]]s residing in the [[corneal stroma|stroma]]. This [[cornea]]l layer, representing about 85-90% of corneal thickness, is built up from highly regular collagenous lamellae and extracellular matrix components. Keratocytes play the major role in keeping it transparent, healing its wounds, and synthesizing its components. In the unperturbed cornea keratocytes stay dormant, coming into action after any kind of injury or inflammation. Some keratocytes underlying the site of injury, even a light one, undergo apoptosis immediately after the injury.<!--

--> Any glitch in the precisely orchestrated process of healing may cloud the cornea, while excessive keratocyte apoptosis may be a part of the pathological process in the degenerative corneal disorders such as [[keratoconus]], and these considerations prompt the ongoing research into the function of these cells.

==Origin and functions==
Keratocytes are developmentally derived from the cranial population of [[neural crest]] cells, from whence they migrate to settle in the [[mesenchyme]]. In some species the migration from neural crest comes in two waves, with the first giving birth to the [[corneal epithelium]] and the second invading the epithelium-secreted stromal anlage devoid of cells; in other species both populations come from a single wave of migration. Once settled in the stroma, keratocytes start synthesizing collagen molecules of different types (I, V, VI) and [[keratan sulfate]]. By the moment of eye opening after birth the proliferation of keratocytes is all but finished and most of them are in the quiescent state.<!--

According to one study, average keratocyte density in the human stroma is about 20500 cells per mm<sup>3</sup>, or 9600 in a column of 1&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> in section. The highest density is observed in the upper 10% of the stroma. The number of keratocytes declines with age, at a rate approximately 0.45% per year.<!--

After an injury to the cornea, some keratocytes undergo apoptosis, prompted by the signaling molecules secreted by the upper layers, such as [[IL1A|IL1 alpha]] and [[TNF-alpha]]. Other neighbouring keratocytes, when acted upon by the same molecules, become active, proliferate and start synthesizing [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s that cause tissue remodeling. These activated cells are designated in different sources either as "active keratocytes" or "fibroblasts" or are said to assume a "repair phenotype". After heavier injuries or at the advanced stages of healing process a number of keratocytes transforms into [[myofibroblast]]s actively secreting [[extracellular matrix|ECM]] components; this transformation is thought to be caused by [[TGF-beta]]. As soon as the [[basement membrane]] of [[corneal epithelium]] is restored, [[TGF beta]] inflow into the stroma drastically decreases and myofibroblasts disappear, after which the remaining activated keratocytes continue for some time to reshape the extracellular matrix, secreting [[IL1A|IL1-alpha]] in order to maintain their "repair phenotype".<!--

[[Apoptosis]] of keratocytes, either in quiescent or active state, is a process that attracts special attention. In a healthy [[cornea]] the programmed [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[death]] is a rare occasion, but immediately after an [[injury]] to the uppermost layer keratocytes directly under the injury site commit apoptosis.<!--

Keratocytes may play a role in different corneal disorders. According to comparative research, their functions drastically diverge from the norm in [[keratoconus]], the most frequent form of [[corneal dystrophy]]. In keratoconic corneas they have been shown to commit apoptosis far away from any epithelial injury; a hypothesis exists that presents excessive keratocyte apoptosis as a major pathological event in keratoconus.<!--
