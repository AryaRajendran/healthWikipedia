'''Retroperitoneal fibrosis''' or '''Ormond's disease''' is a disease featuring the proliferation of fibrous tissue in the [[retroperitoneum]], the compartment of the body containing the [[kidney]]s, [[aorta]], [[renal tract]], and various other structures. It may present with [[lower back pain]], [[renal failure]], [[hypertension]], [[deep vein thrombosis]], and other obstructive symptoms. It is named after [[John Kelso Ormond]], who rediscovered the condition in 1948.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1712|Albarran-Ormond syndrome}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ormond JK |title=Bilateral ureteral obstruction due to envelopment and compression by an inflammatory retroperitoneal process |journal=J Urol. |volume=59 |issue= 6|pages=1072–9 |year=1948 |month= |pmid=18858051 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ormond JK |title=Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis: a discussion of the etiology |journal=J Urol. |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=385–90 |year=1965 |month=October |pmid=5839568 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Causes==
Its association with various immune-related conditions and response to [[immunosuppression]] have led to speculation regarding an [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune]] etiology of idiopathic RPF.<ref name="pmid16427494">{{cite journal |author=Vaglio A, Salvarani C, Buzio C |title=Retroperitoneal fibrosis |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9506 |pages=241–51 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16427494 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68035-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)68035-5}}</ref> One-third of the cases are secondary to [[malignancy]], medication ([[methysergide]], [[hydralazine]], [[beta blocker]]s), [[aortic aneurysm]], or certain infections.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis cannot be made on the basis of results of laboratory studies. CT is the best diagnostic modality: a confluent mass surrounding the aorta can be seen on a CT scan. Although biopsy is not usually recommended, it is appropriate when malignancy or infection is suspected. Biopsy should also be done if the location of fibrosis is atypical or if there is an inadequate response to initial treatment.<ref name="pmid16427494"/>

==Treatment==
In the absence of severe urinary tract obstruction (which generally requires [[surgery]] with omental wrapping), treatment is generally with [[glucocorticoid]]s initially, followed by [[DMARD]]s either as steroid-sparing agents or if refractory on steroids.<ref name="pmid12365466">{{cite journal |author=van Bommel EF |title=Retroperitoneal fibrosis |journal=Neth J Med |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=231–42 |year=2002 |month=July |pmid=12365466 |doi= |url=http://www.zuidencomm.nl/njm/getarticle.php?v=60&i=6&p=231}}</ref> The SERM [[tamoxifen]] has shown to improve the condition in various small trials, although the exact mechanism of its action remains unclear.

*[[Riedel's thyroiditis]]
*previous [[radiotherapy]]
*[[sarcoidosis]]
*inflammatory [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]
*drugs
