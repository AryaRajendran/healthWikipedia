'''Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC)''' is a biological treatment option which repairs [[articular cartilage damage]]. It combines [[microfracture surgery]] with the application of a bi-layer collagen I/III membrane.
AMIC achieves pain relief and restores functionality in the joint with the goal to regain full mobility, allowing going back to previous lifestyle and activity level. It slows down [[cartilage]] degeneration with the intent to avoid or delay partial or total [[joint replacement]] (e.g. [[knee replacement]]) surgery.

== Background ==
The AMIC procedure was first proposed by Behrens in 2003.<ref name="Behrens">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00142-005-0316-0|last=Behrens P.|year=2005|title= Matrixgekoppelte Mikrofrakturierung|journal= Arthroskopie|volume=18|issue=3|pages=193–197|first1=P.}}</ref> It aims to extend the use of microfracture surgery to larger cartilage lesions > 2.5&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>. 

AMIC is based on microfracturing which relies on the body’s own healing potential. [[Blood]] and [[bone marrow]] which are released through tiny holes in the subchondral bone plate, fill the damaged cartilage area with a so-called super-clot. This [[blood clot]] contains all the elements (e.g. [[progenitor cell]]s, [[mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)]], [[cytokine]]s and [[growth factor]]s) necessary to form new cartilage repair tissue as response to the encountered injury.
  
Adding a collagen membrane to the forming super clot secures it and improves overall clot stability. It also enhances the primary defect fill which is an important parameter for good outcome. Furthermore the application of a collagen membrane provides an environment where cells can adhere, proliferate and produce repair tissue in a protected setting. The originally proposed collagen membrane for AMIC (Chondro-Gide, Geistlich Pharma AG, Switzerland) consists of two sides, two layers (bi-layer design), one dense, compact side and a loose side.

Its clinical efficiency in [[autologous chondrocyte implantation|autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI)]], another cartilage repair technique for larger cartilage lesions, has been studied extensively.<ref name="pmid19841142">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0363546509348477|author= Gomoll AH, Probst C, Farr J, Cole BJ, Minas T|title= Use of a type I/III bilayer collagen membrane decreases reoperation rates for symptomatic hypertrophy after autologous chondrocyte implantation|journal=Am J Sports Med |volume= 37 Suppl 1|pages=20S–23S |year=2009|month=November|issn=0363-5465|pmid=19841142}}</ref><ref name="pmid17418330">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.arthro.2006.12.003|author= Steinwachs M, Kreuz PC |title= Autologous chondrocyte implantation in chondral defects of the knee with a type I/III collagen membrane: A prospective study with a 3-year follow-up |journal= Arthroscopy |volume= 23|issue=4|pages=381–387|year=2007|month=April |issn=1526-3231|pmid=17418330}}</ref><ref name="pmid16644224">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.knee.2006.02.011|author= Gooding CR, Bartlett W, Bentley G, Skinner JA, Carrington R, Flanagan A |title= A prospective, randomised study comparing two techniques of autologous chondrocyte implantation for osteochondral defects in the knee: Periosteum covered versus type I/III collagen covered |journal= Knee |volume= 13|issue=3|pages= 203–10 |year=2006|month=Jun |issn= 0968-0160|pmid=16644224}}</ref>

AMIC surgery is currently performed to treat cartilage damage in the [[knee]] and in the ankle ([[talus bone|talus]]).

== Procedure ==
{{see also|Knee cartilage replacement therapy}}

Autologous Matrix Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC) surgery is a single step procedure. After [[Arthroscopy|arthroscopic evaluation]] of the cartilage damage and decision for an AMIC procedure a mini [[arthrotomy]] is performed. An all-arthroscopic AMIC procedure for repair of cartilage defects of the knee is also possible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Piontek|first=Tomasz|coauthors=Ciemniewska-Gorzela Kinga, Szulc Andrzej, Naczk Jakub, Słomczykowski Michał|title=All-arthroscopic AMIC procedure for repair of cartilage defects of the knee|journal=Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy|date=30|year=2011|month=08|pages=1–4|doi=10.1007/s00167-011-1657-z|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-011-1657-z|issn=0942-2056}}</ref>

First the cartilage defect is exposed and cleaned whereby all unstable degenerated cartilage, including the calcified cartilage layer, are carefully removed. An imprint of the defect is then taken using a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] moldable material (e.g. [[aluminium foil]]) and transferred to the collagen membrane which is cut to shape. The surgeon then creates tiny holes/fractures in the [[subchondral bone]] plate ([[microfracture surgery|microfracturing]]) with a special [[wikt:awl|awl]]. [[Blood]] and [[bone marrow]] (containing [[stem cell]]s) are released forming a [[thrombus|blood clot]] which contains cartilage forming elements. The correctly sized collagen membrane is added to the microfractured area either by [[fibrin glue]] ([[autologous]] or commercially available) or [[suturing]]. Through flexion of the joint, the stable positioning of the membrane is verified and the wound is closed.

A critical phase and actually essential requirement for satisfying outcome of the AMIC surgery is the compliance to a strict [[physical therapy]] program. Guidelines and recommendations exist, though they have to be adapted to the individual patients needs.

== Clinical Results ==
In general various factors have been identified known to influence the clinical result after cartilage repair regardless of the technique used. Amongst them are the species and age of the individual, the size and localization of the articular cartilage defect, the surgical technique, and the postoperative rehabilitation protocol.<ref name="pmid15716263">{{cite journal|author= Alford JW, Cole BJ |title= Cartilage restoration, part 2: techniques, outcomes, and future directions |journal= Am J Sports Med |volume= 33|issue=3|pages= 443–460 |year=2005|month=Mar |issn= 0363-5465 |pmid=15716263|doi= 10.1177/0363546505274578}}</ref><ref name="pmid18313469">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.injury.2008.01.042|author= Steinwachs MR, Guggi T, Kreuz PC |title= Marrow stimulation techniques |journal=Injury |volume=39 Suppl 1|pages= S26–31 |year=2008|month=Apr |issn=0020-1383 |pmid=18313469}}</ref> The latter has been found especially important for microfracture surgery and therefore for AMIC.<ref name="pmid20226318">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.csm.2009.12.009|author= Hurst JM, Steadman JR, O'Brien L, Rodkey WG, Briggs KK |title=Rehabilitation following microfracture for chondral injury in the knee |journal= Clin Sports Med |volume= 29 |issue= 2 |pages= 257–65, viii |year=2010|month=Apr |issn=1556-228X|pmid=20226318}}</ref>

Microfracture surgery was developed by Dr. Steadman in the late 80’s and early 90’s. It is a well documented cartilage repair technique and first line treatment option for small cartilage lesions.<ref name="Steadman1997">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/S1048-6666(97)80033-X|author= Steadman JR, Rodkey WG, Singleton SB, Briggs KK |title= Microfracture technique for full-thickness chondral defects: Technique and clinical results |journal= Oper Tech Orthop |volume= 7 |issue= 4 |pages=300–304 |year=1997|month=October}}</ref><ref name="pmid11603719">{{cite journal|author= Steadman JR, Rodkey WG, Rodrigo JJ |title= Microfracture: surgical technique and rehabilitation to treat chondral defects |journal= Clin Orthop Relat Res | issue= 391 Suppl |pages= S362–9 |year=2001|month=Oct |issn= 0009-921X |pmid=11603719}}</ref><ref name="pmid12724676">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1053/jars.2003.50112|author= Steadman JR, Briggs KK, Rodrigo JJ, Kocher MS, Gill TJ, Rodkey WG |title= Outcomes of microfracture for traumatic chondral defects of the knee: average 11-year follow-up |journal=Arthroscopy |volume= 19 |issue= 5 |pages= 477–84 |year=2003|month= May-Jun |issn= 1526-3231 |pmid=12724676}}</ref> AMIC evolved with the aim to improve some of the shortfalls of microfracture surgery as for instance variable repair cartilage volume and functional deterioration over time.<ref name="pmid19251676 ">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1177/0363546508328414|author= Mithoefer K, McAdams T, Williams RJ, Kreuz PC, Mandelbaum BR |title= Clinical efficacy of the microfracture technique for articular cartilage repair in the knee: an evidence-based systematic analysis |journal= Am J Sports Med |volume= 37 |issue= 10 |pages=2053–63 |year=2009|month=Oct |issn=1552-3365 |pmid=19251676 }}</ref> Additionally it was intended to provide a simple technique for securely retaining the fragile blood clot in larger defects and to possibly enhance the chondrogenesis of MSCs.

The first ''in-vitro'' work demonstrating that a collagen membrane can retain cartilage building cells (e.g. [[mesenchymal stem cell|MSCs]]) from bone marrow was published in 2006 by Kramer ''et al.''. After perforation of the subchondral bone (microfracturing) the collagen membrane was added to the forming super-clot. Then MSCs were recovered from a tiny surplus of bone marrow soaked membrane. As a proof of their existence, MCSs were successfully [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] into the [[adipogenesis|adipogenic]], [[osteogenesis|osteogenic]] and most importantly [[chondrogenesis|chondrogenic]] lineage. Chondrification (also known as [[chondrogenesis]]) is the underlying process of cartilage formation from condensed [[mesenchyme]] tissue, which differentiates into chondrocytes and begins secreting the molecules that form the [[extracellular matrix]], the cartilage repair tissue.<ref name="pmid16482398">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00018-005-5527-z|author= Kramer J, Böhrnsen F, Lindner U, Behrens P, Schlenke P, Rohwedel J |title= In vivo matrix-guided human mesenchymal stem cells |journal=Cell Mol Life Sci |volume= 63 |issue= 5 |pages= 616–26 |year=2006|month=Mar |issn= 1420-682X|pmid=16482398}}</ref>

In another in-vitro study Dickhut ''et al.'' investigated whether a combination of a collagen membrane (Chondro-Gide) with fibrin glue supports ''in-vitro'' chondrogenesis of MSCs and allowed for local release of bioactive [[TGF beta 1|transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1)]]. They could show, that the combination provided high biofunctionality with improved chondrogenesis and long term local supply of TGF-β1. TGF-β1 is a secreted protein that performs many cellular functions, including the control of cell growth, [[cell proliferation]], [[cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]] and [[apoptosis]]. Additionally Dickhut ''et al.'' could demonstrate that the form stability of the forming repair tissue was enhanced when compared to collagen-membrane-free constructs.<ref name="pmid19705961">{{cite journal|doi=10.1089/ten.TEA.2009.0168|author= Dickhut A, Dexheimer V, Martin K, Lauinger R, Heisel C, Richter W |title= Chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells by local TGF-beta delivery in a biphasic resorbable carrier |journal= Tissue Eng Part A |volume= 16 |issue= 2 |pages=453–64 |year=2010|month=Feb |issn= 1937-335X |pmid=19705961}}</ref>

The addition of a collagen membrane to microfractured cartilage lesions has also been tested in a sheep study by Gille ''et al.''. It could be confirmed that the thickness of the repair tissue was greater when a scaffold, especially a collagen I/III membrane, was used as compared to microfracture alone. Hence the authors concluded that repair tissue formation was promoted.<ref name="gille2010cartilage">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1947603509358721|author= Gille J, Kunow J, Boisch L, Behrens P, Bos I, Hoffmann C, Köller W, Russlies M, Kurz B|title= Cell-Laden and Cell-Free Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis versus Microfracture for the Treatment of Articular Cartilage Defects: A Histological and Biomechanical Study in Sheep |journal= Cartilage|volume= 1 |issue= 1 |pages=29–42 |year=2010|month=Jan}}</ref>

The same author reported first clinical results with the AMIC technique in 2010. A total of 27 patients who underwent AMIC surgery between 2003 and 2005 were included in this prospective investigation. The follow-up period was between 24 and 62 months with a mean of 37 months. The mean age of the patients was 39 years (range 16 – 50 years). The mean defect size was 4.2&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> (range 1.3 - 8.8&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>). Three patients had to be excluded from the study. 20 of the 23 patients questioned answered that they were highly satisfied with the results after surgery and stated overall improvement of knee function. The outcome scores applied (Lysholm, ICRS, Meyer, Tegner, Cincinnati) showed significant increase up to 24 months with a slight decrease from three years post surgery. Patients with lesions larger 8&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> had greatly reduced scores. Gille ''et al.'' concluded that treatment of chondral knee lesions with the AMIC technique is effective and safe in appropriately selected cases.<ref name="pmid20127072">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1007/s00167-010-1042-3|author= Gille J, Schuseil E, Wimmer J, Gellissen J, Schulz AP, Behrens P |title= Mid-term results of Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis for treatment of focal cartilage defects in the knee |journal=Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc|volume= 18 |issue= 11 |pages=1456–64 |year=2010|month=Nov |issn=1433-7347|pmid=20127072}}</ref>
