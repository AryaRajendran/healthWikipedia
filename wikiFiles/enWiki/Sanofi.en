==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}

===Sanofi-Synthélabo===

Sanofi-Synthélabo was formed in 1999 when Sanofi (former subsidiary of [[Total S.A.|Total]]) merged with [[Synthélabo]] (former subsidiary of [[L'Oréal]]). The merged company was based in Paris, France.

===Aventis===
[[File:Aventis logo.png|left]]

Aventis was formed in 1999 when French company [[Rhône-Poulenc]] S.A. merged with the German corporation [[Hoechst Marion Roussel]], which itself was formed from the 1995 merger of [[Hoechst AG]] with [[Roussel Uclaf]] and [[Marion Merrell Dow]]. The merged company was based in [[Schiltigheim]], near [[Strasbourg]], France.

===Merger and beyond===
Sanofi-Aventis was formed in 2004 when Sanofi-Synthélabo acquired Aventis. In early 2004, Sanofi-Synthélabo made a [[Takeover|hostile takeover]] bid worth €47.8 billion for Aventis. Initially, Aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the company's share value. The three-month takeover battle concluded when Sanofi-Synthélabo launched a friendly bid of €54.5 billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid. French government intervention also played an active role. The [[France|French]] government, desiring what they called a "local solution", put heavy pressure on Sanofi-Synthélabo to raise its bid for Aventis after it became known that [[Novartis]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] pharmaceutical company, was in the running.

October 2010: Sanofi-Aventis SA laid off 1,700 US employees due to restructuring triggered by growing generic competition and other factors. The cuts were completed throughout 2011 according to transition needs. The layoffs amount to about 25 percent of the company's US pharmaceutical operation. The company denies the action was related with acquisition plan of buying US biotech firm [[Genzyme]] Corp.<ref>Sanofi-Aventis To Lay Off 1,700 US Employees http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/10/08/ap/health/main6939445.shtml</ref>

The company dropped the -Aventis suffix of its name on 6 May 2011 after receiving approval at its [[Annual general meeting|AGM]]. The reason given by the company for the change was to make its name easier to pronounce in countries such as China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mennella|first=Noelle|title=Sanofi changes name, pace of acquisitions to slow|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/sanofi-idUSLDE74521Z20110506|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=6 May 2011|agency=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

==Head office==
[[File:Sanofi HQ.jpg|thumb|Previous head office in Paris]]
In January 2012, Sanofi moved its head office location to 54, rue La Boétie in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. This former mansion designed by architect René-Patouillard had previously been the head office of Alcatel-Lucent.  

Sanofi's previous head office was located in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]], 174 Avenue de France. The architecture of the head office is of the predominate style of the area surrounding the [[François Mitterrand Library]]. After Sanofi and Aventis merged, the employees at the former Aventis head office in [[Schiltigheim]], [[Alsace]] moved to Paris.<ref>"[http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/reportage/les-sieges-sociaux-des-entreprises-du-cac-40/sanofi-aventis-regroupement-a-paris.shtml Sanofi-Aventis : regroupement à Paris]." ''[[Le Journal du Net]]''. Retrieved on 28 September 2010.</ref>

==Collaborative research==
In addition to internal research and development activities Sanofi is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of [[Pre-clinical development|non-clinical]] safety assessment is the [[InnoMed PredTox]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/978-1-60327-048-9_11}}</ref><ref name="InnoMed PredTox official project website">{{cite web|url=http://www.innomed-predtox.com/consortium/members/|title=InnoMed PredTox Member Organizations|accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref> The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]] of [[EFPIA]] and the [[European Commission]].<ref name="IMI Call Topics 2008">{{cite web|url=http://imi.europa.eu/docs/calls01_en.zip|title=IMI Call Topics 2008|last=Innovative Medicines Initiative|work=IMI-GB-018v2-24042008-CallTopics.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2008-08-25}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On October 25, Sanofi said its earnings for the third quarter slumped as generic competitors ate into profits of its [[Eloxatin]] [[cancer]] treatment. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2012/10/25/world/europe/ap-eu-france-earns-sanofi.html?ref=news&_r=0.html|title=Sanofi Earns Slump in Q3 as Competition Heats Up|date=October 25, 2012|work= The New York Times }}</ref>
