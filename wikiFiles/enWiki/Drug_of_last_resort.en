A '''drug of last resort''' is a generalized descriptor of a pharmaceutical agent or other compound exhibiting clinically significant pharmacological activity which is considered to be restricted for use, whether by regulatory requirement or commonly accepted medical best practice, only after all (or nearly so) other treatment options have failed to produce adequate response. After extreme scrutiny and diligent selectivity and often after agreement between multiple healthcare professionals (physicians, advanced practice nurses, pharmacists, pharmacologists, etc.), in certain situations (for example, in severe bacterial related [[sepsis]] / [[septic shock]], certain antibiotics such as [[vancomycin]]), therapies often considered to be drugs of last resort may sometimes be considered earlier due to severity of presentation and/or indication for use of an agent likely to show the most immediate [[dose-response_relationship|dose-response]] related efficacy in time critical situations (high mortality circumstances). Many of the drugs considered to be of last resort fall into one or more of the categories including [[antibiotic]]s, [[antiviral drug|antiviral]]s, or [[chemotherapy]] agents. These agents often (but not exclusively) exhibit what are considered to be among the most efficient dose-response related [[antibiotic]], [[antiviral drug|antiviral]], or [[chemotherapy|anticancer]] effects, and/or are drugs for which no (or very few) resistant strains (in the case of infectious pathology) are known.

With consideration to antibiotics, antivirals, and other agents indicated for treatment of infectious pathological disease, drugs of last resort are commonly withheld from administration until after the trial and failure of more commonly used treatment options with specific regard to prevent the development of [[drug resistance|resistance]]. One of the most commonly known examples of both antimicrobial resistance and the relationship to the classification of a drug of last resort is the emergence of [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA, sometimes also referred to as multiple-drug resistant S. aureus due to resistance to non-penicillin antibiotics that some strains of S. aureus have shown to exhibit). In cases presenting with suspected S. aureus, it is suggested by many public health institutions (including the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the United States) and an increasingly accepted practice to treat first with empirical therapies for S. aureus, with an emphasis on evaluating the response to initial treatment and laboratory diagnostic techniques to isolate cases of drug resistance. Due to the possibility of potential severe or fatal consequences of resistant strains, initial treatment often includes concomitant administration of multiple antimicrobial agents that are not known to show cross-resistance to, in theory, reduce the possibility of a resistant strain remaining inadequately treated by a single agent during the evaluation of drug response. Once a specific resistance profile has been isolated via clinical laboratory findings, treatment is often modified as indicated. Traditionally, vancomycin has been one of the longest considered drugs of last resort, both due to efficacy in treating multiple drug-resistant infectious agents and the requirement for [[intravenous]] administration. Recently, resistance to even vancomycin has been shown in some strains of S. aureus (sometimes referred to as [[Vancomycin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus|vancomycin resistant S. aureus or vancomycin intermediate-resistance S. aureus (VRSA or VISA)]] often coinciding with but not exclusive to methicillin/penicillin resistance, prompting the inclusion of newer antibiotics (such as [[linezolid]]) that have shown efficacy in highly drug-resistant strains to be considered for restricted use as drugs of last resort.

Agents classified as fourth-line (or greater) treatments or atypical / investigational therapies could be considered by default to be drugs of last resort due to their low placement in the treatment hierarchy. Such placement may result due to a multitude of considerations including, but not limited to: greater efficacy of other agents, socioeconomic considerations, availability issues, unpleasant [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] or similar issues relating to patient tolerance. Some investigational / experimental therapies might also be colloquially fall into the broad categorization as a drug of last resort when administered following the failure of all known and currently accepted treatments.

Despite the fact that most of the notable drugs of last resort are antibiotics or antivirals, other drugs are sometimes considered drugs of last resort, such as [[cisapride]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=FDA tells doctors to use heartburn drug as last resort |journal=BMJ |volume=320 |issue=7231 |pages=336 |date=5 February 2000|pmc=1173548}}</ref>
