Human '''body shape''' is a complex phenomenon with sophisticated detail and function. The general shape or figure of a person is defined mainly by the molding of skeletal structures, as well as the distribution of [[muscle]]s and fat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_548.asp  |title=Body shape is determined by the nature of body fat distribution|accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> Skeletal structure grows and changes only up to the point at which a human [[Growth hormone|reaches adulthood]] and remains essentially the same for the rest of his or her life.<ref group=notes>Growth is usually completed between the ages of 13 and 18, at which time the epiphyseal plates of long bones close, allowing no further growth (see [[Human skeleton]]).</ref>

==Changes during puberty==
During [[puberty]], [[Virilization|differentiation]] of the male and female body occurs for the purposes of [[reproduction]]. In adult humans, [[muscle]] mass may change due to exercise, and fat distribution may change due to [[Sex hormones|hormone]] fluctuations. Inherited genes play a large part in the development of body shape.

=== Facial features ===

<!-- image required, male face -->
Due to the action of testosterone, males develop these [[face|facial]]-bone features during puberty:
* A more prominent brow bone.<ref group=notes>Bone across the centre of the forehead from around the middle of eyebrow across to the middle of the other</ref>
* A heavier [[jaw]].
* More prominent [[chin]].
* Larger nose bone.<ref group=notes>[[Testosterone]] thickens the brow and "upper bridge of the nose" [http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/male_facial_beauty.htm]</ref>

Because females have around 1/10 the amount of testosterone of a male, these features do not develop to the same extent. Hence female faces are generally more similar to those of [[puberty|pre-pubertal]] children.

=== Skeletal structure ===
[[Human skeleton|Skeletal structure]] frames the overall shape of the body and does not alter much over a lifetime. Males are, on average, taller, but body shape may be analyzed after normalizing with respect to height.<ref  group=notes>Males are [[Sex differences#Physical differences|taller]]</ref>

====Broad shoulders and expanded chest (in males)====
Widening of the [[shoulder]]s occurs as part of the male pubertal process.<ref name="columbia">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/modules/reproductiveHealth/anatomy.html |title=Secondary sexual characteristics occur as part of the pubertal process|accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> Expansion of the [[ribcage]] is caused by the effects of [[testosterone]] during [[puberty]].<ref group=notes>Testosterone causes expansion of rib cage during puberty as one of secondary sex characteristics.[http://www.humanhormones.com/category/steroids/androgens/]</ref> Hence males generally have broad shoulders and expanded chests, allowing them to inhale more air to supply their muscles with oxygen{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

====Wide hips (in females)====
Widening of the [[Hip (anatomy)|hip bones]] occurs as part of the female pubertal process,<ref name="columbia"/> and [[estrogens]] (the predominant [[sex hormones]] in females) causes a widening of the pelvis as a part of [[sexual differentiation]]. Hence females generally have wider hips, permitting [[childbirth]]. Because the female [[human pelvis|pelvis]] is flatter, more rounded and proportionally larger, the head of the [[fetus]] may pass during childbirth.<ref>See [[Human skeleton#Gender differences|Gender differences in Human skeleton]] and [[Hip (anatomy)#Sexual dimorphism in humans|Sexual dimorphism in Hips]]</ref> The [[Sacrum#Sexual_dimorphism|sacrum]] in females is shorter and wider, and also directed more toward the rear (see image).<ref>Saukko P, Knight B.

After puberty, female hips are generally wider than female shoulders; males exhibit the opposite configuration. But not everyone follows this stereotypical pattern of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html  |title=Hips grow wider than their shoulders|accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> Both male and female hormones are present in the human body, and though only one of them is predominant in an adult, the other hormone has effects on body's shape to some extent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinajuanfitness.info/articles/081505.htm  |title=Some women have more male sex hormones than the average woman|accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref>

=== Fat distribution, muscles and tissues ===
[[Image:Vintage photo nude woman 2.jpg|thumb|right|Females generally store fat in [[buttocks]], [[hip]]s and [[thigh]]s due to effect of [[estrogen]], while males store fat around the  [[abdomen|belly]] area.]]
Body shape is affected by body [[fat]] distribution, which is correlated to current levels of [[sex hormones]].<ref group=notes>"Body shape is determined by the nature of body fat distribution that, in turn, is significantly correlated with women's sex hormone profile" [http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_548.asp]</ref> Muscles and fat distribution may change from time to time, unlike [[Human skeleton|bone]] structure, depending on food habits, exercises and hormone levels.

==== Fat distribution ====
[[#Fat distribution|Fat distribution]] plays an important role in health, some studies suggest that fat in the thighs and hips may be beneficial to one's health.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/health-fitness/health/Big-bum-thunder-thighs-good-for-health/articleshow/5439897.cms |title=Big bum, thunder thighs good for health |quote=fat distribution is important to health | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

Estrogen causes fat to be stored in the [[buttocks]], [[thighs]], and  [[Hip (anatomy)|hips]] in women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annecollins.com/obesity/reduce-abdominal-fat.htm |title=Reducing Abdominal Fat}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.healthywomen.org/columns/drpeekescolumn/dbcolumn/waistlineworriesturningapplesbackintopears |title=Waistline Worries: Turning Apples Back Into Pears |accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> When women reach [[menopause]] and the estrogen produced by ovaries declines, fat migrates from their buttocks, hips and thighs to their waists;<ref group=notes>Researchers think that the lack of oestrogen at menopause play a role in driving our fat northward [http://health.yahoo.com/topic/nutrition/overview/article/womens-health/26287]</ref> later fat is stored in the [[abdomen|belly]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Abdominal-fat-and-what-to-do-about-it.htm  |title=Abdominal fat and what to do about it}}</ref> Thus females generally have relatively narrow [[waist]]s and large buttocks,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.buttsbymendieta.com/Cosmo_aug_2006.htm |title=Big Butts are Back |journal=Cosmopolitan |accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> and this along with [[#Skeletal structure|wide hips]] make for a wider hip section and a lower [[waist-hip ratio]] compared to men.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/Why-men-store-fat-in-bellies-women-on-hips/articleshow/5933643.cms |title=Why men store fat in bellies, women on hips|accessdate=10/9/2011 | work=The Times Of India |date=3 January 2011}}</ref> Hormonal and genetic factors may produce [[android fat distribution|male-like distribution of fat]] in women i.e. around the belly instead of buttocks and thighs.

Estrogen increases [[fat]] storage in the body,<ref  group=notes>Oestrogen women have activates fat storing enzymes and causes them to multiply [http://www.tanita.com/MessageForWomen.shtml]</ref> which results in more fat stored in the female body.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/4369598.cms |title=Sex hormone making women fat?  |accessdate=10/9/2011 | work=The Times Of India |date=7 April 2009}}</ref> Body fat percentage [[Body fat percentage#Recommendations|recommendations]] are higher for females, as this may serve as an energy reserve for [[pregnancy]]. Males have less [[subcutaneous fat]] in their faces due to the effects of testosterone;<ref>"Subcutaneous fat in face decreases" - [[Testosterone#Advanced postnatal effects|Advanced postnatal effects]]</ref> testosterone also reduces fat by aiding fast [[metabolism]]. Males generally deposit fat around [[waist]]s and [[abdomen]]s (producing an "apple shape") due to the lack of estrogen.

==== Muscles ====
{{See also|Body building}}
[[Testosterone]] helps build and maintain muscles through exercise.<ref group=notes>Maintaining sufficient levels of the hormone testosterone can "build muscle and decrease body fat" [http://www.vitamins-supplements.org/hormones/testosterone.php]</ref>
On average, males have around 10 times more testosterone than women. Prominent muscles of the body include the pectoral muscles, [[biceps]] and [[triceps]] in the arms and [[quadriceps]] in the thighs.

==== Breasts ====
Females have enlarged [[breast]]s due to functional [[mammary glands]], which develop from puberty onward due to the effects of [[estrogen]]. Mammary glands do not contain muscle tissue. The shape of female breasts is affected by age, genetic factors, and body weight.

== Overweight and underweight ==
Being [[overweight]] or [[underweight]] causes change in the human body's shape as well as [[Human position|posture]] and walking style. This is measured using [[Body mass index|BMI]] or waist circumference. Depending on the BMI, a body may be referred to as slim, overweight, or obese. New computer based measurement, such as the [[Body Volume Index|BVI]], specifically take body shape and where weight on the body is distributed as the basis in determining this.

[[Dieting]], in conjunction with [[exercise]], may by used to bring and keep the BMI within an acceptable range.

The [[fat]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s in [[food]] constitute the majority of energy used by the body. They are measured cumulatively in the USA and many other places in  [[calorie]]s and in [[kilojoule]]s in some other parts of the world.

==Effect on body posture and gait==
Body shape has effects on body [[Human positions|posture]] and [[Gait (human)|gait]], and has a major role in [[physical attraction]]. This is because a body's shape implies an individual's hormone levels during puberty, which implies fertility, and it also indicates current levels of [[sex hormones]].<ref  group=notes>"Body shape is determined by the nature of body fat distribution that, in turn, is significantly correlated with women's sex hormone profile, risk for disease, and reproductive capability" [http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_548.asp]</ref> A pleasing shape also implies good [[health]] and [[Physical fitness|fitness]] of the body.

== Terminologies ==
[[Image:Michelangelos David.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Michelangelo's David|David]]'' - V-shaped torso is considered [[Physical attraction|attractive]].]]

Classifications of female body sizes are mainly based on the circumference of the bust-waist-hip ([[BWH]]), as in 36-24-36 (inches) respectively. In this case, the waist-hip ratio is 24/36 = 0.67. Many terms or classifications are used to describe body shape types:

*V shape: Males tend to have proportionally smaller buttocks, bigger chests and wider [[shoulder]]s, which makes for a V-shape of the torso. V-shaped, or [[mesomorphic]], males are considered attractive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
*Hourglass shape: The female body is significantly narrower in the [[waist]] both in front view and profile view. The waist is narrower than the chest region due to the breasts, and narrower than the hip region due to the width of the buttocks, which results in an [[Female_body_shape#Female_shapes|hourglass]] shape.
*Apple: The stomach region is wider than the hip section, mainly in males. This is also referred to as [[endomorphic]].
*Pear or spoon or bell: The hip section is wider than the upper body, mainly in females.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1is2fat.com/Body-shape-calculator.htm  |title=Illustration of shape in body shape calculator|accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref>
*Rectangle or straight or banana: The hip, waist, and shoulder sections are relatively similar. This is also referred to as [[ectomorphic]].

== Impact on health ==
According to the [[Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada]], those people with a larger waist (apple shaped) have higher health risks than those who carry excess weight on the hips and thighs (pear shaped). People with apple shaped bodies who carry excess weight are at greater risk of high [[blood pressure]], Type 2 [[diabetes]] and high [[cholesterol]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484281/k.D785/Assess_your_weight.htm |title=Assess your weight |publisher=Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada|accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref>

== Fitness and exercises ==
Different forms of [[exercise]]s are practiced for the [[Physical fitness|fitness]] of the body and also for health. Different forms of exercises include [[walking]], [[jogging]], [[sports]], [[yoga]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, [[aerobics]], and [[weight training|weightlifting]]. It is a common belief that [[Spot reduction|targeted exercise]] reduces fat in specific parts of the body<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Myths.html |title=Fat Loss & Weight Training Myths|accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> —for example, that exercising muscles around the [[Abdomen|belly]] reduces fat in the belly. This, however, is now proven to be a misconception. Spot reduction exercises are not useful unless you plan proper exercise regime to lose overall calories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://loose-fat-thighs.com |title=Misconceptions about weight loss |accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> But exercising reduces fat throughout the body, and [[#Fat distribution|where fat is stored]] depends on hormones. [[Liposuction]] is surgery commonly used in [[developed country|developed societies]] to remove fat from the body.

== Clothing and accessories==
{{See also|Foundation garments|Dress size}}
[[Clothing]] changes the appearance of the body. [[Fashion]] may enhance the shape of the body, while [[Jeans|tight jeans]], [[bikini]]s, [[Brassiere|bra]]s, [[Belt (clothing)|belt]]s, [[corset]]s, and other garments may support or constrict areas of the body to achieve different proportions. High [[heel]]ed shoes, generally used by females, also alter body proportions.

Dress size depends on different dimensions. [[US standard clothing size|US]], [[EN 13402|European]] and [[International Clothing Sizes|international]] standards are common. Different terms used in fashion include [[petite sizes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=59213&dict=CALD |title=Cambridge Dictionaries Online - Cambridge University Press |accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> full-figured (FFW),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Full+Figured+Women |title=Full Figured Women - What does FFW stand for? |accessdate=10/9/2011}}</ref> [[size zero]], and [[vanity sizing]].

Standard retail clothing (i.e., not tailored) is proportionally scaled, however, the idea of differing body shapes alludes to commercially available garments as being designed without the body shape in mind. Companies like lankeeclothing.com<ref>www.lankeeclothing.com</ref> seek to address this and market to specific body types.
