Core documents outlining MSF's principles are the Charter<ref>MSF Article [http://www.msf.org.uk/about_charter.aspx MSF's Charter – ABOUT MSF  – MSF UK] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 31 May 2009.</ref> and the Chantilly Principles, along with the later La Mancha Agreement,<ref>MSF Article [http://www.msf.dk/OmMSF/Hvemervi/LaMancha-aftalen/ La Mancha Agreement] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 31 May 2009.</ref> which in Rules, Section 2 addresses governance. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the 5 operational centres ([[Amsterdam]], [[Barcelona]]-[[Athens]], [[Brussels]], [[Geneva]] and [[Paris]]). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 19 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

The organization actively provides health care and medical training to populations in about 70 countries, and frequently insists on political responsibility in conflict zones such as [[Chechnya]] and Kosovo. Only once in its history, during the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide in Rwanda]], has the organisation called for military intervention. In order to be able to speak and act freely, MSF remains independent of any political, religious or economic powers.

MSF received the 1999 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.<ref>[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2006/top10_2005.html MSF-USA: Special Report: The 10 Most Underreported Humanitarian Crises of 2005]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> Dr. [[James Orbinski]], who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF.

MSF should not be confused with [[Médecins du Monde]] (Doctors of the World, in English). The latter organization was formed in part by members of the former organization, but it is an entirely independent non-governmental organization with no links to MSF today.

==Creation==
===Biafra===
[[File:Starved girl.jpg|thumb|A child with [[kwashiorkor]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]].]]

During the [[Nigerian Civil War]] of 1967 to 1970, the Nigerian military formed a [[blockade]] around the nation's newly [[secession|independent]] south-eastern region, [[Biafra]]. At this time, France was the only major country supportive of the Biafrans (the United Kingdom, the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States sided with the Nigerian government), and the conditions within the blockade were unknown to the world. A number of French doctors volunteered with the French [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra. One of the co-founders of the organisation was [[Bernard Kouchner]] who later became a high-ranking French politician.

After entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the [[Nigerian Armed Forces|Nigerian army]], and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. The doctors publicly criticized the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. These doctors concluded that a new aid organization was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritize the welfare of victims.

===1971 establishment===
The ''Groupe d'Intervention Médicale et Chirurgicale en Urgence'' ("Emergency Medical and Surgical Intervention Group") was formed in 1970 by French doctors who had worked in Biafra, to provide aid and to emphasize the importance of victims' rights over neutrality. At the same time, [[Raymond Borel]], the editor of the French [[medical journal]] ''TONUS'', had started a group called ''Secours Médical Français'' ("French Medical Relief") in response to the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], which killed at least 625,000 in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh). Borel had intended to recruit doctors to provide aid to victims of natural disasters. On 20 December 1971, the two groups of colleagues merged to form ''Médecins Sans Frontières''.<ref name="hih"/>

MSF’s first mission was to the Nicaraguan capital, [[Managua]], where a [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake]] had destroyed most of the city and killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people.<ref>Bortolotti, above, puts the death toll at 10,000. An estimate of 15,000 to 30,000, warning of an inevitable dysentery epidemic, comes from: {{Cite journal | author=Camilo, V | year = 1974 | title = The Earthquake in Managua | url = | journal=The Lancet (Correspondence) | volume = 303 | issue = 7845| pages = 25–26 }}</ref> The organization, today known for its quick response in an emergency, arrived three days after the Red Cross had set up a relief mission. On 18 and 19 September 1974, [[Hurricane Fifi]] caused major flooding in Honduras and killed thousands of people (estimates vary), and MSF set up its first long-term medical relief mission.<ref>MSF Article [http://www.medecinssansfrontieres.com/site/site.nsf/pages/70 Chronologies: Années 70 (French)] '''MSF-France'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.</ref>

Between 1975 and 1979, after [[South Vietnam]] had fallen to [[North Vietnam]], millions of Cambodians emigrated to Thailand to avoid the [[Khmer Rouge]]. In response MSF set up its first [[refugee camp]] missions in Thailand.<ref name="hih"/> When Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989, MSF started long-term relief missions to help survivors of [[The Killing Fields|the mass killings]] and reconstruct the country’s health care system.<ref>MSF Article (1999) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=751B6EAC-B3D6-11D4-B1FA0060084A6370&method=full_html Cambodia's second chance] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.</ref> Although its missions to Thailand to help victims of war in Southeast Asia could arguably be seen as its first war-time mission, MSF saw its first mission to a true war zone, including exposure to hostile fire, in 1976. MSF spent nine years (1976–1984) assisting surgeries in the hospitals of various cities in Lebanon, during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], and established a reputation for its neutrality and willingness to work under fire. Throughout the war, MSF helped both [[Lebanese Civil War#Christian militias|Christian]] and [[Lebanese Civil War#Shi'a militias|Muslim soldiers]] alike, helping whichever group required the most medical aid at the time. In 1984, as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for aid groups was minimized, MSF withdrew its volunteers.

==New leadership==
[[Claude Malhuret]] was elected as the new president of MSF in 1977, and soon after debates began over the future of the organization. In particular, the concept of ''témoignage'' ("witnessing"), which refers to speaking out about the suffering that one sees as opposed to remaining silent,<ref>MSF Article (2005) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=F75AB4F5-E018-0C72-093A3A517D56EB33&component=toolkit.article&method=full_html MSF's principles and identity – The challenges ahead] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.</ref> was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was the most effective way to solve a problem. Nevertheless over the years, MSF routinely criticized the government of the U.S.A. for inactivity or inadequate response.

In 1979, after four years of refugee movement from South Vietnam and the surrounding countries by foot and [[Boat people#Indochinese boat people|by boat]], French intellectuals made an appeal in ''[[Le Monde]]'' for "A Boat for Vietnam", a project intended to provide medical aid to the refugees. Although the project did not receive support from the majority of MSF, some, including later Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]], chartered a ship called ''L’Île de Lumière'' ("The Island of Light"), and, along with doctors, journalists and photographers, sailed to the [[South China Sea]] and provided some medical aid to the boat people. The splinter organization that undertook this, [[Médecins du Monde]], later developed the idea of [[humanitarian intervention]] as a duty, in particular on the part of Western nations such as France.<ref>Richard Seymour, ''The Liberal Defense of Murder'' (London 2008), p. 174.</ref> In 2007 MSF clarified that for nearly 30 years MSF and Kouchner have had public disagreements on such issues as the right to intervene and the use of armed force for humanitarian reasons. Kouchner is in favor of the latter, whereas MSF stands up for an impartial humanitarian action, independent from all political, economic and religious powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=2053 |title=Dr. Bernard Kouchner and MSF: A Clarification, 22 May 2007 |publisher=Doctorswithoutborders.org |date= |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref>

===MSF development===
In 1982, Malhuret and [[Rony Brauman]] (who became the organisation's president in 1982), brought increased financial independence to MSF by introducing fundraising-by-mail to better collect donations. The 1980s also saw the establishment of the other operational sections from MSF-France (1971): MSF-Belgium (1980), MSF-Switzerland (1981), MSF-Holland (1984), and MSF-Spain (1986). MSF-Luxembourg was the first support section, created in 1986. The early 1990s saw the establishment of the majority of the support sections: MSF-Greece (1990), MSF-USA (1990), MSF-Canada (1991), MSF-Japan (1992), MSF-UK (1993), MSF-Italy (1993), MSF-Australia (1994), as well as Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Hong Kong (MSF-UAE was formed later).<ref name="hih"/><ref name="various">Information obtained from the various sections' websites.</ref>
Malhuret and Brauman were instrumental in professionalising MSF. In December 1979, after the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet army had invaded Afghanistan]], field missions were immediately set up to provide medical aid to the [[mujahideen]], and in February 1980, MSF publicly denounced the [[Khmer Rouge]]. During the [[1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia]], MSF set up nutrition programmes in the country in 1984, but was expelled in 1985 after denouncing the abuse of international aid and the forced resettlements. MSF's explicit attacks on the Ethiopian government led to other NGOs criticizing their abandonment of their supposed neutrality and contributed to a series of debates in France around humanitarian ethics.<ref>Denis Kennedy, "Humanitarian NGOs and the Norm of Neutrality: A Community Approach" <http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/5/1/6/6/pages251669/p251669-1.php>.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Eleanor|title=Famine, aid, and ideology: the political activism of Médecins sans frontières in the 1980s|journal=French Historical Studies|year=2011|volume=34|issue=3|pages=529–58|doi=10.1215/00161071-1259157}}</ref>  The group also set up equipment to produce clean [[drinking water]] for the population of [[San Salvador]], capital of El Salvador, after the 10 October 1986 earthquake that struck the city.<ref name="hih"/><ref name="frchrono80">MSF Article [http://www.medecinssansfrontieres.com/site/site.nsf/pages/80 Chronologie: Années 80 (French)] '''MSF-France'''.

===Sudan===
Since 1979, MSF has been providing medical humanitarian assistance in [[Sudan]], a nation plagued by starvation and the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|ongoing civil war]], prevalent malnutrition and one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. In March 2009, it is reported that MSF has employed 4590 field staff in Sudan<ref name="sudantest">MSF Article (2009) [http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/country.cfm?id=2369%20MSF -MSF in SUDAN - TEST] '''MSF''' Retrieved 20 September 2011</ref> tackling issues such as armed conflicts, epidemic diseases, health care and social exclusion. MSF’s continued presence and work in [[Sudan]] is one of the organization’s largest interventions. MSF provides a range of health care services including nutritional support, reproductive healthcare, Kala-Azar treatment, counselling services and surgery to the people living in [[Sudan]].<ref>MSF Article (2010) [http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=4922&cat=field-news - Sudan: An Overview of MSF's Work in 2010] '''MSF''' Retrieved 20 September 2011.</ref> Common diseases prevalent in [[Sudan]] include [[tuberculosis]], [[kala-azar]] also known as [[visceral leishmaniasis]], [[meningitis]], [[measles]], [[cholera]], and [[malaria]].

====Kala-Azar in Sudan====
[[Kala-azar]], also known as [[visceral leishmaniasis]], has been one of the major health problems in [[Sudan]]. In March 2010, MSF set up its first Kala-Azar treatment centre in Eastern Sudan, providing free treatment for this otherwise deadly disease. If left untreated, there is a fatality rate of 99% within 1–4 months of infection.<ref>MSF Press release (2010) [http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=4924&cat=press-release - Southern Sudan in Grips of Worst Disease Outbreak in Eight Years]'''MSF''' Retrieved 20 September 2011</ref> Since the treatment centre was set up, MSF has cured more than 27,000 [[Kala-Azar]] patients with a success rate of approximately 90-95%.<ref>MSF Article (2010) [http://southsudan.msf.org.au/#KALA%20AZAR - Médecins Sans Frontières South Sudan] ''MSF''' Retrieved 20 September 2011</ref> There are plans to open an additional Kala-Azar treatment centre in [[Malakal]], [[Southern Sudan]] to cope with the overwhelming number of patients that are seeking treatment.

The number of patients seeking treatment increased eight-fold as compared to the year before.<ref name="sudantest" />

====Health care infrastructure in Sudan====
Sudan’s latest civil war began in 1983 and ended in 2005 when a peace agreement was signed between [[North Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]].<ref name="sudantest" /> MSF medical teams were active throughout and prior to the civil war, providing emergency medical humanitarian assistance in multiple locations.<ref name="sudantest" /> The situation of poor infrastructure in the South was aggravated by the civil war and resulted in the worsening of the region’s appalling health indicators. An estimated 75 percent of people in the nascent nation has no access to basic medical care and 1 in seven women dies during childbirth.<ref name="sudantest" /> [[Malnutrition]] and disease outbreaks are perennial concerns as well.
In 2011, MSF clinic in [[Jonglei State]], [[South Sudan]] was looted and attacked by raiders.<ref name="attack">MSF Article (2011) [http://www.msf.org.za/publication/msf-condemns-large-scale-attacks-civilians-south-sudan -MSF condemns large scale attacks on civilians in South Sudan] '''MSF''' Retrieved 20 September 2011</ref> Hundreds, including women and children were killed. Valuable items including medical equipment and drugs were lost during the raid and parts of the MSF facilities were destroyed in a fire.<ref name="attack" /> The incident had serious repercussions as MSF is the only primary health care provider in this part of [[Jonglei State]].<ref name="attack" />

===Early 1990s===
The early 1990s saw MSF open a number of new national sections, and at the same time, set up field missions in some of the most dangerous and distressing situations it had ever encountered.

In 1990, MSF first entered Liberia to help civilians and refugees affected by the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]].<ref>MSF Article [http://www.medecinssansfrontieres.com/association/annees90courte Chronologie: Années 90 (French)] '''MSF-France'''.

Field missions were set up to provide relief to [[Kurd]]ish refugees who had survived the [[al-Anfal Campaign]], for which evidence of atrocities was being collected in 1991.<ref>Choo V (1993) Forensic evidence of Iraqi atrocities against Kurds, ''The Lancet'' 341 (8840): 299–300.</ref> 1991 also saw the beginning of the [[History of Somalia#Somali Civil War|Somali Civil War]], and widespread famine and disease, for which MSF set up field missions in 1992. Failed United Nations interventions led to greater violence, and MSF denounced the organisation's operation in 1993, but volunteers continued to provide health care and food. Since the United Nations left, violence in Somalia has been unhindered, and MSF is one of the few organisations helping affected civilians by running clinics and hospitals.<ref>MSF Article (2005) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=DE35A225-E018-0C72-0982B97BDC25E821&method=full_html Somalia – Saving lives in an abandoned land] '''MSF'''.

MSF first began work in [[Srebrenica]] (in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as part of a UN convoy in 1993, one year after the [[Bosnian War]] had begun. The city had become surrounded by the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] and, containing about 60,000 [[Bosniaks]], had become an enclave guarded by a [[United Nations Protection Force]]. MSF was the only organisation providing medical care to the surrounded civilians, and as such, did not denounce the genocide for fear of being expelled from the country (it did, however, denounce the lack of access for other organisations). MSF was forced to leave the area in 1995, when the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] captured the town. 40,000 [[Bosnian Muslims|Bosniak]] civilian inhabitants were deported, and approximately 7,000 were killed in mass executions.<ref>MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=751B6F1E-B3D6-11D4-B1FA0060084A6370&method=full_html Srebrenica five years on] '''MSF'''.

===Rwanda===
When the [[genocide in Rwanda]] began in April 1994, some delegates of MSF working in the country were incorporated into the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) medical team for protection. Both groups succeeded in keeping all main hospitals in Rwanda's capital [[Kigali]] operational throughout the main period of the genocide. MSF, together with several other aid organisations, had to leave the country in 1995, although many MSF and ICRC volunteers worked together under the ICRC's rules of engagement, which held that neutrality was of the utmost importance. These events led to a debate within the organisation about the concept of balancing neutrality of humanitarian aid workers against their witnessing role. As a result of its Rwanda mission, the position of MSF with respect to neutrality moved closer to that of the ICRC, a remarkable development in the light of the origin of the organisation.<ref>Forsythe DP (2005). International humanitarianism in the contemporary world: forms and issues, ''Human Rights and Human Welfare Working Papers'' {{PDFlink|[http://www.du.edu/gsis/hrhw/working/2005/22-forsythe-2005.pdf Source]|257&nbsp;KB}}</ref>

The ICRC lost 56 and MSF lost almost one hundred of their respective local staff in Rwanda, and MSF-France, which had chosen to evacuate its team from the country (the local staff were forced to stay), denounced the murders and demanded that a [[Military of France|French military]] intervention stop the genocide. MSF-France introduced the slogan ''"One cannot stop a genocide with doctors"'' to the media, and the controversial [[Opération Turquoise]] followed less than one month later.<ref name="hih"/> This intervention directly or indirectly resulted in movements of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees to [[Zaire]] and Tanzania in what became known as the [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]], and subsequent cholera epidemics, starvation and more mass killings in the large groups of civilians. MSF-France returned to the area and provided medical aid to refugees in [[Goma]].<ref>[http://www.msf.fr/site/actu.nsf/actus/msfen1994 One cannot stop a genocide with doctors (French)] '''MSF-France'''.

At the time of the genocide, competition between the medical efforts of MSF, the ICRC, and other aid groups had reached an all time high,<ref>Forsythe DP (1996). The International Committee of the Red Cross and humanitarian assistance – A policy analysis, ''International Review of the Red Cross'' (314): 512–531.</ref> but the conditions in Rwanda prompted a drastic change in the way humanitarian organisations approached aid missions. The ''Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief Programmes'' was created by the ICRC in 1994 to provide a framework for humanitarian missions and MSF is a signatory of this code.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.ifrc.org/cgi/pdf_disasters.pl?codeconduct_signatories.pdf Code of Conduct for the ICRC Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief: List of signatories]}} '''ICRC'''.

==Ongoing missions==
[[File:Médecins Sans Frontières - Missions.svg|thumb|300px|Countries where MSF has missions.]]The [[#Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines|Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines]] was created in late 1999, providing MSF with a new voice with which to bring awareness to the lack of effective treatments and [[vaccine]]s available in developing countries. In 1999, the organisation also spoke out about the lack of humanitarian support in Kosovo and Chechnya, having set up field missions to help civilians affected by the respective political situations. Although MSF had worked in the Kosovo region since 1993, the onset of the [[Kosovo War]] prompted the movement of tens of thousands of refugees, and a decline in suitable living conditions. MSF provided shelter, water and health care to civilians affected by [[Operation Allied Force|NATO’s strategic bombing campaigns]].<ref>MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=6589C7EE-DC2C-11D4-B2010060084A6370&method=full_html Kosovo: The physical and psychological consequences of war] '''MSF'''.

A serious crisis within MSF erupted in connection with the organization's work in Kosovo when the Greek section of MSF was expelled from the organization.

MSF has been active in Uganda since 1980, and provided relief to civilians during the country’s guerrilla war during the [[Uganda since 1979#The Second Obote Period: 1981-1985|Second Obote Period]]. However, the formation of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] saw the beginning of a long campaign of violence in northern Uganda and southern Sudan. Civilians were subjected to mass killings and rapes, torture, and abductions of children, who would later serve as sex slaves or [[child soldier]]s. Faced with more than 1.5&nbsp;million people displaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in [[internally displaced person]] (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation. Diseases such as [[tuberculosis]], measles, polio, cholera, [[ebola]], and HIV/AIDS occur in epidemics in the country, and volunteers provide vaccinations (in the cases of measles and polio) and/or treatment to the residents.

===Cambodia===
MSF first provided medical help to civilians and refugees who have escaped to camps along the Thai-Cambodian border in 1979. Due to long decades of war, a proper [[health care]] system in the country was severely lacking and MSF moved inland in 1989 to help restructure basic medical facilities.

In 1999, Cambodia was hit with a malaria epidemic. The situation of the epidemic was aggravated by a lack of qualified practitioners and poor quality control which led to a market of fake antimalarial drugs. Counterfeit antimalarial drugs were responsible for the deaths of at least 30 people during the epidemic.<ref name="cdcarticle">[http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/counterfeit.html], CDC Article (2010) Counterfeit and Substandard Antimalarial Drugs.

===Libya===
The [[2011 Libyan civil war]] has prompted efforts by MSF to set up a hospital and mental health services to help locals affected by the conflict. The fighting created a backlog of patients that needed surgery. With parts of the country slowly returning to livable, MSF has started working with local health personnel to address the needs. The need for psychological counseling has increased and MSF has set up mental health services to address the fears and stress of people living in tents without water and electricity.

===Sri Lanka===
MSF is involved in Sri Lanka, where a [[Sri Lankan Civil War|26 year civil war]] ended in 2009 and DWB has adapted its activities there to continue its mission. For example, it helps with physical therapy for patients with spinal cord injuries. It conducts counseling sessions, and has set up an “operating theatre for reconstructive orthopaedic surgery and supplied specialist surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses to operate on patients with complicated war-related injuries.”[http://doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/ar/report.cfm?id=5320 International Activity Report 2010]

==Field mission structure==
Before a field mission is established in a country, an MSF team visits the area to determine the nature of the humanitarian emergency, the level of safety in the area and what type of aid is needed. Medical aid is the main objective of most missions, although some missions help in such areas as [[water purification]] and nutrition.<ref>[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/aboutus/what.cfm Field Operations: What Do We Do?] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref>

===Field mission team===
A field mission team usually consists of a small number of coordinators to head each component of a field mission, and a "head of mission." The head of mission usually has the most experience in humanitarian situations of the members of the team, and it is his/her job to deal with the media, national governments and other humanitarian organisations.

Medical volunteers include physicians, surgeons, nurses, and various other specialists. In addition to operating the medical and nutrition components of the field mission, these volunteers are sometimes in charge of a group of local medical staff and provide training for them.

Although the medical volunteers almost always receive the most media attention when the world becomes aware of an MSF field mission, there are a number of non-medical volunteers who help keep the field mission functioning. Logisticians are often the most important members of a team. They are responsible for providing everything that the medical component of a mission needs, ranging from security and vehicle maintenance to food and electricity supplies. They may be engineers and/or [[Construction foreman|foremen]], but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of water treatment and management and financial/administration experts who are placed with field missions.

===Medical component===
Vaccination campaigns are a major part of the medical care provided during MSF missions. Diseases such as [[diphtheria]], measles, [[meningitis]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]], [[yellow fever]], polio, and cholera, all of which are uncommon in developed countries, may be prevented with [[vaccination]]. Some of these diseases, such as cholera and measles, spread rapidly in large populations living in close proximity, such as in a refugee camp, and people must be immunised by the hundreds or thousands in a short period of time.<ref>MSF Article (2003) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=2371723C-A340-45A4-919DDF2685CD9289&method=full_html The Vaccine Gap: NY Times editorial] '''MSF'''.

An equally important part of the medical care provided during MSF missions is AIDS treatment (with [[antiretroviral drug]]s), AIDS testing, and education. MSF is the only source of treatment for many countries in Africa, whose citizens make up the majority of people with HIV and AIDS worldwide.<ref name="whoaids"/> Because antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are not readily available, MSF usually provides treatment for [[opportunistic infection]]s and educates the public on how to slow transmission of the disease.<ref>MSF Article (2004) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=6746E5F4-0A5B-4C1E-B9EFCB10C8509248&method=full_html World AIDS Day MSF country profiles] '''MSF'''.

Since most of the areas that require field missions have been affected by a natural disaster, civil war, or endemic disease, the residents usually require psychological support as well. Although the presence of an MSF medical team may decrease stress somewhat among victims, often a team of [[psychologists]] or [[psychiatrists]] work with victims of depression, [[domestic violence]] and [[substance abuse]]. The doctors may also train local mental health staff.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=67AC8E1E-3EF1-4B0C-A7D473B4C8B1B2B2&method=full_html MSF mental health activities: a brief overview] '''MSF'''.

===Nutrition===
Often in situations where an MSF mission is set up, there is moderate or severe [[malnutrition]] as a result of war, drought, or government economic mismanagement. Intentional starvation is also sometimes used during a war as a weapon, and MSF, in addition to providing food, brings awareness to the situation and insists on foreign government intervention. Infectious diseases and [[diarrhoea]], both of which cause weight loss and weakening of a person's body (especially in children), must be treated with medication and proper nutrition to prevent further infections and weight loss. A combination of the above situations, as when a civil war is fought during times of drought and infectious disease outbreaks, can create famine.<ref>MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=71282930-EC70-11D4-B2010060084A6370&method=full_html Preventing malnutrition and famine] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref>

In emergency situations where there is a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, [[protein-energy malnutrition]] is most common among young children. [[Marasmus]], a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. [[Kwashiorkor]], a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect [[Human development (biology)|physical]] and [[Developmental psychology|mental development]]. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal.<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=CB803D87-94DC-423E-98E2485EAAAC0873&method=full_html Malnutrition definition and MSF treatment] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref> In these situations, MSF sets up ''Therapeutic Feeding Centres'' for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.

A Therapeutic Feeding Centre (or Therapeutic Feeding Programme) is designed to treat severe malnutrition through the gradual introduction of a special diet intended to promote weight gain after the individual has been treated for other health problems. The treatment programme is split between two phases:<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=38EE4ACD-E76C-419D-8888955E03EF9E13&method=full_html MSF Therapeutic Feeding Programmes] '''MSF'''.

* Phase 1 lasts for 24 hours and involves basic health care and several small meals of low energy/protein food spaced over the day.
* Phase 2 involves monitoring of the patient and several small meals of high energy/protein food spaced over each day until the individual’s weight approaches normal.

MSF uses foods designed specifically for treatment of severe malnutrition. During phase 1, a type of therapeutic milk called [[F-75 (food)|F-75]] is fed to patients. F-75 is a relatively low energy, low fat/protein milk powder that must be mixed with water and given to patients to prepare their bodies for phase 2.<ref>Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) F-75 Description '''MSF'''.</ref> During phase 2, therapeutic milk called [[F-100 (food)|F-100]], which is higher in energy/fat/protein content than F-75, is given to patients, usually along with a peanut butter mixture called [[Plumpy'nut]]. F-100 and Plumpy'nut are designed to quickly provide large amounts of nutrients so that patients can be treated efficiently.<ref>Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) F-100 Description '''MSF'''.</ref><ref>Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) Plumpy'nut Description '''MSF'''.</ref> Other special food fed to populations in danger of starvation includes [[enriched flour]] and [[porridge]], as well as a high protein biscuit called [[BP-5 Compact Food|BP5]]. BP5 is a popular food for treating populations because it can be distributed easily and sent home with individuals, or it can be crushed and mixed with therapeutic milk for specific treatments.<ref>Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) BP5 Description '''MSF'''.</ref>

[[Dehydration]], sometimes due to [[diarrhoea]] or cholera, may also be present in a population, and MSF set up rehydration centres to combat this. A special solution called [[Oral rehydration salt|Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS), which contains [[Glucose#Function|glucose]] and [[Electrolyte#Nutrition|electrolyte]]s, is given to patients to [[Rehydration|replace fluids lost]]. [[Antibiotic]]s are also sometimes given to individuals with diarrhoea if it is known that they have cholera or [[dysentery]].<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=BC1A7630-D486-4CA8-8EEB47A3E584FE93&method=full_html Diarrhoea definition and MSF treatment] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref>

===Water and sanitation===
Clean water is essential for [[hygiene]], for consumption and for feeding programmes (for mixing with powdered therapeutic milk or porridge), as well as for preventing the spread of [[water-borne disease]].<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=EAB52196-2CA6-4A93-A46CD6603BBC668D&method=full_html MSF: Water and Health] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref> As such, MSF water engineers and volunteers must create a source of clean water. This is usually achieved by modifying an existing [[water well]], by digging a new well and/or starting a water treatment project to obtain clean water for a population. Water treatment in these situations may consist of storage sedimentation, [[water filtration|filtration]] and/or [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] depending on available resources.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://web.archive.org/web/www.refugeecamp.org/learnmore/water/simple_water_treatment.htm Simple water treatment] '''MSF-UAE'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref>

Sanitation is an essential part of field missions, and it may include education of local medical staff in proper [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilisation]] techniques, [[wastewater treatment]] projects, proper [[Waste management|waste disposal]], and education of the population in personal hygiene. Proper wastewater treatment and water sanitation are the best way to prevent the spread of serious water-borne diseases, such as cholera.<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=3D056CA9-5F50-401F-906979CA03089B2D&method=full_html Cholera definition and MSF treatment] '''MSF'''.

Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref> However, the most important subject in sanitation is the education of the local population, so that proper waste and water treatment can continue once MSF has left the area.

===Statistics===
In order to accurately report the conditions of a humanitarian emergency to the rest of the world and to governing bodies, data on a number of factors are collected during each field mission. The rate of malnutrition in children is used to determine the malnutrition rate in the population, and then to determine the need for feeding centres.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=09972681-0B23-4AF6-B488A0B4A177C6CF&method=full_html Malnutrition: rates and measures] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref> Various types of [[mortality rate]]s are used to report the seriousness of a humanitarian emergency, and a common method used to measure mortality in a population is to have staff constantly monitoring the number of burials at cemeteries.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=C4B3E381-F16B-499D-99550AD3814DE45D&method=full_html Mortality: rates and measures] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref> By compiling data on the frequency of diseases in hospitals, MSF can track the occurrence and location of epidemic increases (or "seasons") and stockpile vaccines and other drugs. For example, the "Meningitis Belt" (sub-Saharan Africa, which sees the most cases of meningitis in the world) has been "mapped" and the meningitis season occurs between December and June. Shifts in the location of the Belt and the timing of the season can be predicted using cumulative data over many years.<ref>WHO Fact Sheet [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/ Meningococcal meningitis] '''WHO'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.</ref>

In addition to epidemiology surveys, MSF also uses [[Statistical survey|survey]]s of populations to determine the rates of violence in various regions. By estimating the scopes of [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], and determining the rate of kidnappings, rapes, and killings, psychosocial programmes can be implemented to lower the [[Epidemiology and Methodology of Suicide|suicide rate]] and increase the sense of security in a population.<ref>MSF Article [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=F8F896F8-C409-4E0E-A6ECE6F5C2034F9B&method=full_html Mental health care crucial in emergency situations] '''MSF'''.

==Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines==
{{Main|Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines}}

The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines was initiated in 1999 to increase access to [[essential medicines]] in developing countries. "Essential medicines" are those drugs that are needed in sufficient supply to treat a disease common to a population.<ref>WHO Health topic [http://www.who.int/topics/essential_medicines/en/ Essential Medicines]</ref> However, most diseases common to populations in developing countries are no longer common to populations in developed countries; therefore, [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] find that producing these drugs is no longer profitable and may raise the price per treatment, decrease development of the drug (and new treatments) or even stop production of the drug. MSF often lacks effective drugs during field missions, and started the campaign to put pressure on governments and pharmaceutical companies to increase funding for essential medicines.

In recent years, it has tried to use its influence to urge the drug maker [[Novartis]] to drop its case against India’s patent law that prevents Novartis from patenting its drugs in [[India]]. A few years earlier, Novartis also sued [[South Africa]] to prevent it from importing cheaper [[AIDS]] drugs. While MSF is generally impartial, the statements by MSF representatives suggest they are taking a somewhat political position. Dr. Tido von Schoen-Angerer, director of DWB's Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines, he says the following: "Just like five years ago, Novartis, with its legal actions, is trying to stand in the way of people's right to access the medicines they need."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=1908&cat=press-release |title=MSF Urges Novartis to Drop Case Against Indian Government &#124; Doctors Without Borders |publisher=Web1.doctorswithoutborders.org |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> MSF launched a petition drive on its website to make Novartis drop the case. The case is an example of how MSF goes beyond being a healthcare provider to being an advocate for human welfare.

On April 1, 2013, it was announced that the Indian court invalidated Novartis's patent on Gleevec. This decision makes the drug available via generics on the Indian market at a considerably lower price. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/01/us-india-novartis-patent-idUSBRE93002I20130401|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>

==Dangers faced by volunteers==
Aside from injuries and death associated with stray bullets, mines and epidemic disease, MSF volunteers are sometimes attacked or kidnapped for political reasons. In some countries afflicted by civil war, humanitarian aid organizations are viewed as helping the enemy, if an aid mission has been set up exclusively for victims on one side of the conflict, and attacked for that reason. However, the [[War on Terrorism]] has generated attitudes among some groups in US-occupied countries that non-governmental aid organizations such as MSF are allied with or even work for the [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]]. Since the United States has labelled its operations "humanitarian actions," independent aid organizations have been forced to defend their positions, or even evacuate their teams.<ref>MSF Article (2004) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=762E8B7B-2F5F-448A-8EC26F2039794E54&method=full_html Military humanitarianism: A deadly confusion] '''MSF'''.

Arrests and abductions in politically unstable regions can also occur for volunteers, and in some cases, MSF field missions can be expelled entirely from a country. [[Arjan Erkel]], Head of Mission in [[Dagestan]] in the [[North Caucasus]], was kidnapped and held hostage in an unknown location by unknown abductors from 12 August 2002 until 11 April 2004. Paul Foreman, head of MSF-Holland, was arrested in Sudan in May 2005 for refusing to divulge documents used in compiling a report on rapes carried out by the pro-government [[Janjaweed]] militias (see [[Darfur conflict]]). Foreman cited the privacy of the women involved, and MSF alleged that the Sudanese government had arrested him because it disliked the bad publicity generated by the report.<ref>MSF Article (2005) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=pressrelease&objectid=32EAA200-E018-0C72-090A4E6450259A24&method=full_html MSF shocked by arrest of Head of Mission in Sudan – charged with crimes against the state] '''MSF'''.

==Documentary==
{{Main|Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders}}

''[[Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders|Living in Emergency]]'' is an award-winning documentary film that tells the story of four MSF volunteer doctors confronting the challenges of medical work in war-torn areas of Liberia and Congo. It premiered at the 2008 [[Venice Film Festival]] and was theatrically released in the United States in 2010.

==1999 Nobel Peace Prize==
President of MSF, James Orbinski gave the Nobel Peace Prize speech on behalf of the organization.  In the opening, he discusses the conditions of the victims of the Rwandan Genocide and focuses on one of his woman patients: “There were hundreds of women, children and men brought to the hospital that day, so many that we had to lay them out on the street and even operate on some of them there.  The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood.  The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated.  Her ears had been cut off.  And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes.  She was one among many — living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering.  We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures.  We were completely overwhelmed, and she knew that there were so many others.  She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha' — 'go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.'"
