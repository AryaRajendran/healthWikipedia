The '''saccule''' is a bed of sensory cells situated in the inner ear.  The saccule translates head movements into neural impulses which the brain can interpret.  The saccule is sensitive to linear translations of the head, specifically movements up and down (for example, moving on an elevator).  When the head moves vertically, the sensory cells of the saccule are disturbed and the neurons connected to them begin transmitting impulses to the brain.  These impulses travel along the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem.   

The vestibular system is important in maintaining [[Balance (ability)|balance]], or [[Equilibrioception|equilibrium]].  The vestibular system includes the saccule, [[utricle (ear)|utricle]], and the three [[semicircular canal]]s.  The [[Vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] is the name of the fluid-filled, membranous duct than contains these organs of balance.  The vestibule is encased in the [[temporal bone]] of the skull.

==Anatomy==

The saccule, or sacculus, is the smaller of the two vestibular sacs. It is globular in form and lies in the [[recessus sphæricus]] near the opening of the [[scala vestibuli]] of the [[cochlea]].  Its cavity does not directly communicate with that of the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]]. The anterior part of the saccule exhibits an oval thickening, the '''macula acustica sacculi''', or macula, to which are distributed the saccular filaments of the vestibular branch of the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]], also known as the [[acoustic nerve]] or [[cranial nerve VIII]].

Within the macula are [[hair cell]]s, each having a [[hair bundle]] on the apical aspect. The hair bundle is composed of a single [[kinocilium]] and many (at least 70) [[stereocilia]].  Stereocilia are connected to mechanically-gated ion channels in the hair cell plasma membrane via [[tip link]]s.  Supporting cells are interdigitate between hair cells and secrete the [[otolithic membrane]], a thick, gelatinous layer of glycoprotein.  Covering the surface of the otolithic membrane are [[otoliths]], which are crystals of calcium carbonate.  For this reason, the saccule is sometimes called an "otolithic organ."

From the posterior wall of the saccule is given off a canal, the '''ductus endolymphaticus'''.  This duct is joined by the ductus utriculosaccularis, and then passes along the aquæductus vestibuli and ends in a blind pouch ('''saccus endolymphaticus''') on the posterior surface of the [[petrous portion]] of the [[temporal bone]], where it is in contact with the [[dura mater]].

From the lower part of the saccule a short tube, the [[Canal of Henson|canalis reuniens of Hensen]], passes downward and opens into the [[ductus cochlearis]] near its vestibular extremity.

The difference between the utricle and the saccule is that both provide information about changes in velocity when travelling either horizontally or vertically. The utricle is more sensitve to horizontal acceleration, whereas the saccule is mulre sensitive to vertical acceleration. <ref>Wiki</ref>

==Physiology==

The saccule gathers sensory information to orientate the body in space. It primarily gathers information about linear movement in the vertical plane. The structures that enable the saccule to gather this vestibular information are the [[hair cell]]s.

Not much is known of how this organ is used in other species. Research has shown, like songbirds, females in some species of fish show seasonal variation in
auditory processing and the sensitivity of the saccule of females peaks during the breeding season. This is due to an increase in the
density of saccular hair cells, partly resulting from reduced [[apoptosis]].<ref>Coflfin B. Allison [http://www.jneurosci.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/content/32/4/i.full.pdf, Saccular-Specific Hair Cell Addition Correlates with Reproductive State-Dependent Changes in the Auditory Saccular Sensitivity of a Vocal Fish] Journal of Neuroscience, January 25, 2012</ref> The increase the hair cells make also increase the sensitivity to male mating calls. An example of this is seen in ''Porichthys notatus'',or plainfin midshipman fish.

==Evolution of the Ear from Saccule==

Research suggests in the vertebrate lineage, [[sensory cells]] became specialized as gravistatic sensors after they became assembled to form the ear. After this aggregation, growth, including duplication and segregation of existing neurosensory epithelia, gave rise to new [[epithelia]] and can be appreciated by comparing sensory epithelia from the inner ears of different vertebrates and their innervation by different neuronal populations. Novel directions of differentiation were apparently further expanded by incorporating unique molecular modules in newly developed sensory epithelia. For example, the saccule gave rise to the auditory epithelium and corresponding neuronal population of tetrapods, starting possibly in an aquatic environment.<ref>Duncan S.

==Assessing Saccular Function==

It is possible to assess saccular function through the use of vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP). The VEMP response is a brief latency muscle relaxation potential that is generated by synchronous discharges of motor units in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle when a loud sound, usually a click, is detected. The myogenic potential is felt to assess saccular function.<ref>Cushing,& Lynn, S. (2008). "Relationship between sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular and balance function in children."
