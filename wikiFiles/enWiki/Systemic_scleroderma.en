'''Systemic sclerosis''' or '''systemic [[scleroderma(medicine)|scleroderma]]''' is an [[systemic autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] or [[connective tissue disease]]. It is characterized by thickening of the skin caused by accumulation of collagen, and by injuries to the smallest arteries. There are two overlapping forms. Limited cutaneous scleroderma is limited to the skin on the face, hands and feet. Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma covers more of the skin, and is at risk of progressing to the visceral organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs and gastrointestinal tract are affected. 

Survival is determined by the severity of visceral disease. Prognosis is difficult to predict until the disease differentiates into recognizable subsets. Patients with limited cutaneous scleroderma have a good prognosis, with 10-year survival of 75%, although <10% develop pulmonary arterial hypertension after 10 to 20 years. Patients with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma have a 10-year survival of 55%. Death is most often from pulmonary, heart and kidney involvement, although survival has greatly improved with effective treatment for kidney failure. Immunosuppressive drugs are used, although glucocorticoids have limited application. 

Annual incidence is 19 per million, and prevalence is 19-75 per 100,000, with a female:male ratio of 3:1, and 8:1 in mid to late childbearing years. Incidence is twice as high among African Americans, and the Choctow Native Americans in Oklahoma have the highest prevalence in the world (469/100,000). There is some hereditary association, some suggestion of immune reaction (molecular mimicry) to a virus, and some cases caused by toxins.<ref name="Harrison's"> {{cite book|author=Kasper, Dennis L; Braunwald, Eugene; Fauci, Anthony; et al.|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2005|pages= |isbn=0-07-139140-7}}</ref> 

==Signs and symptoms==
''Diffuse Scleroderma'' - affects the skin as well as the heart, lungs, GI tract, and kidneys.

''Limited Scleroderma'' - mostly affects the skin of the face, neck and distal elbows and knees and late in the disease causes isolated pulmonary hypertension.  CREST syndrome (Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasias) is associated with limited scleroderma.

===Skin symptoms===
In the [[human skin|skin]], systemic sclerosis causes hardening and scarring. The skin may appear tight, reddish or scaly. Blood vessels may also be more visible. Where large areas are affected, fat and muscle wastage may weaken limbs and affect appearance. Also, patients report substantial, even severe and recurrent [[itch]]ing of large skin areas, the source of much affliction as the condition worsens. There is much variation in severity between patients, with some having scleroderma of only a limited area of the skin (such as the fingers) and little involvement of the underlying tissue; while others have progressive skin involvement.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hinchcliff M, Varga J |title=Systemic sclerosis/scleroderma: a treatable multisystem disease |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=78 |issue=8 |pages=961–8 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18953973 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Other organs===
Diffuse scleroderma can cause [[musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]], [[lung|pulmonary]], [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]], [[kidney|renal]] and other complications.<ref name=Primer>{{cite book |author=Klippel, John H. |title=Primer On the Rheumatic Diseases 11ED |publisher=Arthritis Foundation |location=Atlanta, GA |isbn=1-912423-16-2}}</ref> Patients with larger amounts of cutaneous involvement are more likely to have involvement of the internal tissues and organs. Most patients (over 80%) have vascular symptoms and [[Raynaud's phenomenon]], which leads to attacks of discoloration of the hands and feet in response to cold.  Raynaud's normally affects the [[finger]]s and toes. Systemic scleroderma and Raynaud's can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes which are known as digital ulcers. [[Calcinosis]] (deposition of calcium in lumps under the skin) is also common in systemic scleroderma, and is often seen near the elbows, knees or other [[joints]].

;Musculoskeletal
The first joint symptoms that patients with scleroderma have are typically non specific [[arthralgia|joint pains]], which can lead to [[arthritis]], or cause discomfort in [[tenosynovitis|tendons]] or [[myalgia|muscles]].<ref name=Primer/>  Joint mobility, especially of the small joints of the hand, may be restricted by [[calcinosis]] or skin thickening.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Valentini G, Black C |title=Systemic sclerosis |journal=Best practice & research.

;Lungs
Some impairment in lung function is almost universally seen in patients with diffuse scleroderma on [[pulmonary function test]]ing;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steen VD |title=The lung in systemic sclerosis |journal=Journal of clinical rheumatology |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=40–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16357695 |doi=10.1097/01.rhu.0000152147.38706.db}}</ref> however, it does not necessarily cause symptoms, such as shortness of breath.  Some patients can develop [[pulmonary hypertension]], or elevation in the pressures of the [[pulmonary arteries]].  This can be progressive, and lead to right sided [[heart failure]].  The earliest manifestation of this may be a decreased [[diffusion capacity]] on pulmonary function testing.

Other pulmonary complications in more advanced disease include [[aspiration pneumonia]], [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] and [[pneumothorax]].<ref name=Primer/>

;Digestive tract

Scleroderma can decrease [[motility]] anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name=Sallam/> The most common source of decreased motility involvement is the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to [[dysphagia]] and chest pain. As Scleroderma progresses, esophageal involvement from abnormalities in decreased motility may worsen due to progressive fibrosis (scarring). If this is left untreated, acid from the stomach can back up into the esophagus causing [[esophagitis]], and [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|GERD]]. Further scarring from acid damage to the lower esophagus many times leads to the development of fibrotic narrowing, also known as strictures which can be treated by dilatation, and [[Barrett's esophagus]].  The [[small intestine]] can also become involved, leading to [[bacterial overgrowth]] and [[malabsorption]], of [[bile salts]], [[fat]]s, [[carbohydrates]], [[proteins]], and [[vitamins]].  The [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] can be involved, and can cause [[Ogilvie's syndrome|pseudo-obstruction]] or [[ischemic colitis]].<ref name=Primer/>

Rarer complications include [[pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis]], or gas pockets in the bowel wall, [[diverticulosis|wide mouthed diverticula]] in the colon and [[esophagus]], and [[cirrhosis|liver fibrosis]].  Patients with severe gastrointestinal involvement can become profoundly [[malnutrition|malnourished]].<ref name=Rose/>

Scleroderma may also be associated with [[gastric antral vascular ectasia]] (GAVE), also known as ''watermelon stomach''.  This is a condition where atypical blood vessels proliferate usually in a radially symmetric pattern around the [[pylorus]] of the stomach.  GAVE can be a cause of [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding]] or [[iron deficiency anemia]] in patients with scleroderma.<ref name=Rose/>

;Kidneys
[[Image:Thrombotic microangiopathy - very high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing [[thrombotic microangiopathy]], the [[histomorphology|histomorphologic]] finding seen in scleroderma renal crisis. [[Kidney biopsy]]. [[PAS stain]].]]
Renal involvement, in scleroderma, is considered a poor prognostic factor and frequently a cause of death.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ruangjutipopan S, Kasitanon N, Louthrenoo W, Sukitawut W, Wichainun R |title=Causes of death and poor survival prognostic factors in thai patients with systemic sclerosis |journal=Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand |volume=85 |issue=11 |pages=1204–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12546318 |doi=}}</ref>

The most important clinical complication of scleroderma involving the kidney is ''scleroderma renal crisis''. Symptoms of scleroderma renal crisis are [[malignant hypertension]] (high blood pressure with evidence of acute organ damage), [[Renin|hyperreninemia]] (high renin levels), [[azotemia]] (kidney failure with accumulation of waste products in the blood) and [[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]] (destruction of red blood cells).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steen VD, Mayes MD, Merkel PA |title=Assessment of kidney involvement |journal=Clin.

Many proceed to dialysis, although this can be stopped within three years in about a third of cases. Higher age and (paradoxically) a lower blood pressure at presentation make it more likely that dialysis is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Penn H, Howie AJ, Kingdon EJ, ''et al.'' |title=Scleroderma renal crisis: patient characteristics and long-term outcomes |journal=QJM |volume=100 |issue=8 |pages=485–94 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17601770 |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcm052 |url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/100/8/485}}</ref>

Treatments for scleroderma renal crisis include [[ACE inhibitors]], which are also used for [[prophylaxis]],<ref name=steen11033587/><ref name=jimenez/> and [[renal transplantation]].  Transplanted kidneys are known to be affected by scleroderma and patients with early onset renal disease (within one year of the scleroderma diagnosis) are thought to have the highest risk for recurrence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pham PT, Pham PC, Danovitch GM, ''et al.'' |title=Predictors and risk factors for recurrent scleroderma renal crisis in the kidney allograft: case report and review of the literature |journal=Am.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by clinical suspicion, presence of autoantibodies (specifically [[anti-centromere antibodies|anti-centromere]] and anti-scl70/[[anti-topoisomerase antibodies]]) and occasionally by biopsy. Of the antibodies, 90% have a detectable [[anti-nuclear antibody]]. Anti-centromere antibody is more common in the limited form (80-90%) than in the diffuse form (10%), and anti-scl70 is more common in the diffuse form (30-40%) and in [[African-American]] patients (who are more susceptible to the systemic form).<ref name=JimenezDerk>{{cite journal |author=Jimenez SA, Derk CT |title=Following the molecular pathways toward an understanding of the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=37–50 |year=2004 |pmid=14706971 |doi=}}</ref>

In 1980 the [[American College of Rheumatology]] agreed upon diagnostic criteria for scleroderma.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Preliminary criteria for the classification of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Subcommittee for scleroderma criteria of the American Rheumatism Association Diagnostic and Therapeutic Criteria Committee |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=581–90 |year=1980 |pmid=7378088 |doi=10.1002/art.1780230510}} Available online at {{cite web | title= 1980 Criteria for the Classification of Systemic Sclerosis | work= | url=http://www.rheumatology.org/publications/classification/systsclr.asp | accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

Other conditions may mimic systemic sclerosis by causing hardening of the skin. Diagnostic hints that another disorder is responsible include the absence of [[Raynaud's phenomenon]], a lack of abnormalities in the skin on the hands, a lack of internal organ involvement, and a normal antinuclear antibodies test result.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moenning R and Grau RG|title=Skin hardening, but is it systemic sclerosis? |journal=The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine |date=March 30, 2009 |url=http://jmm.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145622/1391088}}</ref>

==Causes==
There is no clear obvious cause for scleroderma and systemic sclerosis. Genetic predisposition appears to be limited: genetic concordance is small; still, there often is a familial predisposition for autoimmune disease. Polymorphisms in ''[[COL1A2]]'' and ''[[TGF beta 1|TGF-β1]]'' may influence severity and development of the disease. There is limited evidence implicating [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) as the original epitope of the immune reaction. [[Organic solvent]]s and other chemical agents have been linked with scleroderma.<ref name=JimenezDerk/>

One of the suspected mechanisms behind the autoimmune phenomenon is the existence of [[microchimerism]], i.e. fetal cells circulating in maternal blood, triggering an immune reaction to what is perceived as "foreign" material.<ref name=Bianchi>{{cite journal |author=Bianchi DW |title=Fetomaternal cell trafficking: a new cause of disease? |journal=Am.

==Pathophysiology==
The overproduction of collagen is thought to result from an [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune dysfunction]], in which the immune system would start to attack the [[kinetochore]] of the chromosomes. This would lead to genetic malfunction of nearby genes. [[T cell]]s accumulate in the skin; these are thought to secrete [[cytokine]]s and other proteins that stimulate collagen deposition. Stimulation of the [[fibroblast]], in particular, seems to be crucial to the disease process, and studies have converged on the potential factors that produce this effect.<ref name=JimenezDerk/>

A significant player in the process is [[transforming growth factor]] (TGFβ). This protein appears to be overproduced, and the fibroblast (possibly in response to other stimuli) also overexpresses the receptor for this mediator. An intracellular pathway (consisting of ''[[SMAD2]]/[[SMAD3]]'', ''[[SMAD4]]'' and the inhibitor ''[[SMAD7]]'') is responsible for the secondary messenger system that induces [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the proteins and enzymes responsible for collagen deposition. ''Sp1'' is a [[transcription factor]] most closely studied in this context. Apart from TGFβ, [[connective tissue growth factor]] (CTGF) has a possible role.<ref name=JimenezDerk/> Indeed, a common ''CTGF'' gene polymorphism is present at an increased rate in systemic sclerosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fonseca C, Lindahl GE, Ponticos M, ''et al.'' |title=A polymorphism in the CTGF promoter region associated with systemic sclerosis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=357 |issue=12 |pages=1210–20 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17881752 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa067655 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/12/1210}}</ref>  

Damage to [[endothelium]] is an early abnormality in the development of scleroderma, and this too seems to be due to collagen accumulation by fibroblasts, although direct alterations by cytokines, [[platelet]] adhesion and a type II hypersensitivity reaction have similarly been implicated. Increased [[endothelin]] and decreased [[vasodilation]] has been documented.<ref name=JimenezDerk/>

Jimenez & Derk<ref name=JimenezDerk/> describe three theories about the development of scleroderma:
* The abnormalities are primarily due to a physical agent, and all other changes are secondary or reactive to this direct insult.
* The initial event is fetomaternal cell transfer causing microchimerism, with a second summative cause (e.g. environmental) leading to the actual development of the disease.
* Physical causes lead to phenotypic alterations in susceptible cells (e.g. due to genetic makeup), which then effectuate DNA changes which alter the cell's behavior.

== Therapy ==
There is no cure for scleroderma, though there is treatment for some of the symptoms, including drugs that soften the skin and reduce inflammation. Some patients may benefit from exposure to heat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oliver GF, Winkelmann RK |title=The current treatment of scleroderma |journal=Drugs |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=87–96 |year=1989 |pmid=2651089 |doi=10.2165/00003495-198937010-00006}}</ref>

===Topical/symptomatic===
Topical treatment for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. 
A range of [[NSAID]]s (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be used to ease painful symptoms, such as [[naproxen]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There is limited benefit from [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] such as prednisone.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes respond to [[nifedipine]] or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to [[prostacyclin]] analogue [[iloprost]], and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist [[bosentan]] may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon.<ref name=Zandberg>{{cite journal |author=Zandman-Goddard G, Tweezer-Zaks N, Shoenfeld Y |title=New therapeutic strategies for systemic sclerosis--a critical analysis of the literature |journal=Clin.

===Kidney disease===
Scleroderma renal crisis, the occurrence of [[acute renal failure]] and [[malignant hypertension]] (very high blood pressure with evidence of organ damage) in people with scleroderma, is effectively treated with drugs from the class of the [[ACE inhibitor]]s. The benefit of ACE inhibitors extends even to those who have to commence [[hemodialysis|dialysis]] to treat their kidney disease, and may give sufficient benefit to allow the discontinuation of renal replacement therapy.<ref name=Zandberg/>

===Lung disease and pulmonary hypertension===
Active alveolitis is often treated with pulses of [[cyclophosphamide]], often together with a small dose of steroids. The benefit of this intervention is modest.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tashkin DP, Elashoff R, Clements PJ, ''et al.'' |title=Cyclophosphamide versus placebo in scleroderma lung disease |journal=N.

Pulmonary hypertension may be treated with [[epoprostenol]], [[bosentan]] and possibly aerolized iloprost.<ref name=Zandberg/>

===Experimental treatments===
Given the difficulty in treating scleroderma, treatments with a smaller [[evidence based medicine|evidence base]] are often tried to control the disease. These include [[antithymocyte globulin]] and [[mycophenolate mofetil]]; some reports have reported improvements in the skin symptoms as well as delaying the progress of systemic disease, but neither of them have been subjected to large clinical trials.<ref name=Zandberg/>

While still experimental (given its high rate of complications), [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] is being studied in patients with severe systemic sclerosis; improvement in life expectancy and severity of skin changes has been noted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nash RA, McSweeney PA, Crofford LJ, ''et al.'' |title=High-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation for severe systemic sclerosis: long-term follow-up of the U.S. multicenter pilot study |journal=Blood |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages= 1388–96|year=2007 |pmid=17452515 |doi=10.1182/blood-2007-02-072389 |pmc=1939909}}</ref>

== Advocacy ==
The Juvenile Scleroderma Network is an organization dedicated to provide emotional support and educational information to parents and their children living with juvenile scleroderma, to support pediatric research to identify the cause of and the cure for juvenile scleroderma, and to enhance public awareness.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jsdn.org/ | title=Juvenile Scleroderma Network | accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>

In the US, the [[Scleroderma Research Foundation]] is dedicated to raise awareness of the disease and assist those who are affected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scleroderma.org/ | title=Scleroderma Foundation | accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> The Scleroderma Research Foundation sponsors research into the condition.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.srfcure.org | title=Scleroderma Research Foundation | accessdate=2008-05-11}}.</ref> Comedian and television presenter [[Bob Saget]], a board member of the SRF, directed the 1996 ABC TV movie [[For Hope]], starring [[Dana Delany]], which depicts a young woman fatally affected by scleroderma; the film was based on the experiences of Saget's sister Gay.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0116335|title=For Hope}}</ref>
