'''Solar urticaria''' (SU) is a rare condition in which exposure to ultraviolet or [[Ultraviolet radiation|UV radiation]], or sometimes even [[visible spectrum|visible light]], induces a case of [[urticaria]] or hives that can appear in both covered and uncovered areas of the skin.<ref name=Dermnetnz/><ref name=covered>{{cite journal |author=Lugović Mihić L, Bulat V, Situm M, Cavka V, Krolo I |title=Allergic hypersensitivity skin reactions following sun exposure |journal=Collegium Antropologicum |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=153–7 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=19138019}}</ref> It is classified as a type of [[physical urticaria]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Grammer |first=Leslie |coauthors=Roy Patterson, Paul A. Greenberger |title=Patterson's Allergic Diseases: Treatment and Prevention |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2002 |page=244 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=H_vVQZyD-64C&pg=PA244&dq=%22solar+urticaria%22#PPA244,M1 |isbn=978-0-7817-2386-2}}</ref> The classification of disease types is somewhat controversial. One classification system distinguished various types of SU based on the [[wavelength]] of the radiation that causes the breakout; another classification system is based on the type of [[allergen]] that initiates a breakout.<ref name=Clinical/><ref name=pathogenesis/>

The agent in the human body responsible for the reaction to radiation, known as the photoallergen, has not yet been identified.<ref name=Photodermatology/> The disease itself can be difficult  to diagnose  properly because it is so similar to other dermatological disorders, such as polymorphic light eruption or [[Polymorphous light eruption|PMLE]].<ref name=allergic/> The most helpful test is a diagnostic phototest, a specialized test which confirms the presence of an abnormal sunburn reaction. Once recognized, treatment of the disease commonly involves the administration of [[antihistamines]], and [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]] treatments such as [[phototherapy]].<ref name=Dermnetnz/> In more extreme cases, the use of [[immunosuppressive drugs]] and even [[plasmapheresis]] may be considered.<ref name=urticaria.org.uk/>

The initial discovery of the disease is credited to P. Merklen in 1904, but it did not have a name until the suggestion of "solar urticaria" was given by Duke in 1923.<ref name=Photodermatology/><ref name=pediatric>{{cite book |last=Harper |first=John |coauthors=Arnold P. Oranje and Neil S. Prose |title=Textbook of Pediatric Dermatology |publisher=Blackwell Science |year=2000 |page=900 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=z0PEdterBCwC&pg=RA1-PA902&dq=%22solar+urticaria%22+%221904%22#PRA1-PA900,M1 |isbn=978-0-86542-939-0}}</ref> However, their research contributed to the study of this uncommon disease. More than  one hundred cases have been reported in the past century.<ref name=vitro/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Generally, the areas affected are exposed skin not usually protected by clothing; however it can also occur in areas covered by clothing.<ref name=Dermnetnz/><ref name=covered/><ref name=immunologically>{{cite journal |author=Gambichler T, Al-Muhammadi R, Boms S |title=Immunologically mediated photodermatoses: diagnosis and treatment |journal=American Journal of Clinical Dermatology |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=169–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19354331 |doi=10.2165/00128071-200910030-00003}}</ref> The areas constantly subjected to the sun's rays may only be slightly affected if at all. Parts of the body only thinly covered can potentially be subjected to an outbreak.

Life with SU can be difficult. Patients are subject to constant itching and pain as within minutes of the initial exposure to UV radiation, a rash will appear. The urticarial reaction begins in the form of [[pruritus]], later progressing to [[erythema]] and [[edema]] in the exposed areas of the skin. If vast areas of the body are affected, the loss of fluid into the skin could lead to light-headedness, headache, nausea and vomiting.<ref name=Dermnetnz>{{cite web |url=http://dermnetnz.org/reactions/solar-urticaria.html |title=Solar urticaria |accessdate=2008-10-06 |last=Ngan |first=Vanessa |date=2008-03-10 |publisher=New Zealand Dermatological Society Incorporated}}</ref><ref name=exercise/> Rarely, patients have been reported to experience [[bronchospasm]]. Also, if a large area of the body is suddenly exposed, the person may be subject to an [[anaphylactic reaction]]. Once free of exposure, the rash will fade away within several hours.<ref name=color>{{cite book |last=Kane |first=Kay |coauthors=Jen Bissonette Ryder, Richard Allen Johnson, Howard P.

== Causes ==
Solar urticaria is an [[immunoglobulin E]]-mediated hypersensitivity that can be introduced through primary or secondary factors, or induced by exogenous photosensitization.<ref name=Diseases/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Botto NC, Warshaw EM |title=Solar urticaria |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=909–20; quiz 921–2 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19022098 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.08.020}}</ref> Primary SU is believed to be a [[type I hypersensitivity]] (a mild to severe reaction to an antigen including [[anaphylaxis]]) in which an [[antigen]], or substance provoking an immune response, is "induced by UV or visible radiation."<ref name=Diseases/> Secondary SU can occur when a person comes into contact with chemicals such as [[tar]], [[pitch (resin)|pitch]], and [[dyes]]. People who use drugs such as [[benoxaprofen]] or patients with [[erythropoietic protoporphyria]] may also contract this secondary form.<ref name=Diseases>{{cite book |last=Ostler |first=H. Bruce |coauthors=Howard Maibach, Axel Hoke and Ivan Schwab |title=Diseases of the Eye and Skin: A Color Atlas |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2003 |location= |page=21 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=jewuK_B-3bcC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=%22primary+and+secondary+solar+urticaria%22 |isbn=978-0-7817-4999-2}}</ref> These items that cause this [[photosensitivity]] are exogenous photosensitizers because they are outside of the body and cause it to have a greater sensitivity to light.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ring |first=Johannes |title=Allergy in Practice |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |page=170 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nk2zz410GI8C&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=%22exogenous+photosensitization+solar+urticaria%22 |isbn=978-3-540-00219-2}}</ref>

Also, there have been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those susceptible to visible light, white t-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white t-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gardeazabal J, González-Pérez R, Bilbao I, Alvarez-Hernández MI, Aguirre A, Díaz-Pérez JL |title=Solar urticaria enhanced through clothing |journal=Photodermatology, Photoimmunology & Photomedicine |volume=14 |issue=5–6 |pages=164–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9826887 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0781.1998.tb00036.x}}</ref> Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic [[tetracycline]] for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yap LM, Foley PA, Crouch RB, Baker CS |title=Drug-induced solar urticaria due to tetracycline |journal=The Australasian Journal of Dermatology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=181–4 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10954992 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0960.2000.00435.x}}</ref>

It is not yet known what specific agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated [[autologous]] serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When people who did not have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not [[phototoxic]].<ref name=Photodermatology>{{cite book |last=Lim |first=Henry |coauthors=Herbert Honigsmann and John L.

== Diagnosis ==
Solar urticaria can be difficult to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roelandts R |title=Diagnosis and treatment of solar urticaria |journal=Dermatologic Therapy |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=52–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12919127 |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8019.2003.01608.x}}</ref> There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are [[patch test (medicine)|patch test]]s conducted when it is believed that a patient is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.

Another test known as a phototest is the most useful in identifying solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation in order to determine the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the [[urticaria]] to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.<ref name=Dermnetnz/><ref name=FSU/>

A third form of testing is the photoprovocation test which is used to identify disorders instigated by sun burns. The process of this test involves exposing one area of a patient's arm to certain dosage of UVB radiation and one area on the other arm to a certain dosage of UVA radiation. The amount of radiation that the patient is exposed to is equal to that "received in an hour of midday summer sun." If the procedure produces a rash, then the patient will undergo a [[biopsy]]. Finally, there are laboratory tests which generally involve procedures such as blood, urine, and fecal biochemical tests. In some situations, a [[skin biopsy]] may be performed.<ref name=Dermnetnz/>

=== Classification ===
Solar urticaria, due to its particular features, is considered to be a type of physical urticaria or [[light sensitivity]]. Physical urticaria arises from physical  factors in the environment,  which in the  case of solar urticaria is   UV radiation or light.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Physical urticaria |journal=Immunology and allergy clinics of North America|date=22 June 1995|first=C. M. |last=Schafer |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=189 |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2914541 |accessdate=2009-05-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dice JP |title=Physical urticaria |journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=225–46, vi |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15120149|doi=10.1016/j.iac.2004.01.005}}</ref> SU may be classified based on the wavelength of the radiative energy that causes the allergic reaction; known as Harber's classification, six types have been identified in this system.<ref name=vitro/> Type I solar urticaria is caused by UVB (ultraviolet B) radiation, with wavelengths ranging from 290–320&nbsp;[[nanometers|nm]]. Type II is induced by UVA (ultraviolet A) radiation with wavelengths that can range from 320–400&nbsp;nm. The wavelength range of type III and IV spans from 400 to 500&nbsp;nm, while type V can be caused by UVB radiation to visible light (280–600&nbsp;nm). Type VI has only been known to occur at 400&nbsp;nm.<ref name=Clinical>{{cite book |last=Lim |first=Henry |coauthors=Nicholas Soter |title=Clinical Photomedicine |publisher=CRC Press |year=1993 |page=183 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=M9o1lrs_JhwC&pg=PA181&dq=type+I+solar+urticaria |isbn=978-0-8247-8862-9}}</ref>

Another classification distinguishes two types. The first is a [[hypersensitivity]] caused by a reaction to photoallergens located only in people with SU; while the second is caused by photoallergens that can be found in both people with SU and people without it.<ref name=pathogenesis>{{cite journal |author=Leenutaphong V, Hölzle E, Plewig G |title=Pathogenesis and classification of solar urticaria: a new concept |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=21 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=237–40 |year=1989 |month=August|pmid=2671065 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(89)70167-5}}</ref>

A subgroup of solar urticaria, fixed solar urticaria, has also been identified. It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with [[wheals]] (swollen areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar urticaria is induced by a broad spectrum of radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700&nbsp;nm.<ref name=FSU>{{cite journal |author=Schwarze HP, Marguery MC, Journé F, Loche E, Bazex J |title=Fixed solar urticaria to visible light successfully treated with fexofenadine |journal=Photodermatology, Photoimmunology & Photomedicine |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=39–41 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11169175 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0781.2001.017001039.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Tuchinda C, Leenutaphong V, Sudtim S, Lim HW |title=Fixed solar urticaria induced by UVA and visible light: a report of a case |journal=Photodermatology, Photoimmunology & Photomedicine |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=97–9 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15752128 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0781.2005.00148.x}}</ref>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
[[Polymorphous light eruption]] (PMLE) is the easiest disease to mistake for solar urticaria because the locations of the lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. [[Lupus erythematosus]] has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have [[erythropoietic protoporphyria]]. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of [[protoporphyrin]] in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, [[cholinergic urticaria]], or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.<ref name=allergic>{{cite book |last=Leung |first=Donald |coauthors=Malcolm W. Greaves |title=Allergic Skin Disease: A Multidisciplinary Approach |publisher=Informa Health Care |year=2000 |page=205 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=HGykVBki2wwC&pg=PA205&dq=%22solar+urticaria%22+%22differential+diagnosis%22 |isbn=978-0-8247-0287-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ryckaert S, Roelandts R |title=Solar urticaria.

== Management ==

=== Antihistamines ===
Histamines are proteins associated with many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light comes in contact with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from [[mast cells]]. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress the activity of the histamine.<ref name=Davidson>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/Immunology/Students/spring2000/lamar/mfirp.htm |title=Histamine |accessdate=2008-11-01 |year=2000 |publisher=Davidson College}}</ref>

[[Diphenhydramine]], a first-generation [[H1 antagonist|H1 receptor antagonist]] or medicine that combats the [[H1 receptor]] that is associated with many allergic reactions,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Taranova NP |title=[Effect of whole-body x-irradiation on the composition and metabolism of rat brain lipids] |language=Russian |journal=Radiobiologiia |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=821–5 |year=1975 |pmid=1219830}}</ref> has been found to be the most potent antihistamine for this particular disease. Patients prescribed 50 milligrams four times per day have been able to sustain normal exposure to the sun without suffering a reaction.

Patients with less potent forms of solar urticaria such as fixed solar urticaria can be treated with the medication [[fexofenadine]], which may also be used prophylactically to prevent recurrence.<ref name=FSU/>

=== Desensitization ===
This form of treatment is meant to reduce the intensity or altogether eliminate the allergic reactions people have by gradually increasing exposure to the form of radiation that brings about the reaction. In the case of solar urticaria, [[phototherapy]] and photochemotherapy are the two major [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]] treatments.<ref name=phototherapy/>

[[Phototherapy]] can be used for prevention. Exposure to a certain form of light or UV radiation  enables the patient to build up a tolerance and outbreaks can be reduced. This type of treatment is generally conducted in the spring.<ref name=emedicine/> However, the benefits of this  therapy only last for two to three days.<ref name=dermatology/>

Photochemotherapy, or [[PUVA]], is considered superior to [[phototherapy]] because it produces a longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is to build up the patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough so that they can be outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.<ref name=phototherapy>{{cite book |last=Krutmann |first=Jean |coauthors=Herbert Hönigsmann, Craig A. Elmets and Paul R. Bergstresser |title=Dermatological Phototherapy and Photodiagnostic Methods |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |pages=117–118 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=15IAyh_ecsAC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=%22Solar+Urticaria%22 |isbn=978-3-540-67789-5}}</ref>

=== Immunosuppression ===
Doctors will sometimes prescribe [[immunosuppressive drug]]s such as [[prednisolone]] and [[ciclosporin]] if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, the side effects of these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.<ref name=urticaria.org.uk/><ref name=immunologically/>

=== Plasmapheresis ===
In more extreme cases, [[plasmapheresis]] can be considered. This technique is used to remove the blood plasma or fluid in the red blood cells and then return the cells to the body. It "removes a circulating factor from the blood that may be involved in causing the urticaria," but is still being tested and is not always effective.<ref name=urticaria.org.uk>{{cite web |url=http://www.urticaria.org.uk/article9.html |title=Solar urticaria |accessdate=2008-10-25 |year=2006 |publisher=urticaria.org.uk}}</ref> When the treatment is a success, the patient's [[photosensitivity]] is decreased to the degree that they can undergo [[PUVA]] which can result in the relief of the urticarial outbreaks for an extended period of time. The major setback to this treatment is that the side effects can be severe and may include [[anaphylactoid reactions]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Katsambas |first=Andreas |coauthors=Torello M.

== Epidemiology ==
In the United States, only about 4% of patients with photosensitive disorders are reported to have been diagnosed with solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%.<ref name=emedicine/> Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians have a better chance of getting the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kerr HA, Lim HW |title=Photodermatoses in African Americans: a retrospective analysis of 135 patients over a 7-year period |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=638–43 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17630044 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2007.05.043}}</ref> Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males.<ref>http://www.clinuvel.com/skin-conditions/rare-skin-conditions/solar-urticaria</ref> The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy.<ref name=emedicine>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic448.htm |title=Urticaria, Solar |accessdate=2008-10-06 |last=Baron |first=Elma |coauthors=Charles R.

== History ==
Solar urticaria was first identified by P. Merklen in 1904.<ref name=pediatric/> Just a year later, in 1905, Ward became the first to induce urticaria through exposure to the sun in a controlled environment. The first documented case came in Japan in 1916. The name "solar urticaria" was proposed in 1923. In 1928 urticaria was induced for the first time. This was carried out by phototesting with increasing amounts of radiation of varying wavelengths. In 1942 the disease was passively transferred to normal volunteers using serum from patients with solar urticaria.<ref name=Photodermatology/><ref name=vitro>{{cite journal |title=A Case of Type IV Solar Urticaria Identified by Reversed in Vitro Serum Test |journal=Tokai Journal of Experimental and Clinical Medicine |date=2003-03-27 |first=Hirotake |last=Ozaki |coauthors=Takashi Matsuyama, Yo Kawakubo, Motomi Miyahara, Akira Ozawa |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=51–55 |url=http://mj.med.u-tokai.ac.jp/pdf/280202.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-01-30 |pmid=14714829}}</ref>
