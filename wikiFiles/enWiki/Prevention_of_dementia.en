'''Prevention of dementia''' is the attempt to avoid developing [[dementia]]. Although no cure for dementia is available, there are many ways to decrease the risk of acquiring dementia in the first place, including both lifestyle changes and medication.

==Lifestyle==

===Mental activity===
{{Main|Brain fitness}}
"Use it or lose it" might be applied to the brain when it comes to dementia. Intellectual activities help keep the mind in shape in the older days. Activities such as reading, playing cards and board games and playing a musical instrument prevent dementia of both [[Alzheimer's]] and [[vascular dementia]].<ref name="wvdhhr">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/hsc/dementia/prevent.htm |title=Prevention of Dementia |work=Dementia: The Growing Crisis in West Virginia |month=February |year=2005 |first1=Eugenia |last1=Thoenen |author2=Health Statistics Center Statistical Staff |first3=James |last3=Doria |first4=Fred |last4=King |first5=Thomas N. |last5=Leonard |first6=Tom |last6=Light |first7=Philip |last7=Simmons |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> The risk decreases proportionally to the frequency of activity.<ref name="wvdhhr"/>

Besides activities during spare time, certain types of occupations may also prevent dementia, especially during the thirties, forties and fifties.<ref name="wvdhhr"/> A good job in this case is any mentally demanding one.

Why activity contributes to prevent dementia could be explained by a "brain reserve" built up by the brain: additional connections between [[neuron]]s are created, connections more resistant to the deterioration seen in dementia.<ref name="wvdhhr"/>

===Physical activity===
Since [[vascular dementia]] is the second most common form of dementia (after [[Alzheimer's disease]]), decreasing risk factors for [[cerebrovascular disease]] also decreases the risk factors for dementia. Thus, physical exercise, having good blood [[cholesterol]], healthy [[body weight]] and [[blood pressure]] lowers the risk of developing dementia.<ref name ="wvdhhr"/> An active lifestyle can almost halve the risk compared to a sedentary one.<ref name="wvdhhr"/>

The effect of physical activity is not limited to vascular effects. For instance, it can give rise to new [[neurons]] in the brain, as well as releasing a substance that can protect them.<ref name="wvdhhr"/>

Some studies say Alzheimer's and other dementias may be caused by high blood pressure, since it can cause blood vessel damage by constricting them.<ref>{{cite news |date=28 July 2008 |title=Blood pressure drug dementia hope |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7528539.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title =Blood Pressure Drugs May Protect Against Alzheimer's |publisher=Boston University School of Medicine |date=27 July 2008 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/27/AR2008072701213.html |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref>

===Diet===
[[Obesity]] increases the risk of any dementia and [[Alzheimer's disease]] in particular.<ref name="wvdhhr"/>  The effect of [[alcoholism|alcohol]] on the risk of dementia is a J-shape.<ref name=Review09>{{cite journal |author=Chen JH, Lin KP, Chen YC |title=Risk factors for dementia |journal=J. Formos. Med. Assoc. |volume=108 |issue=10 |pages=754–64 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19864195 |doi=10.1016/S0929-6646(09)60402-2 |url=}}</ref> High alcohol consumption increases the risk of dementia<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grønbaek M |title=The positive and negative health effects of alcohol- and the public health implications |journal=J.

The effects of [[omega-3 fatty acid]] in the prevention of dementia is uncertain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cederholm T, Palmblad J |title=Are omega-3 fatty acids options for prevention and treatment of cognitive decline and dementia? |journal=Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care|volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=150–5 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20019606|doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e328335c40b |url=}}</ref>  Vegetables and nuts may be of benefit,<ref name="wvdhhr"/> because of their high content of [[polyunsaturated fat]]s. Non-fish meat, on the other hand, increases the risk of Alzheimer's,<ref name="wvdhhr"/> because of its high content of [[saturated fat]]. However, consumption of fish should be limited due to concerns over mercury poisoning, which could exacerbate the symptoms of dementia.
Estrogen may also help in the prevention of dementia but cannot help when dementia is already present and when cognitive function is already impaired. It increases cerebral blood flow and is an anti-inflammatory agent, enhancing activity at the neuronal synapses in the brain. It may also help to increase brain activation in regions that are affected by dementia which is mainly the hippocampus region.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Eileen M., Welsh |title= Focus on Alzheimer's disease research |journal= Nova Biomedical books |pages= 699 |year= 2003}}</ref>
[[Niacin]] (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) is also believed to prevent dementia as research shows those who have the highest levels of niacin in their blood, are believed to have the lowest risk of developing dementia or having cognitive decline. Niacin is involved with DNA synthesis and repair and also neural cell signaling, it improves circulation and reduces cholesterol levels. In order for niacin to have a positive effect on the brain, it is recommended that patients have 100 to 300 mg per day.<ref name="Robert2006" />

===Sleep pattern===
Prolonged, more than nine hours, sleep duration (night-time sleep and daytime napping) may be associated with an increased risk of dementia.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2009.02618.x |pmid=19473367 |year=2009 |last1=Benito-León |first1=J |last2=Bermejo-Pareja |first2=F |last3=Vega |first3=S |last4=Louis |first4=ED |title=Total daily sleep duration and the risk of dementia: a prospective population-based study |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=990–7 |journal=European journal of neurology}}</ref>

==Medication==

===Hypertension medications===
The etiology of [[vascular dementia]] includes [[hypertension]], and thus, lowering blood pressure with [[antihypertensive]]s may have a positive effect in the prevention of dementia, just as physical activity.

However, a study failed to demonstrate a link between high blood pressure and developing dementia. The study, published in the ''Lancet Neurology'' journal July 2008, found that blood pressure lowering medication did not reduce the incidence of dementia to a statistically significant degree.  A prospective meta-analysis of the data from this study with other studies suggested that further research might be warranted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peters R, Beckett N, Forette F, et al. |title=Incident dementia and blood pressure lowering in the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial cognitive function assessment (HYVET-COG): a double-blind, placebo controlled trial |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=683–9 |year=2008 |month= August |pmid=18614402 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70143-1 |last2=Burch |first1=investigators |last3=Fletcher |last4=Bulpitt |last1=Hyvet}}</ref>

===Anti-diabetic drugs===
Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for [[vascular dementia]], and is thus lowered with [[anti-diabetic drug]]s.<ref name="mayoclinic">{{cite press release |title=Diabetes and Alzheimer's linked |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] |date=6 November 2008 |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diabetes-and-alzheimers/AZ00050 |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref>

Besides, [[Rosiglitazone]] (Avandia) improves memory and thinking ability to people with mild Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism of the effect might be due to the ability of the drug to reduce [[insulin resistance]].<ref name="wvdhhr"/> Thus, less insulin needs to be released to achieve its metabolic effects. Insulin in the bloodstream is a trigger of [[amyloid beta]]-production,<ref name="mayoclinic"/> so decreased insulin levels decrease the level of amyloid beta. This leads to less formation of [[amyloid]] plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease.

===NSAIDs===
[[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) can decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.<ref name="wvdhhr"/> The length of time needed to prevent dementia varies, but in most studies it is usually between 2 and 10 years.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18509093 |year=2008 |last1=Szekely |first1=CA |last2=Green |last3=Breitner |last4= Østbye |last5=Beiser |last6=Corrada |last7=Dodge |last8=Ganguli |last9=Kawas |title=No advantage of "Aβ42-lowering" NSAIDs for prevention of AD in six pooled cohort studies |volume=70 |issue=24 |pages=2291–8 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000313933.17796.f6 |journal=Neurology |first2=RC |first3=JC |first4=T |first5=AS |first6=MM |first7=HH |first8=M |first9=CH |pmc=2755238}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15084783 |year=2004 |last1=Cornelius |first1=C |last2=Fastbom |last3=Winblad |last4=Viitanen |title=Aspirin, NSAIDs, risk of dementia, and influence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele in an elderly population |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=135–43 |doi=10.1159/000075957 |journal=Neuroepidemiology |first2=J |first3=B |first4=M}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12869452 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7407.128 |year=2003 |last1=Etminan |first1=M |last2=Gill |last3=Samii |title=Effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on risk of Alzheimer's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies |volume=327 |issue=7407 |pages=128 |journal=BMJ |first2=S |first3=A |pmc=165707}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12827329 |year=2003 |last1=Nilsson |first1=SE |last2=Johansson |last3=Takkinen |last4=Berg |last5= Zarit |last6=Mcclearn |last7=Melander |title=Does aspirin protect against Alzheimer's dementia?

Alzheimer's disease causes inflammation in the [[neuron]]s by its deposits of [[amyloid beta]] peptides and [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s. These deposits irritate the body by causing a release of e.g. [[cytokines]] and [[acute phase protein]]s, leading to inflammation. When these substances accumulate over years they contribute to the effects of Alzheimer's.<ref> {{cite journal |pmid=10858586 |year=2000 |last1=Akiyama |first1=H |last2=Barger |last3=Barnum |last4=Bradt |last5=Bauer |last6=Cole |last7=Cooper |last8=Eikelenboom |last9=Emmerling |title=Inflammation and Alzheimer's disease |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=383–421 |journal=Neurobiology of Aging |doi=10.1016/S0197-4580(00)00124-X |first2=S |first3=S |first4=B |first5=J |first6=GM |first7=NR |first8=P |first9=M}}</ref> NSAIDs inhibit the formation of such inflammatory substances, and prevent the deteriorating effects.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16386371 |year=2006 |last1=Tortosa |first1=E |last2=Avila |last3=Pérez |title= Acetylsalicylic acid decreases tau phosphorylation at serine 422 |volume=396 |issue=1 |pages=77–80 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2005.11.066 |journal=Neuroscience letters |first2=J |first3=M}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16125740 |year=2005 |last1=Hirohata |first1=M |last2=Ono |last3=Naiki |last4=Yamada |title=Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have anti-amyloidogenic effects for Alzheimer's beta-amyloid fibrils in vitro |volume=49 |issue=7 |pages=1088–99 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2005.07.004 |journal=Neuropharmacology |first2=K |first3=H |first4=M}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid= 11711868 |year=2001 |last1=Thomas |first1=T |last2=Nadackal |last3=Thomas |title=Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit amyloid-beta aggregation |volume=12 |issue= 15 |pages=3263–7 |journal=NeuroReport |doi=10.1097/00001756-200110290-00024 |first2= TG |first3= K}}</ref>

===Vaccine===
There is yet no [[vaccine]] against dementia.<ref name="wvdhhr"/> Such a vaccine could activate the body's own [[immune system]] to combat the [[beta amyloid]] plaques in Alzheimer's disease. One problem to overcome is overreaction from the immune system, leading to [[encephalitis]].<ref name="wvdhhr"/>
