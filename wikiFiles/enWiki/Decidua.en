'''Decidua''' is the term for the [[uterus|uterine]] lining ([[endometrium]]) during a [[pregnancy]], which forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. It is formed under the influence of [[progesterone]] and forms highly-characteristic cells.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''deciduus'', meaning ''falling off'' or ''shedding''.

==Background==
After [[ovulation]], in [[mammal]]s, the endometrial lining becomes transformed into a secretory lining in preparation of accepting the [[embryo]]. Without [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], the secretory lining will be absorbed ([[estrous cycle]]) or shed ([[menstrual cycle]]). 

With implantation the lining now termed ''decidua'' evolves further during the pregnancy. 

The decidua is shed during the [[parturition]] process.

==Structure==
Different layers of the deciduas have been described:
* a compact outer layer (''stratum compactum'')
* an intermediate layer (''stratum spongiosum'')
* a boundary layer adjacent to the [[myometrium]] ('Stratum Basalis').

That part of the decidua that interacts with the trophoblast is the ''decidua basalis'' (also called ''decidua placentalis''). The remainder of the decidua is termed the ''decidua parietalis'' or ''decidua vera''. Also, there is the ''decidua capsularis'', which grows over the embryo on the luminal side, enclosing it into the endometrium and surrounding the embryo together with decidua basalis.

The decidua has a [[histology|histologically]]-distinct appearance, displaying large polygonal decidual cells in the stroma. These are enlarged endometrial stromal cells, which resemble [[epithelium]] (and are referred to as "epithelioid"). 

Formation of a specialized decidua is called [[decidualization]], which is a special property of endometrium seen only in [[hemochorial placentation]]. 

Decidualization includes the process of differentiation of the spindle-shape stromal fibroblasts into the plump secretory decidual cells, which create a pericellular extracellular matrix rich in [[fibronectin]] and [[laminin]] (similar to epithelial cells). 

Vascularity, as well as vascular permeability, is enhanced in the decidualizing endometrium. 

Its [[leukocyte]] population is distinct, with the presence of large endometrial granular leukocytes being predominant, while polynuclear leukocytes and B-cells are scant. 

The large granular lymphocytes (CD56 bright) are called "uterine [[NK cells]]" or "uNK cells" in mice, and "decidual NK cells" or "dNK cells" in humans. 

The region of fibrinoid degeneration where trophoblasts meet decidua is called ''Nitabuch's layer''. This layer is absent in [[placenta accreta]].<ref>{{cite book|first=[edited by] F. Gary Cunningham ... [et al.]|title=Williams obstetrics.|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York ; Toronto|isbn=9780071413152|edition=22nd ed.}}</ref> 

==Role==
As the maternal interface to the embryo the decidua participates in the exchanges of nutrition, gas, and waste with the gestation. It also protects the pregnancy from the maternal [[immune system]]. Further, the decidua has to allow a very controlled invasion of the trophoblast. 

In invasive placental disorders like [[placenta accreta]] decidualization have been consistently found to be deficient.

==Hormone production==
The decidua secretes [[hormones]], [[growth factor]]s, and [[cytokine]]s. It has receptors for [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[growth hormone]], and others. 

Among its products are hormones commonly associated with other organs such as [[cortisol]], [[CRF]], [[GnRH]], [[prolactin]], and [[relaxin]]. Decidual prolactin is not under [[dopamine]]rgic control. 

[[Pregnancy protein 14]] (PP-14), also called placental protein 12, and [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1]](IGFBP1) appear to be specific products of the secretory and decidual lining. 

Other factors released include [[interleukin]]-15 and [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF). A reasonable understanding of the role and interplay of these hormones and factors has not been evolved.

*In case of an [[extrauterine pregnancy]], the endometrium nevertheless becomes decidualized. A woman may shed the lining in the form of a decidual cast, which may be mistaken as a [[miscarriage]], when, in fact, the ectopic still persists.
*A [[decidual reaction]] can be observed in tissue of the [[peritoneum]] and [[ovary]] during a pregnancy, and represents a response of stromal tissue to progesterone.
*Decidua in a lymph node may mimic [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[carcinoma]].<ref name=pmid15859655>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Wu | first1 = DC. | last2 = Hirschowitz | first2 = S. | last3 = Natarajan | first3 = S. | title = Ectopic decidua of pelvic lymph nodes: a potential diagnostic pitfall. | journal = Arch Pathol Lab Med | volume = 129 | issue = 5 | pages = e117-20 | month = May | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1043/1543-2165(2005)129e117:EDOPLN2.0.CO;2 | PMID = 15859655 }}</ref>
