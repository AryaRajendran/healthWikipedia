'''Distal hereditary motor neuropathies''' (distal HMN, dHMN) are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of [[motor neuron disease]]s that result from genetic [[mutation]]s in various [[gene]]s and are characterized by degeneration and loss of [[motor neuron]] cells in the [[anterior horn of spinal cord|anterior horn of the spinal cord]] and subsequent muscle [[atrophy]].

Even though they can hardly be distinguished from [[hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies]] on the clinical level, dHMNs are a considered a separate class of disorders.

== Classification ==
In 1993, A. E. Hardnig proposed to classify hereditary motor neuropathies into seven groups based on age at onset, mode of inheritance, and presence of additional features. This initial classification has since been widely adopted and expanded and currently looks as follows:<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/hmg/ddh226}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1001/archneur.63.6.812}}</ref>
