'''Associative visual agnosia''' is a form of [[visual agnosia]]. It is an impairment in [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] or assigning meaning to a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] that is accurately [[perception|perceived]] and not associated with a generalized deficit in [[intelligence]], [[memory]], [[language]] or [[attention]].<ref name="Bauer">{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Russell M. |editor-first=P.J. |editor-last=Snyder |others=P.D.

===Object recognition model===
[[File:Object Recognition Model.png|thumb|Depiction of the object recognition model, adapted from Bauer's Clinical Application of a Cognitive Neuropsychological Model of Object Recognition<ref name="Bauer"/>|alt=Object Recognition Model.]]

[[Cognitive psychology]] often conceptualizes this deficit as an impairment in the object recognition process.  Currently visual agnosias are commonly explained in terms of cognitive models of object recognition or identification.<ref name="Charnallet">{{cite journal|last=Charnallet|first=A.|coauthors=S. Carbonnelb, D. Davida, & O. Moreauda|title=Associative visual agnosia: A case study|journal=Behavioural Neurology|year=2008|month=March|volume=19|issue=1-2|pages=41–44|pmid=18413915|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=dca6fdc6-ef02-4ab3-80b1-6d2305ac5e85%40sessionmgr15&vid=1&hid=106&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=31607250|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref>  The cognitive system for visual object identification is a hierarchal process, broken up into multiple steps of processing.<ref name="DeRenzi"/>

In the object recognition unit model by Marr (1980),<ref name=Marr>{{cite journal |author=Marr D |title=Visual information processing: the structure and creation of visual representations |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume=290 |issue=1038 |pages=199–218 |year=1980 |month=July |pmid=6106238 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1980.0091 |url=}}</ref> the process begins with sensory perception (vision) of the object, which results in an initial representation via feature extraction of basic forms and shapes. This is followed by an integration stage, where elements of the visual field combine to form a visual percept image, the 'primary sketch'.  This is a 2½ dimensional (2½D) stage with a 'viewer-centered' object representation, where the features and qualities of the object are presented from the viewer's perspective.<ref name="Carlesimo"/> The next stage is formation of a 3 dimensional (3D) 'object-centered' object representation, where the object's features and qualities are independent of any particular perspective.  Impairment at this stage would be consistent with apperceptive agnosia.<ref name="Bauer"/>  This fully formed percept then triggers activation of stored structural object knowledge for familiar things.<ref name="Charnallet"/>  This stage is referred to as "object recognition units" and distinctions between apperceptive and associative forms can be made based on presentation of a defect before or after this stage, respectively.<ref name="DeRenzi"/>  This is the level at which one is proposed to perceive familiarity toward an object, which activates the semantic memory system, containing meaning information for objects, as well as descriptive information about individual items and object classes. The semantic system can then trigger name retrieval for the objects.  A patient who is not impaired up until the level of naming, retaining access to meaning information, are distinguished from agnostics and labeled as anomic.<ref name="Bauer"/>

===Non-abstracted view===
In an alternate model of object recognition by Carbonnel et al.<ref name="Carbonnel">{{cite journal|last=Carbonnel|first=S.|coauthors=A. Charnallet, D. David, & J. Pellat|title=One or several semantic system(s): maybe none. Evidence from a case study of modality and category-specific "semantic" im- pairment|journal=Cortex|year=1997|volume=33 |issue=3|pages=391–417 |pmid=9339326 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref> [[episodic memory|episodic]] and semantic memory arise from the same memory traces, and no semantic representations are stored permanently in memory.  By this view, the meaning of any stimulus emerges momentarily from reactivation of one's previous experiences with that entity.  Each episode is made of several components of many different sensory modalities that are typically engaged during interactions with an object. In this scenario, a retrieval cue triggers reactivation of all episodic memory traces, in proportion to the similarity between the cue its 'echo,' the components shared by most activated traces.  In a process called 're-injection,' the first echo acts as a further retrieval cue, evoking the 'second echo,' the less frequently associated components of the cue.  Thus, the 're-injection' process provides a more complete meaning for the object.  According to this model, different types of stimuli will evoke differential 'echos' based on typical interactions with them.<ref name="Charnallet"/>  For example, a distinction is made between functional and visual components of various stimuli, such that impairment to these aspects of the memory trace will inhibit the re-injection process needed to complete the object representation.  This theory has been used to explain category-specific agnosias that impair recognition of various object types, such as animals and words, to different degrees.<ref name="Charnallet"/>

===Visual object agnosia===
Visual object agnosia (or semantic agnosia) is the most commonly encountered form of agnosia.<ref name="DeRenzi"/>  The clinical "definition" of the disorder is when an affected person is able to copy/draw things that they cannot recognize. Individuals afflicted with the associative type often cannot identify, describe or mimic functions of items, though perception is intact, since images of objects can be copied or drawn.<ref name="Biran, Coslett, 2003"/>  Individuals may retain semantic knowledge of the items, as exemplified during tasks where objects are presented through alternate modalities, through touch or verbal naming or description.  Some associative visual object agnostics retain the ability to categorize items by context or [[superordinate]], though unable to name or describe them.<ref name="DeRenzi"/>  Diffuse hypoxic damage is the most common cause of visual object agnosias.<ref name="Greene"/>

===Category-specific agnosia===
Category-specific agnosias are differential impairments in subject knowledge or recognition abilities pertaining to specific classes of stimuli, such as living things vs. non-living things, animate vs. inaminate things, food, metals, musical instruments, etc.  Some of the most common category-specific agnosias involve recognition impairments for living things, but not non-living things, or human faces, as in [[prosopagnosia]].  This type of deficit is typically associated with head injury or stroke, though other medical conditions have been implicated, such as, herpes encephalitis.<ref name="Agnosia"/>

===Prosopagnosia===
[[Prosopagnosia]] (or "face blindness") is a category-specific visual object agnosia, specifically, impairment in visual recognition of familiar faces, such as close friends, family, husbands, wives, and sometimes even their own faces.  Individuals are often able to identify others through alternate characteristics, such as, voice, [[gait]],  context or unique facial features.  This deficit is typically assessed through picture identification tasks of famous persons. This condition is associated with damage to the medial occipito-temporal [[gyrus|gyri]], including the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Lingual gyrus|lingual]] gryi, as the suggested location of the brain's face recognition units.<ref name="Biran, Coslett, 2003"/><ref name="Kiernan, 2005"/><ref name="DeRenzi"/>

====Associative and apperceptive forms====
Two subtypes are distinguished behaviorally as being associative or apperceptive in nature.  [[Prosopagnosia#Associative|Associative prosopagnosia]] is characterized by an impairment in recognition of a familiar face as familiar; however, individuals retain the ability to distinguish between faces based on general features, such as, age, gender and emotional expression.<ref name="Farah"/>  This subtype is distinguished through facial matching tasks or feature identification tasks of unknown faces.<ref name="DeRenzi"/>

===Pure alexia===
[[Pure alexia]] ("alexia without dysgraphia" or "pure word blindness") is a category-specific agnosia, characterized by a distinct impairment in reading words, despite intact comprehension for verbally presented words, demonstrating retained semantic knowledge of words.<ref name="Biran, Coslett, 2003"/><ref name="Farah"/>  Perceptual abilities are also intact, as assessed by word-copying tasks.<ref name="Agnosia"/>

===Cerebral achromatopsia===

[[File:Banana-fluorescence-081108.jpg|thumb|thumb|Color agnostics fail to identify abnormally colored objects or pictures|alt=Two adjacent photos of bananas. The left is in sunlight; the right is under ultraviolet light.]]

[[Cerebral achromatopsia]], also known as Color agnosia, is a category-specific semantic impairment pertaining to semantic color associations, such that individuals retain perceptual abilities for distinguishing color, demonstrated through color categorization or [[hue]] perception tasks; however knowledge of typical color-object relationships is defective.<ref name="Biran, Coslett, 2003"/><ref name="Greene"/><ref name="DeRenzi"/>  Color agnostics are assessed on performance coloring in black and white images of common items or identifying abnormally colored objects within a set of images.<ref name="Agnosia"/>  For example, a color agnostic may not identify a blue banana as being improperly colored.

====Overlap with color anomia====

This deficit should be distinguished from [[Anomic aphasia#Types of Anomic Aphasia|color anomia]], where semantic information about color is retained, but the name of a color cannot be retrieved, though co-occurrence is common.  Both disorders linked to damage in the occipito-temporal cortex, especially in the left hemisphere, which is believed to play a significant role in color memory.<ref name="DeRenzi"/>

==Assessment of associative agnosia==
A recognition disorder is not considered to be agnosia unless there is a lack of [[aphasia]], [[dementia]], or other generalized defect that affects any stage of the object recognition process, such as, deficiencies in intelligence, [[linguistic]] ability, memory, attention or sensory perception.<ref name="Bauer"/><ref name="Agnosia"/>  Therefore, individuals must be assessed for language ability, auditory comprehension, [[fluency]], repetition, [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], and reading and writing.

[[File:Flowchart for Assessment of Visual Agnosias.png|thumb|Flowchart for the assessment of visual agnosias|A Flowchart for Clinical Assessment of Forms of Visual Agnosia|alt=Flowchart for Assessment of Visual Agnosias.]]

===Goals of clinical assessment of agnosia===

# Ruling out alternative conditions leading to the recognition impairment, such as, primary sensory disruption, dementia, aphasia, [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]], or unfamiliarity with the object category or elements.
# Determination of the scope and specific nature of the recognition impairment. Including:
:*Specific sensory modality
:*Specific category of stimuli
:*Specific conditions under which recognition is possible<ref name="Bauer"/>

===Testing===

Specialists, like [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] or [[Audiology|audiologists]], can test for perceptual abilities.  Detailed testing is conducted, using specially formulated assessment materials, and referrals to [[Neurology|neurological]] specialists is recommended to support a diagnosis via [[neuroimaging|brain imaging]] or recording techniques.  The separate stages of information processing in the object recognition model are often used to localize the processing level of the deficit.<ref name="Bauer"/>

Testing usually consists of object identification and perception tasks including:
* object-naming tasks
* object categorization or figure matching
* drawing or copying real objects or images or illustrations
* unusual views tests
* overlapping line drawings
* partially degraded or fragmented image identification
* face or feature analysis
* fine line judgment
* figure contour tracking
* visual object description
* object-function miming
* tactile ability tests (naming by touch)
* auditory presentation identification<ref name="Carlesimo"/><ref name="Greene"/>

===Overlap with optic aphasia===
Sensory modality testing allows practitioners to assess for generalized versus specific deficits, distinguishing visual agnosias from [[Aphasia|optic aphasia]], which is a more generalized deficit in semantic knowledge for objects that spans multiple sensory modalities, indicating an impairment in the semantic representations themselves.<ref name="McCarthy, 1987"/>

===Apperceptive vs. associative===
The distinction between visual agnosias can be assessed based on the individual's ability to copy simple line drawings, figure contour tracking, and figure matching.<ref name="Carlesimo"/> Apperceptive visual agnostics fail at these tasks, while associative visual agnostics are able to perform normally, though their copying of images or words is often slavish, lacking originality or personal interpretation.<ref name="Bauer"/>

==Treatment==
The affected individual may not realize that they have a visual problem and may complain of becoming "clumsy" or "muddled" when performing familiar tasks such as setting the table or simple DIY.
[[Anosognosia]], a lack of awareness of the deficit, is common and can cause therapeutic resistance.<ref name="Agnosia"/>  In some agnosias, such as prosopagnosia, awareness of the deficit is often present; however shame and embarrassment regarding the symptoms can be a barrier in admission of a deficiency.<ref name="DeRenzi"/>  Because agnosias result from brain lesions, no direct treatment for them currently exists, and intervention is aimed at utilization of [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategies]] by patients and those around them.  Sensory compensation can also develop after one modality is impaired in agnostics<ref name="Bauer"/>

General principles of treatment:
* restitution
* repetitive training of impaired ability
* development of compensatory strategies utilizing retained cognitive functions<ref name="Bauer"/>

Partial remediation is more likely in cases with traumatic/[[vascular]] lesions, where more focal damage occurs, than in cases where the deficit arises out of anoxic brain damage, which typically results in more diffuse damage and multiple cognitive impairments.<ref name="Agnosia"/>  However, even with forms of compensation, some afflicted individuals may no longer be able to fulfill the requirements of their occupation or perform common tasks, such as, eating or navigating.  Agnostics are likely to become more dependent on others and to experience significant changes to their lifestyle, which can lead to [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or [[adjustment disorder]]s.<ref name="Bauer"/>
