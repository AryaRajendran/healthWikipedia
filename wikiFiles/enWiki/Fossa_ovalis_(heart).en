The '''fossa ovalis''' is a depression in the [[right atrium]] of the [[heart]], the remnant of a thin fibrous sheet that covered the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] during [[fetal]] development. 

During fetal development, the foramen ovale allows blood to pass from the right atrium to the [[left atrium]], bypassing the nonfunctional fetal lungs while the fetus obtains its oxygen from the [[placenta]]. A flap of tissue called the [[septum primum]] acts as a valve over the foramen ovale during that time. After birth, the introduction of air into the lungs causes the pressure in the [[Pulmonary circulation|pulmonary circulatory]] system to drop. This change in pressure pushes the septum primum against the [[atrial septum]], closing the foramen.<ref name="patent foramen ovale guide">{{cite journal|last=Hara|first=H|coauthors=Virmani, R; Ladich, E; Mackey-Bojack, S; Titus, J; Reisman, M; Gray, W; Nakamura, M; Mooney, M; Poulose, A; Schwartz, RS|title=Patent foramen ovale: current pathology, pathophysiology, and clinical status.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=2005 Nov 1|volume=46|issue=9|pages=1768–76|pmid=16256883|accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref> The septum primum and atrial septum eventually fuse together to form a complete seal, leaving a depression called the fossa ovalis. By age two, about 75% of people have a completely sealed fossa ovalis. An unfused fossa ovalis is called a [[patent foramen ovale]]. Depending on the circumstances, a patent foramen ovale may be completely asymptomatic, or may require surgery.<ref name="patent foramen ovale guide" />

==Formation==
Almost immediately after the infant is born, the foramen ovale and [[ductus arteriosus]] close. The major changes that are made by the body occur at the first breath (in the case of heart and lung functions) and up to weeks after birth (such as the liver's [[protein synthesis|enzyme synthesis]]). The foramen ovale becomes the fossa ovalis as the foramen closes.<ref name="What is the Fossa Ovalis?">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Donna|title=What is the Fossa Ovalis?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-fossa-ovalis.htm|accessdate=16 March 2012|publisher=Conjecture Corporation}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=May 2012}}</ref> This enables respiration and circulation independent from the mother's.

With the child's first breath, the lung sends [[oxygenated blood]] to the left atrium. As a resulting pressure in the left atrium is higher than that of the right, and the increased pressure holds the interatrial flap (which covers the foramen ovale) shut, therefore closing the foramen ovale as well.<ref name="What is the Fossa Ovalis?"/> In normal development, the closed foramen ovale fuses with the interatrial wall. During the first breath, vasoconstriction causes the ductus arterious to close, and during adult years, tissue occludes what once was the ductus arterious, creating the [[ligamentum arteriosum]].<ref name="Respiratory System">{{cite web|author=Dryden, Richard|title=Respiratory system|url=http://www.bionalogy.com/respiratory_system.htm|accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref>

==Complications==
===Tricuspid valve stenosis===
When the foramen does not close, blood can travel between the left and right atria, mixing oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The foramen ovale usually shuts by age one.<ref>{{cite web|first=Barry A.|last=Love|title=Pediatric Patent Foramen Ovale Atrial Septal Defects|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/894483-overview|date=2 November 2, 2010|publisher=WebMD|work=Medscape Reference}}</ref> Several problems can occur if the hole is left open. The right atrium may develop higher than normal pressure, which interferes with the blood's passage through the [[tricuspid valve]], resulting in [[tricuspid valve stenosis]]. Tricuspid valve stenosis does not usually require treatment, though if the heart valves begin to malfunction, surgery may be needed.

===Aneurysm===
[[Aneurysms]] can occur in adulthood if the foramen ovale does not closed correctly. An aneurysm happens when an artery becomes enlarged in a localized area due to weakening of the arterial wall.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shirani|first1=J.|last2=Zafari|first2=A.M.|last3=Roberts|first3=W.C.|title=Morphologic features of fossa ovalis membrane aneurysm in the adult and its clinical significance.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=1995 Aug|volume=26|issue=2|pages=466–71|pmid=7608452}}</ref>

When this type of aneurysm occurs in the area of the fossa ovalis, an enlarged pouch is formed. This pouch can protrude into the right atrium or the left atrium. The cause of this aneurysm is the result of abnormal, increased pressure within the heart. Even if the foramen ovale does seal shut, an aneurysm may occur, usually on the side of the right atrium. If the aneurysm stretches too far, it can narrow the opening of the [[inferior vena cava]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Topaz|first1=O.|last2=Edwards|first2=J.E.|last3=Bojack-Mackey|first3=S|last4=Titus|first4=J.L.|title=Aneurysm of fossa ovalis in adults: a pathologic study|journal=Cardiovascular pathology: the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology|date=2003 Jul-Aug|volume=12|issue=4|pages=219–25|pmid=12826292}}</ref> This type of aneurysm can be a result of [[atheroma|plaque]] build-up in the arteries from [[coronary heart disease]], as well as diseases of the [[aortic valve]] or [[mitral valve]]. Surgery may be useful in helping to cope with the aneurysm.

===Patent foramen ovale===
{{main|Patent foramen ovale}}
If the atrial septum does not close properly, it leads to a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This type of defect generally works like a flap valve, opening during certain conditions of increased pressure in the chest, such as during strain while having a bowel movement, cough, or sneeze. With enough pressure, blood may travel from the right atrium to the left. If there is a [[blood clot|clot]] in the right side of the heart, it can cross the PFO, enter the left atrium, and travel out of the heart and to the brain, causing a [[stroke]]. If the clot travels into a [[coronary artery]] it can cause a [[heart attack]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Patent Foramen Ovale|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/disorders/congenital/pfo.aspx|accessdate=15 April 15, 2012|publisher=The Cleveland Clinic}}</ref>
