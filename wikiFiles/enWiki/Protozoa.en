'''Protozoa''' are a diverse group of [[unicellular organism|unicellular]] [[eukaryotic]] organisms,<ref name="AlcamoWarner2009">{{cite book|author1=I. Edward Alcamo|author2=Jennifer M. Warner|title=Schaum's Outline of Microbiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nzvthLbcH6EC&pg=PA144|accessdate=14 November 2010|date=28 August 2009|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-162326-1|pages=144–}}</ref> many of which are [[Motility|motile]]. Originally, '''protozoa''' had been defined as unicellular [[protist]]s with [[animal]]-like behavior, e.g., [[:wikt:movement|movement]]. Protozoa were regarded as the partner group of protists to [[protophyta]], which have plant-like behaviour, e.g., [[photosynthesis]].

==Terminology==
Following the Greek root of the name, the singular form is ''protozoon'' {{IPA-en|proʊtəˈzoʊ.ɒn|}}(protos=first, zoon=animal). Its use has, however, partially been replaced by the word ''protozoan'', which was originally only used as an adjective. In the same manner the plural form ''protozoans'' is sometimes being used instead of ''protozoa''.

In general, protozoa are referred to as animal-like [[protist]]s because of movement (motility). However, both protozoa and [[protist]]s are [[paraphyletic]] groups (not including all genetic relatives of the group). For example, ''[[Entamoeba]]'' is more closely related to humans than to ''[[Euglena]]''. "Protozoa" is considered an outdated classification in more formal contexts. However, the term is still used in children's education.<ref name="Gunter2008">{{cite book|author=Michelle Gunter|title=Passing the North Carolina 8th Grade End of Grade Test of Science|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pfUqvi1AJmMC&pg=PA196|accessdate=14 November 2010|date=1 January 2008|publisher=American Book Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59807-186-3|pages=196–}}</ref>

While there is no exact definition for the term ''protozoa'', it is often referred to as a unicellular [[heterotroph]]ic [[protist]], such as the [[amoeboid|amoeba]] and [[ciliate]]s. The term ''[[algae]]'' is used for microorganisms that photosynthesize. However, distinction between protozoa and algae is often vague. For example, the alga ''[[Dinobryon]]'' has [[chloroplast]]s for [[photosynthesis]], but it can also feed on organic matter and is [[Motility|motile]].

Protozoa is sometimes considered a [[subkingdom]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000087548|Protozoa}}</ref> It was traditionally considered a [[phylum]] under [[Animalia]]<ref name="R.L.Kotpal">{{cite book|author=Prof. R.L.Kotpal|title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Invertebrates|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o7x7Zztp-5AC&pg=PA151|accessdate=14 November 2010|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=978-81-7133-903-7|pages=151–}}</ref> referring to unicellular animals, with [[Eumetazoa|Metazoa]] referring to multicellular animals.

==Characteristics==
Protozoa commonly range from 10 to 52 [[micrometers]], but can grow as large as 1 mm, and are seen easily by [[microscope]]. The largest protozoa known are the deep-sea dwelling [[xenophyophores]], which can grow up to 20 cm in diameter. They were considered formerly to be part of the [[protist]]a family. Protozoa exist throughout [[aqueous]] environments and [[soil]], occupying a range of [[trophic level]]s.
===Motility and digestion===
Tulodens are 2 of the slow-moving form of protozoa{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. They move around with whip-like tails called [[flagella]], hair-like structures called [[cilia]], or foot-like structures called [[pseudopod]]ia. Others do not move at all. Protozoa may absorb food via their [[cell membrane]]s, some, e.g., [[amoebas]], surround food and engulf it, and yet others have openings or "mouth pores" into which they sweep food,and that engulfing of food is said to be phagocytosis. All protozoa digest their food in stomach-like compartments called [[vacuoles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microbeworld.org/microbes/protista/protozoa.aspx|title=Protozoa|year=2006|work=MicrobeWorld|publisher=American Society for Chemistry|accessdate=15 June 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080519091815/http://www.microbeworld.org/microbes/protista/protozoa.aspx |archivedate = 19 May 008}}</ref>

===Pellicle===
The pellicle is a thin layer supporting the [[cell membrane]] in various protozoa, protecting them and allowing them to retain their shape, especially during locomotion, allowing the organism to be more [[hydrodynamic]]. They vary from flexible and elastic to rigid. Although somewhat stiff, the pellicle is also flexible and allows the [[protist]] to fit into tighter spaces. In [[ciliate]]s and [[Apicomplexa]], it is formed from closely packed vesicles called [[alveoli]]. In [[euglenid]]s, it is formed from [[protein]] strips arranged spirally along the length of the body. Examples of protists with a pellicle are the [[euglenoids]] and the [[paramecium]], a ciliate. The pellicle consists of many bacteria that adhere to the surface by their attachment [[Pilus|pili]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. Thus, attachment pili allow the organisms to remain in the broth, from which they take nutrients, while they congregate near air, where the oxygen concentration is greatest.
===Ecological role===
As components of the [[Fauna (animals)#Microfauna|micro-]] and [[Fauna (animals)#Meiofauna|meiofauna]], protozoa are an important food source for [[microinvertebrate]]s. Thus, the ecological role of protozoa in the transfer of bacterial and algal production to successive trophic levels is important. As predators, they prey upon [[unicellular]] or [[filamentous algae]], [[bacteria]], and [[microfungi]]. Protozoa are both [[herbivore]]s and [[Heterotroph|consumer]]s in the decomposer link of the [[food chain]]. They also control bacteria populations and [[biomass]] to some extent. Protozoa such as the [[malaria]] parasites (''[[Plasmodium]]'' spp.), [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]]s and [[leishmania]], are also important disease causing agents in humans.

===Life cycle===
Some protozoa have life stages alternating between proliferative stages (e.g., [[trophozoite]]s) and dormant [[Microbial cyst|cyst]]s. As cysts, protozoa can survive harsh conditions, such as exposure to extreme temperatures or harmful chemicals, or long periods without access to nutrients, water, or oxygen for a period of time. Being a cyst enables parasitic species to survive outside of a host, and allows their transmission from one host to another. When protozoa are in the form of [[trophozoite]]s (Greek, ''tropho'' = to nourish), they actively feed. The conversion of a trophozoite to cyst form is known as encystation, while the process of transforming back into a trophozoite is known as excystation. Protozoa can reproduce by [[binary fission]] or multiple fission. Some protozoa reproduce sexually, some asexually, while some use a combination, (e.g., [[Coccidia]]). An individual protozoan is hermaphroditic.

==Classification==
Protozoa were previously often grouped in the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] of [[Protista]], together with the [[plant]]-like [[alga]]e and [[fungus]]-like [[Oomycete|slime mold]]s. As a result of 21st-century [[systematics]], protozoa, along with [[ciliates]], [[mastigophora]]ns, and [[apicomplexa]]ns, are arranged as animal-like [[protists]]. With the possible exception of [[Myxozoa]], protozoa are not categorized as [[Metazoa]].<ref>Smothers et al, ''Science'', 16 September 1994, "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/265/5179/1719 Molecular evidence that the myxozoan protists are metazoans]", 8 June 2010</ref> Protozoa are unicellular organisms and are often called the animal-like protists because they subsist entirely on other organisms for food. Most protozoa can move about on their own. [[Amoebas]], [[paramecia]], and [[trypanosomes]] are all examples of animal-like protists.

===Sub-groups===
The classification of protozoa has been and remains a problematic area of taxonomy. Where they are available, DNA sequences are used as the basis for classification but for the majority of described protozoa such material is not available. They have been and still are mostly on the basis of their morphology and for the parasitic species their hosts. Protozoa have been divided traditionally{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} on the basis of their means of locomotion.
* [[Flagellate]]s (e.g., ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'')
* [[Amoeboid]]s (e.g., ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'')
* [[Sporozoans]] (e.g., ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi]]'')
**[[Apicomplexa]]
**[[Myxozoa]]
**[[Microsporidia]]
* [[Ciliate]]s (e.g., ''[[Balantidium coli]]'')
As a phylum the Protozoa had been divided into four subphyla<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 7–20| last = Honigberg| first = B. M.| coauthors = W. Balamuth, E. C. Bovee, J. O.

*Subphylum [[Sarcomastigophora]]
**Superclass [[Mastigophora]] (includes flagellates)
**Superclass [[Sarcodina]]
**Superclass [[Opalinata]]
*Subphylum [[Sporozoa]] (includes apicomplexans)
*Subphylum [[Cnidospora]]
**Class [[Myxosporidea]]
**Class [[Microsporidea]]
*Subphylum [[Ciliophora]] (includes ciliates)
These systems are no longer considered to be valid.
