The '''Migraine Aura Foundation''' ('''MAF''') is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Germany]]. MAF runs a website<ref>{{official website|http://www.migraine-aura.org|Migraine Aura Foundation}}</ref> providing access to medical information and material that helps [[migraine]] patients to recognize and understand their [[Neurological disorder|neurological symptoms]] during migraine, and thus to assume greater responsibility for their [[healthcare]].

== History ==

In 2000,  the German national daily newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' published an article about the work of the theoretical physicist Markus Dahlem on the emergence of [[visual hallucinations]] during migraine.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article526821/Wie_im_Gehirn_Geisterbilder_entstehen.html/ |title=Wie im Gehirn Geisterbilder entstehen |work=[[Die Welt]] |date=07.08.00 |language=German}}</ref> In the following days and weeks, the scientist received numerous letters asking for more information and many  people were  willing to provide additional information on their migraine symptoms. 

The obvious need for a wider public understanding of these visual hallucinations and further peculiar neurological symptoms suggested that a website devoted exclusively to [[migraine with aura]] would have a strong impact. It went online in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://neuro2.med.uni-magdeburg.de/~dahlem/e18/e86/index_en.html |title=My Motivation |work=neuro2.med.uni-magdeburg.de |publisher=[[University of Magdeburg]]}}</ref> This website was until 2004 available only in German. In 2004, the physician Klaus Podoll, an expert in migraine art,<ref>{{cite book |title=Migraine Art: The Migraine Experience from Within |publisher=[[North Atlantic Books]] |isbn=1-55643-672-6}}</ref> joined the project. The content presented on the website increased dramatically in the years 2004-2005.

From 2004 on, it was published in a German and English version. In 2005, the website was nominated for the Media Art Award,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medienkunstpreis.de/page_englisch.php?link=30 |title=Media Art Award 2005 - The top fifty}}</ref> an international competition jointly organized by [[SÃ¼dwestrundfunk]] (South West German Broadcasting Corporation) and others. At the same time, due to the vast increase in  content, the website could no longer be provided in two languages. Today, information on the website is available only in English. It provides the largest source available to the public on migraine with aura.
