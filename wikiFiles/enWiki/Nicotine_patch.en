A '''nicotine patch''' is a [[transdermal patch]] that releases [[nicotine]] into the body through the skin.  It is used as an aid in [[nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT), a process for [[smoking cessation]]. The first study of the pharmacokinetics of a transdermal nicotine patch in humans was published in 1984<ref>{{cite pmid | 6734425 }}</ref> by Jed E. Rose, Ph.D., Murray E. Jarvik, M.D., Ph.D. and K. Daniel Rose, and was followed by publication by Rose et al. (1985) of results of a study of smokers showing that a transdermal nicotine patch reduced craving for cigarettes.<ref>{{cite pmid | 4042528 }}</ref>  Frank Etscorn filed a patent in the [[United States]] on January the 23rd 1985 and was issued the patent on July 1, 1986.<ref>{{ cite patent

==Issues==

===Efficacy===
Dozens of clinical trials have shown that the patch approximately doubles success rates over placebo treatment. Placebo tests show a 5.9% success rate, in comparison to the 7.2% blind active tests, and the 10.8% open tests.<ref>http://healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu/health-patch.htm</ref><ref>Fiore MC, Ja√©n CR, Baker TB, et al.

==Alternate uses==
Nicotine patches are under study to help relieve the symptoms of [[post-surgical pain]].<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/85508.php Nicotine Patch Decreases Post Surgical Pain]</ref>

Studies are being conducted about the use of transdermal nicotine patches to treat anxiety, depression, and inattentiveness in subjects with [[ADHD]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446482/ Transdermal Nicotine in Adult ADHD With Depression and Anxiety ]</ref>
