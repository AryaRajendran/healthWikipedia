{{Violence against women}}
'''Forced pregnancy''' is the practice of forcing a woman to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], or as part of a programme of breeding [[slave]]s, or as part of a programme of [[genocide]].

== Bride kidnapping ==
{{main|Bride kidnapping|Forced marriage}}
The practices of [[bride kidnapping]] and [[forced marriage]] typically (with the exception of purely symbolic "bride kidnappings" which are actually consensual [[elopement]]s) involve the rape of the "bride" with the intention of forcing her to become pregnant, and thus in a position where she becomes dependent on her rapist and his family and, because of cultural attitudes to rape, unable to return to her own family.

== Slave breeding in the United States ==
{{main|Slave breeding in the United States}}

During the period of [[slavery in the United States]], many slave owners attempted to influence the reproduction of slaves in order to increase the wealth of slaveholders.<ref>Marable, Manning, ''How capitalism underdeveloped Black America: problems in race, political economy, and society'' South End Press, 2000, p 72</ref>

Slave breeding included coerced sexual relations between male and female slaves, promoting pregnancies of slaves, sexual relations between master and slave with the aim of producing slave children, and favoring female slaves who produced a relatively large number of children.<ref>Marable, ibid, p 72</ref>

The purpose of slave breeding was to produce new slaves without incurring the cost of purchase, to fill labor shortages caused by the termination of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and to attempt to improve the health and productivity of slaves. Slave breeding was condoned in the South because slaves were considered to be subhuman chattels, and were not entitled to the same rights accorded to free persons.

Rape, sexual slavery, and related actions including forced pregnancy and sexual slavery, are now recognized under the Geneva Convention as [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s;<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/877066/Geneva-Conventions-as-discussed-in-rape-crime |title=Geneva Conventions as Discussed in Rape Crime |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref> in particular from 1949, Article 27 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], and later also the 1977 Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, explicitly prohibit wartime rape and enforced prostitution. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognises rape, [[sexual slavery]], [[forced prostitution]], and forced pregnancy among others, as [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if part of a widespread or systematic practice.<ref name="Horton">As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive â€“ A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation.

{{main|Rwandan Genocide}}
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] identified rape as capable of amounting to [[genocide]] when used systematically or on a mass scale to destroy a people; later the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] also categorized rape as capable of being a [[crime against humanity]]. In 2008 the [[U.N. Security Council]]'s [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]] identified such acts as capable of being "war crimes, crimes against humanity or ... genocide".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm |title=Security Council Demands Immediate and Complete Halt to Acts of Sexual Violence Against Civilians in Conflict Zones, Unanimously Adopting Resolution 1820 (2008) |publisher=UN.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref> Despite these measures, rape, whether systematic or otherwise, remains widespread in conflict zones.
