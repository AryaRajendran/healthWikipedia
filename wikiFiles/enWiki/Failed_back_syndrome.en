'''Failed back syndrome''' or '''post-[[laminectomy]] syndrome''' is a condition characterized by persistent [[Pain and nociception|pain]] following [[laminectomy|back surgeries]].

Failed back syndrome (FBS), also called "failed back surgery syndrome" (FBSS), refers to chronic back and/or leg pain that occurs after back (spinal) surgery,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Long DM |title=Failed back surgery syndrome |journal=Neurosurg Clin N Am. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=899–919 |year=1991 |month=Oct |pmid=1840393 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fritsch EW, Heisel J, Rupp S |title=The failed back surgery syndrome: reasons, intraoperative findings, and long-term results: a report of 182 operative treatments |journal=Spine |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=626–33 |year=1996 |month=Mar |pmid=8852320 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0362-2436&volume=21&issue=5&spage=626 |doi=10.1097/00007632-199603010-00017}}</ref> usually after [[laminectomy]].<ref>Conditions of the Spine - Post Laminectomy Syndrome. (2010). Retrieved January 16, 2013 from http://www.njpcc.com/conditions-of-the-spine/post-laminectomy-syndrome.html</ref>   It is characterized as a [[chronic pain]] syndrome.  Multiple factors can contribute to the onset or development of FBS. Contributing factors include but are not limited to residual or recurrent disc herniation, persistent post-operative pressure on a spinal nerve, altered joint mobility, [[hypermobility|joint hypermobility]] with instability, scar tissue ([[fibrosis]]), [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[sleeplessness]] and spinal muscular [[deconditioning]].  An individual may be predisposed to the development of FBS due to systemic disorders such as [[diabetes]], [[autoimmune disease]] and [[peripheral vascular disease|peripheral blood vessels (vascular) disease]]. 

Common symptoms associated with FBS include diffuse, dull and aching pain involving the back and/or legs. Abnormal sensibility may include sharp, pricking, and stabbing pain in the extremities. The term "post-laminectomy syndrome" is used by some doctors to indicate the same condition as failed back syndrome.  

The treatments of post-laminectomy syndrome include physical therapy, minor nerve blocks, [[TENS|transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] (TENS), [[behavioral medicine]], [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|non-steroidal anti-inflammatory]] (NSAID) medications, membrane stabilizers, [[antidepressants]], [[spinal cord stimulation]], and intrathecal morphine pump. Use of epidural steroid injections may be minimally helpful in some cases.  The targeted anatomic use of a potent anti-inflammatory anti-TNF therapeutics is being investigated.

The number of spinal surgeries varies around the world.  The United States and Holland report the highest number of spinal surgeries, while the United Kingdom and Sweden report the fewest.  Recently, there have been calls for more aggressive surgical treatment in Europe (see infra).  Success rates of spinal surgery vary for many reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Slipman CW, Shin CH, Patel RK, ''et al.'' |title=Etiologies of failed back surgery syndrome |journal=Pain Med |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=200–14; discussion 214–7 |year=2002 |month=Sep |pmid=15099254 |doi=10.1046/j.1526-4637.2002.02033.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Taylor VM, Deyo RA, Cherkin DC, Kreuter W |title=Low back pain hospitalization.

Patients who have undergone one or more operations on the lumbar spine, and continue to experience and report pain afterward can be divided into two groups. The first group are those in whom surgery was never indicated, or the surgery performed was never likely to achieve the desired result; and those in whom the surgery was indicated, but which technically did not achieve the intended result.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00007632-198001000-00015 | author = Fager C.

The second group includes patients who had incomplete or inadequate operations.  Lumbar [[spinal stenosis]] may be overlooked, especially when it is associated with disc protrusion or herniation.  Removal of a disc, while not addressing the underlying presence of stenosis can lead to disappointing results.<ref name="pmid7249453">{{cite journal |author=Burton CV, Kirkaldy-Willis WH, Yong-Hing K, Heithoff KB |title=Causes of failure of surgery on the lumbar spine |journal=Clin.

In the past two decades there has been a dramatic increase in fusion surgery in the U.S.: in 2001 over 122,000 lumbar fusions were performed, a 22% increase from 1990 in fusions per 100,000 population, increasing to an estimate of 250,000 in 2003, and 500,000 in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deyo RA, Gray DT, Kreuter W, Mirza S, Martin BI |title=United States trends in lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative conditions |journal=Spine |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=1441–5; discussion 1446–7 |year=2005 |month=Jun |pmid=15959375 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0362-2436&volume=30&issue=12&spage=1441 |doi=10.1097/01.brs.0000166503.37969.8a}}</ref><ref name=ease>{{cite news | author=Abelson R, Petersen M | title=An operation to ease back pain bolsters the bottom line, too |work= New York Times |date=  December 31, 2003 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/31/business/an-operation-to-ease-back-pain-bolsters-the-bottom-line-too.html | accessdate=January 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=invest>{{cite news | author=Abelson R | title=Surgeons invest in makers of hardware | work=  New York Times |date= December 30, 2006 | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFDD1630F933A05751C1A9609C8B63 | accessdate=January 8, 2011 }}</ref> In 2003, the national bill for the hardware for fusion alone was estimated to have soared to $2.5 billion a year.<ref name=ease/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Guyer RD, Patterson M, Ohnmeiss DD |title=Failed back surgery syndrome: diagnostic evaluation |journal=J Am Acad Orthop Surg |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=534–43 |year=2006 |month=Sep |pmid=16959891 |url=http://www.jaaos.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16959891}}</ref>
For patients with continued pain after surgery which is not due to the above complications or conditions, interventional pain physicians speak of the need to identify the "pain generator" i.e. the anatomical structure responsible for the patient's pain. To be effective, the surgeon must operate on the correct anatomic structure; however it is often not possible to determine the source of the pain.<ref name="diagnosis"/><ref name=persistent/> The reason for this is that many patients with [[chronic pain]] often have disc bulges at multiple spinal levels and the physical examination and imaging studies are unable to pinpoint the source of pain.<ref name=diagnosis/> In addition, [[spinal fusion]] itself, particularly if more than one spinal level is operated on, may result in "adjacent segment degeneration".<ref name=levin>{{cite journal |author=Levin DA, Hale JJ, Bendo JA |title=Adjacent segment degeneration following spinal fusion for degenerative disc disease |journal=Bull NYU Hosp Jt Dis |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=29–36 |year=2007 |pmid=17539759 |url=http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=e6fb30e7-8841-4258-be97-610c1d8e7b9c}}</ref>  This is thought to occur because the fused segments may result in increased torsional and stress forces being transmitted to the [[intervertebral discs]] located above and below the fused vertebrae.<ref name=levin/> This pathology is one reason behind the development of artificial discs as a possible alternative to fusion surgery.  But fusion surgeons argue that [[spinal fusion]] is more time-tested, and artificial discs contain metal hardware that is unlikely to last as long as biological material without shattering and leaving metal fragments in the spinal canal. These represent different [[schools of thought]]. (See discussion on disc replacement infra.)

Another highly relevant consideration is the increasing recognition of the importance of "chemical radiculitis" in the generation of [[back pain]].<ref name=chemical>{{cite journal |author=Peng B, Wu W, Li Z, Guo J, Wang X |title=Chemical radiculitis |journal=Pain |volume=127 |issue=1–2 |pages=11–6 |year=2007 |month=Jan |pmid=16963186 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2006.06.034 }}</ref>  A primary focus of surgery is to remove "pressure" or reduce mechanical compression on a neural element: either the [[spinal cord]], or a [[nerve root]].

Recent studies have shown that cigarette smokers will routinely fail all spinal surgery, if the goal of that surgery is the decrease of pain and impairment.  Many surgeons consider smoking to be an absolute [[contraindication]] to spinal surgery.  Nicotine appears to interfere with bone metabolism through induced [[calcitonin]] resistance and decreased osteoblastic function.  It may also restrict small blood vessel diameter leading to increased scar formation.<ref>{{cite journal | title =  Risk factors in low-back pain. An epidemiological survey| author = Frymoyer J. W.

In a massive study of 3482 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery from the National Spine Network, comorbidities of (1) smoking, (2) compensation, (3) self reported poor overall health and (4) pre-existing  psychological factors were predictive in a high risk of failure.  Followup was carried out at 3 months and one year after surgery.  Pre-operative depressive disorders tended not to do well.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.brs.0000229252.30903.b9 | author = Slover J.

Smoking has been shown to increase the incidence of post operative infection as well as decrease fusion rates.

==Pathology ==
Before the advent of CT scanning, the pathology in failed back syndrome was difficult to understand. [[Computerized tomography]] in conjunction with metrizamide myelography in the late 1960s and 1970s allowed direct observation of the mechanisms involved in post operative failures.  Six distinct pathologic conditions were identified: 

* Recurrent or persistent disc herniation
* Spinal stenosis
* Post operative infection
* Epidural post-operative fibrosis
* Adhesive arachnoiditis
* Nerve Injury

===Recurrent or persistent disc herniation ===
[[File:CT LUMBAR DISC HERNATION.JPG|left|thumb|CT scan image of large herniated disc in the lumbar spine.]]

Removal of a disc at one level can lead to disc herniation at the same level or a different level at a later time.  Even the most complete surgical excision of the disc still leaves 30-40% of the disc, which cannot be safely removed.  This retained disc can re-herniate sometime after surgery. Virtually every major structure in the abdomen and posterior retroperitoneal space has been injured removing discs from  posterior laminetomy/discectomy surgical procedures.  The most prominent of these is a laceration of the left internal iliac vein which lies in close proximity to the anterior portion of the disc.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archsurg.1945.01230030009002 | author = Linton R.

Even though the complications of laminectomy for disc herniation can be significant, a recent series of studies involving thousands of patients published under auspices of [[Dartmouth Medical School]] concluded at four-year follow-up that those who underwent surgery for a lumbar disc herniation achieved greater improvement than nonoperatively treated patients in all primary and secondary outcomes except work status.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/BRS.0b013e31818ed8f4 | author = Weinstein J.

===Spinal stenosis ===
[[File:LAMINECTOMY SCAR.JPG|right|thumb|CT scan of laminectomy showing scar formation (highlighted in red)causing new stenosis.]]

[[Spinal stenosis]] can be a late complication after laminectomy for disc herniation or when surgery was performed for the primary pathologic condition of spinal stenosis.<ref name="pmid7249453" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Crock H.

In the Maine Study, among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis completing 8- to 10-year follow-up, low back pain relief, predominant symptom improvement, and satisfaction with the current state were similar in patients initially treated surgically or nonsurgically. However, leg pain relief and greater back-related functional status continued to favor those initially receiving surgical treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.brs.0000158878.93445.a0 | author = Atlas S.

A large study of spinal stenosis from Finland found the prognostic factors for ability to work after surgery were ability to work before surgery, age under 50 years, and no prior back surgery. The very long-term outcome (mean followup time of 12.4 years) was excellent-to-good in 68% of patients (59% women and 73% men). Furthermore, in the longitudinal follow-up, the result improved between 1985  and 1991. No special complications were manifested during this very long-term follow-up time. The patients with total or subtotal block in preoperative myelography achieved the best result.  Furthermore, patients with block stenosis improved their result significantly in the longitudinal follow-up. The postoperative stenosis seen in computed tomography (CT) scans was observed in 65% of 90 patients, and it was severe in 23 patients (25%). However, this successful or unsuccessful surgical decompression did not correlate with patients' subjective disability, walking capacity or severity of pain. Previous back surgery had a strong worsening effect on surgical results. This effect was very clear in patients with total block in the preoperative myelography. The surgical result of a patient with previous back surgery was similar to that of a patient without previous back surgery when the time interval between the last two operations was more than 18 months.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Herno A |title=Surgical results of lumbar spinal stenosis |journal=Ann Chir Gynaecol Suppl |volume=210 |issue= |pages=1–969 |year=1995 |pmid=8546434 |doi= |url=}}</ref> 

Post-operative MRI findings of stenosis are probably of limited value compared to symptoms experienced by patients.   Patients' perception of improvement had a much stronger correlation with long-term surgical outcome than structural findings seen on postoperation magnetic resonance imaging. Degenerative findings had a greater effect on patients' walking capacity than stenotic findings <ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00007632-199908010-00006 | author = Herno A.

Postoperative radiologic stenosis was very common in patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis, but this did not correlate with clinical outcome. The clinician must be cautious when reconciling clinical symptoms and signs with postoperative computed tomography findings in patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00007632-199911010-00011 | author = Herno A.

A study from Georgetown University reported on one-hundred patients who had undergone decompressive surgery for lumbar stenosis between 1980 and 1985.  Four patients with postfusion stenosis were included. A 5-year follow-up period was achieved in 88 patients. The mean age was 67 years, and 80% were over 60 years of age. There was a high incidence of coexisting medical diseases, but the principal disability was lumbar stenosis with neurological involvement.  Initially there was a high incidence of success, but recurrence of neurological involvement and persistence of low-back pain led to an increasing number of failures. By 5 years this number had reached 27% of the available population pool, suggesting that the failure rate could reach 50% within the projected life expectancies of most patients. Of the 26 failures, 16 were secondary to renewed neurological involvement, which occurred at new levels of stenosis in eight and recurrence of stenosis at operative levels in eight. Reoperation was successful in 12 of these 16 patients, but two required a third operation. The incidence of [[spondylolisthesis]] at 5 years was higher in the surgical failures (12 of 26 patients) than in the surgical successes (16 of 64). Spondylolisthetic stenosis tended to recur within a few years following decompression.  Because of age and associated illnesses, fusion may be difficult to achieve in this group.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.3171/jns.1992.77.5.0669 | author = Caputy A. J., Luessenhop A.

===Post operative infection ===

A small minority of lumbar surgical patients will develop a post operative infection. In most cases, this is a bad complication and does not bode well for eventual improvement or future employability.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis (giving antibiotics during or after surgery before an infection begins) reduces the rate of surgical site infection in lumbar spine surgery, but a great deal of variation exists regarding its use.  In a Japanese study, utilizing the [[Centers for Disease Control]] recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis, an overall rate of 0.7% infection was noted, with a single dose antibiotic group having 0.4% infection rate and multiple dosage antibiotic infection rate of 0.8%.  The authors had previously used prophylactic antibiotics for 5 to 7 postoperative days. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  guideline, their antibiotic prophylaxis was changed to the day of surgery only. It was concluded there was no statistical difference in the rate of infection between the two different antibiotic protocols. Based on the CDC guideline, a single dose of prophylactic antibiotic was proven to be efficacious for the prevention of infection in lumbar spine surgeries.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.3171/spi.2007.6.4.7 | author = Kanayama M.

===Epidural post-operative fibrosis ===

Epidural scarring following a laminectomy for disc excision is a common feature when re-operating for recurrent sciatica or radiculopathy.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> When the scarring is associated with a disc herniation and/or recurrent spinal stenosis, it is relatively common, occurring in more than 60% of cases.  For a time, it was theorized that placing a fat graft over the dural could prevent post operative scarring.  However, initial enthusiasm has waned in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Langenskold A., Valle M. | year = 1976 | title = Prevention of epidural scar formation after operations on the lumbar spine by means of free fat transplants.

===Adhesive arachnoiditis ===

[[File:ARACHNOIDITIS.JPG|right|thumb|Myelogram showing typical findings of arachnoiditis in the lumbar spine.]]

Fibrous scarring can also be a complication within the subarachnoid space.  It is notoriously difficult to detect and evaluate.  Prior to the development of [[magnetic resonance imaging]], the only way to ascertain the presence of arachnoiditis was by opening the dura.   In the days of [[Computed tomography|CT]] scanning and [[Pantopaque]] and later, [[Metrizamide]] myelography, the presence of arachnoiditis could be speculated based on radiographic findings.  Often, myelography prior to the introduction of Metrizamide was the cause of arachnoiditis.   It can also be caused by the long term pressure brought about with either a disc herniation or spinal stenosis.<ref name="Benner B., Ehni G. 1978 40–44"/><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00007632-198009000-00007 | author = Benoit M.

Arachnoiditis is a broad term denoting inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space. A variety of etiologies exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes.
Infectious etiologies include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of intrathecal (inside the dural canal) agents such as myelographic contrast media, anesthetics (e.g. [[chloroprocaine]]), and steroids.
Neoplasia includes the hematogenous spread of systemic tumors, such as breast and lung carcinoma, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Neoplasia also includes direct seeding of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors such as [[glioblastoma multiforme]], [[medulloblastoma]], [[ependymoma]], and [[choroid plexus carcinoma]].    Strictly speaking, the most common cause of arachnoiditis in failed back syndrome is not infectious or from cancer.  It is due to non-specific scarring secondary to the surgery or the underlying pathology.

===Nerve injury ===

Laceration of a nerve root, or damage from cautery or traction can lead to chronic pain, however this can be difficult to determine. Chronic compression of the nerve root by a persistent agent such as disc, bone (osteophyte) or scarring can also permanently damage the nerve root.  Epidural scarring caused by the initial pathology or occurring after the surgery can also contribute to nerve damage.  In one study of failed back patients, the presence of pathology was noted to be at the same site as the level of  surgery performed in 57% of cases.  The remaining cases developed pathology at a different level, or on the opposite side, but at the same level as the surgery was performed.   In theory, all failed back patients have some sort of nerve injury or damage which leads to a persistence of symptoms after a reasonable healing time.<ref name="pmid152469" /><ref name="pmid7455766">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00007632-198007000-00010 | author = Weir B.K.A., Jacobs G.

==Management==

===Narcotics ===
Failed back syndrome (FBS) is a well-recognized complication of surgery of the lumbar spine. It can result in chronic pain and disability, often with disastrous emotional and financial consequences to the patient. Many patients have traditionally been classified as "spinal cripples" and are consigned to a life of long-term narcotic treatment with little chance of recovery.  Despite extensive work in recent years, FBS remains a challenging and costly disorder.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.nrl.0000138733.09406.39 | author = Onesti S.

A Swedish study of chronic pain and iatrogenic opioid addiction was reported from the [[methadone]] program at the [[Uppsala University Hospital]]. The aims were to improve pain relief and quality of life in pain patients with problematic opioid use and to investigate background factors explaining problems with opioid use.  Titration of oral methadone mixture in daily doses ranging from 10 to 350&nbsp;mg was done on all patients. Background factors were low back and musculoskeletal pain in 40%, psychiatric disease in 68%, and substance use disorder in 32% of the patients. Before methadone treatment all patients were on sick leave. After treatment five patients returned to work. Ten patients failed treatment, 4 due to intractable nausea, 4 to drug diversion, 1 because of methadone related arrhythmia and 1 because of insufficient analgesia. Pain relief was rated good by 75% and moderate by 25% of the patients. Global quality of life was deemed to have improved, somewhat.  It was concluded a structured methadone program can be used for treating chronic pain patients with [[opioid dependence]] improving pain relief and quality of life. However, side effects and serious adverse events may limit the beneficial effects of the method.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.05.003 | author = Rhodin A.

Pain | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 271–8 | pmid = 15972261 }}</ref>   

A study of chronic pain patients from the [[University of Wisconsin]] found that [[methadone]] is most widely known for its use in the treatment of opioid dependence, but methadone also provides effective analgesia.  Patients who experience inadequate pain relief or intolerable side effects with other opioids or who suffer from neuropathic pain may benefit from a transition to methadone as their analgesic agent. Adverse effects, particularly respiratory depression and death, make a fundamental knowledge of methadone's pharmacological properties essential to the provider considering methadone as analgesic therapy for a patient with chronic pain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brown R.

A recent Italian study examined the use of [[fentanyl]] patches, sustained release [[morphine]] and [[methadone]] in chronic pain patients with cancer. All the three opioids used as first-line therapy were effective, well tolerated, and required similar amounts of symptomatic drugs or co-analgesics. Methadone was significantly less expensive, but required more changes, up and down, of the doses, suggesting that dose titration of this drug requires major clinical expertise.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ejpain.2008.01.013 | author = Mercandante S.

===Patient selection ===

Patients who have [[sciatic]] pain (pain in the back, radiating down the buttock to the leg) and clear clinical findings of an identifiable radicular nerve loss caused by a herniated disc will have a better post operative course than those who simply have low back pain.  If a specific disc herniation causing pressure on a nerve root cannot be identified, the results of surgery are likely to be disappointing.  Patients involved in worker's compensation, tort litigation or other compensation systems tend to fare more poorly after surgery.  Surgery for spinal stenosis usually has a good outcome, if the surgery is done in an extensive manner, and done within the first year or so of the appearance of symptoms.<ref name="pmid7249453" /><ref name="pmid7455766" /><ref name="Spengler D.

Oaklander and North define the Failed Back Syndrome as a chronic pain patient after one or more surgical procedure to the spine.  They delineated these characteristics of the relation between the patient and the surgeon: 
#The patient makes increasing demands on the surgeon for pain relief.  The surgeon may feel a strong responsibility to provide a remedy when the surgery has not achieved the desired goals.
#The patient grows increasingly angry at the failure and may become litigious.
#There is an escalation of narcotic pain medication which is habituating or addictive.
#In the face of expensive conservative treatments which are likely to fail, the surgeon is persuaded to attempt further surgery, even though this is likely to fail as well.
#The probability of returning to gainful employment decreases with increasing length of disability.
#The financial incentives to remain disabled far outweigh the incentive to recover.<ref>Oaklnader, A. L., and North, R. B.  "Failed back surgery syndrome" In Loeser, J. D., et al., eds. ''Bonica's Management of Pain'', Philadelphia, Lippincott Williams & Williams, 2001</ref>

In the absence of a generous or comfortable economic package for disability or worker's compensation, other psychological features may limit the ability of the patient to recover from surgery.  Some patients are simply unfortunate, and fall into the category of "chronic pain" despite their desire to recover and the best efforts of the physicians involved in their care.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Haider TT, Kishino ND, Gray TP, Tomlin MA, Daubert HB | title= Functional restoration: Comparison of surgical and nonsurgical spine patients | year = 1998 | url = | journal = J.

=== Total disc replacement ===

Lumbar total disc replacement was originally designed to be an alternative to lumbar arthodesis (fusion).   The procedure was met with great excitement and heightened expectations both in the United States and Europe.  In late 2004, the first lumbar total disc replacement received approval from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). More experience existed in Europe.  Since then, the initial excitement has given way to skepticism and concern.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200112010-00002 | author = Fritzell P.

=== Electrical stimulation ===

Many failed back patients are significantly impaired by chronic pain in the back and legs.   Many of these will be treated with some form of electrical stimulation.  This can be either a [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] device placed on the skin over the back or a nerve stimulator implanted into the back  with electrical probes which directly touch the spinal cord.   Also, some chronic pain patients utilize [[fentanyl]] or narcotic patches.  These patients are generally severely impaired and it is unrealistic to conclude that application of neurostimulation will reduce that impairment.  For example, it is doubtful that neurostimulation will improve the patient enough to return to competitive employment.  Neurostimulation is [[palliative]].   TENS units work by blocking neurotransmission as described by the pain theory of Melzack and Wall.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang JK |title=Stimulation-produced analgesia |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=28–30 |year=1976 |month=January |pmid=765636 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Success rates for implanted neurostimulation has been reported to be 25% to 55%.  Success is defined as a relative decrease in pain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de la Porte C, Siegfried J |title=Lumbosacral spinal fibrosis (spinal arachnoiditis).

==Prognosis ==

Under rules promulgated by Titles II and XVI of the United States [[Social Security Act]], chronic radiculopathy, arachnoiditis and spinal stenosis are recognized as disabling conditions under Listing 1.04 A (radiculopathy), 1.04 B (arachnoiditis) and 1.04 C (spinal stenosis).

In a groundbreaking Canadian study, Waddell ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal | author = Waddell G. ''et al.'' | year = 1979 | title = Failed lumbar disc surgery and repeat surgery following industrial injuries| url =http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/61/2/201 | journal = J. Bone Joint Surgery | volume = 61A | issue = 2| pages = 201–206 |pmid=422604}}</ref> reported on the value of repeat surgery and the return to work in worker's compensation cases.  They concluded that workers who undergo spinal surgery take longer to return to their jobs.  Once two spinal surgeries are performed, few if any ever return to gainful employment of any kind.  After two spinal surgeries, most people in the worker's comp system will not be made better by more surgery.  Most will be worse after a third surgery.  

Episodes of back pain associated with on the job injuries in the worker's compensation setting are usually of short duration.  About 10% of such episodes will not be simple, and will degenerate into chronic and disabling back pain conditions, even if surgery is not performed.<ref>{{cite book | author=Waddell G. |title=The Back Pain Revolution | location= London |publisher= Churchill Livingstone |year= 1998 | isbn=978-0-443-06039-7 | edition=1st }} {{page needed|date=January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200102150-00007 | author = Litton S., van Tulder M. | year = 2001 | title = A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words| url = | journal = Spine | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 339–44 }}</ref>

A Finnish study of return to work in patients with [[spinal stenosis]] treated by surgery found that: (1) none of the patients who had retired before the operation returned to work afterward. (2) The variables that predicted postoperative ability to work for women were: being fit to work at the time of operation, age < 50 years at the time of operation, and duration of lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms < 2 years. (3) For men, these variables were: being fit to work at the time of operation, age < 50 years at the time of operation, no prior surgery, and the extent of the surgical procedure equal to or less than one [[laminectomy]]. Women's and men's working capacity do not differ after lumbar spinal stenosis operation. If the aim is to maximize working capacity, then, when a lumbar spinal stenosis operation is indicated, it should be performed without delay. In lumbar spinal stenosis patients who are > 50 years old and on sick leave, it is unrealistic to expect that they will return to work. Therefore, after such an extensive surgical procedure, re-education of patients for lighter jobs could improve the chances of these patients returning to work.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199610)30:4<473::AID-AJIM13>3.0.CO;2-1 | author = Herno A.

In a related Finnish study, a total of 439 patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis during the period 1974-1987 was re-examined and evaluated for working and functional capacity approximately 4 years after the decompressive surgery.   The ability to work before or after the operation and a history of no prior back surgery were variables predictive of a good outcome. Before the operation 86 patients were working, 223 patients were on sick leave, and 130 patients were retired. After the operation 52 of the employed patients and 70 of the unemployed patients returned to work. None of the retired patients returned to work. Ability to work preoperatively, age under 50 years at the time of operation and the absence of prior back surgery predicted a postoperative ability to work.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02226576 | author = Airaksinen O.

A report from Belgium noted that patients reportedly return to work an average of 12 to 16 weeks after surgery for lumbar disc herniation. However, there are studies that lend credence to the value of an earlier stimulation for return to work and performance of normal activities after a limited discectomy. At follow-up assessment, it was found that no patient had changed employment because of back or leg pain.
The sooner the recommendation is made to return to work and perform normal activities, the more likely the patient is to comply. Patients with ongoing disabling back conditions have a low priority for return to work. The probability of return to work decreases as time off work increases.   This is especially true in Belgium, where 20% of individuals did not resume work activities after surgery for a disc herniation of the lumbar spine. 

In Belgium, the medical advisers of sickness funds have an important role legally in the assessment of working capacity and medical rehabilitation measures for employees whose fitness for work is jeopardized or diminished for health reasons. The measures are laid down in the sickness and invalidity legislation. They are in accordance with the principle of preventing long-term disability. It is apparent from the authors' experience that these measures are not adapted consistently in medical practice. Most of the medical advisers are focusing purely on evaluation of corporal damage, leaving little or no time for rehabilitation efforts. In many other countries, the evaluation of work capacity is done by social security doctors with a comparable task.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Donceel P, Du Bois M, Lahaye D |title=Return to work after surgery for lumbar disc herniation.

In a comprehensive set of studies carried out by the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]], it was determined that the outcome of lumbar fusion performed on injured workers was worse than reported in most published case series.

The identification of [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNF) as a central cause of inflammatory spinal pain now suggests the possibility of an entirely new approach to selected patients with FBSS.  Specific and potent inhibitors of TNF became available in the U.S. in 1998, and were demonstrated to be potentially effective for treating [[sciatica]] in experimental models beginning in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sommer C, Schäfers M, Marziniak M, Toyka KV |title=Etanercept reduces hyperalgesia in experimental painful neuropathy |journal=J Peripher Nerv Syst. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=67–72 |year=2001 |month=Jun |pmid=11446385 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1085-9489&date=2001&volume=6&issue=2&spage=67 |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8027.2001.01010.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Olmarker K, Rydevik B |title=Selective inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha prevents nucleus pulposus-induced thrombus formation, intraneural edema, and reduction of nerve conduction velocity: possible implications for future pharmacologic treatment strategies of sciatica |journal=Spine |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=863–9 |year=2001 |month=Apr |pmid=11317106 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0362-2436&volume=26&issue=8&spage=863 |doi=10.1097/00007632-200104150-00007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Murata Y, Onda A, Rydevik B, Takahashi K, Olmarker K |title=Selective inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha prevents nucleus pulposus-induced histologic changes in the dorsal root ganglion |journal=Spine |volume=29 |issue=22 |pages=2477–84 |year=2004 |month=Nov |pmid=15543058 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0362-2436&volume=29&issue=22&spage=2477 |doi=10.1097/01.brs.0000144406.17512.ea}}</ref> Targeted anatomic administration of one of these anti-TNF agents, [[etanercept]], a patented treatment method,<ref>{{US patent|6537549}}

If chronic pain in FBSS has a chemical component producing inflammatory pain, then prior to additional surgery it may make sense to use an anti-inflammatory approach.  Often this is first attempted with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, but the long-term use of [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDS) for patients with persistent back pain is complicated by their possible cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicity; and NSAIDs have limited value to intervene in TNF-mediated processes.<ref name=persistent/>  An alternative often employed is the injection of cortisone into the spine adjacent to the suspected pain generator, a technique known as "epidural steroid injection".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fredman B, Nun MB, Zohar E, ''et al.'' |title=Epidural steroids for treating "failed back surgery syndrome": is fluoroscopy really necessary? |journal=Anesth Analg. |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=367–72 |year=1999 |month=Feb |pmid=9972758 |url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9972758 |doi=10.1097/00000539-199902000-00027}}</ref>   Although this technique began more than a decade ago for FBSS, the efficacy of epidural steroid injections is now generally thought to be limited to short term pain relief in selected patients only.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Landau WM, Nelson DA, Armon C, Argoff CE, Samuels J, Backonja MM |title=Assessment: use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular lumbosacral pain: report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology |journal=Neurology |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=614; author reply 614–5 |year=2007 |month=Aug |pmid=17679685 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000278878.51713.c8 }}</ref> In addition, epidural steroid injections, in certain settings, may result in serious complications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abbasi A, Malhotra G, Malanga G, Elovic EP, Kahn S |title=Complications of interlaminar cervical epidural steroid injections: a review of the literature |journal=Spine |volume=32 |issue=19 |pages=2144–51 |year=2007 |month=Sep |pmid=17762818 |doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e318145a360 }}</ref> Fortunately there are now emerging new methods that directly target TNF.<ref name=perispinal>{{cite journal |author=Tobinick EL, Britschgi-Davoodifar S |title=Perispinal TNF-alpha inhibition for discogenic pain |journal=Swiss Med Wkly |volume=133 |issue=11–12 |pages=170–7 |year=2003 |month=Mar |pmid=12715286 |doi=}}</ref>  These TNF-targeted methods represent a highly promising new approach for patients with chronic severe spinal pain, such as those with FBSS.<ref name=perispinal/> Ancillary approaches, such as rehabilitation, [[physical therapy]], [[anti-depressants]], and, in particular, graduated exercise programs, may all be useful adjuncts to anti-inflammatory approaches.<ref name=persistent/> In addition, more invasive modalities, such as spinal cord stimulation, may offer relief for certain patients with FBSS, but these modalities, although often referred to as "minimally invasive", require additional surgery, and have complications of their own.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bell GK, Kidd D, North RB |title=Cost-effectiveness analysis of spinal cord stimulation in treatment of failed back surgery syndrome |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=286–95 |year=1997 |month=May |pmid=9185434 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0885392496003235 |doi=10.1016/S0885-3924(96)00323-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kumar K, Taylor RS, Jacques L, ''et al.'' |title=Spinal cord stimulation versus conventional medical management for neuropathic pain: a multicentre randomised controlled trial in patients with failed back surgery syndrome |journal=Pain |volume=132 |issue=1–2 |pages=179–88 |year=2007 |month=Nov |pmid=17845835 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.07.028 }}</ref>

A report from Spain noted that the investigation and development of new techniques for instrumented surgery of the spine is not free from conflicts of interest. The influence of financial forces in the development of new technologies and its immediate application to spine surgery, shows the relationship between the published results and the industry support. Authors who have developed and defended fusion techniques have also published new articles praising  new spinal technologies. The author calls spinal surgery the  "American Stock and Exchange" and "the bubble of spine surgery". The scientific literature doesn't show clear evidence in the cost-benefit studies of most instrumented surgical interventions of the spine compared with the conservative treatments. It has not been yet demonstrated that fusion surgery and disc replacement are better options than the conservative treatment. It's necessary to point out that at present "there are relationships between the industry and back pain, and there is also an industry of the back pain". Nonetheless, the "market of the spine surgery" is growing  because patients are demanding solutions for their back problems. The tide of scientific evidence seems to go against the spinal fusions in the degenerative disc disease, discogenic pain and in specific back pain. After decades of advances in this field, the results of spinal fusions are mediocre. New epidemiological studies show that "spinal fusion must be accepted as a non proved or experimental method for the treatment of back pain". The surgical literature on spinal fusion published in the last 20 years establishes that instrumentation seems to slightly increase the fusion rate and that instrumentation doesn't improve the clinical results in general. We still are in need of randomized studies to compare the surgical results with the natural history of the disease, the placebo effect, or conservative treatment. The European Guidelines for lumbar chronic pain management show  "strong evidence" indicating that complex and demanding spine surgery where different instrumentation is used, is not more effective than a simple, safer and cheaper posterolateral fusion without instrumentation. Recently, the literature published in this field is sending a message to use "minimally invasive techniques"; - the abandonment of  transpedicular fusions.   Surgery in general, and usage of metal fixation should be discarded in most cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robaina-Padrón FJ |title=Controversias de la cirugía instrumentada y el tratamiento del dolor lumbar por enfermedad degenerativa.

In Sweden, the national registry of lumbar spine surgery reported in the year 2000 that 15% of patients with spinal stenosis surgery underwent a concomitant fusion.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/000164701317323327 | author = Stromquist B.

There were twice the number of surgeons per capita in the United States compared to the United Kingdom.  Numbers were similar to Sweden.  Despite having very few spinal surgeons, the Netherlands proved to be quite aggressive in surgery.  Sweden, despite having a large number of surgeons was conservative and produced relatively few surgeries.  The most surgeries were done in the United States.  In the UK, more than a third of non-urgent patients waited over a year to see a spinal surgeon.  In Wales, more than half waited over three months for consult.  Lower rates of referrals in the United Kingdom was found to discourage surgery in general.  Fee for service and easy access to care was thought to encourage spinal surgery in the United States, whereas salaried position and a conservative philosophy led to less surgery in the United Kingdom.  There were more spinal surgeons in Sweden than in the United States.  However, it was speculated that the Swedish surgeons being limited to compensation of 40–48 hours a week might lead to a conservative philosophy.  It should be noted that there have been calls for a more aggressive approach to lumbar surgery in both the United Kingdom and Sweden in recent years.<ref name=restraint>{{cite journal |author=Deyo RA, Nachemson A, Mirza SK |title=Spinal-fusion surgery – the case for restraint |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=350 |issue=7 |pages=722–6 |year=2004 |month=Feb |pmid=14960750 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsb031771 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197001152820306 | author = Bunker J.
