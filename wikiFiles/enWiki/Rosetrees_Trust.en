'''Rosetrees Trust''' (Charitable) was created in 1987 by a family business, using [[venture philanthropy]] to find and fund leading medical researchers across a wide range of illnesses.

Rosetrees provides grant funding to medical researchers to support research likely to lead to early life changing and improvements in human health.<ref>[http://alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=309]</ref>

==History==
Rosetrees was established in 1987 and over 20 years, using an endowment provided by the founding family, has gifted millions of pounds to medical research. Rosetrees has supported a network of professors, researchers and universities. In that time it has used some of its income (£2 million) to help secure over £60 million of grants from major funders such as the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[Medical Research Council (UK)]] and [[Cancer Research UK]].

==Vision==
{{peacock|section|date=March 2011}}
The Rosetrees Trust's vision is to fund medical / medical science researchers whether established or young and promising with the potential to become future leaders in their field.<ref>[http://www.icr.ac.uk/support_us/trust_supporters/partnership_navon/rosetrees/index.shtml]</ref> 

It recognises early potential and supports new diagnostic testing and the testing of existing drugs for other benefits. In fact, at this moment, Rosetrees Trust supports over 100 projects, including researchers at the [[Institute of Cancer Research]], [[Arthritis Research Campaign]], [[Royal College of Surgeons]], [[University College London]], [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[Kings College London]], [[Imperial College London]],<ref>[http://www.rosetreestrust.co.uk/examples-of-projects/tissue-engineering.html]</ref> [[Institute of Psychiatry]],<ref>[http://www.rosetreestrust.co.uk/examples-of-projects/alzheimers-disease-diagnostic-test.html]</ref> [[UCL Institute of Neurology]],<ref>[http://www.rosetreestrust.co.uk/examples-of-projects/Neurology.html]</ref> [[Royal Free Hospital]],<ref>[http://www.rosetreestrust.co.uk/examples-of-projects/fibrosis-and-scleroderma.html]</ref> and [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

Rosetrees Trust focuses on:
# Seed corn funding for projects which funders like the Wellcome Trust and the MRC would want to take forwards to clinical benefit
# Financial support for promising young researchers such as PhD, Post PhD, MBPhD and Junior fellowships
# Practical research with potential for short term benefits
# Long term projects to solve illness that affects millions of people
# New imaging techniques to improve, monitor and speed up treatments <ref>[http://www.rbht.nhs.uk/research/brus/cardiovascular-bru/projects/]</ref>

==Current projects==

Rosetrees contribution to over 150 research projects covers 12 main areas of health:

# Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia
# Brain Research
# Cancer
# Coronary and Lung Disease
# Digestive and Urinary Disorders
# Eye Disease and Hearing Disorders
# Immunology and Transplantation
# Maternity and Children
# Parkinson's Disease
# Rheumatology and Tissue Disorders
# Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine

Projects are as diverse and varied as funding the use of fish oils to fend off arthritis, to inserting heart cells grown from
stem cells to repair heart muscle.

Rosetrees looks for projects that are likely to lead to early practical benefit and help the largest number of people. Many researchers and surgeons see practical potential benefits for example Rosetrees supports the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] fellowships where researchers test their ideas. This has led to the Rosetrees Prize for the best projects (see below for more details.

==Projects funded==
Some of the 150 research projects include:

* Part funding of research, which led to Seraticin a novel antibiotic being developed by scientists at [[Swansea University]] able to kill 12 different strains of MRSA [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]], as well as [[Escherichia coli]] and [[Clostridium difficile]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7543930.stm]</ref>

* Rosetrees has supported the [[Institute of Cancer Research]] scientists with more than £200,000 to date. For example Professor Colin Cooper, Head of the Male Urological Cancer Research Centre, in his research into prostate cancer.<ref>[http://www.icr.ac.uk/support_us/trust_supporters/partnership_navon/rosetrees/index.shtml]</ref>

* Funding a fellowship for Arthritis Research UK formerly known as [[Arthritis Research Campaign]] to support translational research aiming to develop potential novel approaches to treating or preventing the pain resulting from degenerative intervertebral discs.<ref>[http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/research/applying_for_a_grant/types_of_grant/fellowships/rosetrees_trust_fellowship.aspx]</ref>

* Funding fellowships and prizes at the [[Royal College of Surgeons]].<ref>[http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/fundraising/rosetrees-prize]</ref> In 2009 Rosetrees Trust began supporting a new annual prize for Surgical Research Fellows for the best essay in answer to the question ‘Describe how your research project will contribute to improvements in patient care within the next five years?’ The 2010 winner was Surgeon Lt-Commander Catherine Doran MRCS: ‘To Stop the Bleeding in a War Zone’.<ref>[ www.natomedicalconference2009.gov.pt/.../TWNATOMedicalConference2009.ppt]</ref>
