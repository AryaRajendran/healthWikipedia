[[File:North Atlantic right whale Ankylosis Picture 0119.jpg|right|thumb|Osseous ankylosis has fused two vertebrae of this [[North Atlantic right whale]] specimen]]
'''Ankylosis''' or '''anchylosis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀγκύλος, bent, crooked) is a stiffness of a [[joint]] due to abnormal adhesion and rigidity of the bones of the joint, which may be the result of [[injury]] or [[disease]]. The rigidity may be complete or partial and may be due to inflammation of the tendinous or muscular structures outside the joint or of the tissues of the joint itself. [[Noma (disease)| Noma]]—a [[gangrene|gangrenous]] disease still widespread among [[malnourished]] children living on the borders of the [[Sahara desert]]—can cause ankylosis of the [[maxilla]] and [[Human mandible|mandible]], impairing the ability to speak and eat.<ref>{{Citation |first=G.

When the structures outside the joint are affected, the term "false" ankylosis has been used in contradistinction to "true" ankylosis, in which the disease is within the joint. When inflammation has caused the joint-ends of the bones to be fused together the ankylosis is termed ''osseous'' or complete. Excision of a completely ankylosed shoulder or elbow may restore free mobility and usefulness to the limb.  "Ankylosis"  is also used as an anatomical term, bones being said to ankylose (or anchylose) when, from being originally distinct, they coalesce, or become so joined together that no motion can take place between them.

==Fossil record==
{{Main|Paleopathology}}
Evidence for ankylosis found in the fossil record is studied by [[paleopathologists]], specialists in ancient disease and injury. Ankylosis has been reported in dinosaur fossils from several species, including ''[[Allosaurus fragilis]]'', ''[[Becklespinax altispinax]]'', ''[[Poekilopleuron bucklandii]]'', and ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' (including the [[Stan the T. rex|Stan]] specimen).<ref name="molnar-pathology">Molnar, R.
