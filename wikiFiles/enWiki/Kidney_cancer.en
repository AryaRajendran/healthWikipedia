'''Kidney cancer''' is a type of [[cancer]] that starts in the cells in the [[kidney]].

The two most common types of kidney cancer are [[renal cell carcinoma]] (RCC) and [[urothelial cell carcinoma]] (UCC) of the [[renal pelvis]]. These names reflect the type of cell from which the cancer developed.  

The different types of kidney cancer (such as RCC and UCC) develop in different ways, meaning that the diseases have different outlooks (or [[prognosis]]), and need to be [[cancer staging|staged]] and treated in different ways. RCC is responsible for approximately 80% of primary renal cancers, and UCC accounts the majority of the remainder (20%).<ref name="rccvsucc">{{cite journal |author=Mulders PF, Brouwers AH, Hulsbergen-van der Kaa CA, van Lin EN, Osanto S, de Mulder PH |title=[Guideline 'Renal cell carcinoma'] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=152 |issue=7 |pages=376–80 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18380384 |doi=}}</ref>

Cancer in the kidney may also be secondary, the result of metastasis from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.

==Location within the kidney==
Kidney cancer originates in the kidney in two principal locations:  the [[renal tubule]] and the [[renal pelvis]].  Most cancers in the renal tubule are renal cell carcinoma and clear cell adenocarcinoma.  Most cancers in the renal pelvis are transitional cell carcinoma.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common signs and symptoms of kidney cancer are a mass in the [[abdomen]] and/or blood in the urine (or [[hematuria]]). Other symptoms may include tiredness, loss of appetite, weight loss, a high temperature and heavy sweating, and persistent pain in the abdomen.<ref>[http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/kidney-cancer/about/symptoms-of-kidney-cancer Symptoms of kidney cancer : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Kidney cancer: Innovative new treatments boost survival rates for cancer patients: Daily Checkup with [[Michael Palese]] |author=Katie Charles |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/health/2011/01/19/2011-01-19_kidney_cancer_innovative_new_treatments_boost_survival_rates_for_cancer_patients.html |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref> However, many of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions, and there may also be no signs or symptoms in a person with kidney cancer, especially in the early stages of the disease.

==Epidemiology==
Around 208,500 new cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed in the world each year, accounting for just under 2% of all cancers.<ref>Lindblad, P. and Adami H.O, Kidney Cancer, in Textbook of Cancer.</ref> The highest rates are recorded in Northern America and the lowest rates in Asian and African regions.<ref>GLOBOCAN 2002, Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide 2002 estimates. 2006.</ref>

The United States' NIH estimates for 2013 around 64,770 new cases of kidney cancer and 13,570 deaths from the disease.<ref>{{cite web

The most recent estimates of incidence of kidney cancer suggest that there are 63,300 new cases annually in the EU25. In Europe, kidney cancer accounts for nearly 3% of all cancer cases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ferlay J. ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Estimates of the cancer incidence and mortality in Europe in 2006 | url = | journal = Ann Oncol | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 581–92 }}</ref>

In the UK kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in men (5,377 new cases diagnosed in 2008), and the ninth most common cancer in women (3,380 new cases in 2008), giving a male:female ratio of over 3:2. The number of cases of kidney cancer in men in the UK has doubled from 7 per 100,000 to 14.8 per 100,000 between 1975-1977 and 2006-2008. In women the rates have more than doubled over the same period, rising from 3.2 to 7.5 per 100,000.<ref>[http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/kidney/incidence/ Kidney cancer incidence statistics : Cancer Research UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The incidence of kidney cancer is also increasing in the United States. This is thought to be a real increase, not only due to changes in the way the disease is diagnosed.<ref>{{Cite book

==Risks and causes==
Factors that increase the risk of kidney cancer include smoking, which can double the risk of the disease; regular use of [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s such as [[ibuprofen]] and [[naproxen]], which may increase the risk by 51%<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-12/commonly-used-pain-pills-increase-kidney-cancer-risk-in-study.html Commonly Used Pain Pills Increase Kidney Cancer Risk in Study - Bloomberg<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> or may not;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lipworth|first=Loren|coauthors=Robert E.

There are also other possible risk factors such as high blood pressure, which are being investigated by scientists.<ref>[http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/kidney-cancer/about/risks-and-causes-of-kidney-cancer Risks and causes of kidney cancer : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment for kidney cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease. Usually treatment doesn't involve [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]], as kidney cancers often do not respond to these treatments. 

If the cancer has not spread, it will usually be removed by surgery. Sometimes this involves removing the whole kidney, which is called [[nephrectomy]]. But surgery is not always possible - for example the patient may have other medical conditions that prevent it, or the cancer may have spread around the body and doctors may not be able to remove it.<ref>[http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/kidney-cancer/treatment/types/early-stage-kidney-cancer#surgery Early stage and locally advanced kidney cancer treatment : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There is currently no evidence that body-wide medical therapy after surgery where there is no known residual disease, that is, [[adjuvant therapy]], helps to improve survival in kidney cancer.

If the cancer can't be cured with surgery, sometimes doctors may use other techniques such as [[cryotherapy]] (freezing the tumour away) or [[radiofrequency ablation]] (burning the tumour away). However these are not yet used as standard treatments for kidney cancer.<ref>[http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/kidney-cancer/treatment/types/advanced-kidney-cancer#other Advanced kidney cancer : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other treatment options include biological therapies (drug treatments that use natural substances from the body) such as [[everolimus|Everolimus (Afinitor)]], [[torisel|Temsirolimus (Torisel)]], [[nexavar|Sorafenib (Nexavar)]], [[sutent|Sunitinib (Sutent)]], and [[axitinib|Axitinib (Inlyta)]], the use of immunotherapy including [[interferon]] and [[interleukin-2]].<ref>[http://hemonc.org/Renal_cancer List of treatments for kidney cancer]</ref><ref>[http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/kidney.pdf NCCN kidney cancer guidelines]</ref><ref>[http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/kidney-cancer/treatment/biological/ Biological therapy for kidney cancer : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Immunotherapy has the potential to induce complete remissions or durable partial remissions in some patients, although it works in only about 10 to 15% of patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.cancercare.org/publications/original/16-ccc_kidney_cancer.pdf |title=CancerCare Connect - Treatment Update: Kidney Cancer |publisher=Cancer Care, Inc. |date=August 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-29 |author=Jonasch, Eric |coauthors=Messner, Carolyn}}</ref>

In [[Wilms' tumor]] (a type of kidney cancer that affects children), chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the accepted treatments, depending on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed.<ref name=wilms-tumour>[http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-questions/wilms-tumour Wilms' tumour (kidney cancer in children) : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other rare forms of kidney cancer are not discussed here.

[[IMA901]] is used to treat patients with cancer of the kidneys. It is composed of ten synthetic tumor-associated peptides (TUMAPs), which activate the body's own killer T-cells against the tumor. Unlike chemotherapy, this process targets the body's immune responses and mobilizes them to attack the cancer. 

===In children===

The majority of kidney cancers reported in children are Wilms' tumors. These tumors can begin to grow when a baby is still developing the womb, and may not cause problems until the child is a few years old. Wilms' tumor is most common in children under the age of 5, but can rarely be diagnosed in older children or in adults. It is still not clear what causes most Wilms' tumors. The most common symptoms are swelling of the abdomen and blood in the child's urine.<ref name=wilms-tumour/>
