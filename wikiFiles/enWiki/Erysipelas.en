'''Erysipelas''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ἐρυσίπελας—''red skin''; also known as "Ignis sacer", "holy fire", and "St. Anthony's fire"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|260}} in some countries) is an acute [[streptococcus]] [[bacteria]]l infection<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000036667|erysipelas}}</ref> of the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics.

== Risk factors ==
This disease is most common among the elderly, infants, and children. People with [[immune deficiency]], [[diabetes]], [[alcoholism]], [[Ulcer (dermatology)|skin ulceration]], [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infections]] and impaired [[lymph node|lymph]]atic drainage (e.g., after [[mastectomy]], pelvic surgery, [[Bypass (surgical)|bypass]] grafting) are also at increased risk.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[image:Erysipel.JPG|thumb|Erysipelas on an arm]]
Patients typically develop symptoms including high [[fevers]], [[tremor|shaking]], [[chills]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[headaches]], [[vomiting]], and general illness within 48 hours of the initial infection. The erythematous skin lesion enlarges rapidly and has a sharply demarcated raised edge. It appears as a red, swollen, warm, hardened and painful [[rash]], similar in consistency to an orange peel. More severe infections can result in [[Cutaneous condition#Primary_lesions|vesicles]], [[blister|bullae]], and [[petechia]]e, with possible skin [[necrosis]]. [[Lymph node]]s may be swollen, and [[lymphedema]] may occur. Occasionally, a red streak extending to the lymph node can be seen.

The infection may occur on any part of the skin including the face, arms, fingers, legs and toes, but it tends to favor the extremities. Fat tissue is most susceptible to infection, and facial areas typically around the eyes, ears, and cheeks. Repeated infection of the extremities can lead to chronic swelling ([[lymphadenitis]]).

==Etiology==
Most cases of erysipelas are due to ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (also known as beta-hemolytic [[group A streptococci]]), although non-group A streptococci can also be the causative agent.  Beta-hemolytic, non-group A streptococci include ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'', also known as group B strep or GBS. Historically, the face was most affected; today the legs are affected most often.<ref>See eMedicine link</ref> The rash is due to an [[exotoxin]], not the Strep. bacteria itself and is found in areas where no symptoms are present - e.g. the infection may be in the nasopharynx, but the rash is found usually on the face and arms.

Erysipelas infections can enter the skin through minor trauma, insect bites, dog bites, [[eczema]], surgical incisions and ulcers, and often originate from strep bacteria in the subject's own nasal passages. Infection sets in after a small scratch or abrasion spreads resulting in toxaemia.

Erysipelas does not affect subcutaneous tissue. It does not release pus, only serum or serous fluid. Subcutaneous edema may lead the physician to misdiagnose it as [[cellulitis]], but the style of the rash is much more well circumscribed and sharply marginated than the rash of cellulitis.

==Diagnosis==
This disease is diagnosed mainly by the appearance of well-demarcated rash and inflammation. Blood cultures are unreliable for diagnosis of the disease, but may be used to test for [[sepsis]]. Erysipelas must be differentiated from [[herpes zoster]], [[angioedema]], [[contact dermatitis]], and diffuse inflammatory [[carcinoma]] of the breast.

Erysipelas can be distinguished from [[cellulitis]] by its raised advancing edges and sharp borders. Elevation of the [[antistreptolysin]] O (ASO) titer occurs after around 10 days of illness.

==Treatment==
Depending on the severity, treatment involves either oral or intravenous antibiotics, using [[penicillin]]s, [[clindamycin]] or [[erythromycin]]. While illness symptoms resolve in a day or two, the skin may take weeks to return to normal.

Because of the risk of reinfection, prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes used after resolution of the initial condition. However, this approach does not always stop reinfection.<ref name="pmid17387234">{{cite journal |author=Koster JB, Kullberg BJ, van der Meer JW |title=Recurrent erysipelas despite antibiotic prophylaxis: an analysis from case studies |journal=The Netherlands journal of medicine |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=89–94 |year=2007 |pmid=17387234 |doi=}}</ref>

==Complications==
*Spread of infection to other areas of body through the bloodstream ([[bacteremia]]), including septic arthritis. Glomerulonephritis can follow from a streptococcal erysipelas or other skin infection, but not rheumatic fever.
*Recurrence of infection—Erysipelas can recur in 18–30% of cases even after antibiotic treatment.
*Lymphatic damage
*[[Necrotizing fasciitis]]—commonly known as "the flesh-eating bug". A potentially deadly exacerbation of the infection if it spreads to deeper tissue.

==In animals==<!-- [[Erysipelas (animals)]] redirects here -->
'''Erysipelas''' is also the name given to an infection in animals caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae]]''.

''Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae'' can also infect humans, but in that case the infection is known as [[erysipeloid]].
