{{Other uses|Half-life (disambiguation)}}

The '''biological half-life''' or '''elimination half-life''' of a substance is the time it takes for a substance (for example a [[metabolite]], [[drug]], [[signalling molecule]], radioactive [[nuclide]], or other substance) to lose half of its pharmacologic, physiologic, or radiologic activity, as per the [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] definition. In a medical context, half-life may also describe the time it takes for the [[blood plasma]] concentration of a substance to halve ("plasma half-life") its steady-state. The relationship between the biological and plasma half-lives of a substance can be complex depending on the substance in question, due to factors including accumulation in tissues, active metabolites, and receptor interactions.<ref name="SCM">{{cite book|title=Spinal cord medicine|author1=Lin VW|author2=Cardenas DD|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing, LLC|page=251|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3anl3G4No_oC&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251|year=2003|isbn=1-888799-61-7}}</ref>

Biological half-life is an important [[pharmacokinetic]] parameter and is usually denoted by the abbreviation '''''t<sub>½</sub>'''''.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=biological half life|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/B00658.html}}</ref>

While a [[radioactive]] isotope decays perfectly according to first order kinetics where the rate constant is fixed, the elimination of a substance from a living organism, into the environment, follows more complex [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]]. See the article [[rate equation]].

==Examples of biological half-lives==
=== Water ===
The biological half-life of water in a human is about 7 to 14 [[day]]s. It can be altered by behavior. Drinking large amounts of [[alcohol]] will reduce the biological half-life of water in the body.<ref name="isbn0-12-369413-2">{{cite book | author = Nordberg, Gunnar | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Handbook on the toxicology of metals | edition = | language = | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2007 | origyear = | pages =119 | quote =  | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = | isbn = 0-12-369413-2 }}</ref><ref name="isbn0-521-84228-X">{{cite book | author = Silk, Kenneth R.; Tyrer, Peter J. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Cambridge textbook of effective treatments in psychiatry | edition = | language = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2008 | origyear = | pages = 295 | quote =  | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = | isbn = 0-521-84228-X }}</ref> This has been used to decontaminate humans who are internally contaminated with [[tritiated water]] ([[tritium]]). Drinking the same amount of water would have a similar effect, but many would find it difficult to drink a large volume of water. The basis of this decontamination method (used at [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment|Harwell]]) is to increase the rate at which the water in the body is replaced with new water.

=== Alcohol ===
The removal of [[ethanol]] (drinking [[alcohol]]) through oxidation by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] in the [[liver]] from the human body is limited. Hence the removal of a large concentration of alcohol from [[blood]] may follow [[Rate equation#Zero-order reactions|zero-order kinetics]]. Also the rate-limiting steps for one substance may be in common with other substances. For instance, the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the biochemistry of [[methanol]] and [[ethylene glycol]]. In this way the oxidation of methanol to the [[toxic]] [[formaldehyde]] and [[formic acid]] in the (human body) can be prevented by giving an appropriate amount of [[ethanol]] to a person who has [[eating|ingested]] methanol. Note that methanol is very toxic and causes [[blindness]] and death. A person who has ingested [[ethylene glycol]] can be treated in the same way.

=== Metals ===
The biological half-life of [[caesium]] in humans is between one and four months. This can be shortened by feeding the person [[prussian blue]]. The prussian blue in the digestive system acts as a solid [[ion exchange]]r which absorbs the caesium while releasing [[potassium]] ions.

For some substances, it is important to think of the human or animal body as being made up of several parts, each with their own affinity for the substance, and each part with a different biological half-life ([[physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling]]). Attempts to remove a substance from the whole organism may have the effect of increasing the burden present in one part of the organism. For instance, if a person who is contaminated with lead is given [[EDTA]] in a [[chelation therapy]], then while the rate at which lead is lost from the body will be increased, the lead within the body tends to relocate into the [[brain]] where it can do the most harm.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Rate equations==
===First-order elimination===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sodium thiopental]] -->
There are circumstances where the half-life varies with the concentration of the drug. Thus the half-life, under these circumstances, is proportional to the initial concentration of the drug ''A<sub>0</sub>'' and inversely proportional to the zero-order rate constant ''k<sub>0</sub>'' where:

:<math>t_{1/2} = \frac{0.5 A_{0}}{k_{0}} \,</math>

This process is usually a logarithmic process - that is, a constant proportion of the agent is eliminated per unit time.<ref>Birkett DJ (2002). For example, [[ethanol]] may be consumed in sufficient quantity to saturate the metabolic enzymes in the liver, and so is eliminated from the body at an approximately constant rate (zero-order elimination''Pharmacokinetics Made Easy'' (Revised Edition). Sydney: McGraw-Hill Australia. ISBN 0-07-471072-9.</ref> Thus the fall in plasma concentration after the administration of a single dose is described by the following equation:

:<math>C_{t} = C_{0} e^{-kt} \,</math>

*''C<sub>t</sub>'' is concentration after time ''t''
*''C<sub>0</sub>'' is the initial concentration (''t''=0)
*''k'' is the [[elimination rate constant]]

The relationship between the elimination rate constant and half-life is given by the following equation:

:<math>k = \frac{\ln 2}{t_{1/2}} \,</math>

Half-life is determined by [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] (CL) and [[volume of distribution]] (V<sub>D</sub>) and the relationship is described by the following equation:

:<math>t_{1/2} = \frac{{\ln 2}\cdot{V_D}}{CL} \,</math>

In clinical practice, this means that it takes 4 to 5 times the half-life for a drug's serum concentration to reach steady state after regular dosing is started, stopped, or the dose changed.  So, for example, digoxin has a half-life (or t<sub>½</sub>) of 24–36 h; this means that a change in the dose will take the best part of a week to take full effect. For this reason, drugs with a long half-life (e.g. [[amiodarone]], elimination t<sub>½</sub> of about 58 days) are usually started with a [[loading dose]] to achieve their desired clinical effect more quickly.
