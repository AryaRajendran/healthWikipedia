[[Grapefruit]] and grapefruit juice have the potential to [[Drug interaction|interact]] with numerous [[drugs]].<ref>{{cite doi|                                 10.1503/cmaj.120951}}</ref> Organic compounds, which are [[furanocoumarin]] derivatives, interfere with the [[Liver|hepatic]] and [[Intestine|intestinal]] [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome P450]] [[isoform]] [[CYP3A4]] and are believed to be primarily responsible for the effects of grapefruit on the enzyme.  Bioactive compounds in grapefruit juice may also interfere with [[P-glycoprotein]] and [[organic anion transporting polypeptide]]s (OATPs), either increasing or decreasing the bioavailability of a number of drugs.  [[Pomelo]] (the Asian fruit which was crossed with an orange to produce grapefruit) also contains high amounts of [[furanocoumarin]] derivatives. Some [[grapefruit]]-[[pomelo]] hybrids have practically no [[furanocoumarin]] content, and one is a commercially viable seedless type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurity.org/health-medicine/hybrid-grapefruit-safe-for-prescription-meds/#more-42339 |title=– Hybrid grapefruit safe for prescription meds |publisher=Futurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref>

==Mechanism of the interaction==
The CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450 is located in both the liver and the [[enterocyte]]s. Many oral drugs undergo first-pass (presystemic) metabolism by the enzyme. Several organic compounds found in grapefruit and specifically in grapefruit juice exert inhibitory action on drug metabolism by the enzyme. It has been established that a group of compounds called [[furanocoumarins]] are responsible for this interaction, and not [[flavonoids]] as was previously reported.<ref name="pmid16685052">{{cite journal
|author=Paine MF, Widmer WW, Hart HL, ''et al.''

The list of active [[furanocoumarins]] found in grapefruit juice includes: [[bergamottin]], [[bergapten]], [[bergaptol]] and [[dihydroxybergamottin|6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin]].

This interaction is particularly dangerous when the drug in question has a low [[therapeutic index]], so that a small increase in blood concentration can be the difference between therapeutic effect and toxicity. Grapefruit juice inhibits the enzyme only within the [[intestines]], not in the [[liver]] or elsewhere in the body, and does not impact injected drugs. The degree of the effect varies widely between individuals and between samples of juice, and therefore cannot be accounted for ''a priori''.

Another mechanism of interaction is possibly through the [[P-glycoprotein]] (Pgp) that is localized in the [[wikt:apex|apical]] [[brush border]] of the [[enterocytes]]. Pgp transports [[lipophilic]] molecules out of the enterocyte back into the [[intestinal lumen]]. Drugs that possess lipophilic properties are either metabolised by CYP3A4 or removed into the intestine by the Pgp transporter. Both the Pgp and CYP3A4 may act synergistically as a barrier to many orally administered drugs. Therefore, their inhibition (both or alone) can markedly increase the bioavailability of a drug.

The interaction caused by grapefruit compounds lasts for up to 24 hours, and its effect is the greatest  when the juice is ingested with the drug or up to 4 hours before the drug.

The [[flavonoid]] existing in highest concentration in grapefruit juice is [[naringin]], which in humans is metabolised to [[naringenin]].{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=a previous sentence indicated that flavonoids aren't responsible for CYP3A4 effects, so why does this matter?}}  There are also other flavonoids in grapefruit juice, in lower concentrations. [[Orange juice]] does not contain [[naringin]] in as high a concentration, instead containing [[hesperetin]].  It is sometimes recommended as a substitute. Juice of [[lime (fruit)|lime]]s, and [[Seville orange]]s and apple juice can also inhibit metabolism of some drugs.
