'''Miracle Mineral Supplement''', often referred to as '''Miracle Mineral Solution''', '''Master Mineral Solution''', or '''MMS''', is the colloquial product name for an aqueous solution of 28% [[sodium chlorite]] in [[distilled water]]. The product contains essentially the same ingredient as industrial-strength [[bleach]] before "activation" with a food-grade acid. The name was first coined by Jim Humble in his 2006 [[self-publish]]ed book, ''The Miracle Mineral Solution of the 21st Century''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miraclemineral.org/products/the-miracle-mineral-solution-of-the-21st-century/ |title=Miracle Mineral |publisher=Miracle Mineral |date= |accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref> A more dilute version is marketed as '''Chlorine Dioxide Solution (CDS)'''.<ref name="FSAcds"> {{cite press release |publisher= [[Food Standards Agency]] |date= July 3, 2012 |title= Agency warning on chlorine solutions |url= http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2012/jul/cdswarning#.UJ8EzIawUzQ |accessdate= November 11, 2012 }}</ref>
MMS is promoted as a cure for [[HIV]], [[malaria]], [[viral hepatitis|hepatitis viruses]], the [[H1N1]] [[flu virus]], [[common cold]]s, [[acne]], [[cancer]], and more. There have been no clinical trials to provide evidence in support of these claims, which come only from anecdotal reports and Humble's book.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm152422.htm F.D.A.

==Safety and legal issues==
''[[The Guardian]]'' has described MMS as "extremely nasty stuff, and the medical advice given is that anyone who has this product should stop using it immediately and throw it away. In Canada it was banned after causing a life-threatening reaction."<ref>{{cite news | first = Martin | last = Robbins | title = The man who encourages the sick and dying to drink industrial bleach | date = 2010-09-15 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/sep/15/miracle-mineral-solutions-mms-bleach | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2012-01-25}}</ref> In August 2009, a Mexican woman travelling with her American husband on their yacht in [[Vanuatu]] took MMS as a preventative for malaria. Within 15 minutes she was ill, and within twelve hours she was dead. The island nation's public prosecutor, Kayleen Tavoa, did not press any charges as there were no specific laws banning the importation of MMS, but advised, "While every case is assessed on its own merits, I advise that any person who misuses MMS in Vanuatu in the future would be likely to face prosecution for potentially serious criminal offences. No person should ever give MMS to another person to drink without advising them of what it is they are drinking and of the serious risks to health that may arise if they decide to drink the mixture."<ref>{{Citation |last= Gibson |first= Joel |publication-date= January 9, 2010 |title= Death in paradise |newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issn= 03126315 |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/death-in-paradise-20100108-lyxv.html |accessdate= February 11, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |publication-date= November 10, 2010 |title= Prosecutor decides no charges can be laid in case of death linked to MMS |newspaper= Vanuatu Daily Post |publisher= The Trading Post |url= http://www.dailypost.vu/content/prosecutor-decides-no-charges-can-be-laid-case-death-linked-mms |accessdate= February 11, 2012 }}</ref>

Sellers attribute the vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea to the product working, but it is simply the product's toxicity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://moh.gov.ms/?p=803 |title= Product Warning: Miracle Mineral Solution |publisher= Ministry of Health |location= Montserrat |accessdate= December 9, 2012 }}</ref>

In December 2009, an alert was issued by the Belgian Poison Control Centre to the [[European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists]]. In response, an evaluation was performed by the French "ComitÃ© de coordination de toxicovigilance" in March 2010, warning about a dose dependent irritation and possible toxic effects. They also warned that patients affected by serious diseases could be tempted to stop their treatments in favour of this alternative treatment.<ref>{{Cite news

A similar notice was released in July 2010 by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] warning that the instructions for preparing the solution by mixing it with an acidic solution, or even orange juice, would produce [[chlorine dioxide]], "a potent bleach used for stripping textiles and industrial water treatment." Because of reports including nausea, vomiting, and dangerously [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] as a result of dehydration following instructed use, the FDA has advised consumers to dispose of the product immediately.<ref name="fda.gov" />

MMS is not approved for the treatment of any disease and according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], chronic exposure to small doses of chlorine dioxide could cause reproductive and neurodevelopmental damage.<ref>{{cite web
