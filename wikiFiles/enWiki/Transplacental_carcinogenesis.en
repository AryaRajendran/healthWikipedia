'''[[Transplacental]] carcinogenesis''' is a series of [[genotype|genotypic]] and/or [[phenotype|phenotypic]] changes in the cells of a [[fetus]] due to ''[[in utero]]'' exposure to [[carcinogens]]. Specifically, these changes are identified as malignant by virtue of their [[metastasis|metastatic]] potential.<ref>{{cite book |author=Segen, Joseph |title=Concise dictionary of modern medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2006 |pages= {{page needed|date=March 2011}} |isbn=0-8385-1535-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Transplacental transfer==
The link between a pregnant mother and the fetus is such that “at all sites of direct cell-to-cell contact, maternal tissues ([[decidua]] and [[blood]]) are juxtaposed to extraembryonic cells ([[trophoblast]]).”<ref name=Cunningham>{{cite book |author=Williams, J. G.; Cunningham, F. Gary |title=Williams obstetrics |publisher=Appleton & Lange |location=Norwalk, CT |year=1993 | edition=19th |pages= {{page needed|date=March 2011}} |isbn=0-8385-9634-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> According to Cunningham, "after [[conception (biology)|conception]], a biomolecular communication system is established between the fetus and mother that is operative from before the time of [[nidation]] and continues through and beyond the time of [[parturition]]."<ref name=Cunningham/> This communication system is essential to all facets of the [[pregnancy]]. "[[Physiological]] processes such as fetal nutrition and [[fetal development]] progress directly from [[embryonic]]/fetal tissue-directed modifications of maternal responses."<ref name=Cunningham/>  Notably, the [[placenta]] is the principal site of transfer between mother and fetus. A fetus is exposed via the placenta to all substances which are present in the peripheral [[circulation (physiology)|circulation]] of the mother. Overall, the abundance of [[toxin]]s contained within [[cigarette smoke]] that is inhaled by the mother exerts a direct impact by altering the placental and fetal [[cell proliferation]] and [[cell differentiation|differentiation]]. The vital balance of cellular activity is disrupted. "The association of in utero exposure to such [[carcinogen]]s and the subsequent development of [[cancer]] has been reported for all [[childhood cancer]]s combined and particularly for childhood [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], and brain tumors."<ref>{{cite journal |author=John EM, Savitz DA, Sandler DP |title=Prenatal exposure to parents' smoking and childhood cancer |journal=Am. J. Epidemiol. |volume=133 |issue=2 |pages=123–32 |year=1991 |month=January |pmid=1822074 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Fetal cell sensitivity==
Fetal cells are most sensitive to carcinogens during the early stages of [[gestation]].<ref name=Donovan>{{cite journal |author=Donovan PJ |title=Cell sensitivity to transplacental carcinogenesis by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea is greatest in early post-implantation development |journal=Mutat. Res. |volume=427 |issue=1 |pages=59–63 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10354502 |doi=10.1016/S0027-5107(99)00086-X |url=}}</ref> Notably, early in the gestational period, there is a high rate of [[cell division]]. Additionally, the cells exhibit [[undifferentiated cell|undifferentiated]] characteristics.<ref name=Donovan /> These compounding factors illustrate the basis for this heightened cellular sensitivity to [[genotoxic]] agents. For example, it has been proven that during exposure [[nicotine]] binds to receptors of the fetal cells through which developmentally important signaling occurs in many developing [[organ (biology)|organs]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dwyer JB, Broide RS, Leslie FM |title=Nicotine and brain development |journal=Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=30–44 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18383130 |doi=10.1002/bdrc.20118 |url=}}</ref> Because the binding of these receptors is unanticipated by the regulated activity of the fetal cells it can be inferred that this is a disruption in the cellular process which can lead to detrimental effects such as the deregulation of vital signaling, expression, or repair. As indicated above, should this exposure occur during the early stages of gestation, the fetus will be more susceptible to such damage.  In addition to [[receptor binding]], it has also been proven that fetal tissues are suspected as “privileged targets of [[neoplastic]] changes” in light of the vast amount of [[cell proliferation]] and [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] taking place.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alexandrov V, Aiello C, Rossi L |title=Modifying factors in prenatal carcinogenesis (review) |journal=In Vivo |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=327–35 |year=1990 |pmid=2133106 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Notably, tumors are arrived at via proliferating cells. In the event that proliferating cells become uncontrolled, by any measure, this [[mutation|mutated]] activity would certainly be characteristic of an increased risk in one’s chances of developing [[cancer]].
