'''Fabry disease''' (also known as '''Fabry's disease''', '''Anderson-Fabry disease''', '''[[angiokeratoma]] corporis diffusum''' and '''alpha-galactosidase A deficiency''') is a rare [[X-linked]] (inherited) [[lysosomal storage disease]], which can cause a wide range of systemic symptoms.<ref name="Andrews">{{Cite book|author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |page=538 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> It is a form of [[sphingolipidosis]], as it involves dysfunctional metabolism of [[sphingolipids]]. The disease is named after one of its discoverers, Johannes Fabry (June 1, 1860–June 29, 1930).<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1761}}</ref> 

==Pathophysiology==
A deficiency of the [[enzyme]] [[alpha galactosidase|alpha galactosidase A]] (a-GAL A, encoded by [http://www.genenames.org/data/hgnc_data.php?match=GLA GLA]) due to mutation causes a [[glycolipid]] known as [[globotriaosylceramide]] (abbreviated as Gb3, GL-3, or ceramide trihexoside) to accumulate within the [[blood vessel]]s, other tissues, and organs.<ref name="pmid16403380">{{Cite journal|author=Karen JK, Hale EK, Ma L |title=Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (Fabry disease) |journal=Dermatol. Online J. |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=8 |year=2005 |pmid=16403380 |doi= |url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/114/NYU/NYUtexts/0419054.html}}</ref> This accumulation leads to an impairment of their proper function.

The [[DNA]] mutations which cause the disease are [[X-linked recessive]]. The condition affects [[Zygosity|hemizygous]] males (i.e. all males), as well as [[Zygosity|homozygous]], and in many cases [[Zygosity|heterozygous]] females. While males typically experience severe symptoms, women can range from being asymptomatic to having severe symptoms.  New research suggests that many women suffer with severe symptoms ranging from early cataracts, strokes, to hypertropic left ventricular heart problems and renal failure.  This variability is thought to be due to [[X-inactivation]] patterns during embryonic development of the female.<ref>{{Cite book|author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location=|year=2006 |pages={{Page needed|date=September 2010}} |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Incidence==
The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of Fabry disease is estimated to be between 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 120,000 live births.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2362.2004.01309.x}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
[[File:Morbus Fabry Cornea verticillata 01.jpg|thumb|right|A bilateral, whorl-like corneal pattern of cream colored lines in a patient with Fabry disease.]]
[[File:Angiokreatoma.jpg|thumb|right|Angiokeratoma, a common dermatological manifestation in Fabry sufferers.]]
Symptoms are typically first experienced in early childhood and can be very difficult to understand; the rarity of Fabry disease to many clinicians sometimes leads to misdiagnoses. Manifestations of the disease usually increase in number and severity as an individual ages.

;Pain
Full body or localized pain to the extremities (known as acroparesthesia) or GI tract is common in patients with Fabry disease. Acroparesthesia in Fabry disease is believed to be related to the damage of peripheral nerve fibers that transmit pain. GI tract pain is likely caused by accumulation of lipids in the small vasculature of the GI tract which obstructs blood flow and causes pain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann MD|first=Bjoern|coauthors=Beck, Michael PhD; Sunder-Plassmann, Gere PhD; Borsini, Walter MD; Ricci, Roberta PhD; Mehta, Atul MD|title=Nature and Prevalence of Pain in Fabry Disease and Its Response to Enzyme Replacement Therapy—A Retrospective Analysis From the Fabry Outcome Survey.|journal=The Clinical Journal of Pain|date=July/August 2007|volume=23|issue=6|pages=535–542|doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e318074c986|accessdate=04/06/11}}</ref> 

;Renal involvement:
Kidney complications are a common and serious effect of the disease; [[renal insufficiency]] and [[renal failure]] may worsen throughout life. [[Proteinuria]] (which causes foamy urine) is often the first sign of kidney involvement. End stage renal failure in fabry patients can typically occur in the third decade of life, and is a common cause of death due to the disease.

;Cardiac manifestations:
[[Cardiac]] complications occur when glycolipids build up in different heart cells; heart related effects worsen with age and may lead to increased risk of heart disease. [[Hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and [[cardiomyopathy]] are commonly observed.

;Dermatological manifestations:
[[Angiokeratoma]]s (tiny, painless [[papules]] that can appear on any region of the body, but are predominant on the thighs, around the belly-button, buttocks, lower abdomen, and groin) are a common symptom.

[[Anhidrosis]] (lack of sweating) is a common symptom, and less commonly [[hyperhidrosis]] (excessive sweating).

Additionally, patients can exhibit [[Raynaud's disease]]-like symptoms with [[neuropathy]] (in particular, burning extremity pain).

;Ocular manifestations:
Cosmetic ocular involvement may be present showing cornea verticillata (also known as vortex [[keratopathy]]), i.e. clouding of the corneas. Keratopathy may be the presenting feature in asymptomatic fabry patients, and must be differentiated from other causes of vortex keratopathy (e.g. drug deposition in the cornea). This clouding does not affect vision.

Other ocular findings that can be seen include conjunctival [[aneurysms]], posterior spoke-like [[cataracts]], [[papilloedema]], [[macular edema]], [[optic atrophy]] and retinal vascular dilation.

;Other manifestations;
[[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]], [[neuropathy]] (in particular, burning extremity pain), cerebrovascular effects leading to an increased risk of stroke, [[tinnitus]] (ringing in the ears), [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], nausea, inability to gain weight, chemical imbalances, and diarrhea are other common symptoms.

==Diagnosis==
Fabry disease is indicated when associated symptoms are present, and can be diagnosed by a blood test to measure the level of [[alpha-galactosidase]] activity, however this may be misleading in female patients due to the random nature of [[X-inactivation]]. Chromosomal analysis of the GLA gene is the most accurate method of diagnosis, and many mutations which cause the disease have been noted. Kidney biopsy may also be suggestive of Fabry Disease if excessive lipid buildup is noted. Pediatricians as well as internists commonly misdiagnose Fabry disease.<ref name=Marchesoni>

Naturally, alpha-galactosidase A (a-GAL A) is likely to be present only at very low levels in the blood, particularly in males. In females, owing to [[X-inactivation]] patterns, levels are commonly normal even if the patient is symptomatic. The [[Sifap]] (stroke in young Fabry patients) project will investigate the relation between stroke and Fabry's disease.

==Treatment==
The first treatment for Fabry's disease was approved by FDA on April 24, 2003.  Frabrazyme™ (agalsidase beta) was licensed to the Genzyme Corporation.  It is an [[Enzyme replacement therapy|Enzyme Replacement Therapies (ERTs)]] designed to provide the enzyme that the patient is missing as a result of a genetic malfunction. The drug is expensive.  In 2012, Fabrazyme's annual cost was approximately USD 200,000 per patient, which is unaffordable to many patients around the world without enough insurance. Enzyme replacement therapy is not a cure, but can allow improved metabolism and partially prevent disease progression, as well as potentially reversing some symptoms.

Pain associated with Fabry disease can be partially alleviated by ERT, but pain management regimens may also include [[analgesic]]s, [[anticonvulsant]]s, and [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.

==Prognosis==
The [[life expectancy]] of males with Fabry disease is estimated to be approximately 40 -60 years.<ref>{{cite pmid|19745746}}</ref>Female life expectancy can range from approximately 40-70 years of age.
