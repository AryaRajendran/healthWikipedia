'''HOHMS''' (pronounced "''Homes''") is the medical [[acronym]] for "''H''igher-''O''rder ''H''isto''M''olecular ''S''tratification", a term and concept which was first applied to lung cancer research and treatment theory.

The '''HOHMS Paradigm''' postulates that lung cancer cases can be more effectively treated if different tumors can be rationally classified into more homogeneous groups (or "strata"). These could then be used in randomized clinical trials with maximized potential for detecting significant differences in treatment regimens and other characteristics of the differing variants.

Rational stratification under the HOHMS paradigm uses a combination of [[histology|histological]] criteria and [[molecule|molecular]] characteristics of the tumor.<ref name='Vincent'>{{cite journal |author=Vincent MD |title=Optimizing the management of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a personal view |journal=Curr Oncol |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=9–21 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19672420 |pmc=2722061 |url=http://www.current-oncology.com/index.php/oncology/article/view/465/374; |doi=10.3747/co.v16i4.465}}</ref>

==Origin==
The ''HOHMS'' acronym was first applied to lung cancer and further developed in 2003 by Cliff Knickerbocker, Walton Distinguished Doctoral Fellow at the [[University of Arkansas]].

==Traditional Lung Cancer Treatment Paradigms==
[[Lung cancer]] was considered a very rare disease in the early part of the last century, and all malignant lung tumors were considered equivalent for treatment purposes.<ref name='WatkinGreen'>{{cite journal |author=Watkin SW, Green JA |title=Small cell carcinoma of the bronchus: historical perspective of a treatable disease |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=108–10 |year=1990 |month=February |pmid=2157005 |pmc=1292509 }}</ref> 

In the early 1960s, [[small cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC) was recognized for its unique biological behavior, including a much higher frequency of widespread [[metastasis]] at [[diagnosis]], and a higher frequency of sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.<ref name='WatsonBerg'>{{cite journal |author=Watson WL, Berg JW |title=Oat cell lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=15 |issue= |pages=759–68 |year=1962 |pmid=14005321 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(196207/08)15:4<759::AID-CNCR2820150410>3.0.CO;2-6}}</ref> Early studies suggested that patients with SCLC fared better when treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation than when treated surgically, while [[non-small cell lung carcinoma]] (NSCLC) patients generally did better after surgery, and usually did not respond well to chemoradiation.<ref name='LennoxFlavell'>{{cite journal |author=Lennox SC, Flavell G, Pollock DJ, Thompson VC, Wilkins JL |title=Results of resection for oat-cell carcinoma of the lung |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=7575 |pages=925–7 |year=1968 |month=November |pmid=4176258 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(68)91163-X}}</ref><ref name='FoxScadding'>{{cite journal |author=Fox W, Scadding JG |title=Medical Research Council comparative trial of surgery and radiotherapy for primary treatment of small-celled or oat-celled carcinoma of bronchus.

In the last two decades, however, the development of molecularly targeted agents have led to an increased emphasis on more precise typing and subtyping of lung carcinomas. <ref name="CooperOToole">{{cite journal |author=Cooper WA, O'toole S, Boyer M, Horvath L, Mahar A |title=What's new in non-small cell lung cancer for pathologists: the importance of accurate subtyping, EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements |journal=Pathology |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=103–15 |year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21233671 |doi=10.1097/PAT.0b013e328342629d |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1465-3931&volume=43&issue=2&spage=103}}</ref> Although these new therapies have had little impact on the treatment of SCLC, some very promising results have been obtained in certain histiological types and subtypes of NSCLC's.

==Rationale for The HOHMS Paradigm==
The "HOHMS Paradigm" posits that treatment regimens for lung cancer patients should be based on a high level of histological and molecular stratification to maximize response rates and survival prolongation, and minimize toxicity.

The choice of regimen should be based, insofar as is possible, on the results of large-scale randomized clinical trials. When large-scale trials have not been conducted, meta-analyses of databases of patient series and case reports can be utilized.

Histological stratification should be based on subtypes recognized in the 2004 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) lung tumor typing system.<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92 832 2418 3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf }}</ref><ref name="DaddarioFruh">{{cite journal |author=D'Addario G, Früh M, Reck M, Baumann P, Klepetko W, Felip E |title=Metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up |journal=Ann.
