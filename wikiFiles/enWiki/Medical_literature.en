'''Medical literature''' refers to articles in journals and texts in books devoted to the field of [[medicine]].

Contemporary and historic views regarding diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of medical conditions have been documented for thousands of years. The [[Edwin Smith papyrus]] is the first known medical [[treatise]]. Initially most described inflictions related to warfare. This was because war was the most important part of society and it was the most common way of contracting health problems.

{{main|History of medicine}}
{{see|Al-Tasrif|The Canon of Medicine|Huangdi Neijing}}

Throughout history people have written about diseases, how [[human being]]s might contract them and what could be done to remedy it. Medicine ranged from folklore, witchcraft to the current [[Evidence-based medicine]].<ref>[http://www.st-mike.org/medicine/medicine.html Medicine in Ancient and Medieval Times]</ref><ref>[http://www.indiana.edu/~ancmed/intro.HTM Asclepion, a World Wide Web page devoted to the study of ancient medicine]</ref> Among the most notable descriptions are texts from Egypt ([[Imhotep]], ''[[Edwin Smith Papyrus]]'', ''[[Ebers Papyrus]]'', ''[[Kahun Gynecological Papyrus]]''),<ref>[http://www.indiana.edu/~ancmed/egypt.HTM Medicine in Ancient Egypt]</ref> Mesopotamia (''[[Babylonia#Medicine|Diagnostic Handbook]]'', [[al-Kindi|Alkindus]], ''[[De Gradibus]]''), India ([[Ayurveda]], ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', ''[[Charaka Samhita]]''), China ([[Yellow Emperor]], ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]''), Greece (''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' are the earliest sources of Greek medical practise; [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic medicine]]),<ref>[http://www.indiana.edu/~ancmed/greekmenu.HTM Medicine in Ancient Greece]</ref> Persia ([[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]], [[Avicenna]], ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', ''[[The Book of Healing]]''), Spain ([[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Abulcasis]], ''[[Al-Tasrif|Kitab al-Tasrif]]'') and Syria ([[Ibn al-Nafis]], ''Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon'', ''Comprehensive Book on Medicine'').

Following [[Vesalius]], [[William Harvey]], [[Ignaz Semmelweis]], [[Louis Pasteur]], and others, the medical community have changed the way it conducts [[medical research|research]]. After incorporating the [[scientific method]] medical literature has introduced the so-called [[peer review]], and is currently divided into journals and textbooks.

==Medical journal==

These are publications in which the medical community shares information. The common articles are original articles, reviews and [[case report]]s .
#Original articles describe [[scientific method|methods]], results, discussion and conclusions and a new research that conducted by the authors. Although according to the [[Evidence based medicine]] consensus the [[randomized controlled trials]] are the gold-standard for medical research, currently, they constitute only a minority of conducted research.
#Reviews are an overview of one particular topic of [[Clinical significance|clinical]] interest in order to refresh the readers' memory, to enhance an emergence concept or the summary recent publications that haven't appeared in the textbooks yet. Other type of reviews are the [[systematic reviews]] and the [[meta-analysis]] in which a specific clinical dilemma is answered by collecting and summarizing all published data regarding this question.
#Reports of clinical cases of special interest of rare phenomenon or a new clinical method that was employed while managing the disease. However, currently most of the top-ranked medical literature do not published case reports as not being evidence based medicine. Thus data of rare medical situations, in which large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials can not be conducted, may not be published and data may be lost.<ref name="CaseReport">{{cite journal |author=Yitschaky O, Yitschaky M, Zadik Y |title=Case report on trial: Do you, Doctor, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=179 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21569508 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/pdf/1752-1947-5-179.pdf| format=PDF |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-5-179 |pmc=3113995}}</ref>   

When looking for specific information in any journal one can use the [[National Library of Medicine]]'s [[PubMed]] [[database]]. [[Peer review]]ed [[Medical journal|journals]] are ranked higher thus are a better source for medical information than non-peer reviewed journals. Examples of journals are: 
* The ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''
* ''[[The Lancet]]''
* ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' (''Journal of the American Medical Association'') 
* ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' 
* ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' 
* ''[[BMJ]]'' (''British Medical Journal'')
* ''[[CMAJ]]'' (''Canadian Medical Association Journal'') 
* ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]''

==Medical textbooks==
After [[Consensus (medical)|consensus]] has been reached it is incorporated in [[textbook]]s. There are textbooks on every [[medical specialty]] and they contain comprehensive discussion on all [[diseases]] and their [[diagnosis]], therapy and [[prognosis]]. The first textbook to utilize experts to write specific chapters within the book was the Cecil Textbook of Medicine edited by Russell Cecil, MD in 1927. The book was an immediate international success because of the idea that single or double author medical books was outmoded, "since the scope of medical knowledge was far surpassing the capacity of any single individual to encompass." Since that time, this has been the standard. Examples are:
*''[[Cecil Textbook of Medicine]]''<ref>[http://www.cecilmedicine.com/buy.cfm?book=goldman Cecil Textbook of Medicine]</ref>
*''[[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]]''<ref>[http://books.mcgraw-hill.com/getbook.php?isbn=0071391401 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]</ref>
*The ''[[Oxford Textbook of Medicine]]''<ref>[http://otm.oxfordmedicine.com/ Oxford Textbook of Medicine]</ref>

==Medical journalism==
{{main|Medical journalism}}

Health-related information is often disseminated to the public via mainstream media outlets; these reports influence doctors, the general public, and the government. Most news articles fail to discuss important issues such as evidence quality, costs, and risks versus benefits.<ref name=Schwitzer>{{cite journal |author= Schwitzer G |title= How Do US Journalists Cover Treatments, Tests, Products, and Procedures?

==Internet==
Most prominent journals and textbooks are currently available [[on-line]] or via [[CD-ROM]]. Certain online services including [[Medscape]] and [[MDLinx]] offer aggregated digests of new articles from prominent medical journals.
