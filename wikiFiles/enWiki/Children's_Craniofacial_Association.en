==Children's Craniofacial Association's National Spokesperson is actor, entertainer Cher==
Cher became CCA's National Spokesperson in 1990. In 1985, Cher starred in the movie [[Mask]],a film about the life of Rocky Dennis, who had a rare craniofacial condition called Craniodiaphyseal Dysplasia. Cher attended an event in Washington, DC in September 1990, where families affected by craniofacial conditions testified before the House Budget Committee. During that week, she joined ten families on a visit to the White House hosted by then, First Lady, [[Barbara Bush]]. During her [[Love Hurts]], [[Do You Believe? Tour|Believe]] and [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|Farewell Tour]]s, Cher often invited children with craniofacial conditions back stage to visit.

==Programs and Services==

===Family Networking===
Families who are affected by facial differences feel alone and isolated. CCA puts families in contact with others having similar experiences for the purpose of reciprocal support.

===Annual Cher's Family Retreat===
During a late night visit in Washington, DC  with several craniofacial families Cher suggested an annual meeting be held where families could get together to share information and support.  In 1991, Children's Craniofacial Association held its first Annual Cher's Family Retreat at Disney World in Florida. Since then subsequent retreats have been held each year in various cities across the United States.
