'''Rheumatoid factor''' (RF) is the [[autoantibody]] ([[antibody]] directed against an organism's own tissues) that is most relevant in [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name="urlRheumatoid Arthritis Symptoms">{{cite web |url=http://www.arthritissymptomse.com/rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms.html |title=Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptoms |work= |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> It is defined as an [[antibody]] against the Fc portion of [[IgG]]. RF and IgG join to form [[immune complex]]es that contribute to the [[disease]] process.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Rheumatoid factor can also be a [[cryoglobulin]] (antibody that precipitates on cooling of a blood sample); it can be either type 2 (monoclonal [[IgM]] to polyclonal IgG) or type 3 (polyclonal IgM to polyclonal IgG) [[cryoglobulin]].

Rheumatoid factor can be of any [[isotype (immunology)|isotype]] of [[immunoglobulins]], i.e. IgA, IgG, IgM,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3775335 |year=1986 |last1=Hermann |first1=E |last2=Vogt |first2=P |last3=Müller |first3=W |title=Rheumatoid factors of immunoglobulin classes IgA, IgG and IgM: Methods of determination and clinical value |volume=116 |issue=38 |pages=1290–7 |journal=Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift}}</ref> IgE,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1669588 |year=1991 |last1=Herrmann |first1=D |last2=Jäger |first2=L |last3=Hein |first3=G |last4=Henzgen |first4=M |last5=Schlenvoigt |first5=G |title=IgE rheumatoid factor.

==Testing==
RF is often evaluated in patients suspected of having any form of [[arthritis]] even though positive results can be due to other causes, and negative results do not rule out disease. But, in combination with signs and [[symptom]]s, it can play a role in both diagnosis and disease [[prognosis]]. It is part of the usual disease criteria of [[rheumatoid]] arthritis.

The presence of rheumatoid factor in serum can also indicate the occurrence of suspected autoimmune activity unrelated to rheumatoid arthritis, such as that associated with tissue or organ rejection. In such instances, RF may serve as one of several [[serology|serological]] markers for autoimmunity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000013304 |title=Serological Markers of Autoimmunity in Renal Transplant Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C |year=1998 |last1=Rostaing |first1=Lionel |last2=Modesto |first2=Anne |last3=Cisterne |first3=Jean Marc |last4=Izopet |first4=Jacques |last5=Oksman |first5=Françoise |last6=Duffaut |first6=Michel |last7=Abbal |first7=Michel |last8=Durand |first8=Dominique |journal=American Journal of Nephrology |volume=18 |pages=50–6 |pmid=9481439 |issue=1}}</ref>

==Interpretation==
High levels of rheumatoid factor (in general, above 20 IU/mL, 1:40, or over the 95th [[percentile]]; there is some variation among labs) occur in rheumatoid arthritis (present in 80%) and [[Sjögren's syndrome]] (present in 70%).<ref name=sd49>[http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40026049/ Rheumatoid Factor - Patient UK]</ref> The higher the level of RF the greater the probability of destructive articular disease.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} It is also found in [[Epstein-Barr virus]] or [[Parvovirus]] infection and in 5-10% of healthy persons, especially the elderly. 

There is an association between rheumatoid factor and more persistently active synovitis, more joint damage and greater eventual disability.<ref>http://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_factor/article.htm{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref>

Rheumatoid factor may also be elevated in: chronic [[hepatitis]], [[primary biliary cirrhosis]], any chronic viral infection, [[bacterial endocarditis]], [[leukemia]], [[dermatomyositis]], [[infectious mononucleosis]], [[systemic sclerosis]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==History==
The test was first described by Norwegian Dr [[Erik Waaler]] in 1940 and redescribed by Dr H.M. Rose and colleagues in 1948. Redescription is said to be due to the uncertainties due to World War II. It is still referred to as the Waaler-Rose test.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1699-0463.1940.tb01475.x |title=On the Occurrence of a Factor in Human Serum Activating the Specific Agglutination of Sheep Blood Corpuscles |year=2009 |last1=Waaler |first1=Erik |journal=Acta Pathologica Microbiologica Scandinavica |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=172}} reproduced in {{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0463.2007.apm_682a.x |title=On the Occurrence of a Factor in Human Serum Activating the Specific Agglutintion of Sheep Blood Corpuscles |year=2007 |journal=APMIS |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=422–38; discussion 439 |pmid=17504400 |last1=Waaler |first1=E}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18863659 |year=1948 |last1=Rose |first1=HM |last2=Ragan |first2=C |title=Differential agglutination of normal and sensitized sheep erythrocytes by sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |journal=Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine}}</ref>
