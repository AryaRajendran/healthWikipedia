The '''Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust''' (GWAS) was a UK [[National Health Service]] (NHS) trust providing emergency and nonemergency patient transport services to [[Bath and North East Somerset]], [[Bristol]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[North Somerset]], [[Swindon (borough)|Swindon]] and [[Wiltshire]] in the [[South West England]] region. It was formed on 1 April 2006, from the merger of the [[Avon (county)|Avon]], Gloucestershire and Wiltshire ambulance services. The ambulance service was acquired by neighbouring Foundation Trust [[South Western Ambulance Service]] (SWASFT) on 1 February 2013.

It was one of twelve [[Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom|Ambulance Trusts]] providing England with free [[Emergency medical service]]s, and is part of the [[National Health Service]], receiving government funding for its role.

==Operations==

The Trust headquarters was at Jenner House, [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]].

The Trust had one main call handling control room ("EOC&nbsp;— Emergency Operations Centre") and two "dispatch centres".  The main control room, the EOC at Acuma House, [[Almondsbury]], was been recognised as a Centre of Excellence for emergency call handling and dispatch for 2006, 2007 and 2008 by the company that supplies their computer software.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust|url=http://www.naemd.org/AccredCurrentAcesDetail/?id=99708&a=accAceEMD|publisher=National Academies of Emergency Dispatch|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>

The EOC in [[Quedgeley]], Gloucestershire, was also the hub for the Gloucestershire out-of-hours "urgent care" service. The [[emergency control centre]] for Wiltshire is located in the [[Wiltshire Emergency Services#WES Building|WES building]] in [[Devizes]], as the Great Western Ambulance Service in Wiltshire is part of [[Wiltshire Emergency Services]] project.

In common with all UK ambulance services, the control room [[triage]]s and categorises 999 calls into three categories&nbsp;— A, B, and C. Category A are potentially life-threatening emergencies requiring an immediate response. Category B are potentially serious but not life-threatening emergencies. Category C require do not require an emergency response and are relayed to [[NHS Direct]], specially trained paramedics or nurses for over-the-phone advice, GP services or Emergency Care Practitioners(ECP).

Below are the performance targets the government has set out of ambulance trusts to meet.

* to reach 75% of immediately life-threatening emergencies (category A) within 8 minutes
* to reach 95% of non-life-threatening emergencies (category B) within 19 minutes

* where a doctor requests an ambulance for a patient under the Doctors' Urgent Standard, to deliver 95% of patients within 1, 2 or 4 hour targets, as requested by the health care professional.

==History==

Formed on 1 April 2006, from the merger of the [[Avon (county)|Avon]], Gloucestershire and Wiltshire ambulance services, the trust had a difficult start, marked by redundancies, closure of its training centre and the threat of [[ambulance station]] closures, though in the end, only one ambulance station was closed (Newent, Gloucestershire).

This caused strained industrial relations <ref>{{cite news|last=Burchall|first=Kevin|title=Ambulance staff poised to strike|url=http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/news/1080926.ambulance_staff_poised_to_strike/|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=This is Wiltshire|date=19 December 2006}}</ref> with its recognised union, UNISON, and attacks from the local media.  From the date of merger, Great Western Ambulance Service struggled to achieve the Department of Health Key Performance Indicators and in 2007-2008 the  Trust lost two contracts for non-emergency Patient Transport Services (PTS) to private contractors.  Huge numbers of ambulance shifts were covered by private agencies.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/4739836/NHS-bosses-send-ill-trained-private-ambulance-crews-to-999-calls.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=NHS bosses send 'ill-trained' private ambulance crews to 999 calls | first=Laura | last=Donnelly | date=21 February 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

In September 2008, the Chief Executive, Tim Lynch resigned.  He was replaced by an Interim Chief Executive, Anthony Marsh, from West Midlands Ambulance Service. Marsh identified a lack of operational leadership and a "competition of priorities" within management and removed two Directors (the Director of Operations and Director of Corporate Development).<ref>{{cite news|title=Fear as 999 chief takes two jobs|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/latest/2008/09/04/fear-as-999-chief-takes-two-jobs/|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=Express & Star|date=4 September 2008}}</ref>

In February 2009, a ceremony was held to present almost 60 staff, partner agencies and members of the public with Chief Executive Commendations.

In September 2010 a specialist unit, the [[Hazardous Area Response Team]], was established and went live after months of preparation and training.  This unit consisting of 32 paramedics is trained to respond to complex or large incidents involving fire, chemicals, biological or nuclear risks, collapsed buildings, cliff or heights, confined spaces, water or firearms incidents.  The GWAS unit was planned to be one of the last parts of the national scheme to be established, but has already had national acclaim with high levels of activity and a dedicated base being built in Filton, North Bristol.

In summer of 2010, the regional NHS announced that after a tough competitive tenering process, GWAS had secured the major patinet transport service contract for the former Avon area, representing an estimated three-quarters of non-emergency patient journeys in the region.  The new revamped service, operating 24/7, went live on 1 October 2010.

In 2010 the trust board recommended the closure of at least one county's control room, and gave the go ahead to an "Estates Review" to prepare the trust for closure of local ambulance stations.

In 2009, the new chief executive, David Whiting, previously director of operations from [[East Midlands Ambulance Service]], was appointed as Chief Executive.  He announced his resignation in November 2010,<ref>{{cite news|title=Ambulance boss quits top position|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Ambulance-boss-quits-position/story-11311040-detail/story.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=This is Bristol|date=5 November 2010}}</ref> having served just nineteen months, a situation the union described as "difficult".<ref>{{cite news|title=Union worry at ambulance chief's move|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Union-worry-ambulance-chief-s/story-11280009-detail/story.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=This is Bristol|date=8 November 2010}}</ref>   The resignation came at the height of an industrial dispute as the trust attempted to adjust rota patterns, rest break configutarions and staff shift times, which caused staff to be concerned about safety and welfare of patients and colleagues.<ref>{{cite news|title=Risk of action over change to 999 rotas|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Risk-action-change-999-rotas/article-2830744-detail/article.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=This is Bristol|date=3 November 2010}}</ref>

In December 2010, the Trust announced another interim Chief Executive, Martin Flaherty of the [[London Ambulance Service]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New ambulance boss appointed|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/New-ambulance-boss-appointed/story-11325456-detail/story.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=This is Bath|date=17 December 2010}}</ref>  When Mr Flaherty leaves, and his replacement appointed, it will be the 5th Chief Executive in only 3 years.

At the beginning of January 2011, [[UNISON]] (the only approved union within GWAS until January, when the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] was 'suddenly' accepted) announced the results of a ballot for industrial action. From those that voted, the result was 96% in favour of taking industrial action as a form of protest against the changes implemented during 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ambulance staff vote for industrial action|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Ambulance-staff-vote-industrial-action/story-11257942-detail/story.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=This is Bristol|date=7 January 2011}}</ref>

Later in 2011 plans were revealed for the merger of the Great Western Ambulance Service with [[South Western Ambulance Service]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Glaister|first=Dan|title=Why South Western ambulance may rescue Great Western|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/healthcare-network/2011/nov/16/south-western-ambulance-rescue-great-western?newsfeed=true|accessdate=16 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ambulance trusts to merge in South West|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-15308309|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref>

==Wiltshire Emergency Services==

{{main|Wiltshire Emergency Services}}

Great Western Ambulance Service's Wiltshire branch is a member of the Wiltshire Emergency Services (WES) project, a collaboration of emergency services in Wiltshire. The project has seen the construction of the WES building at [[Wiltshire Police]] Headquarters and the relocation of all three emergency services control centres into that one [[emergency control centre]] where information is shared instantly between the three. The project has overseen the sharing of stations at [[Bradford-on-Avon]] and [[Mere, Wiltshire|Mere]], and also the sharing of [[Wiltshire Air Ambulance]] and the training of Fire and Rescue crews to use [[defibrillators]] on occasions when the ambulance service is busy.

GWAS is also supported in Wiltshire by a group of volunteer doctors ('SWIFT Medics') who respond from home, in their own time, to incidents involving seriously sick or injured parients throughout the county. The doctors involved are all either senior [[General practitioner|GPs]] or hospital clinicians, who provide their time and expertise for free. The specially trained prehospital care doctors are able to supplement the skills of paramedics and other ambulance staff (for example with advanced decision making, administration of strong painkilling drugs, prehospital anaesthesia and certain surgical procedures normally carried out in hospital). The prehospital care doctor team receive no funding from either the government or GWAS, and rely entirely on charitable donations and fundraising to pay for their drugs, kit and training. All the doctors use their own cars and are permitted to respond with blue lights and sirens (having undergone an intensive three week police driver training course with Wiltshire Police). The team work closely with the Wiltshire Air Ambulance and the GWAS Air Ambulance. Currently SWIFT doctors are tasked to a job either by the Emergency Operations Centre in Devizes or following a direct request from ambulance personnel at the scene of a serious incident.<ref>{{cite web|title=About SWIFT Medics|url=http://www.swiftmedics.net/about|publisher=SWIFT Medics|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>

GWAS has three air support units. The [[West Midlands Ambulance Service]] provides the County Air Ambulance which operates from [[Strensham services|Strensham]] and covers GWAS northern areas.  It is crewed by two air ambulance paramedics. The Wiltshire Air Ambulance operates 24/7 from the police HQ at Devizes and is crewed by an air ambulance paramedic.

The Great Western Air Ambulance is based at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton Airfield, Bristol]] and operates 7 days a week during daylight hours.  The helicopter is crewed by a specially trained Critical Care Paramedic and a senior Doctor trained in prehospital medicine. The helicopter covers the entire GWAS area and, if requested, will fly outside the GWAS boundary to assist other ambulance services. Although GWAS pay for the paramedics, vehicles, training and some equipment, the doctors all work on a voluntary basis and give their time for free.

The helicopters and their associated running costs are paid for entirely by charitable donations, receiving no funding from either government or the ambulance service. The units can be tasked to an incident either by proactive dispatch from ambulance control or by a direct request from an ambulance crew on the ground.
