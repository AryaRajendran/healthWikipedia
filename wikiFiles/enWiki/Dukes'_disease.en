'''Dukes' disease''' or '''fourth disease''' is an [[exanthem]].

It is named after [[Clement Dukes]]<ref>C. Dukes: On the confusion of two different diseases under the name of rubella (rose-rash). Lancet, London, 1900, 2: 89-94.</ref> and is also known as '''Filatov’s disease''' (after [[Nil Filatov]])<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1434|Dukes-Filatov disease}}</ref>

Some of these eruptions are characteristic of the causative virus, but in most cases one must be satisfied with the diagnosis of [[viral rash]]. 

It was never associated with a specific pathogen,<ref name="pmid1951267">{{cite journal |author=Morens DM, Katz AR |title=The "fourth disease" of childhood: reevaluation of a nonexistent disease |journal=Am. J. Epidemiol. |volume=134 |issue=6 |pages=628–40 |year=1991 |month=September |pmid=1951267 |doi= |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1951267}}</ref> and the terms "fourth disease" and "Dukes' disease" are rarely used today.

In 1979 Keith Powell proposed equating it with the condition currently known as [[Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]].<ref name="pmid11214144">{{cite journal |author=Weisse ME |title=The fourth disease, 1900-2000 |journal=Lancet |volume=357 |issue=9252 |pages=299–301 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11214144 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03623-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(00)03623-0}}</ref><ref name="pmid367152">{{cite journal |author=Powell KR |title=Filatow-Dukes' disease.

==Presentation==
Signs and symptoms may include [[fever]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]], along with typical viral symptoms of [[photophobia]], [[lymphadenopathy]], [[sore throat]], and possibly [[encephalitis]]. The rash may appear at any time during the illness. It is usually generalised. The rash consists of [[erythematous]] [[maculopapules]] with areas of [[Confluency|confluence]]. They may be [[urticarial]], [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicular]], or sometimes [[petechial]]. The palms and soles may be involved. The eruptions are more common in children than in adults. Usually, the [[rash]] fades without [[pigmentation]] or scaling.
