'''Dance and health''' has been subject of a number of research studies which show [[dance]] to be a very healthy [[exercise]]. However there are a number of [[health risks of professional dance]] which require careful attention. As part of [[courtship]] dance is a reliable indicator of the dancer's health and intelligence.

==Benefits of dance==

Being in general an [[aerobic exercise]], dance brings well known benefits, such as reducing the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], [[weight control]] and other ones commonly associated with [[physical fitness]]. In addition, a considerable effect of dancing on psychological well-being is noted.

[[Dance pad]]s have proven useful in tackling [[obesity]] in young people and are welcomed in many schools for that reason.<ref>[http://seriousgamessource.com/features/feature_051906.php Games on Deck] Games For Health 2006: Dance Dance… Revolution in Fitness!</ref>

A report by Professor Tim Watson and Dr Andrew Garrett of University of Hertfordshire compared members of the Royal Ballet with a squad of British national and international swimmers. The dancers scored higher than the swimmers in seven out of ten areas of fitness.<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5007974.ece The Times: Breakthroughs, tips and trends: October 25th Stronger swan</ref>

An Italian study in 2006 has shown that dance is a very good exercise for heart patients compared to other [[aerobic exercise]]s like [[cycling]]. This may be partly because the patients enjoyed it much more.<ref>[http://www.heart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3043386 America Heart Association] Heart failure patients can waltz their way to healthier hearts</ref><ref>[http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/UVAHealth/news_heartcare/0702hc.cfm Heart Care -February 2007] Waltzing Your Way to a Stronger Heart</ref>

A study in New York in 2003 has shown that cognitive activities like [[crossword]]s help ward off [[dementia]] but, except for [[Ballroom dance|ballroom dancing]], most physical activities do not.<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/348/25/2508 Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly] Joe Verghese, M.D., Richard B.

A recent study done in Perth Western Australia by Debbie Duignan (WA Alzheimers Association) explored the use of Wu Tao Dance as a therapy for people with dementia.  It was shown that Wu Tao, dance therapy that works to balance energy in the body, similar to [[T'ai chi]], helped to reduce symptoms of agitation in people with dementia.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/specialists/older-people/exploring-dance-as-a-therapy-for-symptoms-and-social-interaction-in-a-dementia-care-unit/5004646.article |title=Exploring dance as a therapy for symptoms and social interaction in a dementia care unit |date=30 July 2009 |publisher=nursingtimes.net}}</ref>

A study at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] School of Medicine in 2007 showed [[Argentine tango]] was better at improving the mobility of [[Parkinson's disease]] sufferers than an exercise class<ref>A study on the effects of Argentine tango as a form  of partnered dance for those with Parkinson disease and healthy elderly.Hackney, M., Kantorovich S., Earhart, G.M. 2007, J Neurol Phys Ther, 31(4): 173-179</ref> (a later study showed similar benefits from T'ai chi). Because of the level of interest a permanent tango class was set up after the study ended.

A study by Dr Paul Dougall at [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde University]] in 2010 concentrating on older women found that [[Scottish country dance]]rs were more agile, have stronger legs and can walk more briskly than people of the same age who took part in exercises such as swimming, walking, golf and keep-fit classes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.strath.ac.uk/press/newsreleases/headline_314698_en.html |title=Dancers reel their way to fitness

== Risks of dance ==
{{Main|Health risks of professional dance}}

There are various [[health risks of professional dance]], as it can be very demanding. As well as [[sports injuries]], [[repetitive strain injury]], and chronic [[workplace stress]], dancers have a higher than average risk of [[body image]] problems and [[eating disorders]].<ref>

==Avoiding injury==
Even for social dance the use of a [[sprung floor]] is highly recommended.<ref name="Harkness Centre for Dance Injuries">[http://www.med.nyu.edu/hjd/harkness/patients/injuries/ Harkness Centre for Dance Injuries] Common Dance Injuries</ref> Because a dance injury can ruin a career professional dancers are increasingly refusing to dance on anything else.

In [[ballet]] good [[Glossary of ballet#Plié|plie]]ing (bending the knees) on landing helps protect against [[knee]] injuries and [[shin splint]]s. Many types of dance, especially [[folk dances]], have hops in the steps where the impact of landing can be reduced by slightly bending the knee.

[[Warming up]] and [[cooling down]] exercises are recommended before and after exercises to avoid strain, muscle pains, and possible injury.<ref>Adapted Physical Education and Sport By Joseph P. Winnick

==Treatment after injury==
{{main|Sports injury}}
[[RICE (medicine)|RICE]] (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) is generally regarded as a good first aid therapy for most dance injuries before the ambulance comes, or even for what may be thought of as more minor injuries.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1083/is_4_79/ai_n13493419 Dance Magazine April, 2005 by Linda Hamilton] Ouch! Five common dance injuries & how to treat them</ref> For minor injuries light exercises should be started after two days, if it is not definitely on the mend by this time then see a doctor.<ref>[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=438 NHS Direct] Sports Injuries</ref> Pain and inflammation can be reduced using a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) in a gel applied to the affected area (not on broken skin), note however that masking a pain to continue dancing is dangerous as it can easily make an injury very much worse.<ref name="Harkness Centre for Dance Injuries"/>

== Dance and courtship ==
Dance has long been recognised as a way for prospective partners to [[selection|select]] each other. [[Isadora Duncan]] said of dance that it needed 'the highest intelligence in the freest body'. Recent studies show how much can be conveyed by dance:

An article in Nature 'Dance reveals symmetry especially in young men'
shows that dance in Jamaica seems to show evidence of sexual selection and to reveal important information about the dancer.<ref>http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/dance-symmetry/ Dance Symmetry Project</ref><ref>[http://anthro.rutgers.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=166 Dance reveals symmetry especially in young men.] Brown, William M., Lee Cronk, Amy Jacobson, Keith Grochow, C. Karen Liu, Zoran Popovic, and Robert Trivers. 2005.
Nature 438: 1148-1150</ref> Professor Lee Cronk at Rutgers says: "More symmetrical men put on a better show, and women notice." Symmetry is a strong indicator of fitness as it shows developmental stability.

A Swedish study shows that people who score high on intelligence tests are also good at keeping time.<ref>[http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&a=54768&l=en&newsdep=130 Intelligence and rhythmic accuracy go hand in hand]</ref><ref>Fredrik Ullén, Lea Forsman, Örjan Blom, Anke Karabanov och Guy Madison. Intelligence and variability in a simple timing task share neural substrates in the prefrontal white matter. The Journal of Neuroscience, 16 April 2008</ref>

== Scientific study of dance ==
[[Dance science]] is the scientific study of dance and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of performance, the reduction of injury, and the improvement of well-being and health.

Dance requires a high degree of interpersonal and motor skills, and yet seems built into humans. It has therefore increasing become the subject of [[neuroscience|neurological]] studies. The July 2008 edition of Scientific American contains a summary of recent studies and further questions.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-neuroscience-of-dance] So You Think You Can Dance?: PET Scans Reveal Your Brain's Inner Choreography.

Many professionals specialize in dancer's health such as in providing complementary or remedial training or improving mental discipline.<ref>[http://www.londondance.com/content.asp?CategoryID=510] Londondance.com: Dancers Health</ref>
Mental discipline is achieved from dancing when you are learning a dance or choreographing a dance. And also when you need to recall a dance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Dance and health promotion==
There is a large amount of governmental, health and educational information available extolling the benefits of dance for health.<ref>[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/documents/publications/phpN0GNFD.pdf] Dance and health: The benefits for people of all ages.

==Tangolates==
{{main|Tangolates}}
'''Tangolates''' (a portmanteau word of ''Tango'' and ''Pilates''), also known as '''Tango-Pilates''' and '''Pilates-Tango''', is a method of conscious, mind-body exercises that combines the core stability of [[Pilates]] with the concentration, coordination and fluid movement of [[Tango (dance)|Tango]], designed in 2004 by [[Tamara Di Tella]]. Utilizing a partner-method and incorporating the aerobic or cardio element of music, it started as a rehabilitation technique for patients with severe dysfunctions of the [[nervous system]], and is now a fashionable workout for healthy people.
