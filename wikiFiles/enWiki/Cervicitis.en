'''Cervicitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[uterine cervix]]. Cervicitis in women has many features in common with [[urethritis]] in men and many cases are caused by [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.<ref name="Workowski2006">{{cite journal |author=Workowski KA, Berman SM |title=Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2006 |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=55 |issue=RR–11 |pages=1–94 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16888612 |doi= |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5511a1.htm}}</ref><ref name="POC-IT">{{cite web |author=Hynes NA | url=http://hopkins-abxguide.org/diagnosis/gynecologic/cervicitis.html?contentInstanceId=255497 |title=hopkins-abxguide.org |format= |work=Point-of-care Information Technology | publisher=Johns Hopkins University |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2010-02-03}}</ref> Non-infectious causes of cervicitis can include [[intrauterine device]]s, [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|contraceptive diaphragms]], and [[Allergy|allergic]] reactions to [[spermicide]]s or [[latex]] [[condom]]s.<ref name="NIH">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001495|Cervicitis}}</ref>

== Causes ==

Cervicitis can be caused by any of a number of infections, of which the most common are [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]], with chlamydia accounting for approximately 40% of cases.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins basic pathology |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |year=2007 |edition=8th | pages=716–8 |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 }}</ref> ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' and [[herpes simplex]] are less common causes of cervicitis.

== Mucopurulent cervicitis ==

Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) is characterized by a [[purulent]] or [[mucopurulent]] [[endocervical]] [[exudate]] visible in the [[endocervical canal]] or in an endocervical swab specimen. Some specialists also diagnose MPC on the basis of easily induced cervical bleeding. Although some specialists consider an increased number of polymorphonuclear [[white blood cell]]s  on endocervical [[Gram stain]] as being useful in the diagnosis of MPC, this criterion has not been standardized, has a low positive-predictive value (PPV), and is not available in some settings.{cn} MPC often is without symptoms, but some women have an abnormal vaginal discharge and vaginal bleeding (e.g., after [[sexual intercourse]]). MPC can be caused by ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' or ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''; however, in most cases neither organism can be isolated.<ref name="POC-IT"/> MPC can persist despite repeated courses of antimicrobial therapy. Because relapse or reinfection with ''C. trachomatis'' or ''N. gonorrhoeae'' usually does not occur in persons with persistent cases of MPC, other non-microbiologic determinants (e.g., inflammation in the zone of ectopy) might be involved.

Patients who have MPC should be tested for ''C. trachomatis'' and for ''N. gonorrhoeae'' with the most sensitive and specific test available. However, MPC is not a sensitive predictor of infection with these organisms; most women who have ''C. trachomatis'' or ''N. gonorrhoeae'' do not have MPC.
