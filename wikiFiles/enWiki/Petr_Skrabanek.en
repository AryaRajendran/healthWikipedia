'''Petr Skrabanek''' (October 27, 1940 - June 21, 1994) was a leading doctor and professor of medicine. Author of several books and numerous articles, he was considered a leading scientist. At the time of his death [[The Times]] explained, "From his base at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] a stream of scientific papers and articles exposed the claims of public health doctors, epidemiologists, dietary evangelists and others that many diseases were preventable. This was not a popular message and he evoked strong antipathy in certain circles which was more than offset by the respect of his many admirers around the world."<ref>[[The Times]], Monday, June 27 1994</ref>

==Life==
Born October 27, 1940 in [[Náchod]], [[Czech Republic]], he studied chemistry entering [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]] in 1957. Following his studies he was a researcher at the [[Institute for Toxicology and Forensic Medicine]] in Prague graduating in 1962. He then became the head of the Toxicology Department in the Institute for Forensic Medicine, [[Masaryk University|Purkyně University]] in [[Brno]].

In 1963 he studied medicine at [[Masaryk University|Purkyně University]] and in 1967 was selected to spend a month in Galway Regional Hospital. He returned to Ireland with his wife Vera in July 1968. Soon after, he was admitted to the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] to finish his medical studies qualifying for practice in 1970. For the next four years he worked in neurology in various [[Dublin]] hospitals. He left this post in 1975 to join the Endocrine Oncology Research team in the [[Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin|Mater Hospital]] as a Senior Research Fellow and became involved in research into the neurotransmitter [[substance P]].

In 1984, he joined the Department of Community Health in [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] with a grant from the [[Wellcome Foundation]]. From this position he "immediately began to establish his position as an original, cogent, and fearless critic, particularly in relation to preventive medicine."<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Community_Health/Skrabanek/Petr%20Skrabanek's%20Life.html}}{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> With the rise of his celebrity, he was "rapidly promoted from lecturer to senior lecturer and finally to associate professor." Before he died, he became a Fellow of Trinity College and a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in [[Ireland]].

==Work==
The ''[[Irish Medical Times]]'' wrote, "His several hundred publications demonstrated his breadth of scholarship and ability to communicate .with learned and popular publications in a number of languages... As a teacher Professor Skrabanek is irreplaceable."<ref>Tom O'Dowd, Irish Medical Times, July 1, 1994 </ref> On his work the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' stated "With the spirit of European iconoclasm he kept the medical evangelists in their hot boxes... He was a good scientist, as his work on substance P testifies, but this was not to be his métier. Rather he chose to take the broader intellectual view of a profession in disarray, a profession in need of careful watching."<ref>Eoin O'Brien, ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', Vol. 309, 16 July 1994 </ref>
