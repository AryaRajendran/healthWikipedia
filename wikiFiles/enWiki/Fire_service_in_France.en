The '''fire service in [[France]]''' is known as '''''Sapeurs-pompiers''''', except in Marseille, where naval [[Marseille Marine Fire Battalion|"sailor-firefighters", ''marins-pompiers'']], provide fire and rescue services. 

There are two categories:
*The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] (Army) and [[Marseille Naval Fire Battalion]] (Navy) are military units providing fire protection to Paris and Marseille.
*The rest of France has civilian fire services organized, supervised and trained by the French [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]; specifically, they fall under the [[Civil defense|Civil Defence]] and Security Directorate (''Direction des défense et sécurité civiles'', DDSC).

There are approximately 250,584 fire service personnel in France operating 15,000 emergency vehicles out of 10,238 emergency centres.

''Pompier'' (firefighter) etymologically comes from the concept of pumping (water) and refers to the manual pumps that were originally used. ''Sapeur'' means "[[sapper]]" and refers to the first official firefighting unit created by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] which was part of the military engineering arm.
