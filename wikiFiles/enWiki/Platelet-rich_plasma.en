'''Platelet-rich plasma''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''PRP''') is [[blood plasma]] that has been enriched with [[platelet]]s. As a concentrated source of [[Autotransplantation#Autologous_blood_donation|autologous]] platelets, PRP contains (and releases through [[degranulation]]) several different [[growth factor]]s  and other [[cytokine]]s that stimulate healing of bone and [[soft tissue]].

==Components==
The efficacy of certain growth factors in healing various injuries and the concentrations of these growth factors found within PRP are the theoretical basis for the use of PRP in tissue repair.<ref name=Borrione2010>{{cite journal|author=Borrione P, Gianfrancesco AD, Pereira MT, Pigozzi F|title=Platelet-rich plasma in muscle healing|journal=Am J Phys Med Rehabil|volume=89|issue=10|pages=854–61|year=2010|pmid=20855985|doi=10.1097/PHM.0b013e3181f1c1c7|url=}}</ref> The platelets collected in PRP are activated by the addition of [[thrombin]] and [[calcium chloride]], which induces the release of these factors from [[Platelet alpha-granule|alpha granules]]. The growth factors and other cytokines present in PRP include:<ref name=Borrione2010/><ref name=Yu2011/>
* [[platelet-derived growth factor]]
* [[transforming growth factor beta]]
* [[fibroblast growth factor]]
* [[insulin-like growth factor 1]]

* [[vascular endothelial growth factor]]
* [[epidermal growth factor]]
* [[Interleukin 8]]

There are, at present, two methods of PRP preparation approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]].<ref name=Arora2009>{{cite journal|author=Arora NS, Ramanayake T, Ren YF, Romanos GE|title=Platelet-rich plasma: a literature review|journal=Implant Dent|volume=18|issue=4|pages=303–10|year=2009|pmid=19667818|doi=10.1097/ID.0b013e31819e8ec6|url=}}</ref> Both processes involve the collection of [[whole blood]] (that is [[anticoagulant|anticoagulated]] with [[Acid-citrate-dextrose|citrate dextrose]]) before undergoing two stages of [[centrifugation]] designed to separate the PRP aliquot from [[platelet-poor plasma]] and [[red blood cell]]s.<ref name=Arora2009/> In humans, the typical baseline blood platelet count is approximately 200,000 per [[litre|µL]]; therapeutic PRP concentrates the platelets by roughly five-fold.<ref name=Marx2004/> There is however broad variability in the production of PRP by various concentrating equipment and techniques.<ref name=Ehrenfest2009>{{cite journal|author=Dohan Ehrenfest DM, Rasmusson L, Albrektsson T|title=Classification of platelet concentrates: from pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) to leucocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF)|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=27|issue=3|pages=158–67|year=2009|pmid=19187989|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.11.009|url=}}</ref><ref name=Gonshor2002>{{cite journal|author=Gonshor A|title=Technique for producing platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate: background and process|journal=The International Journal of Periodontics & Restorative Dentistry|volume=22|issue=6|pages=547–57|year=2002|pmid=12516826|doi=|url=}}</ref><ref name=Weibrich2003>{{cite journal|author=Weibrich G, Kleis WK, Hafner G, Hitzler WE, Wagner W|title=Comparison of platelet, leukocyte, and growth factor levels in point-of-care platelet-enriched plasma, prepared using a modified Curasan kit, with preparations received from a local blood bank|journal=Clinical Oral Implants Research|volume=14|issue=3|pages=357–62|year=2003|pmid=12755786|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0501.2003.00810.x|url=}}</ref>

==Clinical validity==
The use and clinical validation of PRP is still in the early stages. Results of basic science and [[Pre-clinical development|preclinical trials]] have not yet been confirmed in large-scale [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled]] [[clinical trial]]s. For example, clinical use of PRP for nerve injury and sports medicine has produced "promising" but "inconsistent" results in early trials.<ref name=Yu2011/><ref name=Foster2009/> A 2009 [[systematic review]] of the scientific literature stated that there are few [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled]] [[clinical trial]]s that have adequately evaluated the safety and efficacy of PRP treatments and concluded that PRP is "a promising, but not proven, treatment option for joint, tendon, ligament, and muscle injuries".<ref name=Foster2009>{{cite journal|author=Foster TE, Puskas BL, Mandelbaum BR, Gerhardt MB, Rodeo SA|title=Platelet-rich plasma: from basic science to clinical applications|journal=Am J Sports Med|volume=37|issue=11|pages=2259–72|year=2009|pmid=19875361|doi=10.1177/0363546509349921|url=}}</ref>

Proponents of PRP therapy argue that negative clinical results are associated with poor quality PRP produced by inadequate devices. The fact that most gathering devices capture a percentage of a given thrombocyte count is a bias, since there is significant inter-individual variability in the platelet concentration of human plasma. More is not necessarily better in this case.<ref name=Marx2004>{{cite journal|author=Marx RE|title=Platelet-rich plasma: evidence to support its use|journal=Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|volume=62|issue=4|pages=489–96|year=2004|pmid=15085519|doi=10.1016/j.joms.2003.12.003|url=http://www.falloplastica.net/fp/pdf/prp05.pdf}}</ref> The variability in platelet concentrating techniques may alter platelet degranulation characteristics that could affect clinical outcomes.<ref name=Yu2011/>

==Implications for doping==
Some concern exists as to whether PRP treatments violate anti-[[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] rules, such as those maintained by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]].<ref name=Borrione2010/> It is not clear if local injections of PRP can have a systemic impact on circulating cytokine levels, in turn affecting doping tests; it is also not clear whether PRP treatments have systemic anabolic effects or affect performance.<ref name=Borrione2010/> In January 2011, the World Anti-Doping Agency removed intramuscular injections of PRP from its prohibitions after determining that there is a "lack of any current evidence concerning the use of these methods for purposes of performance enhancement". t<ref name=IMT2011>{{cite news|author=|title=World Anti-Doping Agency announces changes to Prohibited List|newspaper=[[Irish Medical Times]]|date=2011-01-10|url=http://www.imt.ie/mims/2011/01/world-anti-doping-agency-announces-changes-to-prohibited-list-2.html|accessdate=}}</ref>
