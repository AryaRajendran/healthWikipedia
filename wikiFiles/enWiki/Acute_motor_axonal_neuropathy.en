'''Acute motor axonal neuropathy''' (AMAN) is a variant of [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]]. It is characterized by acute [[paralysis]] and loss of [[reflex]]es without [[sensory system|sensory]] loss. [[Pathology|Pathologically]], there is [[motor neuron|motor axonal]] degeneration with [[Autoimmunity|antibody-mediated]] attacks of motor nerves and [[nodes of Ranvier]].

== History ==
AMAN, also known as '''Chinese Paralytic Syndrome''',<ref name="Biller J. Practical Neurology Pg 361">Biller J. Practical Neurology, Second Edition. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; 2002:Pg 361</ref> was first described by a group of [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Pennsylvania State University]] [[Neurology|neurologists]] in collaboration with neurologists from the Second Teaching Hospital of [[Hebei University|Hebei Medical School]] and [[Beijing Children's Hospital]].<ref>McKhann GM, Cornblath DR, Ho T, Li CY, Bai AY, Wu HS, Yei QF, Zhang WC, Zhaori Z, Jiang Z, et al. Clinical and electrophysiological aspects of acute paralytic disease of children and young adults in northern China. Lancet 1991;338:593-7</ref> In 1991, Doctors Guy Mckhann, Jack Griffin, Dave Cornblath and Tony Ho from Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Arthur Asbury from University of Pennsylvania visited China to study a mysterious [[epidemic]] of [[Paralysis|paralytic syndrome]] occurring in northern China. Every summer, hundreds of children from rural China developed acute paralysis and [[respiratory failure]].  Hospitals were overwhelmed with number of cases and often ran out of [[Medical ventilator|ventilators]] and hospital beds.  Examination of these children showed that many of them had acute [[flaccid paralysis]] and [[Reflex|areflexia]] but with little or no sensory loss. [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] testing of these children showed motor axonal loss with occasional conduction block with a lack of [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinating]] features and normal sensory potentials. In contrast, the common form of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the West often presents with sensory loss and demyelination on electrophysiology testing and is more common in adults. Later, several [[Autopsy|autopsies]] confirmed the focus of the immune attack was at the motor [[axolemma]] especially around the nodes of Ranvier.  These cases showed deposition of antibody and [[Complement system|complement]] along the motor axolemma and associated [[macrophage]] infiltration.<ref>Griffin JW, Li CY, Ho TW, Xue P, Macko C, Gao CY, Yang C, Tian M, Mishu B, Cornblath DR, et al.

A link to ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' was suspected when a young girl was admitted to Second Teaching Hospital. She had become ill after feeding the family chickens. She developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure. Investigators discovered that several of the chickens in the home displayed similar symptoms and ''C. jejuni'' was found in their droppings. Several of the paralysis patients were found to have antibodies to ''C. jejuni'' and [[anti-GD1a]] antibodies, suggesting a link between the pathogen and the disease.<ref>Ho TW, Mishu B, Li CY, Gao CY, Cornblath DR, Griffin JW, Asbury AK, Blaser MJ, McKhann GM.

==Presentation and diagnosis==

The syndrome typically presents as a progressive flaccid symmetric paralysis with areflexia, often causing respiratory failure.  Electromyographic studies and [[nerve conduction study|nerve conduction studies]] show normal motor conduction velocity and latency with decreased amplitude of compound muscle [[action potential]]s. [[F-waves]] and sensory nerve action potentials are often normal in this illness.  Pathologically, it is a [[inflammation|noninflammatory]] axonopathy without demyelination.<ref name="Biller J. Practical Neurology Pg 361"/> Antibodies attack the coating of the motor neurons without causing inflammation or loss of [[myelin]]. It does not affect sensory neurons, so sensation remains intact despite loss of movement.
