'''Rigor mortis''' ([[Latin]]: ''rigor'' "stiffness", ''mortis'' "of death") is one of the recognizable signs of [[death]], caused by chemical changes in the [[muscle]]s after death, causing the limbs of the [[Dead body|corpse]] to become stiff and difficult to move or manipulate.<ref name="about.com"> [http://chemistry.about.com/cs/biochemistry/a/aa0 About.com]</ref> In humans, it commences after about three to four hours, reaches maximum stiffness after 12 hours, and gradually dissipates until approximately 48 to 60 hours after death.<ref>Saladin, K.S. 2010. Anatomy & Physiology:  6th edition. McGraw-Hill. </ref> 

== Biochemistry ==
After death, cellular respiration in organisms ceases to occur, depleting the corpse of oxygen used in the making of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). ATP is no longer provided to operate the [[SERCA]] pumps in the membrane of the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]], which pump [[calcium]] [[ion]]s into the [[terminal cisternae]].<ref name="about.com" /> This causes calcium ions to [[diffusion|diffuse]] from the area of higher [[concentration]] (in the terminal cisternae and [[extracellular fluid]]) to an area of lower concentration (in the [[sarcomere]]), binding with [[troponin]] and allowing for [[crossbridge|crossbridging]] to occur between [[myosin]] and [[actin]] proteins. <ref name="How Muscles Work">http://www.howstuffworks.com/muscle.htm</ref>

Unlike in normal muscular contraction, after death, the body is unable to complete the cycle and release the [[coupling]] between the myosin and actin, creating a state of [[muscular contraction]] until the breakdown of muscle [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] by [[enzymes]] (endogenous or bacterial) during [[decomposition]]. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax.<ref name="about.com" /><ref name="Ask a Scientist">http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/zoo00/zoo00248.htm</ref>

== Physical changes ==
At the time of death, a condition called "primary flaccidity" occurs. Following this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body are affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis begins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis then spreads to the other muscles within the next four to six hours, including the internal organs. The onset of rigor mortis is affected by the individual's age, sex, physical condition, and muscular build. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass.<ref>"Rigor Mortis and Other Postmortem Changes - Burial, Body, Life, Cause, Time, Person, Human, Putrefaction."

== Applications in meat industry ==
Rigor mortis is very important in meat technology. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determines the tenderness of [[meat]]. If the postslaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15°C (59°F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, where the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. <!-- the muscles don't actually shrink, just change shape This will lead to the loss of water from the meat along with many of the [[vitamins]], [[minerals]], and [[water-soluble]] proteins. The loss of water makes the meat hard and interferes with the manufacturing of several meat products like [[cutlet]] and [[sausage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}-->

Cold shortening is caused by the release of stored [[calcium]] ions from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] of muscle fibers in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughter]] and [[skinning]]. In this process, the [[Body|carcass]] is stimulated with [[alternating current]], causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening.<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?hl=es&lr=&id=M3wmO3ynTUwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA13&dq=avoid+cold+shortening+slaughter&ots=MRZiLBWd3X&sig=XQ4KGGoiBP2Pzg-3UMBVK3RQUJo#v=onepage&q=avoid%20cold%20shortening%20slaughter&f=false "Carcass electrical stimulation to prevent cold shortening toughness in beef", DAVEY, GILBERT, CARSE, Meat Industry Research Institute of New Zealand, 1975 via Google Books]</ref>

== Application in forensic pathology ==
The degree of rigor mortis may be used in [[forensic pathology]] to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as [[Livor mortis]] can be applied.  If the position in which a body is found does not match the location where it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm sticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it. <!--Rigor mortis is also useful because it's like an alarm clock set to go off and cease to ring in an understood span of happiness. poor analogy--> Several factors also affect the progression of rigor mortis, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. When conditions are warm, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay. <!--muscles are essentially sterile unless punctured or the blood is contaminated peri mortem--> Cold temperatures, however, slow them down. Therefore, for a person who dies outside in freezing temperatures rigor mortis may last several days more than normal, so investigators may have to abandon it as a tool for determining time of death.<ref>Peress, Robin.
