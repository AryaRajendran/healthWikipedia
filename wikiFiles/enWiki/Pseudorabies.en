'''Pseudorabies''' is a [[virus|viral]] disease in [[pig|swine]] that is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in most parts of the world. It is caused by ''Suid herpesvirus 1'' (SuHV-1), which is also called pseudorabies virus (PRV) and is also known as '''Aujeszky's disease''', and in cattle as '''mad itch'''. PRV is considered to be the most economically important viral disease of swine in areas where [[hog cholera]] has been eradicated.<ref name=Fenner_1993>{{cite book|author=Fenner, Frank J.; Gibbs, E.

Research on PRV in pigs has pioneered animal disease control with genetically modified vaccines. PRV is now extensively studied as a model for basic processes during lytic herpesvirus infection, and for unravelling molecular mechanisms of herpesvirus [[neurotropism]].<ref name=sobrino9>{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir|author=Mettenleiter|year=2008|chapter=Molecular Biology of Animal Herpesviruses|title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|display-authors=1|isbn=978-1-904455-22-6}}</ref><ref name=Sandri>{{cite book| author = Sandri-Goldin RM (editor).| title = Alpha Herpesviruses: Molecular and Cellular Biology| publisher = Caister Academic Press| year = 2006| url=http://www.horizonpress.com/ahv|isbn = 978-1-904455-09-7}}</ref>

The word "pseudorabies" means "false rabies," or "rabies-like;" pseudorabies is related to the herpes virus, not the rabies virus.

==History==
The earliest reports of a disease suspected to be pseudorabies were in 1813 in the [[United States]]. These reports described a condition in cattle characterized by severe itching and called "mad itch". In 1902, a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[veterinarian]], [[Aladár Aujeszky]], isolated PRV from a dog, ox, and cat, and showed it caused the same disease in swine and [[rabbit]]s. The name "pseudorabies" came from the symptoms similar to [[rabies]] that it caused in rabbits.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pomeranz L, Reynolds A, Hengartner C|title=Molecular Biology of Pseudorabies Virus: Impact on Neurovirology and Veterinary Medicine|journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev|volume=69|issue=3|pages=462–500|year=2005|pmid=16148307|doi=10.1128/MMBR.69.3.462-500.2005|pmc=1197806}}</ref>

The virus is shed in the saliva and nasal secretions of infected swine and is spread through oral or nasal contact. [[Aerosol]]ization of the virus and transmission by [[fomite]]s also may occur. The virus may potentially survive for seven hours in humid air and spread up to two kilometers. Furthermore, it may survive on well water for up to seven hours, in green grass, soil, and feces for up to two days, in contaminated feed for up to three days, and in straw bedding for up to four days.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web| title = Pseudorabies: Introduction| work = The Merck Veterinary Manual| year = 2006| url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/102200.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-31}}</ref>

Diagnosis is made through an [[ELISA]] test. Vaccines are available for swine ([[ATCvet]] codes: {{ATCvet|I09|AA01}} inactivated, {{ATCvet|I09|AD01}} live, plus various combinations).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pensaert M, Labarque G, Favoreel H, Nauwynck H|title=Aujeszky's disease vaccination and differentiation of vaccinated from infected pigs|journal=Dev Biol (Basel)|volume=119|pages=243–54|year=2004|pmid=15742635}}</ref> There are eradication programs in the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2004 the commercial swine population of the United States was declared free of pseudorabies, but the disease remained in feral pig populations.<ref>{{cite web| last = Amass| first = S.F.| title = Exotic Diseases: Are you Prepared?

==Symptoms==
Swine are usually asymptomatic, but PRV can cause abortion, high mortality in piglets, and coughing, sneezing, fever, constipation, depression, seizures, [[ataxia]], circling, and excess salivation in piglets and mature pigs. Mortality in piglets less than one month of age is close to 100%, but it is less than 10% in pigs between one and six months of age. Pregnant swine can reabsorb their litters or deliver mummified, stillborn, or weakened piglets.<ref name=Carter>{{cite web|author=Carter, G.R.; Flores, E.F.; Wise, we all love pigs D.J.|year=2006|title=Herpesviridae|work=A Concise Review of Veterinary Virology| url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Carter/Part2Chap11/chapter.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref> In cattle, symptoms include intense itching followed by neurological signs and death. In dogs, symptoms include intense itching, jaw and [[Pharynx|pharyngeal]] paralysis, howling, and death. In cats, the disease is so rapidly fatal, usually no symptoms are noted.<ref name=Fenner_1993/> Any infected secondary host generally only lives two to three days.<ref name=Merck/>

==Species==
Populations of [[wild boar]], or feral hogs (''Sus scrofa''), in the US commonly contract and spread the virus throughout their range. Mortality is highest in young piglets. Pregnant sows often abort when infected. Otherwise healthy male adults (boars) are typically latent carriers, that is, they harbor and transmit the virus without displaying symptoms or suffering disability.<ref>Berryman Institute: [http://www.berrymaninstitute.org/pdf/managing-feral-pigs.pdf Managing Wild Pigs]</ref>

Swine (both domestic and feral) are usual reservoirs for this virus, though it does affect other species, often with high mortality. Pseudorabies has been reported in other mammals, including  brown bears, and [[black bears]], [[Florida panther]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[coyotes]], and whitetail deer. In most cases, contact with pigs or pig products was either known or suspected. Outbreaks in farm fur species in Europe ([[mink]] and [[foxes]]) have been associated with feeding infected pig products. Many other species can be experimentally infected. Humans are not potential hosts.<ref>[http://www.evira.fi/portal/fi/elaimet/elainten_terveys_ja_elaintaudit/elaintaudit/usealle_elainlajille_yhteiset_taudit/aujeszkyn_tauti/ Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira: Aujeszkyn tauti (AD, pseudorabies)]&nbsp;{{fi}}</ref>

==Transmission==
Pseudorabies is highly contagious. In most cases, this disease is transmitted through nose-to-nose contact, which is the most common type of transmission because the virus is mostly present in nasal and oral areas. This disease can wipe out entire herds.

==Prevention==
Although no specific treatment for acute infection with pseudorabies virus is available, vaccination can alleviate clinical signs in pigs of certain ages. Typically, mass vaccination of all pigs on the farm with a modified live virus vaccine is recommended. Intranasal vaccination of sows and neonatal piglets one to seven days old, followed by intramuscular (IM) vaccination of all other swine on the premises, helps reduce viral shedding and improve survival. The modified live virus replicates at the site of injection and in regional lymph nodes. Vaccine virus is shed in such low levels, mucous transmission to other animals is minimal. In gene-deleted vaccines, the thymidine kinase gene has also been deleted; thus, the virus cannot infect and replicate in neurons. Breeding herds are recommended to be vaccinated quarterly, and finisher pigs should be vaccinated after levels of maternal antibody decrease. Regular vaccination results in excellent control of the disease. Concurrent antibiotic therapy via feed and IM injection is recommended for controlling secondary bacterial pathogens.  <ref>http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/102200.htm</ref>

==Applications in Neuroscience==
PRV, a powerful tool used in neurobiology, can be employed to analyze neural circuits in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). The Bartha strain of PRV is an attenuated form developed in 1961, and is employed as a retrograde [[neuronal tracer|transneuronal tracer]].<ref>Bartha A. (1961). Experimental reduction of virulence of Aujesky's disease virus. ''Magny Allatorvosok Lapja'' '''16''':42-45.</ref> PRV-Bartha is transported to a neuronal cell body via its axon, where it is replicated and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and the dendritic tree. PRV-Bartha is able to cross synaptic gaps into the axons of ''only'' synaptically connected neurons, thereby propagating the virus in the retrograde fashion. Using temporal studies and/or genetically engineered strains of PRV-Bartha, second, third, and higher order neurons may be identified in the [[neural network]] of interest.
