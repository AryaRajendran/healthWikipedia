'''Fractional flow reserve''' (FFR) is a technique used in [[coronary catheterization]] to measure pressure differences across a [[coronary artery]] [[stenosis]] (narrowing, usually due to [[atherosclerosis]]) to determine the likelihood that the stenosis impedes oxygen delivery to the heart muscle ([[myocardium|myocardial]] [[ischemia]]).<ref name="pmid8637515">{{cite journal |author=Pijls NH, De Bruyne B, Peels K, ''et al'' |title=Measurement of fractional flow reserve to assess the functional severity of coronary-artery stenoses |journal=N.

Fractional flow reserve is defined as the pressure behind (distal to) a stenosis relative to the pressure before the stenosis. The result is an absolute number; an FFR of 0.50 means that a given stenosis causes a 50% drop in [[blood pressure]]. In other words, FFR expresses the maximal flow down a vessel in the presence of a stenosis compared to the maximal flow in the hypothetical absence of the stenosis.

==Procedure==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Image-Image-ffr4.jpg|thumb|400px|Example of FFR calculation. The slope on the green line indicates the pressure loss over the stenosis. If the mean pressure drops from 90 to 40 mmHg, the FFR is 40/90 = 0.44.|{{puic|1=Image-Image-ffr4.jpg|log=2009 January 24}}]] -->
During coronary catheterization, a catheter is inserted into the [[femoral]] (groin) or radial arteries (wrist) using a sheath and guidewire. FFR uses a small [[sensor]] on the tip of the wire (commonly a transducer) to measure pressure, temperature and flow to determine the exact severity of the lesion. This is done during maximal blood flow ([[hyperemia]]), which can be induced by injecting products such as [[adenosine]] or [[papaverine]]. A pullback of the pressure wire is performed, and pressures are recorded across the vessel.

There is no absolute cut-off point at which FFR becomes abnormal; rather, there is a smooth transition, with a large grey zone of insecurity. In clinical trials however, a cut-off point of 0.75 to 0.80 has been used; higher values indicate a non-significant stenosis, whereas lower values indicate a significant lesion.

==Equation==
Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the ratio of maximum blood flow distal to a stenotic lesion to normal maximum flow in the same vessel. 

FFR = Pd/Pa ( Pd = pressure distal to the lesion, Pa = pressure proximal to the lesion) 

==Rationale==
The decision to perform a [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) is usually based on angiographic results alone. Angiography can be used for the visual evaluation of the inner diameter of a vessel. In ischemic heart disease, deciding which narrowing is the culprit lesion is not always clear-cut. Fractional flow reserve provides a functional evaluation, by measuring the pressure decline caused by a vessel narrowing.

===Advantages and disadvantages===
FFR has certain advantages over other techniques to evaluate narrowed coronary arteries, such as coronary angiography, [[intravascular ultrasound]] or [[CT coronarography]]. For example, FFR takes into account collateral flow, which can render an anatomical blockage functionally unimportant. Also, standard angiography can underestimate or overestimate narrowing, because it only visualizes contrast inside a vessel.

Other techniques can also provide information which FFR cannot. Intravascular ultrasound, for example, can provide information on [[vulnerable plaque|plaque vulnerability]], whereas FFR measures are only determined by plaque thickness.

FFR allows real-time estimation of the effects of a narrowed vessel, and allows for simultaneous treatment with balloon dilatation and stenting. On the other hand, FFR is an [[Invasive (medical)|invasive]] procedure for which non-invasive (less drastic) alternatives exist, such as [[cardiac stress test]]ing. In this test, physical exercise or intravenous medication is used to increase the workload and oxygen demand of the heart muscle, and ischemia is detected using [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] changes or [[nuclear imaging]].

===DEFER study===
In the DEFER study, fractional flow reserve was used to determine the need for stenting in patients with intermediate single vessel disease.<ref name="pmid17531660">{{cite journal |author=Pijls NH, van Schaardenburgh P, Manoharan G, ''et al'' |title=Percutaneous coronary intervention of functionally nonsignificant stenosis: 5-year follow-up of the DEFER Study |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=49 |issue=21 |pages=2105–11 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17531660 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.01.087 |url=}}</ref> In those patients with a stenosis with a FFR of less than 0.75, outcome was significantly worse. In patients with a FFR of 0.75 or more however, stenting did not influence outcomes. This suggests that FFR is a useful tool to gauge decision-making in this setting.

===FAME study===
The ''Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation'' (FAME) study evaluated the role of FFR in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.<ref name="pmid19144937">{{cite journal |author=Tonino PA, De Bruyne B, Pijls NH, ''et al'' |title=Fractional flow reserve versus angiography for guiding percutaneous coronary intervention |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=360 |issue=3 |pages=213–24 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19144937 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0807611 |url=}}</ref> In 20 centers in Europe and the United States, 1005 patients undergoing [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] with [[drug eluting stent]] implantation were randomized to intervention based on angiography or based on fractional flow reserve in addition to angiography. In the angiography arm of the study, all suspicious-looking lesions were stented. In the FFR arm, only angiographically suspicious lesions with an FFR of 0.80 or less were stented.

In the patients whose care was guided by FFR, fewer stents were used (2.7±1.2 and 1.9±1.3, respectively). After one year, the primary endpoint of death, nonfatal [[myocardial infarction]], and repeat [[revascularization]] were lower in the FFR group (13.2% versus 18.3%). There also was a non-significant higher number of patients of residual [[Angina pectoris|angina]] sufferers (81% versus 78%). In the FFR group, hospital stay was slightly shorter (3.4 vs 3.7 days) and procedural costs were less ($5,332 vs $6,007). FFR did not prolong procedure (around 70 minutes in both groups).
