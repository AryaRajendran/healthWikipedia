'''Palmaris brevis''' is a thin, quadrilateral muscle, placed beneath the integument of the [[ulnar]] side of the hand.<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918, see infobox)</ref> It acts to fold the skin of the [[hypothenar eminence]] transversally.

==Origin and insertion==
It arises by [[Tendon|tendinous]] [[wikt:fasciculus|fasciculi]] from the [[transverse carpal ligament]] and [[palmar aponeurosis]]; the fleshy fibers are inserted into the skin on the ulnar border of the palm of the hand,<ref name="Gray's" /> and occasionally on the [[pisiform]].<ref name="PTC">{{Cite web
