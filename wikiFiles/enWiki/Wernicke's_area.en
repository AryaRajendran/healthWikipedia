'''Wernicke's area''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɛər|n|ɨ|k|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɛər|n|ɨ|k|i}}; {{IPA-de|ˈvɛʁnɪkə|lang}}) is one of the two parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] linked since the late nineteenth century to speech (the other is [[Broca's area]]). It is involved in the understanding of written and spoken language. It is traditionally considered to consist of the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STG) in the dominant cerebral hemisphere{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} (which is the left hemisphere in about 97% of people).

==Wernicke and aphasia==

Wernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wernicke K. |chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875) |editor=Paul Eling |title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to) |publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co |location=Amsterdam |year=1995 |pages=69–89 |isbn=90-272-1893-5 |volume=4 }}</ref> He did this on the basis of the location of [[Acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] that caused [[aphasia]]. [[Receptive aphasia]] in which such abilities are preserved is also known as '''Wernicke's aphasia'''. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax]]. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called ''fluent'' or ''[[jargon aphasia]]''). 

While neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke's area is common in people with receptive aphasia, this is not always so. Some people may use the right hemisphere for language, and isolated damage of Wernicke's area cortex (sparing white matter and other areas) may not cause severe receptive aphasia.<ref name="Bogen">{{cite journal |author=Bogen JE, Bogen GM |title=Wernicke's region—Where is it? |journal=Ann.

For example, one study found that patients with posterior lesions also had trouble understanding nonverbal sounds like animal and machine noises.<ref>{{Cite pmid|12615649}}</ref> In fact, for Wernicke's area, the impairments in nonverbal sounds were statistically stronger than for verbal sounds.

==Right homologous area==

Research using [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] suggests that the area corresponding to the Wernicke’s area in the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous words—such as (‘‘river’’) when given the ambiguous word (‘‘bank’’).  In contrast, the Wernicke's area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings (‘‘teller’’ given ‘‘bank’’).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harpaz Y, Levkovitz Y, Lavidor M |title=Lexical ambiguity resolution in Wernicke's area and its right homologue |journal=Cortex |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=1097–103 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19251255 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.01.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010-9452(09)00029-X}}</ref>

==Modern views==
[[Neuroimaging]] suggests the functions earlier attributed to the Wernicke's area occur more broadly in the [[temporal lobe]] and indeed happen also in the Broca's area.

{{cquote|There are some suggestions that middle and inferior temporal gyri and basal temporal cortex reflect lexical processing ... there is consensus that the STG from rostral to caudal fields and the STS constitute the neural tissue in which many of the critical computations for speech recognition are executed ... aspects of Broca’s area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) are also regularly implicated in speech processing. 

... the range of areas implicated in speech processing go well beyond the classical language areas typically mentioned for speech; the vast majority of textbooks still state that this aspect of perception and language processing occurs in Wernicke’s area (the posterior third of the STG).<ref name="Poeppel08">{{cite journal |author=Poeppel D, Idsardi WJ, van Wassenhove V |title=Speech perception at the interface of neurobiology and linguistics |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume=363 |issue=1493 |pages=1071–86 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=17890189 |pmc=2606797 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2160 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17890189}}</ref>}}

Support for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study done at University of Rochester in which American Sign Language native speakers were subject to MRIs while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of "moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body").  Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition.  However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap.  These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.<ref name="Newman2010">{{cite journal |author=Newman AJ, Supalla T, Hauser P, Newport EL, Bravelier D |title=Dissociating neural subsystems for grammar by contrasting word order and inflection |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, |volume=16 |issue=107 |pages=7539 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1003174107}}</ref>
