'''Gerald D. Fischbach''' (born on November 15, 1938) is an American [[neuroscientist]]. He received his M.D. from the [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University]] in 1965 before beginning his research career at the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1966, where his research focused on the mechanisms of neuromuscular junctions. After his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach was a professor at [[Harvard University Medical School]] from 1972–1981 and 1990–1998 and the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] from 1981–1990. In 1998, he was named the director of the [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] before becoming the Vice President and Dean of the Health and Biomedical Sciences, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, and the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at [[Columbia University]] from 2001–2006.<ref name = "Motor Neuron"/> Gerald Fischbach currently serves as the scientific director overseeing the [[Simons Foundation]] Autism Research Initiative.<ref name = "Simons"/> Throughout Fischbach's career, much of his research has focused on the formation and function of the [[neuromuscular junction]], which stemmed from his innovative use of [[cell culture]] to study synaptic mechanisms.<ref name = "Columbia"/>

==Education and experience== 
Fischbach attended [[Colgate University]] in Hamilton, NY, where he was a four-year recipient of the New York State Regents Scholarship. He graduated magna cum laude with high honors in mathematics receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics and Chemistry. Fischbach was also elected a member of Colgate University’s [[Phi Beta Kappa]] chapter in 1960. After graduating from Colgate University, Fischbach attended Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, where he was a recipient of the New York State Medical Scholarship from 1962 to 1965 and the [[Polk Award]] for Undergraduate Research in 1965, before graduating with his M.D. that same year. Additionally, Fischbach received an honorary masters degree from Harvard University in 1978 and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Colgate University in 2003. After graduating medical school, Fischbach interned at the [[University of Washington]] hospital in Seattle, Washington before beginning his research career at the National Institutes of Health in 1966.<ref name= "Motor Neuron">"[http://www.columbiamnc.org/bio.php?id=5 Gerald D.

==Research career==
===National Institutes of Health 1966–1973===
Fischbach began his research career at the National Institutes of Health, where he served as a senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973.<ref name="Motor Neuron"/><ref name= "NINDS Director">"[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/news_and_events/news_articles/pressrelease_fischbach_060398.htm Dr. Gerald D. Fischbach Appointed New NINDS Director]". National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Accessed 27 October 2011</ref> Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling [[action potentials]] and [[synapses]], from which he pioneered the use of [[neuron]] and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions.<ref name="Columbia">"[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/00/12/fischbach.html NIH's Gerald D. Fischbach Named Columbia's Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences]". Columbia University. Columbia News. Accessed 27 October 2011]</ref> Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick [[embryos]] to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced [[action potentials]]. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials.<ref name= "Synaptic Potentials">{{Cite pmid|5454145}}</ref> This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance.<ref name="Motor Neuron"/><ref name = "NINDS Director"/> Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for [[motor neuron]] molecules responsible for regulating the number of [[acetylcholine receptors]] on [[postsynaptic]] cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which is a member of the [[neuregulin]] family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.<ref name = "Motor Neuron"/><ref name= "Columbia Department of Neuroscience">"[http://neuroscience.columbia.edu/department/index.php?ID=27&bio=251 Gerald D.

===Harvard University 1973–1981, 1990–1998===
After his time at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach obtained a position as an associate professor at Harvard Medical School's Department of Pharmacology in 1973. By 1978 he obtained tenure and became a full professor, and continued teaching at Harvard University for the next three years. After a nine-year stint at the [[University of Washington Medical School]], he returned to Harvard to serve as the Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and Chairman of the Neurobiology Departments of both Harvard Medical School and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] from 1990 to 1998.<ref name="Motor Neuron" /> During his years as an associate professor, he researched the development of precursor muscle cells, specifically the development of [[acetylcholine]] receptors on embryonic chick pectoral muscles.<ref name= "Acetylcholine">{{Cite pmid|568091}}</ref> Later on he continued his research on ARIA that he started at the National Institutes of Health, specifically focusing on the expression of the protein's [[isoforms]] and their effects on [[tyrosine kinases]]. In 1993, Fischbach was involved with the founding of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute. This inter-disciplinary program aims to research the different structures, evolution, and development of the [[nervous system]] in order to better understand human behavior.<ref>"[http://mbb.harvard.edu Harvard Mind/Brain/Behavior Initiative]". Harvard University Medical School. Accessed 30 October 2011]</ref>

===Washington University School of Medicine 1981–1990===
Gerald Fischbach spent nine years at the Washington University School of Medicine, where he served as the Edison Professor of Neurobiology and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology.<ref name="Motor Neuron"/> During his time here, Fischbach continued his work on the ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.<ref name= "Chicken Brain">{{Cite pmid|2831539}}</ref>

In addition to his ARIA work, Fischbach also researched rapid [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]] of [[glutamate receptors]] in chicken spinal cord and rat [[hippocampal]] neurons. Using focal [[ionophoresis]] and pressure injections to apply [[glutamate]] and other [[agonists]] including [[NMDA]], [[AMPA]], and [[kainate]] to different regions of the neurons, he noticed that certain hot spots were desensitized more rapidly that other sites on the neuron. Fischbach and his collaborators hypothesized that these hot spots may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of glutamate receptors were present.<ref name= "Desensitization">{{Cite pmid|2898144}}</ref>

===National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 1998–2001=== 
Fischbach returned to the [[NIH]] in 1998 when he was named director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a division of the NIH that supports research on the brain and nervous system. While he was director, Fischbach oversaw a staff of more than 700 and an annual budget of about $800 million.<ref name = "NINDS Director"/> This money was used to support research by private and public organizations across the country as well as scientists working in labs at NINDS.<ref name = "NINDS Director"/> Fischbach accomplished many things while director of NINDS, one of which being helping to shape national policy on important neurological research issues.<ref name="Motor Neuron"/> He received great praise for his time as director from both Harold Varmus, former director of the NIH and current director of the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI), and Richard Klausner, former director of the NCI.<ref name="Motor Neuron"/> Fischbach left NINDS is 2001 when he was named [[Columbia University]]'s Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences.<ref name="Motor Neuron"/>

While at the NINDS, Fischbach researched the effects of [[neuregulin]], which is a family of proteins including [[heregulin]], neu differentiation factor, ARIA, and [[glial]] [[growth factor]] that are critical for vertebrate [[embryogenesis]] and specifically for the formation of vertebrate spinal cord [[oligodendrocytes]].  Fischbach and his colleagues noticed that oligodendrocytes failed to form in mice that were [[homozygous]] for the mutant neuregulin gene.  However, when wild-type neuregulin was added to homozygous mutant neuregulin explants (isolated tissue cell cultures) nine days after conception of the embryos, normal oligodendrocyte development occurred. This indicated that neuregulin is not necessary for the proliferation of oligodendrocyte [[multipotent]] [[precursor cells]].  Additionally, when IgB4, a neuregulin inhibitor, is added to wild-type explants, oligodendrocyte development failed to occur. <ref name= "Failure">{{Cite pmid|9892702}}</ref>

===Columbia University 2001–2006===
After serving as the Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institute of Health, Gerald Fischbach was selected as the Vice President and Dean of the Health and Biomedical Sciences, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, and the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Columbia University in New York City.<ref name="PRNewswire">"[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dr-gerald-d-fischbach-director-of-the-national-institute-of-neurological-disorders-and-stroke-at-nih-named-columbias-vice-president-for-health-and-biomedical-sciences-76026862.html Dr. Gerald D.

The research Fischbach conducted at Columbia University stemmed from his previous work at Harvard University, Washington University and with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health. The specialized focus of his research was on the influence trophic factors could have on the survival of nerve cells and the efficiency of synapses. After his arrival to Columbia, Fischbach was focused on the expression of [[neuregulin]] in regards to neuromuscular synapses, signaling pathways in the brain, [[transcription factors]], as well as work on [[autism]].<ref name= "loeb">{{Cite pmid|11896160}}</ref><ref name= "Type">{{Cite pmid|12490385}}</ref><ref name= "TF">{{Cite pmid|15302938}}</ref><ref name= "Autism">{{Cite pmid|20955926}}</ref> His research on [[Neuregulin-1]] revealed a possible function in CNS [[neurogenesis]] since the neuregulins were labeled throughout proliferation with an anti-MAP2 antibody and an anti-[[Nestin_(protein)|nestin]] antibody were suggested to have become neuron-restricted progenitors.<ref name= "progenitors">{{Cite pmid|15949792}}</ref> Some of his other research examined the relationship between neuregulin and expression of [[myosin heavy chain]] and transcription factors in human muscle. The research found that treatment including neuregulin increased the number of [[acetylcholine]] receptors on the surface of the [[myotube]] as well as an increase in the early growth response family for transcription factors. These findings impact the available knowledge regarding muscle spindle fiber formation, myosin heavy chains development, and the feasibility of mimicking muscle development processes [[in vitro]].<ref name = "TF"/>

==Current research==
[[File:Gene-duplication.png|thumb|right| Gene duplication can cause copy number variants, which result in chromosomes with multiple copies of genes.]]
===Simons Foundation 2006–present===
In 2006, Fischbach joined the [[Simons Foundation]] as the scientific director to oversee the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. The Simons Foundation is an organization founded by [[James Simons|Jim Simons]] and his wife Marilyn, and has awarded $130 million for [[autism]] research as of 2008.<ref name="Simons">"[http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/?page=engine&id=728 Neuroscientist Gerald Fischbach Named Visiting Professor]". The Rockefeller University. 12 March 2008. Accessed 30 October 2011</ref> As scientific director, Fischbach collaborates with mathematicians, engineers, chemists, and neuroscientists to try and understand autism more completely. Currently, Fischbach oversees research focusing on the [[neurobiology]] of autism and how it can relate to finding a possible cure. <ref name= "Simons"/> <ref name = "Autism"/>

Additionally, Fischbach and his colleagues are working on the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), which is designed to identify genetic factors that increase the risk of autism. <ref name = "Autism"/>  Over 100 researchers and 13 universities have interviewed and collected blood samples from more than 2000 families to look for a genetic linkage to autism.<ref name=Simons/> The majority of tested individuals have moderate to severe autistic symptoms and do not display high levels of intellectual disability.  Additionally, autistic individuals from enrolled SSC families exhibit [[genetic deletions]], duplications, and [[copy number variants]] (CNVs) that are not present in unaffected family members.  Siblings serve as ideal control groups to identify unique CNVs associated with autism.  Although CNVs are rare and are found in only up to 1% autistic individuals, the presence of multiple CNVs in autistic individuals may account for a larger fraction of autism cases. Ultimately, the goal of the SSC is to expand the number of individuals enrolled in the program in hope of identifying penetrant CNVs, small de novo [[genetic variant]]s, and single nucleotide polymorphisms that are linked to a higher risk of autism. <ref name = "Autism"/>

Along with this research, Fischbach and his colleagues at the Simons Foundation are studying diseases that have autistic features, such as [[Rett syndrome]] and [[Fragile X syndrome]].  The hope is that a better understanding of the central role of the [[synapse]] in autistic symptoms can be discovered as well as which specific regions of the brain are responsible for these behaviors.  Within the next decade, the ultimate goal of this research is to determine the precise neural circuitry involved in autism and how it translates to the autistic behaviors displayed. <ref name="MIT">"[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/844 Autism Research: Progress and Promises]".
