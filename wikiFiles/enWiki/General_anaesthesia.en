'''General anaesthesia''' (or '''general anesthesia''') is a medically induced [[coma]] and loss of protective reflexes resulting from the administration of one or more [[general anaesthetic]] agents.  A variety of [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]] may be administered, with the overall aim of ensuring [[sleep]], [[amnesia]], [[Analgesic|analgesia]], relaxation of [[skeletal muscle]]s, and loss of control of [[reflex]]es of the [[autonomic nervous system]].  The optimal combination of these agents for any given patient and procedure is typically selected by an [[anesthesiologist|anaesthesiologist]] or another provider such as an anaesthesiologist assistant or [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]], in consultation with the patient and the medical or dental [[medical practitioner|practitioner]] performing the operative procedure.

== History ==
{{Main|History of general anesthesia}}
{{Further|History of tracheal intubation}}
Attempts at producing a state of general anaesthesia can be traced throughout [[recorded history]] in the writings of the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indians]], and [[History of China#Ancient era|Chinese]].  During the [[Middle Ages]], which correspond roughly to what is sometimes referred to as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], scientists and other scholars made significant advances in [[science in medieval Islam|science]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|medicine]] in the [[Muslim world]] and [[Eastern world]], while their European counterparts also made important advances.

The European [[Renaissance]] saw significant advances in [[anatomy]] and [[surgery|surgical technique]].  However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort.  Largely because of the associated [[pain]], many patients with surgical disorders chose certain death rather than undergo surgery.  Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anaesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anaesthetic techniques.

Two enormous leaps occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to [[Modernity|modern]] surgery.  An appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]] led rapidly to the development and application of [[antiseptic]] techniques in surgery.  Antisepsis, which soon gave way to [[asepsis]], reduced the overall [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras.  Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in [[pharmacology]] and [[physiology]] which led to the development of general anaesthesia and the control of pain.

In the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anaesthesia was improved by the routine use of [[tracheal intubation]] and other advanced [[airway management]] techniques.  Significant advances in [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and new [[anesthetic|anaesthetic agents]] with improved [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] characteristics also contributed to this trend.  Finally, standardized training programs for anaesthesiologists and [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]]s emerged during this period.

== Purpose ==
General anaesthesia has many purposes including:
#Analgesia — loss of response to pain,
#Amnesia — loss of memory,
#Immobility — loss of motor reflexes,
#Unconsciousness — loss of consciousness,
#Skeletal muscle relaxation.

== Biochemical mechanism of action ==
The [[biochemistry|biochemical]] [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|mechanism of action of general anaesthetics]] is not yet well understood.  To induce unconsciousness, anaesthetics have myriad sites of action and  affect the central nervous system (CNS) at multiple levels.  Common areas of the central nervous system whose functions are interrupted or changed during general anesthesia include the cerebral cortex, thalamus, reticular activating system, and spinal cord.  Current theories on the anesthetized state identify not only target sites in the CNS but also neural networks and loops whose interruption are linked with unconsciousness.<ref>Anesthesiology August 2007 - Volume 107 - Issue 2 - pp 195-198 doi: 10.1097/01.anes.0000271869.27956.d1</ref>  Agents used in context of a general anesthetic have the [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and the glutamate-activated ion channels [[N-methyl-D-aspartic acid|NMDA]] receptor families as potential pharmacologic targets, but others such as voltage-gated ion channels, glycine and 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT) receptors, are also involved.  

Among the inhaled anesthetic agents, [[halothane]] has been found to be a GABA [[agonist]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=X.|last2=Pearce|first2=R.A.|title=Effects of halothane on GABA(A) receptor kinetics: evidence for slowed agonist unbinding|journal=J.Neurosci.|volume=20|issue=3|pages=899–907|year=2000|pmid=10648694}}</ref> and [[ketamine]] is an NMDA [[receptor antagonist]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=N.|last2=Simmonds|first2=M.|title=Quantitative studies on some antagonists of N-methyl D-aspartate in slices of rat cerebral cortex|journal=Br J Pharmacol|volume=84|issue=2|pages=381–391|year=1985|pmid=2858237|pmc=1987274}}</ref>

== Preanaesthetic evaluation ==
Prior to planned operation or procedure, the anaesthetist reviews the medical record and/or interviews the patient to determine the best combination of drugs and dosages and the degree to which [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] will be required to ensure a safe and effective procedure.  Key factors of this evaluation are the patient's age, [[body mass index]], medical and surgical history, current medications, and fasting time.  Thorough and accurate answering of the questions is important so that the anaesthetist can select the proper anaesthetic [[drug]]s and procedures.  For example, a patient who consumes significant quantities of alcohol or [[Recreational drug use|illicit drugs]] could be undermedicated if s/he fails to disclose this fact.  This in turn could then lead to [[anesthesia awareness|anaesthesia awareness]] or dangerously high blood pressure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Commonly used medications (e.g., [[sildenafil]]) can interact with anaesthesia drugs; failure to disclose such usage can also increase the risk to the patient.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} There are some situations (where patients are on a certain medication and must undergo a given procedure) in which [[local anesthesia|local anaesthesia]] or [[regional anaesthesia]] can be given, but instead general anaesthesia is chosen, though this is not extremely common due to the fact that general anaesthesia is by nature more dangerous and the agents used react with many more medications.

An important aspect of the preanaesthetic evaluation is that of the patient's airway, involving inspection of the mouth opening and visualisation of the soft tissues of the [[Human pharynx|pharynx]].  The condition of teeth and location of dental crowns and caps are checked, neck flexibility and head extension observed.  If a [[tracheal tube]] is indicated and airway management is deemed difficult, then alternative methods of [[tracheal intubation]], such as fibreoptic intubation, may be required as part of the anaesthetic management.

== Premedication ==
Anaesthesiologists may prescribe or administer a ''premedication'' prior to administration of a general anaesthetic.  Anaesthetic premedication consists of a drug or combination of drugs that serve to complement or otherwise improve the quality of the anaesthetic.

One example of this is the preoperative administration of [[clonidine]], an [[Alpha-adrenergic_agonist#.CE.B12_agonists|alpha-2 adrenergic agonist]].  Clonidine premedication reduces the need for anaesthetic induction agents{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, as well as the need for volatile anaesthetic agents during maintenance of general anaesthesia,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and the need for postoperative analgesics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Clonidine premedication also reduces postoperative shivering{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, [[postoperative nausea and vomiting]] and emergence [[delirium]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In children, [[clonidine]] premedication is at least as effective as [[benzodiazepine]]s, in addition to having a more favourable side effect profile.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} It also reduces the incidence of post-operative delirium associated with [[sevoflurane]] anaesthesia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As a result clonidine has become a popular agent for anaesthetic premedication.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bergendahl|first1=H|last2=Lönnqvist|first2=PA|last3=Eksborg|first3=S|title=Clonidine in paediatric anaesthesia: review of the literature and comparison with benzodiazepines for anesthetic premedication|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118557949/HTMLSTART|journal=Acta Anaesthesiol Scand|volume=50|issue=2|pages=135–43|month=Feb|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.2006.00940.x|pmid=16430532|accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dahmani|first1=S|last2=Brasher|first2=C|last3=Stany|first3=I|last4=Golmard|first4=J|last5=Skhiri|first5=A|last6=Bruneau|first6=B|last7=Nivoche|first7=Y|last8=Constant|first8=I|last9=Murat|first9=I|title=Premedication with clonidine is superior to benzodiazepines.

[[Midazolam]], a benzodiazepine characterized by a rapid onset and short duration relative to other benzodiazepines, is effective in reducing preoperative anxiety, including [[Separation anxiety disorder|separation anxiety]] associated with separation of children from their parents and induction of anaesthesia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=RG|last2=Nemish|first2=U|last3=Ewen|first3=A|last4=Crowe|first4=MJ|title=Evidence-based clinical update: does premedication with oral midazolam lead to improved behavioural outcomes in children?|journal=Can J Anaesth|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1213–9|month=Dec|year=2006|doi=10.1007/BF03021583|pmid=17142656|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/8n317wx4w0136x35/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> [[Dexmedetomidine]] and certain [[atypical antipsychotic]] agents are other drugs that are used in particular in very uncooperative children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bozkurt|first1=P|title=Premedication of the pediatric patient - anesthesia for the uncooperative child|journal=Curr Opin Anaesthesiol|volume=20|issue=3|pages=211–215|month=Jun|year=2007|doi=10.1097/ACO.0b013e328105e0dd|pmid=17479023|url=http://journals.lww.com/co-anesthesiology/Abstract/2007/06000/Premedication_of_the_pediatric_patient__.11.aspx|accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref>

[[Melatonin]] has been found to be effective as an anaesthetic premedication in both adults and children due to its [[hypnotic]], [[anxiolytic]], sedative, [[Nociception|antinociceptive]], and [[anticonvulsant]] properties.  Unlike midazolam, melatonin does not impair [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor skills]] or adversely affect the quality of recovery.  Recovery is more rapid after melatonin premedication than with midazolam, and there is also a reduced incidence of post-operative [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] and delirium.<ref name=Naguib2007>{{Cite journal|last1=Naguib|first1=M|last2=Gottumukkala|first2=V|last3=Goldstein|first3=PA|title=Melatonin and anesthesia: a clinical perspective|journal=J Pineal Res|volume=42|issue=1|pages=12–21|month=Jan|year=2007|pmid=17198534|doi=10.1111/j.1600-079X.2006.00384.x}}</ref> Melatonin premedication also reduces the required induction dose of [[propofol]] and [[Sodium thiopental|thiopental]].<ref name=Naguib2007/>

Another example of anaesthetic premedication is the preoperative administration of [[Adrenergic beta-antagonist|beta adrenergic antagonists]] to reduce the incidence of postoperative [[hypertension]], [[cardiac dysrhythmia]] or [[myocardial infarction]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} One may choose to administer an [[antiemetic]] agent such as [[droperidol]] or [[dexamethasone]] to reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} or subcutaneous [[heparin]] or [[Enoxaparin sodium|enoxaparin]] to reduce the incidence of [[deep vein thrombosis]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Other commonly used premedication agents include [[opioid]]s such as [[fentanyl]] or [[sufentanil]], [[Prokinetic agent|gastrokinetic]] agents such as [[metoclopramide]], and [[histamine antagonist]]s such as [[famotidine]].

Non-pharmacologic preanaesthetic interventions include playing relaxing music, [[massage]], and reducing ambient light and noise levels in order to maintain the [[Circadian rhythm|sleep-wake cycle]].<ref name="Mencía-2007">{{Cite journal|last1=Mencía|first1=SB|last2=López-Herce|first2=JC|last3=Freddi|first3=N|title=Analgesia and sedation in children: practical approach for the most frequent situations|journal=J Pediatr (Rio J)|volume=83|issue=2 Suppl|pages=S71–82|month=May|year=2007|doi=10.2223/JPED.1625|pmid=17530139|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jped/v83n2s0/en_a09v83n2s0.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> These techniques are particularly useful for [[pediatrics|paediatric]] and [[Intellectual disability|mentally retarded]] patients.

== Stages of anaesthesia ==
The [[Guedel's classification]] by [[Arthur Ernest Guedel]] described four stages of anaesthesia in 1937.<ref name=Hewer1937>{{Cite journal|author=Hewer CL|title=THE STAGES AND SIGNS OF GENERAL ANAESTHESIA|journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=2|issue=3996|pages=274–276|year=1937
|pmc=2087073|pmid=20780832|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3996.274}}</ref> Despite newer anaesthetic agents and delivery techniques, which have led to more rapid onset and recovery from anaesthesia, with greater safety margins, the principles remain.

;Stage 1: Stage 1 anaesthesia, also known as the "induction", is the period between the initial administration of the induction agents and loss of consciousness.  During this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia.  Patients can carry on a conversation at this time.
;Stage 2: Stage 2 anaesthesia, also known as the "excitement stage", is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity.  During this stage, respirations and heart rate may become irregular.  In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, [[vomiting]], breath holding, and pupillary dilation.  Since the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respirations may lead to airway compromise, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach stage 3 as fast as possible.
;Stage 3: Stage 3, "surgical anaesthesia".  During this stage, the skeletal muscles relax, vomiting stops , and respiratory depression occurs .  Eye movements slow, then stop, the patient is unconscious and ready for surgery.  It has been divided into 4 planes:
:# eyes initially rolling, then becoming fixed
:# loss of corneal and laryngeal reflexes
:# pupils dilate and loss of light reflex
:# intercostal paralysis, shallow abdominal respiration
;Stage 4: Stage 4 anaesthesia, also known as "overdose", is the stage where too much medication has been given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation and the patient has severe brain stem or medullary depression.  This results in a cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse.  This stage is lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support.

== Induction ==
Induction of general anaesthesia is usually conducted in a [[medical facility]], most commonly in an [[Operating theater|operating room]].  However, general anaesthesia may also be conducted in many other locations, such as an [[endoscopy]] suite, [[radiology]] or [[cardiology]] department, [[emergency department]], [[ambulance]], or at the site of a [[disaster]] where extrication of the patient may be impossible or impractical.

Anaesthetic agents may be administered by various routes, including [[inhalation]], [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] ([[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] or [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]]), [[mouth|oral]], and [[rectum|rectal]].  After administration by one or more of these routes, the agents gain access to the blood.  Once in the [[circulatory system]], they are transported to their biochemical [[Active site|sites of action]] in the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] nervous systems, where they exert their [[pharmacology|pharmacologic]] effects.

Most general anaesthetics today are induced either with a needle, by [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] injection, or by breathing a [[volatile anaesthetic]] through an anaesthetic circuit (inhalational induction).  Onset of anaesthesia is faster with intravenous injection than with inhalation, taking about 10–20 seconds to induce total unconsciousness.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This has the advantage of avoiding the excitatory phase of anaesthesia (see above), and thus reduces complications related to induction of anaesthesia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Commonly used intravenous induction agents include [[propofol]], [[sodium thiopental]], [[etomidate]], and [[ketamine]].  An inhalational induction may be chosen by the anaesthesiologist where intravenous access is difficult to obtain, where difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or due to patient preference (e.g., children).  [[Sevoflurane]] is currently the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, because it is less irritating to the [[tracheobronchial tree]] than other volatile anaesthetic agents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Physiologic monitoring ===
Monitoring involves the use of several technologies to allow for a controlled induction of, maintenance of and emergence from general anaesthesia.
# Continuous Electrocardiography ([[ECG]]): The placement of electrodes that monitor heart rate and rhythm.  This may also help the anaesthetist to identify early signs of heart [[ischemia|ischaemia]].
# Continuous [[pulse oximetry]] (SpO2): The placement of this device (usually on one of the fingers) allows for early detection of a fall in a patient's [[hemoglobin|haemoglobin]] saturation with oxygen ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxaemia]]).
# Blood Pressure Monitoring (NIBP or IBP): There are two methods of measuring the patient's blood pressure.  The first, and most common, is called non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring.  This involves placing a blood pressure cuff around the patient's arm, forearm or leg.  A blood pressure machine takes blood pressure readings at regular, preset intervals throughout the surgery.  The second method is called invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring.  This method is reserved for patients with significant heart or lung disease, the critically ill, major surgery such as cardiac or transplant surgery, or when large blood losses are expected.  The invasive blood pressure monitoring technique involves placing a special type of plastic cannula in the patient's artery - usually at the wrist or in the groin.
# Agent [[concentration]] measurement - Common [[anaesthetic machine]]s have monitors to measure the per cent of [[inhalational anaesthetic]] agent used (e.g.  [[sevoflurane]], [[isoflurane]], [[desflurane]], [[halothane]] etc.).  The monitors also usually measure nitrous oxide and oxygen percentages and could give a MAC level.
# Low [[oxygen]] alarm - Almost all circuits have a backup alarm in case the oxygen delivery to the patient becomes compromised.  This warns if the fraction of inspired oxygen drops lower than minimum alarm setting and allows the [[anaesthetist]] to take immediate remedial action.
# Circuit disconnect alarm or low pressure alarm indicates failure of circuit to achieve a given pressure during [[mechanical ventilation]].
# [[Carbon dioxide]] measurement ([[capnography]])- measures the amount of carbon dioxide expired by the patient's lungs in per cent or mmHg, mmHg is usually used to allow the anaesthesia provider to see more subtle changes in CO2.  It allows the anaesthetist to assess the adequacy of [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]
# Temperature measurement to discern [[hypothermia]] or [[fever]], and to aid early detection of [[malignant hyperthermia]].
# EEG or other system to verify depth of anaesthesia may also be used.  This reduces the likelihood that a patient will be mentally awake, although unable to move because of the paralytic agents.  It also reduces the likelihood of a patient receiving significantly more amnesic drugs than actually necessary to do the job.

=== Airway management ===
With the loss of consciousness caused by general anaesthesia, there is loss of protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), loss of [[Airway management|airway patency]] and sometimes loss of a regular breathing pattern due to the effect of anaesthetics, [[opioid]]s, or [[muscle relaxant]]s.  To maintain an open airway and regulate breathing within acceptable parameters, some form of "[[tracheal tube|breathing tube]]" is inserted in the airway after the patient is unconscious.  To enable [[mechanical ventilation]], an endotracheal tube is often used ([[intubation]]), although there are alternative devices such as face masks or [[laryngeal mask airway]]s.

=== Neuromuscular blockade ===
"Paralysis" or temporary muscle relaxation with a [[neuromuscular blocker]] is an integral part of modern anaesthesia.  The first drug used for this purpose was [[curare]], introduced in the 1940s, which has now been superseded by drugs with fewer side effects and generally shorter duration of action.  Muscle relaxation allows [[surgery]] within major [[body cavity|body cavities]], e.g.  [[abdomen]] and [[thorax]] without the need for very deep anaesthesia, and is also used to facilitate [[endotracheal intubation]].  Acetylcholine, the natural [[neurotransmitter]] substance at the [[neuromuscular junction]], causes muscles to contract when it is released from nerve endings.  Muscle relaxants work by preventing acetylcholine from attaching to its receptor.  Paralysis of the muscles of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], i.e.  the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] and [[intercostal]] muscles of the chest requires that some form of artificial respiration be implemented.  As the muscles of the [[larynx]] are also paralysed, the [[airway]] usually needs to be protected by means of an [[endotracheal tube]].  Monitoring of paralysis is most easily provided by means of a peripheral [[nerve]] stimulator.  This device intermittently sends short electrical pulses through the [[skin]] over a peripheral nerve while the contraction of a muscle supplied by that nerve is observed.  The effects of muscle relaxants are commonly reversed at the termination of surgery by [[Cholinesterase inhibitor|anticholinesterase]] drugs.  Examples of skeletal muscle relaxants in use today are [[pancuronium]], [[rocuronium]], [[vecuronium]], [[atracurium]], [[mivacurium]], and [[succinylcholine]].

== Maintenance ==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
The duration of action of intravenous induction agents is in general 5 to 10 minutes, after which time spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur.  In order to prolong anaesthesia for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be ''maintained''.  Usually this is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, [[nitrous oxide]], and a [[volatile anaesthetic]] agent or by having a carefully controlled infusion of medication, usually [[propofol]], through an [[Peripheral venous catheter|intravenous catheter]].  The inhalation agents are transferred to the patient's brain via the lungs and the bloodstream, and the patient remains unconscious.  Inhaled agents are frequently supplemented by intravenous anaesthetics, such as opioids (usually [[fentanyl]] or a fentanyl derivative) and sedative-hypnotics (usually propofol or midazolam), though, for a propofol-based anaesthetic, supplementation by inhalation agents is not required.  At the end of surgery, the volatile or intravenous anaesthetic is discontinued.  Recovery of consciousness occurs when the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level (usually within 1 to 30 minutes, depending upon the duration of surgery).  In the 1990s, a novel method of maintaining anaesthesia was developed in Glasgow, UK.  Called TCI (target controlled infusion), this involves using a computer-controlled syringe driver (pump) to infuse propofol throughout the duration of surgery, removing the need for a volatile anaesthetic, and allowing pharmacologic principles to more precisely guide the amount of infusion of the drug.  Purported advantages include faster recovery from anaesthesia, reduced incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting, and absence of a trigger for [[malignant hyperthermia]].  At present, TCI is not permitted in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Other medications will occasionally be given to anaesthetized patients to treat side-effects or prevent complications.  These medications include [[antihypertensives]] to treat high blood pressure, drugs like [[ephedrine]] and [[phenylephrine]] to treat low blood pressure, drugs like [[salbutamol]] to treat asthma or [[laryngospasm]]/[[bronchospasm]], and drugs like [[epinephrine]] or [[diphenhydramine]] to treat allergic reactions.  Sometimes [[glucocorticoids]] or [[antibiotics]] are given to prevent inflammation and infection, respectively.

== Emergence ==
Emergence is the process of return to baseline physiologic function of all organ systems after the cessation of administration of general anaesthetic agent(s).  This stage of general anaesthesia may be accompanied by certain unusual but temporary neurologic phenomena, such as [[agitated emergence]] (acute mental confusion), [[aphasia]] (impaired production or comprehension of speech), or focal impairment in sensory or motor function.  [[Shivering]] is also fairly common and can be clinically significant since it results in an increase in [[oxygen]] consumption, [[carbon dioxide]] production, [[cardiac output]], [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure|systemic blood pressure]].  The proposed mechanism is based on the observation that the spinal cord recovers at a faster rate than the brain.  This results in uninhibited spinal reflexes manifested as [[clonic]] activity (shivering).  This theory is supported by the fact that [[doxapram]], a [[Central nervous system|CNS]] stimulant, is somewhat effective in abolishing [[Postanesthetic shivering|postoperative shivering]].<ref>Basics of Anesthesia, 5th Edition Authors: Robert K.  Stoelting & Ronald D.  Miller ISBN 978-0-443-06801-0</ref> Cardiovascular events such as [[hypertension|increased]] or [[hypotension|decreased]] blood pressure, [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]] or other [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]s are also common during emergence from general anaesthesia, as are respiratory symptoms such as [[dyspnea|dyspnoea]].

== Postoperative care ==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Anesthesia recovery modified.jpg|thumb|right|Anaesthetized patient: postoperative recovery.]]
The anaesthesia should conclude with a pain-free awakening and a management plan for postoperative pain relief.  This may be in the form of [[regional analgesia]], oral, [[transdermal]], or [[parenteral]] medication.  Minor surgical procedures are amenable to oral pain relief medications such as [[paracetamol]] and [[NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]].  Moderate levels of pain require the addition of mild [[opiates]] such as [[tramadol]].  Major surgical procedures may require a combination of modalities to confer adequate pain relief.  Parenteral methods include patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) involving a strong opiate such as morphine, fentanyl, or oxycodone.  Here, to activate a syringe device, the patient presses a button and receives a preset dose or "bolus" of the drug (e.g., one milligram of morphine).  The PCA device then "locks out" for a preset period, e.g.  5 minutes, to allow the drug to take effect.  If the patient becomes too sleepy or sedated, he or she makes no more morphine requests.  This confers a fail-safe aspect that is lacking in continuous-opiate infusion techniques.  [[Postanesthetic shivering]] is a frequent occurrence in the post-operative period.  Apart from causing discomfort and exacerbating post-operative pain, shivering has been shown to increase oxygen consumption, catecholamine release, cardiac output, heart rate, blood pressure, and intra-ocular pressure.  There are a number of techniques used to reduce this occurrence, such as increasing the ambient temperature in theatre, using conventional or forced warm air blankets, and using warmed intravenous fluids.<ref name=English2002>{{Cite journal|author=English W|title=Post-operative shivering, causes, prevention and treatment (letter)|journal=Update in Anaesthesia|issue=15|year=2002|url=http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u15/u1503_01.htm|accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref>

In many cases, opioids used in general anaesthesia can cause post-operative [[ileus]] even in non-abdominal surgery.

{{Main|Perioperative mortality}}
Most [[perioperative mortality]] is attributable to [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] from the operation (such as [[Bleeding|haemorrhage]], [[sepsis]], and failure of vital organs.  This also may include memory loss or slowing down of the thought processes) or pre-existing [[Comorbidity|medical conditions]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Most current estimates of perioperative mortality range from 1 death in 53 anaesthetics to 1 in 5,417 anaesthetics.<ref name= Lagasse2002>{{cite journal|author=Lagasse RS|title=Anesthesia safety: model or myth?
