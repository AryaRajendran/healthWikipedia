'''Splenic diseases''' include [[splenomegaly]], where the spleen is enlarged for various reasons. On the other hand, a lack of normal spleen function is called [[asplenia]].

==Splenomegaly==
{{Main|Splenomegaly}}
Enlargement of the spleen is known as [[splenomegaly]]. It may be caused by [[sickle cell anemia]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[malaria]], [[bacterial endocarditis]], [[leukemia]], [[pernicious anemia]], [[Gaucher's disease]], [[leishmaniasis]], [[Hodgkin's disease]], [[Banti's syndrome|Banti's disease]], [[hereditary spherocytosis]], [[cyst]]s, glandular fever ([[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]] or 'Mono' caused by the [[Epstein-Barr Virus]]), and [[tumour]]s. Primary tumors of the spleen include [[hemangioma]]s and [[hemangiosarcoma]]s. Marked splenomegaly may result in the spleen occupying a large portion of the left side of the abdomen.

The spleen is the largest collection of [[lymphoid tissue]] in the body. It is normally palpable in preterm infants, in 30% of normal, full-term [[neonates]], and in 5% to 10% of [[infants]] and [[toddlers]]. A spleen easily palpable below the [[costal margin]] in any child over the age of 3â€“4 years should be considered abnormal until proven otherwise.

Splenomegaly can result from antigenic stimulation (e.g., infection), obstruction of blood flow (e.g., portal vein obstruction), underlying functional abnormality (e.g., [[hemolytic anemia]]), or infiltration (e.g., [[leukemia]] or storage disease, such as [[Gaucher's disease]]). The most common cause of acute splenomegaly in children is viral infection, which is transient and usually moderate. Basic work-up for acute splenomegaly includes a [[complete blood count]] with differential, platelet count, and [[reticulocyte]] and atypical lymphocyte counts to exclude hemolytic anemia and leukemia. Assessment of [[IgM]] antibodies to viral capsid antigen (a rising [[titer]]) is indicated to confirm [[Epstein-Barr virus]] or [[cytomegalovirus]]. Other infections should be excluded if these tests are negative.

== Asplenia ==
{{Main|Asplenia}}
Asplenia is the absence of normal spleen function. It predisposes to some [[sepsis|septicemia]] infections. Therefore, vaccination and antibiotic measures are essential in such cases. There are multiple causes:
 
* Some people [[Congenital disorder|congenitally]] completely lack a spleen, although this is rare.

* [[Sickle-cell disease]] can cause a functional [[asplenia]] (or [[autosplenectomy]]) by causing [[infarction]]s of the spleen during repeated sickle-cell crises.

* It may be removed [[surgery|surgically]] (known as a [[splenectomy]]), but this is rarely performed, as it carries a high risk of infection and other adverse effects. Indications include following abdominal injuries with rupture and [[hemorrhage]] of the spleen, or in the treatment of certain [[blood diseases]] ([[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]], hereditary [[spherocytosis]], etc.), certain forms of [[lymphoma]] or for the removal of splenic tumors or cysts.
