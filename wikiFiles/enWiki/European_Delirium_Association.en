The '''European Delirium Association''' was founded in 2005 in order to promote research, education and clinical practice in [[delirium]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=MACLULLICH|first=A|coauthors=MEAGHER, D, LAURILA, J, KALISVAART, K|title=The European Delirium Association|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=1 March 2007|year=2007|volume=62|issue=3|pages=397â€“398|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.01.004}}</ref> It serves as a forum to bring together interested researchers, practitioners and policy makers.

In 2006, the inaugural meeting brought together 50 delegates from the disciplines central to delirium including doctors, nurses, and psychologists working in geriatrics, psychiatry, palliative medicine, paediatrics, and neurology. The association has a broad remit, covering research, clinical practice, and promotion of better care through campaigning at local, national, and international levels. The annual scientific congress addresses a wide spectrum of delirium issues including the latest developments in epidemiology, pathophysiology, phenomenology, treatment (including service models), and delirium advocacy.

In 2011, the EDA received the first Delirium Champion Award from the American Delirium Society.

The [http://www.europeandeliriumassociation.com/news/ Annals of Delirium] is the official publication of the EDA.
