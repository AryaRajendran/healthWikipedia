'''Urology''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:οὖρον|οὖρον]] - oûron'', "urine" and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' "study of") is the branch of medicine that focuses on the surgical and medical diseases of the male and female [[urinary tract]] system and the [[male reproductive organs]]. The organs under the domain of urology include the [[kidney]]s, [[adrenal glands]], [[ureter]]s, [[urinary bladder]], [[urethra]], and the male reproductive organs ([[testes]], [[epididymis]], [[vas deferens]], [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[prostate]] and [[penis]]). 

The urinary and reproductive tracts are closely linked, and disorders of one often affect the other. Thus a major spectrum of the conditions managed in urology exists under the domain of [[genitourinary disorders]]. Urology combines the management of medical (i.e., non-surgical) conditions such as [[urinary tract infection]]s and [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], with the management of surgical conditions such as bladder or [[prostate cancer]], [[kidney stone]]s, congenital abnormalities, traumatic injury, and [[stress incontinence]]. 

Urology has traditionally been on the cutting-edge of surgical technology in the field of medicine. Urologists are well-trained in minimally-invasive techniques, employing real-time ultrasound guidance, fiber-optic endoscopic equipment, and various lasers in the treatment of multiple benign and malignant conditions.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17393172</ref> In addition, urologists are pioneers in the use of robotics in laparoscopic surgery. Urology is closely related to, and often collaborate with the medical fields of [[oncology]], [[nephrology]], [[gynecology]], [[andrology]], pediatric surgery, colorectal surgery, [[gastroenterology]], and [[endocrinology]].

Urology is one of the most competitive and highly sought-after specialties to enter for [[physician]]s, with new urologists comprising less than 1.5% of U.S. medical school graduates each year.<ref>Ahmed K, Jawad M, Dasgupta P, Darzi A, Athanasiou T, Khan MS. Assessment and maintenance of competence in urology. Nature Rev Urol. 2010 Jul;7(7):403-1</ref><ref>https://www.aamc.org/data/facts/</ref> Urologic surgeons, or '''urologists''', undergo a rigorous post-graduate surgical training period for a minimum duration of five years, of which 12 months must be completed in general surgery and 36 months must be completed in clinical urology. The remaining 12 months are spent in general surgery, urology or other clinical disciplines relevant to urology.<ref>http://www.auanet.org/content/residency/what-is-urology.cfm</ref> Upon successful completion of a residency program, some urologists choose to undergo further advanced training in a sub-specialty area of expertise through a fellowship lasting an additional 12 to 36 months.

==Subdisciplines==
As a medical discipline that involves the care of many organs and physiological systems, urology can be broken down into several subdisciplines. At many larger academic centers and university hospitals that excel in patient care and clinical research, urologists often specialize within a particular subdiscipline of urology.

===Endourology===
Endourology is the branch of urology that deals with the closed manipulation of the urinary tract.<ref>{{cite web|title=Website of the Endourologic Society|url=http://www.endourology.org/}}</ref> It has lately grown to include all urologic minimally invasive surgical procedures. As opposed to open surgery, endourology is performed using small cameras and instruments inserted into the urinary tract. Transurethral surgery has been the cornerstone of endourology. Most of the urinary tract can be reached via the urethra, enabling prostate surgery, surgery of tumors of the [[urothelium]], stone surgery, and simple urethral and ureteral procedures. Recently, the addition of [[laparoscopy]] and robotics has further subdivided this branch of urology.

===Laparoscopy===
[[Laparoscopy]] is a rapidly evolving branch of urology and has replaced some open surgical procedures. [[Robotic surgery|Robot-assisted surgery]] of the prostate, kidney, and ureter has been expanding this field. Today, many prostatectomies in the United States are carried out by so-called robotic assistance. This has created controversy, however, as robotics greatly increase the cost of surgery and the benefit for the patient may or may not proportional to the extra cost. Moreover, current (2011) market situation for robotic equipment is a de facto monopoly of one publicly held corporation<ref>{{cite web|title=Intuitive Surgical, Inc.|url=http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/}}</ref> which further fuels the cost-effectiveness controversy.

===Urologic oncology===
Urologic oncology concerns the surgical treatment of malignant genitourinary diseases such as cancer of the prostate, adrenal glands, bladder, kidneys, ureters, testicles, and penis. The treatment of genitourinary cancer is managed by either a urologist or an oncologist, depending on the treatment type (surgical or medical). Most urologic oncologists in western countries use minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopy or endourology, robotic-assisted surgery) to manage urologic cancers amenable to surgical management.

===Neurourology===
Neurourology concerns [[nervous system]] control of the genitourinary system, and of conditions causing abnormal [[urination]]. Neurological diseases and disorders such as a stroke, [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[spinal cord injury]] can disrupt the lower urinary tract and result in conditions such as [[urinary incontinence]], [[detrusor]] overactivity, [[urinary retention]], and [[bladder sphincter dyssynergia|detrusor sphincter dyssynergia]]. [[Urodynamic testing|Urodynamic studies]] play an important diagnostic role in neurourology. Therapy for nervous system disorders includes clean intermittent self-catheterization of the bladder, anticholinergic drugs, injection of Botulinum toxin into the bladder wall and advanced and less commonly used therapies such as sacral [[neuromodulation]].
Less marked neurological abnormalities can cause urological disorders as well—for example, abnormalities of the sensory nervous system are thought by many researchers to play a role in disorders of painful or frequent urination (e.g. painful bladder syndrome also known as [[interstitial cystitis]]).

===Pediatric urology===
[[Pediatric]] urology concerns urologic disorders in [[child]]ren. Such disorders include [[cryptorchidism]] (undescended testes), congenital abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, [[enuresis]], underdeveloped genitalia (due to delayed growth or delayed puberty, often an endocrinological problem), and [[vesicoureteral reflux]].

===Andrology===
[[Andrology]] focuses on the male reproductive system. It is mainly concerned with male infertility, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory disorders. Since male sexuality is largely controlled by hormones, andrology overlaps with endocrinology. Surgery in this field includes fertilization procedures, vasectomy reversals, and the implantation of penile prostheses. Vasectomies may also be included here, although most urologists perform this procedure.

===Reconstructive urology===
Reconstructive urology is a highly specialized field of urology that restores both structure and function to the genitourinary tract.  Prostate procedures, full or partial hysterectomies, trauma (auto accidents, gunshot wounds, industrial accidents, straddle injuries, etc.), disease, obstructions, blockages (e.g., urethral strictures), and occasionally, childbirth, can necessitate require reconstructive surgery. The urinary bladder, ureters (the tubes that lead from the kidneys to the urinary bladder) and genitalia are other examples of reconstructive urology.

===Urogynecology===
[[Urogynecology]] is a branch dealing with overactive bladder, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence. Thorough knowledge of the female pelvic floor together with urodynamic skills are necessary to diagnose and treat these disorders. Depending on the cause of the individual problem, a medical or surgical treatment can be the solution.

==Organizations==
There are a number of peer-reviewed journals and publications about urology, 
including ''[[The Journal of Urology]]'', the ''[[African Journal of Urology]]'', ''[[British Journal of Urology International]]'', ''[[Indian Journal of Urology]]'', ''[[Nature Reviews Urology]]'', and ''[[Urology (journal)|Urology]]''.

There are national organizations such as the [[American Urological Association]], [[European Association of Urology]], and [[The Society for Basic Urologic Research]]. Urology is also included under the auspices of the [[International Continence Society]]. 

Teaching organizations include the [[European Board of Urology]], as well as the [[Vattikuti Urology Institute]] in [[Detroit]], which also hosts an annual [[International Robotic Urology Symposium]] devoted to new technologies. The American non-profit [[IVUMed]] teaches urology in [[developing countries]].
