'''Focal segmental [[glomerulosclerosis]]''' ('''FSGS''') is a cause of [[nephrotic syndrome]] in children and adolescents, as well as an important cause of [[kidney failure]] in adults.<ref name="Robbins_2005">{{cite book |editor=Kumar V, Fausto N, Abbas A |title=Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=7th |pages=982–3 |publisher=Saunders |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7216-0187-8 }}</ref> It is also known as "focal glomerular sclerosis" or "focal nodular glomerulosclerosis."<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000045124|focal segmental glomerulosclerosis}}</ref> It accounts for about a sixth of the cases of [[nephrotic syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/RENAHTML/RENAL083.html |title=Renal Pathology |accessdate=2008-11-25}}</ref> ([[Minimal change disease]] (MCD) is by far the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children:  MCD and primary FSGS may have a similar cause.<ref name="Robbins_2005" />)

==Appearance==
The individual components of the name refer to the appearance of the kidney tissue on [[biopsy]]: ''focal''—only some of the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]] are involved (as opposed to diffuse), ''segmental''—only part of each glomerulus is involved (as opposed to global),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pathweb.uchc.edu/eAtlas/Code/1505.HTM |title=Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis of the Kidney |accessdate=2008-11-25}}</ref> ''[[glomerulosclerosis]]''—refers to scarring of the [[glomerulus]] (a part of the [[nephron]] (the functional unit of the [[kidney]])). The glomerulosclerosis is usually indicated by heavy PAS staining and findings of IgM and C3 in sclerotic segment.<ref name="Renal Pathology Medical school notes">{{cite web |url=http://sites.google.com/site/medschoolnotesorg/pathology/kidney |title=Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis of the Kidney |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>

==Classification==
Depending on the cause it is broadly classified as:
*Primary, when no underlying cause is found; usually presents as [[nephrotic syndrome]]
*Secondary, when an underlying cause is identified; usually presents with [[kidney failure]] and [[proteinuria]]. This is actually a heterogeneous group including numerous causes such as
**Infections such as [[HIV]] (known as [[HIV-Associated Nephropathy]])
**Toxins and drugs such as [[heroin]] and [[pamidronate]]
**Familial forms
**Secondary to [[nephron]] loss and [[hyperfiltration]], such as with chronic [[pyelonephritis]] and [[reflux]], morbid [[obesity]], [[diabetes mellitus]]

There are many other classification schemes also.

===Pathologic variants===
[[Image:Collapsing_glomerulopathy_-_very_high_mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of the collapsing variant of FSGS (collapsing glomerulopathy). A collapsed [[glomerulus]] is seen at the top, right-of-centre. [[PAS stain]]. [[Kidney biopsy]].]]
Five mutually exclusive variants of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis may be distinguished by the pathologic findings seen on [[renal biopsy]]:<ref name="thomas">{{cite journal |author=Thomas DB, Franceschini N, Hogan SL, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical and pathologic characteristics of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis pathologic variants |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=920–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16518352 |doi=10.1038/sj.ki.5000160 |url=}}</ref>
# Collapsing variant
# Glomerular tip lesion variant
# Cellular variant
# Perihilar variant
# Not otherwise specified (NOS) variant.
			
Recognition of these variants may have prognostic value in individuals with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (i.e. where no underlying cause is identified). The collapsing variant is associated with higher rate of progression to [[end-stage renal disease]], whereas glomerular tip lesion variant has low rate of progression to end-stage renal disease in most patients.<ref name="thomas" /> Cellular variant shows similar clinical presentation to collapsing and glomerular tip variant but has intermediate outcomes between these two variants. However, because collapsing and glomerular tip variant show overlapping pathologic features with cellular variant, this intermediate difference in clinical outcomes may reflect sampling bias in cases of cellular focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (i.e. unsampled collapsing variant or glomerular tip variant). The prognostic significance of perihilar and NOS variants has not yet been determined. The NOS variant is the most common subtype.<ref name="thomas" />

==Causes==
There are currently several known genetic causes of the hereditary forms of FSGS.

! Description
|-
| FSGS1: [[ACTN4]]
| {{OMIM2|603278}}
| The first gene involved with this disorder is [[ACTN4]], which encodes alpha-actinin 4. This protein crosslinks bundles of actin filaments and is present in the [[podocyte]]. Mutations in this protein associated with FSGS result in increased affinity for actin binding, formation of intracellular aggregates, and decreased protein half-life. While it is unclear how these effects might lead to FSGS there are a number of theories. Firstly, protein aggregation may have a toxic effect on the podocyte. Secondly, decreased protein half-life or increased affinity for actin binding may alter actin polymerization and thereby affect the podocytes cytoskeletal architecture.<ref name="Mukerji_2007">{{cite journal |author=Mukerji N, Damodaran TV, Winn MP |title=TRPC6 and FSGS: The latest TRP channelopathy |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease |volume=1772 |issue= 8|pages=859–68 |year=2007 |pmid=17459670 |doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2007.03.005 |url=}}</ref>
|-
| FSGS2: [[TRPC6]]
| {{OMIM2|603965}}
| A second gene associated with FSGS is [[TRPC6]], which encodes a member of the canonical family of [[Transient receptor potential|TRP channel]]s. This family of ion channels conduct cations in a largely non-selective manner. As with ACTN4, TRPC6 is expressed in [[podocyte]]s. While TRP channels can be activated through a variety of methods, TRPC6 is known to be activated by [[phospholipase C]] stimulation. There are at least 6 mutations in this channel, located throughout the channel. At least one of these mutations, P112Q, leads to increased intracellular [[calcium]] [[Wiktionary:influx|influx]]. It is unclear how this might lead to FSGS, though it has been proposed that it may result in alteration of podocyte dynamics or podocytopenia.<ref name="Mukerji_2007" />
|-
| FSGS3: [[CD2AP]]
| {{OMIM2|607832}}
| Another gene that may be involved in hereditary forms of FSGS is the gene known as [[CD2AP]] (CD2 associated protein) or CMS (Cas binding protein with multiple SH3 domains). The protein expressed by this gene is expressed in podocytes where it interacts with [[FYN|fyn]] and [[synaptopodin]]. There is a report that a splicing mutation in this gene was found in two patients with HIV associated FSGS and this led to altered protein translation. This has been theorized to result in altered actin binding and, thus, alteration of the cytoskeletal podocyte architecture.<ref name="Mukerji_2007" />
|-
| FSGS4: [[APOL1]]
| {{OMIM2|612551}}
| In people of African descent, two common variants in [[APOL1]] have been associated with FSGS. It is believed that these variants arose as a defensive mechanism against [[Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense]] or some other sub-Saharan parasite despite conferring high susceptibility to FSGS when inherited from both parents.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Genovese G, Friedman DJ, Ross MD, Lecordier L, Uzureau P, Freedman BI, Bowden DW, Langefeld CD, Oleksyk TK, Uscinski Knob AL, Bernhardy AJ, Hicks PJ, Nelson GW, Vanhollebeke B, Winkler CA, Kopp JB, Pays E, Pollak MR. | title = Association of Trypanolytic ApoL1 Variants with Kidney Disease in African-Americans | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5993 | pages = 841–5 | year = 2010 | month = Jul | pmid =  20647424 | pmc =  2980843| doi = 10.1126/science.1193032 }}</ref>
|-
| FSGS5: [[INF2]]
| {{OMIM2|613237}}
| Another gene associated with FSGS is [[INF2]], which encodes a member of the formin family of actin-regulating proteins. The observation that alterations in this podocyte-expressed formin cause FSGS emphasizes the importance of fine regulation of actin polymerization in podocyte function.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brown EJ, Schlöndorff JS, Becker DJ, Tsukaguchi H, Uscinski AL, Higgs HN, Henderson JM, Pollak MR. | title = Mutations in the formin protein INF2 cause focal segmental glomerulosclerosis | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 72–6 | year = 2010 | month = Jan | pmid = 20023659 | pmc =  2980844| doi = 10.1038/ng.505 }}</ref>

| SRN1: [[NPHS2]]
| {{OMIM2|600995}}
| Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, which codes for the protein called podocin,<ref name="pmid12464671">{{cite journal |author=Tsukaguchi H, Sudhakar A, Le TC, ''et al.'' |title=NPHS2 mutations in late-onset focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: R229Q is a common disease-associated allele |journal=J.

==Diagnosis==
===Symptoms and signs===
In children and some adults, FSGS presents as a [[nephrotic syndrome]], which is characterized by [[edema]] (associated with weight gain), [[hypoalbuminemia]] (low [[human serum albumin|serum albumin]], a [[protein]] in the blood), [[hyperlipidemia]] and [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure). In adults it may also present as [[kidney failure]] and [[proteinuria]], without a full-blown [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Some researchers found [[SuPAR]] as cause of FSGS.

===Tests===
*[[Urinalysis]]
*[[Blood tests]] – cholesterol
*Kidney [[Needle aspiration biopsy|biopsy]]

===Differential diagnosis===
*[[Minimal change disease]], especially in children
*Several others

==Treatment==
{{sources|section|date=February 2013}}
* Salt restriction and [[diuretics]], such as [[furosemide]], for edema
* [[Antihypertensives]] (especially [[ACE inhibitors|ACEI]]s) – if the blood pressure is too high
* treat present [[hyperlipidemia]] (e.g. [[statin]]s, [[fibrate]]s; although fibrates are contraindicated in renal failure)
* [[Aldosterone antagonist]] to decrease proteinuria and thus offer a degree of reno-protection
* [[Angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]
* [[Corticosteroid]]s, such as [[prednisone]] – based on the clinical judgment of [[physician]] (no broad consensus/guideline){{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* [[Cytotoxic]]s, such as [[cyclophosphamide]] may be used to induce remission in patients presenting with FSGS refractory to corticosteroids, or in patients who do not tolerate steroids.
* [[Plasmapheresis]] – blood cleansing using a machine to remove the patient's [[blood plasma]] and replacing it with donor plasma.
* [[Vitamin E]]
* [[Fish oil]]
* [[Immunosuppressive drug]]s
*None – sometimes none of the above works and the patient will require [[dialysis]] with possibly later [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of a new kidney.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== Notable patients ==
Former NBA basketball players [[Sean Elliott]] and [[Alonzo Mourning]] have both survived bouts with FSGS. Mourning is an Ambassador to [http://www.nephcure.org The NephCure Foundation]. Pro bodybuilder [[Flex Wheeler]] was diagnosed with FSGS and had a [[kidney transplant]].
