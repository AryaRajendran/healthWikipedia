A '''heavy metal''' is a member of a loosely defined subset of elements that exhibit metallic properties.  It mainly includes the [[transition metal]]s, some [[metalloid]]s, [[lanthanide]]s, and [[actinide]]s. Many different definitions have been proposed—some based on [[density]], some on [[atomic number]] or [[atomic weight]], and some on [[chemical properties]] or [[toxic metal|toxicity]].<ref name="Duffus"/> The term ''heavy metal'' has been called a "misinterpretation" in an [[IUPAC]] technical report due to the contradictory definitions and its lack of a "coherent scientific basis".<ref name=Duffus>John H. Duffus ""Heavy metals" a meaningless term? (IUPAC Technical Report)" Pure and Applied Chemistry, 2002, Vol. 74, pp. 793–807. {{doi|10.1351/pac200274050793}}</ref> There is an alternative term ''[[toxic metal]]'', for which no consensus of exact definition exists either. As discussed below, depending on context, heavy metal can include elements lighter than carbon and can exclude some of the heaviest metals.  Heavy metals occur naturally in the ecosystem with large variations in concentration. In modern times, anthropogenic sources of heavy metals, i.e. pollution, have been introduced to the ecosystem. 

== Relationship to living organisms ==
Living organisms require varying amounts of "heavy metals". [[Iron]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[manganese]], [[molybdenum]], and [[zinc]] are required by [[humans]].   Excessive levels can be damaging to the organism. Other heavy metals such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[plutonium]], and [[lead]] are [[toxic metal]]s and their accumulation over time in the bodies of [[animal]]s can cause serious illness. Certain elements that are normally toxic are, for certain organisms or under certain conditions, beneficial.  Examples include [[vanadium]], [[tungsten]], and even [[cadmium]]. 

Heavy metal toxicity can result in damaged or reduced mental and [[Central nervous system|central nervous function]], lower energy levels, and damage to [[blood]] composition, [[lung]]s, [[kidneys]], [[liver]], and other vital organs. Long-term exposure may result in slowly progressing physical, muscular, and neurological degenerative processes that mimic [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[muscular dystrophy]], and [[multiple sclerosis]]. [[Allergies]] are not uncommon, and repeated long-term contact with some metals (or their compounds) may cause [[cancer]].

Heavy metals have effect on stability of [[colloid]]s. [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] and [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells are colloids, too. Colloids are sensitive to change of ion or heavy metal concentration and it leads to violation of colloid stability and subsequent disintegration.

== Heavy metal pollution ==

Motivations for controlling heavy metal concentrations in gas streams are diverse. Some of them are dangerous to health or to the environment (e.g. mercury, cadmium, lead, chromium),<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Heavy_metal?topic=49498 ''Heavy metal''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment.] eds. E. Monosson & C. Cleveland. Washington, D.C.</ref> some may cause corrosion (e.g., lead), some are harmful in other ways (e.g. arsenic may pollute catalysts). Within the European community the eleven elements of highest concern are arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, tin, and thallium, the emissions of which are regulated in waste incinerators. Some of these elements are actually necessary for humans in minute amounts (cobalt, copper, chromium, manganese, nickel) while others are carcinogenic or toxic, affecting, among others, the central nervous system (manganese, mercury, lead, arsenic), the kidneys or liver (mercury, lead, cadmium, copper) or skin, bones, or teeth (nickel, cadmium, copper, chromium).<ref Name="Ron">Ron Zevenhoven, Pia Kilpinen: ''[http://eny.tkk.fi/research/combustion_waste/publications/gasbook/index.htm Control of Pollutants in Flue Gases and Fuel Gases]''. [[TKK]], Espoo 2001.</ref>

Heavy metal pollution can arise from many sources but most commonly arises from the purification of metals, e.g., the [[smelting]] of copper and the preparation of [[nuclear fuel]]s.  Electroplating is the primary source of chromium and [[cadmium]]. Cadmium, lead and zinc are released in tiny particulates as dust from rubber tires on road surfaces;  the small size allows these toxic metals to rise on the wind to be inhaled, or transported onto topsoil or edible plants.  

Through precipitation of their compounds or by ion exchange into [[soil contaminant|soils]] and [[bay mud|muds]], heavy metal pollutants can localize and lay dormant, which can have severe effects on the environment.  Unlike organic pollutants, heavy metals do not decay and thus pose a different kind of challenge for remediation. Plants, mushrooms, or microrganisms are occasionally successfully used to remove some heavy metals such as mercury.  Plants which exhibit hyper accumulation can be used to remove heavy metals from soils by concentrating them in their bio matter. Some treatment of mining tailings has occurred where the vegetation is then incinerated to recover the heavy metals.

One of the largest problems associated with the persistence of heavy metals is the potential for [[bioaccumulation]] and [[biomagnification]] causing heavier exposure for some organisms than is present in the environment alone. [[Coastal fish]] (such as the [[smooth toadfish]]) and [[seabird]]s (such as the [[Atlantic Puffin]]) are often monitored for the presence of such contaminants.

== Medicine ==
In medical usage, heavy metals are loosely defined<ref name="Duffus"/> and include all [[toxic metal]]s irrespective of their atomic weight: "heavy metal poisoning" can possibly include excessive amounts of [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[aluminium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[cadmium]], [[beryllium]] or such a semimetal as [[arsenic]]. This definition excludes [[bismuth]], the heaviest of approximately stable elements, because of its low toxicity.

[[Minamata disease]] results from [[mercury poisoning]], and [[itai-itai disease]] from [[cadmium poisoning]].

== Hazardous materials ==
Heavy metals in a [[hazardous materials]] (or "hazmat") setting are for the most part classified in "Misc." on the UN model hazard class, but they are sometimes labeled as a poison when being transported.

==Nuclear technology==

[[Burnup]] of [[nuclear fuel]] is expressed in [[gigawatt]]-days per [[metric ton]] of heavy metal, where heavy metal means [[actinide]]s like [[thorium]], [[uranium]], [[plutonium]], etc., including both [[fissile]] and [[fertile material]]. It does not include elements such as oxygen that may be bonded to the fuel metals, or [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]] materials such as [[zirconium]], which might be considered heavy metals by some other standards.
