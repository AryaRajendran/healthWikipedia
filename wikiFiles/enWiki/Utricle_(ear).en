The '''utricle''', or utriculus ([[Latin]]: ''utriculus'', diminutive of ''utur'', meaining "leather bag"), along with the [[saccule]] is one of the two [[otolith]] organs located in the [[vertebrate]] [[inner ear]]. The utricle and the saccule are parts of the balancing apparatus (membraneous labyrinth) located within the vestibule of the bony labyrinth (small oval chamber).<ref>Moores, Kieth L. "Essential Clinical Anatomy" Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; Second Edition (2002).</ref> These use small stones and a viscous fluid to stimulate hair cells to detect motion and orientation.

== Anatomy ==

The utricle is larger than the saccule and is of an oblong form, compressed transversely, and occupies the upper and back part of the [[Vestibule of the ear|vestibule]], lying in contact with the [[recessus ellipticus]] and the part below it. 

Within the Utricle is a small 2 by 3 mm patch of hair cells called the macula utricle. The macula utricle, which lies horizontally on the floor of the utricle, contains the hair cells. These hair cells are mechanoreceptors which consist of 40 to 70 steriocilia and only one true cilium called a [[kinocilium]]. The kinocilium is the only sensory aspect of the hair cell and is what causes hair cell polarization. The tips of these steriocilia and kinocilium are embedded in a gelatinous [[otolithic membrane]].<ref>Johnsson, Lars-GÃ¶ran, Joseph E. Hawkins, and Jr. "Otolithic Membranes of the Saccule and Utricle in Man." JSTOR. Web. 11 Dec. 2012.</ref> This membrane is weighted with calcium carbonate-protein granules called otoliths. The otolithic membrane adds weight to the tops of the hair cells and increases their inertia. The addition in weight and inertia is vital to the utricle's ability to detect linear acceleration, as described below, and to determine the orientation of the head.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy and Physiology The Unity of Form and Function. McGraw-Hill Science Engineering, 2009. Print.</ref>

The utricle contains mechanoreceptors called hair cells that distinguish between degrees of tilting of the head, thanks to their apical [[stereocilia]] set-up. These are covered by [[otolith]] which, due to gravity, pull on the stereocilia and tilt them. Depending on whether the tilt is in the direction of the [[kinocilium]] or not, the resulting hair cell polarisation is excitatory (depolarising) or inhibitory (hyperpolarisation), respectively.  Any orientation of the head causes a combination of stimulation to the utricles and saccules of the two ears.  The brain interprets head orientation by comparing these inputs to each other and to other input from the eyes and stretch receptors in the neck, thereby detecting whether only the head is tilted or the entire body is tipping.  The inertia of the otolithic membranes is especially important in detecting linear acceleration.  Suppose you are sitting in a car at a stoplight and then begin to move.  The otolithic membrane of the [[macula utriculi]] briefly lags behind the rest of the tissues, bends the stereocilia backwards, and stimulates the cells.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: the Unity of Form and Function. Dubuque: McGraw-Hill, 2010. Print.</ref> This signal to the vestibular nerve (which takes it to the brainstem) does not adapt with time. The effect of this is that, for example, an individual lying down to sleep will continue to detect that they are lying down hours later when they awaken.

Labyrinthine activity responsible for the [[nystagmus]] induced by off-vertical axis rotation arises in the otolith organs and couples to the oculomotor system through the velocity storage mechanism.<ref>Cohen, B., J. Suzuki, and T. Raphan. "Role of the Otolith Organs in Generation of Horizontal Nystagmus: Effects of Selective Labyrinthine Lesions." Brain Research 276.1 (1983): 159-64. Print.</ref>

That portion which is lodged in the recess forms a pouch or cul-de-sac, the floor and anterior wall of which are thickened and form the '''macula acustica utriculi''', which receives the utricular filaments of the [[acoustic nerve]]. 

The cavity of the utricle communicates behind with the [[semicircular ducts]] by five orifices.

The '''ductus utriculosaccularis''' comes off of the anterior wall of the utricle and opens into the [[ductus endolymphaticus]].
