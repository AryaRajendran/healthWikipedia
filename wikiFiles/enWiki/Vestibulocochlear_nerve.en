The '''vestibulocochlear nerve (auditory vestibular nerve)'''<ref>Kolb, Bryan, and Ian Q. Whishaw. An Introduction to Brain and Behaviour. 2nd ed. New York City: Worth Publishers, 2011. 56-57. Print.</ref> is the eighth of twelve [[cranial nerves]], and is responsible for transmitting sound and equilibrium (balance) information from the [[inner ear]] to the [[brain]]. The acoustic nerve is derived from the [[embryo]]nic [[otic placode]]. 

==Structure and function==
This is the [[nerve]] along which the sensory cells (the [[hair cells]]) of the [[inner ear]] transmit information to the [[brain]]. It consists of the [[cochlear nerve]], carrying information about [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and the [[vestibular nerve]], carrying information about [[Sense of balance|balance]]. 
It emerges from the [[pons]] and exits the inner [[human skull|skull]] via the [[internal acoustic meatus]] (or [[internal auditory meatus]]) in the [[temporal bone]].

==Innervations==
The vestibulocochlear nerve consists mostly of bipolar neurons and splits into two large divisions: the [[cochlear nerve]] and the [[vestibular nerve]].

The cochlear nerve travels away from the [[cochlea]] of the [[inner ear]] where it starts as the [[spiral ganglion|spiral ganglia]]. Processes from the [[organ of Corti]] conduct afferent transmission to the spiral ganglia. It is the inner hair cells of the organ of Corti that are responsible for activation of afferent receptors in response to pressure waves reaching the basilar membrane through the transduction of sound. The exact mechanism by which sound is transmitted by the neurons of the cochlear nerve is uncertain; the two competing theories are [[place theory]] and [[temporal theory]].

The vestibular nerve travels from the [[vestibular system]] of the inner ear. The vestibular ganglion houses the cell bodies of the bipolar neurons and extends processes to five sensory organs. Three of these are the cristae located in the ampullae of the [[semicircular canals]]. Hair cells of the cristae activate afferent receptors in response to rotational acceleration. The other two sensory organs supplied by the vestibular neurons are the maculae of the saccule and utricle. Hair cells of the maculae activate afferent receptors in response to linear acceleration.

==Symptoms of damage==
Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve may cause the following symptoms:
*hearing loss
*[[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]
*false sense of motion
*loss of equilibrium (in dark places)
*[[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]
*[[motion sickness]]
*gaze-evoked [[tinnitus]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Coad | first1 = ML | last2 = Lockwood | first2 = A | last3 = Salvi | first3 = R | last4 = Burkard | first4 = R | title = Characteristics of patients with gaze-evoked tinnitus | journal = Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 650â€“4 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11568674 }}</ref>

==Name==
Some older texts call the nerve the ''acoustic'' or ''auditory nerve'' [http://www.bartleby.com/107/203.html], but these terms have fallen out of widespread use because they fail to recognize the nerve's role in the vestibular system. ''Vestibulocochlear nerve'' is therefore preferred by most.
