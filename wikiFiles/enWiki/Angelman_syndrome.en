'''Angelman syndrome''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|eɪ|n|dʒ|əl|m|ə|n}}; abbreviated '''AS''') is a neuro-[[genetic disorder]] characterized by severe intellectual and [[developmental disability]], sleep disturbance, [[seizures]], jerky movements (especially hand-flapping), frequent laughter or smiling, and usually a happy demeanor.

AS is a classic example of [[genomic imprinting]] in that it is caused by deletion or inactivation of genes on the maternally inherited [[chromosome 15 (human)|chromosome 15]] while the paternal copy, which may be of normal sequence, is imprinted and therefore silenced. The sister syndrome, [[Prader-Willi syndrome]], is caused by a similar loss of paternally inherited genes and maternal imprinting. AS is named after a British [[pediatrician]], Dr. [[Harry Angelman]], who first described the [[syndrome]] in 1965.<ref name="Angelman">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.1965.tb07844.x|last=Angelman|first=Harvey|year=1965|title='Puppet' Children: A report of three cases|journal=Dev Med Child Neurol.|volume=7|pages=681–688|issue=6}}</ref> An older, alternative term for AS, '''happy puppet syndrome''', is generally considered [[pejorative]] and stigmatizing so it is no longer the accepted term, though it is sometimes still used as an informal term of diagnosis. People with AS are sometimes known as "angels", both because of the syndrome's name and because of their youthful, happy appearance.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Angelman.PNG|thumb|Chromosome 15]]

Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss of the normal maternal contribution to a region of chromosome 15, most commonly by deletion of a segment of that chromosome. Other causes include [[uniparental disomy]], [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]], or single gene mutation in that region. A healthy person receives two copies of chromosome 15, one from the mother, the other from the father. However, in the region of the chromosome that is critical for Angelman syndrome, the maternal and paternal contribution express certain genes very differently. This is due to sex-specific epigenetic [[imprinting (genetics)|imprinting]]; the biochemical mechanism is [[DNA methylation]]. In a normal individual, the maternal [[allele]] is expressed and the paternal allele is silenced. If the maternal contribution is lost or mutated, the result is Angelman syndrome. (When the paternal contribution is lost, by similar mechanisms, the result is [[Prader-Willi syndrome]].) It should be noted that the methylation test that is performed for Angelman syndrome (a defect in UBE3A) is actually looking for the gene's neighbour [[SNRPN]] (which has the opposite pattern of methylation).<ref>{{cite journal |author=White HE, Durston VJ, Harvey JF, Cross NC |title=Quantitative analysis of SNRPN(correction of SRNPN) gene methylation by pyrosequencing as a diagnostic test for Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=1005–13 |year=2006 |pmid=16574761 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2005.065086}}</ref>

Angelman syndrome can also be the result of mutation of a single gene. This gene (''[[UBE3A]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | author = Weeber E, Levenson J, Sweatt J | title = Molecular genetics of human cognition | journal = Mol Interv | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 376–91, 339 | year = 2002 | pmid = 14993414 | doi = 10.1124/mi.2.6.376}}</ref> part of the [[ubiquitin]] pathway) is present on both the maternal and paternal chromosomes, but differs in the pattern of [[methylation]] (imprinting). The paternal silencing of the ''UBE3A'' gene occurs in a brain region-specific manner; in the [[hippocampus]] and [[cerebellum]], the maternal allele is almost exclusively the active one. The most common genetic defect leading to Angelman syndrome is an ~4Mb (mega base) maternal deletion in chromosomal region 15q11-13 causing an absence of ''UBE3A'' expression in the paternally imprinted brain regions. ''UBE3A'' codes for an E6-AP [[ubiquitin ligase]], which chooses its substrates very selectively, and the four identified E6-AP substrates have shed little light on the possible molecular mechanisms underlying Angelman syndrome in humans.

Initial studies of mice that do not express maternal ''UBE3A'' show severe impairments in hippocampal memory formation. Most notably, there is a deficit in a learning paradigm that involves hippocampus-dependent contextual [[fear conditioning]]. In addition, maintenance of long-term [[synaptic plasticity]] in hippocampal area CA1 ''in vitro'' is disrupted in ''Ube3a''<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These results provide links amongst hippocampal [[synaptic plasticity]] ''in vitro'', formation of hippocampus-dependent memory ''in vivo'', and the molecular pathology of Angelman syndrome.

=== Neurophysiology ===

One of the more notable features of Angelman Syndrome (AS) is the syndrome’s [[pathognomonic]]  neurophysiological  findings. The [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG) in AS is usually very abnormal, and more abnormal than clinically expected.<ref name="williams2005">Williams C (2005) “Neurological aspects of the Angelman syndrome” Brain & Development 27: 88–94</ref> Three distinct interictal patterns are seen in these patients.<ref>Dan, B., Angelman syndrome: Current understanding and research prospects. Epilepsia, 2009. 50(11): p. 2331–2339.</ref> The most common pattern is a very large amplitude 2–3&nbsp;Hz rhythm most prominent in prefrontal leads. Next most common is a symmetrical 4–6&nbsp;Hz high voltage rhythm. The third pattern, 3–6&nbsp;Hz activity punctuated by spikes and sharp waves in occipital leads, is associated with eye closure. Paroxysms of laughter have no relation to the EEG, ruling out this feature as a [[Gelastic seizure|gelastic]] phenomenon.<ref name="williams2005"/>

It appears that the neurons of patients with Angelman syndrome are formed correctly, but they cannot function properly.{{fact|date=February 2013}}

== Diagnosis ==

The diagnosis of Angelman syndrome is based on:

* A history of delayed motor milestones and then later a delay in general development, especially of speech
* Unusual movements including fine tremors, jerky limb movements, hand flapping and a wide-based, stiff-legged gait.
* Characteristic facial appearance (but not in all cases).
* A history of epilepsy and an abnormal [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] tracing.
* A happy disposition with frequent laughter
* A deletion or inactivity on chromosome 15 by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) or by BACs-on-Beads technology.

Diagnostic criteria for the disorder were initially established in 1995 in collaboration with the Angelman syndrome Foundation (USA);<ref name="pmid7625452">{{cite journal |author=Williams CA |title=Angelman syndrome: consensus for diagnostic criteria.

== Treatment ==

There is currently no cure available. The epilepsy can be controlled by the use of one or more types of anticonvulsant medications. However, there are difficulties in ascertaining the levels and types of anticonvulsant medications needed to establish control, because AS is usually associated with having multiple varieties of seizures, rather than just the one as in normal cases of epilepsy. Many families use melatonin to promote sleep in a condition which often affects sleep patterns. Many individuals with Angelman syndrome sleep for a maximum of 5 hours at any one time. Mild laxatives are also used frequently to encourage regular bowel movements, and early intervention with [[Physical therapy|physiotherapy]] is important to encourage joint mobility and prevent stiffening of the joints.

Those with the syndrome are generally happy and contented people who like human contact and play. People with AS exhibit a profound desire for personal interaction with others. Communication can be difficult at first, but as a child with AS develops, there is a definite character and ability to make themselves understood. People with AS tend to develop strong non-verbal skills to compensate for their limited use of speech. It is widely accepted that their understanding of communication directed to them is much larger than their ability to return conversation. Most afflicted people will not develop more than 5–10 words, if any at all.<ref name="pmid11432411">{{cite journal |author=Andersen WH, Rasmussen RK, Strømme P |title=Levels of cognitive and linguistic development in Angelman syndrome: a study of 20 children |journal=Logopedics, phoniatrics, vocology |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=2–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11432411| doi = 10.1080/140154301300109044}}</ref>

Seizures are a consequence, but so is excessive laughter,<ref name="pmid7625442">{{cite journal | author = Buntinx IM | title = Clinical profile of Angelman syndrome at different ages | journal = [[American Journal of Medical Genetics]] | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 176–83 | year = 1995 | month = March | pmid = 7625442 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.1320560213 | url = | author-separator = , | author2 = Hennekam RC | author3 = Brouwer OF | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Stroink | first4 = Hans | last5 = Beuten | first5 = Joke | last6 = Mangelschots | first6 = Kathelijne | last7 = Fryns | first7 = J.

== Prognosis ==

The severity of the symptoms associated with Angelman syndrome varies significantly across the population of those affected. Some speech and a greater degree of self-care are possible among the least profoundly affected. Unfortunately, walking and the use of simple sign language may be beyond the reach of the more profoundly affected. Early and continued participation in physical, occupational (related to the development of fine-motor control skills), and communication (speech) therapies are believed to improve significantly the prognosis (in the areas of cognition and communication) of individuals affected by AS. Further, the specific genetic mechanism underlying the condition is thought to correlate to the general prognosis of the affected person. On one end of the spectrum, a mutation to the [[UBE3A]] [[gene]] is thought to correlate to the least affected, whereas larger deletions on chromosome 15 are thought to correspond to the most affected.

The clinical features of Angelman syndrome alter with age. As adulthood approaches, hyperactivity and poor sleep patterns improve. The seizures decrease in frequency and often cease altogether and the EEG abnormalities are less obvious. Medication is typically advisable to those with seizure disorders. Often overlooked is the contribution of the poor sleep patterns to the frequency and/or severity of the seizures. Medication may be worthwhile to help deal with this issue and improve the prognosis with respect to seizures and sleep. Also noteworthy are the reports that the frequency and severity of seizures temporarily escalate in pubescent Angelman syndrome girls, but do not seem to affect long-term health.

The facial features remain recognizable with age, but many adults with AS look remarkably youthful for their age.

[[Puberty]] and [[menstruation]] begin at around the average age.  [[Sexual development]] is thought to be unaffected, as evidenced by a single reported case of a woman with Angelman syndrome conceiving a female child who also had Angelman syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lossie A, Driscoll D | title = Transmission of Angelman syndrome by an affected mother | journal = Genet Med | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 262–6 | year = 1999| pmid = 11258627}}</ref>

The majority of those with AS achieve [[urinary incontinence|continence]] by day and some by night. Angelman syndrome is not a degenerative syndrome. Many people with AS improve their living skills with support.

Dressing skills are variable and usually limited to items of clothing without buttons or zippers. Most adults can eat with a knife or spoon and fork, and can learn to perform simple household tasks. General health is fairly good and life-span near average. Particular problems which have arisen in adults are a tendency to obesity (more in females), and worsening of [[scoliosis]]<ref name="pmid9072912">{{cite journal |author=Laan LA, den Boer AT, Hennekam RC, Renier WO, Brouwer OF |title=Angelman syndrome in adulthood |journal=Am. J. Med. Genet. |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=356–60 |year=1996 |pmid=9072912 | doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19961218)66:3<356::AID-AJMG21>3.0.CO;2-K}}</ref> if it is present. The affectionate nature which is also a positive aspect in the younger children may also persist into adult life where it can pose a problem socially, but this problem is not insurmountable.

== History ==
Harry Angelman, a pediatrician working in [[Warrington]], England, first reported three children with this condition in 1965.<ref name="Angelman" /> Angelman later described his choice of the title "Puppet Children" to describe these cases as being related to an oil painting he had seen while vacationing in Italy:

{{quote|text=The history of medicine is full of interesting stories about the discovery of illnesses. The saga of Angelman's syndrome is one such story. It was purely by chance that nearly thirty years ago (e.g., circa 1964) three handicapped children were admitted at various times to my children's ward in England. They had a variety of disabilities and although at first sight they seemed to be suffering from different conditions I felt that there was a common cause for their illness. The diagnosis was purely a clinical one because in spite of technical investigations which today are more refined I was unable to establish scientific proof that the three children all had the same handicap. In view of this I hesitated to write about them in the medical journals. However, when on holiday in Italy I happened to see an oil painting in the [[Castelvecchio Museum]] in [[Verona]] called . . . a Boy with a Puppet. The boy's laughing face and the fact that my patients exhibited jerky movements gave me the idea of writing an article about the three children with a title of Puppet Children. It was not a name that pleased all parents but it served as a means of combining the three little patients into a single group. Later the name was changed to Angelman syndrome. This article was published in 1965 and after some initial interest lay almost forgotten until the early eighties. |sign=Angelman quoted by Charles Williams<ref>{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Charles|url=http://www.angelman.org/stay-informed/facts-about-angelman-syndrome---7th-edition/harry-angelman-and-the-history-of-as/ |title=Harry Angelman and the History of AS |work=[http://www.angelman.org/stay-informed/ Stay informed] |location=USA |publisher=Angelman Syndrome Foundation|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zoasuqeU |archivedate=2011-07-01 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>}}

== Epidemiology ==

Though the prevalence of Angelman syndrome is not precisely known, there are some estimates. The best data available are from studies of school age children, ages 6–13 years, living in Sweden and from Denmark where the diagnosis of AS children in medical clinics was compared to an 8 year period of about 45,000 births. The Swedish study showed an AS [[prevalence]] of about 1/20,000<ref name="pmid8703225">{{cite journal |author=Steffenburg S, Gillberg CL, Steffenburg U, Kyllerman M |title=Autism in Angelman syndrome: a population-based study |journal=Pediatr.
