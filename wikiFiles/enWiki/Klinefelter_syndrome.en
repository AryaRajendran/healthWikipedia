'''Klinefelter syndrome''' or  '''Klinefelter's syndrome''', also '''47,XXY''' or '''XXY syndrome''', is a [[genetic disorder]] in which there is at least one extra [[X chromosome]] to a standard human male [[karyotype]], for a total of 47 [[chromosome]]s rather than the 46 found in genetically normal humans.<ref name = Visootsak >{{cite pmid | 17062147 }}</ref>  While females have an XX chromosomal makeup, and males an XY, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome have at least two X chromosomes and at least one [[Y chromosome]].<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |pages=179 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Because of the [[Trisomy|extra chromosome]], individuals with the condition are usually referred to as "XXY males", or "47,XXY males".<ref name="orrnichhd1993full">{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/klinefelter/ |title=Understanding Klinefelter Syndrome: A Guide for XXY Males and their Families |last=Bock |first=Robert  |accessdate=2007-04-07 | year = 1993 | month = August |work=NIH Pub.

Principal effects include [[hypogonadism]]  and reduced [[fertility]]. A variety of other physical and behavioural differences and problems are common, though severity varies and many XXY boys have few detectable symptoms.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{double image|right|Bodymorphproj mkg modA001 20070325 pos03.jpg|150|Bodymorphproj mkg modA001 20070325 pos04.jpg|132|A person with typical untreated ([[surgery]]/[[hormones]]) Klinefelter 46,XY/47,XXY mosaic, diagnosed at age 19. Scar from [[biopsy]] may be visible on left [[nipple]].}} 
There are many variances within the XXY population, just as within the [[46,XY]] population. While it is possible to characterise XXY males with certain body types and physical characteristics, that in itself should not be the method of identification as to whether or not someone has XXY. The only reliable method of identification is [[karyotype]] testing. The degree to which XXY males are affected, both physically and developmentally, differs widely from person to person.

===Physical===
As babies and children, XXY males may have weaker muscles and reduced strength. As they grow older, they tend to become taller than average. They may have less muscle control and coordination than other boys their age.<ref name = NICHD/>

During puberty, the physical traits of the syndrome become more evident; because these boys do not produce as much testosterone as other boys, they have a less muscular body, less facial and body hair, and broader hips.  As teens, XXY males may have larger breasts, weaker bones, and a lower energy level than other boys.<ref name = NICHD/>

By adulthood, XXY males look similar to males without the condition, although they are often taller. In adults, possible characteristics vary widely and include little to no signs of affectedness, a [[:wikt:lanky|lanky]], youthful build and facial appearance, or a rounded body type with some degree of [[gynecomastia]] (increased breast tissue).<ref name="smedj1986">{{Cite journal|last = Klinefelter |first = HF |title = Klinefelter syndrome: historical background and development|journal = South Med J |volume = 79 |issue = 9|pages = 1089–1093 |year = 1986 |pmid =  3529433|postscript = <!--None-->|doi = 10.1097/00007611-198609000-00012}}</ref> Gynecomastia is present to some extent in about a third of affected individuals, a slightly higher percentage than in the XY population.  About 10% of XXY males have [[gynecomastia]] noticeable enough that they may choose to have cosmetic surgery.<ref name="orrnichhd1993full"/>

Affected males are often [[Infertility|infertile]], or may have reduced fertility. Advanced reproductive assistance is sometimes possible.<ref name="fertstert2004">{{Cite journal|last = Denschlag|first = Dominik, MD|last2 = Clemens|first2 = Tempfer, MD|last3 = Kunze|first3 = Myriam, MD|last4 = Wolff|first4 = Gerhard, MD|last5 = Keck|first5 = Christoph, MD|title = Assisted reproductive techniques in patients with Klinefelter syndrome: A critical review|journal = Fertility and Sterility|volume = 82|issue = 4|pages = 775–779|date = October 2004|doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2003.09.085|pmid = 15482743|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> 

The term ''[[hypogonadism]]'' in XXY symptoms is often misinterpreted to mean "small testicles" or "[[micropenis|small penis]]". In fact, it means decreased testicular hormone/endocrine function. Because of this (primary) hypogonadism, individuals will often have a low serum [[testosterone]] level but high serum [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) levels.<ref name="nlhclingen2005">{{cite web| last = Leask | first = Kathryn | title = Klinefelter syndrome | work = National Library for Health, Specialist Libraries, Clinical Genetics | publisher = National Library for Health | month = October | year = 2005 | url = http://www.library.nhs.uk/genepool/ViewResource.aspx?resID=104897 | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}</ref> Despite this misunderstanding of the term, however, it is true that XXY men may also have [[microorchidism]] (i.e., small testicles).<ref name="nlhclingen2005" />

XXY males are also more likely than other men to have certain health problems, which typically affect females, such as [[autoimmune disorders]], [[breast cancer]], [[venous thrombosis|venous thromboembolic disease]], and [[osteoporosis]].<ref name = NICHD/><ref name="anticancerres1997">{{Cite journal|last = Hultborn |first = R|last2 = Hanson |first2 = C|last3 = Kopf |first3 = I|last4 = Verbiene |first4 = I|last5 = Warnhammar |first5 = E|last6 = Weimarck |first6 = A |title = Prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in male breast cancer patients |journal = Anticancer Res.|volume = 17 |issue = 6D |pages = 4293–4297 |date = 1997 November–December |pmid = 9494523|postscript = </ref>  In contrast to these potentially increased risks, it is currently thought that rare [[Sex linked|X-linked recessive]] conditions occur less frequently in XXY males than in normal XY males, since these conditions are transmitted by genes on the X chromosome, and people with two X chromosomes are typically only [[genetic carrier|carriers]] rather than affected by these X-linked recessive conditions.

==Cause==
[[File:XXY syndrome M.svg|thumb|left|240px|Birth of a cell with karyotype XXY due to a non-disjunction event of one X chromosome from a Y chromosome during [[meiosis I]] in the male.]]
[[File:XXY syndrome.svg|thumb|left|240px|Birth of a cell with karyotype XXY due to a non-disjunction event of one X chromosome during [[meiosis II]] in the female.]]

The extra X chromosome is retained because of a [[nondisjunction]] event during [[meiosis I]] (gametogenesis). Nondisjunction occurs  when homologous chromosomes, in this case the X and Y sex chromosomes, fail to separate, producing a sperm with an X and a Y chromosome.  Fertilizing a normal (X) egg produces an XXY offspring.
The XXY chromosome arrangement is one of the most common genetic variations from the XY [[karyotype]], occurring in about 1 in 500 live male births.<ref name=NICHD/>

Another mechanism for retaining the extra X chromosome is through a nondisjunction event during [[meiosis II]] in the female. Nondisjunction will occur when sister chromatids on the sex chromosome, in this case an X and an X, fail to separate. (meiosis) An XX egg is produced which, when fertilized with a Y sperm, yields XXY offspring.

In [[mammal]]s with more than one X chromosome, the [[gene]]s on all but one X chromosome are not expressed; this is known as [[X inactivation]]. This happens in XXY males as well as normal XX females.<ref name="arghg2005">{{cite journal | last1 = Chow | first1 = J | last2 = Yen | first2 = Z | last3 = Ziesche | first3 = S | last4 = Brown | first4 = C | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2005 | title = Silencing of the mammalian X chromosome | url = | journal = Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 69–92 | pmid = 16124854 | doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.6.080604.162350}}</ref> However, in XXY males, a few genes located in the [[pseudoautosomal region]]s of their X chromosomes, have corresponding genes on their Y chromosome and are capable of being expressed.<ref name="cogd2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Blaschke | first1 = RJ | last2 = Rappold | first2 = G | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2006 | title = The pseudoautosomal regions, SHOX and disease.

===Variations===
48,[[XXYY]] and 48,XXXY occur in 1 in 18,000–50,000 male births. The incidence of 49,XXXXY is 1 in 85,000 to 100,000 male births.<ref>{{cite pmid |7567329 }}</ref> These variations are extremely rare.  Additional chromosomal material can contribute to cardiac, neurological, orthopedic and other anomalies.  

Males with Klinefelter syndrome may have a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] 47,XXY/46,XY constitutional [[karyotype]] and varying degrees of spermatogenic failure. Mosaicism 47,XXY/46,XX with clinical features suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome is very rare. Thus far, only about 10 cases have been described in literature.<ref name="eurjmedgenet2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Velissariou | first1 = V | last2 = Christopoulou | first2 = S | last3 = Karadimas | first3 = C | last4 = Pihos | first4 = I | last5 = Kanaka-Gantenbein | first5 = C | last6 = Kapranos | first6 = N | last7 = Kallipolitis | first7 = G | last8 = Hatzaki | first8 = A. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2006 | title = Rare XXY/XX mosaicism in a phenotypic male with Klinefelter syndrome: case report | url = | journal = Eur J Med Genet | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 331–337 | pmid = 16829354 | doi=10.1016/j.ejmg.2005.09.001}}</ref>

Analogous XXY syndromes are known to occur in [[cat]]s -- specifically, the presence of [[calico cat|calico]] or [[tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] markings in male cats is an indicator of the relevant abnormal karyotype.

The standard diagnostic method is the analysis of the chromosomes' [[karyotype]] on [[lymphocyte]]s.

Other methods may be: research of high serum levels of [[gonadotropin]]s ([[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[luteinizing hormone]]), presence of [[azoospermia]], determination of the sex [[chromatin]],<ref name="pmid8085664">{{cite pmid | 8085664}}</ref> and [[Prenatal development|prenatally]] via [[chorionic villus sampling]] or [[amniocentesis]].  A 2002 literature review of elective [[abortion]] rates found that approximately 58% of pregnancies in the United States with a diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome were terminated.<ref>{{cite pmid |10521836 }}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
The symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome are often variable; therefore, a karyotype analysis should be ordered when small testes, infertility, [[gynecomastia]], long legs/arms, developmental delay, speech/language deficits, learning disabilities/academic issues and/or behavioral issues are present in an individual.<ref name = Visootsak/>  The [[differential diagnosis]] for the Klinefelter syndrome can include the following conditions: [[fragile X syndrome]], Kallman syndrome and [[Marfan syndrome]]. The cause of hypogonadism can be attributed to many other different medical conditions.

There have been some reports of individuals with Klinefelter syndrome who also have other chromosome abnormalities, such as Down syndrome.<ref name="pmid16958145">{{Cite journal |author=Sanz-Cortés M, Raga F, Cuesta A, Claramunt R, Bonilla-Musoles F |title=Prenatally detected double trisomy: Klinefelter and Down syndrome |journal=Prenat.

==Treatment==
The genetic variation is irreversible. Often individuals that have noticeable breast tissue or [[hypogonadism]] experience depression and/or social anxiety because they are outside of social norms.

== Prognosis ==
Children with a XXY differ little from other children. Although they can face problems during [[adolescence]], often emotional and behavioural, and difficulties at school, most of them can achieve full independence from their families in adulthood. Most can lead a normal, healthy life.

The results of a study carried out on 87 [[Australia]]n adults with the syndrome shows that those who have had a diagnosis and appropriate treatment from a very young age had a significant benefit with respect to those who had been diagnosed in adulthood.<ref name="pmid21546843">{{Cite journal |author=Herlihy AS, McLachlan RI, Gillam L, Cock ML, Collins V, Hallpmiday JL |title=The psychosocial impact of Klinefelter syndrome and factors influencing quality of life |journal=Genet.

According to a meta-analysis, the prevalence of the syndrome has increased over the past decades; however, this does not appear to be correlated with the increase of the age of the mother at conception, as no increase was observed in the prevalence of other [[trisomies]] of sex chromosomes ([[Triple X syndrome|XXX]] and [[XYY syndrome|XYY]]).<ref name="Morris-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = JK. | last2 = Alberman | first2 = E. | last3 = Scott | first3 = C. | last4 = Jacobs | first4 = P. | title = Is the prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome increasing? | journal = Eur J Hum Genet | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–70 | month = Feb | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201956 | PMID = 18000523 }}</ref>

==History==
The syndrome was named after [[Harry Klinefelter]], who, in 1942, worked with [[Fuller Albright]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and first described it in the same year.<ref name="kline1942"/><ref name="smedj1986"/>  The account given by Klinefelter came to be known as Klinefelter syndrome as his name appeared first on the published paper, and seminiferous tubule dysgenesis was no longer used.
