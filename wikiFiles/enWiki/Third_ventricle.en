The '''third ventricle''' (''ventriculus tertius'') is one of four connected fluid-filled cavities comprising the [[ventricular system]] within the human [[brain]]. It is a median cleft between the two [[Thalamus|thalami]], and is filled with [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). 

It is in the midline, between the left and right [[lateral ventricle]]s. Running through the third ventricle is the [[Interthalamic adhesion]], fibers which connect the two thalami.

==Communication==
It communicates with the [[lateral ventricle]]s anteriorly by the [[interventricular foramina (neural anatomy)|interventricular foramina]] (of Monro).

It communicates with the [[fourth ventricle]] posteriorly by the [[cerebral aqueduct]] (of Sylvius).

==Development==
The third ventricle, similarly to other parts of the ventricular system of the brain, develop from the central canal of the neural tube. Specifically, the third ventricle originates from the portion of the tube that is present in the developing prosencephalon, and subsequently in the developing encephalopathy.<ref>

==Boundaries==
It is bounded by the [[thalamus]] and [[hypothalamus]] on both the left and right sides. The [[lamina terminalis]] forms the anterior wall of the third ventricle.

==Protrusions==
There are two protrusions on the anterior aspect of the third ventricle:
* the [[supra-optic recess]] (above the [[optic chiasma]])
* the [[infundibular recess]] (above the [[pituitary]] stalk).

Additionally, there are two protrusions on the posterior aspect, above the [[cerebral aqueduct]]:
* the [[suprapineal recess]] (above the [[pineal gland]])
* the [[pineal recess]] (protruding into the stalk of the [[pineal gland]])

In casts of the ventricular system, a small 'hole' may be seen in the body of the third ventricle. This is formed where the two thalami are joined together at the [[interthalamic adhesion]] (not seen in all people).

It further proposes that this response is mediated by the acute release of an unknown (probably [[cytokine]]) inflammatory agent into the third ventricular space. In support of this suggestion imaging studies reveal that the third ventricle is enlarged in depressives <ref>Baumann B, Bornschlegl C, Krell D, Bogerts B.
