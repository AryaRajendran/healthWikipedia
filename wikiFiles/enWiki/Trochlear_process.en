The '''trochlear process''' ( '''peroneal trochlea''', or '''peroneal tubercle''', or '''fibular trochlea of calcaneus''') is an elevated ridge, or tubercle, or  projection from the lateral side of the [[calcaneus]]. It is located between the tendons of the [[peroneus longus]] and brevis. It separates the two oblique grooves of the lateral surface of the calcaneus. The trochlear process varies much in size in different bones.

Its chief anatomical significance is as a point of divergence of the previously common pathway shared by the distal tendons of [[peroneus longus]] and [[peroneus brevis]] ''en route'' to their distinct respective attachment sites.
