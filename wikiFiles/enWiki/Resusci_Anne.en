'''Resusci Anne''', also known as '''Rescue Anne''', '''Resusci Annie''' or '''CPR Annie''', is a training mannequin used for teaching [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) to both emergency workers and members of the general public.  Resusci Anne was developed by Norwegian toy maker [[Asmund Laerdal|Åsmund Laerdal]], based on the research of [[Peter Safar]] and [[James Elam]], and was first introduced in 1960.  The mannequin is designed to accurately simulate the human [[respiratory system]] and external body landmarks in order to facilitate training.

Since its original introduction, several different versions of Resusci Anne have also been introduced, including versions with computer monitoring, and versions that simulate other emergency medical conditions, such as severe wounds and trauma.

Trainees using the original Resusci Anne were expected to approach the mannequin. After receiving no response, the trainees then proceeded to administer CPR to the mannequin. This system was intended to teach trainees that not all victims require CPR—if a victim can respond when asked if he/she is okay, the victim does not need CPR.

The distinctive face of Resusci Anne was based on ''[[L'Inconnue de la Seine]]'', the [[death mask]] of an unidentified young woman reputedly drowned in the [[Seine|Seine River]] around the late 1880s.<ref>[http://www.laerdal.com/docid/1117082/The-Girl-from-the-River-Seine Laerdal company website: The Girl from the River Seine] URL accessed on 22nd of December, 2008</ref>
