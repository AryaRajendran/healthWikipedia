The fall in bed bug populations after the 1930s in the developed world is believed to be partly due to the usage of [[DDT]] to kill [[cockroach|cockroaches]].<ref name=Nurse09/> The invention of the [[vacuum cleaner]] and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role.<ref name=Nurse09/> Others believe it might simply be the cyclical nature of the organism.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Xavier |last1=Bonnefoy |first2=Helge |last2=Kampen |first3=Kevin |last3=Sweeney |title=Public health significance of urban pests |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2008 |isbn=978 92 890 7188 8 |page=131 |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98426/E91435.pdf |format=PDF |ref=harv}}</ref>

==Developed world==
Bed bugs are increasing in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia. The infestations have been occurring in a wide range of facilities in the developed world in recent years including: hotels (from backpacker to five star), overnight trains, private homes, cruise ships, schools, hospitals and homeless shelters.<ref name=Heu09/><ref name=Nurse09>{{cite journal |author=Krause-Parello CA, Sciscione P |title=Bedbugs: an equal opportunist and cosmopolitan creature |journal=J Sch Nurs |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=126–32 |date=April 2009|pmid=19233933 |doi=10.1177/1059840509331438 |url=}}</ref> These infestations are occasionally of both types of bed bugs (common and tropical).<ref name=Heu09/> The increased rates of infestations have been matched by increased media coverage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson AL, Leffler K |title=Bedbug infestations in the news: a picture of an emerging public health problem in the United States |journal=J Environ Health |volume=70 |issue=9 |pages=24–7, 52–3 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18517150 }}</ref> Pest management companies have also seen a many fold increase in calls regarding bed bugs during the 2000s.<ref>{{harvnb|Bonnefoy|Kampen|Sweeney|2008|p=134}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
Figures from one [[London]] borough show reported bed bug infestations doubling each year from 1995 to 2001. There is also evidence of a previous cycle of bed bug infestations in the U.K. in the mid-1980s.<ref name="king">{{cite journal |author=King, F; Dick, I; Evans, P. |title=Bed bugs in Britain. |journal=Parasitology Today |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=100–2 |year=1989 |quote=In the period 1985–1986, the Institution of Environmental Health Officers reported treating 7,771 infestations in England and Wales, and 6,179 infestations in 1986–1987.

===United States===
Bed bugs have been reported in all 50 states.<ref name=Heu09/> The U.S. [[National Pest Management Association]] reported a 71% increase in bed bug calls between 2000 and 2005.<ref name="voiland">{{cite journal |author=Voiland, Adam |title=You May not be Alone |journal=U.S. News & World Report |volume=143 |issue=2 |pages=53–54 |date=2007-07-16 |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/070708/16bedbug.htm}}</ref> The Steritech Group, a pest-management company based in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], claimed that 25% of the 700 hotels they surveyed between 2002 and 2006 needed bed bug treatment.

Numbers of reported incidents in [[New York City]] rose from 500 in 2004 to 10,000 in 2009.<ref name=nytakeover>{{cite news | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/08/19/are-bedbugs-taking-over-new-york-city/| title=Are Bedbugs Taking Over New York City? | author=Megan Gibson | work=Time Magazine | date=2010-08-19}}</ref> In August, 2010, bed bugs were found in the Elle Fashion Hachette building in New York City. After suspected infestation, a beagle trained in sniffing bed bugs was used to confirm their presence. Office workers were told to work from home while the building was being treated. Although largely thought to only cause problems in less maintained and dirty environments, there is an increasing popularity of bed bugs infesting indoor environments of high maintenance standards.<ref>New York Fashion.

One recent theory about bed bug reappearance is that they never truly disappeared from the United States, but may have been forced to alternative hosts. Consistent with this is the finding the bed bug DNA shows no evidence of an evolutionary bottleneck. Furthermore, investigators have found high populations of bed bugs at poultry facilities in [[Arkansas]]. Poultry workers at these facilities may be spreading bed bugs, unknowingly carrying them to their places of residence and elsewhere after leaving work.<ref name="urban">{{cite web |last = Austin | first = James |title = Bed Bugs |work = Urban and Structural Pests |publisher = Center for Urban & Structural Entomology, Department of Entomology, [[Texas A&M]] |year = 2008 |url = http://urbanentomology.tamu.edu/bedbugs/bedbugs.cfm |accessdate = 31 May 2010 }}

===Canada===
 	
Bed bug infestations have been becoming an increasing issue in urban environments. In a Toronto, Canada study, the mean number of treatments required per affected location was highest at dormitories, hotels, homeless shelters, and rooming houses. Suspected reasons for this increase include increasing world travel, high exchange rates of residents, reluctance to use insecticides because of concerns regarding toxicity, and insecticide resistance. 65 Toronto homeless shelters were surveyed and 31% reported past or present bed bug infestations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hwang SW, Svoboda TJ, De Jong IJ, Kabasele KJ, Gogosis E |title=Bed bug infestations in an urban environment |journal=Emerging Infect.

==Developing world==
Bed bugs have historically been only a particular problem in developed countries in which they occur both in rural settings and urban setting associated with overcrowding.<ref name=Heu09/>
