'''Tropical ulcer''' (also known as '''Aden ulcer,''' '''Jungle rot,''' '''Malabar ulcer,''' and  '''Tropical phagedena''')<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=Odom, Richard B.; Davidsohn, Israel; James, William D.; Henry, John Bernard; Berger, Timothy G.; Clinical diagnosis by laboratory methods; Dirk M. Elston |title=Andrews' diseases of the skin: clinical dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages=276–267 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> is a [[lesion]] occurring in [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]]. It is caused by a variety of [[microorganism]]s, including [[mycobacteria]]. It is common in [[tropical climates]].<ref>Stedman's Electronic Medical Dictionary</ref>

Ulcers occur on exposed parts of the body, primarily on anterolateral aspect of the lower limbs and may erode [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s, and sometimes, the [[bone]]s.<ref>Medcyclopedia-Tropical ulcer</ref>  These lesions may frequently develop on preexisting abrasions or sores sometimes beginning from a mere scratch.<ref name="Andrews" />

==Clinical features==
[[File:Tropical ulcer.jpg|left|thumb|This image depicted the left foot of a patient, which displayed this acute tropical ulcer upon his admission to toborra Goroka Hospital, in Goroka, New Guinea.]]
The vast majority of the tropical ulcers occur below the [[knee]], usually around the [[ankle]]. They may also occur on arms. They are often initiated by minor trauma, and subjects with poor nutrition are at higher risk. Once developed, the ulcer may become chronic and stable, but also it can run a destructive course with deep tissue invasion, [[osteitis]], and risk of [[amputation]]. Unlike [[Buruli ulcer]], tropical ulcers are very painful.<ref name="isbn0-632-06496-X">{{cite book |author=Gill, Geoffrey V.; Geoff Gill; Beeching, N. |title=Lecture notes on tropical medicine |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-632-06496-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Lesions begin with inflammatory [[papule]]s that progress into [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]] and rupture with the formation of an [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]].<ref name="Andrews" /> Chronic ulcers involve larger area and may eventually develop into [[epithelioma|squamous epithelioma]] after 10 years or more <ref name='td' />

==Microbiology==
There is now considerable evidence to suggest that this disease is an infection. ''F. ulcerans'' has recently been isolated from lesions and is unique to tropical ulcers.<ref name='td'>{{cite book|title=Tropical dermatology|year=2001|isbn=9781570594939|pages=310-313}}</ref> Early lesions may be colonized or infected by, ''[[Bacillus fusiformis]]'' (Vincent's organism), [[anaerobe]]s and [[spirochaete]]s. Later, tropical ulcer may become infected with a variety of organisms, notably, [[staphylococci]] and/or [[streptococci]].<ref name="isbn0-632-06496-X"/> The condition has been shown to be transmissible by inoculation of material from affected patients. <ref name='td' />

==Epidemiology==
Tropical ulcer has been described as a disease of the 'poor and hungry'; it may be that slowly improving socioeconomic conditions and nutrition account for its decline{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Urbanization of populations could be another factor, as tropical ulcer is usually a rural problem. More widespread use of shoes and socks also provides protection from initiating trauma{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Despite this, susceptible individuals still develop tropical ulcers. Sometimes outbreaks can occur; one was recorded in [[Tanzania]] in sugarcane workers cutting the crops while barefoot. Tropical ulcers can also occur to the visitors of tropics.<ref name="isbn0-632-06496-X"/>  The disease is most common in native laborers and in schoolchildren of the tropics and subtropics during the rainy season and is caused in many instances by the bites of insects, poor hygiene, and [[pyogenic|pyogenic infections]].<ref name="Andrews" /> Males are more commonly infected than females.<ref name='td' /> 
===Geographic distribution===
Tropical ulcer is seen throughout the tropics and subtropics. In some of these countries, such as northern Papua New Guinea, it is the most common skin disease. It is also a frequent problem amongst the homeless in tropical countries, as both the exposure to the elements and their unhygienic lifestyle make them a high-risk population. Open skin from intravenous drug use often exacerbates the problem.{{citation needed|reason=Where are the previous two sentences referenced from?|date=December 2012}}

==Treatment==
*[[Antibiotic]]s:  In early stages, [[penicillin]] or metronidazole are used in combination with topical antiseptic.<ref name='td' />
*Improved nutrition and vitamins.<ref name='td' />
*Non-adherent dressings and elevation of limbs.<ref name='td' />
*Large infected ulcers may require [[debridement]] under [[anesthesia]].
*[[Skin grafting]] may be helpful in advanced cases to ensure the lesion does not progress to chronic stage.<ref name='td' />
*In extreme cases, [[amputation]] is necessary.

==Prevention==
Adequate [[footwear]] is important to prevent trauma. General good health and nutrition also reduce ulcer risk. Adequate and prompt cleansing and treatment of ankle and leg skin breaks is also important.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Improving hygiene and nutrition may help to prevent tropical ulcers.<ref name="Andrews" />

==Complications==
*Skin color: Rarely, Jungle rot will result in complications with skin pigmentation. It has been known to leave the victim with different colors such as bright red, blue, green, and a rare color change of orange.
*Deep tissue invasion:  Often with bone involvement, and potentially leading to amputation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
*Chronic ulceration.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
*Recurrent ulceration.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
*[[Squamous cell carcinoma]] may occasionally develop, usually in chronic cases, and at the edge of ulcer.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
*[[Tetanus]]:  by entry of [[tetanus bacilli]] through the ulcer.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
