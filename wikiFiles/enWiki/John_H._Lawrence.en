'''John Hundale Lawrence''' (January 7, 1904 – September 7, 1991) was an American physicist and physician best known for pioneering the field of [[nuclear medicine]].  <ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4t1nb2bd&doc.view=content&chunk.id=div00037&toc.depth=1&brand=calisphere&anchor.id=0 ''John Hundale Lawrence, in Memorium'' (Regent of the University of California)]</ref>

==Background==
John Hundale Lawrence was born in [[Canton, South Dakota]]. His parents, Carl Gustavus and Gunda (née Jacobson) Lawrence, were both the offspring of Norwegian immigrants who had met while teaching at the high school in Canton, South Dakota, where his father was also the superintendent of schools. His brother was physicist [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]. He attended college at the [[University of South Dakota]] before getting his M.D. degree from [[Harvard Medical School]]. He was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in physics in 1957.

==Career==
He had a long-term association with the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and worked at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. There he discovered treatments for [[leukemia]] and [[polycythemia]] by injecting infected mice with radioactive [[phosphorus]] derived from the cyclotron invented by his brother, the Nobel Laureate [[Ernest O. Lawrence]].<ref>{{cite web | last =Yarris | first =Lynn | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =''An Historical Perspective on the Lab's Legacy'' | work = | publisher =Berkeley Lab | date = | url =http://www.lbl.gov/Publications/75th/files/04-lab-history-pt-3.html | accessdate =2008-03-07 }}</ref> 

Lawrence's work with cancer patients attracted the interest of William Donner, a Philadelphia industrialist and philanthropist, whose son had died of cancer. Donner contributed funds for construction of Donner Laboratory, at the Northeast corner of the Berkeley Campus that  was dedicated in 1942.

John Lawrence received the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] in 1983. He received honorary degrees from the [[University of South Dakota]],  [[University of Bordeaux]] and from the [[Catholic University of America]]. He was awarded the  Caldwell Medal  of the [[American Roentgen Ray Society]]; the  MacKenzie Davidson Medal  of the  British Institute of Radiology ; a medal from [[Pope Pius XII]]; the Silver Medal of the [[University of Bordeaux]]; the Silver Cross of the   Greek Royal Order of the Phoenix  and the  [[Pasteur Medal]]  of the [[Pasteur Institute]] of [[Paris]]. <ref>[http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/11/6/292 ''John Hundale Lawrence, Distinguished Nuclear Pioneer'' (Journal Of Nuclear Medicine.
