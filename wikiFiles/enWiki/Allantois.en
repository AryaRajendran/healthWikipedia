'''Allantois''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|æ|n|t|ɔɪ|s}}; plural ''allantoides'' or ''allantoises'') is a part of a developing [[amniote]]'s [[conceptus]] (which consists of all [[embryo]]nic and extra-embryonic tissues). It helps the embryo exchange gases and handle liquid waste.

The allantois, along with the [[amnion]] and [[chorion]] (other embryonic membranes), identify humans, and other [[mammal]]s, as [[amniote]]s. Other amniotes include [[reptile]]s, [[dinosaur]]s, and [[bird]]s. Of the [[vertebrates]], only [[Ichthyopsida]]s ([[fish]] and [[amphibian]]s) lack this structure.

==Function==
This sac-like structure is primarily involved in [[nutrition]] and [[excretion]], and is webbed with [[blood vessel]]s. The function of the allantois is to collect liquid waste from the embryo, as well as to exchange gases used by the embryo.

===In reptiles, birds, and monotremes===
The structure first evolved in [[reptiles]] and [[birds]] as a reservoir for nitrogenous waste, but also as a means for oxygenation of the embryo. [[Oxygen]] is absorbed by the allantois through the [[egg shell]].  The allantois functions similarly in [[monotremes]], which are egg-laying [[mammals]].

===In most marsupials===
In most [[marsupials]], the allantois is avascular, having no blood vessels, but still serves the purpose of storing nitrogenous (NH<sub>3</sub>) waste. Also, most marsupial allantoises do not fuse with the [[chorion]]. An exception is the allantois of the [[bandicoot]], which has a vasculature, and fuses with the chorion.

===In placental mammals (Eutheria) ===
In [[placental]] mammals, the allantois is part of and forms an axis for the development of the [[umbilical cord]].

* The [[mouse]] allantois consists of [[mesoderm]]al tissue, which undergoes vasculogenesis to form the mature umbilical artery and vein.<ref>Downs, K.M. 1998. "The Murine Allantois". ''Current Topics in Developmental Biology'' vol. 39, pp 1-33.</ref>

* The [[human]] allantois is an [[endoderm]]al evagination of the developing [[hindgut]] which becomes surrounded by the [[mesodermal]] connecting stalk.  The connecting stalk forms the umbilical vasculature{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. The fetal bladder is connected to the allantois via the [[urachus]], which removes nitrogenous waste from the fetal bladder.<ref>First AID for the USMLE Step 1 2008</ref> The allantois is vestigial and may regress, yet the homologous blood vessels persist as the umbilical arteries and veins connecting the embryo with the placenta.<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/allantois</ref>

==Pathology==
During the third week of development, the allantois protrudes into the area of the [[urogenital sinus]]. Between the 5th and 7th week of development, the allantois will become the [[urachus]], a duct between the bladder and the yolk sac. A patent allantois can result in [[urachal cyst]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Greek language|greek]] words allanto-, meaning [[sausage]], and eidos, meaning shape or similarity.
