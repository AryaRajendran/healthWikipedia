'''Immunoglobulin A''' ('''IgA''') is an [[antibody]] that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity. More IgA is produced in mucosal linings than all other types of antibody combined;<ref>{{cite journal |author=S Fagarasan and T Honjo |title=Intestinal IgA Synthesis: Regulation of Front-line Body Defenses |journal=Nat.

IgA has two subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) and can exist in a dimeric form called ''secretory IgA'' ('''sIgA'''). In its secretory form, IgA is the main [[immunoglobulin]] found in [[mucous membrane|mucous secretions]], including [[tears]], [[saliva]], [[colostrum]] and secretions from the [[genitourinary tract]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], [[prostate]] and [[respiratory epithelium]]. It is also found in small amounts in blood. The secretory component of sIgA protects the immunoglobulin from being degraded by proteolytic enzymes, thus sIgA can survive in the harsh [[gastrointestinal tract]] environment and provide protection against [[microbe]]s that multiply in body secretions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Junqueira |first= Luiz C. |coauthors= Jose Carneiro |title= Basic Histology|year= 2003|publisher= McGraw-Hill|isbn= 0-8385-0590-2}}</ref> sIgA can also inhibit inflammatory effects of other immunoglobulins.<ref>Holmgren J and Czerkinsky C. 2005. Mucosal immunity and vaccines. Nature Medicine 11, S45 - S53 doi:10.1038/nm1213</ref> IgA is a poor activator of the [[complement system]], and [[Opsonin|opsonise]]s only weakly. Its [[heavy chain]]s are of the type α.

==Forms==

===IgA1 vs. IgA2===
IgA exists in two [[Isotype (immunology)|isotypes]], IgA1 and IgA2. While IgA1 predominates in serum (~80%), IgA2 percentages are higher in secretions than in serum (~35% in secretions);<ref name="Delacroix DL et al. 1982 383–  5">{{cite journal |author=Delacroix DL et al. |journal=Immunology |year=1982 |volume=383 |pages=383–5}}</ref> the ratio of IgA1 and IgA2 secreting cells varies in the different lymphoid tissues of the human body:<ref name="Simell B et al. 2006 543–9">{{cite journal |author=Simell B et al. |journal=Clin Experiment Immunol |year=2006 |volume=143 |pages=543–9}}</ref>
* IgA1 is the predominant IgA subclass found in serum. Most lymphoid tissues have a predominance of IgA-producing cells.
* In IgA2, the heavy and light chains are not linked with [[disulfide]], but with [[noncovalent]] bonds. In secretory lymphoid tissues (e.g., [[gut-associated lymphoid tissue]], or GALT), the share of IgA2 production is larger than in the non-secretory lymphoid organs (e.g. spleen, peripheral lymph nodes).
Both IgA1 and IgA2 have been found in external secretions like [[colostrum]], maternal milk, [[tears]] and [[saliva]], where IgA2 is more prominent than in the blood.<ref name="Delacroix DL et al. 1982 383–  5" />
Polysaccharide antigens tend to induce more IgA2 than protein antigens.<ref name="Simell B et al. 2006 543–9"/>

===Serum vs. secretory IgA===
It is also possible to distinguish forms of IgA based upon their location - serum IgA vs. secretory IgA.

In secretory IgA, the form found in secretions, polymers of 2-4 IgA monomers are linked by two additional chains; as such, the [[molecular weight]] of slgA is 385,000D. One of these is the [[J chain]] (joining chain), which is a [[polypeptide]] of molecular mass 15kD, rich with [[cysteine]] and structurally completely different from other immunoglobulin chains. This chain is formed in the IgA-secreting cells. 

The oligomeric forms of IgA in the external (mucosal) secretions also contain a polypeptide of a much larger molecular mass (70 kD) called the [[secretory component]] that is produced by [[epithelial cells]].  This molecule originates from the poly-Ig receptor (130 kD) that is responsible for the uptake and transcellular transport of oligomeric (but not monomeric) IgA across the epithelial cells and into secretions such as tears, saliva, sweat and gut fluid.

==IgA activity==
The high prevalence of IgA in mucosal areas is a result of a cooperation between [[plasma cell]]s that produce polymeric IgA (pIgA), and mucosal epithelial cells that express an immunoglobulin receptor called the [[polymeric Ig receptor]] (pIgR). pIgA is released from the nearby activated plasma cells and binds to pIgR. This results in transportation of IgA across mucosal epithelial cells and its cleavage from pIgR for release into external secretions.<ref name=snoeck>{{cite journal |author=Snoeck V, Peters I, Cox E |title=The IgA system: a comparison of structure and function in different species |journal=Vet. Res. |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=455–67 |year=2006 |pmid=16611558 |doi=10.1051/vetres:2006010}}</ref>

In the blood, IgA interacts with an [[Fc receptor]] called FcαRI (or [[CD89]]), which is expressed on immune effector cells, to initiate inflammatory reactions.<ref name=snoeck/> Ligation of FcαRI by IgA containing immune complexes causes [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC), degranulation of [[eosinophil]]s and [[basophil]]s, [[phagocytosis]] by [[monocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, and [[neutrophil]]s, and triggering of respiratory burst activity by [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte]]s.<ref name=snoeck/>

==Transport==
Polymeric IgA (mainly the secretory dimer) is produced by [[plasma cell]]s in the [[lamina propria]] adjacent to mucosal surfaces. It binds to the [[polymeric immunoglobulin receptor]] on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, and is taken up into the cell via [[endocytosis]]. The receptor-IgA complex passes through the cellular compartments before being secreted on the [[Lumen (anatomy)|luminal surface]] of the epithelial cells, still attached to the receptor. [[Proteolysis]] of the receptor occurs, and the dimeric IgA molecule, along with a portion of the receptor known as the [[secretory component]], are free to diffuse throughout the lumen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=CS Kaetzel, JK Robinson, KR Chintalacharuvu, JP Vaerman, and ME Lamm |title=The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (secretory component) mediates transport of immune complexes across epithelial cells: a local defense function for IgA |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=88 |issue=19 |pages=8796–8800 |year=1991 |pmid=1924341 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.19.8796 |pmc=52597}}</ref> In the gut, it can bind to the mucus layer on top of the epithelial cells to form a barrier capable of neutralizing threats before they reach the cells.

==Pathology==
Decreased or absent IgA, termed [[selective IgA deficiency]], can be a clinically significant [[immunodeficiency]].

''Neisseria gonorrhœae'' (which causes [[gonorrhea]]), ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', and ''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B all release a protease which destroys IgA.

[[IgA nephropathy]] is caused by IgA deposits in the kidneys. It is not yet known why IgA deposits occur in this chronic disease. Some theories suggest an abnormality of the immune system results in these deposits.

[[Celiac disease]] involves IgA pathology due to the presence of IgA antiendomysial antibodies.
