'''Chorea''' (or '''choreia''', occasionally) is an abnormal involuntary [[movement disorder]], one of a group of neurological disorders called [[dyskinesia]]s. The term ''chorea'' is derived from the Greek word ''χορεία'' (=dance; see [[choreia]]), as the quick movements of the feet or hands are comparable to dancing.

The term '''hemichorea''' refers to chorea of one side of the body, such as chorea of one arm but not both (comparable to [[hemiballismus]]).

==Presentation==
Chorea is characterized by brief, semi-directed, irregular movements that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next. 

These 'dance-like' movements of chorea often occur with [[athetosis]], which adds twisting and writhing movements.  Walking may become difficult, and include odd postures and leg movements.

Unlike [[ataxia]], which affects the quality of voluntary movements, or [[Parkinsonism]], which is a hindrance of voluntary movements, the movements of chorea and ballism occur on their own, without conscious effort. Thus, chorea is said to be a [[hyperkinetic]] movement disorder.

When chorea is serious, slight movements will become thrashing motions; this form of severe chorea is referred to as [[ballism]] or ballismus.

==Causes==
Chorea can occur in a variety of conditions and disorders. 
* Chorea is a primary feature of [[Huntington's disease]], a progressive [[neurological]] disorder.
* Twenty percent (20%) of children and adolescents with [[rheumatic fever]] develop [[Sydenham's chorea]] as a complication.
* [[Chorea gravidarum]] is rare type of chorea which is a complication of [[pregnancy]].
* Chorea may also be caused by drugs ([[levodopa]], [[anti-convulsant]]s, [[anti-psychotic]]s), metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, and stroke.
* [[Wilson's disease]], a genetic disorder that leads to toxic levels of [[copper]] in the body
* [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]]:  A group of neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] and [[Kuru (disease)|Kuru]], caused by prions.
* [[Neuroacanthocytosis]], a genetic disorder that may affect the blood, brain, peripheral nerves, muscle and heart. Common features include peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy and hemolytic anemia. Other features include limb chorea, facial tics, other oral movements (lip and tongue biting), seizures, a late-onset dementia and behavioral changes.

==Treatment==
There is no standard course of treatment for chorea. Treatment depends on the type of chorea and the associated disease. Although there are many drugs that can control it, no cure has yet been identified.
