As of June 2012 there were more than 330 [[clinical trial]]s under way to understand and treat [[Alzheimer's disease]]. 30 of these studies were human [[Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III|phase three trials]], the last step before [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approval and marketing.<ref>{{cite web

There are different approaches. One approach is to reduce [[Amyloid beta]], for example with [[bapineuzumab]], an antibody in phase III studies for patients in mild to moderate stage; [[semagacestat]], a γ-[[secretase]] inhibitor, [[MPC-7869]]; and [[acc-001]] or [[CAD106]], vaccines against amyloid beta. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, like [[AL-108]] (phase II completed); or metal-protein interaction attenuation, as is the case of [[PBT2]] (phase II completed). Yet another approach is to use general cognitive enhances, as may be the case for [[memantine]], a pharmaceutical approved in the United States and European Union to treat moderate-to-sever AD. Finally, there are basic investigations on the origin and mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.

==Treatments in clinical development==

Multiple potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease are currently under investigation, including several compounds being studied in [[Regulatory requirement|phase 3]] clinical trials.  The most important clinical research is focused on potentially treating the underlying disease pathology, for which reduction of [[amyloid beta]] is a common target of compounds under investigation.

=== Immunotherapy to amyloid beta ===

[[Immunotherapy]] or [[vaccination]] for Alzheimer's stimulates the immune system to attack beta-amyloid. One approach is active immunization, which would stimulate a permanent immune response.<ref>

In long-term followups, 20% of subjects had developed high levels of antibodies to beta-amyloid. While placebo-patients and non-antibody responders worsened, these antibody-responders showed a degree of stability in cognitive levels as assessed by the neuropsychological test battery (although not by other measures), and had lower levels of the protein tau in their cerebrospinal fluid. These results may suggest reduced disease activity in the antibody-responder group. Autopsies found that immunization resulted in clearance of amyloid plaques, but did not prevent progressive neurodegeneration.<ref>Vaccination:

====Passive immunotherapy====

Also derived from the AN-1792 immunotherapy program, there is an infused antibody approach termed a passive vaccine in that it does not invoke the immune system and would require regular infusions to maintain the artificial antibody levels. [[Cerebral hemorrhage|Micro-cerebral hemorrhages]] may be a threat to this process.

The most advanced such candidate is known as [[bapineuzumab]] or aab-001, and this antibody is designed as essentially identical to the natural antibody triggered by the earlier AN-1792 vaccine. The aab-001 antibody is in Phase 3 clinical trials for both Apolipoprotein E4 gene carriers,<ref name="bare_url">{{cite web

====Gamma secretase inhibition====

[[Gamma secretase]] is a protein complex thought to be a fundamental building block in the development of the amyloid beta peptide. A gamma secretase inhibitor known as LY451039 is in Phase 3 trials.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.clinicaltrialsplus.com/dms/index.jsp?RQ_mode=view&RQ_releaseid=399821&RQ_selectedDb=cp

====Gamma secretase modulation====

[[R-flurbiprofen|Tarenflurbil]] (MPC-7869, formerly R-flubiprofen) is a [[gamma secretase]] modulator sometimes called a selective amyloid beta 42 lowering agent. It is believed to reduce the production of the toxic amyloid beta in favor of shorter forms of the peptide.<ref>Tarenflurbil:

Several other pharmaceuticals are under investigation to treat Alzheimer's disease.

A study published in 2008 of etanercept, administered to a single AD patient via perispinal infusion, showed rapid (within 10 minutes) and significant improvement in Alzheimer's symptoms that lasted until the end of the study, which involved weekly injections.<ref>{{cite web

====Insulin sensitizers====
Recent studies suggest an association between insulin resistance and AD (fat cell sensitivity to insulin can decline with aging):
In clinical trials, a certain insulin sensitizer called "[[rosiglitazone]]" improved cognition in a subset of AD patients;<ref>{{cite journal

====Methylthioninium chloride====
In July 2008, researchers announced positive results from [[methylthioninium chloride]] (MTC), (trade name: [[Rember]]) a drug that dissolved Tau polymers.  [[Clinical_trial#Phase_II|Phase II]] results indicate that it is the first therapy that has success in modifying the course of disease in mild to moderate AD.<ref>

====Sigma receptors====
Originally considered an enigmatic protein, the [[sigma-1 receptor]] has been identified as a unique ligand-regulated molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. This discovery led to the review of many proposed roles of this receptor in many neurological diseases including Alzheimer's.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anavex.com/Sigma_Receptors.html |title=Sigma Receptors |accessdate= June 27, 2012 |publisher=Anavex Life Sciences Corporation}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal
