'''Lymph node biopsy''' is a test in which a [[lymph node]] or a piece of a lymph node is removed for examination under a [[microscope]] (see: [[biopsy]]).

The [[lymphatic system]] is made up of several lymph nodes connected by [[lymph vessel]]s. The nodes produce white blood cells ([[lymphocytes]]) that fight [[infection]]s. When an infection is present, the lymph nodes swell, produce more white blood cells, and attempt to trap the organisms that are causing the infection. The lymph nodes also try to trap [[cancer]] cells.

==How the test is performed==
The test is done in an [[operating room]] in a [[hospital]], or at an outpatient [[outpatient surgery|surgical facility]]. There are two ways the sample may be obtained:

* [[Needle biopsy]]
* Open ([[:wikt:excision|excisional]]) biopsy

===Needle biopsy===
A needle biopsy involves inserting a needle into a node to obtain the sample.

The patient lies on the examination table; the biopsy site is cleansed; and a local [[anesthetic]] is injected. The [[Needle aspiration biopsy|biopsy]] needle is then inserted into the node. A sample is removed, pressure is applied to the site to stop the [[bleeding]], and a bandage is applied.

===Open biopsy===
An open biopsy consists of surgically removing all or part of a node.

The patient lies on the examination table and is given a [[sedative]]. The [[skin]] over the biopsy site is cleansed, and a local [[anesthetic]] is injected (occasionally, a [[general anesthetic]] is given). A small incision is made, and the lymph node or part of the node is removed. The incision is then closed with [[surgical suture|stitches]] and [[bandage]]d.

The sample is then sent to [[pathology]].

With this test there is a small chance of [[infection]] or [[bleeding]]. Additionally, there is a moderate risk of [[nerve]] injury, localized [[paralysis]], or [[Paresthesia|numbness]] when the biopsy is performed on a lymph node close to [[nerve]]s.

==Test results==
The test is used to help determine the cause of lymph node enlargement (swollen glands or [[lymphadenitis]]). It may also determine whether [[tumor]]s in the lymph node are [[cancer]]ous or noncancerous. Enlarged lymph nodes may be caused by a number of conditions, ranging from very mild [[infection]]s to serious [[malignant|malignancies]]. [[Benign]] conditions can often be distinguished from cancerous and infectious processes by microscopic examination. The [[pathologist]] may also perform additional tests on the lymph node tissue to assist in making a [[diagnosis]].

Some of the conditions where abnormal values are obtained are:
* [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]
* [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]
* [[Sarcoidosis]]
* [[scrofula|tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis]] (scrofula)
