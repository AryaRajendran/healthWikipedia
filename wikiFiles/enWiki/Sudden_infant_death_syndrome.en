'''Sudden Infant Death Syndrome''' ('''SIDS''') is marked by the sudden death of an [[infant]] that is not predicted by medical history and remains unexplained after a thorough forensic [[autopsy]] and detailed death scene investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/sids/|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Sudden Infant Death|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref>   As infants are at the highest risk for SIDS during sleep, it is sometimes referred to as '''cot death''' or '''crib death'''.

Typically the infant is found dead after having been put to bed, and exhibits no signs of having suffered.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Randall B | year = 1996 | title = Witnessed sudden infant death syndrome | url = | journal = Journal of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Infant Mortality | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 55–57 }}</ref>

The cause of SIDS is unknown, but some characteristics associated with the syndrome have been identified. The unique signature characteristic of SIDS is its [[log-normal]] age distribution that spares infants shortly after birth &mdash; the time of maximal risk for almost all other causes of non-trauma infant death. Other notable characteristics are its disproportionate affliction of male infants and the fact that caregivers are unaware in the preceding 24 hours that the infant is at risk of imminent sudden death. Many risk factors and medical causal relationships are proposed for SIDS. Infants sleeping on their bellies or exposed to [[passive smoking|tobacco smoke]] are at greater risk than infants sleeping on their backs or unexposed to tobacco smoke. [[Genetics]] also play a role, as SIDS is more prevalent in males.<ref name="CDC WONDER online database">See [http://wonder.cdc.gov CDC WONDER online database] and http://www3.who.int/whosis/menu.cfm?path=whosis,inds,mort&language=english for data on SIDS by gender in the US and throughout the world.</ref><ref name="Mage DT, Donner EM 2004 1210–5">{{cite journal |author=Mage DT, Donner EM |title=The fifty percent male excess of infant respiratory mortality |journal=Acta Paediatr. |volume=93 |issue=9 |pages=1210–5 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15384886 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0803-5253&date=2004&volume=93&issue=9&spage=1210 |doi=10.1080/08035250410031305}}</ref>

SIDS prevention strategies include safe sleep practices, such as putting the infant to sleep on his or her back, in a well-ventilated room, on a firm mattress separate from but close to caregivers.  In particular, the "back to sleep" campaign is credited with leading to a measurable reduction in SIDS rates.  Pacifiers at bedtime and naptime can help reduce risk.  Not smoking during pregnancy is another way to reduce SIDS risk.<ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics">{{cite web |title=Fig 4.

==Definition==
SIDS is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]] and should be applied to only those cases in which an infant's death is sudden and unexpected, and remains unexplained after the performance of an adequate [[postmortem]] investigation, including:
# an [[autopsy]] (by an experienced pediatric [[pathologist]], if possible);
# investigation of the death scene and circumstances of the death;
# exploration of the [[medical history]] of the infant and family.

After investigation, some of these infants deaths are found to be caused by accidental suffocation, hyperthermia or hypothermia, neglect or some other defined cause.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cdc.gov/sids/|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Sudden Unexpected Infant Death and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref>

[[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are shifting to the term "sudden unexpected death in infancy" (SUDI) for professional, scientific and coronial clarity.
<blockquote>The term SUDI is now often used instead of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) because some coroners prefer to use the term 'undetermined' for a death previously considered to be SIDS. This change is causing diagnostic shift in the mortality data.<ref>[http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/5118C5C5561CEC79CC2573A6000B3BBE NZ Ministry of Health]</ref></blockquote> In addition, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has recently proposed that such deaths be called "sudden unexpected infant deaths" (SUID) and that SIDS is a subset of SUID.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/SIDS/index.htm</ref>

==Risk factors==
The cause of SIDS is unknown. Although studies have identified risk factors for SIDS, such as putting infants to bed on their stomachs, there has been little understanding of the syndrome's biological process or its potential causes. The frequency of SIDS does appear to be influenced by the infant's age or ethnicity, the education or socioeconomic status of the infant's parents.

Listed below are several risk factors associated with increased probability of the syndrome.

===Prenatal===

==Hypotheses==

===Bacterial infections===
In a British study released May 29, 2008, researchers discovered that the common bacterial infections ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' appear to be [[risk factor]]s in some cases of SIDS. Both bacteria were present in greater-than-usual concentrations in infants who died from SIDS.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Bed sharing===
A 2005 policy statement by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]  (AAP) on sleep environment and the risk of SIDS deemed bed-sharing unsafe, recommending that infants sleep in a separate crib, bassinet, or cradle in the same room as a parent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Task Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome |title=The changing concept of sudden infant death syndrome: diagnostic coding shifts, controversies regarding the sleeping environment, and new variables to consider in reducing risk |journal=Pediatrics |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=1245–55 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16216901 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1499 |url= http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;116/5/1245}}</ref> In 2011, the AAP issued an expansion of its recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment, in which it again recommended "room-sharing without bed-sharing", stating that such an arrangement can decrease the risk of SIDS by up to 50%. Furthermore, it recommended against devices marketed to make bed-sharing "safe", such as in-bed co-sleepers.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22007004|noedit}}</ref>

One trial compared 20 infants who shared their parents' bed one night and slept separately the next. The children's heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored and analyzed together with eight hours of infrared video recording of their sleep. Although the bed-sharing infants spent some parts of the night with their airways (both mouth and nose) covered, "no consistent effect on either oxygen saturation levels or heart rate was revealed, even during prolonged bouts of airway covering." The authors concluded that "although numerous authors have suggested that bed-sharing infants face risks because of airway covering by bed-clothes or parental bodies, the present trial does not lend support to this hypothesis".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ball H |title=Airway covering during bed-sharing |journal=Child Care Health Dev |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=728–37 |year= 2009 |month=September |pmid=19531119 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2009.00979.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0305-1862&date=2009&volume=35&issue=5&spage=728}}</ref>

===Brain disorders===
According to a 2006 study in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' ([[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]), some babies who die of SIDS have abnormalities in the brain stem ([[medulla oblongata]]) of underdeveloped [[serotonin]] receptors (which help control functions like breathing, [[blood pressure]] and arousal) and abnormalities in serotonin signaling.  According to the [[National Institutes of Health]], this finding was the strongest evidence at that time that structural differences in a specific part of the brain may contribute to the risk of SIDS.<ref name=Paterson06>{{cite journal |author=Paterson DS, Trachtenberg FL, Thompson EG, et al. |title=Multiple serotonergic brainstem abnormalities in sudden infant death syndrome |journal =JAMA |volume=296 |issue=17 |pages=2124–32 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17077377 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.17.2124}}</ref> This abnormality can continue postpartum until the end of the baby's first year, possibly accounting for the increased SIDS risk in premature infants and declining risk in children over 12 months of age. The authors noted that males have fewer serotonin receptors than females, perhaps contributing to the greater frequency of SIDS in males, but their follow-up 2010 paper failed to reconfirm that gender difference.<ref name="Duncan">{{cite journal | author = Duncan JR, Paterson DS, Hoffman JM, Mokler DJ, Borenstein NS, Belliveau RA, Krous HF, Haas EA, Stanley C ''et al.'' | year = 2010 | month = Feb | title = Brainstem serotonergic deficiency in sudden infant death syndrome | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 5| pages = 430–7 }}</ref>

Another 2006 study showed that a possible cause of SIDS parents leaving their infants in an angled (feet up, head down) position known as the [[Trendelenburg position]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17052284 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-3016.2006.00753.x | volume=20 | issue=6 | journal = Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology | year=2006 | title = Increased incidence of apparently life-threatening events due to supine position | month=November | pages=491–6; discussion 496–7 | author=Maggio AB, Sch&auml;ppi MG, Benkebil F, Posfay-Barbe KM, Belli DC}}</ref> This position can cause the brain stem to fall; in severe cases, the brain becomes "crushed". Recommended positions for resting infants include [[Fowler's position]] and [[Sims' position]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

A 2010 study suggests [[Interleukin-2]], a [[neuromodulator]], as the potential mechanism of SIDS. Intense neuronal IL-2 immunoreactivity in brainstems of SIDS victims was found, which could be responsible for decreased cardiorespiratory and arousal responses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kadhim H, Deltenre P, De Prez C, Sébire G. |title=Interleukin-2 as a neuromodulator possibly implicated in the physiopathology of sudden infant death syndrome |journal=FNeurosci Lett.  |volume=480 |issue=2 |pages=122–6 |year=2010 |month=August|pmid=20542085 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2010.06.021 }}</ref>

===Central respiratory pattern deficiency===
Ongoing research in the pediatric/neonatal community has begun to associate apnea-like breathing cessations in [[animal model]]s with unusual neural architecture or signal transduction in [[central pattern generator]] circuits, including the [[pre-Bötzinger complex]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Katz DM |title=Regulation of respiratory neuron development by neurotrophic and transcriptional signaling mechanisms |journal=Respiratory physiology & neurobiology |volume=149 |issue=1–3 |pages=99–109 |year=2005 |pmid=16203214 |doi= 10.1016/j.resp.2005.02.007}}</ref>

===Cervical spinal injury from birth trauma===
During birth, if the infant's head is traumatically turned side to side, upper cervical spinal injury can result. Difficulty breathing is a classic sign of upper spinal cord and brainstem injury.<ref>[http://www.icpa4kids.org/research/chiropractic/sids.htm ICPA — SIDS Research]</ref> When infants with undiagnosed upper cervical spinal cord injury are continually placed on their stomachs for sleep, they are forced to turn their heads to the side to breathe.

===Child abuse===
Several instances of [[infanticide]] have been uncovered where the diagnosis was originally SIDS.<ref name="Glatt 2000"/><ref name="Havill 2002"/> This has led some researchers to estimate that 5% to 20% of SIDS deaths are actually infanticides.<ref>{{cite book |title=Infanticide: Psychosocial and Legal Perspectives on Mothers Who Kill |year=2003 |isbn=1-58562-097-1 |first=Margaret |last=Spinelli |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Stanton J, Simpson A |title=Murder misdiagnosed as SIDS: a perpetrator's perspective |journal=Arch Dis Child. |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages= 454–9 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11719326 |pmc=1719021 |url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11719326 |doi=10.1136/adc.85.6.454}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Emery JL |title=Child abuse, sudden infant death syndrome, and unexpected infant death |journal=Am J Dis Child. |volume=147 |issue=10 |pages=1097–100 |year=1993 |month= October |pmid=8213682}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198612253152611 |title=Investigation of SIDS |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=315 |issue=26 |pages=1675–7 |year=1986 |month=December |pmid=3785340}}</ref> In 1997 ''[[The New York Times]]'', covering the book ''The Death of Innocents: A True Story of Murder, Medicine and High-Stakes Science'', wrote:
<blockquote>The misdiagnosis of infanticide as SIDS "happens all over," Ms. Talan, a medical reporter at Newsday, said. "A lot of doctors and police don't know how to handle it. They don't take it as seriously as they should." As a result of the book's revelations, people are starting to scrutinize possible cases of this "perfect crime," which involves no physical evidence and no witnesses.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9A06EED9163FF93AA25753C1A961958260 |title=Investigating a Rash of SIDS Deaths, Exposing Infanticide |author=Carol Strickland |date=1997-10-19 |accessdate=2008-04-20 |work=The New York Times}}</ref></blockquote>

A [[United Kingdom]] [[pediatrician]], [[Roy Meadow]] believes that many cases diagnosed as SIDS are really the result of [[child abuse]] on the part of a parent. During the 1990s and early 2000s, a number of mothers of multiple apparent SIDS victims were convicted of [[homicide]] [[murder in English law|to various extents]], on the basis of Meadow's opinion. In 2003 a number of high-profile [[acquittal]]s brought Meadow's theories into disrepute. Several hundred murder [[conviction (law)|conviction]]s were reviewed, leading to several high-profile cases being reopened and convictions overturned. Meadow's medical license was revoked in 2005,<ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Roy Meadow struck off by GMC |newspaper=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4685511.stm | date=2005-07-15}}</ref> after which he appealed to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], which ruled in his favour in February 2006. The [[General Medical Council]] appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and in October 2006 by a majority decision, with the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Anthony Clarke, Baron Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony|Sir Anthony Clarke]], dissenting, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the High Court in part, ruling that Meadow's misconduct was not sufficiently serious to merit the punishment which he had received.

The [[Royal Statistical Society]] issued a media release refuting the expert testimony in one UK case in which the conviction was subsequently overturned.<ref>[http://www.rss.org.uk/main.asp?page=1225 "About Statistics and the Law"] (Website). Royal Statistical Society. (2001-10-23) Retrieved on 2007-09-22</ref>

===Genetics===
There is a consistent 50% male excess in SIDS per 1000 live births of each sex. Given a 5% male excess birth rate, there appears to be 3.15 male SIDS cases per 2 female, for a male fraction of 0.61.<ref name="CDC WONDER online database"/><ref name="Mage DT, Donner EM 2004 1210–5"/> This value of 61% in the US is an average of 57% black male SIDS, 62.2% white male SIDS and 59.4% for all other races combined. Note that when multiracial parentage is involved, infant "race" is arbitrarily assigned to one category or the other; most often it is chosen by the mother. The [[sex linkage|X-linkage]] hypothesis for SIDS and the male excess in infant mortality have shown that the 50% male excess could be related to a dominant X-linked [[allele]], occurring with a frequency of {{Frac|1|3}} that is protective of transient cerebral anoxia. An unprotected XY male would occur with a frequency of {{Frac|2|3}} and an unprotected XX female would occur with a frequency of {{Frac|4|9}}. The ratio of {{Frac|2|3}} to {{Frac|4|9}} is 1.5 to 1, which matches the observed male 50% excess rate of SIDS.

Although many researchers have found [[autosomal]] and [[mitochondrial]] genetic risk factors for SIDS, they cannot explain the male excess because such [[gene locus|gene loci]] have the same frequencies for males and females. Supporting evidence for an X-linkage is found by examining other causes of infant respiratory death, such as suffocation by inhalation of food or other foreign objects. Although food is prepared identically for male and female infants, there is a similar 50% male excess of death from such causes, indicating that males are more susceptible to the cerebral anoxia created by such incidents in exactly the same proportion as found in SIDS.<ref>See the data found at http://wonder.cdc.gov for 9ICD 911–912 and 10ICD W79-W80 for death rates from inhalation of food and foreign objects by sex.</ref>{{or|date=April 2011}}

===Inner ear damage===
Records of hearing tests (oto-acoustic emissions/OAEs) administered to certain infants show that those who later died of SIDS had differences in the pattern of these tests compared with normal babies. The OAE [[signal to noise ratio|signal-to-noise ratio]] was reduced in the right ears of SIDS babies (Rubens DD et al. Early Human Development 84, 225-9 (2008)).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Hearing loss may foretell SIDS risk |author=Thomas H.

The authors' suggestion for the cause of SIDS is that the deaths are caused by disturbances in respiratory control other than suffocation. The vestibular apparatus of the [[inner ear]] has been shown to play an important role in respiratory control during sleep; this inner ear damage could be linked to SIDS. The authors speculate that the damage occurs during delivery, particularly when prolonged contractions create greater blood pressure in the [[placenta]]. The right ear is directly in the "line of fire" for blood entering the [[fetus]] from the placenta, and thus could be more susceptible to damage. If the findings are relevant, it may be possible to take corrective measures. Researchers are beginning [[animal studies]] to explore the connection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alastruey J, Sherwin SJ, Parker KH, Rubens DD |title=Placental transfusion insult in the predisposition for SIDS: a mathematical study |journal=Early Hum.

===Nitrogen dioxide===
A 2005 study by researchers at the [[University of California, San Diego]], found that "SIDS may be related to high levels of acute outdoor NO<sub>2</sub> exposure during the last day of life."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klonoff-Cohen H, Lam PK, Lewis A |title=Outdoor carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sudden infant death syndrome |journal=Arch Dis Child. |volume=90 |issue=7 |pages=750–3 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15970620 |pmc=1720470 |doi=10.1136/adc.2004.057091}}</ref> While [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>) exposure may be one of many possible risk factors, it is not considered causal, and the report cautioned that further studies were needed to replicate the result.

===Toxic gases===
In 1989, a controversial piece of research by UK scientist Barry Richardson claimed that all cot deaths were the result of toxic [[nerve agent|nerve gases]] being produced through the action of [[fungus]] in mattresses on compounds of [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]] and [[antimony]]. These chemicals are frequently used to make mattresses fire-retardant.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!--Phosphorus?? Fire-retardant?-->

Support for this hypothesis was based on the observation that the risk of cot death rises from one sibling to the next.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Richardson claimed that parents are more likely to buy new bedding for their first child, and to reuse that bedding for later children. The more frequently used the bedding, the more chance that fungus has become resident in the material; thus, a higher chance of cot death. A paper by Peter Fleming and Peter Blair<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fleming PJ, Blair PS, Mitchell EA |title=Mattresses, microenvironments, and multivariate analyses |journal=BMJ |volume=325 |issue=7371 |pages=981–2 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12411332 |pmc=1124537 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12411332 |doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7371.981}}</ref> references evidence from other studies that both supports and refutes the increasing occurrence of SIDS with mattress sharing, suggesting that this is still inconclusive.

<!--who is this guy?-->
Dr. Jim Sprott recommends new parents either buy bedding free of the toxic compounds or wrap the mattresses in a barrier film to prevent escape of the gases. Sprott claims that no case of cot death has ever been traced to a properly manufactured or wrapped mattress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cotlife2000.co.nz/ |title=Cot Life 2000 aims to eliminate cot |publisher=Cotlife2000.co.nz |accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref>

However, a final report of "The Expert Group to Investigate Cot Death Theories: Toxic Gas Hypothesis", published in May 1998, concluded that "there was no evidence to substantiate the toxic gas hypothesis that antimony- and phosphorus-containing compounds used as fire retardants in [[PVC]] and other cot mattress materials are a cause of SIDS. Neither was there any evidence to believe that these chemicals could pose any other health risk to infants."<ref>See [http://web.archive.org/web/20001026033455/http://www.sids.org.uk/fsid/limerick.htm FSID Press release].</ref> The report also states that "in normal cot-like conditions it is not possible to generate toxic gas from antimony in mattresses" and that "babies have also been found to die on wrapped mattresses."

According to Dr. Sprott, as of 2006, the New Zealand government has not reported any SIDS deaths when babies have slept on mattresses wrapped according to his method. While the Limerick report claims that babies have been found to die on wrapped mattresses, Dr. Sprott argues that a chemical analysis of the bedding should be performed. He additionally claims that this part of the report was flawed:
<blockquote>In February 2000 Dr. Peter Fleming (a co-author of the Limerick Report and principal author of the UK CESDI Report) conceded that the claim that three babies in the United Kingdom had died of cot death on polythene-covered mattresses could not be substantiated.<ref>[http://www.cotlife2000.co.nz/limerick.htm cotlife2000.co.nz Errors and fallacies in the UK Limerick Report: an overview], Cot Life 2000</ref></blockquote>

===Vaccination===
[[Vaccination]] does not increase the risk of SIDS, and may reduce the risk slightly.<ref name=Vennemann2007>{{cite journal |author=Vennemann MM, Butterfass-Bahloul T, Jorch G, ''et al.'' |title=Sudden infant death syndrome: no increased risk after immunisation |journal=Vaccine |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=336–40 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=16945457 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.07.027 }}</ref><ref name=CDCFAQ />

According to the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]:
{{bquote|From 2 to 4 months old, babies begin their primary course of routine vaccinations. This is also the peak age for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

===Vitamin C===
In the 1970s, high doses of [[vitamin C]] were touted as a preventive measure for SIDS,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kalokerinos A, Dettman G |title=Sudden death in infancy syndrome in Western Australia |journal=Med.

For example, an infant with MCAD deficiency could have died by "classical SIDS" if found swaddled and prone with head covered in an overheated room where [[smoking and pregnancy|parents were smoking]]. Genes indicating susceptibility to MCAD and Long QT syndrome do not protect an infant from dying of classical SIDS. Therefore, presence of a susceptibility gene, such as for MCAD, means the infant may have died either from SIDS or from MCAD deficiency. It is currently impossible for the pathologist to distinguish between them.

A 2010 study looked at 554 autopsies of infants in [[North Carolina]] that listed SIDS as the cause of death, and suggested that many of these deaths may have been due to accidental suffocation.  The study found that 69% of autopsies listed other possible risk factors that could have led to death, such us unsafe bedding or sleeping with adults.<ref>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sids/</ref>

==Prevention==

===Air circulation with fan use===
According to a study of nearly 500 babies published in the October 2008 ''[[Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine]]'', using a fan to circulate air correlates with a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome. This is plausible because a prone sleeping baby with nose to the sleeping surface could rebreathe some of its exhaled breath which is enriched in CO2 and depleted in oxygen. A fan could increase the mixing of the exhalation into the room air and lessen the risk of SIDS related to infant hypoxia. Researchers took into account other risk factors and found that fan use was associated with a 72% lower risk of SIDS. Only 3% of the babies who died had a fan on in the room during their last sleep, the mothers reported. That compared to 12% of the babies who lived. Using a fan reduced risk most for babies in poor sleeping environments.<ref name="Coleman-Phox K, Odouli R, Li DK 2008 963–8"/> Author De-Kun li said that "the baby's sleeping environment really matters" and that "this seems to suggest that by improving room ventilation we can further reduce risk."<ref>{{cite news |title=Fan use linked to lower risk of sudden baby death |author=Carla K. Johnson ([[Associated Press]] writer) |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |url=http://www.parentcentral.ca/parent/article/513143}}, also in [http://www.livescience.com/health/081008-ap-fans-sudden-death.html Live Science]</ref>

However, Dr. John Olssen at East Carolina University has pointed out that this study had a number of methodological flaws, such as selection and recall bias, low enrollment numbers, and dissimilar study groups. Olssen argues that although fan use is probably not harmful, it should not be recommended as a means to reduce the risk of SIDS.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Vanderford J, Olsson J |title=Should we really encourage fan use? |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=163 |issue=5 |pages=490; author reply 490–1 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid= 19414701 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.79 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/5/490}}</ref>

===Bedding===
Product safety experts advise against using pillows, [[Infant Sleep Safety: Testing for Correct Mattress Firmness|overly soft mattresses]], sleep positioners, bumper pads, stuffed animals, or fluffy bedding in the crib and recommend instead dressing the child warmly and keeping the crib "naked."<ref>[http://www.smartmoney.com/top5/index.cfm?story=20060914&nav=ibs&ibshatkey=den Smartmoney.com on bedding]</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What Can Be Done?  |publisher=American SIDS Institute |url=http://www.sids.org/nprevent.htm}}</ref>

Blankets should not be placed over an infant's head.<ref>{{cite pmid|18519451}}</ref> It has been recommended that infants should be covered only up to their chest with their arms exposed. This reduces the chance of the infant shifting the blanket over his or her head.

===Breastfeeding===
A 2003 study published in ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'', which investigated racial disparities in infant mortality in Chicago, found that previously or currently [[breastfeeding]] infants in the study had 1/5 the rate of SIDS compared with non-breastfed infants, but that "it became nonsignificant in the multivariate model that included the other environmental factors". These results are consistent with most published reports and suggest that other factors associated with breastfeeding, rather than breastfeeding itself, are protective."<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2003 |volume=111 |pages=1207–14 |title=Sleep environment and the risk of sudden infant death syndrome in an urban population: the Chicago Infant Mortality Study |author=Hauck FR, Herman SM, Donovan M, Iyasu S, Merrick Moore C, Donoghue E, Kirschner RH, Willinger M |url=http://www.andrews.edu/~rbailey/Chapter%20five/infant/9667102.pdf|pmid=12728140 |issue=5 Part 2}}</ref> More recent studies however claim to show a significantly reduced incidence of SIDS in breastfed infants.

===Bumper pads===
Bumper pads may be a contributing factor, claims [[Health Canada]], the Canadian government's health department. They issued an advisory<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/legislation/pol/bumper-bordure_e.html |title=Policy Statement for Bumper Pads in Cribs — Consumer Product Safety |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> recommending against the use of bumper pads, stating:
{{bquote|The presence of bumper pads in a crib may also be a contributing factor for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

===Concerns regarding recommendations===
Dr. Rafael Pelayo from Stanford University and a number of other pediatric sleep researchers in the US have stated that they believe that the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations regarding cosleeping and pacifier use may have unintended consequences. They have stated that the SIDS prevention strategy of the American Academy of Pediatrics which keeps infants at a low arousal threshold and reduces the time in quiet sleep may be unhealthy for children. They state that slow-wave sleep is the most restorative form of sleep and limiting this sleep in the first 12 months of life may have unintended consequences to both the sleep and the infant.<ref name=Pelayo06>{{cite journal |author=Pelayo R, Owens J, Mindell J, Sheldon S |title=Bed sharing with unimpaired parents is not an important risk for sudden infant death syndrome: to the editor |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=993–4; author reply 994–6 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16510694 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-2748 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/117/3/993.pdf}}</ref>

According to a 1998 study by British researchers that compared back-sleeping infants to stomach-sleeping infants, there were developmental differences at 6 months of age between the two groups. At 6 months of age, the stomach-sleeping infants had higher gross-motor scores, social-skills scores, and total-development skills scores than the back-sleeping infants. The differences were apparent at the 5% statistical significant level. But, at 18 months, the differences were no longer apparent. The researchers deemed the lower-development scores of back-sleeping infants at 6 months of age to be transient and stated that they do not believe the back-sleeping recommendations should be changed.<ref name=Dewey98>{{cite journal |author =Dewey C, Fleming P, Golding J |title=Does the supine sleeping position have any adverse effects on the child?

Other side effects of the back-sleeping position include increased rates of shoulder retraction, [[positional plagiocephaly]], and positional [[torticollis]].<ref name=Jones04>{{cite journal |author=Jones MW |title=Supine and Prone Infant Positioning: A Winning Combination |journal=J Perinat Educ |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=10–20 |year=2004 |pmid=17273371 |pmc= 1595182 |doi=10.1624/105812404826388|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/jpe/2004/00000013/00000001/art00006}}</ref> Some scientists dispute that plagiocephaly is a negative side effect.

Because of the delays caused by back-sleep, some medical professionals have suggested that the "normal" ages at which children had previously attained developmental milestones should be pushed back. This would enable medical professionals to consider "normal" children who previously were considered developmentally delayed.<ref>Stevens P, "The Flip Side of Back to Sleep", ''The O&P Edge''.</ref>

Additional studies have reported that the following negative conditions are associated with the back-sleep position: increase in sleep apnea; decrease in sleep duration; strabismus; social skills delays; deformational plagiocephaly; and temporomandibular jaw difficulties.<ref name=Jones04/> In addition, the following are symptoms that are associated with sleep apnea: growth abnormalities; failure-to-thrive syndrome in infants; neurocognitive abnormalities; daytime sleepiness; emotional problems; decrease in memory; decrease in learning; and a delay in nonverbal skills. The conditions associated with deformational plagiocephaly include visual impairments;; cerebral dysfunction, delays in psychomotor development and decreases in mental functioning. The conditions associated with gross motor milestone delays include speech and language disorders. In addition, it has been hypothesized that delays in motor skills can have a negative impact on the development of social skills.<ref>{{cite journal |author=von Hofsten C |title=An action perspective on motor development |journal= Trends Cogn.

===Pacifiers===
According to a 2005 meta-analysis, most studies favor [[pacifier]] use.<ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics"/> According to the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], pacifier use seems to reduce the risk of SIDS, although the mechanism by which this happens is unclear.<ref name="aap_pacifiers"/> SIDS experts and policy makers haven't recommended the use of pacifiers to reduce the risk of SIDS because of several problems associated with pacifier use, like increased risk of otitis, gastrointestinal infections and oral colonization with Candida species.<ref name="aap_pacifiers">{{cite web |title=The Changing Concept of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Diagnostic Coding Shifts, Controversies Regarding the Sleeping Environment, and New Variables to Consider in Reducing Risk |publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |accessdate=2008-11-06 |url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;116/5/1245#SEC6}}</ref> A 2005 study indicated that use of a [[pacifier]] is associated with up to a 90% reduction in the risk of SIDS depending on the ambient factors, and it reduced the effect of other risk factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li DK, Willinger M, Petitti DB, Odouli R, Liu L, Hoffman HJ |title=Use of a dummy (pacifier) during sleep and risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): population based case-control study |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7532 |pages=18–22 |year=2006 |pmid=16339767 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38671.640475.55 |pmc=1325127}}</ref> It has been speculated that the raised surface of the pacifier holds the infant's face away from the mattress, reducing the risk of suffocation. If a postmortem investigation does not occur or is insufficient, a suffocated baby may be misdiagnosed with SIDS.

A 2010 study at Monash University suggests pacifiers can prevent SIDS by changing sleep patterns. They believe a pacifier ensures the baby remains in a light sleep and is more easily aroused if he or she feels uncomfortable.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dummies may protect babies babies from cot death|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/dummies-may-protect-babies-from-cot-death-20101007-169we.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2010}}</ref> The most recent 2011 study confirms that pacifier usage also reduces SIDS risks from other known SIDS risk factors<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moon RY, Tanabe KO, Yang DC, Young HA, Hauck FR |title=Pacifier Use and Sids: Evidence for a Consistently Reduced Risk |journal=Matern Child Health J |date=April 2011  |pmid=21505778 |doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0793-x |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=609–14}}</ref>

===Secondhand smoke reduction===
According to the [[US Surgeon General]]'s Report, [[secondhand smoke]] is connected to SIDS.<ref>[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/chapter5.pdf Chapter 5]; pages 180–194, [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/news/speeches/06272006a.html secondhand smoke is connected to SIDS].</ref> Infants who die from SIDS tend to have higher concentrations of [[nicotine]] and [[cotinine]] (a biological marker for secondhand smoke exposure) in their body fluids than those who die from other causes.<ref>{{cite pmid|17285322}}</ref>  Parents who smoke can significantly reduce their children's risk of SIDS by either quitting or smoking only outside and leaving their house completely smoke-free.

The maternal pregnancy smoking rate decreased by 38% between 1990 and 2002.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Smoking during pregnancy—United States, 1990–2002 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. |volume=53 |issue=39 |pages=911–5 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15470322 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5339a1.htm |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>

===Sleep positioning===
{{Main|Back to Sleep}}
[[File:back to sleep plot.png|thumb|A plot of SIDS rate from 1988 to 2006]]
Sleeping on the back has been recommended by (among others) the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (starting in 1992) to avoid SIDS, with the catchphrases "Back To Bed" and "[[Back to Sleep]]". The incidence of SIDS has fallen sharply in a number of countries in which the back-to-bed recommendation has been widely adopted, such as the U.S. and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mitchell EA, Hutchison L, Stewart AW |title=The continuing decline in SIDS mortality |journal=Arch Dis Child. |volume=92 |issue=7 |pages=625–6 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17405855 |pmc=2083749 |doi=10.1136/adc.2007.116194}}</ref>

Among the theories supporting the Back-to-Sleep recommendation is the idea that small infants with little or no control of their heads may, while face down, inhale their exhaled breath (high in carbon dioxide) or smother themselves on their bedding; the brain-stem anomaly research (above) suggests that babies with that particular genetic makeup do not react "normally" by moving away from the pooled CO<sub>2</sub>, and thus smother. Another theory<ref>{{cite pmid|12598514}}</ref> is that babies sleep more soundly when placed on their stomachs, and are unable to rouse themselves when they have an incidence of [[sleep apnea]], which is thought to be common in infants.

Hospital neonatal-intensive-care-unit (NICU) staff commonly place preterm newborns on their stomach, although they advise parents to place their infants on their backs after going home from the hospital.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aris C, Stevens TP, Lemura C, et al. |title=NICU nurses' knowledge and discharge teaching related to infant sleep position and risk of SIDS |journal=Adv Neonatal Care |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=281–94 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17045948 |doi=10.1016/j.adnc.2006.06.009}}<br/>{{cite journal |title=Erratum |journal=Adv Neonatal Care |volume=6 |issue=6 |page=340 |year=2006 |month=December |doi=10.1016/j.adnc.2007.01.001}}</ref>

Many have started to link the introduction of the Back-to-Sleep recommendation to the increased number of children suffering from [[Plagiocephaly]] and [[Brachycephaly]]. This is likely due to babies spending more time on their backs.<ref name="steeperclinic">{{cite web |url=http://steeperclinic.com/starband/tummy_time |title=What is tummy time? |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref> However, these theories are currently unproven.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Sleep sacks===
In colder environments where bedding is required to maintain a baby's body temperature, the use of a "[[Sleeping bag#Infant use|baby sleep bag]]" or "sleep sack" is becoming more popular. This is a soft bag with holes for the baby's arms and head. A zipper allows the bag to be closed around the baby. A study published in the ''European Journal of Pediatrics'' in August 1998<ref>{{cite journal |author=L'Hoir MP, Engelberts AC, van Well GT, et al. |title=Risk and preventive factors for cot death in The Netherlands, a low-incidence country |journal=Eur. J. Pediatr. |volume=157 |issue=8 |pages=681–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9727856 |doi=10.1007/s004310050911}}</ref> has shown the protective effects of a sleep sack as reducing the incidence of turning from back to front during sleep, reinforcing putting a baby to sleep on its back for placement into the sleep sack and preventing bedding from coming up over the face which leads to increased temperature and carbon dioxide rebreathing. They conclude in their study "The use of a sleeping-sack should be particularly promoted for infants with a low birth weight." The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends them as a type of bedding that warms the baby without covering its head.<ref name="aap_sacks">{{cite web |title=The Changing Concept of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Diagnostic Coding Shifts, Controversies Regarding the Sleeping Environment, and New Variables to Consider in Reducing Risk |publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |accessdate=2008-11-06 |url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;116/5/1245#SEC15}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
SIDS was responsible for 0.543 deaths per 1,000 live births in the US in 2005.<ref name=wonder>{{cite web |url=http://wonder.cdc.gov |title=Cdc Wonder |publisher=Wonder.cdc.gov |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation, though it is the leading cause of death in healthy infants after one month of age.]]

SIDS deaths in the US decreased from 4,895 in 1992 to 2,247 in 2004.<ref name=Bowman07>Bowman L, Hargrove T. Exposing Sudden Infant Death In America. Scripps Howard News Service. http://dailycamera.com/news/2007/oct/08/saving-babies-exposing-sudden-infant-death-in/</ref> But, during a similar time period, 1989 to 2004, SIDS being listed as the cause of death for sudden infant death (SID) decreased from 80% to 55%.<ref name=Bowman07/> According to Dr. John Kattwinkel, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Special Task Force on SIDS "A lot of us are concerned that the rate (of SIDS) isn't decreasing significantly, but that a lot of it is just code shifting".<ref name=Bowman07/>

A set of 14 epidemiologic characteristics associated with SIDS have been identified:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mage DT, Donner EM |title=Is SIDS at Borkmann's Point? |journal=Medical Hypotheses and Research |volume=1 |issue=2/3 |pages=131–7 |year=2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mage DT, Donner EM |title=The universal age distribution of the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Forensic Science |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=4–8 |year=2011 }}</ref>

# A characteristic 4-parameter [[lognormal]] age distribution;

# No evidence of cause of death at forensic autopsy and death scene investigation;
# SIDS spares infants at birth[?];
# Seasonality: winter maximum, summer minimum;
# Increasing SIDS rate with [[Live Birth Order]];
# Consistent male excess of approximately 50%;
# Low increased risk of SIDS in subsequent siblings of SIDS;
# Parental smoking is a risk factor for SIDS;
# Apparent Life Threatening Events (ALTE) are not a risk factor for subsequent SIDS;
# SIDS risk is greatest during sleep.
