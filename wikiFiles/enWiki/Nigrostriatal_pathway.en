'''Dopaminergic pathways''' are [[neural]] pathways in the [[brain]] which transmit the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]] from one region of the brain to another.<ref name="urlBeyond the Reward Pathway">{{cite web |url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/reward/pathways.html |title=Beyond the Reward Pathway |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref>

The '''nigrostriatal pathway''' is a [[neural pathway]] that connects the [[substantia nigra]] with the [[striatum]]. It is one of the four major [[dopamine pathways]] in the brain, and is particularly involved in the production of movement, as part of a system called the [[basal ganglia]] motor loop.

Loss of dopamine [[neuron]]s in the [[substantia nigra]] is one of the main pathological features of [[Parkinson's disease]],<ref>Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996.</ref> leading to a marked reduction in dopamine function in this pathway. The symptoms of the disease typically do not show themselves until 80-90% of dopamine function has been lost.

This pathway is also implicated in producing [[tardive dyskinesia]], one of the side-effects of [[antipsychotic]] drugs. These medications (particularly the older [[typical antipsychotic]]s) block D<sub>2</sub> [[dopamine receptor]]s in multiple pathways in the brain.

The desired clinical effect of reducing [[psychosis|psychotic]] symptoms is thought to be associated with blocking dopamine function in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] only. However, as many of these drugs are not selective, they block dopamine in all pathways. When this happens in the nigrostriatal pathway, similar movement problems to those found in Parkinson's disease can occur.
