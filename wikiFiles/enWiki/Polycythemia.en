'''Polycythemia''' (also known as '''polycythaemia''' or '''polyglobulia''') is a disease state in which the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells increases. Blood volume proportions can be measured as [[hematocrit]] level. It can be due to an increase in the number of [[red blood cell]]s<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000084902|absolute polycythemia}}</ref> ("absolute polycythemia") or to a decrease in the volume of plasma ("relative polycythemia").<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000084909|relative polycythemia}}</ref> Polycythemia is sometimes called '''erythrocytosis''', but the terms are not synonymous because polycythemia refers to any increase in red blood cells, whereas erythrocytosis only refers to a documented increase of red cell mass.

The emergency treatment of polycythemia (e.g. in hyperviscosity or thrombosis) is by [[venesection]], the removal of blood from the circulation. Depending on the underlying cause, venesection may also be used on a regular basis to reduce the red blood cell count. [[Cytostatic]]s (busulfan, hydroxyurea) are sometimes used if venesection is ineffective or contraindicated.

==Absolute polycythemia==
The overproduction of red blood cells may be due to a primary process in the [[bone marrow]] (a so-called [[myeloproliferative syndrome]]), or it may be a reaction to chronically [[Hypoxia (medical)|low oxygen levels]] or, rarely, a [[malignancy]]. Alternatively, additional red blood cells may have been received through another process--for example, being over-transfused (either accidentally or, as in [[blood doping]], deliberately) or being the recipient twin in a pregnancy-undergoing twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.

===Primary polycythemia===
{{main|Polycythemia vera}}
Primary polycythemias are due to factors intrinsic to red cell precursors. [[Polycythemia vera]] (PCV), polycythemia rubra vera (PRV), or erythremia, occurs when excess red blood cells are produced as a result of an abnormality of the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000589|Polycythemia vera}}</ref>  Often, excess [[white blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s are also produced. Polycythemia vera is classified as a [[myeloproliferative disease]]. Symptoms include headaches and [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and signs on physical examination include an abnormally [[splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]] and/or [[hepatomegaly|liver]]. In some cases, affected individuals may have associated conditions including [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] or [[thrombosis|formation of blood clots]]. Transformation to acute [[leukemia]] is rare. [[Phlebotomy]] is the mainstay of treatment. A hallmark of polycythemia is an elevated hematocrit, with Hct > 55% seen in 83% of cases.<ref>Jacques Wallach; Interpretation of Diagnostic Tests, 7th Ed.; Lippencott Williams & Wilkins</ref> A somatic (non-hereditary) mutation (V617F) in  the ''[[Janus kinase 2|JAK2]]'' gene is found in 95% of cases, though also present in other myeloproliferative disorders.<ref>{{cite book|title=Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment|year=2008|page=438|publisher=McGraw Hill Lange}}</ref>

Primary familial polycythemia, also known as primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP), exists as a benign hereditary condition, in contrast with the myeloproliferative changes associated with acquired [[polycythemia vera]]. In many families, PFCP is due to an [[autosomal dominant]] mutation in the ''EPOR'' [[erythropoietin receptor]] gene.<ref>[[OMIM]] -[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/133100 POLYCYTHEMIA, PRIMARY FAMILIAL AND CONGENITAL; PFCP]</ref>

=== Secondary polycythemia ===
Secondary polycythemia is caused by either natural or artificial increases in the production of [[erythropoietin]], hence an increased production of erythrocytes. In secondary polycythemia, there may be 6 to 8 million and occasionally 9 million erythrocytes per cubic millimeter of blood. Secondary polycythemia resolves when the underlying cause is treated.

Secondary polycythemia in which the production of erythropoietin increases appropriately is called '''physiologic polycythemia.''' 

Conditions which may result in a physiologically appropriate polycythemia include:

*Altitude related - This physiologic polycythemia is a normal adaptation to living at high altitudes (see [[altitude sickness]]). Many athletes train at high altitude to take advantage of this effect &mdash; a legal form of [[blood doping]]. Some individuals believe athletes with primary polycythemia may have a competitive advantage due to greater [[endurance|stamina]]. However, this has yet to be proven due to the multifaceted complications associated with this condition.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}
* Hypoxic disease-associated - for example in cyanotic heart disease where blood oxygen levels are reduced significantly. May also occur as a result of hypoxic lung disease such as [[COPD]] and as a result of chronic obstructive [[sleep apnea]].
*[[Iatrogenic]] - Secondary polycythemia can be induced directly by [[phlebotomy]] (blood letting) to withdraw some blood, concentrate the erythrocytes, and return them to the body.
*Genetic - Heritable causes of secondary polycythemia also exist and are associated with abnormalities in hemoglobin oxygen release. This includes patients who have a special form of hemoglobin known as Hb Chesapeake, which has a greater inherent affinity for oxygen than normal adult hemoglobin. This reduces oxygen delivery to the kidneys, causing increased erythropoietin production and a resultant polycythemia. Hemoglobin Kempsey also produces a similar clinical picture. These conditions are relatively uncommon.

Conditions where the secondary polycythemia is not as a result of physiologic adaptation and occurs irrespective of body needs include:

* Neoplasms - Renal-cell carcinoma  or liver tumors, [[von Hippel-Lindau disease]], and endocrine abnormalities including [[pheochromocytoma]] and [[adrenal adenoma]] with [[Cushing's syndrome]].  
* People whose testosterone levels are high because of the use of [[anabolic steroid]]s, including athletes who abuse steroids, or people on testosterone replacement for [[hypogonadism]], as well as people who take [[erythropoietin]] may develop secondary polycythemia.

===Polycythemia caused by altered oxygen sensing===
Inherited mutations in 3 genes which all result in increased stability of [[hypoxia-inducible factors|Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs)]], leading to increased [[erythropoietin]] production, have been shown to cause erythrocytosis:
*'''[[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] polycythemia:''' An [[autosomal recessive]] form of erythrocytosis which is endemic in  patients from [[Chuvashia Republic|Chuvashia]], an autonomous republic within the [[Russian Federation]]. Chuvash polycythemia is associated with homozygosity for a C598T mutation in the [[von Hippel-Lindau]] gene (''VHL''), which is needed for the destruction of [[hypoxia-inducible factors|HIF]] in the presence of oxygen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ang SO, Chen H, Hirota K, ''et al.'' |title=Disruption of oxygen homeostasis underlies congenital Chuvash polycythemia |journal=Nat.

== Relative polycythemia ==
Relative polycythemia is an apparent rise of the erythrocyte level in the blood; however, the underlying cause is reduced blood plasma. Relative polycythemia is often caused by loss of [[body fluid]]s, such as through burns, dehydration and stress. Rarely, relative polycythemia can be caused by [[apparent polycythemia]] also known as Gaisböck syndrome. Apparent polycythemia primarily affects middle-aged obese men and is associated with [[smoking]], increased [[alcohol]] intake and [[hypertension]].<ref>{{Cite journal
