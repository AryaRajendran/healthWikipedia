'''Zellweger syndrome''', also called cerebrohepatorenal syndrome, is a rare [[congenital disorder]], characterized by the reduction or absence of functional [[peroxisome]]s in the cells of an individual.<ref name="pmid2454948">{{cite pmid|2454948}}</ref> It is one of a family of disorders called [[leukodystrophies]]. Zellweger syndrome is named after [[Hans Zellweger]] (1909â€“1990), a Swiss-American pediatrician, a professor of [[Pediatrics]] and [[Genetics]] at the [[University of Iowa]] who researched this [[Disease|disorder]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1670}}</ref><ref name="pmid1915492">{{cite pmid|1915492}}</ref>

== Molecular basis of disease ==
Zellweger syndrome is an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder caused by mutations in genes that encode peroxins, proteins required for the normal assembly of [[peroxisomes]]. Most commonly, patients have mutations in the ''[[PEX1]]'', ''[[PEX2]]'', ''[[PEX3]]'', ''[[PEX5]]'', ''[[PEX6]]'', ''[[PEX10]]'', ''[[PEX12]]'', ''[[PEX13]]'', ''[[PEX14]]'', ''[[PEX16]]'', ''[[PEX19]]'', and ''[[PEX26]]'' genes.<ref>{{OMIM|214100|Zellweger syndrome; ZS|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> In almost all cases, patients have mutations that inactivate or greatly reduce the activity of both the maternal and paternal copies of one these aforementioned ''PEX'' genes.

As a result of impaired [[peroxisome]] function, an individual's tissues and cells can accumulate [[very long chain fatty acids]] (VLCFA) and branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) that are normally degraded in [[peroxisomes]]. The accumulation of these lipids can impair the normal function of multiple organ systems, as discussed below. In addition, these individuals can show deficient levels of [[plasmalogens]], ether-phospholipids that are especially important for brain and lung function.

== Clinical manifestations of disease ==
Zellweger syndrome is one of three [[peroxisome biogenesis disorders]] which belong to the Zellweger spectrum of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD-ZSD).<ref name="pmid17055079">{{Cite pmid|17055079}}</ref> The other two disorders are [[neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy]] (NALD), and [[infantile Refsum disease]] (IRD).<ref>[http://www.genetests.org/query?dz=pbd GeneReviews: Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders, Zellweger Syndrome Spectrum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="pmid17041890">{{Cite pmid| 17041890}}</ref> Although all have a similar molecular basis for disease, Zellweger syndrome is the most severe of these three disorders.<ref name="doi10.1007/978-0-387-30378-9_26">{{Cite doi|10.1007/978-0-387-30378-9_26}}</ref>

Zellweger syndrome is associated with impaired neuronal migration, neuronal positioning, and [[brain development]].<ref name="pmid17055079"/> In addition, individuals with Zellweger syndrome can show a reduction in [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[myelin]] (particularly cerebral), which is referred to as [[hypomyelination]]. Myelin is critical for normal CNS functions and, in this regard, serves to insulate nerve fibers in the brain. Patients can also show postdevelopmental sensorineuronal degeneration that leads to a progressive loss of hearing and vision.<ref name="pmid17055079"/>

Zellweger syndrome can also affect the function of many other organ systems. Patients can show craniofacial abnormalities (such as a high forehead, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, epicanthal folds, midface hypoplasia, and a large fontanel), [[hepatomegaly]] (enlarged liver), [[chondrodysplasia punctata]] (punctate calcification of the cartilage in specific regions of the body), eye abnormalities, and [[renal cysts]].<ref name="pmid17055079"/> Newborns may present with profound [[hypotonia]] (low muscle tone), seizures, apnea, and an inability to eat.<ref name="pmid17055079"/><ref name="doi10.1007/978-0-387-30378-9_26"/>

== Molecular diagnostics ==
In addition to genetic tests involving the sequencing of ''PEX'' genes,<ref name="pmid15542397">{{cite pmid|15542397}}</ref><ref name="pmid19105186">{{cite pmid|19105186}}</ref> biochemical tests have proven highly effective for the diagnosis of Zellweger syndrome and other peroxisomal disorders.  Typically, Zellweger syndrome patients show elevated [[very long chain fatty acids]] in their [[blood plasma]].  Cultured primarily skin fibroblasts obtained from patients show elevated [[very long chain fatty acids]], impaired [[very long chain fatty acid]] [[beta-oxidation]], [[phytanic acid]] [[alpha-oxidation]], [[pristanic acid]] [[alpha-oxidation]], and [[plasmalogen]] biosynthesis.<ref name="pmid17055079"/>

==Prognosis==
Currently, there is no cure for Zellweger syndrome, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Infections should be guarded against to prevent such complications as [[pneumonia]] and respiratory distress. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Patients usually do not survive beyond one year of age.<ref name="pmid17055079"/>
