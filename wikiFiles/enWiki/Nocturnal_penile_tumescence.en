'''Nocturnal penile tumescence''' (abbreviated as '''NPT''') is a spontaneous [[erection]] of the [[Human penis|penis]] during [[sleep]] or when waking up. All men without physiological [[erectile dysfunction]] experience this phenomenon, usually three to five times during the night, typically during [[REM sleep]].<ref name="WebMD">{{cite web

==Diagnostic value==
The existence and predictability of nocturnal [[tumescence]] is used by [[sexual health]] practitioners to ascertain whether a given case of erectile dysfunction (E.D.) is [[psychological]] or [[physiological]] in origin. A patient presenting with E.D. is fitted with an elastic device to wear around his penis during sleep; the device detects changes in girth and relays the information to a computer for later analysis. If nocturnal tumescence is detected, then the E.D. is presumed to be due to a [[psychosomatic illness]] such as sexual anxiety; if not, then it is presumed to be due to a physiological cause.<ref name="WebMD" />

==Mechanism==
The cause of NPT is not known with certainty. Bancroft (2005) hypothesizes that the [[norepinephrine|noradrenergic]] neurons of the [[locus ceruleus]] are [[Neuron#Action on other neurons|inhibitory]] to penile erection, and that the cessation of their discharge that occurs during REM sleep may allow [[testosterone]]-related excitatory actions to manifest as NPT.<ref>Bancroft, J. (2005). "[http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/cgi/content/full/186/3/411 The endocrinology of sexual arousal]," ''[[Journal of Endocrinology]]'', 186:411-427</ref>

Evidence supporting the possibility that a full [[bladder]] can stimulate an erection has existed for some time and is characterized as a 'reflex erection'. The nerves that control a manâ€™s ability to have a reflex erection are located in the [[sacral nerves]] (S2-S4) of the [[spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite web

This mild stimulus which during the day is normally suppressed in adult males by competing stimuli and other distractions; during sleep the absence of such factors could instigate a reflex erection.{{fact|date=December 2011}}

The possibility of a full bladder causing an erection, especially during sleep, is perhaps further supported by the beneficial physiological effect of an erection inhibiting urination, thereby helping to avoid [[nocturnal enuresis]].{{fact|date=December 2011}}

==In popular culture==
Research into the causes of NPT was the subject of "[[List of Beavis and Butt-head episodes#Season 6 (1995/96)|The Mystery of Morning Wood]]", a 1995 episode of the animated comedy series ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.
