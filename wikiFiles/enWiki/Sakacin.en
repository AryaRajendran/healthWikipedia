Sakacin T is a class II bacteriocin.  It is produced from a single operon with sakacin X; there are three distinct promoters in the operon, the two sakacins are chemically distinct, though similar.<ref name="pmid15183888">{{cite journal |author=Vaughan A, O' Mahony J, Eijsink VG, O' Connell-Motherway M, van Sinderen D |title=Transcriptional analysis of bacteriocin production by malt isolate Lactobacillus sakei 5 |journal=[[FEMS Microbiol.

Sakacin X is a class IIa bacteriocin.  It appears in the references with Sakacin T (above).

Sakacin Z was apparently never published and is known from a reference to unpublished data (refers to B. Ray, under Table 6, page 551) <ref>{{cite book |title=Natural Food Antimicrobial Systems |chapter=Pediocin |editor= Naidu AS |author=Ray B, Miller KW |year=2000 |isbn=0-8493-2047-X |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida}}</ref>

It seems that the sakacin namers have a convention problem.  Sakacin Z was named because it is produced by ''L. sakei'' Z, just as Sakacin 670 was named because it was produced by ''L. sakei'' 670; but the remaining naming convention uses letters A-Z, of which few are unambiguously available.  Worse yet, many strains produce several sakacins <ref name="pmid16997410">{{cite journal |author=Héquet A, Laffitte V, Simon L, De Sousa-Caetano D, Thomas C, Fremaux C, Berjeaud JM |title=Characterization of new bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria isolated using a medium designed to simulate inhibition of Listeria by Lactobacillus sakei 2512 on meat |journal=[[Int.

==Applications of the Sakacins==

Many were actually discovered in food contexts, like Greek dry cured sausage (sakacin B).
