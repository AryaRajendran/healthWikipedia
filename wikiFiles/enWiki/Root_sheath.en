The inner or epidermic coat of the [[hair follicle]] is closely adherent to the root of the hair, and consists of two strata named respectively the outer and inner '''root sheaths'''; 

==Outer Root Sheath==
The '''outer root sheath''' corresponds with the stratum mucosum ([[Stratum germinativum]] and [[Stratum Spinosum]])<ref>[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/234 The Common Integument - Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body - Yahoo! Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of the epidermis, and resembles it in the rounded form and soft character of its cells; at the bottom of the hair follicle these cells become continuous with those of the root of the hair. 

==Inner Root Sheath==
The '''inner root sheath''' consists of 
* (1) a delicate cuticle next the hair, composed of a single layer of imbricated scales with atrophied nuclei; 
* (2) [[Huxley's layer]]
* (3) [[Henle's layer]]

The term "trichilemmal" refers to the outer root sheath.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/trichilemmal trichilemmal: Definition and Much More from Answers.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
