It was introduced in 1991 by the [[International Diabetes Federation]] and the [[World Health Organization]] in response to the alarming rise of diabetes around the world. World Diabetes Day is a campaign that features a new theme chosen by the International Diabetes Federation each year to address issues facing the global diabetes community. While the campaigns last the whole year, the day itself marks the birthday of [[Frederick Banting]] who, along with [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]], first conceived the idea which led to the discovery of [[insulin]] in 1922.
