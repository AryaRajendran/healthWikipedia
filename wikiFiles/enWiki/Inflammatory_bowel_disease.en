In [[medicine]], '''inflammatory bowel disease''' ('''IBD''') is a group of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] conditions of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] and [[small intestine]]. The major types of IBD are [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]].<ref name=Baumgart2>{{cite journal | author = Baumgart DC, Carding SR | year = 2007 | title = Inflammatory bowel disease: cause and immunobiology. | journal = The Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9573 | pages = 1627–40 | pmid =  17499605 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60750-8 }}</ref><ref name=Baumgart>{{cite journal | author = Baumgart DC, Sandborn WJ | year = 2007 | title = Inflammatory bowel disease: clinical aspects and established and evolving therapies. | journal = The Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9573 | pages = 1641–57 | pmid = 17499606 | doi =  10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60751-X }}</ref><ref name="pmid17653185">{{cite journal |author=Xavier RJ, Podolsky DK |title= Unravelling the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. |journal=Nature |volume=448 |issue=7152 |pages=427–34 |year=2007 | pmid= 17653185 | doi=10.1038/nature06005}}</ref>

==Classification==
The main forms of IBD are [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]] (UC). Inflammatory bowel diseases are considered [[autoimmune diseases]], in which the body's own immune system attacks elements of the digestive system.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thegreatbowelmovement.org/awareness-tools/ibd-facts/ | title=IBD Facts}}</ref>

Accounting for far fewer cases are other forms of IBD, which are not always classified as typical IBD:
* [[Collagenous colitis]]
* [[Lymphocytic colitis]]
* [[Ischaemic colitis]]
* [[Diversion colitis]]
* [[Behçet's disease]]
* [[Indeterminate colitis]]

The main difference between Crohn's disease and UC is the ''location'' and ''nature'' of the inflammatory changes. Crohn's can affect any part of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], from [[mouth]] to [[anus]] (''[[skip lesion]]s''), although a majority of the cases start in the [[terminal ileum]]. Ulcerative colitis, in contrast, is restricted to the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] and the rectum.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ccfa.org | title=Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America}}</ref>
[[Light microscopy|Microscopically]], ulcerative colitis is restricted to the [[mucosa]] ([[epithelium|epithelial lining]] of the gut), while Crohn's disease affects the whole bowel wall ("transmural lesions").

Finally, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis present with extra-intestinal manifestations (such as liver problems, arthritis, skin manifestations and eye problems) in different proportions.

Rarely, a definitive diagnosis of neither Crohn's disease nor ulcerative colitis can be made because of idiosyncrasies in the presentation. In this case, a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis may be made. Although a recognised definition, not all centres refer to this.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Symptoms in CD vs. UC}}
Although very different diseases, both may present with any of the following symptoms: abdominal pain, [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[rectal bleeding]], severe internal cramps/muscle spasms in the region of the pelvis and [[weight loss]]. [[Anemia]] is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/nrgastro.2010.151}}</ref> Associated complaints or diseases include [[arthritis]], [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], and [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]]. Diagnosis is generally by assessment of inflammatory markers in stool followed by [[colonoscopy]] with [[biopsy]] of pathological lesions.

==Treatment==
{{Treatment in CD vs. UC}}
Optimal treatment of inflammatory bowel disease depends on what form it consists of. For example, [[mesalazine]] is more useful in [[ulcerative colitis]] than in [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name=agabegi2nd>Pages 152-156 (Section: Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD)) in:{{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Generally, depending on the level of severity, IBD may require [[immunosuppression]] to control the symptom, such as [[prednisone]], [[TNF inhibitor|TNF inhibition]], [[azathioprine]] (Imuran), [[methotrexate]], or [[6-mercaptopurine]].  More commonly, treatment of IBD requires a form of [[mesalazine]]. 

Often, [[Glucocorticoid|anti-inflammatory steroid]]s are used to control disease flares and were once acceptable as a maintenance drug. In use for several years in Crohn's disease patients and recently in patients with ulcerative colitis, [[Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease|biologicals have been used]] such as TNF inhibitors. Severe cases may require [[surgery]], such as [[bowel resection]], [[strictureplasty]] or a temporary or permanent [[colostomy]] or [[ileostomy]]. [[Alternative medicine]] treatments for bowel disease exist in various forms, however such methods concentrate on controlling underlying pathology in order to avoid prolonged steroidal exposure or surgical excisement.<ref>[http://www.gaiagarden.com/articles/therapeuticapplications/ta_treating_bowel_disease.php A Phytotherapeutic Approach to Lower Bowel Disease] Gaia Garden</ref>

Usually the treatment is started by administering drugs with high anti-inflammatory effects, such as prednisone. Once the inflammation is successfully controlled, the patient is usually switched to a lighter drug to keep the disease in remission, such as [[Asacol]], a [[mesalazine]]. If unsuccessful, a combination of the aforementioned immunosuppression drugs with a [[mesalazine]] (which may also have an anti-inflammatory effect) may or may not be administered, depending on the patient.

A relatively new treatment option is [[fecal bacteriotherapy]] (FBT), which has been used to successfully treat IBD in several small studies.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111031114945.htm Fecal Microbiota Transplants Effective Treatment for C.

There is evidence of an infections contribution to inflammatory bowel disease in some patients and this subgroup of patients may benefit from antibiotic therapy.<ref name="pmid15740475">{{cite journal |author=Ohkusa T, Sato N |title=Antibacterial and antimycobacterial treatment for inflammatory bowel disease |journal=J.

Due to raised levels of inflammatory cytokines such as [[hepcidin]], [[parenteral iron]] is the preferred treatment option as it bypasses the gastrointestinal system, has lower incidence of adverse events and enables quicker treatment.

Due to the fact that the disease might be triggered by the blooms of a rare type of gut bacteria<ref>{{cite journal | author=Andy Coghlan | title = Milk fats clue to inflammatory bowel disease | journal=New Scientist | year = 2012}}</ref> some anti-bacterial drugs like [[chloroxine]] might be able to dispense the problem. A wider study is needed to confirm this.

==Prognosis==
{{Complications of CD vs. UC}}
While IBD can limit quality of life because of pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and other socially unacceptable symptoms, it is rarely fatal on its own.  Fatalities due to complications such as [[toxic megacolon]], [[bowel perforation]] and surgical complications are also rare.

While patients of IBD do have an increased risk of  [[colorectal cancer]], this is usually caught much earlier than the general population in routine surveillance of the colon by colonoscopy, and therefore patients are much more likely to survive.

New evidence suggests that patients with IBD may have an elevated risk of [[endothelial dysfunction]] and [[coronary artery disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Roifman I, Sun YC, Fedwick JP, Panaccione R, Buret AG, Liu H, Rostom A, Anderson TJ, Beck PL | title = Evidence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease

A recent literature review by Gandhi et al. described that IBD patients over the age of 65 and females are at increased risk of coronary artery disease despite the lack of traditional risk factors.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gandhi S, Narula N, Marshall JK, Farkouh M | title = Are patients with inflammatory bowel disease at increased risk of coronary artery disease?

The goal of treatment is toward achieving remission, after which the patient is usually switched to a lighter drug with fewer potential side effects. Every so often, an acute resurgence of the original symptoms may appear; this is known as a "flare-up". Depending on the circumstances, it may go away on its own or require medication. The time between flare-ups may be anywhere from weeks to years, and varies wildly between patients - a few have never experienced a flare-up.

==Research==
The following treatment strategies are not used routinely, but appear promising in most forms of inflammatory bowel disease.

Initial reports<ref>{{cite journal |author=Summers RW, Elliott DE, Qadir K, Urban JF, Thompson R, Weinstock JV |title=Trichuris suis seems to be safe and possibly effective in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=2034–41 |year=2003|pmid=14499784 |doi= 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2003.07660.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0002-9270&date=2003&volume=98&issue=9&spage=2034}}
</ref> suggest that "[[helminthic therapy]]" may not only prevent but even control IBD: a drink with roughly 2,500 ova of the ''[[Trichuris suis]]'' helminth taken twice monthly decreased symptoms markedly in many patients. It is even speculated that an effective "immunization" procedure could be developed—by ingesting the cocktail at an early age.

Prebiotics and probiotics are showing increasing promise as treatments for IBD<ref>{{cite journal |author=Furrie E, Macfarlane S, Kennedy A, ''et al.''|title=Synbiotic therapy (Bifidobacterium longum/Synergy 1) initiates resolution of inflammation in patients with active ulcerative colitis: a randomised controlled pilot trial |journal=Gut |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=242–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15647189 |pmc=1774839 |doi=10.1136/gut.2004.044834|url=}}</ref> and in some studies have proven to be as effective as prescription drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kruis W, Fric P, Pokrotnieks J, ''et al.'' |title=Maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis with the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is as effective as with standard mesalazine|journal=Gut |volume=53 |issue=11 |pages=1617–23 |year=2004 |pmid=15479682 |pmc=1774300 |doi=10.1136/gut.2003.037747 |url=}}</ref>

In 2005 [[New Scientist]] published a joint study by [[Bristol University]] and the [[University of Bath]] on the apparent healing power of [[cannabis]] on IBD. Reports that cannabis eased IBD symptoms indicated the possible existence of cannabinoid receptors in the intestinal lining, which respond to molecules in the plant-derived chemicals. CB1 cannabinoid receptors – which are known to be present in the brain – exist in the endothelial cells which line the gut, it is thought that they are involved in repairing the lining of the gut when damaged.<ref name="Wright K, Rooney N, Feeney M, et al. 2005 437–53">{{cite journal |author=Wright K, Rooney N, Feeney M, ''et al.''|title=Differential expression of cannabinoid receptors in the human colon: cannabinoids promote epithelial wound healing |journal=Gastroenterology|volume=129 |issue=2 |pages=437–53 |year=2005 |pmid=16083701 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.05.026 |url=}}</ref>

The team deliberately damaged the cells to cause inflammation of the gut lining and then added synthetically produced cannabinoids; the result was that gut started to heal: the broken cells were repaired and brought back closer together to mend the tears. It is believed that in a healthy gut, natural endogenous cannabinoids are released from endothelial cells when they are injured, which then bind to the CB1 receptors. The process appears to set off a wound-healing reaction, and when people use cannabis, the cannabinoids bind to these receptors in the same way.<ref name="Wright K, Rooney N, Feeney M, et al. 2005 437–53"/>

Previous studies have shown that CB1 receptors located on the nerve cells in the gut respond to cannabinoids by slowing gut motility, therefore reducing the painful muscle contractions associated with diarrhea. The team also discovered another cannabinoid receptor, CB2, in the guts of IBD sufferers, which was not present in healthy guts. These receptors, which also respond to chemicals in cannabis, appear to be associated with apoptosis – programmed cell death – and may have a role in suppressing the overactive immune system and reducing inflammation by mopping up excess cells.<ref name="Wright K, Rooney N, Feeney M, et al. 2005 437–53"/>
