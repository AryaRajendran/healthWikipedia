'''Cryptosporidiosis''', also known as '''crypto''',<ref name=cdc>{{cite web |title=Cryptosporidiosis |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=5 February 2009 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/crypto/ }}</ref> is a [[parasitic disease]] caused by ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', a [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]] in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the [[intestine]]s and is typically an acute short-term infection. It is spread through the [[fecal-oral route]], often through contaminated water;<ref name=cdc/> the main symptom is self-limiting [[diarrhea]] in people with intact immune systems. In immunocompromised individuals, such as [[AIDS]] patients, the symptoms are particularly severe and often fatal. 

''Cryptosporidium'' is the organism most commonly isolated in [[HIV positive]] patients presenting with diarrhea. Treatment is symptomatic, with fluid rehydration, electrolyte correction and management of any pain.  Despite not being identified until 1976, it is one of the most common waterborne diseases and is found worldwide.  The parasite is transmitted by environmentally hardy [[microbial cyst]]s (oocysts) that, once ingested, exist in the [[small intestine]] and result in an infection of intestinal [[epithelial tissue]].

The organism was first described in 1907 by Tyzzer, who recognised it was a [[coccidia]]n.

== General characteristics of Cryptosporidium==
''Cryptosporidium'' is a [[protozoan]] [[pathogen]] of the Phylum Apicomplexa and causes a diarrheal illness called cryptosporidiosis.  Other apicomplexan pathogens include the [[malaria]] parasite ''[[Plasmodium]]'', and ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', the causative agent of [[toxoplasmosis]].  Unlike ''Plasmodium'', which transmits via a [[mosquito]] vector, ''Cryptosporidium'' does not require an insect vector and is capable of completing its life cycle within a single host, resulting in microbial cyst stages which are excreted in [[feces]] and are capable of transmission to a new host.  However, studies show that synanthropic filth flies may be involved in the transmission of human and animal cryptosporidiosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Graczyk TK, Fayer R, Knight R, ''et al.'' |title=Mechanical transport and transmission of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts by wild filth flies |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=63 |issue=3-4 |pages=178–83 |year=2000 |pmid=11388511 |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/63/3/178}}</ref>

The pattern of ''Cryptosporidium'' life cycle fits well that of other intestinal homogeneous coccidian genera of the suborder ''[[Eimeriina]]'': macro- and microgamonts develop independently; a microgamont gives rise to numerous male gametes; and oocysts serving for parasites' spreading in the environment.

Electron microscopic studies made from the 1970s have shown the intracellular, although extracytoplasmic localization of ''Cryptosporidium'' species. 

These species possess a number of unusual features: 

* an endogenous phase of development in microvilli of epithelial surfaces
* two morphofunctional types of oocysts
* the smallest number of sporozoites per oocyst
* a multi-membraneous "feeder" organelle

DNA studies suggest a relationship with the gregarines rather than the coccidia.<ref name="Carreno1999">{{cite journal |author=Carreno RA, Martin DS, Barta JR |title=Cryptosporidium is more closely related to the gregarines than to coccidia as shown by phylogenetic analysis of apicomplexan parasites inferred using small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences |journal=Parasitol.

The [[genome]] of ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' was sequenced in 2004 and was found to be unusual amongst [[Eukaryote]]s in that the [[mitochondria]] seem not to [[mitochondrial DNA|contain DNA]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1094786 |title=Complete Genome Sequence of the Apicomplexan, ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' |year=2004 |author=Abrahamsen, M.

A number of ''Cryptosporidium'' infect mammals. In humans, the main causes of disease are ''C. parvum'' and ''C. hominis'' (previously ''C. parvum'' genotype 1). ''C. canis'', ''C. felis'', ''C. meleagridis'', and ''C. muris'' can also cause disease in humans.

Cryptosporidiosis is typically an acute short-term infection but can become severe and non-resolving in children and immunocompromised individuals. In humans, it remains in the lower intestine and may remain for up to five weeks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The parasite is transmitted by environmentally hardy microbial cysts (oocysts) that, once ingested, exist in the small intestine and result in an infection of intestinal epithelial tissue.

==Transmission==
{{Food safety}}
[[Infection]] is through contaminated material such as earth, [[water]], uncooked or cross-contaminated [[food]] that has been in contact with the feces of an infected individual or [[animal]]. Contact must then be transferred to the mouth and swallowed. It is especially prevalent amongst those in regular contact with bodies of fresh water including recreational water such as swimming pools.   Other potential sources include insufficiently treated water supplies, contaminated food, or exposure to feces.<ref name=cdc/>  The high resistance of ''Cryptosporidium'' [[oocysts]] to [[disinfectant]]s such as [[chlorine]] [[bleach]] enables them to survive for long periods and still remain infective.<ref name=Carpenter_1999>{{cite journal | author = Carpenter C, Fayer R, Trout J, Beach M | title = Chlorine disinfection of recreational water for Cryptosporidium parvum | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 579–84 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10458969 | doi = 10.3201/eid0504.990425 | pmc = 2627758}}</ref> Some outbreaks have happened in day care related to diaper changes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Teresa Ortega M, Vergara A, Guimbao J, Clavel A, Gavín P, Ruiz A |title=[Cryptosporidium hominis diarrhea outbreak and transmission linked to diaper infant use] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Med Clin (Barc) |volume=127 |issue=17 |pages=653–6 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17169283 |doi= |url=http://www.elsevier.es/en/linksolver/ft/ivp/0025-7753/127/653}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
[[Symptom]]s appear from two to ten days after infection, with an average of 7 days,<ref name=cdc/> and last for up to two weeks, or in some cases, up to one month.<ref name=cdc/> There are 3 possible forms of the illness in immunocompetent people.  The disease can be asymptomatic or cause acute diarrhea or persistent diarrhea that can last for a few weeks. Diarrhea is usually watery with mucus.  It is very rare to find blood or leukocytes in the diarrhea.<ref name=Chen>{{cite journal |author=Chen XM, Keithly JS, Paya CV, LaRusso NF |title=Cryptosporidiosis |journal=N. Engl. J.

As well as watery diarrhea, there is often [[stomach]] pains or [[cramp]]s and a low [[fever]]. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting,<ref name=harvey>{{cite book |author=Harvey, Richard A.; Champe, Pamela C.; Fisher, Bruce D. |title=Lippincott’s Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |pages=367, 388 |edition=2nd}}</ref> malabsorption<ref name=winn>{{cite book |author=Winn Jr., Washington; Allen, Stephen; Janda, William; Koneman, Elmer; Procop, Gary; Schreckenberger, Paul; Woods, Gail |title=Koneman’s Color Atlas and Textbook of Diagnostic Microbiology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |pages=1267–70 |edition=6th}}</ref> and dehydration.<ref name=medline>{{cite web |title=Cryptosporidiosis |date=16 January 2009 |publisher=Medline Plus |quote=A service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/cryptosporidiosis.html}}</ref> The individuals who are [[asymptomatic]] (have no symptoms) are nevertheless  infective, and thus can pass on the infection to others. Even after symptoms have finally subsided an individual is still infective for some weeks.
 
Severe diseases, including [[pancreatitis]], can occur.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hawkins S, Thomas R, Teasdale C | title = Acute pancreatitis: a new finding in cryptosporidium enteritis | journal = Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) | volume = 294 | issue = 6570 | pages = 483–4 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3103738 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.294.6570.483-a | pmc = 1245527}}</ref>

Immunocompromised people, as well as very young or very old people, can develop a more severe form of cryptosporidiosis.<ref name=brooks>{{cite book |author=Brooks, Geo. F.; Butel, Janet S.; Morse, Stephen A. |title=Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg’s Medical Microbiology |publisher=Lange Medical Books/McGraw Hill |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=684–5 |edition=23rd}}</ref>  There are 4 clinical presentations for patients with AIDS.  4% have no symptoms, 29% have a transient infection, 60% have chronic diarrhea, and 8% have a severe, cholera-like infection.  With transient infections diarrhea ends within 2 months and Cryptosporidium is no longer found in the feces.  Chronic diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts for 2 or more months.  The most severe form results in the patients excreting at least 2 liters of watery diarrhea per day.<ref name="Chen"/>  They can lose up to 25 liters per day.<ref name=ryan>{{cite book |author=Ryan, Kenneth J.; Ray, C. George |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology: An Introduction to Infectious Disease |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2004 |isbn= |pages=727–730 |edition=4th}}</ref>  AIDS patients can have up to 10 stools per day.  They experience severe malabsorption and can have 10% weight loss. Many of them never completely eliminate ''Cryptosporidium'' from their bodies.<ref name=Chen>{{cite journal |author=Chen Q, Schlichtherle M, Wahlgren M |title=Molecular Aspects of Severe Malaria |journal=Clin.

Rev. |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=439–50 |year=2000 |month=July |pmid=10885986 |pmc=88942 |doi=10.1128/CMR.13.3.439-450.2000 |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10885986}}</ref>

When ''Cryptosporidium'' spreads beyond the intestine, as it can predominantly in patients with AIDS, it can reach the lungs, middle ear, pancreas, and stomach.  Thus, one symptom is pain in the right upper quadrant.<ref name=chen/>  The parasite can infect the biliary tract, causing biliary cryptosporidiosis.   This can result in cholecystitis and cholangitis.<ref name=ryan/>

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Cryptosporidiosis 01.png|thumb|300px|Life cycle of ''Cryptosporidium'' spp.]]
''Cryptosporidium'' has a [[spore]] phase ([[oocyst]]) and in this state it can survive for lengthy periods outside a host. It can also resist many common disinfectants, notably chlorine-based disinfectants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no4/carpenter.htm |title=Chlorine Disinfection of Recreational Water for ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' |publisher=CDC |accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>

The life cycle of ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' consists of an asexual stage and a sexual stage.<ref name=cdc/>  After being ingested, the oocysts excyst in the small intestine.  They release sporozoites that attach to the microvilli of the epithelial cells of the small intestine.  From there they become trophozoites that reproduce asexually by multiple fission, a process known as schizogony.  The trophozoites develop into Type 1 [[meront]]s [1] that contain 8 daughter cells.<ref name=ryan/>  

These daughter cells are Type 1 merozoites, which get released by the meronts.  Some of these merozoites can cause autoinfection by attaching to epithelial cells.  Others of these merozoites become Type II meronts,<ref name=chen/> which contain 4 Type II merozoites.<ref name=ryan/>  These merozoites get released and they attach to the epithelial cells.  From there they become either macrogamonts or microgamonts.<ref name=chen/>  These are the female and male sexual forms, respectively.<ref name=ryan/>  This stage, when sexual forms arise, is called gametogony.<ref name=murray>Murray, Patrick R., Ken S. Rosenthal, and Michael A. Pfaller. Medical Microbiology. 5th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier Inc., 2005: 855-856.</ref> 

Zygotes are formed by microgametes from the microgamont penetrating the macrogamonts.  The zygotes develop into oocysts of two types.<ref name=chen/>  20% of oocysts have thin walls and so can reinfect the host by rupturing and releasing sporozoites that start the process over again.<ref name=ryan/>  The thick-walled oocysts are excreted into the environment.<ref name=chen/>  The oocysts are mature and infective upon being excreted.<ref name=ryan/>  They can survive in the environment for months.<ref name=gideon>{{cite web |title=Cryptosporidiosis |publisher=Gideon |date=23 February 2009 |url=http://web.gideononline.com/web/tox_diseases/index.php?disease=355&view=General |quote=Trial subscription required to access}}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
The oocysts are ovoid or spherical and measure 5 to 6 micrometers across.  When in flotation preparations they appear highly refractile.  The oocysts contains up to 4 sporozoites that are bow-shaped.<ref name=winn/>

As few as 2 to 10 oocysts can initiate an infection.<ref name=chen/>  The parasite is located in the brush border of the epithelial cells of the small intestine.<ref name=brooks/>  They are mainly located in the jejunum.  When the sporozoites attach the epithelial cells’ membrane envelops them.  Thus, they are “intracellular but extracytoplasmic”.<ref name=ryan/>  The parasite can cause damage to the microvilli where it attaches.<ref name=winn/>  The infected human excretes the most oocysts during the first week.<ref name=ryan/>  Oocysts can be excreted for weeks after the diarrhea subsides.<ref name=cdc/>

The immune system reduces the formation of Type 1 merozoites as well as the number of thin-walled oocysts.<ref name=ryan/>  This helps prevent autoinfection.   B cells do not help with the initial response or the fight to eliminate the parasite.<ref name=chen>{{cite journal |author=Chen W, Harp JA, Harmsen AG |title=Cryptosporidium parvum infection in gene-targeted B cell-deficient mice |journal=J. Parasitol. |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=391–3 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12760662 |doi=10.1645/0022-3395(2003)089[0391:CPIIGB]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref>

==Diagnostic tests==
There are many diagnostic tests for ''Cryptosporidium''.  They include microscopy, staining, and detection of antibodies.  Microscopy <ref name=cdc/> can help identify oocysts in fecal matter.<ref name=brooks/>  To increase the chance of finding the oocysts, the diagnostician should inspect at least 3 stool samples.<ref name=murray/>  There are several techniques to concentrate either the stool sample or the oocysts.  The modified formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) concentration method concentrates the stool.<ref name=winn/>  Both the modified zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation technique and the Sheather’s sugar flotation procedure can concentrate the oocysts by causing them to float.<ref name=murray/>  Another form of microscopy is fluorescent microscopy done by staining with auramine.<ref name=brooks/>  

Other staining techniques include acid-fast staining,<ref name=chen/> which will stain the oocysts red.<ref name=winn/>  One type of acid-fast stain is the Kinyoun technique.<ref name=gideon/>  Giemsa staining can also be performed.<ref name=ryan/>  Part of the small intestine can be stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E), which will show oocysts attached to the epithelial cells.<ref name=winn/>
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:crypto acidfast.jpg|thumb|Acid-fast stain showing ''Cryptosporidium'' oocysts.]] -->

Detecting antigens is yet another way to diagnose the disease.  This can be done with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) techniques.<ref name=cdc/>  It can also be achieved through indirect immunofluorescence assay.<ref name=murray/>  Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) also detects antigens.<ref name=brooks/>

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is another way to diagnose cryptosporidiosis.  It can even identify the specific species of ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref name=cdc/>  If the patient is thought to have biliary cryptosporidiosis, then an appropriate diagnostic technique is ultrasonography.  If that returns normal results, the next step would be to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.<ref name=chen/>

==Treatment==
There is no reliable treatment for cryptosporidium enteritis; certain agents such as [[paromomycin]], [[atovaquone]], [[nitazoxanide]],<ref name="pmid15640710">{{cite journal |author=Smith HV, Corcoran GD |title=New drugs and treatment for cryptosporidiosis |journal=Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=557–64 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15640710 |doi= 10.1097/00001432-200412000-00008|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0951-7375&volume=17&issue=6&spage=557}}</ref> and [[azithromycin]] are sometimes used, but they usually have only temporary effects.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Treatment is primarily supportive. Fluids need to be replaced orally. A lactose-free diet should be taken as tolerated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In rare situations, intravenous fluids may be required. Antibiotics are not usually helpful, and are primarily reserved for persons with severe disease and a weak immune system. Sometimes relapses happen.

===In the immunocompetent===
The majority of immunocompetent individuals suffer a short (less than 2 weeks) self-limiting course that requires supportive care with rehydration and occasionally antidiarrhoeal medication, and ends with spontaneous recovery. Nitazoxanide is one drug that the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]] has approved for use in immunocompetent people to combat diarrhea.<ref name=cdc/>  Spiramycin can help shorten the amount of time oocysts are passed, as well as the duration of diarrhoea in children.<ref name=chen/>

===In the immunocompromised===
In immunocompromised individuals, such as AIDS patients, cryptosporidiosis resolves slowly or not at all, and frequently causes a particularly severe and permanent form of watery diarrhea coupled with a greatly decreased ability to absorb key nutrients through the intestinal tract. The result is progressively severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, wasting, and eventual death.  Spiramycin can help treat diarrhea in patients who are in the early stages of AIDS.<ref name=murray/>  The mortality rate for infected AIDS patients is generally based on [[CD4+]] marker counts; patients with CD4+ counts over 180 cells/mm³ generally recover with supportive hospital care and medication, but in patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm³, the effects are usually fatal within three to six months. During the Milwaukee cryptosporidiosis epidemic (the largest of its kind), 73% of AIDS patients with CD4+ counts lower than 50 cells/mm³ and 36% of those with counts between 50 and 200 cells/mm³ died within the first year of contracting the infection.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ian |last=Gilson M.D. |coauthors=Buggy, Brian P.

Currently, the best approach is to improve the immune status in immunodeficient individuals, which causes the diarrhea to resolve itself in most cases. Biliar drainage may be needed in case the biliary tract is affected.

Currently, research is being done in molecular-based immunotherapy.  For example, synthetic isoflavone derivates have been shown to fight off ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' in vitro and in a gerbil.  Derivates of nitazoxanide, which are synthetic nitro- or nonnitrothiazolide compounds, have also shown promising results in vitro.<ref name=gargala>{{cite journal |author=Gargala G |title=Drug treatment and novel drug target against Cryptosporidium |journal=Parasite |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=275–81 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18814694 }}</ref>

== Treatment of drinking water ==
Many [[Water purification|treatment plants]] that take raw water from [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] for public [[drinking water]] production use conventional filtration technologies. This involves a series of processes, including coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. Direct filtration, which is typically used to treat water with low particulate levels, includes coagulation and filtration, but not sedimentation. Other common filtration processes, including [[slow sand filter]]s,  [[diatomaceous earth|diatomaceous earth filter]]s and membranes will remove 99% of ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/safewater/mdbp/ieswtrwhatdoesitmeantoyou.pdf |title=The Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule – What Does it Mean to You? |publisher=USEPA |format=pdf |accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref> Membranes and bag and cartridge filters remove ''Cryptosporidium''  product-specifically.

While ''Cryptosporidium'' is highly resistant to chlorine disinfection,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Korich DG, Mead JR, Madore MS, Sinclair NA, Sterling CR |title=Effects of ozone, chlorine dioxide, chlorine, and monochloramine on Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst viability |journal=Appl.

The required levels of chlorine generally preclude the use of chlorine disinfection as a reliable method to control ''Cryptosporidium'' in drinking water. Ultraviolet light treatment at relatively low doses will inactivate ''Cryptosporidium''.

One of the largest challenges in identifying outbreaks is the ability to identify ''Cryptosporidium'' in the [[laboratory]].  Real-time monitoring technology is now able to detect ''Cryptosporidium'' with online systems, unlike the spot and batch testing methods used in the past. 

The most reliable way to decontaminate drinking water which may be contaminated by ''Cryptosporidium'' is to boil it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7589839.stm |title=Boil water warning 'precaution' |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 September 2009 | date=2 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4484946.stm |title=Boil water 'into January' warning  |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 September 2009 | date=30 November 2005}}</ref>

==Non-human examples==
The most important [[zoonotic]] reservoirs are [[cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s. Additionally, in recent years, cryptosporidiosis has plagued many commercial [[leopard gecko]] breeders.  Several species of the Cryptosporidium family (C. serpentes and others) are involved, and outside of geckos it has been found in monitor lizards, iguanas and tortoises, as well as several snake species.

==Exposure risks==
Cryptosporidiosis is found worldwide.  It causes 50.8% of water-borne diseases that are attributed to parasites.<ref name=gideon/>  In developing countries, 8-19% of diarrheal diseases can be attributed to ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref name=gatei>{{cite journal |author=Gatei W, Wamae CN, Mbae C, ''et al.'' |title=Cryptosporidiosis: prevalence, genotype analysis, and symptoms associated with infections in children in Kenya |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=78–82 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16837712 |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16837712}}</ref> Ten percent of the population in developing countries excretes oocysts.  In developed countries, the number is lower at 1–3%.  The age group most affected is children from 1 to 9 years old.<ref name=chen/>

The following groups have an elevated risk of being exposed to ''Cryptosporidium'':{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* People who swim regularly in pools with insufficient sanitation (certain strains of ''Cryptosporidium'' are chlorine-resistant)
* Child care workers
* Parents of infected children
* People who take care of other people with cryptosporidiosis
* International travelers
* Backpackers, hikers, and campers who drink unfiltered, untreated water
* People, including swimmers, who swallow water from contaminated sources
* People who handle infected cattle
* People exposed to human feces through sexual contact

Cases of cryptosporidiosis can occur in a city that does not have a contaminated water supply. In a city with clean water, it may be that cases of cryptosporidiosis have different origins. Testing of water, as well as [[epidemiological]] study, are necessary to determine the sources of specific infections. Note that ''Cryptosporidium'' typically does not cause serious illness in healthy people. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults who are exposed and [[immunocompromised]]. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Some sexual behaviours can transmit the parasite directly.

==Public health and prevention strategies==
In the US the law requires doctors and labs to report cases of cryptosporidiosis to local or state health departments.  These departments then report to the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]].<ref name=cdc/>  The best way to prevent getting and spreading cryptosporidiosis is to have good hygiene and sanitation.<ref name=murray/>  An example would be hand-washing.<ref name=cdc/>  Prevention is through washing hands carefully after going to the bathroom or contacting [[feces|stool]], and before eating.  People should avoid contact with animal feces.<ref name="brooks"/>  They should also avoid possibly contaminated food and water.<ref name=cdc/>  Additionally, people should refrain from engaging in sexual activities that can expose them to feces.<ref name=murray/>  

Standard water filtration may not be enough to eliminate ''Cryptosporidium''; boiling for at least 1 minute (3 minutes above {{convert|6500|ft|m}} of altitude) will decontaminate it.  Heating milk at 71.7 °C (161 °F) for 15 seconds pasteurizes it and can destroy the oocysts' ability to infect.<ref name=text>John, David T. and William A. Petri, Jr. Markell and Voge’s Medical Parasitology. 9th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier Inc., 2006: 68-71.</ref>  Water can also be made safe by filtering with a filter with pore size not greater than 1 micrometre, or by filters that have been approved for “cyst removal” by NSF International [[National Sanitation Foundation]].<ref name=cdc/>  Bottled drinking water is less likely to contain ''Cryptosporidium'', especially if the water is from an underground source.<ref name=text/>

People who have cryptosporidiosis should not swim in communal areas because the pathogen can reside in the anal and genital areas and be washed off.  They should wait until at least two weeks after diarrhea stops before entering public water sources, since oocysts can still be shed for a while.  Also, they should stay away from immunosuppressed people.<ref name=cdc/>  Immunocompromised people should take care to protect themselves from water in lakes and streams.<ref name=chen/>  They should also stay away from animal stools and wash their hands after touching animals.  To be safe, they should boil or filter their water.  They should also wash and cook their vegetables.<ref name=cdc/>

The US CDC notes the recommendation of many public health departments to soak contaminated surfaces for 20 minutes with a 3% hydrogen peroxide (99% kill rate) and then rinse them thoroughly, with the caveat that no disinfectant is guaranteed to be completely effective against Cryptosporidium. However, hydrogen peroxide is more effective than standard bleach solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/daycare/outbreak.html|title=Control measures for Outbreaks — Intensified Cryptosporidiosis (Crypto) Control Measures for the Child Care Setting|publisher = US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>

* In the summer of 2005, after numerous reports by patrons of gastrointestinal upset, a water park at [[Seneca Lake State Park]], in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[upstate New York]], USA was found to have two water storage tanks infected with ''Cryptosporidium''. By early September 2005, over 3,800 people reported symptoms of a ''Cryptosporidium'' infection.<ref>{{cite web | title=State Health Department Issues Update on Seneca Lake State Park Gastrointestinal Outbreak | work=New York State Health Dept | url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/press/releases/2005/2005-09-01_school_precautions_seneca_lake_release.htm | accessdate=29 September 2006}}</ref> The "Sprayground" was ordered closed for the season on 15 August.
* In October 2005, the [[Gwynedd]] and [[Anglesey]] areas of [[North Wales]], United Kingdom, suffered an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. The outbreak may have been linked to the drinking water supply from [[Llyn Cwellyn]], but this is not yet confirmed. As a result, 231 people fell ill and the company Welsh Water (Dwr Cymru) advised 61,000 people to boil their water before use.
* In March 2007, a suspected outbreak occurred in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]], after the source of water for much of the county, [[Lough Corrib]], was suspected to be contaminated with the parasite. A large population (90,000 people), including areas of both Galway City and County, were advised to boil water for drinking, food preparation and for brushing teeth. On 21 March 2007, it was confirmed that the city and county's water supply was contaminated with the parasite. The area's water supply was finally given approval on 20 August 2007, five months after ''Cryptosporidium'' was first detected. Around 240 people are known to have contracted the disease; experts say the true figure could be up to 5,000.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0820/galway.html RTÉ News — ''Galway water now safer than ever — HSE'']</ref>
* Hundreds of public pools in 20 Utah, USA counties were closed to young children in 2007, as children under 5 are most likely to spread the disease, especially children wearing [[diaper]]s. As of 10 September 2007 the [[Utah Department of Health]] had reported [http://health.utah.gov/uthealthnews/2007/20070911-Restrictions.htm 1302 cases] of cryptosporidiosis in the year; a more usual number would be 30.

* As of April 2011, there has been an ongoing outbreak in [[Skellefteå]], Sweden. Although many people have been diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis, the source of the parasite has not yet been found. Several tests have been taken around the water treatment unit "Abborren", but so far no results have turned up positive. Residents are being advised to boil the tap water as they continue to search for the contaminating source.
* Since May 2011, there has been an ongoing outbreak in South Roscommon in Ireland. Although many people have been diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis, the source of the parasite has not yet been found. Testing continues and Roscommon County Council are now considering introducing Ultra Violet Filtration to their water treatment process in the next 12 months. Residents are being advised to boil the tap water and there is no sign of this boil notice being lifted in the near future.
