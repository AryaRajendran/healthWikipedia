[[Leprosy]] currently affects approximately a quarter of a million people throughout the world, with 70% of these cases occurring in [[India]].<ref>World Health Organization (2009): Leprosy. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/index.html</ref> Cases of [[leprosy]] in India have decreased dramatically from 5,000,000 cases in 1985 to 213,000 cases in 2009. This significant decrease is largely due to the effectiveness of multi-drug therapy (MDT) that was developed in 1981. The prevalence of leprosy in India is now less than 1 case in 10,000 individuals, meeting the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) criteria for leprosy elimination. Yet the WHO criterion for elimination is not met in all areas of the country; rural areas and urban slums continue to experience up to five times the number of leprosy cases as the national average.<ref>Jacob, J. and Carlos Franco-Paredes (2008): The Stigmatization of Leprosy in India and Its Impact on Future Approaches to Elimination and Control. PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 2(1):1-3</ref>

==Transmission, treatment and disability==
Leprosy is one of the least infectious diseases mainly because nearly all of the population have natural immunity against it.<ref>World Health Organization (2009): Leprosy. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/index.html</ref> Nevertheless, [[Leprosy stigma|stigma against the disease]] due to its disfiguring effects causes its victims to be isolated and shunned. Leprosy is also the leading cause of permanent disability in the world and is primarily a disease of [[Poverty|the poor]].

The disease is now readily treatable with multi-drug therapy, which combines three drugs to kill the pathogen and cure the patient.<ref>World Health Organization (2009): Leprosy. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/index.html</ref>  If MDT is used in the early stages of infection, disability and disfigurement can be avoided. Unfortunately, even with these facts, individuals with leprosy are still shunned, isolated, and stigmatized so that the fear of leprosy is worse than the disease itself.<ref>Bhattacharya, S. and Virendra N. Sehgal (1999): Leprosy in India. Clinics in Dermatology 17: 159-170</ref>

== History ==
India is considered the point of origin of leprosy with skeletal evidence of the disease dating to 2000 B.C.<ref>Robbins, G. et al. (2009): Ancient Skeletal Evidence for Leprosy in India (2000 B.C.). PLoS ONE 4(5):e5669</ref> the disease is thought to have spread through trade and war to other parts of Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and later Europe and the Americas. In ancient Indian society, individuals suffering from leprosy were alienated because the disease was chronic, contagious, resulted in disfigurement, had no cure at the time, and was associated with sin.<ref>Jacob, J. and Carlos Franco-Paredes (2008): The Stigmatization and Control. PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 2(1):1-3</ref> In colonial India, the government enacted the Leprosy Act of 1898, which institutionalized leprosy victims and separated them based on gender to prevent reproduction. These laws mainly affected the poor because those who were self-sufficient were not obligated to be isolated or seek medical treatment. In the 20th century, even when drugs to treat leprosy became available and more knowledge was gained about the disease, the scourge of leprosy remains a persistent and widespread health problem throughout all regions of the country.

==Legal discrimination==
The historical legacy and societal stigma toward leprosy are evidenced by various laws containing discriminatory clauses against leprosy victims. Laws in the states of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], and [[Orissa]] prohibit leprosy patients from running in local elections.<ref>Putul, A. (2008): Laws in India Criminalise Leprosy.OneWorld South Asia. http://southasia.oneworld.net/Article/laws-in-india-criminalise-leprosy</ref> These laws have been supported by the national government, as evidenced when India's Supreme Court upheld a ruling by the state of Orissa prohibiting leprosy patients from participating in local elections.

Other laws include the Motor Vehicle Act of 1939 which restricts leprosy patients from obtaining a driving license and the Indian Rail Act of 1990 which prohibits leprosy patients from traveling by train.<ref>Putul, A. (2008): Laws in India Criminalise Leprosy.OneWorld South Asia. http://southasia.oneworld.net/Article/laws-in-india-criminalise-leprosy</ref> 

Many of these laws were written before the development of multi-drug therapy (MDT) and they have not been updated since. For example, almost all of the marriage and divorce laws of India consider leprosy as grounds for divorce with the Special Marriage Act of 1954 declaring leprosy "incurable." These laws do not reflect the current understanding of leprosy.
