'''Restrictive lung diseases''' (or '''restrictive ventilatory defects'''<ref>[http://oac.med.jhmi.edu/res_phys/Encyclopedia/RestrictVentDefect/RestrictVentDefect.HTML Johns Hopkins School of Medicine's Interactive Respiratory Physiology > Restrictive Ventilatory Defect] Retrieved on February 25, 2010</ref>) are a category of extrapulmonary, pleural, or parenchymal [[respiratory diseases]] that restrict lung expansion,<ref name="emedicineRLD">{{cite web |url= http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2012.htm|title= Restrictive Lung Disease|accessdate=2008-04-19 |author= Sharma, Sat|date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref> resulting in a decreased lung volume, an increased work of breathing, and inadequate ventilation and/or oxygenation. Pulmonary function test demonstrates a decrease in the forced vital capacity.

==Pathophysiology==
In disorders that are intrinsic to the lung parenchyma, the underlying process is usually [[pulmonary fibrosis]] (scarring of the lung).<ref name=osborne>[http://www.sallyosborne.com/Workshop%20on%20PFTs-PreReading%20-%202009.pdf PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS A Workshop on Simple Spirometry & Flow Volume Loops.] Dr. S. Osborne, Dept. Cellular & Physiological Sciences. Mars 2009</ref> As the disease progresses, the normal lung tissue is gradually replaced by scar tissue interspersed with pockets of air. This can lead to parts of the lung having a honeycomb-like appearance.

==Presentation==
The main symptoms are [[shortness of breath]] and [[cough]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Diagnosis==

In restrictive lung disease, both forced expiratory volume in one second ([[FEV1]]) and [[forced vital capacity]] (FVC) are reduced, however, the decline in FVC is more than that of FEV1, resulting in a higher than 80% [[FEV1/FVC ratio]].
In obstructive lung disease however, FEV1 is reduced while FVC remains stable, consequentially depicting a lower FEV1/FVC ratio.

One definition requires a [[total lung capacity]] which is 80% or less of the expected value.<ref name="pmid11991875">{{cite journal |author=Brack T, Jubran A, Tobin MJ |title=Dyspnea and decreased variability of breathing in patients with restrictive lung disease |journal=Am.

==Causes and classification==

Restrictive lung diseases may be due to specific causes which can be intrinsic to the [[parenchyma]] of the lung, or extrinsic to it.<ref name="urleMedicine - Restrictive Lung Disease : Article by Sat Sharma">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2012.htm |title=eMedicine - Restrictive Lung Disease : Article by Sat Sharma |work= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

===Intrinsic===
* [[Asbestosis]] caused by long-term exposure to asbestos dust.
* [[Radiation fibrosis]], usually from the radiation given for cancer treatment.
* Certain drugs such as [[amiodarone]], [[bleomycin]] and [[methotrexate]].
* As a consequence of another disease such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]].
* [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]] due to an allergic reaction to inhaled particles.
* [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), a severe lung condition occurring in response to a critical illness or injury.
* [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome]] due to a deficiency of [[surfactant]] in the lungs of a baby born prematurely.

Many cases of restrictive lung disease are [[idiopathic]] (have no known cause). Still, there is generally [[pulmonary fibrosis]].<ref name=osborne/> Examples are:
* [[Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]]
* [[Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia]], of which there are several types
* [[Sarcoidosis]]
* [[Eosinophilic pneumonia]]
* [[Lymphangioleiomyomatosis]]
* Pulmonary [[Langerhans' cell histiocytosis]]
* [[Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis]]

Conditions specifically affecting the interstitium are called [[interstitial lung disease]]s.

===Extrinsic===
* Neuromuscular diseases, including [[Myasthenia gravis]], and [[Guillain barre]]<ref name="pmid2780083">{{cite journal |author=Walker J, Cooney M, Norton S |title=Improved pulmonary function in chronic quadriplegics after pulmonary therapy and arm ergometry |journal=Paraplegia |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=278–83 |year=1989 |month=August |pmid=2780083 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
* Nonmuscular diseases of the upper thorax such as [[kyphosis]] and [[pectus carinatum|chest wall deformities]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301760-overview eMedicine Specialties  > Pulmonology > Interstitial Lung Diseases > Restrictive Lung Disease] Author: Lalit K Kanaparthi, MD, Klaus-Dieter Lessnau, MD, Sat Sharma, MD. Updated: Jul 27, 2009</ref>
* Diseases restricting lower thoracic/abdominal volume (e.g. [[obesity]], [[diaphragmatic hernia]], or the presence of [[ascites]]).<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301760-overview eMedicine Specialties  > Pulmonology > Interstitial Lung Diseases > Restrictive Lung Disease] Author: Lalit K Kanaparthi, MD, Klaus-Dieter Lessnau, MD, Sat Sharma, MD.
