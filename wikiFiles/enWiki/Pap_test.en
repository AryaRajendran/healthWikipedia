{{Main|Cervical screening}}
The '''Papanicolaou test''' (also called '''Pap smear''', '''Pap test''', '''cervical smear''', or '''smear test''') is a [[Screening (medicine)|screening test]] used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the [[Canal of the cervix|endocervical canal]] (transformation zone) of the female reproductive system. Unusual findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to [[cervical cancer]]. The test was invented by and named after the prominent [[Greeks|Greek]] doctor [[Georgios Papanikolaou]].

In taking a Pap smear, a [[speculum (medical)|speculum]] is used to open the vaginal canal and allow the collection of [[cell (biology)|cells]] from the outer opening of the [[cervix]] of the [[uterus]] and the endocervix.  The cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities.  The test aims to detect potentially pre-cancerous changes (called [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] (CIN) or cervical dysplasia), which are usually caused by sexually transmitted [[human papillomaviruses]]. The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of pre-cancer and cervical cancer.  The test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix and [[endometrium]].

In general, in countries where Pap smear screening is routine, it is recommended that females who have had sex seek regular Pap smear testing. Guidelines on frequency vary from every three to five years.<ref name=Saslow2012/><ref name="USPSTF">{{cite web| author = U.S. Preventive Services Task Force | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/3rduspstf/cervcan/cervcanrr.htm | title = Screening for Cervical Cancer: Recommendations and Rationale.

==Types of screening==

* Conventional Pap—In a conventional Pap smear, samples are smeared directly onto a microscope slide after collection.
* Liquid based cytology—The Pap smear sample is put in a bottle of preservative for transport to the laboratory, where it is then smeared on the slide.

In addition, an HPV test may be performed either as indicated for abnormal Pap results, or in some cases dual testing is done, where both a Pap smear and HPV test are done.

For information on other cervical screening tests and Human Papillomavirus testing, see [[cervical screening]].

Screening guidelines vary from country to country.  In general, screening starts about the age of 20 or 25 and continues until about the age of 50 or 60.<ref name="stopscreening">{{cite journal| title=At what age should cervical screening stop?| author=Strander B| journal=Brit Med J| year=2009| volume=338| pages=1022–23| doi=10.1136/bmj.b809}}</ref>  Screening is typically recommended every three to five years, as long as results are normal.<ref name="USPSTF"/><ref name=Arbyn10 />

Women should wait a few years after they first have intercourse before they start screening, and should not be screened before age 21. [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) and others recommend starting screening at age 21 (since that is a few years after initial sex for most American women).<ref name=Saslow2012>{{cite journal| url=http://journals.lww.com/jlgtd/PublishingImages/ASCCP%20Guidelines.pdf | title = American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology Screening Guidelines for the Prevention and Early Detection of Cervical Cancer | author = Saslow, D, et al. | journal = Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease | volume = 16 | number = 3 | year = 2012}}</ref><ref name=ACOG2009>{{cite journal|author1 = ACOG Committee on Gynecological Practice|title = ACOG Committee on Gynecologic Practice; Routine Pelvic Examination and Cervical Cytology Screening, Opinion #413 | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology| volume = 113 | issue = 5 | pages = 1190–1193 | year = 2009|pmid = 19384150|doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181a6d022}}</ref>  Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to start screening.  For instance, some parts of Great Britain start screening at age 25.

Most women who contract HPV do so soon after becoming sexually active.<ref name="ACS"/>{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}} It takes an average of a year, but can take up to four years, for a woman's immune system to control the initial infection.  Screening during this period may show this immune reaction and repair as mild abnormalities, which are usually not associated with cervical cancer, but could cause the woman stress and result in further tests and possible treatment.  Cervical cancer usually takes time to develop, so delaying the start of screening a few years poses little risk of missing a potentially precancerous lesion.  For instance, screening women under age 25 does not decrease cancer rates under age 30.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Sasieni, P; Castanon, A; Cuzick, J; Snow, J; | title = Effectiveness of Cervical Screening with Age: Population based Case-Control Study of Prospectively Recorded Data | journal = BMJ | volume = 339| pages = 2968–2974 | year = 2009 | doi=10.1136/bmj.b2968}}</ref>

There is little or no benefit to screening women who have not had sexual contact.  For example, [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommends waiting at least three years after first sex.<ref name="USPSTF"/>  HPV can be transmitted in sex between women, so women who have only had sex with other women should be screened, although they are at somewhat lower risk for cervical cancer.<ref name=Marrazzo2001>{{cite journal| author=Marrazzo, JM; et al. | title=Papanicolaou test screening and prevalence of genital human papillomavirus among women who have sex with women| journal=American Journal of Public Health| volume=91| pages=947–952| year = 2001| doi=10.2105/AJPH.91.6.947| pmid=11392939| issue=6| pmc=1446473}}</ref>

Guidelines on frequency of screening vary—typically every three to five years for those who have not had previous abnormal smears.<ref name="USPSTF"/><ref name=Arbyn10 />  Some older recommendations suggested screening as frequently as every one to two years, however there is little evidence to support such frequent screening; annual screening has little benefit but leads to greatly increased cost and many unnecessary procedures and treatments.<ref name=Saslow2012 />  It has been acknowledged since before 1980 that most women can be screened less often.<ref>{{cite journal| quote = ACS and others have recommended, since before 1980, that conventional cytology can be safely performed up to every three years for most women. | author = Smith, RA; et al.| title = American Cancer Society Guideline for the Early Detection of Cervical Neoplasia and Cancer | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–22 | year = 2002 }}</ref>  In some guidelines, frequency depends on age; for instance in Great Britain, screening is recommended every 3 years for women under 50, and every 5 years for those over.

Screening should stop about age 65 unless there is a recent abnormal tests or disease.  There is probably no benefit screening women aged 60 or over whose previous tests have been negative.<ref name="agebenefit">{{cite journal|author=Saiseni P, Adams J, Cuzick J|title=Benefit of cervical screening at different ages: evidence from the UK audit of screening histories|journal=Br J Cancer| year=2003| volume=89| pages=88–93| doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6600974| pmid=12838306| issue=1| pmc=2394236}}</ref>  If a woman's last three Pap results were normal, she can stop at age 65, according to the USPSTF, ACOG, ACS and ASCP;<ref name=Saslow2012 /><ref name="USPSTF"/> England's NHS says 64.
There is no need to continue screening after a complete hysterectomy for benign disease.

Pap smear screening is still recommended for those who have been [[HPV vaccine|vaccinated against HPV]],<ref name=Arbyn10 /> since the vaccines do not cover all of the HPV types that can cause cervical cancer.  Also, the vaccine does not protect against HPV exposure before vaccination.

More frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow-up after an abnormal Pap smear, or after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment for cancer.

==Procedure==
[[Image:Gray1167.svg|thumb|Cervix in relation to upper part of vagina and posterior portion of uterus.]]

For best results, a Pap test should not occur when a woman is menstruating.  However, Pap smears can be performed during a woman's menstrual period, especially if the physician is using a liquid-based test; if bleeding is extremely heavy, endometrial cells can obscure cervical cells, and it is therefore inadvisable to have a Pap smear if bleeding is excessive.

Obtaining a pap smear should not cause pain,<ref>http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/publications/cbclex5b.asp</ref> but it can if the patient has certain untreated vaginal problems such as [[stenosis of uterine cervix|cervical stenosis]] or [[vaginismus]], or if the person performing it is too harsh, or uses the wrong size speculum. The patient should speak up if they are in pain. Many women experience spotting or mild diarrhea afterward.

Many health care providers are under the false impression that only sterile water, or no lubricant at all, should be used to lubricate the speculum. This may result in unnecessary discomfort. A number of studies have shown that using a small amount of water-based gel lubricant does not interfere with, obscure, or distort the PAP smear. Further, cytology is not affected nor some STD testing.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Effect of Using Water-based Gel Lubricant During a Speculum Exam On Pap Smear Results|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/pa/190/|work=School of Physician Assistant Studies|publisher=Pacific University|accessdate=4 February 2012|author=Wright, Jessica L.|year=2010}}</ref> 

The health care worker begins by inserting a [[speculum (medical)|speculum]] into the woman's vagina, which spreads the vagina open and allows access to the [[cervix]]. The health care provider then collects a sample of cells from the outer opening or '''os''' of the cervix by scraping it with an Aylesbury spatula. An endocervical brush is rotated in the central opening of the cervix.  The cells are placed on a glass slide and taken to the [[laboratory]] to be checked for abnormalities.

A  plastic-fronded broom is sometimes used in place of the spatula and brush. The broom is not as good a collection device, since it is much less effective at collecting endocervical material than the spatula and brush.<ref>
{{cite journal |author=Martin-Hirsch P, Lilford R, Jarvis G, Kitchener HC.

|year=1999
|pmid=10577637
|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)02353-3}}</ref> The broom is used more frequently with the advent of [[liquid-based cytology]], although either type of collection device may be used with either type of cytology.

The sample is stained using the [[Papanicolaou stain|Papanicolaou technique]], in which [[tinctorial]] dyes and acids are selectively retained by cells. Unstained cells cannot be seen with a light microscope. Papanicolaou chose stains that highlighted cytoplasmic keratinization, which actually has almost nothing to do with the nuclear features used to make diagnoses now.

In some cases, a computer system may prescreen the slides, indicating those that do not need examination by a person or highlighting areas for special attention.  The sample is then usually screened by a specially trained and qualified cytotechnologist using a light [[microscope]]. The terminology for who screens the sample varies according to the country; in the [[UK]], the personnel are known as [[cytoscreener]]s, [[biomedical scientist]]s (BMS), [[advanced practitioner]]s and [[pathologist]]s. The latter two take responsibility for reporting the abnormal sample which may require further investigation.

===Automated analysis===
In the last decade, there have been successful attempts to develop automated, computer image analysis systems for screening.<ref name="pmid15842055">{{cite journal |author=Biscotti CV, Dawson AE, Dziura B, ''et al.'' |title=Assisted primary screening using the automated ThinPrep Imaging System |journal=Am.

==Results==

In screening a general or low-risk population, most Pap results are normal.

In the United States, about 2–3 million abnormal Pap smear results are found each year.<ref>{{cite web
  | title = Pap Smear
  | url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/pap_smear/article_em.htm
  | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}</ref> Most abnormal results are mildly abnormal (ASC-US (typically 2–5% of Pap results) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ([[Bethesda System#LSIL|LSIL]])  (about 2% of results)), indicating HPV infection.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Although most low-grade cervical dysplasias spontaneously regress without ever leading to [[cervical cancer]], dysplasia can serve as an indication that increased vigilance is needed.

In a typical scenario, about 0.5% of Pap results are high-grade SIL ([[Bethesda System#HSIL|HSIL]]), and less than 0.5% of results indicate cancer; 0.2 to 0.8% of results indicate Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Significance (AGC-NOS).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

As liquid based preparations (LBPs) become a common medium for testing, atypical result rates have increased. The median rate for all preparations with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions using LBPs was 2.9% compared with a 2003 median rate of 2.1%. Rates for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (median, 0.5%) and atypical squamous cells have changed little.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20196659|year=2010|last1=Eversole|first1=GM|last2=Moriarty|first2=AT|last3=Schwartz|first3=MR|last4=Clayton|first4=AC|last5=Souers|first5=R|last6=Fatheree|first6=LA|last7=Chmara|first7=BA|last8=Tench|first8=WD|last9=Henry|first9=MR|title=Practices of participants in the college of american pathologists interlaboratory comparison program in cervicovaginal cytology, 2006|volume=134|issue=3|pages=331–5|doi=10.1043/1543-2165-134.3.331|journal=Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine}}</ref>

Abnormal results are reported according to the [[Bethesda system]].<ref>Nayar R, Solomon D. Second edition of 'The Bethesda System for reporting cervical cytology'&nbsp;– Atlas, website, and Bethesda interobserver reproducibility project. CytoJournal [serial online] 2004 [cited 2011 Apr 16];1:4. Available from: http://www.cytojournal.com/text.asp?2004/1/1/4/41272</ref> They include:

*Squamous cell abnormalities (SIL)
**Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)
**Atypical squamous cells&nbsp;– cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)
**Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL)
**High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL)
**[[Squamous cell carcinoma]]

*Glandular epithelial cell abnormalities
**Atypical Glandular Cells not otherwise specified (AGC or AGC-NOS)

Endocervical and endometrial abnormalities can also be detected, as can a number of infectious processes, including [[Candida albicans|yeast]], [[herpes simplex virus]] and [[trichomoniasis]].  However it is not very sensitive at detecting these infections, so absence of detection on a Pap does not mean absence of the infection.

==Effectiveness==
The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%.<ref name=Arbyn10>{{cite journal| journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 21 | pages = 448–458 | year = 2010| title = European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Cancer Screening. Second Edition—Summary Document| pmid = 20176693 | author = M. Arbyn; et al.| pmc = 2826099 | issue = 3 | doi=10.1093/annonc/mdp471 }}</ref>

Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors.<ref name=DeMay>{{cite book| author = DeMay, M. | year = 2007 | title = Practical principles of cytopathology.  Revised edition. | isbn = 978-0-89189-549-7| publisher = American Society for Clinical Pathology Press| location = Chicago, IL}}</ref>  In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in women that have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in women that have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years.  About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in women that had an abnormal Pap smear, but did not get appropriate follow-up (woman did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).

[[Adenocarcinoma]] of the cervix has not been shown to be prevented by Pap tests.<ref name=DeMay />  In the UK, which has a Pap smear screening program, Adenocarcinoma accounts for about 15% of all cervical cancers<ref>{{cite web| title=Cancer Research UK website | url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/cervix/incidence/ | accessdate = 2009-01-03}}</ref>

Estimates of the effectiveness of the United Kingdom's call and recall system vary widely, but it may prevent about 700 deaths per year in the UK. A medical practitioner performing 200 tests each year would prevent a death once in 38 years, while seeing 152 women with abnormal results, referring 79 for investigation, obtaining 53 abnormal biopsy results, and seeing 17 persisting abnormalities lasting longer than two years. At least one woman during the 38 years would die from cervical cancer despite being screened.<ref name="pmid12714468">{{cite journal |author=Raffle AE, Alden B, Quinn M, Babb PJ, Brett MT |title=Outcomes of screening to prevent cancer: analysis of cumulative incidence of cervical abnormality and modelling of cases and deaths prevented |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7395 |page=901 |year=2003 |pmid=12714468 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7395.901 |pmc=153831}}</ref>

Since the population of the UK is about 61 million, the maximum number of women who could be receiving Pap smears in the UK is around 15 million to 20 million (eliminating the percentage of the population under 20 and over 65).   This would indicate that the use of Pap smear screening in the UK saves the life of 1 person for every approximately 20,000 people tested (assuming  15,000,000 are being tested yearly).  If only 10,000,000 are actually tested each year, then it would save the life of 1 person for every approximately 15,000 people tested.

==Practical aspects==
The endocervix may be partially sampled with the device used to obtain the ectocervical sample, but, due to the anatomy of this area, consistent and reliable sampling cannot be guaranteed. As abnormal endocervical cells may be sampled, those examining them are taught to recognize them.

The endometrium is not directly sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap Test should not be used as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.

==History==
[[Image:Georgios_Papanikolaou_stamp_(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Georgios Papanikolaou]]]]
The test was invented by and named after the prominent [[Greeks|Greek]] doctor [[Georgios Papanikolaou]]. [[Aurel Babeş]] of [[Romania]] independently made similar discoveries in 1927.<ref>M.J. O'Dowd, E.E. Philipp, ''The History of Obstetrics & Gynaecology'', London, Parthenon Publishing Group, 1994, p. 547.</ref> However, it should be noted that Babes method was radically different from Papanicolaou's.

Papanicolaou's name was repeatedly submitted to the Nobel Committee and rejected every time. The Nobel Committee delegated the in-depth investigation of Papanicolaou's merits and demerits to the late Professor Santesson, who was at that time the head of pathology at the Stockholm Cancer Institute (the Radiumhemmet). The investigator discovered Babeş' contributions that had never been cited by Papanicolaou and duly reported this fact to the Committee, which then rejected Papanicolaou's Nobel award.<ref>Koss, Leopold G. M.D., International Journal of Gynecology Pathology, http://journals.lww.com/intjgynpathology/Fulltext/2003/01000/Aurel_Babes.20.aspx#P20</ref>

==Experimental techniques==

In the developed world result of cervical biopsy guided by colposcopy is the "[[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]]" for diagnosing cervical abnormalities after an abnormal pap smear. The procedure requires a trained colposcopist and can be expensive to perform. However, Pap smears are very sensitive and some negative biopsy results may represent undersampling of the lesion in the biopsy, so negative biopsy with positive cytology requires careful follow up.<ref>Bewtra C, Pathan M, Hashish H. Abnormal Pap smears with negative follow-up biopsies: Improving cytohistologic correlations. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dc.10329/abstract</ref> 

Experimental visualization techniques use broad-band light (e.g., direct visualization, [[speculoscopy]], [[cervicography]], visual inspection with acetic acid or with Lugol's, and colposcopy<!-- confusing? -->) and electronic detection methods (e.g., [[Polarprobe]] and in-vivo [[Spectroscopy]]). These techniques are less expensive and can be performed with significantly less training. They do not perform as well as Pap smear screening and colposcopy. At this point, these techniques have not been validated by large-scale trials and are not in general use.
