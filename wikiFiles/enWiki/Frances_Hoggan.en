'''Frances Elizabeth Hoggan''' MD (née '''Morgan''') (20 December 1843 – 5 February 1927) was the first British woman to receive a doctorate in [[medicine]] from a university in Europe, and the first female doctor to be registered in [[Wales]].

Frances Hoggan was born in [[Brecon]], where her father was a curate.  She was brought up and educated at [[Cowbridge]] and later at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].  During her teens, she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, who was brought up with her mother and passed off as Frances' sister.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/women/pages/mothers_of_industry.shtml BBC - Wales History - Mothers of Industry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  She went on to study at [[Paris]] and [[Düsseldorf]].  She obtained her medical qualification from the [[University of Zurich]] in 1870, completing the six-year course in three years.  In 1874 she married Dr George Hoggan.  She later practised in London as a specialist in women's and children's diseases.  Together with her husband, she opened the first husband-and-wife general medical practice in the UK.  She became a campaigner and social reformer, and toured the [[United States]] lecturing.  She had a particular interest in racial issues, and was a speaker at the Universal Race Congress in London in 1911.
