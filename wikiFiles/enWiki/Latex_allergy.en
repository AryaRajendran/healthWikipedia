'''Latex allergy''' is a medical term encompassing a range of [[allergic]] reactions to natural [[rubber]] [[latex]] and synthetic rubber.

== Types ==
(Synthetic) rubber is known to cause 2 of the 4 (or 5) types of [[hypersensitivity]].

===Type I===
The most serious and rare form, type I is an immediate and potentially life-threatening reaction, not unlike the severe reaction some people have to [[bee sting]]s. Such reactions account for a significant proportion of [[perioperative]] [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic]] reaction, especially in children with [[myelomeningocele]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rendeli C, Nucera E, Ausili E, Tabacco F, Roncallo C, Pollastrini E, Scorzoni M, Schiavino D, Caldarelli M, Pietrini D, Patriarca G. |title=Latex sensitisation and allergy in children with myelomeningocele. |journal=Childs Nerv Syst |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=28–32 |year=2006 |month=Jan |pmid=15703967 |doi=10.1007/s00381-004-1110-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Banta JV, Bonanni C, Prebluda J. |title=Latex anaphylaxis during spinal surgery in children with myelomeningocele |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |volume=235 |issue=6 |pages=543–8 |year=1993 |month=Jun |pmid=8504897}}</ref>

Testing for type I natural rubber latex allergy is through [[blood testing]], such as [[RAST test|RAST (radioallergosorbent test)]] identifies what types of IgE proteins trigger allergic reactions.  While the standard for allergen testing is the skin prick test, there is no approved skin testing reagent for latex in the United States,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} though some{{specify|date=February 2011}} other countries do have approved skin testing reagents.  Type I natural rubber latex allergy is caused from IgE (immune) mediated reactions to proteins found in the ''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]'' tree, a type of rubber tree.

Some people who are allergic to latex are also allergic to clothes, shoes, and other things that contain natural rubber latex—for example [[elastic bands]], [[rubber gloves]], [[condoms]], [[pacifiers]] and baby-bottle nipples, [[balloons]], cars, and clothing containing natural rubber based elastic.  A Type I reaction can be triggered by exposure to airborne particles resulting from the inflation of balloons even if the person is not present while the balloons are being inflated.

===Type IV (allergic contact dermatitis)===
Also known as allergic [[contact dermatitis]].  This involves a delayed skin [[rash]] that is similar to [[poison ivy]] with blistering and oozing of the skin (''see [[urushiol-induced contact dermatitis]]'').  

Type IV reactions are caused by the chemicals used to process the (synthetic) rubber.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Patch testing needs to be done to verify which type of chemical triggers the reaction. Once the chemical is identified, then the person can choose products that are not processed with that chemical. Type IV allergies caused by synthetic rubber products are an increasing problem for healthcare workers.

===Irritant contact dermatitis===
It can also cause irritant [[contact dermatitis]]:<ref name="urlLatex Allergy">{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/980101ap/reddy.html |title=Latex Allergy |work= |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref> The most common type of reaction.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This causes dry, itchy, irritated areas on the skin, most often on the hands.  It can be caused by the irritation of using gloves, or it can also be caused by exposure to other workplace products. Frequent washing of the hands, incomplete drying, exposure to hand sanitizers, and the [[talc]]-like powder coatings ([[zinc oxide]], etc.) used with gloves can aggravate symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Irritant contact dermatitis is not a true allergy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

== Those at greatest risk ==
* Children with [[Spina bifida]].  About 68% will have a reaction.<ref name="sd08">{{cite web| url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/1206-protect_yourself_from_latex_allergies.htm | title= Plant Biologists And Immunochemists Develop Hypoallergenic Alternative To Latex | publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] | date=December 1, 2008 | accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref>
* Industrial [[rubber]] workers, exposed for long periods to high amounts of latex.  About 10% have an allergic reaction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
* [[Health care provider]]s.  Given the ubiquitous use of latex products in health care settings, management of latex allergy presents significant health organizational problems. Healthcare workers who frequently use latex gloves and other latex-containing medical supplies such as physicians, nurses, aides, dentists, dental hygienists, operating room employees, laboratory technicians, and hospital housekeeping personnel are at risk for developing latex allergy.<ref>{{cite web

* People who have had multiple [[surgical procedures]], especially in childhood.<ref name="urlLatex Allergy"/>

Estimates of latex sensitivity in the general population range from 0.8% to 8.2%,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grzybowski M, Ownby DR, Rivers EP, Ander D, Nowak RM |title=The prevalence of latex-specific IgE in patients presenting to an urban emergency department |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=411–9 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12239498 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(02)00063-X}}</ref> although not all will ever develop a noticeable allergic reaction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Synthetic latex compounds can be chemically identical to latex, producing the same allergic reactions{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}. They also contain many of the same or similar accelerators. These synthetics do not have to be labeled as such.

== Latex and foods ==
Some people who have latex allergy may also have an allergic response to any of a number of plant products, usually fruits. This is known as the ''latex-fruit syndrome''.<ref name="pmid9188921">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  Fruits (and seeds) involved in this syndrome include [[banana]], [[pineapple]], [[avocado]], [[chestnut]], [[kiwi fruit]], [[mango]], [[passionfruit]], [[fig]], [[strawberry]] and [[soy]].  Some but not all of these fruits contain a form of latex.

==Alternatives==
*Synthetic elastic such as [[elastane]] or [[neoprene]] do not contain the proteins from the ''Hevea brasiliensis'' tree that trigger type I reactions.

*Products made from [[guayule]] natural rubber emulsions also do not contain the proteins from the Hevea rubber tree,<ref name="sd08"/> and have only trace amounts of other proteins, indicating a very low potential for causing sensitization to this material.

*Chemical treatment to reduce the amount of [[antibody generator|antigenic proteins]] in Hevea latex has yielded alternative materials, such as [[Vytex Natural Rubber Latex|Vytex]], which reduce exposure to latex allergens while otherwise retaining the properties of natural rubber.

*Some patients' sensitivity is so extreme that replacement of Latex products with non-latex products may still result in a reaction if the products are manufactured in the same facility as the Latex-containing products.
