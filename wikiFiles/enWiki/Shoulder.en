The human '''shoulder''' is made up of three bones: the [[clavicle]] (collarbone), the [[scapula]] (shoulder blade), and the [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons.  The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder [[joint]]s. The major joint of the shoulder is the [[glenohumeral joint]], which "[[shoulder joint]]" generally refers to. In [[human anatomy]], the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the [[humerus]] attaches to the [[scapula]], the head sitting in the [[glenoid fossa]].<ref>{{EMedicineDictionary|Shoulder+joint}}{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> The '''shoulder''' is the group of structures in the region of the joint.<ref>{{EMedicineDictionary|Shoulder}}{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

There are two kinds of [[cartilage]] in the joint. The first type is the white cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) which allows the bones to glide and move on each other. When this type of cartilage starts to wear out (a process called [[arthritis]]), the joint becomes painful and stiff. The labrum is a second kind of cartilage in the shoulder which is distinctly different from the articular cartilage. This cartilage is more fibrous or rigid than the cartilage on the ends of the ball and socket. Also, this cartilage is also found only around the socket where it is attached.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkinsortho.org/labrum_tear.html |title=labrum tear Johns Hopkins Orthopaedic Surgery |publisher=www.hopkinsortho.org |accessdate=2010-05-16 }}</ref>

The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands, but also stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting, pushing and pulling.  The compromise between mobility and stability results in a large number of [[shoulder problems]] not faced by other joints such as the [[Hip (anatomy)|hip]].

==Human anatomy==
===Joints===
There are three [[joint]]s of the shoulder:  The [[glenohumeral]], [[acromioclavicular]], and the [[sternoclavicular]] joints.

====Glenohumeral joint====
The [[glenohumeral joint]] is the main joint of the shoulder and the generic term "shoulder joint" usually refers to it.  It is a [[ball and socket joint]] that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body.  It is formed by the articulation between the head of the humerus and the lateral scapula (specifically-the glenoid fossa of the scapula).  The "ball" of the joint is the rounded, medial anterior surface of the humerus and the "socket" is formed by the [[glenoid cavity|glenoid fossa]], the dish-shaped portion of the lateral scapula.  The shallowness of the fossa and relatively loose connections between the shoulder and the rest of the body allows the arm to have tremendous mobility, at the expense of being much easier to [[joint dislocation|dislocate]] than most other joints in the body. Approximately its 4 to 1 disproportion between the large head of the humerus and the shallow glenoid cavity.
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - Anatomical studies of the shoulder - WGA12824.jpg|thumb|200px|Anatomical studies of the shoulder by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] c.1510]]
The [[joint capsule|capsule]] is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the [[scapula]], [[humerus]], and head of the [[biceps]]. It is lined by a thin, smooth [[synovial membrane]].  This capsule is strengthened by the coracohumeral ligament which attaches the coracoid process of the scapula to the greater tubercle of the humerus.  There are also three other ligaments attaching the lesser tubercle of the humerus to lateral scapula and are collectively called the glenohumeral ligaments.

There is also a [[ligament]] called semicirculare humeri which is a transversal band between the posterior sides of the tuberculum minus and majus of the humerus. This band is one of the most important strengthening ligaments of the [[joint capsule]]. The shoulder is a vital joint and critical for movement.

====Sternoclavicular joint====
The [[sternoclavicular joint|sternoclavicular]] occurs at the medial end of the clavicle with the [[manubrium]] or top most portion of the sternum.  The clavicle is triangular and rounded and the manubrium is convex; the two bones articulate. The joint consists of a tight capsule and complete intra-articular disc which ensures stability of the joint. The costoclavicular ligament is the main limitation to movement, therefore, the main stabilizer of the joint. A fibrocartilaginous disc present at the joint increases the range of movement. Sternoclavicular dislocation is rare,<ref>{{cite web

===Movements===
The muscles and joints of the shoulder allow it to move through a remarkable [[range of motion]], making it one of the most mobile joints in the human body.  The shoulder can [[abduction (kinesiology)|abduct]], [[adduction|adduct]] (such as during the [[fly (exercise)|shoulder fly]]), rotate, be raised in front of and behind the [[torso]] and move through a full 360° in the [[sagittal plane]].  This tremendous range of motion also makes the shoulder extremely unstable, far more prone to [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocation]] and injury than other joints <ref>Scientific Keys Volume I, The Key Muscles of Hatha Yoga, Ray Long MD FRCSC, Third Edition, pg. 174</ref>

Arm abduction occurs when the arms are held at the sides, parallel to the length of the torso, and are then raised in the plane of the torso. This movement may be broken down into two parts: True abduction of the arm, which takes the humerus from parallel to the spine to perpendicular; and upward rotation of the scapula, which raises the humerus above the shoulders until it points straight upwards.

===Muscles===
====Major muscles====
The muscles that are responsible for movement in the shoulder attach to the scapula, humerus, and clavicle.  The muscles that surround the shoulder form the shoulder cap and [[underarm]].

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Name''' || '''Attachment''' || '''Function'''
|-
| [[serratus anterior]] || Originates on the surface of the upper eight [[ribs]] at the side of the chest and inserts along the entire anterior length of the [[medial border of the scapula]]. || It fixes the scapula into the thoracic wall and aids in rotation and abduction of the shoulders.
|-
| [[subclavius]] || Located inferior to the clavicle, originating on the [[first rib]] and inserting (penetrating) on the [[subclavian groove]] of the clavicle.  || It depresses the lateral clavicle and also acts to stabilize the clavicle.
|-
| [[pectoralis minor]]  || Arises from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, near their cartilage and inserts into the medial border and upper surface of the [[coracoid process]] of the scapula.   || This muscle aids in respiration, medially rotates the scapula, protracts the scapula, and also draws the scapula inferiorly.
|-
| [[sternocleidomastoid]]  || Attaches to the [[Human sternum|sternum]] (sterno-), the [[clavicle]] (cleido-), and the [[mastoid process]] of the [[temporal bone]] of the skull. || Most of its actions flex and rotate the head.  In regards to the shoulder, however, it also aids in respiration by elevating the sternoclavicular joint when the head is fixed.
|-
| [[levator scapulae]] || Arises from the transverse processes of the first four [[cervical vertebrae]] and inserts into the [[medial border of the scapula]]. || It is capable of rotating the scapula downward and elevating the scapula.
|-
| [[rhomboid major]] and [[rhomboid minor]] (work together) || They arise from the [[spinous processes]] of the [[thoracic vertebrae]] T1 to T5 as well as from the spinous processes of the seventh cervical. They insert on the medial border of the scapula, from about the level of the scapular spine to the [[scapula's inferior angle]].  || They are responsible for downward rotation of the scapula with the levator scapulae, as well as adduction of the scapula.
|-
| [[trapezius]]  || Arises from the [[occipital bone]], the [[ligamentum nuchae]], the spinous process of the seventh cervical, and the spinous processes of all the thoracic vertebrae, and from the corresponding portion of the [[supraspinal ligament]].  It inserts on the lateral clavicle, the [[acromion process]], and into the [[spine of the scapula]].  || Different portions of the fibers perform different actions on the scapula: depression, upward rotation, elevation, and adductions.
|-
| [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]], anterior fibers || Arises from the [[anterior]] border and upper surface of the lateral third of the [[clavicle]].||The anterior fibres are involved in shoulder abduction when the shoulder is externally rotated. The anterior deltoid is weak in strict transverse flexion but assists the [[pectoralis major]] during shoulder transverse flexion / shoulder flexion (elbow slightly inferior to shoulders).
|-
| [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]], middle fibers || Arises from the lateral margin and upper surface of the [[acromion]].|| The middle fibres are involved in shoulder abduction when the shoulder is internally rotated, are involved in shoulder flexion when the shoulder is internally rotated, and are involved in shoulder transverse abduction (shoulder externally rotated) -- but are not utilized significantly during strict transverse extension (shoulder internally rotated).
|-
| [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]], posterior fibers || Arises from the lower lip of the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] border of the [[spine of the scapula]], as far back as the triangular surface at its medial end.||The posterior fibres are strongly involved in transverse extension particularly since the [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] is very weak in strict transverse extension. The posterior deltoid is also the primary shoulder hyperextensor.
|}

====Rotator cuff====
{{Main|Rotator cuff}}

The [[rotator cuff]] is an anatomical term given to the group of muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder.  It is composed of the tendons and muscles ([[supraspinatus muscle|supraspinatus]], [[infraspinatus muscle|infraspinatus]], [[teres minor muscle|teres minor]] and [[subscapularis muscle|subscapularis]]) that hold the head of the humerus (ball) in the glenoid fossa (socket).

Two filmy sac-like structures called [[bursa (anatomy)|bursa]]e permit smooth gliding between bone, muscle, and tendon. They cushion and protect the rotator cuff from the bony arch of the acromion.

===Medical problems===
{{Main|Shoulder problems}}
''Shoulder problems'' including [[pain]], are one of the more common reasons for physician visits for musculoskeletal symptoms. The shoulder is the most movable joint in the body. However, it is an unstable joint because of the range of motion allowed. This instability increases the likelihood of joint injury, often leading to a degenerative process in which tissues break down and no longer function well.Because of weakness in the scapular problems which will then occur to give problems which then leads to surgery.

{{anchor|fracture}}<!--Shoulder fracture redirects here-->
Major injuries to the shoulder include [[rotator cuff tear]] and [[bone fracture]]s of one or more of the bones of the shoulder.

Shoulder fractures include:
*[[Clavicle fracture]]
*[[Scapular fracture]]
*Proximal [[humerus fracture]]

==Evolutionary variation==
[[Tetrapod]] forelimb are characterised by a high degree of mobility in the shoulder-thorax connection.  Lacking of a solid skeletal connection between the shoulder girdle and the vertebral column, the forelimb's attachment to the trunk is instead mainly controlled by [[serratus lateralis]] and [[levator scapulae]].  Depending on locomotor style, a bone connect the shoulder girdle to the trunk in some animals; the [[coracoid]] bone in reptiles and birds, and the [[clavicle]] in [[primate]]s and [[bat]]s; but [[cursorial]] mammals lack this bone. 
In primates, the shoulder shows characteristics the differs from other mammals, including a well developed clavicle, a dorsally shifted scapula with prominent acromion and spine, and a humerus featuring a straight shaft and a spherical head.
