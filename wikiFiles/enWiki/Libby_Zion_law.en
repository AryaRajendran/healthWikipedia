Her father, a lawyer, had formerly written for ''The New York Times''. Her mother was a former publishing executive. She had two brothers, Adam and Jed. Her obituary in ''The New York Times'', written the day after her death, stated that she had been ill with a "flu-like ailment" for the past several days. The article stated that after being admitted to [[New York Hospital]], she died of [[cardiac arrest]], the cause of which was not known.<ref>{{cite news|title=Libby Zion |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDD1539F935A35750C0A962948260 |newspaper=New York Times|date=March 6, 1984 |accessdate=2009-02-13}}</ref>

Libby Zion had been admitted to the hospital by emergency room physicians on the night of March 4. Raymond Sherman, the Zion family physician, agreed with their plan to hydrate and observe her. Zion was assigned to two residents, Luise Weinstein and Gregg Stone, who both evaluated her. Weinstein, a [[PGY]]-1 resident (sometimes referred to as intern), and Stone, a PGY-2 resident, were unable to determine the cause of Zion's illness, though Stone tentatively suggested that her condition might be a simple overreaction to a normal illness. After consulting with Dr. Sherman, the two prescribed meperidine ([[Demerol]]) to control the "strange jerking motions" that Zion had been exhibiting when she was admitted.<ref name=wapo06>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112400985.html|title=A Case That Shook Medicine: How One Man's Rage Over His Daughter's Death Sped Reform of Doctor Training|first =Barron H.|last = Lerner|authorlink=Barron H.

Weinstein and Stone were both responsible for covering dozens of other patients. After evaluating Zion, they left. Weinstein went to cover other patients, and Stone went to sleep in an [[on-call room]] in an adjacent building. Zion, however, did not improve, and continued to become more agitated. After being
contacted by nurses by phone, Weinstein ordered [[physical restraint]]s be placed on Zion. She also prescribed [[haloperidol]] by phone to control the agitation.<ref name=wapo06 />

Zion finally managed to fall asleep, but by 6:30, her temperature was {{convert|107|°F|°C}}. Weinstein was once again called, and measures were quickly taken to try to reduce her temperature. However, before this could be done, Zion suffered a [[cardiac arrest]] and could not be resuscitated. Weinstein informed Zion's parents by telephone.<ref name=wapo06 />

Several years had gone by before a general agreement was reached regarding the cause of Zion's death. Zion had been taking a prescribed antidepressant, [[phenelzine]], before she was admitted to the hospital. The combination of that and the meperidine given to her by Stone and Weinstein contributed to the development of "[[serotonin syndrome]]", a condition which led to increased agitation. This led Zion to pull on her intravenous tubes, causing Weinstein to order physical restraints, which Zion also fought against. By the time she finally fell asleep, her fever had already reached dangerous levels, and she died soon after of cardiac arrest.<ref name=brody>{{cite news |last=Brody|first=Jane Ellen|authorlink=Jane Ellen Brody|title=A Mix of Medicines That Can Be Lethal |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/health/27brody.html?|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>

==Publicity and trials==
Grieving the loss of their child, Zion's parents became convinced that their daughter's death was due to inadequate staffing at the [[teaching hospital]].<ref name=nyt05/><ref name=wapo06/> Sidney Zion questioned the staff's competence for two reasons. The first was the administration of meperidine, known to cause fatal interactions with [[phenelzine]], the antidepressant that Libby Zion was taking. The second issue was the use of restraints and emergency psychiatric medication. Sidney's aggrieved words were: "They gave her a drug that was destined to kill her, then ignored her except to tie her down like a dog." To the distress of the doctors, Zion began to refer to his daughter's death as a "murder." Sidney also questioned the long hours that residents worked at the time. In a ''[[New York Times]]'' op-ed piece he wrote: "You don't need kindergarten to know that a resident working a 36-hour shift is in no condition to make any kind of judgment call&mdash;forget about life-and-death."<ref name=wapo06/> The case eventually became a protracted high-profile legal battle, with multiple abrupt reversals; case reports about it appeared in major medical journals.<ref name=nejm>{{cite journal |author=Asch, D. A.; Parker, R. M. |title=The Libby Zion case. One step forward or two steps backward? |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=318 |issue=12 |pages=771–5 |year=1988 |month=March |pmid=3347226 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198803243181209}}</ref><ref name=nyt91/>

=== State investigation ===
In May 1986 Manhattan [[District Attorney]] [[Robert Morgenthau]] agreed to let a [[grand jury]] consider murder charges,<ref name=wapo06/> an unusual decision for a [[medical malpractice]] case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/health/03zion.html|title=A Life-Changing Case for Doctors in Training|newspaper=New York Times|last=Lerner|first=Barron H.|date=March 2, 2009|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> Although the jury declined to [[indict]] for murder, in 1987 the intern and resident were charged with 38 counts of [[gross negligence]] and/or gross incompetence. The grand jury considered that a series of mistakes contributed to Zion's death, including the improper prescription of drugs and the failure to perform adequate diagnostic tests.<ref name=wapo06/> Under New York law, the investigative body for these charges was the Hearing Committee of the [[Office of Professional Medical Conduct|State Board for Professional Medical Conduct]]. Between April 1987 and January 1989 the Committee conducted 30 hearings at which 33 witnesses testified, including [[expert witness]]es in [[toxicology]], [[emergency medicine]], and chairmen of internal medicine departments at six prominent medical schools, several of whom stated under oath that they had never heard of the interaction between meperidine and phenelzine prior to this case. At the end of these proceedings, the Hearing Committee unanimously decided that none of the 38 charges against the two residents was supported by evidence. Its findings were accepted by the full Board, and by the state's Health Commissioner, David Axelrod<!--do not link, he is none of those-->.<ref name=annim91/>

Under New York law however, the final decision in this matter rested with another body, the Board of Regents, which was under no obligation to consider either the Commissioner's or the Hearing Committee's recommendations. The Board of Regents, which at the time had only one physician amongst its 16 members, voted to "censure and reprimand" the resident physicians for acts of gross negligence.<ref name=annim91/> This decision did not affect their right to practice.<ref name=nyt91/> The verdict against the two residents was considered very surprising in medical circles. In no other case had the Board of Regents overruled the Commissioner's recommendation.<ref name=annim91/> The hospital also admitted that it had provided inadequate care and paid a $13,000 fine to the state.<ref name=nyt91/> In 1991, however, the state's appeals court completely cleared the records of the two doctors of findings that they had provided inadequate care to Zion.<ref name=nyt91/>

=== Civil trial ===
In parallel with the state investigation, Sidney Zion also filed a separate civil case against the doctors and the hospital.<ref name=nyt91>{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Sack |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Appeals Court Clears Doctors Who Were Censured in the Libby Zion Case  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DB1231F934A35751C0A963958260 |work=New York Times|date=November 1, 1991 |accessdate=2009-02-13 }}</ref> The civil trial came to a close in 1995 when a Manhattan jury found that the two residents and Libby Zion's primary care doctor contributed to her death by prescribing the wrong drug, and ordered them to pay a total of $375,000 to Zion's family for her pain and suffering. The jury also found that Raymond Sherman, the primary care physician, had lied on the witness stand in denying he knew that Libby Zion was to be given meperidine. Although the jury found the three doctors negligent, none of them were found guilty of "wanton" negligence, i.e. demonstrating utter disregard for the patient, as opposed to a simple mistake. Payouts for wanton negligence would not have been covered by the doctors' malpractice insurance.<ref name=nyt95/>

The emergency room physician, Maurice Leonard, as well as the hospital (as legal persona) were found not responsible for Zion's death in the civil trial. The jury decided that the hospital was negligent for leaving Weinstein alone in charge of 40 patients that night, but they also concluded that this negligence did not directly contribute to Zion's death. The trial was shown on [[Court TV]].<ref name=nyt95>{{cite news |first= Jan|last= Hoffman|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jurors Find Shared Blame In '84 Death  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DB1231F934A35751C0A963958260 |work=New York Times|date=February 7, 1995 |accessdate=2009-02-13 }}</ref>

{{further2|[[Medical resident work hours]]}}

After the grand jury's indictment of the two residents, the New York State Health Commissioner David Axelrod decided to address the systemic problems in [[residency (medicine)|residency]] by establishing a [[blue-ribbon panel]] of experts headed by Bertrand M. Bell, a primary care physician at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in the [[Bronx]]. Bell was well known for his critical stance regarding the lack of supervision of physicians-in-training.<ref name=wapo06/> Formally known as the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Emergency Services, and more commonly known as the Bell Commission, the committee evaluated the training and supervision of doctors in the state,<ref name=wapo06/> and developed a series of recommendations that addressed several patient care issues, including restraint usage, medication systems, and resident work hours.<ref name=nyt05/>

"In 1989, New York state adopted the Bell Commission's recommendations that residents could not work more than 80 hours a week or more than 24 consecutive hours" and that [[attending physician]]s "needed to be physically present in the hospital at all times. Hospitals instituted so-called night floats, doctors who worked overnight to spell their colleagues, allowing them to adhere to the new rules."<ref name=wapo06/> Periodic follow-up audits have prompted the [[New York State Department of Health]] to crack down on violating hospitals.<ref name=SZ97/> Similar limits have since been adopted in numerous other states.<ref name=wapo06>{{cite news
