'''Childhood cancer''' is [[cancer]] in a [[child]]. In the United States, an arbitrarily adopted standard of the ages used are 0–14 years inclusive, that is, up to 14 years 11.9 months of age.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humrep/15.1.227}}</ref><ref name=minnesota>[https://apps.health.state.mn.us/mndata/cancer_child Childhood Cancers: Basic Facts & Figures] from Minnesota Department of Health. Retrieved Dec, 2012</ref> However, the definition of childhood cancer sometimes includes young adults between 15-19 years old.<ref name=minnesota/> '''Pediatric oncology''' is the branch of [[medicine]] concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in children.

==Epidemiology==
===Incidence and mortality===
Worldwide, it is estimated that childhood cancer has an [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of more than 175,000 per year, and a [[mortality rate]] of approximately 96,000 per year.<ref>[http://www.childhoodcancer2012.org.uk/childhoodcancer.asp About childhood cancer] at Childhood Cancer 2012, by [[Children With Cancer UK]]</ref>

In the [[United States]], cancer is the second most [[common causes of death|common cause]] of [[Child mortality|death among children]] between the ages of 1 and 14 years, exceeded only by accidents.<ref name=cdc2009>[http://www.cdc.gov/features/dscancerinchildren/index.html Cancer in Children] from [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Page last reviewed: July 30, 2009</ref> More than 16 out of every 100,000 children and teens in the U.S. were diagnosed with cancer, and nearly 3 of every 100,000 died from the disease.<ref name=cdc2009/> In the United States in 2012, it was estimated that there was an [[incidence]] of 12,000 new cases, and 1,300 deaths, from cancer among children 0 to 14 years of age.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@epidemiologysurveilance/documents/document/acspc-029771.pdf Cancer Facts & Figures 2011] from [[American Cancer Society]].</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], an average of 1,603 children per year were diagnosed with cancer in 2008-2010.<ref name=cancerresearchuk>[http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/childhoodcancer/ Childhood cancer statistics] at [[Cancer Research UK]]. Updated: 14 November 2012.</ref> In 2007-2009, there was an average of 260 childhood deaths per year from cancer in the UK.<ref name=cancerresearchuk/>

In developed countries, childhood cancer has a mortality of approximately 20% of cases.<ref name=educationscotland/> In low resource settings, on the other hand, mortality is approximately 80%, or even 90% in the world's poorest countries.<ref name=educationscotland>[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/resources/i/internationalchildhoodcancerday.asp International Childhood Cancer Day – 15 February 2013] at educationscotland.gov.uk. Retrieved Dec, 2012</ref>

Rates of childhood cancer have increased by 0.6% per year between 1975 to 2002 in the United States<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ward EM, Thun, MJ, Hannan, LM, Jemal, A | title = Interpreting cancer trends | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1076 | issue = | pages = 29–53 | year = 2006 | month = Sep | pmid = 17119192 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1371.048 | bibcode = 2006NYASA1076...29W }}</ref> and by 1.1% per year between 1978 and 1997 in Europe.<ref name=Euro10/>

Internationally, the greatest variation in childhood cancer incidence occurs when comparing high-income contries to low-income ones.<ref name=who-scott>[http://www.who.int/ceh/capacity/cancer.pdf Children and Cancer], in ''Children's Health and the Environment'', a WHO Training Package for the Health Sector, World Health Organization.

===Risk factors===
Familial and [[Genetic epidemiology|genetic factor]]s are identified in 5-15% of childhood cancer cases. In <5-10% of cases, there are known environmental exposures and exogenous factors, such as prenatal exposure to [[tobacco]], [[X-ray]]s, or certain medications.<ref name="who-Birch-Lichtenstein"> [http://www.who.int/ceh/capacity/cancer.pdf Children and Cancer], in ''Children's Health and the Environment'', a WHO Training Package for the Health Sector, World Health Organization.

Aspects that make the risk factors of childhood cancer different from those seen in adult cancers include:<ref name=who-risks>[http://www.who.int/ceh/capacity/cancer.pdf Children and Cancer], in ''Children's Health and the Environment'', a WHO Training Package for the Health Sector, World Health Organization.</ref>
*Different, and sometimes unique, exposures to environmental hazards. Children must often rely on adults to protect them from toxic environmental agents.
*Immature physiological systems to [[Clearance (medicine)|clear]] or metabolize environmental substances
*The growth and development of children in phases known as "developmental windows" result in certain "critical windows of vulnerability".

Also, a longer life expectancy in children avails for a longer time to manifest cancer processes with long [[latency period]]s, increasing the risk of developing some cancer types later in life.<ref name=who-risks/>

===Types===
The most common cancers in children are [[Childhood leukemia|(childhood) leukemia]] (34%), [[brain tumor]]s (23%), and [[lymphoma]]s (12%).<ref name=Euro10>{{cite journal | author = Kaatsch P, Sikora, E, Pawelec, G | title = Epidemiology of childhood cancer | journal = Cancer treatment reviews | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 277–85 | year = 2010 | month = June | pmid = 20231056 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.02.003 }}</ref> In 2005, 4.1 of every 100,000 young people under 20 years of age in the U.S. were diagnosed with leukemia, and 0.8 per 100,000 died from it.<ref name=cdc2009/> The number of new cases was highest among the 1–4 age group, but the number of deaths was highest among the 10–14 age group.<ref name=cdc2009/> 

In 2005, 2.9 of every 100,000 people 0–19 years of age were found to have cancer of the brain or central nervous system, and 0.7 per 100,000 died from it.<ref name=cdc2009/> These cancers were found most often in children between 1 and 4 years of age, but the most deaths occurred among those aged 5–9.<ref name=cdc2009/> The main subtypes of brain and central nervous system tumors in children are: [[astrocytoma]], [[brain stem glioma]], [[craniopharyngioma]], desmoplastic infantile [[ganglioglioma]], [[ependymoma]], high-grade [[glioma]], [[medulloblastoma]] and [[atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor]].<ref name=asco>[http://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/childhood-cancer Childhood Cancer overview] from American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

Other, less common childhood cancer types are:<ref name=asco/>
*[[Neuroblastoma]] (7%)
*[[Wilms tumor]] (5%)
*[[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (4%)
*[[Rhabdomyosarcoma]] (3%)
*[[Retinoblastoma]] (3%)
*[[Osteosarcoma]] (3%)
*[[Ewing sarcoma]] (1%)
*[[Germ cell tumor]]s
*[[Pleuropulmonary blastoma]]

==Organizations==
Organizations focused on childhood cancer through [[cancer research]] and/or support programs include: [[Childhood Cancer Canada]], the [[Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group]] (in the [[United Kingdom]]), [[Child Cancer Foundation]] (in [[New Zealand]]) and [[American Childhood Cancer Organization]]<ref>[http://www.acco.org/ American Childhood Cancer Organization homepage]</ref> (in the [[United states]]).

The ''International Childhood Cancer Day'' occurs annually on February 15.<ref name=educationscotland/><ref>[http://www.childrenwithcancer.org/links/february-15th-is-world-childhood-cancer-awareness-day/ February 15th is International Childhood Cancer Awareness Day!!!] at The Foundation for Children with Cancer (FCC).

==Learning problems==
{{Main|Learning problems in childhood cancer}}
Children with cancer are at risk for developing various cognitive or learning problems.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/treatment/childrenandcancer/whenyourchildhascancer/children-diagnosed-with-cancer-returning-to-school Children Diagnosed With Cancer: Returning to School] from American Cancer Society. Last Medical Review: 07/02/2012</ref> These difficulties may be related to brain injury stemming from the cancer itself, such as a [[brain tumor]] or [[central nervous system]] [[metastasis]] or from side effects of cancer treatments such as [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy]].  Studies have shown that chemo and radiation therapies may damage brain [[white matter]] and disrupt brain activity.
