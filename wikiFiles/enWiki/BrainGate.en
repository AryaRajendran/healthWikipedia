'''BrainGate''' is a [[brain implant]] system built and previously owned by [[Cyberkinetics]], currently under development and in clinical trials, designed to help those who have lost control of their [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]], or other bodily functions, such as patients with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) or [[spinal cord injury]]. The Braingate technology and related Cyberkinetic’s assets are now owned by privately held Braingate, LLC.[1] The sensor, which is implanted into the [[brain]], monitors brain activity in the patient and converts the intention of the user into computer commands.

In its current form, BrainGate consists of a sensor implanted in the brain and an external decoder device, which connects to some kind of [[prosthetic]] or other external object.  The sensor uses 96 hair-thin [[electrodes]] that sense the electromagnetic signature of [[neurons]] firing in specific areas of the brain, for example, the area that controls arm movement. The sensor translates that activity into electrically charged signals, which are then sent to an external device and decoded in software.  The decoder connects to and can use the brain signals to control an external device, such as a robotic arm, a computer cursor, or even a wheelchair. In essence, BrainGate allows a person to manipulate objects in the world using only his or her mind.
 
In addition to real-time analysis of neuron patterns to relay movement, the BrainGate array is also capable of recording electrical data for later analysis. A potential use of this feature would be for a [[neurologist]] to study seizure patterns in a patient with [[epilepsy]].
 
BrainGate was originally developed by researchers in the Department of Neuroscience at [[Brown University]] in conjunction with [[Biotechnology|bio-tech]] company [[Cyberkinetics|Cyberkinetics, Inc.]].  Cyberkinetics later spun off the device manufacturing to Blackrock Microsystems, who now manufactures the sensors and the data acquisition hardware.<ref>[http://blackrockmicro.com/ Blackrock Microsystems]</ref>  The BrainGate Company purchased the intellectual property and related technology from Cyberkinetics and continues to owns the intellectual property related to BrainGate.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2009/08/cyberkinetics_braintocomputer.html BrainGate gets a new lease on life], The Boston Globe, August, 2009</ref><ref>[http://blackrockmicro.com/ Blackrock Microsystems]</ref><ref>[http://www.braingate.com BrainGate intellectual property and patents]</ref>

==Research and Experimental Results==
 
The initial clinical trial of BrainGate, led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, ran from 2004 to 2006 and studied four patients with [[tetraplegia]].  The results, published in a 2006 article in the journal ''Nature'', showed that a human with tetraplegia was able to control a cursor on a computer screen just by thinking, enabling him to open emails, and to operate devices such as a television.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7099/full/nature04970.html Neuronal ensemble control of prosthetic devices by a human with tetraplegia, Nature, July 2006]</ref> One participant, [[Matt Nagle]], had a spinal cord injury, whilst another had advanced [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]].<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.03/brain.html Mind Control, Wired, March 2005]</ref>
 
In July 2009, a second clinical trial (dubbed "BrainGate2") was initiated by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University, and the Providence VA.<ref>[http://www.braingate2.org BrainGate - Turning thought into Action]</ref><ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00912041 www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00912041]</ref>  In November 2011, researchers from the Stanford University [http://nptl.stanford.edu Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory] joined the trial as a second site.<ref>[https://www.stanford.edu/group/nptl/cgi-bin/site/node/19 Stanford joins BrainGate team developing brain-computer interface to aid people with paralysis, Nov 11, 2011]</ref><ref>[http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2011/november/braingate.html Stanford School of Medicine - Stanford joins BrainGate team developing brain-computer interface to aid people with paralysis]</ref>  This trial is [[#Current Clinical Trials|ongoing]].
 
In May 2012, BrainGate researchers published a study in ''Nature'' demonstrating that two people paralyzed by brainstem stroke several years earlier were able to control robotic arms for reaching and grasping.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7398/full/nature11076.html Reach and grasp by people with tetraplegia using a neurally controlled robotic arm, Nature, May 2012]</ref> One participant, Cathy Hutchinson, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ogBX18maUiM was able to use the arm to drink coffee from a bottle], the first time she was able to drink unaided in 15 years.<ref>[http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2012/05/braingate2 People with paralysis control robotic arms using brain-computer interface, Brown University, May 2012]</ref><ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/mind-controlled-robot-arms-show-promise-1.10652 Mind-controlled robot arms show promise, Nature, May 2012]</ref><ref>[https://www.stanford.edu/group/nptl/cgi-bin/site/node/13 People with paralysis control robotic arms using brain-computer interface, Stanford University, May 2012]</ref> This took place on site at The Boston Home in Dorchester, Massachusetts, a specialized residence where Ms. Hutchinson resided.<ref>http://www.thebostonhome.org/2012/05/16/the-boston-home-connection-to-a-technology-breakthrough/</ref> The study included researchers at Brown University, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and the German Aerospace Center.<ref>[https://www.stanford.edu/group/nptl/cgi-bin/site/node/13 People with paralysis control robotic arms using brain-computer interface, Stanford University, May 2012]</ref>

==Current Clinical Trials==
