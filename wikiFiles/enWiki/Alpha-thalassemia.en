'''Alpha-thalassemia''' (α-thalassemia) is a form of [[thalassemia]] involving the genes [[HBA1]]<ref>{{OMIM|141800}}</ref> and [[HBA2]].<ref>{{OMIM|141850}}</ref>  Alpha-thalassemia is due to impaired production of 1,2,3, or 4 alpha globin chains, leading to a relative excess of beta globin chains.  The degree of impairment is based on which clinical phenotype is present (how many chains are affected).

==Epidemiology==
The worldwide distribution of inherited alpha-thalassemia corresponds to areas of malaria exposure,<ref>Flint J, Hill AV, Bowden DK, et al. High frequencies of alpha-thalassaemia are the result of natural selection by malaria. Nature. 1986;321:744-750.</ref> suggesting a protective role for alpha-thalassemia against the more severe manifestations of malaria. Thus, alpha-thalassemia is common in sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, and different genetic subtypes have variable frequencies in each of these areas.<ref>Bernini LF. Geographic distribution of alpha thalassemia. In: Steinberg M, Forget B, Higgs D, et al., eds. Disorders of hemoglobin. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; 2001:878-894.</ref>  The epidemiology of alpha-thalassemia in the US reflects this global distribution pattern. The most common form of alpha(+) thalassemia seen in the US is due to the -alpha(3.7) deletion, a single alpha-globin gene deletion, and is present in approximately 30% of African Americans.<ref>Beutler E, West C. Hematologic differences between African-Americans and whites: the roles of iron deficiency and alpha-thalassemia on hemoglobin levels and mean corpuscular volume. Blood. 2005;106:740-745.</ref>  However, even in the homozygous state this disorder will result only in a mild [[microcytic anemia]]. The more serious clinical disorders of Hb H and Hb Bart hydrops fetalis syndrome, although found throughout the US today, are more common in the Western US and have dramatically increased in prevalence in the past 2 decades due to increased Asian immigration.<ref>Vichinsky EP, MacKlin EA, Waye JS, et al. Changes in the epidemiology of thalassemia in North America: a new minority disease. Pediatrics. 2005;116:818-825.</ref>

==Causes==
It is most commonly inherited in a Mendelian recessive fashion. It is also connected to the deletion of the 16p chromosome. 

It can also be acquired, under rare circumstances.<ref name="pmid15358626">{{cite journal |author=Steensma DP, Gibbons RJ, Higgs DR |title=Acquired alpha-thalassemia in association with myelodysplastic syndrome and other hematologic malignancies |journal=Blood |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=443–52 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15358626 |doi=10.1182/blood-2004-07-2792 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15358626}}</ref>  Due to the low occurrence of alpha-thalassemia, the disease can be mistaken for iron deficiency anemia.<ref>http://www.cooleysanemia.org/updates/pdf/Alpha_Thalassemia.pdf</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
α thalassemias result in decreased alpha-globin production, therefore fewer alpha-globin chains are produced, resulting in an excess of β chains in adults and excess γ chains in newborns. The excess β chains form unstable tetramers (called Hemoglobin H or HbH of 4 beta chains)  which have abnormal oxygen dissociation curves. The excess γ chains form tetramers which are poor carriers of O<sub>2</sub> since their affinity for O<sub>2</sub> is too high so it is not dissociated in the periphery. [[Homozygote]] α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemias, where there is lots of γ<sub>4</sub> but no α-globins at all (referred to as Hb Barts), often result in [[still birth]].

==Types==
There are two genetic loci for α globin, and thus four genes in diploid cells. Two genes are maternal in origin and two genes are paternal in origin.  The severity of the α thalassemias is correlated with the number of affected α globin genes: the greater, the more severe will be the manifestations of the disease.

When noting the genotype, a "-" indicates an absence of function, and a "α" indications a functional alpha chain. (In contrast to the "β<sup>o</sup>" and "β<sup>+</sup>" notation used in [[beta-thalassemia]], in alpha-thalassemia a distinction between absent and reduced function is not usually noted.)

| There is minimal effect. Three α-globin genes are enough to permit normal hemoglobin production, and there are no clinical symptoms. They have been called ''silent carriers''. They may have a slightly reduced [[mean corpuscular volume]] and [[mean corpuscular hemoglobin]].

| Two
| The condition is called ''alpha thalassemia trait''. Two α genes permit nearly normal [[erythropoiesis]], but there is a mild [[microcytic anemia|microcytic]] [[hypochromic]] [[anemia]]. The disease in this form can be mistaken for [[iron deficiency anemia]] and treated inappropriately with iron. 

Alpha thalassemia trait can exist in two forms: 

* alpha-thal-1 (-/- α/α), associated with Asians, involves ''cis'' deletion of both alpha genes on the same chromosome;
* alpha-thal-2 (-/α -/α), associated with Africans, involves ''trans'' deletion of alpha genes on different (homologous) chromosomes.

| The condition is called '''Hemoglobin H disease'''. Two unstable hemoglobins are present in the blood: Hemoglobin Barts (tetrameric [[γ chain]]s) and Hemoglobin H (tetrameric [[β chain]]s). Both of these unstable hemoglobins have a higher affinity for oxygen than normal hemoglobin, resulting in poor oxygen delivery to tissues. There is a [[microcytic anemia|microcytic]] [[hypochromic]] [[anemia]] with [[Target cell (codocyte)|target cell]]s and [[Heinz body|Heinz bodies]] (precipitated HbH) on the [[peripheral blood smear]], as well as [[splenomegaly]].  The disease may first be noticed in childhood or in early adult life, when the anemia and splenomegaly are noted.

| The [[fetus]] cannot live once outside the uterus and may not survive gestation: most such infants are dead at birth with ''[[hydrops fetalis]]'', and those who are born alive die shortly after birth. They are [[oedema|edematous]] and have little circulating hemoglobin, and the hemoglobin that is present is all tetrameric γ chains ([[hemoglobin Barts]]).
