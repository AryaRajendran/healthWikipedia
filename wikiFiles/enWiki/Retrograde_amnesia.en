'''Retrograde amnesia''' (RA) is a loss of access to events that occurred, or information that was learned, before an injury or the onset of a disease<references />.<ref name="Hunkinetal">Hunkin, N. M., Parkin, A. J., Bradley, V. A., Burrows, E. H., Aldrick, F. K., Jansari, A., & Burdon-Cooper, C. (1995). Focal retrograde amnesia following closed head injury: A case study and theoretical account, ''Neuropsychologia'', ''33''(4), 509-523.</ref>
RA is often temporally graded, consistent with [[Ribot's Law]]: subjects are more likely to lose recent memories that are closer to the traumatic incident than more remote memories.<ref name="Wixted">Wixted, J. T. (2004). The psychology and neuroscience of forgetting, ''Annual Review of Psychology'', ''55'', 235-269. {{doi|10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141555}}</ref>

==Brain structures==
The most commonly affected areas are associated with [[episodic memory|episodic]] and [[declarative memory]] such as the [[hippocampus]],<ref name="Cipolottietal">Cipolotti, L., Shallice, T., Chan, D., Fox, N., Scahill, R., Harrison, G., Stevens, J., & Rudge, P. (2001). Long-term retrograde amnesia...the crucial role of the hippocampus, ''Neuropsychologia'', ''39''(2), 151–172.</ref> the [[diencephalon]],<ref name="Dusoiretal"/> and the [[temporal lobe]]s.<ref name="Buccioneetal">Buccione, I., Fadda, L., Serra, L., Caltagirone, C., & Carlesimo, G. (2008). Retrograde episodic and semantic memory impairment correlates with side of temporal lobe damage, ''Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society'', ''14''(6), 1083-1094.</ref>
* The hippocampus deals largely with [[memory consolidation]],<ref name="Cipolottietal"/> in particular episodic memory. Its main responsibility is making information go from [[short-term memory|short-term memories]] into [[long-term memory|long-term]] stores. Amnesic patients with damage to the hippocampus are able to demonstrate some degree of unimpaired [[semantic memory]], despite loss of episodic memory, due to spared [[parahippocampal cortex]].<ref name="NadelMoscovitch">Nadel, L., & Moscovitch, M. (1997). Memory consolidation, retrograde amnesia and the hippocampal complex, ''Current Opinion in Neurobiology'', ''7''(2), 217-227. {{doi|10.1016/S0959-4388(97)80010-4}}</ref>
* The diencephalon and the surrounding areas' role in memory is not well understood. However, this structure appears to be involved in episodic memory recall.<ref name="Dusoiretal">Dusoir, H., Kapur, N., Byrnes, D. P., McKinstry, S., & Hoare, S. D. (1990). The role of diencephalic pathology in human memory disorder: Evidence from a penetrating paranasal brain injury, ''Brain'', ''113''(6), 1695-1706. {{doi|10.1093/brain/113.6.1695}}</ref>
* The temporal lobes are essential for semantic and factual memory processing. Aside from helping to consolidate memory with the hippocampus,<ref name="Buccioneetal"/> the temporal lobes are extremely important for semantic memory. Damage to this region of the brain can result in impaired organization and categorization of verbal material, disturbance of language comprehension, and impaired long-term memory. Right side lesions in particular, result in impaired recall of non-verbal material, such as music and drawings.<ref name="Milner">Milner, B. (1968). Visual recognition and recall after right temporal lobe excision in man, ''Neuropsychologia'', ''6'', 191-209.</ref> Difficulties in studying this region of the brain extend to its duties in comprehension, naming objects, verbal memory, and other language functions.<ref name="KolbWhishaw">Kolb, B., & Whishaw, I. (1990). Fundamentals of human neuropsychology. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York.</ref>

Plasticity of the brain is when rewiring occurs because of brain damage, finding different neural pathways and not relying on the damaged structures.<ref name="KolbGibb">Kolb, B., & Gibb, R. (2003). Brain plasticity and behavior, ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'', ''12''(1), 1-5. {{doi|10.1111/1467-8721.01210}}</ref> Thus, the brain can learn to be independent of the impaired hippocampus, but only to a certain extent.<ref name="SquireAlvarez"/>
For example, older memories are consolidated over time and in various structures of the brain, including [[Wernicke's area]] and the neocortex, making retrieval through alternate pathways possible.<ref name="Wixted"/>

==Types of retrograde amnesia==
As previously mentioned, RA commonly results from damage to the brain regions most closely associated with episodic and declarative memory, including [[autobiographical]] information. In extreme cases, individuals may completely forget who they are. Generally, this is a more severe type of amnesia known as [[global Amnesia|global]] or generalized amnesia.<ref name="Vaidyaetal">Vaidya, C. J., Gabrieli, J. D. E., Mieke, F. D., & Askari, N. (1998). Font-specific priming following global amnesia and occipital lobe damage, ''Neuropsychology'', ''12''(2), 183-192.</ref> However, memory loss can also be selective or categorical, manifested by a person's inability to remember events related to a specific incident or topic.

===Temporally graded retrograde amnesia===
Recovery often takes place after the onset of RA, which the Standard model accounts for. It suggests that the hippocampal formation is only used in systematic consolidation for a temporary and short period of time, until long-term consolidation takes place by other brain structures.<ref name="Winocuretal">Winocur, G., McDonald, R. M., & Moscovitch, M. (2001). Anterograde and retrograde amnesia in rats with large hippocampal lesions, ''Hippocampus'', ''11'', 18-26.</ref> The fact that damage to the hippocampal formation no longer causes RA, suggests that other brain structures are able to function more independently. RA can also progress, as in the case of [[Korsakoff syndrome]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], due to the ongoing nature of the damage. It is very rare to find stable RA, since improvement generally takes place among patients.

===Focal, isolated, and pure retrograde amnesia===
These terms are used to describe a pure form of RA, with an absence of [[anterograde amnesia]] (AA). In addition, Focal RA in particular, has also been used to describe a RA situation in which there is a lack of observable physical deficit as well.<ref name="evansetal">Evans, J. J., Breen, E. K., Antoun, N., & Hodges, J. R. (1996). Focal retrograde amnesia for autobiographical events following cerebral vasculitis: A connectionist account, ''Neurocase'', ''2''(1), 1-11.</ref> This could be described as a psychogenic form of amnesia with mild anterograde and retrograde loss.<ref name="Hunkinetal"/> A case study of '''DH''' revealed that the patient was unable to provide personal or public information, however there was no parahippocampal or [[entorhinal]] damage found.<ref name="Hunkinetal"/> Individuals with focal brain damage have minimal RA.<ref name="Kapur&Colls">Kapur, N., Ellison, D., Smith, M. P., McLellan, D. L., & Burrows, E. H. (1992). Focal retrograde amnesia following bilateral temporal lobe pathology, ''Brain'', ''115''(1), 73-85. {{doi|10.1093/brain/115.1.73}}</ref>

Isolated RA is associated with a visible [[thalamus|thalamic]] lesion.<ref name="Milleretal">Miller, L. A., Caine, D., Harding, A., Thompson, E. J., Large, M., & Watson, J. D. G. (2001). Right medial thalamic lesion causes isolated retrograde amnesia, ''Neuropsychologia'', ''39'', 1037-1046.</ref> Consistent with other forms of RA, the isolated form is marked by a profound inability to recall past information.<ref name="Milleretal"/>

A pure form of RA is rare as most cases of RA co-occur with AA.<ref name="Kopelman">Kopelman, M. (2000). Focal retrograde amnesia and the attribution of causality: An exceptionally critical review, ''Cognitive Neuropsychology'', ''17''(7), 585–621.</ref><ref name="FastFujiwara">Fast, K., & Fujiwara, E. (2001). Isolated retrograde amnesia, ''Neurocase'', ''7'', 269-282.</ref> A famous example is that of patient '''ML'''. The patient's MRI revealed damage to the right ventral frontal cortex and underlying white matter, including the [[uncinate fasciculus]], a band of fibres previously thought to mediate retrieval of specific events from one's personal past.<ref name="Levineetal"/>

==Causes==
The causal explanation of retrograde amnesia is under investigation, however, it is commonly associated with head injuries or traumas, Korsakoff syndrome, and individuals suffering from [[anterograde amnesia]] (AA).

The three main models used to explain RA assume that the hippocampus is one of the main areas of the brain used in memory consolidation.<ref name="NadelMoscovitch"/> During consolidation, the hippocampus acts as an intermediate tool that quickly stores new information until it is transferred to the [[neocortex]] for the long-term. The temporal lobe, which holds the hippocampus, [[entorhinal]], [[perirhinal]] and parahippocampal cortices, has a reciprocal connection with the neocortex.<ref name="SquireAlvarez"/> The temporal lobe is temporarily needed when consolidating new information; as the learning becomes stronger, the neocortex becomes more independent of the temporal lobe.<ref name="SquireAlvarez"/>

Studies on specific cases demonstrate how particular, impaired areas of the hippocampus are associated with the severity of RA. Damage can be limited to the CA1 field of the hippocampus, causing very limited RA for about 1 to 2 years.<ref name="SquireAlvarez"/> More extensive damage limited to the hippocampus causes temporally graded amnesia for 15 to 25 years.<ref name="SquireAlvarez"/> Another study also suggested that large medial temporal lobe lesions, that extends laterally to include other regions, produces more extensive RA, covering 40 to 50 years.<ref name="SquireAlvarez"/> These findings suggest that density of RA becomes more severe and long-term as the damage extends beyond the hippocampus to surrounding structures.

The common studied causes of RA do not always lead to the onset of RA.

===Traumatic brain injury (TBI) or post-traumatic amnesia===
Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as post-traumatic amnesia, occurs from an external force that causes structural damage to the brain, such as a sharp blow to the head, a [[diffuse axonal injury]],<ref name="Wolfetal">Wolf, J.A., Stys, P. K., Lusardi, T., Meaney, D., & Smith, D. H. (2001). Traumatic axonal injury induces calcium influx modulated by tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels, ''Journal of Neuroscience'', 21(6), 1923–1930</ref> or childhood brain damage (e.g., [[shaken baby syndrome]]).<ref name="Wolfetal"/> In cases of sudden rapid acceleration, the brain continues moving around in the skull, harming brain tissue as it hits internal protrusions.<ref name="HardmanManoukian">Hardman, J. M., & Manoukian, A. (2002). Pathology of head trauma, ''Neuroimaging Clinics of North America'', 12(2), 175–187</ref>

TBI varies according to impact of external forces, location of structural damage, and severity of damage ranging from mild to severe.<ref name="Winocuretal"/><ref name="Wolfetal"/><ref name="HardmanManoukian"/> Retrograde amnesia can be one of the many consequences of brain injury but it is important to note that it is not always the outcome of TBI. An example of a subgroup of people who are often exposed to TBI are individuals who are involved in high-contact sports. Research on football players takes a closer look at some of the implications to their high-contact activities. Enduring consistent head injuries can have an effect on the neural consolidation of memory.<ref name="YarnellLynch">Yarnell, P. R., & Lynch, S. (2007). Retrograde memory immediately after a concussion, ''The Lancet'', 295(7652), 863-864. {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(70)91691-0}}</ref>  In a study examining football players, it was found that those who had sustained head trauma on the field were better able to answer questions about plays made and players involved when they were asked immediately after the event (vs. a delayed period).<ref name="YarnellLynch"/>

Specific cases, such as that of patient ML, support the evidence that severe blows to the head can cause the onset of RA.<ref name="Levineetal">Levine, B., Black, S. E., Cabeza, R., Sinden, M., Mcintosh, A. R., Toth, J. P., Tulving, E., & Stuss, D. T. (1998). Episodic memory and the self in a case of isolated retrograde amnesia, ''Brain'', 121(10), 1951-1973. {{doi|10.1093/brain/121.10.1951}}</ref> In this specific case there was an onset of isolated RA following a severe head injury. The brain damage did not affect the person's ability to form new memories. Therefore, the idea that specific sections of retrograde memory are independent of anterograde is supported. Normally, there is a very gradual recovery, however, a dense period of amnesia immediately preceding the trauma usually persists.<ref name="YarnellLynch"/>

===Traumatic events===
RA can occur without any anatomical damage to the brain, lacking an observable neurobiological basis.<ref name="Stanilouretal">Stanilou, A., [[Hans Markowitsch|Markowitsch, H. J.]], & Brand, M. (2010). Psychogenic amnesia – A malady of the constricted self, ''Consciousness and Cognition: An International Journal'', 19(3), 778-801.</ref> Primarily referred to as [[psychogenic amnesia]] or [[psychogenic fugue]], it often occurs due to a traumatic situation that individuals wish to consciously or unconsciously avoid.<ref name="Markowitsch">Markowitsch, H. J. (2003). Psychogenic amnesia, ''NeuroImage'', 20(1), S132-S138. {{doi|10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.010}}</ref> The onset of psychogenic amnesia can be either global (i.e., individual forgets all history) or situation specific (i.e., individual is unable to retrieve memories of specific situations).<ref name="Diamondetal">Diamond, D. M., Park, C. R., & Woodson, J. C. (2004). Stress generates emotional memories and retrograde amnesia by inducing an endogenous form of hippocampal LTP, ''Hippocampus'', 14(3), 281-291.</ref>

People experiencing psychogenic amnesia have impaired episodic memory, instances of wandering and traveling, and acceptance of a new identity as a result of inaccessible memories pertaining to their previous identity.<ref name="Markowitsch"/>

Recent research has begun to investigate the effects of stress and fear-inducing situations with the onset of RA. [[Long-term potentiation]] (LTP) is the process by which there is a signal transmission between neurons after the activation of a neuron, which has been known to play a strong role in the hippocampus in learning and memory.<ref name="Diamondetal"/> Common changes in the hippocampus have been found to be related to stress and induced LTP.<ref name="Diamondetal"/> The commonalities support the idea that variations of stress can play a role in producing new memories as well as the onset of RA for other memories.<ref name="Diamondetal"/> Also, the [[amygdala]] plays a crucial role in memory and can be affected by emotional stimuli, evoking RA.<ref name="Strangeetal">Strange, B. A., Hurlemann, R., & Dolan, J. R. (2003). An emotion-induced retrograde amnesia in humans is amygdala- and β-adrenergic-dependent, ''PNAD'', 100(23), 13626-13631. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1635116100}}</ref>

Studies of specific cases, such as 'AMN', support evidence  of traumatic experiences as a plausible cause of RA. AMN escaped a small fire in his house, did not inhale any smoke, and had no brain damage. Surprisingly, the next day, he was unable to recall autobiographical based knowledge. This case shows that RA can occur in the absence of structural brain damage.<ref name="MarkowitschKessleretal">Markowitsch, H. J., Kessler, J., Van Der Ven, C., Weber-Luxenburger, G., Albers, M., & Heiss, W-D. (1998). Psychic trauma causing grossly reduced brain metabolism and cognitive deterioration, ''Psychologia'', 36(1), 77-82.</ref>

===Nutritional deficiency===
RA has been found among alcohol-dependent patients who suffer from Korsakoff syndrome.<ref name="DeBellisetal">De Bellis, M. D., Clark, D. B., Beers, S. R., Soloff, P. H., Boring, A. M., Hall, J., Kersh, A., & Keshavan, M. S. (2000). Hippocampal volume in adolescent-onset alcohol use disorder, ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'', 157, 737-744.</ref> Korsakoff syndrome patients suffer from retrograde amnesia due to a [[thiamine]] deficiency (lack of vitamin B1).<ref name="McEnteeMair">McEntee, W. J., & Mair, R. G. (1990). The Korsakoff syndrome: A neurochemical perspective, ''Trends in Neurosciences'', 13(8), 340-344.</ref> Also, chronic alcohol use disorders are associated with a decrease in volume of the left and right hippocampus.<ref name="DeBellisetal"/>

These patients' regular diet consists mostly of hard alcohol intake, which lacks the necessary nutrients for healthy development and maintenance.<ref name="McEnteeMair" /> Therefore, after a prolonged time consuming primarily alcohol, these people undergo memory difficulties and ultimately suffer from RA. However, some of the drawback of using Korsakoff patients to study RA is the progressive nature of the illness and the unknown time of onset.<ref name="SquireAlvarez"/>

===Infections===
Infections that pass the [[blood–brain barrier]] can cause brain damage ([[encephalitis]]), sometimes resulting in the onset of RA. In the case of patient 'SS', the infection led to focal or isolated retrograde amnesia where there was an absence of or limited AA. Brain scans show abnormalities in the bilateral medial temporal lobes, including two thirds of the hippocampal formation and the posterior part of the amygdala.<ref name="Fujiietal">Fujii, T., Yamadori, A., Endo, K., Suzuki, K., & Fukatsu, R. (1999). Disproportionate retrograde amnesia in a patient with herpes simplex encephalitis, ''Cortex'' 35(5), 599-614. {{doi|10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70822-0}}</ref>

===Surgery===
[[Henry Molaison]] suffered from epilepsy that progressed and worsened by his late twenties. The severity of his condition caused him to undergo surgery in an effort to prevent his seizures. Unfortunately, Molaison's surgeons removed his bilateral medial temporal lobe, causing profound AA and RA.<ref name="HMpap">Squire, L. R. (2009). [[http://whoville.ucsd.edu/PDFs/444_Squire_Neuron_2009.pdf The legacy of patient H.M. for neuroscience], ''Neuron'', 61, 6-10. {{doi|10.1016/j.neuron.2008.12.023}}</ref> The removed brain structures include the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the parahippocampal gyrus, now called the medial temporal lobe memory system.<ref name="HMpap"/>

Other patients who suffered RA due to surgery are 'P.B.' and 'F.C.' who had unilateral removal of the medial areas in the left temporal lobe.<ref name="HMpap"/>

===Controlled induction===
Clinically induced RA has been achieved using different forms of electrical induction.
* [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT), used as a depression therapy, can cause impairments in memory.<ref name="Ottosson">Ottosson, J-O. (1960). Experimental studies of memory impairment after electroconvulsive therapy, ''Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica'', 35(S145), 103-131. {{doi|10.1111/j.1600-0447.1960.tb08352.x}}</ref> Tests show that information of days and weeks before the ECT can be permanently lost.<ref name="Donahue">Donahue, A. B. (2000). Electroconvulsive therapy and memory loss: A personal journey, ''Journal of ECT'', 16(2), 133-143.</ref> The results of this study also show that severity of RA is more extreme in cases of bilateral ECT rather than unilateral ECT. Impairments can also be more intense if ECT is administered repetitively (sine wave simulation) as oppose to a single pulse (brief-pulse stimulation).<ref name="Squire">Squire, L. R. (1986). Memory functions as affected by electroconvulsive therapy, ''Annals of the New York Academy of Science'', 462, 307-314. {{doi|10.1111/j.1749-6632.1986.tb51265.x}}</ref>
* [[Electroconvulsive shock]] (ECS): The research in this field has been advanced by using animals as subjects.<ref name="Misanin">Misanin, J. R., Miller, R. R., & Lewis, D. J. (1986). Retrograde amnesia produced by electroconvulsive shock after reactivation of consolidated memory trace, ''Science'', 160(3827), 554-555.</ref> Researchers induce RA in rats, for example, by giving daily ECS treatments.<ref name="Raoetal">Rao, S. K., Andrade, C., Reddy, K., Madappa, K. N., Thyagarajan, S., & Chandra, S. (2002). Memory protective effect of indomethacin against electroconvulsive shock-induced retrograde amnesia in rats, ''Biological Psychiatry'', 51(9), 770-773. {{doi|10.1016/S0006-3223(01)01219-7}}</ref> This is done to further understand RA.

==Diagnosis and treatment==

===Testing for retrograde amnesia===
As previously mentioned, RA can affect people's memories in different degrees, but testing is required to help determine if someone is experiencing RA. Several tests exist, for example, testing for factual knowledge such as known public events.<ref name="ReedSquire">Reed, J. M., & Squire, L. R. (1998). Retrograde amnesia for facts and events: Findings from four new cases, ''The Journal of Neuroscience'', ''18''(10), 3943-3954.</ref> A downfall of this form of testing is that people generally differ in their knowledge of such subjects.<ref name="ReedSquire"/> Other ways to test someone is via autobiographical knowledge using the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI),<ref name="ReedSquire"/> comprising names of relatives, personal information, and job history. This information could help  determine if someone is experiencing RA and the degree of memory affected. However, due to the nature of the information being tested, it is often difficult to verify the accuracy of the memoirs being recalled, especially if they are from a distant past.<ref name="ReedSquire"/>

Brain abnormalities can be measured using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI),  [[computed tomography scan]] (CT) and [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalograhy]] (EEG), which can provide detailed information about specific brain structures. In many cases, an autopsy helps identify the exact brain region affected and the extent of the damage that caused RA once the patient has died.

There are some aspects essential to the patient that remain unaffected by RA. In many patients, their personality remains the same.<ref name="ScovilleMilner">Scoville, W. B., & Milner, B. (2000). Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal regions, ''Journal of Neuropsychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences'', ''12'', 103-113.</ref> Also, semantic memory, that is general knowledge about the world, is usually unaffected.<ref name="Markowitschetal">Markowitsch, H. J., Calabrese, P., Liess, J., Haupts, M., Durwen, H. F., & Gehlen, W. (1993).  An individual may be able to complete learned tasks but have no recollection of having learned them. Retrograde amnesia after traumatic injury of the fronto-temporal cortex, ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry'', ''56'', 988-992.</ref> However, episodic memory, which refers to one's life experiences, is impaired.<ref name="TulvingMarkowitsch">Tulving, E., & Markowitsch, H. J. (1998). Episodic and declarative memory: Role of the hippocampus, ''Hippocampus'', ''8'', 198-204.</ref>

The legal system had started to push for a standardized test for amnesia. It is common for people who have committed a crime to report having RA for that specific event because they want to avoid their punishment.  A standardized test would be able to identify individuals who are lying versus those who are truly suffering from RA.<ref name="wiggins&brandt">Wiggins, E. C., & Brandt, J. (1988). The detection of simulated amnesia, ''Law and Human Behavior'', ''12''(1), 57-78. {{doi|10.1007/BF01064274}}</ref>

===Spontaneous recovery===
When someone is suffering from RA, their memory cannot be recovered from simply being told personal experiences and their identity.<ref name="Cherkin">Cherkin, A. (1972). Retrograde amnesia in the chick: Resistance to the reminder effect, ''Physiology and Behavior'', ''8'', 949-955.</ref> This is called [[reminder effect]] or reminder treatment. The reminder effect consists of re-exposing the patient to past personal information,<ref name="Millinetal">Millin, P. M., Moody, E. W., & Riccio, D. C. (2001). Interpretations of retrograde amnesia: Old problems redux, ''Nature Reviews Neuroscience'', ''2'', 68-70. {{doi|10.1038/35049075}}</ref> which cannot reverse RA.<ref name="deHozetal">de Hoz, L., Martin, S. J., & Morris, R. G. M. (2004). Forgetting, reminding, and remembering: The retrieval of lost spatial memory, ''PLOS Biology'', ''2''(8), 225-235.</ref> Thus, reminding the patient details of their life has no scientific bearings on recovering memory. Fortunately, memory can be and usually is recovered due to [[spontaneous recovery]].<ref name="Cherkin"/>

==Case studies==
Since researchers are interested in examining the effects of disrupted brain areas and conducting experiments for further understanding of an unaffected, normal brain,<ref name="Esclapezetal">Esclapez, M., Tillakaratne, N. J., Kaufman, D. L., Tobin, A. J., & Houser, C. R. (1994). Comparative localization of two forms of glutamic acid decarboxylase and their mRNAs in rat brain supports the concept of functional differences between the forms, ''The Journal of Neuroscience'', ''14''(3), 1834-1855</ref> many individuals with brain damage have volunteered to undergo countless tests to advance our scientific knowledge of the human brain. For example, Henry Molaison was someone with significant brain damage and participated in a lot of neurological research. Furthermore, he was also the most tested person in neuropsychology.<ref name="Corkinetal">Corkin, S., Amaral, D. G., Gonzalez, R. G., Johnson, K. A., & Hyman, B. T. (1997). H. M.’s medial temporal lobe lesion: Findings from magnetic resonance imaging, ''The Journal of Neuroscience'', ''17''(10), 3964-3979.</ref> All living people who participate are referred to in literature using only their initials to protect privacy.

Patients with RA have exhibited an inability to describe future plans, whether in the near future (e.g., this afternoon) or in the distant future (e.g., next summer)<ref name="Tulvingetal">Tulving, E., Schacter, D. L., McLachlan, D. R., & Moscovitch, M. (1988). Priming of semantic autobiographical knowledge: A case study of retrograde amnesia, ''Brain and Cognition'', ''8''(1), 3-20. {{doi|10.1016/0278-2626(88)90035-8}}</ref> because of their inability to consolidate memories.<ref name="SquireAlvarez"/> Also, researchers have found these patients can identify themselves and loved ones in photographs, but cannot determine the time or place the photo was taken.<ref name="Tulvingetal"/> It has also been found that patients with RA greatly differ from the general population in remembering past events.<ref name="Kwanetal">Kwan, D., Carson, N., Addis, D. R., & Rosenbaum, R. S. (2010). Deficits in past remembering extend to future imagining in a case of developmental amnesia, ''Neuropsychologia'', ''48''(11), 3179-3186. {{doi|10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.06.011}}</ref>

A few case examples are:
* After a head injury, '''AB''' had to relearn personal information.<ref name="Fujiwaraetal">Fujiwara, E., Brand, M., Kratcht, L., Kessler, J., Diebel, A., Netz, J., & Markowtsch, H. J. (2008). Functional retrograde amnesia: A multiple case study, ''Cortex'', ''44'', 29-45. {{doi|10.1016/j.cortex.2005.09.001}}</ref> Many of AB’s habits had also changed.<ref name="Fujiwaraetal"/>
* Patient '''CD''', reported disorientation of place and time following his injuries as well as relearning previously learned information and activities (e.g., using a razor).<ref name="Fujiwaraetal"/>
* '''EF''' was examined and found to be very confused about social norms (e.g., appropriate attire outside his home). EF exhibited memory loss of his personal experiences (e.g., childhood), and the impaired ability to recognize his wife and parents.<ref name="Fujiwaraetal"/>
* '''JG''' is the first recorded patient suffering from isolated RA.<ref name="Milleretal"/>
* '''GH''', a mother and a wife, had surgery in August 2002. When GH woke up after the surgery, she believed it was May 1989.<ref name="Fujiwaraetal"/> Due to her amnesia, GH experienced great difficulty in her social environment, being overwhelmed by relationships to others.<ref name="Fujiwaraetal"/>

Although it may seem that people living with brain damage have great difficulty continuing the usual day-to-day aspects, they still can accomplish many feats. People with RA are able to lead a normal life. For instance, '''KC''' is a man who has many functional aspects intact; normal intelligence, unaffected perceptual and linguistic skills, short-term memory, social skills, and reasoning abilities.<ref name="Tulvingetal"/> All of these things are necessary in everyday life and contribute to normal living. KC also is fully capable of scripted activities (e.g., making reservations or changing a flat tire).<ref name="Tulvingetal"/>
In addition, patient '''HC''' successfully graduated high school and continued into post-secondary studies,<ref name="Kwanetal"/> an obvious accomplishment despite her condition.

==Other forms of amnesia==
Other forms of amnesia exist and may be confused with RA. For instance, [[anterograde amnesia]] (AA) is the inability to learn new information.<ref name="Dworetzky">Dworetzky, B. A. (2001). The neurology of memory, ''Seminars in Speech and Language'', ''22''(2), 97-108. {{doi|10.1055/s-2001-13934}}</ref> This describes a problem encoding, storing, or retrieving information that can be used in the future.<ref name="encoding">Markowitsch, H. J., & Calabrese, P. (1999). Neuroanatomy of memory. In ''The Oxford
Handbook of Memory'' (Tulving, E., & Craik, F.I.M., eds), pp. 465–484, Oxford University Press.</ref> It is important to note that these two conditions can, and often do both occur in the same patient simultaneously,<ref name="Winocuretal">Winocur, G., McDonald, R. M., & Moscovitch, M. (2001). Anterograde and retrograde amnesia in rats with large hippocampal lesions, Hippocampus, 11, 18-26.</ref> but are otherwise separate forms of amnesia.

RA can also be an inherent aspect of other forms of amnesia, namely [[transient global amnesia]] (TGA). TGA is the sudden onset of AA and RA caused by a traumatic event, however it is short lived, typically lasting only 4 to 8 hours.<ref>Fisher, C. M. (1982). Transient global amnesia, ''Archives of Neurology'', ''39''(10), 605-608.</ref> TGA is very difficult to study because of the patients quick recovery.<ref name="Guillery-Girardetal">Guillery-Girard, B., Desgranges, B., Urban, C., Piolino, P., de la Sayette, V., & Eustache, F. (2004). The dynamic time course of memory recovery in transient global amnesia, ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry'', ''75'', 1532-1540. {{doi|10.1136/jnnp.2003.024968}}</ref> This form of amnesia, like AA, remains distinct from RA.<ref name="SquireAlvarez">Squire, L. R., & Alvarez, P. (1995). Retrograde amnesia and memory consolidation: A neurobiological perspective, ''Current Opinion in Neurobiology'', ''5''(2), 169-177. {{doi|10.1016/0959-4388(95)80023-9}}</ref>
