'''''Schistosoma haematobium''''' is an important [[digenea|digenetic]] [[trematode]], and is found in the Middle East, India, Portugal and Africa. It is a major agent of [[schistosomiasis]]; more specifically, it is associated with [[urinary schistosomiasis]].

Adults are found in the [[Venous plexus]]es around the [[urinary bladder]] and the released eggs traverse the wall of the bladder causing [[haematuria]] and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes [[Calcification|calcified]], and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys otherwise known as [[hydronephrosis]]. Inflammation of the genitals due to ''S. haematobium'' may contribute to the propagation of HIV.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Leutscher PD, Pedersen M, Raharisolo C, ''et al.'' | title=Increased prevalence of leukocytes and elevated cytokine levels in semen from Schistosoma haematobium-infected individuals | journal=J Infect Dis | year=2005 | volume=191 | issue=10 | pages=1639–47 | pmid=15838790 | doi=10.1086/429334 }}</ref> Studies have shown the relationship between S. haematobium infection and the development of [[squamous cell]] carcinoma of the bladder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khurana S, Dubey ML, Malla N | title=Association of parasitic infections and cancers | journal=Indian J Med Microbiololgy | year=April 2005 | volume=23| issue=2 | pages=74–79 | doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(01)00357-2 }}</ref>

== Life cycle ==

The free swimming infective larval [[cercariae]] burrow into human skin when it comes into contact with contaminated water. The cercariae enter the blood stream of the host where they travel to the liver to mature into adult [[Trematoda|flukes]]. In order to avoid detection by the immune system inside the host, the adults have the ability to coat themselves with host [[antigen]]s.<ref name="Black 2005">{{cite book | author=Black, J. | year=2005 | title=Microbiology: Principles and Explorations | publisher=Wiley, New York}}</ref> After a period of about three weeks the young flukes migrate to the urinary bladder veins to copulate. The female fluke lays as many as 30 eggs per day which migrate to the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the urinary bladder and ureters. The eggs are eliminated from the host into the water supply with [[micturition]]. In fresh water, the eggs hatch forming free swimming [[miracidia]] which penetrate into the intermediate snail host<ref name="Black 2005"/> ''([[Bulinus]]'' spp., e.g. ''[[Bulinus globosus|B. globosus]]'', ''[[Bulinus forskalii|B. forskalii]]'', ''[[Bulinus nyassanus|B. nyassanus]]'' and ''[[Bulinus truncatus|B. truncatus]]''). Inside the snail, the miracidium sheds it [[epithelium]] and develops into a mother [[Trematode lifecycle stages|sporocyst]]. After two weeks the mother begins forming daughter sporocysts. Four weeks after the initial penetration of the miracardium into the snail [[furcocercous]] cercariae begin to be released. The cercariae cycle from the top of the water to the bottom for three days in the search of a human host. Within half an hour the cercariae enter the host epithelium.<ref>{{cite book | author=Roberts, L., Janovy, J. | year=1996 | title=Foundations of Parasitology, 5th edition | publisher=Wm. C.

== Diagnosis ==

The majority of diagnoses are made by examination of the urine for eggs. In chronic infections, or if eggs are difficult to find, an intradermal injection of schistosome antigen to form a [[wheal]] is effective in determining infection. Alternate diagnosis can be made by complement fixation tests.<ref name="Black 2005"/>

== Prevention ==

The main cause of schistomiasis is the dumping of human waste into water supplies. Hygienic disposal of waste would be sufficient to eliminate the disease.<ref name="Black 2005"/>

== Immunopathology ==

The immune system responds to eggs in liver causing [[hypersensitivity]]; an immune response is necessary to prevent damage to [[hepatocyte]]s. The hosts' antibodies which bind to the [[tegument]] of the Schistosome don't bind for long since the tegument is shed every few hours. The schistosome can also take on host proteins. Schistomiasis can be divided into three phases: (1) the migratory phase lasting from penetration to maturity,(2) the acute phase which occurs when the schistosomes begin producing eggs, and (3) the chronic phase which occurs mainly in endemic areas.<ref name="Black 2005"/>

== Pathology ==

The ova are initially deposited in the [[muscularis propria]] which leads to ulceration of the overlaying tissue. Infections are characterized by pronounced acute inflammation, squamous metaplasia, blood and reactive epithelial changes. [[Granuloma]]s and multinucleated giant cells may be seen.

== Treatment ==

The drug of choice is [[praziquantel]], a [[quinolone]] derivative.
