'''[[Medical tourism]] in [[Pakistan]]''' is viewed as an untapped market that can be turned into a huge opportunity if the government "focuses on key issues".<ref name="et">{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/365757/untapped-market-can-pakistan-become-a-hub-for-medical-tourism/|title=Untapped market: Can Pakistan become a hub for medical tourism?|work=Express Tribune|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> According to Pakistani medical experts, Pakistan has a "huge potential" in becoming a regional medical tourism hub, comparable to many other countries in its neighbourhood.<ref name="et"/> Medical tourism in Pakistan has been arranging potential trips for many medical health and care procedures.

==Overview==
The [[Government of Pakistan]] has mentioned its keenness on working towards medical tourism and has considered it as a key element in its recent tourism policy. In this regard, a task force was formed in 2010 under the [[Ministry of Tourism (Pakistan)|Ministry of Tourism]] whose objectives were to explore proposals to "promote and develop medical, health, spiritual and wellness tourism in Pakistan".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imtjonline.com/news/?entryid82=177733 |title=Pakistan appoints task force on medical tourism |publisher=International Medical Travel Journal |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref><ref name="eturbo">{{cite web|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/13941/pakistan-appoints-task-force-medical-tourism|title=Pakistan appoints task force on medical tourism|work=eTN Global News|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> The [[Government of Punjab, Pakistan|Government of Punjab]] undertook a venture to develop a 150-bed hospital for kidney transplantation and heart surgery, two specialties that Pakistan seeks to attract medical tourists for.<ref name="eturbo"/>

Tourism officials have claimed that that Pakistan can compete with other countries in medical tourism, and could even be "less than half the price of India".<ref name="eturbo"/>

The Minister for Tourism planned to introduce medical tourism in the country by providing "low cost state of the art medical facilities to the patients." According to the minister, a simple surgery could be "under a tenth of the cost of Europe or the US". He also said that Pakistan had highly qualified doctors to its benefit, as well as the latest medical equipment and hospitals with all necessary arrangements.<ref name="ghn">[http://globalhealthcarenetwork.com/page/pakistan-wants-medical-tourists-but Pakistan wants medical tourists, but not illegal transplants], Global Healthcare Network</ref>

==Patients==
A number of patients from neighbouring countries have traveled to Pakistan for treatment. Many patients, mainly of [[Pakistani diaspora|Pakistani origin]], from the [[Middle East]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]], also travel to Pakistan to seek a range of treatments which they cannot otherwise access in their resident countries either due to expensiveness or lack of insurance cover there; common treatments that these patients seek include cardiac surgery, infertility treatments and cosmetic surgery.<ref name="et"/> 

Pakistan’s initial entry into the medical tourism industry has been strongly reliant on cheap organ transplant tourism.<ref name="consumer report">[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:wHpDiTrHNGQJ:www.thenetwork.org.pk/Resources/Reports/PDF/25-7-2011-22-29-12-525-4.pdf+&hl=en&gl=au&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiwFvj3tRy1sk0fongxgBEb8LJReI7dvYr5KzqDR7zESxbWBih08ghnAeUJdpWcokV4h75-Z46uDm2AIPlPrw3XgfGuE0vHLupO1XOPeE4vOTcqhC5AMCwi1Ecjlu0kQdAYzMsa&sig=AHIEtbQgV5PSvT-fUcsLFLEANb_VyXEwng Medical tourism is a cover up for cheap kidney bazaar]</ref><ref name="ghn"/> In the past, a sizable number of global patients traveled to Pakistan for kidney transplants. However, these cases have dropped ever since a legislation, that sought to outlaw the illegal trade of selling kidneys, was enacted.<ref name="et"/> According to Pakistani medical experts, medical tourism is still an untapped market that can be turned into a huge opportunity if the government "focuses on key issues".<ref name="et"/>

==Source countries==
Most medical patients who seek treatment in Pakistan are from neighbouring countries. According to [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] figures, some 90% of Afghans who seek medical treatment abroad travel to neighbouring Pakistan.<ref name="afghan">{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/afghanistan/contents.aspx?type=statements&id=6|title=PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN RELATIONSHIP: A JOURNEY OF FRIENDSHIP BY MOHAMMAD SADIQ AMBASSADOR OF PAKISTAN|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|accessdate=20 November 2012|first=Mohammad|last=Sadiq}}</ref> The majority of Afghan patients are from the poorer strata of society who have access to free medical treatment in Pakistani government or  philanthropic healthcare facilities. Over forty percent of patients in [[Peshawar]]'s largest government hospital were Afghans who had travelled from [[Afghanistan]] to Peshawar for medical treatment.<ref name="afghan"/> Nearly one-third of all visas issued to Afghan nationals by the Pakistani embassy and consulates in Afghanistan pertain to medical reasons. In 2008, one philanthropic organisation in Pakistan performed over 30,000 free eye surgeries on Afghan patients.<ref name="afghan"/>

==Challenges==
The continuing illegal organ transplant trade has hampered the image of the country's medical tourism industry. Kidney trade, mostly illegal, was once a thriving billion-dollar industry in Pakistan until the introduction of a law to prevent it.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/dying-days-for-pakistans-kidney-tourist-trade/2008/05/11/1210444240320.html Dying days for Pakistan's kidney tourist trade], The Age (Australia)</ref> The illegal trade is still practiced however, with numerous cases being reported of foreign patients having traveled to Pakistan to get a kidney transplant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/411570/cash-for-kidneys-pakistans-flourishing-trade-in-illegal-transplants/|title=Cash for kidneys: Pakistan’s flourishing trade in illegal transplants|work=Express Tribune|date=23 July 2012|accessdate=23 July 2012|first=Ali|last=Usman}}</ref> Secondly, while there is a large base of doctors present in the country, the overall health infrastructure of Pakistan is not as advanced or comparable to international standards. Only a certain number of modern and reputable hospitals exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpad.org.pk/Oct-Dec%202007/1.Editorial%20Medical%20Tourism.pdf|title= Medical tourism: are we ready to take the challenge?|work= Journal of Pakistan Association of Dermatologists}}</ref> In addition, security-related issues have also prevented foreigners from travelling to Pakistan exclusively for seeking medical treatment.

Professor Tipu Sultan from [[Bahria University]] has argued that while the government has focused on improving hospital quality in the hope of attracting medical tourists, "[[terrorism in Pakistan]] is scaring away potential health customers." He adds that Pakistan could offer services to foreigners in orthopedic, optometric, ENT, heart, and urology treatments at cheap rates besides offering facilities in endoscopies, X-rays, MRI, CT scan, cardiology and arthroscopy. Commenting on patients from the United States of Pakistani origin who come to Pakistan instead of going to neighboring India to receive treatment, Sultan has said that treatment in Pakistan for them tends to be much cheaper than in India "because of the downward slide of the [[rupee]] in terms of the [[US Dollar|dollar]]." He has also said that while there are good national hospitals, they have not shown enough interest in medical tourism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Connell|first=John|title=Medical Tourism|year=2010|publisher=CABI|pages=76–77|ISBN=978-1-84593-660-0}}</ref>
