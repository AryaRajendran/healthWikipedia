'''Sheldrake Island''' (l'Île aux Becs-Scies) is known for being the site of New Brunswick's first [[lazaretto]]. It is located only 8 miles from [[Chatham, New Brunswick|Chatham]], on the [[Miramichi River]].<ref name="Stewart1">{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=William Brenton|title=Medicine in New Brunswick|year=1974|publisher=New Brunswick Medical Society|location=Moncton|page=33|chapter=Leprosy in New Brunswick}}</ref>

==History==

The lazaretto was established in 1844, on the site of a cholera<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theshipslist.com/1847/Miramichi.shtml|title=Miramichi and Middle Island In 1847|date=January 21, 2005|work=The Ships List|accessdate=24 July 2011|quote=Because of the cholera alarm in 1832, a more remote Island, Sheldrake Island, was purchased but it was not used afterwards, for some time.}}</ref> [[quarantine station]] from 1832. 44 lepers were landed in July 19,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.gnb.ca/0007/culture/heritage/srchtext-e.asp?SearchString=miramichi|title=This Week in New Brunswick History!|year=2006|publisher=Heritage Branch, Wellness, Culture & Sport|accessdate=27 July 2011|quote=New Brunswick's first lazaretto opens on Sheldrake Island in Miramichi Bay. [...]}}</ref> 1844, the majority being [[Acadians]],<ref name="Stewart1"/> from the [[Tracadie–Sheila|Tracadie]]-[[Neguac, New Brunswick|Neguac]] area.

The island also contained housing for [[typhus]] patients, but the lepers objected to this. The arrival of a ship from Ireland with many typhus and smallpox patients forced them to be moved to [[Miramichi, New Brunswick#Middle Island|Middle Island]].<ref name="proud">{{cite book | title=Proud Stories from the Miramichi| last=Underhill| first=Doug| year=2001| pages=96–7| publisher=Neptune Pub. Co.| location=Canada| chapter=Middle Island: Mystique, Tragedy and Romance| isbn=1896270239}}</ref>

Dr. Alexander Key, Secretary to the Board of Health for [[Northumberland County, New Brunswick|Northumberland]] and [[Gloucester County, New Brunswick|Gloucester]], was the official in charge. The buildings were filthy with vermin. Soon the lepers lost faith in Dr. Key's remedies and began escaping. By December 18, there were only 20 left.<ref name="Stewart1"/>

The board recommended punishment and locking them up. The escaped lepers were hunted down and brought back in handcuffs. The lazaretto was soon surrounded by a spiked [[palisade]] 12&nbsp;ft high.<ref name="Stewart2">{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=William Brenton|title=Medicine in New Brunswick|year=1974|publisher=New Brunswick Medical Society|location=Moncton|page=34|chapter=Leprosy in New Brunswick}}</ref>

The inmates burned the buildings in October 1845. The quarantine station was reopened after 1847.<ref name="Stewart2"/>

The remaining inmates were moved to a new lazaretto in Tracadie in 1849.<ref name="Stewart2"/>

A temporary quarantine station was ordered to be erected on the island in March 1848. Disagreements over the matter meant that the buildings were not moved from Middle Island until April 3. A brawl erupted on the island between representatives of the Board of Health and Justices of the Peace over the matter. As a result, the buildings stayed on the ice until the order was cancelled and the buildings were moved back.<ref name="proud2">{{cite book | title=Proud Stories from the Miramichi| last=Underhill| first=Doug| year=2001| pages=103–4| publisher=Neptune Pub. Co.| location=Canada| chapter=Middle Island: Mystique, Tragedy and Romance| isbn=1896270239}}</ref>

==Current uses==

The island is mostly uninhabited, except for an historic lighthouse, known as ''Sheldrake Island Front Range Light''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wlol.arlhs.com/lighthouse/CAN941.html|title=Sheldrake Island Front Range Light - ARLHS CAN-941|work=Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>

A leper's cemetery is on the island, containing 15 graves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/Search.do?R=VE_1303&lang=fr&ex=on|title=La Léproserie de Tracadie |trans_title=The Leprosarium of Tracadie|publisher=Musée Historique de Tracadie Inc.|accessdate=2 December 2012|language=French}}</ref>
