'''Immunoglobulin M''', or '''IgM''' for short, is a basic [[antibody]] that is produced by [[B cell]]s.  IgM is by far the physically largest antibody in the human circulatory system. It is the first antibody to appear in response to initial exposure to antigen.<ref>Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. "Immunoglobulin M." The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition.

==Structure and function==
IgM forms [[polymers]] where multiple [[immunoglobulins]] are covalently linked together with [[disulfide bond]]s, mostly as a pentamer but also as a hexamer. IgM has a [[molecular mass]] of approximately 970 [[Dalton (unit)|kDa]] (in its pentamer form). Because each [[monomer]] has two antigen binding sites, a pentameric IgM has 10 binding sites.  Typically, however, IgM cannot bind 10 antigens at the same time because the large size of most antigens hinders binding to nearby sites.

The [[J chain]] is found in pentameric IgM but not in the hexameric form, perhaps due to space constraints in the hexameric complex.  Pentameric IgM can also be made in the absence of J chain.  At present, it is still uncertain what fraction of normal pentamer contains J chain, and to this extent it is also uncertain whether a J chain-containing pentamer contains one or more than one J chain.

Because IgM is a large molecule, it cannot [[diffusion|diffuse]] well, and is found in the [[interstitium]] only in very low quantities. IgM is primarily found in [[Blood plasma|serum]]; however, because of the J chain, it is also important as a secretory immunoglobulin.

Due to its polymeric nature, IgM possesses high [[avidity]], and is particularly effective at [[complement system|complement]] activation. By itself, IgM is an ineffective [[opsonin]]; however it contributes greatly to opsonization by activating complement and causing [[C3b]] to bind to the antigen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wellek|first=B.|coauthors=Hahn, H., Opferkuch, W.|title=Opsonizing activities of IgG, IgM antibodies and the C3b inactivator-cleaved third component of complement in macrophage phagocytosis|journal=Agents and Actions|date=1 February 1976|volume=6|issue=1–3|pages=260–262|doi=10.1007/BF01972219|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q1375338k875040g/|accessdate=24 March 2011|pmid=941799}}</ref>

==Expression==
In [[germline]] cells, the [[gene]] segment encoding the μ constant region of the [[heavy chain]] is positioned first among other constant region gene segments. For this reason, IgM is the first immunoglobulin expressed by mature B cells.

It is also the first immunoglobulin expressed in the fetus (around 20 weeks) and also phylogenetically the earliest antibody to develop.<ref>''Review of Medical Physiology'' by [[William Francis Ganong (physiologist)|William Francis Ganong]]</ref>

==Clinical significance==
IgM antibodies appear early in the course of an infection and usually reappear, to a lesser extent, after further exposure. IgM antibodies do not pass across the human placenta (only isotype [[IgG]]).

These two biological properties of IgM make it useful in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Demonstrating IgM antibodies in a patient's serum indicates recent infection, or in a neonate's serum indicates intrauterine infection (e.g. [[congenital rubella]]).

The development of anti-donor IgM after organ transplantation is not associated with graft rejection but it may have a protective effect.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Protective anti-donor IgM production after crossmatch positive liver-kidney transplantation.|journal=Liver Transpl|date=February 2004|volume=10|issue=2|pages=315–319|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lt.20062/pdf|accessdate=24 March 2011|pmid=1476287}}</ref>

==Other points==
IgM in normal serum is often found to bind to specific antigens, even in the absence of prior immunization.  For this reason IgM has sometimes been called a "natural antibody".  This phenomenon is probably due to the high avidity of IgM that allow it to bind detectably even to weakly cross-reacting [[antigen]]s that are naturally occurring.  For example the IgM antibodies that bind to the red blood cell [[ABO blood group system|A and B antigens]] might be formed in early life as a result of exposure to A- and B-like substances that are present on bacteria or perhaps also on plant materials.

IgM antibodies are mainly responsible for the clumping ([[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]]) of [[red blood cell]]s if the recipient of a [[blood transfusion]] receives blood that is not compatible with their [[blood type]].

IgM is more sensitive to denaturation by [[2-mercaptoethanol]] than [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]]. This technique was historically used to distinguish between these isotypes before specific anti-IgG and anti-IgM secondary antibodies for [[immunoassay]]s became commercially available. Serum samples would be tested for reactivity with an antigen before or after 2-mercaptoethanol treatment to determine whether the activity was due to IgM or IgG. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
