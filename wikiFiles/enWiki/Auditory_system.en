The '''auditory system''' is the [[sensory system]] for the sense of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].

== Peripheral auditory system ==
The auditory periphery, starting with the [[ear]], is the first stage of the [[Transduction_(physiology)|transduction]] of [[sound]] in a hearing organism. While not part of the [[nervous system]], its components feed directly into the nervous system, performing [[Mechanotransduction#Ear|mechanoeletrical transduction]] of sound [[P-wave|pressure-waves]] into neural [[Action_potential|action potentials]].
=== Outer ear ===
{{main|Outer ear}}
The folds of cartilage surrounding the ear canal are called the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]].  Sound waves are reflected and attenuated when they hit the pinna, and these changes provide additional information that will help the brain determine the direction from which the sounds came.

The sound waves enter the [[auditory canal]], a deceptively simple tube.  The ear canal amplifies sounds that are between 3 and 12 [[kHz]].  At the far end of the ear canal is the [[eardrum]] (or tympanic membrane), which marks the beginning of the [[middle ear]].

=== Middle ear ===
{{main|Middle ear}}
Sound waves traveling through the ear canal will hit the tympanic membrane, or [[eardrum]]. This wave information travels across the air-filled middle ear cavity via a series of delicate bones: the [[malleus]] (hammer), [[incus]] (anvil) and [[stapes]] (stirrup). These [[ossicles]] act as a lever and a teletype, converting the lower-pressure eardrum sound vibrations into higher-pressure sound vibrations at another, smaller membrane called the [[oval window|oval (or elliptical) window]]. The malleus articulates with the tympanic membrane via the manubrium, where the stapes articulates with the oval window via its footplate. Higher pressure is necessary because the inner ear beyond the oval window contains liquid rather than air. The sound is not amplified uniformly across the ossicular chain.  The [[stapedius reflex]] of the middle ear muscles helps protect the inner ear from damage.  The middle ear still contains the sound information in wave form; it is converted to nerve impulses in the cochlea.

=== Inner ear ===

{{main|Inner ear}}
The inner ear consists of the [[cochlea]] and several non-auditory structures.  The cochlea has three fluid-filled sections, and supports a fluid wave driven by pressure across the [[basilar membrane]] separating two of the sections. Strikingly, one section, called the cochlear duct or ''[[scala media]],'' contains [[endolymph]], a fluid similar in composition to the intracellular fluid found inside cells. The organ of Corti is located in this duct on the basilar membrane, and transforms mechanical waves to electric signals in neurons. The other two sections are known as the ''scala tympani'' and the ''scala vestibuli''; these are located within the bony labyrinth, which is filled with fluid called perilymph, similar in composition to cerebrospinal fluid. The chemical difference between the two fluids (endolymph & perilymph) is important for the function of the inner ear due to electrical potential differences between potassium and calcium ions.

The plan view of the human cochlea (typical of all mammalian and most vertebrates) shows where specific frequencies occur along its length. The frequency is an approximately exponential function of the length of the cochlea within the Organ of Corti. In some species, such as bats and dolphins, the relationship is expanded in specific areas to support their active sonar capability.

==== Organ of Corti ====
{{Main|Organ of Corti}}
[[File:Cochlea-crosssection.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[organ of Corti]] located at the ''[[scala media]]''.]]
The organ of Corti forms a ribbon of sensory epithelium which runs lengthwise down the cochlea's entire ''scala media''. Its hair cells transform the fluid waves into nerve signals. The journey of countless nerves begins with this first step; from here, further processing leads to a panoply of auditory reactions and sensations.

==== Hair cell ====
{{main|Hair cell}}
Hair cells are columnar cells, each with a bundle of 100-200 specialized [[cilia]] at the top, for which they are named. There are two types of hair cells. Inner hair cells are the mechanoreceptors for hearing: they transduce the vibration of sound into electrical activity in nerve fibers, which is transmitted to the brain. Outer hair cells are a motor structure. Sound energy causes changes in the shape of these cells, which serves to amplify sound vibrations in a frequency specific manner. Lightly resting atop the longest cilia of the inner hair cells is the tectorial membrane, which moves back and forth with each cycle of sound, tilting the cilia, which is what elicits the hair cells' electrical responses. 

Inner hair cells, like the [[photoreceptor cell]]s of the eye, show a  [[postsynaptic potential|graded response]], instead of the [[action potential|spikes]] typical of other neurons.  These graded potentials are not bound by the “all or none” properties of an action potential. 

At this point, one may ask how such a wiggle of a hair bundle triggers a difference in membrane potential. The current model is that cilia are attached to one another by “tip links,” structures which link the tips of one cilium to another. Stretching and compressing, the tip links may open an ion channel and produce the receptor potential in the hair cell. Recently it has been shown that cdh23 and pchh15 are the adhesion molecules associated with these tip links. It is thought that a calcium driven motor causes a  shortening of these links to regenerate tensions. This regeneration of tension allows for apprehension of prolonged auditory stimulation.

==== Neurons ====
{{Main|Hair cell#Neural connection|l1=Hair cell neural connection}}

Afferent neurons innervate cochlear inner hair cells, at synapses where the neurotransmitter [[glutamate]] communicates signals from the hair cells to the dendrites of the primary auditory neurons.

There are far fewer inner hair cells in the cochlea than afferent nerve fibers - many auditory nerve fibers are innervated by each hair cell. The neural dendrites belong to neurons of the [[auditory nerve]], which in turn joins the [[vestibular nerve]] to form the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]], or [[cranial nerve]] number VIII.<ref>[http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/meded/GrossAnatomy/h_n/cn/cn1/cn8.htm Meddean - CN VIII. Vestibulocochlear Nerve]</ref>
The region of the basilar membrane supplying the inputs to a particular afferent nerve fibre can be considered to be its [[receptive field]].

Efferent projections from the brain to the cochlea also play a role in the perception of sound, although this is not well understood. Efferent synapses occur on outer hair cells and on afferent (towards the brain) dendrites under inner hair cells

==Central auditory system== <!--Central auditory system redirects here-->
[[File:Aud pathway.png|200px|right|thumb|Auditory pathway.]]
This sound information, now re-encoded, travels down the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]], through intermediate stations such as the [[cochlear nuclei]] and [[superior olivary complex]] of the [[brainstem]] and the [[inferior colliculus]] of the [[midbrain]], being further processed at each waypoint.  The information eventually reaches the [[thalamus]], and from there it is relayed to the cortex. In the [[human brain]], the [[primary auditory cortex]] is located in the [[temporal lobe]].

Associated anatomical structures include:

=== Cochlear nucleus ===
{{main|Cochlear nucleus}}

The [[cochlear nucleus]] is the first site of the neuronal processing of the newly converted “digital” data from the inner ear (see also [[binaural fusion]]).  In mammals, this region is anatomically and physiologically split into two regions, the [[dorsal cochlear nucleus]] (DCN), and [[ventral cochlear nucleus]] (VCN).

=== Trapezoid body ===
{{main|Trapezoid body}}

The [[Trapezoid body]] is a bundle of decussating fibers in the ventral pons that carry information used for binaural computations in the brainstem.

=== Superior olivary complex ===
{{main|Superior olivary complex}}

The [[superior olivary complex]] is located in the [[pons]], and receives projections predominantly from the ventral cochlear nucleus, although the dorsal cochlear nucleus projects there as well, via the ventral acoustic stria.  Within the [[superior olivary complex]] lies the lateral superior olive (LSO) and the medial superior olive (MSO).  The former is important in detecting interaural level differences while the latter is important in distinguishing interaural time difference.

[[File:Lateral lemniscus.PNG|thumb|right|200px| '''Lateral lemniscus''' in red, as it connects the [[cochlear nucleus]], [[superior olivary nucleus]] and the [[inferior colliculus]]. Seen from behind.]]

=== Lateral lemniscus ===
{{main|Lateral lemniscus}}

The lateral lemniscus is a tract of [[axon]]s in the [[brainstem]] that carries information about sound from the [[cochlear nucleus]] to various brainstem nuclei and ultimately the contralateral [[inferior colliculus]] of the [[midbrain]].

=== Inferior colliculi ===
{{main|Inferior colliculus}}

The [[inferior colliculus|IC]] are located just below the visual processing centers known as the superior colliculi.  The central nucleus of the IC is a nearly obligatory relay in the ascending auditory system, and most likely acts to integrate information (specifically regarding sound source localization from the [[superior olivary complex]] and [[dorsal cochlear nucleus]]) before sending it to the thalamus and cortex.

=== Medial geniculate nucleus ===
{{main|Medial geniculate nucleus}}

The [[medial geniculate nucleus]] is part of the thalamic relay system.

=== Primary auditory cortex ===
[[File:Primary auditory cortex.PNG|thumb|right|200px]]

{{main|Primary auditory cortex}}

The [[primary auditory cortex]] is the first region of [[cerebral cortex]] to receive auditory input.

Perception of sound is associated with the left posterior [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STG). The superior temporal gyrus contains several important structures of the brain, including [[Brodmann areas]] 41 and 42, marking the location of the [[primary auditory cortex]], the cortical region responsible for the sensation of basic characteristics of sound such as pitch and rhythm. We know from work in nonhuman primates that primary auditory cortex can probably itself be divided further into functionally differentiable subregions.

The neurons of the primary auditory cortex can be considered to have [[receptive field]]s covering a range of auditory frequencies. Neurons integrating information from the two ears have receptive fields covering a particular region of auditory space.

Primary auditory cortex is surrounded by secondary auditory cortex, and interconnects with it. These secondary areas interconnect with further processing areas in the superior temporal gyrus, in the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and in the frontal lobe. In humans, connections of these regions with the middle temporal gyrus are probably important for speech perception.  The frontotemporal system underlying auditory perception allows us to distinguish sounds as speech, music, or noise.
