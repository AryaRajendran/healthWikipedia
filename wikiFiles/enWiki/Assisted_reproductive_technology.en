'''Assisted reproductive technology''' ('''ART''') is a general term referring to methods used to achieve [[pregnancy]] by artificial or partially artificial means. It is [[reproductive technology]] used primarily in [[infertility]] treatments, otherwise known as 'fertility treatments'. Some forms of ''ART'' are also used in fertile couples for [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|genetic reasons]]. ''ART'' is also used in couples who are discordant for certain communicable diseases, e.g. [[AIDS]], to reduce the risk of infection when a pregnancy is desired. Examples of ''ART'' include [[in vitro fertilization]], [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI), [[cryopreservation]], and intrauterine insemination (IUI). There is yet no strict definition of the term. Usage of the ART mainly belongs in the field of [[reproductive endocrinology and infertility]].

==Definitions==
While there is no consensus on the definition, generally the process of intercourse is bypassed either by [[artificial insemination]] or fertilization of the [[oocyte]]s in the laboratory environment (i.e., [[in vitro fertilization]]).  

*The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)—which is required as a result of the 1992 Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act to publish the annual ART success rates at U.S. fertility clinics—defines ART to include "all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled. In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman's body or donating them to another woman."  According to CDC, "they do not include treatments in which only sperm are handled (i.e., intrauterine—or artificial—insemination) or procedures in which a woman takes medicine only to stimulate egg production without the intention of having eggs retrieved."

==Procedures==
Procedures are mainly [[fertility medication]], as well as ART techniques that use more substantial and forceful interventions, of which [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) and expansions of it (e.g. OCR, AZH, ICSI, ZIFT) are the most prevalent. However, there are also other manual ART, not necessarily dependent on IVF (e.g. PGD, GIFT, SSR).

===Medication===
{{Main|Fertility medication}}

Most fertility medication are agents that stimulate the development of follicles in the ovary. Examples are gonadotropins and gonadotropin releasing hormone.

===In vitro fertilization===
{{Main|In vitro fertilization}}
In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the technique of letting [[fertilization]] of the male and female [[gametes]] (sperm and egg) occur outside the female body.

Techniques usually used in in vitro fertilization include:
*[[Transvaginal ovum retrieval]] (OCR) is the process whereby a small needle is inserted through the back of the vagina and guided via ultrasound into the ovarian follicles to collect the fluid that contains the eggs.
*[[Embryo transfer]] is the step in the process whereby one or several embryos are placed into the uterus of the female with the intent to establish a pregnancy.

Less commonly used techniques in in vitro fertilization are: 
*[[Assisted zona hatching]] (AZH) is performed shortly before the embryo is transferred to the uterus. A small opening is made in the outer layer surrounding the egg in order to help the embryo hatch out and aid in the implantation process of the growing embryo.
*[[Image:Tr icsi 03.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)]][[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) is beneficial in the case of male factor infertility where sperm counts are very low or failed fertilization occurred with previous IVF attempt(s). The ICSI procedure involves a single sperm carefully injected into the center of an egg using a microneedle. This method is also sometimes employed when donor sperm is used.
*[[Autologous endometrial coculture]] is a possible treatment for patients who have failed previous IVF attempts or who have poor embryo quality. The patient's fertilized eggs are placed on top of a layer of cells from the patient's own uterine lining, creating a more natural environment for embryo development.
*In [[zygote intrafallopian transfer]] (ZIFT), egg cells are removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilized in the laboratory; the resulting zygote is then placed into the fallopian tube.
*[[Cytoplasmic transfer]] is the technique in which the contents of a fertile egg from a donor are injected into the infertile egg of the patient along with the sperm.
*[[Egg donor]]s are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery, chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously unsuccessful IVF cycles or [[advanced maternal age]]. In the egg donor process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilized in the laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus.
*[[Sperm donation]] may provide the source for the sperm used in IVF procedures where the male partner produces no sperm or has an inheritable disease, or where the woman being treated has no male partner.
*[[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) involves the use of genetic screening mechanisms such as Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) or Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to help identify genetically abnormal embryos and improve healthy outcomes.
*[[Embryo splitting (disambiguation)|Embryo splitting]] can be used for twinning to increase the number of available embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

===Surrogacy===
[[Surrogacy]] via a [[gestational carrier]] is an option when a patient's medical condition prevents a safe pregnancy, when a patient has ovaries but no uterus due to congenital absence or previous surgical removal, and where a patient has no ovaries and is also unable to carry a pregnancy to full term.

===Others===
The following techniques don't necessarily involve IVF:

*In [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]] (GIFT) a mixture of sperm and eggs is placed directly into a woman's fallopian tubes using laparoscopy following a transvaginal ovum retrieval.
*[[Sex selection]] is the attempt to control the sex of offspring to achieve a desired sex. It can be accomplished in several ways, both pre- and post-implantation of an embryo, as well as at birth. Pre-implantation techniques include PGD, but also [[sperm sorting]].
*[[Artificial insemination]] (AI) is when sperm is placed into a female's uterus (intrauterine) or cervix (intracervical) using artificial means rather than by natural copulation. N.B. This can be a very low-tech process, performed at home by the woman alone or with her partner.<ref>'' Knock Yourself Up: A Tell-All Guide to Becoming a Single Mom'' by Louise Sloan. Reviewed in ''[[Newsweek]]'' 27 October 2007.</ref>
** [[Conception device]]s, such as a [[Conception Cap|conception cap]] are used to aid conception by enhancing{{Vague|date=February 2009}} the natural process.  Conception caps are used by placing [[semen]] into a small conception cap, then placing the cap onto the [[cervix]].  This holds the semen at the [[cervical os]], protecting the semen from the acidic vaginal secretions and keeping it in contact with the cervical mucus.
** [[Artificial insemination#Donor variations|Artificial insemination by donor]] is used in situations where the woman doesn't have a partner with functional sperm. Instead, a [[sperm donor]] supplies the sperm.
*[[Surrogacy]], where a woman agrees to become pregnant and deliver a child for a contracted party. It may be her own genetic child, or a child conceived through [[natural insemination]], [[in vitro fertilization]] or [[embryo transfer]] using another woman's [[ovum|ova]].
*[[Reproductive surgery]], treating e.g. [[fallopian tube obstruction]] and [[vas deferens obstruction]], or reversing a [[vasectomy]] by a [[reverse vasectomy]].
**In [[surgical sperm retrieval]] (SSR) the reproductive urologist obtains sperm from the vas deferens, epididymis or directly from the testis in a short outpatient procedure.
*By [[cryopreservation]], eggs, sperm and reproductive tissue can be preserved for later IVF.

==Risks==
The majority of IVF-conceived infants do not have [[congenital disorder|birth defect]]s.<!--

6.2% of IVF-conceived children had major defects, as compared with 4.4% of naturally conceived children matched for [[maternal age effect|maternal age]] and other factors ([[odds ratio]], 1.3; 95% [[confidence interval]], 1.00 to 1.67).<!--
  --><ref name="Van Voorhis 2007"/>

The main risks are:

* [[Genetic disorder]]s. [[DNA damage]] increases in e.g. IVF and ICSI, which is reflected e.g. by upregulation of the [[gene expression]] of [[HNRNPC]] in the placenta.<ref name=zhang>{{cite journal |author=Zhang Y, Zhang YL, Feng C, ''et al.'' |title=Comparative proteomic analysis of human placenta derived from assisted reproductive technology |journal=Proteomics |volume= 8|issue= 20|pages= 4344–56|year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18792929 |doi=10.1002/pmic.200800294 |url=}}</ref>
* [[Low birth weight]]. In IVF and ICSI, a risk factor is the decreased expression of proteins in [[energy metabolism]]; [[Ferritin light chain]] and [[ATP5A1]].<ref name=zhang/>
* [[Preterm birth]]. Low birth weight and preterm birth are strongly associated with many health problems, such as [[visual impairment]] and [[cerebral palsy]], and children born after IVF are roughly twice as likely to have cerebral palsy.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |year=2009 |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=72–83 |title= Cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, and developmental delay in children born after assisted conception: a systematic review and meta-analysis |author= Hvidtjørn D, Schieve L, Schendel D, Jacobsson B, Sværke C, Thorsen P |pmid=19124707 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/72 |doi= 10.1001/archpediatrics.2008.507}}</ref>

Other risk factors are:
*[[Membrane damage]], which is contributed to or reflected by increased expression of the [[membrane fusion protein]]s [[NAPA (gene)|NAPA]] and [[Annexin A3]].<ref name=zhang/>

[[Sperm donation]] is an exception, with a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared to the general population.<ref>[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1983-09-01/The-Sperm-Crisis.aspx motherearthnews.com – THE SPERM CRISIS]</ref> It may be explained by that sperm banks accept only people with high sperm count.

Current data indicate little or no increased risk for [[postpartum depression]] among women who use ART.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq025}}</ref>

==Usage==
Assisted reproductive technology procedures performed in the U.S. has more than doubled since 10 years ago, with 140.000 procedures in 2006,<ref name=chicagoART>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/arts/chi-0621-fertility-dramas-side1jun21,0,7805988.story chicagotribune.com Infertility by the numbers] Colleen Mastony. June 21, 2009</ref> resulting in 55.000 infants born.<ref name=chicagoART/>

In [[Australia]], 3.1% of babies now born are a result of ART.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26117922-12377,00.html 'More IVF babies but less multiple births'] THE AUSTRALIAN. September 24, 2009</ref>

In case of [[discontinuation]] of fertility treatment, the most common reasons have been estimated to be: postponement of treatment (39%), physical and psychological burden (19%, psychological burden 14%, physical burden 6.32%), relational and personal problems (17%, personal reasons 9%, relational problems 9%), treatment rejection (13%) and organizational (12%) and clinic (8%) problems.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms031}}</ref>

==Costs==

===United States of America===
Not everyone in the U.S. has [[health insurance|insurance]] coverage for fertility investigations and treatments. Many states are starting to mandate coverage, and the rate of utilization is 277% higher in states with complete coverage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jain T, Harlow BL, Hornstein MD |title=Insurance coverage and outcomes of ''in vitro'' fertilization |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=347 |issue=9 |pages=661–6 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12200554 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa013491}}</ref>

There are some health insurance companies that cover diagnosis of infertility but frequently once diagnosed will not cover any treatment costs.

2005 approximate treatment/diagnosis costs (United States, costs in US$):
* Initial workup: [[hysteroscopy]], [[hysterosalpingogram]], [[blood test]]s ~$2,000
* Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) aka Artificial insemination ~ $200– 900 per. trial
* Sonohysterogram (SHG) ~ $600 – 1,000
* Clomiphene citrate cycle ~ $ 200 – 500
* IVF cycle ~ $10,000 -30,000
* Use of a [[surrogate mother]] to carry the child – dependent on arrangements

Another way to look at costs is to determine the expected cost of establishing a pregnancy. Thus if a clomiphene treatment has a chance to establish a pregnancy in 8% of cycles and costs $500, the expected cost is $6,000 to establish a pregnancy, compared to an IVF cycle (cycle fecundity 40%) with a corresponding expected cost of $30,000 ($12,000/.4).

For the community as a whole, the cost of IVF on average pays back by 700% by tax from future employment by the conceived human being.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Connolly MP, Pollard MS, Hoorens S, Kaplan BR, Oskowitz SP, Silber SJ |title=Long-term economic benefits attributed to IVF-conceived children: a lifetime tax calculation |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=598–604 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18778175 |url=http://www.ajmc.com/pubMed.php?pii=10709}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
In the UK all patients have the right to preliminary testing, provided free of charge by the [[National Health Service]]. However, treatment is not widely available on the NHS and there can be long waiting lists. Many patients therefore pay for immediate treatment within the NHS or seek help from private clinics.<ref>[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=214&sectionId=10957 Infertility Treatment, NHS Direct Online] (NHS Direct Online Health Enyclopaedia)</ref>

===Sweden===
In Sweden, official fertility clinics provide most necessary treatments and initial workup, but there are long waiting lists, especially for egg donations, since the donor gets just as low reward as the receiving couple are charged. However, there are private fertility clinics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Canada===
{{see also|Assisted Human Reproduction Act}}
Some treatments are covered by OHIP (public health insurance) in Ontario and others are not. Those undergoing artificial insemination or with bilaterally blocked fallopian tubes and under 40 have treatment is covered but are still required to pay lab fees (around $3,000–4,000).  Coverage varies in other provinces.  Most other patients are required to pay for treatments themselves.<ref>[http://www.ivfcanada.com/services/fees/general_fee_schedule.cfm IVF Canada]</ref>

===Israel===
Israel's National Health Insurance, which is mandatory for all Israeli citizens, covers nearly all fertility treatments. In-Vitro-Fertilization costs are fully subsidized up to the birth of two children for all Israeli women, including single women and lesbian couples. Embryo transfers for purposes of gestational surrogacy are also covered.<ref>Teman, Elly. 2010. [http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/11401.php Birthing a Mother: the Surrogate Body and the Pregnant Self.] Berkeley: University of California Press</ref>

===New Zealand===
The national public health system of New Zealand covers IVF treatment in specific circumstances only, based on a 'points for conception challenges' equation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Publicly funded IVF treatments are limited (between one and three treatments dependent on criteria) and are subject to substantial wait-lists, dependent on local health funding region, which raises potential inequity of ART support across the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Infertility testing through blood tests can be covered by public funding, however in the absence of explicit gynecological complications, additional investigations are may not be covered publicly. Investigation such as a hysterosalpingogram may be covered, but the wait-list could be in excess of six weeks, whereas a privately sourced HSG can cost $NZ900 but is readily available.   Many New Zealanders select self-funded IVF cycles, at approximately $NZ10,000 per cycle, and other forms of ART, such as IUI, at approximately $NZ1200, using the services of private fertility clinics, which in itself is a growing local industry. Individuals using private services are generally not covered under personal health insurance policies in New Zealand.

===Germany===
On 27 January 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional, that the health insurance companies have to bear only 50 percent of the cost for in vitro fertilization.<ref>[http://www.samenspender-info.de/zuschuesse-kuenstliche-befruchtung.html Zuschüsse der Krankenversicherung für eine künstliche Befruchtung ] Retrieved 2. January 2013.</ref> On 2 March 2012, the Federal Council has approved a draft law of some federal states, which provides that the federal government provides a subsidy of 25 percent to the cost. Thus, the share of costs borne for the pair would drop to just 25 percent.<ref>[http://www.insemination-erfolg.de/finanzierung-befruchtung.html Finanzierung künstlicher Befruchtung] Retrieved 2. January 2013.</ref>

==Ethics==
Some couples find it difficult to stop treatment despite very bad prognosis, resulting in futile therapies. This may give ART providers a difficult decision of whether to continue or refuse treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine | title = Fertility treatment when the prognosis is very poor or futile. | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1194–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19726040 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.07.979 }}</ref>

==Fictional representation==
Films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades.<ref name=chicagotribune>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/art/chi-0621-fertility-dramasjun21,0,2997759.story chicagotribune.com --> Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen] By Colleen Mastony, Tribune reporter. June 21, 2009</ref>  Yet, the amount of people that can relate to it by personal experience in one way or another is ever growing, and the variety of trials and struggles are huge.<ref name=chicagotribune/>

''For specific examples, refer to the fiction sections in individual subarticles, e.g. [[Surrogacy#Fictional_representation|surrogacy]], [[Sperm_donor#Fictional_representation|sperm donation]] and [[fertility clinic]].''

In addition, [[reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]] has been present for many decades.
