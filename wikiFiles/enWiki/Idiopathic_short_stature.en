'''[[Idiopathic]] short stature''' (ISS) refers to extreme [[short stature]] that does not have a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] explanation (''idiopathic'' designates a condition that is unexplained or not understood) after an ordinary [[growth evaluation]]. The term has been in use since at least 1975<ref name="pmid1105371">{{cite journal |author=Sizonenko PC, Rabinovitch A, Schneider P, Paunier L, Wollheim CB, Zahnd G |title=Plasma growth hormone, insulin, and glucagon responses to arginine infusion in children and adolescents with idiopathic short stature, isolated growth hormone deficiency, panhypopituitarism, and anorexia nervosa |journal=Pediatr.

In 2003 [[Eli Lilly and Company]] offered a more precise definition of ISS when the pharmaceutical company submitted clinical trial data to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) requesting approval to advertise their brand of [[growth hormone treatment|growth hormone]] for the treatment of ISS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leschek EW |title=Effect of growth hormone treatment on adult height in peripubertal children with idiopathic short stature: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial |journal=J.
