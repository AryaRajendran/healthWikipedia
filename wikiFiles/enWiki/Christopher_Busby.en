'''Christopher Busby''' (born 1 September 1945) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist known for his controversial theories about the negative health effects of very low-dose [[ionising radiation]].
Busby is a director of Green Audit Limited, a private company,<ref name=greenA>[http://www.greenaudit.org Green Audit]</ref> and scientific advisor to the Low Level Radiation Campaign (LLRC) another private company that Busby set up in 1999.<ref>Green Audit, [http://www.greenaudit.org/about_green_audit.htm About Green Audit]</ref> Busby is a visiting professor at the [[University of Ulster]].<ref name=ulster-busby /> Busby was the National Speaker on Science and Technology for the [[Green Party of England and Wales]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news-archive/874.html |title=Greens launch radiation activist network |publisher=Green Party of England and Wales |date=23 October 2004 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/files/reports/2004/Labour%20record%201.htm |title=Far more spin than substance |publisher=Green Party of England and Wales |date=2 September 2002 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref>

Following the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], Busby established a television and internet presence where he discussed the risks of [[ionizing radiation]] and the [[Japanese Government|Japanese Government's]] handling of the disaster. Busby furthermore marketed, on his Japanese language website, tests and a mineral supplement (dubbed by critics an "anti-radiation" pill) that he claimed could mitigate the effects of ingested [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]].<ref name=BusbyPills>{{Cite news| last = Monbiot| first = George| coauthors = Justin McCurry| title = Post-Fukushima 'anti-radiation' pills condemned by scientists| work = The Guardian| accessdate = 2011-11-22| date = 2011-11-21| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/21/christopher-busby-radiation-pills-fukushima| location=London}}</ref>

In particular, Busby's SET predicts that the [[Strontium 90|<sup>90</sup>Sr-<sup>90</sup>Y]] decay chain might be some ~30 times more carcinogenic than predicted by [[Linear no-threshold model|LNT]], because <!-- according to Busby=superfluous, sentence starting with BUSBY'S --> primary exposure to a beta particle alters a cell to the [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> Phase]], in which <!-- he claims=dito--><!-- A beta-particle, A cell, a phase in which IT is--> it is highly [[Radiosensitivity|radio-sensitive]], and a second particle "hit" within a few hours is more likely to cause [[carcinogenesis]].

Furthermore, it was established in 1906 (The Law of Bergonié and Tribondeau) that cells in the [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> Phase]] are more resistant to radiation than cells in the [[Cell_cycle#Mitosis_.28M_Phase.2FMitotic_phase.29|M Phase]] ([[Radiosensitivity]] and [[Cell cycle]]).<ref name=Ribondeau>{{Cite journal

* The lack of biological plausibility for the basic preconditions of the SET
* The paucity of supporting evidence in the proponents’ reviews of the SET
* The weakness of studies cited in support of the SET
* The absence of supporting evidence found by the independent review commissioned by the Committee

CERRIE also considered and rejected by 10 to 2 consensus the biphasic (bimodal) curve of Burlakova ''et al.'' (1999),<ref name=Burlakova2/> due to the study's "substantial shortcomings"; tables were so ambiguous that the risk-dose response could be interpreted as linear, biphasic or even promoting health ([[radiation hormesis]]).<ref name=Goodhead/>

Busby responded by selling for £25 a 3 person [[minority report]] on his website, which claims that internal low-level radiation is 300 times more dangerous than predicted, the currently accepted [[Linear no-threshold model|LNT]] model is meaningless, and in Sweden and Belarus cancer rates have risen by 40% since Chernobyl.<ref>{{Cite web

Later work by Busby focused on the health effects of ingested [[Depleted Uranium]] particles. In particular he proposes that ingested [[Uranium]] particles cause [[photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] enhancement that increases the genotoxic effect of natural background [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] by 500 to 1000 times (he claims natural gamma rays strike [[Uranium]] and generate via the photoelectric effect [[secondary electrons]] that damage cells).<ref name=pacifica>[http://www.pacifica.org/programs/dn/030131.html pacifica.org radio], January 31, 2003 interview with Busby, Retrieved 10-02-2008</ref><ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1422130.stm "Scientist raises new radiation fear"], news.bbc.co.uk, July 5, 2001</ref> Recent work by Busby (2008)<ref name=BusbySchnug>{{Cite book

== Conflicts with other Low-Dose Radiation researchers ==

Busby is the author of two self-published books on cancer incidence in Wales, ''Wings of Death'' and ''Wolves of Water''; the latter was lauded in a review published by a group that "aims to provide a safe forum for the critical and open minded discussion of ideas that go beyond conventional paradigms in science, medicine and philosophy [and to] challenge the adequacy of "scientific materialism" as an exclusive basis for knowledge and values."  According to the reviewer, described as a former research immunologist, "Busby dissects the workings of the government advisory establishment, the biased science and institutional cover-ups of the causes of cancer and other illnesses".<ref>{{Cite web | title = Dr Roger Taylor | work = Book review on Wolves of Water | publisher = The Scientific and Medical Network Review 97 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.scimednet.org/corporate-responsibility/ | accessdate = 2008}}

Busby has criticized other researchers studying health effects from low-dose radiation, for being "stupid" and "ignorant", and in particular [[Wade Allison|Prof. Wade Allison]] (emeritus) of Oxford who had quoted a UN report saying that only 28 people have died as of 2005 from radiation releases at Chernobyl and who has said there is an "over-reaction" to low-dose radiation.<ref name=counterpunch>{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/busby03282011.html | last = Busby | first = Christopher | date = 2011-03-28 | title=Deconstructing Nuclear Experts | publisher = [[CounterPunch]] | accessdate = 2011-04-17 }}</ref><ref name="Viewpoint: We should stop running away from radiation">{{cite news|last=Allison|first=Wade|title=Viewpoint: We should stop running away from radiation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12860842|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 April 2011|date=26 March 2011}}</ref>  In particular, he seems to have taken exception to Allison on philosophical grounds:
:I have chosen to pitch into him since he epitomises and crystallises for us the arguments of the stupid physicist. In this he has done us a favour, since he is really easy to shoot down.

The old [[Bertrand Russell|Bertie Russell]] [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] trap.<ref name=counterpunch/>

Busby went on to say, claiming support from a [[New York Academy of Sciences]] publication titled ''[[Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment]]'', that "more than a million people have died between 1986 and 2004 as a direct result of Chernobyl."<ref name=counterpunch/>  The report was in actuality only a translation of a Russian book not put under [[peer review]] by NYAS.

==Televised comments on Fukushima I nuclear accidents==

In a March 14 broadcast on BBC, Busby was interviewed along with [[Ian Fells]], and characterized the accident as "exactly the same scenario" as [[Chernobyl]].  While admitting that the containment structure for [[Fukushima Dai-ichi]] was more much advanced than that at Chernobyl, he claimed there could be "nuclear explosion" rather than (as reported) a hydrogen explosion, if fuel elements had [[Nuclear meltdown|melted down]] and collected at the bottom of the vessel.  He also asserted that radiation levels measured at a reactor north of Fukushima Dai-ichi (i.e. [[Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant|Onagawa]]) indicated that "up to 100 kilometers away, we are getting concentrations of plutonium, cesium and iodine" (sic - presumably radionuclides thereof) released from Fukushima Dai-ichi, making the releases comparable in his opinion to Chernobyl, in terms of human health impact.  In response to Fells' characterization of the worst immediate effects being loss of power to an advanced industrial society, Busby said "this is a radiological catastrophe already", asserting in particular that plutonium releases were a major cause of concern.<ref name=bbc14mar2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhlgks_radiation-risk-from-nuclear-power-station-in-japan_news|title=Professor Busby gives his assessment of radiation from Fukushima nuclear reactor|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>

On 30 March 2011 Busby first appeared on Russia Today stating that the [[Fukushima Nuclear Disaster]] was worse than being reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MognnB0g56Y|title=Full meltdown in full swing? Japan maximum nuclear alert|publisher=RT News|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref> During the follow up interview on April 13, 2011, Busby stated that Fukushima radiation pollution could cause up to 400,000 added cancer cases among those living within 200&nbsp;km of the reactor, with " reports of significant radiation ... even south of Tokyo".<ref>{{Cite news

In the same Russia Today broadcast, he referred to calculations made with his colleagues estimating that Chernobyl had killed 1,400,000 people, and that Fukushima's death toll would be in the same range, if not worse.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Busby: 'Can't seal Fukushima like Chernobyl - it all goes into sea' |date=2011-04-25 |publisher=[[Russia Today]] |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-3Kf4JakWI }} ([http://rt.com/news/no-end-fukushima-tragedy/ “I don’t think the end of Fukushima accident is in sight”])</ref>

=== Controversy Regarding Sale of "Anti-Radiation" Pills ===


Following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], Busby established an internet presence discussing the risks of [[ionizing radiation]] and a [[conspiracy theory]] involving [[Japanese Government|Japanese Government's]] efforts to spread radioactive contamination throughout the country. He also marketed online, services and a [[mineral supplements|mineral supplement]] he claimed mitigate the dangers of ingested [[ionizing radiation|radioisotopes]].<ref name=BusbyPills/>

Most notably, Busby claimed radioactive [[caesium-137]] released from the nuclear disaster can cause heart muscle damage and heart attacks in children and a [[mineral supplement]], sold on his Japanese language website via 4u-detox of San Pedro, California, could prevent these deleterious effects (labelled ''Busby Laboratories, Formula 1, Christopher Busby Foundation for The Children of Fukushima'').<ref>[http://www.cbfcf.org/ Christopher Busby Foundation for The Children of Fukushima (CBFCF)]</ref> Busby says he bases his cardiac claims on the work of husband-and-wife team [[Yury Bandazhevsky]] & Galina Bandazhevskaya; known for their controversial claims that arrhythmia and heart attacks occurred in children at [[caesium-137]] levels as low as 50 Bqkg<sup>−1</sup> and that oral apple [[pectin]] increases its excretion (by comparison [[Banana equivalent dose|banana]] contains ''ca.'' 3000 Bqkg<sup>−1</sup> of natural [[potassium-40]]).<ref name=Bandazhevskaya>{{Cite journal| volume = 134| issue = 49–50| pages = 725–729| last = Bandazhevskaya| first = GS| coauthors = VB Nesterenko, VI Babenko, IV Babenko, TV Yerkovich, YI Bandazhevsky| title = Relationship between Caesium (137Cs) load, cardiovascular symptoms, and source of food in "Chernobyl" children-preliminary observations after intake of oral apple pectin| journal = Swiss Medical Weekly| year = 2004| pmid = 15635491}}</ref><ref name=Blomfield>{{Cite news| last = Blomfield| first = Adrian| coauthors = Adrian Blomfield| title = Chernobyl scientist warns of 'nuclear folly'| work = The Telegraph| accessdate = 2011-11-25| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3338827/Chernobyl-scientist-warns-of-nuclear-folly.html| location=London| date=2006-04-24}}</ref>

Busby later self-published a document that he claimed offered [[theory|theoretical]] support for his supplement, namely an ability to block certain radioisotopes from binding to DNA. However, his document also explains that his supplement ''can not'' block [[caesium-137]], because it does not contain a protective dose of stable caesium: 
{{cquote|''Unfortunately, the laws prohibit the sale of such tablets despite the fact that Caesium is totally non toxic at these levels.''<ref name=BusbySupp>{{Cite web| last = Busby| first = Chris| title = Calcium and other supplements to protect against internal radiation| date = 2011-11-07| url = http://www.scribd.com/doc/72048273/supplementrept}}</ref>}}
Additionally, Busby alleges the Japanese Government is involved in a conspiracy to spread radioactive contamination throughout Japan, in an effort to hide [[cancer clusters]] from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] and thus hinder [[litigation]] (cancer clusters are typically statistically identified by comparison with an unexposed [[Cohort study|cohort]]).<ref name=BusbyPills/> 

Gerry Thomas, professor of [[molecular pathology]] at the department of surgery and cancer at [[Imperial College, London|Imperial College]], London, condemned the "anti-radiation" pills as useless and described the claims made by Busby as ludicrous. Ohtsura Niwa, professor at the [[Kyoto University]] Radiation Biology Center and CEO of BioMedics Japan, disagreed with Busby's contention that radiation is being deliberately spread throughout Japan. Niwa noted that the ownership of [[dosimeter]]s in Japan is now widespread and if [[radioactive contamination]] was actively spread about, people would know. Niwa also agreed with Thomas, that mineral supplements cannot guard against [[strontium]], [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]]. Similar mineral supplements are widely available in chemists in [[Tokyo]], at 1/8<sup>th</sup> cost offered by Busby Laboratories.<ref name=BusbyPills/><ref name=Monbiot>{{Cite news| last = Monbiot| first = George| title = Christopher Busby's wild claims hurt green movement and Green party| work = The Guardian| accessdate = 2011-11-22| date = 2011-11-22| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/nov/22/christopher-busby-nuclear-green-party| location=London}}</ref> 

Recently, a research team at the Experimental Radio-TOXological Laboratory (LRTOX), France, independently investigated the effects of high level (500 Bqkg<sup>−1</sup>) [[caesium-137]] exposure in animals (heart, testes, blood, cholesterol, immune system, foetus etc.). For example, Guéguen ''et al.'' (2008) investigated the possible cardiac effects of 500 Bqkg<sup>−1</sup> caesium-137 exposure in rats over 3 months. They observed that, while [[caesium-137]] exposure did not cause any damage to heart cells or arrhythmias, results indicated that quite subtle cardiac impairment might worsen in some sensitive individuals over time.<ref name=Guéguen>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s12012-008-9013-3| issn = 1530-7905, 1559-0259| volume = 8| pages = 33–40| last = Guéguen| first = Yann| coauthors = Philippe Lestaevel, Line Grandcolas, Cédric Baudelin, Stéphane Grison, Jean-René Jourdain, Patrick Gourmelon, Maâmar Souidi| title = Chronic Contamination of Rats with 137Cesium Radionuclide: Impact on the Cardiovascular System| journal = Cardiovascular Toxicology| accessdate = 2011-11-25| date = 2008-03-08| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/2t36922625183806/| pmid = 18327657| issue = 1}}</ref> Also, Le Gal ''et al.''

Claiming that a supplement can be of use in the "''cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease''" renders it equivalent to a drug and subject to oversight by the [[U.S.]] [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] (Section 201(g)(1) of the [[Food_and_Drug_Administration#The_1938_Food.2C_Drug.2C_and_Cosmetic_Act|Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]). Specifically, drugs must be demonstrated to work and proven safe. In April 2011, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] sent warning letters to an unrelated company, Premier Micronutrient Corporation of Nashville, Tennessee, [[USA]], who similarly claim that it's "anti-oxidant" supplements are capable of preventing illness caused by radiation (''Bioshield-Radiation<sup>®</sup> R1'' and ''Bioshield Radiation<sup>®</sup> R2''). The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] pointed out there was no scientific data demonstrating the drugs safety or effectiveness in treating radiation exposure.<ref name=FDAWarningLetter>{{Cite web| title = Warning Letters - Premier Micronutrient Corporation 4/28/11| format = WebContent| accessdate = 2011-11-24| url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm253423.htm}}</ref> However, ''Bioshield Radiation<sup>®</sup> R2'' subsequently resumed sale with a legal waver, "''These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
