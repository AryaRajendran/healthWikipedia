'''Post-traumatic epilepsy''' ('''PTE''') is a form of [[epilepsy]] that results from [[brain damage]] caused by [[physical trauma]] to the brain ([[traumatic brain injury]], abbreviated TBI).  A person with PTE suffers repeated [[post-traumatic seizure]]s (PTS, [[seizure]]s that result from TBI) more than a week after the initial injury.<ref name="PagniZenga">

Diagnostic measures include [[electroencephalography]] and brain imaging techniques such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]], but these are not totally reliable.  [[Antiepileptic drug]]s do not prevent the development of PTE after head injury, but may be used to treat the condition if it does occur.  When medication does not work to control the seizures, surgery may be needed.<ref name=PosnerLorenzo/> Modern surgical techniques for PTE have their roots in the 19th&nbsp;century, but [[trepanation]] (cutting a hole in the skull) may have been used for the condition in ancient cultures.<ref name="Bladin01"/>

==Classification==
Seizures may occur after traumatic brain injury; these are known as [[post-traumatic seizure]]s (PTS). However, not everyone who has post-traumatic seizures will continue to have post-traumatic epilepsy, because the latter is a chronic condition. However, the terms PTS and PTE are used interchangeably in medical literature.<ref name="Frey03"/><ref name=Silver05>

}}
</ref>  Seizures due to post-traumatic epilepsy are differentiated from non-epileptic post-traumatic seizures based on their cause and timing after the trauma. 
A person with PTE suffers late seizures, those occurring more than a week after the initial trauma.<ref name="Gupta06"/>  Late seizures are considered to be unprovoked, while early seizures (those occurring within a week of trauma) are thought to result from direct effects of the injury.  A provoked seizure is one that results from an exceptional, nonrecurring cause such as the immediate effects of trauma rather than a defect in the brain; it is not an indication of epilepsy.<ref name="Ayd00">

}}
</ref>  Thus for a diagnosis of PTE, seizures must be unprovoked.  

Disagreement exists about whether to define PTE as the occurrence of one or more late, unprovoked seizures, or whether the condition should only be diagnosed in people with two or more.<ref name="Statler06">

==Causes==
[[Image:PTE bar graph by severity.svg|thumb|Cumulative incidence after 30 years of PTE in head injured individuals<ref name="Annegers98"/>]]
It is not clear why some patients get PTE while others with very similar injuries do not.<ref name="Frey03"/> However, possible risk factors have been identified, including severity and type of injury, presence of early seizures, and genetic factors.

===Genetics===
[[Genetics]] may play a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the [[ApoE-ε4]] allele may be at higher risk for PTE.<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/> The [[haptoglobin]] Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues.<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/> However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS,<ref name="Frey03"/> suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.

;Severity of trauma
The more severe the brain trauma is, the more likely a person is to suffer late PTE.<ref name="IudiceMurri"/> Evidence suggests that mild head injuries do not confer an increased risk of developing PTE, while more severe types do.<ref name=eepilepsy>

}}
</ref> In simple mild TBI, the risk for PTE is about 1.5 times that of the uninjured population.<ref name="Annegers98"/>  By some estimates, as many as half of sufferers of severe brain trauma experience PTE;<ref name="IudiceMurri"/> other estimates place the risk at 5% for all TBI patients and 15–20% for severe TBI.<ref name="OliverosJusteBertol">

}}
</ref>

===Nature of trauma===
The nature of the head trauma also influences the risk of PTE.  People who suffer [[depressed skull fracture]]s, [[penetrating head trauma]], early PTS, and [[Intracerebral hematoma|intracerebral]] and [[subdural haematoma]]s due to the TBI are especially likely to suffer PTE, which occurs in more than 30% of people with any one of these findings.<ref name="IudiceMurri"/> About 50% of patients with penetrating head trauma develop PTE,<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/><ref name=eepilepsy/> and missile injuries and loss of brain volume are associated with an especially high likelihood of developing the condition.<ref name="Beghi04">

}}
</ref>   Injuries that occur in military settings carry higher-than-usual risk for PTE, probably because they more commonly involve penetrating brain injury and brain damage over a more widespread area.<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/>   [[Intracranial hematoma]]s, in which blood accumulates inside the skull, are one of the most important risk factors for PTE.<ref name="pmid9580443">
{{cite journal |author=de la Peña P, Porta-Etessam J |title=Post-traumatic epilepsy |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Revista de Neurologia |volume=26 |issue=150 |pages=256–261 |year=1998 |pmid=9580443 |doi= 
}}
</ref>  Subdural hematoma confers a higher risk of PTE than does epidural hematoma, possibly because it causes more damage to brain tissue.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> Repeated intracranial surgery confers a high risk for late PTE, possibly because people who need more surgery are more likely to have factors associated with worse brain trauma such as large hematomas or [[cerebral edema|cerebral swelling]].<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>  In addition, the chances of developing PTE differ by the location of the brain lesion: brain contusion that occurs on in one or the other of the [[frontal lobe]]s has been found to carry a 20% PTE risk, while a contusion in one of the parietal lobes carries a 19% risk and one in a temporal lobe carries a 16% chance.<ref name="PitkänenA06"/>  When contusions occur in both hemispheres, the risk is 26% for the frontal lobes, 66% for the parietal, and 31% for the temporal.<ref name="PitkänenA06"/>

===Post-traumatic seizures===
The risk that a person will develop PTE is heightened but not 100% if PTS occur.<ref name=eepilepsy/> Because many of the risk factors for both PTE and early PTS are the same, it is unknown whether the occurrence of PTS is a risk factor in and of itself.<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/> However, even independent of other common risk factors, early PTS have been found to increase the risk of PTE to over 25% in most studies.<ref name="Mani06"/> A person who has one late seizure is at even greater risk for having another than one who has early PTS; epilepsy occurs in 80% of people who have a late seizure.<ref name="Herman02"/>  [[Status epilepticus]], a continuous seizure or multiple seizures in rapid succession, is especially strongly correlated with the development of PTE; status seizures occur in 6% of all TBIs but are associated with PTE 42% of the time, and quickly halting a status seizure reduces chances of PTE development.<ref name="PitkänenA06"/>

==Pathophysiology==
For unknown reasons, trauma can cause changes in the brain that lead to epilepsy.<ref name="Garga06"/><ref name="Mazarati06">

}}
</ref>  There are a number of proposed mechanisms by which TBI causes PTE, more than one of which may be present in a given person.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>  In the period between a brain injury and onset of epilepsy, brain cells may  [[synaptogenesis|form new synapses]] and [[axon]]s, undergo [[apoptosis]] or [[necrosis]], and experience altered [[gene expression]].<ref name="Herman02"/> In addition, damage to particularly vulnerable areas of the cortex such as the hippocampus may give rise to PTE.<ref name="Mani06"/>

Blood that gathers in the brain after an injury may damage brain tissue and thereby cause epilepsy.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> Products that result from the breakdown of [[hemoglobin]] from blood may be toxic to brain tissue.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>  The "iron hypothesis" holds that PTE is due to damage by oxygen [[free radical]]s, the formation of which is [[catalyst|catalyzed]] by iron from blood.<ref name="IudiceMurri">

</ref>  The iron from blood also reduces the activity of an [[enzyme]] called [[nitric oxide synthase]], another factor thought to contribute to PTE.<ref name="IudiceMurri"/> 

After TBI, abnormalities exist in the release of [[neurotransmitter]]s, chemicals used by [[brain cell]]s to communicate with each other; these abnormalities may play a role in the development of PTE.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>  TBI may lead to the excessive release of [[glutamate]] and other excitatory neurotransmitters (those that [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|stimulate brain cells]] and increase the likelihood that they will [[action potential|fire]]). This excessive glutamate release can lead to [[excitotoxicity]], damage to brain cells through overactivation of the [[biochemical receptor]]s that bind and respond to excitatory neurotransmitters. Overactivation of  [[glutamate receptor]]s damages neurons; for example it leads to the formation of free radicals.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>  Excitotoxicity is a possible factor in the development of PTE;<ref name="Gupta06">

In addition to chemical changes in cells, structural changes that lead to epilepsy may occur in the brain.<ref name="Garga06"/>  Seizures that occur shortly after TBI can reorganize neural networks and cause seizures to occur repeatedly and spontaneously later on.<ref name="Mani06"/>  The [[Kindling model|kindling hypothesis]] suggests that new neural connections are formed in the brain and cause an increase in excitability.<ref name="IudiceMurri"/>  The word ''kindling'' is a metaphor: the way the brain's response to stimuli increases over repeated exposures is similar to the way small burning twigs can produce a large fire.<ref name="Abel92">{{cite book |chapter=The kindling model of epilepsy |author=Abel MS, McCandless DW |editor=Adams RN, Baker GB, Baker JM, Bateson AN, Boisvert DPJ, Boulton AA, ''et al.'' |title=Neuromethods: Animal Models of Neurological Disease |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=1992 |pages=153&ndash;155 |isbn=0-89603-211-6 }}</ref> This reorganization of neural networks may make them more excitable.<ref name="Mani06"/> Neurons that are in a hyperexcitable state due to trauma may create an epileptic focus in the brain that leads to seizures.<ref name=Silver05/>  In addition, an increase in neurons' excitability may accompany loss of inhibitory neurons that normally serve to reduce the likelihood that other neurons will fire; these changes may also produce PTE.<ref name="Mani06"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Spike-waves.png|thumb|right|EEG shows abnormal activity in some types of seizure disorder, but may or may not display abnormal findings in PTE.]]
To be diagnosed with PTE, a person must have a history of head trauma and no history of seizures prior to the injury.<ref name="Maria">

}}
</ref>  Witnessing a seizure is the most effective way to diagnose PTE.<ref name=Silver05/> Electroencephalography (EEG) is a tool used to diagnose a seizure disorder, but a large portion of people with PTE may not have the abnormal "epileptiform" EEG findings indicative of epilepsy.<ref name=Silver05/>  In one study, about a fifth of people who had normal EEGs three months after an injury later developed PTE.  However, while EEG is not useful for predicting who will develop PTE, it can be useful to localize the epileptic focus, to determine severity, and to predict whether a person will suffer more seizures if they stop taking antiepileptic medications.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is performed in people with PTE, and [[CT scan]]ning can be used to detect brain lesions if MRI is unavailable.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>  However, it is frequently not possible to detect the epileptic focus using [[neuroimaging]].<ref name="Dodson04"/> 

For a diagnosis of PTE, seizures must not be attributable to another obvious cause.<ref name="Mani06">

</ref> Seizures that occur after head injury are not necessarily due to epilepsy or even to the head trauma.<ref name="Frey03"/> Like anyone else, TBI survivors may suffer seizures due to factors including imbalances of fluid or [[electrolyte]]s, epilepsy from other causes, [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (insufficient oxygen), and [[ischemia]] (insufficient blood flow to the brain).<ref name="Frey03"/> Withdrawal from [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] is another potential cause of seizures.<ref name="Barry97">

</ref> Why antiepileptic drugs in clinical trials have failed to stop PTE from developing is not clear, but several explanations have been offered: for example, the drugs may simply not be capable of preventing epilepsy, or the drug trials may have been set up in a way that did not allow a benefit of the drugs to be found (e.g. drugs may have been given too late or in inadequate doses).<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/>  [[Animal experimentation|Animal studies]] have similarly failed to show much protective effect of the most commonly used seizure medications in PTE trials, such as [[phenytoin]] and [[carbamazepine]].<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/>  Antiepileptic drugs are recommended to prevent late seizures only for people in whom PTE has already been diagnosed, not as a preventative measure.<ref name="Beghi03"/>  On the basis of the aforementioned studies, no treatment is widely accepted to prevent the development of epilepsy.<ref name="IudiceMurri"/> However, it has been proposed that a narrow window of about one hour after TBI may exist during which administration of antiepileptics could prevent [[epileptogenesis]] (the development of epilepsy).<ref name=PosnerLorenzo>Posner E, Lorenzo N (October 11, 2006).

</ref> Difficulty locating the seizure focus is seen as a deterrent to surgery.<ref name="Mani06"/> However, for people with [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]] in the mesial [[temporal lobe]] (in the inner aspect of the temporal lobe), who comprise about one third of people with intractable PTE, surgery is likely to have good outcome.<ref name="Mani06"/>  When there are multiple epileptic foci or the focus cannot be localized, and drug therapy is not effective, [[vagus nerve stimulation]] is another option for treating PTE.<ref name="Dodson04"/>

People with PTE have follow-up visits, in which health care providers monitor neurological and neuropsychological function and assess the efficacy and side effects of medications.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>  As with sufferers of other types of epilepsy, PTE sufferers are advised to exercise caution when performing activities for which seizures could be particularly risky, such as rock climbing.<ref name=PosnerLorenzo/>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for epilepsy due to trauma is worse than that for epilepsy of undetermined cause.<ref name=eepilepsy/>  People with PTE are thought to have shorter [[life expectancy|life expectancies]] than people with brain injury who do not suffer from seizures.<ref name=Silver05/> Compared to people with similar structural brain injuries but without PTE, people with PTE take longer to recover from the injury, have more cognitive and motor problems, and perform worse at everyday tasks.<ref name=Silver05/>  This finding may suggest that PTE is an indicator of a more severe brain injury, rather than a complication that itself worsens outcome.<ref name=Silver05/> PTE has also been found to be associated with worse social and functional outcomes but not to worsen patients' rehabilitation or ability to return to work.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> However, people with PTE may have trouble finding employment if they admit to having seizures, especially if their work involves operating heavy machinery.<ref name="Barrow92"/> 

The period of time between an injury and development of epilepsy varies, and it is not uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures.<ref name="Herman02">

</ref> However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10&nbsp;years after moderate TBI and over 20&nbsp;years after severe TBI.<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/> Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.<ref name="Dodson04"/>

The question of how long a person with PTE remains at higher risk for seizures than the general population is controversial.<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/>  About half of PTE cases go into [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], but cases that occur later may have a smaller chance of doing so.<ref name=eepilepsy/>

==Epidemiology==
Studies have found that the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of PTE ranges between 1.9 to more than 30% of TBI sufferers, varying by severity of injury and by the amount of time after TBI for which the studies followed subjects.<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04"/>

Brain trauma is one of the strongest predisposing factors for epilepsy development, and is an especially important factor in young adults.<ref name="PitkänenA06"/>  Young adults, who are at the highest risk for [[head injury]], also have the highest rate of PTE,<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> which is the largest cause of new-onset epilepsy cases in young people.<ref name="Diaz-Arrastia00">

</ref> Children have a lower risk for developing epilepsy; 10% of children with severe TBI and 16–20% of similarly injured adults develop PTE.<ref name="PitkänenA06"/> Being older than 65 is also a predictive factor in the development of epilepsy after brain trauma.<ref name="Herman02"/> One study found PTE to be more common in male TBI survivors than in females.<ref name=Silver05/>

</ref> The surgery involved opening the skull at the site of injury, [[debridement|debriding]] injured tissue, and sometimes draining blood or fluid from under the [[dura mater]].<ref name="Jensen97"/>  Dudley's work was the largest series of its kind that had been done up to that point, and it encouraged other surgeons to use trepanation for post-traumatic seizures.<ref name="Jensen97"/>  His reports on the operations came before it was accepted that surgery to relieve excess pressure within the skull was effective in treating epilepsy, but it helped set the stage for trepanation for PTE to become common practice.<ref name="Jensen97"/>  The procedure became more accepted in the late 19th&nbsp;century once antisepsis was available and [[cerebral localization]] was a familiar concept.<ref name="Jensen97"/>  However in 1890, the prominent German physician [[Ernest von Bergmann]] criticized the procedure; he questioned its efficacy (except in particular circumstances) and suggested that operations had been declared successful too soon after the procedures to know whether they would confer a long-term benefit.<ref name="Bladin01"/>  The late 19th&nbsp;century saw the advent of ''intracranial'' surgery, operating on brain lesions believed to be causing seizures, a step beyond ''cranial'' surgery which involved just the skull and [[meninges]].<ref name="Bladin01"/>  By 1893, at least 42 intracranial operations had been performed for PTE in the US, with limited success.<ref name="Bladin01"/>

Surgery was the standard treatment for PTE until the years following World War II, when the condition received more attention as soldiers who had survived head trauma developed it.<ref name="IudiceMurri"/> The increased need for drugs to treat PTE led to trials with antiepileptics; these early trials suggested that the drugs could prevent epileptogenesis  (the development of epilepsy).<ref name="IudiceMurri"/>  It was still thought that antiepileptic drugs could prevent epileptogeneis in the 1970s;<ref name="Willmore90"/> in 1973, 60% of physicians surveyed used them to prevent PTE.<ref name="Schierhout01"/> However, the clinical trials which had supported a protective effect of antiepileptics were uncontrolled; in later, controlled trials the drugs failed to demonstrate an antiepileptogenic effect.<ref name="Willmore05">

</ref> Studies did show that antiepileptics prevented seizures occurring within a week after injury, and in 1995 the task force of the Brain Trauma Foundation published a recommendation suggesting their use to protect against seizures early after trauma.<ref name="Schierhout01"/>  However, recommendations were published against the prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs more than a week after injury by the Brain Injury Special Interest group of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in 1998 and by the [[American Association of Neurological Surgeons]] in 2000.<ref name=Silver05/>

==Research==
How epilepsy develops after an insult to the brain is not fully understood, and gaining such understanding may help researchers find ways to prevent it, or make it less severe or easier to treat.<ref name="PitkänenA06"/>   Researchers hope to identify biomarkers, biological indications that epileptogenesis is occurring, as a means to find drugs that can target pathways by which epilepsy develops.<ref name="Herman02"/>  For example, drugs could be developed to interfere with [[secondary brain injury]] (injury that does not occur at the moment of trauma but results from processes initiated by it), by blocking pathways such as [[free radical]] damage to brain tissue.<ref name="Dodson04"/>  An increase in understanding of age differences in epilepsy development after trauma may also help researchers find biomarkers of epileptogenesis.<ref name="Herman02"/>  There is also interest in finding more antiepileptic drugs, with the potential to interfere with epileptogenesis.<ref name="Chang03">
