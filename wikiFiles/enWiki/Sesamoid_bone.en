In [[anatomy]], a '''sesamoid bone''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|ɛ|s|əm|ɔɪ|d}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989 as {{IPA|/sεsəmɔɪd/}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sesamoid Entry "sesamoid"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>) is a [[bone]] embedded within a [[tendon]].

Sesamoids are found in locations where a tendon passes over a [[joint]], such as the hand, knee, and foot. Functionally, they act to protect the tendon and to increase its mechanical effect.  The presence of the sesamoid bone holds the tendon slightly farther away from the center of the joint and thus increases its [[Moment (physics)|moment arm]]. Sesamoid bones also prevent the tendon from flattening into the joint as [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] increases and therefore also maintain a more consistent moment arm through a variety of possible tendon loads. This differs from [[Meniscus (anatomy)|menisci]], which are made of [[cartilage]] and rather act to disperse the weight of the body on joints and reduce friction during movement.

==Human anatomy==
Sesamoid bones can be found on joints throughout the body, including:
* In the [[knee]]&nbsp;— the [[patella]] (within the [[quadriceps]] tendon).
* In the [[hand]]&nbsp;— two sesamoid bones are commonly found in the [[Anatomical terms of location#Arms|distal]] portions of the [[first metacarpal bone]] (within the tendons of [[adductor pollicis]] and [[flexor pollicis brevis]]). There is also commonly a sesamoid bone in distal portions of the [[second metacarpal bone]]. 
*  In the wrist - The [[pisiform]] of the [[carpus|wrist]] is a sesamoid bone (within the tendon of [[flexor carpi ulnaris]]).<ref>Tim D. White, ''Human Osteology'', 2nd edition (San Diego: Academic Press, 2000), 199, 205.</ref>
* In the [[foot]] - the [[first metatarsal bone]] usually has two sesamoid bones at its connection to the [[Hallux|big toe]] (both within the tendon of [[flexor hallucis brevis]]).<ref>White, ''Human Osteology'', 2nd edition, 257-261.</ref> In some people, only a single sesamoid is found on the first MTP.

===Injuries and variation===
* A common foot ailment in dancers is [[sesamoiditis]].
* A bi-partite sesamoid bone is when the sesamoids are in 2 separate entities&nbsp;— usually congenital, but may be related to a history of trauma.
* Sesamoid bones have a very limited blood supply. They are very difficult to heal when not treated early and often times lead to Avascular Necrosis which is bone death caused by lack of blood supply. <ref>http://www.footankleinstitute.com/sesamoid-fracture/</ref>

==In other animals==
In [[equine anatomy]], the term sesamoid bone usually refers to the two sesamoid bones found at the back of the [[fetlock]] or metacarpophalangeal/metatarsophalangeal joints in both hindlimbs and [[Equine forelimb anatomy|forelimbs]]. Strictly these should be termed the [[proximal]] sesamoid bones whereas the [[navicular bone]] should be referred to as the [[distal]] sesamoid bone. The patella is also a form of sesamoid bone in the horse.

In both the [[giant panda]]<ref>[http://www.athro.com/evo/pthumb.html Arthro.com: The Panda's Thumb]</ref> and the [[red panda]],<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0504899102v1 Evidence of a false thumb in a fossil carnivore clarifies the evolution of pandas] PNAS December 30, 2005</ref> the radial sesamoid is larger than the same bone in counterparts such as [[bear]]s. It is primarily a bony support for the pad above it, allowing the panda's other digits to grasp [[bamboo]] while eating it.  The panda's thumb is often cited as a classical example of [[exaptation]], where a trait evolved for one purpose is commandeered for another.<ref>[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda's-thumb.html The Panda's Peculiar Thumb], Nature Magazine Vol. LXXXVII No. 9, Nov. 1978, by [[Stephen J. Gould]]</ref>
