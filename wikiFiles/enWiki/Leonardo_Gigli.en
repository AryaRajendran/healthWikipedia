'''Leonardo Gigli''' (30 April 1863, [[Sesto Fiorentino]] &ndash; 4 April 1908, [[Florence]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[surgeon]] and [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] remembered for describing Gigli's operation, and for designing the [[Gigli saw]] to simplify its performance.<ref name="brunori">{{cite journal |last1=Brunori |first1=A. |last2=Bruni |first2=P. |last3=Greco |first3=R. |last4=Giuffré |first4=R. |last5=Chiappetta |first5=F. |title=Celebrating the centennial (1894–1994): Leonardo Gigli and his wire saw. |journal=J.

== Biography ==
Leonardo Gigli was born in a [[villa]] in the town of Sesto Fiorentino on 30 April 1863. He attended school and [[University of Florence|university]] in Florence, graduating in [[medicine]] and [[surgery]] in 1889.<ref name="patellani">{{cite journal |last=Patellani |first=Serafino |year=1908 |month=May |title=Leonardo Gigli |journal=La Ginecologia Moderna |volume=1 |pages=225–230 |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/laginecologiamo00marigoog#page/n268/mode/1up |language=Italian
|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> He initially worked as assistant to the [[professor]] of clinical [[paediatric surgery]], and became assistant in clinical [[obstetrics and gynaecology]] in Florence under Professor Domenico Chiara in November 1889.

When Chiara died in 1891 Gigli left Italy, travelling to [[Paris]] to work under [[Étienne Stéphane Tarnier|Tarnier]], then to [[London]] and [[Wrocław]] where he worked under Professor Henry Fritsch from November 1892 to June 1893. During his time in Wrocław he was also able to attend surgery with [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki|Mikulicz]]; here he first designed the wire saw which was manufactured by the Haertel company. He wrote about the use of this saw, which became known as the Gigli saw, to perform lateral [[symphysiotomy|pubiotomy]] (Gigli's operation) to assist in [[Dystocia|obstructed labour]] in July 1893 and again in October 1894 in the ''Annals of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Milan''.

He returned to Florence in March 1894 to work at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]], and continued as a proponent of the lateral pubiotomy using the wire saw despite lack of support from colleagues in Italy.<ref name="patellani" /> He also described the use of his saw for cutting other bones, excepting the [[human skull|skull]], in 1897; Professor Alfred Obalinski of [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków]] then described its use for [[craniotomy]] in the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aans.org/Media/Article.aspx?ArticleId=17313 |title=Magnum Opus: Gigli's Saw |author=Antonio R. Ribas |date=26 April 2003 |work=American Association of Neurological Surgeons |accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>

In 1899 he became director of the Santa Maria Nuova Hospital. He resigned from this post in 1901 to work in private practice and to concentrate on scientific work, having never received a university appointment. He died at home in Florence on 4 April 1908 of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 44.<ref name="patellani" />

== Legacy ==
Although Gigli's operation, the lateral pubiotomy, is rarely performed today, the Gigli saw is still used to perform [[amputation]]s and cranial flaps,<ref name="brunori" /><ref>{{cite journal|title=Osteoplastic Amputation of the Arm: With the Description of a Useful Saw for Osteoplastic Amputations|last=Meyer|first=Willy|journal=[[Annals of Surgery]]|month=June|year=1901|volume=33|issue=6|pages=709–712|pmc=1425464|pmid=17860982}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D91nlqK81iUC&pg=PA832&dq=gigli+saw+amputation&hl=en&ei=tGmfTpGVFq3UiALj1blp&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=gigli%20saw%20amputation|title=Surgical technology for the surgical technologist: a positive care approach|authors=Paul Price, Kevin B.
