:''For full-body scanners found in airport-security, see [[Full body scanner]].''

A '''full-body scan''' is a scan of the patient's entire body as part of the [[diagnosis]] or treatment of illnesses. If [[computed tomography]] ([[Computed axial tomography|CAT]]) scan technology is used, it is known as a '''full-body CT scan''', though many medical imaging technologies can perform full-body scans.

==Use in preventive screening==

A full-body scan has the potential to identify disease (e.g. [[cancer]]) in early stages, and early identification can improve the success of curative efforts.  Controversy arises from the use of full-body scans in the [[screening (medicine)|screening]] of patients who have no signs or [[symptom]]s suggestive of a disease.<ref name=FDA1>{{cite web| url = http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ct/ctscansbro.html| title = U.S Food and Drug Administration Whole body CT scans, DHHS Publication No: (FDA) 03-0001| accessdate = August 30, 2006| date = | year = 2003| month = March}}</ref> As with any test that screens for disease, the risks of full-body CT scans need to be weighed against the benefit of identifying a treatable disease at an early stage.<ref name=Maclean>{{cite journal | author = MacLean CD | year = 1996 | month = January | title = Principles of cancer screening | journal = Med Clin North Am | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | pmid = 8569290 | doi = 10.1016/S0025-7125(05)70423-5}}</ref>

===Controversy===
====Health risks====

*Compared to most other diagnostic imaging procedures, CT scans result in relatively high [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]]. This exposure may be associated with a very small increase in cancer risk. The question is whether that risk is outweighed by the benefits of diagnosis and therapy<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MedicalX-Rays/ucm115340.htm Full-Body CT Scans - What You Need to Know]. Fda.gov. Retrieved on 2010-09-26.</ref>
====Diagnosis benefits====

* Allows a transparent view of the body. Many possible malignancies are discovered with a full-body scan, but these are almost always benign.<ref name=Brant>{{cite journal | author = Brant-Zawadzki MN | year = 2005 | month = November | title = The role of computed tomography in screening for cancer. | journal = Eur Radiol | volume = 15 Suppl 4 | pages = 52–54|pmid = 16479647 }}</ref><ref name=Berlin>{{cite journal | author = Berlin L | year = 2003 | month = February | title = Potential legal ramifications of whole-body CT screening: taking a pesek into Pandora's box. | journal = AJR Am J Roentgenol | volume = 180 | issue = 2 | pages = 317–322 | pmid = 12540423 }}</ref> These may not be related to any disease, and may be benign growths, [[scar|scar tissue]], or the remnants of previous [[infection]]s. CT scanning for other reasons sometimes identifies these "[[incidentaloma]]s".

====Expense====

These procedures are relatively expensive. Possibly high cost: At a cost of [[United States dollar|US$]]600 to $3000, full-body scans are expensive, and are rarely covered by insurance.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aarp.org/bulletin/yourhealth/a2003-08-01-bodyscan.html?print=yes | title = Behind the Body Scan Craze | author = Meyer M. | accessdate = August 30, 2006| date = | year = 2002| month = October}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/isns/reports/2002/052.html | title = Whole-body Scans More Marketing Than Science, Say Medical Physicists.

This will likely lead employer-sponsored, flexible-spending plans to make the cost of the scans eligible for reimbursement.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://turbotax.intuit.com/support/kb/deductions-and-credits/deductions-and-credits/5214.html | title = Diagnosis? It's Deductible}}</ref>


====False positives====

* Low rate of finding disease.<ref name=Brant/><ref name=Berlin/>
* Confusion regarding "incidentalomas" (see above): It is uncertain how to treat some of them, or if treatment is even necessary.<ref name=Adrenal>{{cite journal |author = Grumbach MM, Biller BM, Braunstein GD, Campbell KK, Carney JA, Godley PA, Harris EL, Lee JK, Oertel YC, Posner MC, Schlechte JA, Wieand HS | year = 2003 | month = March | title = Management of the clinically inapparent adrenal mass ("incidentaloma") | journal = Ann Intern Med. | volume = 138 | issue = 5 | pages = 424–429 | pmid = 12614096}}</ref>
* May not be able to detect colors, unlike for example a [[colonoscopy]].

===Alternatives===

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans are associated without a radiation risk compared to CT scans, and are being evaluated for their use in screening.<ref name=MRI>{{cite journal | author = Lauenstein TC, Semelka RC. | year = 2006 | month = August | title = Emerging techniques: Whole-body screening and staging with MRI. | journal = J Magn Reson Imaging | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–498 | pmid = 16888774 | doi = 10.1002/jmri.20666 }}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
*In the episode "[[Role Model (House episode)|Role Model]]" of the TV show ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' the lead character [[Greg House|Dr. Gregory House]] refers to full-body scans as "useless" because, in his words, "you could probably scan every one of us and find fifty doo-dads that look like cancer". This issue was revisited in a later episode, "[[The Social Contract (House)|The Social Contract]]", where a full-body scan was successfully used to identify a tumor and diagnose [[Doege-Potter syndrome]]. Then in "[[Black Hole (House)|Black Hole]]", House orders a full-body scan over the objections of his team, followed by a different scan on a [[pineal gland]].

*In the ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' episode "[[My Fault (Scrubs)|My Fault]]", [[Bob Kelso|Dr. Kelso]] decides to offer full-body scans at Sacred Heart Hospital, despite the objections of [[Dr. Cox]]. This offer is taken by [[List_of_characters_on_Scrubs#Harvey_Corman|Harvey Corman]], who is an "admittedly [[frugal]] [[hypochondriac]]".
