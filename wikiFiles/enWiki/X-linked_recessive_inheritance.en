[[Image:XlinkRecessive.jpg|right|X-linked recessive inheritance]]
'''X-linked recessive inheritance''' is a mode of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] in which a mutation in a [[gene]] on the [[X chromosome]] causes the phenotype to be expressed (1) in males (who are necessarily [[Zygosity#Hemiygous|hemizygous]] for the gene mutation because they have only one X chromosome) and (2) in females who are [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous]] for the gene mutation (''i.e.'', they have a copy of the gene mutation on each of their two X chromosomes).  

X-linked inheritance means that the gene causing the trait or the disorder is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one [[Y chromosome]]. Carrier females who have only one copy of the [[mutation]] do not usually express the [[phenotype]], although differences in [[X chromosome inactivation]] can lead to varying degrees of clinical expression in carrier females since some cells will express one X [[allele]] and some will express the other.  The current estimate of sequenced X-linked genes is 499 and the total including vaguely defined traits is 983.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/mimstats.html OMIM X-linked Genes]</ref>

Some scholars have suggested discontinuing the terms dominant and recessive when referring to X-linked inheritance due to the multiple mechanisms that can result in the expression of X-linked traits in females, which include cell autonomous expression, skewed X-inactivation, clonal expansion, and somatic mosaicism.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316978</ref>

==Sex Differences In Phenotype/Genotypes and Frequency== 
In humans, ''generally'' "men are affected and women are carriers" for two reasons. The first is the simple statistical fact that if the X-chromosomes is a population that carry a particular X-linked mutation at a frequency of 'f' (for example, 1%) then that will be the frequency that men are likely to express the mutation (since they have only one X), while women will express it at a frequency of f<sup>2</sup> (for example 1% * 1% = 0.01%) since they have two X's and hence two chances to get the normal allele.  Thus, X-linked mutations tend to be rare in women. The second reason for female rarity is that women who ''express'' the mutation must have two X chromosomes that carry the trait and they necessarily got one from their father, who would have also expressed the trait because he only had one X chromosome in the first place.  If the trait lowers the probability of fathering a child or induces the father to only have children with women who aren't carriers (so as not to create daughters who are carriers rather than expressers and then only if no [[genetic screening]] is used) then women become even ''less'' likely to express the trait than the statistical prediction of f<sup>2</sup>.

*'''[[Red-green color blindness]]''', a very common trait in humans and frequently used to explain X-linked disorders.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=303800 OMIM Color Blindness, Deutan Series; CBD]</ref> Between seven and ten percent of men and 0.49% to 1% of women are affected. Its commonness may be explained by its relatively benign nature. It is also known as daltonism.
*'''[[Hemophilia A]]''', a [[coagulation|blood clotting]] disorder caused by a [[mutation]] of the [[Factor VIII]] [[gene]] and leading to a deficiency of Factor VIII. It was once thought to be the "royal disease" found in the descendants of Queen Victoria. This is now known to have been Hemophilia B (see below).<ref>{{cite web |author= Michael Price |title= Case Closed: Famous Royals Suffered From Hemophilia|url= http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/1008/2|work= ScienceNOW Daily News |publisher= AAAS|date= 8 October 2009|accessdate=9 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= Evgeny I.

It is rarer than [[haemophilia A]]. As noted above, it was common among the descendants of Queen Victoria.

* '''[[Becker's muscular dystrophy]]''', a milder form of Duchenne, which causes slowly progressive muscle weakness of the legs and [[pelvis]]. 
* '''[[X-linked ichthyosis]]''', a form of [[ichthyosis]] caused by a [[genetic disorder|hereditary deficiency]] of the [[steroid sulfatase]] (STS) enzyme.
