'''DSM-IV Codes''' are the classification found in the '''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision''', also known as ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]]'', a manual published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) that includes all currently recognized [[mental illness|mental health]] disorders.  The DSM-IV codes are thus used by mental health professionals to describe the features of a given mental disorders and indicate how the disorder can be distinguished from other, similar problems.<ref>Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner (2011)''Psychology'' (2nd Edition), page 552, Worth Publishers</ref>  

The coding system utilized by the DSM-IV is designed to correspond with codes from the [[ICD|International Classification of Diseases]], commonly referred to as the ICD.  Since early versions of the DSM did not correlate with ICD codes and updates of the publications for the ICD and the DSM are not simultaneous, some distinctions in the coding systems may still be present.  For this reason, it is recommended that users of these manuals consult the appropriate reference when accessing diagnostic codes

Note that '''NOS''' is an abbreviation for ''Not Otherwise Specified'', indicating a cluster of symptoms that do not clearly fit in any single diagnostic category. NOS is often a provisional diagnosis pending additional information or testing. 

For an alphabetical list, see [[DSM-IV Codes (alphabetical)]].
