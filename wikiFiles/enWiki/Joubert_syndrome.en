'''Joubert syndrome''' is a rare [[genetic disorder]] that affects the [[cerebellum]], an area of the [[Human brain|brain]] that controls balance and coordination.

==Diagnosis==
The disorder is characterized by absence or underdevelopment of the [[cerebellar vermis]] and a malformed [[brain stem]] (molar tooth sign).<ref name="Brancati, 2010">{{cite journal |author=Brancati F, Dallapiccola B, Valente EM |title=Joubert Syndrome and related disorders |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=5 |issue= |pages=20 |year=2010 |pmid=20615230 |pmc=2913941 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-5-20 |url=}}</ref> The most common features include [[ataxia]] (lack of muscle control), [[hyperpnea]] (abnormal breathing patterns), [[sleep apnea]], abnormal eye and tongue movements, and [[hypotonia]]. Other malformations such as [[polydactyly|extra fingers and toes]], cleft lip or palate, tongue abnormalities, and [[seizure]]s may also occur. There may be mild or moderate retardation. Joubert syndrome is one of the many genetic syndromes associated with syndromic [[retinitis pigmentosa]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.1320430415 | last1 = Saraiva | first1 = JM | last2 = Baraitser | first2 = M | year = 1992 | title = Joubert syndrome: a review | journal = Am. J. Med.

==Treatment==
Treatment for Joubert syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. Infant stimulation and physical, occupational, and speech therapy may benefit some patients. Infants with abnormal breathing patterns should be monitored.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for individuals with Joubert syndrome varies. Some patients have a mild form with minimal motor disability and good mental development, while others may have severe motor disability and moderate mental retardation.

==Genetics==

A number of [[mutation]]s have been identified in individuals with {{PAGENAME}} (JBTS) which allowed for classification of the disorder into subtypes.

==Ciliopathy==

Research has revealed that a number of [[genetic disorder]]s, not previously thought to be related, may indeed be related as to their root cause.  Joubert syndrome is one such disease. It is a member of an [[emergence|emerging]] class of diseases called [[ciliopathy|ciliopathies]].  

The underlying cause of the ciliopathies may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary [[cilia]] structures of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[organelle]]s which are present in many cellular types throughout the [[human]] body.  The cilia defects adversely affect "numerous critical developmental signaling pathways" essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often [[pleiotropic|multi-symptom]] nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases.  

Currently recognized ciliopathies include Joubert syndrome, [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]] (also known as Kartagener Syndrome), [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease]] and [[polycystic liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alstrom syndrome]], [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]] and some forms of [[retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal
