'''Dopamine dysregulation syndrome''' (DDS), sometimes known as '''hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation in Parkinson's disease''', is a dysfunction of the [[reward system]] in subjects with [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) due to a long exposure to [[dopamine]] replacement therapy (DRT). It is characterized by self-control problems such as addiction to medication, [[problem gambling|gambling]], or [[hypersexuality]].<ref name=pmid17988927>{{cite journal |author=Merims D, Giladi N |title=Dopamine dysregulation syndrome, addiction and behavioral changes in Parkinson's disease |journal=Parkinsonism Relat.

==Causes==
Parkinson's disease is a common [[neurology|neurological disorder]] characterized by a degeneration of dopamine [[neuron]]s in the [[substantia nigra]] and a loss of dopamine in the [[putamen]]. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa ([[L-Dopa]]) to patients. L-Dopa is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex.<ref name=pmid15935475>{{cite journal |author=Cools R |title=Dopaminergic modulation of cognitive function-implications for L-DOPA treatment in Parkinson's disease |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1–23 |year=2006 |pmid=15935475 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.03.024}}</ref> Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, [[attention]], and most importantly the [[reward system]].<ref name=pmid15247533>{{cite journal |author=Evans AH, Lees AJ |title=Dopamine dysregulation syndrome in Parkinson's disease |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurol. |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=393–8 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15247533 |doi= 10.1097/01.wco.0000137528.23126.41 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1350-7540&volume=17&issue=4&spage=393}}</ref> In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, [[Substance dependence|addictive]] [[drug]]s stimulate dopamine release.<ref name=pmid15247533/> Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated; the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS.<ref name=pmid15247533/> Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS.<ref name=pmid14505581>{{cite journal |author=Lawrence AD, Evans AH, Lees AJ |title=Compulsive use of dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease: reward systems gone awry? |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=595–604 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14505581 |doi= 10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00529-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474442203005295}}</ref> One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a [[habituation]] to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a destruction of dopaminergic receptors in the [[striatum]] which acts in addition to an impairment in [[executive functions|goal-direction mental functions]] to produce an enhancement of [[sensitization]] to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine [[drug overdose|overdose]].<ref name=pmid15247533/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Punding.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Punding, a possible symptom of DDS, is the repetition of complex motor behaviors such as collecting or arranging objects.]]
[[Image:Slot machine.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A slot machine, commonly used for gambling.]]
The most common symptom is craving for dopaminergic medication. However other behavioral symptoms can appear independently of craving or co-occur with it.<ref name=pmid14505581/> Craving is an intense impulse of the subject to obtain medication even in the absence of symptoms that indicate its intake.<ref name=pmid14505581/> To fulfill this need the person will self-administer extra doses. When self administration is not possible aggressive outbursts or the use of strategies such as symptom simulation or bribery to access additional medication can also appear.<ref name=pmid14505581/>

[[Hypomania]], manifesting with feelings of [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], omnipotence, or grandiosity, are prone to appear in those moments when medication effects are maximum; while [[dysphoria]], characterized by sadness, psychomotor slowing, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] or [[apathy]]; are typical with DRT withdrawal.<ref name=pmid14505581/> Different [[impulse control disorder]]s have been described including [[problem gambling|gambling]], [[oniomania|compulsive shopping]], [[eating disorder]]s and [[hypersexuality]].<ref name= pmid14505581/> Behavioral disturbances; most commonly [[aggression|aggressive]] tendencies are the norm. [[Psychosis]] is also common.<ref name=pmid14505581/> Another possible symptom is [[punding]], repetition of complex motor behaviors such as collecting or arranging objects.<ref name=pmid14505581/>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of the syndrome is clinical since there are no laboratory tests to confirm it. For diagnosis a person with documented responsiveness to medication has to increase medication intake beyond dosage needed to relieve their parkinsonian symptoms in a pathological addiction-like pattern. A current mood disorder ([[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety]], hypomanic state or euphoria), behavioral disorder (excessive gambling, shopping or sexual tendency, aggression, or social isolation) or an altered perception about the effect of medication also have to be present.<ref name=pmid15390130>{{cite journal |author=Pezzella FR, Colosimo C, Vanacore N, et al. |title=Prevalence and clinical features of hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation in Parkinson's disease |journal=Mov.

==Prevention==
The main prevention measure proposed is the prescription of the minimum effective dopamine dose for individuals at risk.<ref name=pmid15247533/> The minimization of the use of short duration formulations of L-Dopa can also prevent the syndrome.<ref name=pmid15247533/>

==Management==
First choice management measure consists in the enforcement of an L-Dopa dosage reduction; usually responding many of the syndrome features to this action.<ref name=pmid15247533/> Cessation of [[dopamine agonist]]s therapy may also be of use.<ref name=pmid18068992>{{cite journal |author=Kimber TE, Thompson PD, Kiley MA |title=Resolution of dopamine dysregulation syndrome following cessation of dopamine agonist therapy in Parkinson's disease |journal=[[J Clin Neurosci]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=205–8 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18068992 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2006.04.019}}</ref> Some behavioral characteristics may respond to [[psychotherapy]]; and [[social support]] is important to control [[risk factor]]s. In some cases [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drugs]] may also be of use in the presence of psychosis, aggression, gambling or hypersexuality.<ref name=pmid15247533/>

==Epidemiology==
DDS is not common among PD patients. Prevalence may be around 4%.<ref name=pmid17988927/><ref name=pmid15390130/> Its prevalence is higher among males with an early onset of the disease.<ref name=pmid14505581/> Previous [[substance abuse]] such as [[alcoholism|heavy drinking]] or drug intake seems to be the main risk factor along with a history of [[affective disorder]].<ref name=pmid14505581/>
