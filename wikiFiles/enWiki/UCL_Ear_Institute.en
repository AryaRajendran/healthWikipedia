The '''UCL Ear Institute''' is an academic department of the Faculty of Brain Sciences of [[University College London|University College London (UCL)]] located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. The Institute is based next to the [[Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital]], the UK's largest ear, nose and throat hospital, on [[Gray's Inn Road]] in the [[Bloomsbury]] district of [[Central London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalfree.org.uk/default.aspx?top_nav_id=3&sel_left_nav=40&tab_id=121|title=Hospital sites: Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital|accessdate=5 September 2010|publisher=Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust }}</ref>

Together with the Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, the Institute constitutes the largest centre for audiological research in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/britains-best-hospitals-a-patients-guide-798352.html| title=Britain's best hospitals: A patients' guide|accessdate=19 November 2010|publisher=The Independent|date=20 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=aboutus>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/about-us|title=About Us|accessdate=5 September 2010|publisher=UCL Ear Institute }}</ref>

==History==
In 2000 an £11 million grant from the [[Wellcome Trust]] was awarded to UCL to fund the creation of a new Centre for Auditory Research bringing together auditory research scientists and clinicians from across the university. The new centre was linked to the long standing Institute of Laryngology and Otology (ILO) and its incorporated School of Audiology.<ref name=aboutus/> In order to provide this cross-faculty, multidisciplinary group with a unifying identity the ILO was disestablished and the UCL Ear Institute created on 1 January 2005. Prof Tony Wright was its first director, followed by Prof David McAlpine from June 2006.<ref name=aboutus/> 

In December 2006 the results of tests carried out at the Institute were published which showed that many children's toys available that Christmas could damage a child's hearing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6162451.stm| title=Christmas toys 'are hearing risk'|accessdate=19 November 2010|publisher=BBC News|date=12 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article751160.ece|title=Ear-splitting presents 'could do permanent damage to children'|accessdate=20 June 2011|publisher=The Times|date=12 December 2006}}</ref> In February 2007 the Widex Noise Report, a major survey of noise levels in 41 English towns and cities authored by Deepak Prasher of the UCL Ear Institute, was published.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1312757.ece|title=Listen up, the traffic noise may damage your health|accessdate=21 June 2011|publisher=The Times|date=2 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Noisiest-Place-In-The-UK-Revealed/Article/200702113566151?chooseNews=stories|title=Noisiest Place In The UK Revealed|accessdate=21 June 2011|publisher=Sky News|date=2 February 2007}}</ref> In July 2008 the UCL Ear Institute participated in an architectural jelly competition, with the sound of the competing structures being recorded in one of the Institute's anechoic chambers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3346191/Sound-of-jelly-wobbling-recorded-for-architects-competition.html| title=Sound of jelly wobbling recorded for architects' competition|accessdate=20 June 2011|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2 July 2008}}</ref>
