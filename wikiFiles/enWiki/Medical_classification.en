'''Medical classification''', or '''medical coding''', is the process of transforming descriptions of medical [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] and [[medical procedure|procedures]] into universal medical code numbers. The diagnoses and procedures are usually taken from a variety of sources within the [[health care]] record, such as the transcription of the physician's notes, laboratory results, radiologic results, and other sources. 

[[Diagnosis codes]] are used to track [[disease]]s and other health conditions, whether they are chronic diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[heart disease]], to contagious diseases such as [[norovirus]], the [[flu]], and [[athlete's foot]].  These diagnosis and procedure codes are used by government health programs, private health insurance companies, workers' compensation carriers and others.

Medical classification systems are used for a variety of applications in [[medicine]], [[public health]] and [[medical informatics]], including:
* statistical analysis of diseases and therapeutic actions
* reimbursement; e.g., based on [[diagnosis-related group]]s
* knowledge-based and [[decision support system]]s
* direct surveillance of epidemic or pandemic outbreaks

== Classification types ==
Many different medical classifications exist, though they occur into two main groupings: ''Statistical classifications'' and ''Nomenclatures''.

A '''statistical classification''' brings together similar clinical concepts and groups them into categories. The number of categories is limited so that the classification does not become too big. An example of this is the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (known as ICD). It groups diseases of the circulatory system into one "chapter" (known as [[ICD-10 Chapter IX: Diseases of the circulatory system|Chapter IX]], covering codes I00–I99). Within this chapter, there is for instance, code I47.1. The code title ([[rubric]]) is Supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are several other clinical concepts that are also classified here. Among them are paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, auricular tachycardia and nodal tachycardia.

Another feature of statistical classifications is the provision of residual categories for "other" and "unspecified" conditions that do not have a specific category in the particular classification.

In a '''[[Medical terminology|nomenclature]]''' there is a separate listing and code for every clinical concept. So, in the previous example, each of the tachycardia listed would have its own code. This makes nomenclatures unwieldy for compiling health statistics.

Types of coding systems specific to health care include:
* [[Diagnosis codes|Diagnostic codes]]
* [[procedure codes|Procedural codes]]
* [[Pharmaceutical codes]]
* [[Topographical codes]]

==WHO Family of International Classifications==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) maintains several internationally endorsed classifications designed to facilitate the comparison of health related data within and across populations and over time as well as the compilation of nationally consistent data.<ref name="WHO-FIC">World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/classifications/en/ Family of International Classifications.]  Accessed 12 July 2011.</ref> This "Family of International Classifications" (FIC) include three main (or reference) classifications on basic parameters of [[health]] prepared by the organization and approved by the [[World Health Assembly]] for international use, as well as a number of derived and related classifications providing additional details. Some of these international standards have been revised and adapted by countries for national use.
