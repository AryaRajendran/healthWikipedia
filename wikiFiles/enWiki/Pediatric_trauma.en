'''Pediatric trauma''' refers to a [[trauma (medicine)|traumatic]] injury that happens to an [[infant]], [[child]] or [[Adolescence|adolescent]]. Because of [[human anatomy|anatomical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] differences between children and [[adult]]s the care and management of this population differs.

==Anatomic and physiologic differences in children==
There are significant anatomical and physiological differences between children and adults. For example, the [[Human_anatomy#Internal_organs_.28by_region.29|internal organs]] are closer in proximity to each other in children than in adults; this places children at higher risk of traumatic injury.<ref name=Dickinson2008>{{cite book|author=Dickinson E, Limmer D, O'Keefe MF, Grant HD, Murray R|title=Emergency Care (11th Edition)|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|year=2008|pages=848–52|isbn=0-13-500524-8}}</ref>

Children present a unique challenge in trauma care because they are so different from adults - anatomically, developmentally, physiologically and emotionally. A study published in early 2006 in the [http://www.jpedsurg.org/ Journal of Pediatric Surgery] concluded that the risk of death for injured children is significantly lower when care is provided in pediatric trauma centers rather than in non-pediatric trauma centers. Yet only about 10% of injured children are treated at pediatric trauma centers. The highest mortality rates occur in children who are treated in rural areas without access trauma centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Petrosyan|first=Mikael|coauthors=Guner, Yigit S.

An important part of managing trauma in children is [[Body weight#Estimation in children|weight estimation]]. A number of methods to estimate weight exist, including the Broselow tape, Leffler formula, and Theron formula.<ref name=So2009>{{cite journal|author=So TY, Farrington E, Absher RK|title=Evaluation of the accuracy of different methods used to estimate weights in the pediatric population|journal=Pediatrics|volume=123|issue=6|pages=e1045–51|year=2009|pmid=19482737|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-1968|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/123/6/e1045|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> Of these three methods, the Broselow tape is the most accurate for weight estimation in children ≤25&nbsp;kg,<ref name=So2009/> while the Theron formula performs better with patients weighing >40&nbsp;kg.<ref name=So2009/>

Due to basic [[geometry]], a child's weight to surface area ratio is lower than an adult's, children more readily lose their body heat through radiation and have a higher risk of becoming [[hypothermia|hypothermic]].<ref name=Peitzman2008/><ref name="powerpoint">{{cite web|url=http://www.oumedicine.com/workfiles/College%20of%20Medicine/AD-Pediatrics/EMSC/Ped%20Trauma-Triage2.ppt|title=Pediatric Trauma And Triage: Overview of the Problem and Necessary Care for Positive Outcomes|work=Jim Morehead|accessdate=2010-11-06|format=powerpoint}}</ref> Smaller body size in children often makes them more prone to [[poly trauma]]tic injury.<ref name="rosen">{{cite book |author=Ron Walls MD; John J.

==Management==
The management of pediatric trauma depends on a knowledge of the physiological, anatomical, and developmental differences in comparison to an adult patient, this requires expertise in this area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Little|first=Wendalyn K.|title=Golden Hour or Golden Opportunity: Early Management of Pediatric Trauma|journal=Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine|date=1 March 2010|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4–9|doi=10.1016/j.cpem.2009.12.005}}</ref> In the pre-hospital setting issues may arise with the treatment of pediatric patients due to a lack of knowledge and resources involved in the treatment of these injuries.<ref name="isbn0-309-04888-5">{{cite book |author=Lohr, Kathleen N.; Durch, Jane |title=Emergency medical services for children: Committee on Pediatric Emergency Medical Services |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-309-04888-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=2137}}</ref> Despite the fact there is only a slight variation in outcomes in adult trauma centers, definitive care is best reached at a pediatric trauma center.<ref name="pmid16410115">{{cite journal |author=Densmore JC, Lim HJ, Oldham KT, Guice KS |title=Outcomes and delivery of care in pediatric injury |journal=[[J.

==Pediatric Trauma Score==
Several classification systems have been developed that use some combination of subjective and objective data in an effort to quantify the severity of trauma. Examples include the [[Injury Severity Score]]<ref name=Baker1974>{{cite journal|author=Baker SP, O'Neill B, Haddon W Jr, Long WB|title=The Injury Severity Score: a method for describing patients with multiple injuries and evaluating emergency care|journal=The Journal of Trauma|volume=14|issue=3|pages=187–96|year=1974|pmid=4814394|url=http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/citation/1974/03000/the_injury_severity_score__a_method_for_describing.1.aspx|accessdate=2010-11-07|doi=10.1097/00005373-197403000-00001}}</ref><ref name=Copes1988>{{cite journal|author=Copes WS, Champion HR, Sacco WJ, Lawnick MM, Keast SL, Bain LW|title=The Injury Severity Score revisited|journal=The Journal of Trauma|volume=28|issue=1|pages=69–77|year=1988|pmid=3123707|doi=10.1097/00005373-198801000-00010|url=http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Citation/1988/01000/The_Injury_Severity_Score_Revisited.10.aspx|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> and a modified version of the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]].<ref name=Teasdale1974>{{cite journal|author=Teasdale G, Jennett B|title=Assessment of coma and impaired consciousness.

Though useful, all of these measures have significant limitations when applied to pediatric patients. For this reason, health care providers often employ classification systems that have been modified or even specifically developed for use in the pediatric population. For example, the [[Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale|Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale]] is a modification of the Glasgow Coma Scale that is useful in patients who have not yet developed language skills.<ref name=BTLS />

Emphasizing the importance of body weight and airway diameter, the Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) was developed to specifically reflect the vulnerability of children to traumatic injury. The minimal score is -6 and the maximum score is +12. There is a linear relationship between the decrease in PTS and the mortality risk (i.e. the lower the PTS, the higher the mortality risk).<ref name="BTLS">{{cite book |author=Campbell, John Creighton |title=Basic trauma life support for paramedics and other advanced providers |publisher=Brady/Prentice Hall Health |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-13-084584-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Mortality is estimated at 9% with a PTS > 8, and at 100% with a PTS ≤ 0.

In most cases the severity of a pediatric trauma injury is determined by the pediatric trauma score<ref name=Peitzman2008/> despite the fact that some research has shown there is no benefit between it and the revised trauma scale.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaufmann CR, Maier RV, Rivara FP, Carrico CJ |title=Evaluation of the Pediatric Trauma Score |journal=JAMA |volume=263 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |year=1990 |month=January |pmid=2293691 |doi= |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/263/1/69?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=pediatric+trauma&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT}}</ref>
