The '''medical effects of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima''' upon humans can be put into the four categories below, with the effects of larger [[thermonuclear weapon]]s producing blast and thermal effects so large that there would be a negligible number of survivors close enough to the [[hypocenter]] who would experience prompt/acute radiation effects, effects, which were observed after the 16 [[kiloton]] yield Hiroshima bomb, due to its relatively low yield:<ref name="remm.nlm.gov">http://www.remm.nlm.gov/RemmMockup_files/radiationlethality.jpg</ref><ref>http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys205/pdf/Nuclear_Warfare_9.pdf page 3. see ''negligible''. Meaning that if you are close enough to get a harmful dose of radiation from a 1 megaton weapons, you are going to die from blast effects alone.</ref>

*Initial stage—the first 1–9 weeks, in which are the greatest number of deaths, with 90% due to [[thermal]] injury and/or blast effects and 10% due to super-lethal [[radiation]] exposure.
*Intermediate stage—from 10–12 weeks. The deaths in this period are from [[ionizing radiation]] in the median lethal range - [[LD50]]
*Late period—lasting from 13–20 weeks. This period has some improvement in survivors' condition.
*Delayed period—from 20+ weeks. Characterized by numerous complications, mostly related to healing of thermal and mechanical injuries, and if the individual was exposed to a few hundred to a thousand [[Millisievert]]s of radiation, it is coupled with infertility, sub-fertility and blood disorders. Furthermore, ionizing radiation above a dose of around 50-100 [[Millisievert]] exposure has been shown to statistically begin increasing ones chance of cancer sometime in their life over the normal unexposed rate of ~25%, in the long term, a heightened rate of cancer, proportional to the dose received, would begin to be observed after ~5+ years, with lesser problems such as eye [[cataract]]s and other more minor effects in other organs and tissue also being observed over the long term.

[[Fallout]] exposure - Depending on if further afield individuals [[Shelter in place]] or evacuate perpendicular to the direction of the wind, and therefore avoid contact with the fallout plume, and stay there for the days and weeks after the nuclear explosion, their exposure to [[fallout]], and therefore their total dose, will vary. With those who do [[shelter in place]], and or evacuate, experiencing a total dose that would be negligible in comparison to someone who just went about their life as normal.<ref>7 hour rule: At 7 hours after detonation the fission product activity will have decreased to about 1/10 (10%) of its amount at 1 hour.
At about 2 days (49 hours-7X7) the activity will have decreased to 1% of the 1-hour value! http://www.falloutradiation.com/johnwayne7</ref><ref>http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys205/pdf/Nuclear_Warfare_9.pdf Nuclear Warfare chapter 9 see page 22</ref>

Staying indoors until after the most hazardous fallout [[isotope]], [[I-131]] decays away to 0.1% of its initial quantity after ten [[half life]]s - which is represented by 80 days in [[I-131]]s case. Would make the difference between likely contracting [[Thyroid cancer]] or escaping completely from this substance depending on the actions of the individual.<ref> The activity of any radionuclide is reduced to less than 1% after 7 half lives.http://www.srp-uk.org/resources/rules-of-thumb-a-practical-hints</ref>

Some scientists estimate that if there were a [[nuclear war]] resulting in 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear explosions on cities, comparable to the construction of [[Hiroshima]] 1945, it could cause significant loss of life in the tens of millions from long term climatic effects alone. The climatology hypothesis is that ''if'' each city [[firestorm]]s, a great deal of soot could be thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, cutting out sunlight for years on end, causing the disruption of food chains, in what is termed a [[Nuclear Winter]] scenario.<ref>Philip Yam.

==Blast effects - the initial stage ==

===Immediate post-attack period===
[[Image:Nukemetal.jpg|thumb|Melted and fused pieces of metal (including coins that were in people's pockets) from the Atomic bombings of Japan, the melting of metal like this occurred during the ensuing fires and [[firestorms]], after the bombs had long since exploded.]]

The main causes of death and disablement in this state are thermal burns and the failure of structures resulting from the blast effect.  Injury from the pressure wave is minimal in contrast because the human body can survive up to 2 bar (30 psi) while most buildings can only withstand a 0.8 bar (12 psi) blast.  Therefore, the fate of humans is closely related to the survival of the buildings around them.<ref name = "Middleton">Middleton, Hugh. "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." The Aftermath (1983): 50-56.</ref>

===Fate within certain peak overpressure===
* over 0.8 bar (12 psi) - 98% dead 2% injured
* 0.3-0.8 bar (5-12 psi) - 50% dead 40% injured 10% safe
* 0.14-0.3 bar (2-5 psi) - 5% dead 45% injured 50% safe<ref name = "Middleton"/>

==Types of radioactive exposure after a nuclear attack==
 [[Image:The patient's skin is burned in a pattern corresponding to the dark portions of a kimono - NARA - 519686.jpg|thumb|Japanese woman(one of the [[Hiroshima Maidens]]) suffering burns from thermal radiation after the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Japan.]]
In a nuclear explosion the human body can be irradiated by at least three processes. The first, and most major, cause of burns is due to [[thermal]] radiation and not caused by [[ionizing]] radiation.

* Thermal [[burn]]s from [[infrared]] heat radiation, these would be the most common burn type experienced by personnel.
* If personnel become in direct contact with [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]], [[Beta burn]]s from shallow ionizing [[beta particle|beta radiation]] will be experienced, the largest particles(visible to the naked eye) in [[Nuclear fallout#Local|local fallout]] would be likely to have very high radioactivity because they would be deposited so soon after detonation; this fraction of the total fallout is called the prompt or local fallout fraction. It is likely that one such particle upon the skin would be able to cause a localized [[beta burn]]. This local fallout, termed ''Bikini snow'' in pacific island weapon tests, was experienced by the crew on the deck of the [[Lucky Dragon]] fishing ship following the explosion of the 15 [[megaton]] ''Shrimp'' device in the [[Castle Bravo]] event. However, these particular decay particles([[beta particle]]s) are very weakly penetrating and have a short range, requiring almost direct contact between fallout and personnel to be harmful.
:''See also [[Nuclear Fallout]]''
* Rarer still would be personnel who experience [[Radiation burn]]s from highly penetrating [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. This would likely cause deep gamma penetration within the body, which would result in uniform whole body irradiation rather than only a surface burn. In cases of whole body gamma irradiation (''c.'' 10 [[Gy]]) due to accidents involving medical product irradiators, some of the human subjects have developed injuries to their skin between the time of irradiation and death.

In the picture above, the normal clothing (a [[Kimono]]) that the woman was wearing attenuated the far reaching [[thermal radiation]], the kimono however would have naturally been unable to attenuate any [[gamma radiation]], if they were close enough to the weapon to have experienced any, and it would be likely that any such penetrating radiation effect would be evenly applied to her entire body. [[Beta burn]]s would be likely all over the body if there was contact with fallout after the explosion, unlike thermal burns which are only ever on one side of the body, as heat radiation [[infrared]] naturally does not penetrate the human body. In addition, the pattern on her clothing has been burnt into the skin by the thermal radiation.  This is because white fabric reflects more visible and [[infrared]] light than dark fabric. As a result, the skin underneath dark fabric is burned more than the skin covered by white clothing.

There is also the risk of internal radiation poisoning by ingestion of fallout particles, if one is in a fallout zone.

==Radiation poisoning==
{{main|acute radiation syndrome}}
'''Radiation poisoning''', also called "'''radiation sickness'''" or a "'''creeping dose'''", is a form of damage to organ tissue due to excessive exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. The term is generally used to refer to acute problems caused by a large dosage of [[radiation]] in a short period, though this also has occurred with long term exposure to low level radiation. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning occur as ionizing radiation interferes with cell division. There are numerous lethal radiation syndromes including [[prodromal]] syndrome, [[bone marrow]] death, [[central nervous system]] death and [[gastrointestinal]] death.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop">Coggle, J.E., Lindop, Patricia J. "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." The Aftermath (1983): 60-71.</ref>

=== Prodromal syndrome ===
In prodromal (initial) syndrome, a dose of 1.5 [[Gray (unit)|gray]] or less is not lethal, but causes gastrointestinal distress such as [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], nausea, fatigue and possibly [[diarrhea]].<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

=== Bone marrow death ===
[[Bone marrow]] death is caused by a dose of radiation between 2 and 10 gray and is characterized by the part of the bone marrow that makes the blood being broken down. Therefore production of [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cells]] and platelets is stopped by division of [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] [[stem cells]] ceasing (4.5 gray kills 95% of stem cells). The loss of [[platelet]]s greatly increases the chance of fatal [[hemorrhage]]. While the lack of white blood cells causes [[septicemia]] infections, the fall in red blood cells is minimal and only causes mild [[anemia]].<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

The exposure to 4.5 gray of penetrating gamma rays has many effects that occur at different times:

In 24 hours:<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>
*[[vomiting]]
*[[diarrhea]]
These will usually abate after 6–7 days.

Within 3–4 weeks there is a period of extreme illness.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>
*severe bloody diarrhea, indicating intestinal disorders causing fluid imbalance
*extensive [[internal bleeding]]
*[[septicemia]] infections

The peak incidence of acute BM death corresponds to the 30 day nadir in blood cell numbers. The number of deaths then falls progressively until it reaches 0 at 60 days after irradiation. The amount of radiation greatly affects the probability of death. For example over the range of 2 to 6 gray the probability of death in untreated adults goes from about 1% to 99%, but these figures are for healthy adults. Therefore results may differ because of the thermal and mechanical injuries and infectious conditions.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

=== Gastrointestinal death ===
Gastrointestinal death is caused by a dose of radiation between 10 and 50 gray. Whole body doses cause damage to [[epithelial cells]] lining the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and this combined with the bone marrow damage is fatal. All symptoms become increasingly severe causing exhaustion and [[emaciation]] in a few days and death within 7–14 days from loss of water and electrolytes.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

The symptoms of gastrointestinal death are:<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>
*gastrointestinal pain
*anorexia
*nausea
*vomiting
*diarrhea

=== Central nervous system death ===
[[Central nervous system]] death is the main cause of death in 24–48 hours among those exposed to 50 gray.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

The symptoms are:<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>
*vomiting
*nausea
*diarrhea
*[[drowsiness]]
*[[lethargy]]
*tremors
*[[delirium]]
*frequent [[seizure]]s
*[[convulsions]]
*[[prostration]]
*[[coma]]
*[[respiratory failure]]
*[[death]]

== Short term effects (6-8 weeks) ==

=== Skin ===
The [[Human skin|skin]] is susceptible to beta-emitting radioactive fallout. The principal site of damage is the [[germinal layer]], and often the initial response is [[erythema]] (reddening) due to [[blood vessel]]s congestion and [[edema]]. Erythema lasting more than 10 days occurs in 50% of people exposed to 5-6 gray.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

Other effects with exposure include:<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>
*2-3 gray—temporary [[hair loss]]
*7 gray—permanent [[epilation]] occurs
*10 gray—itching and flaking occurs
*10-20 gray—weeping [[blister]]ing and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ation will occur

=== Lungs ===
The [[lung]]s are the most radiosensitive organ, and [[radiation pneumonitis]] can occur leading to [[pulmonary insufficiency]] and death (100% after exposure to 50 gray of radiation), in a few months.

Radiation [[pneumonitis]] is characterized by:<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>
*Loss of epithelial cells
*[[Edema]]
*[[Inflammation]]
*Occlusions of airways, air sacs and blood vessels
*[[Fibrosis]]

=== Ovaries ===
A single dose of 1-2 gray will cause temporary damage and suppress [[menstruation]] for periods up to 3 years; a dose of 4 gray will cause permanent sterility.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

=== Testicles===
A dose of 0.1 gray will cause low [[sperm count]] for up to a year; 2.5 gray will cause sterility for 2 to 3 years or more. 4 gray will cause permanent sterility.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

==Long term effects==

===Cataract induction===
The timespan for developing this symptom ranges from 6 months to 30 years to develop but the median time for developing them is 2–3 years.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>
*2 gray of gamma rays cause opacities in a few percent
*6-7 gray can seriously impair vision and cause [[cataracts]]

===Cancer induction===
[[Cancer]] induction is the most significant long term risk of exposure to a nuclear bomb. Approximately 1 out of every 80 people exposed to 1 gray will die from cancer and 1 in 40 people will get cancer. Different types of cancer take different times for them to appear:<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>
*2 years for [[leukemia]] to appear
*20 or more years for [[skin cancer]] or [[lung cancer]]

===[[In utero]] (within the womb) effects on human development===
A 1 [[gray (unit)]] dose of radiation will cause between 0 and 20 extra cases of [[perinatal mortality]], per 1,000 births and 0-20 cases per 1000 births of severe mental sub normality. A 0.05 gray dose will increase death due to cancer 10 fold, from the normal 0.5 per 1000 birth rate to a rate of 5 per 1,000. An antenatal dose of 1 gray in the first trimester causes the lifetime risk of fatal cancer sometime in the child's life to increase from, ~25% in non exposed humans, to 100% in the first trimester 1 gray exposed.<ref name = "Coggle & Lindop"/>

===Transgenerational genetic damage===
Exposure to even relatively low doses of radiation generates genetic damage in the progeny of irradiated rodents. This damage can accumulate over several generations.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16215755</ref>
In humans however, [[Microcephaly]] is the only proven malformation, or congenital abnormality, found in the [[in Utero]] developing Human fetuses present during the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.<ref name="books.google.ie">[http://books.google.ie/books?id=DykKlVU0V-oC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=microcephaly+hiroshima&source=bl&ots=eqT78xHiCX&sig=9bckWb7x6IsnUC6lhvsa_QTfZ04&hl=en&ei=OGtqTsG9NYTX8gOL3cwk&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=microcephaly%20hiroshima&f=false Teratology in the Twentieth Century Plus Ten]</ref>
No statistically demonstrable increase of congenital malformations was found among the ''later conceived children born'' to [[Hibakusha|survivors of the Nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].<ref name="books.google.ie"/><ref>http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/268/5/661.short</ref><ref>http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v88/n3/full/6600748a.html</ref>
The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities than the Japanese average.<ref>http://www.rerf.jp/radefx/genetics_e/birthdef.html</ref><ref>http://www.eenews.net/public/Greenwire/2011/04/11/1</ref>

===Infectious diseases resulting from nuclear attack===
It was assumed in the 1983 book "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." that although not caused by radiation, one of the long term effects of a nuclear war would be a massive increase in [[infectious disease]]s caused by [[fecal matter]] contaminated water from untreated [[sewage]], crowded living conditions, poor standard of living, and lack of [[vaccine]]s in the aftermath of a [[nuclear war]], with the following list of diseases being cited:<ref name = "Middleton"/>
*[[Dysentery]]
*[[Typhoid]]
*[[Infectious hepatitis]]
*[[Salmonellosis]]
*[[Cholera]]
*[[Meningococcal meningitis]]
*[[Tuberculosis]]
*[[Diphtheria]]
*[[Whooping cough]]
*[[Polio]]
*[[Pneumonia]]

However although what the authors describe are conditions already prevalent in many of the world's city [[slum]]s, it is inconceivable why people would try to remain living in crowded conditions by reverting to [[slum]] lifestyles, during or after a nuclear war. As many cities would already be destroyed, with [[urban area|urban]] life, [[slum]] or otherwise, therefore serving no benefit to inhabitants.

There would be billions of [[disease carrier]]s, in the form of city residents,<ref>https://apps.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact122.html</ref> lying deceased in cities caused by the direct nuclear weapons effects alone, with the surviving few billion people spread out in rural communities living [[agrarian]] lifestyles, with the survivors therefore posing a way of living far less prone to creating the crowded [[slum]] living conditions required for infectious diseases to spread. Moreover, as reported in a paper published in the journal Public Health Reports, it is also one of a number of prevalent myths that infectious diseases always occur after a disaster in cities.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2496928/ Disaster Mythology and Fact: Hurricane Katrina and Social Attachment</ref><ref>http://www.publichealthreports.org/issueopen.cfm?articleID=2091</ref> {{Quote|[[Epidemic]]s seldom occur after a disaster, and dead bodies do not lead to catastrophic outbreaks of [[infectious disease]]s. Intuitively, epidemic diseases, illnesses, and injuries might be expected following major disasters. However, as noted by de Goyet, epidemics seldom occur after disasters, and unless deaths are caused by one of a small number of infectious diseases such as smallpox, typhus, or plague, exposure to dead bodies does not cause disease...[[Cholera]] and [[typhoid]] seldom pose a major health threat after disasters unless they are already endemic.}}
