'''Left ventricular hypertrophy''' ('''LVH''') is the thickening of the [[myocardium]] (muscle) of the [[left ventricle]] of the [[heart]].

==Causes==
While [[ventricular hypertrophy]] occurs naturally as a reaction to [[aerobic exercise]] and [[strength training]], it is most frequently referred to as a pathological reaction to [[cardiovascular disease]], or [[high blood pressure]].<ref name="titleAsk the doctor: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy">{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandclinic.org/heartcenter/pub/guide/askdoctor/lvh.htm |title=Ask the doctor: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy |accessdate=2007-12-07 |work=}}</ref>

While LVH itself is not a disease, it is usually a marker for disease involving the heart.<ref name="pmid18030317">{{cite journal |author=Meijs MF, Bots ML, Vonken EJ, ''et al.'' |title=Rationale and design of the SMART Heart study: A prediction model for left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension |journal=Neth Heart J |volume=15 |issue=9 |pages=295–8 |year=2007 |pmid=18030317 |doi= 10.1007/BF03086003|pmc=1995099}}</ref>  Disease processes that can cause LVH include any disease that increases the [[afterload]] that the heart has to contract against, and some primary diseases of the muscle of the heart.

Causes of increased afterload that can cause LVH include [[aortic stenosis]], [[aortic insufficiency]] and [[hypertension]]. Primary disease of the muscle of the heart that cause LVH are known as [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|hypertrophic cardiomyopathies]], which can lead into heart failure.

Long-standing [[mitral insufficiency]] also leads to LVH as a compensatory mechanism.

==Diagnosis==
The principal method to diagnose LVH is [[echocardiography]], by which the thickness of the muscle of the heart can be measured.  The [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) often shows signs of increased voltage from the heart in individuals with LVH, so this is often used as a screening test to determine who should undergo further testing.

===Echocardiography===
Two dimensional echocardiography can produce images of the left ventricle.  The thickness of the left ventricle as visualized on echocardiography correlates with its actual mass.  Normal thickness of the left ventricular myocardium is from 0.6 to 1.1&nbsp;cm (as measured at the very end of [[diastole]].  If the myocardium is more than 1.1&nbsp;cm thick, the diagnosis of LVH can be made.

===ECG criteria for LVH===
There are several sets of criteria used to diagnose LVH via electrocardiography.<ref name="urlLesson VIII - Ventricular Hypertrophy">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/kw/ecg/ecg_outline/Lesson8/index.html#LVH |title=Lesson VIII - Ventricular Hypertrophy |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref>  None of them is perfect, though by using multiple criteria sets, the [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] are increased.

The Cornell criteria for LVH are:
*S in V<sub>3</sub> + R in aVL > 28&nbsp;mm (men)
*S in V<sub>3</sub> + R in aVL > 20&nbsp;mm (women)

Other voltage-based criteria for LVH include:

*Lead I: R wave > 14&nbsp;mm
*Lead aVR: S wave > 15&nbsp;mm
*Lead aVL: R wave > 12&nbsp;mm
*Lead aVF: R wave > 21&nbsp;mm

*Lead V<sub>5</sub>: R wave > 26&nbsp;mm
*Lead V<sub>6</sub>: R wave > 20&nbsp;mm

==Treatment==
The enlargement is not permanent in all cases, and in some cases the growth can regress with the reduction of blood pressure and controlling excitements/emotions strictly.<ref name="pmid16627048">{{cite journal |author=Gradman AH, Alfayoumi F |title=From left ventricular hypertrophy to congestive heart failure: management of hypertensive heart disease |journal=Prog Cardiovasc Dis |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=326–41 |year=2006 |pmid=16627048 |doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2006.02.001}}</ref>

LVH may be a factor in determining treatment or diagnosis for other conditions, because for example, it causes a patient to have an irregular ECG. Patients with LVH may have to participate in more complicated and precise diagnostic procedures, such as imaging, in situations where otherwise a doctor could give advice based on an ECG.<ref name="ASNCfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Nuclear Cardiology |author1-link = American Society of Nuclear Cardiology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Nuclear Cardiology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Nuc_Cardio.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name="2007manage">{{cite doi|10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.185752}}</ref>
