===Medicine===
In 1857 Mitchell was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Lunacy with the newly-established General Board of Lunacy for Scotland. His appointment coincided with a report produced by the Scottish Royal Lunacy Commission that prompted a greater understanding and care of the insane.<ref name="BMJ">{{cite journal|date=October 23, 1909|title=Obituary: Sir Arthur Mitchell|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=2|issue=2547|pages=21261–2|pmc=2321032}}</ref> In 1870 he was appointed to the commission, and also served on the Commission on Criminal Lunacy in England, and later chaired a commission which investigated lunacy care in Ireland.<ref name="BMJ"/>

His work included a special study of individuals in private care, which were outlined in his work ''The Insane in Private Dwellings''. His contributions to the ''Edinburgh Medical Journal'', reprinted in a condensed form in ''Memoirs of the Anthropological Society of London'', contained material collected from extensive surveys.<ref name="BMJ" /> His work established a methodology for [[epidemiological]] studies in this field.<ref name="Smith2010">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=G.

===Historian===
He held positions with the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], the [[Scottish Meteorological Society]], the Early Scottish Text Society, and council member of the [[Scottish History Society]]. He was a professor of ancient history and member of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]. His [[Rhind Lectures]] to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland were published as ''The Past in the Present: What is Civilisation''. His conclusion was that the difference in the essential characteristics of modern and early peoples are imperceptible, that civilisation was due to accumulated knowledge rather than an inherent superiority of its individual members. Other works included ''A List of Travels in Scotland 1296—1900'', and ''Dreaming, Laughing, and Blushing'' (1905).<ref name="BMJ" />

In 1886 Mitchell was made a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Bath]] by [[Queen Victoria]], and was raised to the rank of Knight Commander of the Bath the following year. He retired in 1895, and died on October 12, 1909. He was buried at [[Rosebank Cemetery]], Edinburgh.<ref name="BMJ" />

He married Margaret Hay Houston, daughter of James Houston of Tullochgriban in [[Strathspey, Scotland|Strathspey]]. Their only child was the architect [[Sydney Mitchell]] (1856–1930).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200197|title=Arthur George Sydney Mitchell|work=Dictionary of Scottish Architects}}</ref>
