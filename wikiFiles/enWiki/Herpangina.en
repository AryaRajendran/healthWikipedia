'''Herpangina''', also called mouth [[blister]]s, is the name of a painful mouth [[infection]] caused by [[coxsackievirus]]es.  Usually, herpangina is produced by one particular strain of coxsackie virus A (and the term "herpangina virus" refers to coxsackievirus A)<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000116430|herpangina virus}}</ref> but it can also be caused by coxsackievirus B or [[echovirus]]es.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000048846|herpangina|}}</ref>  Most cases of herpangina occur in the summer,<ref name="Greenberg2005">{{cite book|author=Michael I.

==Presentation==
Though herpangina can be asymptomatic, symptoms usually associated are high [[fever]] and [[sore throat]].

A small number of lesions (usually 2 - 6) form in the back area of the [[mouth]], particularly the [[soft palate]] or [[tonsil|tonsillar pillars]].  The lesions progress initially from red [[macule]]s to [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]] and lastly to [[Oral ulcer|ulcerations]] which can be 2 - 4&nbsp;mm in size.  The lesions heal in 7 â€“ 10 days.

[[Histology|Histologically]], the [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] show signs of intracellular and extracellular [[edema]].

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the Greek ''herp'', creeping, snake like, and Latin ''angina'', a sore throat, literally "a choking."{{cn|date=November 2012}}

==Clinical features==
* Most commonly affects infants and young children
* Typically occurs during the summer
* Typically spreads via the [[fecal-oral route]] or via the [[respiratory droplet transmission|respiratory droplets]].
* Fatigue will last about three to four days after treatment.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include sudden fever with sore throat, headache, loss of appetite, and often neck pain. Within two days of onset an average of four or five (but sometimes up to twenty) 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;2&nbsp;mm diameter grayish lumps form and develop into [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s with red surrounds, and over 24 hours these become shallow ulcers, rarely larger than 5&nbsp;mm diameter, that heal in one to seven days. These lesions most often appear on the tonsillar pillars (adjacent to the [[tonsils]]), but also on the soft palate, tonsils, uvula, or tongue.<Ref name=Merck>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious_diseases/enteroviruses/herpangina.html|publisher=Merck|title=Herpangina}}</ref>

A [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] can be made from clinical signs and symptoms, and treatment consists of minimizing the discomfort of symptoms.<Ref name=Merck/>

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually supportive only,<ref name="urlULCERATIVE LESIONS OF THE ORAL CAVITY">{{cite web |url=http://www.utmb.edu/otoref/grnds/Ulcer-oral-021016/Ulcer-oral-021016.htm |title=ULCERATIVE LESIONS OF THE ORAL CAVITY |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> as the disease is self-limiting and usually runs its course in less than a week.

Drinking cold beverages, especially milk and eating ice cream are recommended. Hot and high acidity beverages are to be avoided.<ref>http://mx.globedia.com/que-es-la-herpangina-</ref>
