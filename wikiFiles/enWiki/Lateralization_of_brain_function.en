{{Image|Cerebral lobes.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram of the human brain.|The human brain is divided into two hemispheres&ndash;left and right. Scientists continue to explore how some cognitive functions tend to be dominated by one side or the other; that is, how they are ''lateralized''.}}
The [[longitudinal fissure]] separates the [[human brain]] into two distinct [[cerebral hemisphere]]s, connected by the [[corpus callosum]]. The hemispheres exhibit strong, but not complete, [[symmetry in biology#bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]] in both structure and function. For example, structurally, the [[lateral sulcus]] generally is longer in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere, and functionally, [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]] are present only in the left hemisphere in greater than 95% of the population.

Broad generalizations are often made in popular psychology about one side ''or'' the other having characteristic labels, such as "logical" for the left side or "creative" for the right. These labels need to be treated carefully; although a lateral dominance is measurable, both hemispheres contribute to both kinds of processes,<ref name="Westen 2006">Westen et al. 2006 "Psychology: Australian and New Zealand edition" John Wiley p.107</ref> and experimental evidence provides little support for correlating the structural differences between the sides with such broadly-defined functional differences.<ref>{{cite PMID|12511860}}</ref>

The extent of any modularity, or specialization of brain function by area, remains under investigation. If a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is either injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the ipsilateral hemisphere or a corresponding region in the contralateral hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age.<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/1032397/us-girl-recovers-after-risky-brain-surgery|title=Girl recovers after half of brain removed|date=March 26, 2010|publisher=9 News|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies.

While some functions ''are'' lateralized, these are only a tendency.  The trend across many individuals may also vary significantly as to how any specific function is implemented. The areas of exploration of this causal or effectual difference of a particular brain function include its gross anatomy, dendritic structure, and neurotransmitter distribution.   The structural and chemical variance of a particular brain function, between the two hemispheres of one brain or between the same hemisphere of two different brains, is still being studied. Short of having undergone a [[hemispherectomy]] (removal of a cerebral hemisphere), no one is a "left-brain only" or "right-brain only" person.<ref>Goswami U (2006), "Neuroscience and education: from research to practice?"

Brain function lateralization is evident in the phenomena of right- or left-handedness and of right or left ear preference{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, but a person's preferred hand is not a clear indication of the location of brain function. Although 95% of [[Right-handedness|right-handed]] people have left-hemisphere dominance for language, 18.8% of [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] people have right-hemisphere dominance for language function. Additionally, 19.8% of the left-handed have bilateral language functions.<ref name="psycho2">Taylor, Insep and Taylor, M. Martin (1990) "Psycholinguistics: Learning and using Language". page 362</ref>  Even within various language functions (e.g., semantics, syntax, [[prosody]]), degree (and even hemisphere) of dominance may differ.<ref>Regarding different languages: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11181457</ref>

==History of research on lateralization==

===Speech and language===

====Broca====
One of the first indications of brain function lateralization resulted from the research of French physician [[Pierre Paul Broca]], in 1861. His research involved the male patient nicknamed "Tan", who suffered a speech deficit ([[aphasia]]); "tan" was one of the few words he could articulate, hence his nickname. In Tan's [[autopsy]], Broca determined he had a syphilitic [[lesion]] in the left cerebral hemisphere. This left [[frontal lobe]] brain area ([[Broca's area]]) is an important speech production region. The motor aspects of speech production deficits caused by damage to Broca’s area are known as [[Expressive aphasia]]. In clinical assessment of this aphasia, it is noted that the patient cannot clearly articulate the language being employed.

====Wernicke====
German physician [[Karl Wernicke]] continued in the vein of Broca's research by studying language deficits unlike expressive aphasia. Wernicke noted that not every deficit was in speech production; some were linguistic. He found that damage to the left [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]], superior [[temporal lobe|temporal]] [[gyrus]] ([[Wernicke's area]]) caused language comprehension deficits rather than speech production deficits, a syndrome known as [[Receptive aphasia]].

====Advance in imaging technique====
These seminal works on hemispheric specialization were done on patients and/or postmortem brains, raising questions about the potential impact of pathology on the research findings.  New methods permit the ''[[in vivo]]'' comparison of the hemispheres in healthy subjects.  Particularly, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) are important because of their high spatial resolution and ability to image subcortical brain structures.

===Movement and sensation===
In the 1940s, American born, [[Montreal]] based [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] [[Wilder Penfield]] and his [[neurologist]] colleague [[Herbert Jasper]] developed a technique of [[cortical stimulation mapping|brain mapping]] to help reduce [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s caused by [[surgery]] to treat [[epilepsy]].  They stimulated [[motor cortex|motor]] and [[somatosensory cortex|somatosensory cortices]] of the brain with small electrical currents to activate discrete brain regions.  They found that stimulation of one hemisphere's motor cortex produces [[muscle]] contraction on the opposite side of the body.  Furthermore, the functional map of the motor and [[Somatosensory system|sensory]] cortices is fairly consistent from person to person; Penfield and Jasper's famous pictures of the motor and sensory [[cortical homunculus|homunculi]] were the result.

===Split-brain patients===
Research by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and [[Roger Wolcott Sperry]] in the 1960s on [[split-brain]] patients led to an even greater understanding of functional laterality. Split-brain patients are patients who have undergone [[corpus callosotomy]] (usually as a treatment for severe epilepsy), a severing of a large part of the [[corpus callosum]]. The corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres of the brain and allows them to communicate. When these connections are cut, the two halves of the brain have a reduced capacity to communicate with each other. This led to many interesting [[behavior]]al phenomena that allowed Gazzaniga and Sperry to study the contributions of each hemisphere to various cognitive and perceptual processes. One of their main findings was that the right hemisphere was capable of rudimentary language processing, but often has no lexical or grammatical abilities.<ref name="Kandel_1">Kandel E, Schwartz J, Jessel T. ''Principles of Neural Science''. 4th ed. p1182. New York: McGraw&ndash;Hill; 2000. ISBN 0-8385-7701-6</ref> Eran Zaidel, however, also studied such patients and found some evidence for the right hemisphere having at least some syntactic ability.

For example: Patients with brain damage from surgery, stroke or infection sometimes develop a syndrome in which they can feel sensations in their hand, but they don't feel responsible for nor able to control its movements. In patients with a corpus callosotomy, [[alien hand syndrome]] most often manifests as uncontrolled but purposeful movements of the nondominant hand.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Handedness and language===

Broca's Area and Wernicke’s Area are linked by a [[white matter]] fiber tract, the [[arcuate fasciculus]] {{Dubious|Talk: Lateralization of brain function#Connection between Broca's and Wiernecke's|date=May 2010}}. This [[axon]]al tract allows the neurons in the two areas to work together in creating vocal language. In more than 95% of right-handed men, and more than 90% of right-handed women, language and speech are subserved by the brain's left hemisphere. In left-handed people, the incidence of left-hemisphere language dominance has been reported as 73%<ref name="Knecht_1">{{cite journal |last=Knecht |first=S. |last2=Dräger |first2=B. |last3=Deppe |first3=M. |last4=Bobe |first4=L. |last5=Lohmann |first5=H. |last6=Flöel |first6=A. |last7=Ringelstein |first7=E. B. |last8=Henningsen |first8=H. |title=Handedness and hemispheric language dominance in healthy humans |journal=Brain |year=2000 |volume=123 |issue=12 |pages=2512&ndash;2518 |doi=10.1093/brain/123.12.2512 }}</ref> and 61%,<ref name="psycho2" /> suggesting left handed people tend to be less lateralized than right-handed people.

===Methods of Study===

There are ways of determining hemispheric dominance in a person. The [[wada test|Wada Test]] introduces an anesthetic to one hemisphere of the brain via one of the two [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]]. Once the hemisphere is anesthetized, a [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] examination is effected to determine dominance for language production, language comprehension, [[verbal memory]], and visual memory functions. Less invasive (sometimes costlier) techniques, such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], also are used to determine hemispheric dominance; usage remains controversial for being experimental.

==Exaggeration of the lateralization concept==
[[Terence Hines]] states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research.<ref name=Hines>{{cite journal |authorlink = Terence Hines |last=Hines |first=Terence |year=1987 |title=Left Brain/Right Brain Mythology and Implications for Management and Training |journal=The Academy  of Management Review |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=600–606 |doi=10.2307/258066 |jstor=258066 }}</ref> For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as [[EMDR]] and [[neurolinguistic programming]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Drenth |first=J.

==Nonhuman brain lateralization==
Specialization of the two hemispheres is general in vertebrates including [[fish]], [[frogs]], [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s with the left hemisphere being specialized to categorize information and control everyday, routine behavior, with the right hemisphere responsible for responses to novel events and behavior in emergencies including the expression of intense emotions. An example of a routine left hemisphere behavior is feeding behavior whereas as a right hemisphere is escape from predators and attacks from conspecifics.<ref>{{Cite pmid|16209828}}</ref>

==Advantages of brain lateralization==
The widespread lateralization of many vertebrate animals indicates an evolutionary advantage associated with the specialization of each hemisphere.<ref name="Halpern 2005">Halpern et al. 2005 "Lateralization of the Vertebrate Brain: Taking the Side of Model Systems" The Journal of Neuroscience.25(45): 10351-10357</ref>  In one experiment, baby chicks were lateralized before hatching by exposing their eggs to light.<ref name="Rogers 1990">Rogers. 1990 "Light Input and the Reversal of Functional Lateralization in the Chicken Brain" Behav Brain Res  38(3): 211-21</ref>  These chicks were set to a task of picking out food from a bed of pebbles.  Neither the lateralized, nor the non-lateralized chicks had a problem with this task, but the lateralized chicks only used the eye on the side of which they were lateralized to pick up the pebbles.  When presented with a second task of watching for a cutout of a predatory hawk, the discrepancy between lateralized and non-lateralized chicks became evident.  Lateralized chicks could pick food out of the pebbles with one eye and one half of the brain<ref name="Deng and Rogers 1997">Deng and Rogers. 1997 "Differential Contributions of the Two Visual Pathways to Functional Lateralization in Chicks" Behav Brain Res 87(2): 173-82</ref> while using the other eye and other half of their brain to monitor the skies for predators.<ref name="Rogers 2000">Rogers. 2000 "Evolution of Hemispheric Specialization: Advantages and Disadvantages" Brain Lang 73(2): 236-53</ref>  Not only could non-lateralized chicks not complete the two tasks simultaneously, but their performance of the single task deteriorated.  This suggests that the evolutionary advantage of lateralization comes from the capacity to perform separate parallel tasks in each hemisphere of the brain.<ref name="Halpern 2005"/>
