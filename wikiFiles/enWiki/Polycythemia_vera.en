'''Polycythemia vera''' ('''PV''', '''PCV''') (also known as '''erythremia''', '''primary polycythemia''' and '''polycythemia rubra vera''')<ref name=britannica.com>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/468448/polycythemia-vera "polycythemia vera." at Encyclopædia Britannica.] 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 21 Sep. 2010</ref> is a [[Myeloproliferative disorders|myeloproliferative]] blood disorder in which the [[bone marrow]] makes too many [[red blood cells]].<ref name=britannica.com/> It may also result in the overproduction of [[white blood cells]] and [[platelets]].  

Most of the health concerns associated with polycythemia vera are caused by the blood being thicker as a result of the increased red blood cells.  It is more common in the elderly and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.  Common signs and symptoms include itching (pruritus), and severe burning pain in the hands or feet that is usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin.  Patients with polycythemia vera are more likely to have gouty arthritis.  Treatment consists primarily of phlebotomy.

==Pathophysiology==
Polycythemia vera (PCV), being a primary [[polycythemia]], is caused by [[neoplastic]] proliferation and maturation of [[erythroid]], [[megakaryocyte|megakaryocytic]] and [[granulocyte|granulocytic]] elements to produce what is referred to as [[panmyelosis]]. In contrast to secondary polycythemias, PCV is associated with a low serum level of the hormone [[erythropoietin]] (EPO). Instead, PCV cells have a mutation in the [[tyrosine kinase]] ([[JAK2]]), which acts in signaling pathways of the EPO-receptor, rendering those cells hypersensitive to EPO.<ref>Kumar, et al.: Robbin's Basic Pathology, 8th edition, Saunders, 2007</ref>

Patients with polycythemia vera are prone to the development of blood clots ([[thrombosis]]). A major thrombotic complication (e.g. [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[stroke]], [[deep venous thrombosis]], or [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]]) may sometimes be the first symptom or indication that a person has polycythemia vera.

Headaches, lack of concentration and fatigue are common symptoms that occur in patients with polycythemia vera as well.

==Diagnosis==
Physical exam findings are non-specific, but may include [[hepatosplenomegaly|enlarged liver or spleen]], [[plethora]], or [[tophus|gouty nodules]]. The diagnosis is often suspected on the basis of laboratory tests. Common findings include an elevated hemoglobin level or [[hematocrit]], reflecting the increased number of red blood cells; the [[platelet count]] or [[white blood cell count]] may also be increased. The [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) is decreased due to an increase in [[zeta potential]]. Because polycythemia vera results from an essential increase in erythrocyte production, patients have a low  [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) level.

In primary polycythemia, there may be 8 to 9 million and occasionally 11 million erythrocytes per cubic millimeter of blood (a normal range for adults is 4-6), and the [[hematocrit]] may be as high as 70 to 80%. In addition, the total blood volume sometimes increases to as much as twice normal. The entire vascular system can become markedly engorged with blood, and circulation times for blood throughout the body can increase up to twice the normal value. The increased numbers of [[erythrocyte]]s can cause the [[viscosity]] of the blood to increase as much as five times normal. Capillaries can become plugged by the very viscous blood, and the flow of blood through the vessels tends to be extremely sluggish.

As a consequence of the above, people with untreated polycythemia vera are at a risk of various [[thrombosis|thrombotic]] events ([[deep venous thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolism]]), [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]], and have a substantial risk of [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]] (hepatic vein thrombosis),<ref name="pmid16827884">{{cite journal |author=Thurmes PJ, Steensma DP |title=Elevated serum erythropoietin levels in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to polycythemia vera: clinical implications for the role of JAK2 mutation analysis |journal=Eur.

Haematol. |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=57–60 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16827884 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00667.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0902-4441&date=2006&volume=77&issue=1&spage=57}}</ref> or [[myelofibrosis]]. The condition is considered chronic; no cure exists. Symptomatic treatment (see below) can normalize the blood count and most patients can live a normal life for years.

The disease appears more common in Jews of European extraction than in most non-Jewish populations. Some familial forms of polycythemia vera are noted, but the mode of inheritance is not clear.

Recently, in 2005, a mutation in the [[JAK2]] kinase (V617F) was found by multiple research groups <ref>{{cite journal | author=Baxter EJ, Scott LM, Campbell PJ, East C, Fourouclas N, Swanton S, Vassiliou GS, Bench AJ, Boyd EM, Curtin N, Scott MA, Erber WN, Green AR | title=Acquired mutation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in human myeloproliferative disorders | journal=Lancet | year=2005 | pages=1054–61 | volume=365 | issue=9464  | pmid=15781101 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71142-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Levine RL, Wadleigh M, Cools J, Ebert BL, Wernig G, Huntly BJ, Boggon TJ, Wlodarska I, Clark JJ, Moore S, Adelsperger J, Koo S, Lee JC, Gabriel S, Mercher T, D'Andrea A, Frohling S, Dohner K, Marynen P, Vandenberghe P, Mesa RA, Tefferi A, Griffin JD, Eck MJ, Sellers WR, Meyerson M, Golub TR, Lee SJ, Gilliland DG | title=Activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis | journal=Cancer Cell | year=2005 | pages=387–97 | volume=7 | issue=4  | pmid=15837627 | doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2005.03.023}}</ref> to be strongly associated with polycythemia vera.  ''JAK2'' is a member of the [[Janus kinase]] family and makes the erythroid precursors hypersensitive to erythropoietin (EPO).  This mutation may be helpful in making a diagnosis or as a target for future therapy.

==Treatment==
Untreated, polycythemia vera can be fatal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic staff|title=Polycythemia vera - MayoClinic.com|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polycythemia-vera/DS00919|work=Polycythemia vera: Definition|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What Is Polycythemia Vera?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/poly/|work=What Is Polycythemia Vera?|publisher=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> Research has found that the "1.5-3 years of median survival in the absence of therapy has been extended to at least 10-20 years because of new therapeutic tools."<ref>{{cite web|title=Polycythemia Vera Follow-up|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/205114-followup#showall|work=Polycythemia Vera Follow-up|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref>

As the condition cannot be cured, treatment focuses on treating symptoms and reducing thrombotic complications by reducing the erythrocyte levels.

[[Bloodletting]] (called venesection or phlebotomy) is one form of treatment, which often may be combined with other therapies. The removal of blood from the body reduces the blood volume and brings down the hematocrit levels; in patients with polycythemia vera, this reduces the risk of blood clots. Venesection is typically performed in people with polycythemia vera to bring their [[hematocrit]] (red blood cell percentage) down below 45 for men or 42 for women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Streiff MB, Smith B, Spivak JL |title=The diagnosis and management of polycythemia vera in the era since the Polycythemia Vera Study Group: a survey of American Society of Hematology members' practice patterns |journal=Blood |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=1144–9 |year=2002 |pmid=11830459 |doi=10.1182/blood.V99.4.1144}}</ref> It has been observed that phlebotomy also improves cognitive impairment.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10894997 | volume=44 | issue=1 | title=Cognitive impairment in polycythemia vera: partial reversibility upon lowering of the hematocrit | year=2000 | author=Di Pollina L, Mulligan R, Juillerat Van der Linden A, Michel JP, Gold G | journal=Eur. Neurol. | pages=57–9}}</ref>

Low dose [[aspirin]] (75–81&nbsp;mg daily) is often prescribed. Research has shown that aspirin reduces the risk for various thrombotic complications.

[[Chemotherapy]] for polycythemia may be used, either for maintenance, or when the rate of bloodlettings required to maintain normal hematocrit is not acceptable, or when there is significant [[thrombocytosis]] or intractable [[pruritus]]. This is usually with a "cytoreductive agent" ([[hydroxyurea]], also known as [[hydroxycarbamide]]).

The tendency of some practitioners to avoid chemotherapy if possible, especially in young patients, is a result of research indicating possible increased risk of transformation to [[Acute myeloid leukemia|acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)]]. While hydroxyurea is considered safer in this aspect, there is still some debate about its long-term safety.

In the past, injection of radioactive isotopes (principally [[phosphorus-32]]) was used as another means to suppress the bone marrow. Such treatment is now avoided due to a high rate of AML transformation.

Other therapies include [[interferon]] injections, and in cases where secondary [[thrombocytosis]] (high [[platelet]] count) is present, [[anagrelide]] may be prescribed.

[[Bone marrow transplant]]s are rarely undertaken in polycythemia patients; since this condition is non-fatal if treated and monitored, the benefits rarely outweigh the risks involved in such a procedure.

There are indications that with certain genetic markers, [[erlotinib]] may be an additional treatment option for this condition.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li Z, Xu M, Xing S, Ho W, Ishii T, Li Q, Fu X, Zhao Z |title=Erlotinib Effectively Inhibits JAK2V617F Activity and Polycythemia Vera Cell Growth |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=282 |issue=6 |pages=3428–32 |year=2007 |pmid=17178722 |doi=10.1074/jbc.C600277200 |pmc=2096634}}</ref>
