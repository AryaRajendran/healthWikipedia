'''Acne vulgaris''' ('''cystic acne''' or simply '''acne''') is a common [[human skin]] disease, characterized by areas of skin with [[seborrhea]] (scaly red skin), [[Blackhead|comedones]] (blackheads and whiteheads), [[papules]] (pinheads), [[pustules]] ([[pimples]]), [[Nodule (dermatology)|nodules]] (large papules) and possibly scarring.<ref name=Adi2009/> Acne affects mostly skin with the densest population of [[Hair follicle|sebaceous follicles]]; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back. Severe acne is [[inflammation|inflammatory]], but acne can also manifest in noninflammatory forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic2.htm |title=Acne Vulgaris : Article by Julie C Harper |publisher=eMedicine |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}</ref>  The lesions are caused by changes in pilosebaceous units, skin structures consisting of a [[hair follicle]] and its associated [[sebaceous gland]], changes that require [[androgen]] stimulation.

Acne occurs most commonly during [[adolescence]], and often continues into adulthood. In adolescence, acne is usually caused by an increase in [[testosterone]], which accrues during puberty, regardless of [[sex]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=James WD |year=2005 |title=Clinical practice.

Some of the large nodules were previously called "[[cyst]]s" and the term ''nodulocystic'' has been used to describe severe cases of inflammatory acne.<ref name="Thiboutot 2003">{{cite book |author=Thiboutot, Diane M.; Strauss, John S. |year=2003 |chapter=Diseases of the sebaceous glands |editor=Burns, Tony; Breathnach, Stephen; Cox, Neil; Griffiths, Christopher |title=Fitzpatrick's dermatology in general medicine |edition=6th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-138076-0 |pages=672–87}}</ref> The "cysts", or [[boils]] that accompany cystic acne, can appear on the buttocks, groin, and armpit area, and anywhere else where sweat collects in hair follicles and perspiration ducts.<ref>[http://herbs.lovetoknow.com/Boil_Drawing_Salve Boil Drawing Salve], lovetoknow.com</ref> Cystic acne affects deeper skin tissue than does common acne.<ref name="Boils Skin Abscesses">[http://www.medicinenet.com/boils/article.htm Boils (Skin Abscesses)], medicinenet.com</ref>

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Terminology==
The term ''acne'' comes from a mutation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀκμή (''akmē''), literally "point, edge", but in the sense of a "skin eruption"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29kmh%2F ἀκμή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> in the writings of [[Aëtius Amidenus]]. Used by itself, the term "acne" refers to the presence of [[pustule]]s and [[papule]]s.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000001036|acne}}</ref> The most common form of acne is known as acne vulgaris, meaning "common acne". Many teenagers get this type of acne. Use of the term "acne vulgaris" implies the presence of [[comedone]]s.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000001073|acne vulgaris}}</ref>

The term "acne rosacea" is a synonym for [[rosacea]], however some individuals may have almost no acne comedones associated with their rosacea and therefore prefer the term rosacea.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000001067|acne rosacea}}</ref> [[Chloracne]] is associated with exposure to [[polyhalogenated compound]]s.

==Signs and symptoms==
Typical features of acne include: [[seborrhea]] (increased oil-sebum secretion), [[comedones]] (blackheads and whiteheads), [[papules]] (pinheads), [[pustules]] ([[pimples]]), [[nodule (dermatology)|nodule]]s (large papules)  and, possibly scarring.<ref name=Adi2009>{{cite journal |author=Adityan B, Kumari R, Thappa DM |title=Scoring systems in acne vulgaris |journal=Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=323–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19439902 |doi=10.4103/0378-6323.51258 |url=}}</ref>  The appearance of acne varies with skin color.

===Scars===
Acne [[scar]]s are the result of inflammation within the dermis brought on by acne. The scar is created by the wound trying to heal itself resulting in too much [[collagen]] in one spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acne-lasertreatment.net/acne-scars-and-hyperpigmentation/ |title=Acne Scars |publisher=www.acne-lasertreatment.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref>

Physical acne scars are often referred to as "ice pick" scars. This is because the scars tend to cause an indentation in the skin's surface. There is a range of treatments available. Although quite rare, the medical condition [[atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis]] also results in "acne-like" depressed scars on the face.

*''Ice pick scars'': Deep pits, that are the most common and a classic sign of acne scarring.
*''Box car scars'': Angular scars that usually occur on the temple and cheeks, and can be either superficial or deep, these are similar to [[chickenpox]] scars.
*''Rolling scars'': Scars that give the skin a wave-like appearance.
*''Hypertrophic scars'': Thickened, or [[keloid]] scars.

===Pigmentation===
Pigmented scars is a slightly misleading term, as it suggests a change in the skin's pigmentation and that they are true scars; however, neither is true. Pigmented scars are usually the result of nodular or cystic acne (the painful 'bumps' lying under the skin). They often leave behind an inflamed red mark. Often, the pigmentation scars can be avoided simply by avoiding aggravation of the nodule or cyst. Pigmentation scars nearly always fade with time taking between three months to two years to do so, although can last indefinitely if untreated.

==Cause==
Acne develops as a result of blockages in the [[Hair follicle|follicles]]. [[Hyperkeratinization]] and formation of a plug of [[keratin]] and [[sebum]] (a [[Blackhead|microcomedo]]) is the earliest change. Enlargement of sebaceous glands and an increase in sebum production occur with increased [[androgen]] ([[Dehydroepiandrosterone|DHEA-S]]) production at [[adrenarche]]. The microcomedo may enlarge to form an open comedone ([[blackhead]]) or closed comedone (milia). Comedones are the direct result of [[sebaceous gland]]s' becoming clogged with [[sebum]], a naturally occurring oil, and dead skin cells. In these conditions, the naturally occurring largely [[commensal]] bacterium ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'' can cause [[inflammation]], leading to inflammatory lesions ([[papule]]s, infected pustules, or nodules) in the [[dermis]] around the microcomedo or comedone, which results in redness and may result in [[scar]]ring or [[hyperpigmentation]].<ref name="Simpson 2004">{{cite book |author=Simpson, Nicholas B.; Cunliffe, William J. |year=2004 |chapter=Disorders of the sebaceous glands |editor=Burns, Tony; Breathnach, Stephen; Cox, Neil; Griffiths, Christopher |title=Rook's textbook of dermatology |edition=7th |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=0-632-06429-3 |pages=43.1–75}}</ref>

===Hormonal===
Hormonal activity, such as [[menstruation|menstrual cycles]] and [[puberty]], may contribute to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens cause the follicular glands to grow larger and make more sebum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/acne.cfm|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Acne|date=2009-07-16|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Public Health and Science, Office on Women's Health|accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> Use of [[anabolic steroid]]s may have a similar effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Melnik B, Jansen T, Grabbe S |title=Abuse of anabolic-androgenic   steroids and bodybuilding acne: an underestimated health problem |journal=J   Dtsch Dermatol Ges |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=110–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17274777 |doi=10.1111/j.1610-0387.2007.06176.x |month= February|issn=1610-0379}}</ref>
Several [[hormone]]s have been linked to acne: the androgens testosterone, [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) and [[dehydroepiandrosterone|dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] (DHEAS), as well as [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-I).

Development of acne vulgaris in later years is uncommon, although the incidence of rosacea, which may have a similar presentation, is increased in older age groups. True acne vulgaris in adult women may be a feature of an underlying condition such as pregnancy, or disorders such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] and [[Cushing's syndrome]]. Menopause-associated acne (known as acne climacterica) occurs as production of the natural anti-acne ovarian hormones [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]] fail, permitting the acnegenic hormone testosterone to exert its effects unopposed.

===Genetic===

The predisposition for specific individuals to acne is likely explained by a genetic component, which has been supported by [[twin studies]] as well as studies that have looked at rates of acne among first degree relatives.  The genetics of acne susceptibility is likely [[polygenic]], as the disease does not follow classic [[Mendelian inheritance]] pattern.  There are multiple candidates for genes which are possibly related to acne, including [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s in [[TNF-alpha]], [[IL-1 alpha]], [[CYP1A1]] among others.<ref>{{cite PMID|21609898}}</ref>

===Psychological===
While the connection between acne and stress has been debated, scientific research indicates that "increased acne severity" is "significantly associated with increased stress levels."<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archderm.139.7.897 | author = Chiu Annie, Chon Susan Y., Kimball Alexa B. | year = 2003 | title = The Response of Skin Disease to Stress: Changes in the Severity of Acne Vulgaris as Affected by Examination Stress | url = http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/139/7/897 | journal = Archives of Dermatology | volume = 139 | issue = 7| pmid = 12873885 | pages = 897–900 }}</ref> The National Institutes of Health (USA) list stress as a factor that "can cause an acne flare."<ref>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health (January 2006).

===Infectious===
''[[Propionibacterium acnes|Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes)]]'' is the anaerobic bacterium species that is widely concluded to cause acne, though ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' has been universally discovered to play some role since normal pores appear colonized only by ''P. acnes''.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2566126/ |title=Acne is Not Associated with Yet-Uncultured Bacteria |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> Regardless, there are specific clonal sub-strains of ''P. acnes'' associated with normal skin health and others with long-term acne problems.  It is as yet inconclusive whether any of these undesirable strains evolve on-site in the adverse conditions or are all pathogenically acquired, or possibly both depending on the individual patient.  These strains either have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to, the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing activities of acne pores. At least one particularly virulent strain, though, has been circulating around Europe for at least 87 years.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924382/ |title=Population Genetic Analysis of Propionibacterium acnes Identifies a Subpopulation and Epidemic Clones Associated with Acne |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> ''In vitro'', resistance of ''P. acnes'' to commonly used antibiotics has been increasing, as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=9367&nbr=005014&string=Acne+AND+management |title=National Guideline Clearinghouse |publisher=Guideline.gov |date= 11/12/2007 |accessdate= }}</ref>

===Diet===
A high [[glycemic load]] diet is associated with worsening acne.<ref name=Diet2010>{{cite journal |author=Ferdowsian HR, Levin S |title=Does diet really affect acne? |journal=Skin Therapy Lett. |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=1–2, 5 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20361171 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name=Diet2007>{{cite journal |author=Smith RN, Mann NJ, Braue A, Mäkeläinen H, Varigos GA. |title=The effect of a high-protein, low glycemic-load diet versus a conventional, high glycemic-load diet on biochemical parameters associated with acne vulgaris: a randomized, investigator-masked, controlled trial. |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=247–56 |year=2007 |month=August|pmid=17448569|doi= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17448569}}</ref> There is also a positive association between the consumption of milk and a greater rate and severity of acne.<ref name=Diet2010/><ref>BC, Melnik.

[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/acne/DS00169/DSECTION=causes "Acne: Causes = MayoClinic.com"]</ref> Finally, there is evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between acne and insulin metabolism, while a dated study found a correlation between acne and obesity.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.sder.2005.04.002}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
There are multiple scales for grading the severity of acne vulgaris,<ref>[http://www.clinicalevidence.com/ceweb/conditions/skd/1714/1714_background.jsp#outcomes Leeds, Cook's and Pillsbury scales obtained from here]</ref> three of these being:
*Leeds acne grading technique: Counts and categorises lesions into inflammatory and non-inflammatory (ranges from 0–10.0).
*Cook's acne grading scale: Uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the least severe and 8 being the most severe).
*Pillsbury scale: Simply classifies the severity of the acne from 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe).

===Differential===
* [[Keratosis pilaris]]
* [[Rosacea]]
* [[Chloracne]]

==Management==

[[File:Benzoyl peroxide gel.jpg|thumb|Benzoyl peroxide cream.]]

Many different treatments exist for acne including [[benzoyl peroxide]], antibiotics, [[retinoids]], antiseborrheic medications, anti-androgen medications, [[hormone|hormonal]] treatments, [[salicylic acid]], [[alpha hydroxy acid]], [[azelaic acid]], [[nicotinamide]], and keratolytic soaps.<ref name=Nurse09/> They are believed to work in at least 4 different ways, including: normalising shedding into the pore to prevent blockage, killing ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'', anti-inflammatory effects, hormonal manipulation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Medications===
;Benzoyl peroxide
[[Benzoyl peroxide]] is a first-line treatment for mild and moderate acne vulgaris due to its effectiveness and mild side-effects (primarily an irritant [[dermatitis]]). It works against the "P. acnes" bacterium, and normally causes just dryness of the skin, slight redness, and occasional peeling when side effects occur.<ref name=Benz09>{{cite journal |author=Sagransky M, Yentzer BA, Feldman SR |title=Benzoyl peroxide: a review of its current use in the treatment of acne vulgaris |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=10 |issue=15 |pages=2555–62 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19761357 |doi=10.1517/14656560903277228 |url=}}</ref> This topical does increase sensitivity to the sun as indicated on the package, so sunscreen should be used during the treatment to prevent sunburn. Benzoyl peroxide has been found to be nearly as effective as antibiotics with all concentrations 2.5%, 5.0%, and 10% equally effective.<ref name=Benz09/> Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide does not appear to generate bacterial resistance.<ref name=Benz09/>

;Antiseptics
Sometimes benzoyl peroxide topical medication is combined with a salt of [[hydroxyquinoline]], such as potassium hydroxyquinoline sulphate, which has antibacterial properties. One such topical product is available without prescription in the UK.

;Antibiotics
Antibiotics are reserved for more severe cases.<ref name=Benz09/> With increasing resistance of ''P. acnes'' worldwide, they are becoming less effective.<ref name=Benz09/> Commonly used antibiotics, either applied topically or taken orally, include [[erythromycin]], [[clindamycin]], and [[tetracycline]]s such as [[minocycline]].

;Hormones
In females, acne can be improved with [[hormone|hormonal]] treatments. The common combined [[estrogen]]/[[Progestagen|progestogen]] methods of [[hormonal contraception]] have some effect, but the [[antiandrogen]] [[cyproterone]] in combination with an oestrogen (''Diane 35'') is particularly effective at reducing androgenic hormone levels. [[Diane-35]] is not available in the USA, but a newer oral contraceptive containing the progestin [[drospirenone]] is now available with fewer side effects than Diane 35 / Dianette. Both can be used where blood tests show abnormally high levels of [[androgen]]s, but are effective even when this is not the case. Along with this, treatment with low-dose [[spironolactone]] can have anti-androgenetic properties, especially in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome.

;Topical retinoids
[[Topical]] [[retinoids]] are medications that normalize the follicle cell life cycle. This class includes [[tretinoin]] (Retin-A), [[adapalene]] (Differin), and [[tazarotene]] (Tazorac). Like isotretinoin, they are related to [[vitamin A]], but they are administered topically and they generally have much milder side effects. They can, however, cause significant irritation of the skin. The retinoids appear to influence the cell life cycle in the follicle lining. This helps prevent the [[hyperkeratinization]] of these cells that can create a blockage. [[Retinol]], a form of vitamin A, has similar, but milder, effects and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products. Effective topical retinoids have been in use for over 30&nbsp;years, but are available only on prescription, so are not as widely used as the other topical treatments. Topical retinoids often cause an initial flare-up of acne and facial [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]].

;Oral retinoids
A daily oral intake of vitamin A derivative [[isotretinoin]] (marketed as Roaccutane, Accutane, Amnesteem, Sotret, Claravis, Clarus) over a period of 4–6&nbsp;months can cause long-term resolution or reduction of acne. It is believed that isotretinoin works primarily by reducing the secretion of oils from the glands, but some studies suggest that it affects other acne-related factors as well. Isotretinoin has been shown to be very effective in treating severe acne and can either improve or clear well over 80% of patients. The drug has a much longer effect than antibacterial treatments and will often cure acne for good. The treatment requires close medical supervision by a [[dermatologist]] because the drug has many known [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] (many of which can be severe). About 25% of patients relapse after one treatment. In those cases, a second treatment for another 4–6&nbsp;months may be indicated to obtain desired results. It is often recommended that one let a few months pass between the two treatments, because the condition can actually improve somewhat in the time after stopping the treatment and waiting a few months also gives the body a chance to recover. On occasion, a third or even a fourth course is used, but the benefits are often less substantial. The most common side effects are dry skin and occasional nosebleeds (secondary to dry nasal mucosa). Oral retinoids also often cause an initial flare-up of acne within a month or so, which can be severe. There are reports that the drug has damaged the liver of patients. For this reason, it is recommended that patients have blood samples taken and examined before and during treatment. In some cases, treatment is terminated or reduced due to elevated liver enzymes in the blood, which might be related to liver damage. Others claim that the reports of permanent damage to the [[liver]] are unsubstantiated, and routine testing is considered unnecessary by some dermatologists. Blood triglycerides also need to be monitored. However, routine testing is part of the official guidelines for the use of the drug in many countries. Some press reports {{Weasel-inline|date=November 2010}} suggest that isotretinoin may cause [[clinical depression|depression]], but, as of September 2005, there is no agreement in the medical literature as to the risk. The drug also causes birth defects if women become pregnant while taking it or take it while pregnant. For this reason, female patients are required to use two separate forms of [[birth control]] or vow [[abstinence]] while on the drug. Because of this, the drug is supposed to be given to females as a last resort after milder treatments have proven insufficient. Restrictive rules (see [[IPLEDGE|iPledge]] program) for use were put into force in the USA beginning in March 2006 to prevent misuse, causing occasioned widespread editorial comment.<ref name="USnews-Healy">{{cite news | author=Bernadine Healy | title=Pledging for Accutane | date=2005-05-09 | publisher=US News Best Health | url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/articles/050905/5healy.htm}}</ref>

;Anti-inflammatories
[[Nicotinamide]], (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) used topically in the form of a gel, has been shown in a 1995 study to be of comparable efficacy to topical clindamycin used for comparison.<ref name="pmid7657446">{{cite journal |author=Shalita AR, Smith JG, Parish LC, Sofman MS, Chalker DK |title=Topical nicotinamide compared with clindamycin gel in the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris |journal=Int.

It is also purported to result in increased synthesis of collagen, keratin, involucrin and flaggrin. According to a cosmetic company, it may be useful for reducing skin hyperpigmentation (dark acne marks), increasing skin moisture and reducing fine wrinkles.<ref>{{cite web |author=Procter & Gamble |title=Niacinamide Research |url=http://www.pgdermatology.com/images/learning_library/anti_aging/PG-Niancinamide-FINAL-090105.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> 

[[Ibuprofen]] is used in combination with [[tetracycline]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wong RC, Kang S, Heezen JL, Voorhees JJ, Ellis CN |title=Oral ibuprofen and tetracycline for the treatment of acne vulgaris |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1076–81 |year=1984 |month=December |pmid=6239884 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(84)80192-9}}</ref> for some moderate acne cases.

[[Mandelic acid]] has been noted to be an effective topical treatment for mild to moderate acne. It is considered{{by whom|date=December 2012}} to be a gentler alternative to popular alpha hydroxy acids such as [[glycolic acid]] and lactic acid.<ref>Taylor, MB. (1999).

===Procedures===

====Comedo extraction====
Comedones (whiteheads or blackheads) do not improve with standard topical, antibiotic or hormonal therapy.  These small plugs must be physically removed with the use of [[comedo extraction]].  An extractor, which has a metal loop at one end or a spoon with a central hole, is used to place around the comedone and squeeze out its contents with firm pressure to the skin.  This is easiest for blackheads, which already have an opening to the skin surface, however to extract whiteheads a sharp needle is needed to firstly incise the overlying skin before squeezing out the contents of the comedone.  If performed by an experienced professional this technique should not cause scarring.  Following extraction the regular use of a topical retinoid may then prevent a recurrence.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

====Dermabrasion====
[[Dermabrasion]] is a [[Beauty|cosmetic]] medical procedure in which the surface of the [[skin]] is removed by abrasion (sanding).
It is used to remove sun-damaged skin and to remove or lessen [[scar]]s and dark spots on the skin. The procedure is very painful and usually requires a [[general anaesthetic]] or "twilight anaesthesia", in which the patient is still partly conscious.<ref name="Anderson, Laurence 2006">Anderson, Laurence. 2006. ''Looking Good, the Australian guide to skin care, cosmetic medicine and cosmetic surgery''. AMPCo. Sydney.

Dermabrasion is useful for scar removal when the scar is raised above the surrounding skin, but is less effective with sunken scars.

In the past, dermabrasion was done using a small, sterilized, electric sander. In the past decade, it has become more common to use laser dermabrasion using [[carbon dioxide laser|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[Er:YAG laser]] or a combination of both for the treatment of acne scars. Indications for CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment include previous non-erythematous and non-proliferative [[hypertrophic scars]], atrophic acne [[scars]] and burn scars. Laser dermabrasion is much easier to control, much easier to gauge, and is practically bloodless compared to classic dermabrasion.

====Phototherapy====

=====Blue and red light=====
Light exposure has long been used as a short-term treatment for acne. Recently, visible light has been successfully employed to treat mild to moderate acne ([[phototherapy]] or [[deep penetrating light therapy]]) - in particular intense violet light (405–420&nbsp;nm) generated by purpose-built fluorescent lighting, [[dichroic]] bulbs, [[LED]]s or [[lasers]]. Used twice weekly, this has been shown to reduce the number of acne lesions by about 64%<ref name="JDermatolSci-Kawada">{{cite journal | author=Kawada A, Aragane Y, Kameyama H, Sangen Y, Tezuka T | title=Acne phototherapy with a high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source: an open study and ''in vitro'' investigation | journal=J Dermatol Sci | year=2002 | pages=129–35 | volume=30 | issue=2 | pmid=12413768 | doi = 10.1016/S0923-1811(02)00068-3 | month= November| issn=0923-1811}}</ref>
and is even more effective when applied daily. The mechanism appears to be that a [[porphyrin]] (Coproporphyrin III) produced within ''P. acnes'' generates [[free radicals]] when irradiated by 420&nbsp;nm and shorter wavelengths of light.<ref name="ZNaturforsch-Kjeldstad">{{cite journal | author=Kjeldstad B | title=Photoinactivation of Propionibacterium acnes by near-ultraviolet light | journal=Z Naturforsch [C] | year=1984 | pages=300–2 | volume=39 | issue=3–4 | pmid=6730638 | month= March| issn=0341-0382}}</ref>
Particularly when applied over several days, these free radicals ultimately kill the bacteria.<ref name="FEMSImmunolMedMicrobiol-Ashkenazi">{{cite journal | author=Ashkenazi H, Malik Z, Harth Y, Nitzan Y | title=Eradication of Propionibacterium acnes by its endogenic porphyrins after illumination with high intensity blue light | journal=FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol | year=2003 | pages=17–24 | volume=35 | issue=1|pmid=12589953 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-695X.2003.tb00644.x | month= January| issn=0928-8244}}</ref>
Since porphyrins are not otherwise present in skin, and no UV light is employed, it appears to be safe, and has been cleared for marketing by the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].<ref name="FDA-Light">[http://web.archive.org/web/20080117143133/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/2002/602_upd.html "New Light Therapy for Acne"] (archive) U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]], ''[[FDA Consumer]]'', November–December 2002, ([http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/2002/602_upd.html#acne Original URL])</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf/k013623.pdf|title=510(k) Summary: CureLight's ClearLight Phototherapy Device|date=2002-08-16|publisher=FDA, Office of Device Regulation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health|accessdate=2009-07-30|format=PDF}}</ref>

It seems that the treatment works even better if used with a mixture of the violet light and red visible light (660&nbsp;nanometer), resulting in a 76% reduction of lesions after three months of daily treatment for 80% of the patients;<ref name="BrJDerm-Papageorgiou">{{cite journal | author=Papageorgiou P, Katsambas A, Chu A | title=Phototherapy with blue (415&nbsp;nm) and red (660&nbsp;nm) light in the treatment of acne vulgaris | journal=Br J Dermatol | volume=142 | issue=5 | pages=973–8 | year=2000 | pmid=10809858 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2000.03481.x | month=May | issn=0007-0963}}</ref> and overall clearance was similar or better than benzoyl peroxide. Unlike most of the other treatments, few if any negative side-effects are typically experienced, and the development of bacterial resistance to the treatment seems very unlikely. After treatment, clearance can be longer-lived than is typical with topical or oral antibiotic treatments; several months is not uncommon. The equipment or treatment, however, is relatively new and reasonably expensive to buy initially, although the total cost of ownership can be similar to many other treatment methods (such as the total cost of benzoyl peroxide, moisturizer, washes) over a couple of years of use.

=====Photodynamic therapy=====
In addition, basic science and clinical work by dermatologists Yoram Harth and Alan Shalita and others have produced evidence that intense blue/violet light (405–425&nbsp;nanometer) can decrease the number of inflammatory acne lesion by 60–70% in four weeks of therapy, in particular, when the ''P. acnes'' is pretreated with [[delta-aminolevulinic acid]] (ALA), which increases the production of porphyrins. However this [[photodynamic therapy]] is controversial and not published in a peer-reviewed journal. A phase II trial, while it showed improvement occurred, failed to show improved response compared to the blue/violet light alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?NewsEntityId=114055|title=DUSA Pharmaceuticals (DUSA) to Stop Developing Phase 2 Acne Treatment |date=2008-10-23|publisher=Biospace|accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref>

=====Laser treatment=====
[[Laser]] surgery has been in use for some time to reduce the scars left behind by acne,<ref>Brightman L, Chapas A, Geronemus R. "Ablative Fractional Resurfacing of Acne Scars". Lasers Surg Med. 40:381-386. 2008 [http://www.laserskinsurgery.com/Conditions-We-Treat/Acne-Scarring]</ref> but research has been done on lasers for prevention of acne formation itself. The laser is used to produce one of the following effects:
* to burn away the follicle sac from which the hair grows
* to burn away the sebaceous gland, which produces the oil
* to induce formation of [[oxygen]] in the bacteria, killing them

Since lasers and intense pulsed light sources cause thermal damage to the skin, there are concerns that laser or intense pulsed light treatments for acne will induce hyperpigmented macules (spots) or cause long-term dryness of the skin.

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] has approved the use of a cosmetic laser for the treatment of acne. However, efficacy studies have used very small sample sizes for periods of six months or less, and have shown contradictory results.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3808055.stm |title=Health &#124; Doubts over acne laser treatment |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-06-15 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}</ref> Also, laser treatment being relatively new, protocols remain subject to experimentation and revision,<ref>{{cite web|author=By: |url=http://www.dermatologytimes.com/dermatologytimes/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=93752 |title=Manage Account - Modern Medicine |publisher=Dermatologytimes.com |date=2004-03-28 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}</ref> and treatment can be quite expensive. Also, some Smoothbeam laser devices had to be recalled due to coolant failure, which resulted in painful burn injuries to patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/EnforcementReports/2004/ucm120279.htm|title=Enforcement Report|date=2004-01-14|work=Recalls, Market Withdrawals, & Safety Alerts|publisher=FDA|accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref>
