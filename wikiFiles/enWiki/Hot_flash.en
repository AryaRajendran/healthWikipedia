'''Hot flashes''' (also known as '''hot flushes,''' or '''night sweats''' if they happen at night) are a symptom which may have several other causes, but which is often caused by the changing [[hormone]] levels that are characteristic of [[menopause]].<ref>[http://www.betterhealthlibrary.com/Menopause.cfm Women's HealthCare Forum: Menopause<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Causes and mechanism ==
Research on hot flashes is mostly focused on treatment options.  The exact [[etiology]] and [[pathogenesis]], or causes of [[vasomotor]] symptoms (VMS)—the clinical name for hot flashes—has not yet been fully studied.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Utian | first = Wulf H. | title =Recent Developments in Pharmacotherapy for Vasomotor Symptoms | journal =Current Obstetrics and Gynecology Reports | volume =1 | issue =2 | pages =43-49 | publisher = Current Science Inc. | date = 2012-06-01 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/575766r8kxr11rwk/ | issn = 2161-3303 | doi = 10.1007/s13669-012-0009-4 | accessdate = April 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last =Shanafelt | first = Tait D. | last2 = Barton | first2 = Debra L. | last3 = Adjei | first3 = Alex A. | last4 = Loprinzi | first4 = Charles L. | title =Pathophysiology and Treatment of Hot Flashes | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings  | volume = 77 | issue = 11 | pages = 1207 - 1218 | publisher = Elsevier Inc. | date = November 2002 | url = http://www.enotes.us/hotflashes2002.pdf | doi = 10.1016/S0025-6196(11)61811-9 | accessdate = April 19, 2013}}</ref> There is empirical knowledge that hints at reduced levels of estrogen as the primary cause of hot flashes.<ref name="Gannon1985">{{cite book|author=Linda Gannon|title=Menstrual Disorders and Menopause: Biological, Psychological, and Cultural Research|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3slsAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 April 2013|year=1985|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-03-003878-5}}</ref> There are indications that hot flashes may be due to a change in the hypothalamus's control of temperature regulation.

== Presentation ==
Hot flashes, a common symptom of [[menopause]] and [[perimenopause]], are typically experienced as a feeling of intense heat with [[Perspiration|sweating]] and rapid [[Heart rate|heartbeat]], and may typically last from two to thirty minutes for each occurrence. The sensation of heat usually begins in the face or chest, although it may appear elsewhere such as the back of the neck, and it can spread throughout the whole body. Some women feel as if they are going to faint. In addition to being an internal sensation, the surface of the skin, especially on the face, becomes hot to the touch. This is the origin of the alternative term "hot flush", since the sensation of heat is often accompanied by visible reddening of the face. Excessive flushing can lead to [[rosacea]].<ref>[http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/womenshealth/wome3263.html Hot Flashes: Health Topics: University of Iowa Health Care<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The hot-flash event may be repeated a few times each week or every few minutes throughout the day. Hot flashes may begin to appear several years before menopause starts and last for years afterwards. Some women undergoing menopause never have hot flashes. Others have mild or infrequent flashes. The worst sufferers experience dozens of hot flashes each day. In addition, hot flashes are often more frequent and more intense during hot weather or in an overheated room, the surrounding heat apparently making the hot flashes themselves both more probable and more severe.

Severe hot flashes can make it difficult to get a full night's sleep (often characterized as [[insomnia]]), which in turn can affect mood, impair concentration, and cause other physical problems. When hot flashes occur at night, they are called "night sweats". As [[estrogen]] is typically lowest at night, some women get night sweats without having any hot flashes during the daytime.<ref>{{cite web | author = University of Glasgow | authorlink = University of Glasgow | title = Doctors seek the key to understanding hot flushes | work = University News (Archive of news) | publisher = University of Glasgow   | date = 24 October, 2007 | url = http://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2007/october/headline_50212_en.html | accessdate = April 19, 2013}}</ref>

== Types of hot flashes==
Some menopausal women may experience both standard hot flashes and a second type sometimes referred to as "slow hot flashes" or "ember flashes". The standard hot flash comes on rapidly, sometimes reaching maximum intensity in as little as a minute. It lasts at full intensity for only a few minutes before gradually fading.

Slow "ember" flashes appear almost as quickly but are less intense and last for around half an hour. Women who experience them may undergo them year-round, rather than primarily in the summer, and ember flashes may linger for years after the more intense hot flashes have passed.

== In younger women ==
If hot flashes occur at other times in a young woman's menstrual cycle, then it might be a symptom of a problem with her [[pituitary gland]]; seeing a doctor is highly recommended. In younger women who are surgically menopausal, hot flashes are generally more intense than in older women, and they may last until natural age at menopause.<ref>{{Citation | last = About.com | title = Menopause | publisher = About.com | date = n.d. | url =http://adam.about.net/reports/Menopause.htm | accessdate = April 19, 2013}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
=== Hormone replacement therapy ===
[[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|Hormone replacement therapy]] may relieve many of the symptoms of menopause. However, HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke, and dementia and has other potentially serious short-term and long-term risks<ref>{{cite web | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | authorlink = Food and Drug Administration | title = FDA Updates Hormone Therapy Information for Post Menopausal Women | work = FDA News Release (Archived content) | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date = February 10, 2004 | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2004/ucm108243.htm | accessdate = April 19, 2013}}</ref>
The U.S. FDA and women's health advocates recommend {{Where|date=July 2011}} that women who experience troublesome hot flashes try alternatives to hormonal therapies as the first line of treatment. If a woman chooses hormones, they suggest she take the lowest dose that alleviates her symptoms for as short a time as possible.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Selective estrogen receptor modulators ===
[[Selective estrogen receptor modulators|SERMs]] are a category of drugs that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body. [[Tamoxifen]], a drug used in the treatment of some types of [[breast cancer]] and which can cause hot flashes as a side effect, RAD1901, under development by Radius Health,<ref>{{cite web | title = Radius Initiates Phase 2a Clinical Trial of RAD1901 in Menopausal Hot Flashes Radius Initiates Phase 2a Clinical Trial of RAD1901 in Menopausal Hot Flashes | work = PR Newswire | publisher = PR Newswire Association LLC | date = March 24, 2009 | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases-test/radius-initiates-phase-2a-clinical-trial-of-rad1901-in-menopausal-hot-flashes-61919867.html | accessdate = April 20, 2013 }}</ref> [[Raloxifene]] and the soy-derived [[Femarelle (DT56a)]]<ref>{{cite journal

=== Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ===
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]] are a class of antidepressants most commonly used in the treatment of depression, and some personality disorders. They have been found as efficient in alleviating hot flashes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Isoflavones ===
[[Isoflavones]] are commonly found in [[legume]]s such as soy and red clover. The two soy isoflavones implicated in relieving menopausal symptoms are [[genistein]] and [[daidzein]], and are also known as [[phytoestrogens]]. The half life of these molecules is about eight hours, which might explain why some studies have not consistently shown effectiveness of soy products for menopausal symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Although red clover (''Trifolium pratense'') contains isoflavones similar to soy, the effectiveness of this herb for menopausal symptoms at relatively low concentrations points to a different mechanism of action.<ref>Hani P. Nissan, Jian Lu, Nancy L. Booth, Henry I. Yamamura, Norman R. Farnsworth, Z. Jim Wan. A red clover (Trifolium pratense) phase II clinical extract possesses opiate activity. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 2007; 112:207–210</ref>

=== Other phytoestrogens ===
It is believed that dietary changes that include a higher consumption of [[phytoestrogens]] from sources such as soy, red clover, ginseng, and yam may relieve hot flashes.
* [[Ginseng]]: Very few studies exist on the effect of ginseng for relief of menopausal symptoms. In a large double-blinded randomized controlled trial, reduction in hot flashes was not statistically significant but showed a strong trend towards improvement.<ref>Wiklund IK, Mattsson LA, Lindgren R, Limoni C, for the Swedish Alternative Medicine Group. Effects of a standardized ginseng extract on quality of life and physiological parameters in symptomatic post-menopausal women: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Int J Clin Pharmacol Res. 1999;19:89 –99.</ref>
* [[Flaxseed]]: There have also been several clinical trials using flaxseed. Flaxseed is the richest source of [[lignan]]s, which is one of three major classes of  phytoestrogen.<ref>Basch E, Bent S, Collins J, et al. Flax and flaxseed oil (Linum usitatissimum): a review by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration. J Soc Integr Oncol 2007 Summer;5(3):92–105.</ref> Lignans are thought to have estrogen agonist and antagonist effects as well as antioxidant properties. Flaxseed and its lignans may have potent anti-estrogenic effects on estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and may have benefits in breast cancer prevention efforts.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jugenström | first = Malin Bergman | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Lilian U. | last3 = Dabrosin | first3 = Charlotta | title = Flaxseed and Its Lignans Inhibit Estradiol-Induced Growth, Angiogenesis, and Secretion of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in Human Breast Cancer Xenografts ''In vivo'' | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume =13 | issue = 3 | pages =1061-1067 | publisher = American Association for Cancer Research | date = February 1, 2007   | url =http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/13/3/1061.full.pdf+html | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1651 | accessdate = April 20, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Dietary Lignan Intake"> {{cite journal | last = Touillaud | first = Marina S. | last2 = Thiébaut | first2 = Anne C.

There have been a few small pilot studies that have tested the effect of flaxseed on hot flashes. Currently there is a large study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute that is ongoing, but not accepting any new participants.<ref>{{cite web | title = Flaxseed in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Hot Flashes Who Have a History of Breast Cancer or Other Cancer or Who Do Not Wish to Take Estrogen Therapy | work = ClinicalTrials.gov | publisher = U.S. National Institute of Health | date = November 2010 | url = http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00956813#wrapper | accessdate = April 20, 2013}}</ref> The rationale for the study is that estrogen can relieve the symptoms of menopause, but can also cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Flaxseed may reduce the number of hot flashes and improve mood and quality of life in postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy.

=== Lifestyle changes ===
Lifestyle changes may help alleviate hot flashes. These include avoiding caffeine, hot drinks, chocolate, spicy or hot foods and alcohol.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
