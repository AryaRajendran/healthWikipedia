A '''symptom''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''σύμπτωμα'', "accident, misfortune, that which befalls",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2398870 |title=Sumptoma, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, '&#39;A Greek-English Lexicon'&#39;, at Pursues |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref> from ''συμπίπτω'', "I befall", from ''συν-'' "together, with" + ''πίπτω'', "I fall") is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a [[patient]], indicating the presence of [[disease]] or abnormality. A symptom is subjective,<ref>[http://www.uwo.ca/pathol/glossary.html#S Pathology - Glossary]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> observed by the patient,<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?keyword=symptom eMedicine/Stedman Medical Dictionary Lookup!]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> and cannot be measured directly.<ref name="pmid1479160">{{cite journal |author=Devroede G |title=Constipation—a sign of a disease to be treated surgically, or a symptom to be deciphered as nonverbal communication? |journal=[[J. Clin. Gastroenterol.]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=189–91 |year=1992 |pmid=1479160 |doi=10.1097/00004836-199210000-00003}}</ref>  

The term is sometimes also applied to [[Human physiology|physiological]] states outside the context of [[Pathophysiology|disease]], as for example when referring to "symptoms of [[Childbed|pregnancy]]".

==Types==
Symptoms may be [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]], [[Relapse|relapsing]] or [[remission (medicine)|remitting]]. [[Asymptomatic]] conditions also exist (e.g. [[subclinical infection]]s and, sometimes, [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]]).

Constitutional or general symptoms are those that are related to the systemic effects of a disease (e.g., fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss). They affect the entire body rather than a specific organ or location.

The terms "chief complaint", "presenting symptom", "iatrotropic symptom", or "presenting complaint" are used to describe the initial concern which brings a patient to a [[physician|doctor]]. The symptom that ultimately leads to a [[diagnosis]] is called a "cardinal symptom".

'''Non-specific symptoms''' are those self-reported symptoms that do not indicate a specific disease process or involve an isolated body system.  For example, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] is a feature of many acute and chronic medical conditions, whether physical or mental, and may be either a primary or secondary symptom. Fatigue is also a normal, healthy condition when experienced after exertion or at the end of a day.

===Positive and negative symptoms===
In describing [[mental disorder]]s,<ref name = "positive">{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Positive-symptoms.html |title=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders: positive symptom |publisher=Minddisorders.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref><ref name = "negative">http://www.minddisorders.com/Kau-Nu/Negative-symptoms.html Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders: negative symptom</ref> especially [[schizophrenia]], symptoms can be divided into positive and negative symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter2/sec2.html |title=Mental Health: a Report from the Surgeon General |publisher=Surgeongeneral.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref>
* Positive symptoms are symptoms that most individuals do not normally experience but are present in the disorder. It reflects an excess or distortion of normal functions (i.e., experiences and behaviours that have been added to a person’s normal way of functioning.<ref name="Understanding Psychosis Fact Sheet">[http://www.mifa.org.au/sites/www.mifa.org.au/files/documents/164819%20Understanding%20Psychosis.pdf Understanding Psychosis], Mental Health Illness of Australia.</ref> Examples are [[hallucinations]], [[delusions]], and bizarre behavior.<ref name = "positive" />
* Negative symptoms are symptoms that are not present or that are diminished in the affected persons but are normally found in healthy persons. It reflects a diminution or loss of normal functions (i.e., something that has been taken away from a person’s normal way of functioning).<ref name="Understanding Psychosis Fact Sheet" /> Examples are social withdrawal, [[apathy]], [[anhedonia|inability to experience pleasure]] and defects in attention control.<ref name = "negative" />

==Possible causes==
Some symptoms occur in a wide range of disease processes, whereas other symptoms are fairly specific for a narrow range of illnesses. For example, a sudden [[blindness|loss of sight]] in one [[human eye|eye]] has a significantly smaller number of possible causes than [[nausea]] does.

Some symptoms can be misleading to the patient or the medical practitioner caring for them. For example, [[cholecystitis|inflammation of the gallbladder]] often gives rise to pain in the right shoulder, which may understandably lead the patient to attribute the pain to a non-abdominal cause such as muscle [[strain (injury)|strain]].

==Symptom versus sign==
A symptom can more simply be defined as any feature which is noticed by the patient.  A [[medical sign|sign]] is noticed by other people. It is not necessarily the ''nature'' of the sign or symptom which defines it, but ''who'' observes it.

A feature might be a sign or a symptom, or both, depending on the observer(s).  For example, a skin [[rash]] may be noticed by either a healthcare professional as a sign, or by the patient as a symptom.   When it is noticed by both, then the feature is both a sign and a symptom.

Some features, such as pain, can only be symptoms, because they cannot be directly observed by other people. Other features can only be signs, such as a [[complete blood count|blood cell count]] measured in a [[medical laboratory]].
