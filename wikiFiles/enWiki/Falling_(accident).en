[[File:Toddler running and falling.jpg|thumb|Falling is a normal experience for young children, but falling from a significant height or onto a hard surface can be dangerous.]]

'''Falling''' is the second leading cause of [[accidental death]] worldwide and is a major cause of [[personal injury]], especially for the [[old age|elderly]].<ref name="who2012"/> [[Construction worker|Builder]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[miner]]s, and [[Painting|painter]]s are [[Job (role)|occupations]] with high rates of fall injuries. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates (2012) that 424,000 people die in falls every year.<ref name="who2012">{{Cite web |  first = | title = Fact sheet 344: Falls | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs344/en/index.html | publisher = World Health Organization| date = October 2012| accessdate = 3 December 2012}}</ref>

==Falls in the workplace==

In the occupational setting, falling incidents are commonly referred to as slips, trips, and falls (STFs).<ref name=NIOSH_Retail> >{{cite press release |title=Preventing Slips, Trips, and Falls in Wholesale and Retail Trade Establishments |publisher=DHHS (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) Publication No. 2013-100 |date=October 2012 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-100/ |accessdate=2013-01-07}} </ref> Falls from elevation hazards are present at almost every jobsite, and many workers are exposed to these hazards daily. As such, falls are an important topic for [[occupational safety and health]] services. Any walking/working surface could be a potential fall hazard.  An unprotected side or edge which is {{convert|6|ft}} or more above a lower level should be protected from falling by the use of a [[guard rail]] system, safety net system, or personal [[fall arrest]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/falls/ |title=NIOSH Falls from Elevations |accessdate=2007-11-04|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref> These hazardous exposures exist in many forms, and can be as seemingly innocuous as changing a light bulb from a step ladder to something as high-risk as installing bolts on high steel at {{convert|200|ft}} in the air. In 2000, 717 workers died of injuries caused by falls from ladders, scaffolds, buildings, or other elevations.<ref name=NIOSH_Falls> >{{cite press release |title=STRATEGIC PRECAUTIONS AGAINST FATAL FALLS ON THE JOB ARE RECOMMENDED BY NIOSH |publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |date=2001-01-02 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/updates/fatalfal.html |accessdate=2007-11-04}} </ref> More recent data in 2011, found that STFs contributed to 14% of all workplace fatalities in the United States that year.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0010.pdf |format=PDF|title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-07|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor}}</ref>

Companies must make sure that they follow the applicable safety legislation (e.g. the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in the United States) to keep the work environment safe.

===Risk factors===
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has compiled certain known risk factors that have been found responsible for STFs in the workplace setting.<ref name=NIOSH_Retail>{{cite press release |title=Preventing Slips, Trips, and Falls in Wholesale and Retail Trade Establishments |publisher=DHHS (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) Publication No. 2013-100 |date=October 2012 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-100/ |accessdate=2013-01-07}} </ref> While falling can occur at any time and by any means in the workplace, these factors have been known to cause same-level falls, which are less likely to occur than falls to a lower level.<ref name=NIOSH_Retail/>
 
====Workplace factors====
* Spills on walking surfaces
* Ice, snow or rain
* Loose mats or rugs
* Boxes/containers
* Poor lighting
* Uneven walking surfaces

====Work organization factors====
* Fast work pace
* Work tasks involving liquids or greases

====Individual factors====
* Age
* Employee fatigue
* Failing eyesight / use of bifocals
* Inappropriate, loose, or poor-fitting footwear

==Falls from buildings on purpose==
Falls from buildings are often accidental but can also be caused intentionally, such as by [[defenestration]]. Injuries caused by falls from buildings vary depending on the building's height and the age of the person. Falls from the second floor (American; first floor European) usually cause injuries, but are not fatal.

==Height and severity==
The severity of injury increases with the height of the fall, but also depends on body and surface features and the manner of body impacts on to the surface.<ref name=Atanasijevic2004>{{cite pmid|15307311}}</ref> The chance of surviving increases if landing on the surface of high deformity (a surface that bends, moves, or compresses), such as snow or water.<ref name=Atanasijevic2004/>

Overall, the height at which 50% of children die from a fall is between four and five [[storey]] heights above the ground.<ref name=Barlow1983>{{cite pmid|6620098}}</ref>

==Elderly==
{{Main|Falls in older adults}}

In elderly, even falls from standing position to flat ground may cause serious injuries. Stephen Lord at the [[University of New South Wales]] studied 80,000 elderly persons in [[Australia]] and found that the risk of falling increases for any who are taking multiple prescription medications and for all who are taking psychoactive drugs.  This increased risk was demonstrated through the use of a variety of balance and reaction time tests.  Inexplicably, the older men when matched with women of identical height, weight, and age, on average, performed measurably better in all of the balance and reaction time tests. {{Fact|date=December 2007}}
