A '''hangman's fracture''' is the colloquial name given to a fracture of both [[Pedicle of vertebral arch|pedicles]] or ''[[pars interarticularis]]'' of the ''axis vertebra'' ([[C2 vertebra|C2]]) (or,[[Epistropheus]]).

==Epidemiology==
The [[Cervical vertebra 2|C2]] [[fracture]] accounts for nearly 19% of all [[spinal fracture]]s <ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Mulligan | first1 = RP. | last2 = Friedman | first2 = JA. | last3 = Mahabir | first3 = RC. | title = A nationwide review of the associations among cervical spine injuries, head injuries, and facial fractures. | journal = J Trauma | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 587–92 | month = Mar | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1097/TA.0b013e3181b16bc5 | PMID = 19996802 }}</ref> and 55% of cervical fractures.  Within C2 fractures, the hangman’s fracture accounts for 23% of occurrences while the [[Dens (anatomy)|odontoid]] or dens fracture accounts for 55% of them.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ryan | first1 = MD. | last2 = Henderson | first2 = JJ. | title = The epidemiology of fractures and fracture-dislocations of the cervical spine. | journal = Injury | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–40 | month =  | year = 1992 | doi =  | PMID = 1541497 }}</ref>

===Common Causes and High Risk Groups===
[[File:Incidence According to Age Group in the USA during 2010.png|left|thumb|The pie chart shows the incidence of C2 fractures according to age groups. For the <17 age group, there were 203 incidents. For Age 18-44 there were 1843. For 45-64 there were 2147. For 65-84 there were 4890 and for 85+ there were 3440 incidents. A total of 12,532 discharges in [[United States of America|America]] were reported in 2010.]]
The injury mainly occurs from falls usually in older adults and motor accidents mainly due to impacts of high force causing [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the [[neck]] and great axial load onto the C2 [[vertebrae]].<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ryan | first1 = MD. | last2 = Henderson | first2 = JJ. | title = The epidemiology of fractures and fracture-dislocations of the cervical spine. | journal = Injury | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–40 | month =  | year = 1992 | doi =  | PMID = 1541497 }}</ref>
In a study based in [[Norway]], 60% of reported cervical fractures came from falls and 21% from [[Traffic collision|motor related accidents]].<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Pratt | first1 = H. | last2 = Davies | first2 = E. | last3 = King | first3 = L. | title = Traumatic injuries of the c1/c2 complex: computed tomographic imaging appearances. | journal = Curr Probl Diagn Radiol | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–38 | month =  | year =  | doi = 10.1067/j.cpradiol.2007.07.001 | PMID = 18054664 }}</ref>
According to the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ), the group under the highest risk of C2 fractures are elderly people within the age group of 65-84(39.02%) at risks of [[Falling (accident)|falls]] (61%) or motor accidents (21%) in [[metropolitan area]]s (94%).  203 discharges were from the age group 1-17; 1843 from 18-44 year olds; 2147 from 45-64 year olds, 4890 from 65-84 year olds, and 3440 from 85+ year olds.  Females accounted for 54.45% of occurrences while males accounted for the other 45.38%.<ref>http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/</ref>

===Hospital Costs===
[[File:Trend of Hospital Charges and Number of Discharges.png|right|thumb|The graph shows the trend of hospital charges and # of discharges over the span of 12 years in the U.S.A. In 1998, hospital costs were $24,423 with 4,991 discharged. In 2010 hospital charges increased to 59,939 with 12,532 discharged.]]

Statistics from the AHRQ show that there were 12,532 hospital discharges from C2 fractures in the US during 2010. The mean [[healthcare]] costs were $17,015 and the “national bill” or the aggregate charges were $749,553,403.  Only 460 in-hospital deaths related to the C2 fracture occurred.  From 2000 to 2010, the number of discharges has increased from 4,875 to 12,532, almost a 250% increase. Mean [[health care]] costs went from $24,771 to $59,939.<ref>http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/</ref>

==Mechanisms==
The mechanism of the injury is forcible [[Anatomical terms of motion|hyperextension]] of the head, usually with distraction of the neck. Traditionally this would occur during judicial [[hanging]], when the [[Hangman's knot|noose]] was placed below the condemned subject's chin. When the subject was dropped, the head would be forced into hyperextension by the full weight of the body, a sufficient force to cause the fracture. However, despite its long association with judicial hangings, one study of a series of such hangings showed that only a small minority of hangings produced a hangman's fracture.<ref>James R, Nasmyth-Jones R., ''The occurrence of cervical fractures in victims of judicial hanging'', Forensic Science International, 1992 Apr;54(1):81-91.</ref>

Apart from hangings, the mechanism of injury - a sudden forceful hyperextension centered just under the chin - occurs mainly with deceleration injuries in which the victim's face or chin strike an unyielding object with the neck in extension. The most common scenario would be a frontal motor vehicle accident with an unrestrained passenger or driver, with the person striking the dashboard or windshield with their face or chin. Other scenarios would include falls, diving injuries, and collisions between players in contact sports.

Although a hangman's fracture is unstable, survival from this fracture is relatively common, as the fracture itself tends to expand the spinal canal at the C2 level. It is not unusual for patients to walk in for treatment and have such a fracture discovered on X-rays. Only if the force of the injury is severe enough that the vertebral body of C2 is severely subluxed from C3 does the spinal cord become crushed, usually between the vertebral body of C3 and the posterior elements of C1 and C2.

==Hangman’s Fracture Preventions==

===Car Crashes===
[[File:Hangman's fracture.jpg|thumb|Hangman's fracture]]
Most commonly this can occur during a car accident. A person involved in a car crash, especially with no seat belt, can slam their chin against the steering wheel, dashboard or windshield causing the [[hyperextension]] to occur.

===Contact Sports===
[[File:Hangman's Fracture.jpg|thumb|Hangman's Fracture]]
Falling and collisions with other people in a contact sport can also be other ways to this fracture. Falling causes the weight of the body to force hyperextension. Collision with other players in a contact sport can be very dangerous as well, in football diving for the ball could make someone land of their head once again forcing the neck into hyperextension and also the piling of players on top of you just adds more weight which adds more occurrences to this fracture.
There are no particular stretches or exercises to prevent this fracture from happening, but be cautious to your movements. Always wear a seatbelt while driving a vehicle, not only can a Hangman’s Fracture occur but plenty more can happen to you if you choose not to wear a seatbelt while in a vehicle. If you do play contact sports just know what can happen if you dive and land the wrong way. Being cautious is always a great prevention.

==Treatment==

===Non-surgical or Surgical===
Hangman's fractures [[Therapy|treatments]] should be needed such as both non-surgical or [[surgical]] according to Sasso,<ref>Sasso, Rick C. (2001). C2 Dens Fractures: Treatment Options.  Journal of Spinal Disorders. 14(5): 455-463.</ref> a department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Indiana University School of Medicine. Sasso <ref>Sasso, Rick C. (2001). C2 Dens Fractures: Treatment Options.  Journal of Spinal Disorders. 14(5): 455-463.</ref> showed that people who treated non-surgical on all type I - III of Hangman's fracture have a negative disease results with a low percent between 35-85%.

===Benefits of Surgical Hangman's fracture treatment===

Sasso<ref>Sasso, Rick C.(2001). C2 Dens Fractures: Treatment Options.  Journal of Spinal Disorders. 14(5): 455-463.</ref> also studied that people who went on the surgical treatment will not affected by pin site [[infections]],brain [[abscesses]], facet joint [[stiffness]], loss of spinal alignment, and skin break-down. Another studies about the surgical treatment of is the ring of [[axis]]{{dn|date=April 2013}} that Barsa P et al (2006))<ref>Barsa P; Buchvald P; Frohlich R; Hradil J; Lukas R; Suchomel P; & Taller S.(2006).  Surgical treatment of fracture of the ring of axis - "hangman's fracture". 73(5): 321-8.</ref> conducted a 30 cases within 41 patients to treat by using anterior [[cervical]]{{dn|date=April 2013}} [[fixation]]{{dn|date=April 2013}} and [[Spinal fusion|fusion]] and 11 cases treated by a posterior [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]].

===Result of the  surgical treatment===
As a result, Barsa P et al<ref>Barsa P; Buchvald P; Frohlich R; Hradil J; Lukas R; Suchomel P; & Taller S.(2006).  Surgical treatment of fracture of the [[ring of axis]] - "hangman's fracture". 73(5): 321-8.</ref> showed that the result of fracture [[Spinal fusion|fusion]] reduced after one year but only one patient died of other disease during the follow-up. Besides, Hakalo J., Wronski J. (2008)<ref>Hakalo J; Wronski J.(2008).  Operative treatment of hangman's fractures of [[Cervical vertebra 2|C2]]. Posterior direct [[pars screw]] repair or anterior plate-cage [[stabilization (medical)|stabilization]]?  42(1): 28-36.</ref> both showed that operative treatment such as using [[transoral]] C2-C3 [[discectomy]] with plate-cage stabilization or posterior direct pars screw repair for the reducing and healing process.

===Result of another type of Hangman's fracture treatment===
Finally, as a result of the research studies, De Ridder D., Thimineur M.<ref>De Ridder D; Thimineur M. (2007).  C2 area neurostimulation: A surgical treatment for fibromyalgia. 8(8):639-43.</ref> founded out that there are 12 people including females and males that are 48 years old had gone under the Hangman's fracture treatment of [[peripheral]] neurostimulation of the C2 scalp which has reduced their six months pain levels of [[FM]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2013}}.

In deliberate or [[suicide methods|suicidal hanging]], [[asphyxia]] is much more likely to be the cause of death due to associated prevertebral swelling.

A common sign is a constricted pupil ([[Horner's syndrome]]) on the ipsilateral side due to loss of [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] innervation to the eye, caused by damage to the [[sympathetic trunk]] in the neck.
