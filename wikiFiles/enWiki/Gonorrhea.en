'''Gonorrhea''' ([[colloquial]]ly known as '''the clap'''<ref name="OxfordEnglish">''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref>) is a common human [[sexually transmitted infection]] caused by the bacterium ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''. The usual symptoms in men are burning with urination and penile discharge. Women, on the other hand, are asymptomatic half the time or have [[vaginal discharge]] and [[pelvic pain]]. In both men and women if gonorrhea is left untreated, it may spread locally causing [[epididymitis]] or [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] or throughout the body, affecting joints and [[heart valves]].

Treatment is commonly with [[ceftriaxone]] as [[antibiotic resistance]] has developed to many previously used medications. This is typically given in combination with either [[azithromycin]] or [[doxycycline]], because gonorrhea infections typically occur along with [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], an infection which ceftriaxone does not cover. However, some strains of gonorrhea have begun showing resistance to treatment.<ref name=Groopman>{{cite journal | title = Sex and the Superbug | journal = The New Yorker | date = 2012-10-01 | first = Jerome | last = Groopman | volume = LXXXVIII | issue = 30 | pages = 26–31 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/01/121001fa_fact_groopman | accessdate = 2012-10-13 | quote = ...public-health experts [see]...the emergence of a strain of gonorrhea that is resistant to the last drug available against it, and the harbinger of a sexually transmitted global epidemic.}}</ref> In April 2013, it was reported that HO41, a new strain, is incurable, can cause death within days, and might be worse than [[AIDS]].<ref>[http://www.cnbc.com/id/100685883 Sex Superbug Could Be 'Worse Than AIDS'], CNBC, April 30, 2013</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Half of women with gonorrhea are [[asymptomatic]] while others have [[vaginal discharge]], lower abdominal pain or [[dyspareunia|pain with intercourse]].<ref name=CE07/> Most men who are infected have symptoms such as [[urethritis]] associated with [[dysuria|burning with urination]] and discharge from the penis.<ref name=CE07/>  Either sex may also acquire gonorrhea of the throat from performing oral sex on an infected partner, usually a male partner.  Such infection is asymptomatic in 90% of cases, and produces a sore throat in the remaining 10%.<ref name=marr>{{Cite book|title=Sexually Transmitted Diseases: A Physician Tells You What You Need to Know|last=Marr|first=Lisa|authorlink=|last2=|first2=|editorn-last=|editorn-first=|edition=Second|volume=|year=2007|origyear=1998|page=|pages=|publisher=John Hopkins University|place=Baltimore, Maryland|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aywGiP9w-u8C&pg=PT150&dq=gonorrhea+throat&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FcB2T6qYBJOOigK_wLGnDg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=gonorrhea%20throat&f=false|accessdate=|isbn=978-0-8018-8658-4|oclc=}}</ref>
The [[incubation period]] is 2 to 14 days with most of these symptoms occurring between 4–6 days after being infected. Rarely, gonorrhea may cause skin lesions and joint infection (pain and swelling in the joints) after traveling through the blood stream (see below).  Very rarely it may settle in the heart causing [[endocarditis]] or in the spinal column causing [[meningitis]] (both are more likely among individuals with suppressed immune systems, however).<ref name=marr/>

==Cause==
Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''.<ref name=CE07/> The infection is transmitted from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex.<ref name=CE07/> Men have a 20% risk of getting the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected woman. The risk for men who have sex with men is higher.<ref name="Howard Brown">Howard Brown Health Center: STI Annual Report, 2009</ref> Women have a 60–80% risk of getting the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected man.<ref name="condomreport">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (2001-07-20). "Workshop Summary: Scientific Evidence on Condom Effectiveness for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention". Hyatt Dulles Airport, Herndon, Virginia. pp14</ref> A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as [[ophthalmia neonatorum]].<ref name=CE07/> It cannot be spread by toilets or bathrooms.<ref name=webmd>{{cite web|title=webmd – What Can You Catch in Restrooms? -|url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/what-can-you-catch-in-restrooms}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Traditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with [[gram stain]] and [[culture]]; however, newer [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) based testing methods are becoming more common.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barry PM, Klausner JD |title=The use of cephalosporins for gonorrhea: The impending problem of resistance |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=555–77 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19284360 |pmc=2657229 |doi=10.1517/14656560902731993 |url=}}</ref> In those who fail initial treatment culture should be done to determine sensitivity to antibiotics.<ref name=Japan10/> All people who test positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[syphilis]] and [[human immunodeficiency virus]].<ref name=Japan10>{{cite journal |author=Deguchi T, Nakane K, Yasuda M, Maeda S |title=Emergence and spread of drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae |journal=J.

==Screening==
The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. It is not recommended in males without symptoms or low risk women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meyers D |title=USPSTF recommendations for STI screening |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=819–24 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18386598 |doi= |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Wolff T |author3=Gregory K |display-authors=3 |last4=Marion |first4=L |last5=Moyer |first5=V |last6=Nelson |first6=H |last7=Petitti |first7=D |last8=Sawaya |first8=GF}}</ref>

Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, is recommended as part of [[prenatal care in the United States]].<ref>[http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care. Fourteenth Edition.] By the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement July 2010.</ref>

==Prevention==
{{main|Safe sex}}

The risk of infection can be reduced significantly by using [[condom]]s correctly and by having a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004526/ section: Prevention]</ref><ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/stdfact-gonorrhea.htm section: How can gonorrhea be prevented?]</ref> It may also be reduced by avoiding sexual intercourse.

==Management==
[[File:PenicillinPSAedit.jpg|thumb|[[Penicillin]] entered mass production in 1944 and revolutionized the treatment of several venereal diseases.]]
As of 2010, injectable [[ceftriaxone]] appears to be one of the few effective antibiotics.<ref name=Japan10 /> This is typically given in combination with either [[azithromycin]] or [[doxycycline]].<ref name=MMWR2012/>

Because of increasing rates of [[antibiotic resistance]] local susceptibility patterns need to be taken into account when deciding on treatment.<ref name=Japan10/> Many antibiotics that were once effective including [[penicillin]], [[tetracycline]] and [[fluoroquinolones]] are no longer recommended because of high rates of resistance.<ref name=Japan10/> Resistance to [[cefixime]] have reached a level such that it is no longer recommended as a first line agent in the United States and if it is used a person should be tested again after a week to determine if the infection still persists.<ref name=MMWR2012>{{cite journal|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|first=(CDC)|title=Update to CDC's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010: Oral Cephalosporins No Longer a Recommended Treatment for Gonococcal Infections.|journal=MMWR.

The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw the first drop in gonorrhoea antibiotic resistance in 5 years.<ref>http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2012PressReleases/120912Gonorrhoeatreatmentresistanceriskfalls/</ref>

It is recommended that sexual partners be tested and potentially treated.<ref name=Japan10/> One option for treating sexual partners of people infected is [[patient-delivered partner therapy]] (PDPT) which involves providing prescriptions or medications to the person to take to their partner without the health care provider first examining them.<ref name=EPTFinalReport2006>[http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/EPTFinalReport2006.pdf "Expedited partner therapy in the management of sexually transmitted diseases"]. February 2006. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</ref>

==Prognosis==
[[File:Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.jpg|thumb|If not treated gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/clinic-clinique/pdf/s1c16e.pdf|title=Prophylaxis for Gonococcal and Chlamydial Ophthalmia Neonatorum ''in'' the Canadian Guide to Clinical Preventative Health Care|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada}}</ref>]]

Gonorrhea if left untreated may last for weeks or months with higher risks of complications.<ref name=CE07/> One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin [[pustule]]s or [[petechia]], [[septic arthritis]], [[meningitis]] or [[endocarditis]].<ref name=CE07/> This occurs in between 0.6 and 3.0% of women and 0.4 and 0.7% of men.<ref name=CE07/>

In men, inflammation of the epididymis ([[epididymitis]]); prostate gland ([[prostatitis]]) and urethral stricture ([[urethritis]]) can result from untreated gonorrhea.<ref name=Robbins>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 705–706 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1</ref> In women, the most common result of untreated gonorrhea is [[pelvic inflammatory disease]]. Other complications include [[perihepatitis]],<ref name=Robbins/> a rare complication associated with [[Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome]]; [[septic arthritis]] in the fingers, wrists, toes, and ankles; [[septic abortion]]; [[chorioamnionitis]] during pregnancy; neonatal or adult blindness from conjunctivitis; and infertility.

Neonates coming through the birth canal are given erythromycin ointment in the eyes to prevent blindness from infection.
The underlying gonorrhea should be treated; if this is done then usually a good prognosis will follow.

Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Datta|first=SD|coauthors=Sternberg, M; Johnson, RE; Berman, S; Papp, JR; McQuillan, G; Weinstock, H|title=Gonorrhea and chlamydia in the United States among persons 14 to 39 years of age, 1999 to 2002.|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2007 Jul 17|volume=147|issue=2|pages=89–96|pmid=17638719}}</ref>

Gonorrhea is a common [[infectious disease]]. WHO estimates that 62 million cases of gonorrhea appear each year.<ref>"[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16392895 Detection of gonococcal infection : pros and cons of a rapid test.]". PubMed.gov.</ref>

In the United Kingdom 196 per 100,000 males 20 to 24 years old, and 133 per 100,000 females 16 to 19 years old were diagnosed in 2005.<ref name=CE07>{{cite journal |author=Moran JS |title=Gonorrhoea |journal=Clin Evid (Online) |volume=2007 |issue= |pages= |year=2007 |pmid=19454057 |doi= |url= |pmc=2943790}}</ref> The [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] estimates that more than 700,000 people in the United States get new gonorrheal infections each year. Only about half of these infections are reported to CDC. In 2004, 330,132 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC. After the implementation of a national gonorrhea control program in the mid-1970s, the national gonorrhea rate declined from 1975 to 1997. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased slightly since 1999.

==History==
[[File:Gono - Man's Friend.png|left|thumb| An old patent medicine named "Gono" pitches itself as "Man's Friend for gonorrhea and gleet – an unequalled remedy for unnatural discharges."]]
Some scholars translate the biblical terms ''zav'' (for a male) and ''zavah'' (for a female) as gonorrhea.<ref>[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/metzora/nitzan.html]</ref>

It has been suggested that [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] was used as a treatment for gonorrhea. Surgeons' tools on board the recovered English warship the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' included a [[syringe]] that, according to some, was used to inject the mercury via the [[urinary meatus]] into any unfortunate crewman suffering from gonorrhea. The name "the clap", in reference to the disease, is recorded as early as the sixteenth century.<ref name="OxfordEnglish" />

[[Silver nitrate]] was one of the widely used drugs in the 19th century, but it became replaced by [[Protargol]]. [[Arthur Eichengrün]] invented this type of colloidal silver, which was marketed by [[Bayer]] from 1897 on. The silver-based treatment was used until the first antibiotics came into use in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Max Bender| title = Ueber neuere Antigonorrhoica (insbes. Argonin und Protargol)| journal = Archives of Dermatological Research| year = 1898| volume = 43| issue = 1| pages = 31–36| doi = 10.1007/BF01986890}}</ref><ref name=medlineneogono>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001606|Neonatal Conjunctivitis}}</ref>

The exact time of onset of gonorrhea as prevalent disease or epidemic cannot be accurately determined from the historical record. One of the first reliable notations occur in the Acts of the (English) Parliament. In 1161 this body passed a law to reduce the spread of "...the perilous infirmity of burning."<ref>W Sanger. History of Prostitution. NY,Harper, 1910 .</ref> The symptoms described are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, gonorrhea. A similar decree was passed by [[Louis IX]] in France in 1256, replacing regulation with banishment.<ref>P. LaCroix. The History of Prostitution—Vol. 2. NY,MacMillan, 1931.</ref> Similar symptoms were noted at the [[siege of Acre]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} by [[Crusaders]].

Coincidental to, or dependent on, the appearance of a gonorrhea epidemic, several changes occurred in European medieval society. Cities hired [[public health]] doctors to treat afflicted patients without right of refusal. [[Pope Boniface]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} rescinded the requirement that physicians complete studies for the lower orders of the [[Catholic priesthood]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Medieval public health physicians in the employ of their cities were required to treat prostitutes infected with the "burning", as well as lepers and other epidemic victims.<ref>WE Leiky. History of European Morals. NY, MacMillan, 1926.</ref> After Pope Boniface completely secularized the practice of medicine, physicians were more willing to treat a sexually transmitted disease.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Human [[Guatemala syphilis experiment|experiments were conducted by the USA in Guatemala]] from 1946 to 1948 to find a cure for syphilis and gonorrhea. The USA formally apologized to Guatemala in 2010.
