== History ==
In 1974 Zagreb University School of Medicine founded Study of Medicine in Split, which enabled medical students enrolled in Zagreb to complete their last two clinical years in Split. In 1979 the first entrance exam was held at Study of Medicine in Split and enabled medical students to complete their entire medical education in Split. At the time medical studies in Croatia lasted 5 years, which was changed in 1990/1991 academic year, when medical curriculum was extended to 6 years. The difficulties stemming from the organizational scheme of work of Zagreb University School of Medicine and its branch in Split, and particularly complex political and geographical relations were reasons for transformation of medical studies in Split in a separate institution.<ref>•Marušić M, Sapunar D.
