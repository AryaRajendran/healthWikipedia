[[File:US-NLM-NCBI-Logo.svg|140px|thumb|National Center for Biotechnology Information logo]] The '''National Center for Biotechnology Information''' ('''NCBI''') is part of the  [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), a branch of the [[National Institutes of Health]].  The NCBI is located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] ({{Coord|38.994994|-77.099339 |display=inline,title |region:US_type:landmark}}) and was founded in 1988 through legislation sponsored by Senator [[Claude Pepper]].

The NCBI houses a series of databases relevant to [[biotechnology]] and biomedicine. Major databases include [[GenBank]] for DNA sequences and [[PubMed]], a bibliographic database for the biomedical literature. All these databases are available online through the [[Entrez]] search engine.

NCBI is directed by [[David Lipman]], one of the original authors of the [[BLAST]] sequence alignment program and a widely respected figure in [[bioinformatics]]. He also leads an intramural research program, including groups led by [[Stephen Altschul]] (another [[BLAST]] co-author), David Landsman, [[Eugene Koonin]] (a prolific author on [[comparative genomics]]), John Wilbur, Teresa Przytycka, and Zhiyong Lu.

==GenBank==
{{Main|GenBank}}

The NCBI has had responsibility for making available the GenBank [[DNA]] [[Biological databases|sequence database]] since 1992.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21105/#ch1.History The NCBI Handbook, History]</ref> GenBank coordinates with individual laboratories and other sequence databases such as those of the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) and the [[DNA Data Bank of Japan]] (DDBJ).<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21105/#ch1.International_Collaboration The NCBI Handbook, International Collaborations]</ref>

Since 1992, NCBI has grown to provide other databases in addition to GenBank. NCBI provides [[Gene (database) | Gene]], [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]], the Molecular Modeling Database (3D protein structures), [[dbSNP]] (a database of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s), the Reference Sequence Collection, a map of the [[human genome]], and a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] browser, and coordinates with the National Cancer Institute to provide the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project. The NCBI assigns a unique identifier (taxonomy ID number) to each species of organism.

The NCBI has software tools that are available by [[World Wide Web|WWW]] browsing or by FTP. For example, [[BLAST]] is a sequence similarity searching program. BLAST can do sequence comparisons against the GenBank DNA database in less than 15 seconds.

==NCBI Bookshelf==
The '''NCBI Bookshelf''' is a collection of freely available, downloadable, on-line versions of selected biomedical books. The Bookshelf covers a wide range of topics including [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[cell biology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]], disease states from a molecular and cellular point of view, research methods, and [[virology]]. Some of the books are online versions of previously published books, while others, such as [[Coffee Break (book)|Coffee Break]], are written and edited by NCBI staff. The Bookshelf is a complement to the [[Pubmed|Entrez PubMed]] repository of [[Peer review|peer-reviewed publication]] abstracts in that Bookshelf contents provide established perspectives on evolving areas of study and a context in which many disparate individual pieces of reported research can be organized.{{fact|date=January 2013}}
