In [[orthopedics]], a '''valgus deformity''' is a term for outward angulation of the [[distal]] segment of a [[bone]] or [[joint]].  The opposite deformation, medial deviation of the distal bone, is called [[varus deformity|varus]]. 

The terms varus and valgus always refer to the direction that the distal segment of the joint points.

For a discussion of the [[etymology]] of these words, see the entry under [[varus deformity|varus]].

Common causes of Valgus Knee in adults include arthritis of the knee and trauma.

==Knee arthritis with valgus knee==

[[Rheumatoid]] knee commonly presents as valgus knee. [[Osteoarthritis]] knee may also sometimes present with valgus deformity though varus deformity is common. [[Total knee arthroplasty]] (TKA) to correct valgus deformity is surgically difficult and requires specialized implants called [[constrained condylar knee]]s.

==Examples==
[[File:Cubitus varus and cubitus valgus.png|thumb|[[Cubitus varus]] and [[cubitus valgus]].]]
*'''Hip:''' ''[[coxa valga]]'' (from Latin ''coxa'' = hip) &mdash; the shaft of the [[femur]] is bent outward in respect to the neck of the femur. Coxa vara on the other hand is a direct match of above where the neck-shaft angle is increased(from nearly 135).
*'''Knee:''' ''[[genu valgum]]'' (from Latin ''genu'' = knee) &mdash; the tibia is turned outward in relation to the femur, resulting in a knock-kneed appearance.
*'''Ankle:''' ''[[talipes valgus]]'' (from Latin ''talus'' = ankle and ''pes'' = foot) &mdash; outward turning of the heel, resulting in clubfoot with the person walking on the inner part.
*'''Foot'''. Pes valgus. 
*'''Toe:''' ''[[hallux valgus]]'' (Latin ''hallux'' = big toe) &mdash; outward deviation of the big toe toward the second toe.
*'''Elbows:''' ''[[cubitus valgus]]'' (Latin ''cubitus'' = elbow) &mdash; turned-in elbows
*'''Hand:''' 'Manus valgus; manus - Latin for hand
