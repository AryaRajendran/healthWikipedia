A '''high-protein diet''' is often recommended by [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] and [[nutrition]]ists to help efforts to build muscle and lose fat. It should not be confused with [[low-carb]] [[diet (nutrition)|diets]] such as the [[Atkins Diet]], which are not calorie-controlled and which often contain large amounts of fat.

While adequate [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] is required for building [[skeletal muscle]] and other tissues, there is ongoing debate regarding the use and necessity of high-protein diets in [[anaerobic exercise]] in particular [[weight training]] and [[bodybuilding]].

== Health effects ==
Extreme protein intake (in excess of 200 g per day), coupled with inadequate intake of other calorie sources (fat or carbohydrates), can cause a form of metabolic disturbance and death commonly known as [[rabbit starvation]].<ref>Bilsborough S, Mann N. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16779921 A review of issues of dietary protein intake in humans], Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab. 2006 Apr;16(2):129-52.</ref>

Relatively little evidence has been gathered regarding the effect of long-term high intake of [[protein]] on the development of chronic diseases.<ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/protein.html Protein: Nutrition Source, Harvard School of Public Health<!-- Bot generated titleresearch is needed to better understand protein's role in [[bone] health.<ref>[http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/NationalDairyCouncil/Health/Digest/dcd74-5Page1.htm National Dairy Council – Dietary Protein & Bone Health: New Perspectives<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Increased load on the kidney is a result of an increase in [[renal reabsorption|reabsorption]] of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]]. This causes a decrease in the sensitivity of [[tubuloglomerular feedback]], which, in turn, results in an increased [[glomerular filtration rate]]. This increases pressure in [[glomerular]] capillaries.<ref name=boron771>{{cite book |author=Walter F., PhD. Boron |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi=}} Page 771</ref> When added to any additional [[renal disease]], this may cause permanent [[glomerular damage]].

As is apparent from the list below, many high-protein foods (indeed, most low-carb foods with protein) are fairly low in fiber. This can lead to discomfort if additional [[Dietary fiber|roughage]] is not added to the diet.

==Protein and weight training==
[[File:Tofu-beijingchina.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tofu]] is also a high-protein option.]]

Protein is described as essential by advocates of the high-protein diet, which includes a large proportion of the [[bodybuilding]] community; it is claimed to provide the muscle with [[amino acids]] required to repair the damage done by [[anaerobic exercise]]. Some consume [[Bodybuilding supplement#Protein|Protein supplements]] after bodybuilding workouts, as they provide a quick and easily consumable protein source.<ref>[http://www.foodforfitness.co.uk/#/nutrition-plan/4544965437 FoodForFitness.co.uk - Muscle Gain Nutrition]</ref>  Alternatively, meat, beans, or other high-protein foods are consumed.

It is worth noting that it is possible to maintain a strict [[vegan]] high-protein diet, though due to the lower nutrient density of plant-based foods this requires a larger absolute volume of food compared to a non-vegan diet; simply put, vegans must consume a lot more food to get a lot of protein.<ref>New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/sports/vegans-muscle-their-way-into-bodybuilding.html Sculptured by Weights and a Strict Vegan Diet]</ref>

Although some testing shows that the body will absorb and use a greater amount of protein after "bodybuilding" type exercises than under more sedentary circumstances,<ref>Protein requirements and muscle mass/strength changes during intensive training in novice bodybuilders, Journal of Applied Physiology August 1992 vol. 73 no. 2 767-775 [http://jap.physiology.org/content/73/2/767.abstract]</ref> and some studies on weight training show clinically significant gains in muscle with a very high protein diet when compared to more moderate intake, in some studies increased protein intake fails to translate into functional differences in strength or muscle size.<ref>Journal of Sports Sciences, 2004, 22, 65–79 Protein and amino acids for athletes [http://www.uni.edu/dolgener/Advanced_Sport_Nutrition/protein_intake.pdf]</ref>   However, consistently consuming less protein than an individual's body requires (estimated as 0.7g/kg/day for a sedentary individual)<ref>http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/5_Summary%20Table%20Tables%201-4.pdf</ref> causes loss of existing lean body mass, even with an excessively caloric diet.<ref>Effect of Dietary Protein Content on Weight Gain, Energy Expenditure, and Body Composition During Overeating: A Randomized Controlled Trial
