'''Behçet's disease''' ''(beh-CHETS)'', sometimes called '''Behçet's syndrome''', '''Morbus Behçet''', or '''Silk Road disease''', is a rare immune-mediated  small-vessel [[Systemic disease|systemic]] [[vasculitis]]<ref name="urlGlossary, ">{{cite web |url=http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/patientcare/healthcare_services/multiple_sclerosis/ms_glossary/Pages/index.aspx |title=Glossary, |work= |accessdate=2009-03-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090419191027/http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/patientcare/healthcare_services/multiple_sclerosis/ms_glossary/Pages/index.aspx| archivedate= 19 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> that often presents with mucous membrane ulceration and ocular problems. Behçet's disease (BD) was named in 1937 after the Turkish dermatologist [[Hulusi Behçet]], who first described the triple-symptom complex of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and [[uveitis]]. As a systemic disease, it can also involve [[visceral organs]] such as the gastrointestinal tract, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and neurological systems. This syndrome can be fatal due to ruptured vascular [[aneurysms]] or severe neurological complications.<ref name=mk>{{cite book | author = Bolster MB | title = MKSAP 15 Medical Knowledge Self-assessment Program: Rheumatology | publisher = American College of Physicians | location = Philadelphia, Pa | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 1-934465-30-5 }}</ref>

==History==
Behçet disease is [[eponym|named]] after [[Hulusi Behçet]] (1889–1948), the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[dermatologist]] and [[scientist]] who first recognized the syndrome in one of his patients in 1924 and reported his research on the disease in ''Journal of Skin and Venereal Diseases'' in 1936.<ref name="WhoNamedIt">{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1863}}</ref><ref>H.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Hypopyon.jpg|Right|thumb|A patient depicting hypopyon which can be seen in [[anterior uveitis]] in a patient with Behcet's disease.]]

[[Image:Eyevessels 001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A left eye vessels|Funduscopic photo left eye centered on the [[optic disc]].]]

'''Skin and mucosa'''<br>
Nearly all patients present with some form of painful oral mucocutaneous ulcerations in the form of [[aphthous ulcer]]s or non-scarring oral lesions.<ref name=mk /> The oral lesions are similar to those found in [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and can be relapsing.<ref name=mk /> Painful genital ulcerations usually develop around the anus, vulva, or scrotum and cause scarring in 75% of the patients.<ref name=mk /> Additionally, patients may present with [[erythema nodosum]], cutaneous pustular vasculitis, and lesions similar to [[pyoderma gangrenosum]].<ref name=mk />

'''Ocular system'''<br>
Inflammatory eye disease can develop early in the disease course and lead to permanent vision loss in 20% of cases. Ocular involvement can be in the form of [[Uveitis#Posterior_Uveitis|posterior uveitis]], [[anterior uveitis]], or [[retinal vasculitis]]. Anterior uveitis presents with painful eyes, conjuctival redness, [[hypopyon]], and decreased visual acuity, while posterior uveitis presents with painless decreased visual acuity and visual field floaters. A rare form of ocular (eye) involvement in this syndrome is retinal vasculitis which presents with painless decrease of vision with the possibility of floaters or visual field defects.<ref name={zakir shah}

Optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease is rare, typically presenting as progressive  [[optic atrophy]] and visual loss. However, cases of acute optic neuropathy (specifically [[anterior ischemic optic neuropathy]]) have also been reported to occur.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eye |url=http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v25/n3/full/eye2010208a.html |title=Access : A case of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy associated with Behcet's disease : Eye |publisher=Nature.com |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}</ref> Optic nerve atrophy has been identified as the most common cause of visual impairment. Behçet's disease may result in primary or secondary optic nerve involvement. Papilledema as a result of [[dural sinus thrombosis]]<ref name="Fujikado"/> and atrophy resulting from retinal disease, have been characterized as secondary causes of optic nerve atrophy in Behçet's disease.<ref name="Ozdal"/><ref name="Kansu"/>

Signs and symptoms of acute [[optic neuropathy]] include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, [[relative afferent pupillary defect]], central [[scotoma]], swollen optic disc, [[macular edema]], or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. [[Intracranial hypertension]] with [[papilledema]] may be present.

'''Bowels'''<br>
GI manifestations include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea with or without blood, and they often involve the ileocecal valve.<ref name=mk /> Many patients with BD often complain about abdominal tenderness, bloating, and generic abdominal discomfort that closely mimics irritable bowel syndrome.

'''Lungs'''<br>
Lung involvement is typically in the form of [[hemoptysis]], [[pleuritis]], cough, or fever, and in severe cases can be life threatening if the outlet pulmonary artery develops an aneurysm which ruptures causing severe vascular collapse and death from bleeding in the lungs.<ref name=mk /> Nodules, consolidations, cavities and ground glass lesions are common in patients with pulmonary involvement.<ref name=Hatemi2012>Hatemi G, Seyahi E, Fresko I, Hamuryudan V (2012) Behçet's syndrome: a critical digest of the recent literature. Clin Exp Rheumatol</ref> Pulmonary artery thrombosis may occur.

'''Musculoskeletal system'''<br>
[[Arthralgia]] is seen in up to half of patients, and is usually a non-erosive poly or oligoarthritis primarily of the large joints of the lower extremities.<ref name=mk />

'''Neurological system'''<br>
Neurological involvements range from [[aseptic meningitis]] to vascular thrombosis such as [[dural sinus thrombosis]] and [[organic brain syndrome]] manifesting with confusion, seizures, and memory loss.<ref name=mk /> They often appear late in the progression of the disease but are associated with a poor prognosis.

'''Cardiac'''<br>
[[Pericarditis]] is a frequent cardiac manifestation.<ref name="Hatemi2012" />

==Cause==
The cause is not well-defined, but it is primarily characterized by auto-inflammation of the blood vessels. Although sometimes erroneously referred to as a "diagnosis of exclusion," the diagnosis can sometimes be reached by pathologic examination of the affected areas.<ref name="urlBehcet Disease: Overview - eMedicine Dermatology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1122381-overview |title=Behcet Disease: Overview - eMedicine Dermatology |work= |accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> 

The primary mechanism of the damage is an overactive immune system that seems to target the patient's own body. The involvement of a subset of T cells (Th17) seems to be important.<ref name="Hatemi2012" /> The primary cause is not well known. In fact, no one knows yet why the immune system starts to behave this way in Behçet's disease. There does however seem to be a genetic component involved, as first degree relatives of the affected patients are often affected in more than expected proportion for the general population. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

An association with the [[GIMAP]] family of genes on the long arm of [[chromosome 7]] (7q36.1) has been reported.<ref name=Lee2012>Lee YJ, Horie Y, Wallace GR, Choi YS, Park JA, Song R, Kang YM, Kang SW, Baek HJ, Kitaichi N, Meguro A, Mizuki N, Namba K, Ishida S, Kim J, Niemczek E, Lee EY, Song YW, Ohno S, Lee EB (2012) Genome-wide association study identifies GIMAP as a novel susceptibility locus for Behcet's disease. Ann Rheum Dis</ref> The genes implicated were [[GIMAP1]], [[GIMAP2]] and [[GIMAP4]].

==Pathophysiology==

Behçet's disease is considered more prevalent in the areas surrounding the [[Silk Road|old silk trading routes]] in the [[Middle East]] and in [[Central Asia]]. Thus, it is sometimes known as ''Silk Road Disease''.  However, this disease is not restricted to people from these regions. A large number of serological studies show a linkage between the disease and [[HLA-B51]].<ref name="pmid18214795">{{cite journal |author=Durrani K, Papaliodis GN |title=The genetics of Adamantiades-Behcet's disease |journal=Semin Ophthalmol |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=73–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18214795|doi=10.1080/08820530701745264 }}</ref> HLA-B51 is more frequently found from the Middle East to South Eastern Siberia, but the incidence of B51 in some studies was 3 fold higher than the normal population.

[[Vasculitis]] resulting in occlusion of the vessels supplying the optic nerve may be the cause of acute optic neuropathy and progressive optic atrophy in Behçet's disease. Histological evaluation in a reported case of acute optic neuropathy demonstrated substitution of the axonal portion of the optic nerve with fibrous astrocytes without retinal changes.<ref name="Kansu"/> CNS involvement in Behçet's may lead to intracranial hypertension most commonly due to dural venous sinus thrombosis<ref name="Fujikado"/> [8-10] and subsequent secondary optic atrophy.

==Diagnosis==
There is no specific pathological testing or technique available for the diagnosis of the disease, although the International Study Group criteria for the disease are highly sensitive and specific, involving clinical criteria and a [[pathergy]] test.<ref name=mk /><ref name="pmid1970380">{{cite journal |author= International Study Group for Behçet's Disease |title=Criteria for diagnosis of Behçet's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=335 |issue=8697 |pages=1078–80 |year=1990|month=May |pmid=1970380 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(90)92643-V|url=}}</ref> Behçet's disease has a high degree of resemblance to diseases that cause mucocutaneous lesions such as ''[[Herpes simplex]]'' labialis, and therefore clinical suspicion should be maintained until all the common causes of oral lesions are ruled out from the [[differential diagnosis]].

Visual acuity, or color vision loss with concurrent mucocutaneous lesions and/or systemic Behçet's symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed in addition to an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, [[optical coherence tomography]] to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.

Despite the inclusive criteria set forth by the International Study Group, there are cases where not all the criteria can be met and therefore a diagnosis cannot readily be made. There is however a set of clinical findings that a physician can rely upon in making a tentative diagnosis of the disease; essentially Behçet's disease does not always follow the International Study Group guidelines and so a high degree of suspicion for a patient who presents having any number of the following findings is necessary:

*[[mouth]] [[sore|ulcers]]
*[[arthritis]]/[[arthralgia]]
*[[nervous system]] symptoms
*[[stomach]] and/or [[bowel]] inflammation
*deep [[vein]] [[thrombosis]]
*superficial [[thrombophlebitis]]
*[[epididymitis]]
*cardio-vascular problems of an inflammatory origin
*inflammatory problems in [[chest]] and [[lungs]]
*problems with hearing and/or balance
*extreme exhaustion
*changes of [[wikt:personality|personality]], [[psychoses]]
*any other members of the family with a diagnosis of Behçet disease.

==Treatment==
Current treatment is aimed at easing the symptoms, reducing inflammation, and controlling the immune system.

Given its rarity, the optimal treatment for acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease has not been established. Early identification and treatment is essential. Response to [[ciclosporin]], periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment.<ref name="Voros" /> [[Immunosuppressant]]s such as interferon alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Behçet's, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment may be required to prevent optic atrophy in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids.
