The '''Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance''' is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]], which uses a [[helicopter]] to provide an [[air ambulance]] service to the English counties of [[Dorset]] and [[Somerset]]. The air ambulance came into service in March 2000, following the success of similar schemes, such as [[Devon Air Ambulance Trust]] and  [[Cornwall Air Ambulance]]. The air ambulance headquarters are at [[Wellington, Somerset|Wellington]] in Somerset, but the helicopter is based at [[Henstridge]] Airfield in Somerset.

==Aircraft==
The current helicopter is a [[Eurocopter EC 135]], callsign ''Helimed 10'', which has been in service since 2007.<ref name=newheli>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6409487.stm | title= New helicopter for air ambulance | publisher= [[BBC News]] | date= 1 March 2007 | accessdate= 5 July 2009}}</ref>
Travelling at speeds of up to {{convert|150|kn|mph km/h}}, it can land in an area half the size of a tennis court and can reach anywhere in the two counties within twenty minutes of an emergency call.<ref>http://somersetgateway.somerset.gov.uk/records/OrganisationRecord.jsp?category=Search+All&doc=0&maxdoc=1&query=_primary_key:27436</ref> It is crewed by one pilot and two [[paramedic]]s and can carry two patients on stretchers. The pilots are employed by [[Bond Aviation Group|Bond Air Services]], the company which leases the helicopter to the air ambulance service and the paramedics are employed by [[South Western Ambulance Service]].

==Operations==
In May 2011, the Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance flew its 8,000th mission,<ref name=miss8000>{{cite news | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-13278842 | newspaper= BBC News | date= 4 May 2011 | accessdate= 4 May 2011 | title= Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance attends 8,000 calls}}</ref><ref name=missions>{{cite web | url=http://www.dsairambulance.org.uk/about-us/usage-statistics/| title= Usage Statistics | publisher= Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance | accessdate= 4 May 2011}}</ref> 
and {{as of|2011|11|lc=on}} it has flown a total of 8,233.
In 2009, the helicopter flew 982 missions,<ref name=missions/> an increase on the 853 flown in 2008. Typical incidents for which the assistance of the air ambulance is requested by [[South Western Ambulance Service]], include [[road traffic collisions]] and horse riding accidents, due to the remote locations and the severity of injuries involved in such incidents.

The helicopter  is leased from [[Bond Aviation Group|Bond Air Services]] and costs in excess of £4,000 per day to run<ref name=miss8000/> and this money has to be raised largely from charitable donations. The charity is supported by volunteers spread across the two counties who work to raise funds to ensure that this service continues. It also runs a weekly lottery which has, to date, over 50,000 members.
