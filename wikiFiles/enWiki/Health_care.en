{{About|the provision of medical care}}
'''Health care''' (or '''healthcare''') is the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of [[disease]], [[illness]], injury, and other physical and mental impairments in humans. Health care is delivered by practitioners in [[Doctor of Medicine|medicine]], [[chiropractic]], [[dentistry]], [[nursing]], [[pharmacy]], [[allied health]], and other [[health care provider|care providers]]. It refers to the work done in providing primary care, secondary care and tertiary care, as well as in [[public health]].

Access to health care varies across countries, groups and individuals, largely influenced by social and economic conditions as well as the [[health policy|health policies]] in place. Countries and jurisdictions have different policies and plans in relation to the personal and population-based health care goals within their societies. [[Health care system]]s are organizations established to meet the [[health]] needs of target populations. Their exact configuration varies from country to country. In some countries and jurisdictions, health care planning is distributed among market participants, whereas in others planning is made more centrally among governments or other coordinating bodies. In all cases, according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a robust financing mechanism; a well-trained and adequately-paid [[Health Human Resources|workforce]]; reliable information on which to base decisions and [[health policy|policies]]; and well maintained [[health care provider|facilities]] and logistics to deliver quality medicines and technologies.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/health_systems/en/ ''Health systems.''] Geneva.</ref>

Health care can form a significant part of a country's [[Economic system|economy]]. In 2008, the [[health care industry]] consumed an average of 9.0 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) across the most developed [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/11/0,3343,en_21571361_44315115_45549771_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD data]</ref> The United States (16.0%), France (11.2%), and Switzerland (10.7%) were the top three spenders.

Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general [[health]] and well-being of people around the world. An example of this is the worldwide eradication of [[smallpox]] in 1980—declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be completely eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.<ref>World Health Organization. ''Anniversary of smallpox eradication.'' Geneva, 18 June 2010.</ref>

While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different cultural, political, organizational and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process, that may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care.<ref name="Cookie">Thomas-MacLean R et al.

===Primary care===

'''Primary care''' is the term for the health care services which play a role in the local community. It refers to the work of [[health care provider|health care professionals]] who act as a first point of consultation for all [[patients]] within the health care system.<ref name="Cookie"/><ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.wpro.who.int/nr/rdonlyres/45b45060-a38e-496f-b2c1-bd2dc6c04c52/0/44definitionofterms2009.pdf ''Definition of Terms.''] Accessed 24 June 2011.</ref> Such a professional would usually be a [[primary care physician]], such as a [[general practitioner]] or [[Family medicine|family physician]], or a non-physician primary care provider, such as a [[physician assistant]] or [[nurse practitioner]]. Depending on the locality, health system organization, and sometimes at the patient's discretion, they may see another health care professional first, such as a [[pharmacist]], a [[nurse]] (such as in the United Kingdom), a [[clinical officer]] (such as in parts of Africa), or an [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] or other traditional medicine professional (such as in parts of Asia). Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may then be [[Referral (medicine)|referred]] for secondary or tertiary care.

Primary care involves the widest scope of health care, including all ages of patients, patients of all [[socioeconomic]] and geographic origins, patients seeking to maintain optimal [[health]], and patients with all manner of acute and chronic physical, [[mental health|mental]] and social health issues, including [[Polypharmacy|multiple chronic diseases]]. Consequently, a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas. [[Transitional care#continuity|Continuity]] is a key characteristic of primary care, as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine check-ups and [[preventive medicine|preventive care]], [[health education]], and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem. The [[International Classification of Primary Care]] (ICPC) is a standardized tool for understanding and analyzing information on interventions in primary care by the reason for the patient visit.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/adaptations/icpc2/en/index.html ''International Classification of Primary Care, Second edition (ICPC-2)''.] Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011.</ref>

Common chronic illnesses usually treated in primary care may include, for example: [[hypertension]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[back pain]], [[Osteoarthritis|arthritis]] or [[Thyroid disease|thyroid dysfunction]]. Primary care also includes many basic [[maternal health|maternal]] and child health care services, such as [[family planning]] services and [[vaccination]]s. 

In context of global [[population aging]], with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic [[non-communicable disease]]s, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected around the world, in both developed and developing countries.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/ageing/en/ ''Aging and life course: Our aging world.''] Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011.</ref><ref>Simmons J. [http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/content/233658/topic/WS_HLM2_PHY/Primary-Care-Needs-New-Innovations-to-Meet-Growing-Demands.html ''Primary Care Needs New Innovations to Meet Growing Demands.''] ''HealthLeaders Media'', May 27, 2009.</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] attributes the provision of essential primary care as an integral component of an inclusive [[primary health care]] strategy.<ref name="Cookie"/>

===Secondary Care===
'''Secondary care''' is the health care services provided by [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialists]] and other health professionals who generally do not have first contact with [[patients]], for example, [[cardiologists]], [[urologists]] and [[dermatology|dermatologists]].

It includes [[acute care]]: necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury or other health condition, such as in a hospital [[emergency department]]. It also includes skilled attendance during [[childbirth]], [[intensive care medicine|intensive care]], and [[medical imaging]] services.

The "secondary care" is sometimes used synonymously with "[[hospital]] care". However many secondary care providers do not necessarily work in hospitals, such as [[psychiatrists]], [[clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]], [[occupational therapists]] or [[physiotherapist]]s, and some primary care services are delivered within hospitals. Depending on the organization and policies of the national health system, patients may be required to see a primary care provider for a [[referral (medicine)|referral]] before they can access secondary care. 

For example in the United States, which operates under a [[mixed market]] health care system, some [[physician]]s might voluntarily limit their practice to secondary care by requiring patients to see a primary care provider first, or this restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private/group [[health insurance]] plans. In other cases medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred. 

In the United Kingdom and Canada, patient self-referral to a medical specialist for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from [[Health insurance|private insurance schemes]] or [[national health insurance]]. 

[[Allied health professions|Allied health professionals]], such as [[physical therapy|physical therapists]], [[respiratory therapists]], [[occupational therapist]]s, [[Speech and language pathology|speech therapists]], and [[dietitians]], also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral.

===Tertiary care===

[[File:NationalNeurologyHospital.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] is a specialist neurological hospital.]]
{{See also|Medicine}}
'''Tertiary care''' is specialized consultative health care, usually for [[inpatient]]s and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced [[medicine|medical]] investigation and treatment, such as a [[tertiary referral hospital]].<ref>Johns Hopkins Medicine. [http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/patient_care/pay_bill/insurance_footnotes.html ''Patient Care: Tertiary Care Definition''.] Accessed 27 June 2011.</ref>

Examples of tertiary care services are [[cancer]] management, [[neurosurgery]], [[cardiac surgery]], [[plastic surgery]], treatment for severe [[burn]]s, advanced [[neonatology]] services, palliative, and other complex medical and surgical interventions.<ref name="Emory">Emory University. [http://www.em.emory.edu/hospital_eu.html School of Medicine.] Accessed 27 June 2011.</ref>

====Quaternary care====
The term '''quaternary care''' is also used sometimes as an extension of tertiary care in reference to medicine of advanced levels which are highly [[Medical specialist|specialized]] and not widely accessed. [[Clinical research|Experimental medicine]] and some types of uncommon [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] or [[surgery|surgical]] procedures are considered quaternary care. These services are usually only offered in a limited number of regional or national health care centres.<ref name="Emory"/><ref>Alberta Rural Physician Action Plan. [http://www.rpap.ab.ca/orientation_guide/levels-of-care.html ''Levels of Care''.] Accessed 27 June 2011.</ref>  This term is more prevalent in the United Kingdom, but just as applicable in the United States.  It can be thought as a hospital where virtually any procedure is available where as there may not be sub-specialist with that training at a given tertiary care hosptial.

===Home and community care===
{{See also|Public health}}
Many types of health care interventions are delivered outside of health facilities. They include many interventions of [[public health]] interest, such as [[food safety]] surveillance, distribution of [[condom]]s and [[needle-exchange programme]]s for the prevention of transmissible diseases.

They also include the services of professionals in residential and community settings in support of [[self care]], [[home care]], [[long-term care]], [[assisted living]], treatment for [[substance use disorder]]s and other types of health and social care services.

Community [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] services can assist with mobility and independence after loss of limbs or loss of function.  This can include [[prosthesis]], [[orthotics]] or [[wheelchair]]s.

Many countries, especially in the west are dealing with aging populations, and one of the priorities of the health care system is to help seniors live full, independent lives in the comfort of their own homes. There is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in day to day activities at home, transporting them to doctor’s appointments, and many other activities that are so essential for their health and well-being.

With obesity in children rapidly becoming a major concern, health services often set up programs in schools aimed at educating children in good eating habits; making physical education compulsory in school; and teaching young adolescents to have positive self-image.

==Related sectors==
Health care extends beyond the delivery of services to patients, encompassing many related sectors, and set within a bigger picture of financing and governance structures.

===Health system===
{{Main|Health system|Health systems by country}}
A '''health system''', also sometimes referred to as '''health care system''' or '''healthcare system''' is the organization of people, institutions, and resources to deliver health care services to meet the [[health]] needs of target populations.

===Health care industry===
{{See also|Health care industry|Health economics}}
[[File:A group of Damas de Rojo.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Chile]]an 'Damas de Rojo' volunteering at their local hospital.]]
The [[health care industry]] incorporates several sectors that are dedicated to providing health care services and products. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations' [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] categorizes health care as generally consisting of hospital activities, medical and dental practice activities, and "other human health activities". The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, or other [[allied health professions]], e.g. in the field of optometry, hydrotherapy, medical massage, yoga therapy, music therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, chiropody, homeopathy, chiropractics, acupuncture, etc.<ref name="UNclass">United Nations. [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=2 ''International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Rev.3.''] New York.</ref> 

In addition, according to industry and market classifications, such as the [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]], health care includes many categories of medical equipment, instruments and services as well as [[biotechnology]], diagnostic laboratories and substances, and drug manufacturing and delivery. 

For example, pharmaceuticals and other medical devices are the leading high technology exports of Europe and the United States.<ref name="Europe">{{cite web|title=The Pharmaceutical Industry in Figures|year=2007|url=http://www.efpia.eu/Content/Default.asp?DocID=7024|accessdate=February 15, 2010|work=[[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]]|format=pdf}}</ref><ref name="PHRMA">{{cite web |url=http://www.phrma.org/files/attachments/2008%20Profile.pdf|title=2008 Annual Report|accessdate= February 15, 2010|work=[[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]]}}</ref> The United States dominates the [[biopharmaceutical]] field, accounting for three-quarters of the world’s biotechnology revenues.<ref name="Europe"/><ref name="EFPIA">{{cite web|url=http://www.efpia.org/content/Default.asp?PageID=388|title=Europe’s competitiveness|work=[[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]]|accessdate= February 15, 2010}}</ref>

===Health care research===
{{See also|Medical research|List of medical journals|List of health care journals|Nursing research|List of nursing journals}} 
The quantity and quality of many health care interventions are improved through the results of science, such as advanced through the [[medical model]] of health which focuses on the eradication of [[illness]] through [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and effective treatment. Many important advances have been made through health research, including [[biomedical research]] and [[pharmaceutical research]]. They form the basis of [[evidence-based medicine]] and [[evidence-based practice]] in health care delivery.

For example, in terms of pharmaceutical research and development spending, [[Europe]] spends a little less than the United States (€22.50bn compared to €27.05bn in 2006). The United States accounts for 80% of the world's research and development spending in biotechnology.<ref name="Europe"/><ref name="EFPIA"/>

In addition, the results of [[health services research]] can lead to greater efficiency and equitable delivery of health care interventions, as advanced through the [[social model of disability|social model of health and disability]], which emphasizes the societal changes that can be made to make population healthier.<ref>{{cite book | author=Bond J. & Bond S. | title=Sociology and Health Care| publisher=Churchill Livingstone| year=1994 | ISBN=0-443-04059-1}}</ref> Results from health services research often form the basis of [[evidence-based policy]] in health care systems. [[Health services research]] is also aided by initiatives in the field of AI for the development of systems of health assessment that are clinically useful, timely, sensitive to change, culturally sensitive, low burden, low cost, involving for the patient and built into standard procedures.<ref name = "campro">

===Health care financing===
{{See also|Health care system|Health policy|Universal health care}}

There are generally five primary methods of funding [[health care systems]]:<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section1243/Section1382/Section1731.htm "Regional Overview of Social Health Insurance in South-East Asia.'] and [http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Social_Health_Insurance_2.pdf "Overview of Health Care Financing."] Retrieved August 18, 2006.</ref>

#general [[taxation]] to the state, county or municipality
#[[social insurance|social health insurance]]
#voluntary or private [[health insurance]]
#[[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket payments]]
#[[donation]]s to health [[charities]]

In most countries, the financing of health care services features a mix of all five models, but the exact distribution varies across countries and over time within countries. In all countries and jurisdictions, there are many topics in the politics and evidence that can influence the decision of a government, private sector business or other group to adopt a specific [[health policy]] regarding the financing structure. 

For example, [[social health insurance]] is where a nation's entire population is eligible for health care coverage, and this coverage and the services provided are regulated. In almost every jurisdiction with a government-funded health care system, a parallel private, and usually for-profit, system is allowed to operate. This is sometimes referred to as [[two-tier health care]] or [[universal health care]].

===Health care administration and regulation===
{{See also|Healthcare provider requisites}}
The [[Health administration|management and administration of health care]] is another sector vital to the delivery of health care services. In particular, the practice of health professionals and operation of health care institutions is typically [[Regulation|regulated]] by national or state/provincial authorities through appropriate regulatory bodies for purposes of [[quality assurance]].<ref>World Health Organization, 2003. ''Quality and accreditation in health care services''. Geneva http://www.who.int/hrh/documents/en/quality_accreditation.pdf</ref>  Most countries have credentialing staff in regulatory boards or [[health department]]s who document the [[Healthcare provider requisites|certification or licensing of health workers]] and their work history.<ref>Tulenko et al., "Framework and measurement issues for monitoring entry into the health workforce." ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health''. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009.</ref>

===Health information technology===
{{see also|Health information technology|Health informatics|eHealth}}
Health information technology (HIT) is “the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making” (Brailer, & Thompson, 2004). Technology is a broad concept that deals with a species' usage and knowledge of tools and crafts, and how it affects a species' ability to control and adapt to its environment. However, a strict definition is elusive; "technology" can refer to material objects of use to humanity, such as machines, hardware or utensils, but can also encompass broader themes, including systems, methods of organization, and techniques. For HIT, technology represents computers and communications attributes that can be networked to build systems for moving health information. Informatics is yet another integral aspect of HIT.
