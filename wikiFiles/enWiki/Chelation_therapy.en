==History==
Chelating agents were introduced into medicine as a result of the use of [[poison gas in World War I]].  The first widely used chelating agent, the organic dithiol compound [[dimercaprol]] (also named British anti-lewisite or BAL), was used as an antidote to the arsenic-based poison gas, [[lewisite]].  The sulphur atoms in BAL's [[mercaptan]] groups strongly bond to the arsenic in lewisite, forming a water-soluble compound that entered the bloodstream, allowing it to be removed from the body by the kidneys and liver. BAL had severe side-effects.

After World War II, a large number of navy personnel suffered from [[lead poisoning]] as a result of their jobs repainting the hulls of ships. The medical use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ([[EDTA]]) as a lead chelating agent was introduced. Unlike BAL, it is a synthetic [[amino acid]] and contains no mercaptans. EDTA side effects were not considered as severe as BAL.

In the 1960s, BAL was modified into [[DMSA]], a related dithiol with far fewer side effects.<ref name=Kalia2005>{{cite journal |author=Kalia K, Flora SJ |title=Strategies for safe and effective therapeutic measures for chronic arsenic and lead poisoning |journal=J Occup Health |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15703449 |doi= 10.1539/joh.47.1|url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/joh/47/1/47_1/_article}}</ref> DMSA quickly replaced both BAL and EDTA, becoming the US [[standard of care]] for the treatment of lead, arsenic, and mercury poisoning, which it remains today. More recently, esters of DMSA have been developed which are reportedly more effective; for example, the monoisoamyl ester (MiADMSA) is reportedly more effective than DMSA at clearing mercury and cadmium.<ref name=Kalia2005/>

Research in the former Soviet Union led to the introduction of [[2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid|DMPS]], another dithiol, as a mercury-chelating agent.  The Soviets also introduced [[Alpha lipoic acid|ALA]], which is transformed by the body into the dithiol dihydrolipoic acid, a mercury- and arsenic-chelating agent.  DMPS has experimental status in the US FDA, while ALA is a common nutritional supplement.

Since the 1970s, iron chelation therapy has been used as an alternative to regular [[Bloodletting|phlebotomy]] to treat excess iron stores in people with [[haemochromatosis]].<ref name='CDC_Hemo'>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemochromatosis/training/treatment/monitoring_treatment.htm |title=Hemochromatosis: Monitoring and Treatment |accessdate=2008-03-29 |date=2007-11-01 |publisher=National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080224192906/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemochromatosis/training/treatment/monitoring_treatment.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-24}}</ref>

Other chelating agents have been discovered.  They all function by making several chemical bonds with metal ions, thus rendering them much less chemically reactive.  The resulting complex is water-soluble, allowing it to enter the bloodstream and be excreted harmlessly.

Calcium-disodium EDTA chelation is approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for treating lead poisoning and heavy metal toxicity.<ref name=NCCAMQA>{{cite web | url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2002/chelation/q-and-a.htm|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) | title=Questions and Answers: The NIH Trial of EDTA Chelation Therapy for Coronary Artery Disease | accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015044954/http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2002/chelation/q-and-a.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-15}}</ref> In 1998, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) pursued the [[American College for Advancement in Medicine]] (ACAM), an organization that promotes "complementary, alternative and integrative medicine" over the claims made regarding the treatment of [[atherosclerosis]] in advertisements for EDTA chelation therapy.

===Medically diagnosed heavy metal poisoning===

Some common chelating agents are [[EDTA]] (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), [[2,3-Dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid|DMPS]] (2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid), TTFD ([[Fursultiamine|thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide]]), and [[DMSA]] (2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid). Calcium-disodium EDTA and DMSA are only approved for the removal of lead by the Food and Drug Administration while DMPS and TTFD are not approved by the FDA. These drugs bind to heavy metals in the body and prevent them from binding to other agents. They are then excreted from the body. The chelating process also removes vital nutrients such as vitamins C and E, therefore these must be supplemented.<ref>Bridges, S. (2006). The promise of chelation. Mothering , 54-61.</ref>

== Unapproved use in alternative medicine ==

Attempts have been made to use it in treating kidney dysfunction, [[calcific band keratopathy]] (an eye disorder), and [[ovarian cancer]].  Currently there is a US [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM) trial being conducted on the chelation therapy's safety and efficacy for patients with  coronary artery disease.<ref name=TACT>NCCAM.[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00044213 Trial to assess chelation therapy]</ref> NCCAM Director Stephen E.

=== Heart disease ===

The use of [[EDTA]] chelation therapy as a treatment for [[atherosclerosis|coronary artery disease]] has not been shown to be effective and is not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref name="AHA">{{cite web |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/96/3/1031.full |title=American Heart Association: Chelation Therapy |accessdate=2008-04-03}}</ref> Several possible mechanisms have been proposed, though none have been scientifically validated.

The final results of TACT, published in November 2012, showed no support for the use of chelation therapy in coronary heart disease, particularly the claims to reduce the need for coronary artery bypass grafting.<ref name=Attwood2012>[http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-trial-to-assess-chelation-therapy-equivocal-as-predicted/ The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy: Equivocal as Predicted], Kimball Attwood, Science Based Medicine, 4 Nov 2012</ref><ref name=Gorski2012>[http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-result-of-the-trial-to-assess-chelation-therapy-tact-as-underwhelming-as-expected/ The result of the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT): As underwhelming as expected], David Gorski, Science Based medicine, 5 Nov 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://newsroom.heart.org/pr/aha/chelation-therapy-doesn-t-alter-240495.aspx | title = Chelation therapy doesn’t alter quality of life in heart attack patients | date = November 4, 2012 | publisher = [[American Heart Association]] | accessdate = November 30, 2012}}</ref>

The [[American Heart Association]] states that there is "no scientific evidence to demonstrate any benefit from this form of therapy" and that the "United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[American College of Cardiology]] all agree with the American Heart Association" that "there have been no adequate, controlled, published scientific studies using currently approved scientific methodology to support this therapy for cardiovascular disease."<ref name="AHA"/> Like other scientific commentators, they note that any improvement among heart patients undergoing chelation therapy can be attributed to the placebo effect and lifestyle changes discovered in conventional medicine but recommended by chelationists; "quitting smoking, losing weight, eating more fruits and vegetables, avoiding foods high in saturated fats and exercising regularly". They note their concern that patients could put off proven treatments for heart disease like drugs or surgery. A 2005 [[systematic review]] found that controlled scientific studies did not support chelation therapy for heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seely DM, Wu P, Mills EJ |title=EDTA chelation therapy for cardiovascular disease: a systematic review |journal=BMC Cardiovasc Disord |volume=5|pages=32 |year=2005 |pmid=16262904 |pmc=1282574 |doi=10.1186/1471-2261-5-32 |url=}}</ref> It found that very small trials and uncontrolled descriptive studies have reported benefits while larger controlled studies have found results no better than placebo.

===Controversy===
The efficacy, safety, and much of the theory behind these alternative practices are disputed by the medical community. In 2001, researchers at the [[University of Calgary]] reported that cardiac patients receiving chelation therapy fared no better than those who received [[placebo]] treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Knudtson ML, Wyse DG, Galbraith PD, ''et al.'' |title=Chelation therapy for ischemic heart disease: a randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=4 |pages=481–6 |year=2002 |pmid=11798370|doi=10.1001/jama.287.4.481}}</ref>

In 1998, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) charged that the web site of the American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM) and a brochure they published had made false or unsubstantiated claims.

The use of chelation therapy by alternative medicine practitioners for behavioural and other disorders is considered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] as there is no proof that it is effective.<ref>[http://www.baam.emich.edu/baamnewsarchive/BAAMbnachelationdeath.htm Behavior Analysis Association], University of Michigan</ref>

Chelation therapy has inherent risks associated with due to the non-specificity of chelating agents for metals. Many essential metals such as: iron (found in [[cytochromes]] and [[hemes]], cobalt (found in [[vitamin b12]], zinc (found in [[carbonic anhydrase]]), copper (found in [[bilirubin oxidase]], and molybdenum (found in [[xanthine oxidase]]), can also be removed by chelating agents. All of these first row transition metals will form square planar or octahedral chelates. The [[chelate effect]] in inorganic chemistry, predicts that these metals will preferably bind to [[polydentate]] ligands such as chelating agents in preference to mono or bi dentate ligands found in proteins and enzymes. Chelating agents not only remove heavier metals but also essential metals and this risk is often overlooked in those seeking to use chelation therapy.{{cn|date=May 2013}}

===Prevalence===
The [[American College for Advancement in Medicine]] estimates that 800,000 patient visits for chelation therapy were made in the United States in 1997.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070204053351/http://www.acam.org/press_releases/20020814.htm|title=Physician Group Backs New NIH Chelation Therapy Study For Heart Disease|publisher=American College for Advancement in Medicine|date=August 14, 2002|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

==Side effects and safety concerns==
As approved pharmaceuticals, the various chelating agents may cause specific side effects if used improperly. When protocols are followed, there is a low occurrence of side effects. DMPS injections may cause skin reactions at the injection site. Other side effects reported include fever, headache, nausea. No death has been linked to DMPS.<ref>Heyl.Dimaval Monograph 2008</ref> The EDTAs when used according to protocol are equally safe. Most important is the correct use and a slow infusion time (1gr/hr or less of NaEDTA or CaEDTA). Side effects are largely avoided if general medical caution is exercised. Most importantly, renal function has to be checked before any chelation substance is used.<ref>Blaurock-Busch E.

Chelation therapy can be hazardous when used inappropriately. In August 2005, chelation therapy conducted by an [[American College for Advancement in Medicine|ACAM]] member killed a 5-year-old boy with autism;<ref name=Atwood2008/> a 3-year-old nonautistic girl died in February 2005, and a nonautistic adult died in August 2003. These deaths were due to [[cardiac arrest]] caused by [[hypocalcemia]] during chelation therapy. In two of the cases hypocalcemia appears to have been caused by the administration of Na2EDTA (Disodium EDTA) and in the third case the type of EDTA was unknown.<ref name=hypocalcemia>Hazards of chelation therapy:

According to protocol, EDTA should not be used in the treatment of children.<ref>Van der Schaar P. Textbook of Clinical Metal Toxicology. IBCMT 2011</ref> 
More than 30 deaths have been recorded in association with IV-administered disodium EDTA since the 1970s.<ref name=Atwood2008/>
