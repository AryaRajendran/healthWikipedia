'''Foreign accent syndrome''' is a very rare medical condition in which patients develop what appears to be a foreign accent. Foreign accent syndrome almost always results from brain damage.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, two cases have been reported of individuals with the condition as a development problem<ref name="Marien">{{Cite PMID|19121521}}</ref> and one associated with severe [[migraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asylum.co.uk/2010/04/20/migraines-give-devon-woman-a-chinese-accent/|title=Severe migraines give Devon woman a bizarre Chinese accent at |publisher=Asylum.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref> <!-- As of 1996, there had been fewer than 15 reported cases of the syndrome.<ref>Kurowski KM, Blumstein SE, Alexander M.

Its symptoms result from distorted articulatory planning and coordination processes. It must be emphasized that the speaker does not suddenly gain a foreign language (vocabulary, syntax, grammar, etc.). Despite a recent unconfirmed news report that a [[Croatian language|Croatian]] speaker has gained the ability to speak fluent [[German language|German]] after emergence from a [[coma]],<ref>{{cite news |title= Croatian teenager wakes from coma speaking fluent German |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/croatia/7583971/Croatian-teenager-wakes-from-coma-speaking-fluent-German.html |work=Telegraph |publisher= Telegraph Media Group |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> there has been no verified case where a patient's foreign language skills have improved after a brain injury. There have been a few reported cases of children and siblings picking up the new accent from someone with foreign accent syndrome.

== Description ==

To the untrained ear, those with the syndrome sound as though they speak their [[native language]]s with a foreign [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]; for example, an [[United States|American]] native speaker of [[English language|English]] might sound as though he spoke with a south-eastern [[British English|English]] accent, or a native British speaker might speak with a New York American accent. However, researchers at [[Oxford University]] have found that certain, specific parts of the brain were injured in some foreign accent syndrome cases, indicating that certain parts of the brain control various [[Language|linguistic]] functions, and damage could result in altered pitch or mispronounced [[syllable]]s, causing speech patterns to be distorted in a non-specific manner.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Contrary to popular beliefs that individuals with FAS exhibit their accent without any effort, these individuals feel as if they are suffering from a speech disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Nick|coauthors=Jill Taylor, Chloe Howe, Jennifer Read|title=Living with foreign accent syndrome: Insider perspectives|journal=Aphasiology|year=2011|month=September|volume=25|issue=9|pages=1053–1068|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/show_html.xqy?uri=/02687038/v25i0009/1053_lwfasip.xml&school=toronto|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}</ref> More recently, there is mounting evidence that the [[cerebellum]], which controls motor function, may be crucially involved in some cases of foreign accent syndrome, reinforcing the notion that speech pattern alteration is mechanical, and thus non-specific.<ref>Mariën P., Verhoeven J., Engelborghs, S., Rooker, S., Pickut, B. A., De Deyn, P.P. (2006). A role for the cerebellum in motor speech planning: evidence from foreign accent syndrome. Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery, 108, 518-522.</ref><ref>Mariën P., Verhoeven J. (2007). Cerebellar involvement in motor speech planning: some further evidence from foreign accent syndrome. Folia Phoniatrica et Logopaedica, 59:4, 210-217.</ref> Thus, the perception of a foreign accent is likely a case of [[pareidolia]] on the part of the listener.

For example, damage to the brain might result in difficulty pronouncing the letter 'r' at the end of words, forcing a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] speaker to use a [[non-rhotic]] accent, even if they have never spoken with one. In the U.S., non-rhoticity is a particularly notable feature of a [[Boston accent]], thus the person might seem to speak with a Boston accent to the casual listener. However, many of the other features of a Boston accent may be wholly missing.

It has been suggested that in order to maintain a sense of normality and flow, someone with the syndrome then augments the accent effect by imitating the rest of the accent. Depending on how important a certain [[phoneme]] is to a person's original accent, he might find speaking in a different accent to be much easier and his usual accent very difficult to consistently pronounce after some motor skills have been lost.

== Occurrences ==

===Early cases===
The condition was first described in 1907 by the French neurologist [[Pierre Marie]],<ref>Marie P. (1907). Presentation de malades atteints d’anarthrie par lesion de l’hemisphere gauche du cerveau. Bulletins et Memoires Societe Medicale des Hopitaux de Paris, 1: 158–160.</ref> and another early case was reported in a [[Czech people|Czech]] study in 1919.<ref>Pick, A. 1919. Über Änderungen des Sprachcharakters als Begleiterscheinung aphasicher Störungen. Zeitschrift für gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie, 45, 230–241.</ref> Other well-known cases of the syndrome have included one that occurred in [[Norway]] in 1941 after a young woman, Astrid L., suffered a head injury from shrapnel during an [[airstrike|air-raid]]. After apparently recovering from the injury, she was left with what sounded like a strong [[German language|German]] accent and was shunned by her fellow Norwegians.<ref>Monrad-Krohn, G. H. "Dysprosody or Altered 'Melody of Language'." Brain 70 (1947): 405-15.</ref>

===Judi Roberts===
Another well-known case is that of Judi Roberts, also known as Tiffany Noel, who was born and raised in [[Indiana]], [[USA]]. In 1999, at the age of 57, Roberts suffered a stroke and, after recovering, her voice spoke with what resembled an English accent, though she never had been to Britain.<ref>{{cite news |title= Stroke gives woman British accent |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3235934.stm |work=BBC News |publisher= BBC|date=2003-11-25 |accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= Angie |last= Lewis |coauthors= Guin, Karen |title= Communicative Disorders Clinic Diagnoses Rare Foreign Accent Syndrome in Sarasota Woman |url= http://www.cohpa.ucf.edu/news/story_comdisclinic.cfm |publisher=University of Central Florida-College of Health and Public Affairs |accessdate=2007-12-29 }}</ref>

===Dallas woman, 2004===
In February 2004 a woman in [[Dallas, Texas]], who had been raised in upstate [[New York]] and had been living in Texas for over 15 years, was given an [[Contrast medium|iodine contrast]] injection for a chest [[CT scan]]. She was allergic to [[iodine]], however, and the resulting allergic reaction resulted in a 24-hour paralysis during which she was unable to speak. As the paralysis wore off she began to speak with a [[Russian (language)|Russian]] sounding accent. Along with the change in her speech, she also began to have seizures. Over time the accent became more normal but became stronger again when she had a seizure. The Foreign Accent Syndrome website at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]][http://www.utdallas.edu/research/FAS/about/samples.html] has sound clips of her speech from before the incident, and after her speech had been affected.

===Linda Walker===
A further case of foreign accent syndrome occurred to Linda Walker, a 60-year-old woman from the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] area of UK.  Again following a stroke, her normal [[Geordie]] accent was transformed and has been variously described as resembling a [[Jamaica]]n, as well as a [[French Canadian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and a [[Slovak language|Slovak]] accent.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nigel |last=Bunyan |title=Geordie wakes after stroke with new accent |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1522997/Geordie-wakes-after-stroke-with-new-accent.html |work=Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=2006-07-04 |accessdate=2007-12-30 }}</ref>  Researchers at Newcastle University were reported to be studying the condition in the hope of finding a cure. Speech therapist Frauke Buerk said: "Foreign accent syndrome is extremely rare. When I discovered Linda had the syndrome it was an opportunity to make some progress in the treatment of the condition because so little has been made. "Although Linda has improved it looks likely that she will be left with an accent. We worked on intonation and the stress she places on different words. Some people have said the accent is Jamaican and others Eastern European. As is often the case though, a lot of accents come together."<ref>[http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/tm_objectid=17325978&method=full&siteid=50081&headline=geordie-to-an-east-european-name_page.html "Geordie to an East European", by Sophie Doughty and Craig Hope, The Evening Chronicle, at chroniclelive.co.uk]</ref> She was interviewed by [[BBC News 24]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Stroke gives woman foreign accent |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tyne/5144300.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=2006-07-04 |accessdate=2007-12-30 }}</ref> and appeared on the ''[[Richard & Judy]]'' show in the [[UK]] in July 2006 to speak of her ordeal.

===Rajesh, India, 2007===
On 14 July 2007 a boy named Rajesh in a remote town in [[India]] suddenly started speaking in English, even though he had never been out of his hometown. He was reported as supposedly being the [[reincarnation]] of an American scientist. This case was poorly understood and was never associated with Foreign Accent Syndrome.  The reported symptoms, however, were quite clear indication. (A video of the boy, speaking in accented English, may be found at the link in the reference).

===Ontario woman, 2008===
In the July 2008 issue of the ''Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences'', researchers from [[McMaster University]] reported a study where a woman from [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], after suffering a stroke, began speaking with what some people described as a [[Newfoundland English|Newfoundland accent]].<ref>{{cite news |first= Raveeni |last=Naidoo |title= A Case of Foreign Accent Syndrome Resulting in Regional Dialect |url=http://cjns.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,17,23;journal,24,81;linkingpublicationresults,1:300307,1 |publisher=the Canadian Journal of Neurological Science |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2008-07-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= CBC News |title=Ontario woman gains East Coast accent following stroke |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2008/07/03/stroke-accent.html |publisher=CBC News |date=2008-07-03 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

===Cindy Lou Romberg===
In 2008 Cindy Lou Romberg of [[Port Angeles, Washington]], who had suffered a brain injury 17 years earlier, developed foreign accent syndrome after a neck adjustment from her [[chiropractor]]. A visit to the hospital ruled out a stroke. Afterwards she spoke with a [[Russian language|Russian]]-sounding accent and even appeared to make the grammatical mistakes of a Russian speaking English, as if English were not her native language. She was featured on the [[Discovery Health Channel]]'s ''Mystery ER'' show on October 26, 2008,<ref>{{cite news |title=Woman's Accent Foreign Even to Her |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/flatpages/video/seattletimesvideo.html?bcpid=1543292770&bclid=1543290205&bctid=1878208652|publisher=The Seattle
Times|date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> and she was also featured on the October 31 edition of ''[[Inside Edition]]''.

===Julie Frazier===
In 2008 Julie Frazier, a woman from [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], with severe [[Familial hemiplegic migraine|Sporadic Hemiplegic Migraine]] developed foreign accent syndrome. After several months of multiple, daily hemiplegic migraine attacks, her accent began sounding [[United Kingdom|British]] to [[Russia]]n, depending on fatigue levels and the perception of the listener. Frazier's case is, to date, the first confirmed association of foreign accent syndrome with a migraine condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101206/LIVING/12060301|title=Health Sentinel: Connecting symptoms finally leads to disorder diagnosis |date= 6 December 2010|publisher= The News-Sentinel}}</ref>

===George Harris===
In May 2009, an 18-year-old English student who suffered a brain haemorrhage while visiting [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], began speaking in a thick [[Russian language|Russian]] accent shortly after his recovery. Harris was in an induced coma for  a week. His English vocabulary had been mildly affected. Foreign Accent Syndrome was not fully diagnosed. He had lived in Russia for a couple of years from the age of two. Harris underwent speech therapy for a year and even then still slurred his speech when fatigued, but was eventually able to graduate from university.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/may/09/experience-george-harris "I woke up with a Russian accent" at guardian.co.uk]</ref>

===Sarah Colwill===
In 2010 another case associated with severe [[migraine]] was publicly reported. Sarah Colwill, a frequent migraine sufferer from [[Devon]] in the [[UK]], experienced a headache so extreme that she had to call an ambulance. When waking in the hospital later, her accent sounded [[Chinese language|Chinese]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/breaking-news/migraine-left-woman-with-chinese-accent/story-e6frg12u-1225855831038|title=Migraine left woman with Chinese accent|date=20 April 2010|accessdate=20 April 2010|publisher=The Sunday Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,591259,00.html?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a4:g4:r1:c0.000000:b0:z5|title=Severe Migraine Leaves English Woman with Chinese Accent|date=19 April 2010|accessdate=20 April 2010|publisher=Fox News}}</ref>

===Kay Russell===
In September 2010, Kay Russell, a 49-year-old woman from Gloucestershire UK, lay down due to a migraine and woke up with/suffering from FAS. Her accent is generally described as sounding French, though it has also been categorized it as sounding Eastern European or Russian.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/sep/14/woman-awoke-migraine-french-accent | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Woman's migraine gave her French accent | first=Steven | last=Morris | date=2010-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/migraine-gives-woman-french-accent-2079032.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Migraine gives woman French accent | date=2010-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Grandmother goes to bed with migraine... and wakes up speaking with a French accent | date = 2010-09-15 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1311835/Gran-Kay-Russell-goes-bed-migraine-wakes-French-accent.html | work = The Daily Mail | accessdate = 2010-09-16 | location=London}}</ref>

===Karen Butler===
On May 5, 2011 ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reported the case of Karen Butler, a woman from [[Newport, Oregon]], who emerged from oral surgery with an accent which some describe as sounding [[Irish language|Irish]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/05/foreign-accent-syndrome_n_858101.html?icid=main%7Chtmlws-main-n%7Cdl6%7Csec1_lnk3%7C212290 |title=Woman Gets Oral Surgery, Wakes Up With Irish Accent |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2011-06-05 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref> while other sources have indicated that her new accent had an [[Eastern European]] sound.<ref>{{cite web|author=POSTED: 8:28 am EDT May 6, 2011 |url=http://www.wmtw.com/r/27798974/detail.html |title=Woman Gets New Accent After Dentist Visit |publisher=Wmtw.com |date=2011-05-06 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref>

===George Michael===
In July 2012 it was claimed that singer [[George Michael]], when waking from a coma caused by pneumonia in 2011, spoke with a [[West Country dialects|West Country British]] accent instead of his original [[North London]] British accent.<ref>[http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Stijl/Society/344462/George-Michael-spreekt-met-ander-accent-na-coma.htm&prev=/search%3Fq%3DGeorge%2BMichael%2Bspreekt%2Bmet%2Bander%2Baccent%2Bna%2Bcoma%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D857%26bih%3D373%26prmd%3Dimvnso&sa=X&ei=G84LUM7DPOe50QW876WoCg&sqi=2&ved=0CFoQ7gEwAQ "George Michael speaks with different accent after coma" at [http://www.elsevier.nl] (English translation from Dutch, retrieved 22 July 2012.</ref>
