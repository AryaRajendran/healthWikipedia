'''MindFreedom International''' is an international [[coalition]] of over one hundred [[grassroots]] groups and thousands of individual members from fourteen nations. Based in the [[USA]], it was founded in 1990 to advocate against [[Involuntary treatment|forced medication]], [[medical restraint]]s, and involuntary [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. Its stated mission is to protect the [[right]]s of people who have been labeled with [[psychiatric]] [[mental disorder|disorders]]. A majority of MindFreedom members are thought to identify themselves as survivors of [[human rights violations]] in the [[mental health]] system; membership, however, is open to anyone who supports [[human rights]], including [[mental health professional]]s, [[advocate]]s, [[activist]]s and family members.<ref>[http://www.mindfreedom.org/mfi-faq/intro-FAQs/ Introductory FAQ's about MFI — MFI Portal]</ref> MindFreedom has been recognized by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] as a human rights [[NGO]] with [[Consultative Status|Consultative Roster Status]].<ref>[http://esa.un.org/coordination/ngo/new/index.asp?page=viewOrg&nr=1583 United Nations - Department of Economic and Social Affairs - NGO Section]</ref>

==Origins and purpose==

MindFreedom International is rooted in the [[psychiatric survivors movement]],<ref name="challenge">{{Cite book| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| isbn = 978-1-119-99612-5| last = Corrigan| first = Patrick W.| coauthors = David Roe, Hector W.

That year the Support Coalition International (SCI) was formed. In 2005 the SCI changed its name to MFI with [[David W. Oaks]] as its director.<ref name="Oaks letter"/> SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and [[protest]] in [[New York City]], in May, 1990, at the same time as (and directly outside of) the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] annual meeting.<ref>[http://www.mindfreedom.org/about-us About Us — MFI Portal]</ref>

Many of the members of MFI, who feel that their human rights were violated by the mental health system, refer to themselves as '[[psychiatric survivor]]s'.<ref name="challenge"/> MFI is a contemporary and active coalition of grassroots groups which are carrying forward the historical tradition of survivor opposition to coercive psychiatry.<ref name="challenge"/> It does not define itself as an antipsychiatry organization and its members point to the role which 'compassionate' psychiatrists have played in MFI.<ref name="Oaks letter"/> Activists within the coalition have been drawn from both left and right wing of politics.<ref name="Oaks letter"/>

MFI functions as a forum for its thousands of members to express their views and experiences, to form support networks and to organize activist campaigns in support of human rights in psychiatry.<ref name="Oaks letter"/><ref name="mad at school 10"/> The coalition regards the psychiatric practices of 'unscientific labeling, forced drugging, solitary confinement, restraints, involuntary commitment, electroshock' as human rights violations.<ref name="Oaks letter"/><ref>See also {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.51.3.389| volume = 51| issue = 3| pages = 389| last = Oaks| first = David| title = No forced drugging| journal = Psychiatric Services| accessdate = 2011-08-05| date = 2000-03-01| url = http://ps.psychiatryonline.org}}</ref>

In 2003 eight MFI members, led by David W. Oaks, went on hunger strike to publicize a series of "challenges" they had set to the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the [[Surgeon General of the United States|US Surgeon General]] and the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] (NAMI). Prominent among their challenges was that unambiguous proof that mental illness is brain disorder should be produced. By sustaining the hunger-strike for more than one month MFI forced the APA and NAMI to enter into a debate with them on this and other issues.<ref name="challenge"/>

MindFreedom describes their Shield Program as "an all for one and one for all" network of members.  When a registered member is receiving (or is being considered for) involuntary psychiatric treatment, an alert is sent to the MindFreedom Solidarity Network on that person's behalf. Members of the network are then expected to participate in organized, constructive, [[Nonviolence|nonviolent actions]]---e.g., political action, publicity and media alerts, passive resistance, etc.---to stop or prevent the forced treatment.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Fritz| first = Mark| title = Strong Medicine| work = Wall Street Journal| accessdate = 2011-08-04| date = 2006-02-01}} {{Cite news| last = Karnowski| first = Steve| title = Minnesota patient wants right to refuse electroshocks| work = Associated Press| accessdate = 2011-08-04| date = 2009-05-10| url = http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf/ap-on-ray-sandford
