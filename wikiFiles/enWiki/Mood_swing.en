[[Image:P culture.svg|thumb|right|Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme mood swings, usually between mania and depression]]
A '''mood swing''' is an extreme or rapid change in [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]. Such mood swings can play a positive part in promoting problem solving and in producing flexible forward planning.<ref>Peter Salovey et al, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (2004) p. 1974</ref> However, when mood swings are so strong that they are disruptive, they may be the main part of a [[bipolar disorder]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/emotional_health/mental_health/disorders_bipolar.shtml</ref>

==Overview==

===Speed and extent===
Mood swings are universal, varying from the microscopic to the wild oscillations of [[manic depression]],<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 164</ref> so that a continuum can be traced from normal struggles around [[self-esteem]], through [[cyclothymia]], up to a depressive disease.<ref>Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 406</ref> However most people's mood swings remain in the mild to moderate range of emotional ups and downs.<ref>Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1995) p. 57</ref>

The duration of mood swings also varies. They may last a few hours - ''ultradian'' - or extend over days - ''ultrarapid'': clinicians maintain that only when four continuous days of hypomania, or seven days of mania, occur, is a diagnosis of bipolar disorder justified.<ref>S, Nassir Ghaemi, ''Mood Disorder'' (2007) p. 243-4</ref>

In such cases, mood swings can extend over several days, even weeks: these episodes may consist of rapid alternation between feelings of depression and euphoria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hockenbury|first=Don and Sandra|title=Discovering Psychology Fifth Edition|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4292-1650-0|page=549}}</ref>

==Causes==

Changes in a person's energy level, [[sex drive]], [[sleep pattern]]s, self-esteem, concentration, drug or alcohol use can be signs of an oncoming mood disorder.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/mood-swings "Bipolar Mood Swings, Stabilizers, Triggers, and Mania."] ''WebMD''. WebMD, 03 May 0000. Web. 29 Feb. 2012.</ref>

Many different things might trigger mood swings, from unhealthy diet or life style to drug abuse or hormonal imbalance.<ref>[http://www.nativeremedies.com/ailment/violent-mood-swings-info.html Natural Mood Stabilizers...]</ref>

A major cause of mood swings is hyperactivity sometimes accompanied by inattentiveness, symptoms associated with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. If the mood swing is not associated with a mood disorder, treatments are harder to assign. Most commonly, however, mood swings are the result of dealing with stressful and/or unexpected situations in daily life.<ref>[http://www.nativeremedies.com/ailment/violent-mood-swings-info.html Natural Mood Stabilizers...]</ref>

===Brain chemistry===
If a person has an abnormal level of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s (NTs) in their brain, it may result in having mood swings or a mood disorder.<ref>[http://www.turner-white.com/pdf/hp_sep05_mood.pdf ''Neurobiology of Mood Disorders.'']</ref>  [[Serotonin]] is a neurotransmitter in the brain that is involved with sleep, moods, and emotional states.  A slight imbalance of this NT could result in depression.  [[Norepinephrine]] is a neurotransmitter that is involved with learning, memory, and physical arousal.  Like serotonin, an imbalance of norepinephrine may also result in depression.<ref>[http://www.integrativepsychiatry.net/neurotransmitter.html ''The Four Major Neurotransmitters.'']</ref>

==Treatment==

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] recommends using ''emotional dampeners'' to break the self-reinforcing tendencies of either manic or depressive mood swings.<ref>Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) p. 63</ref>

Exercise, treats, seeking out small (and easily attainable) triumphs, and using vicarious distractions like reading or TV, are among the techniques found to be regularly used by people in breaking depressive swings.<ref>Goleman, p. 73-4</ref>

Learning to bring oneself ''down'' from [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] states of mind, or ''up'' from exaggerated shame states, is part of taking a proactive approach to managing one's own moods and varying sense of self-esteem.<ref>Terence Real, ''I Don't Want to Talk About It'' (1997) p. 279</ref>
