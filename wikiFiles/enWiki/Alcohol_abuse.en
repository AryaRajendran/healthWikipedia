'''Alcohol abuse''', as described in the [[DSM-IV]], is a psychiatric diagnosis describing the recurring use of [[alcoholic beverage]]s despite its negative consequences.<ref name="pubs.niaaa">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two types of alcoholics: those who have anti social and pleasure-seeking tendencies, and those who are anxiety-ridden- people who are able to go without drinking for long periods of time but are unable to control themselves once they start.<ref name="Neil R 2010, p.572">Neil R.Carlson, C.Donald Heth.

[[File:HarmCausedByDrugsTable.svg|thumb|Results of the [[Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs|ISCD]] 2010 study ranking the levels of damage caused by drugs, in the opinion of drug-harm experts. When harm to self and others is summed, alcohol was the most harmful of all drugs considered, scoring 72%.]]
Alcohol abuse is a pattern of drinking that results in harm to one’s health, [[interpersonal relationships]], or ability to work. According to Gelder, Mayou & Geddes (2005) alcohol abuse is linked with [[suicide]]. They state the risk of suicide is high in older men who have a history of drinking, as well as those suffering from depression. Certain [[wikt:Special:Search/manifestation|manifestations]] of alcohol abuse include failure to fulfill responsibilities at work, school, or home; drinking in dangerous situations, including the operation of a motor vehicle; legal concerns associated with alcohol use; and continued drinking despite problems that are caused or worsened by drinking. Alcohol abuse can lead to [[alcohol dependence]].<ref name="DSM-IV">[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV), 4th edition, Text Revision. Washington, DC: [[American Psychiatric Association]]; 2000.</ref> Proposed changes to the [[DSM-IV]] to the [[DSM-5]] are expected to combine alcohol abuse with alcohol dependence to create one unified disorder, [[alcohol use disorder]] (AUD), that would include graded clinical severity from moderate to severe with at least 2 criteria to make diagnoses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Proposed Revision&nbsp;— APA DSM-V|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=247#|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> For adolescents, the [[DSM-5]] proposes that diagnoses meeting 2 or 3 criteria would be similar to alcohol abuse while meeting over 4 criteria would be equivalent to alcohol dependence when compared to the [[DSM-IV]].

Alcohol abuse has both short-term and long-term risks. If a person drives while drunk or regularly consuming [[binge drink]]s (more than five standard drinks in one drinking session), they are considered to have been involved in alcohol abuse. Short-term abuses of alcohol include, but are not limited to, violence, injuries, [[unprotected sex]]ual activities and, additionally, social and financial problems.<ref name="Michaud-2007"/>

The older adult population (over 65 years) is frequently overlooked when discussing alcohol abuse. A smaller volume of consumed alcohol has a greater impact on the older adult than it does on a younger individual. As a result the American Geriatrics Society recommends for an older adult with no known risk factors less than one drink a day or fewer than two drinks per occasion regardless of gender,<ref>Dufour, M. C, Archer, L., & Gordis, E. (1992). Alcohol and the elderly. Clinics in Geriatric Medicine, 8(1), 127-141.</ref><ref>Moos, R. H., Schutte, K. K., Moos, B., & Moos, B. S. (2009).

===Binge drinking===
{{Main|Binge drinking}}
In the USA, [[binge drinking]] is defined as consuming more than five units in men and four units in women. It increases chances for [[vandalism]], fights, violent behaviours, injuries, [[drunk driving]], trouble with [[police]], negative health, social, economic, or legal consequences to occur.<ref name="Courtney-2009">{{Cite journal |last1=Courtney |first1=Kelly E |last2=Polich |first2=John |title=Binge drinking in young adults: Data, definitions, and determinants |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=142–56 |month=January |year=2009 |doi=10.1037/a0014414 |pmid=19210057 |pmc=2748736}}</ref> Binge drinking is also associated with neurocognitive deficits of frontal lobe processing and impaired working memory as well as delayed auditory and verbal memory deficits.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/>

It is believed that one way to prevent binge drinking is to raise the legal drinking age.<ref name="Babor-">{{Cite journal | last1 = Babor | first1 = TF. | last2 = Aguirre-Molina | first2 = M. | last3 = Marlatt | first3 = GA. | last4 = Clayton | first4 = R. | title = Managing alcohol problems and risky drinking | journal = Am J Health Promot | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 98–103 | month =  | year =  1999| doi =  | pmid = 10724728 }}</ref>

==Symptoms and signs==
{{Main|Long-term effects of alcohol}}
Individuals with an alcohol use disorder will often complain of difficulty with interpersonal relationships, problems at work or school, and legal problems; additionally patients do complain of irritability and [[insomnia]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Alcohol abuse is also an important cause of [[Fatigue (medical)#Chronic fatigue|chronic fatigue]].<ref name="Avellaneda Fernández-2009">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Avellaneda Fernández | first1 = A. | last2 = Pérez Martín | first2 = A. | last3 = Izquierdo Martínez | first3 = M. | last4 = Arruti Bustillo | first4 = M. | last5 = Barbado Hernández | first5 = FJ. | last6 = de la Cruz Labrado | first6 = J. | last7 = Díaz-Delgado Peñas | first7 = R. | last8 = Gutiérrez Rivas | first8 = E. | last9 = Palacín Delgado | first9 = C. | title = Chronic fatigue syndrome: aetiology, diagnosis and treatment | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 9 Suppl 1| pages = S1 | month =  | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1186/1471-244X-9-S1-S1 | pmid = 19857242  | pmc = 2766938 }}</ref>

Signs of alcohol abuse are related to alcohol's effects on organ systems. However, while these findings are often present, they are not necessary to make a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. Signs of alcohol abuse shows its drastic effects on the central nervous system acutely include inebriation and poor judgment; chronic anxiety, irritability, and insomnia. Alcohol's effects on the liver include elevated liver function tests (classically AST is at least twice as high as ALT). Prolonged use leads to [[cirrhosis]] and failure of the liver. With cirrhosis, patients develop an inability to process hormones and toxins. The skin of a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis can feature cherry angiomas, palmar erythema and&nbsp;— in fulminent liver failure&nbsp;— jaundice and ascities. The derangements of the endocrine system lead to gynecomastia. Inability to process toxins leads to hepatic encephalopathy.

Binge drinking is associated with individuals reporting fair to poor health compared to non-binge drinking individuals and which may progressively worsen over time. Alcohol also causes impairment in a person's critical thinking. Person's ability to reason in stressful situation is compromised, and they seem very inattentive to what is going on around them.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/> [[Social skills]] are significantly impaired in people suffering from [[alcoholism]] due to the [[neurotoxic]] effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the [[prefrontal cortex]] area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and [[theory of mind]] deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers.<ref name="pmid18412750">{{cite journal |author=Uekermann J, Daum I |title=Social cognition in alcoholism: a link to prefrontal cortex dysfunction? |journal=Addiction |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=726–35 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18412750 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02157.x |url=}}</ref>
Patients who abuse alcohol are less likely to survive critical illness. Research conducted at Ohio State University Medical Center found that patients who suffer from alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal are at a much higher risk for having ''sepsis'' and were more likely to die during hospitalization.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Alcohol Abuse | journal=Juvenile Justice Digest | date=2007-01-31 | issn=0094-2413 | volume=35 | issue=2 | page=7 }}</ref>

Alcohol abuse causes neuroinflammation and leads to [[myelin]] disruptions and [[white matter]] loss; the developing adolescent brain is at increased risk of brain damage and other long lasting alterations to the brain.<ref name="Alfonso-Loeches">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Alfonso-Loeches | first1 = S. | last2 = Guerri | first2 = C. | title = Molecular and behavioral aspects of the actions of alcohol on the adult and developing brain | journal = Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–47 | month =  | year =  2011| doi = 10.3109/10408363.2011.580567 | pmid = 21657944 }}</ref> Adolescents with an alcohol use disorder damage the [[hippocampal]], [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[temporal lobe]]s.<ref name="Nixon-2010" /> Children aged 16 and under who consume alcohol heavily display symptoms of [[conduct disorder]].

===Association with violence===
Alcohol abuse is significantly associated with suicide and violence. Alcohol is the most significant health concern in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] communities because of very high rates of [[alcohol dependence]] and abuse; up to 80 percent of suicides and 60 percent of violent acts are a result of alcohol abuse in Native American communities.<ref name="Jiwa-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Jiwa | first1 = A. | last2 = Kelly | first2 = L. | last3 = Pierre-Hansen | first3 = N. | title = Healing the community to heal the individual: literature review of aboriginal community-based alcohol and substance abuse programs | url = http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/content/full/54/7/1000 | journal =[[Canadian Family Physician|Can Fam Physician]] | volume = 54 | issue = 7 | pages = 1000–1000.e7 | month = Jul | year = 2008| pmid = 18625824 | pmc = 2464791 }}</ref>

==Causes==
The reason of alcohol abuse is complex. It is related to economic and biological origins and is associated with adverse health consequences.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McArdle|first=Paul|title=Alcohol abuse in adolescents|date=27|year=2008|month=Feb.|url=http://adc.bmj.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/content/93/6/524|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref> Peer pressure influences individuals to abuse alcohol; however most of the influence of peers is due to inaccurate perceptions of the risks of alcohol abuse.<ref name="Moreira-2009"/> According to  Gelder, Mayou and Geddes (2005)  easy accessibility of  alcohol  is one of the reasons people engage in  alcohol abuse as this substance  is  easily obtained in  shops. Another influencing factor among adolescents and college students are the perceptions of social norms for drinking; people will often drink more to keep up with their peers because they believe that their peers drink more than they actually do or that they expect to drink more given the context (e.g. sporting event, fraternity party, etc.).<ref name=Lewis-2011>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Melissa|coauthors=Litt, D. M., Blayney, J. A., Lostutter, T. W., Granato, H., Kilmer, J. R., & Lee, C. M.|title=They drink how much and where? Normative perceptions by drinking contexts and their association to college students' alcohol consumption|journal=[[Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs]]|year=2011|volume=72|issue=5|pages=844–853}}</ref>  This perception of norms results in higher alcohol consumption than is normal.
Alcohol abuse is also associated with acculturation, because social and cultural factors such as an ethnic group’s norms and attitudes can influence alcohol abuse.<ref>''Alcohol Abuse and Ethnicity''. AAOHN Journal. Volume 53(4), April 2005, p 152–155</ref>
The instantaneous effect of drugs releases the neurotransmitter dopamine which acts as reinforcement for the behavior.<ref name="Neil R 2010, p.572"/> Laboratory studies of ad-lib consumption of alcohol by alcoholics have often indicated that continued drinking is associated with self-reports of increased anxiety and depression<ref>David B. Abrams and G. Terence Wilson (1979) Effects of Alcohol on Social Anxiety in Women:Cognitive Versus Physiological Processes. Journal of Abnormal Psychology. Vol. 88 No. 2 Pg 161-173</ref>

It is also possible that the person abusing alcohol is doing so because they find the pharmacological effects of the alcohol provides relief from a non-diagnosed psychological problem, such as anxiety or depression. In these patients, the abuse of the alcohol is not a disease in and of itself, but rather a treatment for disease (albeit a poor treatment). Therefore, treating the alcoholism without discovering and properly treating the underlying disorder that caused the alcoholism will necessarily increase the chances of relapse and various other stresses and harms to the patient's life.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

The numbing effects of alcohol and narcotics can become a coping strategy for traumatized people who are unable to disassociate. However, the altered or intoxicated state of the abuser prevents the full consciousness necessary for healing.<ref> |last=Herman |first=Judith | title=Trauma and Recovery:  The Aftermath of Violence - from domestic abuse to political terror (pp 44-45) </ref>

Preventing or reducing the harm has been called for via increased taxation of alcohol, stricter regulation of alcohol advertising and the provision of brief Interventions. Brief Interventions for alcohol abuse reduce the incidence of unsafe sex, sexual violence, unplanned pregnancy and, likely, [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] transmission.<ref name="Chersich-2010">{{Cite journal | last1 = Chersich | first1 = MF. | last2 = Rees | first2 = HV. | title = Causal links between binge drinking patterns, unsafe sex and HIV in South Africa: its time to intervene | journal = Int J STD AIDS | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–7 | month = Jan | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1258/ijsa.2000.009432 | pmid = 20029060 }}</ref> Information and education on social norms and the harms associated with alcohol abuse delivered either via the internet or face to face has been found to result in a decrease in harmful drinking behaviours in young people.<ref name="Moreira-2009"/>

According to the European law, individuals who are suffering from alcohol abuse or other related problems cannot be given a license, or if present of a license cannot get it renwed. This is a way to prevent individuals driving under the influence of alcohol.<ref>B.M.R. Appenzeller; S. Schneider; M. Yegles; A. Maul; R. Wennig. "Drugs and chronic alcohol abuse in drivers" Forensic Science International (December 2005), 155 (2-3), pg. 83-90.</ref>

Withdrawal of alcohol leads to over activity of neural function because the use of alcohol leads to the depression of the central nervous system. This results in hallucinations and seizures (Schreiber, 2001).<ref>Schreiber, Andrea. "Alcoholism." Aoral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontics 92.2 (2001): 127. Print.</ref>

An individual's need for alcohol can depend on their family's history status with the use of alcohol. For instance, if it is discovered that their family history with alcohol has a  strong correlation, there might be a need for education to be set in place for the prevention of it so that it is less likely to occur in their family again (Powers, 2007).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Powers A, Rebecca  | year = 2007 | title = Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention | url = | journal = A Journal of Continuing Psychiatric Education- Psychiatric Annals'' | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 349–358 }}</ref>

However, it has been established within 10 studies that those suffering through alcohol abuse tend to have family members who try to provide help. In many of these occasions the family members would try to help the individual change or to help improve the individuals lifestyle.<ref>http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/13482721438326488881.pdf</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment and interventions among youth should focus on eliminating or reducing the effects of adverse childhood experiences, like childhood maltreatment, since these are common risk factors contributing to the development of alcohol abuse.<ref name=Dube-2002>{{cite journal|last=Dube|first=Shanta R|coauthors=Anda, Robert F, Felitti, Vincent J, Edwards, Valerie J, Croft, Janet B|title=Adverse childhood experiences and personal alcohol abuse as an adult|journal=Addictive Behaviors|date=NaN undefined NaN|year=2002|volume=27|issue=5|pages=713–725|doi=10.1016/S0306-4603(01)00204-0|pmid=12201379}}</ref>  Approaches like [[contingency management]] and [[motivational interviewing]] have shown to be effective means of treating substance abuse in impulsive adolescents by focusing on positive rewards and redirecting them towards healthier goals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=GULLO|first=M|coauthors=DAWE, S|title=Impulsivity and adolescent substance use: Rashly dismissed as "all-bad"?|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|year=2008|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1507–1518|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.06.003}}</ref> Educating youth about what is considered heavy drinking along with helping them focus on their own drinking behaviors has been shown to effectively change their perceptions of drinking and could potentially help them to avoid alcohol abuse.<ref name="Agostinelli -2005">{{cite journal|last=Agostinelli|first=Gina|coauthors=Grube, Joel|title=Effects of Presenting Heavy Drinking Norms on Adolescents?

Completely stopping the use of alcohol is the ideal goal of treatment. This is called abstinence. A strong social network and family support are important in achieving this.

Some people who abuse alcohol may be able to simply reduce the amount they drink. This is called drinking in moderation. If this method does not work, the person may need to try to quit drinking completely.

In the clinics when a patient comes in with a history of alcohol abuse the doctor must use the CAGE questionnaire approach to determine if the alcohol use is a problem for the patient.If two or more of the following questions are warranted then alcohol abuse is considered and further treatment options are explored.  The CAGE questionnaire consists of four questions; Have you ever felt the need to cut down on drinking, Have you ever felt annoyed by criticism of drinking, Have you ever felt guilty about drinking, and Have you ever taken a drink first thing in the morning as an eye opener.<ref>Bickley, L.S; Bates: Physical Examination and History Taking Sixth Edition; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2006</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Alcohol abuse is said to be most common in people aged between 15 and 24 years:<ref name="Moreira-2009"/> however this particular study of 7275 college students in England collected no data about other age groups or other countries.

Causes of alcohol abuse are complex and are likely the combination of many factors from coping with stress to childhood development. [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|The US Department of Health & Human Services]] identifies several factors influencing adolescent alcohol use such as risk-taking, expectancies, sensitivity and tolerance, personality and psychiatric comorbidity, hereditary factors, and environmental aspects.<ref name="pubs.niaaa" /> Studies show that [[Child abuse|child maltreatment]] such as neglect, physical, and/or sexual abuse,<ref name=Dube-2002 /> as well as having parents with alcohol abuse problems,<ref>{{cite journal|last=LIEB|first=R.|coauthors=MERIKANGAS, K.

According to Shin, Edwards, Heeren, & Amodeo (2009) underage drinking is more prevalent among teens that experienced multiple types of childhood maltreatment regardless of parental alcohol abuse, putting them at a greater risk for alcohol use disorders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shin|first=Sunny Hyucksun|title=Relationship between Multiple Forms of Maltreatment by a Parent or Guardian and Adolescent Alcohol Use|work=American Journal on Addictions|coauthors=Edwards, Erika, Heeren, Timothy, Amodeo, Maryann|pages=226–234|doi=10.1080/10550490902786959|year=2009}}</ref> Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of alcohol use disorders depending on age.

===Pregnancy===
Alcohol abuse among pregnant women causes their fetus to develop [[Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]]. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the pattern of physical abnormalities and the impairment of mental development which is seen with increasing frequency amongst children with alcoholic mothers.<ref>Landesman-Dwyer, Sharon. "Maternal drinking and Pregnancy outcome". 1982. Applied Research in Mental Retardation. Vol.3 p. 240-263.</ref> Alcohol exposure in developing fetus can result in slowed development of the fetal brain resulting in severe retardation or death.  Surviving infants may suffer severe abnormalities such as abnormal eyes, fissures, lips and incomplete cerebella. Some infants may develop lung disease. Experts suggest that pregnant women take no more than one unit of alcohol per day. However, other organizations advise complete abstinence from alcohol while pregnant.<ref name="Batra-2005">{{Cite journal | last1 = Batra | first1 = S. | last2 = Wrigley | first2 = ECW | title = Alcohol: The teratogen | url = http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01443615/v25i0003/308_att | journal = [[Obstetrics & Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics & Gynecology]] | pages =308–309  | month = April | year = 2005  }}</ref> It is even possible that the baby throughout pregnancy will develop heart defects such as ventricular septal defect or atrial septal defect

==Prognosis==
Alcohol abuse during adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), may lead to long-term changes in the brain which leaves them at increased risk of [[alcoholism]] in later years; [[genetics|genetic]] factors also influence age of onset of alcohol abuse and risk of alcoholism.<ref name=eattrfad>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/164576.php |title=Early Age At First Drink May Modify Tween/Teen Risk For Alcohol Dependence |date=21 September 2009 |publisher=[[Medical News Today]] }}</ref> For example, about 40 percent of those who begin drinking alcohol before age 15 develop alcohol dependence in later life, whereas only 10 percent of those who did not begin drinking until 20 years or older developed an alcohol problem in later life.<ref name="Grant-1997">{{Cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = BF. | last2 = Dawson | first2 = DA. | title = Age at onset of alcohol use and its association with DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence: results from the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey | journal = J Subst Abuse | volume = 9 | pages = 103–10 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9494942 | doi = 10.1016/S0899-3289(97)90009-2 }}</ref> It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.<ref name="Schwandt-2010">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.alcohol.2009.09.034 | last = Schwandt | first = M.L. |coauthors= S.G.

College/university students who are heavy binge drinkers (three or more times in the past two weeks) are 19 times more likely to be diagnosed with alcohol dependence, and 13 times more likely to be diagnosed with alcohol abuse compared to non-heavy episodic drinkers, though the direction of causality remains unclear. Occasional binge drinkers (one or two times in past two weeks), were found to be four times more likely to be diagnosed with alcohol abuse or dependence compared to non-heavy episodic drinkers.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/>

==Society and culture==
The introduction of [[alcopops]], which are flavoured alcoholic drinks, which have a sweet and pleasant taste, was responsible in [[Sweden]] for half of the increase in alcohol abuse in 15-16 year olds in a survey. In the case of girls the alcopops, which disguise the taste of alcohol, were responsible for two thirds of the increase. The introduction of alcopops to Sweden was a result of [[Sweden]] joining the [[European Union]] and adopting the entire [[European Union law]].<ref name="Romanus-2000">{{Cite journal | last1 = Romanus | first1 = G. | title = Alcopops in Sweden--a supply side initiative | journal = Addiction | volume = 95 Suppl 4 | issue =  12s4| pages = S609–19 | month = Dec | year = 2000 | pmid = 11218355 |doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.95.12s4.12.x}}</ref> Alcohol abuse is highly associated with adolescent suicide.

===Societal and economic costs===
Alcohol abuse is associated with many accidents, fights, driving offenses and unprotected sex. Alcohol is responsible in the world for 1.8 million deaths and results in disability in approximately 58.3 million people. Approximately 40 percent of the 58.3 million people disabled through alcohol abuse are disabled due to alcohol-related neuropsychiatric disorders.<ref name="Moreira-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Moreira | first1 = MT. | last2 = Smith | first2 = LA. | last3 = Foxcroft | first3 = D. | last4 = Moreira | first4 = Maria Teresa | title = Social norms interventions to reduce alcohol misuse in university or college students | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 3 | pages = CD006748 | month =  | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006748.pub2 | pmid = 19588402 | editor1-last = Moreira | editor1-first = Maria Teresa }}</ref> In South Africa, where HIV infection is epidemic, alcohol abusers exposed themselves to double the risk of this infection.

In the [[United States]], many people are arrested for [[Driving under the influence|drinking and driving]]. Also, people under the influence of alcohol commit a large portion of various violent crimes, including [[Child abuse|child abuse]], [[Homicide|homicide]] and [[Suicide|suicide]]. In addition, people of minority groups are affected by alcohol-related problems disproportionately, with the exception of [[Asian American|Asian Americans]].<ref>Alcoholism. (2013). Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 1-2.</ref>

Also, according to studies of present and former alcoholic drinkers in Canada, 20% of them are aware that their drinking has negatively impacted their lives in various vital areas including finances, work and relationships.<ref>"Send Us a Message."

Alcohol misuse costs the [[National Health Service]] ([[UK]]) three billion pounds sterling per year and the cost to employers is 6.4 billion pounds sterling per year. These figures do not include the crime and social problems associated with alcohol misuse. The number of women regularly drinking alcohol has almost caught up with men.<ref name="Dooldeniya-2007">{{Cite journal | last1 = Dooldeniya | first1 = MD. | last2 = Khafagy | first2 = R. | last3 = Mashaly | first3 = H. | last4 = Browning | first4 = AJ. | last5 = Sundaram | first5 = SK. | last6 = Biyani | first6 = CS. | title = Lower abdominal pain in women after binge drinking | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/335/7627/992 | journal = BMJ | volume = 335 | issue = 7627 | pages = 992–3 | month = Nov | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39247.454005.BE | pmc = 2072017 | pmid = 17991983 }}</ref>
