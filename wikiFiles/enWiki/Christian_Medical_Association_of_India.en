'''Christian Medical Association of India (CMAI)''' is a forum, a gathering place, an association and eventually, a potent instrument to bring about social reform.

It is a fellowship of doctors, nurses, administrators, chaplains and allied health professionals and we work on various fronts, in diverse sectors, to bring relief from pain and the joy of health among India’s poorest and most deprived sections of society&mdash;people whom the rest of the world forgot.

CMAI believes that the Biblical faith calls us and commands us to a Mission to proclaim the Gospel and to heal the sick, the suffering and the downtrodden. The organization strives to make health, healing and wholeness a reality to all.

It also assists and supports the Church and its healthcare institutions to rededicate themselves to this mission. It encourages them to broaden their vision, to enthuse them to adopt a wider understanding of the concept of health, healing and wholeness and to urge them to go beyond community health to healing communities.

==Background==
The history of CMAI dates back to 1905 when a group of missionaries serving in India, set up the Medical Missionary Association (MMA), a forum for supporting each other professionally and spiritually. In 1926, it was renamed as Christian Medical Association of India, and has grown in strength by keeping pace with the changing healthcare needs in this country. CMAI has done pioneering work in several areas, including leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS.
