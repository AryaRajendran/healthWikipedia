A '''vasovagal episode''' or '''vasovagal response''' or '''vasovagal attack'''<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000958086|vasovagal attack}}</ref> (also called '''neurocardiogenic syncope''') is a [[malaise]] mediated by the [[vagus nerve]]. When it leads to [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] or "fainting", it is called a '''vasovagal syncope''', which is the most common type of fainting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vasovagal-syncope/DS00806 |title=Vasovagal syncope |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref>  Vasovagal syncope affects young adults more commonly.<ref name=NWOCC>{{cite journal|title=NEURO-CARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE|journal=NorthWest Ohio Cardiology Consultants|year=2001|month=march|pages=1-2|url=http://www.nwocc.com/Pt%20Education/neuro_syncope.pdf}}</ref>  

There are different [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] syndromes which all fall under the umbrella of vasovagal syncope. The common element among these conditions is the central mechanism leading to loss of consciousness. The differences among them are in the factors that trigger this mechanism.

==Signs and symptoms==
People with vasovagal response are typically recurrent, usually happens when the person is exposed to a specific trigger. Prior to losing consciousness, the individual frequently experiences early signs of symptoms such as lightheaded, nausea, the feeling of being extremely hot or cold (accompanied by sweating), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), an uncomfortable feeling in the heart, fuzzy thoughts, confusion, a slight inability to speak/form words (sometimes combined with mild stuttering), weakness and visual disturbances such as lights seeming too bright, fuzzy or tunnel vision, black cloud-like spots in vision, and a feeling of nervousness can occur as well. The symptoms last for a few seconds before the loss of consciousness (if it is lost), which typically happens when the person is sitting up or standing. When sufferers pass out, they fall down (unless this is impeded); and when in this position, effective blood flow to the brain is immediately restored, allowing the person to regain consciousness. Fainting occurs with the loss of oxygen to the brain. <ref>Ajamian, Paul C. "If patient faints, be laid back: what do you do when a patient passes out in your office? Lay the patient back to restore blood and oxygen to the brain."  Review of Optometry 143.7  (July 15, 2006):  85(2).  Nursing Resource Center. Gale. California State Univ East Bay. 13 Mar. 2013</ref>


The [[autonomic nervous system]]'s physiologic state (see below) leading to loss of consciousness may persist for several minutes, so:
* If sufferers try to sit or stand when they wake up, they may pass out again
* The person may be nauseated, pale, and sweaty for several minutes or hours

==Cause==
Vasovagal syncope occurs in response to a trigger, with a corresponding malfunction in the parts of the nervous system that regulate heart rate and blood pressure. When heart rate slows, blood pressure drops, and the resulting lack of blood to the brain causes fainting and confusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vasovagal-syncope/DS00806/DSECTION=causes |title=Vasovagal syncope: Causes |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Regardless of the trigger, the mechanism of syncope is similar in the various vasovagal syncope syndromes. In it, the [[nucleus tractus solitarius]] of the [[brainstem]] is activated directly or indirectly by the triggering stimulus, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of [[parasympathetic nervous system]] ([[vagal]]) tone and withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.

This results in a spectrum of hemodynamic responses:
# On one end of the spectrum is the '''cardioinhibitory''' response, characterized by a drop in heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and in contractility (negative inotropic effect) leading to a decrease in cardiac output that is significant enough to result in a loss of consciousness.  It is thought that this response results primarily from enhancement in [[parasympathetic tone]].
# On the other end of the spectrum is the '''vasodepressor''' response, caused by a drop in blood pressure (to as low as 80/20) without much change in heart rate.  This phenomenon occurs due to [[vasodilation]], probably as a result of withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.
# The majority of people with vasovagal syncope have a '''mixed''' response somewhere between these two ends of the spectrum.

One account for these physiological responses is the [[Bezold-Jarisch reflex]].

==Diagnosis==
In addition to the mechanism described above, a number of other medical conditions may cause [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]]. Making the correct diagnosis for loss of consciousness is one of the most difficult challenges that a physician can face. The core of the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope rests upon a clear description by the patient of a typical pattern of triggers, symptoms, and time course.
It is also pertinent to differentiate lightheadedness, seizures, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and [[hypoglycemia]] as other causes.

In patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope, diagnostic accuracy can often be improved with one of the following diagnostic tests:
# A [[tilt table test]] (results should be interpreted in the context of patients' clinical presentations and with an understanding of the sensitivity and specificity of the test)<ref name="Fenton, A. M. 2000">Fenton, A. M., Hammill, S. C., Rea, R. F., Low, P. A., & Win-Kuang, S. (2000). Vasovagal Syncope. Annals Of Internal Medicine, 133(9), 714- 725.</ref>
# Implantation of an [[Implantable loop recorder|insertable loop recorder]]
# A [[Holter monitor]] or event monitor
# An [[echocardiogram]]
# An [[electrophysiology study]]

==Treatment==
Treatment for vasovagal syncope focuses on avoidance of triggers, restoring blood flow to the brain during an impending episode, and measures that interrupt or prevent the [[#Pathophysiology and mechanism|pathophysiologic mechanism]] described above.

* The cornerstone of treatment is avoidance of triggers known to cause syncope in that person. However, a new development in psychological research has shown that patients show great reductions in vasovagal syncope through exposure-based exercises with therapists if the trigger is mental or emotional, e.g. sight of blood.<ref name="Durand, VM 2006. pp. 150">Durand, VM, and DH Barlow. 2006. Essentials of Abnormal Psychology 4th Edition. pp. 150.</ref>  However, if the trigger is a specific drug, then avoidance is the only treatment.
* Because vasovagal syncope causes a decrease in blood pressure, relaxing the entire body as a mode of avoidance isn't favorable.<ref name="Durand, VM 2006. pp. 150"/> A patient can move or cross his/her legs and tighten leg muscles to keep blood pressure from dropping so drastically before an injection.<ref name="pmid16398666">{{cite journal |author=France CR, France JL, Patterson SM |title=Blood pressure and cerebral oxygenation responses to skeletal muscle tension: a comparison of two physical maneuvers to prevent vasovagal reactions |journal=Clin Physiol Funct Imaging |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=21â€“5 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16398666 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-097X.2005.00642.x |url=}}</ref>
* Before known triggering events, the patient may increase consumption of salt and fluids to increase blood volume. Sports drinks or drinks with electrolytes may be particularly helpful.
* Discontinuation of medications known to lower blood pressure may be helpful, but stopping [[antihypertensive drugs]] can also be dangerous in some people. Taking antihypertensive drugs may worsen the syncope, as the hypertension may have been the body's way to compensate for the low blood pressure. 
* Patients should be educated on how to respond to further episodes of syncope, especially if they experience [[prodrome|prodromal]] warning signs: they should lie down and raise their legs, or at least lower their head to increase blood flow to the brain. If the individual has lost consciousness, he or she should be laid down with his or her head turned to the side. Tight clothing should be loosened. If the inciting factor is known, it should be removed if possible (for instance, the cause of pain).
* Wearing graded compression stockings may be helpful.
* There are certain orthostatic training exercises which have been proven to improve symptoms in people with recurrent vasovagal syncope. A technique called "Applied Tension" which involves learning to tense the muscles in the torso, arms, and legs is effective for vasovagal syncope.
* Certain [[medications]] may  also be helpful:
** [[Beta blocker]]s (Î²-adrenergic antagonists) were once the most common medication given; however, they have been shown to be ineffective in a variety of studies and are thus no longer prescribed. In addition, they may cause the syncope by lowering the blood pressure and heart rate.<ref name="pmid16505178">{{cite journal |author=Sheldon R |title=Prevention of Syncope  (POST): a randomized, placebo-controlled study of metoprolol in the prevention of vasovagal syncope |journal=Circulation |volume=113 |issue=9 |pages=1164â€“70 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16505178 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.535161 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Connolly S |author3=Rose S |display-authors=3 |last4=Klingenheben |first4=T |last5=Krahn |first5=A |last6=Morillo |first6=C |last7=Talajic |first7=M |last8=Ku |first8=T |last9=Fouad-Tarazi |first9=F}}</ref><ref name="pmid11216978">{{cite journal |author=Madrid AH |title=Lack of efficacy of atenolol for the prevention of neurally mediated syncope in a highly symptomatic population: a prospective, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study |journal=J.

==Prognosis==
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}

Brief periods of unconsciousness do no harm and are seldom symptoms of disease.
The main danger of vasovagal syncope (or dizzy spells from vertigo) is the risk of injury by falling while unconscious. Medication therapy could possibly prevent future vasovagal responses; however, for some individuals medication is ineffective and they will continue to have fainting episodes.
