'''Tabun''' or '''GA''' is an extremely toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odor.<ref name="nta">[http://www.nationalterroralert.com/tabun Facts About Tabun], National Terror Alert Response System</ref> It is classified as a [[nerve agent]] because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system. As a [[chemical weapon]], it is classified as a [[weapon of mass destruction]] by the [[United Nations]] according to [[UN Resolution 687]].  Its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] of 1993. Tabun is the first of the so-called ''G-series'' nerve agents along with [[sarin|GB]] (sarin), [[soman|GD]] (soman) and [[cyclosarin|GF]] (cyclosarin).

Although pure tabun is clear, less-pure tabun may be brown. It is a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] chemical, although less so than either sarin or soman.<ref name="nta"/>

Tabun can be destroyed with bleaching powder, though the [[poisonous]] gas [[cyanogen chloride]] is produced.<ref name=cbw>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbwinfo.com/Chemical/Nerve/GA.shtml |title=Nerve Agent: GA |publisher=Cbwinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref>

==Synthesis==
Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during WWII, based on a process developed by Dr. [[Gerhard Schrader]]. In the chemical agent factory in [[Brzeg Dolny|Dyhernfurth an der Oder]], codenamed "Hochwerk", at least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. The manufacturing process consisted of two steps, first being reaction of gaseous [[dimethylamine]] ('''1''') with an excess of [[phosphoryl chloride]] ('''2'''), yielding dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride ('''3''', codenamed "Produkt 39" or "D 4") and dimethylammonium chloride ('''4'''). [[Dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride]] thus obtained was purified by vacuum distillation and thereafter transferred to the main Tabun production line. Here it was reacted with an excess of [[sodium cyanide]] ('''5'''), dispersed in dry [[chlorobenzene]], yielding the intermediate [[dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide]] (not depicted in the scheme) and [[sodium chloride]] ('''8'''); then, absolute [[ethanol]] ('''6''') was added, reacting with the dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide to yield tabun ('''7''') and [[hydrogen cyanide]] ('''9'''). After the reaction, the mixture (consisting of about 75% chlorobenzene and 25% tabun, along insoluble salts and rests of hydrogen cyanide) was filtered to remove the insoluble salts and vacuum-distilled to remove hydrogen cyanide and excess chlorobenzene, yield the technical product, consisting either of 95% tabun with 5% chlorobenzene (Tabun A), or later in the war, 80% tabun with 20% chlorobenzene (Tabun B).<ref>Lohs, KH: Synthetische Gifte. 3., überarb. u. erg.

==Effects of overexposure==
The symptoms of exposure include:<ref name=cbw/><ref name=military>{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/blchemical-3.htm |title=Chemical Warfare Weapons Fact Sheets&nbsp;— Tabun&nbsp;— GA Nerve Agent |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref><ref name=ency>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403300733.html</ref> [[Anxiety|nervousness]]/[[anxiety|restlessness]], [[miosis]] (contraction of the pupil), [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose), excessive salivation, [[dyspnea]] (difficulty in breathing due to [[bronchoconstriction]]/secretions), [[sweating]], [[bradycardia]] (slow heartbeat), [[Faint|loss of consciousness]], [[convulsion]]s, [[flaccid paralysis]], loss of bladder and bowel control, [[apnea]] (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact symptoms of overexposure are similar to those created by all [[nerve agent]]s. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to [[Bioaccumulation|build up in the body]].<ref name="nta"/>

The effects of tabun appear slowly when tabun is absorbed through the skin rather than inhaled. A victim may absorb a lethal dose quickly, although death may be delayed for one to two hours.<ref name=military/> A person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure.<ref name="nta"/> Inhaled lethal dosages kill in one to ten minutes, and liquid absorbed through the [[Human eye|eye]]s kills almost as fast. However, people who experience mild to moderate exposure to tabun can recover completely, if treated almost as soon as exposure occurred.<ref name="nta"/> The [[LD50|LCt50]] for tabun is about 400&nbsp;mg-min/m<sup>3</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg166.html |title=ATSDR&nbsp;— MMG: Nerve Agents: Tabun (GA); Sarin (GB); Soman (GD); and VX |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref>

Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as [[atropine]].<ref name="ency"/> [[Pralidoxime chloride]] (2-PAM Cl) also works as an antidote; however, it must be administered within minutes to a few hours following exposure to be effective.<ref>Emergency Response Safety and Health Database.

==History==
{{details|Nerve agent#History}}

Tabun was the first nerve agent to be discovered by accident in January 1936<ref name="nta"/><ref name=cbw/><ref>[http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/blchemical-3.htm Chemical Warfare Weapons Fact Sheets], about.com</ref><ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/weap.html Chemical Weapons: Nerve Agents], University of Washington</ref><ref name=shorthistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.noblis.org/MissionAreas/nsi/BackgroundonChemicalWarfare/HistoryofChemicalWarfare/Pages/HistoryNerveGas.aspx |title=A Short History of the Development of Nerve Gases |publisher=Noblis.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref> by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Gerhard Schrader]].<ref name=shorthistory/>  Schrader was experimenting with a class of compounds called [[organophosphate]]s, which kill insects by interrupting their nervous systems, to create a more effective [[insecticide]] for [[IG Farben]], a German chemical and pharmaceutical industry conglomerate, at Elberfield. Instead of a new insecticide, he discovered tabun, a chemical enormously toxic to humans as well as insects.

During [[World War II]], as part of the Grün 3 program, a plant for the manufacture of tabun was established at Dyhernfurth<ref name=shorthistory/> (now [[Brzeg Dolny]], [[Poland]]), in 1939. Run by Anorgana, GmbH, the plant began production of the substance in 1942.<ref name=shorthistory/> The reason for the delay was the extreme precautions used by the plant.<ref name=shorthistory/> Intermediate products of tabun were corrosive, and had to be contained in quartz or silver-lined vessels. Tabun itself was also highly toxic, and final reactions were conducted behind double glass walls.<ref name=shorthistory/> Large scale manufacturing of the agent resulted in problems with tabun's degradation over time, and only around 12,500 tons of material were manufactured before the plant was seized by the [[Soviet Army]]. The plant initially produced shells and aerial bombs using a 95:5 mix of tabun and [[chlorobenzene]], designated "Variant A", and in the latter half of the war switched to "Variant B," a 80:20 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene designed for easier dispersion. The Soviets dismantled the plant and shipped it to [[Russia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The US once had a tabun production program,<ref name=ency/> which ended many decades ago. Like the other [[Allied]] governments, the Soviets soon abandoned GA for GB and GD. Large quantities of the German-manufactured agent were dumped into the sea to neutralize the substance.

Since GA is much easier to produce than the other G-series weapons and the process is comparatively widely understood, countries that develop a nerve agent capability but lack advanced industrial facilities often start by producing GA.

During the [[Iran–Iraq War]], Iraq employed quantities of chemical weapons against Iranian ground forces. Although the most commonly used agents were [[mustard gas]] and [[sarin]], tabun and [[cyclosarin]] were also used.<ref name=ency/><ref>http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90722&page=1</ref>
