Certain sites of the human body have '''immune privilege''', meaning they are able to tolerate the introduction of [[antigen]]s without eliciting an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] immune response. [[Tissue (biology)|Tissue]] [[Medical grafting|grafts]] are normally recognised as foreign antigen by the body and attacked by the [[immune system]]. However in immune privileged sites, tissue grafts can survive for extended periods of time without [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] occurring.<ref name="Hong">Hong, Seokmann, Van Kaer, Luc (1999). Immune Privilege: Keeping an Eye on Natural Killer T Cells. The Journal of Experimental Medicine. 190 (9): 1197-1200</ref> Immunologically privileged sites were thought to include:

* the [[human brain|brain]], but this is now known to be incorrect and indeed immune cells of the CNS contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood <ref name="Ziv">Ziv, Y.et al (2006). Nature Neuroscience, Immune cells contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood 9, 268 - 275.</ref>
* the [[human eye|eye]]s
* the [[placenta]] and the [[fetus]]
* the [[testicle]]s


Immune privilege is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation to protect vital structures from the potentially damaging effects of an inflammatory immune response. Inflammation in the brain or eye can lead to loss of organ function, while immune responses directed against a fetus can lead to the loss of the fetus.

Medically, a [[cornea transplant]] is currently the only procedure that takes advantage of this.

==Mechanisms==
Antigens from immune privileged regions have been found to interact with [[T cell]]s in an unusual way inducing tolerance as opposed to a destructive response.<ref name="Janeway">Janeway, C. A.Jr., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik. M.J. (2005). ImmunoBiology, the immune system in health and disease 6th Edition. Garland Science.</ref> Immune privilege has emerged as an active rather than a passive process.

Physical structures surrounding privileged sites cause a lack of [[lymph]]atic drainage, limiting the immune system's ability to enter the site. Other factors that contribute to the maintenance of immune privilege include:

* low expression of classical [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC class Ia]] molecules
* expression of immunoregulatory [[Major histocompatibility complex|nonclassical, low polymorphic class Ib MHC]] molecules
* increased expression of surface molecules that inhibit [[complement system|complement]] activation
* local production of [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] [[cytokine]]s such as [[TGF-β]]<ref name=microvet>{{cite web |url=http://microvet.arizona.edu/Courses/MIC419/Tutorials/autoimmunity.html |title=Autoimmunity |work=webMIC 419: Immunology |publisher=University of Arizona}}</ref>
* presence of [[neuropeptide]]s
* constitutive expression of [[Fas receptor|Fas]] [[ligand]] that controls the entry of Fas-expressing lymphoid cells.<ref name="Hong"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.12.5986 |author=Green DR, Ware CF |title=Fas-ligand: privilege and peril |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. |volume=94 |issue=12 |pages=5986–90 |year=1997 |month=June |pmid=9177153 |pmc=33671 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9177153}}</ref>

The nature of isolation of immunologically privileged sites from the rest of the body's immune system can cause them to become targets of [[autoimmune]] diseases or conditions, including [[sympathetic ophthalmia]] in the eye.

==Immunologically privileged sites==
=== Eye ===
{{main|Ocular immune system}}
As well as the mechanisms that limit immune cell entry and induce immune suppression, the eye also contains active immune cells that act upon the detection of foreign antigens. These cells interact with the immune system to induce unusual suppression of the systemic immune system response to an antigen introduced into the eye. This is known as Anterior Chamber Associated Immune Deviation (ACAID).<ref name="Keino">Keino, H, Takeuchi, M, Kezuka, T, Hattori, T, Usui, M, Taguchi, O, Streilein, JW, Stein-Streilein, J. (2006). Induction of Eye-Derived Tolerance Does Not Depend on Naturally Occurring CD4+CD25+ T Regulatory Cells. Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science.47:1047-1055</ref><ref name="Streilein">Streilein, JW, Stein-Streilein, J. (2002). Anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID): regulation, biological relevance, and implications for therapy. International Reviews of Immunology. 21(2-3):123-52</ref>
 
[[Sympathetic ophthalmia]] is a rare disease which results from the isolation of the eye from the systemic immune system. Usually, trauma to one eye induces the release of eye antigens which are recognized and picked up by local antigen presenting cells (APC) such as [[macrophages]] and [[dendritic cells]]. These APC carry the antigen to local lymph nodes to be sampled by [[T cell]]s and [[B cell]]s. Entering the systemic immune system, these antigens are recognized as foreign and an immune response is mounted against them. The result is the sensitization of immune cells against a self-protein, causing an autoimmune attack on both the damaged eye and the non-damaged eye.<ref name="Janeway"/>

In this manner, the immune-privileged property has served to work against the eye instead. T cells normally encounter self-antigens during their development, when they move to the tissue draining [[lymph node]]s. [[Anergy]] is induced in T cells which bind to self-antigens, deactivating them and preventing an autoimmune response in the future. However, the physical isolation of eye antigens results in the body's T cells never having encountered them at any time during development.
Studies in mice have shown that the lack of presentation of eye self-antigens to specific T cells will fail to induce a sufficient amount of anergy to the self-antigens. While the lack of antigen presentation (due to the physical barriers) is sufficient to prevent the activation of autoreactive immune cells to the eye, the failure to induce sufficient anergy to T cells has detrimental results. In the case of damage or chance presentation to the immune system, the antigen presentation and immune response will occur at elevated rates.<ref name="Lambe">Lambe, T., J. C. H. Leung, H. Ferry, T.

Retinal Autoimmunity. The Journal of Immunology 178:4276-4283.</ref>

=== Placenta and Fetus ===
{{Main|Immune tolerance in pregnancy}}

The mother’s immune system is able to provide protection from microbial infections without mounting an immune response against fetal tissues expressing [[paternal]]ly inherited [[alloantigen]]s. A better understanding of the immunology of pregnancy may lead to the discovery of reasons for [[miscarriage]].

[[Regulatory T cells]] (Tregs) appear to be important in the maintenance of tolerance to fetal antigen. Increased numbers of Tregs are found during normal pregnancy. In both mouse models and humans diminished numbers of Tregs were associated with immunological rejection of the fetus and miscarriage. Experiments in mice involving the transfer of CD4+/CD25+ Treg cells from normal pregnant mice into abortion-prone animals resulted in the prevention of abortion.<ref name=Zenclussen2006>Zenclussen A,C. (2006). Regulatory T cells in pregnancy. Springer Seminars in Immunopathology. 28(1): 31-39</ref> This confirmed the importance of these cells in maintaining immune privilege in the womb.

{{Expert-subject|Medicine|date=November 2008}}
A number of theories exist as to the exact mechanism by which fetal tolerance is maintained. It has been proposed in recent literature<ref name="Zenclussen2007">Zenclussen AC, Schumacher A, Zencluseen ML, Wafula P, Volk HD. (2007). Immunology of pregnancy: cellular mechanisms allowing fetal survival within the maternal uterus. Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine. 9 (10):1-14.</ref> that a tolerant microenvironment is created at the interface between the mother and fetus by regulatory T-cells producing "tolerant molecules". These molecules including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) have all been implicated in the induction of immune tolerance. Foxp3 and neuropillin are markers expressed by the regulatory T-cells by which they are identified.

=== Testes ===
{{Main|Testicular immunology}}
Sperm are immunogenic - that is they will cause an autoimmune reaction if transplanted from the testis into a different part of the body. This has been demonstrated in experiments using rats by Lansteiner (1899) and Metchinikoff (1900),<ref name="HedgerBook">{{cite book | author = Hedger MP, Hales DB |title = Knobil and Neill's Physiology of Reproduction | editor = Neill JD | pages=1195–1286 | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2006 | chapter = Immunophysiology of the Male Reproductive Tract | isbn= 0-12-515401-7 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} }}</ref><ref name=Fijak>{{cite journal |author=Fijak M, Meinhardt A |title=The testis in immune privilege. |journal= Immunol Rev. |volume=213 |issue=1 |pages=66–81 |year=2006 |pmid=16972897 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00438.x }}</ref> mice <ref name=Kohno>{{cite journal |author=Kohno S, Munoz JA, Williams TM, Teuscher C, Bernard CC, Tung KS. |title=Immunopathology of murine experimental allergic orchitis. |journal= J Immunol. |volume=130 |pages=2675–2682 |year=1983 |pmid=6682874 |issue=6 }}</ref> and guinea pigs.<ref name=Teuscher>{{cite journal |author=Teuscher C, Wild GC, Tung KS |title=Immunochemical analysis of guinea pig sperm autoantigens. |journal= Biol reprod. |volume=26 |pages=218–229 |year=1982 |pmid=7039703 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod26.2.218 |issue=2 }}</ref> The likely reason for this is that sperm first mature at puberty, after [[immune tolerance]] is established, therefore the body recognizes them as foreign and mounts an immune reaction against them. Therefore, mechanisms for their protection must exist in this organ to prevent any autoimmune reaction. The [[blood-testis barrier]] is likely to contribute to the survival of sperm. However, it is believed in the field of testicular immunology that the blood-testis barrier cannot account for all immune suppression in the testis, due to (1) its incompleteness at a region called the [[rete testis]] <ref name=Fijak/> and (2) the presence of immunogenic molecules outside the blood-testis barrier, on the surface of [[spermatogonia]].<ref name="HedgerBook"/><ref name=Fijak/>  Another mechanism which is likely to protect sperm is the suppression of immune responses in the testis.<ref name=Kern>{{cite journal |author=Kern S, Robertson SA, Mau VJ, Maddocks S |title=Cytokine secretion by macrophages in the rat testis. |journal=Biol Reprod. |volume=53 |pages=1407–1416 |year=1995 |pmid=8562698 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod53.6.1407 |issue=6}}</ref><ref name="O'Bryana">{{cite journal |author=O'Bryan MK, Gerdprasert O, Nikolic-Paterson DJ, Meinhardt A, Muir JA, Foulds LM, Phillips DJ, de Kretser DM, Hedger MP |title=Cytokine profiles in the testes of rats treated with lipopolysaccharide reveal localized suppression of inflammatory responses. |journal=Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol. |volume=288 |pages=R1744–R1755 |year=2005 |pmid=15661966 |issue=6 |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00651.2004}}</ref>

=== Central Nervous System ===

The Central Nervous System (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, is a sensitive system with limited capacity for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]]. In that regard, the concept of "immune privilege" within the CNS was once thought to be critical in limiting inflammation.  The [[blood–brain barrier]] plays an important role in maintaining the separation of CNS from the systemic immune system but the presence of the blood–brain barrier, does not, on its own, provide immune privilege.<ref name="Galea">Galea I, Beckmann I, Perry V.H. (2007). What is Immune Privilege (not)?. Trends in Immunology. 28(1): 12-18</ref> It is thought that immune privilege within the CNS varies throughout the different compartments of the system, being most pronounced in the [[parenchyma]] tissue or "white matter".<ref name="Galea"/>

The concept of CNS as an "immune-privileged" organ system, however, has been overwhelmingly challenged and re-evaluated over the last two decades.  Current data do not only indicate the presence of resident CNS [[macrophages]] (known as [[microglia]]) within the CNS, but there is also a wide body of evidence suggesting the active interaction of the CNS with peripheral immune cells.<ref name="pmid16972896">{{cite journal |author=Carson MJ, Doose JM, Melchior B, Schmid CD, Ploix CC |title=CNS immune privilege: hiding in plain sight |journal=Immunol. Rev. |volume=213 |issue= 1|pages=48–65 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16972896 |pmc=2633103 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00441.x |url=}}</ref> 

Generally, in normal (uninjured) tissue, antigens are taken up by antigen presenting cells ([[dendritic cells]]), and subsequently transported to the lymph nodes.  Alternatively, soluble antigens can drain into the lymph nodes. In contrast, in the CNS, dendritic cells are not thought to be present in normal parenchymal tissue or [[perivascular cell|perivascular space]] although they are present in the [[meninges]] and [[choroids|choroids plexus]].<ref name="Galea"/>  Thus, the CNS is thought to be limited in its capacity to deliver antigens to local lymph nodes and cause T-cell activation.<ref name="Mendez-Fernandez">{{cite journal | author = Mendez-Fernandez Y.V. ''et al.'' | year = 2005 | title = Anatomical and cellular requirements for the activation and migration of virus-specific CD8+ T cells to the brain during Theiler's virus infection | url = | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 3063–3070 }}</ref> 
 
Although there is no conventional lymphatic system in the CNS, the drainage of antigens from CNS tissue into the cervical lymph nodes has been demonstrated. The response elicited in the lymph nodes to CNS antigens is skewed towards B-cells. Dendritic cells from [[cerebrospinal fluid]] have been found to migrate to B-cell follicles of cervical lymph nodes.<ref name="Hatterer">{{cite journal | author = Hatterer E. ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = How to drain without lymphatics? Dendritic cells migrate from the cerebrospinal fluid to the B-cell follicles of cervical lymph nodes | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 107 | issue = | pages = 806–812 }}</ref> The skewing of the response to antigen from the CNS towards a [[humoral immunity|humoral response]] means that a more dangerous inflammatory T-cell response can be avoided.
 
The induction of systemic tolerance to an antigen introduced into the CNS has been previously shown.<ref name="Wenkel">{{cite journal | author = Wenkel H. ''et al.'' | year = 2000 | title = Systemic immune deviation in the CNS does not necessarily depend on the integrity of the blood–brain barrier | url = | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 164 | issue = | pages = 5125–5131 }}</ref> This was seen in the absence of the T-cell mediated inflammatory "delayed type hypersensitivity reaction" (DTH) when the antigen was reintroduced in another part of the body. This response is analogous to ACAID in the eye.

==History of research==
The existence of immune privileged regions of the eye was recognised as early as the late 19th century and investigated by [[Peter Medawar|Medawar]]. The original explanation of this phenomenon was that physical barriers around the immune privileged site enabled it to avoid detection from the immune system altogether, preventing the immune system from responding to any antigens present. More recent investigations have revealed a number of different mechanisms by which immune privileged sites interact with the immune system.
