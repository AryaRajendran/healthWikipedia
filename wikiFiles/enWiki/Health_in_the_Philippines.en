'''Health care in the Philippines''' varies from high class (e.g., St Luke's Medical Center - Global City), to non-existent (many rural municipalities). Most of the national burden of health care is taken up by private health providers.

Medical practitioners, nurses, nursing aides, midwives, caregivers, and health administrators, can all train for their profession in the Philippines.  However, most cannot practice outside the Philippines without additional formal study and practical training, usually in the country they choose to migrate to.

There is no requirement in the Philippines for causes of death to be medically determined prior to registration of a death, so national statistics as to causes of death in the Philippines cannot be accurately substantiated. In the provinces, especially in places more remote from registries, births and deaths are often not recorded unless some family need arises, such as entry into college. When there is no legal process needed to pass on inheritance, the recording of deaths is viewed as unnecessary by the family.

Large areas of the Philippines do not have daily access to any pharmaceuticals at all.

In 2000 the [[Philippines]] had about 95,000 [[physicians]], or about 1 per 800 people. In 2001 there were about 1,700 [[hospitals]], of which about 40 percent were government run and 60 percent private, with a total of about 85,000 beds, or about one bed per 900 people. The leading causes of morbidity as of 2002 were [[diarrhea]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], [[hypertension]], [[tuberculosis]], [[heart disease]], [[malaria]], [[chickenpox]], and [[measles]]. [[Cardiovascular diseases]] account for more than 25 percent of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS). Other estimates state that there may have been as many as 9,400 people living with HIV/AIDS in 2001.<ref name=cp>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Philippines.pdf Philippines country profile].

Expenditures on health in 2002 totaled about US$2.2 billion, or about 2.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Government expenditures on health accounted for only about 15 percent of total health expenditures, 30 percent of per capita health expenditures, and about 0.9 percent of all government spending. Per capita health expenditures in 2002 totaled US$28, of which government spending accounted for US$8. Both total and per capita expenditures on health have continued to decline since at least 1990, leading to a decrease in the share of GDP attributable to health expenditures. The main cause of this decline has been the high population growth rate. The government share of total spending on health also has declined steadily, and with more people, there has been less to spend per person from both the government and private sectors.<ref name=cp/>

The proposed National Health Budget for 2010 is P28 billion, about US$597 million, or about 310 pesos (US$7) per person in the Philippines.<ref>http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2002495&Itemid=2</ref>
