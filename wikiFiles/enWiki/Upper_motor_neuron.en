'''Upper motor neurons''' are [[motor neuron]]s that originate in the [[Motor cortex|motor region]] of the [[cerebral cortex]] or the [[brain stem]] and carry motor information down to the final common pathway, that is, any motor neurons that are not directly responsible for stimulating the target [[muscle]]. The main effector neurons for voluntary movement lie within layer V of the [[primary motor cortex]] and are called ''[[Betz cell]]s''. The [[cell (biology)|cell]] bodies of these [[neuron]]s are some of the largest in the brain, approaching nearly 100Î¼m in [[diameter]].

One of the most important areas in the frontal lobe is our primary motor control area which is the precentral gyrus.  The precentral gyrus is the most posterior gyrus of the frontal lobe and it lies anterior to the central sulcus.  The pyramidal cells of the precentral gyrus are also called upper motor neurons.  The fibers of the upper motor neurons project out of the precentral gyrus ending in the brainstem where they will decussate (i.e., cross) within the lower medulla oblongata to form the lateral corticospinal tract on each side of the spinal cord.  The fibers that do not decussate will pass through the medulla and continue on to form the anterior corticospinal tracts.  The upper motor neurone descends in the spinal cord to the level of the appropriate spinal nerve root.  At this point the upper motor neuron synapses with the lower motor neuron, each of whose axons innervates a fiber of skeletal muscle.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S.

These neurons connect the [[brain]] to the appropriate level in the [[spinal cord]], from which point [[action potential|nerve signals]] continue to the muscles by means of the [[lower motor neuron]]s.  The neurotransmitter [[glutamate]] transmits the nerve impulses from upper to lower motor neurons where it is detected by [[glutamatergic]] receptors.

==Pathways==
Upper motor neurons travel in several pathways through the CNS:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Tract''' || '''Pathway''' || '''Function'''
 |- 
 | [[corticospinal tract]]  || from the [[motor cortex]] to [[lower motor neurons]] in the [[Anterior horn of spinal cord|ventral horn]] of the spinal cord || The major function of this pathway is fine voluntary motor control of the limbs. The pathway also controls voluntary body posture adjustments. 
 |- 
 | [[corticobulbar tract]]  || from the [[motor cortex]] to several nuclei in the [[pons]] and [[medulla oblongata]] || Involved in control of facial and jaw musculature, swallowing and tongue movements.
 |- 
 | [[tectospinal tract|Colliculospinal tract]] || from the [[superior colliculus]] to lower motor neurons || Involved in involuntary adjustment of head position in response to visual information. 
 |- 
 | [[rubrospinal tract]]  || from [[red nucleus]] to lower motor neurons || Involved in involuntary adjustment of arm position in response to balance information; support of the body.
 |- 
 | [[vestibulospinal tract]] || from vestibular nuclei, which processes stimuli from [[semicircular canals]] || It is responsible for adjusting posture to maintain balance.
 |- 
 | [[reticulospinal tract]] || from [[reticular formation]] || Regulates various involuntary motor activities and assists in balance.

==Lesions==
[[Upper motor neuron lesion|Damage to the descending motor pathways]] anywhere along the trajectory from the cerebral cortex to the lower end of the spinal cord gives rise to a set of symptoms called the "[[upper motor neuron syndrome]]". Signs may appear over days or weeks following brain or spinal cord damage, including muscle [[weakness]], decreased [[motor control]] including a loss of the ability to perform [[dexterity|fine movements]], increased vigor (and decreased threshold) of spinal [[reflexes]] including [[spasticity]], and an [[extensor]] [[plantar]] response known as the [[Babinski sign]].<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=neurosci&part=A1191</ref>
