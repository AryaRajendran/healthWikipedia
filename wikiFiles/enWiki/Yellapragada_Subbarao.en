'''Yellapragada Subbarao''' ({{lang-te|యెల్లప్రగడ సుబ్బారావు}}) (12 January 1895&nbsp;– 9 August 1948) was an [[India]]n [[biochemist]] who discovered the function of [[adenosine triphosphate]] as an energy source in the [[cell (biology)|cell]], and developed [[methotrexate]] for the treatment of [[cancer]]. Most of his career was spent in the United States. Despite his isolation of ATP, Subbarao was denied tenure at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=Siddhartha|authorlink=Siddhartha Mukherjee|title=The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5rF_31RVTnMC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=16 November 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0795-9|page=31}} Quote: "Any one of these achievements should have been enough to guarantee him a professorship at Harvard. But Subbarao was a foreigner, a reclusive, nocturnal, heavily accented vegetarian who lived in a one-room apartment downtown, befriended only by other nocturnal recluses"</ref> and remained without a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] throughout his life {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, though he would lead some of America's most important medical research during [[World War II]].

==Early life and education==
He was born to a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] [[Niyogi]] [[Brahmin]] family in [[Bhimavaram]] of the Old [[Madras Presidency]], now in West Godavari District, [[Andhra Pradesh]]. He passed through a traumatic period in his schooling at Rajahmundry (due to the premature death of close relations by disease) and eventually matriculated in his third attempt from the Hindu High School, Madras. He passed the Intermediate Examination from the Presidency College and entered the Madras Medical College where his education was supported by friends and Kasturi Suryanarayana Murthy, whose daughter he later married. Following [[Gandhi]]'s call to boycott British goods he started wearing khadi surgical dress; this incurred the displeasure of M. C. Bradfield, his surgery professor. Consequently, though he did well in his written papers, he was awarded the lesser LMS certificate and not a full [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MBBS]] degree.

Subbarao tried to enter the Madras Medical Service without success. He then took up a job as Lecturer in Anatomy at Dr. Lakshmipathi's Ayurvedic College at Madras. He was fascinated by the healing powers of [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicines and began to engage in research to put Ayurveda on a modern footing.

A chance meeting with an American doctor, who was visiting on a Rockefeller Scholarship, changed his mind. The promise of support from [[M.S.N. Charities|Malladi Satyalingam Naicker Charities]] in [[Kakinada]], and financial assistance raised by his father-in-law, enabled Subbarao to proceed to the U.S. He arrived in [[Boston]] on 26 October 1922.

==Career in America==
After earning a diploma from the [[Harvard Medical School]] he joined Harvard as a junior faculty member. With [[Cyrus Fiske]], he developed a method for the estimation of [[phosphorus]] in body fluids and tissues. He discovered the role of [[phosphocreatine]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) in muscular activity, which earned him an entry into biochemistry textbooks in the 1930s. He obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree the same year. <!-- what year? -->

He joined [[Lederle Laboratories]], a division of [[American Cyanamid]] (now a division of [[Wyeth]] which is owned by [[Pfizer]]), after he was denied a regular faculty position at Harvard. At Lederle, he developed a method to synthesize [[folic acid]], Vitamin B<sub>9</sub>,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Farber | first1 = S | last2 = Cutler | first2 = EC | last3 = Hawkins | first3 = JW | last4 = Harrison | first4 = JH | last5 = Peirce Ec | first5 = 2nd | last6 = Lenz | first6 = GG | title = The Action of Pteroylglutamic Conjugates on Man | journal = Science | volume = 106 | issue = 2764 | pages = 619–21 | year = 1947 | pmid = 17831847 | doi = 10.1126/science.106.2764.619 }}</ref> based on work  by [[Lucy Wills]] to isolate folic acid as a protective agent against anemia.

==Recognition and delayed acknowledgement==
Subbarao's memory has been obscured by the achievements of others and his failure to promote his own interests. Part of the reason for his obscurity was that Subbarao did not market his work, or himself.  A patent attorney was once astonished to find that he had not taken any of the steps that scientists everywhere consider routine for linking their name to their handiwork. He never granted interviews to the press; he never made the rounds of the academies which apportion accolades {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}; nor did he go on lecture tours{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

His colleague, [[George Hitchings]], who shared the 1988 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Gertrude Elion]], said, "Some of the [[nucleotides]] isolated by Subbarao had to be rediscovered years later by other workers because Fiske, apparently out of jealousy, did not let Subbarao's contributions see the light of the day."<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/03/13/stories/2003031300140300.htm Press article], ''[[The Hindu]]'' 13-mar-2003</ref>

A [[fungus]] was named ''[[Subbaromyces splendens]]'' in his honor by American Cyanamid.<ref>[http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/50474 Taxon ID 50474]</ref>

Writing in the April 1950 issue of ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', Doron K. Antrim observed,<ref>http://www.ysubbarow.info</ref>
"You've probably never heard of Dr. Yellapragada Subbarao. Yet because he lived you may be alive and are well today. Because he lived you may live longer."<ref>Dr. Yellapragada SubbaRow (1895-1948): The man and the method by Kapur, S. & Gupta, S. P.
