'''Donald Pinkston Francis''' (born October 24, 1942) is an American [[epidemiologist]] who worked on the [[Ebola]] outbreak in Africa in the late 1970s, and researched on [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]]. He retired from the U.S. Public Health Service in 1992, after 21 years of service. According to him,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} the White House (then under the administration of [[George H.W. Bush]]) wanted him fired, but in order to evade controversy he quietly "retired". He currently lives in [[San Francisco, California]].

==Early life==
He was born October 24, 1942 in the [[Bay Area]] of [[California]] and grew up in [[Marin County]]. His main interest was [[skiing]], and his mother, father and grandfather were physicians.   however, was a poor student as a child, suffering from dyslexia.   He has said that he gravitated towards science because he had such difficulty with subjects where fluid reading ability was needed.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Francis completed his undergraduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  He was a member of the California chapter at [[Delta Upsilon]], class of 1966.  He received his M.D. from [[Northwestern University]] and his Doctor of Science in Virology from [[Harvard]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He did his internship and residency in pediatrics at the University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles and his fellowship in infectious diseases at Harvard. Before beginning his work on [[AIDS]], Francis was involved in epidemic control around the world. He was instrumental in eradicating [[smallpox]] from [[Sudan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He was also on the front line of the [[cholera]] epidemic in [[Nigeria]] in the early 1970s, the [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia|smallpox epidemic in Yugoslavia]] in 1972 [http://www.accessexcellence.org/LC/SS/bkgnd_paper.html], and the [[Ebola]] epidemic in Sudan in 1976. Francis also did some of the early developmental work on the [[hepatitis B]] vaccine, both in the United States and in the People's Republic of China.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Later Work==

Francis began his work on AIDS in 1981. He was one of the first scientists to suggest that AIDS was caused by an infectious agent. As director of [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC's]] AIDS Laboratory Activities, he worked closely with the [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]] which isolated [[HIV]].

At the time of his retirement from the CDC, he was the centers' AIDS Advisor to the State of California and Special Consultant to Mayor [[Art Agnos]] in San Francisco.[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-11/news/mn-205_1_task-force] In the latter capacity he served as the Chair of the Mayor's HIV Task Force.

In 1993, Francis joined [[Genentech, Inc.]], of South San Francisco to try to develop a [[vaccine]] for HIV. In 1995, Francis and fellow retrovirologist Dr. Robert Nowinski spun off Genentech's HIV vaccine unit, after the company had disappointing results, and founded [[VaxGen]], based in Brisbane, California, to continue working on vaccines. After the vaccine failed in clinical trials, he left VaxGen in 2004 to co-found  Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases [http://www.gsid.org/], where he serves as Executive Director and a principal investigator.[http://www.gsid.org/about_us_our_founders_and_board.html#dfrancis]

==And The Band Played On==
In 1993, [[HBO]] produced an [[Emmy]]-winning movie of the AIDS crisis called ''[[And The Band Played On]]'', based on the 1987 book of the same name by ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' journalist [[Randy Shilts]]. A central figure in the movie is Dr. Don Francis, played by ([[Matthew Modine]]). His dramatic antagonist is Dr. [[Robert Gallo]] ([[Alan Alda]]), the discoverer of [[Human T-lymphotropic virus|HTLV]] (the human T-cell leukemia virus), and co-discoverer of HIV, who cuts off assistance when he hears that Francis has shared some experimental materials with French researchers at the [[Pasteur Institute]].
