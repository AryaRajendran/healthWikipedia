'''Management of schizophrenia''' depends largely on medications and on psychosocial interventions.  No single approach is widely considered effective for all patients, though in the United States and most Western countries, psychiatric medication is often the primary method of treatment.  Currently, there is a movement towards utilizing a [[recovery model]] that emphasizes hope, empowerment and social inclusion, though this is not yet a mainstream mental health concept .<ref name="Bellack06">{{cite journal | pmid = 16461575 | pmc = 2632241 | doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj044 | volume=32 | issue=3 | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | year=2006 | title = Scientific and Consumer Models of Recovery in Schizophrenia: Concordance, Contrasts, and Implications | month=July | pages=432–42 | author=Bellack AS}}</ref>

Antipsychotics have been a mainstay of therapy since the introduction of [[chlorpromazine]] in the mid-1950s, which revolutionized treatment {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Significant adverse effects have attracted controversy. Older concerns of sedation, [[tardive dyskinesia]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] have been largely replaced with those of drug-related [[obesity]] and [[diabetes]].

In many non-Western societies, schizophrenia may only be treated with more informal, community-led methods. The outcome for people diagnosed with schizophrenia in non-Western countries may actually be better than for people in the West.<ref name="fn_41">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02190374 | author = Kulhara P | year = 1994 | title = Outcome of schizophrenia: some transcultural observations with particular reference to developing countries | url = | journal = European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 244 | issue = 5| pages = 227–35 | pmid = 7893767 }}</ref>  The reasons for this effect are not clear, although cross-cultural studies are being conducted.

The effectiveness of interventions is often assessed using standardized methods, one of the most common being the [[Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale]] (PANSS).<ref name="fn_68">{{Vcite journal | last1 = Kay | first1 = SR. | last2 = Fiszbein | first2 = A. | last3 = Opler | first3 = LA. | title = The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia. | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 261–76 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3616518 }}</ref> This instrument only measures the presence of psychiatric symptoms, and does not adequately assess the characteristics of the [[recovery model]] which emphasize psychosocial constructs of recovery, such as hope, identity formation, empowerment and social inclusion.<ref name="Bellack06">{{vcite journal |author=Bellack AS |title=Scientific and consumer models of recovery in schizophrenia: concordance, contrasts, and implications |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=432–42 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16461575 |pmc=2632241 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj044}}</ref>

==Hospitalization==
Hospitalization may occur with severe episodes of schizophrenia. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to [[deinstitutionalization]], although still occur.<ref name="BeckerKilian2006">{{cite journal | author = Becker T, Kilian R | year = 2006 | title = Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? | url = | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Supplement | volume = 113 | issue = 429| pages = 9–16 | pmid = 16445476 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x}}</ref> Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or [[Assertive Community Treatment]] team, supported employment<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McGurk | first1 = SR | last2 = Mueser | first2 = KT | last3 = Feldman | first3 = K | last4 = Wolfe | first4 = R | last5 = Pascaris | first5 = A | title = Cognitive training for supported employment: 2-3 year outcomes of a randomized controlled trial. | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 3 | pages = 437–41 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17329468 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.164.3.437 }}</ref> and patient-led support groups.
Efforts to avoid repeated hospitalization include the obtaining of community treatment orders which,following judicial approval, coerce the affected individual to receive psychiatric treatment including long-acting injections of anti-psychotic medication. This legal mechanism has been shown to increase the affected patient's time out of the hospital.<ref>Effects of compulsory treatment orders on time to hospital readmission (2005).</ref>

==Medication==
[[File:Risperdal tablets.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Risperidone]] (trade name Risperdal) is a common [[atypical antipsychotic]] medication.]]
The mainstay of psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is [[antipsychotic]] medication.<ref name="fn_72">The Royal College of Psychiatrists & The British Psychological Society (2003). [http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=289559 ''Schizophrenia. Full national clinical guideline on core interventions in primary and secondary care''] (PDF). London: Gaskell and the British Psychological Society.  Retrieved on 2007-05-17.</ref> These can reduce the "positive" symptoms of psychosis. Most antipsychotics are thought to take around 7–14 days to have their main effect.

Treatment of schizophrenia changed dramatically in the mid-1950s with the development and introduction of the first antipsychotic [[chlorpromazine]].<ref name="Turner2007">{{cite journal | author=Turner T. | title=Unlocking psychosis | journal=Brit J Med | year=2007 | volume=334 | issue=suppl | pages=s7 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39034.609074.94 | pmid=17204765 }}</ref> Others such as [[haloperidol]] and [[trifluoperazine]] soon followed.

It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], a rare but serious and potentially fatal neurological disorder most often caused by an adverse reaction to [[neuroleptic]] or antipsychotic drugs.<ref name="Ananth_et_al_2004">{{cite journal | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v65n0403 | author = Ananth J, Parameswaran S, Gunatilake S, Burgoyne K, Sidhom T | year = 2004 | title = Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and atypical antipsychotic drugs | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 464–70 | pmid = 15119907 }}</ref>

The two classes of antipsychotics are generally thought equally effective for the treatment of the positive symptoms. Some researchers have suggested that the atypicals offer additional benefit for the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, although the clinical significance of these effects has yet to be established. Recent reviews have refuted the claim that atypical antipsychotics have fewer extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics, especially when the latter are used in low doses or when low potency antipsychotics are chosen.<ref name="fn_36">{{cite journal | author = Leucht S, Wahlbeck K, Hamann J, Kissling W | year = 2003 | title = New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a [[systematic review]] and meta-analysis | url = | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 361 | issue = 9369| pages = 1581–9 | pmid = 12747876 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13306-5}}</ref>

Response of symptoms to medication is variable; "Treatment-resistant schizophrenia" is the failure to respond to 2 or more anti-psychotic medications given in therapeutic doses for 6 weeks or more.<ref>Semple.David"Oxford Handbook Of Psychiatry". Oxford Press. 2005. p 207.</ref> Patients in this category may be prescribed [[clozapine]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wahlbeck K, Cheine MV, Essali A | editor1-last = Wahlbeck | editor1-first = Kristian | title = Clozapine versus typical neuroleptic medication for schizophrenia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD000059| publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. | year = 2007 | pmid=10796289 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000059 | id = ISSN 1464-780X}}</ref> a medication of superior effectiveness but several potentially lethal side effects including [[agranulocytosis]] and [[myocarditis]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Haas SJ, Hill R, Krum H  | title = Clozapine-associated myocarditis: a review of 116 cases of suspected myocarditis associated with the use of clozapine in Australia during 1993–2003 | journal = Drug Safety | volume = 30 | pages = 47–57 | year = 2007 | pmid=17194170 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-200730010-00005 | issue = 1 }}</ref>  Clozapine is the only medication proven to be more effective for persons who do not respond to other types of antipsychotics. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It also appears to reduce suicide in people with schizophrenia. As clozapine suppresses the development of bone marrow, in turn reducing white blood cells which can lead to infection, blood tests are taken for the first six months on this medication.<ref>Kozier, B et al. (2008). Fundamentals Of Nursing, Concepts, Process, and Practice. London: Pearson Education. p. 189.</ref>

For other patients who are unwilling or unable to take medication regularly, long-acting [[Typical antipsychotic#Depot injections|depot]] preparations of antipsychotics may be given every two weeks to achieve control. America and Australia are two countries with [[Outpatient commitment|laws]] allowing the forced administration of this type of medication on those who refuse but are otherwise stable and living in the community.

Some findings indicate that, in the long term, many schizophrenic individuals function better without antipsychotic medicine.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fenton W. | last2 = McGlashan | first2 = TH | authorlink2 = Thomas McGlashan, McGlashan T. | year = 1987 | title = Sustained remission in drug-free schizophrenic patients | url = | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 144 | issue = 10| pages = 1306–1309 | pmid = 2889376 }}</ref> In a 2007 study, only 28% of patients who were not being treated medicinally showed signs of psychotic activity, while 64% of those on antipsychotics had psychotic activity. The authors of the study cautioned that some of this gap may be accounted for by the increased likelihood of symptomatic patients to be placed on antipsychotic medicine, but also noted that some of the difference held even when on-antipsychotic and off-medicine patients of similar prognosis were compared.

===Nicotine patch===

Following an observation that [[tobacco smoking]] eases effects of [[schizophrenia]], the [[nicotine patch]] has been proposed as a treatment for schizophrenia.<ref name=tonygeorge>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/healthreport/stories/2002/614060.htm Smoking and schizophrenia]</ref>

==Psychosocial==
[[Psychotherapy]] is also widely recommended, though not widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia, due to reimbursement problems or lack of training. As a result, treatment is often confined to psychiatric medication.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Moran M |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/40/22/24-b |title=Psychosocial Treatment Often Missing From Schizophrenia Regimens | journal=Psychiatr News|date=18 November 2005|volume=40 | issue=22|page=24|accessdate= 2007-05-17 }}</ref>

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is used to target specific symptoms and improve related issues such as [[self-esteem]], social functioning, and insight.  Although the results of early trials were inconclusive <ref name="fn_38">{{cite journal |author=Cormac I, Jones C, Campbell C |title=Cognitive behaviour therapy for schizophrenia |journal=Cochrane Database of [[systematic review]]s |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD000524 |year=2002 |pmid=11869579 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000524|accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> as the therapy advanced from its initial applications in the mid-1990s, more recent reviews clearly show CBT is an effective treatment for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wykes T, Steel C, Everitt B, Tarrier N |title=Cognitive behavior therapy for schizophrenia: effect sizes, clinical models, and methodological rigor |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=523–37 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=17962231 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm114 |url= |pmc=2632426}}</ref><ref name="fn_39">{{cite journal |author=Zimmermann G, Favrod J, Trieu VH, Pomini V |title=The effect of cognitive behavioral treatment on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16005380 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2005.02.018 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920-9964(05)00084-8|accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

Another approach is cognitive remediation therapy, a technique aimed at remediating the [[neurocognitive deficit]]s sometimes present in schizophrenia. Based on techniques of [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]], early evidence has shown it to be cognitively effective, resulting in the improvement of previous deficits in psychomotor speed, verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and executive function, such improvements being related to measurable changes in brain activation as measured by [[fMRI]].<ref name="fn_40">{{cite journal | author = Wykes T, Brammer M, Mellers J ''et al.'' | year = 2002 | title = Effects on the brain of a psychological treatment: cognitive remediation therapy: functional magnetic resonance imaging in schizophrenia | url = | journal = [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] | volume = 181 | issue = | pages = 144–52 | pmid = 12151286 }}</ref>

MCT aims at sharpening the awareness of patients for a variety of cognitive biases (e.g. jumping to conclusions, attributional biases, over-confidence in errors), which are implicated in the formation and maintenance of schizophrenia positive symptoms (especially delusions),<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2006.03.004 | author = Bell V, Halligan PW, Ellis HD | year = 2006 | title = Explaining delusions: a cognitive perspective | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 219–226 | pmid = 16600666 }}</ref> and to ultimately replace these biases with functional cognitive strategies.
