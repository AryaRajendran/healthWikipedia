'''''Yersinia enterocolitica''''' is a species of [[gram-negative]] [[Coccobacillus|coccobacillus-shaped]] [[bacterium]], belonging to the family [[Enterobacteriaceae]]. Yersinia enterocolitica infection causes the disease [[yersiniosis]], which is a [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] disease occurring in humans as well as a wide array of animals such as cattle, deer, pigs, and birds. Many of these animals recover from the disease and become [[asymptomatic carrier]]s.<ref name=Barron>{{cite book | author = Collins FM | title = Pasteurella, and Francisella.

==Signs and symptoms==
Acute ''Y. enterocolitica'' infections usually lead to mild self-limiting [[enteritis|entero]]-[[colitis]] or terminal [[ileitis]] in humans. Symptoms may include watery or bloody [[diarrhea]] and fever. After oral uptake yersiniae replicate in the terminal ileum and invade [[Peyer's patches]]. From here yersiniae can disseminate further to mesenteric lymph nodes causing [[lymphadenopathy]]. This condition can be confused with [[appendicitis]] and is therefore called pseudoappendicitis. In immunosuppressed individuals, yersiniae can disseminate from the gut to [[liver]] and [[spleen]] and form abscesses.  Because ''Yersinia'' is a [[Siderophilic bacteria|siderophilic]] (iron-loving) bacteria, people with [[hereditary hemochromatosis]] (a disease resulting in high body iron levels) are more susceptible to infection with ''Yersinia'' (and other siderophilic bacteria). In fact, the most common contaminant of stored blood is ''Y. enterocolitica''.<ref>Goljan, Edward F. Rapid Review Pathology. Second Edition. Page 279, Table 15-1.</ref> See [[yersiniosis]] for further details. Yersiniae are usually transmitted to humans by insufficiently cooked pork or contaminated water.

==Treatment==
Yersiniosis is usually self-limiting and does not require treatment. Severe infections (septicemia, focal infection, immunosuppression) can be treated with doxycycline in combination with an aminoglycoside. Other antibiotics that are active against ''Y. enterocolitica'' include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole, fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, and chloramphenicol. ''Y. enterocolitica'' is usually resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, and cephalotin due to beta-lactamase production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bottone |first=Edward|year=1997 |month=April |title=Yersinia enterocolitica: the charisma continues |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|pages=257–276 |publisher= American Society for Microbiology|pmc=172919 |pmid=9105754 |volume=10 |issue=2}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
''Y. enterocolitica'' infections are sometimes followed by chronic inflammatory diseases such as [[arthritis]].<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref>

''Y. enterocolitica'' seems to be associated with autoimmune [[Graves-Basedow disease|Graves-Basedow]] [[thyroiditis]].<!--

and ''Y. enterocolitica'' is probably not a major cause of this disease, but may contribute to the development of thyroid autoimmunity arising for other reasons in genetically susceptible individuals.<!--

It has also been suggested that ''Y. enterocolitica'' infection is not the [[Causality|cause]] of auto-immune thyroid disease, but rather is only an [[Association (statistics)|associated]] condition; with both having a shared inherited susceptibility.<!--
