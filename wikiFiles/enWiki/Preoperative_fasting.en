'''Preoperative [[fasting]]''' is the practice of a patient [[nil per os|abstaining from oral food and fluid intake]] for a time before an [[Surgery operation|operation]] is performed. This is intended to prevent [[pulmonary aspiration]] of [[stomach]] contents during general anesthesia.<ref name="OHA">{{cite book | last=Allman | first=Keith G. | coauthors=Iain H.

==Pulmonary aspiration==
The main reason for preoperative fasting is to prevent [[pulmonary aspiration]] of stomach contents while under the effects of [[general anesthesia]]. Aspiration of as little as 30-40ml can be a significant cause of suffering and death during an operation and therefore fasting is performed to reduce the volume of stomach contents as much as possible. Several factors can predispose to aspiration of stomach contents including inadequate anesthesia, [[pregnancy]], [[obesity]], difficult airways, emergency surgery (since fasting time is reduced), full stomach and altered [[gastrointestinal system|gastrointestinal]] mobility. Increased fasting times leads to decreased injury if aspiration occurs.<ref name="OHA"/>

==Gastric conditions==

In addition to fasting, [[antacid]]s are administered the night before (or in the morning of an afternoon operation) and then once again two hours prior to surgery. This is to increase the [[pH]] (make more neutral) of the [[acid]] present in the stomach, helping to reduce the damage caused by pulmonary aspiration, should it occur. [[H2 blocker|H2 receptor blockers]] should be used in high-risk situations and should be administered in the same timing intervals as antacids.<ref name="OHA"/>

[[Gastroparesis]] (delayed gastric emptying) may occur and is due to [[metabolism|metabolic]] causes (e.g. poorly controlled [[diabetes mellitus]]), decreased gastric motility (e.g. due to head injury) or [[pyloric]] obstruction (e.g. [[pyloric stenosis]]). Delayed gastric emptying usually only affects the emptying of the stomach of high-[[cellulose]] foods such as vegetables. Gastric emptying of clear fluids such as water or black [[coffee]] is only affected in highly progressed delayed gastric emptying.<ref name="OHA"/>

Occasionally, gastroesophageal reflux may be associated with delayed gastric emptying of solids, but clear liquids are not affected. Raised [[abdomen|intra-abdominal]] pressure (e.g. in pregnancy or obesity) predisposes to [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]. Certain drugs such as [[opiates]] can cause marked delays in gastric emptying, as can trauma which can be determined by certain indicators such as normal bowel sounds and patient hunger.<ref name="OHA"/>

==Minimum fasting times==
The minimum fasting times prior to surgery have long been debated. The first proposition came from British anesthetists stating that patients should be [[nil per os|nil by mouth]] from midnight.<ref name="maltby">{{cite journal |author=Maltby JR |title=Preoperative fasting guidelines |journal=Can J Surg |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=138–9; author reply 139 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16630428 |doi= |url=http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/cjs/vol-49/issue-2/pdf/pg138.pdf |issn= |accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> However, since then, the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] (ASA), followed by the Association of Anaesthestists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI), recommended new fasting guidelines for the minimum fast prior to surgery.<ref name="OHA"/> This was based upon evidence by Canadian anesthesiologists who found that drinking clear fluids two hours prior to surgery decreased pulmonary aspiration compared to those [[Nil per os|nil by mouth]] since midnight.<ref name="maltby"/> The following are the recommended guidelines for nil by mouth prior to surgery:<ref name="cote">{{cite journal |author=Coté CJ |title=Preoperative preparation and premedication |journal=Br J Anaesth |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=16–28 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10616330 |doi= |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10616330 |issn= |accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>

When anaesthesia is required in an emergency situation, [[nasogastric aspiration]] is usually performed to reduce gastric contents and the risk of its pulmonary aspiration.<ref>[http://www.tmlt.org/files/PDFs/Reporter/Anesthesiology2004.pdf Legal review of need to place NG tube]</ref>
