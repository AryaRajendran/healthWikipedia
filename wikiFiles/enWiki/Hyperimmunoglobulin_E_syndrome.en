'''Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome'''<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> (HIES), also called '''Job's syndrome'''<ref name="Bolognia" /> and '''Buckley syndrome''',<ref name="Bolognia" />  is a heterogeneous group of immune disorders.

==Presentation==
It is characterized by recurrent "cold" [[Staphylococcus|staphylococcal]] [[infection]]s,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000104295|hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome}}</ref> unusual [[eczema]]-like skin rashes, severe [[lung]] infections that result in [[pneumatocele]]s (balloon-like lesions that may be filled with air or pus or scar tissue) and very high concentrations of the serum antibody [[IgE]]. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1050852-overview</ref> Many patients with autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome fail to lose their primary teeth and have two sets of teeth simultaneously.

A common mnemonic used to remember the symptoms is FATED: coarse or leonine '''f'''acies, cold staph '''a'''bscesses, retained primary '''t'''eeth, increased Ig'''E''', and '''d'''ermatologic problems [eczema].

==History==
HIES was first described by Davis et al. in 1966 in two girls with red hair, chronic dermatitis, and recurrent staphylococcal abscesses and pneumonias.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis S, Schaller J, Wedgwood R |title=Job's Syndrome. Recurrent, "cold", staphylococcal abscesses |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=7445 |pages=1013–5 |year=1966 |pmid=4161105 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(66)90119-X}}</ref> They named the disease after the biblical character [[Book of Job|Job]], whose body was covered with boils by [[Satan]]. In 1972, Buckley et al. described two boys with similar symptoms as well as coarse facies, [[eosinophilia]], and elevated serum IgE levels. These two syndromes are thought to be the same and are under the broad category of HIES.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buckley R, Wray B, Belmaker E |title=Extreme hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and undue susceptibility to infection |journal=Pediatrics |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=59–70 |year=1972 |pmid=5059313}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Abnormal neutrophil [[chemotaxis]] due to decreased production of [[interferon gamma]] by T lymphocytes is thought to cause the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borges W, Augustine N, Hill H |title=Defective interleukin-12/interferon-gamma pathway in patients with hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome |journal=J Pediatr |volume=136 |issue=2 |pages=176–80 |year=2000 |pmid=10657822 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(00)70098-9}}</ref> 

Both [[autosomal dominant]] and [[autosomal recessive|recessive]] inheritance have been described:
* autosomal dominant, ''[[STAT3]]''. The disease was linked to mutations in the ''[[STAT3]]'' gene after cytokine profiles indicated alterations in the STAT3 pathway.<ref>Holland SM, DeLeo FR, Elloumi HZ ''et al.'' (2007). [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMoa073687 STAT3 Mutations in the Hyper-IgE Syndrome]. ''N. Engl. J. Med.'' published online, 2007-09-19. {{DOI|10.1056/NEJMoa073687}}.</ref>
* autosomal recessive, ''[[DOCK8]]''.<ref name="pmid19776401">{{cite journal |author=Zhang Q, Davis JC, Lamborn IT, ''et al.'' |title=Combined immunodeficiency associated with DOCK8 mutations |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=361 |issue=21 |pages=2046–55 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19776401 |pmc=2965730 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0905506}}</ref>

==Laboratory studies==
{{Expert-subject|date=August 2008}}
Elevated IgE is the hallmark of HIES, usually > 10 times normal. However, patients younger than 6 months of age may have very low to non-detectable IgE levels. [[Eosinophilia]] is also a common finding with greater than 90% of patients having eosinophil elevations greater than two standard deviations above the normal mean.<ref name="Grimbacher">{{cite journal |author=Grimbacher B, Holland S, Gallin J, Greenberg F, Hill S, Malech H, Miller J, O'Connell A, Puck J |title=Hyper-IgE syndrome with recurrent infections--an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=340 |issue=9 |pages=692–702 |year=1999 |pmid=10053178 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199903043400904}}</ref>

==Clinical characteristics==
HIES often appears early in life with recurrent staphylococcal and candidal infections, pneumonias, and eczematoid skin. Characteristic facial, dental, and skeletal abnormalities have also been described. Patients with HIES have either delay of or failure in shedding of primary teeth. The characteristic facial features are usually set by age 16. These include facial asymmetry, a prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, a broad nasal bridge, a wide, fleshy nasal tip, and mild [[prognathism]]. Additionally, facial skin was rough with prominent pores. Finally, some patients have [[scoliosis]], as well as bones that fracture easily.<ref name="Grimbacher" />

==Treatment==
Most patients with hyper IgE syndrome are treated with chronic [[antibiotics]] to help protect them from [[staphylococcal]] infections. Good skin care is also important in patients with hyper IgE syndrome. High-dose intravenous gamma-globulin has also been suggested for the treatment of severe eczema in patients with HIES and [[atopic dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kimata H |title=High-dose intravenous gamma-globulin treatment for hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome |journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=771–4 |year=1995 |pmid=7897163 |doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(95)70185-0}}</ref>
