'''For-profit hospitals''', or alternatively investor-owned hospitals, are [[investor]]-owned chains of [[hospital]]s which have been established particularly in the [[United States]] during the late twentieth century. In contrast to the traditional and more common [[non-profit hospital]]s, they attempt to garner a profit for their shareholders.

In the United States. the three largest such firms are [[Hospital Corporation of America]], [[Tenet Healthcare|Tenet]] (formerly [[NME]]), and [[HealthSouth]].  HealthSouth, as the third-largest U.S. national chain, is also the leading provider of rehabilitation services. For profit [[Psychiatric Solutions]] is the largest                                                                                  provider of psychiatric services in the nation.

A conceptually related institution is the [[for-profit HMO]], which now comprises the predominant means of delivering [[medical services]] in the United States.

Advocates of such institutions claim they are able to provide better care at lower [[cost]] due to higher efficiency.

Detractors, however, claim that the relative success of for-profit medical providers arises from their positioning themselves in the medical marketplace in such a manner as to offer mainly profitable care services for a largely affluent and insured clientele whilst avoiding unprofitable care areas. Critics thus claim, for example, that for-profit hospitals specialize in such highly lucrative fields as [[medical rehabilitation]], elective/plastic surgery, and [[cardiology]] while avoiding provision of loss-making services such as [[emergency medicine]] which in turn caters mainly to the indigent.  Analogously, critics of for-profit HMOs argue that such firms disproportionately insure healthy people, while simultaneously eschewing chronically ill patients, who must then by default be cared for disproportionately by public insurance schemes and non-profit providersâ€”thus a so-called "dumping" of undesirable patients.

They have also been criticised by elements of the Canadian medical establishment as providing inferior care at higher cost.
