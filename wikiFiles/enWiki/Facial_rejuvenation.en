'''Facial rejuvenation''' is any cosmetic or medical procedure used to increase or restore the appearance of a younger age to human [[face]]. The specific term, however, refers to a set of [[cosmetic surgery|surgical procedures]] which try to restore facial geometry and [[human skin|skin]] appearance which are typical of youth, by using a combination of [[brow lift]], elimination of [[eye bag]]s, [[eyelid]]s lift, elimination of [[senile spot]]s, skin aging, facial sagging and [[wrinkle]]s by [[face lift]] and [[rhytidectomy]] and physical or chemical peeling, chin lift (reduction of double chin), restoration of facial [[hair]]line, etc. These procedures are usually successful and in some cases achieve striking results. Examples of facial rejuvenation treatments are Fractional Radiofrequency and Ultherapy, both non-invasive procedures stimulating the body's own regenerative process of building new skin and tighten the skin.<ref> http://www.novasans.com/blog/2011/09/reviews-of-ultherapy-by-ulthera-â€“-non-surgical-face-lift-and-tightening-for-the-skin/</ref>

Other procedures are:

* [[Botox]] injections
* [[DMAE]] creams
* [[Permanent makeup]]
* [[Facial toning]]
* [[Collagen injection]]
* [[Cosmetic acupuncture]]

==Influence of changes in bone structure==

More recent research has pointed out the influence of changes in the facial [[skeleton]] with age on the appearance of "oldness", especially in the mid-face area and the lower part of the [[orbit]]s around the [[Human nose|nose]]. quantitative study with [[CAT scan]]s of the faces of men and women in several age brackets [http://www.999today.com/healthandmedicine/news/story/1962.html] has revealed that there is an appreciable amount of loss of [[bone]] tissue in these regions with age, leading to changes in angles, lengths and volumes, and also decreasing the distance between the [[human eye|eye]]s. This occurs earlier in women than in men. It has been hypothesised that skin sagging and wrinkles may occur not only because of loss of soft tissue and fat, but also because bone retraction creates an excess of skin which is no longer flexible. Future facial rejuvenation techniques may take into account these findings and restore bone lost by aging processes.

==Visual appraisal of facial youthness==
Human [[visual perception]] is notable to its sensitivity and accuracy in estimating or perceiving age by instant [[pattern recognition]] of facial features. Often, human faces with no measurable difference in facial geometry and appearance are perceived as having different ages. This mechanism is not yet entirely understood, but they may be related to the subtle changes in facial bone structure related above.

==Trends in facial rejuvenation==

According to the [[American Society of Plastic Surgeons]], more than 114,000 facelifts and nearly 55,000 forehead lifts were performed in the [[USA]] in 2004, the majority on women. A significant upward trend on the number of facial rejuvenation procedures is predicted, due to the following factors:
#Men have also started to perform these procedures at increasing numbers;
#Emphasis on image of youthfulness by the [[mass media]] and [[fashion]];
#Increasing numbers of senior people enjoying good [[health]] and financial affluence at older ages;
#Decreasing costs of surgery and other cosmetic procedures, making them affordable to all

In 2011, the ASPS numbers continue to increase for the majority of rejuvenating procedures. 119,026 facelifts  but 46,931 forehead lifts (also known as a brow lift) were performed. 

However, while surgical procedures are preferred to achieve a more dramatic improvement, the current trend is for less invasive procedures, such as injectables (Botox, fillers) and laser skin treatments. While these treatments achieve temporary results, they tend to be preferred due to their less intensive recovery period.
