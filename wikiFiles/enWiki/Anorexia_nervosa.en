'''Anorexia nervosa''' is an [[eating disorder]] characterized by immoderate food restriction and irrational fear of gaining weight, as well as a distorted body self-perception. It typically involves excessive weight loss and is usually found more in females than in males.<ref>Hockenbury, Don and Hockenbury, Sandra (2008) ''Psychology'', p. 593. Worth Publishers, New York.

People with anorexia nervosa continue to feel hunger, but they deny themselves all but very small quantities of food.<ref name=Frude/> The average caloric intake of a person with anorexia nervosa is 600–800 calories per day, but extreme cases of complete self-starvation are known. It is a serious mental illness with a high incidence of [[comorbidity]] and similarly high mortality rates to serious psychiatric disorders.<ref name=Attia/> People suffering from anorexia have extremely high levels of [[ghrelin]] (the hunger hormone that signals a physiological desire for food) in their blood. The high levels of ghrelin suggests that their bodies are trying to desperately switch the hunger aspect on; however, that hunger call is being suppressed, ignored, or overridden. Nevertheless, one small single-blind study found that intravenous administration of ghrelin to anorexia nervosa patients increased food intake by 12–36% over the trial period.<ref name="Hotta2009">{{Cite journal|author=Hotta M, Ohwada R, Akamizu T, Shibasaki T, Takano K, Kangawa K |title=Ghrelin increases hunger and food intake in patients with restricting-type anorexia nervosa: a pilot study |journal=Endocrine Journal |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=1119–28 |year=2009 |pmid=19755753|doi=10.1507/endocrj.K09E-168}}</ref> 

The term anorexia nervosa was established in 1873 by [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], one of [[Queen Victoria]]'s personal physicians.<ref name="pmid9385628">{{Cite journal|author=Gull WW |title=Anorexia nervosa (apepsia hysterica, anorexia hysterica). 1868 |journal=Obesity Research |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=498–502 |year=1997|pmid=9385628|doi=10.1002/j.1550-8528.1997.tb00677.x}}</ref> The term is of Greek origin: ''an-'' (ἀν-, prefix denoting negation) and ''orexis'' (ὄρεξις, "appetite"), thus meaning a lack of desire to eat.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Costin |first=Carolyn |year=1999 |title=The Eating Disorder Sourcebook |location=Linconwood |publisher=Lowell House |page=6 |isbn=0-585-18922-6}}</ref> However, while the term "anorexia nervosa" literally means "neurotic loss of appetite", the literal meaning of the term is somewhat misleading.

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by attempts to lose weight, sometimes to the point of starvation. A person with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a number of signs and symptoms, the type and severity of which may vary in each case and may be present but not readily apparent. Anorexia nervosa, and the associated [[malnutrition]] that results from self-imposed [[starvation]], can cause severe [[complication (medicine)|complication]]s in every major [[organ system]] in the body.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Gastric electromechanical and neurohormonal function in anorexia nervosa |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=958–65 |year=1987 |pmid=3653645|last1=Abell|first1=TL|last2=Malagelada|first2=JR|last3=Lucas|first3=AR|last4=Brown|first4=ML|last5=Camilleri|first5=M|last6=Go|first6=VL|last7=Azpiroz|first7=F|last8=Callaway|first8=CW|last9=Kao|first9=PC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ulger Z, Gürses D, Ozyurek AR, Arikan C, Levent E, Aydoğdu S |title=Follow-up of cardiac abnormalities in female adolescents with anorexia nervosa after refeeding |journal=Acta Cardiologica |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=43–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16485732 |doi=10.2143/AC.61.1.2005139}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Støving RK, Hangaard J, Hagen C |title=Update on endocrine disturbances in anorexia nervosa |journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=459–80 |year=2001|pmid=11393567|doi=10.1515/JPEM.2001.14.5.459|last2=Hangaard|last3=Hagen}}</ref>

[[Hypokalaemia]], a drop in the level of [[potassium]] in the blood, is a sign of anorexia nervosa. A significant drop in potassium can cause abnormal heart rhythms, constipation, fatigue, muscle damage and paralysis.

Between 50% and 75% of individuals with an eating disorder experience depression. In addition, one in every four individuals who are diagnosed with anorexia nervosa also exhibit [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Anorexia, Bulimia | volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=86–92 |year=2003}}</ref>

Recent findings suggest that the prevalent symptoms for anorexia nervosa (as discussed above) such as decreased body temperature, obsessive-compulsivity, and changes in psychological state, can actually be attributed to symptoms of starvation. This theory can be supported by a past study involving rats who were only fed a certain amount (at a certain time) each day; these rats showed dramatic increases in their activity on the wheel in their cage at times when not being fed. These findings could explain why those with anorexia nervosa are often seen excessively exercising; their overactivity is the result of fasting, and by increasing their activity they could raise their body temperature, increase their chances of stumbling upon food, or could distract them from their desire for food (because they do not, in fact, lose their appetite). While it is commonly believed that those with AN do not have a normal appetite, this is not the case. Those with AN are typically obsessive about food, cooking often for others, but not eating the food themselves. Despite the fact that the physiological cause behind each case of anorexia nervosa is different, the most common theme seen across the board is the element of self-control. Therefore, when looking at the underlying cause behind the disorder, one would see that it is rarely about the food itself; it is about the individual attempting to gain complete control over an aspect of their lives, in order to prove themselves, and distract them from another aspect of their lives they wish they could control; they pride themselves on the ability to resist the temptation of food, even in the case of extreme hunger. For example, a child who with a destructive family life restricting their food intake in order to compensate for the chaos occurring at home.<ref>Carlson, Neil R.

==Anorexia nervosa vs. bulimia nervosa==
Although anorexia nervosa has many similarities with [[bulimia nervosa]], a critical difference between the two is that anorexia nervosa is also partly caused by the personality traits of perfectionism and obsessive compulsive tendencies. Whereas the main reason motivating people with bulimia nervosa tends to be self-perceived body image, people affected with anorexia nervosa are also driven to diet based on their desperate need to retain some control in their lives. For many, monitoring their food intake is the only control they can have.<ref name=Yager/> It is not uncommon for those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa to also exhibit symptoms of bulimia nervosa, such as binging and purging and vice-versa.<ref>United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information: Drug Information for the Health Care Professional.

==Medical complications==
Anorexia nervosa can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation or prior to attaining peak bone mass.<ref name="medical">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0968(200003)8:2<170::AID-ERV338>3.0.CO;2-Y|title=Medical complications of anorexia nervosa in children and young adolescents|year=2000|last1=Nicholls|first1=Dasha|last2=Stanhope|first2=Richard|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=8|issue=2|page=170}}
</ref> Complications specific to adolescents and children with anorexia nervosa can include the following:
:*Growth retardation – height gain may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed.<ref name="medical"/> Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of illness are not significant and/or if the illness is accompanied with delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may negate the deleterious effects of undernutrition on stature by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls.<ref name="pediatrics">{{cite pmid|18519455}}</ref> In such cases, appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects due to the aforementioned reasons in addition to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing [[adipose tissue]] levels compared to premorbid levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nelson LR, Bulun SE |title=Estrogen production and action |journal=J.

:*Pubertal delay or arrest – both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotrophins in patients with anorexia nervosa has been frequently documented.<ref name="medical"/> However, a study demonstrated that growth hormone levels were not a predictor of height measures in anorexic patients, which is suggestive of a resistance to growth hormone effects at the growth plate, similar to the resistance to growth hormone of bone-formation markers.<ref name="pediatrics"/> Instead, insulin-like growth factor had a larger effect, with lower IGF-I levels and longer durations of illness tending to result in lower height measures than vice versa, although IGF-I levels in anorexic subjects may not necessarily be low enough to affect height measures.<ref name="pediatrics"/> In some cases, especially where onset is pre-pubertal, physical consequences such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually fully reversible.<ref name="CG9FullGuideline">{{cite journal|journal=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health|year=2004 |title=Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf}}</ref>

===Environmental===
Sociocultural studies have highlighted the role of cultural factors, such as the promotion of thinness as the ideal female form in Western industrialized nations, particularly through the media. There is a necessary connection between anorexia nervosa and culture and whether culture is a cause, a trigger, or merely a kind of social address or envelope which determines in which segments of society or in which cultures anorexia nervosa will appear. The strong thesis of this connection is that culture acts as a cause by providing a blueprint for anorexia nervosa. A moderate thesis is that a specific cultural factors trigger the illness which is determined by many factors including family interactions, individual psychology, or biological predisposition. Culture change can trigger the emergence of anorexia in adolescent girls from immigrant families living in highly industrialized Western Societies.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1177/136346159002700401}}</ref> A recent epidemiological study of 989,871 Swedish residents indicated that [[gender]], [[ethnicity]] and [[socio-economic status]] were large influences on the chance of developing anorexia, with those with non-European parents among the least likely to be diagnosed with the condition, and those in wealthy, white families being most at risk.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lindberg L, Hjern A |title=Risk factors for anorexia nervosa: a national cohort study |journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=397–408 |year=2003 |pmid=14566927 |doi=10.1002/eat.10221}}</ref> People in professions where there is a particular social pressure to be thin (such as [[model (person)|models]] and [[dancer]]s) were much more likely to develop anorexia during the course of their career,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Garner DM, Garfinkel PE |title=Socio-cultural factors in the development of anorexia nervosa |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=647–56 |year=1980 |pmid=7208724 |doi=10.1017/S0033291700054945}}</ref> and further research has suggested that those with anorexia have much higher contact with cultural sources that promote weight-loss.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Toro J, Salamero M, Martinez E |title=Assessment of sociocultural influences on the aesthetic body shape model in anorexia nervosa |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=147–51 |year=1994 |pmid=8178671 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1994.tb08084.x}}</ref>

It has been suggested that anorexia nervosa results from a sexually selected evolutionary drive to appear youthful in populations in which size becomes the primary indicator of age.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lozano, GA |title=Obesity and sexually selected anorexia nervosa |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=71 |pages=933–940 |year=2008 | doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2008.07.013 |pmid=18760541|issue=6}}</ref>

There is also evidence to suggest that patients who have anorexia nervosa can be characterised by [[alexithymia]]<ref>{{Cite pmid|19517577}}</ref> and also a deficit in certain emotional functions. A research study showed that this was the case in both adult and adolescent anorexia nervosa patients.<ref>{{Cite pmid|11942427}}</ref>

There is a high rate of reported child sexual abuse experiences in clinical groups of who have been diagnosed with anorexia. The connection between eating disorders and abuse has been convincingly evidenced by a number of studies, including one published in Epidemiology (and strengthened by blind hypothesis survey), which showed in a comparison of women with no history of eating disorders, women with a history of eating disorders were twice as likely to have reported childhood sexual abuse.<ref name="RayworthBeth">{{cite journal|pmid=15097006|jstor=20485891|pages=271–278|last1=Rayworth|first1=B.

Recent efforts have been made to dispel some of the myths around anorexia nervosa and eating disorders, such as the misconception that families, in particular mothers, are responsible for their daughter developing an eating disorder.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4363304.stm Lessons for Parents of Anorexics].

====Media effects====
Media are among the principal social agents in many societies around the world. Television, magazines, newspapers, radio, cinema, advertising, the Internet, and other so-called "new media" or "new technologies" are the principal factors behind body dissatisfaction, concerns about weight, and disordered eating behaviour. Mass media interventions frequently offer a distorted vision of the world, and it may be difficult for children and adolescents to distinguish whether what they see is real or not, so that they are more vulnerable to the messages transmitted. Field, Cheung, et al.'s survey of 548 preadolescent and adolescent girls found that 69% acknowledged that images in magazines had influenced their conception of the ideal body, while 47% reported that they wanted to lose weight after seeing such images.<ref name=j1>{{cite doi|10.1080/15213269.2010.525737}}</ref> There was also the survey by Utter et al. who studied 4,746 adolescent boys and girls demonstrating the tendency of magazine articles and advertisements to activate weight concerns and weight management behaviour. He discovered that girls who frequently read fashion and glamour magazines and girls who frequently read articles about diets and issues related to weight loss were seven times more likely to practice a range of unhealthy weight control behaviours and six times more likely to engage in extremely unhealthy weight control behaviours (e.g., taking diet pills, vomiting, using laxatives, and using diuretics) <ref name=j1/> from magazines, websites that stress the message of thinness as the ideal have surfaced the internet and has managed to embed itself as an increasing source of influence. The possibility that pro-anorexia websites may reinforce restrictive eating and exercise behaviours is an area of concern. Pro-anorexia websites contain images and writing that support the pursuit of an ideal thin body image. Research has shown that these websites stress thinness as the ideal choice for women and in some websites ideal images of muscularity and thinness for men <ref name="Juarez, L. 2012">{{cite pmid|22364342}}</ref> It has also been shown that women who had viewed these websites at least once had a decrease in self-esteem and reports also show an increased likelihood of future engagement in many negative behaviours related to food, exercise, and weight.<ref name="Juarez, L. 2012"/> Evidence of the value of thinness in majority U.S culture is found in Hollywood's elite and the media promotion of waif models in fashion and celebrity circles (e.g. [[Nicole Richie]], [[Mary Kate Olsen]], [[Kate Moss]], and [[Lady Gaga]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Richard|title=The Performance Identities of Lady Gaga|year=2012|publisher=McFarland and Company Inc.

==Diagnosis==

===Medical===
The initial diagnosis should be made by a [[Competence (human resources)|competent]] [[Medical doctor|medical professional]]. There are multiple medical conditions, such as viral or [[bacterial infection]]s, [[Hormone imbalance|hormonal imbalances]], [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative diseases]] and [[brain tumor]]s which may mimic psychiatric disorders including anorexia nervosa.
According to an in depth study conducted by psychiatrist Richard Hall as published in the [[Archives of General Psychiatry]]:'''
* Medical illness often presents with psychiatric symptoms.
* It is difficult to distinguish physical disorders from functional psychiatric disorders on the basis of psychiatric symptoms alone.
* Detailed physical examination and laboratory screening are indicated as a [[Medical guideline|routine procedure]] in the initial evaluation of psychiatric patients.
*Most patients are unaware of the medical illness that is causative of their psychiatric symptoms.
*The conditions of patients with medically induced symptoms are often initially misdiagnosed as a functional psychosis.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hall RC, Popkin MK, Devaul RA, Faillace LA, Stickney SK |title=Physical illness presenting as psychiatric disease |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=1315–20 |year=1978 |pmid=568461}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hall RC, Gardner ER, Stickney SK, LeCann AF, Popkin MK |title=Physical illness manifesting as psychiatric disease.

*'''Criticisms of DSM-IV and Diagnosing Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa''' – There have been criticisms over the diagnostic criteria utilized for anorexia nervosa in the DSM- IV and its applicability in diagnosing adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Several criticisms of the DSM-IV in diagnosing adolescents with anorexia nervosa are:
:*Fulfillment of DSM- IV criteria B and C for anorexia nervosa are dependent on complex abstract reasoning, the capacity to describe internal experiences, and the ability to perceive risk.<ref name="Classifications">Workgroup for Classification of Eating Disorders in Children and Adolescents. "Classifications of Eating Disturbance in Children and Adolescents: Proposed Changes for the DSM-V". European Eating Disorders Review, 2010,p.81</ref> While formal thought emerges between ages 11–13, complex abstract reasoning continues to develop late into adolescence. The ability to perceive risk also continues to develop through adolescence, as some preadolescents have difficult perceiving the relative risk of alternative outcomes.<ref name="Classifications"/> Adolescents and children must first develop these internal thought processes in order to then endorse fear of weight gain or distortion of body image, and deny the seriousness of low body weight despite their behaviors that contribute to harmful weight loss, which are necessary to fulfill criteria B and C.<ref name="Currently">Knoll, S., Bulik, C., & Hebebrand, J. "Do the currently proposed DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa adequately consider developmental aspects in children and adolescents?". Early Adolescent Psychiatry, 2011,p.96</ref> These developmental factors may impede an adolescent or child from receiving a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. It is the hope of certain professionals that the DSM-V will take the unique developmental stages of children and adolescents into account when revising the current criteria. One proposed amendment would be to allow behavioral indicators as a means of substituting internally referenced cognitive criteria.<ref name="Classifications"/>
:*Another criticism focuses on the current weight criteria specified to receive a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. Critics state that there is wide variability in the rate, timing and magnitude of both height and weight gain during normal puberty.<ref>Journal of Adolescent Health. "Eating Disorders in Adolescents: Position Paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine". 2003,33,p.496</ref> Physical development varies greatly during puberty, making it a challenge to define an optimal weight range for a growing child or adolescents.<ref name="Currently"/>
*[[ICD|ICD-10]]: The criteria are similar, but in addition, specifically mention:
# The ways that individuals might induce weight-loss or maintain low body weight (avoiding fattening foods, self-induced vomiting, self-induced purging, excessive exercise, excessive use of appetite suppressants or diuretics).
# If onset is before puberty, that development is delayed or arrested.
# Certain physiological features, including ''"widespread [[endocrine]] disorder involving [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]]-[[pituitary]]-[[gonad]]al axis is manifest in women as [[amenorrhoea]] and in men as loss of sexual interest and potency. There may also be elevated levels of [[growth hormone]]s, raised [[cortisol]] levels, changes in the peripheral [[metabolism]] of [[thyroid]] hormone and abnormalities of insulin secretion"''.

Dr. Hilde Bruch, in her 1973 book, ''Eating Disorders: Obesity, Anorexia Nervosa, and the Person Within'', explains that Anorexia Nervosa is "not a static condition," but one that continually provokes new problems with its various stages. She writes, "The state of starvation is associated by marked psychological changes&nbsp;... camouflaged by rationalizations." She identifies the family interaction becomes difficult, marked by rising anxiety, annoyance and resentment. It also brings about social isolation. (Bruch 215).

Dr. Bruch believed that anorexia, which is simply not eating enough, as a result from schizophrenia, depression, or esophageal problems often were misdiagnosed as ''anorexia nervosa''. In her assessment, this blurred the definition of anorexia nervosa. For this reason, she distinguished between, what she calls "atypical" and "primary" cases of anorexia nervosa. The atypical cases of anorexia were brought about by a range of stimuli (from schizophrenia to depression, as noted above). (Bruch 227).

In contrast to the atypical group, Bruch observed ''primary'', or ''genuine anorexia nervosa'', "amazingly uniform". The first outstanding symptom is "disturbance of delusional proportions in the body image". The second outstanding characteristic is "disturbance in the accuracy of their perception or cognitive interpretation of stimuli arising from the body&nbsp;... failure to recognize hunger and denial of fatigue". The third outstanding characteristic is a "paralyzing sense of ineffectiveness". "Anorexics struggle against a feeling of enslaved, exploited, and not being permitted to lead a life of their own. They would rather starve than continue a life of accommodation. In this blind search for a sense of identity and selfhood they will not accept anything that their parents, or the world around them, has to offer." It is a "desperate struggle for a self respecting identity". She understood that the personality disorder (struggle for control, for a sense of identity, competence, and effectiveness) precedes the somatic disorders (such as emaciation, amenorrhea, constipation, etc.) (Bruch 250–255).

===Differential diagnoses===
{{Main|Anorexia nervosa (differential diagnoses)}}There are various medical and psychological conditions that have been misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa, in some cases the correct diagnosis was not made for more than ten years. In a reported case of [[achalasia]] misdiagnosed as AN, the patient spent two months confined to a psychiatric hospital.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Marshall JB, Russell JL |title=Achalasia mistakenly diagnosed as eating disorder and prompting prolonged psychiatric hospitalization |journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=86 |issue=12 |pages=1405–7 |year=1993 |pmid=8272922 |doi=10.1097/00007611-199312000-00019}}</ref>

There are various other psychological issues that may factor into anorexia nervosa, some fulfill the criteria for a separate Axis I [[diagnosis]] or a personality disorder which is coded [[Axis II (psychiatry)|Axis II]] and thus are considered [[comorbid]] to the diagnosed eating disorder. Axis II disorders are subtyped into 3 "clusters", A, B and C.The [[causality]] between personality disorders and eating disorders has yet to be fully established.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Rosenvinge JH, Martinussen M, Ostensen E |title=The comorbidity of eating disorders and personality disorders: a meta-analytic review of studies published between 1983 and 1998 |journal=Eating and Weight Disorders |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=52–61 |year=2000 |pmid=10941603}}</ref> Some people have a previous disorder which may increase their vulnerability to developing an eating disorder.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kaye WH, Bulik CM, Thornton L, Barbarich N, Masters K |title=Comorbidity of anxiety disorders with anorexia and bulimia nervosa |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=12 |pages=2215–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15569892 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2215}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Thornton C, Russell J |title=Obsessive compulsive comorbidity in the dieting disorders |journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=83–7 |year=1997 |pmid=8986521 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(199701)21:1<83::AID-EAT10>3.0.CO;2-P}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Vitousek K, Manke F |title=Personality variables and disorders in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=137–47 |year=1994 |pmid=8040475 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.103.1.137}}</ref> Some develop them afterwards.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Braun DL, Sunday SR, Halmi KA |title=Psychiatric comorbidity in patients with eating disorders |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=859–67 |year=1994 |pmid=7892354 |doi=10.1017/S0033291700028956}}</ref> The severity and type of eating disorder symptoms have been shown to affect comorbidity.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Spindler A, Milos G |title=Links between eating disorder symptom severity and psychiatric comorbidity |journal=Eating Behaviors |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=364–73 |year=2007|pmid=17606234 |doi=10.1016/j.eatbeh.2006.11.012}}</ref>

*[[Body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD) is listed as a [[somatoform disorder]] that affects up to 2% of the population. BDD is characterized by excessive [[Rumination (psychology)|rumination]] over an actual or perceived physical flaw. BDD has been diagnosed equally among men and women. While BDD has been misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa, it also occurs comorbidly in 25% to 39% of AN cases.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12210643 | doi=10.1002/eat.10091 | volume=32 | issue=3 | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | year=2002 | title = Body dysmorphic disorder in patients with anorexia nervosa: Prevalence, clinical features, and delusionality of body image | pages=291–300 | author=Grant JE, Kim SW, Eckert ED}}</ref>
BDD is a chronic and debilitating condition which may lead to social isolation, major depression, suicidal ideation and attempts. Neuroimaging studies to measure response to facial recognition have shown activity predominately in the left hemisphere in the left [[lateral prefrontal cortex]], lateral [[temporal lobe]] and left [[parietal lobe]] showing hemispheric imbalance in information processing. There is a reported case of the development of BDD in a 21 year old male following an inflammatory brain process.

The distinction between the diagnoses of anorexia nervosa, [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[eating disorder not otherwise specified]] (EDNOS) is often difficult to make as there is considerable overlap between patients diagnosed with these conditions. Seemingly minor changes in a patient's overall behavior or attitude can change a diagnosis from "anorexia: binge-eating type" to bulimia nervosa. It is not unusual for a person with an eating disorder to "move through" various diagnoses as his or her behavior and beliefs change over time.<ref name="Zucker1">{{Cite journal|author=Zucker NL, Losh M, Bulik CM, LaBar KS, Piven J, Pelphrey KA |title=Anorexia nervosa and autism spectrum disorders: guided investigation of social cognitive endophenotypes |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |issue=6 |pages=976–1006 |year=2007 |pmid=17967091 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.6.976 |url=http://www.duke.edu/web/mind/level2/faculty/labar/pdfs/Zucker_et_al_2007.pdf}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no conclusive evidence that any particular treatment for anorexia nervosa work better than others, however, there is enough evidence to suggest that early intervention and treatment are more effective.<ref>{{cite pmid|19445758}}</ref> Treatment for anorexia nervosa tries to address three main areas. 
* Restoring the person to a healthy weight; 
* Treating the psychological disorders related to the illness; 
* Reducing or eliminating behaviours or thoughts that originally led to the disordered eating.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = National Institute of Mental Health | url = http://wwwapps.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/eating-disorders/complete-publication.shtml#pub3|title=Anorexia Nervosa}}</ref>

=== Dietary ===
Diet is the most essential factor to work on in patients with anorexia nervosa, and must be tailored to each patient's needs. Initial meal plans may be low in calories, about 1200, in order to build comfort in eating, and then food amount can gradually be increased. Food variety is important when establishing meal plans as well as foods that are higher in energy density. Other more specific dietary treatments are listed below.<ref name="nutrition">Whitnet, E. and Rolfes, S. R. (2011).

*[[Zinc]] supplementation has been shown in various studies to be beneficial in the treatment of AN even in patients not suffering from zinc deficiency, by helping to increase weight gain.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Safai-Kutti S |title=Oral zinc supplementation in anorexia nervosa |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica.

Vegetarianism is adapted by many patients with eating disorders because it is widely acclaimed as healthy and easy to manage calorie intake.<ref>{{cite pmid|8477292}}</ref> Sufficient Zinc must be available during recovery, and normal zinc levels were seen in the Notre Dame study to increase weight gain at a faster rate. Zinc supplementation can also help reduce reproductive issues for patients with anorexia nervosa. [[Leptin]], a hormone regulating hunger and metabolism, levels decrease from zinc deficiency and even more with patients due to the reduction in size of adipose tissue. Reproductive tissues have recently been discovered to contain leptin receptors, thus a decrease in leptin concentration would lead to a lower rate of fertility. Unfortunately, despite the connection to weight gain and reproduction, zinc supplementation seems to be largely under-appreciated and many do not consider zinc deficiency as an important factor in regard to anorexia nervosa.<ref>{{cite pmid|10801965}}</ref>

*[[Calories]] Patients must be fed adequate calories at a measured pace for improvement of their condition to occur. The best level for calorie intake is to start by providing 1200 to 1500 calories daily and increasing this amount by 500 each day. This process should continue until the level of 4000 calories (for male patients) or 3500 calories (for female patients) This system should also decrease effects such as [[apathy]], [[lethargy]], and food-related obsessions.<ref name=Yager>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMcp050187}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The long term prognosis of anorexia is more on the favorable side. The [[National Comorbidity Survey|National Comorbidity Replication Survey]] was conducted among more than 9,282 participants throughout the United States, the results found that the average duration of anorexia nervosa is 1.7 years. ''"Contrary to what people may believe, anorexia is not necessarily a chronic illness; in many cases, it runs its course and people get better&nbsp;..."''<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hudson JI, Hiripi E, Pope HG, Kessler RC |title=The Prevalence and Correlates of Eating Disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=348–58 |year=2007 |pmid=16815322 |pmc=1892232 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.03.040}}</ref> However, 5–20% of people diagnosed with anorexia nervosa die from it, and the cause of death is mostly because of the direct health effects of the eating disorder to the body.<ref>Shaw, Gina.

In cases of adolescent anorexia nervosa that utilize [[Maudsley Family Therapy|family-based treatment]] 75% of patients have a good outcome and an additional 15% show an intermediate yet more positive outcome.<ref name="Eisler2000"/> In a five-year post treatment follow-up of Maudsley Family Therapy the full recovery rate was between 75% and 90%.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Eisler I, Le Grange D, Asen KE |chapter=Family interventions |editor=Treasure J, Schmidt U, van Furth E |title=Handbook of eating disorders |edition=2nd |location=Chichester |publisher=Wiley |year=2003 |pages=291–310}}</ref>

Some remedies, however, are proven to not have any value in resolving anorexia – "incarceration in hospital", which prohibits the patient from many basic privileges, such as using the bathroom independently, has been seen as catalysts in increasing weight and pushing patients away from the path to recovery.<ref>{{Cite pmid|17463461}}</ref>

Even in severe cases of AN, despite a noted 30% relapse rate after hospitalization, and a lengthy time to recovery ranging from 57 to 79 months, the full recovery rate was still 76%. There were minimal cases of relapse even at the long term follow-up conducted between 10–15 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Strober M, Freeman R, Morrell W |title=The long-term course of severe anorexia nervosa in adolescents: survival analysis of recovery, relapse, and outcome predictors over 10–15 years in a prospective study |journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=339–60 |year=1997 |pmid=9356884 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(199712)22:4<339::AID-EAT1>3.0.CO;2-N}}</ref> The long-term prognosis of anorexia nervosa is changeable: a fifth of patients stay severely ill, another fifth of patients recover fully and three fifths of patients have a fluctuating and chronic course.<ref name=Gelder/>

Although overall the prognosis may seem favorable, this is not the case for all patients of Anorexia Nervosa. Among psychiatric disorders, Anorexia Nervosa has one of the highest mortality rates because of side effects of the disorder, such as cardiac complications or suicide. In intermediate to long-term studies with juveniles, death rates, on average, have ranged anywhere from 1.8–14.1%.<ref name=Strober/> Recovery can be lifelong for some, energy intake and eating habits may never return to normal.<ref name="nutrition"/> Many studies have attempted to study relapse and recovery through longitudinal studies but this is difficult, time consuming, and costly. 
Recovery is also viewed on a spectrum rather than black and white. According to the Morgan-Russell criteria patients can have a good, intermediate, or poor outcome. Even when a patient is classified as having a "good" outcome, weight only has to be within 15% of average and normal menstruation must be present in females. The good outcome also excludes psychological health. Recovery for patients with Anorexia Nervosa is undeniably positive, but recovery does not mean normal.<ref name=Strober>{{cite pmid|9356884}}</ref>

===Relapse===
According to the Eckert study, relapse is greatest in the first year after normal body weight is obtained. This includes right after release from inpatient institutions. Relapse includes a return to food restriction as well as a shift to binge eating habits. 
As stated above, higher energy density in dietary plans is important. Patients with lower dietary energy density in their meals, prior to being discharged, had worse outcomes within the year, therefore a higher likelihood of relapse. This is speculated to be due to fat and fluid consumption. Patients whose dietary plans included fats and foods containing fats were forced to eat a more realistic and "normal" plan than those with lower energy density. Therefore, when released from inpatient treatment, the patients with higher dietary energy density plans had adopted healthier and more balanced eating habits. A greater food variety in inpatient dietary plans may help lower rates of relapse as well.<ref>{{cite pmid|21448937}}</ref>
Relapse, binging or starving after initial weight gain, occurs in 40%–70% of Anorexia patients.<ref name="Halmi">{{cite doi|10.1016/0006-3223(96)84502-1}}</ref> Prevention of relapse can be helped by cognitive-behaviorial therapy, as well as, pharmacological therapies.<ref name="Halmi"/> Link of [[OCD]] with anorexia shows treatments for OCD such as serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|(SSRI)]] helps is preventing relapse.<ref name="Halmi"/>

Several clinically significant variables that could predict relapse among AN patients were identified in a study conducted by a team at the University of Toronto. First, patients with binge-purge type AN were twice as likely to have a relapse as those with restricting subtype AN. The second predictor of relapse was the level of motivation to recover.When patients’ motivation to recover fell during the first 4 weeks of inpatient treatment, the risk of relapse rose. The third predictor identified in the study was higher pre-treatment severity of checking behaviors, as reported on the Padua Inventory (PI) Checking Behavior scale, a measure of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms. <ref>{{cite journal|title= Tackling Relapse Among Anorexia Nervosa Patients|journal=Eating Disorders Review |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=2013 |url=http://www.eatingdisordersreview.com/nl/nl_edr_24_1_4.html}}</ref>

The history of anorexia nervosa begins with descriptions of religious fasting dating from the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic era]] <ref name="content.karger">{{cite pmid|15539770}}</ref> and continuing into the medieval period. A number of well known historical figures, including [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] are believed to have suffered from the condition.<ref name=hep>Hepworth, Julie (1999) ''The Social Construction of Anorexia Nervosa''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, ISBN 0-7619-5309-4.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=3912990|year=1985|last1=McSherry|first1=JA|title=Was Mary, Queen of Scots, anorexic?|volume=30|issue=4|pages=243–5|journal=Scottish medical journal}}</ref>

Of interest in terms of anorexia nervosa is the medieval practice of self-starvation by women, including some young women, in the name of religious piety and purity. This is sometimes referred to as [[anorexia mirabilis]]. By the thirteenth century, it was increasingly common for women to participate in religious life . Many women who ultimately became saints engaged in self-starvation, including [[Saint Hedwig of Andechs]] in the thirteenth century and Catherine of Siena in the fourteenth century. By the time of Catherine of Siena, however, the Church became concerned about extreme fasting as an indicator of spirituality and as a criterion for sainthood. Indeed, Catherine of Siena was told by Church authorities to pray that she would be able to eat again, but was unable to give up fasting.<ref name=hep/>

The earliest medical descriptions of anorexic illnesses are generally credited to English physician [[Richard Morton (physician)|Richard Morton]], in 1689.<ref name="content.karger" /> Case descriptions fitting anorexic illnesses continued throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th century. They include the cases of an 18 year old girl treated by Richard Morton in 1689 who refused to eat and died 3 months later.<ref name="Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland 1894 309">{{cite book|last=Sir William Withey Gull|editor=T D Acland |year=1894|page= 309|title=Medical Papers}}</ref> Noah Webster writes of an instructor at Yale College in the 1770s who refused to eat because he believed food was "dulling his mind." <ref>{{cite book|last=Kendall|first=Joshua C.|title=The Forgotten Founding Father: Noah Webster's Obsession and the Creation of an American Culture|year=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-399-15699-1|page=368}}</ref> 

However it was not until the late 19th century that anorexia nervosa was to be widely accepted by the medical profession as a recognised condition. In 1873, [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], one of Queen Victoria's personal physicians, published a seminal paper which established the term ''anorexia nervosa'' and provided a number of detailed case descriptions and treatments. However, Gull was unable to provide an explanation for anorexia nervosa <ref name="Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland 1894 309"/> In the same year, French physician [[Charles Lasègue|Ernest-Charles Lasègue]] similarly published details of a number of cases in a paper entitled ''De l'Anorexie Histerique''.

Awareness of the condition was largely limited to the medical profession until the latter part of the 20th century, when German-American psychoanalyst [[Hilde Bruch]] published her popular work ''The Golden Cage: the Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa'' in 1978. This book created a wider awareness of anorexia nervosa among lay readers. A further important event was the death of the popular singer drummer [[Karen Carpenter]] in 1983, which prompted widespread ongoing media coverage of eating disorders. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness and<ref>{{cite pmid|16134111}}</ref> continues to be in the public eye. "[[Pro-ana]]" websites range from those claiming to be a safe-space for anorexics to discuss their problems, to those supporting anorexia as a lifestyle choice and offering "thinspiration," or photos and videos of thin or emaciated women. A survey by Internet security firm [[Optenet]] found a 470% increase in pro-ana and pro-mia sites from 2006 to 2007.<ref>{{citation |title=A survey by Internet security firm Optenet found a 470% increase in pro-ana and pro-mia sites from 2006 to 2007}}</ref> Many celebrities have come forward discussing their struggles with anorexia, increasing awareness of the disease.

==Research==
*[[Marinol]] (dronabinol): a synthetic form of delta-9-THC a [[psychoactive]] compound extracted from the [[resin]] of the [[cannabis sativa]] plant is currently the subject of a [[clinical trial]] for use in the treatment of AN, the study ended in 2011.<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00760695 Cannabinoid Receptor (CB1) Agonist Treatment in Severe Chronic Anorexia Nervosa]. clinicaltrials.gov. September 25, 2008</ref>
*[[Ghrelin|Ghrelin treatment]]: [[Pilot experiment|pilot studies]] have been concluded in the use of ghrelin [[Intravenous therapy|infusion]] for the inhospital treatment of patients with AN. The results showed positive effect in the reduction of the associated gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in [[appetite]] and energy intake without [[adverse effect]]s.<ref name="Hotta2009"/>
*[[Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid]]: The ethyl-eicosapentaenoate supplements were combined with Forceval, a multivitamin and mineral supplement. The results showed rapid improvement in diet, weight, and mood after three months, but this is just the tip of research on N-3 fatty acids such as ethyl-eicosapentaenoate.<ref>{{cite pmid|15276668}}</ref>
