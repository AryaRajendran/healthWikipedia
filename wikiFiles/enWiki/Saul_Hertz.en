'''Saul Hertz''', M.D. (April 20, 1905 – July 28, 1950) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] who discovered the use of [[radioactive iodine]] for the treatment of [[thyroid disease]].

==Early life and education==
Hertz was born on April 20, 1905, to Aaron Daniel (A.D.) Hertz and Bertha Hertz in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Europe who raised their seven boys according to Orthodox traditions. His father was a successful real estate developer. He attended public school, and then graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] with Phi Beta Kappa honors. He received his M.D from  [[Harvard Medical School]]   in 1929, and performed his internship and residency at Cleveland's Mount Sinai Hospital.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first= Ian |editor1-last= Hay |title= Clinical Endocrine Oncology |edition= 2nd |year= 2008 |publisher= Blackwell |isbn= 978-1-4051-4584-8  |pages= xvi-xx }}</ref>

==Early studies with radioactive Iodine==
Hertz  joined  the Thyroid Clinic and Metabolism Laboratories at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in 1931.<ref>John Bruton Stanbury's book, ''A constant ferment: a history of the Thyroid Clinic and Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, 1913-1990'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=mTJsAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Saul+Hertz%22&dq=%22Saul+Hertz%22&hl=en&ei=qDrCTIPWAcH_lgemgbED&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBzgU]</ref>  

Hertz served as Chief of the Thyroid Clinic from 1931-1943. In 1936, he   asked  [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] president   [[Karl Compton]], “Could iodine be made artificially radioactive?” <ref>American Thyroid Association. 74th Annual meeting of the American thyroid association program and abstracts. California: VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, 2002;17. (digital copy available from the American Thyroid Association (http://www.thyroid.org/ann_mtg/2003_75th/documents/endowment_donors.pdf)</ref>   Compton responded in a letter to Dr. Hertz on December 15, 1936, describing radioactive iodine.<ref>Compton, Karl T. (1936 December 15). Letter to Dr. S. Hertz. Courtesy of the MIT Archives.</ref>

In 1937, in collaboration with the physicist [[Arthur Roberts (physicist)|Arthur Roberts]] of MIT, he began studies in rabbits to evaluate the effects of   I-128 produced in very small quantities by neutron bombardment on the thyroid.<ref name="MGH News">{{cite journal |last1= Bander |first1= Martin |year= 1987 |title= Remembering the Early Days of Nuclear Medicine |journal= MGH News |volume= 46 |issue= 6 |pages= 5–6 |publisher= Massachusetts General Hospital }}</ref> The experiment involving 48 rabbits demonstrated the tracer capabilities of [[radioactive iodine]] and its effects on the [[thyroid gland]]. The   studies showed that the [[hyperplastic]] [[thyroid gland]] absorbed more of the radioactive substance than the normal gland.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Hertz |first1= S. |last2= Roberts |first2= A. |year= 1940 |title= Radioactive Iodine as an Indicator in Thyroid Physiology |journal= The American Journal of Physiology |volume= 128 |issue= 3 |pages= 565–576 }}</ref> This proved the tracer qualities of the radioactive substance.<ref>Soley M, Miller E,. Symposium on Endocrinology: Treatment of Graves’ Disease with Radioactive iodine.''Medical Clinics of North America'' 1948 32;3-17.</ref> The tracer procedure was critical for determining the amount of iodine the human thyroid took up so that a calculation of the dosage of radioactive iodine could be calibrated for treatment.<ref>Hertz S, Roberts A, Salter WT.

==Human treatment with radioactive iodine==
[[Image:Hertz-experiment.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Dr. Hertz doing an experiment|Dr. Saul Hertz uses a multicounter]]
Human studies required a better source of the radioactive Iodine. The building of the [[cyclotron]] at MIT was funded for $30,000 by the Mary Markle Foundation of New York City in 1938. The construction project that was completed two years later in 1940. During those two years, the experiments with rabbits continued.<ref name="Vignette"/>

In January 1941, Hertz administered [[cyclotron]] produced a I-130 - I-131 mixture as a therapeutic dose to the first human patient at MGH, to a patient with Graves’ hyperthyroidism, or [[Graves' disease]].<ref>Fragu, Philippe, How the field of thyroid endocrinology developed in France after World War II, ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 1948 77,2:393-414.''</ref> This was the first successful treatment of humans with an artificially produced radioactive material.<ref>Hertz S, Roberts A, Means JH, Evans RD. Radioactive iodine as an indicator in thyroid physiology, II: iodine collection by normal and hyperplastic thyroids in rabbits. ''American journal of physiology''  1940; 565 - 576.</ref>

Gradually a series of 29 patients were treated and documented. The [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] published “Radioactive Iodine in the Study of Thyroid Physiology”, May 1946. This article was a five year follow up study of the 29 patients and documented the successful treatment and safety of [[radioactive iodine]] for the treatment of [[hyperthyroidism]]. The follow-up study firmly launched the use of radioactive iodine therapy as a standard treatment for [[Graves’ disease]].<ref name="Vignette">Hertz, Barbara, Schuleller, Kristin, Saul Hertz, MD (1905 - 1950) A Pioneer in the Use of Radioactive Iodine, ''Endocrine Practice'' 2010 16,4;713-715.</ref>

==World War II==
In 1943, Hertz joined the Navy Medical Corps. He was part of the [[Manhattan Project]] for Biology and Medicine in furthering medical uses of atomic energy.<ref>Fragu, Philippe, How the field of thyroid endocrinology developed in France after World War II, ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine,'' 1948 77,2:393-414.</ref> He served as a Commander and continued his service in the Naval Reserves.<ref name="Medical Way"/>

==Nuclear fission products in cancer treatment==
As the interest in atomic energy for peaceful purposes was heightened, after the explosion of the atomic bomb, Hertz established the Radioactive Isotope Research Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1946. Its purpose was to apply fission products to the treatment of [[thyroid cancer]], [[goiter]], and other malignant growths. He worked with the government to centralize an agency to handle the distribution of [[radioactive isotopes]] for use by private enterprises working on approved projects.<ref name="Harvard Crimson">Vincent, Donald. (1949 May 24). Hertz to Use Nuclear Fission in Cure for Cancer. ''The [[Harvard Crimson]]'', May 24, 1949.</ref> He made extensive studies of [[radioactive iodine]] in the  treatment of [[thyroid cancer]] as well as in the production of total thyroidectomy in the treatment of certain cases of [[heart disease]].<ref name="MGH News"/> Hertz studied the application of radioactive [[phosphorus]] and the influences of hormones on cancer as displayed by isotope studies.<ref name="Medical Way"/>

==Later career and influence==
Hertz wrote over 50 scientific publications dealing mainly with topics in thyroid physiology, its disease and treatment. He influenced the development of nuclear medicine through his research and instruction at both  Harvard  and MIT. He was an instructor in medicine at  Harvard Medical School and  Harvard University   from 1946 - 1950. His teaching included an attachment to the Nuclear Physics Department at  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  from 1939 - 1950.<ref name="Medical Way">{{cite journal |last1= Kagan |first1= Solomon |year= 1950 |title= Saul Hertz, M.D. |journal= The Medical Way |volume= 12 |issue= 12 |pages= 1, 6–7 }}</ref>

The development of [[radioactive iodine]] in the treatment of [[thyroid disease]] is the cornerstone on which [[nuclear medicine]] was built.<ref name="Vignette"/>[[Barbara Bush]], who was successfully treated, wrote to Vitta Hertz, his widow, “It is comforting to know that so many people are well because of the scientific expertise of people like Dr. Hertz.” <ref>News and Public Affairs Office of MGH. 50th Anniversary of “atomic cocktail” to treat overactive thyroid gland. '' MGH Hotline'' 1991, Jan 31;1-3.</ref>
