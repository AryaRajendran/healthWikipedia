The age of onset is usually about 15-40, but DH can also affect children and the elderly.  Men and women are equally affected.  Estimates of DH prevalence vary from 1 in 400 to 1 in 10000. It is most common in patients of northern European ancestry, and is associated with the [[HLA-DQ2]] haplotype along with [[celiac disease]] and [[gluten sensitivity]].

Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by intensely [[itch]]y, chronic [[Vesicle (dermatology)|papulovesicular]] eruptions, usually distributed symmetrically on extensor surfaces (buttocks, back of neck, scalp, elbows, knees, back, hairline, groin, or face).<ref name="Fitz2"/>{{rp|616}}<ref name="pmid18319038" /><ref name="DOJ">{{cite journal

Dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms typically first appear in the early years of [[adulthood]] between 20 and 30 years of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gluten-intolerance-symptoms.com/dermatitis-herpetiformis/| title=Dermatitis Herpetiformis|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}</ref>

Although the first signs and symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis are intense itching and burning, the first visible signs are the small papules or [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]] that usually look like red bumps or [[blisters]]. Sometimes they appear on the [[face]] and along the [[hairline]], and, on occasion, on the [[shoulder]]s, the lower end of the [[spinal column]], and within the [[mouth]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. The rash rarely occurs on other mucous membranes, excepting the mouth or lips. The symptoms range in severity from mild to serious, but they are likely to disappear if gluten ingestion is avoided and appropriate treatment is administered.

Dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms are [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], and they tend to come and go, mostly in short periods of time. Sometimes, these symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of [[coeliac disease]], commonly including [[abdominal pain]], bloating or loose stool, and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].

The rash caused by dermatitis herpetiformis forms and disappears in three stages. In the first stage, the patient may notice a slight discoloration of the [[Human skin|skin]] at the site where the lesions appear. In the next stage, the skin lesions transform into obvious vesicles and papules that are likely to occur in groups. Healing of the lesions is the last stage of the development of the symptoms, usually characterized by a change in the skin color. This can result in areas of the skin turning darker or lighter than the color of the skin on the rest of the [[body]]. Because of the intense itching, patients usually scratch, which can lead to the formation of crusts.

== Diagnosis ==
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
Dermatitis herpetiformis is often misdiagnosed, being confused with drug eruptions, [[contact dermatitis]], dishydrotic eczema ([[dyshidrosis]]), and even [[scabies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What’s The Diagnosis #9|url=http://www.epmonthly.com/whitecoat/2010/04/whats-the-diagnosis-9/|work=Emergency Physicians Monthly|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> 

Diagnosis is confirmed by a simple [[blood test]] for [[IgA]] [[antibodies]],<ref name="DermNetNZ" /> and by a [[Biopsy#Skin_biopsy|skin biopsy]] in which the pattern of IgA deposits in the [[dermal papillae]], revealed by direct [[immunofluorescence]], distinguishes it from [[Adult linear IgA disease|linear IgA bullous dermatosis]]<ref name="pmid18319038">{{cite journal

If the patient has already started a gluten-free diet (there is a strong relationship with DH and [[coeliac sprue]]), it might be necessary for them to restart gluten for some weeks before the tests can be done reliably. In 2010, ''Cutis'' reported an eruption labelled ''gluten-sensitive dermatitis'' which is clinically indistinguishable from dermatitis herepetiformis but lacks the IgA connection,<ref name="cutis">{{cite journal

== Treatment ==
Dermatitis herpetiformis responds well to [[medication]] and changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]].

[[Dapsone]] is an effective treatment for most patients.  DH responds to dapsone so quickly (itching is significantly reduced within 2–3 days<ref name="HealthCentralNetwork" /><ref>{{cite journal
    |url       = http://dermatology.cdlib.org/DOJvol8num1/reviews/dapsone/wolf.html
    |title     = ''"Dapsone"''
    |publisher = Dermatology Online Journal
}}</ref>) that this response may almost be considered diagnostic.  However, dapsone treatment has no effect on any intestinal damage (see [[coeliac disease]]) that might be present.<ref name="NDDIC" />

Therefore, a strict [[gluten-free diet]] must also be followed,<ref name="DermNetNZ" /> and this will usually be a lifelong requirement.  This will reduce any associated intestinal damage<ref name="HealthCentralNetwork" /><ref name="DermNetNZ" /> and the risk of other complications.  After some time on a gluten-free diet, the dosage of dapsone can usually be reduced or even stopped,<ref name="HealthCentralNetwork">{{cite web
    |url=http://www.healthscout.com/ency/1/646/main.html
    |title=Dermatitis Herpetiformis
    |publisher=The HealthScout Network
    }}</ref> although this can take many years.

Dapsone is an [[antibacterial]], and its role in the treatment of DH, which is not caused by [[bacteria]], is poorly understood.  It can cause adverse effects on the blood, so regular blood monitoring is required.<ref name="AOCD">{{cite web
        |title=Dermatitis Herpetiformis
        |publisher=American Osteopathic College of Dermatology
        |url=http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/dermatitis_herpeti.html
        }}</ref> 

Dapsone is the drug of choice, but, for patients unable to tolerate dapsone for any reason, the following can be tried, although they are less effective:
* [[colchicine]]
* [[lymecycline]]
* [[nicotinamide]]
* [[tetracycline]]<ref name="AOCD" />
* [[sulfamethoxypyridazine]]
* [[sulfapyridine]]<ref name="AOCD" /><ref name="DermNetNZ" />

==Pathology==
In terms of pathology, the first signs of the condition may be observed within the [[dermis]]. The changes that can take place at this level may include [[edema]], vascular dilatation, and cellular infiltration. It is common for [[lymphocytes]] and [[eosinophils]] to be seen. The bullae found in the skin affected by dermatitis herpetiformis are subepidermal and have rounded lateral borders.

When looked at under the [[microscope]], the skin affected by dermatitis herpetiformis presents a collection of cells known as [[neutrophils]]. They have an increased prevalence in the areas where the dermis is closest to the epidermis.

Direct IMF studies of uninvolved skin show IgA in the dermal papillae and patchy granular IgA along the basement membrane. The jejunal mucosa may show partial villous [[atrophy]], but the changes tend to be milder than in coeliac disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hairstylescut.com/skin/perioral-dermatitis.htm | title=
Perioral Dermatitis|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}</ref>

Immunological studies revealed findings that are similar to those of coeliac disease in terms of [[autoantigens]]. The main autoantigen of dermatitis herpetiformis is epidermal transglutaminase (eTG), a cytosolic enzyme involved in cell envelope formation during keratinocyte differentiation.<ref name="Dermatitis Herpetiformis"/>

Various research studies have pointed out different potential factors that may play a larger or smaller role in the development of dermatitis herpetiformis. The fact that eTG has been found in precipitates of skin-bound IgA from skin affected by this condition has been used to conclude that dermatitis herpetiformis may be caused by a deposition of both IgA and eTG within the dermis. It is estimated that these deposits may resorb after 10 years of following a gluten-free diet. Moreover, it is suggested that this condition is closely linked to [[genetics]]. This theory is based on the arguments that individuals with a family history of gluten sensitivity who still consume foods containing gluten are more likely to develop the condition as a result of the formation of [[antibodies]] to gluten. These antibodies cross-react with eTG, and IgA/eTG complexes deposit within the papillary dermis to cause the lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis. These IgA deposits can disappear after long-term (up to 10 years) avoidance of dietary gluten.<ref name="Dermatitis Herpetiformis"/>

== Complications ==
DH is an [[autoimmune disease]], and patients with DH are more likely than others to have [[Thyroid disease|thyroid problems]]<ref name="pmid18319038" /><ref name="DermNetNZ">{{cite web
    |title=Dermatitis herpetiformis
    |publisher=DermNet NZ
    |url=http://dermnetnz.org/immune/dermatitis-herpetiformis.html
    }}</ref> and [[intestinal]] [[lymphoma]].<ref name="pmid18319038" /><ref name="Patient UK" /><ref name="DOJ" /> 

Dermatitis herpetiformis does not usually cause complications on its own, without being associated with another condition. Complications from this condition, however, arise from the autoimmune character of the disease, as an overreacting immune system is a sign that something does not work well and might cause problems to other parts of the body that do not necessarily involve the [[digestive system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herpetiformisdermatitis.com/effects-complications.html| title=Herpetiformis Dermatitis Effects And Complications|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}</ref>

Gluten intolerance and the body's reaction to it make the disease more worrying in what concerns the possible [[Complication (medicine)|complications]]. This means that complications that may arise from dermatitis herpetiformis are the same as those resulting from coeliac disease, which include [[osteoporosis]], certain kinds of gut cancer, and an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases such as [[thyroid disease]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coeliac.org.uk/coeliac-disease/what-is-coeliac-disease/dermatitis-herpetiformis-dh| title=Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}</ref>

The risks of developing complications from dermatitis herpetiformis decrease significantly if the patients follow a gluten-free diet. The disease has been associated with auto-immune thyroid disease, [[Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus|insulin-dependent diabetes]], [[lupus erythematosus]], [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[sarcoidosis]], and [[vitiligo]] or alopecia areata.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=9115907| title=Diseases associated with dermatitis herpetiformis|date=|last1=Reunala|first1=T|last2=Collin|first2=P|volume=136|issue=3|pages=315–8|journal=The British journal of dermatology}}</ref>
