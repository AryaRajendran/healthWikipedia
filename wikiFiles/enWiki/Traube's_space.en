'''Traube's''' (semilunar) '''space''' is an anatomic region of some clinical importance. It is a crescent-shaped space, encompassed by the lower edge of the [[left lung]], the anterior border of the [[spleen]], the left costal margin and the inferior margin of the [[left lobe]] of the [[liver]]. Thus, its surface markings are respectively the left sixth [[rib]] superiorly, the left anterior axillary line laterally, and the left costal margin inferiorly.

==Percussion for splenomegaly==
The normal human spleen measures about 125 millimeters in length, and [[splenomegaly]] is an important clinical sign. There are 2 possibilities to evaluate splenomegaly in the clinical examination: percussion and palpation.<ref name="pmid11229121">{{cite journal |author=Dubey S, Swaroop A, Jain R, Verma K, Garg P, Agarwal S |title=Percussion of Traube's space--a useful index of splenic enlargement |journal=The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=326–8 |year=2000 |pmid=11229121 |doi=}}</ref> Percussion can be done in this space.

Beneath Traube's space lies the [[stomach]], which produces a tympanic sound on [[percussion (medicine)|percussion]]. Dullness to percussion over Traube's space may indicate splenomegaly, although this can also be a normal finding after a meal. Assessing dullness to percussion may be more difficult in obese patients.

A 1993 [[systematic review]] by ''The Rational Clinical Examination'' found that, as a test for splenomegaly, percussion over Traube's space yields a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 62% and 72%, respectively.<ref name="pmid8411607">{{cite journal |author=Grover SA, Barkun AN, Sackett DL |title=The rational clinical examination. Does this patient have splenomegaly? |journal=JAMA |volume=270 |issue=18 |pages=2218–21 |year=1993 |pmid=8411607 |doi=10.1001/jama.270.18.2218}}</ref> Specificity may be higher if the patient has not eaten in the last two hours.<ref name="pmid8411607"/>

==Eponym==
It is named for [[Ludwig Traube (physician)|Ludwig Traube]], although it was first described by his pupil in 1868.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3182}}</ref> Another method was described by Donald O. Castell in 1967 ([[Castell's sign]]).
