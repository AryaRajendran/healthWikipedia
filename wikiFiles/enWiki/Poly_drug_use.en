'''Poly drug use'''  refers to the use of two or more [[psychoactive drug]]s in combination to achieve a particular effect. In many cases one drug is used as a base or primary drug, with additional drugs to leaven or compensate for the side effects of the primary drug and make the experience more enjoyable with [[drug synergy]] effects, or to supplement for primary drug when supply is low.<ref>http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index34913EN.html</ref> 

==Risks==
Poly drug use often carries with it more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. The potentiating effect of one drug on another is sometimes considerable and here the licit drugs and medicines – such as alcohol, nicotine and [[antidepressants]] – have to be considered in conjunction with the controlled psychoactive substances. The risk level will depend on the dosage level of both substances. Concerns exist about a number of pharmacological pairings: [[alcohol]] and [[cocaine]] increase cardiovascular toxicity; alcohol or depressant drugs, when taken with opioids, lead to an increased risk of overdose; and opioids or cocaine taken with [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] or [[amphetamines]] also result in additional acute toxicity.<ref name="EEM"/> [[Benzodiazepines]] are notorious for causing death when mixed with other [[CNS depressant]]s such as [[opioids]], alcohol, or [[barbiturate]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Serfaty M, Masterton G |title=Fatal poisonings attributed to benzodiazepines in Britain during the 1980s |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue= |pages=386–93 |year=1993 |pmid=8104653 |doi=10.1192/bjp.163.3.386}}</ref><ref name="pmid12474705">{{cite journal |author=Buckley NA, Dawson AH, Whyte IM, O'Connell DL. |title=[Relative toxicity of benzodiazepines in overdose.] |journal=BMJ |volume=310 |issue= 6974|pages=219–21 |year=1995 |pmid=7866122 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.310.6974.219|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/310/6974/219 |pmc=2548618}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Drummer OH |coauthors=Ranson DL |year=1996 |month=December |title=Sudden death and benzodiazepines |journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=336–42 |pmid=8947361 |doi=10.1097/00000433-199612000-00012}}</ref>

==Scheduling==
Within the general concept of multiple drug use, several specific meanings of the term must be considered. At one extreme is planned use.  On the other hand, the use of several substances in an intensive and chaotic way, simultaneously or consecutively, in many cases each drug substituting for another according to availability.<ref name="EEM">[http://ar2006.emcdda.europa.eu/en/page012-en.html?CFID=7908701&CFTOKEN=472a97577904fd31-16A12971-F8FA-A4BE-70FBED3F5065929B&jsessionid=2e30fd1d0c7948157239 EMCDDA Annual Report 2006 ch. 8]</ref>

==Research==
The phenomenon is the subject of established academic literature.<ref name="pmid15135556">{{cite journal |author=Scholey AB, Parrott AC, Buchanan T, Heffernan TM, Ling J, Rodgers J |title=Increased intensity of Ecstasy and polydrug usage in the more experienced recreational Ecstasy/MDMA users: a WWW study |journal=Addict Behav |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=743–52 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15135556 |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2004.02.022 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306460304000097}}</ref>

A study among treatment admissions found that it is more common for younger people to report polydrug drug use, than for older people admitted.<ref> "Polydrug Use Among Treatment Admissions: 1998."
