The '''triceps reflex''', a [[Reflex#Tendon reflexes|deep tendon reflex]], is a reflex as it [[Wiktionary:Elicit|elicits]] [[involuntary]] contraction of the [[triceps brachii muscle]].  It is initiated by the Cervical (of the neck region) [[spinal nerve]] [[Cervical spinal nerve 7|7]] nerve root (the small segment of the nerve that emerges from the spinal cord).<ref name="gp">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=751829070|title=Triceps (anatomy)|accessdate=September 18, 2007|publisher=General Practice Notebook - UK|author=General Practice Notebook - UK}}</ref> The reflex is tested as part of the [[neurological examination]] to assess the [[Sensory neuron|sensory]] and [[Motor neuron|motor]] pathways within the C7 and C8 [[spinal nerves]].{{fact|date=June 2012}} The deep tendon reflex of the triceps is evaluating spinal levels C6, C7, and C8.{{fact|date=June 2012}}

==Testing==
The test is performed by tapping the triceps [[tendon]]<ref name="Orient2009">{{cite book|author=Jane M.

== Reflex arc ==
The arc involves the [[Golgi tendon organ|stretch receptors]] in the triceps tendon, from where the information travels through the C7 nerve root to the spinal cord, and the motor signal for contraction returns through the [[radial nerve]].<ref group=note>A reflex arc is the path in the nervous system through which the sensory information (stimulation&mdash;sudden stretching of the triceps tendon in this case) travels to the spinal cord in form of an [[action potential]] through a [[sensory neuron]], and comes in contact with a [[motor neuron]] at a [[Chemical synapse|synapse]], which also carries an action potential back to the muscle of origin and results in its (triceps's) contraction. Note that the contact between the sensory and motor neurons does not require immediate involvement of the brain making it involuntary, though the sensation of stretch (as the hammer hits the skin and tendon beneath) and contraction of the muscle are both sent to the brain making the subject aware of the entire testing procedure.</ref>

==Test indicators==
* Absence of a reflex (areflexia): If no reflex is elicited then it is essential to try again with ''reinforcement'', with the patient clenching his or her teeth just as the reflex hammer strikes.
* Hyper-reflexia (a response far larger than considered normal): Indicates a potential [[upper motor neurone]] lesion.

==Absence of reflex==
An absence of reflex can be an indicator of several medical conditions: [[Myopathy]], [[neuropathy]], [[spondylosis]], sensory nerve disease, [[neuritis]], potential [[lower motor neuron]] [[lesion]], or [[poliomyelitis]].<ref name="gp3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=-1529872361&linkID=33992&cook=no|title=Absent reflexes|accessdate=September 18, 2007|publisher=General Practice Notebook - UK|author=General Practice Notebook - UK}}</ref>

Other medical problems that may cause irregular reflexes include [[Hyperthyroidism]].
