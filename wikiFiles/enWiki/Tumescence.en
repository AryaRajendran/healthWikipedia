'''Tumescence''' is the quality or state of being tumescent or swollen. Tumescence usually refers to the normal engorgement with [[blood]] ([[vascular congestion]]) of the [[erectile tissue]]s, marking sexual excitation and possible readiness for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. The tumescent sexual organ in men is the [[penis]] and in women is the [[clitoris]]. '''Detumescence''' is the reversal of this process, by which blood leaves the erectile tissue, returning to the flaccid state.<ref>Bella Anthony J, Lue Tom F, "Chapter 38.

Regularly, men who experience [[erectile dysfunction]] are given a [[nocturnal penile tumescence]] (NPT) test, usually over a three-day period. Such a test detects the presence of an erection occurring during sleep using either (1) a small portable computer connected to two bands placed around the shaft of the penis which records penile tumescence, or (2) a band of paper tape with perforations (like [[postage stamp]]s) that is fit snugly around the shaft of the penis and will break at the perforations during penile tumescence.

The goal of nocturnal penile tumescence testing is to determine whether a man can experience an [[erection]] while sleeping after reporting he is unable to experience an erection while awake. If a man does obtain an erection while sleeping, but cannot obtain one while awake, a psychological cause or a medication side effect is usually suspected. Otherwise, if a man does not obtain an erection in either state, a [[physiology|physiological]] cause is usually suspected.
