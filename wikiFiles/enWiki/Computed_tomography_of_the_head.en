[[Computed tomography]] (CT) of the head or ''Computed Axial Tomography'' (CAT) scanning uses a series of [[x-rays]] of the head taken from many different directions.  Typically used for quickly viewing [[Acquired brain injury|brain injuries]], CT scanning uses a computer program that performs a numerical integral calculation (the inverse [[Radon transform]]) on the measured x-ray series to estimate how much of an x-ray beam is absorbed in a small volume of the brain. Typically the information is presented as a series of cross sections of the brain.<ref>Malcom Jeeves (1994). ''Mind Fields: Reflections on the Science of Mind and Brain''. Grand Rapids, MI:  Baker Books., p. 21</ref>  

In approximation, the denser a material is, the whiter a volume of it will appear on the scan, just as in the more familiar "flat" X-rays, where dense bone appears white.  CT scans are primarily used for evaluating swelling from tissue damage in the brain and in assessment of ventricle size.  Modern CT scanning can provide reasonably good images in a matter of minutes.  A [[spiral CT scan]] of the head may be performed in 10-30 seconds, making it a good option for children and adults with difficulty holding still for longer periods.<ref name=WillsEye4th />  The use of contrast dye in [[CT angiography]] provides good visualization of the vascular structures and leaks in the blood vessels.<ref name=WillsEye4th />

==Uses==
Computed tomography (CT) has become the diagnostic modality of choice for head trauma due to its accuracy, reliability, safety, and wide availability. The changes in microcirculation, impaired auto-regulation, cerebral edema, and axonal injury start as soon as head injury occurs and manifest as clinical, biochemical, and radiological changes. Proper therapeutic management of brain injury is based on correct diagnosis and appreciation of the temporal course of the disease process. CT scan detects and precisely localizes the intracranial hematomas, brain contusions, edema and foreign bodies. Because of the widespread availability of CT, there is reduction in arteriography, surgical intervention and skull radiography.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Prashant|coauthors=Krishna Atul, Dwivedi Amit, Gupta Kumkum, Bala Madhu, Garg Gouri, Agarwal Shivani|title=CT Scan Findings and Outcomes of Head Injury Patients: A Cross Sectional Study|journal=Journal of Pakistan Medical Students|year=2011|month=October-December|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.jpmsonline.com/jpms-vol1-issue3-pages78-82-oa.html|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> 

==Orbital views for eye-related disorders==
Special views focusing on the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] may be taken to investigate concerns relating to the eye.<ref name=WillsEye4th>{{cite book|last=Kunimoto|first=Derek |coauthors=Kunal Kanitkar, and Mary Makar|title=The Wills eye manual: office and emergency room diagnosis and treatment of eye disease.|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0781742078|pages=360-361|edition=4th}}</ref>  CT scans are used by [[physicians]] specializing in treating the eye ([[ophthalmologists]]) to detect [[foreign bodies]] (especially metallic objects), [[fracture]]s, [[abscesses]], [[cellulitis]], [[sinusitis]], bleeding within the skull ([[intracranial bleeding]]), [[proptosis]], [[Graves disease]] changes in the eye, and evaluation of the orbital apex and [[cavernous sinus]].<ref name=WillsEye4th />

==Comparison with MRI==
[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)]] provides more sensitivity in the evaluation of the cavernous sinus and the orbital apex.<ref name=WillsEye4th />

One advantage over a [[brain MRI]] is in the evaluation of intracerebral calcifications.<ref name="EbelBenz-Bohm1999">{{cite book|last1=Ebel|first1=Klaus-Dietrich|last2=Benz-Bohm|first2=Gabriele|title=Differential diagnosis in pediatric radiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SGMrGn49QZUC&pg=PA538|accessdate=18 July 2011|year=1999|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-3-13-108131-5|pages=538â€“}}</ref>

==Cautions==
Several different views of the head are available, including [[axial plane|axial]], [[coronal plane|coronal]], reformatted coronal, and reformatted [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] images.  However, coronal images require the patient [[Extension (kinesiology)#Hyperextension|hyperextend]] their neck, which must be avoided if any possibility of neck injury exists.<ref name=WillsEye4th />
