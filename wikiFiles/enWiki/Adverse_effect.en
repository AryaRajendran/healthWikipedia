In [[medicine]], an '''adverse effect''' is a harmful and undesired effect resulting from a [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]] or other intervention such as [[surgery]].

An adverse effect may be termed a "[[side effect]]", when judged to be secondary to a main or [[therapeutic effect]]. If it results from an unsuitable or incorrect [[dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] or procedure, this is called a [[medical error]] and not a [[Complication (medicine)|complication]]. Adverse effects are sometimes referred to as "[[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]]" because they are generated by a [[physician]]/treatment. Some adverse effects only occur only when starting, increasing or discontinuing a treatment. 

Using a drug or other medical intervention which is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] may increase the [[risk]] of adverse effects. Adverse effects may cause complications of a [[disease]] or procedure and negatively affect its [[prognosis]]. They may also lead to [[compliance (medicine)|non-compliance]] with a treatment regimen.

The harmful outcome is usually indicated by some result such as [[Disease|morbidity]], [[death|mortality]], alteration in [[body weight]], levels of [[enzyme]]s, loss of function, or as a [[pathology|pathological]] change detected at the microscopic, macroscopic or physiological level. It may also be indicated by [[symptom]]s reported by a patient. Adverse effects may cause a reversible or irreversible change, including an increase or decrease in the susceptibility of the individual to other chemicals, [[food]]s, or procedures, such as [[drug interaction]]s.

In [[clinical trial]]s, a distinction is made between [[adverse event]]s (AEs) and [[serious adverse event]]s (SAEs). Generally, any event which causes death, permanent damage, [[Congenital disorder|birth defect]]s, or requires [[hospital]]ization is considered an SAE.<ref>[http://www2.kumc.edu/researchinstitute/cra/crasaedefinition.htm University of Kansas Medical Center Research Institute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The results of these trials are often included in the labeling of the medication to provide information both for patients and the prescribing physicians.

==Reporting systems==
In many countries, adverse effects are required by law to be reported, researched in [[clinical trial]]s and included into the patient information accompanying [[medical device]]s and [[drug]]s for sale to the public.

===United Kingdom===
The [[Yellow Card Scheme]] is a [[United Kingdom]] initiative run by the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]] and the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines|Commission on Human Medicines (CHM)]] to gather information on adverse effects to [[Pharmaceutical drug|medicines]]. This includes all licensed medicines, from medicines issued on [[prescription drug|prescription]] to medicines bought [[over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] from a supermarket. The scheme also includes all [[herbalism|herbal supplement]]s and unlicensed medicines found in cosmetic treatments. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can be reported by a number of health care professionals including [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s and [[nurse]]s, as well as [[patient]]s.

===United States===
In the [[United States]] several reporting systems have been built, such as the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS), the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) and the Special Nutritionals Adverse Event Monitoring System. [[MedWatch]] is the main reporting center, operated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]].

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], adverse effect reporting is administered by the [[Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee]] (ADRAC), a subcommittee of the [[Australian Drug Evaluation Committee]] (ADEC). Reporting is voluntary, and ADRAC requests healthcare professionals to report all adverse reactions to its current drugs of interest, and serious adverse reactions to any drug. ADRAC publishes the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Bulletin every two months.The Government's [[Quality Use of Medicines]] program is tasked with acting on this reporting to reduce and minimize the number of preventable adverse effects each year.

===New Zealand===
Adverse reaction reporting is an important component of New Zealand's [[pharmacovigilance]] activities. The [http://carm.otago.ac.nz/CARM.asp Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM)] in Dunedin is New Zealand's national monitoring centre for adverse reactions. It collects and evaluates spontaneous reports of adverse reactions to medicines, vaccines, herbal products and dietary supplements from health professionals in New Zealand. Currently the CARM database holds over 80,000 reports and provides New Zealand-specific information on adverse reactions to these products, and serves to support clinical decision making when unusual symptoms are thought to be therapy related

===Canada===
In Canada, adverse reaction reporting is an important component of the surveillance of marketed health products conducted by the Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB) of Health Canada. Within HPFB, the Marketed Health Products Directorate leads the coordination and implementation of consistent monitoring practices with regards to assessment of signals and safety trends, and risk communications concerning regulated marketed health products.

MHPD also works closely with international organizations to facilitate the sharing of information.  Adverse reaction reporting is mandatory for the industry and voluntary for consumers and health professionals.

==Adverse effects of medical procedures==
[[Surgery]] may have a number of undesirable or harmful effects, such as [[infection]], [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]], [[inflammation]], [[scar]]ring, loss of function, or changes in local [[blood flow]]. They can be reversible or irreversible, and a compromise must be found by the physician and the patient between the beneficial or life-saving consequences of surgery versus its adverse effects. For example, a limb may be lost to [[amputation]] in case of untreatable [[gangrene]], but the patient's life is saved. Presently, one of the greatest advantages of [[minimally invasive procedure|minimally invasive]] surgery, such as [[laparoscopic surgery]], is the reduction of adverse effects.

Other nonsurgical physical procedures, such as high-intensity [[radiation therapy]], may cause [[burn]]s and alterations in the [[skin]]. In general, these therapies try to avoid damage to healthy [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] while maximizing the therapeutic effect.

[[Vaccination]] may have adverse effects due to the nature of its biological preparation, sometimes using [[attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] [[pathogen]]s and [[toxin]]s. Common adverse effects may be [[fever]], [[malaise]] and local reactions in the vaccination site. Very rarely, there is a serious adverse effect, such as [[eczema vaccinatum]], a severe, sometimes fatal complication which may result in persons who have [[eczema]] or atopic [[dermatitis]].

[[Medical diagnosis|Diagnostic]] procedures may also have adverse effects, depending much on whether they are [[invasive (medical)|invasive]], [[minimally invasive procedure|minimally invasive]] or [[non-invasive (medical)|noninvasive]]. For example, [[allergy|allergic]] reactions to [[radiocontrast]] materials often occur, and a [[colonoscopy]] may cause the perforation of the [[intestine|intestinal]] wall.

==Adverse effects of drugs==
{{Main|Adverse drug reaction}}
In today’s pharmaceutical world, the expansion of drug use has created many negative side effects. The abuse of narcotic drugs can cause devastating outcomes, like overwhelming addiction and internal damage to the body. High volumes of drugs are prescribed annually to patients worldwide. This has taken a toll on the environment, from a result of human waste mixed with drugs going into water systems. It has begun to cause harmful impacts on animals and humans as well. One of the side effects is increased resistance to antibiotics and super viruses that cannot be treated by conventional means. Antidepressants have also shown to have many negative side effects, with very little positive outcomes to mental health. Pharmaceutical drugs have many adverse side effects and often create more problems than they solve.

Adverse effects can occur as a collateral or side effect of many interventions, but they are particularly important in [[pharmacology]], due to its wider, and sometimes uncontrollable, use by way of [[self-medication]]. Thus, [[responsible drug use]] becomes an important issue here. Adverse effects, like [[therapeutic effect]]s of drugs, are a function of [[dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] or drug levels at the target [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], so they may be avoided or decreased by means of careful and precise [[pharmacokinetics]], the change of drug levels in the organism in function of time after administration.

Adverse effects may also be caused by [[drug interaction]]. This often occurs when patients fail to inform their physician and pharmacist of all the medications they are taking, including herbal and dietary supplements. The new medication may interact agonistically or antagonistically (potentiate or decrease the intended therapeutic effect), causing significant [[Disease|morbidity]] and mortality around the world. Drug-drug and food-drug interactions may occur, and so-called "natural drugs" used in [[alternative medicine]] can have dangerous adverse effects. For example, extracts of [[St John's wort]] (''Hypericum perforatum''), a [[phytotherapy|phytotherapic]] used for treating mild [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] are known to cause an increase in the [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]]s responsible for the [[metabolism]] and elimination of many drugs, so patients taking it are likely to experience a reduction in [[blood]] levels of drugs they are taking for other purposes, such as [[cancer]] [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic]] drugs, [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s for [[HIV]] and [[hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptive]]s.

The scientific field of activity associated with drug safety is increasingly government-regulated, and is of major concern for the public, as well as to [[Pharmaceutical industry|drug manufacturer]]s. The distinction between adverse and nonadverse effects is a major undertaking when a new drug is developed and tested before [[Pharmaceutical marketing|marketing]] it. This is done in [[toxicity]] studies to determine the nonadverse effect level (NOAEL). These studies are used to define the dosage to be used in human testing (phase I), as well as to calculate the maximum admissible daily intake. Imperfections in clinical trials, such as insufficient number of patients or short duration, sometimes lead to [[public health]] disasters, such as those of [[fenfluramine]] (the so-called [[fen-phen]] episode), [[thalidomide]] and, more recently, of [[cerivastatin]] (Baycol, Lipobay) and [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx), where drastic adverse effects were observed, such as [[teratology|teratogenesis]], [[pulmonary hypertension]], [[stroke]], [[heart disease]], [[neuropathy]], and a significant number of deaths, causing the forced or voluntary [[List of withdrawn drugs|withdrawal]] of the drug from the market.

Most drugs have a large list of nonsevere or mild adverse effects which do not rule out continued usage. These effects, which have a widely variable incidence according to individual sensitivity, include [[nausea]], [[dizziness]], [[diarrhea]], [[malaise]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], [[dermatitis]], dry mouth, etc. These can be considered a form of pseudo-allergic reaction, as not all users experience these effects; many users experience none at all.

Drugs contain side effects which is the reason why commercials or advertisements put many disclaimers about the unwanted symptoms after taking the drug(s).

==Controversies==
Sometimes, putative medical adverse effects are regarded as controversial and generate heated discussions in society and [[lawsuit]]s against drug manufacturers. One example is the recent controversy as to whether [[controversies in autism|autism]] was linked to the [[MMR vaccine]] (or by [[thiomersal]], a [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-based preservative used in some [[vaccine]]s). No link has been found in several large studies, and despite removal of thimerosal from vaccines a decade ago the rate of autism has not decreased as would be expected if it had been the causative agent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thimerosal in Vaccines|url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CDC sees autism rate rise 25%|author=Jaslow, R.|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57406450/cdc-sees-autism-rate-rise-25-/|newspaper=CBS News|date=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

Another instance is the potential adverse effects of [[silicone]] [[breast implant]]s, which led to hundreds of thousands of litigations against manufacturers of gel-based implants, due to allegations of damage to the [[immune system]] which have not yet been conclusively proven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silicone Breast Implants in Relation to Connective Tissue Diseases and Immunologic Dysfunction|url=http://www.fjc.gov/BREIMLIT/SCIENCE/summary.htm}}</ref>

Due to the exceedingly high impact on public health of widely used medications, such as [[hormonal contraception]] and [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]], which may affect millions of users, even marginal probabilities of adverse effects of a severe nature, such as [[breast cancer]], have led to public outcry and changes in medical therapy, although its benefits largely surpassed the statistical risks.

==Limitations of adverse effects reporting==
In principle, medical professionals are required to report all adverse effects related to a specific form of therapy. In practice, it is at the discretion of the professional to determine whether a medical event is at all related to the therapy. For example, a leg [[fracture]] in a skiing accident in a patient who years before took antibiotics for [[pneumonia]] is not likely to get reported. {{Or|date=February 2011}}

As a result, routine adverse effects reporting often may not include long-term and subtle effects that may ultimately be attributed to a therapy. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Part of the difficulty is identifying the source of a complaint. A headache in a patient taking medication for [[influenza]] may be caused by the underlying disease or may be an adverse effect of the treatment. In patients with end-stage [[cancer]], death is a very likely outcome and whether the drug is the cause or a bystander is often difficult to discern. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
