It should not be confused with [[iodine deficiency]], or with other forms of [[congenital hypothyroidism]] where the thyroid is present but not functioning correctly.

Congenital hypothyroidism caused by thyroid dysgenesis can be associated with [[PAX8]].<ref name="pmid9590296">{{cite journal |author=Macchia PE, Lapi P, Krude H, ''et al'' |title=PAX8 mutations associated with congenital hypothyroidism caused by thyroid dysgenesis |journal=Nat.

==Ectopic thyroid==
An ''ectopic thyroid'' is a form of thyroid dysgenesis in which an entire or parts of the thyroid located in another part of the body than what is the usual case. A completely ectopic thyroid gland may be located anywhere along the path of the descent of the thyroid during [[Thyroid#Embryological_development|its embryological development]], although it is most commonly located at the base of the tongue, just posterior to the [[Foramen cecum (tongue)|foramen cecum of the tongue]]. In this location, an aberrant or ectopic thyroid gland is known as a ''lingual thyroid''.<ref name=Kay2010/>  If the thyroid fails to descend to even higher degree, then the resulting final resting point of the thyroid gland may be high in the neck, such as just below the [[hyoid bone]].<ref name=Kay2010>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/845125-overview#aw2aab6b5  emedicine > Embryology of the Thyroid and Parathyroids > Thyroid Embryology Clinical Correlations] By David J Kay and Arlen D Meyers. Updated: Jan 14, 2010</ref> Parts of ectopic thyroid tissue ("accessory thyroid tissue") can also occur, and arises from remnants of the [[thyroglossal duct]], and may appear anywhere along its original length.<ref name=Kay2010/> Accessory thyroid tissue may be functional, but is generally insufficient for normal function if the main thyroid gland is entirely removed.<ref name=Kay2010/>

Lingual thyroid is 4-7 times more common in females, with symptoms developing during puberty, pregnancy or menopause. Lingual thyroid may be asymptomatic, or give symptoms such as [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing), [[dysphonia]] (difficulty talking) and [[dyspnea]] (difficulty breathing).<ref name="OMF pathology textbook">{{cite book|last=Bouquot|first=Brad W.
