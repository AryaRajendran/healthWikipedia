'''Laryngitis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the [[larynx]]. It causes hoarse [[human voice|voice]] or temporary complete loss of the voice because of irritation to the [[vocal folds]] (vocal cords). [[Dysphonia]] is the medical term for a vocal disorder, of which laryngitis is one cause.

Laryngitis is categorized as [[acute (medicine)|acute]] if it lasts less than three weeks. Otherwise it is categorized as [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]], and may last over three weeks. The chronic form occurs mostly in middle age and is much more common in men than women. It is mainly caused by excessive smoking.

==Causes==
Laryngitis can be infectious as well as noninfectious in origin.

===Noninfectious causes===
* [[Acid reflux disease]], resulting in '''laryngitis gastrica'''
* Allergies
* Excessive coughing{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}, smoking, or alcohol consumption
* Inflammation due to [[vocal loading|overuse]] of the vocal cords<ref>{{cite journal |author=Titze IR, Lemke J, Montequin D |title=Populations in the U.S. workforce who rely on voice as a primary tool of trade: a preliminary report |journal=J Voice |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=254–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9297668 |doi= 10.1016/S0892-1997(97)80002-1|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-1997(97)80002-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Popolo PS, Svec JG, Titze IR |title=Adaptation of a Pocket PC for use as a wearable voice dosimeter |journal=J.

* Prolonged use of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma treatment
* Thermal or chemical burns
* Laryngeal trauma, including [[iatrogenic]] one caused by [[endotracheal intubation]]

===Infectious causes===
* Viral infections can be caused by [[rhinovirus]], [[influenza virus]], [[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza virus]], [[adenovirus]], [[coxsackievirus]], [[coronavirus]],  and [[Respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]].
* Bacterial infections can be caused by [[group A streptococcus]], ''[[C. diphtheriae]]'', ''[[M. catarrhalis]]'', and''[[M. tuberculosis]]''. Bacterial infections usually follow pre-existing viral infection.
* Fungal infections can be caused by ''[[Histoplasma]]'', ''[[Blastomyces]]'', ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'' (especially in immunocompromised persons), and rarely by ''[[Cryptococcus]]'' and ''[[Coccidioides]]''.

==Symptoms==

*[[Dysphonia]] (hoarseness) or [[aphonia]] (inability to speak)
*Dry, sore, burning throat
*Coughing, which can be a symptom of, as well as a factor in, causing laryngitis
*[[Dysphagia]] (difficulty in swallowing)
*Sensation of swelling in the area of the [[larynx]]
*Cold or [[flu-like symptoms]] (which, like a cough, may also be the causal factor for laryngitis)
*Swollen [[lymph node]]s in the throat, chest, or face
*Fever
*[[Hemoptysis]] (coughing out blood)
*[[Dyspnea]] (difficulty in breathing), predominantly in children
*Increased production of saliva

==Signs==
In early stages, erythema (reddening) and [[edema]] of [[epiglottis]], [[aryepiglottic folds]], [[arytenoids]] and [[ventricular folds]] occurs. In late stages, the [[vocal folds]] and subglottic structures are also involved. There are sticky secretions between cords and in interarytenoid region. Sometimes, submucous hemorrhage is seen, especially in case of vocal abuse. '''Acute membranous laryngitis''', a condition resembling [[Tonsillitis|acute membranous tonsillitis]], is caused by pyogenic nonspecific organisms. It has to be differentiated from laryngeal diphtheria. In some cases tightening of the chest may be present due to COPD or other relevant breathing disorder. If you are having difficulty taking in a breath, you may need an inhaler. See your physician.

==Treatment==
* General measures: Voice rest is important.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Laryngitis/Pages/Treatment.aspx Laryngitis - Treatment NHS Choices]</ref> Steam inhalations with tincture [[benzoin]] or oil of [[pine]] or [[eucalyptus]] help loosen secretions. Cough sedatives are given to reduce cough. For a severely inflamed larynx, a [[humidifier]] or [[vaporizer]] is used to moisten the air inhaled by person.
* If laryngitis is due to [[gastroesophageal reflux]], an H2-inhibitor (such as [[ranitidine]]) or proton-pump inhibitor (such as [[omeprazole]]) is used to reduce [[gastric acid]] secretions.
* In laryngitis caused by thermal or chemical burns, steroids are used.
* In viral laryngitis, drinking sufficient fluids is helpful.
* If laryngitis is due to a bacterial or fungal infection, appropriate antibiotic or antifungal therapy is given.
* If persistent hoarseness or loss of voice (dysphonia) is a result of [[vocal fold nodules|vocal cord nodules]], physicians may recommend a course of treatment that may include a surgical procedure and/or [[speech therapy]].

==Prognosis==
Most cases of laryngitis are viral and resolve without treatment with sufficient voice rest. Laryngitis, hoarseness, or breathiness that lasts for more than two weeks may signal a voice disorder and should be followed up with a voice pathologist. This is typically a [[vocology]] certified [[Speech and language pathology|SLP]] (speech language pathologist) or a laryngologist (voice specialized [[Otorhinolaryngology#Laryngology|ENT]]).
