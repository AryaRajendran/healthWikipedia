An '''isochrone map''' ('''isochrone plan''', '''isochrone diagram''') in [[science]] and [[urban planning]] is a map showing areas related to [[wikt:isochrone|isochrone]]s between different points. An isochrone is defined as "a line drawn on a map connecting points at which something occurs or arrives at the same time".<ref>[http://dictionary.babylon.com/isochrone/ Isochrone] Babylon. Retrieved April 5, 2012.</ref> Such a map is sometimes termed simply an '''isochrone'''. In [[hydrology]] and [[transportation planning]] isochrone maps are commonly used to depict areas of equal travel time. The term is also used in [[cardiology]]<ref name="springerimages">{{cite web | url=http://www.springerimages.com/Images/Biomedicine/1-10.1007_s10439-006-9131-7-5 | title=MFS ECG Potential Map (40ms) | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] | accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref><ref name="rosenbaum 2001">{{cite book | title=Optical mapping of cardiac excitation and arrhythmias | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] | author=Rosenbaum, David S. | year=2001 | page=251 | isbn=0879934816 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RpegRobc7QgC&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=%22isochrone+map%22&source=bl&ots=WyyFPFPaP3&sig=yAYeO5RXwlA5KvFr0qGBQt3NsWo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8tFpT4WeK6LO0QW59ajmCA&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=%22isochrone%20map%22&f=false | author2=Jalife, José}}</ref><ref name="pnas 2006">{{cite journal | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/16/6309.long | title=Activation and repolarization of the normal human heart under complete physiological conditions | author=Ramanathan, Charulatha | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] | year=2006 | month=April | volume=103 | issue=16 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0601533103 | author2=Jia, Ping | author3=Ghanem, Raja | author4=Ryu, Kyungmoo | author5=Rudy, Yoram}}</ref> as a tool to visually detect abnormalities using body surface distribution.<ref name="nihonrinsho miyashita 1995">{{cite journal | title=Isochrone map, its implication and clinical usefulness | author=Miyashita, T | journal=Nihon Rinsho: Japanese Journal of Clinical Medicine | year=1995 | month=January | volume=53 | issue=1 | pages=48–55 | author2=Okano, Y | pmid=7897854}}</ref>

==Usage==
===Hydrology===
Isochrone and related maps are used to show the time taken for [[surface runoff|runoff]] water within a [[drainage basin]] to reach a lake, reservoir or outlet, assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall.<ref name="hydrolearthsystsci bell 1998">{{cite journal | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/2/265/1998/hess-2-265-1998.pdf | title=A grid-based distributed flood forecasting model for use with weather radar data: Part 1.

===Transportation planning===
Time-based travel maps can be created for different modes of transportation,<ref name="cikm 2011">{{cite conference | url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2063972&CFID=91078296&CFTOKEN=23380158 | title=Defining isochrones in multimodal spatial networks | accessdate=March 21, 2012 | author=Gamper Johann | booktitle=Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management | year=2011 | conference=[[Conference on Information and Knowledge Management|CIKM]] | location=Glasgow | author2=Böhlen, Michael | author3=Cometti, Willi | author4=Innerebner, Markus | DOI=10.1145/2063576.2063972 | ISBN=9781450307178}}</ref> e.g. foot, pedal cycle, motor vehicle.
