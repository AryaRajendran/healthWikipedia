'''Effective renal plasma flow''' (eRPF) is a measure used in [[renal physiology]]<ref name="urlHubio562: Clearance Lab Answers">{{cite web |url=http://courses.washington.edu/hubio562/clearanceLab/clearancelabAnswers.html |title=Hubio562: Clearance Lab Answers |work= |accessdate=2009-04-29}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> to calculate [[renal plasma flow]] (RPF) and hence estimate [[renal function]].

:<math> eRPF = RPF \times extraction ratio</math>

Where [[extraction ratio]] is the ratio of compound entering the kidney that got excreted into the final urine. 

When using a compound with an extraction ratio near 1, such as [[para-aminohippurate]] (PAH), then eRPF is almost equal to RPF. Therefore, [[PAH clearance]] is a method to estimate [[renal plasma flow]].
