The '''Ebers Papyrus''', also known as '''Papyrus Ebers''', is an [[Egyptian medical papyri|Egyptian medical papyrus]] dating to c. 1550 BC. Among the oldest and most important medical papyri of [[ancient Egypt]], it was purchased at [[Luxor]], ([[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]) in the winter of 1873&ndash;74 by [[Georg Ebers]]. It is currently kept at the [[Leipzig University Library|library]] of the [[University of Leipzig]], in Germany.

==The manuscript==
The papyrus was written in about 1500 BC, but it is believed to have been copied from earlier texts, perhaps dating as far back as 3400 BC.<ref name="Mysticismand">[http://www.urologichistory.museum/content/exhibits/historyforum/mysturo.pdf Mysticism and Urology in Ancient Egypt], by Jennifer Godetsky, MD (PDF file)</ref> The Ebers Papyrus is a 110-page scroll, which is about 20 meters long.<ref name=Ebers1875>{{cite book|title=Papyros Ebers: Das hermetische Buch über die Arzeneimittel der alten Ägypter in hieratischer Schrift, herausgegeben mit Inhaltsangabe und Einleitung versehen von Georg Ebers, mit Hieroglyphisch-Lateinischem Glossar von Ludwig Stern, mit Unterstützung des Königlich Sächsischen Cultusministerium|edition=1|volume=2|author=Ludwig Christian Stern|editor=Ebers G|publisher=W.

The [[Brugsch Papyrus]] provides parallel passages to the Ebers Papyrus, helping to clarify certain passages of the latter.

==Medical knowledge==
[[Image:ebers7766.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Ebers Papyrus]]

The Ebers Papyrus is written in [[hieratic]] Egyptian writing and preserves for us the most voluminous record of ancient Egyptian medicine known. The scroll contains some 700 magical formulas and remedies. It contains many incantations meant to turn away disease-causing demons and there is also evidence of a long tradition of empirical practice and observation. The papyrus contains a "treatise on the [[heart]]". It notes that the heart is the center of the blood supply, with vessels attached for every member of the body. The [[Egyptians]] seem to have known little about the [[kidney]]s and made the heart the meeting point of a number of vessels which carried all the fluids of the body — blood, tears, urine and semen. Mental disorders are detailed in a chapter of the papyrus called the Book of Hearts. Disorders such as [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[dementia]] are covered. The descriptions of these disorders suggest that Egyptians conceived of mental and physical diseases in much the same way. The papyrus contains chapters on contraception, diagnosis of pregnancy and other gynecological matters, intestinal disease and parasites, eye and skin problems, dentistry and the surgical treatment of abscesses and tumors, bone-setting and burns.

===Medicinal use of ochre clays===
One of the common remedies described in the papyrus is [[ochre]], or [[medicinal clay]]. For example, it is prescribed for various intestinal complaints.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050226100008/http://www.macalester.edu/~cuffel/ebers.htm PAPYRUS EBERS], 1937 translation.</ref> It is also prescribed for various eye complaints.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110718092431/http://dianabuja.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/eyes-and-the-papyrus-ebers/ Recipes for Treating the Eyes: Papyrus Ebers]</ref> Yellow ochre is also described as a remedy for [[urological]] complaints.<ref name="Mysticismand" />

==Modern history of the papyrus==
Like the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], the Ebers Papyrus came into the possession of [[Edwin Smith (Egyptologist)|Edwin Smith]] in 1862. The source of the papyrus is unknown, but it was said to have been found between the legs of a [[mummy]] in the [[Assassif]] district of the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] [[necropolis]]. The papyrus remained in the collection of Edwin Smith until at least 1869 when there appeared, in the catalog of an antiquities dealer, an advertisement for "a large medical papyrus in the possession of Edwin Smith, an American farmer of [[Luxor]]." (Breasted 1930) The Papyrus was purchased in 1872 by the [[Germany|German]] [[Egyptologist]] and novelist [[Georg Ebers]] (born in [[Berlin]], 1837), after whom it is named. In 1875, Ebers published a [[facsimile]] with an English-Latin vocabulary and introduction, but it was not translated until 1890, by H. Joachim. Ebers retired from his chair of Egyptology at [[Leipzig]] on a pension and the papyrus remains in the University of Leipzig library.
An English translation of the papyrus was published by [[Paul Ghalioungui]]. The papyrus was published and translated by different researchers (the most valuable is German edition Grundriss der Medizin der alten Ägypter, and based on this Paul Ghalioungui edition).
