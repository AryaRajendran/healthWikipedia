==Background==
===Description of Radionics===
[[File:Radionic instruments.JPG|thumb|220px|Radionic instruments]]According to radionics practitioners, a healthy person will have certain energy frequencies moving through their body that define health, while an unhealthy person will exhibit other, different energy frequencies that define disorders. Radionic devices purport to diagnose and heal by applying appropriate frequencies to balance the discordant frequencies of sickness. Radionics uses  "[[frequency]]" not in its standard meaning but to describe an imputed energy type, which does not correspond to any property of [[energy]] in the scientific sense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy - a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-226-76420-6}}</ref>

In one form of radionics popularised by Abrams, some blood on a bit of filter paper is attached to a device Abrams called a dynamizer, which is attached by wires to a string of other devices and then to the forehead of a healthy volunteer, facing west in a dim light. By tapping on  on his abdomen and searching for areas of "dullness", disease in the donor of the blood is diagnosed by proxy.  Handwriting analysis is also used to diagnose disease under this scheme.<ref name=MorrisFishbein />

Having done this, the practitioner may use a special device known as an oscilloclast or any of a range of other devices to broadcast vibrations at the patient in order to attempt to heal them.<ref name=MorrisFishbein />

[[Albert Abrams]] claimed to detect such frequencies and/or cure people by matching their frequencies, and claimed them sensitive enough that he could tell someone's religion by looking at a drop of blood.<ref name=MorrisFishbein /> He  developed thirteen devices and became a millionaire leasing his devices,<ref name=MorrisFishbein /><ref name=Quackwatch  /> and the [[American Medical Association]] described him as the "dean of gadget quacks,"<ref name=Quackwatch>[http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/News/rife.html Article on Royal Rife] at [[Quackwatch]]</ref> and his devices were definitively proven useless by an independent investigation commissioned by ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1924.<ref name='radionics_Guardian'/>

Modern practitioners now conceptualize these devices merely as a focusing aid to the practitioner's proclaimed [[dowsing]] abilities, and claim that there is no longer any need for the device to have any demonstrable function. Indeed, Abrams' black boxes had no purpose of their own, being merely obfuscated collections of wires and electronic parts.<ref name='radionics_Guardian'>{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Pilkington | coauthors= | title=A vibe for radionics | date=2004-04-15 | publisher= | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2004/apr/15/farout | work =[[The Guardian]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | language = }} "Scientific American concluded: 'At best, [ERA] is all an illusion. At worst, it is a colossal fraud.'"</ref>

==Radiesthesia==

'''Radiesthesia''' is the claimed [[paranormal]] or [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] ability to detect "radiation" within the human body. According to the theory, all human bodies give off unique or characteristic "radiations" as do all other physical bodies or objects. Such radiations are often termed an "[[aura (paranormal)|aura]]".

A practitioner of radiesthesia claims to detect the interplay of these radiations. Thus radiesthesia is cited as the explanation of such phenomena as [[dowsing]] by rods and [[pendulum]]s in order to locate buried substances, diagnose illnesses, and the like. Some radiesthesia practitioners like Israeli mentalist [[Uri Geller]] or German astrologer Alexander Rostamí claim that they can help oil companies to find crude petroleum reserves and other natural resources by using paranormal abilities, but this claim has not been proven.<ref>[http://psychicinvestigator.com/demo/GELRSKP.htm Catching Geller in the Act], C. Eugene Emery, Jr., Providence Sunday Journal, 1987</ref>

The term "radiesthesia" first entered English in the 1930s and was borrowed from the earlier French ''radiésthesie''. The English word is a compound of the prefix ''radi(o)-'', referring to [[radiation]] and the rare term ''aesthesia'' meaning "perception by the senses", or "the capacity for feeling or sensation", which comes from the ancient Greek ''aisthesis'' "a perceiving".

Dr. Solcol W. Tromp wrote about radiesthesia in his 1949 book ''Psychical Physics''. This reference has a bibliography of over 700 titles relating to dowsing and radiesthesia.

[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], in his book ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'', 1954, refers to his own anecdotal experiences with radiesthesia as evidence supporting the existence of "Witch Power".

''The Pendulum'' is a monthly publication devoted to radiesthesia. There are other periodicals, publications, books, societies and numerous websites on the topic.

==Scientific assessment of Radionics==
The claims for radionics devices contradict the accepted principles of biology and physics. No scientifically verifiable mechanisms of function are posited. In this sense, they can be described as magical in operation. No plausible biophysical basis for the "putative energy fields" has been proposed, and neither the fields themselves nor their purported therapeutic effects have been convincingly demonstrated.<ref name='NCCAM'>{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm |title=Energy Medicine: an overview |accessdate=2008-02-09 |publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine }} "In the aggregate, these approaches are among the most controversial of CAM practices because neither the external energy fields nor their therapeutic effects have been demonstrated convincingly by any biophysical means."</ref>

No radionic device has been found efficacious in the diagnosis or treatment of any disease, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] does not recognize any legitimate medical uses of any such device.<ref name="ACS" /> According to David Helwig in ''The Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine'', "most physicians dismiss radionics as quackery."<ref name='radionics_Gale'/>

Internally, a radionic device is very simple, and may not even form a functional [[electrical circuit]].<ref name='radionics_Guardian'/> The wiring in the analysis device is simply used as a mystical conduit.<ref name='Franks_hist'>{{cite journal|title=Reflections on the Ether and some notes on the Convergence between Homeopathy and Radionics|journal=Radionic Journal|date=2000-11|first=Nick|last=Franks|coauthors=|volume=46|issue=2|pages=4–21|id= |url=http://radionic.co.uk/PDFs/Franks_Ether.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-02-09 }}</ref> A radionic device does not use or need electric power, though a power cord may be provided, ostensibly to determine a "base rate" on which the device operates to attempt to heal a subject.<ref name='Scofield'>{{cite web|url=http://radionic.co.uk/PDFs/Mind%20in%20Radionics.pdf|title=The Radionic Principle: Mind over Matter |accessdate=2008-02-09 |last=Scofield |first=Tony |format=PDF}}</ref> Typically, little attempt is made to define or describe what, if anything, is flowing along the wires and being measured.  Energy in the physical sense, i.e., energy that can be sensed and measured, is viewed as subordinate to intent and "creative action".<ref name='Franks_hist'/>
