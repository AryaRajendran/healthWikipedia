'''Electroanalgesia''' is a form of [[analgesia]], or pain relief, that uses [[electricity]] to ease [[pain]]. Electrical [[electronic component|devices]] can be internal or external, at the site of pain (local) or delocalized throughout the whole [[human body|body]]. It works by interfering with the electrical currents of [[pain signals]], inhibiting them from reaching the [[brain]] and inducing a response; different from traditional analgesics, such as [[opiates]] which mimic natural endorphins  and [[NSAID]]S (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) that help relieve inflammation and stop pain at the source. Electroanalgesia has a lower addictive potential and poses less health threats to the general public, but can cause serious health problems, even death, in people with other electrical devices such as [[pacemakers]] or [[hearing aids|internal hearing aids]], or with [[heart disease|heart problems]].

==History==
The first cases of electroanalgesia were documented by Greek scholars, [[Plutarch]] and [[Socrates]], who noticed numbing effects of standing in pools of water on a beach that contained [[electric fish]].<ref name="Jensen">[Jensen, Jack E., Richard R. Conn, Gary Hazelrigg, and John E. Hewett. "The Use of Transcutaneous Neural Stimulation and Isokinetic Testing in Arthroscopic Knee Surgery." The American Journal of Sports Medicine 13 (1985): 27-33].</ref> The Chinese practice of [[acupuncture]], dating back to 3000 BCE, also utilizes the properties of electroanalgesia by stimulating specific [[nerves]] to produce electrical signals which produce pleasurable responses in the brain.<ref>[White, Paul F. "Electroanalgesia: Does it have a place in the routine management of acute and chronic pain?" Anesthesia and Analgesia 98 (2004): 1197-198.].</ref> Another ancient analgesic method, aging back to 5000 BCE in [[Sumer]], is to use [[minerals|natural minerals]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[herbal remedy|herbs]], usually in a mixture with other natural products. Technology invented specifically for electroanalgesia emerged at the beginning of the 1900s.

==Technology==
Advancements in technology within the past fifteen years have created multiple forms of electroanalgesia. Doctors can target specific electrical signals caused by pain and cancel them out using electrical signals, optimally with alternating low and high [[frequency|frequencies]].

===Transcranial electrostimulation===
A theoretical explanation for the mechanism of pain reduction by transcranial electrostimulation, or TCES, suggests that the electrical stimulation activates the anti-nociceptive system in the brain, resulting in β-endorphin, [[serotonin]] and [[noradrenaline]] release.<ref name="gabis">[Gabis L, Shklar B, Geva D: Immediate influence of transcranial electrostimulation on pain and β-endorphin blood levels: An active placebo-controlled study. Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2003;82:81-85.].</ref> TCES can be used on people with cervical pain, chronic lower back syndrome, or migraines.<ref name="gabis" /> It cannot be used on people with orthopedic or radiological potentially serious spinal conditions; involvement in [[litigation]], [[hydrocephalus]], [[epilepsy]], [[glaucoma]], [[malignant hypertension]], [[pacemaker]] or other implanted electronic device; recent [[cerebral trauma]], [[nervous system]] infection, skin [[lesions]] at sites of electrode placement; oncological disease; patients undergoing any other treatments for pain; any invasive therapy, e.g. surgery, within the last month.<ref name="gabis" /> The equipment used is Pulse Mazor Instruments' [[Pulsatilla 1000]], which consists of a headset with three [[electrode]]s, two that go behind the ears and one that goes on the forehead, that release set frequencies of electricity at set intervals.

===Deep brain stimulation===
[[Deep brain stimulation]], or DBS, was first evaluated as an electroanalgesic in the late 1950s. Works in chronic pain patients. DBS decreases pain transmission along [[neural pathway|sensory discriminative pathways]] and/or releases endogenous endorphins. This method has mainly been used for chronic pain patients after all other options have failed due to potential of  intracranial complications (e.g., [[intracranial hemorrhage]], infection, and oculomotor abnormalities). A stimulator and an electrode are guided to the site via [[ventriculography]], [[computed tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. Once in place, the electrode is activated by percutaneous leads. It is effective in treating refractory failed back syndrome, trigeminal and peripheral [[neuropathy]], and deafferentation and somatic pain.<ref>[Heath RG, Mickle WA. Evaluation of seven years' experience with depth electrode studies in human patients. In: Ramey ER, O'Doherty DS, eds. Electrical studies on the unanesthetized brain. New York: Paul B. Hoeber, 1960:214–47.].</ref>

===Peripheral nerve stimulation===
The use of peripheral nerve stimulation, or PNS, for the relief of chronic pain states was first reported over 30 years ago.<ref>[Wall PD, Sweet WH. Temporary abolition of pain in man. Science 1967;155:108 –9.].</ref> Recent studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of [[nerve]]s leads to inhibitory input to the pain pathways at the [[spinal cord]] level.<ref>[Hanai F. Effect of electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves on
neuropathic pain. Spine 2000;25:1886 –92.].</ref> PNS is most effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain (e.g., posttraumatic neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy) when the nerve lesion is distal to the site of stimulation.<ref name="white">[White, Paul F., Shitong Li, and Jen W. Chiu. "Electroanalgeia: Its Role in Acute and Chronic Pain Management." Anestesia and Analgesia 92 (2001): 505-13.].</ref>

===Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation===
Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or PENS, is used mainly in the treatment of intractable pain associated with chronic low back pain syndrome, cancer, and other disorders.<ref name="white" /> It is a technique involving insertion of an ultra-fine acupuncture needle which probes into the [[soft tissue]]s or [[muscle]]s to electrically stimulate nerve fibers in the [[Sclerotome|sclerotomal]], [[myotome|myotomal]], or [[Dermatome (anatomy)|dermatomal]] distribution corresponding to the patient's pain symptoms. PENS is related to both [[electroacupuncture]] and [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]].<ref name="white" />

===Percutaneous neuromodulation therapy===
PENS used to be a term to describe a neurosurgical procedure involving implantation of temporary stimulating electrodes before an [[SCS device]].<ref>[North RB, Fischell TA, Long DM. Chronic stimulation via percutaneously inserted epidural electrodes. Neurosurgery 1977;1: 215–8.].</ref> The term has recently been changed to percutaneous neuromodulation therapy, or PNT. The term PNT was chosen because it more accurately describes the neurophysiologic basis for PENS-induced analgesia.

===Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation===
{{main|Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}}
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, involves the transmission of electrical energy from an external stimulator to the peripheral nervous system via cutaneously placed [[conductive gel pads]]. TENS can be subclassified into two variants:
* low-intensity (1–2 mA), high-frequency (50–100&nbsp;Hz) TENS; and
* acupuncture-like high-intensity (15–20 mA), low-frequency (1–5&nbsp;Hz) or "dense-disperse" TENS.<ref>[Han JS, Chen XH, Sun SL, et al. Effect of low- and high-frequency TENS on Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe and dynorphin A immunoreactivity in human lumbar CSF. Pain 1991;47:295– 8.].</ref>
The purported mechanism of action of TENS invokes both spinal supraspinal theories.<ref name="white" />

===Transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation===
Transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation, or TAES, is a variant of TENS therapy that involves applying cutaneous electrodes at classical Chinese [[acupoint]]s and stimulating with alternating high- and low-frequency electrical current ("[[dense-disperse]]").<ref>[Wang BG, Tang J, White PF, et al. Effect of the intensity of transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation on the postoperative analgesic requirement. Anesth Analg 1997;85:406 –13.].</ref> Acupoint stimulation is as effective as [[Dermatome (anatomy)|dermatomal]] stimulation in producing an analgesic-sparing effect after [[lower abdominal surgery]]<ref>[Chen L, Tang J, White PF, et al. The effect of location of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on postoperative opioid analgesic requirement: acupoint versus nonacupoint stimulation. Anesth Analg 1998;87:1129 –34.].</ref>

===H-wave therapy===
{{redirect|H-wave|the concept in electromyography|H-reflex}}

H-wave therapy (HWT) is a form of electrical stimulation that produces a direct, localized effect on the conduction of underlying nerves.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=Brona C.|coauthors=Andrea S. Lowe, Deirdre M. Walsh, G. David Baxter, Jim M. Allen|month=September|year=1996|title=The effect of H-wave therapy upon conduction in the human superficial radial nerve ''in vivo''|journal=[[Experimental Physiology]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=[[New York City]]|volume=81|issue=5|pages=821–832|issn=0958-0670|oclc=20954666|url=http://ep.physoc.org/content/81/5/821.full.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=8889480}}</ref> The electrical stimulation used in HWT differs from other forms of electrical stimulation such as TENS in terms of its [[waveform]]; it is intended to emulate the H waveform found in [[Action potential|nerve signals]], thus permitting the machine to use less power while attaining greater and deeper penetration of its low-frequency current. The waves used in HWT are distinct from the H-waves that are part of [[electromyography]]. It has been used in the treatment of pain related to [[diabetic neuropathy]], muscle [[sprain]]s, [[temporomandibular joint disorder]]s, type I [[complex regional pain syndrome]] as well as the healing of wounds such as [[diabetic ulcer]]s.<ref name="regence_estim_pol">{{cite web|url=http://blue.regence.com/trgmedpol/dme/dme11.html|title=Durable Medical Equipment Section - Electrical Stimulation Devices for Home Use|date=2009-01-01|work=Medical policy|publisher=[[The Regence Group]]|accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref><ref name="aetna_estim_pol">{{cite web|url=http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/1_99/0011.html|title=Clinical Policy Bulletin: Electrical Stimulation for Pain|date=2009-03-04|publisher=[[Aetna]]|accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> This electroanalgesic modality was originally recommended as an alternative to TENS for [[Dentistry|dental]] analgesia. In a 1999 [[randomized controlled trial]] involving a mechanical pain model, the analgesic effects of HWT were found to be short-lasting and identical to those provided by TENS therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=Brona C.|coauthors=Kenneth McCormack, Deirdre M. Walsh, David G. Baxter, Jim M. Allen|month=September|year=1999|title=Comparative analgesic effects of H-wave therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on pain threshold in humans|journal=[[Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]]|publisher=[[W. B. Saunders]]|volume=80|issue=9|pages=1001–1004|issn=0003-9993|oclc=1513891|pmid=10488999|doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(99)90051-5}}</ref> HWT has not been shown effective in reducing pain in cases other than diabetic neuropathy, nor has it been shown effective in reducing edema or swelling, and it has specifically not been shown effective in treating [[chronic pain]] due to [[ischemia]].<ref name="aetna_estim_pol" />

===Interferential current therapy===
Interferential current therapy, or ICT, is another variant of TENS that uses the principle of [[amplitude modulation]] to decrease the discomfort of stimulating deeper [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] (e.g., muscle) when using transcutaneously applied electrical current. A combination of different stimulation frequencies are used (i.e., one fixed at 4&nbsp;kHz and another within a variable range) to generate frequencies between 4 and 250&nbsp;Hz which are alleged to more effectively penetrate the soft tissues while producing less discomfort at the skin surface.<ref>[Goats GC. Interferential current therapy. Br J Sports Med 1990; 24:87–92.].</ref> With ICT, its postulated mechanism of analgesic action is through direct stimulation of muscle fibers rather than nerves, allegedly improving muscle blood flow and promoting the healing process. Although ICT is used widely in the [[physiotherapy]] and [[Physical therapy|rehabilitative]] medicine settings, there is a dearth of rigorously controlled studies to justify its effectiveness in the management of either acute or chronic pain syndromes.<ref name="white" />

===Piezo-electric current therapy===
Piezo-electric current therapy, or PECT, is an analgesic technique based on the principle that mechanical deformation of a motorized [[piezoelectric]] [[ceramic]] rod produces a burst of 10 [[electrical pulses]] (five positive and five negative), each lasting 2–3 [[Millisecond|ms]]. Each electrical burst lasts for 50 to 250 ms (depending on the motor speed set) and generates a current of approximately 25 [[Milliampere|mA]]. The application of PECT to the skin for 2 min produces a tolerable "pricking" pain sensation associated with a neurogenic inflammatory response lasting 3–4 h.<ref name="white" /> The extent and duration of this inhibitory process is directly related to the intensity of the applied stimulus and is alleged to be associated with the release of endogenous endorphins.<ref>[Willer JC, Le Bars D, De Broucker T. Diffuse noxious inhibitory control in man: involvement of an opioidergic link. Eur J Pharmacol 1990;182:347–55.].</ref>

==Controversies==
Electroanalgesia poses serious health problems in those patients who need other electrical equipment in their bodies, such as [[pacemaker]]s and [[hearing aid]]s, because the electrical signals of the multiple devices can interfere with each other and fail. People with [[heart]] problems, such as [[irregular heartbeat]], are also at risk because the devices can throw off the normal electrical signal of the heart.
