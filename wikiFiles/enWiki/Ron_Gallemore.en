'''Ron P. Gallemore''' is a registered Ophthalmologist with the American Academy of Ophthalmology,<ref>The American Academy of Ophthalmology [http://www.aao.org/find_eyemd.cfm?fuseaction=profile&v_customer=000000203550&srow= Dr Ron Gallemore certification]</ref> and has been notable in the research and treatment of diseases of the [[macula]] and [[retina]].

== Career ==

Ron P. Gallemore attained his undergraduate degree from the University of California, Irvine, before going on to complete his M.D. at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He completed his Ph.D in the field of Neuroscience and began a career focusing on the physiology and biophysics of retinal function.

In his progression of training he conducted his internship at the Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in San Diego, CA, before going on to undertake his residency at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at the UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, where he later became a clinical instructor. He completed his vitreoretinal surgery fellowship at Duke University under Dr. Robert Machemer, known as the founder of modern vitreoretinal surgery.<ref>Machemer R. "The development of pars plana vitrectomy: a personal account." ''Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol.'' 1995 Aug;233(8):453-68. PMID 8537019.</ref>

Throughout his career Gallemore has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the Heed and Knapp Fellowship award, the Dr. Charles Schepens Award, the Dr. Ron Michels Award,<ref>[http://www.michelsfoundation.org/winners.html Award Recipients - Ronald G. Michels Fellowship]</ref> and the Jules Stein Eye Institute Alumni Research Award.

He continues to make contributions in the field of diseases of the retina through research, clinical trials, clinical instruction, and public lectures and appearances. In 2007 he founded the Retina Macula Institute where he is currently the principal doctor and surgeon.
