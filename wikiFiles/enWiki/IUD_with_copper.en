A '''copper IUD''' ([[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System|ATC]] {{ATC|G02|BA}}) (also '''intrauterine device''', '''IUD''', '''copper-T''', or '''coil''') is a type of [[intrauterine device]]. The copper IUD is a type of [[long-acting reversible contraception]] and is one of the most effective forms of birth control.<ref name=Winner2012>{{citation

==Device description==
There are a number of models of the copper IUD available around the world. Most copper devices consist of a plastic core that is wrapped in a copper wire.<ref name=Kulier2008>{{citation

Many of the devices, included the TCu 380A ([[ParaGard]]), have a T-shape similar to the [[IUD with progestogen|hormonal IUD]]. However, there are "frameless" copper IUDs available around the world as well. ParaGard is the only model currently available in the United States. Early copper IUDs had copper around only the vertical stem, but more recent models have copper sleeves wrapped around the horizontal arms as well, increasing effectiveness.<ref name=Sivin1979>{{citation

Some newer models also contain a silver core instead of a plastic core to delay copper fragmentation as well as increase the lifespan of the device. The lifespan of the devices range from 3 years to 10 years; however, some studies have demonstrated that the TCu 380A may be effective through 12 years.<ref name=WHO1987>{{citation

===Insertion===
The copper IUD must be inserted by a qualified medical practitioner. A copper IUD can be inserted at any phase of the menstrual cycle, but the optimal time is right after the menstrual period, when the cervix is softest and the woman is least likely to be pregnant.<ref name=emedicinehealth/> The insertion process generally takes five minutes or less. The procedure can cause cramping or be painful for some women. 
Before placement of an IUD, a [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]] by a medical professional is useful to check for any contraindications or concerns.<ref name=emedicinehealth>[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/birth_control_intrauterine_devices_iuds/article_em.htm Birth Control Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)] Author: Omnia M Samra.

The strings allow the patient or clinician to periodically check to ensure the IUD is still in place and to enable easy removal of the device.<ref name="Dean 2011"/>

The copper IUD can be inserted at any time in a woman's menstrual cycle as long as the woman is not pregnant.<ref name=WHO1987 /> An IUD can also be inserted immediately postpartum and post-abortion as long as no infection has occurred.<ref name= CDC2010>{{citation

Removal of the copper IUD should also be performed by a qualified medical practitioner.

==Effectiveness==
Copper IUDs are a form of [[long-acting reversible contraception]] and are considered to be one of the most effective forms of birth control available.<ref name=Winner2012 /> The type of frame and amount of copper can affect the effectiveness of different copper IUD models.<ref name =Kulier2008 /> The failure rates for different models vary between 0.1 and 2.2% after 1 year of use. The T-shaped models with a surface area of 380mm² of copper have the lowest failure rates. The TCu 380A (ParaGard) has a one year failure rate of 0.8% and a cumulative 12-year failure rate of 2.2%.<ref name=Kulier2008 /> Over 12 years of use, the models with less surface area of copper have higher failure rates. The TCu 220A has a 12 year failure rate of 5.8%, whereas the TCu 380A has a 12 year failure rate of 2.2%.<ref name=Kulier2008 /> The frameless GyneFix also has a failure rate of less than 1% per year.<!--

 --><ref name="population2" />

Unlike other forms of reversible contraception , the typical use failure rate and the perfect use failure rate for the copper IUDs are the same because the IUD does not depend on user action.<ref name=Winner2012 /> A 2008 review of the available T-shaped copper IUDs recommended that the TCu 380A and the TCu 280S be used as the first choice for copper IUDs because those two models have the lowest failure rates and the longest lifespans.<ref name=Kulier2008 /> The effectiveness of the copper IUD is comparable to tubal sterilization, which has a first year failure rate of 0.5%.<ref name=Guttmacher2012>{{cite web |author=The Guttmacher Institute |title=Contraceptive Use in the United States |year=2012 |html=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html}}</ref> However, the effects of the copper IUD are reversible, which can be viewed as either an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on a woman's goals for contraception.

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Iuddiagram.jpg|thumb|A diagram showing a copper IUD in place in uterus.]]
The copper IUD's primary mechanism of action is to prevent fertilization.<ref name="Dean 2011"/><ref name="Ortiz 2007">{{cite journal|last1=Ortiz|first1=María Elena|last2=Croxatto|first2=Horacio B.|month=June|year=2007|title=Copper-T intrauterine device and levonorgestrel intrauterine system: biological bases of their mechanism of action|journal=Contraception|volume=75|issue=6 Suppl|pages=S16‒S30|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2007.01.020|pmid=17531610}} p. S28:<blockquote>Conclusions<br/>Active substances released from the IUD or IUS, together with products derived from the inflammatory reaction present in the luminal fluids of the genital tract, are toxic for spermatozoa and oocytes, preventing the encounter of healthy gametes and the formation of viable embryos. The current data do not indicate that embryos are formed in IUD users at a rate comparable to that of nonusers. The common belief that the usual mechanism of action of IUDs in women is destruction of embryos in the uterus is not supported by empirical evidence. The bulk of the data indicate that interference with the reproductive process after fertilization has taken place is exceptional in the presence of a T-Cu or LNG-IUD and that the usual mechanism by which they prevent pregnancy in women is by preventing fertilization.</blockquote></ref><ref name="Speroff 2011a">{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Intrauterine contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|pages=239–280|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}} p. 246:<blockquote>Mechanism of action<br/>The contraceptive action of all IUDs is mainly in the intrauterine cavity.

It is believed that this reaction, a sterile inflammatory response, produces tissue injury of a minor degree but sufficient enough to be spermicidal. Very few, if any, sperm reach the ovum in the fallopian tube… In women using copper IUDs, sensitive assays for human chorionic gonadotropin do not find evidence of fertilization.<sup>62,63</sup> This is consistent with the fact that the copper IUD protects against both intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies.<br/>The copper IUD releases free copper and copper salts that have both a biochemical and morphological impact on the endometrium and also produce alterations in cervical mucus and endometrial secretions...

Potentially, they interfere with sperm function and transport within the uterus and tubes. It is difficult to determine whether fertilization of the oocyte is impaired by these compromised sperm. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that IUDs can prevent and disrupt implantation. The extent to which this interference contributes to its contraceptive action is unknown.

An additional advantage of using the copper IUD for emergency contraception is that it can be used as a form of birth control for 10–12 years after insertion.<ref name=Cleland2012 />

==Side effects==
'''Expulsion''': Sometimes the copper IUD can be spontaneously expelled from the uterus.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> Expulsion rates can range from 2.2% to 11.4% of users from the first year to the 10th year. The TCu380A may have lower rates of expulsion than other models.<ref name=Kane2010>{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Long-term safety, efficacy, and patient acceptability of the intrauterine Copper T-380A contraceptive device |journal=[[International Journal of Women's Health]] |volume=2 |pages=211–220 |pmc=2971735 |pmid=21072313 |author=Kaneshiro B, Aeby T}}</ref> Unusual vaginal discharge, cramping or pain, spotting between periods, postcoital (after sex) spotting, dyspareunia, or the absence or lengthening of the strings can be signs of a possible expulsion.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> If expulsion occurs, the woman is not protected against pregnancy.

'''Perforation''': Very rarely, the IUD can move through the wall of the uterus.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> Risk of perforation is mostly determined by the skill of the practitioner performing the insertion. For experienced medical practitioners, the risk of perforation is 1 per 1,000 insertions or less.<ref name=WHO1987 /> If perforation does occur it can damage the internal organs, and in some cases surgery is needed to remove the IUD. 

'''Infection''': The insertion of a copper IUD poses a transient risk of [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID) in the first 21 days after insertion. However, it is a small risk and is attributable to preexisting [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] infection at the time of insertion, and not to the IUD itself.<ref name=Moh2006 /><!--

'''Cramping''':Many women feel cramping or pain during the IUD insertion process and immediately after as a result of cervix dilation during insertion.<ref name=IUDUpdatepain>IUDs-An Update.

 --> Some women may have cramps for 1 to 2 weeks following insertion. The copper IUD can also increase cramps during a woman’s period. This symptom will clear up for some women in 3 to 6 months, but may not for others.<ref name="Dean 2011"/>

'''Heavier Periods''': The copper IUD increases the amount of blood flow during a woman’s [[menstrual cycle|menstrual periods]].<ref name=IUDUpdatepain /> On average, menstrual [[Bleeding|blood loss]] increases by 20–50% after insertion of a copper-T IUD; increased menstrual discomfort is the most common medical reason for IUD removal. This symptom may clear up for some women after 3 to 6 months, but may not for others. Despite this, anemia is not listed as a contraindication by the World Health Organization.<ref name=WHOMEC />

'''Irregular Bleeding and Spotting''': For the first 3 to 6 months after insertion, the copper IUD can cause irregular periods and spotting between periods.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> 

'''String problems''': A small portion of men report that they can feel the strings during intercourse. In this case, strings can be trimmed. However, very short strings can prevent the woman from checking the strings for expulsion.<ref name="Dean 2011"/>

'''Pregnancy''': Although rare, if pregnancy does occur with the copper IUD in place there can be serious side effects. The risk of [[ectopic pregnancy]] to a woman using an IUD is lower than the risk of ectopic pregnancy to a woman using no form of birth control.

Some [[barrier contraception|barrier contraceptives]] protect against [[sexually transmitted disease|STIs]]. [[Hormonal contraceptives]] reduce the risk of developing [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID), a serious complication of certain STIs. IUDs, by contrast, do ''not'' protect against STIs or PID.<!--

==Contraindications==
A category 3 condition indicates conditions where the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of inserting a copper IUD. A category 4 condition indicates conditions that represent an unacceptable health risk if a copper IUD is inserted.

Women should not use a copper IUD if they:

(Category 4)
*Are pregnant or think they may be pregnant
*Septic pregnancy or abortion
*Have unexplained abnormal vaginal bleeding
*Have untreated cervical cancer
*Have [[malignant]] [[gestational trophoblastic disease]]
*Have uterine cancer
*Have certain uterine abnormalities
*Have or may have had a pelvic infection within the past three months
*Have or may have an STI
*Have pelvic tuberculosis

(Category  3) 
*Are [[postpartum]] between 48 hours and 4 weeks (increased IUD expulsion rate with delayed postpartum insertion). The CDC and WHO criteria differ in their recommendation for women postpartum between 48 hours and 4 weeks. The CDC does not list this as a contraindication.
*Have [[benign]] [[gestational trophoblastic disease]]
*Have [[ovarian cancer]]
*Have [[AIDS]] (unless clinically well on [[antiretroviral drug|anti-retroviral therapy]])
*Have very high individual likelihood of exposure to [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydial]] [[sexually transmitted infection|STI]]s

A full list of contraindications can be found in the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] ''Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use''<ref name=WHOMEC /> and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] ''United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use''.<ref name="CDC2010"/>

While [[Parity (medicine)|nulliparous]] women (women who have never given birth) are somewhat more likely to have side effects, this is not a contraindication for IUD use. Overall, IUDs are safe and acceptable also in young nulliparous women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Forthofer KV |title=A clinical review of the intrauterine device as an effective method of contraception |journal=J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=693–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19930283 |doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.2009.01067.x |url=}}</ref> The same is likely the case for [[virgin]] women, unless there is a [[microperforate hymen]] that obstructs any insertion of the IUD.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Advantages===
*One of the most effective forms of reversible birth control
*Can be used while breastfeeding
*Works immediately upon insertion
*Nothing to do right before sex to ensure effectiveness
*Fertility returns quickly upon removal
*Does not contain any hormones
*Lasts for 10 to 12 years
*Can be used for emergency contraception
*Does not interact with any medications

===Disadvantages===
*Periods can get heavier and longer. Usually clears up within weeks or months, but it may not for some women.
*Worse menstrual cramps. Usually goes away after the first few weeks or months, but it may not for some women.
*Irregular periods or spotting between periods and other possible side effects
*Does not prevent STDs.

==History==
According to popular legend, Arab traders inserted small stones into the uteruses of their camels to prevent pregnancy during long desert treks. The story was originally a [[tall tale]] to entertain delegates at a scientific conference on [[family planning]]; although it was later repeated as truth, it has no known historical basis.<!--

Precursors to IUDs were first marketed in 1902. Developed from stem [[pessary|pessaries]] (where the stem held the pessary in place over the cervix), the 'stem' on these devices actually extended into the uterus itself. Because they occupied both the vagina and the uterus, this type of stem pessary was also known as an ''interuterine device''.  Use of ''interuterine'' devices was associated with high rates of infection; for this reason, they were condemned by the medical community.<!--

The first intrauterine device (contained entirely in the uterus) was described in a [[Germany|German]] publication in 1909, although the author appears to have never marketed his product.<!--
  --><ref name="IUD">{{cite journal |year=2000 | month = February |title=Evolution and Revolution: The Past, Present, and Future of Contraception | journal = Contraception Online (Baylor College of Medicine)  | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=93}}</ref>

In 1929, Dr. [[Ernst Gräfenberg]] of [[Germany]] published a report on an IUD made of silk suture. He had found a 3% pregnancy rate among 1,100 women using his ring. In 1930, Dr. Gräfenberg reported a lower pregnancy rate of 1.6% among 600 women using an improved ring wrapped in silver wire. Unbeknownst to Dr. Gräfenberg, the silver wire was contaminated with 26% copper. [[Copper]]'s role in increasing IUD efficacy would not be recognized until nearly 40 years later.

In 1934, Japanese physician Tenrei Ota developed a variation of the ''[[Gräfenberg ring]]'' that contained a supportive structure in the center. The addition of this central disc lowered the IUD's expulsion rate. These devices still had high rates of infection, and their use and development was further stifled by World War II politics: contraception was forbidden in both Nazi Germany and Axis-allied Japan. The Western world did not learn of the work by Gräfenberg and Ota until well after the war ended.<!--

The first plastic IUD, the ''Margulies Coil'' or ''Margulies Spiral'', was introduced in 1958. This device was somewhat large, causing discomfort to a large proportion of women users, and had a hard plastic tail, causing discomfort to their male partners.  The modern colloquialism "coil" is based on the [[coil]]-shaped design of early IUDs.

The ''Lippes Loop'', a slightly smaller device with a monofilament tail, was introduced in 1962 and gained in popularity over the Margulies device.<!--

The [[stainless steel]] single-ring IUD was developed in the 1970s<!--

Dr. Howard Tatum, in the USA, conceived the plastic T-shaped IUD in 1968. Shortly thereafter Dr. Jaime Zipper, in Chile, introduced the idea of adding copper to the devices to improve their contraceptive effectiveness.<!--

The poorly designed [[Dalkon Shield]] plastic IUD (which had a multifilament tail) was manufactured by the A. H. Robins Company and sold by Robins in the United States for three and a half years from January 1971 through June 1974, before sales were suspended by Robins on June 28, 1974 at the request of the FDA because of safety concerns following reports of 110 septic spontaneous abortions in women with the Dalkon Shield in place, seven of whom had died.<!--

Dr. Tatum developed many different models of the copper IUD. He created the TCu220 C, which had copper collars as opposed to copper filament, which prevented metal loss and increased the lifespan of the device.  Second-generation copper-T IUDs were also introduced in the 1970s. These devices had higher surface areas of copper, and for the first time consistently achieved effectiveness rates of greater than 99%.<!--
 --><ref name="population2" /> The last model Tatum developed was the TCu380A, the model that is most recommended today.<ref name=Kulier2008 /> In addition to T-shaped IUDs, there are also U-shaped IUDs (such as the Multiload) and 7-shaped Gravigard Copper 7 (with a mini version for nulliparous women introduced in the 1980s). More recently, a frameless IUD called Gynefix was introduced.

== Types of IUDs available ==
