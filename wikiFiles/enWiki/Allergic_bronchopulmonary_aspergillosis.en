In [[medicine]], '''allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis''' ('''ABPA''') is a condition characterised by an exaggerated response of the [[immune system]] (a [[Hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity response]]) to the [[fungus]] ''[[Aspergillus]]'' (most commonly ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''). It occurs most often in patients with [[asthma]] or [[cystic fibrosis]]. ''Aspergillus'' [[spore]]s are ubiquitous in soil and are commonly found in the [[sputum]] of healthy individuals. ''A. fumigatus'' is responsible for a spectrum of lung diseases known as [[aspergillosis|aspergilloses]].

ABPA causes [[airway]] [[inflammation]] which can ultimately be complicated by sacs of the airways ([[bronchiectasis]]). The disease may cause airway constriction ([[bronchospasm]]). Besides asthma and cystic fibrosis, ABPA can also resemble other conditions such as [[eosinophilic pneumonia]].

The exact criteria for the diagnosis of ABPA are not agreed upon. [[Chest X-ray]]s and [[CT scan]]s, raised blood levels of [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] and [[eosinophilia|eosinophil]]s, immunological tests for ''Aspergillus'' together with sputum [[Gram staining|staining]] and [[sputum culture]]s can be useful. [[Biopsy|Biopsies]] are rarely needed. Treatment consists of [[corticosteroids]] and [[antifungal medication]]s.

==Symptoms==
Patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis often have [[symptom]]s of poorly controlled [[asthma]], with [[wheezing]], [[cough]], [[shortness of breath]] and [[exercise intolerance]]. They also have symptoms reminding of [[bronchiectasis]], such as chronic [[sputum]] production, coughing up brownish mucoid plugs or even blood (the latter is called [[hemoptysis]]), and recurrent infections (with [[fever]] and [[malaise]]). However, since the infiltrates in ABPA indicate [[eosinophilic pneumonia]], they do not respond to treatment with [[antibiotics]]. There may be unexplained worsening of asthma or [[cystic fibrosis]].

==Diagnosis==
A complete blood count usually reveals [[eosinophilia]] more than 10% and there is a raised serum IgE more than 1000&nbsp;ng/ml.

''Chest radiography'' shows various transient abnormalities:
*consolidation, infiltrates or collapse
*thickened bronchial wall markings
*peripheral shadows
*signs of [[bronchiectasis]], typically in a central location

*aspergillus-specific IgE [[RAST test]]
*skin-prick test is almost always positive to Aspergillus fumigatus

Fungal hyphae may be seen in the sputum.

==Treatment==
The aim of treatment is to suppress the immune reaction to the fungus and to control bronchospasm. 

The immune reaction is suppressed using oral [[corticosteroids]]:
*a high dose of [[prednisolone]] or [[prednisone]] (30 to 45&nbsp;mg per day) in acute attacks
*a lower maintenance dose (5–10&nbsp;mg per day)

Mucus plugs may be removed by bronchoscopic aspiration. It is almost impossible to eradicate the fungus but frequently [[itraconazole]] (an anti-fungal) is used in combination with steroid therapy, which often results in a reduction of the steroid dose required. Regular monitoring of the condition includes chest x-rays, [[spirometry|pulmonary function tests]], and serum IgE. The antibody levels usually fall as the disease is controlled, but they may rise again as an early sign of flare-ups.
There are also case reports of the use of omalizumab in the treatment of ABPA.<ref>Collins, Jennifer MD, Hudes, Golda, MD, PH.D and Rosenstriech, David MD. Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis Treated Successfully with Omalizumab: Three Case Reports.

==Epidemiology==
Estimating the prevalence of ABPA has been made difficult by lack of uniform diagnostic criteria and standardised tests. It usually occurs as a complication of other chronic lung disease, in particular [[asthma]] or [[cystic fibrosis]]. It is estimated that ABPA may be present in between 0.5 and 2% of all asthma patients, and in between 1 and 15% of cystic fibrosis patients.<ref name="pmid12975753">{{cite journal |author=Stevens DA, Moss RB, Kurup VP, ''et al.'' |title=Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in cystic fibrosis--state of the art: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Consensus Conference |journal=Clin.

==Disease mechanism==
For an unknown reason, patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis develop a [[hypersensitivity response]], both a [[type I hypersensitivity|type I]] response ([[atopy|atopic]], with formation of [[immunoglobulin E]] or IgE) and a [[type III hypersensitivity]] response (with formation of [[immunoglobulin G]] or IgG). The reaction of immunoglobulin E with Aspergillus [[antigen]]s results in [[mast cell]] [[degranulation]] with [[bronchoconstriction]] and increased [[capillary]] [[Vascular permeability|permeability]]. Immune complexes (a type III reaction) and inflammatory cells are then deposited within the [[mucous membrane]]s of the airways, leading to [[necrosis]] (tissue death) and an [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophilic]] infiltrate. Type 2 [[T helper cell]]s secreting [[interleukin 4]] and [[interleukin 5]], and attraction of [[neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]] by [[interleukin 8]] seem to play an important role.

In spite of this pronounced immune reaction, the fungus is not cleared from the airways. [[Proteolytic enzyme]]s are released by the immune cells, and toxins are released by the fungi. Together these result in [[bronchiectasis]], most pronounced in the central parts of the airways. Repeated acute episodes left untreated can result in progressive pulmonary [[fibrosis]] that is often seen in the upper zones and can give rise to a similar radiological appearance to that produced by [[tuberculosis]].

This model explains the main features of episodic bronchospasm, increased mucus production and plugging of distal airways, leading to their collapse and subsequent bronchiectasis.
