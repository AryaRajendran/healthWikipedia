== Isoforms ==
There are two types of orexin: [[orexin-A]] and -B (hypocretin-1 and -2). They are excitatory [[neuropeptide]] [[hormones]] with approximately 50% sequence identity, are produced by cleavage of a single precursor protein. Orexin-A is 33 amino acid residues long and has two intrachain [[disulfide bond]]s; orexin-B is a linear 28 amino acid residue peptide. Studies suggest that orexin-A may be of greater biological importance than orexin-B. Although these peptides are produced by a very small population of cells in the lateral and posterior [[hypothalamus]], they send projections throughout the brain.  The orexin peptides bind to the two [[G-protein coupled receptor|G-protein coupled]] [[orexin receptor]]s, [[Hypocretin (orexin) receptor 1|OX<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2|OX<sub>2</sub>]], with orexin-A binding to both OX<sub>1</sub> and OX<sub>2</sub> with approximately equal affinity while orexin-B binds mainly to OX<sub>2</sub> and is 5 times less potent at OX<sub>1</sub>.<ref name="pmid14691055">{{cite journal | author = Langmead CJ, Jerman JC, Brough SJ, Scott C, Porter RA, Herdon HJ | title = Characterisation of the binding of 3H-SB-674042, a novel nonpeptide antagonist, to the human orexin-1 receptor | journal = Br.

The orexins are strongly conserved peptides, found in all major classes of vertebrates.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Function ==
The orexin system was initially suggested to be primarily involved in the stimulation of food intake, based on the finding that central administration of orexin-A increases food intake. In addition, it stimulates wakefulness and [[energy (psychological)|energy]] expenditure.

=== Brown fat activation ===
Obesity in orexin [[knockout mice]] is a result of inability of brown preadipocytes to differentiate into [[brown adipose tissue]] (BAT), which in turn reduces BAT [[thermogenesis]]. BAT differentiation can be restored in these knockout mice through injections of orexin. Deficiency in orexin has also been linked to [[narcolepsy]], a sleep disorder. Furthermore narcoleptic people are more likely to be obese.  Hence obesity in narcoleptic patients may be due to orexin deficiency leading to brown-fat hypo activity and reduced energy expenditure.<ref name="pmid21982708">{{cite journal | author = Sellayah D, Bharaj P, Sikder D | title = Orexin is required for brown adipose tissue development, differentiation, and function | journal = Cell Metab. | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 478–90 | year = 2011 | month = October | pmid = 21982708 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2011.08.010 | laysummary = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111004123554.htm | laysource = ScienceDaily }}</ref>

=== Wakefulness ===
Orexin seems to promote wakefulness. Recent studies indicate that a major role of the orexin system is to integrate metabolic, circadian and [[sleep debt]] influences to determine whether an animal should be asleep or awake and active. Orexin neurons strongly excite various brain nuclei with important roles in wakefulness including the [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[histamine]] and [[acetylcholine]] systems<ref name="pmid9614245">{{cite journal | author = Sherin JE, Elmquist JK, Torrealba F, Saper CB | title = Innervation of histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons by GABAergic and galaninergic neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus of the rat | journal = J.

The discovery that an orexin receptor mutation causes the [[sleep disorder]] canine [[narcolepsy]]<ref name="pmid10458611">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81965-0 | author = Lin L, Faraco J, et. al. | title = The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene | journal = Cell | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 365–376 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10458611 }}</ref> in [[Doberman Pinscher]]s  subsequently indicated a major role for this system in [[sleep]] regulation.

Dogs that lack a functional receptor for orexin have narcolepsy, while animals and people lacking the orexin neuropeptide itself also have narcolepsy.

Central administration of orexin-A strongly promotes wakefulness, increases body temperature, locomotion and elicits a strong increase in energy expenditure. [[Sleep deprivation]] also increases orexin-A transmission.  The orexin system may thus be more important in the regulation of energy expenditure than food intake. In fact, orexin-deficient narcoleptic patients have increased obesity rather than decreased [[Body mass index|BMI]], as would be expected if orexin were primarily an appetite stimulating peptide.  Another indication that deficits of orexin cause narcolepsy is that depriving monkeys of sleep for 30–36 hours and then injecting them with the neurochemical alleviates the cognitive deficiencies normally seen with such amount of sleep loss.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/12/sleep_deprivation | title = Snorting a Brain Chemical Could Replace Sleep |accessdate = 2008-02-05 | author= Alexis Madrigal | date= 2007-12-28 | publisher = Wired News, Condé Nast  }}</ref><ref name="pmid18160631">{{cite journal | author = Deadwyler SA, Porrino L, Siegel JM, Hampson RE | title = Systemic and nasal delivery of orexin-A (Hypocretin-1) reduces the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance in nonhuman primates | journal = J.

=== Food Intake ===
Orexin increases the craving for food, and correlates with the function of the substances that promote its production.

[[Leptin]] is a hormone produced by fat cells and acts as a long-term internal measure of energy state. [[Ghrelin]] is a short-term factor secreted by the stomach just before an expected meal, and strongly promotes food intake. 

Orexin-producing cells have recently been shown to be inhibited by leptin (through the leptin receptor pathway), but are activated by ghrelin and [[hypoglycemia]] ([[glucose]] inhibits orexin production). Orexin, as of 2007, is claimed to be a very important link between metabolism and sleep regulation.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Such a relationship has been long suspected, based on the observation that long-term sleep deprivation in rodents dramatically increases food intake and energy metabolism, i.e., [[catabolism]], with lethal consequences on a long-term basis.

=== Pharmacologic potential ===
The research on orexin mimics is still in an early phase, although many scientists believe that orexin-based drugs could help [[narcolepsy|narcoleptics]] and increase alertness in the brain without the side effects of [[amfetamine|amphetamines]].

Merck reported at the Sleep 2012 conference that insomniacs taking an orexin blocker, [[suvorexant]], fell asleep faster and slept an hour longer. Suvorexant was tested for three months on over a thousand patients in a phase III trial.

Preliminary research has been conducted that shows potential for orexin blockers in the treatment of [[alcoholism]]. [[Brown rat|Lab rat]]s given drugs which targeted the orexin system lost interest in alcohol despite being given free access in experiments.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.worldcampaign.net/forum/view.php?id=1707 | author = Helen Puttick | title = Hope in fight against alcoholism | date = 2006-12-26 | publisher = [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] }}</ref><ref name="pmid16751790">{{cite journal | author = Lawrence AJ, Cowen MS, Yang HJ, Chen F, Oldfield B | title = The orexin system regulates alcohol-seeking in rats | journal = Br.

A study has reported that transplantation of orexin neurons into the pontine reticular formation in rats is feasible, indicating the development of alternative therapeutic strategies in addition to pharmacological interventions to treat narcolepsy.<ref name="pmid15683135">{{cite journal | author = Arias-Carrión O, Murillo-Rodriguez E, Xu M, Blanco-Centurion C, Drucker-Colín R, Shiromani PJ | title = Transplantation of Hypocretin Neurons into the Pontine Reticular Formation: Preliminary Results | journal = Sleep | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 1465–70 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15683135 | doi = | url = http://www.journalsleep.org/Articles/270802.pdf | format = | pmc = 1201562 }}</ref>

Because orexin-A receptors have been shown to regulate relapse to cocaine seeking, a new study investigated its relation to nicotine by studying rats. By blocking the orexin-A receptor with low doses of the selective antagonist [[SB-334,867]], nicotine [[self-administration]] decreased and also the motivation to seek and obtain the drug. The study showed that blocking of receptors in the [[Insular cortex|insula]] decreased [[self-administration]], but not blocking of receptors in the adjacent [[somatosensory cortex]]. The greatest decrease in self-administration was found when blocking all orexin-A receptors in the brain as a whole. A rationale for this study was the fact that the insula has been implicated in regulating feelings of craving. The insula contains orexin-A receptors. It has been reported that smokers who sustained damage to the insula lost the desire to smoke.<ref name="urlBlocking A Neuropeptide Receptor Decreases Nicotine Addiction">{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081124174851.htm | title = Blocking A Neuropeptide Receptor Decreases Nicotine Addiction | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2008-12-01 | work = | publisher = ScienceDaily LLC | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-02-11}}</ref>

=== Lipid metabolism ===
Orexin-A (OXA) has been recently demonstrated to have direct effect on a part of the [[lipid]] metabolism. OXA stimulates [[glucose]] uptake in 3T3-L1 [[adipocytes]] and that increased energy uptake is stored as lipids ([[triacylglycerol]]). OXA thus increases [[lipogenesis]]. It also inhibits [[lipolysis]] and stimulates the secretion of [[adiponectin]]. These effects are thought to be mostly conferred via the [[PI3K]] pathway because this pathway inhibitor (LY294002) completely blocks OXA effects in adipocytes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Orexin A stimulates glucose uptake, lipid accumulation and adiponectin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and isolated primary rat adipocytes|journal=[[Diabetologia]]|date=2011 Jul|volume=5|issue=47| pages=1841–52|pmid = 21505958|author=Skrzypski M, T Le T, Kaczmarek P, Pruszynska-Oszmalek E, Pietrzak P, Szczepankiewicz D, Kolodziejski PA, Sassek M, Arafat A, Wiedenmann B, Nowak KW, Strowski MZ|doi=10.1007/s00125-011-2152-2}}</ref> The link between OXA and the lipid metabolism is new and currently under more research.

=== Mood ===
High levels of orexin-A have been associated with happiness in human subjects, while low levels have been associated with sadness.<ref name="happiness">{{cite journal | author = Ashley M. Blouin, Itzhak Fried, Charles L. Wilson, Richard J. Staba, Eric J. Behnke, Hoa A. Lam, Nigel T. Maidment, Karl Æ. Karlsson, Jennifer L. Lapierre, Jerome M.

Likewise, it helps explain the incidence of depression associated with narcolepsy.

== History and nomenclature ==
In 1996, Gautvik, de Lecea, and colleagues reported the discovery of several genes in the rat brain, including one they dubbed "clone 35." Their work showed that clone 35 expression was limited to the lateral hypothalamus.<ref name="pmid8710940">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.16.8733 | author = Gautvik KM, de Lecea L, et. al. | title = Overview of the most prevalent hypothalamus-specific mRNAs, as identified by directional tag PCR subtraction | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 16 | pages = 8733–8738 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8710940 | pmc = 38742 }}</ref>

[[Masashi Yanagisawa]] and colleagues at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]], coined the term ''orexin'' to reflect the orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) activity of these hormones. In their 1998 paper (with authorship attributed to Sakurai and colleagues) describing these neuropeptides, they also reported discovery of two orexin receptors, dubbed OX<sub>1</sub>R and OX<sub>2</sub>R.<ref name="pmid9491897"/>

Luis de Lecea, [[Thomas Kilduff]], and colleagues also reported discovery of these same peptides, dubbing them ''hypocretins'' to indicate that they are synthesized in the [[hypothalamus]] and to reflect their structural similarity to the hormone [[secretin]] (i.e., ''hypo''thalamic se''cretin''). This is the same group that first identified clone 35 two years earlier.<ref name="pmid9419374"/><ref name="pmid8710940"/>

The name of this family of peptides is currently an unsettled issue. The name "orexin" has been rejected by some due to evidence that the orexigenic effects of these peptides may be incidental or trivial (i.e., orexin induced subjects eat more because they are awake more), though this issue is also unsettled, while other groups maintain that the name "hypocretin" is awkward, pointing out that many neuropeptides have names that are unrelated to their most important functions, and that waking is one of the important factors that supports feeding behavior.  Both "orexin" and "hypocretin" will likely continue to appear in published works until a preferred name has been accepted by the scientific community.

Orexins act on [[Gq alpha subunit|Gq-protein]]-coupled receptors signaling through [[phospholipase C]] (PLC) and calcium-dependent as well as calcium-independent transduction pathways. These include activation of electrogenic [[sodium-calcium exchanger]]s (NCX) and a non-specific cationic conductance, likely channels of the [[TRPC|transient receptor potential canonical]]-(TRPC) type activation of [[L-type calcium channel|L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels]], closure of [[G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel|G-protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channels]] (GIRK), and activation of protein kinases, including [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), [[protein kinase A]] (PKA), and mitogen-associated protein kinase, also called [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAPK). Postsynaptic actions of orexins on their numerous neuronal targets throughout the CNS are almost entirely excitatory.<ref name="pmid16687280">{{cite journal | author = Selbach O, Haas HL | title = Hypocretins: the timing of sleep and waking | journal = Chronobiology International | volume = 23 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 63–70 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16687280 | doi = 10.1080/07420520500545961 | url =  }}</ref>
