The '''Hypoxic Training index''' (HTi) provides an objective measure of the hypoxic stress delivered during the [[Intermittent Hypoxic Training]] (IHT) session, compared to simple recording the inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2).  HTi provides a figure (index) of dosage received by the individual at the end of the session.<ref>{{Cite book|first=O |last=Bassovitch |coauthors=Serebrovskaya, TV |chapter=Equipment and Regimes for Intermittent Hypoxia Therapy |year=2009 |editors=Lei Xi and Tatiana V.

Tissue hypoxia develops only when arterial oxygen saturation ([[SpO2]]) drops to 90% or below. This is due to the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve. Saturations above 90% produce very little effect or decrease of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2). In order to obtain consistent and comparable values of HTi for different individuals the following conditions should be stipulated:
* The values of SpO2 above 89% are not considered in the calculation of HTi, as such saturation levels do not contribute to the treatment. [[SpO2]] values below 75% count as 75%.
* HTi is calculated as an integral value of [[SpO2]] readings made with 1 s sampling frequency and divided by 60 in order to produce a “per minute” value.
* During the treatment target [[SpO2]] values are in the range of 75% - 89%.

==Calculation==
The resulting formula for calculating HTi is:

<math>HTi = \frac {1}{60} \int\limits_{0}^t [90-SpO_2(t)] dt</math>

where: <br>
'''HTi ''': Hypoxic Training index,<br>
'''t''' : period of time, and <br>
'''SpO2 (t)''' :  SpO2 (%), arterial oxygen saturation value measured at one-second intervals.

[[File:HTi Graph.png|thumb|400px|How the HTi is calculated:  Only part of the IHT session is shown, the targeted [[SpO2]] value is 80% as an example. The filled part of the [[SpO2]] graph represents the amount of hypoxia delivered, “dosage”.]]

This image shows a typical [[SpO2]] curve during a full biofeedback-controlled IHT session.  (FiO2 is altered automatically using biofeedback controlled [[hypoxicator]] to attain and sustain the desired SpO2 target value.)

==Software to calculate Hypoxic Training Index==
Advanced [[biofeedback controlled hypoxicator]]s are capable of adjusting the oxygen concentration in the inhaled hypoxic air automatically.  This automatic biofeedback control allows targeting of the desired [[SpO2]], compensating for individual variability. Software is also available<ref>http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Hypoxic_Timer Software to calculate HTi from a pulse oximeter</ref> to calculate HTi based on readings from a USB connected [[Pulse oximetry|Pulse Oximeter]].
