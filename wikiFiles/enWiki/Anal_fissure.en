An '''anal fissure''' is a break or tear in the skin of the [[anal canal]]. Anal fissures may be noticed by bright red anal bleeding on toilet paper, sometimes in the toilet.  If acute they may cause [[Rectal pain|pain]] after defecation <ref name="new">{{cite news|last=Gott|first=M. D.|coauthors=Peter, H.|date=5 March 1998|work=[[The Fresno Bee]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Co]]|location=[[Fresno, CA]]|title=New Therapy Coming for Anal Fissures|at=p. E2, "Life" section}}</ref> but with chronic fissures pain intensity is often less. Anal fissures usually extend from the anal opening and are usually located posteriorly in the midline, probably because of the relatively unsupported nature and poor perfusion of the anal wall in that location. Fissure depth may be superficial or sometimes down to the underlying sphincter muscle.

== Causes ==

Most anal fissures are caused by stretching of the anal [[mucosa]] beyond its capability.

Superficial or shallow anal fissures look much like a paper cut, and may be hard to detect upon visual inspection, they will generally self-heal within a couple of weeks.  However, some anal fissures become chronic and deep and will not heal. The most common cause of non-healing is [[spasm]]ing of the internal [[anal sphincter]] muscle which results in impaired blood supply to the anal mucosa. The result is a non-healing ulcer, which may become infected by [[coliform|fecal bacteria]].
In adults, fissures may be caused by constipation, the passing of large, hard stools, or by prolonged diarrhea. In older adults, anal fissures may be caused by decreased blood flow to the area. When fissures are found laterally, tuberculosis, occult abscesses, leukemic infiltrates, carcinoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or inflammatory bowel disease should be considered as causes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Anorectal Conditions| url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/0701/p77.html| publisher = American Academy of Family Physicians}}</ref> Some [[sexually transmitted infection]]s can promote the breakdown of tissue resulting in a fissure. Examples of sexually transmitted infections that may affect the anorectal area are [[syphilis]], [[herpes]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[human papilloma virus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Anal Fissure - Causes| url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anal-fissure/Pages/Causes.aspx| publisher = NHS Choices}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
The incidence of anal fissures is around 1 in 350 adults.<ref name=BMJ_epi /> They occur equally commonly in men and women and most often occur in young adults aged 15 to 40. <ref name=BMJ_epi />

== Prevention ==

For adults, the following may help prevent anal fissures:

* Avoiding straining when defecating.  This includes treating and preventing [[constipation]] by eating food rich in [[dietary fiber]], drinking enough water, occasional use of a [[stool softener]], and avoiding constipating agents.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basson|first=Marc D.|url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/184704-overview |title=Constipation |work=eMedicine|date=28 January 2010|publisher=[[WebMD]]|location=[[New York, NY]]|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> Similarly, prompt treatment of diarrhea may reduce anal strain.
* Careful anal hygiene after defecation, including using soft toilet paper and/or cleaning with water.
* In cases of pre-existing or suspected fissure, use of a lubricating ointment (It is important to note that [[hemorrhoid]] ointment is contraindicated because it constricts small blood vessels, thus causes a decrease in blood flow, which prevents healing.)

In [[infant]]s, frequent [[diaper]] change can prevent anal fissure.  As constipation can be a cause, making sure the infant is drinking enough fluids (i.e. breastmilk, proper ratios when mixing formulas). In infants, once an anal fissure has occurred, addressing underlying causes is usually enough to ensure healing occurs.

== Treatment ==
Non-surgical treatments are recommended initially for acute and chronic anal fissures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nelson RL, Thomas K, Morgan J, Jones A |title=Non surgical therapy for anal fissure |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= |pages=CD003431 |year=2012 |pmid=22336789 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003431.pub3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Haq. |first=Z. |coauthors=Rahman, M.; Chowdhury, R.; Baten, M.; Khatun, M. |title=Chemical Sphincterotomy—First Line of Treatment for Chronic Anal Fissure |journal=Mymensingh Medical Journal |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=88–90 |year=2005 |pmid=15695964}}</ref> These include topical [[nitroglycerin]] or [[calcium channel blockers]], or injection of [[botulinum toxin]] into the anal sphincter.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shao|first=WJ|coauthors=Li, GC, Zhang, ZK|title=Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing botulinum toxin injection with lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure|journal=International journal of colorectal disease|date=2009 Sep|volume=24|issue=9|pages=995–1000|pmid=19266207|doi=10.1007/s00384-009-0683-5}}</ref>

Other measures include warm [[sitz bath]]s, topical anesthetics, high-fiber diet and stool softeners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anal Fissure - Treatment Overview|url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/tc/anal-fissure-treatment-overview|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Poritz|first=Lisa Susan|title=Anal Fissure Treatment & Management|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/196297-treatment|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref>

=== Medication ===

Local application of medications to relax the sphincter muscle, thus allowing the healing to proceed, was first proposed in 1994 with [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerine]] ointment,<ref>{{cite journal |last==Loder |first=P. |coauthors=Kamm, M.; Nicholls, R.; Phillips, R. |title='Reversible Chemical Sphincterotomy' by Local Application of Glyceryl Trinitrate |journal=British Journal of Surgery |volume=81 |issue=9 |pages=1386–1389 |year=1994 |pmid=7953427 |doi=10.1002/bjs.1800810949}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=S. |coauthors=Kamm, M.; Nicholls, R.; Phillips, R. |title=Topical Glyceryl Trinitrate in the Treatment of Chronic Anal Fissure |journal=British Journal of Surgery |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=771–775 |year=1996 |pmid=8696736 |doi=10.1002/bjs.1800830614}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=J. |coauthors=Lund, J.; Thompson, R.; Kapila, L.; Scholefield, J. |title=The Use of Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN) in the Treatment of Chronic Anal Fissure in Children |journal=Medical Science Monitor |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=PI123–126 |year=2003 |pmid=14523338|url= http://www.medscimonit.com/index.php?/archives/article/13258}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lund |first=J.

and then [[calcium channel blockers]] in 1999 with [[nifedipine]] ointment,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Antropoli |first=C. |coauthors=Perrotti, P.; Rubino, M.; Martino, A.; De Stefano, G.; Migliore, G.; Antropoli, M.; Piazza, P. |title=Nifedipine for Local Use in Conservative Treatment of Anal Fissures: Preliminary Results of a Multicenter Study |journal=Diseases of the Colon and Rectum |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=1011–1015 |year=1999 |pmid=10458123 |doi=10.1007/BF02236693}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Katsinelos |first=P. |coauthors=Kountouras, J.; Paroutoglou, G.; Beltsis, A.; Chatzimavroudis, G.; Zavos, C.; Katsinelos, T.; Papaziogas, B. |title=Aggressive Treatment of Acute Anal Fissure with 0.5% Nifedipine Ointment Prevents Its Evolution to Chronicity |journal=World Journal of Gastroenteroloogy |volume=12 |issue=38 |pages=6203–6206 |year=2006 |pmid=17036396 |url= http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/12/6203.asp |accessdate=12 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090512161942/http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/12/6203.asp| archivedate= 12 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
and the following year with topical [[diltiazem]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Carapeti |first=E. |coauthors=Kamm, M.; Phillips, R. |title=Topical Diltiazem and Bethanechol Decrease Anal Sphincter Pressure and Heal Anal Fissures without Side Effects |journal=Diseases of the Colon and Rectum |volume=43 |issue=10 |pages=1359–1362 |year=2000 |pmid=11052511 |doi=10.1007/BF02236630}}</ref>
Branded preparations are now available of topical nitroglycerine ointment (Rectogesic (Rectiv) as 0.2% in Australia and 0.4% in UK and US<ref>{{cite web|title=Rectiv|url=http://www.drugs.com/rectiv.html|publisher=drugs.com|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref>), topical nifedipine 0.3% with lidocaine 1.5% ointment (Antrolin in Italy since April 2004) and diltiazem 2% (Anoheal in UK, although still in Phase III development).  A common side effect drawback of nitroglycerine ointment is headache, caused by systemic absorption of the drug, which limits patient acceptability.

A combined surgical and pharmacological treatment, administered by colorectal surgeons, is direct injection of [[botulinum toxin]] (Botox) into the anal sphincter to relax it.  This treatment was first investigated in 1993. However, in many cases involving Botox injections the patients eventually had to choose another cure as the injections proved less and less potent, spending thousands of dollars in the meantime for a partial cure.  Lateral sphincterotomy is the [[Gold Standard#Gold standard in medicine|Gold Standard]] for curing this affliction.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jost |first=W. |coauthors=Schimrigk, K. |title=Use of Botulinum Toxin in Anal Fissure |journal=Diseases of the Colon and Rectum |volume=36 |issue=10 |page=974 |year=1993 |pmid=8404394 |doi=10.1007/BF02050639}}</ref>

=== Surgery ===

Surgical procedures are generally reserved for people with anal fissure who have tried medical therapy for at least one to three months and have not healed. It is not the first option in treatment.

The main concern with surgery is the development of anal incontinence. Anal incontinence can include inability to control gas, mild fecal soiling, or loss of solid stool. Some degree of incontinence can occur in up to 45 percent of patients in the immediate surgical recovery period. However, incontinence is rarely permanent and is usually mild. The risk should be discussed with one's surgeon.

Surgical treatment, under general anaesthesia, was either anal stretch (Lord's operation) or [[Lateral internal sphincterotomy|lateral sphincterotomy]] where the internal anal sphincter muscle is incised.  Both operations aim to decrease sphincter spasming and thereby restore normal blood supply to the anal mucosa.  Surgical operations involve a [[general anaesthetic]] and can be painful postoperatively.  Anal stretch is also associated with anal incontinence in a small proportion of cases and thus sphincterotomy is the operation of choice.

==== Lateral internal sphincterotomy ====

Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is the surgical procedure of choice for anal fissures due to its simplicity and its high success rate (~95%). In this procedure the internal anal sphincter is partially divided in order to reduce spasming and thus improve the blood supply to the perianal area. This improvement in the blood supply helps to heal the fissure, and the weakening of the sphincter is also believed to reduce the potential for recurrence. The procedure is generally performed as a day surgery after the patient is given general anesthesia. The pain from the sphincterotomy is usually mild and is often less than the pain of the fissure itself. Patients often return to normal activity within one week.

LIS does, however, have a number of potential side effects including problems with incision site healing and incontinence to [[flatus]] and faeces (some surveys of surgical results suggest incontinence rates of up to 36%).<ref>{{cite book |last=Wolff |first=B.

==== Anal dilation ====

Anal dilation, or stretching of the anal canal (Lord's operation) has fallen out of favour in recent years, primarily due to the unacceptably high incidence of [[fecal incontinence]].{{Citation needed|reason=Previous reference, Freeman, Cameron, Grimard, removed since it did not apply, see talk page.|date=January 2012}}
In addition, anal stretching can increase the rate of [[fecal incontinence#Anal incontinence (flatus/gas incontinence)|flatus incontinence]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sadovsky |first=R. |title=Diagnosis and management of patients with anal fissures - Tips from Other Journals |journal=American Family Physician |year=2003 |month=1 April |volume=67 | issue=7 |page=1608 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3225/is_7_67/ai_99410474  |format=Reprint |accessdate=2009-05-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080209180657/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3225/is_7_67/ai_99410474 |archivedate = 2008-02-09}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, however, a repeatable method of anal dilation proved to be very effective and showed a very low incidence of side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sohn |first=M. |coauthors=Weinstein, M.
