'''Adenocarcinoma of the [[lung]]''' is a common histological form of [[lung cancer]] that contains certain distinct malignant tissue architectural, cytological, or molecular features, including gland and/or duct formation and/or production of significant amounts of mucus.<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
 
Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of [[lung cancer]] in lifelong non-smokers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Subramanian J, Govindan R |title=Lung cancer in never smokers: a review |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=561–70 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17290066 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8015 |url=}}</ref> Its incidence has been increasing in many developed Western nations in the past few decades, where it has become the most common major type of lung cancer in smokers (replacing [[Squamous_cell_lung_carcinoma#Squamous_cell_lung_carcinoma|squamous cell lung carcinoma]]) and in lifelong nonsmokers.<ref name='who2004'/> According to the [[Nurses' Health Study]], the risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung increases substantially after a long duration of previous [[tobacco smoking]], with a previous smoking duration of 30 to 40 years giving a [[relative risk]] of approximately 2.4 compared to never-smokers, and a duration of more than 40 years giving a relative risk of approximately 5.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1136/tc.2007.022582}}</ref>

Adenocarcinomas account for approximately 40% of lung cancers.<ref name=Travis95>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, Travis LB, Devesa SS |title=Lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=191–202 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=8000996 |doi= 10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y|url=}}</ref>

This cancer usually is seen peripherally in the lungs, as opposed to [[small cell lung cancer]] and [[squamous cell]] lung cancer, which both tend to be more centrally located,<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma>{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 13, box on morphology of adenocarcinoma |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |edition=8th}}</ref><ref name=Travis95/> although it may also occur as central lesions.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> By unknown reasons, it often arises in relation to peripheral lung scars. The current theory is that the scar probably occurred secondary to the tumor, rather than causing the tumor.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> The adenocarcinoma has an increased incidence in smokers, and is the most common type of lung cancer seen in non-smokers and women.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> The peripheral location of adenocarcinoma in the lungs is due to the use of filters in cigarettes which prevent the larger particles from entering the lung.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}<ref>Goljan USMLE Audio Tapes, 2001</ref> Generally, adenocarcinomas grow more slowly and form smaller masses than the other subtypes.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> However, they tend to form [[metastase]]s widely at an early stage.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> Adenocarcinoma is a [[non-small cell lung carcinoma]], and as such, it is not as responsive to [[radiation therapy]] as is [[small cell lung carcinoma]], but is rather treated surgically, for example by [[pneumonectomy]] or [[lobectomy]].<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/>

===Histopathology===

Adenocarcinomas are highly heterogeneous tumors, and several major histological subtypes are currently recognized:<ref name="who2004"/>

*[[Acinar adenocarcinoma]]
*[[Papillary adenocarcinoma]]
*[[Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma|Bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma]]
*[[Solid adenocarcinoma]] with mucin production

In as many as 80% of tumors that are extensively sampled, components of more than one of these subtypes will be recognized. In such cases, the tumors should be classified as a fifth "subtype", namely "adenocarcinoma, mixed subtypes".<ref name='who2004'/>

Adenocarcinoma of the lung tends to stain mucin positive as it is derived from the mucus producing glands of the lungs.  Similar to other adenocarcinoma, if this tumor is well differentiated (low grade) it will resemble the normal glandular structure. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma will not resemble the normal glands (high grade) and will be detected by seeing that they stain positive for mucin (which the glands produce).<ref>[http://radiology.uchc.edu/eAtlas/nav/msLung.htm Diseases of Lung<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://radiology.uchc.edu/eAtlas/RESP/1624b.htm Adenocarcinoma of Lung (Mucin Stain)]</ref> 

To reveal the adenocarcinomatous lineage of the solid variant, demonstration of intracellular mucin production may be performed. Foci of squamous metaplasia and dysplasia may be present in the epithelium proximal to adenocarcinomas, but these are not the precursor lesions for this tumor. Rather, the precursor of peripheral adenocarcinomas has been termed ''atypical adenomatous hyperplasia'' (AAH).<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> Microscopically, AAH is a well-demarcated focus of epithelial proliferation, containing cuboidal to low-columnar cells resembling [[Clara cells]] or [[type II pneumocyte]]s.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> These demonstrate various degrees of cytologic atypia, including [[hyperchromasia]], [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphism]], prominent [[nucleoli]].<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> However, the atypia is not to the extent as seen in frank adenocarcinomas.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/> Lesions of AAH are monoclonal, and they share many of the molecular aberrations (like [[KRAS]] mutations) that are associated with adenocarcinomas.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma/>
