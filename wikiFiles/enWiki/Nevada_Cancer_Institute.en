A non-profit organization, NVCI serves patients throughout the greater Las Vegas area, offering full-service clinics in [[Summerlin, Nevada]], and at University Medical Center, in the downtown medical district. The Institute’s mobile screening unit, the Hope Coach, has provided mammography services throughout the state.

NVCI has served more than 17,000 patients since opening in 2005. The Institute is dedicated to providing innovative and collaborative cancer care, clinical trials and community education.

The Institute also provides assistance to help patients find the information and non-medical resources they need to support themselves during treatment - including support groups, an on-site meditation room, yoga and other activities.
