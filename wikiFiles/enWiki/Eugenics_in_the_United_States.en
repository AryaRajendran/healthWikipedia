A hallmark of the [[Progressive Era]] of the late 19th and early 20th century, now generally associated with racist and [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] elements (as the movement was to some extent a reaction to a change in emigration from Europe) rather than scientific [[genetics]], eugenics was considered a method of preserving and improving the dominant groups in the population.

==History==
===Early proponents===

[[File:Eugenics supporters hold signs on Wall Street.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Eugenics supporters hold signs criticizing various "genetically inferior" groups. [[Wall Street]], New York, c. 1915.]]
The American eugenics movement was rooted in the biological determinist ideas of [[Sir Francis Galton]], which originated in the 1880s. Galton studied the upper classes of Britain, and arrived at the conclusion that their social positions were due to a superior genetic makeup.<ref name="Selden-2005-202">Selden, 2005:  p. 202</ref> Early proponents of eugenics believed that, through selective breeding, the human species should direct its own evolution. They tended to believe in the genetic superiority of Nordic, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon peoples; supported strict immigration and [[anti-miscegenation laws]]; and supported the forcible sterilization of the poor, disabled and "immoral".<ref>Ordover, 2003: [http://books.google.com/books?id=5qHGELC_h-4C&pg=PR12 p. xii]</ref>

The American eugenics movement received extensive funding from various corporate foundations including the [[Carnegie Institution]], [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Edward Henry Harriman|Harriman]] railroad fortune.<ref name="black-2003-1">Black, 2003: [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL p. 1]</ref> In 1906 [[J.H. Kellogg]] provided funding to help found the Race Betterment Foundation in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]].<ref name="Selden-2005-202" /> The [[Eugenics Record Office]] (ERO) was founded in [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York]] in 1911 by the renowned biologist [[Charles B. Davenport]], using money from both the Harriman railroad fortune and the Carnegie Institution. As late as the 1920s, the ERO was one of the leading organizations in the American eugenics movement.<ref name="Selden-2005-202" /><ref>Bender, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=qpFA2Ea-rdkC&pg=PA192 p. 192]</ref> In years to come, the ERO collected a mass of family pedigrees and concluded that those who were unfit came from economically and socially poor backgrounds. Eugenicists such as Davenport, the [[psychology|psychologist]] [[Henry H. Goddard]], [[Harry H. Laughlin]], and the conservationist [[Madison Grant]] (all well respected in their time) began to lobby for various solutions to the problem of the "unfit". Davenport favored [[History of immigration to the United States|immigration restriction]] and sterilization as primary methods; Goddard favored segregation in his ''[[The Kallikak Family]]''; Grant favored all of the above and more, even entertaining the idea of extermination.<ref>Kevles, 1986: p. 133-135</ref> The Eugenics Record Office later became the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].

Eugenics was widely accepted in the U.S. academic community.<ref name="black-2003-1" /> By 1928 there were 376 separate university courses in some of the United States' leading schools, enrolling more than 20,000 students, which included eugenics in the curriculum.<ref>Selden, 2005: p. 204</ref> It did, however, have scientific detractors (notably, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], one of the few [[Mendelians]] to explicitly criticize eugenics), though most of these focused more on what they considered the crude methodology of eugenicists, and the characterization of almost every human characteristic as being hereditary, rather than the idea of eugenics itself.<ref>Hamilton Cravens, ''The triumph of evolution: American scientists and the heredity-environment controversy, 1900–1941'' (Philadelphia: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 1978): 179.</ref>

By 1910, there was a large and dynamic network of scientists, reformers and professionals engaged in national eugenics projects and actively promoting eugenic legislation. The [[American Breeder’s Association]] was the first eugenic body in the U.S., established in 1906 under the direction of biologist Charles B. Davenport. The ABA was formed specifically to “investigate and report on heredity in the human race, and emphasize the value of superior blood and the menace to society of inferior blood.” Membership included [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Stanford]] president [[David Starr Jordan]] and [[Luther Burbank]].<ref>Stern, 2005: pp. 82–91</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=EoiTjLH3BqIC&pg=PA193&dq=American+Breeder%E2%80%99s+Association+alexander+Graham+Bell#v=onepage&q=American%20Breeder%E2%80%99s%20Association%20alexander%20Graham%20Bell&f=false | title=The unfit: a history of a bad idea | accessdate=July 14, 2011 | author=[[Elof Axel Carlson]] | page=193 | isbn=9780879695873 | year=2001}}</ref> The [[American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality]] was one of the first organizations to begin investigating infant mortality rates in terms of eugenics.<ref name="Selden">Selden, 2005: p. 206</ref> They promoted government intervention in attempts to promote the health of future citizens.<ref>Cameron, M.

Several feminist reformers advocated an agenda of eugenic legal reform. The National Federation of Women’s Clubs, the [[Woman’s Christian Temperance Union]], and the [[National League of Women Voters]] were among the variety of state and local feminist organization that at some point lobbied for eugenic reforms.<ref name=Ziegler>{{cite journal|last=Ziegler|first=Mary|title=Eugenic Feminism: Mental Hygiene, The Women's Movement, And The Campaign For Eugenic Legal Reform, 1900-1935|journal=Harvard Journal of Law & Gender|year=2008|volume=31|issue=1|pages=211–236}}</ref>

One of the most prominent feminists to champion the eugenic agenda was [[Margaret Sanger]], the leader of the American [[birth control]] movement. [[Margaret Sanger]] saw birth control as a means to prevent unwanted children from being born into a disadvantaged life, and incorporated the language of eugenics to advance the movement.<ref name=nyu>[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.html "The Sanger-Hitler Equation"], ''[[Margaret Sanger Papers Project]] Newsletter'', #32, Winter 2002/3.

In the [[Deep South]], women’s associations played an important role in rallying support for eugenic legal reform. Eugenicists recognized the political and social influence of southern clubwomen in their communities, and used them to help implement eugenics across the region.<ref name=Larson>{{cite book|last=Larson|first=Edward J.|title=Sex, Race, and Science: Eugenics in the Deep South|year=1995|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=74}}</ref>   Between 1915 ad 1920, federated women’s clubs in every state of the [[Deep South]] had a critical role in establishing public eugenic institutions that were segregated by sex.<ref name=Larson-p75>{{cite book|last=Larson|first=Edward J.|title=Sex, Race, and Science: Eugenics in the Deep South|year=1995|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=75}}</ref>  For example, the Legislative Committee of the Florida State Federation of Women’s Clubs successfully lobbied to institute a eugenic institution for the mentally retarded that was segregated by sex.<ref name="Kluchin"/>  Their aim was to separate mentally retarded men and women to prevent them from breeding more “feebleminded” individuals.

Public acceptance in the U.S. was the reason eugenic legislation was passed.
Almost 19 million people attended the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] in San Francisco, open for 10 months from February 20 to December 4, 1915.<ref name="ReferenceA">Stern, 2005: {{page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.americanhistory.si.edu/osaycanyousee/2011/02/1915-san-francisco-panama-pacific-international-exposition-in-color.html| title=1915 San Francisco Panama-Pacific International Exposition: In color! | publisher=National Museum American History | date=February 11, 2011 | accessdate=July 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shaughey.com/PPIE.htm | title=The Panama Pacific Exposition | accessdate=July 14, 2011}}</ref> The PPIE was a fair devoted to extolling the virtues of a rapidly progressing nation, featuring new developments in science, agriculture, manufacturing and technology. A subject that received a large amount of time and space was that of the developments concerning health and disease, particularly the areas of tropical medicine and race betterment (tropical medicine being the combined study of [[bacteriology]], [[parasitology]] and [[entomology]] while racial betterment being the promotion of eugenic studies). Having these areas so closely intertwined, it seemed that they were both categorized in the main theme of the fair, the advancement of civilization. Thus in the public eye, the seemingly contradictory{{clarify|date=January 2011}} areas of study were both represented under progressive banners of improvement and were made to seem like plausible courses of action to better American society.<ref>Stern, 2005: pp. 27–31</ref>{{Verify source|date=December 2010}}

Beginning with [[Connecticut]] in 1896, many states enacted marriage laws with eugenic criteria, prohibiting anyone who was "epileptic, [[imbecile]] or [[feeble-minded]]"<ref>{{Cite journal | publisher = American Medical Association.  | journal = JAMA.: the Journal of the American Medical Association | date = June 6, 1896 |page=1138}}</ref> from marrying.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The first state to introduce a compulsory sterilization bill was [[Michigan]], in 1897 but the proposed law failed to garner enough votes by legislators to be adopted. Eight years later [[Pennsylvania]]'s state legislators passed a sterilization bill that was vetoed by the governor. [[Indiana]] became the first state to enact sterilization legislation in 1907,<ref>The Indiana Supreme Court overturned the law in 1921 in ''Williams v. Smith'', 131 NE 2 (Ind.), 1921, text at [http://www.bioethics.iupui.edu/Eugenics/SMith%20vs%20Williams.pdf]</ref> followed closely by [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[California]] in 1909. Sterilization rates across the country were relatively low (California being the sole exception) until the 1927 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' which legitimized the forced sterilization of patients at a [[Virginia]] home for the [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]]. The number of sterilizations performed per year increased until another Supreme Court case, ''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma]]'', 1942, complicated the legal situation by ruling against sterilization of criminals if the equal protection clause of the constitution was violated. That is, if sterilization was to be performed, then it could not exempt [[White-collar crime|white-collar criminals]].<ref>On the legal history of eugenic sterilization in the U.S., see Paul Lombardo, "Eugenic Sterilization Laws", essay in the [http://www.eugenicsarchive.org Eugenics Archive], available online at http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html.</ref> The state of [[California]] was at the vanguard of the American eugenics movement, performing about 20,000 sterilizations or one third of the 60,000 nationwide from 1909 up until the 1960s.<ref name="Stern 84,144">Stern, 2005: [http://books.google.com.co/books?id=MB23Zoyl54UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=eugenic+nation&hl=es&ei=3M0fTuvLL6Lc0QGVp6TgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=60000&f=false pp.84, 144]</ref>

===Immigration restrictions===
[[File:Anthropometry exhibit.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Anthropometry]] demonstrated in an exhibit from a 1921 eugenics conference.]]
The [[Immigration Restriction League]] was the first American entity associated officially with eugenics. Founded in 1894 by three recent Harvard University graduates, the League sought to bar what it considered inferior races from entering America and diluting what it saw as the superior American racial stock (upper class Northerners of Anglo-Saxon heritage). They felt that social and sexual involvement with these less-evolved and less-civilized races would pose a biological threat to the American population. The League lobbied for a literacy test for immigrants, based on the belief that literacy rates were low among "inferior races". Literacy test bills were vetoed by Presidents in 1897, 1913 and 1915; eventually, President Wilson's second veto was overruled by Congress in 1917. Membership in the League included: [[A. Lawrence Lowell]], president of Harvard, [[William DeWitt Hyde]], president of [[Bowdoin College]], [[James T. Young]], director of [[Wharton School]] and [[David Starr Jordan]], president of [[Stanford University]].<ref>McWhorter, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=EC5pdKPXIG0C&pg=PA204 p. 204]</ref>

The League allied themselves with the [[American Breeder’s Association]] to gain influence and further its goals and in 1909 established a Committee on Eugenics chaired by David Starr Jordan with members Charles Davenport, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Vernon Kellogg]], [[Luther Burbank]], [[William Earnest Castle]], [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]], [[H. J. Webber]] and [[Friedrich Woods]]. The ABA's immigration legislation committee, formed in 1911 and headed by League’s founder Prescott F. Hall, formalized the committee’s already strong relationship with the Immigration Restriction League. They also founded the Eugenics Record Office, which was headed by Harry H. Laughlin.<ref name="McWhorter-2009-205">McWhorter, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=EC5pdKPXIG0C&pg=PA205 p. 205]</ref> In their mission statement, they wrote:
{{blockquote|Society must protect itself; as it claims the right to deprive the murderer of his life so it may also annihilate the hideous serpent of hopelessly vicious protoplasm. Here is where appropriate legislation will aid in eugenics and creating a healthier, saner society in the future."<ref name="McWhorter-2009-205" />}}

Money from the Harriman railroad fortune was also given to local charities, in order to find immigrants from specific ethnic groups and deport, confine, or forcibly sterilize them.<ref name="black-2003-1" />

With the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], eugenicists for the first time played an important role in the Congressional debate as expert advisers on the threat of "inferior stock" from eastern and southern Europe.<ref>{{cite book  | author=Watson, James D.|coauthors=Berry, Andrew

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] asserted that restrictions on [[immigration]] passed in the United States during the 1920s (and overhauled in 1965 with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]]) were motivated by the goals of eugenics. During the early 20th century, the United States and Canada began to receive far higher numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. Influential eugenicists like [[Lothrop Stoddard]] and [[Harry Laughlin]] (who was appointed as an expert witness for the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization in 1920) presented arguments they would pollute the national gene pool if their numbers went unrestricted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It has been argued that this stirred both Canada and the United States into passing laws creating a hierarchy of nationalities, rating them from the most desirable [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Nordic race|Nordic]] peoples to the Chinese and Japanese immigrants, who were almost completely banned from entering the country.<ref name="lombardo-immig-laws" /><ref>Gould, Stephen J. (1981) ''The mismeasure of man''. Norton: {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref>

===Unfit vs. Fit Individuals===

Both class and race factored in to eugenic definitions of “fit” and “unfit.” By using intelligence testing, American eugenicists asserted that [[social mobility]] was indicative of one’s genetic fitness.<ref name=Dorr>{{cite book|last=Dorr|first=Gregory|title=Segregation's Science|year=2008|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|page=10}}</ref>  This reaffirmed the existing [[class hierarchy|class]] and [[racial hierarchy|racial hierarchies]] and explained why the upper-to-middle class was predominately white.  Middle-to-upper class status was a marker of “superior strains.”<ref name="Kluchin"/>   In contrast, eugenicists believed poverty to be a characteristic of genetic inferiority, which meant that that those deemed “unfit” were predominately of the lower classes.<ref name=Kluchin>{{cite book|last=Kluchin|first=Rebecca M.|title=Fit to Be Tied: Sterilization and Reproductive Rights in America 1950-1980|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick|pages=17–20}}</ref>

Because class status designated some more fit than others, eugenicists treated upper and lower class women differently. Positive eugenicists, who promoted procreation among the fittest in society, encouraged middle class women to bear more children. Between 1900 and 1960, Eugenicists appealed to middle class white women to become more “family minded,” and to help better the race.<ref name=Kline>{{cite book|last=Kline|first=Wendy|title=Building a Better Race: Gender, Sexuality, and Eugenics From the Turn of the Century to the Baby Boom|year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|page=4}}</ref>   To this end, eugenicists often denied middle and upper class women sterilization and [[birth control]].<ref name=Critchlow>{{cite book|last=Critchlow|first=Donald T.|title=Intended Consequences: Birth Control, Abortion, and the Federal Government in Modern America|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=15}}</ref>

Since poverty was associated with [[prostitution]] and “mental idiocy,” women of the lower classes were the first to be deemed “unfit” and “promiscuous.”<ref name="Kluchin"/>   These women, who were predominately immigrants or women of color, were discouraged from bearing children, and were encouraged to use [[birth control]].

===Compulsory sterilization===

In 1907, Indiana passed the first eugenics-based [[compulsory sterilization]] law in the world. Thirty U.S. states would soon follow their lead.<ref>Lombardo, 2011: [http://books.google.com/books?id=FAB-6RzKAQIC&pg=PR9 p. ix]</ref><ref>Indiana Supreme Court Legal History Lecture Series,

Some states sterilized "imbeciles" for much of the 20th century. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1927 ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' case that the state of [[Virginia]] could sterilize those it thought unfit. Although compulsory sterilization is now considered an abuse of human rights, Buck v.

Men and women were compulsorily sterilized for different reasons.  Men were sterilized to treat their aggression and to eliminate their criminal behavior, while women were sterilized to control the results of their sexuality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kluchin}}</ref>   Since women bore children, eugenicists held women more accountable than men for the reproduction of the less “desirable” members of society.<ref name="Kluchin" />   Eugenicists therefore predominately targeted women in their efforts to regulate the birth rate, to “protect” white racial health, and weed out the “defectives” of society.<ref name="Kluchin" />

A 1937 Fortune magazine poll found that 2/3 of respondents supported eugenic sterilization of "mental defectives", 63% supported sterilization of criminals, and only 15% opposed both.<ref>McWhorter, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=EC5pdKPXIG0C&pg=PA377 p. 377]</ref>

Although the following events were not explicitly justified through the by-now-discredited eugenics movement, they certainly fit the older pattern.  In 1970’s, several activists and women’s rights groups discovered several physicians to be performing coerced sterilizations of specific ethnic groups of society. All were abuses of poor, nonwhite, or mentally retarded women, while no abuses against white or middle-class women were recorded.<ref name=Gordon>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Linda|title=The Moral Property of Women: A History of Birth Control Politics in America|year=2003|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=ISBN 0-252-07459-9.|page=345}}</ref>

For example, in 1972, [[United States Senate]] committee testimony brought to light that at least 2,000 involuntary sterilizations had been performed on poor black women without their consent or knowledge. An investigation revealed that the surgeries were all performed in the South, and were all performed on black welfare mothers with multiple children. Testimony revealed that many of these women were threatened with an end to their welfare benefits until they consented to sterilization.<ref name=Ward>{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Martha C.|title=Poor Women, Powerful Men: America's Great Experiment in Family Planning|year=1986|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder|page=95}}</ref>   These surgeries were instances of sterilization abuse, a term applied to any sterilization performed without the consent or knowledge of the recipient, or in which the recipient is pressured into accepting the surgery. Because the funds used to carry out the surgeries came from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity]], the sterilization abuse raised older suspicions, especially amongst the black community, that  “federal programs were underwriting eugenicists who wanted to impose their views about population quality on minorities and poor women.”<ref name="Kluchin" />

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American women]] were also victims of sterilization abuse up into the 1970s.<ref name=Lawrence>{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Jane|title=he Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=The American Indian Quarterly|year=2000|volume=24|series=3|pages=400–419|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_indian_quarterly/v024/24.3lawrence.html|doi=10.1353/aiq.2000.0008|issue=3}}</ref>  The organization WARN ([[Women of All Red Nations]]) publicized that Native American women were threatened that, if they had more children, they would be denied welfare benefits. The [[Indian Health Service]] also repeatedly refused to deliver Native American babies until their mothers, in labor, consented to sterilization. Many Native American women unknowingly gave consent, since directions were not given in their native language. According to the [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]], an estimate of 3,406 Indian women were sterilized.<ref name=Lawrence>{{cite journal}}</ref>  The [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] stated that the [[Indian Health Service]] had not followed the necessary regulations, and that the “informed consent forms did not adhere to the standards set by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW).”<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johansen|first=Bruce E.|title=Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=Native Americas|year=1998|month=September|url=http://www.ratical.org/ratville/sterilize.html}}</ref>

===Euthanasia programs===

One of the methods that was commonly suggested to get rid of "inferior" populations was [[euthanasia]]. A 1911 [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]] report mentioned euthanasia as one of its recommended "solutions" to the problem of cleansing society of unfit genetic attributes. The most commonly suggested method was to set up local [[gas chambers]]. However, many in the eugenics movement did not believe that Americans were ready to implement a large-scale euthanasia program, so many doctors had to find clever ways of subtly implementing eugenic euthanasia in various medical institutions. For example, a mental institution in [[Lincoln, Illinois]] fed its incoming patients milk infected with [[tuberculosis]] (reasoning that genetically fit individuals would be resistant), resulting in 30-40% annual death rates. Other doctors practiced eugenicide through various forms of lethal neglect.<ref>Black, 2003: [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL&ao=2 p. 2]</ref>

In the 1930s, there was a wave of portrayals of eugenic "mercy killings" in American film, newspapers, and magazines. In 1931, the Illinois [[homeopathy|Homeopathic]] Medicine Association began lobbying for the right to euthanize "imbeciles" and other defectives. The [[Euthanasia Society of America]] was founded in 1938.<ref>Pernick, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=IJJVYrnImOsC&pg=PA161 p. 161]</ref>

Overall, however, euthanasia was marginalized in the U.S., motivating people to turn to forced segregation and sterilization programs as a means for keeping the "unfit" from reproducing.<ref name="black-2003-3">Black, 2003: [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL&ao=3 p. 3]</ref>

===Better Baby Contests===
[[File:Better Baby Contest - 1931 Indiana State Fair.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Contestants get ready for the Better Baby Contest at the 1931 Indiana State Fair.]]
Mary deGormo, a former classroom teacher was the first person to combine ideas about health and intelligence standards with competitions at state fairs, in the form of "better baby" contests. She developed the first such contest, the "Scientific Baby Contest" for the Louisiana State Fair in Shreveport, in 1908. She saw these contests as a contribution to the "social efficiency" movement, which was advocating for the standardization of all aspects of American life as a means of increasing efficiency.<ref name="Selden"/> deGarmo was assisted by the [[pediatrician]] Dr. Jacob Bodenheimer, who helped her develop grading sheets for contestants, which combined physical measurements with standardized measurements of intelligence.<ref>Selden 2005: p. 207</ref> Scoring was based on a deduction system, in that every child started at 1000 points and then was deducted points for having measurements that were below a designated average.  The child with the most points (and the least defections) was ideal.<ref name= "crum">Crnic, Meghan. "Better babies: social engineering for ‘a better nation, a better world’."

The topic of [[standardization]] through scientific judgment was a topic that was very serious in the eyes of the scientific community, but has often been downplayed as just a popular fad or trend. Nevertheless, a lot of time, effort, and money were put into these contests and their scientific backing, which would influence cultural ideas as well as local and state government practices.<ref>Pernick, 2002</ref>{{Verify source|date=December 2010}}

===Fitter Family for Future===
First appearing in 1920 at the Kansas Free Fair, Fitter Family competitions, continued all the way until WWII.  Mary T. Watts and Florence Brown Sherbon, both initiators of the Better Baby Contests in Iowa, took the idea of positive eugenics for babies and combined it with a [[determinist]] concept of [[biology]] to come up with fitter family competitions.<ref>"Fitter Family Contests." Eugenics Archive.  Web. 2 March 2010. [http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=8&search=&matches=].</ref>

There were several different categories that families were judged in: Size of the family, overall attractiveness, and health of the family, all of which helped to determine the likelihood of having healthy children. These competitions were simply a continuation of the Better Baby contests that promoted certain physical and mental qualities.<ref>Boudreau 2005: {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref> At the time, it was believed that certain behavioral qualities were inherited from your parents.  This led to the addition of several judging categories including: [[generosity]], [[self-sacrificing]], and quality of familial bonds.  Additionally, there were negative features that were judged: [[selfishness]], [[jealousy]], suspiciousness, high temperedness, and [[cruelty]]. [[Feeblemindedness]], [[alcoholism]], and [[paralysis]] were few among other traits that were included as physical traits to be judged when looking at family lineage.<ref name="ReferenceA">Selden, 2005: {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref>

Doctors and specialists from the community would offer their time to judge these competitions, which were originally sponsored by the Red Cross.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The winners of these competitions were given a [[Bronze Medal]] as well as champion cups called “Capper Medals.”  The cups were named after then Governor and Senator, [[Arthur Capper]] and he would present them to “Grade A individuals”.<ref>Selden, 2005: p. 211</ref>

The perks of entering into the contests were that the competitions provided a way for families to get a free health check up by a doctor as well as some of the pride and prestige that came from winning the competitions.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

By 1925 the Eugenics Records Office was distributing standardized forms for judging eugenically fit families, which were used in contests in several U.S. states.<ref>Bender, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=qpFA2Ea-rdkC&pg=PA207 p. 207]</ref>

===Influence on Nazi Germany===
{{See also|Nazi eugenics}}
[[File:Wir stehen nicht allein.png|thumb|right|300px|'''Wir stehen nicht allein: "We do not stand alone"'''. Nazi [[propaganda]] poster from 1936, supporting [[Nazi Germany]]'s 1933 [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (their [[compulsory sterilization]] law). The couple is in front of a map of Germany, surrounded by the flags of nations, including the United States, which had enacted (to the left) or were considering (bottom and to the right) similar legislation.]]
After the eugenics movement was well established in the United States, it spread to Germany. California eugenicists began producing literature promoting eugenics and sterilization and sending it overseas to German scientists and medical professionals.<ref name="black-2003-3" /> By 1933, California had subjected more people to forceful sterilization than all other U.S. states combined. The forced sterilization program engineered by the Nazis was partly inspired by California's.<ref name="murphy">Murphy & Lappé, 1994: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1lvbUy441m0C&pg=PA18 p. 18]</ref>

The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] helped develop and fund various German eugenics programs, including the one that [[Josef Mengele]] worked in before he went to [[Auschwitz]].<ref name="black-2003-1" /><ref>Black, 2003: [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL&ao=5 p. 5]</ref>

Upon returning from Germany in 1934, where more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized, the California eugenics leader C. M. Goethe bragged to a colleague:
{{blockquote|"You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind Hitler in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought . . . I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million people."<ref>Black, 2003: [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL&ao=4 p. 4]</ref>}}

Eugenics researcher [[Harry Laughlin|Harry H. Laughlin]] often bragged that his [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|Model Eugenic Sterilization laws]] had been implemented in the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial hygiene laws]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction|year=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3736-8|page=123|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G-crlAYsZ-MC&pg=PA123|author=Jackson, John P. & Weidman, Nadine M.}}</ref> In 1936, Laughlin was invited to an award ceremony at [[Heidelberg University]] in Germany (scheduled on the anniversary of Hitler's 1934 purge of Jews from the Heidelberg faculty), to receive an honorary doctorate for his work on the "science of racial cleansing". Due to financial limitations, Laughlin was unable to attend the ceremony and had to pick it up from the Rockefeller Institute. Afterwards, he proudly shared the award with his colleagues, remarking that he felt that it symbolized the "common understanding of German and American scientists of the nature of eugenics."<ref>Lombardo, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=N_dobTNiDNgC&pg=PA211 pp. 211-213]</ref>

After 1945, however, historians began to attempt to portray the US eugenics movement as distinct and distant from Nazi eugenics.<ref>Kühl 2001: [http://books.google.com/books?id=L8aVReuL0dMC&pg=PR14 p. xiv]</ref>
