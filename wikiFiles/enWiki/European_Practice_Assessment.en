The '''European Practice Assessment''' is a pan-European development for [[quality management]] in primary health care. The scaffolding is a set of indicators, that EPA instrument enables
[[General practice|general practitioners]] to compare and to improve the organisation and management of their practices. It is based on an extended review of the international
literature on assessment models for [[primary care]], with special attention
to the Dutch model of practice visits.

== Aims ==
EPA's key aspects of activity are the development and validation of  
a set of indicators and tools describing the organisational 
aspects of  primary care practices. It was initiated in [http://www.equip.ch/ EQuiP], and the first set of indicators was developed through an international study by the EQuiP countries (2001-2004). Since 2005 it will be evaluated every three years.
The intention of the EPA instrument as a [[Quality Management System|quality management system]] is to allow management and organization of medical practices
to be measured and evaluated at regional, national and international
levels with an educational approach.

== History ==
Based on the TOPAS research project, 
the continuous development of EPA instruments started 2001. In 
autumn 2003 EPA as an instrument came into operation in nine countries.

Within a framework of an [http://fampra.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/137.abstract|international project]  
the idea of an indicator-based instrument 
proved to give internationally valid, reliable and feasible
results for quality improvement in [[primary health care]].  
The following nine countries took part in the study and the further development:  
Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Slovenia, Austria and Israel.

== Practice ==
encouraged several organisations to establish the European Practice Assessment model as an offer
for high quality practice management on a national base.
From six European countries leading institutes with experience in research in quality of primary health
care and practice visits  collaborate in the European Practice Assessment project: 
*Belgium: Flemish Institute of General Practice WWVH, Antwerp
*France: ANAES, Paris
*Germany: [http://www.aqua-institut.de/ AQUA-Institute] on Applied Quality Improvement and Research in Health Care, Göttingen
*Netherlands: Centre for Quality of Care Research [http://www.wokresearch.nl/ WOK], University of Nijmegen/University Maastricht
