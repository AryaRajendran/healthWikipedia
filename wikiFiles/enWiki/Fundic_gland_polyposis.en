'''Fundic gland polyps (a better term than polyposis, as these polyps may be solitary or in small numbers)''' is a medical syndrome where the [[fundus (stomach)|fundus]] of the [[stomach]] develops many [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]].  The condition has been described both in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and attenuated variants (AFAP), and in patients in whom it occurs sporadically.<ref name=Declich>{{cite journal | last1 = Declich | first1 = P | last2 = Tavani | first2 = E | last3 = Ferrara | first3 = A | last4 = Caruso | first4 = S | last5 = Bellone | first5 = S | title = Sporadic fundic gland polyps: clinico-pathologic features and associated diseases | journal = Polish journal of pathology : official journal of the Polish Society of Pathologists | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 131–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16334981 }}</ref>

Most patients with fundic gland polyps (FGPs) do not have any symptoms, and the diagnosis is made on [[gastroscopy]] done for other reasons.  Retrospective analysis of patients with sporadic FGPs shows that a high percentage do have symptoms, but that this is more likely to be related to the underlying disease responsible for the polyposis.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = JM | last2 = McGannon | first2 = E | last3 = Hull-Boiner | first3 = S | last4 = Sivak | first4 = MV | last5 = Van Stolk | first5 = R | last6 = Jagelman | first6 = DG | last7 = Fazio | first7 = VW | last8 = Oakley | first8 = JR | last9 = Lavery | first9 = IC | title = Gastroduodenal polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis | journal = Diseases of the colon and rectum | volume = 35 | issue = 12 | pages = 1170–3 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1335405 | doi = 10.1007/BF02251971 }}</ref>  These symptoms include:

==Epidemiology and disease associations==
Fundic gland polyps are found in 0.8 to 1.9% of patients who undergo [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]], and are more common in middle aged women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weston | first1 = BR | last2 = Helper | first2 = DJ | last3 = Rex | first3 = DK | title = Positive predictive value of endoscopic features deemed typical of gastric fundic gland polyps | journal = Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 399–402 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12702980 | doi = 10.1097/00004836-200305000-00007 }}</ref>  

The most important consideration in evaluating patients with fundic gland polyps is determining whether there is an underlying congenital cause for the condition, or whether the condition was acquired.  This is to ascertain the risk of development of [[gastric cancer]], and to ascertain the risk of concomitant [[colon cancer]].

Fundic gland polyps can be found in association with the following genetic conditions <ref name="Burt"/>:
*[[familial adenomatous polyposis]]
*attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Fundic gland polyp (1).jpg|right|thumb|H&E stain of fundic gland polyp showing shortening of the gastric pits with cystic dilatation]]
The development of polyps depends on the underlying disorder.

In sporadic cases of fundic gland polyps, more than 90% of patients have activating mutations in the β-catenin gene. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Abraham | first1 = SC | last2 = Nobukawa | first2 = B | last3 = Giardiello | first3 = FM | last4 = Hamilton | first4 = SR | last5 = Wu | first5 = TT | title = Sporadic Fundic Gland Polyps : Common Gastric Polyps Arising Through Activating Mutations in the β-Catenin Gene | journal = The American journal of pathology | volume = 158 | issue = 3 | pages = 1005–10 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11238048 | pmc = 1850357 }}</ref>

In [[familial adenomatous polyposis]], the abnormality is a mutation in the APC gene, resulting in its inactivity.  Attenuated FAP can occur from other mutations in the APC gene, and causes a [[phenotype]] wherein [[Colon (anatomy)|colonic]] polyps may be few in number <ref name="Burt"/>

Both the β-catenin gene and the APC gene are involved in the same cell growth signalling pathway, but the APC gene is known to have a significantly higher association with the development of colorectal tumors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chung | first1 = DC | title = The genetic basis of colorectal cancer: insights into critical pathways of tumorigenesis | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 854–65 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10982779 | doi = 10.1053/gast.2000.16507 }}</ref>

==Cancer risk and the need for screening==
There is a risk of development of cancer with fundic gland polyposis,<ref name="Sebastian">{{cite journal | last1 = Sebastian | first1 = S | last2 = Qasim | first2 = A | last3 = McLoughlin | first3 = R | last4 = O'Morain | first4 = CA | last5 = O'Connor | first5 = HJ | title = Fundic gland polyps: not so trivial entity and worth evaluation | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 126 | issue = 5 | pages = 1497–8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15131828 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2004.03.044 }}</ref> but it varies based on the underlying cause of the polyposis.<ref name="Burt"/>  The risk is highest with congenital polyposis syndromes, and is lowest in acquired causes.<ref name="Burt"/><ref name="Jalving">{{cite journal | last1 = Jalving | first1 = M | last2 = Koornstra | first2 = JJ | last3 = Götz | first3 = JM | last4 = Van Der Waaij | first4 = LA | last5 = De Jong | first5 = S | last6 = Zwart | first6 = N | last7 = Karrenbeld | first7 = A | last8 = Kleibeuker | first8 = JH | title = High-grade dysplasia in sporadic fundic gland polyps: a case report and review of the literature | journal = European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1229–33 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14560158 | doi = 10.1097/01.meg.0000085492.01212.d2 }}</ref>  As a result, it is recommend that patients with multiple fundic polyps have a [[colonoscopy]] to evaluate the colon.<ref name="Burt"/>  If there are polyps seen on colonoscopy, genetic testing and testing of family members is recommended.<ref name="Burt"/>

It is still unclear which patients would benefit with surveillance [[gastroscopy]], but most physicians recommend endoscopy every one to three years to survey polyps for dysplasia or cancer.<ref name="Burt"/>  In the event of high grade dysplasia, polypectomy, which is done through the endoscopy, or partial [[gastrectomy]] may be recommended.  One study showed the benefit of [[NSAID]] therapy in regression of gastric polyps, but the efficacy of this strategy (given the side effects of NSAIDs) is still dubious.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Esaki | first1 = M | last2 = Matsumoto | first2 = T | last3 = Mizuno | first3 = M | last4 = Kobori | first4 = Y | last5 = Yoshimura | first5 = R | last6 = Yao | first6 = T | last7 = Iida | first7 = M | title = Effect of sulindac treatment for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis with a new germline APC mutation at codon 161: report of a case | journal = Diseases of the colon and rectum | volume = 45 | issue = 10 | pages = 1397–402; discussion 1402–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12394442 | doi = 10.1097/01.DCR.0000029760.39219.D1 }}</ref>
