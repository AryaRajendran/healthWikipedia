'''Exophthalmos''', also called '''proptosis''', is a bulging of the [[human eye|eye]] anteriorly out of the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]].  Exophthalmos can be either bilateral (as is often seen in [[Graves' disease]]) or unilateral (as is often seen in an orbital tumor). Complete or partial dislocation from the orbit is also possible from trauma or swelling of surrounding tissue resulting from trauma. 

In the case of Graves' disease, the displacement of the eye is due to abnormal connective tissue deposition in the orbit and [[extraocular muscles]] which can be visualized by [[Computed axial tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]].<ref name=Epstein>{{cite book|author=Owen Epstein, David Perkin, John Cookson, David P de Bono |title=Clinical examination |edition=3rd|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis|year=2003|month=April|isbn=0-7234-3229-5}}</ref>

If left untreated, exophthalmos can cause the eyelids to fail to close during sleep leading to [[cornea]]l dryness and damage.  Another possible complication would be a form of redness or irritation called "[[Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis]]", where the area above the cornea becomes inflamed as a result of increased friction when blinking.  The process that is causing the displacement of the eye may also compress the [[optic nerve]] or [[ophthalmic artery]], leading to [[blindness]].

== Measurement ==
Measurement of the degree of exophthalmos is performed using an [[exophthalmometer]].

Most sources define exophthalmos/proptosis as a protrusion of the globe greater than 18&nbsp;mm.<ref name=Epstein /> 

The term exophthalmos is often used when describing proptosis associated with [[Graves' disease]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mercandetti|first=Michael|title=Exophthalmos|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1218575-overview|work=WebMD, LLC|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>

==Anatomy==
Proptosis is the anterior displacement of the eye from the orbit.  Since the orbit is closed off posteriorly, medially and laterally, any enlargement of structures located within will cause the anterior displacement of the eye.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Richard N|title=Pocket companion to Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1416054542|chapter=Eye|edition=8th}}</ref>  Swelling or enlargement of the lacrimal gland causes inferior medial and anterior dislocation of the eye.  This is because the lacrimal glands are located superiorly and laterally in the orbit.<ref name=Robbins />

==Causes==
Inflammatory/Infection:
*[[Graves' ophthalmopathy]] due to [[Graves' disease]], usually causes bilateral proptosis.
*[[Orbital cellulitis]] - often with unilateral proptosis, severe redness, and moderate to severe pain, [[sinusitis]] and an elevated white blood cell count.<ref name=Cecil /> 
* [[Dacryoadenitis]]
* [[Mucormycosis]]
* [[Idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease|Orbital pseudotumor]] - presents with acute, usually unilateral proptosis with severe pain.<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1437727883|pages=2430|edition=24th ed.}}</ref>
* [[High altitude cerebral edema]]
* [[Wegener's granulomatosis]]

Neoplastic:
* [[Leukemia]]s
* [[Meningioma]], (of sphenoid wing)
* [[Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma]]
* [[Hand–Schüller–Christian disease]]
* [[Hemangioma]], cavernous

Cystic:
* [[Dermoid cyst]]

Vascular:
* [[Carotid-cavernous fistula]]
*[[Aortic insufficiency]]: manifests as a pulsatile pseudo proptosis, described by British cardiothoracic surgeon, Hutan Ashrafian in 2006.

Others:
* [[Orbital fracture]]: apex, floor, medial wall, zygomatic
* Retrobulbar hemorrhage: trauma to the orbit can lead to bleeding behind the eye.  The hemorrhage has nowhere to escape and the increased pressure pushes the eye out of the socket, leading to proptosis and can also cause blindness if not treated promptly.
* [[Cushing's syndrome]] (due to fat in the orbital cave)
* [[Pfeiffer Syndrome]]

==Exophthalmos in dogs==

{{main|Eye proptosis}}

Exophthalmos is commonly found in [[dog]]s.  It is seen in [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]] (short nosed) dog breeds because of the shallow [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]].  However, it can lead to [[keratitis]] secondary to exposure of the [[cornea]].  Exophthalmos is commonly seen in the [[Pug]], [[Boston Terrier]], [[Pekingese]], and [[Shih Tzu]].
