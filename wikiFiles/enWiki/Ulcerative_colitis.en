'''Ulcerative colitis''' ('''''Colitis ulcerosa''''', '''UC''') is a form of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD). Ulcerative colitis is a form of [[colitis]], a [[disease]] of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] (large [[intestine]]), that includes characteristic [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], or open sores. The main symptom of active disease is usually constant [[diarrhea]] mixed with blood, of gradual onset. IBD is often confused with [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS), a troublesome but much less serious condition. 

Ulcerative colitis has similarities to [[Crohn's disease]], another form of IBD. Ulcerative colitis is an intermittent disease, with periods of exacerbated symptoms, and periods that are relatively symptom-free. Although the symptoms of ulcerative colitis can sometimes diminish on their own, the disease usually requires treatment to go into [[Remission (medicine)|remission]]. Ulcerative colitis has an [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of 1 to 20 cases per 100,000 individuals per year, and a [[prevalence]] of 8 to 246 per 100,000 individuals.<ref>Danese, S. & Fiocci, C. (2011). [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1102942 Ulcerative colitis.] The New England Journal of Medicine, 365:1713-1725.</ref>

The disease is more prevalent in northern countries of the world, as well as in northern areas of individual countries or other regions. Rates tend to be higher in more affluent countries, which may indicate the increased prevalence is due to increased rates of diagnosis. Although ulcerative colitis has no known cause, there is a presumed [[genetics|genetic]] component to susceptibility. The disease may be triggered in a susceptible person by environmental factors. Although dietary modification may reduce the discomfort of a person with the disease, ulcerative colitis is not thought to be caused by dietary factors. 

Ulcerative colitis is treated as an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]]. Treatment is with anti-inflammatory drugs, [[immunosuppression]], and [[Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease|biological therapy]] targeting specific components of the immune response. [[Colectomy]] (partial or total removal of the large bowel through surgery) is occasionally necessary if the disease is severe, doesn't respond to treatment, or if significant complications develop. A total [[proctocolectomy]] (removal of the entirety of the large bowel) can be curative, but it may be associated with complications.<ref name="Kim 2012">{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=IK|coauthors=Park, KJ; Kang, GH; Im, JP; Kim, SG; Jung, HC; Song, IS; Kim, JS|title=Risk factors for complications after total colectomy in ulcerative colitis|journal=The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology|date=2012 Oct|volume=23|issue=5|pages=Isayfa–Ssafya|pmid=23161324}}</ref>

{{Symptoms in CD vs. UC}}

===Gastrointestinal===
The clinical presentation<ref name=Hanauer>{{cite journal |author=Hanauer SB |last2=Hanauer |first2=Stephen B. |title=Inflammatory bowel disease |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=334 |issue=13 |pages=841–8 |year=1996 |pmid=8596552 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199603283341307 }}</ref> of ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of the disease process. Patients usually present with diarrhea mixed with blood and [[mucus]], of gradual onset that persists for an extended period (weeks). They may also have weight loss and blood on rectal examination. The chronic loss of blood from the GI tract leads to increased rates of [[anaemia]]. The disease may be accompanied with different degrees of abdominal pain, from mild discomfort to painful bowel movements or painful abdominal cramping with bowel movements.

Ulcerative colitis is associated with a general inflammatory process that affects many parts of the body. Sometimes these associated extra-intestinal symptoms are the initial signs of the disease, such as painful, arthritic knees in a teenager and may be seen in adults also. The presence of the disease may not be confirmed immediately, however, until the onset of intestinal manifestations.

====Extent of involvement====
[[File:Intestine-diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of the Human Intestine]]
Ulcerative colitis is normally continuous from the rectum up the colon. The disease is classified by the extent of involvement, depending on how far up the colon the disease extends:

*''Distal colitis'', potentially treatable with enemas:<ref name = ACGGuideline/>
**''[[Proctitis]]'': Involvement limited to the [[rectum]].
**''Proctosigmoiditis'': Involvement of the rectosigmoid colon, the portion of the colon adjacent to the rectum.
**''Left-sided colitis'': Involvement of the descending colon, which runs along the patient's left side, up to the splenic flexure and the beginning of the transverse colon.
*''Extensive colitis'', inflammation extending beyond the reach of enemas:
**''Pancolitis'': Involvement of the entire colon, extending from the rectum to the cecum, beyond which the small intestine begins.

====Severity of disease====
[[Image:Chronic Ulcerative Colitis 1.jpg|thumb|Colonic [[pseudopolyps]] of a patient with intractable ulcerative colitis. Colectomy specimen.]]In addition to the extent of involvement, people may also be characterized by the severity of their disease.<ref name = ACGGuideline/>

*''Mild disease'' correlates with fewer than four stools daily, with or without blood, no [[Systemic disease|systemic]] signs of toxicity, and a normal [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR). There may be mild abdominal pain or cramping. Patients may believe they are [[constipation|constipated]] when in fact they are experiencing [[tenesmus]], which is a constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel accompanied by involuntary straining efforts, pain, and cramping with little or no fecal output. Rectal pain is uncommon.
*''Moderate disease'' correlates with more than four stools daily, but with minimal signs of toxicity. Patients may display anemia (not requiring transfusions), moderate abdominal pain, and low grade [[fever]], {{convert|38|to|39|C|F}}.
*''Severe disease'', correlates with more than six bloody stools a day or observable massive and significant bloody bowel movement, and evidence of toxicity as demonstrated by fever, [[tachycardia]], anemia or an elevated ESR.
*''Fulminant disease'' correlates with more than ten bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal tenderness and distension, blood transfusion requirement and colonic dilation (expansion). Patients in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to [[toxic megacolon]]. If the [[serous membrane]] is involved, colonic perforation may ensue. Unless treated, fulminant disease will soon lead to death.

===Extraintestinal features===
[[File:Aphtha2.jpg|thumb|Patients with ulcerative colitis can occasionally have [[aphthous ulcers]] involving the [[tongue]], [[lip]]s, [[palate]] and [[pharynx]]]]
As ulcerative colitis is believed to have a systemic (i.e., autoimmune) origin, patients may present with [[comorbidities]] leading to [[symptom]]s and [[complication (medicine)|complications]] outside the colon. The frequency of such extraintestinal manifestations has been reported as anywhere between 6 and 47 percent.<ref name=Langan>{{cite journal|last=Langan|first=RC|coauthors=Gotsch, PB, Krafczyk, MA, Skillinge, DD|title=Ulcerative colitis: diagnosis and treatment |journal=American family physician|year=2007 |month=November |volume=76|issue=9|pages=1323–30 |pmid=18019875 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1323.pdf }}</ref> These include the following:

*[[Aphthous ulcer]] of the mouth
*Ophthalmic (involving the eyes):
**[[Iritis]] or [[uveitis]], which is inflammation of the iris
**[[Episcleritis]]
*Musculoskeletal:
**[[Seronegative arthritis]], which can be a large-joint [[arthritis|oligoarthritis]] (affecting one or two joints), or may affect many small joints of the hands and feet
**[[Ankylosing spondylitis]], arthritis of the spine
**[[Sacroiliitis]], arthritis of the lower spine
* Cutaneous (related to the skin):
**[[Erythema nodosum]], which is a [[panniculitis]], or inflammation of subcutaneous tissue involving the lower extremities
** [[Pyoderma gangrenosum]], which is a painful ulcerating lesion involving the [[skin]]
*[[Deep venous thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]]
*[[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
*[[Nail clubbing|Clubbing]], a deformity of the ends of the fingers.
*[[Primary sclerosing cholangitis]], a distinct disease that causes inflammation of the [[bile ducts]]

==Causes==
There are no direct known causes for ulcerative colitis, but there are many possible factors such as genetics and stress.

===Genetic factors===
A genetic component to the etiology of ulcerative colitis can be hypothesized based on the following:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Orholm M, Binder V, Sørensen TI, Rasmussen LP, Kyvik KO |title=Concordance of inflammatory bowel disease among Danish twins. Results of a nationwide study |journal=Scand. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=1075–81 |year=2000 |pmid=11099061 |doi= 10.1080/003655200451207}}</ref>
*Aggregation of ulcerative colitis in families.
*Identical [[twin studies|twin]] concordance rate of 10% and [[dizygotic twin]] concordance rate of 3%<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tysk C, Lindberg E, Jarnerot G, Floderus-Myrhed B | title=Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in an unselected population of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. A study of heritability and the influence of smoking | journal=Gut |volume= 29 | year=1988 |pages=990–996 | doi=10.1136/gut.29.7.990 | pmid=3396969|issue=7|pmc=1433769}}</ref>
*[[Ethnic]] differences in incidence
*[[Genetic marker]]s and [[Genetic linkage|linkages]]

There are 12 regions of the [[genome]] that may be linked to ulcerative colitis, including, in the order of their discovery, chromosomes 16, 12, 6, 14, 5, 19, 1, and 3,<ref name=Baumgart>{{cite journal | author=Baumgart DC, Carding SR| title=Inflammatory bowel disease: cause and immunobiology| journal=The Lancet | volume=369 | issue=9573 | year=2007 | pages=1627–1640 | pmid=17499605 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60750-8}}</ref> but none of these [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] has been consistently shown to be at fault, suggesting that the disorder arises from the combination of multiple genes. For example, chromosome band 1p36 is one such region thought to be linked to inflammatory bowel disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cho JH |title=Linkage and linkage disequilibrium in chromosome band 1p36 in American Chaldeans with inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Hum. Mol. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=1425–32 |year=2000 |pmid=10814724 |doi= 10.1093/hmg/9.9.1425|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/9/1425.full.pdf |author-separator=, |author2=Nicolae DL |author3=Ramos R |display-authors=3 |last4=Fields |first4=CT |last5=Rabenau |first5=K |last6=Corradino |first6=S |last7=Brant |first7=SR |last8=Espinosa |first8=R |last9=Lebeau |first9=M }}</ref> 

Some of the putative regions encode transporter proteins such as OCTN1 and OCTN2. Other potential regions involve cell scaffolding proteins such as the MAGUK family. There may even be [[human leukocyte antigen]] associations at work. In fact, this linkage on chromosome 6 may be the most convincing and consistent of the genetic candidates.<ref name=Baumgart/>

Multiple autoimmune disorders have been recorded with the neurovisceral and cutaneous genetic [[porphyrias]] including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, [[celiac disease]], [[dermatitis herpetiformis]], [[diabetes]], systemic and discoid [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], ankylosing spondylitis, [[scleroderma]], [[Sjogren's disease]] and [[scleritis]]. Physicians should be on high alert for porphyrias in families with [[autoimmune]] disorders and care must be taken with potential [[porphyrinogenic drugs]], including [[sulfasalazine]].

===Environmental factors===
Many hypotheses have been raised for environmental contributants to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. They include the following:
*[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]]: as the colon is exposed to many dietary substances which may encourage [[inflammation]], dietary factors have been hypothesized to play a role in the [[pathogenesis]] of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There have been few studies to investigate such an association, but one study showed no [[Association (statistics)|association]] of refined [[sugar]] on the prevalence of ulcerative colitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Järnerot G, Järnmark I, Nilsson K |title=Consumption of refined sugar by patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Scand.

===Autoimmune disease===
Ulcerative colitis is an [[autoimmune disease]] characterized by [[T-cells]] infiltrating the colon.<ref name="Targeting Improves MSC Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease">{{cite web|last=Ko, et al|first=In Kap|title=Targeting Improves MSC Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease|publisher=NCBI, National Institutes of Health|pmc=2911249}}</ref> In contrast to Crohn's disease, which can affect areas of the gastrointestinal tract outside of the colon, ulcerative colitis usually involves the rectum and is confined to the colon, with occasional involvement of the [[ileum]]. This so-called "backwash ileitis" can occur in 10–20% of patients with [[pancolitis]] and is believed to be of little clinical significance.<ref name="ISBN 0071599916">Fauci ''et al.'' Harrison's Internal Medicine, 17th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2008. ISBN 978-0-07-159991-7</ref> Ulcerative colitis can also be associated with comorbidities that produce symptoms in many areas of the body outside the digestive system. Surgical removal of the large intestine often cures the disease.<ref name=ACGGuideline/>

===Alternative theories===
{{Risk factors in CD vs. UC}}
Levels of [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] tend to be higher in persons with ulcerative colitis. This could mean that there are higher levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the intestine. An alternative theory suggests that the symptoms of the disease may be caused by toxic effects of the hydrogen sulfide on the cells lining the intestine.<ref name=Roediger>{{cite journal |author=Roediger WE, Moore J, Babidge W |title=Colonic sulfide in pathogenesis and treatment of ulcerative colitis |journal=Dig.

===Comparison to Crohn's disease===
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the main types of inflammatory bowel disease, and may mimic each other to great extent, but differ somewhat in etiology and pathophysiology:

==Pathophysiology==
{{Pathophysiology in CD vs. UC}}
An increased amount of colonic sulfate-reducing bacteria has been observed in some patients with ulcerative colitis, resulting in higher concentrations of the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide. The role of hydrogen sulfide in pathogenesis is unclear. It has been suggested that the protective benefit of smoking that some patients report is due to [[hydrogen cyanide]] from cigarette smoke reacting with hydrogen sulfide to produce the nontoxic isothiocyanate. Another unrelated study suggested sulphur contained in red meats and alcohol may lead to an increased risk of relapse for patients in remission.<ref name=Roediger/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Ulcerative colitis (2) active.jpg|thumb|H&E stain of a colonic biopsy showing a crypt abscess, a classic finding in ulcerative colitis]]
The initial [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] workup for ulcerative colitis includes the following:<ref name=ACGGuideline>{{cite journal |author=Kornbluth A, Sachar DB |title=Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults (update): American College of Gastroenterology, Practice Parameters Committee |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=99 |issue=7 |pages=1371–85 |year=2004 |pmid=15233681 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.40036.x }}</ref><ref name=emed2336>{{eMedicine|med|2336|Ulcerative colitis}}</ref>

*A [[complete blood count]] is done to check for anemia; [[thrombocytosis]], a high [[platelet]] count, is occasionally seen
*[[Electrolyte]] studies and [[renal function|renal function tests]] are done, as chronic diarrhea may be associated with [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]] and pre-renal failure.
*[[Liver function tests]] are performed to screen for bile duct involvement: primary sclerosing cholangitis.
*[[X-ray]]
*[[Urinalysis]]
*Stool culture, to rule out parasites and infectious causes.
*Erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be measured, with an elevated sedimentation rate indicating that an inflammatory process is present.
*[[C-reactive protein]] can be measured, with an elevated level being another indication of inflammation.

Although ulcerative colitis is a disease of unknown causation, inquiry should be made as to unusual factors believed to trigger the disease.<ref name=ACGGuideline/> Factors may include: recent cessation of tobacco smoking; recent administration of large doses of [[iron]] or vitamin B6; [[hydrogen peroxide]] in enemas or other procedures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Endoscopic===
[[Image:Ulcerative colitis (2) endoscopic biopsy.jpg|thumb|Biopsy sample ([[H&E stain]]) that demonstrates marked [[lymphocyte|lymphocytic]] infiltration (blue/purple) of the [[intestinal mucosa]] and architectural distortion of the crypts.]]
The best test for diagnosis of ulcerative colitis remains [[endoscopy]]. Full colonoscopy to the cecum and entry into the terminal ileum is attempted only if diagnosis of UC is unclear. Otherwise, a flexible sigmoidoscopy is sufficient to support the diagnosis. The physician may elect to limit the extent of the exam if severe colitis is encountered to minimize the risk of [[Bowel perforation|perforation]] of the colon. Endoscopic findings in ulcerative colitis include the following:
*Loss of the vascular appearance of the colon
*[[Erythema]] (or redness of the [[mucosa]]) and [[friability]] of the mucosa
*Superficial ulceration, which may be confluent, and
*Pseudopolyps.

Ulcerative colitis is usually continuous from the rectum, with the rectum almost universally being involved. There is rarely perianal disease, but cases have been reported. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from proctitis or inflammation of the rectum, to left sided colitis, to pancolitis, which is inflammation involving the ascending colon.

===Histologic===
[[Biopsy|Biopsies]] of the mucosa are taken to definitively diagnose UC and differentiate it from Crohn's disease, which is managed differently clinically. Microbiological samples are typically taken at the time of endoscopy. The [[pathology]] in ulcerative colitis typically involves distortion of [[Intestinal crypt|crypt]] architecture, inflammation of crypts (cryptitis), frank crypt [[abscess]]es, and hemorrhage or inflammatory cells in the [[lamina propria]]. In cases where the clinical picture is unclear, the histomorphologic analysis often plays a pivotal role in determining the diagnosis and thus the management. By contrast, a biopsy analysis may be indeterminate, and thus the clinical progression of the disease must inform its treatment.

===Differential diagnosis===
[[Image:Ulcerative colitis.jpg|thumb|[[Endoscopic]] image of ulcerative colitis affecting the left side of the colon. The image shows confluent superficial ulceration and loss of mucosal architecture. Crohn's disease may be similar in appearance, a fact that can make diagnosing UC a challenge.]]
The following conditions may present in a similar manner as ulcerative colitis, and should be excluded:
* Crohn's disease
* [[Infectious disease|Infectious]] colitis, which is typically detected on stool [[cultures]]
** [[Pseudomembranous colitis]], or ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''-associated colitis, bacterial upsets often seen following administration of antibiotics
* [[Ischemic colitis]], inadequate blood supply to the intestine, which typically affects the elderly
* [[Radiation colitis]] in patients with previous pelvic [[radiotherapy]]
* [[Chemical colitis]] resulting from introduction of harsh chemicals into the colon from an enema or other procedure.

The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of ulcerative colitis is Crohn's disease, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis.
{{Findings in CD vs. UC}}

==Management==
{{Main|Management of ulcerative colitis}}
Standard treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on extent of involvement and disease severity. The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse of the disease. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing a remission which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the lining of the colon and then longer term treatment to maintain the remission and prevent complications.

===Medication===
Ulcerative colitis can be treated with a number of medications including 5-ASA drugs such as Sulfasalazine and [[Mesalazine]]. [[Corticosteroids]] such as [[prednisone]] can also be used due to their immunosuppressing and short term healing properties, but due to the risks outweighing the benefits, they are not used long term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as [[azathioprine]], and biological agents such as [[infliximab]] and [[adalimumab]] are given lastly, only if patients cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and Corticosteroids, due to their possible risk factors, including, but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, [[Tuberculosis|TB]] and new or worsening [[heart failure]]. (These side effects are rare.)  A formulation of [[budesonide]] was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empr.com/uceris-approved-for-active-ulcerative-colitis/article/276075/ |title=Uceris Approved for Active Ulcerative Colitis |publisher=empr.com |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref>

====Aminosalicylates====
Sulfasalazine has been a major agent in the therapy of mild to moderate UC for over 50 years. In 1977, Mastan S. Kalsi ''et al.'' determined that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA and mesalazine) was the therapeutically active in sulfasalazine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Since then many 5-ASA compounds have been developed with the aim of maintaining efficacy but reducing the common side effects associated with the sulfapyridine moiety in sulfasalazine.<ref>{{cite web | author=S. Kane |year=2006 | title=Asacol - A Review Focusing on Ulcerative Colitis|url=http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1980/Kane_edit.pdf }}</ref>

====Biologics====
Biologic treatments such as Infliximab (trade name Remicade), adalimumab (trade name Humira) and [[Golimumab]] (trade name Simponi) are commonly used to treat patients with Ulcerative Colitis who are no longer responding to corticosteroids. Usually these medications are only used after other options have been exasperated (i.e. patient has received high dose corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as Azathioprine and Mesalazine) but in certain cases, patients may skip these steps and start biologic treatments under doctor orders.

Unlike Aminosalicylates, Biologics can cause harsh side effects such as mild heart failure or worsening of heart failure, [[skin cancer]] (excluding melanoma), weakening of the immune system leading to possible [[fatal infections]] and [[Tuberculosis]]. For this reason patients on these treatments are closely monitored and must be given tests for Hepatitis and Tuberculosis at least once a year. Blood tests must also be taken every 4–8 weeks.

====Nicotine====
Unlike Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis has a lesser prevalence in smokers than non-smokers. Patients who choose to use smoking as a treatment should keep a record regarding smoking cessation and the onset or relapse of ulcerative colitis to verify associations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Calkins BM |title=A meta-analysis of the role of smoking in inflammatory bowel disease|journal=Dig. Dis.

====Iron supplementation====
The gradual loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for this. Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency may require treatment with oral iron supplements. Occasionally, [[parenteral iron]] is required.<ref name=Mowat2011>{{cite journal |author=Mowat C, Cole A, Windsor A, ''et al.'' |title=Guidelines for the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults |journal=Gut |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=571–607 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21464096 |doi=10.1136/gut.2010.224154}}</ref>

====Treatments in Development====
{{Technical|section|date=May 2013}}
Inflammation of the colon is a characteristic symptom of ulcerative colitis and a new series of drugs in development look to disrupt the inflammation process by selectively targeting an ion channel. A crucial step involved in the inflammation signaling cascade involves an intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel (IK channel) known as KCa3.1<ref>Ghanshani, S., Wulff, H., Miller, M. J., Rohm, H., Neben, A., Gutman, G. A., ... & Chandy, K. G. (2000). Up-regulation of the IKCa1 potassium channel during T-cell activation Molecular mechanism and functional consequences.

Production of these cytokines decreases because inhibition of KCa3.1 reduces the efflux of K+ which in turn diminishes the influx of Ca2+. By lowering elevated intracellular Ca2+ in patients with ulcerative colitis these novel drug candidates can inhibit the signaling cascade involved in the inflammation process<ref>Strøbæk, D., Brown, D. T., Jenkins, D. P., Chen, Y. J., Coleman, N., Ando, Y., ... & Christophersen, P. (2013).

Preclinical study results in 2012 indicated that these selective inhibitors decreased colon inflammation in mice and rats cloned with the human KCa3.1 protein as effectively as the standard inflammatory bowel disease treatment of sulfasalazine. However, these novel selective IK channel blockers are significantly more potent and theoretically would be able to taken at a much more manageable dosage<ref>Strøbæk, D., Brown, D. T., Jenkins, D.

Benzothiazinone, NS6180, is a novel class KCa3.1 channel inhibitor in development.Through a number of in vitro experiments, NS6180 was qualified for KCa3.1 channel inhibition. In vivo experiment  of DNBS (2,4 - dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid) induced rat colitis, a frequently used animal model for inflammatory bowel disease, showed comparable efficacy and increased potency than sulfasalazine<ref>Strøbæk, D., Brown, D.

===Surgery===
{{Treatment in CD vs. UC}}
Unlike Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by [[Ileostomy|surgical removal of the large intestine]], also known as a colectomy. This procedure is necessary in the event of: [[exsanguination|exsanguinating]] [[internal bleeding|hemorrhage]], frank perforation or documented or strongly suspected [[carcinoma]]. Surgery is also indicated for patients with severe colitis or toxic megacolon. Patients with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestinal tract. In rare cases the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon.<ref name=ACGGuideline/>

Another surgical option for ulcerative colitis that is affecting most of the large bowel is called the [[ileo-anal pouch]] procedure. This procedure is a two to three step procedure in which the large bowel is removed, except for the rectal stump and [[anus]], and a temporary ileostomy is made. The next part of the surgery can be done in one or two steps and is usually done at six to twelve month intervals from each prior surgery. 

In the next step of the surgery an internal pouch is made of the patients' own small bowel and this pouch is then hooked back up internally to the rectal stump so that patient can once again have a reasonably functioning bowel system, all internal. The temporary ileostomy can be reversed at this time so that the patient is now internalized for bowel functions, or in another step to the procedure, the pouch and rectal stump [[anastamosis]] can be left inside the patient to heal for some time, while the patient still uses the ileostomy for bowel function. Then on a subsequent surgery the ileostomy is reversed and the patient has internalized bowel function again.

===Bacterial recolonization===
*[[Probiotics]] may have benefit. One study which looked at a probiotic known as VSL#3 has shown promise for people with ulcerative colitis.<ref name=Fedorak>{{cite journal |author=Bibiloni R |title=VSL#3 probiotic-mixture induces remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis |journal=Am.

==Prognosis==
{{Complications of CD vs. UC}}

===Progression or remission===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
Patients with ulcerative colitis usually have an intermittent course, with periods of disease inactivity alternating with "flares" of disease. Patients with proctitis or left-sided colitis usually have a more benign course: only 15% progress proximally with their disease, and up to 20% can have sustained remission in the absence of any therapy. Patients with more extensive disease are less likely to sustain remission, but the rate of remission is independent of the severity of disease.

===Ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer===
There is a significantly increased risk of [[colorectal cancer]] in patients with ulcerative colitis after ten years if involvement is beyond the [[splenic flexure]]. Those with only proctitis or rectosigmoiditis usually have no increased risk.<ref name=ACGGuideline/> It is recommended that patients have screening [[colonoscopies]] with random biopsies to look for [[dysplasia]] after eight years of disease activity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leighton JA |title=ASGE guideline: endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Gastrointest.

===Primary sclerosing cholangitis===
Ulcerative colitis has a significant association with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a progressive inflammatory disorder of small and large [[bile duct]]s. As many as 5% of patients with ulcerative colitis may progress to develop primary sclerosing cholangitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olsson R |title=Prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with ulcerative colitis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=100 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1319–23 |year=1991|pmid=2013375 |author-separator=, |author2=Danielsson A |author3=Järnerot G |display-authors=3 |last4=Lindström |first4=E |last5=Lööf |first5=L |last6=Rolny |first6=P |last7=Rydén |first7=BO |last8=Tysk |first8=C |last9=Wallerstedt |first9=S }}</ref>
