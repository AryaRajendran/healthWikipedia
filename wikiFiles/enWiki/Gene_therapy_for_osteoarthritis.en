'''Gene transfer strategies''' for medical management of the [[Osteoarthritis]] have attracted the attention of scientists due to the complex [[pathology]] of this chronic disease. Unlike other pharmacological treatments, [[gene therapy]] targets the disease process rather than the symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last=T. Pap, J. Schedel, G. Pap, U. Moller-Ladner, R.E. Gay, S. Gay C. Guincamp|title=Gene therapy in osteoarthritis|journal=Joint Bone Spine|year=2000}}</ref>

== Theory ==
Passing from parents to children, [[genes]] are the building blocks of inheritance. They contain instructions for making [[proteins]]. If genes do not produce the right proteins in a correct way, a child can have a genetic disorder.
[[Gene therapy]] is a molecular method aiming to replace defective or absent genes, or to counteract the ones undergoing overexpression. For this purpose, three technics may be utilized: gene isolation, manipulations, and transferring to target cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=C. Wayne McIlwraith David D. Frisbie|title=Gene Therapy: Future Therapies in Osteoarthritis|journal=Vet Clin North Am Equine Pract|year=2001|month=Aug|volume=17|issue=2|pages=233-243}}</ref>  
The most common form of gene therapy involves inserting a normal gene to replace an abnormal gene. Other approaches including repairing an abnormal gene and altering the degree to which a gene is turned on or off.
Two basic methodologies are utilized to transfer vectors into target tissues; [[Ex vivo]] gene transfer and [[In-vivo]] gene transfer.
One type of gene therapy in which the gene transfer takes place outside the patient’s body is called ex vivo gene therapy. This method of gene therapy is more complicated but safer since there is a possibility to culture, test, and control the modified cells. 

== Significance and causes of osteoarthritis == 
[[Osteoarthritis]] (OA) is a degenerative joint disease which is the western world’s leading cause of pain and disability.<ref name="3 evans gouz">{{cite journal|last=CH Evans,JN Gouze, E Gouze, PD Robbins and SC Ghivizzani|title=Osteoarthritis gene therapy|journal=Gene Therapy|year=2004|pages=379–389}}</ref> <ref name="8 sara" >{{cite journal|last=Madry, H., Luyten, F.P., and Facchini, A|title=Biological aspects of early osteoarthritis|journal=Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy|year=2011|accessdate=October 4 2011}}</ref>  It is characterized by the progressive loss of normal structure and function of articular [[cartilage]], the smooth tissue covering the end of the moving bones. <ref name="10 sasa">{{cite journal|last=Buckwalter, J.A., and Mankin, H.J.|title=Instructional Course Lectures, The American Academy of Ortopaedic Surgeons – Articular cartilage: Part II.Degeneration and osteoarthritis, repair, regeneration, and transplantation|journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am|year=1997|volume=79|series=4|pages=612-632}}</ref> This chronic disease not only affects the articular cartilage but the subchondral bone, the [[synovium]] and periarticular tissues are other candidates.<ref name="3 evans gouz" /> People with OA can experience severe pain and limited motion. OA is mostly the result of natural aging of the joint due to biochemical changes in the cartilage [[extracellular matrix]].<ref name="8 sara" /> <ref name="11 sasa">{{cite journal|last=. Felson, D.T., Lawrence, R.C., Dieppe, P.A., Hirsch, R., et al.|title=Osteoarthritis: new insights. Part 1: the disease and its risk factors|journal=Ann Intern Med|volume=133|issue=8|pages=635-646}}</ref> 

Osteoarthritis is caused by mechanical factors such as obesity, joint [[Truama (medicine)|trauma]], mechanical overloading of joints or joint-instability. <ref name="11 sasa" /> [[Genetics]] is also a leading factor that contributes to OA. Studies have shown that genetics is the source of at least 50% of OA cases in the [[hands]] and [[hips]]. Since the degeneration of cartilage is an irreversible phenomenon, it is incurable, costly and responds poorly to treatment <ref name="3 evans gouz" />. Due to the prevalence of this disease nowadays, the repair and regeneration of articular cartilage has become a dominant area of research.<ref name="10 sasa" /> 
The growing number of the patients suffering from osteoarthritis and the effectiveness of the current treatments attract a great deal of attention to genetic-based therapeutic methods to cure and prevent the progression of this chronic disease. 

== Vectors for osteoarthritis gene delivery ==
Various [[vectors]] have been developed to carry the therapeutic genes to cells. There are two broad categories of gene delivery vectors: [[Viral vectors]], involving [[viruses]] and non-viral agents, such as [[polymers]] and [[liposomes]].<ref name="sarraf">{{cite journal|last=Antonios G. Mikos A. Saraf|title=Gene delivery strategies for cartilage tissue engineering|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|year=2006|pages=592–603}}</ref> 

=== Viral vectors ===
[[Viral vectors]] proved to be more successful in transfecting [[Cell (biology)|cells]] as their life cycles require them to transfer their own genes to the host cells with high efficiency. A virus infects the human by inserting its gene directly into his cells. This can be deadly, but the brilliant idea is to take advantage of this natural ability. The idea is to remove all the dangerous genes in the virus and inject the healthy human genes.  So, viruses are inserting positive elements to the host cells while attacking them and they will be helpful rather that harmful. <ref name="4nk evans">{{cite journal|last=Christopher H. Evans|title=Gene Therapies for Osteoarthritis|journal=Current Rheumatology Reports|year=2004|volume=6|issue=1|pages=31-40}}</ref> 

While [[viral vectors]] are 40% more efficient in transferring genes, they are not fully appreciated for in vivo gene delivery because of their further adverse effects. Primarily, viral vectors induce an [[inflammatory]] response, which can cause minor side effects such as mild [[edema]] or serious ones like multisystem organ failure. It is also difficult to administer gene therapy repeatedly due to the immune system’s enhanced response to viruses. Furthermore, viruses may spread out to other organs after [[intraarticular]] injection and this will be an important disadvantage.<ref>{{cite journal|last=N. Somia I.M. Verma|title=Gene Therapy — promises, problems and prospects|journal=Nature|year=1997|pages=239 – 242}}</ref>  However, majority of problems associated with gene delivery using viral vectors solved by ex vivo gene delivery method. In Osteoarthritis gene therapy, ex vivo method makes it possible to transfect not only the cells of the synovial lining of joints but also articular [[chondrocytes]] and chondroprogenitor cells in cartilage.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Q.J. Jiang et al K. Gelse|title=Fibroblast-mediated delivery of growth factor complementary DNA into mouse joints induces chondrogenesis but avoids the disadvantages of direct viral gene transfer|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=2001|pages=1943 – 1953}}</ref> 

=== Non-viral vectors ===
Non-viral methods involve complexing therapeutic [[DNA]] to various [[macromolecules]] including cationic lipids and [[liposomes]], [[polymers]], [[polyamines]] and [[polyethylenimine]], and [[nanoparticles]]. FuGene 6 <ref>{{cite journal|last=G. Kaul et al H. Madry|title=Trippel, Enhanced repair of articular cartilage defects in vivo by transplanted chondrocytes overexpressing insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)|journal=Gene Therapy|year=2005|pages=1171–1179}}</ref>  and modified cationic liposomes <ref>{{cite journal|last=T.M. Maris, R. Gelberman, M. Boyer, M. Silva, D. Amiel R.S. Goomer|title=Nonviral in vivo Gene Therapy for tissue engineering of articular cartilage and tendon repair|journal=Clin. Orthop.Relat.Res|year=2000|pages=189 – 200}}</ref>  are two non-viral gene delivery methods that have so far been utilized for gene delivery to cartilage. FuGene 6 is a non-liposomal lipid formulation, which has proved to be successful in transfecting a variety of cell lines. Liposomes have shown to be an appropriate candidate for gene delivery <ref>{{cite journal|last=Verwaerde, C. Jacquet, C. Auriault, J. Sany, C. Jorgensen F. Apparailly|title=Adenovirus-mediated transfer of viral IL-10 gene inhibits murine collagen-induced arthritis|journal=J. Immunol|year=1998|pages=5213 – 5220}}</ref> , where cationic liposomes are made to facilitate the interaction with the cell membranes and nucleic acids <ref>{{cite journal|last=J. Honiger, D. Damotte, A. Minty, C. Fournier, D. Fradelizi, M. Boissier N. Bessis|title=Encapsulation in hollow fibres of xenogeneic cells engineered to secrete IL-4 or IL-13 ameliorates murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)|journal=Clinical & Experimental Immunology|year=1999|pages=376 – 382}}</ref> .
Unlike viral vectors, non-viral ones avoid the risk of acquiring replication competence. They have the capacity to deliver a large amount of therapeutic genes repeatedly, and it is convenient to produce them on a large scale. The most important of all, they do not elicit immune responses in the host organism. In spite of having advantages, non-viral vectors have not yet replaced viral vectors due to relatively low efficiency and short-term [[transgene]] expression. <ref name=sarraf /> 

Novel non-viral vectors for osteoarthritis gene delivery including polymeric vectors are still under investigations. 

== Target cells in osteoarthritis gene therapy ==
Target cells in the OA therapy are autologous [[chondrocytes]], Chondroprogenitor cells, Cells within the synovial cavity <ref name=sarraf /> , and cells of adjacent tissues such as [[muscle]], [[tendons]], [[ligaments]], and [[meniscus]].
Development of cartilage function and structure may be achieved by: 
*Inhibiting inflammatory and [[catabolic]] pathways
*Stimulating [[anabolic]] pathways to rebuild the matrix 
*Impeding cell [[senescence]]
*Avoiding the pathological formation of [[osteophytes]] 
*Prevention of [[apoptosis]], and/or influencing several of these processes <ref name="Hamburg">{{cite journal|last=Magali Cucchiarini and Henning Madry|title=Magali Cucchiarini and Henning Madry|journal=Experimental Orthopaedics and Osteoarthritis Research, Saarland University Medical Center|series=Homburg/Saar}}</ref> 

Approaches influencing several of these processes simultaneously have also shown to be successful, like transferring the combination of inhibitors of catabolism pathways and activators of anabolic events ([[IGF-I]]/[[IL-1RA]]) <ref>{{cite journal|last=Haupt JL et al|title=Transduction of insulin-like growth factor-I and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein controls cartilage degradation in an osteoarthritic culture model|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research|year=2005|pages=118-126}}</ref> , as well as that of activators of anabolic and proliferative processes (FGF- 2/SOX9 or FGF-2/IGF-I) <ref name=Hamburg /> .

== Gene defects leading to osteoarthritis ==
Osteoarthritis has a great degree of heritability <ref>{{cite journal|last=MacGregor AJ|title=The genetic contribution to radiographic hip osteoarthritis in women: results of a classic twin study|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=2000|pages=2410–2416}}</ref> . Forms of osteoarthritis caused by single gene mutation have better chance of treatment by gene therapy.<ref name="3 evans gouz" />  
[[Epidemiological]] studies have shown that a genetic component may be an important risk factor in OA.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Piercarlo Sarzi-Puttini et al|title=Osteoarthritis: An Overview of the Disease and Its Treatment Strategies|journal=Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism|year=2005|volume=35|issue=1|pages=1–10}}</ref>  [[Insulin-like growth factor I]] genes (IGF-1), [[Transforming growth factor]]β, [[cartilage oligomeric matrix protein]], [[bone morphogenetic protein]], and other anabolic gene candidates are among the candidate genes for OA.<ref name=sarraf />  Genetic changes in OA can lead to defects of a structural protein such as [[collagen]], or changes in the metabolism of bone and cartilage. OA is rarely considered as a simple disorder following [[Mendelian inheritance]] being predominantly a multifactorial disease.

However in the field of OA gene therapy, researches has more focused on gene transfer as a delivery system for therapeutic gene products, rather counteracting genetic abnormalities or [[polymorphisms]]. Genes, which contribute to protect and restore the matrix of articular cartilage, are attracting the most attention. These Genes are listed in '''Table 1'''. Among all candidates listed below Proteins that block the actions of interleukin-1 (IL-1) or that promote the synthesis of cartilage matrix molecules have received the most experimental scurity. <ref name="4nk evans" />

== Interleukin-1 as a target in osteoarthritis ==
Researches suggest that among all potential mediators, a protein called [[Interleukin-1]] is by far the most potent cause of the pain, joint inflammation and loss of cartilage associated with osteoarthritis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cole AA Kuettner KE|title=Cartilage degeneration in different human joints|journal=Osteoarthritis Cartilage|year=2005|month=Feb|volume=13|issue=2|pages=93-103}}</ref>  A therapeutic gene used to treat the arthritic joins produces a second protein, which naturally counteracts the effect of interleukin-1. <ref>{{cite book|last=Dinarello CA|title=Interleukin-1 family;The Cytokine Handbook|year=2003|publisher=Academic Press|location=London}}</ref> 
The [[Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist]] (IL-1Ra), the natural agonist of IL-1, is a protein that binds non-productively to the cell surface of interleukin-1 receptor, therefore blocks the activities of IL-1 by preventing it from sending a signal to IL-1 receptor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spurr NK, Cox S, Jeggo P, Sim RB Steinkasserer A|title=The human IL-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL1RN) maps to chromosome 2q14-q21, in the region of the IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta loci|journal=Genomics|month=July|volume=13|series=1992|issue=3|pages=654-657}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Evans CH Arend WP|title=Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist|journal=The Cytokine Handbook,Lotze MT Edited by Thomson AW, London|year=2003|pages=669–708}}</ref> 
There are three main researches that prove the benefits of local IL-1Ra gene therapy in animal models of osteoarthritis [4]. Series of experiments on canines, rabbits, and horses demonstrate that local IL-1Ra gene therapy is safe and effective in animal models of OA, according to the fact that recombinant human IL-1Ra strongly protected the articular cartilage from degenerative changes. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernandes JC, Martel-Pelletier J, et al Caron JP|title=Chondroprotective effect of intra-articular injections of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in experimental osteoarthritis: suppression of collagenase-1 expression|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=1996|pages=1535–1544}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Tardif G, Martel-Pelletier J, et al Fernandes J|title=In vivo transfer of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene in osteoarthritic rabbit knee joints: prevention of osteoarthritis progression|journal=American Journal of Pathology|year=1999|pages=1159–1169}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Ghivizzani SC, Robbins PD, et al Frisbie DD|title=Treatment of experimental equine osteoarthritis by in vivo delivery of the equine interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene|journal=Gene Therapy|year=2002|pages=12–20}}</ref> 

== Strategies for osteoarthritis gene therapy ==
In the context of OA, the most attractive intra- articular sites for gene transfer are the synovium and the articular cartilage. Most experimental progress has been made with gene transfer to to a convenient intra-articular tissue, such as the synovium, a tissue amenable to genetic modification by a variety of vectors, using both in vivo and ex vivo protocols.

=== Gene transfer to synovium ===
The major purpose of gene delivery is to alter the lining of the joint in a way that enables them to serve as an endogenous source of therapeutic molecules ('''Table-1''') therapeutic molecules can diffuse and influence the metabolism of adjacent tissues such as cartilage.  
Genes may be delivered to synovium in animal models of RA and OA by direct, in vivo injection of vector or by indirect, ex vivo methods involving autologous synovial cells, skin [[fibroblasts]], or other cell types such as [[mesenchymal stem cells]].
The direct in vivo approach is intra-articular insertion of a vector to affect synovicytes. Vectors play crucial role in success of this method.<ref>{{cite journal|last=C. H. and Robbins, P. D. Evans|title=Gene therapy for arthritis|journal=Gene Therapeutics, J. A. Wolff, Edition|year=1994|pages=320-343}}</ref>  The effect of Differen vectors for in vivo gene delivery to synovium is summarized in '''Table 2''':

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" align="center"
|+ '''Table 2- Performance of different vectors for in vivo gene delivery to synovium''' <ref name="4nk evans" /> 
|-
! style="background: #efefef;" | Vector
! colspan="2" style="background: #ffdead;" | Comment
|-
| Non-viral Vectors || Short-term and less efficient transfection; many inflammatory
|-
| [[Retrovirus]] || No transduction of normal synovium; modest transduction of inflamed synovium
|-
| [[Lentivirus]] || Extremely high transduction and transgene expression; no obvious side effects
|-
| [[Adenovirus]] || High transduction efficiency; dose-dependent inflammatory response
|-
| [[Adeno-associated virus]]  || Moderate levels of transduction of normal and inflamed synovium
|-
| [[Herpes simplex virus]]|| Highly efficient transduction; cytotoxic
|-
|}

The indirect ex vivo approach involves harvest of synovium, isolation and culture of synoviocytes, in vitro transduction, and injection of engineered synovicytes into the joint.<ref>{{cite journal|last=G et al Bandara|title=Intraarticular expression of biologically active interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein by ex vivo gene transfer|journal=Proc Natl. Acad. Sci|year=1990|pages=764-768}}</ref> 

=== Gene transfer to cartilage === 
Contrary to the synoviocytes which are dividing cells and can be efficacy transduced in vivo using either liposomes or viral vectors, in vivo delivery of genes to chondrocytes is hindered by the dense extra cellular matrix that surrounds these cells. Chondrocytes are non- dividing cells, embedded in a network of [[collagens]] and [[proteoglycans]]; however researches suggest that genes can be transferred to chondrocytes within normal cartilage by intraarticular injection of liposomes containing [[sendai virus]] (HVJ- liposomes) <ref>{{cite journal|last=Hashimoto H, Tomita N, et al Tomita T|title=In vivo direct gene transfer into articular cartilage by intra-articular injection mediated by HVJ (sendai) virus and liposomes|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=1997|pages=901-906}}</ref>  and adeno-associated virus. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Schwartz E|title=The adeno-associated virus vector for orthopaedic gene therapy|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|year=2000|pages=31-40}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Yoo U, Mandell I, Angele P, et al|title=Chondroprogenitor cells and gene therapy|journal=Clin Orthop|year=2000|pages=164-170}}</ref> 

Most efficient methods of gene transfer to cartilage have involved ex vivo strategies using chondrocytes or chondroprogenitor cells. Chondrocytes are genetically enhanced by transferring complementary DNA encoding [[IL-1RA]], [[IGF-1]], or matrix break down [[inhibitors]] mentioned in '''Table 1'''. As discussed before, the transplanted cells could serve as an intra- articular source of therapeutic molecules.<ref name="4nk evans" /> 

== Safety ==
One important issue related to human gene therapy is safety, particularly for the gene therapy of non-fatal diseases such as OA. The main factor that is worthy to be concerned about is the high [[immunogenicity]] of certain viral vectors. Retroviral vectors integrate into the [[chromosomes]] of the cells they infect. There will be always a chance of integrating into a tumor suppressor gene or an [[oncogene]], leading to virulent transformation of the cell. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Anderson WF|title=Human gene therapy|journal=Science|year=1992|volume=256|pages=808-813}}</ref> In general, gene transfer to humans is considered as a safe therapeutic method, despite recent events that have provided examples of random adverse events. 
In the first adverse event, adenovirus was used as vector. In 1999 a patient developed a high fever four hours after delivery of the viruses and died from multi-organ failure within 4 days. The immediate appearance of symptoms shows activation of the innate immune system in response to viruses. It however, worth mentioning that recombinant adenovirus vectors have been utilized in over 600 additional subjects taking part in over 170 different clinical trials without causing a serious threat to human health.<ref name="web" >{{cite web|title=Web site of the Journal of Gene Medicine|url=http://www.wiley.co.uk/genether- apy/clinical|accessdate=Aug 2003}}</ref>  Therefore, [[adenovirus]] vectors can be statistically considered as a safe for OA gene therapy.

Another serious adverse event occurred in children with fatal [[X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency]] caused by a mutation in one chain of a [[cytokine receptor]]. They were successfully treated by an ex vivo procedure in which a retrovirus was used to transfer a wild-type copy of the affected gene to the subjects’ [[hematopoietic stem cells]]. However, two of the children developed [[leukemia]]. This seems to be the result of the insertion of the retrovirus near an oncogene. Overall, retroviruses have been the most widely used vectors for gene transfer to humans and no other records of adverse effect exist related to use of this vector. <ref name=web /> 
The majority of experiences in transferring gene to humans justifies that this method can be accomplished safely, however a great deal of attention should be paid to preparation protocols.
