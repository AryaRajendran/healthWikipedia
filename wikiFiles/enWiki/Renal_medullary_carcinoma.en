'''Renal medullary carcinoma''' is a rare type of [[cancer]] that affects the [[kidney]].  It tends to be aggressive, difficult to treat, and is often [[metastatic]] at the time of diagnosis.  Most individuals with this type of cancer have [[sickle cell trait]] or rarely [[sickle cell disease]], suggesting that the sickle cell trait may be a risk factor for this type of cancer.

== Classification ==
Renal medullary carcinoma has been termed "the seventh [[sickle cell]] nephropathy" because it is found almost exclusively in individuals with [[sickle cell trait]] or occasionally in those with [[sickle cell disease]].<ref name="Davis CJ">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000478-199501000-00001 |author=Davis CJ, Mostofi FK, Sesterhenn IA |title=Renal medullary carcinoma. The seventh sickle cell nephropathy |journal=Am. J. Surg. Pathol. |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=7528470 }}</ref>

== Medical signs and symptoms ==
In a case series of 34 patients, Davis and colleagues reported the following signs and symptoms:
* macroscopically visible (gross) [[hematuria]] (60%)
* abdominal or back/flank pain (50%)
* significant weight loss (25%)
Other researchers have reported a palpable renal mass<ref name="Assad L">{{cite journal |author=Assad L, Resetkova E, Oliveira VL, ''et al'' |title=Cytologic features of renal medullary carcinoma |journal=Cancer |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=28–34 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15593260 |doi=10.1002/cncr.20764 }}</ref> or enlarged [[lymph nodes]].<ref name="Warren KE">{{cite journal |author=Warren KE, Gidvani-Diaz V, Duval-Arnould B |title=Renal medullary carcinoma in an adolescent with sickle cell trait |journal=Pediatrics |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=E22 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=9925868 |doi= 10.1542/peds.103.2.e22|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9925868}}</ref>

== Causes/genetics ==
The etiology of renal medullary carcinoma is still not completely understood.  However, the majority of individuals diagnosed with this type of cancer have had [[sickle cell trait]], in which the person carries one normal copy of the [[hemoglobin A]] gene (HbA) and one copy of the hemoglobin A gene harboring the [[genetic mutation]] found in [[sickle cell disease]] (HbS).  These individuals do not have [[sickle cell disease]] but can manifest symptoms such as [[nephropathy|kidney damage]] over the course of their lives.  The other genetic or environmental factors that contribute to the risk of renal medullary carcinoma are unknown.

== Mechanism ==
The finding that virtually all people affected by renal medullary carcinoma carry at least one copy of the HbS mutation suggests that sickle cell trait somehow predisposes to this type of cancer.<ref name="Davis CJ" /> The precise mechanism is unknown, however [[red blood cells]] with a [[sickle cell]] configuration have been identified in pathology specimens.<ref name="Warren KE" />

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of renal medullary carcinoma is typically made after individuals with sickle cell trait present with the typical signs and symptoms outlined above, in combination with [[radiology|radiographic imaging]] (usually abdominal/pelvic [[computed tomography|CT scan]]) studies and ultimately surgical [[biopsy]] and [[pathology|pathological examination]] of the tumor.  Findings on radiographic examination are non-specific and can reveal a mass deep within the kidney.<ref name="Baig MA">{{cite journal |author=Baig MA, Lin YS, Rasheed J, Mittman N |title=Renal medullary carcinoma |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=98 |issue=7 |pages=1171–4 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16895289 |pmc=2569460 |doi= |url=}}</ref> [[Histopathology]] studies show a distinctive pattern that can be distinguished from other renal tumors.<ref name="Assad L" />

== Prevention ==
Renal medullary carcinoma is extremely rare and it is not currently possible to predict those individuals with sickle cell trait who will eventually develop this cancer.  It is hoped that early detection could result in better outcomes but screening is not feasible.

== Management ==
This cancer is typically [[malignant|aggressive]], presents at an advanced stage when the cancer has already [[metastasize]]d, and is resistant to [[chemotherapy]].  It therefore poses a significant management challenge.<ref name="Avery RA">{{cite journal |author=Avery RA, Harris JE, Davis CJ, Borgaonkar DS, Byrd JC, Weiss RB |title=Renal medullary carcinoma: clinical and therapeutic aspects of a newly described tumor |journal=Cancer |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=128–32 |year=1996 |month=July |pmid=8646708 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960701)78:1<128::AID-CNCR18>3.0.CO;2-1 |url=}}</ref>  Current treatment options include [[surgery|surgical resection]] and chemotherapy with a variety of agents, including (but not limited to) [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], [[carboplatin]], and [[topotecan]].<ref name="Pirich LM">{{cite journal |author=Pirich LM, Chou P, Walterhouse DO |title=Prolonged survival of a patient with sickle cell trait and metastatic renal medullary carcinoma |journal=J.

== Prognosis ==
Since the cancer most often presents at an advanced stage, prognosis is generally very poor, with median survival times of 3 months (range 1–7 months).<ref name="Avery RA" />  Longer survival of beyond one year was reported in one patient<ref name="Pirich LM" /> and of up to eight years in one individual whose tumor was well circumscribed and non-metastatic at the time of diagnosis,<ref name="Watanabe IC">{{cite journal |author=Watanabe IC, Billis A, Guimarães MS, ''et al'' |title=Renal medullary carcinoma: report of seven cases from Brazil |journal=Mod.

== Epidemiology ==
As of 2009, there have been approximately 120 reported cases of renal medullary carcinoma.<ref>Tsaras, Geoffrey, Amma Owusu-Ansah, Freda Owusua Boateng, and Yaw Amoateng-Adjepong. "Complications Associated with Sickle Cell Trait: A Brief Narrative Review." The American Journal of Medicine 122.6 (2009): 507-12. PubMED.

[[Wilms' tumor]], the most common renal tumor of childhood, is responsible for 6-7% of childhood cancer whereas all remaining primary renal tumors (among which is included renal medullary carcinoma) collectively account for less than 1% of all childhood cancer and less than 10% of primary kidney tumors in childhood.<ref name="Broecker B">{{cite journal |author=Broecker B |title=Non-Wilms' renal tumors in children |journal=Urol.

== History ==
Renal medullary carcinoma was first described as a clinicopathologic entity in 1995.<ref name="Davis CJ" />
