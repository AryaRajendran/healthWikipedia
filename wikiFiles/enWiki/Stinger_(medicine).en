In [[medicine]], a '''stinger''', also called a ''burner'' or ''[[Radiculopathy|nerve]] pinch injury'', is a [[neurological]] [[injury]] suffered by [[sportsperson|athlete]]s, mostly in high-[[Contact sport|contact]] [[sport]]s such as [[ice hockey]], [[basketball]], [[rugby league football]], [[rugby union]], [[american football]], [[wrestling]], and [[roller derby]]. The injury is always a [[vertebral column|spine]] injury as opposed to more serious [[spinal cord]] injuries, which can lead to partial or total [[paralysis]]. It is characterized by a shooting or stinging [[pain]] that travels down one arm, followed by numbness and weakness. Many athletes in contact sports have suffered stingers, but they are often unreported to medical professionals due to their minor symptoms and high frequency in sports.

== Mechanism ==
The injury usually involves nerves traveling from the [[spinal cord]] to the arm, but sometimes involves [[nerve]]s in the neck. This happens in one of two ways: either the head and neck are forced toward the shoulder, compressing the nerves that lead from the spinal cord to that arm, or the head and neck are forced away from the shoulder, stretching those nerves. It is for this reason that stingers do not affect both arms simultaneously, however it is possible for both arms to accrue injuries. Symptoms often disappear within minutes and usually within hours, however, repeated nerve [[Physical trauma|trauma]] can cause recurring stingers, [[chronic pain]], and [[muscle]] weakness.

== Diagnosis and treatment ==
Stingers are best [[diagnosis|diagnosed]] by a medical professional. This person will assess the athlete's pain, range of head and neck motion, arm numbness, and muscle strength. Often, the affected athlete is allowed to return to play within a short time, but persistent symptoms will result in removal. Athletes are also advised to receive 
regular evaluations until symptoms have ceased. If they have not after two weeks, or increase, additional tests such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) can be performed to detect a more serious injury, such as a [[herniated disc]].

The order of treatments applied depends on whether the athlete's main complaint is pain or weakness. Both can be treated with an [[analgesic]], [[anti-inflammatory]] [[medication]], ice and heat, restriction of movement, and if necessary, [[cervical collar]] or traction. [[Surgery]] is only necessary in the most severe cases.

== Prevention ==
Stingers can be prevented by wearing protective gear, such as [[Butterfly restrictor|butterfly restrictors]], designed to protect the head and neck from being forced into unnatural positions. This equipment is more feasible in positions where unrestricted head and neck movement is not required, such as [[Lineman (American football)|American football lineman]], than in positions like [[quarterback]], where such movement is integral. Regardless of equipment, it is important to report even minor symptoms to a trainer or team physician, and to allow appropriate recovery time.{{cn|date=January 2013}}
