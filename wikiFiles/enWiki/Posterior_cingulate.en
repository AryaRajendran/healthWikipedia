The '''posterior cingulate cortex''' is the backmost part of the [[cingulate cortex]], lying behind the [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. 
This is the upper part of the "[[limbic lobe]]".  The cingulate cortex is made up of an area around the midline of the [[brain]]. Surrounding areas include the [[retrosplenial cortex]] and the [[precuneus]]. 

[[Cytoarchitectonics|Cytoarchitectonically]] the posterior cingulate cortex is associated with [[Brodmann area]]s [[Brodmann area 23|23]] and [[Brodmann area 31|31]].

The posterior cingulate cortex forms a central node in the "default mode" network of the brain. Along with the precuneus, it has been implicated as a neural substrate for human awareness in numerous studies of both the anesthesized and vegetative (coma) state. Imaging studies indicate a prominent role for the posterior cingulate cortex in pain and episodic memory retrieval.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Nielsen FA, Balslev D, Hansen LK | title=Mining the posterior cingulate: segregation between memory and pain components | journal=NEUROIMAGE  | volume=27 | issue=3 | year=2005 | pages=520–532 | id= | pmid=15946864 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.04.034}}</ref> It is also been revealed that increased size of posterior ventral cingulate cortex is related to the working memory performance decline. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Kozlovskiy SA, Vartanov AV, Nikonova EY, Pyasik MM, Velichkovsky BM | year = 2012 | title = The Cingulate Cortex and Human Memory Processes | url = | journal = Psychology in Russia: State of the Art | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 231–243 | doi = 10.11621/pir.2012.0014 }}</ref> Furthermore, the posterior cingulate may be involved in the capacity to understand what other people believe.<ref><span class="citation web"
