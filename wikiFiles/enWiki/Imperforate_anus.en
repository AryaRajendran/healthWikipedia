An '''imperforate anus''' or '''anorectal malformations (ARMs)''' are [[birth defects]] in which the [[rectum]] is malformed. ARMs are a spectrum of different congenital anomalies in males and females, that varies from fairly minor lesions, as well as complex anomalies.<ref>Holshneider AM, Hutson JM Editors. (2006). "Anorectal Malformations in Children". Springer-Verlag Berlin</ref> The cause of ARMs is unknown, the genetic basis of these anomalies is very complex because of their anatomical variability, in an 8% of patients genetic factors are clearly associated with ARMs.<ref>Moore SW. (2006). In: Holshneider AM, Hutson JM Editors. "Anorectal Malformations in Children". Springer-Verlag Berlin, pp 31-48</ref> Anorectal Malformation in Currarino Syndrome represent the only association for which the gene HLXB9 has been identified.<ref>Martucciello G. (2006). In: Holshneider AM, Hutson JM Editors. "Anorectal Malformations in Children". Springer-Verlag Berlin, pp 17-30</ref>

==Features==
There are several forms of imperforate anus and anorectal malformations.The new classification is in relation of the type of associated fistula.<ref>Pena A, Levitt MA. (2006) "Anorectal Malformations" in: Grosfeld et al. Ed. "Pediatric Surgery", Mosly</ref>
The classical classification was in low,and high anomalies:
* A low [[lesion]], in which the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] remains close to the skin.  In this case, there may be a [[stenosis]] (narrowing) of the anus, or the anus may be missing altogether, with the [[rectum]] ending in a blind pouch.
* A high lesion, in which the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] is higher up in the [[pelvis]] and there is a [[fistula]] connecting the rectum and the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], [[urethra]] or the [[vagina]].
* A [[persistent cloaca]] (from the term [[cloaca]], an analogous orifice in [[reptile]]s and [[amphibians]]), in which the rectum, vagina and urinary tract are joined into a single channel.
Imperforate anus is usually present along with other birth defects&mdash;[[vertebral column|spinal]] problems, [[heart]] problems, [[tracheoesophageal fistula]], [[esophageal atresia]], [[kidney|renal]] anomalies, and [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] anomalies are among the possibilities.<ref>Colorectal Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. "[http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/info/abdomen/diagnose/anorectal-malformations-imperforate-anus.htm Anorectal Malformations / Imperforate Anus]." Retrieved July, 2005.</ref>

==Associated anomalies==
Imperforate anus is associated with an increased incidence of some other specific anomalies as well, together being called the [[VACTERL association]]:
* V - [[Vertebral anomalies]]
* A - ''Anal atresia''
* C - [[Cardiovascular anomalies]]
* T - [[Tracheoesophageal fistula]]
* E - [[Esophageal atresia]]
* R - [[Kidney|Renal (Kidney)]] and/or [[Radius (bone)|radial]] anomalies
* L - Limb defects

== Diagnosis ==
When an infant is born with an anorectal malformation, it is usually detected quickly as it is a very obvious defect. Doctors will then determine the type of birth defect the child was born with and whether or not there are any associated malformations. It is important to determine the presence of any associated defects during the newborn period in order to treat them early and avoid further [[sequela]]e.  There are two main categories of anorectal malformations: those that require a protective [[colostomy]] and those that do not. The decision to open a colostomy is usually taken within the first 24 hours of birth.

[[Sonography]] can be used to determine the type of imperforate anus.<ref name="pmid18029895">{{cite journal |author=Haber HP, Seitz G, Warmann SW, Fuchs J |title=Transperineal sonography for determination of the type of imperforate anus |journal=AJR.  American journal of roentgenology |volume=189 |issue=6 |pages=1525–9 |year=2007 |pmid=18029895 |doi=10.2214/AJR.07.2468}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Imperforate anus usually requires immediate [[surgery]] to open a passage for [[feces]] unless a [[fistula]] can be relied on until corrective surgery takes place. Depending on the severity of the imperforate, it is treated either with a perineal [[anoplasty]]<ref name="pmid11719868">{{cite journal |author=Becmeur F, Hofmann-Zango I, Jouin H, Moog R, Kauffmann I, Sauvage P |title=Three-flap anoplasty for imperforate anus: results for primary procedure or for redoes |journal=European Journal of Pediatric Surgery|volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=311–4 |year=2001 |pmid=11719868 |doi=10.1055/s-2001-18555}}</ref> or with a [[colostomy]].

==Prognosis==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
With a high lesion, many children have problems controlling bowel function and most also become [[constipation|constipated]]. With a low lesion, children generally have good bowel control, but they may still become constipated.

For children who have a poor outcome for continence and constipation from the initial surgery, further surgery to better establish the angle between the anus and the rectum may improve continence and, for those with a large rectum, surgery to remove that dilated segment may significantly improve the bowel control for the patient.  An antegrade enema mechanism can be established by joining the appendix to the skin (Malone stoma); however, establishing more normal anatomy is the priority.

==Epidemiology==
Imperforate anus has an estimated incidence of 1 in 5000 births.<ref>Texas Pediatric Associates. "[http://www.pedisurg.com/PtEduc/Imperforate_Anus.htm Imperforate anus]." Retrieved 13 July 2005.</ref><ref>MedLine Plus. "[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001147.htm Imperforate anus]." Retrieved 13 July 2005.</ref> It affects boys and girls with similar frequency.<ref name="pmid15523860">{{cite journal |author=Adotey JM, Jebbin NJ |title=Anorectal disorders requiring surgical treatment in the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Port Harcourt |journal=Nigerian journal of medicine : journal of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=350–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15523860 |doi=}}</ref>  However, imperforate anus will present as the low version 90% of the time in females and 50% of the time in males.

Imperforate anus is an occasional complication of [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]].<ref name="pmid12617452">{{cite journal |author=Bhat NA, Mathur M, Bhatnagar V |title=Sacrococcygeal teratoma with anorectal malformation |journal=Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=27 |year=2003 |pmid=12617452 |doi=}}</ref>
