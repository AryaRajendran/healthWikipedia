'''Shared care''' involves the establishment of partnerships between professionals and laymen where they share a common goal. For example: the improvement in the health of a patient where there is [[patient empowerment]] to take a major degree of responsibility for his or her care, or an arrangement where the life of a disadvantaged person is improved by the joint efforts of a [[social service]] and an outside lay provider. To be true "shared" care, the partnership is a genuinely equal one with neither partner being subservient nor superior. Shared care is a term largely used in [[health care]] and [[social care]] in [[Great Britain]].

==In social care of children==
Shared care is used in a social context to describe the activities of organisations that provide short breaks for disadvantaged children or those that help enlist families for short term fostering.  In each case there is significant input from the non-professional supervised by the professional.<ref>Birmingham Council Social Services Department - http://www.birmingham.gov.uk</ref> The practice is widespread with examples throughout the country of this usage, with clients from all age groups and types of disabilities or social problems.

The [[Child Support Agency]] uses the term for a very specific purpose: "it refers to each of the separated parents having the children with them part of the time, so that direct expenditure is shared too."<ref>"[http://www.childsupportanalysis.co.uk/analysis_and_opinion/shared_care/shared_care_summary.htm Child support & Shared Care - overview].

==In general health care==
In a more mainstream health orientated context the term can be used for the schemes involving [[patient empowerment]], targeted at medical problems as [[substance abuse]] and [[diabetes]], and in [[complementary medicine]] for such therapies as [[hypnosis]] or [[Alexander Technique]] where the therapist is an enabler rather than a paternalistic prescriber. Indeed Alexander Technique practitioners call themselves "teachers".
