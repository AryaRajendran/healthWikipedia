'''Factor IX''' (or '''Christmas factor''') ({{EC number|3.4.21.22}}) is one of the [[serine protease]]s of the [[coagulation]] system; it belongs to peptidase family S1. Deficiency of this protein causes [[Haemophilia B|hemophilia B]]. It was discovered in 1952 after a young boy named [[Stephen Christmas]] was found to be lacking this exact factor, leading to [[hemophilia]].<ref name="PMD12997790">{{cite journal | last1 = Biggs | first1 = R | last2 = Douglas | first2 = AS | last3 = MacFarlane | first3 = RG | last4 = Dacie | first4 = JV | last5 = Pitney | first5 = WR | title = Christmas Disease | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 4799 | pages = 1378–82 | year = 1952 | pmid = 12997790 | pmc = 2022306 | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4799.1378}}</ref>

Factor IX is produced as a [[zymogen]], an inactive precursor.  It is processed to remove the [[signal peptide]], [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] and then cleaved by [[factor XI]]a (of the contact pathway) or [[factor VII]]a (of the tissue factor pathway) to produce a two-chain form where the chains are linked by a [[disulfide bridge]].<ref name="pmid659613">{{cite journal |author=Di Scipio RG, Kurachi K, Davie EW |title=Activation of human factor IX (Christmas factor) |journal=J.

Factor IX is inhibited by [[antithrombin]].<ref name="pmid659613" />

Factor IX expression increases with age in humans and mice. In mouse
models mutations within the promoter region of factor IX have an
age-dependent phenotype.<ref name="pmid7662969">{{cite journal |author=Boland EJ, Liu YC, Walter CA, Herbert DC, Weaker FJ, Odom MW, Jagadeeswaran P |title=Age-specific regulation of clotting factor IX gene expression in normal and transgenic mice |journal=Blood |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=2198–205 |year=1995 |pmid=7662969}}</ref>

== Domain architecture ==

[[Factor VII|Factors VII]], IX, and [[Factor X|X]] all play key roles in [[blood coagulation]] and also share a common domain architecture.<ref name="pmid11723140">{{cite journal |author=Zhong D, Bajaj MS, Schmidt AE, Bajaj SP |title=The N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domain in factor IX and factor X represents an important recognition motif for binding to tissue factor |journal=J.

These are the [[Gla domain]], two tandem copies of the [[EGF-like domain|EGF domain]] and a C-terminal trypsin-like peptidase domain which carries out the catalytic cleavage.

[[Image:Factor IX.png|thumb|Human factor IX protein domain architecture where each protein domain is represented by a coloured box.|400px|left]]

The N-terminal EGF domain has been shown to at least in part be responsible for binding [[Tissue factor]].<ref name="pmid11723140"/> Wilkinson ''et al''. conclude that residues 88 to 109 of the second EGF domain mediate binding to platelets and assembly of the Factor X activating complex.<ref name="pmid11714704">{{cite journal |author=Wilkinson FH, Ahmad SS, Walsh PN |title=The factor IXa second epidermal growth factor (EGF2) domain mediates platelet binding and assembly of the factor X activating complex |journal=J.

The structures of all four domains have been solved.  A structure of the two EGF domains and trypsin like domain was determined for the pig protein.<ref name="pmid7568220">{{cite journal |author=Brandstetter H, Bauer M, Huber R, Lollar P, Bode W |title=X-ray structure of clotting factor IXa: active site and module structure related to Xase activity and hemophilia B |journal=Proc.

Several structures of 'super active' mutants have been solved <ref name="pmid20004170">{{cite journal |author=Zogg T, Brandstetter H,  |title=Structural Basis of the Cofactor- and Substrate-Assisted Activation of Human Coagulation Factor Ixa |journal=Structure |volume=17 |pages=1669–1678 |year=2009 |pmid=20004170 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2009.10.011 |url=}}</ref> which reveal the nature of Factor IX activation by other proteins in the clotting cascade.

== Genetics ==

The [[gene]] for factor IX is located on the [[X chromosome]] (Xq27.1-q27.2) and is therefore [[X-linked recessive]]: mutations in this gene affect males much more frequently than females. It was first cloned in 1982 by Kotoku Kurachi and Earl Davie.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kurachi K, Davie E |title=Isolation and characterization of a cDNA coding for human factor IX |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=79 |issue=21 |pages=6461–4 |year=1982 |pmid=6959130 |doi=10.1073/pnas.79.21.6461 |pmc=347146}}</ref>

[[Polly and Molly|Polly]], a transgenic cloned [[Poll Dorset]] sheep carrying the gene for factor IX, was produced by Dr [[Ian Wilmut]] at the [[Roslin Institute]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nicholl D. |title=An Introduction to Genetic Engineering Second Edition | publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=257 |year=2002}}</ref>

== Role in disease ==

Deficiency of factor IX causes Christmas disease ([[hemophilia B]]).<ref name="PMD12997790" /> Over 100 mutations of factor IX have been described; some cause no symptoms, but many lead to a significant bleeding disorder. The original Christmas disease mutation was identified by sequencing of Christmas' DNA, revealing a mutation which changed a cysteine to a serine.<ref>{{cite pmid|1615485}}</ref>
[[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] factor IX is used to treat Christmas disease, and is commercially available as BeneFIX.<ref name="urlHome: BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant) Official Site">{{cite web |url=http://www.benefix.com/ |title=Home: BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant) Official Site |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Some rare mutations of factor IX result in elevated clotting activity, and can result in clotting diseases, such as [[deep vein thrombosis]].<ref name="pmid19846852">{{cite journal | author = Simioni P, Tormene D, Tognin G, Gavasso S, Bulato C, Iacobelli NP, Finn JD, Spiezia L, Radu C, Arruda VR | title = X-linked thrombophilia with a mutant factor IX (factor IX Padua) | journal = N.

Factor IX deficiency is treated by injection of purified factor IX produced through cloning in various animal or animal cell vectors. [[Tranexamic acid]] may be of value in patients undergoing surgery who have inherited factor IX deficiency in order to reduce the perioperative risk of bleeding.<ref name="pmid21712351">{{cite journal | author = Rossi M, Jayaram R, Sayeed R | title = Do patients with haemophilia undergoing cardiac surgery have good surgical outcomes? | journal = Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 320–31 | year = 2011 | month = September | pmid = 21712351 | doi = 10.1510/icvts.2011.272401 }}</ref>
