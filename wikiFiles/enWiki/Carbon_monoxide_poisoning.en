'''Carbon monoxide poisoning''' occurs after enough inhalation of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas, but, being colorless, odorless, tasteless, and initially non-irritating, it is very difficult for people to detect. Carbon monoxide is a product of [[incomplete combustion]] of organic matter due to insufficient [[oxygen]] supply to enable complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). It is often produced in domestic or industrial settings by older motor vehicles and other gasoline-powered tools, heaters, and cooking equipment. Exposures at 100 [[parts per million|ppm]] or greater can be dangerous to human health.<ref name="Prockop"/>

Symptoms of mild acute poisoning include lightheadedness, confusion, [[headache]]s, [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and [[flu|flu-like]] effects; larger exposures can lead to significant toxicity of the [[central nervous system]] and [[heart]], and even death. Following acute poisoning, long-term [[sequela]]e often occur. Carbon monoxide can also have severe effects on the [[fetus]] of a pregnant woman. Chronic exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide can lead to [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[confusion]], and [[memory loss]]. Carbon monoxide mainly causes adverse effects in humans by combining with [[hemoglobin]] to form [[carboxyhemoglobin]] (HbCO) in the blood. This prevents hemoglobin from releasing oxygen in tissues,  effectively reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Additionally, [[myoglobin]] and mitochondrial [[cytochrome oxidase]] are thought to be adversely affected. Carboxyhemoglobin can revert to hemoglobin, but the recovery takes time because the HbCO complex is fairly stable.

Treatment of poisoning largely consists of administering 100% oxygen or providing [[hyperbaric oxygen]] therapy, although the optimum treatment remains controversial.<ref name="ToxicolRev2005-buckley">{{cite journal|author=Buckley NA, Isbister GK, Stokes B, Juurlink DN|title=Hyperbaric oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning: a systematic review and critical analysis of the evidence|journal=Toxicological Reviews|year=2005|pages=75–92|volume=24|issue=2|pmid=16180928|doi=10.2165/00139709-200524020-00002}}</ref> Oxygen works as an [[antidote]] as it increases the removal of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin, in turn providing the body with normal levels of oxygen. The prevention of poisoning is a significant public health issue. Domestic carbon monoxide poisoning can be prevented by early detection with the use of household [[carbon monoxide detector]]s. Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal poisoning in many countries.<ref name="Toxicology2002-omaye">{{cite journal | author=Omaye ST | title=Metabolic modulation of carbon monoxide toxicity | journal=Toxicology | year=2002 | pages=139–50 | volume=180 | issue=2 | pmid=12324190 | doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00387-6 | month=Nov}}</ref> Historically, it was also commonly used as a method to commit [[suicide]], usually by deliberately inhaling the exhaust fumes of a running car engine. Modern automobiles, even with electronically-controlled combustion and [[catalytic converter]]s, can still produce levels of carbon monoxide which will kill if enclosed within a garage or if the tailpipe is obstructed (for example, by snow) and exhaust gas cannot escape normally. Carbon monoxide poisoning has also been implicated as the cause of apparent haunted houses; symptoms such as delirium and hallucinations have led people suffering poisoning to think they have seen ghosts or to believe their house is haunted.<ref name="Donnay">{{cite web|title=A True Tale Of A Truly Haunted House|author=Albert Donnay|publisher=Ghostvillage.com|date=October 31, 2004|url=http://www.ghostvillage.com/resources/2004/resources_10312004.shtml|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref>

One classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in the dead rather than the living - people have been described as looking pink-cheeked and healthy. However, since this "cherry-red" appearance is common only in the deceased, and is unusual in living people, it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine. In pathological (autopsy) examination the ruddy appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because unembalmed dead persons are normally bluish and pale, whereas dead carbon-monoxide poisoned persons may simply appear unusually lifelike in coloration.<ref name="Bateman"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Simini B|title=Cherry-red discolouration in carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Lancet| volume=352|issue=9134| pages=1154|year=1998| month=October|pmid=9798630|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79807-X}}</ref><ref name="JEmergMed2002-brooks">{{cite journal|author=Brooks DE, Lin E, Ahktar J|title=What is cherry red, and who cares?|journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine|year=2002|pages=213–214|volume=22|issue=2|pmid=11858933|doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00469-3|month=February}}</ref> The colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in the commercial meat-packing industry.

== Pathophysiology ==

The precise mechanisms by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.<ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/> Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]], and carbon monoxide causing [[brain]] [[lipid peroxidation]].<ref name="Weaver-NEJM"/><ref name="Bateman">{{cite journal|author=Bateman DN|title=Carbon Monoxide|journal=Medicine|volume=31|issue=10|pages=233|year=2003|month=October|doi=10.1383/medc.31.10.41.27810}}</ref><ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/>

=== Hemoglobin ===
[[File:Hb saturation curve.png|thumb||Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left.]]
Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is [[heme oxygenase]] which is located in all cells and breaks down heme.  Under normal conditions carbon monoxide levels in the plasma are approximately 0 mmHg because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made.<ref name=Kaplan.Physio>{{cite book|title=USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes: Physiology|year=2011|author=Dunn, Robert B.|coauthors=Kudrath, W., Passo S.S., Wilson, L.B.|pages=167–168|chapter=7-3}}</ref>   When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.<ref name="Bateman"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Townsend CL, Maynard RL|title=Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=59|issue=10|pages=708–711|year=2002|month=October|pmid=12356933|pmc=1740215|doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708|url=}}</ref><ref name="JPhysiol1895-Haldane">{{cite journal|author=Haldane J|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1895|pages=430–462|volume=18|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|pmid=16992272|issue=5-6|pmc=1514663}}</ref>

Hemoglobin is a [[Tetrameric protein|tetramer]] with four oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon monoxide at one of these sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue.<ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman">{{cite journal|author=Gorman D, Drewry A, Huang YL, Sames C|title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|year=2003|pages=25–38|volume=187|issue=1|pmid=12679050|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2|month=May}}</ref> This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen dissociation curve]] to the left.<ref name="Bateman"/> Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, the blood oxygen content is increased. But because all the oxygen stays in the hemoglobin, none is delivered to the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury.<ref name="goldfranks"/> Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.

=== Myoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide also binds to the [[hemeprotein]] [[myoglobin]]. It has a high affinity for myoglobin, about 60 times greater than that of oxygen.<ref name="goldfranks"/> Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen.<ref name="Bateman"/> This causes reduced [[cardiac output]] and [[hypotension]], which may result in [[brain ischemia]].<ref name="goldfranks"/> A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.<ref name="Toxicology2002-omaye"/>

=== Cytochrome oxidase ===

Another mechanism involves effects on the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to [[cytochrome oxidase]] with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorman DF, Runciman WB |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=506–11 |year=1991 |month=November |pmid=1750629 |doi= |url=}}</ref> This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient [[adenosine triphosphate]] synthesis.

=== Central nervous system effects ===

The mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain [[lipid peroxidation]] (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes [[endothelial]] cell and platelet release of [[nitric oxide]], and the formation of [[oxygen free radicals]] including [[peroxynitrite]].<ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/> In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, [[capillary]] leakage, [[leukocyte]] sequestration, and [[apoptosis]].<ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal">{{cite journal|author=Blumenthal I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|year=2001|pages=270–272|volume=94|issue=6|pmid=11387414|month=June|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11387414|format=Free full text|pmc=1281520}}</ref> The result of these effects is [[lipid peroxidation]], which causes delayed reversible [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinization]] of [[white matter]] in the central nervous system known as [[Grinker myelinopathy]], which can lead to [[edema]] and [[necrosis]] within the brain.<ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/> This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period.

=== Pregnancy ===

Carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse [[fetus|fetal]] effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by decreasing the release of maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the [[placenta]] and combines with [[fetal hemoglobin]], causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15[[Percent sign|%]] higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult.<ref name="Toxicology2002-omaye"/> Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical.<ref name="Greingor">{{cite journal|author=Greingor JL, Tosi JM, Ruhlmann S, Aussedat M|title=Acute carbon monoxide intoxication during pregnancy.

This carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.<ref name="goldfranks"/> The ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs/day may have levels up to 9%.<ref name="Clinical toxicology2001-ford">{{cite book|editor=Ford MD, Delaney KA, Ling LJ, Erickson T|title=Clinical toxicology|year=2001|page=1046|publisher=WB Saunders Company|isbn=0-7216-5485-1}}</ref>

As people may continue to experience significant symptoms of CO poisoning long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of poisoning) does not rule out poisoning.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Keleş A, Demircan A, Kurtoğlu G|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning: how many patients do we miss?|journal=European Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=15|issue=3|pages=154–157|year=2008|month=June|pmid=18460956|doi=10.1097/MEJ.0b013e3282efd519}}</ref>

However, many of these devices require the user to inhale deeply and hold their breath to allow the CO in the blood to escape into the lung before the measurement can be made.

===Detection in biological specimens===
Carbon monoxide may be quantitated in blood using [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] methods or [[chromatography|chromatographic techniques]] in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure. Carboxyhemoglobin blood saturations may range up to 8-10% in heavy smokers or persons extensively exposed to automotive exhaust gases. In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10-30% range, while persons who succumb may have postmortem blood levels of 30-90%.<ref>Sato K, Tamaki K, Hattori H, et al.

The United States [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] has stated, "carbon monoxide detectors are as important to home safety as smoke detectors are," and recommends each home have at least one carbon monoxide detector, and preferably one on each level of the building.<ref name="cpsc.gov"/> These devices, which are relatively inexpensive<ref name="Krenzelok EP"/> and widely available, are either battery- or AC-powered, with or without battery backup.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Edward R|title=Keeping Watch on Carbon Monoxide|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=February 14, 1999|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref> In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment.

The use of carbon monoxide detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the USA, NFPA 720-2009,<ref name="NFPA720-2009">{{cite book|last=|first=|title=NFPA 720: Standard for the Installation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detection and Warning Equipment|publisher=National Fire Protection Agency|location=Quincy, MA|year=2009|pages=|isbn=}}</ref> the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]], mandates the placement of carbon monoxide detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels.<ref name="NFPA720-2009"/> NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings. These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes and other non-residential buildings, includes three main points:<ref name="NFPA720-2009"/>
:1. A secondary power supply (battery backup) must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours,
:2. Detectors must be on the ceiling in the same room as permanently installed fuel-burning appliances, and
:3. Detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every [[HVAC]] zone of the building.

=== Legal requirements ===

The NFPA standard is not necessarily enforced by law.  As of April 2006, the U.S. state of Massachusetts require detectors to be present in all residences with potential CO sources, regardless of building age and whether they are owner-occupied or rented.<ref>[http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2 MGL Ch. 148 §28F{{frac|1|2}} - Nicole's Law, effective March 31, 2006 ]</ref>  This is enforced by municipal inspectors, and was inspired by the death of 7-year-old Nicole Garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent.<ref>http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html</ref>  Other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale.

Despite similar deaths in vehicles with clogged exhaust pipes (for example in the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] and [[February 2013 nor'easter]]) and the commercial availability of the equipment, there is no legal requirement for automotive CO detectors.

=== Equipment maintenance ===
Gas organizations will often recommend to get gas appliances serviced at least once a year.<ref name="Gas Safe Register (UK Government Organization)">{{cite journal|author=Official Website |title=UK Gas Safe Register: Being Gas Safe|Information correct as of: February 2012|url=http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx}}</ref>  

=== Scuba divers ===
The effects of carbon monoxide in [[breathing gas]] are increased in proportion to the depth, as the partial pressure of the contaminant is increased in proportion to the depth for a given gas fraction. 

Breathing air for underwater divers should be supplied from a compressor system that has been tested for for carbon monoxide contamination. The permitted levels of carbon monoxide in breathing gas for diving is lower than for at atmospheric pressure due to the concentrating effect of raised ambient pressure. 

Compressor owners can ensure that their breathing gas has is within the accepted limits by using real time monitors that sample the output from the compressor, and can reduce the risk of contamination by using [[Hopcalite]] catalyst in the filtration system. Divers who intend to use air from suppliers who are not legally required to test the air, or have a dubious reputation for air quality, can use hand held CO analysers specifically designed for testing scuba breathing gas prior to diving.{{facts|date=February 2013}}

===Recommended World Health Organisation (WHO) Air Quality guidelines for Europe 2000===
The following guideline values (ppm values rounded) and periods of time-weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level of 2.5% is not exceeded, even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise:
* 100&nbsp;mg/m3 (87 ppm) for 15 min
* 60&nbsp;mg/m3 (52 ppm) for 30 min
* 30&nbsp;mg/m3 (26 ppm) for 1 h
* 10&nbsp;mg/m3 (9 ppm) for 8 h

===Recommended WHO European Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality 2010===
* 7&nbsp;mg/m3  (6 ppm) for 24 h (so as not to exceed 2% COHb for chronic exposure)
