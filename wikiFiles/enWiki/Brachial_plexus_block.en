'''[[Brachial plexus]] block'''s are [[Regional anaesthesia|regional anesthesia]] techniques that are sometimes employed as an alternative to [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] for [[surgery]] of the [[shoulder]], [[arm]], [[forearm]], [[wrist]] and [[hand]]. These techniques involve the [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] of [[local anesthetic]] agents in close proximity to the brachial plexus, temporarily blocking the [[Sensory nerve|sensation]] and [[Motor neuron|ability to move]] the upper extremity. The subject can remain awake during the ensuing surgical procedure, or s/he can be [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|sedated]] or even [[General anaesthesia|fully anesthetized]] if necessary.

There are several techniques for [[nerve block|blocking]] the [[nerve]]s of the brachial plexus. These techniques are classified by the level at which the [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] or [[catheter]] is inserted for injecting the local anesthetic — interscalene block on the neck, [[Supraclavicular fossa|supraclavicular]] block immediately above the [[clavicle]], [[Infraclavicular fossa|infraclavicular]] block below the clavicle and axillary block in the [[axilla]] (armpit).<ref name=Wolfe2011/>

==Indications==
General anesthesia may result in [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], undesirable decreases in [[cardiac output]], [[central nervous system depression]], [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depression]], loss of protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), need for [[tracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]], and residual anesthetic effects. The most important advantage of brachial plexus block is that it allows for the avoidance of general anesthesia and therefore its attendant complications and [[side effect]]s. Although brachial plexus block is not without risk, it is usually less invasive and affects fewer organ systems than general anesthesia.<ref name=Boedeker1995/> Brachial plexus blockade may be a reasonable option when all of the following criteria are met:{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* Surgery is expected to be limited to a region between the midpoint of the shoulder and the [[finger]]s
* There are no contraindications to a block such as [[infection]] at the intended injection site, significant [[Bleeding diathesis|bleeding disorder]], [[anxiety]], [[Allergic reactions to anaesthesia|allergy]] or [[hypersensitivity]] to local anesthetics
* There will not be a need to perform an [[neurological examination|examination of the function]] of the blocked nerves immediately following the surgical procedure
* The patient prefers this technique over [[Informed consent|other available]] and reasonable approaches

==Anatomy==
{{Main|Brachial plexus}}

The brachial plexus is formed by the [[Anterior ramus of spinal nerve|ventral rami]] of [[Cervical spinal nerve 5|C5]]-[[Cervical spinal nerve 5|C6]]-[[Cervical spinal nerve 5|C7]]-[[Cervical spinal nerve 5|C8]]-[[Thoracic spinal nerve 1|T1]], occasionally with small contributions by [[Cervical spinal nerve 4|C4]] and [[Thoracic spinal nerve 2|T2]]. There are multiple approaches to blockade of the brachial plexus, beginning proximally with the interscalene block and continuing distally with the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks. The concept behind all of these approaches to the brachial plexus is the existence of a sheath encompassing the [[neurovascular bundle]] extending from the [[deep cervical fascia]] to slightly beyond the borders of the axilla.<ref name=Wolfe2011/>

==Techniques==
Brachial plexus block is typically performed by an [[anesthesiologist]]. To achieve an optimal block, the tip of the needle should be close to the nerves of the plexus during the injection of local anesthetic solution. Commonly employed techniques for obtaining such a needle position include transarterial, elicitation of a [[paresthesia]], and use of a [[peripheral nerve stimulator]] or a [[portable ultrasound]] scanning device.<ref name=Winnie1990/> If the needle is close to or contacts a nerve, the subject may experience a paresthesia (a sudden tingling sensation, often described as feeling like "pins and needles" or like an electric shock) in the arm, hand, or fingers. Injection close to the point of elicitation of such a paresthesia may result in a good block.<ref name=Winnie1990/> A peripheral nerve stimulator connected to an appropriate needle allows emission of electrical current from the needle tip. When the needle tip is close to or contacts a [[Efferent nerve fiber|motor nerve]], characteristic contraction of the innervated [[Skeletal striated muscle|muscle]] may be elicited.<ref name=Winnie1990/> Modern portable ultrasound devices allow the user to visualize internal [[anatomy]], including the nerves to be blocked, neighboring anatomic structures and the needle as it approaches the nerves. Observation of local anesthetic surrounding the nerves during ultrasound-guided injection is predictive of a successful block.<ref name=Kapral1994/> Appropriate block per site-specific procedure are listed in the following table:<ref name=Morgan2006/>

===Interscalene block===
[[File:Interscalene block.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Left: the red line corresponds to the course of the [[subclavian artery]], while the yellow line represents the brachial plexus and the "X" represents the site of entry of the needle when performing an interscalene block. Right: diagram of the course of the brachial plexus in relation to other important anatomic structures in the right side of the neck.]]

The interscalene block is performed by injecting local anesthetic to the nerves of the brachial plexus as it passes through the groove between the [[Scalenus anterior|anterior]] and [[Scalenus medius|middle]] [[scalene muscles]], at the level of the [[cricoid cartilage]]. This block is particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative [[Analgesic|analgesia]] for surgery to the clavicle, shoulder, and arm. Advantages of this block include rapid blockade of the shoulder region, and relatively easily [[palpation|palpable]] anatomical landmarks. Disadvantages of this block include inadequate anesthesia in the distribution of the [[ulnar nerve]], which makes this an unreliable block for operations involving the forearm and hand.<ref name=Wolfe2011/>

;Side effects
Temporary [[paresis]] (impairment of the function) of the [[thoracic diaphragm]] occurs in virtually all people who have undergone interscalene or supraclavicular brachial plexus block. Significant respiratory impairment can be demonstrated in these people by [[pulmonary function testing]].<ref name=Finucane2007/> In certain people — such as those with severe [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] — this can result in [[respiratory failure]] requiring [[tracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] until the block dissipates.<ref name=Neal2007/>

[[Horner's syndrome]] may be observed if the local anesthetic solution tracks cephalad and blocks the [[stellate ganglion]]. This may be accompanied by [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]] and [[vocal cord paresis]]. These signs and symptoms are transient however, and do not commonly result in any long-term problems.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

;Contraindications
Contraindications include severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,<ref name=Neal2007/> and paresis of the [[phrenic nerve]] on the opposite side as the block.<ref name=Amutike1998/>

===Supraclavicular block===
Providing a rapid onset of dense anesthesia of the arm with a single injection, the supraclavicular block is ideal for operations involving the arm and forearm, from the lower [[humerus]] down to the hand. The brachial plexus is most compact at the level of the trunks formed by the C5–T1 [[nerve root]]s, so nerve block at this level has the greatest likelihood of blocking all of the branches of the brachial plexus. This results in rapid onset times and, ultimately, high success rates for surgery and analgesia of the upper extremity, excluding the shoulder.<ref name=Macfarlane2009/>

Surface landmarks can be used to identify the appropriate location for injection of local anesthetic, which is typically [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right .28lateral.29.2C and medial|lateral]] to (outside) the lateral border of the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|above]] the clavicle, with the [[first rib]] generally considered to represent the limit below which the needle must not be directed (the [[pleural cavity]] and uppermost part of the [[Human lung|lung]] are located at this level). Palpation or ultrasound visualization of the [[subclavian artery]] just above the clavicle provides a useful anatomic landmark for locating the brachial plexus, which is lateral to the artery at this level.<ref name=Macfarlane2009/> Proximity to the brachial plexus can be determined using by elicitation of a paresthesia, use of a peripheral nerve stimulator, or ultrasound guidance.<ref name=DeTran2007/>

Compared to the interscalene block, the supraclavicular block — despite eliciting a more complete block of the [[Median nerve|median]], [[Radial nerve|radial]] [[ulnar nerve|ulnar]] and [[musculocutaneous nerve|musculocutaneous]] nerves — does not improve postoperative analgesia. However, the supraclavicular block is often quicker to perform and may result in fewer side effects than the interscalene block. Compared to the infraclavicular block and axillary blocks, the successful achievement of adequate anesthesia for surgery of the upper extremity is about the same with supraclavicular block.<ref name=DeTran2007/>

Unlike the interscalene block — which results in diaphragmatic hemiparesis in all subjects — only half of those who undergo supraclavicular block experience this side effect. Disadvantages of the supraclavicular block include the risk of [[pneumothorax]], which is estimated to be between 1%{{ndash}}4% when using paresthesia or peripheral nerve stimulator guided techniques. Ultrasound guidance allows the operator to visualize the first rib and the pleura, thereby helping to ensure that the needle does not puncture the pleara; this presumably reduces the risk of pneumothorax.<ref name=DeTran2007/>

===Infraclavicular block===
[[File:Infraclavicular block.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Left: the red line corresponds to the course of the [[subclavian artery]], while the yellow line represents the brachial plexus and the "X" represents the site of entry of the needle when performing an infraclavicular block. Right: diagram of the course of the brachial plexus in relation to other important anatomic structures in the right [[infraclavicular fossa]].]]

For infraclavicular block, current evidence suggests that — when using a peripheral nerve stimulator for nerve localization — a double-stimulation technique is better than a single-stimulation technique. When compared to a multiple-stimulation axillary block, infraclavicular block provides similar efficacy. However it may be associated with a shorter performance time and less procedure-related pain for the patient.<ref name=DeTran2007/>

===Axillary block===
[[File:Axillary block.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Left: the red line corresponds to the course of the [[axillary artery]], while the "X" represents the site of entry of the needle when performing an axillary block. Right: diagram of the course of the axillary artery in relation to the brachial plexus in the right [[axilla]].]]

The axillary block is particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The axillary block is also the safest of the four main approaches to the brachial plexus, as it does not risk paresis of the phrenic nerve, nor does it have the potential to cause [[pneumothorax]].<ref name=Satapathy2011/> In the axilla, the nerves of the brachial plexus and the [[axillary artery]] are enclosed together in a [[Axillary sheath|fibrous sheath]] which is a continuation of the [[deep cervical fascia]]. The easily palpated axillary artery thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic close to this artery frequently leads to a good block of the brachial plexus. The axillary block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.<ref name=Winnie1990/>

Disadvantages of the axillary block include inadequate anesthesia in the distribution of the musculocutaneous nerve. This nerve supplies motor function to the [[biceps]], [[Brachialis muscle|brachialis]], and [[coracobrachialis muscle|coracobrachialis]] muscles and [[Lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm|one of its branches]] supplies sensation to the skin of the forearm. If the musculocutaneous nerve is missed, it may be necessary to block this nerve separately. This can be accomplished by using a peripheral nerve stimulator to identify the location of the nerve as it passes through the coracobrachialis muscle. The [[intercostobrachial nerve]]s (which are branches of the second and third [[intercostal nerves]]) are also frequently missed with the axillary block. Because these nerves supply sensation to the skin of the [[Human_anatomical_terms#Near_or_away_from_the_vertical_longitudinal_center_of_the_body|medial]] and [[Human_anatomical_terms#Front_and_back|posterior]] aspects of the arm and axilla, a [[tourniquet]] on the arm may be poorly tolerated in such cases. [[Subcutaneous injection]] of local anesthetic over the medial aspect of the arm in the axilla helps patients tolerate an arm tourniquet by blocking these nerves.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Single-injection techniques provide unreliable blockade in the areas supplied by the musculocutaneous and radial nerves. Current evidence suggests that a triple-stimulation technique — with injections on the musculocutaneous, [[Median nerve|median]] and [[Radial nerve|radial]] nerves — is the best technique for the axillary block.<ref name=DeTran2007/>

==Methods of nerve localization==
Despite the fact that people have been performing brachial plexus blocks for over a hundred years,<ref name=Kulenkampff1911/> there is as yet no clear evidence to support the assertion that one method of nerve localization is better than another. There are however numerous case reports documenting cases in which use of a portable ultrasound scanning device has detected abnormal anatomy that would otherwise not have been evident using a "blind" approach. On the other hand, use of ultrasound may create a false sense of security in the operator, which may lead to errors, especially if the needle tip is not adequately visualized at all times.<ref name=Macfarlane2009/>

For interscalene block, it is not clear whether nerve stimulation provides a better interscalene block than elicitation of paresthesiae.<ref name=DeTran2007/> However, a recent study using ultrasound to follow the spread of local anesthetic demonstrated an improved success rate of the block (relative to blocks done with nerve stimulator alone) even at the inferior roots of the plexus.<ref name=Wolfe2011/>

For supraclavicular block, nerve stimulation with a minimal threshold of 0.9 mA can offer a dependable block.<ref name=DeTran2007/> Although ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block has been shown to be a safe alternative to the peripheral nerve stimulator guided technique, there is little evidence to support that ultrasound guidance provides a better block, or is associated with fewer complications.<ref name=Macfarlane2009/> There is some evidence to suggest that the use of ultrasound guidance in combination with nerve stimulation can shorten the performance time of supraclavicular block.<ref name=DeTran2007/>

For axillary block, success rates are greatly improved with multiple injection techniques whether using nerve stimulation or ultrasound guidance.<ref name=Satapathy2011/>

==Special situations==
The duration of a "single-shot" brachial plexus block is highly variable, commonly lasting anywhere from 45&nbsp;minutes to 24&nbsp;hours. The block can be extended by placing an indwelling [[catheter]], which may be connected to a mechanical or electronic [[infusion pump]] for continuous administration of local anesthetic solution. A catheter may be inserted at the interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular or axillary location, depending on the desired location of nerve block. The infusion of local anesthetic can be programmed to be a continuous flow or [[patient-controlled analgesia]]. In some cases, people can maintain the catheters and infusions at home after release from the facility where the surgery was performed.<ref name=Wolfe2011/>

==Complications==
As with any procedure involving disruption of the integrity of the skin, brachial plexus block can be associated with [[infection]] or [[bleeding]]. In people who are using anticoagulant agents, there is a greater risk of complications related to bleeding.<ref name=Wolfe2011/>

Complications associated with brachial plexus block include intra-arterial or intravenous injection, which can lead to [[local anesthetic toxicity]]. This may be characterized by serious central nervous system problems such as [[epileptic seizure]], [[central nervous system depression]], and [[coma]].<ref name=Mulroy2002/> Cardiovascular effects of local anesthetic toxicity include [[bradycardia|slowing of the heart rate]] and impairment of its ability to pump blood through the circulatory system, which may lead to [[circulatory collapse]]. In severe cases, [[cardiac dysrhythmia]], [[cardiac arrest]] and death may occur.<ref name=Mather2005/> Other rare but serious complications from brachial plexus block include pneumothorax and persistent paresis of the [[phrenic nerve]].<ref name=Urmey2009/>

Complications associated with interscalene and supraclavicular blocks include inadvertent [[subarachnoid space|subarachnoid]] or [[Epidural space|epidural]] injection of local anesthetic, which can result in respiratory failure.<ref name=Urmey2009/>

Because of the close proximity of the lung to the brachial plexus at the level of the clavicle, the complication most often associated with this block is pneumothorax — with a risk as high as 6.1%.<ref name=Macfarlane2009/> Further complications of supraclavicular block include subclavian artery puncture, and spread of local anesthetic to cause paresis of the stellate ganglion, the phrenic nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve.<ref name=Macfarlane2009/>

==Alternatives==
Depending on the circumstances, alternatives to brachial plexus block may include [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]], [[Anesthesia_awareness#Conscious_sedation_and_monitored_anesthesia_care|monitored anesthesia care]], [[Intravenous regional anesthesia|Bier block]], or [[local anesthesia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==History==
In 1855, [[Friedrich Gaedcke]] (1828{{ndash}}1890) became the first to chemically isolate [[cocaine]], the most potent [[alkaloid]] of the [[coca]] plant. Gaedcke named the compound "erythroxyline".<ref name=Gaedcke1855/><ref name=Zaunick1956/> In 1884, Austrian [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|Karl Koller]] (1857{{ndash}}1944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles.<ref name=Koller1884/> His findings were presented a few weeks later at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society.<ref name=Karch2006/> The following year, [[William Stewart Halsted|William Halsted]] (1852{{ndash}}1922) performed the first brachial plexus block.<ref name=Halsted1885/><ref name=Crile1897/> Using a surgical approach in the neck, Halsted applied cocaine to the brachial plexus.<ref name=Borgeat2006/> In January 1900, [[Harvey Williams Cushing|Harvey Cushing]] (1869{{ndash}}1939) — who was at that time one of Halsted's [[Residency (medicine)|surgical residents]] — applied cocaine to the brachial plexus prior to dividing it, during a [[forequarter amputation]] for [[sarcoma]].<ref name=Cushing1902/>

The first [[percutaneous]] supraclavicular block was performed in 1911 by German surgeon [[Diedrich Kulenkampff]] (1880{{ndash}}1967).<ref name=Kulenkampff1911/> Just as his older colleague [[August Bier]] (1861{{ndash}}1949) had done with [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal anesthesia]] in 1898,<ref name=Bier1899/> Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block.<ref name=Kulenkampff1911/> Later that year, [[Georg Hirschel]] (1875{{ndash}}1963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla.<ref name=Hirschel1911/> In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the [[Fowler's position|sitting position]] or in the [[supine position]] with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above the midpoint of the clavicle where the pulse of the [[subclavian artery]] could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic [[spinous process]].<ref name=Kulenkampff1928/>

By the late 1940s, clinical experience with brachial plexus block in both peacetime and wartime surgery was extensive,<ref name=dePablo1948/> and new approaches to this technique began to be described. For example, In 1946, F. Paul Ansbro was the first to describe a continuous brachial plexus block technique. He secured a needle in the supraclavicular fossa and attached tubing connected to a syringe through which he could inject incremental doses of local anesthetic.<ref name=Ansbro1946/> The subclavian perivascular block was first described by Winnie and Collins in 1964.<ref name=Winnie1964/> This approach became popular due to its lower risk of pneumothorax compared to the traditional Kulenkampff approach. The infraclavicular approach was first developed by Raj.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1977, Selander described a technique for continuous brachial plexus block using an intravenous catheter secured in the axilla.<ref name=Selander1977/>
