'''Pleurisy''' (also known as '''pleuritis''') is an [[inflammation]] of the [[pleura]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000083443|pleurisy}}</ref> the lining of the [[pleural cavity]] surrounding the [[lung]]s. Among other things, infections are the most common cause of pleurisy.

The inflamed pleural layers rub against each other every time the lungs expand to breathe in air. This can cause severe sharp [[pain]] with inhalation (also called pleuritic [[chest pain]]).

== Symptoms ==
The main symptom of pleurisy is a sharp, stabbing pain in the chest that gets worse with deep breathing, [[coughing]], [[sneezing]], or [[laughing]]. The pain may stay in one place, or it may spread to the shoulder or back. Sometimes, it becomes a fairly constant dull ache.

Depending on its cause, pleurisy may be accompanied by other symptoms:
* Coughing, which may produce blood

* [[Fever]] and chills
* Rapid, shallow breathing
* [[Shortness of breath]]
* [[Sore throat]] followed by pain and swelling in the joints
* [[Ventricular tachycardia]]

== Causes ==
[[Viral infection]] is the most common cause of pleurisy. However, many different conditions can cause pleurisy:
* [[Aortic dissection]]s
* [[Autoimmune disorder]]s such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (or [[drug-induced lupus erythematosus]]) and [[rheumatoid arthritis]]
* [[Bacterial infection]]s such as [[pneumonia]] and [[tuberculosis]]
* Chest injuries
* [[Familial Mediterranean fever]], an inherited condition that often causes fever and swelling in the abdomen or the lungs
* Fungal or parasitic infections
* [[Heart surgery]], especially [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary-artery bypass grafting]]
* High blood pressure
* [[Inflammatory bowel disease]]
* [[Lung cancer]] and [[lymphoma]]
* Other lung diseases like [[Cystic Fibrosis]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[asbestosis]], [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]], and [[mesothelioma]]
* [[Pneumothorax]]
* [[Pulmonary Embolism|Pulmonary embolisms]], which are blood clots that enter the lungs

Some cases of pleurisy are [[idiopathic]], which means that the cause cannot be determined.  Other cases can occur with no illness or infection.

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnosis of pleurisy or another pleural condition is based on a [[Medical Histories|medical history]], [[Physical Examination|physical examination]]s, and diagnostic tests. The goals are to rule out other sources of the symptoms and to find the cause of the pleurisy so that the underlying disorder can be treated.

=== Physical examination ===
A doctor uses a [[stethoscope]] to listen to the breathing. This method detects any unusual sounds in the lungs. A person with pleurisy may have inflamed layers of the pleura that make a rough, scratchy sound as they rub against each other during breathing. This is called [[pleural friction rub]].

=== Diagnostic tests ===
Depending on the results of the physical examination, diagnostic tests are sometimes performed.

==== Chest x-ray ====
A [[Chest X-Ray|chest x-ray]] takes a picture of the heart and lungs. It may show air or fluid in the pleural space. It also may show the cause (e.g. pneumonia, a fractured rib, or a lung tumor) of the pleurisy.

Sometimes an x-ray is taken while lying on the painful side. This may show fluid, as well as changes in fluid position, that did not appear in the vertical x-ray.

==== Computed tomography (CT) scan ====
A [[CT Scan|CT scan]] provides a computer-generated picture of the lungs that can show pockets of fluid. It also may show signs of pneumonia, a lung abscess, or a tumor.

==== Ultrasound ====
[[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] uses sound waves to create an image. It may show where fluid is located in the chest. It also can show some tumors. Although ultrasound may detect fluid around the lungs, also known as a pleural effusion, sound waves cannot penetrate bone. Therefore, an actual picture of the lungs cannot be obtained with ultrasonography.

==== Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) ====
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), also called [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) scanning, uses powerful magnets to show [[pleural effusion]]s and tumors.

==== Blood Test ====
[[Blood Test|Blood test]]s can detect [[Bacterial Infection|bacterial]] or [[Viral Infection|viral]] infections, [[pneumonia]], [[Rheumatic Fever|rheumatic fever]], a pulmonary embolism, or [[lupus]].

==== Arterial Blood Gas ====
In [[Arterial Blood Gas|arterial blood-gas sampling]], a small amount of blood is taken from an [[Arteries|artery]], usually in the wrist. The blood is then checked for [[oxygen]] and [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon-dioxide]] levels. This test shows how well the lungs are taking in oxygen.

==== Thoracentesis ====
[[File:Thoracentesis.jpg|thumb|The illustration shows a person undergoing [[thoracentesis]]. The person sits upright and leans on a table. Excess fluid from the pleural space is drained into a bag.]]
Once the presence and location of fluid is confirmed, a sample of fluid can be removed for testing. The procedure to remove fluid in the chest is called [[thoracentesis]]. The doctor inserts a small needle or a thin, hollow, plastic tube in the chest wall and withdraws fluid.

Thoracentesis can be done in the doctor's office or at the hospital. Ultrasound is used to guide the needle to the fluid that is trapped in small pockets around the lungs.

Thoracentesis usually does not cause serious complications. Generally, a chest x-ray is done after the procedure to evaluate the lungs. Possible complications of thoracentesis include the following:
* [[Bleeding]] and [[bruising]] where the needle went in. In rare cases, bleeding may occur in or around the lung. The doctor can use a chest tube to drain the blood. In some cases, surgery is needed.
* Infection where the needle went in
* Injury to the liver or spleen (in rare cases)
* Pain
* [[Pneumothorax]], or buildup of air in the pleural space, with a collapsed or partially collapsed lung. Sometimes air comes in through the needle or the needle makes a hole in the lung. Usually, a hole will seal itself. But sometimes air can build up around the lung and make it collapse. A chest tube can remove the air and let the lung expand again.

The lung fluid is examined under a microscope and is evaluated for the presence of chemicals and for its color and texture. The degree of clarity is an indicator of infection, cancer, or other conditions that may be causing the buildup of fluid or blood in the pleural space.

==== Biopsy ====
If tuberculosis or cancer is suspected, a small piece of the pleura may be examined under a microscope to make a definitive diagnosis. This is called a [[biopsy]].

Several approaches to taking tissue samples are available
# Insertion of a needle through the skin on the chest to remove a small sample of the outer layer of the pleura.
# Insertion of a small tube with a light on the end ([[endoscope]]) into tiny cuts in the chest wall in order to visualize the pleura. Small pieces of tissue can be biopsied though the endoscope.
# remove a sample of the pleura through a small cut in the chest wall. This is called an open pleural biopsy. It is usually done if the sample from the needle biopsy is too small for an accurate diagnosis.

== Treatment ==
Treatment has several goals:
* Relief of symptoms
* Removal of the fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space
* Treatment of the underlying condition

=== Procedures ===

If large amounts of fluid, air, or blood are not removed from the pleural space, they may cause the lung to collapse.

The surgical procedures used to drain fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space are as follows:

* During thoracentesis, a needle or a thin, hollow, plastic tube is inserted through the ribs in the back of the chest into the chest wall. A syringe is attached to draw fluid out of the chest. This procedure can remove more than 6 cups (1.5 litres) of fluid at a time.
* When larger amounts of fluid must be removed, a chest tube may be inserted through the chest wall. The doctor injects a local painkiller into the area of the chest wall outside where the fluid is. A plastic tube is then inserted into the chest between two ribs. The tube is connected to a box that suctions the fluid out. A chest x-ray is taken to check the tube's position.
* A chest tube also is used to drain blood and air from the pleural space. This can take several days. The tube is left in place, and the patient usually stays in the hospital during this time.
* Sometimes the fluid contains thick pus or blood clots, or it may have formed a hard skin or peel. This makes it harder to drain the fluid. To help break up the pus or blood clots, the doctor may use the chest tube to put certain medicines into the pleural space. These medicines are called [[fibrinolytic]]s. If the pus or blood clots still do not drain out, surgery may be necessary.

=== Medications ===
A couple of medications are used to relieve pleurisy symptoms:
* [[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) or [[NSAID|anti-inflammatory agents]] to control pain and decrease inflammation. Only [[indomethacin]] (brand name Indocin) has been studied with respect to relief of pleurisy.<ref name="pmid6207594">{{cite journal |author=Klein RC |title=Effects of indomethacin on pleural pain |journal=South. Med. J. |volume=77 |issue=10 |pages=1253â€“4 |year=1984 |month=October |pmid=6207594 |doi= 10.1097/00007611-198410000-00011|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0038-4348&volume=77&issue=10&spage=1253}}</ref>
* [[Codeine]]-based [[cough syrup]]s to control a cough

There may be a role for the use of [[corticosteroids]] (for tuberculous pleurisy), [[tacrolimus]] (Prograf) and [[methotrexate]] (Trexall, Rheumatrex) in the treatment of pleurisy. Further studies are needed.

=== Lifestyle changes ===
The following may be helpful in the management of pleurisy:
* Lying on the painful side may be more comfortable
* Breathing deeply and coughing to clear mucus as the pain eases. Otherwise, [[pneumonia]] may develop.
* Getting rest

=== Treating the cause ===
Ideally, the treatment of pleurisy is aimed at eliminating the underlying cause of the disease.
* If the pleural fluid is infected, treatment involves antibiotics and draining the fluid. If the infection is tuberculosis or from a fungus, treatment involves long-term use of antibiotics or antifungal medicines.
* If the fluid is caused by tumors of the pleura, it may build up again quickly after it is drained. Sometimes antitumor medicines will prevent further fluid buildup. If they don't, the doctor may seal the pleural space. This is called [[pleurodesis]]. Pleurodesis involves the drainage of all the fluid out of the chest through a chest tube. A substance is inserted through the chest tube into the pleural space. This substance irritates the surface of the pleura. This causes the two layers of the pleura to squeeze shut so there is no room for more fluid to build up.
* [[Chemotherapy]] or [[radiotherapy|radiation treatment]] also may be used to reduce the size of the tumors.
* If [[congestive heart failure]] is causing the fluid buildup, treatment usually includes diuretics and other medicines.

The most common and known treatment for pleurisy is generally to carry on as normal, ibuprofen and amoxicilin being common treatments prescribed by doctors. Milder forms of Pleurisy can be noticed by less inflammatres of the arms and legs. If this is the case Pleurisy will clear of all symptoms within two weeks.

=== Alternative treatments ===
A number of alternative or complementary medicines are being investigated for their anti-inflammatory properties, and their use in pleurisy. At this time, clinical trials of these compounds have not been performed.

Extracts from the Brazilian folk remedy ''[[Wilbrandia ebracteata]]'' ("Taiuia") have been shown to reduce inflammation in the pleural cavity of mice.<ref name="pmid10403502">{{cite journal |author=Peters RR, Saleh TF, Lora M, ''et al.'' |title=Anti-inflammatory effects of the products from Wilbrandia ebracteata on carrageenan-induced pleurisy in mice |journal=Life Sci. |volume=64 |issue=26 |pages=2429â€“37 |year=1999 |pmid=10403502 |doi= 10.1016/S0024-3205(99)00200-3|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0024320599002003}}</ref><ref name="pmid17286991">{{cite journal |author=Siqueira JM, Peters RR, Gazola AC, ''et al.'' |title=Anti-inflammatory effects of a triterpenoid isolated from Wilbrandia ebracteata Cogn |journal=Life Sci. |volume=80 |issue=15 |pages=1382â€“7 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17286991 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.12.021 |url=}}</ref>

== Related problems ==
Pleurisy is often associated with complications that affect the pleural space.

=== Pleural effusion ===
In some cases of pleurisy, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. This is called a [[pleural effusion]]. The buildup of fluid usually forces the two layers of the pleura apart so they don't rub against each other when breathing. This can relieve the pain of pleurisy. A large amount of extra fluid can push the pleura against the lung until the lung, or a part of it, collapses. This can make it hard to breathe.

In some cases of pleural effusion, the extra fluid gets infected and turns into an [[abscess]]. This is called an [[empyema]].

Pleural effusion involving [[fibrin]]ous exudates in the fluid may be called fibrinous pleurisy. It sometimes occurs as a later stage of pleurisy.

A person can develop a pleural effusion in the absence of pleurisy. For example, pneumonia, heart failure, cancer, or a pulmonary embolism can lead to a pleural effusion.

=== Pneumothorax ===
Air or gas also can build up in the pleural space. This is called a [[pneumothorax]]. It can result from acute lung injury or a lung disease like [[emphysema]]. Lung procedures, like surgery, drainage of fluid with a needle, examination of the lung from the inside with a light and a camera, or mechanical ventilation, also can cause a pneumothorax.

The most common symptom is sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath. A pneumothorax also can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse.

If the pneumothorax is small, it may go away on its own. If large, a chest tube is placed through the skin and chest wall into the pleural space to remove the air.

=== Hemothorax ===
Blood also can collect in the pleural space. This is called [[hemothorax]]. The most common cause is injury to the chest from blunt force or surgery on the heart or chest. Hemothorax also can occur in people with lung or pleural cancer.

Hemothorax can put pressure on the lung and force it to collapse. It also can cause shock, a state of [[hypoperfusion]] in which an insufficient amount of blood is able to reach the organs.

== Prognosis ==
Pleurisy and other disorders of the pleura can be serious, depending on what caused the inflammation in the pleura.

If the condition that caused the pleurisy or other pleural disorders isn't too serious and is diagnosed and treated early, one usually can expect a full recovery.
