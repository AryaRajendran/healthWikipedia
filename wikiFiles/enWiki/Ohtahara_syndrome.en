'''Ohtahara syndrome''' (OS), also known as '''Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy with Burst-Suppression''' (EIEE), is a [[Progressive illness|progressive]] [[epilepsy|epileptic]] [[encephalopathy]]. The syndrome is outwardly characterized by tonic spasms and partial seizures, and receives its more elaborate name from the pattern of burst activity on an [[electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG).  It is an extremely debilitating progressive neurological disorder, involving intractable seizures and severe [[mental retardation]]. No single cause has been identified, although in many cases structural brain damage is present.<ref name = ninds1>{{Cite web | last = National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke | title = NINDS Ohtahara Syndrome Information Page | date = 5 December 2008 | accessdate = 2009-03-10 | url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/ohtahara/ohtahara.htm}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
Ohtahara syndrome is rare and the earliest-appearing age-related epileptic encephalophy, with seizure onset occurring within the first three months of life, and often in the first ten days.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ohtahara S |title=[On the specific age dependent epileptic syndrome: the early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst] |journal=No to Hattatsu |volume=8 |pages=270–9 |year=1976 |language=Japanese |author-separator=, |author2=Ishida T |author3=Oka E |display-authors=3 |author4=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref> Many, but not all, cases of OS evolve into other seizure disorders, namely [[West syndrome]] and [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]].<ref name = ninds1 /> 

The primary outward manifestation of OS is seizures, usually presenting as tonic seizures (a generalized seizure involving a sudden stiffening of the limbs).<ref name = epcom1>{{Cite web | last=Holmes|first=Gregory L.|publisher = Epilepsy.com/Professionals | title = Tonic | date=January 2004 | url = http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/generalized_tonic.html | accessdate = 2007-11-26}}</ref>  Other seizure types that may occur include [[partial seizure]]s, clusters of infantile spasms, and, rarely, [[myoclonus|myoclonic seizures]]. In addition to seizures, children with OS exhibit profound mental and physical retardation.

Clinically, OS is characterized by a “burst suppression” pattern on an EEG. This pattern involves high voltage spike wave discharge followed by little brain wave activity.<ref name = ninds1 />

It is named for the Japanese neurologist Shunsuke Ohtahara (1930&ndash; ), who identified it in 1976.

==Causes and treatment==
No single cause of OS has been identified. In most cases, there is severe atrophy of both [[cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres]] of the brain. Less often, the root of the disorder is an underlying metabolic syndrome. Although it was initially published that no genetic connection had been established,<ref>{{Cite web | last = Nabbout | first = Rima | title = Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy | date=July 2004|format=PDF| url = http://www.orpha.net/data/patho/Pro/en/EarlyInfantileEpilepticEncephalopathy-FRenPro889.pdf}}</ref> several genes have since associated with Ohtahara syndrome. It can be associated with mutations in ''[[Aristaless related homeobox|ARX]]'',<ref>{{OMIM|308350}}</ref><ref name="pmid17668384">{{cite journal |author=Kato M |title=A Longer Polyalanine Expansion Mutation in the ARX Gene Causes Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy with Suppression-Burst Pattern (Ohtahara Syndrome) |journal=Am.

Treatment outlook is poor. [[Anticonvulsant]] drugs and [[glucocorticoid]] steroids may be used to try to control the seizures, but their effectiveness is limited. Most therapies are related to symptoms and day-to-day living.<ref name="ninds1" />

When the cause of the seizures is a malformation of either the left or right hemisphere of the brain then a surgical procedure, a functional [[hemispherectomy]], can significantly improve the developmental outcome of the child and even completely stop the seizures.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Notable cases==
Ivan Cameron, son of [[David Cameron]], leader of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and Prime Minister of the UK, was born with the condition. He died aged six on 25 February 2009, while his father was still opposition leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7909562.stm|title=Cameron's 'beautiful boy' dies|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=2009-03-10|publisher=BBC News Online}}</ref>
