--> among infants and young children.<ref name="pmid11052397"/> It is a [[genus]] of [[double-stranded RNA virus]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Reoviridae]]. By the age of five, nearly every child in the world has been infected with rotavirus at least once.<ref name="pmid19252423"/> However, with each infection, [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] develops, and subsequent infections are less severe; adults are rarely affected.<ref name="pmid18838873"/>  There are five [[species]] of this virus, referred to as A, B, C, D, and E.<ref>[http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp ICTV Virus Taxonomy: 2009 Release]</ref> Rotavirus A, the most common, causes more than 90% of infections in humans.

The virus is transmitted by the [[fecal-oral route|faecal-oral route]]. It infects and damages the [[enterocyte|cells]] that line the [[small intestine]] and causes [[gastroenteritis]] (which is often called "stomach flu" despite having no relation to [[influenza]]). Although rotavirus was discovered in 1973<ref name="pmid19799704"/> and accounts for up to 50% of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children,<ref name="pmid16397429"/> its importance is still not widely known within the [[public health]] community, particularly in [[developing country|developing countries]].<ref name="pmid17919334"/> In addition to its impact on human health, rotavirus also infects animals, and is a [[pathogen]] of livestock.<ref name="isbn0-12-375158-6"/>

Rotavirus is usually an easily managed disease of childhood, but worldwide nearly 500,000 children under five years of age still die from rotavirus infection each year<ref name="pmid22030330"/> and almost two million more become severely ill.<ref name="pmid17919334"/> In the United States, before initiation of  the rotavirus vaccination programme, rotavirus caused about 2.7&nbsp;million cases of severe gastroenteritis in children, almost 60,000 hospitalisations, and around 37 deaths each year.<ref name="pmid17357047"/> Public health campaigns to combat rotavirus focus on providing [[oral rehydration therapy]] for infected children and [[vaccination]] to prevent the disease.<ref name="pmid18026034"/> The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have added rotavirus vaccine to their routine childhood immunisation policies.<ref name="pmid21734466"/><ref name="pmid20622508"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a mild to severe disease characterised by [[vomiting]], watery [[diarrhoea]], and low-grade [[fever]]. Once a child is infected by the virus, there is an [[incubation period]] of about two days before symptoms appear.<ref name="pmid10532018">{{cite journal

The virus enter cells by [[endocytosis|receptor mediated endocytosis]] and form a [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] known as an [[endosome]]. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating a difference in the [[Calcium in biology|calcium]] concentration. This causes the breakdown of VP7 [[Trimer (biochemistry)|trimer]]s into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA, forming a double-layered particle (DLP).<ref name="pmid20397068">{{cite journal|author=Baker M, Prasad BV |title=Rotavirus cell entry |journal=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology|volume=343|pages=121–48|year=2010 |pmid=20397068 |doi=10.1007/82_2010_34}}</ref>

The eleven dsRNA strands remain within the protection of the two protein shells and the viral [[RNA replicase|RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]]creates mRNA transcripts of the double-stranded viral genome. By remaining in the core, the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses called [[RNA interference]] that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.

During the infection, rotavirus produces mRNA for both [[protein biosynthesis]] and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The [[Offspring|progeny]] viruses are released from the cell by [[cell lysis|lysis]].<ref name="pmid15010218">{{cite journal |author=Jayaram H, Estes MK, Prasad BV |title=Emerging themes in rotavirus cell entry, genome organization, transcription and replication |journal=Virus Res. |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=67–81 |year=2004|pmid=15010218|doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2003.12.007}}</ref><ref name="pmid15579070">{{cite journal

The diarrhoea is caused by multiple activities of the virus. [[Malabsorption]] occurs because of the destruction of gut cells called [[enterocyte]]s. The [[enterotoxin|toxic]] rotavirus protein [[NSP4 (rotavirus)|NSP4]] induces age- and [[calcium]] ion-dependent [[chloride]] secretion, disrupts [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|SGLT1]] [[Membrane transport protein|transporter]]-mediated reabsorption of water, apparently reduces activity of [[Brush border|brush-border membrane]] [[disaccharidase]]s, and possibly activates the calcium ion-dependent [[secretion|secretory]] [[reflex]]es of the [[enteric nervous system]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gregorini|first=L|coauthors=Marco, J, Bernies, M, Cassagneau, B, Pomidossi, G, Anguissola, GB, Fajadet, J|title=The alpha-1 adrenergic blocking agent urapidil counteracts postrotational atherectomy "elastic recoil" where nitrates have failed.|journal=The American journal of cardiology|date=1997 Apr 15|volume=79|issue=8|pages=1100-3|pmid=9114772}}</ref> Healthy enterocytes secrete [[lactase]] into the small intestine; milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection,<ref name="pmid18492865">{{cite journal|author=Farnworth ER |title=The evidence to support health claims for probiotics |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=138 |issue=6|pages=1250S–4S |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18492865 |doi= |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18492865}}</ref> which can persist for weeks.<ref name="pmid12811680">{{cite journal

[[Clinical trials]] in the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] serious [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]].<ref name="pmid10219046">{{cite journal
