The '''use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s''' in the [[sport]] of [[American football]] has been an ongoing issue since the late 1980s, especially in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The NFL began to test players for steroid use during the 1987 season, and started to issue suspensions to players during the 1989 season.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/27/SPG9AM0RPD1.DTL |title=Steroids spotlight turns to football |last=Gay |first=Nancy |date=27 October 2006 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> The NFL has issued as many as six random [[drug test]]s to players, with each player receiving at least one drug test per season.<ref name="Smith">{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDB1E3DF930A35754C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=N.F.L.'s Steroid Policy Too Lax, Doctor Warns |last=Smith |first=Timothy |date=3 July 1991 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> One notable incident was when in 1992, when player [[Lyle Alzado]] died from brain cancer, which he attributed to the use of anabolic steroids,<ref name=Lyle>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Alzado_Lyle.html |title=Not the size of the dog in the fight |accessdate=2007-07-05 |last=Puma |first=Mike |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> however, Alzado's doctors stated that anabolic steroids did not contribute to his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elitefitness.com/articledata/hbosteroids/HBO-Real-Sports-steroid-special.avi |publisher=elitefitness.com |title=Real Sports, Lyle Alzado |accessdate=2007-04-24}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref><!--This needs a better source-->

The use of performance enhancing drugs has also been found in other levels of football, including [[college football|college level]], and high school.<ref name="Portland">{{cite news |url= http://www.portlandtribune.com/sports/story.php?story_id=29338 |title= NCAA athletes on the juice? |accessdate=2008-05-02 |last= Eggers |first= Kerry |newspaper=Portland Tribune}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> The most recent figures from the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)]] football drug tests show that one percent of all NCAA football players failed drug tests taken at [[bowl game]]s, and three percent have admitted to using steroids overall.<ref name="Portland"/> In the NCAA, players are subject to random testing with 48 hours notice, and are also randomly tested throughout the annual bowl games.<ref name="Portland"/> The NCAA will usually take approximately 20 percent of the players on a football team to test on a specific day.<ref name="Portland"/>

Anabolic steroids and other performance enhancing drugs are also used throughout [[high school football]]. Steroid use at this level of play doubled from 1991 to 2003, with results of a survey showed that about 6 percent of players out of the 15,000 surveyed had admitted to using some type of anabolic steroid or performance enhancing drug at one point in their playing time.<ref name="Seth">{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/2005-06-08-sports-weekly-steroids-report_x.htm |title=Fight against steroids gaining muscle in high school athletics |last=Livingstone |first=Seth |date=8 June 2005 |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> Other data shows that only 4 percent of high schools have some form of drug testing programs in place for their football teams.<ref name="Seth"/>

==Use in the NFL==
{{See also|National Football League controversies#Banned substances}}
The use of performance enhancing drugs and anabolic steroids dates back to the late 1960s in the [[NFL|National Football League (NFL)]]. The case of [[Denver Broncos]] [[defensive lineman]] Lyle Alzado notably exposed early use among NFL players. In the last years of his life, as he battled against the [[brain tumor]] that eventually caused his death at the age of 43, Alzado asserted that his steroid abuse directly led to his fatal illness, but his physician stated it could not possibly be true. According to some reports, Alzado was using natural growth hormone, harvested from human corpses, as opposed to synthetic growth hormones. However, shortly before his death, Alzado recounted his steroid abuse in an article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. He said:

{{cquote|I started taking anabolic steroids in 1969 and never stopped. It was addicting, mentally addicting. Now I'm sick, and I'm scared. Ninety percent of the athletes I know are on the stuff. We're not born to be 300 lbs or jump 30ft. But all the time I was taking steroids, I knew they were making me play better. I became very violent on the field and off it. I did things only crazy people do. Once a guy sideswiped my car and I beat the hell out of him. Now look at me. My hair's gone, I wobble when I walk and have to hold on to someone for support, and I have trouble remembering things. My last wish? That no one else ever dies this way."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usefultrivia.com/celebrity_trivia/sports_celebrity_trivia_008a.html |title=Lyle Alzado and Steroids |publisher=Usefultrivia.com |year=2004 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref>}}

Former player and NFL coach [[Jim Haslett]] said in 2005 that during the 1980s, half of the players in the league used some type of performance enhancing drug or steroid and all of the [[defensive lineman]] used them. One of the players from the [[Super Bowl]] winning 1979 Pittsburgh Steelers team who had earlier confessed to using steroids (in a 1985 ''Sports Illustrated'' article) was offensive lineman [[Steve Courson]].<ref name="Steelers">{{cite web|url= http://cbs.sportsline.com/nfl/story/8322840 |title=Haslett says '70s Steelers made steroids popular in NFL |date=24 March 2005 |publisher=CBS SportsLine |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Courson blamed a heart condition that he developed on steroids. However, Courson also said that some of his teammates, such as [[Jack Ham]] and [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]], refused to use any kind of performance enhancing drug.<ref name="Steelers"/>

The [[BALCO Scandal]] in 2003 also revealed many users of steroids in the NFL. The scandal followed a US Federal government investigation of the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO) into accusations of its supplying [[anabolic steroids]] to professional athletes.<ref name = "Game of Shadows">Fainaru-Wada, Mark, and Lance Williams. ''Game Of Shadows''. 2006.</ref> U.S. sprint coach [[Trevor Graham]] had given an anonymous phone call to the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency|U.S. Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) in June 2003 accusing a number of athletes being involved in doping with a steroid that was not detectable at the time. He named BALCO owner Victor Conte as the source of the steroid. As evidence, Graham delivered a syringe containing traces of a substance nicknamed ''[[Tetrahydrogestrinone|The Clear]]''.

Shortly after, then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory [[Don Catlin]], developed a testing process for The Clear ([[tetrahydrogestrinone]] (THG)).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-02-28-catlin-drug-lab_N.htm |first=Jill Lieber |last=Steeg |title=Catlin has made a career out of busting juicers |newspaper=USA Today |date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> With the ability to detect THG, the USADA retested 550 existing urine samples from athletes, of which several proved to be positive for THG.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/us/decoding-a-steroid-hunches-sweat-vindication.html|title=Decoding a Steroid: Hunches, Sweat, Vindication|last=Longman|first=Jere|coauthors=Joe Drape|date=November 2, 2003|work=New York Times|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref>

A number of players from the [[Oakland Raiders]] were implicated in this scandal, including [[Bill Romanowski]], Tyrone Wheatley, [[Barrett Robbins]], [[Chris Cooper (American football)|Chris Cooper]] and [[Dana Stubblefield]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/balco-timeline.htm |title=BALCO investigation time line |first=Bob |last=Kimball |first2=Beau |last2=Dure |date=27 November 2007 |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref>  Recently, many players have confessed to steroid use. One of these players was former [[Oakland Raiders]] player [[Bill Romanowski]]. Romanowski confessed on the [[United States|American]] [[news]] [[television show]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to using steroids for a two year period beginning in 2001.<ref name="Bill">{{cite news|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2190441 |title= Romo tells '60 Minutes' he used steroids |date=13 October 2005 |agency=AP |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> He stated that these were supplied by former NFL player and former head of [[BALCO]] [[Victor Conte]], saying:

{{cquote|I took [human growth hormone] for a brief period and ... I definitely didn't receive what I got out of THG."<ref name="Bill"/>}}

A notable recent occurrence happened in 2006. During the season, [[San Diego Chargers]] [[linebacker]] [[Shawne Merriman]] failed a drug test and was suspended for four games when his primary "A" sample and backup "B" sample both tested positive for [[HGH|human growth hormone (HGH)]].<ref name="Shawne"/> Merriman was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2005, with 54 [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]]s and 10 [[Quarterback sack|sacks]]. He also had a total of five passes defended and two forced [[fumble]]s. He was a starting player in the [[2005 Pro Bowl]], and was a leader on his team in sacks in the 2006 season.<ref name="Shawne">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2635475 |title= Sources: Chargers' Merriman suspended for steroids |accessdate=2008-05-03 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= ESPN.com}}</ref> The incident led to the passage of a rule that forbids a player who tests positive steroids from being selected to the Pro Bowl in the year in which they tested positive.  The rule is commonly referred to as the "Merriman Rule".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_5172209 |first=Mike |last=Klis |title=Chargers LB supports the "Merriman Rule" |newspaper=Denver Post |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2754079|title=Sources: Positive 'roids test to result in Pro Bowl ban|accessdate=2008-05-03 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref>  However, NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] has tried to distance the policy from being associated with the player, stating that Merriman tested clean on 19 of 20 random tests for performance-enhancing drugs since entering the league.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2853277  |title= Chargers LB tested clean 19 of 20 times |accessdate=2008-05-03 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref>

==NFL steroid policy==
[[File:Rawdealsteroids4.jpg|thumb|right|Numerous vials of injectable anabolic steroids, which have been listed as banned in the NFL banned substances policy.]]

The NFL banned substances policy has been acclaimed by some<ref name="Apr28">{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21734-2005Apr28.html  |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=NFL's Steroid Policy Gets Kudos on Capitol Hill |first1=Mark |last1=Maske |first2=Leonard |last2=Shapiro |date=2005-04-28 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> and criticized by others,<ref name="CBS">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/27/national/main691147_page3.shtml  |work=CBS News |title=NFL Steroid Policy 'Not Perfect' |date=2005-04-27}}</ref> but the policy is the longest running in professional sports, beginning in 1987.<ref name="Apr28" /> In comparison to the policies of [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Hockey League]], the NFL has long been the most strict. While recently MLB and the NHL decided to permanently ban athletes for a third offense, they have long been resistant to such measures, and random testing is in its infancy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-11-15-steroids-agreement_x.htm |newspaper=USA Today |title=Steroid agreement reached |first1=Kathy |last1=Kiely |date=2005-11-17 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |title=NHL unveils new drug testing policy |publisher=CTV.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}} Since the NFL started random, year-round tests and suspending players for banned substances, many more players have been found to be in violation of the policy. By April 2005, 111 NFL players had tested positive for banned substances, and of those 111, the NFL suspended 54.<ref name="CBS" /> 

The NFL began to test players for steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs during the 1987 season.<ref name="Apr28"/> The policy involves all players getting tested many times throughout the regular season, the playoffs, and even during the off-season.<ref name="Smith"/> The policy was different in the 1990s than it is today, due to heavy criticism from the [[United States Government]].<ref name="CBS"/> Originally, there were specific guidelines for when the player was caught using a steroid or other performance-enhancing drug. If a player was caught using steroids during [[training camp]] or some other off-season workout, they were suspended for 30 days for a first-time offense.<ref name="Smith"/> Typically, this would mean missing four games, three in the pre-season and one in the regular season. Players would then be tested throughout the year for performance-enhancing drugs and steroids. A player who tested positively during a previous test might or might not be included in the next random sampling.<ref name="Smith"/> A player who tested positive again would be suspended for one year, and a suspension for a third offense was never specified, because it never happened.<ref name="Smith"/> In later years when many players ignored the policy, [[NFLPA]] director [[Gene Upshaw]] sent out a letter to all NFL players that stated:

{{cquote|"Over the past few years, we have made a special effort to educate and warn players about the risks involved in the use of "nutritional supplements." Despite these efforts, several players have been suspended even though their positive test result may have been due to the use of nutritional supplements. Under the Policy, you and you alone are responsible for what goes into your body. As the Policy clearly warns, supplements are not regulated or monitored by the government. This means that, even if they are bought over-the-counter from a known establishment, there is simply no way to be sure that they:

(a) contain the ingredients listed on the packaging;<br />
(b) have not been tainted with prohibited substances; or<br />
(c) have the properties or effects claimed by the manufacturer or salesperson.

Therefore, if you take these products, you do so AT YOUR OWN RISK! The risk is at least a 4-game suspension without pay if a prohibited substance is detected in your system. For your own health and success in the League, we strongly encourage you to avoid the use of supplements altogether, or at the very least to be extremely careful about what you choose to take."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prostaronline.com/banned_subs2.html |title= NFl Banned Substances- Letter |accessdate=2008-05-04 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>}}

==Use in college football==
Steroids and performance-enhancing drugs have been reportedly used by many college football players in the NCAA. According to a recent drug test and survey, about one percent of all NCAA football players have tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug or steroid, and about three percent have admitted to using one sometime during their college football career.<ref name="Portland"/>
Controversy arose in 2005, when former [[Brigham Young University]] player [[Jason Scukanec]], although never admitting to using steroids himself, stated that steroids were used in many notable [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] programs.<ref name="Portland"/>

Scukanec, who is currently the host of a [[sports talk]] [[radio show]], made these statements:

{{cquote|Over the course of my five years at BYU, I have concrete proof of 13 to 15 guys (using steroids), and I would suspect five others...And BYU is more temperate than most programs. Being around NFL and NFL Europe players, they would tell me stuff that blew my mind. I know other schools are worse. I would bet my house you could find at least five guys on every Division I team in the country (using steroids).<ref name="Portland"/>}}

{{cquote|My best friend was a steroid monster. I shot him up probably four times in the butt. He couldn’t do it himself. He was afraid of needles. He was naturally 245 or 250 pounds, but he got up to 312 with a 36-inch waist. He had stretch marks on his chest and shoulder and eventually blew out both of his knees. When I was with the Broncos, they brought him in for a workout. The offensive line coach came to me and said, ‘What’s your friend on?’ Another guy we played with, who is still in the NFL, would come back at the end of a season weighing 270. Three weeks into the offseason, he was 295 and buffed. It wasn’t a big mystery what he was doing. Three guys I played with in the NFL, I saw them use (steroids). The coaches knew the guys on the juice. To pretend it doesn’t go on would be a farce. It’s the big no-no nobody wants to talk about. And you don’t want to know what’s going on at the junior college level, where no testing is being done.<ref name="Portland"/>}}

[[Portland State University]] coach [[Tim Walsh (football)|Tim Walsh]] commented on the situation, declining the remarks:

{{cquote|That’s a bold statement. It’s a tough accusation, to come up with a number like that. Is it true? Maybe, maybe not. I wish I could say I knew for sure. I’m not naive enough to think it’s not going on out there, but I feel pretty strongly it’s not been a problem with our players over the years.<ref name="Portland"/>}}

The number of players who have admitted using steroids in a confidential survey conducted by the NCAA since the 1980s has dropped from 9.7 percent in 1989 to 3.0 percent in 2003.<ref name="Portland"/> During the 2003 season, there were over 7,000 drug tests, with just 77 turning up as positive test results.<ref name="Portland"/> Scukanec claims that methods were used to get around the drug testing, whether it be avoiding the tests by using the drugs during the off-season, or flushing the drugs out of your system. This was used with a liquid he referred to as the "pink."<ref name="Portland"/> He stated:

{{cquote|There are a ton of (masking) products out there. What most of them cause is diuresis (increased excretion of urine), which means the athlete is providing diluted urine sample, almost water. In NCAA drug testing, the athlete is required to provide a concentrated specimen that passes a specific gravity cutoff. If the specimen is too diluted, he has to provide another sample. Using a product to cause diuresis is not going to help.<ref name="Portland"/>}}

==Health issues==
[[File:Heart attack diagram.png|thumb|right|An example of a [[heart attack]], which can occur after the use of a performance-enhancing drug.]]

Performance-enhancing drugs, most notably [[anabolic steroid]]s can cause many health issues.
