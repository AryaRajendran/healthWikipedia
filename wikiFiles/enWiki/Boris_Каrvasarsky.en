Proceeding from V. Myasishchev's ideas and his conception of pathogenetic psychotherapy, Boris Каrvasarsky elaborated personality-oriented (reconstructive) psychotherapy. After making a special study of this psychotherapeutic approach, some research workers concluded it to be nothing but "Soviet [[psychoanalysis]]." Its proponents, however, challenge such a characterisation.<ref>{{cite journal

The method has not been extensively used in other regions of today's Russia, but has been shown capable of yielding satisfactory results in patients with different mental disorders related to borderline psychiatry.
