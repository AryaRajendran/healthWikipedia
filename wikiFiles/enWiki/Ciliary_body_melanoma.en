'''Ciliary Body Melanoma''' is a type of [[cancer]] arising from the coloured part ([[uvea]]) of the [[human eye|eye]].

About 12% of [[uveal melanoma]] arise from the ciliary body.

==Clinical features==

It occurs most commonly in the sixth decade.
* External signs include dilated [[episcleral]] blood vessels (''sentinel vessels''). Extraocular erosion may produce a dark mass beneath the [[conjunctiva]].
* Pressure on the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] by the enlarging tumor can cause [[astigmatism]], [[sublaxtion]] of the lens and formation of a localised lens [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]].
* The tumor can erode forward through the iris root and mimic an iris [[melanoma]].
* [[Retinal detachment]] can be rarely caused by [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] extension of the tumor.
* Anterior [[uveitis]] is an uncommon presentation and occurs due to tumor [[necrosis]].
* Cirumferentially growing tumors carry a bad [[prognosis]] as they are diagnosed late.
* At times the tumor is detected as an incidental finding during routine examination.

The tumour is usually diagnosed by clinical examination with a [[slit-lamp]] utilising a triple mirror contact lens. [[Ultrasonography]] and fine needle aspiration biopsy ([[FNAB]]) are also sometimes helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

==Treatment==

[[enucleation of the eye|Enucleation]] (surgical removal of the eye) is the treatment of choice for large ciliary body melanomas. Small or medium sized tumors may be treated by an ''[[iridocyclectomy]]''. [[Radiotherapy]] may be appropriate in selected cases.
