The '''fifth metatarsal bone''' is a [[long bone]] in the foot. It is the second smallest of the five [[metatarsal bones]]. The fifth metatarsal is analogous to the [[fifth metacarpal bone]] in the hand<ref name=Bojsen246>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=246 }}</ref>

As with the four other metatarsal bones it can be divided in to three parts; a base, body and head.
The base is the part closest to the [[ankle]] and the head is closest to the toes. The narrowed part in the middle is referred to as the body (or shaft) of the bone. The bone is somewhat flat giving it two surfaces; the plantar (towards the [[Sole (foot)|sole of the foot]]) and the dorsal side (the area facing upwards while standing).<ref name=Bojsen246/> These surfaces are rough for the attachment of [[ligament]]s. The bone is curved longitudinally, so as to be concave below, slightly convex above.  

The base articulates behind, by a triangular surface cut obliquely in a [[transverse plane|transverse]] direction, with the [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]]; and medially, with the [[fourth metatarsal]]. The fifth metatarsal has a rough eminence, the tuberosity, on the lateral side of its base. The plantar surface of the base is grooved for the tendon of the [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor digiti quinti]].

The head articulates with the fifth [[Phalanges of the foot|proximal phalanx]], the first bone in the fifth toe.

A strong band of the [[plantar aponeurosis]] connects the projecting part of the tuberosity with the lateral [[Process (anatomy)|process]] of the tuberosity of the [[calcaneus]]. 

The base of the metatarsal is often injured and a particularly notorious fracture is the [[Jones fracture]]. When the [[tuberosity]] is broken, it is called a [[pseudo-Jones fracture]] or a [[dancer's fracture]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/825060-overview |title= Foot Fracture |author = Robert Silbergleit |publisher = Medscape.com |accessdate= 19 October 2011}}</ref> This is a common fracture of the fifth metatarsal.<ref name="Rosenberg">{{cite journal |journal= Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |title= Treatment Strategies for Acute Fractures and Nonunions of the Proximal Fifth Metatarsal |authors= Gary A.

The [[tendon]] of the [[fibularis tertius]] inserts on the medial part of the dorsal surface and the [[fibularis brevis]] on the dorsal surface of the tuberosity.

The plantar surface of the base is grooved for the tendon of the [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor digiti quinti]], and gives origin to the [[Flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor digiti minimi brevis]].

The fourth [[Dorsal interossei of the foot|dorsal interossei muscles]] originates from the medial side of shaft. The function of the muscle is to spread the toes.<ref name=Bojsen300-301>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=300–301 }}</ref>

The third [[Plantar interossei muscles|Plantar interossei muscle]] originates from the medial side of the base and shaft of the fifth metatarsal. The function of the muscle is to move the fourth toe medially and move the toes together.<ref name=Bojsen300-301/>

The horizontal head of the [[Adductor hallucis muscle|adductor hallucis]] from the deep [[transverse metatarsal ligament]]<ref name=Bojsen300-301/>, a narrow band which runs across and connects together the heads of all the metatarsal bones.
