'''Otalgia''' or an '''earache''' is ear [[pain]]. '''Primary otalgia''' is ear [[pain]] that originates inside the [[ear]]. '''Referred otalgia''' is ear pain that originates from outside the ear. 

Otalgia is not always associated with ear disease. It may be caused by several other conditions, such as impacted teeth, sinus disease, inflamed tonsils, infections in the nose and pharynx, throat cancer,  and occasionally as a sensory aura that precedes a migraine.

==Primary otalgia==
Ear pain can be caused by disease in the external, [[Middle ear|middle]], or inner ear, but the three are indistinguishable in terms of the pain experienced.

External ear pain may be:
* Mechanical: trauma, foreign bodies such as hairs, insects or cotton buds.
* Infective (otitis externa): ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', [[herpes zoster]], or viral Myringitis. (See [[Otitis externa]]) 

Middle ear pain may be:
* Mechanical: [[barotrauma]] (often [[iatrogenic]]), [[Eustachian tube]] obstruction leading to acute [[otitis media]].
* Inflammatory / infective: acute otitis media, [[mastoiditis]].

==Secondary (referred) otalgia==
The neuroanatomic basis of referred otalgia rests within one of five general neural pathways<ref name="otalgia1">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.coc.0000091357.08692.86 | author = Scarbrough TJ | last2 = Day | first2 = TA | last3 = Williams | first3 = TE | last4 = Hardin | first4 = JH | last5 = Aguero | first5 = EG | last6 = Thomas Jr | first6 = CR | title = Referred otalgia in head and neck cancer: a unifying schema | journal = American Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = e157–62 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14528091}}</ref> The general ear region is sensorily innervated via four cranial nerves and two spinal segments. Hence, pathology in other "non-ear" parts of the body innervated by these neural pathways may "refer" pain to the ear. These general pathways are: 
* Via [[Trigeminal]] nerve [cranial nerve V]. Rarely, trigeminal [[neuralgia]] can cause otalgia. Oral cavity carcinoma can also cause referred ear pain via this pathway.
* Via [[Facial nerve]] [cranial nerve VII]. This can come from the [[teeth]] (most commonly the upper molars, when it will be worse when drinking cold fluids), the [[temporomandibular]] joint (due to its close relation to the ear canal), or the [[parotid gland]].
* Via [[Glossopharyngeal]] nerve [cranial nerve IX]. This comes from the [[oropharynx]], and can be due to [[pharyngitis]] or [[tonsillitis]], or to [[carcinoma]] of the oropharynx (base of tongue, soft palate, pharyngeal wall, tonsils).
* Via [[Vagus nerve]] [cranial nerve X]. This can arise from the [[laryngopharynx]] in carcinoma of the this area, or from the [[esophagus]] in [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|GERD]].
* Via the second and third spinal segments, C2 and C3. 

In an adult with chronic ear pain, yet a normal ear on exam, the diagnosis is carcinoma of the head and neck region until proven otherwise. Yet some patients will have a "psychogenic otalgia," and no cause as to the pain in ears can be found (suggesting a psychosomatic origin). The patient in such cases should be kept under observation with periodic re-evaluation.

==Diagnosis==
It is normally possible to establish the cause of ear pain based on the history. It is important to exclude [[cancer]] where appropriate, particularly with unilateral otalgia in an adult who uses [[tobacco]] or [[alcohol]].<ref name="otalgia2">{{cite journal | author = Amundson L | title = Disorders of the external ear | journal = Prim Care | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–31 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2196606}}</ref>
Often migraines are caused by middle ear infections which can easily be treated with antibiotics. Often using a hot washcloth can temporarily relieve ear pain.

==Children==
It is not unusual for an ear infection to develop in early childhood. Although they're not contagious, ear infections can occur as side effects of contagious illnesses—colds, coughs, or eye ailments like [[conjunctivitis]].<ref>Institute for Good Medicine at the Pennsylvania Medical Society, http://www.myfamilywellness.org/MainMenuCategories/FamilyHealthCenter/AntibioticResistance/Earaches.aspx, 2009.</ref>
