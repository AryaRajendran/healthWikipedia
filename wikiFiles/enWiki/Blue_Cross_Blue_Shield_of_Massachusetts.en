'''Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts''' ('''BCBSMA''') is a state licensed private [[health insurance]] company under the [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]] with headquarters in [[Boston]]. 

==Workings==
BCBSMA formed in 1988 after the merger of [[Blue Cross]] and Blue Shield of Massachusetts.<ref name="Our History">{{cite web |url=http://www.bluecrossma.com/visitor/about-us/our-history.html |title=Our History: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts |publisher=BCBSMA |accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref> In 1992 it offered an [[HMO]] plan along with the rise of [[managed care]] in the 1990s.<ref name="Our History"/>

BCBSMA has [[non-profit]] status as a health insurer<ref name="Review"/> and has 2.8 million policyholders, the largest number of any insurer in [[Massachusetts]], with most policyholders [[Employer-sponsored health insurance|insured through employers]].<ref name="Refunds">{{cite news |title=After a rich severance deal, insurer issues refunds |author=Robert Weisman |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |date=October 21, 2011 |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-10-21/business/30306873_1_individual-policyholders-blue-cross-blue-shield-refunds |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> The number of policyholders dropped slightly between the first and second quarters of 2011, due to the [[Economy of the United States|economy]] and layoffs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Health insurers post surpluses &ndash; One of reasons cited: Lower patient demand for services |author=Lisa Eckelbecker |newspaper=[[Telegram & Gazette]] |date=August 16, 2011 |url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20110816/NEWS/108169981/1002/RSS01&source=rss |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> 

The organization's compensation for its departing [[CEO]], [[Cleve Killingsworth]], totaled $8.6 million in 2010. When this was reported in 2011, public anger and a four-month investigation from the [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] followed.<ref name="Review">{{cite news |title=AG to review exit pay for Blue Cross executive |author=Robert Weisman |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |date=March 3, 2011 |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-03-03/business/29342010_1_severance-blue-cross-blue-shield-employment-contract |page=5 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Refunds"/> BCBSMA ultimately credited $4.2 million, representing Killingsworth's [[severance pay|severance]], off policyholders' premiums (~$3 per policyholder).<ref name="Refunds"/>

==Alternative quality contracts and reform==
The company has received praise for its innovative alternative quality contract (AQC) payment model.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Alain Enthoven|Enthoven AC]] |title=Reforming Medicare by reforming incentives |journal=[[N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=364 |issue=21 |pages=e44 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21561341 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1104427 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1104427}}</ref> In 2007, then-CEO Cleve Killingsworth set a six-month deadline for the company to come up with a new payment plan to offer [[health care provider]]s.<ref name="NewTwist">{{cite journal |author=Anonymous |title=An insurer adds a new twist to an old idea |journal=[[Health Aff (Millwood)]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=62 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21209438 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1199}}</ref> Killingsworth thought existing [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]] initiatives were insufficient to prevent billions of dollars in wasteful health care spending that either harmed or did not help patients.<ref name="NewTwist"/> AQCs were established in January 2009<ref name="Innovation">{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Chernew|Chernew ME]], Mechanic RE, Landon BE, Safran DG |title=Private-payer innovation in Massachusetts: the 'alternative quality contract' |journal=[[Health Aff (Millwood)]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=51–61 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21209437 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0980 | url=http://healthforum.brandeis.edu/pdfs/HealthAffairs-Mechanic.pdf }}</ref> and they serve as a model for [[global payment]]s—in contrast to the [[fee-for-service]] model, which encourages excessive treatments—in the state.<ref name="MA Rein">{{cite news |title=Massachusetts Tries to Rein In Its Health Costs |author=Abby Goodnough and Kevin Sack |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 17, 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/us/massachusetts-tries-to-rein-in-its-health-care-cost.html?_r=2&pagewanted=2&seid=auto&smid=tw-nytimes |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref> AQCs were envisioned as a way to increase provider accountability. They are based on the [[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation]] approach that was tried in the 1990s, but with a bonus for patient quality outcomes to serve as a disincentive against providers neglecting patients.<ref name="NewTwist"/> The word "capitation" was discouraged during company meetings, as it proved unpopular with providers under the [[managed care]] of the 1990s.<ref name="NewTwist"/> Under the AQC model, groups of doctors and hospitals are paid set fees "to work as a team in caring for patients."<ref name="MA Rein"/> In the first year of implementation, AQCs resulted in medical cost savings in all participating provider groups, but the incentives that BCBSMA paid to providers are estimated to have made up for the savings.<ref name="Innovation"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/Boston/whitecoatnotes/2011/07/new-blue-cross-blue-shield-contract-produces-modest-savings-study-finds/yaGvioLCDm5EiWZBA1dFeO/index.html | title=New Blue Cross Blue Shield contract produces “modest’’ savings, study finds | newspaper=Boston Globe | author=Kowalczyk, Lisa |date=July 13, 2011}}</ref> As of October 2011, approximately 613,000 people were covered by BCBSMA under the AQC model (roughly two-thirds of BCBSMA members in [[health maintenance organization]]s), but the model had not been applied to policyholders in [[preferred provider organization]]s.<ref name="MA Rein"/> 

When the company was introducing AQCs to providers, "state lawmakers started talking about payment reform", leading to unexpected interest.<ref name="NewTwist"/> Deb Devaux, an executive, said providers also wanted to demonstrate willingness towards [[Health care reform in the United States|reform]].<ref name="NewTwist"/> In 2011, the large provider group [[Partners HealthCare]] joined the AQC, accepting lower than expected payment levels, possibly preempting regulatory moves to control costs.<ref name="MA Rein"/>
