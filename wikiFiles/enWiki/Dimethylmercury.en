'''Dimethylmercury''' (([[Carbon|C]][[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>[[Mercury (element)|Hg]]) is an [[organomercury compound]]. This colorless liquid is one of the strongest known [[neurotoxin]]s. It is described as having a slightly sweet smell, although inhaling enough vapor to detect its odor would be hazardous.

==Synthesis, structure, reactions==
The compound was one of the earliest [[organometallic complex]]es reported, reflecting its considerable stability.  It is formed by treating [[sodium amalgam]] with [[methyl]] [[halide]]s:
: Hg + 2 Na + 2 [[Methyl iodide|CH<sub>3</sub>I]] → Hg(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 [[Sodium iodide|NaI]]
It can also be obtained by [[alkylation]] of [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercuric chloride]] with [[methyllithium]]:
: HgCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 LiCH<sub>3</sub> → Hg(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 [[Lithium chloride|LiCl]]
The molecule adopts a linear structure with Hg-C bond lengths of 2.083 Å.<ref>{{ cite book | author = Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. | title = Inorganic Chemistry | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-12-352651-5 }}</ref>

===Reactions===
The most striking feature of the compound is its nonreactivity toward water, whereas the corresponding [[organocadmium]] and [[organozinc]] compounds hydrolyze rapidly.  The difference reflects the low affinity of Hg(II) for oxygen ligands. The compound reacts with mercuric chloride to give the mixed chloro-methyl compound:
: (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Hg  +  HgCl<sub>2</sub>  →   2 CH<sub>3</sub>HgCl
Whereas dimethylmercury is a [[volatile liquids|volatile liquid]], CH<sub>3</sub>HgCl is a [[crystalline solid]].

==Use==
Dimethylmercury has almost no applications because of the risks involved.  In [[toxicology]], it was formerly used as a reference toxin. It has also been used to calibrate [[NMR spectroscopy|NMR]] instruments for detection of mercury, although less toxic mercury salts are preferred.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.chem.northwestern.edu/~ohallo/HgNMRStandards/ | title = <sup>199</sup>Hg Standards | date = 1998-03-10 | author = O'Halloran, T.

==Safety==
Dimethylmercury is extremely toxic and dangerous to handle. Absorption of doses as low as 0.1 [[millilitre|mL]] has proven fatal.<ref name="osha_SHIB">{{ cite web | url = http://www.osha.gov/dts/hib/hib_data/hib19980309.html | title = OSHA Safety Hazard Information Bulletin on Dimethylmercury | publisher = OSHA | work = Safety and Health Information Bulletins (SHIBs), 1997-1998 | date = 1991-02-15 }}</ref> The risks are enhanced because of the high [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid.

Dimethylmercury passes through [[latex]], [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[butyl rubber|butyl]], and [[neoprene]] rapidly (within seconds) and is absorbed through the [[skin]]. Therefore, most laboratory gloves do not provide adequate protection from it, and the only safe precaution is to handle dimethylmercury while wearing highly resistant laminated gloves underneath long-cuffed neoprene or other heavy-duty gloves. A long face shield and work under a fume hood are also indicated.<ref name="osha_SHIB" /><ref>{{ cite web | author = Cotton, S. | url = http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/dimethylmercury/dmmh.htm | title = Dimethylmercury and Mercury Poisoning. The Karen Wetterhahn story | work =  Molecule of the Month | date = October 2003 | publisher = Bristol University }}</ref>

Dimethylmercury crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] easily, probably owing to formation of a [[Coordination complex|complex]] with [[cysteine]]. It is eliminated from the organism slowly, and therefore has a tendency to [[bioaccumulate]]. The symptoms of [[Mercury poisoning|poisoning]] may be delayed by months, possibly too late for effective treatment.

The toxicity of dimethylmercury was highlighted with the death of the inorganic chemist [[Karen Wetterhahn]] of Dartmouth College in 1997, months after spilling no more than a few drops of this compound on her [[latex glove|latex-gloved]] hand.<ref name="osha_SHIB" />
