'''Pediatric stroke''' is a [[stroke]] that happens in children or adolescents.  Although estimates vary, stroke affects about 6 in 100,000 children. Stroke is a leading cause of death in children in the U.S.<ref name=psa>{{cite web|url=http://www.stroke.org/site/PageServer?pagename=PEDSTROKE |publisher=National Stroke Association |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18|title=Pediatric Stroke}}</ref>

Stroke is different in children and newborns than it is in adults. Children have hemorrhagic strokes as often as they have ischemic strokes, while adults are more likely to have ischemic strokes. Sixty percent of pediatric strokes occur in boys. Causes of stroke are also different in children than they are in adults.<ref name=psa/>

==Types of Strokes==

===Ischemic===
{{Main|Cerebral infarction|Brain ischemia}}

In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen:

# Thrombosis (obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot forming locally)
# Embolism (obstruction due to an embolus from elsewhere in the body, see below),<ref name=Donnan>(Donnan ref missing)</ref>
# Systemic hypoperfusion (general decrease in blood supply, e.g., in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shuaib A, Hachinski VC |title=Mechanisms and management of stroke in the elderly |journal=CMAJ |volume=145 |issue=5 |pages=433–43 |year=1991 |month=September |pmid=1878825 |pmc=1335826}}</ref>

Stroke without an obvious explanation is termed "cryptogenic" (of unknown origin); this constitutes 30-40% of all ischemic strokes.<ref name=Donnan/><ref name=Guercini>{{cite journal |author=Guercini F, Acciarresi M, Agnelli G, Paciaroni M |title=Cryptogenic stroke: time to determine aetiology |journal=Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=549–54 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18208534 |doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.02903.x}}</ref>

===Hemorrhagic===
{{Main|Intracranial hemorrhage|intracerebral hemorrhage}}

Intracranial hemorrhage is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the skull vault. A distinction is made between [[intra-axial hemorrhage]] (blood inside the brain) and [[extra-axial hemorrhage]] (blood inside the skull but outside the brain). Intra-axial hemorrhage is due to [[intraparenchymal hemorrhage]] or [[intraventricular hemorrhage]] (blood in the ventricular system). The main types of extra-axial hemorrhage are [[epidural hematoma]] (bleeding between the [[dura mater]] and the skull), [[subdural hematoma]] (in the [[subdural space]]) and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (between the [[arachnoid mater]] and [[pia mater]]). Most of the hemorrhagic stroke syndromes have specific symptoms (e.g., [[headache]], previous [[head injury]]).

== Symptoms ==

Symptoms often include:

* Seizures, especially in newborns
* Keeping one hand in a fist position, especially in infants
* Worsening or sudden headaches
* Sudden difficulty speaking, slurring of words or trouble understanding speech
* Hemiparesis, or a weakness on one side of the body
* Sudden loss of vision or abnormal eye movements
* Sudden loss of balance or trouble walking

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for pediatric stroke survivors varies.  The following are some common outcomes:
* Cerebral Palsy (often Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy/Hemiplegia)
* Epilepsy
* Vision Loss
* Hearing Loss
