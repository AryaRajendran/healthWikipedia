'''Ectopia lentis''' is a displacement or malposition of the [[eye]]'s [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] from its normal location. A partial dislocation of a lens is termed ''lens subluxation'' or ''subluxated lens''; a complete dislocation of a lens is termed ''lens luxation'' or ''luxated lens''.

==Ectopia lentis in dogs and cats==
Although observed in humans and cats, ectopia lentis is most commonly seen in [[dog]]s. [[Zonule of Zinn|Ciliary zonules]] normally hold the lens in place. Abnormal development of these zonules can lead to primary ectopia lentis, usually a bilateral condition. Luxation can also be a secondary condition, caused by trauma, [[cataract]] formation (decrease in lens diameter may stretch and break the zonules), or [[glaucoma]] (enlargement of the globe stretches the zonules). Steroid administration weakens the zonules and can lead to luxation as well. Lens luxation in cats can occur secondary to anterior [[uveitis]] (inflammation of the inside of the eye).

===Anterior lens luxation===
With anterior lens luxation, the lens pushes into the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] or actually enters the [[anterior chamber]] of the eye. This can cause glaucoma, uveitis, or damage to the [[cornea]]. Uveitis (inflammation of the eye) causes the pupil to constrict ([[miosis]]) and trap the lens in the anterior chamber, leading to an obstruction of outflow of [[aqueous humour]] and subsequent increase in ocular pressure (glaucoma).<ref>{{cite web | last = Ketring | first = Kerry I. | title = Emergency Treatment for Anterior Lens Luxation | work = Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference | year = 2006 | url = http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/310.pdf?LA=1 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-02-22 }}</ref> Surgery to remove the lens has a higher success rate (retained vision and normal intraocular pressure) when it is performed before the onset of secondary glaucoma.<ref name=Glover>{{cite journal |author=Glover T, Davidson M, Nasisse M, Olivero D |title=The intracapsular extraction of displaced lenses in dogs: a retrospective study of 57 cases (1984-1990) |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=77–81 |year=1995 |pmid=7820769}}</ref> Glaucoma secondary to anterior lens luxation is less common in cats than dogs due to their naturally deeper anterior chamber and the liquification of the [[vitreous humour]] secondary to chronic inflammation.<ref>{{cite web | last = Peiffer | first = Robert L., Jr. | title = Diseases of the Lens in Dogs and Cats | work = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&PID=8713&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-02-22 }}</ref> Anterior lens luxation is considered to be an ophthalmological emergency.

===Posterior lens luxation===
With posterior lens luxation, the lens falls back into the vitreous humour and lies on the floor of the eye. This type causes fewer problems than anterior lens luxation, although glaucoma or ocular inflammation may occur. Surgery is used to treat dogs with significant symptoms. Removal of the lens before it moves to the anterior chamber may prevent secondary glaucoma.<ref name=Glover/>

===Lens subluxation===
Lens subluxation is also seen in dogs and is characterized by a partial displacement of the lens. It can be recognized by trembling of the iris ([[iridodonesis]]) or lens ([[phacodonesis]]) and the presence of an '''aphakic crescent''' (an area of the pupil where the lens is absent).<ref>{{cite web | title = Lens | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/30112.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref> Other signs of lens subluxation include mild [[conjunctiva]]l redness, vitreous humour degeneration, prolapse of the vitreous into the anterior chamber, and an increase or decrease of anterior chamber depth.<ref name=Canvet>{{cite journal |author=Grahn B, Storey E, Cullen C |title=Diagnostic ophthalmology.

===Breed predisposition===
Terrier breeds are predisposed to lens luxation, and it is probably inherited in the [[Sealyham Terrier]], [[Jack Russell Terrier]], [[Fox Terrier (Wire)|Wirehaired Fox Terrier]], [[Rat Terrier]], [[Teddy Roosevelt Terrier]], [[Tibetan Terrier]],<ref name=Gelatt>{{cite book|author=Gelatt, Kirk N.
