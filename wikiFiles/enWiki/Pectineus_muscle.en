The '''pectineus muscle''' (from the Latin word ''pecten'', meaning comb<ref>Mosbyâ€™s Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 1994, p. 1177</ref>) is a flat, quadrangular [[muscle]], situated at the [[anterior]] (front) part of the upper and [[medial]] (inner) aspect of the [[thigh]]. The pectineus muscle is the most anterior [[Adductor muscles of the hip|adductor of the hip]]. The muscle does [[adduction|adduct]] and medially rotate the thigh but its primary function is [[hip flexion]].

It can be classified in the [[medial compartment of thigh]]<ref name="isbn0-443-07168-3">{{cite book |author=Ellis, Harold; Susan Standring; Gray, Henry David |title=Gray's anatomy: the anatomical basis of clinical practice |publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingstone |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |isbn=0-443-07168-3 |oclc= |doi= |page=518}}</ref> (when the function is emphasized) or the [[anterior compartment of thigh]] (when the nerve is emphasized).<ref>{{NormanAnatomy|medialthigh}}</ref>

==Origin and insertion==
It arises from the [[pectineal line (pubis)|pectineal line]] of the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] and to a slight extent from the surface of bone in front of it, between the [[iliopectineal eminence]] and [[pubic tubercle]], and from the fascia covering the anterior surface of the muscle; the fibers pass downward, backward, and lateral, to be inserted into the [[pectineal line (femur)|pectineal line of the femur]] which leads from the [[lesser trochanter]] to the [[linea aspera]].

==Relations==
The pectineus is in relation by its anterior surface with the pubic portion of the [[fascia lata]], which separates it from the [[femoral artery]] and [[Femoral vein|vein]] and internal [[saphenous vein]], and lower down with the [[Profunda femoris artery|profunda artery]].

By its posterior surface with the [[Capsule of hip joint|capsule of the hip-joint]], and with the [[obturator externus]] and [[adductor brevis]], the [[obturator artery]] and [[Obturator vein|vein]] being interposed.

By its external border with the [[psoas major]], the [[femoral artery]] resting upon the line of interval.

By its internal border with the outer edge of the [[adductor longus]].

[[Obturator hernia]] is situated directly behind this muscle, which forms one of its coverings.<ref>{{cite book

==Action==
It is one of the muscles primarily responsible for [[hip flexion]]. It also [[adduction|adducts]] and medially rotates the thigh.

==Innervation==
Innervation is by the [[femoral nerve]] (L2 and L3) and occasionally (20% of the population) a branch of the [[obturator nerve]] called the [[accessory obturator nerve]].
