Hamilton, Ontario: BC Decker, 2003; p. 518</ref> The patient was a 54 year-old housewife with [[conductive hearing loss]] so severe that she could no longer hear at all, even with a hearing aid. Dr. Shea removed the [[stapes]], covered the oval window opening with a vein graft removed from the back of the patient's hand, and inserted a prosthesis to replace the diseased stapes bone. The patientâ€™s hearing was restored and she heard well for the rest of her life.
