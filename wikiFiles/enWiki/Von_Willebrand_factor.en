'''Von Willebrand factor''' (vWF) is a [[blood]] [[glycoprotein]] involved in [[hemostasis]]. It is deficient or defective in [[von Willebrand disease]] and is involved in a large number of other diseases, including [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[Heyde's syndrome]], and possibly [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]].<ref name=Sadler>{{cite journal |author=Sadler JE |title=Biochemistry and genetics of von Willebrand factor |journal=Annu.

== Biochemistry ==
=== Synthesis ===
vWF is a large multimeric [[glycoprotein]] present in [[blood plasma]] and produced constitutively as ultra-large vWF in [[endothelium]] (in the [[Weibel-Palade body|Weibel-Palade bodies]]), [[megakaryocyte]]s (α-granules of [[platelet]]s), and subendothelial [[connective tissue]].<ref name=Sadler/>

=== Structure ===
The basic vWF monomer is a 2050-[[amino acid]] protein. Every monomer contains a number of specific domains with a specific function; elements of note are:<ref name=Sadler/>
* the D'/D3 domain, which binds to [[factor VIII]], ([[Von Willebrand factor type D domain]])
* the A1 domain, which binds to:
** [[platelet]] GPIb-receptor
** [[heparin]]
** possibly [[collagen]]
* the A3 domain, which binds to collagen ([[Von Willebrand factor type A domain]])
* the C1 domain, in which the [[arginine|R]][[glycine|G]][[aspartic acid|D]] domain binds to platelet [[integrin]] α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> when this is activated
* the "cysteine knot" domain (at the C-terminal end of the protein), which vWF shares with [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF), [[transforming growth factor]]-β (TGFβ) and β-[[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (βHCG, of [[pregnancy test]] fame). ([[Von Willebrand factor type C domain]])
Monomers are subsequently [[glycosylation|N-glycosylated]], arranged into dimers in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and into multimers in the [[Golgi apparatus]] by crosslinking of [[cysteine]] residues via [[disulfide bond]]s. With respect to the glycosylation, vWF is one of only a few proteins that carry [[ABO blood group system]] antigens.<ref name=Sadler/>

Multimers of vWF can be extremely large, &gt;20,000 [[kDa]], and consist of over 80 subunits of 250 kDa each. Only the large multimers are functional. Some cleavage products that result from vWF production are also secreted but probably serve no function.<ref name=Sadler/>

=== Function ===
von Willebrand factor's primary function is binding to other proteins, in particular [[factor VIII]], and it is important in [[Platelet#Adhesion and aggregation|platelet adhesion]] to wound sites.<ref name=Sadler/> It is not an [[enzyme]] and, thus, has no catalytic activity.

vWF binds to a number of cells and molecules. The most important ones are:<ref name=Sadler/>
* Factor VIII is bound to vWF while inactive in circulation; factor VIII degrades rapidly when not bound to vWF. Factor VIII is released from vWF by the action of [[thrombin]].
* vWF binds to collagen, e.g., when it is exposed in [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] due to damage occurring to the blood vessel.
* vWF binds to platelet [[gpIb]] when it forms a complex with [[gpIX]] and [[gpV]]; this binding occurs under all circumstances, but is most efficient under high [[shear stress]] (i.e., rapid blood flow in narrow blood vessels, see below).
* vWF binds to other platelet receptors when they are activated, e.g., by [[thrombin]] (i.e., when coagulation has been stimulated).

vWF plays a major role in blood coagulation. Therefore, vWF deficiency or dysfunction (von Willebrand disease) leads to a bleeding tendency, which is most apparent in tissues having high blood flow [[Shear (fluid)|shear]] in narrow vessels. From studies it appears that vWF uncoils under these circumstances, decelerating passing platelets.<ref name=Sadler/>

===Catabolism===
The biological breakdown ([[catabolism]]) of vWF is largely mediated by the protein [[ADAMTS13]] (acronym of "''a'' ''d''isintegrin-like ''a''nd ''m''etalloprotease with ''t''hrombo''s''pondin type 1 motif no. ''13''"). It is a [[metalloproteinase]] that [[proteolysis|cleaves]] vWF between [[tyrosine]] at position 842 and [[methionine]] at position 843 (or 1605–1606 of the gene) in the A2 domain. This breaks down the multimers into smaller units, which are degraded by other [[peptidase]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levy GG, Motto DG, Ginsburg D |title=ADAMTS13 turns 3 |journal=Blood |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=11–7 |year=2005 |pmid=15774620 |doi=10.1182/blood-2004-10-4097| url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/106/1/11}}</ref>

== Role in disease ==
{{main|Von Willebrand disease}}

[[Genetic disorder|Hereditary]] or acquired defects of vWF lead to [[von Willebrand disease]] (vWD), a [[bleeding diathesis]] of the skin and mucous membranes, causing [[nosebleed]]s, [[menorrhagia]], and [[gastrointestinal bleed]]ing. The point at which the [[mutation]] occurs determines the severity of the bleeding diathesis. There are three types (I, II and III), and type II is further divided in several subtypes. Treatment depends on the nature of the abnormality and the severity of the symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sadler JE, Budde U, Eikenboom JC, ''et al.'' |title=Update on the pathophysiology and classification of von Willebrand disease: a report of the Subcommittee on von Willebrand Factor |journal=J. Thromb. Haemost. |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=2103–14 |year=2006 |pmid=16889557 |doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.02146.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01681.x}}</ref> Most cases of vWD are hereditary, but abnormalities of vWF may be acquired; [[aortic valve stenosis]], for instance, has been linked to vWD type IIA, causing [[gastrointestinal bleeding]] - an association known as [[Heyde's syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vincentelli A, Susen S, Le Tourneau T, ''et al.'' |title=Acquired von Willebrand syndrome in aortic stenosis |journal=N.

In [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (TTP) and [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]] (HUS), ADAMTS13 either is deficient or has been inhibited by [[antibody|antibodies]] directed at the enzyme. This leads to decreased breakdown of the ultra-large multimers of vWF and [[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]] with deposition of fibrin and platelets in small vessels, and capillary necrosis. In TTP, the organ most obviously affected is the brain; in HUS, the kidney.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moake JL |title=von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS-13, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura |journal=Semin. Hematol. |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=4–14 |year=2004 |pmid=14727254|doi=10.1053/j.seminhematol.2003.10.003}}</ref>

Higher levels of vWF are more common among people that have had [[Stroke#Ischemic|ischemic stroke]] (from blood-clotting) for the first time. Occurrence is not affected by ADAMTS13, and the only significant genetic factor is the person's [[Blood type|blood group]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bongers T, de Maat M, van Goor M, et al. | title = High von Willebrand factor levels increase the risk of first ischemic stroke: influence of ADAMTS13, inflammation, and genetic variability | journal = Stroke | volume = 37 | issue = 11 | pages = 2672–7 | year = 2006|url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/37/11/2672 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.0000244767.39962.f7 | pmid = 16990571}}</ref>

== History ==
vWF is named after Dr. [[Erik von Willebrand]] (1870–1949), a [[Finland|Finnish]] doctor who in 1924 first described a hereditary bleeding disorder in families from the [[Åland|Åland islands]], who had a tendency for cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, including [[menorrhagia]]. Although von Willebrand could not identify the definite cause, he distinguished von Willebrand disease (vWD) from [[hemophilia]] and other forms of [[bleeding diathesis]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=von Willebrand EA|title=Hereditär pseudohemofili|journal=Fin Läkaresällsk Handl|year=1926|volume=68|pages=87–112}} Reproduced in {{cite journal |author=Von Willebrand EA |title=Hereditary pseudohaemophilia |journal=Haemophilia |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=223–31; discussion 222 |year=1999 |pmid=10444294 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2516.1999.00302.x}}</ref>

In the 1950s, vWD was shown to be caused by a plasma factor deficiency (instead of being caused by platelet disorders), and, in the 1970s, the vWF protein was purified.<ref name=Sadler/>
