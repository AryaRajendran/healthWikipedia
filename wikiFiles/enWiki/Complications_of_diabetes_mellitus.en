Wider health problems accelerate the deleterious effects of diabetes. These include [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] levels, [[obesity]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and lack of regular [[exercise]].

==Acute==
===Diabetic ketoacidosis===
{{Main|Diabetic ketoacidosis}}
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute and dangerous complication that is always a [[medical emergency]]. Low insulin levels cause the [[liver]] to turn fatty acid to ketone for fuel (i.e., [[ketosis]]); [[ketone bodies]] are intermediate substrates in that metabolic sequence. This is normal when periodic, but can become a serious problem if sustained. Elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood decrease the blood's [[pH]], leading to DKA. On presentation at hospital, the patient in DKA is typically dehydrated, and breathing rapidly and deeply. Abdominal pain is common and may be severe. The [[level of consciousness]] is typically normal until late in the process, when lethargy may progress to coma. Ketoacidosis can easily become severe enough to cause [[hypotension]], [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and death. Urine analysis will reveal significant levels of ketone bodies (which have exceeded their [[renal threshold]] blood levels to appear in the urine, often before other overt symptoms). Prompt, proper treatment usually results in full recovery, though death can result from inadequate or delayed treatment, or from complications (e.g., brain [[edema]]). DKA is always a medical emergency and requires medical attention. Ketoacidosis is much more common in type&nbsp;1 diabetes than type&nbsp;2.

===Hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state===
{{Main|nonketotic hyperosmolar coma}}
[[Nonketotichyperosmolar coma|Hyperosmolar nonketotic state]] (HNS) is an acute complication sharing many symptoms with DKA, but an entirely different origin and different treatment. A person with very high (usually considered to be above 300&nbsp;mg/dl (16&nbsp;mmol/L)) blood glucose levels, water is [[osmosis|osmotically]] drawn out of cells into the blood and the kidneys eventually begin to dump glucose into the urine. This results in loss of water and an increase in blood [[osmolarity]]. If fluid is not replaced (by mouth or intravenously), the osmotic effect of high glucose levels, combined with the loss of water, will eventually lead to [[dehydration]]. The body's cells become progressively dehydrated as water is taken from them and excreted. Electrolyte imbalances are also common and are always dangerous. As with DKA, urgent medical treatment is necessary, commonly beginning with fluid volume replacement. Lethargy may ultimately progress to a coma, though this is more common in type&nbsp;2 diabetes than type&nbsp;1.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Hypoglycemia===
{{Main|hypoglycemia}}
Hypoglycemia, or abnormally low blood glucose, is an acute complication of several diabetes treatments. It is rare otherwise, either in diabetic or non-diabetic patients. The patient may become agitated, sweaty, weak, and have many symptoms of [[Autonomic nervous system|sympathetic]] activation of the autonomic nervous system resulting in feelings akin to dread and immobilized panic. Consciousness can be altered or even lost in extreme cases, leading to coma, [[seizure]]s, or even brain damage and death. In patients with diabetes, this may be caused by several factors, such as too much or incorrectly timed insulin, too much or incorrectly timed exercise (exercise decreases insulin requirements) or not enough food (specifically glucose containing carbohydrates). The variety of interactions makes cause identification difficult in many instances.

It is more accurate to note that [[iatrogenic]] hypoglycemia is typically the result of the interplay of absolute (or relative) insulin excess and compromised glucose counterregulation in type&nbsp;1 and advanced type&nbsp;2 diabetes. Decrements in insulin, increments in glucagon, and, absent the latter, increments in epinephrine are the primary glucose counterregulatory factors that normally prevent or (more or less rapidly) correct hypoglycemia. In insulin-deficient diabetes (exogenous) insulin levels do not decrease as glucose levels fall, and the combination of deficient glucagon and epinephrine responses causes defective glucose counterregulation.

Furthermore, reduced sympathoadrenal responses can cause hypoglycemia unawareness. The concept of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) in diabetes posits that recent incidents of hypoglycemia causes both defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness. By shifting glycemic thresholds for the sympathoadrenal (including epinephrine) and the resulting neurogenic responses to lower plasma glucose concentrations, antecedent hypoglycemia leads to a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia and further impairment of glucose counterregulation. In many cases (but not all), short-term avoidance of hypoglycemia reverses hypoglycemia unawareness in affected patients, although this is easier in theory than in clinical experience.

In most cases, hypoglycemia is treated with sugary drinks or food. In severe cases, an injection of [[glucagon]] (a hormone with effects largely opposite to those of insulin) or an [[intravenous]] infusion of [[dextrose]] is used for treatment, but usually only if the person is unconscious. In any given incident, glucagon will only work once as it uses stored liver glycogen as a glucose source; in the absence of such stores, glucagon is largely ineffective. In hospitals, intravenous dextrose is often used.

===Diabetic coma===
{{Main|Diabetic coma}}
Diabetic coma is a [[medical emergency]] in which a person with [[diabetes mellitus]] is [[coma]]tose (unconscious) because of one of the acute complications of diabetes:
#Severe [[diabetic hypoglycemia]]
#[[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] advanced enough to result in unconsciousness from a combination of severe [[hyperglycemia]], [[dehydration]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and exhaustion
#[[Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma]] in which extreme [[hyperglycemia]] and [[dehydration]] alone are sufficient to cause unconsciousness.

In most medical contexts, the term diabetic coma refers to the diagnostical dilemma posed when a physician is confronted with an unconscious patient about whom nothing is known except that he has diabetes. An example might be a physician working in an [[emergency department]] who receives an unconscious patient wearing a [[medical identification tag]] saying DIABETIC. [[Paramedic]]s may be called to rescue an unconscious person by friends who identify him as diabetic. Brief descriptions of the three major conditions are followed by a discussion of the [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic process]] used to distinguish among them, as well as  a few other conditions which must be considered.

An estimated 2 to 15 percent of diabetics will suffer from at least one episode of diabetic coma in their lifetimes as a result of severe hypoglycemia.

===Respiratory infections===
The immune response is impaired in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Cellular studies have shown that hyperglycemia both reduces the function of immune cells and increases [[inflammation]]. The vascular effects of diabetes also tend to alter lung function, all of which leads to an increase in susceptibility to respiratory infections such as [[pneumonia]] and [[influenza]] among individuals with diabetes. Several studies also show diabetes associated with a worse disease course and slower recovery from respiratory infections.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ahmed MS, Reid E and Khardori N|title=Respiratory infections in diabetes: Reviewing the risks and challenges |journal=Journal of Respiratory Diseases|date=June 24, 2008|url=http://www.consultantlive.com/diabetes/article/1145425/1403686}}</ref>

===Periodontal disease===
Diabetes is associated with [[periodontal disease]] (gum disease)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mealey|first=BL|title=Periodontal disease and diabetes.

==Chronic==
[[Image:Fundus photo showing scatter laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy EDA09.JPG|thumb|Image of [[Fundus (eye)|fundus]] showing scatter [[Laser scalpel|laser surgery]] for [[diabetic retinopathy]]]]

===Mechanisms of chronic complications===
Chronic elevation of blood glucose level leads to damage of [[blood vessel]]s ([[angiopathy]]). The [[endothelial cell]]s lining the blood vessels take in more glucose than normal, since they do not depend on insulin. They then form more surface [[glycoprotein]]s than normal, and cause the [[basement membrane]] to grow thicker and weaker. In diabetes, the resulting problems are grouped under "[[microvascular disease]]" (due to damage to small blood vessels) and "[[macrovascular disease]]" (due to damage to the [[artery|arteries]]).

However, some research challenges the theory of hyperglycemia as the cause of diabetic complications.  The fact that 40% of diabetics who carefully control their blood sugar nevertheless develop neuropathy,<ref>M. Centofani, "Diabetes Complications: More than Sugar?" Science News, vol. 149, no. 26/27, Dec. 23–30, p. 421 (1995)</ref> and that some of those with good blood sugar control still develop nephropathy,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rich SS |title=Genetics of diabetes and its complications |journal=J.

It has been discovered that the serum of diabetics with neuropathy is toxic to nerves even if its blood sugar content is normal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pittenger GL, Liu D, Vinik AI |title=The toxic effects of serum from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus on mouse neuroblastoma cells: a new mechanism for development of diabetic autonomic neuropathy |journal=Diabet.

===Examples of chronic complications===
The damage to small blood vessels leads to a [[microangiopathy]], which can cause one or more of the following:
* ''[[Diabetic cardiomyopathy]]'', damage to the heart, leading to diastolic dysfunction and eventually [[heart failure]].
* ''[[Diabetic nephropathy]]'', damage to the kidney which can lead to chronic renal failure, eventually requiring [[dialysis]]. Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of adult kidney failure worldwide in the developed world.
* ''[[Diabetic neuropathy]]'', abnormal and decreased sensation, usually in a 'glove and stocking' distribution starting with the feet but potentially in other nerves, later often fingers and hands. When combined with damaged blood vessels this can lead to ''[[diabetic foot]]'' (see below). Other forms of diabetic neuropathy may present as mononeuritis or [[autonomic neuropathy]]. [[Diabetic amyotrophy]] is muscle weakness due to neuropathy.
* ''[[Diabetic retinopathy]]'', growth of friable and poor-quality new blood vessels in the [[retina]] as well as [[macular edema]] (swelling of the [[macula]]), which can lead to severe [[vision loss]] or blindness. Retinal damage (from microangiopathy) makes it the most common cause of blindness among non-elderly adults in the US.

[[Macrovascular disease]] leads to cardiovascular disease, to which accelerated [[atherosclerosis]] is a contributor:

* [[Coronary artery disease]], leading to [[Angina pectoris|angina]] or [[myocardial infarction]] ("heart attack")
* [[Diabetic myonecrosis]] ('muscle wasting')
* [[Peripheral artery occlusive disease|Peripheral vascular disease]], which contributes to [[intermittent claudication]] (exertion-related leg and foot pain) as well as diabetic foot.<ref name="Examination">{{Cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=G|title=The diabetic foot examination: A positive step in the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers and amputation|journal= Osteopathic Family Physician  |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=73-78 |year=2013 |month=March-April|pmid= |doi =10.1016/j.osfp.2012.08.002}}</ref>
* [[Stroke]] (mainly the ischemic type)

Diabetic foot, often due to a combination of sensory neuropathy (numbness or insensitivity) and vascular damage, increases rates of [[skin ulcer]]s ([[diabetic foot ulcer]]s) and [[infection]] and, in serious cases, [[necrosis]] and gangrene. It is why diabetics are prone to leg and foot infections and why it takes longer for them to heal from leg and foot wounds. It is the most common cause of non-traumatic adult amputation, usually of toes and or feet, in the developed world.<ref name="Examination"/>

[[Carotid artery stenosis]] does not occur more often in diabetes, and there appears to be a lower prevalence of [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]. However, diabetes does cause higher morbidity, mortality and operative risks with these conditions.<!--
