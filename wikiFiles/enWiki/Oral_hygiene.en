'''Oral hygiene''' is the practice of keeping the [[human oral cavity|mouth]] and [[human teeth|teeth]] clean to prevent dental problems, most commonly, [[dental cavities]], [[gingivitis]], and [[Halitosis|bad breath]]. There are also [[oral pathology|oral pathologic]] conditions in which good oral hygiene is required for [[healing]] and [[regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of the oral tissues.

==Cleaning==

===Cleaning of teeth===
{{See also|Tooth brushing}}
Teeth cleaning is the removal of [[dental plaque]] and [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] from [[teeth]] to prevent [[Dental caries|cavities]], gingivitis, and [[periodontitis|gum disease]]. Severe gum disease causes at least one-third of adult [[tooth loss]].

[[Dental caries|Tooth decay]] is the most common global disease. Over 80% of cavities occur inside pits and fissures on chewing surfaces where brushing cannot reach food left trapped after every meal or snack, and saliva or fluoride have no access to neutralise acid and remineralise demineralised teeth, unlike easy-to-reach surfaces, where fewer cavities occur.

[[Dental sealant]]s, which are applied by dentists, cover and protect fissures and grooves in the chewing surfaces of back teeth, preventing food from becoming trapped thus halting the decaying process. An [[elastomer]] strip has been shown to force sealant deeper inside opposing chewing surfaces and can also force fluoride [[toothpaste]] inside chewing surfaces to aid in remineralising demineralised teeth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Since before recorded history, a variety of oral hygiene measures have been used for teeth cleaning. This has been verified by various excavations done throughout the world, in which [[chew stick]]s, tree [[twig]]s, bird [[feather]]s, animal [[bone]]s and [[porcupine]] quills were recovered. Many people used different forms of teeth cleaning tools. [[India]]n medicine ([[Ayurveda]]) has used the [[neem|neem tree]], or ''daatun'', and its products to create [[teeth cleaning twig]]s and similar products; a person chews one end of the neem twig until it somewhat resembles the bristles of a [[toothbrush]], and then uses it to brush the teeth. In the [[Muslim]] world, the [[miswak]], or ''siwak'', made from a twig or root, has [[antiseptic]] properties and has been widely used since the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. Rubbing [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] or [[chalk]] against the teeth was also common.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Generally, dentists recommend that teeth be cleaned professionally at least twice per year.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
Professional cleaning includes [[tooth scaling]], [[tooth polishing]], and, if tartar has accumulated, [[debridement (dental)|debridement]]; this is usually followed by a fluoride treatment. However, the [[American Dental Hygienists' Association]] (ADHA) publicly stated in 1998 that there is an absence of evidence that scaling and polishing provides therapeutic value.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Dental Hygienists’ Association Position Paper on the Oral Prophylaxis|url=http://www.adha.org/profissues/prophylaxis.htm|work=adha - American Dental Hygienists’ Association|publisher=The American Dental Hygienists' Association|accessdate=28 June 2012|author=Staff|format=Position Paper|date=29|month=April|year=1998}}</ref> 
The Cochrane Oral Health Group reviewed nine studies but found them to be of insufficient quality and not enough evidence to support the claims of the benefits of regular tooth scaling or tooth polishing. <ref>{{cite web|title=Routine scale and polish for periodontal health in adults|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004625.pub3/abstract|publisher=The Cochrane Library|accessdate=24 sept 2012|author=Paul V Beirne1,*, Helen V Worthington, Jan E Clarkson|date=8|month=Oct|year=2008}}</ref> 

Between cleanings by a dental hygienist, good oral hygiene is essential for preventing tartar build-up which causes the problems mentioned above. This is done through careful, frequent brushing with a [[toothbrush]], combined with the use of [[dental floss]] to prevent accumulation of plaque on the teeth.<ref>{{Cite document

====Removing plaque====
Plaque is a yellow sticky film that forms on the teeth and gums and can be seen at gum margins of teeth with a food dye. The bacteria in plaque convert carbohydrates in food (such as sugar) into acid that demineralises teeth, eventually causing cavities. Daily brushing and flossing removes plaque and can prevent [[calculus (dental)|tartar]] from forming on the teeth.

Plaque can also cause gum irritation ([[gingivitis]]), making them red, tender and cause them to bleed. In some cases, the gums pull away from the teeth ([[receding gums]]), leaving cavities inhabited by bacteria and pus. If this is not treated, bones around the teeth can be destroyed.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Teeth may become loose or have to be removed due to periodontal (gum) disease, mostly in adults. Eating a balanced diet and limiting snacks can prevent tooth decay and [[periodontal disease]].{{dubious|date=June 2012|reason=Limiting ''sugary'' snacks, perhaps, but I'm not aware of research indicating a "balanced diet" as having anything to do with it}} The ''[[FDI World Dental Federation|Fédération dentaire internationale]]'' (FDI World Dental Federation) has promoted foods such as raw vegetables, plain yogurt, cheese, or fruit as dentally beneficial—this has been echoed by the [[American Dental Association|American Dental Association (ADA)]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention|url=http://www.britishdentalcentre.com/prevention.html|work=British Dental Centre|publisher=British Dental Centre|accessdate=28 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How can I make better food choices to prevent tooth decay?|url=http://www.sharecare.com/question/how-food-choices-tooth-decay|work=Sharecare|publisher=Sharecare, Inc|accessdate=28 June 2012|author=American Dental Association (contributor)|year=Unknown}}</ref>

====Flossing====
The use of [[dental floss]] is an important element of oral hygiene, since it removes plaque and decaying food remaining stuck between the teeth. This food decay and plaque cause irritation to the gums, allowing the gum tissue to bleed more easily. Acidic foods left on the teeth can also demineralise teeth, eventually causing cavities.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Flossing for a proper inter-dental cleaning is recommended at least once per day, preferably before brushing so fluoride toothpaste has better access between teeth to help remineralise teeth,<ref name="supertoothndk.org">www.supertoothndk.org</ref> prevent [[receding gums]], [[gum disease (disambiguation)|gum disease]], and [[Dental cavity|cavities]] on the surfaces between the teeth.

[[Image:Dental flossing 9344.JPG|right|thumb|A dental hygienist demonstrates dental flossing.]]

It is recommended to use enough floss to enable easy use, usually ten or more inches with three to four inches of taut floss to put between teeth. Floss is then wrapped around the [[middle finger]] and/or [[index finger]], and supported with the [[thumb]] on each hand. It is then held tightly to make taut, and then gently moved up and down between each tooth. It is important to floss under visible areas by curving the floss around each tooth instead of moving up and down on gums, which are much more sensitive than teeth. However, bleeding gums are normal upon first usage of floss, and will harden with use.<ref>http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/effective-tooth-brushing-and-flossing</ref> One should use an unused section of the floss when moving around different teeth. Removing floss from between teeth requires using the same back-and-forth motion as flossing, but gently bringing the floss up and out of gaps between teeth.

====Interdental brushes====
An interdental brush, also called an interproximal brush or a proxy brush, is a small brush, typically disposable, either supplied with a reusable angled plastic handle or an integral handle, used for cleaning between teeth and between the wire of dental braces and the teeth. Brushes are available in a range of widths, color coded as per ISO 16409. Interdental brushes are classified according to ISO standard 16409:2006. The ISO brush sizes range from 1 to 7. The ISO brush size is determined by the PHD or Passage Hole Diameter in mm. This PHD is the minimum diameter of a hole that the interdental brush will pass through without deforming the brush wire stem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} A peer-reviewed clinical study has found that using a toothbrush and an interdental brush more effectively removes plaque than using a toothbrush and dental floss.<ref>Journal of Clinical Periodontology, 1991 Oct;18(9):681-4, A Comparison of Proximal Plaque Removal Using Floss and Interdental Brushes," http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1960236</ref>

===Tongue cleaning===
[[Tongue cleaner|Cleaning the tongue]] as part of daily oral hygiene is essential, since it removes the white/yellow bad-breath-generating coating of bacteria, decaying food particles, fungi (such as ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]''), and dead cells from the dorsal area of the tongue. Tongue cleaning also removes some of the bacteria species which generate tooth decay and gum problems.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Gum care===
Massaging the [[Gingiva|gums]] with toothbrush bristles is generally recommended for good oral health.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Oral irrigation ===
Some dental professionals recommend oral irrigation as a way to clean teeth and gums.<ref>Vol. 1, #3 Cobb, C., Rodgers, R., Killoy, W.: Ultrastructural Examination of Human Periodontal Pockets Following the Use of an Oral Irrigation Device in Vivo. J of Periodontology 59: 155, 1987. Greenstein, G.: The Ability of Subgingival Irrigation to Enhance Periodontal Health. Compendium of Continuing Education in Dentistry 10: 327, 1988. Ciancio, S.: Oral Irrigation A Current Perspective. Biological Therapies in Dentistry 3: 33, 1988
Fleming, T., et al: Chlorhexidine and Irrigation in Gingivitis: 6 Months Correlative Clinical and Microbiological Findings. AADR Abstract #1612, 1989. Irrigation Update</ref>

[[Oral irrigator]]s reach 3–4&nbsp;mm under the gum line. Oral irrigators use a pressured, directed stream of water to disrupt plaque and bacteria.

== Food and drink ==
Foods that help muscles and bones also help teeth and gums. Breads and cereals are rich in vitamin B while fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C, both of which contribute to healthy gum tissue.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Lean meat, fish, and poultry provide magnesium and zinc for teeth. For some people, flossing might be recommended after every meal.

=== Beneficial foods ===
Some foods may protect against cavities. [[Fluoride therapy|Fluoride]] is a primary protector against dental cavities. Fluoride makes the surface of teeth more resistant to acids during the process of [[remineralisation]]. Drinking fluoridated water is recommended by some dental professionals while others say that using toothpaste alone is enough. Milk and cheese are also rich in [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]], and may also encourage remineralisation. All foods increase saliva production, and since saliva contains buffer chemicals this helps to stabilize the pH to near 7 (neutral) in the mouth. Foods high in fiber may also help to increase the flow of saliva and a bolus of fibre like celery string can force saliva into trapped food inside pits and fissures on chewing surfaces where over 80% of cavities occur, to dilute carbohydrate like sugar, neutralise acid and remineralise tooth like on easy to reach surfaces.<ref name="supertoothndk.org"/> Sugar-free chewing gum stimulates saliva production, and helps to clean the surface of the teeth.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

According to World Dental,<ref name="worldental">[http://worldental.org/nutrition/10-most-healthy-foods-for-teeth/ 10 most healthy foods for teeth]</ref> these are the top ten beneficial foods for teeth.
# Green tea contains [[polyphenol antioxidant]] plant compounds that reduce plaque, cavities, and gum disease. Green tea may also reduce bad breath and strengthen the tooth enamel because of its high fluoride content.
# Dairy foods are beneficial because of their low acidity, which reduces wear and tear on teeth. Additionally, dairy foods are high in calcium, the main component of teeth.
# Cheese contains calcium and phosphate, which help balance pH in the mouth, preserves (and rebuilds) tooth enamel, produces saliva, and kills bacteria that cause cavities and disease.<ref name="worldental" />
# Fruits such as apples, strawberries and kiwis contain Vitamin C. This vitamin is considered the element that holds cells together. If this vitamin is neglected, gum cells can break down, making gums tender and susceptible to disease.
# Vegetables: Vitamin A, found in pumpkins, carrots, sweet potatoes and broccoli, is necessary for the formation of tooth enamel. Crunchy vegetables may also help clean gums.
# Onions contain antibacterial sulfur compounds. Tests show that onions kill various types of bacteria, especially when eaten raw.<ref name="worldental" />
# Celery protects teeth by producing saliva which neutralizes acid that causes demineralisation and cavities. It also massages the teeth and gums.
# Sesame seeds reduce plaque and help build tooth enamel. They are also very high in calcium.<ref name="worldental" />
# Animal food: beef, chicken, turkey, and eggs contain phosphorus which, with calcium, is one of the two most vital minerals of teeth and bone.
# Water cleans the mouth and produces saliva that deposits essential minerals into the teeth. It keeps gums hydrated and washes away particles from the teeth.<ref name="worldental" />

===Harmful foods===
Sugars are commonly associated with dental cavities. Other carbohydrates, especially cooked starches, e.g. [[Potato chip|crisps/potato chips]], may also damage teeth, although to a lesser degree (and indirectly) since starch has to be converted to sugars by [[salivary amylase]] (an enzyme in the [[saliva]]) first.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Sugars that are higher in the stickiness index, such as [[toffee]], are likely to cause more damage to teeth than those that are lower in the stickiness index, such as certain forms of [[chocolate]] or most fruits.

[[Sucrose]] (table sugar) is most commonly associated with cavities. The amount of sugar consumed at any one time is less important than how often food and drinks that contain sugar are consumed. The more frequently sugars are consumed, the greater the time during which the tooth is exposed to low pH levels, at which point demineralisation occurs (below 5.5 for most people). It is important therefore to try to encourage infrequent consumption of food and drinks containing sugar so that teeth have a chance to be repaired by remineralisation and fluoride. Limiting sugar-containing foods and drinks to meal times is one way to reduce the incidence of cavities. Sugars from [[fruit]] and fruit juices, e.g., [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[maltose]] seem equally likely to cause cavities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Acids contained in fruit juice, vinegar and soft drinks lower the pH level of the oral cavity which causes the enamel to demineralize. Drinking drinks such as orange juice or cola throughout the day raises the risk of dental cavities tremendously.

Another factor which affects the risk of developing cavities is the stickiness of foods. Some foods or sweets may stick to the teeth and so reduce the pH in the mouth for an extended time, particularly if they are sugary. It is important that teeth be cleaned at least twice a day, preferably with a [[toothbrush]] and fluoride toothpaste, to remove any food sticking to the teeth. Regular brushing and the use of dental floss also removes the dental plaque coating the tooth surface.

[[Chewing gum]] assists oral irrigation between and around the teeth, cleaning and removing particles, but for teeth in poor condition it may damage or remove loose fillings as well. Chewing sugar free chewing gum that contains [[xylitol]] may be good for teeth.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Other==
[[tobacco smoking|Smoking]] and chewing tobacco are both strongly linked with multiple dental diseases.<ref>Tobacco use and incidence of tooth loss among US male health professionals. Journal of Dental Research, 86(4):373-7. April, 2007</ref> Regular vomiting, as seen in [[bulimia nervosa]], also causes significant damage.

[[Mouthwash]] or mouth rinse with [[saline (medicine)|saline]] (salty [[water]]), [[fluoride|fluoridated solution]] or the [[antiseptic]] [[chlorhexidine gluconate]] solution improve oral hygiene. [[Functional chewing gum|Dental chewing gums]] claim to improve dental health.

[[Retainer (orthodontic device)|Retainers]] can be cleaned in mouthwash or denture cleaning fluid.<ref>{{Cite web
