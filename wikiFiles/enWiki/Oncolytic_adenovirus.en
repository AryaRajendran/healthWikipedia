[[Adenoviruses]] are [[DNA virus]]es that contain about 36kb of [[double-stranded DNA]]. Once they have entered the nucleus, genes from the early region 1 ([[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1a]] and E1b) are transcribed. Four noncontiguous regions of the genome are expressed (E1 to E4) during the early phase of viral replication. Part of their function is to act as master transcriptional regulators that begin the process of viral gene expression leading to genome replication. Once DNA replication has begun, viral transcription is governed by the major late promoters.<ref name= "one"> Vorburger, S. A., and Kelly K. Hunt. "Adenoviral Gene Therapy." The Oncologist 7.1 (2002): 46-59.</ref>

Viral-encoded functions can be separated into cis and trans elements. The cis elements are responsible for the origin of replication or the packaging signal that condenses DNA and need to carried by the virus itself. However, the trans genes may be replaced or complemented by the transgene that is being inserted.<ref name= "one" />

== Overview of adenovirus as a gene therapy vector ==
The ideal in oncolytic gene therapy is a vector that can be administered noninvasively, is able to target specifically, and can have regulated expression of therapeutic [[transgene]] products for defined time periods.<ref name= "one" />

While there is no one vector that will be optimal for all applications, adenoviruses have features that make them attractive for gene therapy applications. Firstly, adenoviral vectors have a broad [[tropism]] and high [[transfection]] efficiencies compared with other available vectors. Besides being able to accommodate a comparatively large transgene segment (up to 7.5 kilobase pairs), adenoviruses can also transduce in non-proliferating cells. Adenoviruses are suitable as vectors because they are relatively easy to manipulate using recombinant DNA techniques. Since the adenoviral genome does not undergo rearrangement at a high rate, the inserted foreign genes are maintained through multiple rounds of viral replication. Furthermore, adenoviruses are found in a large number of different species, with most adults having had exposure to serotypes most commonly used in gene therapy. The low [[pathogenicity]] in humans of adenoviruses only result in symptoms associated with the [[common cold]].<ref name= "one" />

== Oncolytic Conditionally Replicative Adenoviruses (CRAds) ==
Adenovirus replication may be regulated in a variety of means for the purpose of generating a CRAd. Most of these methods may be broadly classified into two major strategies. The first strategy includes completely or partially deleting the viral genes that have become expendable in tumor cells, such as genes responsible for cell cycle activation through [[p53]] (a [[tumor suppressor]] protein) or Rb binding.<ref name= "two"> Alemany, Ramon, et. al. “Replicative Adenoviruses for Cancer Therapy.” NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY 18 (2000): 723-27. </ref> The second strategy involves controlling the viral gene transcription through the replacement of native viral promoters with tumor-specific promoters (tsp).<ref name= "two" /> Such selective viral replication in tumor cells should ideally lead to lysis and death of the cells. 

McCormick’s group at Onyx proposed an adenoviral vector that utilized the first strategy. Since p53-deficient cells were common in tumors, an E1b-55kDa-deleted adenovirus was hypothesized as being able to replicate selectively. The E1b-55k gene encodes a protein that binds and inactivates p53 in normal cells to start viral replication. Since E1b-55kDa-deleted adenovirus is not able to inactivate p53, they would not be able to replicate in normal cells. However, in cancer cells that have lost p53, an E1b-55kDa-deleted adenovirus could replicate since there is no requirement for the E1b-55kDa protein to inactivate p53.<ref> Bischoff, J.R. et al. An adenovirus mutant that replicates selectively in p53-deficient human tumor cells. Science 274, 373–376 (1996).</ref> Despite the novel idea, the E1b-55kDa-deleted adenovirus, known as dl 1520 or Onyx – 015 proved to be a failure. In experiments that involved a variety of cell lines, Rothmann reported a lack of [[correlation]] between p53 status and dl 1520 replication after titering the viral progeny.<ref> Rothmann, T., Hengstermann, A., Whitaker, N.J., Scheffner, M. & zur Hausen, H. Replication of ONYX-015, a potential anticancer adenovirus, is independent of p53 status in tumor cells. J. Virol. 72, 9470–9478 (1998).</ref> 

Hallenbeck from Novartis and Henderson from Calydon pursued the second strategy. They started efforts to treat hepatocellular and prostate [[carcinomas]] by using α-fetoprotein (AFP) and [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA) promoters to drive the adenovirus E1a gene, respectively.<ref> Yu, D.C., Sakamoto, G.T. & Henderson, D.R. Identification of the transcriptional regulatory sequences of human kallikrein 2 and their use in the construction of calydon virus 764, an attenuated replication competent adenovirus for prostate cancer therapy. Cancer Res. 59, 1498–504 (1999).</ref><ref> Hallenbeck,P.L.etal.A novel tumor-specific replication-restricted adenoviral vector for gene therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hum. Gene Ther. 10, 1721–33 (1999).</ref><ref> Rodriguez, R. et al. Prostate attenuated replication competent adenovirus (ARCA) CN706: a selective cytotoxic for prostate-specific antigen-positive prostate cancer cells. Cancer Res. 57, 2559–2563 (1997).</ref> However, these efforts did not prove too promising as well. Even though there was some degree of [[specificity]] with these promoters, the cellular promoters were not able to keep proper fidelity in the viral genome.<ref> Babiss, L.E., Friedman, J.M. & Darnell, J.E., Jr. Cellular promoters incorporated into the adenovirus genome. Effect of viral DNA replication on endogenous and exogenous gene transcription. J Mol Biol 193, 643–650 (1987).</ref> Specificity was prevented through even low levels of viral products such as E1a that were sufficient for replication.<ref name= "two" /> 

=== Delivery and intratumoral spread of replicative adenoviral vectors ===
Tumor targeting should be emphasized in order to spare normal cells from infection, thus minimizing [[toxicity]]. The delivery requirements for localized or disseminated cancer may be drastically different.<ref name= "two" /> Tumor targeting in localized tumors may not be critical because direct injection routes offer high rates of success. However, systematic delivery is required for disseminated cancer, thus increasing the role for tumor targeting.<ref name= "two" /> 

Adenoviruses get cleared from the blood very effectively,<ref> Duncan, S.J. et al. Infection of mouse liver by human adenovirus type 5. J. Gen. Virol. 40, 45–61 (1978).</ref> especially by the liver Kupffer cells. Capsid modifications done to alter charge or hydrophobicity may be performed to increase virus persistence in the blood and thus facilitate virus delivery to the tumors.<ref name= "two" /> 

Passive tumor targeting may be accounted for due to the [[porosity]] of the endothelial barrier. Besides the [[spleen]] and the liver vessels, only tumor vessels allow the [[extravasation]] of particles in the adenovirus size range.<ref name= "two" /> Through the attachment of antibodies or other ligands, such as epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, to its capsid, adenovirus has been able to achieve active tumor targeting.<ref> Gu, D.L. et al. Fibroblast growth factor 2 retargeted adenovirus has redirected cellular tropism: evidence for reduced toxicity and enhanced antitumor activity in mice. Cancer Res. 59, 2608–2614 (1999).</ref><ref> Curiel, D.T. Strategies to adapt adenoviral vectors for targeted delivery. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 886, 158–171 (1999). </ref>  
 
In contrast with delivery that requires the removal of natural tropisms of adenovirus, intratumoral spread requires the tropism to be broadened to many different entry pathways. Furthermore, intratumoral spread requires capsid modifications to be genetically incorporated in order for them to be present in progeny.<ref name= "two" /> In order to broaden tropism, small peptides such as stretches of lysine to bind heparan sulfate and RGD-motif containing peptides to bind αv integrins have been inserted.<ref> Dmitriev, I. et al. An adenovirus vector with genetically modified fibers demonstrates expanded tropism via utilization of a coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor-independent cell entry mechanism. J. Virol. 72, 9706–9713 (1998). </ref><ref> Staba, M.J., Wickham, T.J., Kovesdi, I. & Hallahan, D.E. Modifications of the fiber in adenovirus vectors increase tropism for malignant glioma models. Cancer Gene Ther. 7, 13–19 (2000).</ref> The oncolytic potential of Onyx-015 in vitro and in vivo increased through the insertion of a polylysine at the fiber C terminus.<ref> Shinoura, N. et al. Highly augmented cytopathic effect of a fiber-mutant E1B-defective adenovirus for gene therapy of gliomas. Cancer Res. 59, 3411–3416 (1999).</ref>

=== Immune response control of replicative adenoviruses ===
Virotherapy can be severly hindered by the neutralizing [[immune response]]. Patients with elevated serum neutralizing antibodies were found to have less frequent therapeutic responses when tested in early clinical trials with wild-type adenovirus.<ref> Smith, R.R., Huebner, R.J., Rowe, W.P., Schatten, W.F. & Thomas, L.B. Studies on the use of viruses in the treatment of carcinoma of the cervix. Cancer 9, 1211–1218 (1956).</ref> However, lack of appropriate animal models has impeded progress in the study of the immune system with replicative adenoviruses <ref name= "two" />. The replication of Ad2 in murine cells have been studied.<ref> Ganly, I., Mautner, V. & Balmain, A. Productive replication of human adenoviruses in mouse epidermal cells. J. Virol. 74, 2895–2899 (2000).</ref> to determine a suitable murine model. The cell lines B9 and SN161 were reported to produce progeny at levels 50 fold and 25 fold, respectively, lower than the human A2780Cp cell line. Such work may eventually lead to immune-competent animal models that allow for virotherapy and the study of immune system modulation.

=== Multimodality treatments of replicative adenoviruses ===
Besides being used singularly, replicative adenoviruses have also been used in combination with conventional anti-cancer approaches.<ref name= “seventeen”> Curiel, David T. “The Development of Conditionally Replicative Adenoviruses for Cancer Therapy.” Clinical Cancer Research 6 (2000): 3395-399.</ref> The efficacy of such an approach has been studied through the configuration of a toxin gene, such as cytosine deaminase or herpes thymidine kinase, into replicative adenoviruses.<ref name = “seventeen” /> Freytag developed a replicative adenovirus configured with a thymidine kinase / cytosine deaminase fusion gene and found that the toxin killed cells with administration of the prodrug and increased tumor sensitivity to radiation.<ref> Freytag, S. O., Rogulski, K. R., Paielli, D. L., Gilbert, J. D., and Ki, J. H. A novel three-pronged approach to kill cancer cells selectively: concomitant viral, double suicide gene, and radiotherapy. Hum. Gene Ther., 9: 1323–1333, 1998.</ref> 

A novel combination therapy that has been attempted utilizes both conditionally replicating adenovirus and replication defective adenovirus. Lee et. al. hypothesized that E1 deleted adenoviruses can become replication-competent when co-transduced with CRAd, with the resulting increased production of E1 deleted adenoviruses helping to increase [[transduction]] efficiency.<ref name= “thirtyeight”> Lee, C.-T. “Combination Therapy with Conditionally Replicating Adenovirus and Replication Defective Adenovirus.” Cancer Research 64.18 (2004): 6660-665. </ref> It was reported that the combination of CRAd and an E1 deleted adenovirus did indeed show increased gene transfer and therapeutic efficacy in model tumors in vivo.<ref name = “thirtyeight” />

== The future of CRAds: Arming them ==
Even though CRAds such as Onyx-015 or CN706 have been used clinically, the results often indicated that although the oncolytic adenoviruses are safe, they are not able to alter significantly the progression of cancer.<ref name= “nineteen”> Cody, J. J., and J. T. Douglas. “Armed Replicating Adenoviruses for Cancer Virotherapy.” Cancer Gene Therapy 16.6 (2009): 473-88. </ref> In order to increase the potency of CRAds, they may be used as a platform for delivery of a therapeutic transgene. This creates an armed replicating adenovirus that increases antitumor properties because the transgene dose is augmented by viral replication.<ref> Hermiston T. Gene delivery from replication-selective viruses: arming guided missiles in the war against cancer. J Clin Invest 2000; 105: 1169–1172.</ref>

The placement of transgenes is crucial in a CRAd. Since replication is crucial to the functioning of the CRAd, an insert should not disrupt CRAd replication. Such disruption could occur either by transgene activity or by genomic alterations caused by the insert.<ref name = “nineteen” /> Furthermore, since Ad5 can only stably accommodate up to 38kb, these packaging limits must be taken into account.  In order to use the adenoviral genome space to its maximum, the [[endogenous]] gene expression machinery such as promoter or polyadenylation and splicing signal can be used.<ref name = “nineteen” /> Furthermore, since adenoviral genes are well characterized, transgene expression may be predictably modulated.<ref name = “nineteen” />

=== Transgene under endogenous control ===
Armed CRAds may use native expression of viral genomic control. The transgene is inserted in replacement of the viral gene that is unnecessary for replication in the target cells.<ref name = “nineteen” />. Direct expression of the transgene is allowed since the native gene control elements are untouched. Since the E3 transcription unit is not critical for viral replication,<ref name = “nineteen” /> Doronin et. al. deleted the entire E3 region and reinserted the gene coding for adenovirus death protein (ADP).<ref name = “twentyone”> Doronin K, Toth K, Kuppuswamy M, Ward P, Tollefson AE, Wold WS. Tumor-specific, replication-competent adenovirus vectors overexpressing the adenovirus death protein. J Virol 2000; 74: 6147–6155. </ref>, an E3 gene product leading to cell lysis and viral release.<ref> Tollefson AE, Scaria A, Hermiston TW, Ryerse JS, Wold LJ, Wold WS. The adenovirus death protein (E3-11.6K) is required at very late stages of infection for efficient cell lysis and release of adenovirus from infected cells. J Virol 1996; 70: 2296–2306. </ref> Therefore, late in the infection cycle, ADP was expressed by the major late promoter and led to high levels of expression. <ref name = “twentyone” /> 

Endogenous control is also utilized by linking a transgene to a viral gene by an [[internal ribosome entry site]] (IRES), thus allowing both genes to be expressed in a single transcript. The transgene is thus expressed in the same amount and timing as the gene that it is linked to <ref name = “nineteen” />. Researchers have linked a therapeutic transgene to the viral fiber gene and expressed p53 <ref> Sauthoff H, Pipiya T, Heitner S, Chen S, Norman RG, Rom WN et al. Late expression of p53 from a replicating adenovirus improves tumor cell killing and is more tumor cell specific than expression of the adenoviral death protein. Hum Gene Ther 2002; 13: 1859–1871.  </ref>, nitroreductase <ref> Lukashev AN, Fuerer C, Chen MJ, Searle P, Iggo R. Late expression of nitroreductase in an oncolytic adenovirus sensitizes colon cancer cells to the prodrug CB1954. Hum Gene Ther 2005; 16: 1473–1483.  </ref>, and yeast cytosine deaminase <ref> Fuerer C,Iggo R. 5-Fluorocytosine increases the toxicity of Wnt-targeting replicating adenoviruses that express cytosine deaminase as a late gene. Gene Therapy 2004; 11: 142–151. </ref>, among others. All of the studies found that the inserted transgene was expressed late in the infection cycle to high levels <ref name = “nineteen” />.
 
=== Transgene under exogenous control ===
Armed CRAds can also be placed under the control of a non-native promoter. The E3 region, which is nonessential for viral replication, is often deleted to insert larger expression cassettes than may be accommodated by the wild-type genome. <ref name = “nineteen” /> and they can be divided into two broad strategies. Firstly, the expression of a single transcript that has a therapeutic transgene linked by IRES to the viral E1A gene, is driven by the exogenous promoter (usually tsp or constitutively active promoter).<ref name = “nineteen” /> This strategy was utilized by Ye et. al. when they constructed a CRAd with an E1A-IRES-TRAIL cassette driven by an AFP promoter.<ref> Ye X, Lu Q, Zhao Y, Ren Z, Ren XW, Qiu QH et. al. Conditionally replicative adenovirus vector carrying TRAIL gene for enhanced oncolysis of human hepatocellular carcinoma. Int J Mol Med 2005; 16: 1179–1184. </ref> 

The second strategy involves CRAds where a TSP or constitutively active [[promoter]] only drives the transgene expression.<ref name = “nineteen” /> In efforts to increase the efficacy of Onyx-015 and improve selectively of replication, numerous researchers have inserted transgenes in place of the E1B-55k gene.<ref> Freytag SO, Rogulski KR, Paielli DL, Gilbert JD, Kim JH. A novel three-pronged approach to kill cancer cells selectively: concomitant viral, double suicide gene, and radiotherapy. Hum Gene Ther 1998; 9: 1323–1333.</ref><ref> Zhang ZL, Zou WG, Luo CX, Li BH, Wang JH, Sun LY et al. An armed oncolytic adenovirus system, ZD55-gene, demonstrating potent antitumoral efficacy. Cell Res 2003; 13: 481–489.</ref>  

=== Therapeutic transgenes used in armed CRAds ===
==== Transgenes that enhance cell killing ====
The purpose of this class of transgenes is to bring about death of the cancer cell, independent of any viral [[oncolytic]] effect. Interfering nucleic acids aimed towards cell-cycle regulators are able to stimulate cell death <ref name = “nineteen” />. Researchers have constructed viruses where antisense cDNAs directed against gene encoding checkpoint kinase 1 <ref> Gao Q, Zhou J, Huang X, Chen G, Ye F,Lu Y et. al. Selective targeting of checkpoint kinase 1 in tumor cells with a novel potent oncolytic adenovirus. Mol Ther 2006; 13: 928–937. </ref> and 2 <ref> Chen G, Zhou J, Gao Q, Huang X, Li K, Zhuang L et al. Oncolytic adenovirus-mediated transfer of the antisense chk2 selectively inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Cancer Gene Ther 2006; 13: 930–939.</ref> have been inserted in place of another gene. As compared to unarmed controls for orthotopic models of hepatocellular cacinoma, intravenous administration of the virus along with cisplatin (chemotherapy drug) led to metastatic reductions and survival improvements <ref name = “nineteen” />. Stimulating apoptosis of the cancer cell has also been attempted to kill the cell. In comparison with CRAds expressing a reporter gene in a subcutaneous model of hepatocellular carcinoma, CRAds armed with a cytokine signaling 3 suppressor were more effective at tumor suppression <ref> Cui Q, Jiang W, Wang Y, Lv C, Luo J, Zhang W et. al. Transfer of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 by an oncolytic adenovirus induces potential antitumor activities in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatology 2008; 47: 105–112. </ref>

==== Transgenes that modulate the tumor micro-environment ====
	Since both tumors and metastasis require extracellular matrix remodeling and new vascularization <ref> Liotta LA, Kohn EC. The microenvironment of the tumour-host interface. Nature 2001; 411: 375–379. </ref>, CRAds targeting the tumor stroma (supportive framework of cancer call) usually try to modulate the extracellular matrix or inhibit angiogenesis. Researchers have successfully armed CRAds by inserting a gene in place of the E1B-55k gene that encodes for a strong antiangiogenic factor known as murine endostatin that inhibits endothelial cell proliferation. In subcutaneous models of hepatocellular carcinoma, such armed CRAds showed improved tumor suppression capabilities <ref> Li GC, Yang JM, Nie MM, Su CG, Sun LC, Qian YZ et al. Potent antitumoral effects of a novel gene-viral therapeutic system CNHK300-mEndostatin in hepatocellular carcinoma. Chin Med J (Engl) 2005; 118: 179–185. </ref>. 

==== Transgenes that stimulate immune response towards tumor ====
	The purpose of such transgenes is to recruit immune cells to the site of cancer and induce activation and proliferation. Such transgenes have an advantage in that recruitment of the immune system not only has the potential to destroy the primary tumor, but may also facilitate clearance of metastasis and long term benefits in suppressing recurrence <ref name = “nineteen” />. Monocyte chemotactic protein 3 (MCP-3) has been successfully expressed in a CRAd as part of a multiple transgene expression <ref> Bauzon M, Castro D, Karr M, Hawkins LK, Hermiston TW. Multigene expression from a replicating adenovirus using native viral promoters. Mol Ther 2003; 7: 526–534. </ref>.

== Novel ways of engineering Adenovirus for cancer therapy ==
=== Telomerase-dependent oncolytic adenovirus for cancer treatment ===
	Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is only expressed by tumor cells and is absent is post-mitotic cells. Huang et. al. constructed a TERT promoter regulated CRAd by replacing the adenovirus E1A promoter with that of human TERT to achieve tumor specific oncolysis <ref name= “thirtyfive”> Huang, T-G. “Telomerase-dependent Oncolytic Adenovirus for Cancer Treatment.” Gene Therapy 10 (2003): 1241-247. </ref>. TERT promoter regulated CRAd replicated almost as efficiently as wild type adenovirus in TERT-positive cells but was drastically attenuated in TERT-negative cells <ref name = “thirtyfive” />. Tumor-selective replication and oncolysis in vivo was also demonstrated by an increase in adenovirus titers in tumor extracts by several orders of magnitude between 6 hour and 3 days post-vector injection into a mouse model of human hepatocellular carcinoma <ref name = “thirtyfive” />.   

=== Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activated oncolytic adenovirus for cancer therapy ===
	The hypoxic (deprived of oxygen supply) fraction of tumors is the population of cells that are most resistant to radio- and chemotherapies. In order to develop new therapies targeting this hypoxic fraction, researchers have examined the [[hypoxia-inducible factor]] (HIF) that mediates transcriptional responses to hypoxia by binding to hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE) in target genes <ref name= “thirtysix”> Post, Dawn E., and Erwin G. Van Meir. “A Novel Hypoxia-inducible Factor (HIF) Activated Oncolytic Adenovirus for Cancer Therapy.” Oncogene 22 (2003): 2065-072. </ref>. Post and Meir developed a hypoxia / HIF dependent replicative adenovirus  (HYPR-Ad) to target hypoxic cells and it was found to display hypoxia-dependent E1A expression <ref name = “thirtysix” />. Furthermore, HYPR-Ad was reported to show conditional cytolysis of hypoxic but not normoxic (adequate oxygen supply) cells, demonstrating that an attenuated oncolytic adenovirus can selectively lyse cells under hypoxic conditions <ref name = “thirtysix” />.

=== Adenovirus that targets loss of insulin-like growth factor 2 imprinting system ===
	Loss of imprinting (LOI) of the [[insulin]]-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene is an [[epigenetic]] abnormality that is found commonly in human colorectal neoplasms (abnormal mass due to abnormal growth of cells) <ref name= “thirtyseven”> Nie, Zhen-Lin. “Gene Therapy for Colorectal Cancer by an Oncolytic Adenovirus That Targets Loss of the Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Imprinting System.” Molecular Cancer 11.86 (2012): 1-10. </ref>. In order to investigate use of the IGF2 imprinting system for targeted gene therapy of colorectal cancer, Nie et. al. constructed a novel replication-selective oncolytic adenovirus, Ad315-E1A <ref name = “thirtyseven” />. It was reported that Ad315-E1A had a significant effect against tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo <ref name = “thirtyseven” />. Since an oncolytic adenovirus regulated by the IGF2 LOI system possesses a strong anti-tumor effect through induction of apoptoss in vitro and in vivo in human colorectal cancer cells, they could also possibly be extended for therapeutic use in a wide variety of tumors in which LOI exists <ref name = “thirtyseven” />.
