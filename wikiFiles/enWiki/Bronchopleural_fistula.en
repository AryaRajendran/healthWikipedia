A '''bronchopleural fistula''' ('''BPF''') is a [[fistula]] between the [[pleural space]] and the [[lung]]. It sometimes develops following [[pneumonectomy]] or an infection.<ref>Varoli F (1998) Endoscopic treatment of bronchopleural fistulas. Annals of Thoracic Surgery 65, 807-9</ref> It may also develop when large airways are in communication with the pleural space following a large [[pneumothorax]] or other loss of pleural negative pressure, especially during positive pressure [[mechanical ventilation]].
