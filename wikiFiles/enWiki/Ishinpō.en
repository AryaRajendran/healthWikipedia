The Ishinpō is notable for preserving some of the [[Taoist sexual practices|Taoist sexual manuals]] from the Han to the Tang dynasty. The twenty-eighth section of the Ishinpō contains a complete transcription of a Daoist text known as ''The Classic of Sunu'' which is a dialogue between the Dark Maiden and the [[Yellow Emperor]], with the former providing advice on sexual practices to the latter.

While the text is written in [[kanbun]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] terms are written to the side in [[Man'yōgana]] for plants, animals, and minerals.
