==Personal life==
Robert Koch was born in [[Klausthal|Klausthal, Hanover, Germany]] on December 11, 1843 to Hermann Koch and Mathilde Julie Henriette Biewand.<ref name="The Founders">Metchnikoff, Elie. ''The Founders of Modern Medicine: Pasteur, Koch, Lister.'' Classics of Medicine Library: Delanco, 2006. Print.</ref> Koch excelled in academics from an early age. Before entering school in the year 1848, Koch had taught himself how to read and write.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> He graduated from high school in 1862, having excelled and science and math.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> At the age of 19, Koch entered the [[University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]], studying natural science.<ref name="Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch">"Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch." ''World of Scientific Discovery.'' Gale, 2006. Biography In Context. Web. 14 Apr. 2013.</ref> However, after two semesters, Koch decided to change his area of study to medicine, as he aspired to be a physician.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> During Koch’s fifth semester of medical school, [[Jacob Henle]], an anatomist who had published a theory of contagion in 1840, asked Koch to participate in his research project on uterine nerve structure.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> In his sixth semester, Koch began to conduct research at the Physiological Institute, where he studied succinic acid secretion.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> This would eventually form the basis of his dissertation.<ref name="Robert Koch A Life"/> In January 1866, Koch graduated from medical school, earning honors of the highest distinction.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> In July 1867, following his graduation from medical school, Koch married Emma Adolfine Josephine Fraatz, and the two had a daughter, Gertrude, in 1868.<ref name="Robert Koch A Life"/> After his graduation in 1866, he worked as a surgeon in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and following his service, worked as a physician in what today is known as [[Wolsztyn|Wolsztyn, Poland]].<ref name="Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch"/> Koch’s marriage with Emma Fraatz ended in 1893, and later that same year, he married actress Hedwig Freiberg.<ref name="Robert Koch A Life"/> From 1885 to 1890, Koch served as an administrator and professor at Berlin University.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> Koch suffered a heart attack on April 9, 1910 and never made a complete recovery.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> On May 27, only three days after giving a lecture on his tuberculosis research at the Berlin Academy of Sciences, Robert Koch died at Baeden Baeden at the age of 67.<ref name="Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch"/> Following his death, the Institute named its establishment after him in his honor.<ref name="Robert Koch"/>

==Research contributions==

===Anthrax===
Robert Koch is widely-known for his work with [[anthrax]], discovering the causative agent of the fatal disease to be ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.<ref name="Germ theory of disease">"Germ theory of disease." ''World of Microbiology and Immunology.'' Ed. Brenda Wilmoth Lerner and K. Lee Lerner. Detroit: Gale, 2007. Biography In Context. Web. 14 Apr. 2013.</ref> Koch discovered spore-formation in the anthrax bacteria, which could remain dormant under specific conditions.<ref name="Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch"/> However, under optimal conditions, he found that the spores were activated and caused disease.<ref name="Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch"/> To determine this causative agent, he dry-fixed bacterial cultures onto glass slides, used dyes to stain the cultures, and then observed them through a microscope.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> Koch’s work with anthrax is notable in that he was the first to link a particular microorganism with a given disease, rejecting the idea of spontaneous generation and proving the germ theory of disease.<ref name="Germ theory of disease"/>

===Koch's Four Postulates===
Koch accepted a position as government advisor with the Imperial Department of Health in 1880.<ref name="Tuberculosis, overview">O’Connor, T.M. “Tuberculosis, Overview.” ''International Encyclopedia of Public Health.'' 2008. Web.</ref> During his time as government advisor, he published a report in which he stated the importance of pure cultures in isolating disease-causing organisms and explained the necessary steps to obtain these cultures, methods which are summarized in [[Koch's postulates|Koch’s four postulates]].<ref name="Bacteriology, historical">Amsterdamska, Olga. “Bacteriology, Historical.” ''International Encyclopedia of Public Health.'' 2008. Web.</ref> Koch’s discovery of the causative agent of anthrax led to the formation of a generic set of postulates which can be used in the determination of the cause of any infectious disease.<ref name="Germ theory of disease"/> These postulates, which not only outlined a method for linking cause and effect of an infectious disease but also established the significance of laboratory culture of infectious agents, are listed here:
1.	The organism must always be present, in every case of the disease.
2.	The organism must be isolated from a host containing the disease and grown in pure culture.
3.	Samples of the organism taken from pure culture must cause the same disease when inoculated into a healthy, susceptible animal in the laboratory.
4.	The organism must be isolated from the inoculated animal and must be identified as the same original organism first isolated from the originally diseased host.<ref name="Germ theory of disease"/>

===Isolating pure culture on solid media===
Koch began conducting research on microorganisms in a laboratory that was connected to his patient examination room.<ref name="Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch"/> Koch’s early research in this laboratory proved to yield one of his major contributions to the field of microbiology, as it was there that he developed the technique of growing bacteria. Koch's second postulate calls for the isolation and growth of a selected pathogen in [[Pure culture|pure laboratory culture]].<ref name="Brock Biology of Microorganisms">Madigan, Michael T., et al. ''Brock Biology of Microorganisms: Thirteenth edition.'' Benjamin Cummings: Boston, 2012. Print.</ref> In an attempt to grow bacteria, Koch began to use solid nutrients such as potato slices.<ref name="Brock Biology of Microorganisms"/> Through these initial experiments, Koch observed individual colonies of identical, pure cells.<ref name="Brock Biology of Microorganisms"/> Coming to the conclusion that potato slices were not suitable media for all organisms, Koch later began to use nutrient solutions with gelatin.<ref name="Brock Biology of Microorganisms"/> However, he soon realized that gelatin, like potato slices, was not the optimal medium for bacterial growth, as it did not remain solid at 37˚C, the ideal temperature for growth of most human pathogens.<ref name="Brock Biology of Microorganisms"/> Therefore, Koch eventually began to utilize [[agar]] to grow and isolate pure cultures, as this [[polysaccharide]] remains solid at 37˚C, is not degraded by most bacteria, and results in a transparent medium.<ref name="Brock Biology of Microorganisms"/>

===Cholera===
Koch next turned his attention to [[cholera]], and began to conduct research in Egypt in the hopes of isolating the causative agent of the disease.<ref name="Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch"/> However, Koch was not able to complete the task before the epidemic in Egypt ended, and he subsequently went to India to continue with his study.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> In India, Koch was indeed able to determine the causative agent of cholera, isolating ''[[Vibrio cholerae|Vibrio cholera]]''.<ref name="Robert Koch"/>

===Tuberculosis===
During his time as the government advisor with the Imperial Department of Health in Berlin in the 1880s, Robert Koch became interested in [[tuberculosis]] research.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> At the time, it was widely believed that tuberculosis was an inherited disease.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> However, Koch was convinced that the disease was caused by a bacterium and was infectious, and tested his four postulates using guinea pigs.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> Through these experiments, Koch found that his experiments with tuberculosis satisfied all four of his postulates.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> In 1882, he published his findings on tuberculosis, in which he found the causative agent of the disease to be the slow-growing ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.<ref name="Brock Biology of Microorganisms"/> His work with this particular disease won Koch the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology and Medicine in 1905.<ref name="Robert Koch"/> Additionally, Koch's research on tuberculosis, along with his studies on tropical diseases, won him the Prussian Order Pour le Merits in 1906 and the [[Robert Koch Medal|Robert Koch medal]], established to honor the greatest living physicians, in 1908.<ref name="Robert Koch"/>
