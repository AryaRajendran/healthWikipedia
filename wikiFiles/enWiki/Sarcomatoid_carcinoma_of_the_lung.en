'''Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung''' is a term that encompasses five distinct [[histological]] subtypes of [[lung cancer]], including (1) pleomorphic carcinoma, (2) spindle cell carcinoma, (3) giant cell carcinoma, (4) carcinosarcoma, or (5) pulmonary blastoma.<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

==Lung Cancer Classification==

Lung cancer is a large and exceptionally [[heterogeneous]] family of malignancies.<ref name='RoggliVollmer'>{{cite journal |author=Roggli VL, Vollmer RT, Greenberg SD, McGavran MH, Spjut HJ, Yesner R |title=Lung cancer heterogeneity: a blinded and randomized study of 100 consecutive cases |journal=Hum.

Approximately 98% of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]], a term for malignant neoplasms derived from cells of epithelial lineage, and/or that exhibit cytological or tissue architectural features characteristically found in epithelial cells.<ref name='TravisTravis'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, Travis LB, Devesa SS |title=Lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=191–202 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=8000996 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y}}</ref> Under WHO-2004, lung carcinomas are divided into 8 major taxa:<ref name='who2004'/>

*[[Squamous cell carcinoma]]
*[[Small_cell_carcinoma#Lung|Small cell carcinoma]]
*[[Adenocarcinoma]]
*[[Large-cell lung carcinoma|Large cell carcinoma]]
*[[Adenosquamous lung carcinoma|Adenosquamous carcinoma]]
*Sarcomatoid carcinoma
*[[Carcinoid|Carcinoid tumor]]
*[[Salivary gland–like carcinoma of the lung|Salivary gland-like carcinoma]]

Sarcomatoid carcinomas are unique among lung carcinomas in that, although they are considered carcinomas, they contain cytological and tissue architectural features that are usually characteristic of [[sarcoma]].<ref name='who2004'/>

==Histogenesis and Genetics==

Abnormal duplication of the [[EGFR gene]] is a relatively infrequent phenomenon in SCL (>/= 4 copies in >/= 40% of cells in 5/22)<ref name='ItalianoCortot'>{{cite journal |author=Italiano A, Cortot AB, Ilie M, ''et al.'' |title=EGFR and KRAS status of primary sarcomatoid carcinomas of the lung: implications for anti-EGFR treatment of a rare lung malignancy |journal=Int. J. Cancer |volume=125 |issue=10 |pages=2479–82 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19681124 |doi=10.1002/ijc.24610 }}</ref>

Overexpression of the [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]] [[protein]] occurs in nearly all cases (22/22).<ref name='ItalianoCortot' />

Mutations of the EGFR gene are relatively rare (0/23).<ref name='ItalianoCortot' />

K-ras mutations found in 8/22 cases (Gly12Cys in 6 cases and Gly12Val in 2 cases)<ref name='ItalianoCortot' />

==Treatment==

Because these tumors are so rare, there have been no randomized clinical trials yet conducted with respect to specific treatment regimens for any subtype.<ref name='Pubmed'>National Library of Medicine. Available at http://www.pubmed.com</ref><ref name='NIHClinicalTrials'>National Institutes of Health. Clinical Trials Search Engine. Available at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=sarcomatoid+carcinoma</ref>

Very few histospecific studies of individual subtypes SCL have been published in the literature; most data has been small retrospective case series or case reports.

In many cases, SCL are generally treated like other NSCLC. However, as SCL are considered particularly aggressive non-small cell lung cancers,<ref name="ItalianoCortot"/> some experts recommend particularly aggressive treatment approach to these tumors.

Little is known about the effects of EGFR inhibitors in SC, although some evidence suggests that these tumors are not likely to be highly responsive.<ref name="ItalianoCortot"/>

==Prognosis==

As a group, SCL prognosis is considered to be worse than that of most types of NSCLC.
