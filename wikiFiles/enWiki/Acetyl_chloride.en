'''Acetyl chloride''', CH<sub>3</sub>COCl, also known as '''ethanoyl chloride''' or '''acyl chloride''', is an [[acid chloride]] derived from [[acetic acid]]. It belongs to the class of [[organic compound]]s called [[acyl halide]]s. It is a colorless [[liquid]].  

==Synthesis==
The usual method involves the reaction of [[acetic acid]] with standard inorganic chlorodehydrating agents, such as by using [[Phosphorus trichloride|PCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[Phosphorus pentachloride|PCl<sub>5</sub>]], [[Sulfuryl chloride|SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]], or [[Thionyl chloride|SOCl<sub>2</sub>]]. However, this usually gives acetyl chloride which is contaminated by phosphorus or sulfur impurities, which may interfere with the organic reactions.<ref name="HdBook">{{cite book| title = Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Activating Agents and Protective Groups| chapter = Acetyl chloride| author1 = Leo A. Paquette| author2 = | publisher = John Wiley & Sons| year = 2005| isbn = 978-0-471-97927-2| page = 16}}</ref>

It is produced by the reaction of [[hydrogen chloride]] with [[acetic anhydride]]:<ref>Hosea Cheung, Robin S. Tanke, G. Paul Torrence “Acetic Acid” in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a01_045}}</ref>
:(CH<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O + HCl  →  CH<sub>3</sub>COCl + CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H

HCl impurities can be removed by distilling the crude product from [[dimethylaniline]] or by degassing the mixture by a stream of [[argon]]. 

It may also be synthesized from the catalytic [[carbonylation]] of [[methyl chloride]].<ref>{{cite patent|US|4352761}}</ref>
[[File:Fisher Acetyl Chloride.jpg|thumb|left|Can containing a bottle of acetyl chloride]] Heating [[dichloroacetic acid|dichloroacetic chloride]] with acetic acid also gives acetyl chloride in 70% yield.<ref name="HdBook" />

==Occurrence==
Acetyl chloride is not expected to exist in nature, because contact with [[water (molecule)|water]] would [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] it into acetic acid and [[hydrogen chloride]]. In fact, if handled in open air it releases white "smoke" resulting from hydrolysis due to the moisture in the air. The smoke is actually small droplets of [[hydrochloric acid]] formed by hydrolysis.

==Uses==
It is a chemical for [[acetylation]] in the [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] or derivatization of [[organic compound]]s.  Examples of acetylation reactions include [[acylation]] processes such as [[esterification]] (see below) and the [[Friedel-Crafts reaction]].
:CH<sub>3</sub>COCl + [[Ethanol|HO-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>]]  →  [[Ethyl acetate|CH<sub>3</sub>-COO-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>]]  +  [[Hydrogen chloride|H-Cl]]

Frequently such acylations are carried out in the presence of a base such as [[pyridine]], [[triethylamine]], or [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine|DMAP]], which act as [[catalyst]]s to help promote the reaction and as [[base (chemistry)|base]]s [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralize]] the resulting HCl. Such reactions will often proceed via [[ketene]].

Acetylation is the introduction of an [[acetyl]] group via [[acylation]] using a [[reactant]] such as acetyl chloride or [[acetic anhydride]].  An acetyl group is an [[acyl]] group having the formula
:-C(=O)-CH<sub>3</sub>

For further information on the types of chemical reactions compounds such as acetyl chloride can undergo, see [[acyl halide]].
