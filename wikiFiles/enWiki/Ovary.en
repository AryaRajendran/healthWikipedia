The '''ovary''' is an [[ovum]]-producing reproductive organ, often found in pairs as part of the [[vertebrate]] [[female]] [[reproductive system]]. Ovaries in female individuals are analogous to [[testicle|testes]] in male individuals, in that they are both [[gonad]]s and [[endocrine gland]]s.

==Human anatomy==
The ovary (for a given side) is located in the lateral wall of the pelvis in a region called the [[ovarian fossa]]. The fossa usually lies beneath the [[external iliac artery]] and in front of the [[ureter]] and the [[internal iliac artery]].

The ovaries are not attached to the [[fallopian tube]]s but to the outer layer of the [[uterus]] via the [[ovarian ligaments]]. Usually each ovary takes turns releasing eggs every month; however, if there was a case where one ovary was absent or dysfunctional then the other ovary would continue providing eggs to be released.

===Hormones===
Ovaries secrete both [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]]. Estrogen is responsible for the appearance of [[secondary sex characteristics]] for females at [[puberty]] and for the maturation and maintenance of the reproductive organs in their mature functional state. Progesterone prepares uterus for pregnancy, and mammary gland for lactation. Progesterone functions with estrogen by promoting [[menstrual cycle]] changes in the [[endometrium]].

===Ligaments===
In the human the paired ovaries lie within the pelvic cavity, on either side of the uterus, to which they are attached via a fibrous cord called the [[ovarian ligament]]. The ovaries are uncovered in the [[peritoneal cavity]] but are tethered to the body wall via the [[suspensory ligament of the ovary]]. The part of the [[broad ligament of the uterus]] that covers the ovary is known as the [[mesovarium]]. Thus, the ovary is the only organ in the human body which is totally invaginated into the peritonium, making it the only intraperitoneal organ (not to be confused with interperitoneal).

===Extremities===
There are two extremities to the ovary:
* The end to which the [[uterine tube]] attaches is called the ''tubal extremity''.
* The other extremity is called the ''uterine extremity''.  It points downward, and it is attached to the uterus via the ovarian ligament.

===Histology===

* [[Ovarian follicle|Follicular cells]]  flat epithelial cells that originate from surface epithelium covering the ovary
* [[Granulosa cell]]s - surrounding follicular cells have changed from flat to cuboidal and proliferated to produce a stratified epithelium
* [[Gametes]]<ref>Langman's Medical Embryology, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 10th ed, 2006</ref>

* The outermost layer is called the [[ovarian surface epithelium]] (previously known as the ''germinal epithelium'').
* The ''ovarian [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]'' consists of [[ovarian follicles]] and [[stroma of ovary|stroma]] in between them. Included in the follicles are the [[cumulus oophorus]], [[membrana granulosa]] (and the [[granulosa cells]] inside it), [[corona radiata (embryology)|corona radiata]], [[zona pellucida]], and [[primary oocyte]]. The zona pellucida, [[theca of follicle]], [[Follicular antrum|antrum]] and [[liquor folliculi]] are also contained in the follicle. Also in the cortex is the [[corpus luteum]] derived from the follicles.
* The innermost layer is the ''[[ovarian medulla]]''. It can be hard to distinguish between the cortex and medulla, but follicles are usually not found in the medulla.

==In other animals==
Ovaries of some kind are found in the female reproductive system of many animals that employ [[sexual reproduction]], including invertebrates. However, they develop in a very different way in most invertebrates than they do in vertebrates, and are not truly homologous.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 383–385|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

Many of the features found in human ovaries are common to all vertebrates, including the presence of follicular cells, tunica albuginea, and so on. However, many species produce a far greater number of eggs during their lifetime than do humans, so that, in fish and amphibians, there may be hundreds, or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary at any given time. In these species, fresh eggs may be developing from the germinal epithelium throughout life. Corpora lutea are found only in mammals, and in some [[elasmobranch]] fish; in other species, the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary. In birds, reptiles, and [[monotreme]]s, the egg is relatively large, filling the follicle, and distorting the shape of the ovary at maturity.<ref name=VB/>

Amphibians and reptiles have no ovarian medulla; the central part of the ovary is a hollow, [[lymph]]-filled space. The ovary of [[teleost]]s is also often hollow, but in this case, the eggs are shed into the cavity, which opens into the [[oviduct]].<ref name=VB/>

Although most normal female vertebrates have two ovaries, this is not the case in all species. In most birds and in [[platypus]]es, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional. (Exceptions include the Kiwi and some, but not all raptors, in which both ovaries persist.<ref>Fitzpatrick, F. L.  1934.  Unilateral and bilateral ovaries in raptorial birds.  The Wilson Bulletin 46 (1): 19-22.</ref><ref>Kinsky, F. C.  1971.  The consistent presence of paired ovaries in the Kiwi(Apteryx) with some discussion of this condition in other birds. Journal of Ornithology 112 (3): 334–357.</ref>)  In some elasmobranchs, only the right ovary develops fully. In the primitive [[jawless fish]], and some teleosts, there is only one ovary, formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo.<ref name=VB/>

==Cryopreservation==
[[Cryopreservation]] of ovarian tissue, often called [http://myoncofertility.org/animations/ovarian_tissue_cryopreservation_basics Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation], is of interest to women who want to preserve their reproductive function beyond the natural limit, or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer therapy,<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1530/REP-09-0039 | author=Isachenko V, Lapidus I, Isachenko E, ''et al''. | title=Human ovarian tissue vitrification versus conventional freezing: morphological, endocrinological, and molecular biological evaluation. | journal=Reproduction | year=2009 | pages=319–27 | issue=2 | volume=138 | pmid=19439559}}</ref> for example in hematologic malignancies or breast cancer.<ref name=Oktay/> The procedure is to take a part of the ovary and carry out slow freezing before storing it in liquid nitrogen whilst therapy is undertaken. Tissue can then be thawed and implanted near the fallopian, either orthotopic (on the natural location) or heterotopic (on the abdominal wall),<ref name=Oktay/> where it starts to produce new eggs, allowing normal conception to take place.<ref>[http://www.saintluc.be/actualites/presse/2004/2004-tamara-lancet-complet.pdf Livebirth after orthotopic transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue] The Lancet, Sep 24, 2004</ref> A study of 60 procedures concluded that ovarian tissue harvesting appears to be safe.<ref name=Oktay>{{cite journal |author=Oktay K, Oktem O |title=Ovarian cryopreservation and transplantation for fertility preservation for medical indications: report of an ongoing experience |journal=Fertil.

==Diseases==
[[Ovarian disease]]s can be classified as [[endocrine disorder]]s or as a disorders of the [[reproductive system]].

If the egg fails to release from the follicle in the ovary an [[ovarian cyst]] may form. Small ovarian cysts are common in healthy women. Some women have more follicles than usual ([[polycystic ovary syndrome]]), which inhibits the follicles to grow normally and this will cause cycle irregularities.

Other conditions include:
* [[Ovarian cancer]]
* [[Luteoma]]
* [[Hypogonadism]]
* [[Hyperthecosis]]
