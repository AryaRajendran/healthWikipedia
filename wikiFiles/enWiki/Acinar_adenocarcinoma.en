'''Acinar adenocarcinoma''' is a [[histological]] subtype of gland-forming [[cancer]] that is diagnosed when cuboidal and/or columnar shaped [[malignant]] cells in the [[neoplastic]] tissue form [[acinus|acini]] and [[tubules]].<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92 832 2418 3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf }}</ref> It is a common form of cancer occurring in the [[lung]] and [[prostate]] gland.

==Acinar adenocarcinoma of the lung==

Adenocarcinoma (''"adeno"'' = "gland", ''"carcinoma"'' = cancer of [[epithelium]]) is the most common type of [[lung cancer]] in the U.S., Japan, and most of Western Europe, although it is the second most common form in Eastern parts of Europe (after [[squamous cell carcinoma]]).<ref name='RiquetFoucault'>{{cite journal |author=Riquet M, Foucault C, Berna P, Assouad J, Dujon A, Danel C |title=Prognostic value of histology in resected lung cancer with emphasis on the relevance of the adenocarcinoma subtyping |journal=Ann.

Most commonly, however, these lesions show a mixture of two or more subtypes or variants, and are subclassified as "adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes".<ref name='who2004' /><ref name='RiquetFoucault'/>

In China, which has the largest number of smokers and lung cancer cases in the world, the acinar tissue architectural pattern is by far the most common histological subtype of adenocarcinoma, comprising about 40% of all adenocarcinomas,<ref name='Huang'>{{cite journal |author=Huang ZY |title=[Pathologic analysis of 302 primary bronchogenic adenocarcinomas] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=280–3 |year=1988 |month=July |pmid=3248485 }}</ref> and its incidence has increased significantly in recent decades.<ref name='JiaHe'>{{cite journal |author=Jia X, He A, Zhang D, Wang E, Song J |title=[Comparison and analysis of clinicopathology of lung cancer between 1980s and 1990s in the Shenyang area (1,224 cases)] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=332–5 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11769727 }}</ref> In Europe, acinar adenocarcinoma may comprise the dominant architectural pattern in as many as 50–60% of all adenocarcinomas.<ref name='SorensenHirsch'>{{cite journal |author=Sørensen JB, Hirsch FR, Olsen J |title=The prognostic implication of histopathologic subtyping of pulmonary adenocarcinoma according to the classification of the World Health Organization.

Acinar adenocarcinoma of the lung is a highly lethal disease. Overall five-year survival rates approximate 16% to 22%. Generally, survival is better in all stages for patients with the acinar (or papillary) pattern than it is in patients with the solid pattern, but considerably worse than those with the bronchioloalveolar pattern.<ref name='SorensenHirsch' /><ref name='SorensenOlsen'>{{cite journal |author=Sørensen JB, Olsen JE |title=Prognostic implications of histopathologic subtyping in patients with surgically treated stage I or II adenocarcinoma of the lung |journal=J.
