The '''Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival''' or '''CARES''' was initiated in 2004 as an agreement between the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the Department of Emergency Medicine at [[Emory University]]. It is a simple but powerful database that allows cities to collect a small set of performance measures from [[9-1-1]], [[first responders]], [[fire departments]], and [[Emergency Medical Services]], and link it with outcome data from [[hospitals]].<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1781318 "Boosting the Odds of Surviving Cardiac Arrest,"] ''MedGenMed 2006;8(3):44'', Accessed June 21, 2008.</ref> This data enables cities to perform internal benchmarking and improve their response to [[cardiac arrest]] by strengthening the [[chain of  survival]] in their community.<ref>[http://www.emsresponder.com/print/Emergency--Medical-Services/How-GOOD-Is-That-Data/1$5777 "How Good is that Data?"] ''Emergency Medical Services'', July 2007.

==Objectives==

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], the specific objectives of the project are:<ref>[http://www.cdc-cafunding.org/peps/2006peps/2006n01.pdf "Expanding the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) Program,"] ''National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (NCCDPHP)'', Accessed June 21, 2008.</ref>

* To quantify the incidence and location of cardiac arrest events
* To track the performance of each component of the [[Emergency Medical Services]] system (e.g., [[9-1-1]] dispatching and pre-arrival phone instructions, bystander care, first responder, ALS ambulance and definitive care)
* To determine the outcome achieved (e.g., return of spontaneous circulation, survival to admission, survival to hospital discharge, and function status at the discharge)
* To evaluate how well the EMS system achieves each link in the [[American Heart Association]]'s concept of the [[chain of survival]] model
* To identify and prioritize opportunities to strengthen the chain of survival by monitoring high risk locations, settings, and populations, and prioritizing interventions to improve care 
* To determine whether and why the burden of cardiac arrest and survival outcomes differ by race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic levels
