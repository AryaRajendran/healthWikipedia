'''Malaria culture''' is the method to grow [[malaria]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] outside the body i.e. in an ''[[ex vivo]]'' environment.
''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' is currently the only human malaria parasite that has been successfully cultured continuously  ''ex vivo''. Although attempts for propagation of the parasites outside of humans or animal models reach as far back as 1912,<ref>{{cite journal | author=  [[Charles C.

[[File:Trager & Jensen.jpg|thumb|left |Candlejar]]
Infected human [[red blood cell]]s are incubated in a culture dish or flask at 37°C together with a [[nutrient]] medium and [[Blood plasma|plasma]], [[Blood serum|serum]] or serum substitutes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Basco LK | title = Molecular epidemiology of malaria in Cameroon.

The candlejar is an airtight container in which the cultures and a lit [[candle]] are placed. The burning candle consumes some of the [[oxygen]] and produces [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}), which acts as a [[fire extinguisher]]. Carbon dioxide content in fresh air varies between 0.036% and 0.039%, at an app. 5% {{CO2}} concentration the candle stops burning. The number of parasites increased by a factor 5 approximately every 48 hours (= one cycle). The [[parasitemia]] can be determined via [[blood film]], to keep it within the wanted limits, the culture can be thinned out with healthy red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schuster FL | title = Cultivation of plasmodium spp | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev| volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–364 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12097244 | url = http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/355 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.15.3.355-364.2002 | pmc = 118084 }}</ref>

The original method for the successful ''ex vivo'' propagation of ''P. falciparum'' described culture of the parasite under static conditions (Trager-Jensen method).<ref name=Trager/> James B. Jensen joined Trager’s laboratory as a [[Postdoctoral research|post-doctoral fellow]] in 1976.  He decided to employ a candlejar instead of the {{CO2}} incubator. In the summer of 1976 Milton Friedman, a graduate student in the Trager lab who was working in the MRC laboratories in [[The Gambia]], arranged for a sample of human blood infected with ''P. falciparum'' to be sent to [[New York]]. This was diluted with [[Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium|RPMI 1640]] (which turned out to be the best of the commercial media) in [[Petri dish]]es, placed in a candlejar and incubated. The line grew very well and became FCR-3/Gambia, one of the most widely used strains. Later, other lines would be established using similar methods and the impact of continuous cultivation of ''P. falciparum'' was phenomenal especially for the testing of putative antimalarials and for deciphering its genes. A number of subsequent reports (from as far back as the early 1980s), showed that cell suspension (using a shaking-[[Incubator (microbiology)|incubator]]) significantly increased culture growth. Continuous agitation has also been shown to improve other parameters of culture growth relevant to researchers, such as the prolongation of culture synchrony after synchronization procedures, and a reduction of the rate of multiple infections.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Allen RJW,  Kirk K | title = ''Plasmodium falciparum'' culture: The benefits of shaking | journal = Mol Biochem Parasitol | volume = 169 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–63 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19766147 | doi = 10.1016/j.molbiopara.2009.09.005}}</ref>  Despite this, the practice of culturing the parasite under static conditions remains widespread. The greatest value of the candlejar method is that it can be used in laboratories almost anywhere in the world where there is an incubator, a [[candle]] and a [[desiccator]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sherman IW | title = Magic Bullets to Conquer Malaria.

To achieve synchronization and/or concentration of the parasites in culture several methods have been developed. A discontinuous [[Percoll]] [[Differential centrifugation|gradient]] procedure can be used to isolate 
infected red blood cells because red cells containing plasmodia are less dense than normal ones. Young [[Apicomplexan cellular morphology|trophozoites]] coincided with erythrocytes in a broad band corresponding to [[Density|densities]] from 1.075 to 1.100 g/ml, whereas schizonts were concentrated at a density approximating 1.062 g/ml.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1550-7408.1983.tb02932.x | author = Rivadeneira EM, Wasserman M, Espinal CT | title = Separation and concentration of schizonts of Plasmodium falciparum by Percoll gradients| journal = J Protozool| volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 367–370 | year = 1983| pmid = 6313915 |url= http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119550066/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0}}</ref> There are studies, however, that suggest that some strains of  ''P.falciparum'' are affected in their capacity of invasion after being exposed to this chemical. 
The difference between [[diamagnetic]] low-spin oxyhemoglobin in uninfected red blood cells and [[paramagnetic]] [[hemozoin]] in infected red blood cells can also be used for isolation. Magnetic columns have shown to be less harmful for the parasite and are simple and adjustable to the needs of the researcher.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kim CC, Wilson EB, Derisi JL|title= Improved methods for magnetic purification of malaria parasites and haemozoin|journal= Malar J |volume= 9  |issue= 1 |pages=17 |year=2010 |pmid=20074366 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-9-17 |url =http://www.malariajournal.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-9-17.pdf |pmc=2817699 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhakdi SC, Ottinger A, Somsri S, Sratogno P, Pannadaporn P, Chimma P, Malasit P, Pattanapanyasat K, Neumann HP|title= Optimized high gradient magnetic separation for isolation of Plasmodium-infected red blood cells|journal= Malar J |volume= 9  |issue= 1 |pages=38 |year=2010 |pmid=20122252|doi=10.1186/1475-2875-9-38|url =http://www.malariajournal.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-9-38.pdf |pmc=2831011}}</ref> The column is mounted in a potent magnet holder and the culture flowed through it.
