==Germany and Europe==
In [[pharmaceutical industry]], Germany was considered the ''world's medicine cabinet'' in late [[20th century]] after German firms invented the pharmaceutical industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and recovered from the [[World War II]]. During the [[1970s]], the major pharmaceutical companies were concentrated in France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with 55% of world's medicine production by major nation came from those countries. That gave the European pharmaceutical industry the ''world's medicine chest'' title until 1990s. In 1990, the pharmaceutical companies in Europe outspent the upcoming American companies in research and development by 8 billion Euros to 5 billion Euros. However, in the period of 10 years, American companies had reversed the trend by investing more in research and development of medicines which outspent European companies by 24 billion Euros to 17 billion Euros in 2000. As a result, some major companies started to relocate operation, research and other divisions including headquarters to the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last=John|first=Lechleiter|title=An Internal Failure To Innovate Is America's Greatest Global Threat (Op/Ed)|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlechleiter/2012/07/17/an-internal-failure-to-innovate-is-americas-greatest-global-threat/|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why the Germany and Much  of the European Union is  Losing its Pharmaceutical  Industry|url=http://www.aei.org/files/2003/03/18/20030318_Calfee.pdf|publisher=American Enterprise Institute|accessdate=21 February 2013}}</ref>
