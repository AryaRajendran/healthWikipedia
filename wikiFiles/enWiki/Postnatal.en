'''Postnatal''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''after birth'', from '''post''', meaning ''after'', and '''natalis''', meaning ''of birth'') is the period beginning immediately after the [[childbirth|birth]] of a child and extending for about six weeks. Another term would be '''postpartum period''', as it refers to the mother (whereas postnatal refers to the infant). Less frequently used is '''puerperium'''.

It is the time after birth, a time in which the mother's body, including [[hormone]] levels and [[uterus]] size, returns to a non-pregnant state. [[Lochia]] is post-partum vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and placental tissue.

In scientific literature, the term is commonly abbreviated to '''P''X'''''. So that 'day '''P5'''' should be read as 'the fifth day after birth'. This is not to be confused with medical nomenclature that uses G P to stand for number of pregnancy and outcome of pregnancy.

== Newborns ==
{{Main|Infant}} 
Upon its entry to the air-breathing world, without the nutrition and oxygenation from the umbilical cord, the newborn must begin to adjust to life outside the uterus. Also starts his/her [[adaptation to extrauterine life]], the most significant physiological transition until [[death]].

== Postpartum period in mothers ==
A woman in the Western world delivering in a [[hospital]] may leave the hospital as soon as she is medically stable and chooses to leave, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum, though the average for [[spontaneous vaginal delivery]] (SVD) is 1–2 days, and the average [[caesarean section]] postnatal stay is 3–4 days.
During this time, the mother is monitored for [[bleeding]], [[bowel]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] function, and baby care.   The [[infant]]'s health is also monitored.<ref>"With Women, Midwives Experiences: from Shiftwork to Continuity of Care'', David Vernon, Australian College of Midwives, Canberra, 2007 ISBN 978-0-9751674-5-8, p17f</ref>

===Physical===
{{Further|Sex after pregnancy}}
The mother is [[wikt:assessed|assessed]] for [[tearing|tear]]s, and is [[surgical suture|suture]]d if necessary. Also, she may suffer from [[constipation]] or [[hemorrhoid]]s, both of which would be managed. The bladder is also assessed for [[infection]], [[Urinary retention|retention]], and any problems in the [[muscle]]s.

The major focus of postpartum care is ensuring that the mother is healthy and capable of taking care of her newborn, equipped with all the information she needs about [[breastfeeding]], [[reproductive health]] and  [[contraception]], and the imminent life adjustment.

Some medical conditions may occur in the postpartum period, such as [[Sheehan's syndrome]] and [[peripartum cardiomyopathy]].

In some cases, this adjustment is not made easily, and women may suffer from [[postpartum depression]], [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] or even [[puerperal psychosis]].

Postpartum [[urinary incontinence]] is experienced by 23.4%[http://members.multimania.co.uk/shiryu01/Pdf/Hvidman%202003.pdf] to 38.4%[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12028976], likely higher during pregnancy [http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/1999/11000/Antenatal_Prediction_of_Postpartum_Urinary_and.9.aspx].

During the postpartum period, a woman may urinate out up to nine pounds of water. The extra fluid that her body has taken on is no longer needed, so the mother may note that her fluid output is disproportionate to her fluid input.

=== Psychological ===
Early detection and adequate treatment is required. Approximately 25% - 85% of postpartum women will experience the "blues" for a few days. Between 7% and 17% may experience clinical depression, with a higher risk among those women with a history of clinical depression.  Rarely, in 1 in 1,000 cases, women experience a psychotic episode, again with a higher risk among those women with pre-existing mental illness.  Despite the wide spread myth of hormonal involvement, repeated studies have not linked hormonal changes with postpartum psychological symptoms.  Rather, these are symptoms of a pre-existing mental illness, exacerbated by fatigue, changes in schedule and other common parenting stressors.<ref>{{cite journal

Postpartum psychosis (also known as [[puerperal psychosis]]), is a more severe form of mental illness than postpartum depression, with an incidence of approximately 0.2%.

==Cultures==
===East Asia===
In some [[East Asian]] cultures, such as [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and [[Vietnamese culture|Vietnamese]], there is a traditional custom of postpartum confinement known in English as '''doing the month''' or '''sitting the month''' ([[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] zuò yuèzi 坐月子). Confinement traditionally lasts 30 days.<ref>[http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=/PHN/PHN12_03/S1368980008002152a.pdf&code=3ba0290fddc1bb0d50aadfcbedad50cd Effect of Alcohol consumption on Maternal lactation characteristics during ‘doing-the-month’ ritual]</ref> Likewise, women in Japan frequently practice [[Birth in Japan#Postpartum|''ansei'']], or peace and quiet, for a period of time after giving birth for the purpose of recuperating. This tradition combines prescribed foods with a number of restrictions on activities considered to be harmful. It is widely believed in many East Asian societies that this custom helps heal injuries to the [[perineum]], promote the contraction of the [[uterus]], and promote [[lactation]].

===Greece===
Traditionally, Greek mothers would spend 40 days confined at home with their infant after giving birth. At the end of the 40 days (the ''sarántisma'', or "fortying"), the child was symbolically taken to church for the first time, where the mother asked for a special blessing on the conclusion of her puerperium. There are many modern theories seeking to justify this traditional practice, including [[Neonatal sepsis|weakness of infant immune systems]], unimpeded establishment of [[breastfeeding]], and the need for bonding time between parent and child.

===India===
Most traditional Indians follow the 40-day confinement and recuperation period also known as the 'Jaappa' (in Hindi). A special diet to facilitate milk production and increase hemoglobin levels is followed. Sex is not allowed during this time.
In Hindu culture, the puerperium was traditionally considered a period of relative impurity (''asaucham'') due to the processes of childbirth, and a period of confinement of 10-40 days (known as ''purudu'') was recommended for the mother. During this period, she was exempted from usual household chores and religious rites. The father was purified by a ritual bath before visiting the mother in confinement. In the event of a stillbirth, the period of impurity for both parents was 24 hours.<ref>[http://www.hknet.org.nz/asaucham-info.htm GUIDE TO RITUAL IMPURITY - What to do at the junctions of birth and death]</ref>
