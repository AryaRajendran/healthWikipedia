The '''Amsterdam criteria'''  are a set of diagnostic criteria used by doctors to help identify families which are likely to have '''[[Lynch syndrome]]''', also known as '''hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)'''.<ref name="pmid19793571">{{cite journal |author=Lindor NM |title=Familial colorectal cancer type X: the other half of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome |journal=Surg.

The Amsterdam criteria arose as a result of a meeting of the International Collaborative Group on Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer in Amsterdam, in 1990.<ref name=bellizzi>{{cite journal |author=Bellizzi AM, Frankel WL |year=2009 |title=Colorectal cancer due to deficiency in DNA mismatch repair function: a review |journal=Advances in Anatomic Pathology |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=405–417 |pmid=19851131 |doi=10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181bb6bdc}}</ref>  Following this, some of the genetic mechanisms underlying Lynch syndrome were elucidated during the 1990s and the significance of tumours outside the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], such as those of the [[endometrium]], [[small intestine]] and [[ureter]], became more clear.  These  changes in the knowledge of the syndrome lead to a revision of the Amsterdam criteria and were published in [[Gastroenterology_(journal)|Gastroenterology]] journal in 1999.<ref name=vasen/><ref name=bellizzi/>

==Criteria==
The initial Amsterdam criteria were a series of clinical criteria that were colloquially known as the ‘‘3-2-1’’ rule.  They were formulated to serve as a common starting point for future research into the genetics underlying the disease.  The criteria were as follows: 
# At least '''3''' relatives with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, 1 of whom is a first degree relative of the other 2; [[familial adenomatous polyposis]] should be excluded;
# At least '''2''' successive generations involved;
# At least '''1''' of the cancers diagnosed before age 50.<ref name=bellizzi/>

These criteria were found to be too strict and were expanded to include the associated non-colorectal cancers in 1998.  These were called the Amsterdam II clinical criteria for families with Lynch syndrome.<ref name=vasen/><ref name=pinol>{{cite journal |author=Virgínia Piñol; Antoni Castells; Montserrat Andreu; et al. |year=2005 |title=Accuracy of Revised Bethesda Guidelines, Microsatellite Instability, and Immunohistochemistry for the Identification of Patients With Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=16 |pages=1986–1994 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.16.1986 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/293/16/1986 |pmid=15855432}}</ref>

Each of the following criteria must be fulfilled:
*'''3''' or more relatives with an associated cancer ([[colorectal cancer]], or cancer of the [[endometrium]], small intestine, ureter or renal pelvis);
*'''2''' or more successive generations affected;
*'''1''' or more relatives diagnosed before the age of 50 years;
*1 should be a first-degree relative of the other two;
*[[Familial adenomatous polyposis]] (FAP) should be excluded in cases of colorectal carcinoma;
*Tumors should be verified by pathologic examination.<ref name=vasen/>

==Alternatives==
In 1997, the [[National Cancer Institute]] published a set of recommendations called the '''Bethesda guidelines''' for the identification of individuals who should receive genetic testing for Lynch syndrome related tumors.<ref name=pinol/>  The NCI revisited and revised these criteria in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/djh034 |author=Umar A, Boland CR, Terdiman JP, et al. |year=2004 |title=Revised Bethesda Guidelines for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) and microsatellite instability. |pmc=2933058 |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst. |volume=96 |pages=261–268. |pmid=14970275 |issue=4}}</ref>

The Revised Bethesda Guidelines are as follows:
* Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) diagnosed in a patient who is less than 50 years old;
* Presence of synchronous (at the same time) or metachronous (at another time ''i.e.- a re-occurrence of'') CRC or other Lynch syndrome-associated tumors, regardless of age;
* CRC with high [[microsatellite instability]] [[histology]] diagnosed in a patient less than 60 years old;
* CRC diagnosed in one or more first-degree relatives with a Lynch syndrome-associated tumor, with one of the cancers being diagnosed at less than 50 years of age;
* CRC diagnosed in two or more first-degree or second-degree relatives with Lynch syndrome-associated tumors, regardless of age.<ref name=bellizzi/>

The Revised Bethesda Guidelines have been reported as being more sensitive than the Amsterdam II Criteria in detecting individuals and families at risk of Lynch syndrome.<ref name=pinol/>
