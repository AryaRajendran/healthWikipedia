'''USNS ''Comfort''  (T-AH-20)''' is the third [[United States Navy]] ship to bear the name ''Comfort'', and the second {{sclass|Mercy|hospital ship}} to join the navy fleet. The [[USNS]] prefix identifies the ''Comfort'' as a non-commissioned ship owned by the U.S. Navy and crewed by civilians from the Military Sealift Command (MSC). In accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]], USNS ''Comfort'' and her crew do not carry any offensive weapons. Firing upon the ''Comfort'' would be considered a [[war crime]] as the ship only carries weapons for self-defense.<ref>Diplomatic Conference of Geneva of 1949 {{cite web|url= http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/370-580040?OpenDocument|title=Chapter III: Hospital ships, Article 35 - Conditions not Depriving Hospital Ships of Protection|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref>

Like her sister ship [[USNS Mercy (T-AH-19)|USNS ''Mercy'']], ''Comfort'' was built as a San Clemente Class [[oil tanker]] in 1976 by the [[National Steel and Shipbuilding Company]].  Her original name was '''SS ''Rose City''''' and she was launched from [[San Diego, California]].

Her career as an oil tanker ended when she was delivered to the Navy on December 1, 1987. Now, as a [[hospital ship]], ''Comfort''&#39;s new duties include providing emergency, on-site care for U.S. combatant forces deployed in war or other operations. Operated by the [[Military Sealift Command]], ''Comfort'' provides rapid, flexible, and mobile  medical and surgical services to support Marine Corps Air/Ground Task Forces deployed ashore, Army and Air Force units deployed ashore, and naval amphibious task forces and battle forces afloat. Secondarily, she provides mobile surgical hospital service for use by appropriate [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies in disaster or humanitarian relief or limited humanitarian care incident to these missions or peacetime military operations. ''Comfort'' is more advanced than a [[field hospital]] but less capable than a traditional hospital on land.<ref name="Robert Little / The Baltimore Sun">{{Cite web|url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-md.comfort25jan25,0,2271109,full.story|author=Robert Little / The Baltimore Sun|title=Comfort's ability to help stretched to limit|date=2010-01-25|accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref>

When not actively deployed, ''Comfort'' is kept in a state of reduced operations in [[Inner Harbor|Baltimore harbor]]. She has been used many times over the years and kept ready to ship out of Baltimore with five days notice.  

After a quarter-century in Baltimore, MD, USNS Comfort is changing her homeport to Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, VA in March 2013.  The move will place the ship nearer supplies, much of which come from Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, and to medical crew.  Savings to the Navy are estimated at $2 million per year.<ref>http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/usnscomfort/Pages/default.aspx</ref><ref> http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2012/02/16/usns-comforts-move-from-baltimore-to-norfolk-to-save-navy-time-money</ref>

==Deployments==

=== Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm ===
{{Main|Gulf War}}
During [[Operation Desert Storm]], ''Comfort'' received a call to activate for Desert Shield/Desert Storm Aug. 9, 1990 and departed Baltimore Aug. 11. ''Comfort'' was positioned in proximity to [[Kuwait]], just off the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]] near [[Khafji]]. On March 12, 1991, ''Comfort'' was under way on her return trip home. She arrived in Baltimore on April 15, 1991. While deployed, ''Comfort'' traveled more than {{convert|30000|nmi|mi km|lk=in}} and consumed almost {{convert|3|e6U.S.gal|impgal L}} of fuel. More than 8,000 outpatients were seen, and 700 inpatients were admitted including four sailors injured in a high-pressure steam leak on {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}}. 337 surgical procedures were performed. Other notable benchmarks include: more than 2,100 safe helicopter evolutions; 7,000 prescriptions filled; 17,000 laboratory tests completed; 1,600 eyeglasses made; 800,000 meals served and 1,340 radiographic studies, including 141 [[CT scan]]s.

===Operation Sea Signal===
{{Main|Operation Sea Signal}}
''Comfort'' was ordered to activation to serve as migrant processing center for [[Haiti]]an migrants. During this mission, ''Comfort'' served as the first afloat migrant processing center. She set out for the Caribbean with a crew of 928 military and civilian personnel from various federal government and international agencies. On June 16, 1994 the first Haitian migrants were taken aboard. Over the months deployed, the population onboard swelled to 1,100. Shortly after, ''Comfort'' was ordered to discontinue processing and sailed for [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], Cuba to drop off its remaining 400 migrants.

===Operation Uphold Democracy===
{{Main|Operation Uphold Democracy}}
On September 2, 1994, ''Comfort'' was again directed to activate for an unprecedented second deployment. ''Comfort'' was tasked to provide a 250-bed medically intensive patient capability for the 35,000 [[Cubans|Cuban]] and [[Haiti]]an migrants supported by Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Comfort departed Baltimore, with a specially configured crew of 566 personnel. Following the diplomatic agreement reached between the United States and [[Haiti]], ''Comfort'' took up a position off [[Port-au-Prince]] ready to receive casualties that might result from the transfer of U.S. and allied forces ashore. From September 16 through October 2, 1994, ''Comfort'' personnel provided both medical and surgical support to U.S. and allied forces ashore and afloat, emergency humanitarian care to injured Haitian citizens, and participated in various aspects of the Civil Affairs Program in an effort to aid the rebuilding effort of the local healthcare system. She returned to [[Baltimore]] on October 14, 1994.

===Operation Noble Eagle===
{{Main|Operation Noble Eagle}}

[[Image:USNS Comfort Statue of Liberty.jpg|thumb|USNS Comfort passes the [[Statue of Liberty]] en route to Manhattan to provide assistance to victims of the [[September 11th attacks]] on the World Trade Center.]]

''Comfort'' was activated the afternoon of September 11, 2001, in response to the terrorist attack on the [[World Trade Center]] and sailed the next afternoon to serve as a 250-bed hospital facility at Pier 92 in midtown [[Manhattan]]. The ship arrived at Pier 92 in Manhattan at about 8:30 p.m. September 14.  That evening a small number of relief workers arrived aboard the ship. As word about the ship spread, more workers began arriving over the next few days. The ship's clinic saw 561 guests for cuts, respiratory ailments, fractures and other minor injuries, and ''Comfort''&#39;s team of Navy psychology personnel provided 500 mental health consultations to relief workers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=9108 |title=Hospital Ship Receives Humanitarian Medal for September 11 Mission |author=Ellen Maurer, National Naval Medical Center Public Affairs |date=2003-08-22 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref>  ''Comfort'' also hosted a group of volunteer New York area massage therapists who gave 1,359 therapeutic medical massages to ship guests.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
{{Main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}
''Comfort'' was ordered to activate on December 26, 2002, and set sail for the [[U.S. Central Command]] area of operations on January 6, 2003. After stopping in [[Diego Garcia]] to embark additional medical personnel flown in from the National Naval Medical Center, the ship proceeded to the [[Persian Gulf]] to serve as an afloat trauma center in support of [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. ''Comfort'' remained in the [[Persian Gulf]] for 56&nbsp;days providing expert medical care to wounded U.S. military personnel as well as injured [[Iraq]]i civilians and enemy prisoners of war. When ''Comfort'' returned to [[Baltimore]] on June 12, 2003, it marked the completion of a nearly six-month activation. During this time, the ship conducted more than 800 helicopter deck landings to bring aboard personnel, patients and cargo. ''Comfort''&#39;s Medical Treatment Facility had also performed 590 surgical procedures, transfused more than 600 units of blood, developed more than 8,000 radiographic images and treated nearly 700 patients including almost 200 Iraqi civilians and enemy prisoners of war.

===Joint Task Force Katrina===

''Comfort'' deployed on September 2, 2005, after only a two-day preparation, to assist in Gulf Coast recovery efforts after the devastation of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Starting in Pascagoula, Mississippi and then sailing to [[New Orleans]], ''Comfort'' personnel saw 1,956 patients total. USNS ''Comfort'' returned on October 13, 2005 after its 7 week deployment.

===Partnership for the Americas===
USNS ''Comfort's'' Partnership for the Americas humanitarian mission, which began on June 15, 2007, was a major component of the President's "Advancing the Cause of Social Justice in the Western Hemisphere" initiative. ''Comfort'' visited 12 Central American, South American and Caribbean nations where its embarked medical crew provided free health care services to communities in need.  The missions objective was to offer valuable training to U.S. military personnel while promoting U.S. goodwill in the region.  In all, the civilian and military medical team treated more than 98,000 patients, provided 386,000 patient encounters and performed 1,100 surgeries.

The embarked medical crew was made up of more than 500 military and [[non-governmental organization]] (Project Hope and Operation Smile) doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals. Their primary focus was to support medical humanitarian assistance efforts ashore. A secondary mission was outpatient shipboard health service support.

Also supporting ''Comfort's'' medical mission was a [[Seabee (US Navy)|SEABEE]] detachment from the East Coast-based Mobile Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 202, which performed civic action repair and minor construction projects in the host countries. Also on the deployment was the U.S. Navy Showband from Norfolk, Va, which performed in each port.

''Comfort'' was operated and navigated by a crew of 68 civil service mariners (CIVMARS) from the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC).

This mission incorporated various non-government organizations and government agencies, such as Operation Smile, Project Hope, [[LDS Humanitarian Services]], the Atlanta Rotary Club, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army, U.S. Health and Human Services and the Canadian Armed Forces.

Patient encounters included a single patient receiving multiple treatments, students in training sessions and even veterinary care services.

Dentists and staff treated 25,000 patients, extracting 300 teeth, and performing 4,000 fillings, 7,000 sealings, and 20,000 fluoride applications. In addition to treating patients, bio-medical professionals fixed about a thousand pieces of medical equipment at local health facilities. The ship's crew also delivered nearly $200,000&nbsp;dollars worth of donated humanitarian aid.
