The '''lentiform nucleus''' or '''lenticular nucleus''' comprises the [[putamen]] and the [[globus pallidus]] within the [[basal ganglia]]. It is a large, cone-shaped mass of [[gray matter]] just lateral to the [[internal capsule]]. 

==Etymology==
The name comes from [[Latin]] and means [[lens (geometry)|lens]]-shaped, probably referring to the appearance of the nucleus from the side.

==Sections and size==
When divided horizontally, it exhibits, to some extent, the appearance of a biconvex lens, while a [[coronal section]] of its central part presents a somewhat triangular outline. 

It is shorter than the caudate nucleus and does not extend as far forward. 

==Boundaries==
It is lateral to the [[caudate nucleus]] and [[thalamus]], and is seen only in sections of the hemisphere. 

It is bounded laterally by a lamina of white substance called the [[external capsule]], and lateral to this is a thin layer of gray substance termed the [[claustrum]]. 

Its anterior end is continuous with the lower part of the head of the [[caudate nucleus]] and with the [[anterior perforated substance]].

==Components==
In a coronal section through the middle of the lentiform nucleus, two medullary lamin√¶ are seen dividing it into three parts. 

The lateral and largest part is of a reddish color, and is known as the [[putamen]], while the medial and intermediate are of a yellowish tint, and together constitute the [[globus pallidus]]; all three are marked by fine radiating white fibers, which are most distinct in the putamen.
