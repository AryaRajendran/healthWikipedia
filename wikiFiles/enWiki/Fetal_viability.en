==Definitions==
The potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced. Fetal viability depends largely on the fetal organ maturity, and environmental conditions.<ref>(2012). Fetal Viability. [ONLINE] Available at: http://www.reference.md/files/D005/mD005328.html. [Last Accessed 15 November 2012].</ref>

According to Websters Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, viability of a fetus means having reached such a stage of development as to be capable of living, under normal conditions, outside the uterus. Viability exists as a function of biomedical and technological capacities, which are different in different parts of the world. As a consequence, there is, at the present time, no worldwide, uniform gestational age that defines viability.<ref>Breborowicz GH</ref>

==Scientific thresholds==
There is no sharp limit of development, age, or weight at which a fetus automatically becomes viable.<ref name=developinghuman/> According to studies between 2003 and 2005, 20 to 35 percent of babies born at 23 [[weeks of gestation]] survive, while 50 to 70 percent of babies born at 24 to 25 weeks, and more than 90 percent born at 26 to 27 weeks, survive.<ref name="MoD">[http://www.marchofdimes.com/professionals/14332_1196.asp March of Dimes --> Neonatal Death] Retrieved on September 2, 2009.

====United States====
The [[United States Supreme Court]] stated in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) that viability (i.e., the "interim point at which the fetus becomes ... potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid"<ref name="ref_59">[[s:Roe v. Wade/Opinion of the Court#ref 59|Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 160, 93 S.Ct. 705, 730 (1973).]]</ref>) "is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."<ref name="ref_59"/> The 28-week definition became part of the "trimester framework" marking the point at which the "compelling state interest" (under the doctrine of [[strict scrutiny]]) in preserving potential life became possibly controlling, permitting states to freely regulate and even ban abortion after the 28th week.<ref name="ref_59"/> The subsequent ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992) modified the "trimester framework," permitting the states to regulate abortion in ways not posing an "[[undue burden]]" on the right of the mother to an abortion at any point before viability; on account of technological developments between 1973 and 1992, viability itself was legally dissociated from the hard line of 28 weeks, leaving the point at which "undue burdens" were permissible variable depending on the technology of the time and the judgment of the state legislatures.

Forty-one states now have laws restricting post-viability abortions. Some allow doctors to decide for themselves if the fetus is viable. Some require doctors to perform tests to prove a fetus is pre-viable and require multiple doctors to certify the findings. Eleven states have banned the procedure called intact dilation and extraction (IDE)--also known as partial-birth abortion—in the belief that this procedure is used mainly post-viability.<ref>Franklin Foer?</ref>

==Limit of viability==
The '''limit of viability''' is the [[gestational age]] at which a [[premature birth|prematurely born]] [[fetus]]/[[infant]] has a 50% chance of long-term survival outside its mother's womb. With the support of [[neonatal intensive care unit]]s, the limit of viability in the developed world has declined since 50 years ago, but has remained unchanged in the last 12 years.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fergus Walsh |title=Prem baby survival rates revealed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7340288.stm |date=11 April 2008 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Early baby survival 'unchanged' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7390522.stm |date=9 May 2008 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> Currently the limit of viability is considered to be around 24 weeks although the incidence of major disabilities remains high at this point.<ref name="pmid16396856">{{cite journal |author=Kaempf JW, Tomlinson M, Arduza C, ''et al.'' |title=Medical staff guidelines for periviability pregnancy counseling and medical treatment of extremely premature infants |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=22–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16396856 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-2547 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/1/22}} - in particular see [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content-nw/full/117/1/22/T1 TABLE 1 Survival and Neurologic Disability Rates Among Extremely Premature Infants]</ref><ref name="pmid18240080">{{cite journal |author=Morgan MA, Goldenberg RL, Schulkin J |title=Obstetrician-gynecologists' practices regarding preterm birth at the limit of viability |journal=J.

During the past several decades, neonatal care has improved with advances in medical science, and therefore the limit of viability has moved earlier.<ref>''Roe v.

The lower limit of viability is approximately five months [[gestational age]], and usually later.<ref>Halamek, Louis. "[http://neoreviews.aappublications.org/cgi/content/extract/4/6/e153 Prenatal Consultation at the Limits of Viability]", ''NeoReviews'', Vol.4 No.6 (2003): "most neonatologists would agree that survival of infants younger than approximately 22 to 23 weeks’ estimated gestational age [i.e. 20 to 21 weeks' estimated fertilization age] is universally dismal and that resuscitative efforts should not be undertaken when a neonate is born at this point in pregnancy."</ref>

==Factors that influence the chance of survival==
There are several factors that have an impact on the chance of survival of the baby. Two notable factors are age and weight. The baby's [[gestational age]] (number of completed weeks of pregnancy) at the time of birth and the baby's weight (also a measure of growth) influence whether the baby will survive. Other major factors include race and gender. For a given weight, African-American babies have a slightly better chance of survival than Caucasian, while most other races have a rate between the two. Male infants are slightly less mature and have a slightly higher risk of dying than female infants.

Several types of health problems also influence fetal viability. For example, breathing problems, congenital abnormalities or malformations, and the presence of other severe diseases, especially infection, threaten the survival of the neonate. 

Other factors may influence survival by altering the rate of organ maturation or by changing the supply of oxygen to the developing fetus.

The mother's health plays a significant role in the child's viability. Diabetes in the mother, if not well controlled, slows organ maturation; infants of such mothers have a higher mortality. Severe high blood pressure before the 8th month of pregnancy may cause changes in the placenta, decreasing the delivery of nutrients and/or oxygen to the developing fetus and leading to problems before and after delivery.

[[Premature rupture of membranes|Rupture of the fetal membranes]] before 24 weeks of gestation with loss of amniotic fluid markedly decreases the baby's chances of survival, even if the baby is delivered much later. <ref name="spensershope.org"/>
