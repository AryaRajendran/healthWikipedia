The first recorded named holder of a Dublin medical degree was [[John Stearne (physician)|John Stearne]], a Trinity graduate who had trained as a doctor in [[England]] (possibly at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]), and was appointed a [[Fellow]] upon returning to Trinity in 1651.<ref name="400-reason" /> From 1662 until his death in 1669 he was Professor of Physic, and during this time was instrumental in the foundation of a college of physicians, which later became the [[Royal College of Physicians of Ireland]]; this institution had originally functioned as a daughter institution of Trinity College, located at the former [[Trinity Hall, Dublin|Trinity Hall]] on Hoggen Green (now [[College Green]]).<ref name="400-reason" /> Trinity Hall had been intended as a place of residence and tuition for students of the College, but a dispute arose, as the property fell into disuse and disrepair following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|rebellion of 1641]], and [[Dublin Corporation]] demanded its return, as the conditions by which the Corporation had provided it to the College were not being upheld.<ref name="heron">{{Cite book

A "Colledge of Physitians in Dublin" was thus granted a [[royal charter]] in 1667, but no records survive from the time of Stearne's death in 1669 to confirm whether medical students from Trinity were in residence,<ref name="collegephysicians" /> and in subsequent years the College of Physicians gained virtual independence from the university, largely due to the mother institution being unable to supply sufficient qualified physicians to administer it.<ref name="400-reason" /> The College was given the right of granting medical licences within a radius of seven miles of the city of Dublin. In 1692 it was rechartered as the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, and provision was made for representatives of the College to examine candidates for medical degrees of the University of Dublin—this arrangement persisting until 1760—and for holders of Dublin medical degrees to be admitted without further examination or fees to the College.<ref name="collegephysicians" />

By the 18th century, the Board of the College was moved to urgently rectify and formalise the state of its pre-clinical medical education.<ref name="bmj-bicentenary" /> In 1710 it approved both the construction of a two-storey "Elaboratory" to the west of College Park in Trinity (at the site of the current [[Berkeley Library, Dublin|Berkeley Library]]), and the establishment of lectureships in anatomy, chemistry and botany.<ref name="400-reason" /> The building was designed by [[Thomas de Burgh|Thomas Burgh]] and was formally opened on 11 August<!-- Confusing, conflicting sources; the BMJ "Dublin University Medical College" article states this date as 16 August 1911 (sic) --> of the following year with lecture facilities, a dissecting room, a museum and a chemical laboratory.<ref name="400-reason" /> For clinical training, students would then rely on tutorials from the Professor of Physic, and on lectures from same at the Royal College of Physicians.<ref name="400-reason" /> It was agreed with the College of Physicians that, in addition to the normal examinations for all students at the University, medical students would also be examined in "all parts of Anatomy relating to the ''[[animal economy|Œconomia Animalis]]'', and in all parts of Botany, Chemistry, and Pharmacy, and that every candidate Doctor in Physic be examined as to the aforesaid subjects, and likewise in the explanation of [[Hippocrates]]' [[Aphorisms]], and in the theory and cure of external and internal diseases."<ref name="dixon-medicalschool" />

A bequest drawn up in 1711 by the eminent physician [[Sir Patrick Dun]] provided for the endowment of further professorships of physic at Trinity, to be appointed jointly by Trinity, the College of Physicians and the [[Archbishop of Dublin]].<ref name="bmj-1877" /> To allow this to be carried out, a [[royal charter]] was sought to establish the School of Physic under the joint government of both Colleges, and this was granted in 1715.<ref name="bmj-1877" />

The school expanded significantly in the first half of the 20th century, with the establishment of professorships in pathology, bacteriology and biochemistry, and lecturerships in radiology, anaesthetics and psychological medicine, among others.<ref name="bailey">{{Cite book
