The [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors]] are one of three subtypes that belong to the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor subfamily along with [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors]]. The development of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonists have been a major obstacle, because of severe side effects due to a lack of selectivity over 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. Activation of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors can induce hallucinations, and the activation of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors has been implicated in cardiac valvular insufficiency and possibly in pulmonary hypertension.<ref name="Wang 2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/Dddt.S11945 |title=The use of lorcaserin in the management of obesity: A critical appraisal |year=2010 |last1=Wang |first1=Yu |last2=Bai |journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy |pages=1–7 |pmid=21267355 |pmc=3023275 |volume=5}}</ref><ref name="Thomsen 2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1124/jpet.107.133348 |title=Lorcaserin, a Novel Selective Human 5-Hydroxytryptamine2C Agonist: In Vitro and in Vivo Pharmacological Characterization |year=2008 |last1=Thomsen |first1=W.

== History ==
In the late 1960s, non-selective serotonin receptor [[Receptor antagonists|antagonists]] demonstrated a relationship between serotonin receptors and food intake. Later on animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of satiety.<ref name="Bickerdike 1999">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1463-1326.1999.00037.x |title=5-HT2C receptor modulation and the treatment of obesity |year=1999 |last1=Bickerdike |first1=Mike J. |last2=Vickers |first2=Steven P. |last3=Dourish |first3=Colin T. |journal=Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism |volume=1 |issue=4 |pmid=11228755 |pages=207–14}}</ref> Serotonin has been implicated as a critical factor in the short term regulation of food intake and by promoting weight loss associated with [[hyperphagia]].<ref name="Liu 2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.01.107 |title=Orally active and brain permeable proline amides as highly selective 5HT2c agonists for the treatment of obesity |year=2010 |last1=Liu |first1=Kevin K.-C. |last2=Lefker |first2=Bruce A. |last3=Dombroski |first3=Mark A. |last4=Chiang |first4=Phoebe |last5=Cornelius |first5=Peter |last6=Patterson |first6=Terrell A. |last7=Zeng |first7=Yuan |last8=Santucci |first8=Stephanie |last9=Tomlinson |first9=Elizabeth |journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters |volume=20 |issue=7 |pmid=20202843 |pages=2365–9}}</ref> 
The 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor subtype was shown to be one of the principal mediators through which serotonin exert its anorectic effects in rodents by using pharmacological and genetic tools.

The development of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor [[knock-out mice]] in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs for weight loss. These knock-out mice were hyperphagic which led to obesity, partial leptin resistance, increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance.

[[File:Fenfluramine.png|thumb|right|250px|'''Figure 1.''' Fenfluramine.]]
[[Fenfluramine]] (Figure 1), market names Pondimin, Ponderax and Adifax, a 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonist was discovered in 1972 as it came out of the search for an anorectic compound lacking the effects of psycho-stimulants and sympathomimetic agents, such as amphetamines. At the time amphetamines were almost the only form of anorectic drugs available, however the side effects made them difficult to use. Fenfluramine increases serotonin levels and imparts a sensation of fullness, leading to a lower intake of food. Fenfluramine was sold as a racemic mix of two enantiomers, [[dexfenfluramine]] and [[levofenfluramine]].<ref name="Devereux 1998">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199809103391109 |title=Appetite Suppressants and Valvular Heart Disease |year=1998 |last1=Devereux |first1=Richard B. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=339 |issue=11 |pages=765–6 |pmid=9731094}}</ref><ref name="Thomas 1995">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/hrt.74.6.660 |title=Appetite suppressants and primary pulmonary hypertension in the United Kingdom |year=1995 |last1=Thomas |first1=S.

In 1994, sales of the combination drug Fen-phen (fenfluramine and [[phentermine]]) increased dramatically, this combination produced substantial and apparent synergistic effect in promoting weight loss. After a while, reports regarding severe side effects associated with heart valve abnormalities and an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension came to light so products containing fenfluramine were removed from the U.S market, followed by other markets around the world.<ref name="Smith 2006">{{cite journal |doi=10.1517/13543784.15.3.257 |title=The potential use of selective 5-HT2Cagonists in treating obesity |year=2006 |last1=Smith |first1=Brian M |last2=Thomsen |first2=William J |last3=Grottick |first3=Andrew J |journal=Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=257–66 |pmid=16503763}}</ref><ref name="Staten 2007">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11892-010-0096-4 |title=Combination Drugs for Treating Obesity |year=2010 |last1=Greenway |first1=Frank L. |last2=Bray |first2=George A. |journal=Current Diabetes Reports |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=108–15 |pmid=20425569}}</ref>

Dexfenfluramine inhibits serotonin re-uptake and stimulates the release of serotonin. In 1996, dexfenfluramine became the first drug approved in the U.S as a long-term anti-obesity drug. During clinical trials, observation of dexfenfluramine usage led to the conclusion that it could cause side effects such as dry mouth, diarrhea and drowsiness. In the mid-1990s [[FDA]] then approved dexfenfluramine as a weight loss drug, however after several complaints about the drug cardiovascular effect marketing authorization was withdrawn in the U.S in 1997.<ref name="Devereux 1998" /><ref name="Toornvliet 1996">{{cite journal |pmid=8910095 |year=1996 |last1=Toornvliet |first1=AC |last2=Pijl |first2=H |last3=Hopman |first3=E |last4=Elte-De Wever |first4=BM |last5=Meinders |first5=AE |title=Serotoninergic drug-induced weight loss in carbohydrate craving obese patients |volume=20 |issue=10 |pages=917–20 |journal=International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders}}</ref><ref name="Weissman 2001">{{cite journal |pmid=11182836 |year=2001 |last1=Weissman |first1=NJ |last2=Panza |first2=JA |last3=Tighe |first3=JF |last4=Gwynne |first4=JT |title=Natural history of valvular regurgitation 1 year after discontinuation of dexfenfluramine therapy.

The serotonin receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine ([[mCPP]])(Figure 8) has a signiﬁcant affinity for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. mCPP is not ideal because of multiple side effects due to non-selectivity over 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. The hypophagic effect of mCPP is absent in 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor knock-out mice, suggesting that it is mediated via 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor activation. Repeated administration of mCPP to humans might result in decreased food intake and weight loss.

== Mechanism of action ==

[[File:5-HT2C receptor pathway.png|thumb|right|500px|'''Figure 2. Mechanism of action.''' A hypothetical model for the agonist activation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor. Activation leads to accumulation of inositol phosphates and increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Receptor activation also stimulates the ERK pathway and RhoA/PLD pathway.]]

The 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors are coupled to [[phospholipase C]] (PLC) via [[Gαq]] and [[phospholipase A2]] (PLA2), possibly via Gα13. PLC metabolizes [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) which regulates cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux by binding to IP3 receptors and induces the release of Ca2+. In addition, the activation of PLA2 also recruits a RhoA/PLD pathway through [[RhoA]], an enzyme that regulates a wide spectrum of cellular functions through PLD ([[phospholipase D]]) target protein, such as transformation and cytoskeletal reorganization. The 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors are also capable of stimulating the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK) pathway which is activated by [[neurotrophins]] and other neuroactive chemicals. The production of these chemicals effects neuronal differentiation, survival, [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], and structural and functional [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]]. Early studies of the ERK pathway showed that mood stabilizers for the treatment of [[manic-depressive illness]] stimulated the pathway. This led to the understanding that stimulation of the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors could also initiate less manic-depressive conditions like mood stabilizers do.<ref name="Tsui 2009">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.advenzreg.2009.12.002 |title=Roles of inositol phosphates and inositol pyrophosphates in development, cell signaling and nuclear processes |year=2010 |last1=Tsui |first1=Marco M. |last2=York |first2=John D. |journal=Advances in Enzyme Regulation |volume=50 |pages=324–37 |pmid=20006638 |issue=1 |pmc=3269838}}</ref><ref name="Labasque 2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1124/mol.110.066035 |title=Constitutive Activity of Serotonin2C Receptors at G Protein-Independent Signaling: Modulation by RNA Editing and Antidepressants |year=2010 |last1=Labasque |first1=M. |last2=Meffre |first2=J. |last3=Carrat |first3=G. |last4=Becamel |first4=C. |last5=Bockaert |first5=J. |last6=Marin |first6=P. |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=818–26 |pmid=20699324}}</ref><ref name="Van Oekelen 2003">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(03)00141-3 |title=5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and their atypical regulation properties |year=2003 |last1=Van Oekelen |first1=Dirk |last2=Luyten |first2=Walter H.M.L |last3=Leysen |first3=Josée E |journal=Life Sciences |volume=72 |issue=22 |pages=2429–49 |pmid=12650852}}</ref><ref name="Su 2005">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.05.027 |title=RhoA-mediated Phospholipase D1 signaling is not required for the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions |year=2006 |last1=Su |first1=Wenjuan |last2=Chardin |first2=Pierre |last3=Yamazaki |first3=Masakazu |last4=Kanaho |first4=Yasunori |last5=Du |first5=Guangwei |journal=Cellular Signalling |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=469–78 |pmid=15993039}}</ref>

The 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors are restricted to the CNS where they can be found in several locations, with the highest density in the [[choroid plexus]]. It can be found in other areas in the brain as well and typically those who are associated with regulation of food intake, including the nucleus of the [[solitary tract]], [[dorsomedial hypothalamus]], [[paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus]] and the [[amygdala]]. With the knowledge of their location, it might be possible to explain the effect they have in integral function in the control of many physiological and behavioral responses, such as feeding, anxiety, temperature regulation, [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]], sexual behavior and the occurrence of seizures.<ref name="Higgins 2003">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2003.08.102 |title=Serotonin and drug reward: Focus on 5-HT2C receptors |year=2003 |last1=Higgins |first1=Guy A |last2=Fletcher |first2=Paul J |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=480 |pages=151–62 |pmid=14623358 |issue=1–3}}</ref><ref name="Kennett 2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2010.07.020 |title=New approaches to the pharmacological treatment of obesity: Can they break through the efficacy barrier? |year=2010 |last1=Kennett |first1=G.A. |last2=Clifton |first2=P.G. |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=97 |pmid=20688100 |pages=63–83 |issue=1}}</ref>

=== Binding ===

==== The 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and ligand binding ====

[[File:Two-state model.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 3.''' A schematic representation of the two state-model in which the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor are in equilibrium between an active state (R*) and an inactive state (R).]]

5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors are seven-transmembrane (7TM) ligand-independent [[G protein-coupled receptors]] that have the capacity to regulate cellular signaling in the absence of a [[ligand]]. This can be explained by a two-state model (Figure 3) where the receptor is in equilibrium between two states, an active state (R*) and an inactive state (R). Basal effector activity is defined, in part, by the absolute level of (R*), which will increase along with increasing receptor density. Ligands that preferentially bind to and stabilize the R state are termed [[inverse agonists]] and reduce the effector activity. Agonists preferentially bind to and stabilize the R* state, thereby increasing effector activity. Neutral antagonists show equal affinity for both conformations and do not alter the equilibrium between the two states, however they occupy the receptor and can block the effect of both agonists and inverse agonists.<ref name="Berg 2005">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2005.10.008 |title=Physiological relevance of constitutive activity of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors |year=2005 |last1=Berg |first1=Kelly A. |last2=Harvey |first2=John A. |last3=Spampinato |first3=Umberto |last4=Clarke |first4=William P. |journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=625–30 |pmid=16269190}}</ref><ref name="Berg 1999">{{cite journal |pmid=10220565 |year=1999 |last1=Berg |first1=KA |last2=Stout |first2=BD |last3=Cropper |first3=JD |last4=Maayani |first4=S |last5=Clarke |first5=WP |title=Novel actions of inverse agonists on 5-HT2C receptor systems |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=863–72 |journal=Molecular Pharmacology}}</ref> 
 
5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors have a similar amino acid sequence homology, with ~50% overall sequence identity and ~80% within the TM domains. These two receptors share a high pharmacological profile given this similarity in sequence homology. Moreover, both these receptors couple the same cellular signal transduction pathways, PLC and PLA2, that lead to an accumulation of inositol phosphates and Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the [[postsynaptic cell]].<ref name="Berg 2005" />  

The 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors are the only 7TM receptors known to undergo a post-transcriptional process of RNA editing.  The 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor gene is found on the [[X-chromosome]], Xq24. This gene product undergoes RNA editing process leading to a decrease in agonist binding affinity, however antagonist binding remains unaltered. This process of RNA editing generates 14 unique receptor isoforms of the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor that differ in three amino acids in the second intracellular loop.<ref name="Berg 2005" /><ref name="Reynolds 2005">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2005.03.019 |title=The role of 5-HT2C receptor polymorphisms in the pharmacogenetics of antipsychotic drug treatment |year=2005 |last1=Reynolds |first1=Gavin P. |last2=Templeman |first2=Lucy A. |last3=Zhang |first3=Zhi Jun |journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=1021–8 |pmid=15953671}}</ref>

==== Serotonin binding to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>====

Serotonin is an [[endogenous]] non-selective agonist for the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor with a [[binding constant]] of K<sub>i</sub> = 16.0 nM. When serotonin binds to the receptors, the most important contacts are in TM helixes 3, 5 and 6 (Figure 4), while the other four TM helixes do not interact directly with the serotonin compound. When binding of serotonin takes place, the protonated primary amine site forms a [[salt bridge]] with D134 residue in TM 3, as well as forming a [[hydrogen bond]] with residue S138 in TM 3. The aromatic [[indole]] ring forms a strong [[Van der Waals interaction]] with residues F223 in TM 5 and F328 in TM 6. The ring falls tight into the receptor pocket, stacked between two [[phenylalanine]]s. Amine of the indole group forms a hydrogen bond with S219 residue in TM 5 and hydroxide substituent of the indole forms hydrogen bonds both with residue S131 in TM 3 and I332 in TM 6. There is also a strong Van der Waals interaction between the indole and I332 in TM 6.<ref name="Bray 2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jmgm.2008.02.006 |title=The structure of human serotonin 2c G-protein-coupled receptor bound to agonists and antagonists |year=2008 |last1=Bray |first1=Jenelle K. |last2=Goddard |first2=William A. |journal=Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling |volume=27 |pages=66–81 |pmid=18499489 |issue=1}}</ref>

In the drug discovery process of a 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonist a [[pharmacophore]] module has been used to discover novel 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor ligands. The pharmacophore has four features; one aromatic ring, two hydrophobic features and one positive ionizable feature. Figure 5 shows an example of a compound that fits the agonist pharmacophore perfectly. The nitrogen atom of [[piperazine]] fits the positive ionizable feature, the [[benzofuran]] part fits the aromatic ring and one hydrophobic, and the trifluoromethane part fits another hydrophobic feature of the pharmacophore.<ref name="Ahmed 2009">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2009.05.003 |title=Identification of novel serotonin 2C receptor ligands by sequential virtual screening |year=2009 |last1=Ahmed |first1=Asif |last2=Choo |first2=Hyunah |last3=Cho |first3=Yong Seo |last4=Park |first4=Woo-Kyu |last5=Pae |first5=Ae Nim |journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry |volume=17 |issue=13 |pmid=19464901 |pages=4559–68}}</ref>

=== Structure-activity relationships ===

A [[structure-activity relationship]] was determined from the best hits made from the pharmacophore model, described above. These hits contained a pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine core shown in figure 6, which is important for potency toward the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, and to obtain maximum potency two substituents are linked to the core structure. The first substituent is a piperazine ring, containing a small hydrophobic group and the second substituent is a phenyl part containing a halogen and/or oxygen containing side chain (electronegative groups), see derivatives 1 and 2 in figure 6. Addition of aromatic groups to the piperazine ring reduces potency (derivative 3 in figure 6) and the absence of piperazine ring or substitution with other [[aliphatic]]- or cyclic groups reduces potency as well (derivatives 4 and 5 in figure 6).<ref name="Ahmed 2009" />

Series of 3-benzazepine derivatives, such as [[Lorcaserin]] (Figure 7) have been evaluated for their potency and selectivity for the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. It has high affinity for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors (Ki = 15), and is a very potent agonist but it is important for the potency to have a chloro substituent in position 8 of the compound. Moving the chlorine atom around the ring reduces the potency significantly.<ref name="Thomsen 2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1124/jpet.107.133348 |title=Lorcaserin, a Novel Selective Human 5-Hydroxytryptamine2C Agonist: In Vitro and in Vivo Pharmacological Characterization |year=2008 |last1=Thomsen |first1=W.

Compounds such as mCPP (Figure 8) containing arylpiperazine core show good potency toward the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, though the main problem is that they do not have sufficient selectivity for the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors over the other two receptor subtypes. Many derivatives have been examined to increase the selectivity. Derivatives lacking the arylpiperazine core, such as 4-aryl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridinum chlorine analogues, are more favorable for potency and selectivity over the other two receptors (Figure 8).<ref name="Conway 2012">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.01.122 |title=Synthesis and SAR study of 4-arylpiperidines and 4-aryl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines as 5-HT2C agonists |year=2012 |last1=Conway |first1=Richard J. |last2=Valant |first2=Celine |last3=Christopoulos |first3=Arthur |last4=Robertson |first4=Alan D. |last5=Capuano |first5=Ben |last6=Crosby |first6=Ian T. |journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters |volume=22 |issue=7 |pmid=22381048 |pages=2560–4}}</ref> {{multiple image

=== Obesity ===
Obesity is a global epidemic health problem and has received considerable attention as a major public hazard. Obesity is a chronic pathological and costly disease of abnormal or excessive fat accumulation in the body.<ref name="Bray 2000">{{cite journal |first1=George A. |last1=Bray |first2=Louis A. |last2=Tartaglia |title=Medicinal strategies in the treatment of obesity |doi=10.1038/35007544 |pmid=10766254 |year=2000 |volume=404 |issue=6778 |pages=672–7 |journal=Nature}}</ref>  

Wealth of data indicates that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor activation will regulate appetite and food consumption, probably by promoting satiety. Given this appetite suppression by activation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, selective agents with high affinity for this receptor over 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and 5-HT2<sub>2A</sub> are being developed for the treatment of obesity.<ref name="Wang 2010" /><ref name="Kimura 2004">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/J.Ejphar.2004.01.007 |title=Corrigendum to 'Pharmacological profile of YM348, a novel, potent and orally active 5-HT2c receptor agonist' &#91;Eur.

As of this day, Lorcaserin is the only agent that has completed phase III in [[clinical trials]], and has been approved by the FDA. Previous agents have all been removed from the U.S market.<ref name="Wang 2010" />

==== Lorcaserin ====
Lorcaserin (Figure 7) is a full agonist for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors and [[partial agonist]] for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (75% of the maximal response elicited by serotonin).<ref name="Thomsen 2008" /> Lorcaserin is a potent and selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonist with rapid oral absorption that shows dose-dependent decrease in food intake and body weight. Lorcaserin affects body weight by producing a negative [[Energy balance (biology)|energy balance]] through reduced food intake (energy intake) without alterations in energy expenditure and substrate [[oxidation]].<ref name="Martin 2010" /> Lorcaserin has a high affinity for the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, with 18-fold selectivity over 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors and 104-fold over 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors.<ref name="Thomsen 2008" /> The predicted blood concentration to stimulate 2A and 2B receptors is approximately 1400-fold for 2B and 250-fold for 2A, above the blood concentration that is required to stimulate the 2C receptors. This functional selectivity is critical to prevent potential side effects and suggests that the theoretical risk of cardiac valvulopathy is very low. Clinical trials have supported this theory since they have not revealed any side effects on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure like the former obesity drugs. Lorcaserin is well tolerated in general, but the most frequent adverse effect are headache, nausea and dizziness.<ref name="Thomsen 2008" /><ref name="Martin 2010" />

=== Psychiatric disorders ===
Serotonin plays an important role in numerous physiological conditions. 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists have long been known, but recently 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists are becoming promising agents in the development for new [[antipsychotic drugs]]. Most pharmacological researches on antipsychotic drugs have concentrated on the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor subtype, however recent studies show that agonist activity on 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors can cause hallucination. Comparison of [[SSRIs]] and the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists showed that the agonists decreased immobility time and increased swimming time in the FST ([[forced swim test]]) in rats in a manner comparable to SSRIs. In the 1990s 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors have received more attention as many studies have shown that selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists may be more suited in the treatment for psychotic indications.<ref name="Cryan 2000">{{cite journal |pmid=11082448 |year=2000 |last1=Cryan |first1=JF |last2=Lucki |first2=I |title=Antidepressant-like behavioral effects mediated by 5-Hydroxytryptamine(2C) receptors |volume=295 |issue=3 |pages=1120–6 |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics}}</ref><ref name="Rosenzweig 2007">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/S00213-007-0710-6 |title=Antidepressant-like effects of the novel, selective, 5-HT2C receptor agonist WAY-163909 in rodents |year=2007 |last1=Rosenzweig-Lipson |first1=Sharon |last2=Sabb |first2=Annmarie |last3=Stack |first3=Gary |last4=Mitchell |first4=Paul |last5=Lucki |first5=Irwin |last6=Malberg |first6=Jessica E. |last7=Grauer |first7=Steve |last8=Brennan |first8=Julie |last9=Cryan |first9=John F. |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=192 |issue=2 |pages=159–70 |pmid=17297636}}</ref>

A 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonist may be expected to reduce positive symptoms of schizophrenia by reducing dopamine release in the [[mesolimbic dopamine pathway]]. Vabicaserin (SCA-136) is a 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonist that has shown promise in preliminary testing for the treatment of schizophrenia.<ref name="Jensen 2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1100/tsw.2010.180 |title=Therapeutic Potential of 5-HT2C Receptor Ligands |year=2010 |last1=Jensen |first1=Nanna H. |last2=Cremers |first2=Thomas I. |last3=Sotty |first3=Florence |journal=TheScientificWorldJOURNAL |volume=10 |pages=1870–85 |pmid=20852829}}</ref>

==== Vabicaserin ====
[[File:Vabicaserin.png|thumb|right|200px|'''Figure 9.''' Vabicaserin (SCA-136).]]
[[Vabicaserin]] (Figure 9) has a high affinity for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and has low affinity for 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Vabicaserin is a full agonist with approximately 4-fold more selective for 5-HT2C, over these related receptors in terms of binding affinity. Vabicacserin is a full agonist in stimulating the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor, it was discovered when a class of tetrahydroquinoline-fused [[diazepine]]s were being researched for possible potent 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists.<ref name="Dunlop 2011">{{cite journal |doi=10.1124/Jpet.111.179572 |title=Characterization of Vabicaserin (SCA-136), a Selective 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2C Receptor Agonist |year=2011 |last1=Dunlop |first1=J. |last2=Watts |first2=S.

As of 2012 Vabicaserin is in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia. Long-term administration of Vabicaserin significantly decreases the number of spontaneously active mesocorticolimbic dopamine neurons without affecting [[nigrostriatal]] dopamine neurons, consistent with effects of [[atypical antipsychotic]] agents. The outcome of clinical studies for Vabicaserin may reveal whether 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors can be possible targets for the treatment of schizophrenia.<ref name="Tong 2009">{{cite journal |doi=10.1124/dmd.109.028639 |title=Species Differences in the Formation of Vabicaserin Carbamoyl Glucuronide |year=2009 |last1=Tong |first1=Z. |last2=Chandrasekaran |first2=A. |last3=Demaio |first3=W. |last4=Jordan |first4=R. |last5=Li |first5=H. |last6=Moore |first6=R. |last7=Poola |first7=N. |last8=Burghart |first8=P. |last9=Hultin |first9=T. |journal=Drug Metabolism and Disposition |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=581–90 |pmid=20032194}}</ref>

=== Sexual dysfunction ===
Activation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor subtype has been reported to mediate numerous effects, such as penile erection.<ref name="Bagdy 1992">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0014-2999(92)90417-3 |title=Pharmacological characterization of serotonin receptor subtypes involved in vasopressin and plasma renin activity responses to serotonin agonists |year=1992 |last1=Bagdy |first1=Gyorgy |last2=Sved |first2=Alan F. |last3=Murphy |first3=Dennis L. |last4=Szemeredi |first4=Katalin |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=210 |issue=3 |pages=285–9 |pmid=1535317}}</ref><ref name="Kahn 1991">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0006-3223(91)90184-N |title=M-Chlorophenylpiperazine as a probe of serotonin function |year=1991 |last1=Kahn |first1=Rene S. |last2=Wetzler |first2=Scott |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1139–66 |pmid=1663792}}</ref> Based on multiple studies, results show that several 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists, including mCPP and [[YM-348|YM348]] induce penile erections in rats,<ref name="Kimura 2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/J.Ejphar.2008.05.022 |title=5-HT2C receptor activation is a common mechanism on proerectile effects of apomorphine, oxytocin and melanotan-II in rats |year=2008 |last1=Kimura |first1=Yasuharu |last2=Naitou |first2=Yuki |last3=Wanibuchi |first3=Fumikazu |last4=Yamaguchi |first4=Tokio |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=589 |pages=157–62 |pmid=18582863 |issue=1–3}}</ref> 
but mCPP seems to mimic both [[vasodilation]] and [[vasoconstriction]]. The vasodilator action is mediated by 5- HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors, whereas the vasoconstriction effect involves 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor activation.<ref name="Hoyer 1994">{{cite journal |pmid=7938165 |year=1994 |last1=Hoyer |first1=D |last2=Clarke |first2=DE |last3=Fozard |first3=JR |last4=Hartig |first4=PR |last5=Martin |first5=GR |last6=Mylecharane |first6=EJ |last7=Saxena |first7=PR |last8=Humphrey |first8=PP |title=International Union of Pharmacology classification of receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin) |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=157–203 |journal=Pharmacological reviews}}</ref>
YM348 is a highly selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonist and results show that YM348 can induce penile erections and hypolocomotion (induced at a high dose) in rats, as did other 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists. These effects were completely inhibited by a selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor antagonist, SB242084. Therefor results suggest that YM348 is a potent and orally active 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonist.<ref name="Kimura 2006">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(05)00920-1 |title=Characterization of Intracavernous Pressure Increase Induced by Ym348, a Novel 5-HT2C Receptor Agonist, in Anesthetized Rats |year=2006 |last1=Kimura |first1=Yasuharu |last2=Naitou |first2=Yuki |last3=Wanibuchi |first3=Fumikazu |last4=Yamaguchi |first4=Tokio |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=175 |issue=5 |pages=1953–7 |pmid=16600805}}</ref><ref name="Andrews 2011">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/J.Bmcl.2010.11.120 |title=Pyrimido&#91;4,5-''d''&#93;azepines as potent and selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists: Design, synthesis, and evaluation of PF-3246799 as a treatment for urinary incontinence |year=2011 |last1=Andrews |first1=Mark D. |last2=Fish |first2=Paul V. |last3=Blagg |first3=Julian |last4=Brabham |first4=Tiffini K. |last5=Brennan |first5=Paul E. |last6=Bridgeland |first6=Alison |last7=Brown |first7=Alan D. |last8=Bungay |first8=Peter J. |last9=Conlon |first9=Kelly M. |journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters |volume=21 |issue=9 |pmid=21195614 |pages=2715–20}}</ref>

=== Urinary incontinence ===
Serotonin has been found to play a key role in mechanisms involved in [[micturition]] and continence. Many potent compounds with high selectivity for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors have been synthesized and are promising candidates for further development for the treatment of [[stress urinary incontinence]] (SUI).<ref name="Andrews 2011" />

== Current status ==
Many [[exogenous]] agents have been developed since the discovery of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Thus far a small number of agonists, with sufficient selectivity for the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors over the other subtypes have been studied in clinic. A variety of other 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists remain in [[preclinical|pre-clinical]] developments, like RO60-0175, WAY-163909 and the inverse agonist SB243213. Evidence supports a therapeutic potential of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor modulation in the treatment of a variety of pathological conditions, including schizophrenia, obesity, urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction.<ref name="Jensen 2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1100/tsw.2010.180 |title=Therapeutic Potential of 5-HT2C Receptor Ligands |year=2010 |last1=Jensen |first1=Nanna H. |last2=Cremers |first2=Thomas I. |last3=Sotty |first3=Florence |journal=TheScientificWorldJOURNAL |volume=10 |pages=1870–85 |pmid=20852829}}</ref>
