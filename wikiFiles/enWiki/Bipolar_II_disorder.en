'''Bipolar II disorder''' is a [[bipolar spectrum|bipolar spectrum disorder]] characterized by at least one [[hypomanic episode]] and at least one [[major depressive episode]]; with this disorder, depressive episodes can be more frequent and are more intense than hypomanic episodes.<ref name="WebMD Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder">{{cite web|title=WebMD Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="WebMD Bipolar II">{{cite web|title=WebMD Bipolar II|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/bipolar-2-disorder|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>  People with bipolar disorder type II have never experienced a full [[manic episode]], although they can experience periods of high energy and impulsiveness similar to but not as extreme as mania.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Hypomanic episodes===

*High energy levels
*Hedonistic mood
*Unrealistic optimism
*Irritability 
*Automatic thoughts
*Hypersexuality

===Depressive episodes===

*Low energy levels
*Cessation of usual activities
*[[False Dilemma|Black and white thinking]]
*Unrealistic pessimism
*[[Overgeneralization]]
*Automatic thoughts
*Maladaptive assumptions
*Dysfunctional personal schemas<ref name="Manicavasagar">{{cite book|last=Manicavasagar|first=Vijaya|title=Bipolar II Disorder: Modelling, Measuring, and Managing|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-87314-2|authorlink=The Role of Psychological Interventions in Managing Bipolar II Disorder|editor=Gordan Parker}}</ref>
*Thoughts of suicide
*Isolation from people

===Relapse===
In the case of a relapse, the following symptoms often occur and are considered early warning signs:<ref name="Orum">{{cite book|last=Orum|first=Margo|title=Bipolar II Disorder: Modelling, Measuring, and Managing|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-87314-2|authorlink=The Role of Wellbeing Plans in Managing Bipolar II Disorder|editor=Gordan Parker}}</ref>
*Sleep disturbance: patient requires less sleep and does not feel tired
*[[Racing thoughts]] and/or speech
*[[Anxiety]]
*[[Irritability]]
*Emotional intensity
*Spending more money than usual
*Binge behavior, including food, drugs, or alcohol
*Arguments with family members and friends
*Taking on many projects at once

People with bipolar disorder may develop alternate identities to match each mood they experience. For some, this is done intentionally,  as a means by which to escape trauma or pain from a depressive period, or simply to better organize one's life by setting boundaries for one's perceptions and behaviors.<ref name="Smith">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Meg|title=Bipolar II Disorder: Modelling, Measuring, and Managing|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-87314-2|location=Cambridge, England|pages=195–203|authorlink=Survival Strategies for Managing and Prospering with Bipolar II Disorder|editor=Gordan Parker}}</ref>

==Causes==
There have been very few studies conducted to examine the possible causes of Bipolar II. Those that have been done have not considered Bipolar I and Bipolar II separately and have had inconclusive results.  Researchers have found that patients with either Bipolar I or II may have increased levels of blood calcium concentrations but the results are inconclusive. The studies that have been conducted did not find a significant difference between those with Bipolar I or Bipolar II. There has been a study looking at genetics and Bipolar II disorder and the results are inconclusive; however, scientists did find that relatives of people with Bipolar II are more likely to develop the same bipolar disorder or major depression rather than developing Bipolar I disorder.<ref name="Orum"/>

==Diagnosis==
The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV) recognizes two types of bipolar disorders—[[bipolar I]] and bipolar II. People with bipolar I disorder suffer from at least one [[manic episode|manic]] or [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed]] episode, and may experience [[Major depressive episode|depressive]] episodes. On the contrary, as noted above, people with bipolar II disorder experience a milder form of a manic episode, known as a [[hypomanic episode]] as well as major depressive episodes. Although bipolar II is thought to be less severe than bipolar I in regards to symptom intensity, it is actually more severe and distressing with respect to episode frequency and overall course. Those with bipolar II often experience more frequent bouts of depressive episodes.<ref name="Baek">Baek, J. H., Park, D. Y., Choi, J., Kim, J. S., Choi, J. S., Ha, K., ... Hong, K. S. (2011). Differences between bipolar I and bipolar II in clinical features, comorbidity, and family history. Journal of Affective Disorders, 131, 59–67.</ref> Specific criteria defined by the DSM-IV for a bipolar II diagnosis is as follows:

*The presence of a hypomanic or major depressive episode.
*If currently in major depressive episode, history of a hypomanic episode. If currently in a hypomanic episode, history of a major depressive episode. No history of a manic episode.
*Significant stress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.<ref>American Psychiatric Association (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).</ref>

Studies have identified major differences between bipolar I and bipolar II in regards to their clinical features, comorbidity rates and family histories. According to Baek et al. (2011), during depressive episodes, bipolar II patients tend to show higher rates of [[psychomotor agitation]], guilt, shame, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts. Bipolar II patients have shown higher lifetime comorbidity rates of DSM axis I diagnoses such as [[phobias]], [[anxiety disorders]], substance & alcohol abuse, and [[eating disorders]] and there is a higher correlation between bipolar II patients and family history of psychiatric illness, including major depression and substance-related disorders. The occurrence rate of psychiatric illness in first degree relatives of bipolar II patients was 26.5%, versus 15.4% in bipolar I patients.<ref name="Baek" /><ref name="George" />

Although the DSM-IV reports a bipolar II lifetime prevalence rate of 0.5%, recent epidemiological studies indicate a rate closer to 5% with one in two depressed outpatients suffering from this disorder.<ref name="Benazzi" /> There are several reasons for this increase in bipolar II diagnoses. New semi-structured interviews allow trained research clinicians to diagnose a patient on the bipolar spectrum more accurately, DSM-IV criteria have relaxed so that now the minimum duration of hypomania is less than four days, and a history of hypomania is now focused more on over-activity, especially in regards to goal-setting activity, than mood changes.<ref name="Benazzi">Benazzi, F. (2007). Bipolar II disorder : epidemiology, diagnosis and management. CNS Drugs, 21(9), 727–740.</ref> Screening instruments like the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) are helpful tools in determining a patient's status on the bipolar spectrum and getting families involved can also improve chances of an accurate diagnosis and acknowledgment of hypomanic episodes. In addition, there are certain features that have been shown to increase the chances that depressed patients are suffering from a bipolar disorder including atypical symptoms of depression like [[hypersomnia]] and [[hyperphagia]], a family history of bipolar disorder, medication-induced hypomania, recurrent or [[psychotic depression]], antidepressant refractory depression, and early or [[postpartum depression]].<ref name="George" />

==Treatments==
Treatment typically includes three things: the treatment of acute hypomania, the treatment of acute depression, and the prevention of the relapse of either hypomania or depression.  The main goal is to avoid harm to the patient.<ref name="pmid17162626">{{cite journal |author=El-Mallakh R, Weisler RH, Townsend MH, Ginsberg LD |title=Bipolar II disorder: current and future treatment options |journal=Annals of Clinical Psychiatry : Official Journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=259–66 |year=2006 |pmid=17162626 |doi=10.1080/10401230600948480}}</ref>

===Pharmaceutical therapies===
The most common treatment for reducing bipolar II disorder symptoms is [[medication]], usually in the form of [[mood stabilizer]]s.  However, treatment with mood stabilizers may produce a flat affect in the patient, which is dose-dependent. Concurrent use of [[SSRI|SSRI antidepressants]] may help some with bipolar II disorder, though these medications should be used with caution because it is believed that they may cause a hypomanic switch.<ref name="pmid17162626"/>
 
The pharmaceutical management of bipolar II disorder is not generally supported by strong evidence, with limited [[randomised controlled trials]] (RCTs) published in the literature. Some medications used are:<ref name="pmid17162626"/>
* [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] - There is strong evidence that lithium is effective in treating both the depressive and hypomanic symptoms in bipolar II. In addition, its action as a mood stabiliser can be used to decrease the risk of hypomanic switch in patients treated with antidepressants.
* Anticonvulsants - there is evidence that [[lamotrigine]] decreases the risk of relapse in rapid cycling bipolar II. It appears to be more effective in bipolar II than bipolar I, suggesting that lamotrigine is more effective for the treatment of depressive rather than manic episodes. A large, multicentre trial comparing [[carbamazepine]] and lithium over two and a half years found that carbamazepine was superior in terms of preventing future episodes of bipolar II, although lithium was superior in individuals with bipolar I. There is also some evidence for the use of [[valproate]] and [[topiramate]], although the results for the use of [[gabapentin]] have been disappointing.
* Antidepressants - there is evidence to support the use of [[SSRI]] and [[SNRI]] antidepressants in bipolar II. Indeed, some sources consider them to be one of the first line treatments.<ref name=nordic>{{cite journal|last=Skeppar|first=Peter|coauthors=Adolfsson, Rolf|title=Bipolar II and the bipolar spectrum|journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 January 2006|volume=60|issue=1|pages=7–26|doi=10.1080/08039480500504685|pmid=16500795|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08039480500504685}}</ref>  However, because of the perceived risk of antidepressants inducing a hypomanic switch, treatment is often combined with a mood stabiliser such as lithium.
* Antipsychotics - there is good evidence for the use of [[quetiapine]], and it has been approved by the FDA for this indication. There is also some evidence for the use of risperidone, although the relevant trial was not placebo controlled and was complicated by the use of other medications in some of the patients.
* Dopamine agonists - there is evidence for the efficacy of [[pramipexole]] from one RCT.

===Non-pharmaceutical therapies===
Non-pharmaceutical therapies can also help those with the illness. These include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[psychodynamic therapy]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[social rhythm therapy]],  [[interpersonal therapy]], [[behavioral therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], [[music therapy]], [[psychoeducation]], [[light therapy]], and [[family therapy|family-focused therapy]]. Relapse can still occur, even with continued medication and therapy.<ref name="Understanding Bipolar Disorder -- Treatment">{{cite web|title=Understanding Bipolar Disorder -- Treatment|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/understanding-bipolar-disorder-treatment?page=2|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
There is evidence to suggest that Bipolar II Disorder has a more chronic course of illness than [[Bipolar I disorder]].<ref name="Carol">{{Cite thesis |degree= Ph. D |chapter= 1 |title= Neuropsychological emotion processing abnormalities in bipolar disorder I and II |url= http://digitalcommons.library.unlv.edu/thesesdissertations/843/ |author= |last= Randall |first= Carol |year= 2010 |publisher= University of Nevada |accessdate= 19 October 2011}}</ref> This constant and pervasive course of the illness leads to an increased risk in suicide and more [[hypomanic]] and [[major depressive episodes]] with shorter periods of time between episodes than Bipolar I patients experience.<ref name=Carol/> The natural course of Bipolar II Disorder, when left untreated, leads to patients spending the majority of their lives unwell with much of their suffering stemming from [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="George">{{cite book|last=Hadjipavlou|first=George|title=Bipolar II Disorder: Modelling, Measuring, and Managing|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-87314-2|pages=61–74 [65]|authorlink=Bipolar II Disorder in Context: epidemiology, disability, and economic burden|coauthors=Lakshmi N.

===Functioning===
The deficits in functioning associated with Bipolar II disorder stem mostly from the recurrent depression that Bipolar II patients suffer from. Depressive symptoms are much more disabling than hypomanic symptoms and are potentially as - or more - disabling than [[mania]] symptoms.<ref name=psychosocial/> Functional impairment has been shown to be directly linked with increasing percentages of depressive symptoms, and because sub-syndromal symptoms are more common—and frequent—in Bipolar II disorder, they have been implicated heavily as a major cause of psychosocial disability.<ref name=George/> There is evidence that shows the mild depressive symptoms, or even sub-syndromal symptoms, are responsible for the non-recovery of social functioning, which furthers the idea that residual depressive symptoms are detrimental for functional recovery in patients being treated for Bipolar II.<ref name="correlates">{{cite journal|last=Wingo|first=Aliza P.|coauthors=Ross J. Baldessarini, Michael T. Compton, Philip D. Harvey|title=Correlates of recovery of social functioning in types I and II bipolar disorder patients|journal=Psychiatry Research|date=May 15, 2010|volume=177|pages=131–134|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2010.02.020|pmid=20334933|issue=1–2|pmc=2859974}}</ref> It has been suggested that symptom interference in relation to social and interpersonal relationships in Bipolar II Disorder is worse than symptom interference in other chronic medical illnesses such as cancer.<ref name=correlates/> This social impairment can last for years, even after treatment that has resulted in a resolution of mood symptoms.<ref name=correlates/> 

The factors related to this persistent social impairment are residual depressive symptoms, limited illness insight (a very common occurrence in patients with Bipolar II Disorder), and impaired executive functioning.<ref name=correlates/> 
Impaired ability in regards to [[executive functions]] is directly tied to poor psychosocial functioning, a common side-effect in patients with Bipolar II.<ref name="Functional">{{cite journal|last=Rosa|first=A.R.|coauthors=C.M. Bonnin, G.H. Vazquez, M. Reinares, B. Sole, R. Tabares-seisdedos, V. Balanza-Martinez, A. Gonzalez-Pinto, J. Sanchez-Moreno, E. Vieta|title=Functional impairment in bipolar II disorder: Is it as disabling as bipolar I?|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=December 1, 2010|volume=127|pages=71–76|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2010.05.014|pmid=20538343|issue=1–3}}</ref> 

The impact on a patient’s psychosocial functioning stems from the depressive symptoms (more common in Bipolar II than Bipolar I).<ref name=psychosocial/> An increase in these symptoms’ severity seems to correlate with a significant increase in psychosocial disability.<ref name=Functional/> Psychosocial disability can present itself in poor [[semantic memory]], which in turn affects other cognitive domains like verbal memory and (as mentioned earlier) executive functioning leading to a direct and persisting impact on psychosocial functioning.<ref name="memory">{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Jae Seung|coauthors=Sungwon Choi, Kyooseob Ha, Tae Hyon Ha, Hyun Sang Cho, Jung Eun Choi, Boseok Cha, Eunsoo Moon|title=Differential pattern of semantic memory organization between bipolar I and II disorders|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry|date=June 1, 2011|volume=35|pages=1053–1058|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2011.02.020|issue=4}}</ref> 

An abnormal semantic memory organization can manipulate thoughts and lead to the formation of delusions and possibly affect speech and communication problems, which can lead to interpersonal issues.<ref name=memory/> Bipolar II patients have also been shown to present worse cognitive functioning than those patients with Bipolar I, though they demonstrate about the same disability when it comes to occupational functioning, interpersonal relationships, and [[autonomy]].<ref name=Functional/> This disruption in cognitive functioning takes a toll on their ability to function in the work place, which leads to high rates of work loss in Bipolar II patient populations.<ref name=psychosocial/> After treatment and while in remission, Bipolar II patients tend to report a good psychosocial functioning but they still score less in that department than normal patients without the disorder.<ref name=George/> These lasting impacts further suggest that a prolonged exposure to an untreated Bipolar II disorder can lead to permanent adverse effects on functioning.<ref name=correlates/>

===Recovery and recurrence===
Bipolar II Disorder has a chronic relapsing nature.<ref name=relapse/> It has even been suggested that Bipolar II patients have a higher degree of relapse than Bipolar I patients .<ref name=Carol/> Generally, within four years of an episode, around 60% of patients will relapse into another episode.<ref name=relapse/> Some patients are even symptomatic half the time, either with full on episodes or symptoms that fall just below the threshold of an episode.<ref name=relapse/> 

Because of the nature of the illness, long-term therapy is the best option and aims to not only control the symptoms but to maintain sustained remission and prevent relapses from occurring.<ref name=relapse/> Even with treatment, patients do not always regain full functioning, especially in the social realm .<ref name=correlates/> There is a very clear gap between symptomatic recovery and full functional recovery, for both Bipolar I and Bipolar II patients.<ref name=Functional/> As such, and because those with Bipolar II spend more time with depressive symptoms that do not quite qualify as a major depressive episode, the best chance for recovery is to have therapeutic interventions that focus on the residual depressive symptoms and to aim for improvement in psychosocial and cognitive functioning.<ref name=Functional/> Even with treatment, a certain amount of responsibility is placed in the patient’s hands; they have to be able to assume responsibility for their illness by accepting their diagnosis, taking the required medication, and seeking help when needed to do well in the future.<ref name="well">{{cite book|last=Orum|first=Margo|title=Bipolar II Disorder: Modelling, Measuring, and Managing|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-87314-2|pages=177–194|authorlink=The Role of Wellbeing Plans in Managing Bipolar II Disorder|editor=Gordan Parker}}</ref> 

Treatment often lasts after remission is achieved, and the treatment that worked is continued during the continuation phase (lasting anywhere from 6–12 months) and maintenance can last 1–2 years or, in some cases, indefinitely.<ref name="commentary">{{cite book|last=Benazzi|first=Franco|title=Bipolar II Disorder: Modelling, Measuring, and Managing|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-87314-2|pages=232–236|authorlink=Management Commentary|editor=Gordan Parker}}</ref> One of the treatments of choice is [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]], which has been shown to be very beneficial in reducing the frequency and severity of depressive episodes.<ref name=George2/> Lithium prevents mood relapse and works especially well in Bipolar II patients who experience rapid-cycling.<ref name=George2/> Almost all Bipolar II patients who take Lithium have a decrease in the amount of time they spend ill and a decrease in mood episodes.<ref name=George2/> 

Along with medication, other forms of therapy have been shown to be beneficial for Bipolar II patients.  A treatment called a "wellbeing plan" serves several purposes: it informs the patients, protects them from future episodes, teaches them to add value to their life, and works toward building a strong sense of self to fend off depression and reduce the desire to succumb to the seductive hypomanic highs.<ref name=well/> The plan has to aim high.  Otherwise, patients will relapse into depression.<ref name=well/> A large part of this plan involves the patient being very aware of warning signs and stress triggers so that they take an active role in their recovery and prevention of relapse.<ref name=well/>

===Mortality===
Several studies have shown that the risk of [[suicide]] is higher in patients who suffer from Bipolar II than those who suffer from Bipolar I, and especially higher than patients who suffer from [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name=George/> 

In results of a summary of several lifetime study experiments, it was found that 24% of Bipolar II patients experienced suicidal ideation or suicide attempts compared to 17% in Bipolar I patients and 12% in major depressive patients.<ref name=George/><ref name="bipolar">{{cite journal|last=MacQueen|first=Glenda M|coauthors=L.

Bipolar II patients have several risk factors that increase their risk of suicide. The illness is very recurrent and results in severe disabilities, interpersonal relationship problems, barriers to academic, financial, and vocational goals, and a loss of social standing in their community, all of which increase the likelihood of suicide.<ref name="intervention">{{cite book|last=Manicavasagar|first=Vijaya|title=Bipolar II Disorder: Modelling, Measuring, and Managing|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-87314-2|pages=151–176|authorlink=The role of psychological interventions in managing Bipolar II Disorder}}</ref> Mixed symptoms and rapid-cycling, both very common in Bipolar II, are also associated with an increased risk of suicide.<ref name=George/>  The tendency for Bipolar II to be misdiagnosed and treated ineffectively, or not at all in some cases, also leads to an increased risk.<ref name=bipolar/> 

As a result of the high suicide risk for this group, reducing the risk and preventing attempts remains a main part of the treatment; a combination of self-monitoring, close supervision by a therapist, and faithful adherence to their medication regimen will help to reduce the risk and prevent the likelihood of a completed suicide.<ref name=intervention/>

== History ==
Historically, the first diagnostic distinction to be made between manic-depression involving mania, and that involving hypomania, came from Carl Gustav Jung in 1903.<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, J. (2012) A Jungian Approach to Bipolar Disorder, Soul Books</ref><ref>Jung, C.G., (1903) ‘On Manic mood disorder’ in Psychiatric Studies Vol-1, Collected works, second edition (1970) translated by R.F.C Hull. Routledge and Kegan Paul.</ref> In his paper, Jung introduced the non-psychotic version of the illness with the introductory statement, "I would like to publish a number of cases whose peculiarity consists in chronic hypomanic behaviour" where "it is not a question of real mania at all but of a hypomanic state which cannot be regarded as psychotic".<ref name="Thompson" /><ref>Jung, C.G., (1903) ‘On Manic mood disorder’ in Psychiatric Studies Vol-1, Collected works, second edition (1970) translated by R.F.C Hull. Routledge and Kegan Paul. pp.109-111</ref> Jung illustrated the hypomanic variation with five case histories, each involving hypomanic behaviour, occasional bouts of depression, and mixed mood states, which involved personal and interpersonal upheaval for each patient.<ref name="Thompson" />
