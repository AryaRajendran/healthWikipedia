'''Neuropoiesis''' is the process by which neural stem cells differentiate to form mature [[neuron]]s, [[astrocyte]]s, and [[oligodendrocyte]]s in the adult mammal. This process is also referred to as adult neurogenesis.

==History==
While rapid neurogenesis was known to occur in the early stages of life, the production and differentiation of neural stem cells was believed to cease upon maturity. This belief was overturned in the 1960s by the work of Joseph Altman.<ref name="Altman1">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/cne.901240303|title=Autoradiographic and Histological Evidence of Postnatal Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Rats|journal=Journal of Comparative Neurobiology|year=1965|first=Altman|last=Joseph|coauthors=Das, GD|volume=124|issue=3|pages=319–35|id= |url=|format=|pmid=5861717}}</ref> Using injections of thymidine-H<sup>3</sup> to label the nuclei of dividing cells, Altman was able to use [[autoradiography]] to determine a neuronal birthdate for each cell in a rat's brain. This research revealed some degree of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb of rats, and paved the way for the possibility of neuropoiesis in the adult mammalian brain. 

Following Altman's work, thymidine-H<sup>3</sup> injections were used to examine the brains of a variety of other species. In the late 1970s Steven Goldman used this technique to examine the vocal control centers of songbirds, and he found widespread evidence of adult neurogenesis in this area of a canary's brain.<ref name="goldmannott">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.80.8.2390|title=Neuronal production, migration, and differentiation in a vocal control nucleus of the adult female canary brain|journal=Procedures of the National Academy of Science|year=1983|first=Steven|last=Goldman|coauthors=F Nottebohm|volume=80|issue=8|pages=2390–2394|id= |url=|format=|pmid=6572982|pmc=393826}}</ref><ref name="goldmanrev">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4695(199808)36:2<267::AID-NEU12>3.0.CO;2-B|title=Adult neurogenesis: From canaries to the clinic|journal=Journal of Neurobiology|year=1999|first=Steven|last=Goldman|coauthors=|pmid=9712309|volume=36|issue=2|pages=267–286|id= |url=|format= }}</ref> Subsequent studies by Goldman and others revealed the precise mechanisms for neuronal cell differentiation and migration in adult songbirds, and, along with studies done in fish and other species, laid the groundwork for the study of neuropoiesis in humans.<ref name="goldmanrev" />

==Neuropoietic areas in the human brain==
The most recognized initial sites of neuropoiesis ending with neurons in adults are the [[subventricular zone]] (SVZ), the thin layer of cells just beneath the surface of the lateral ventricles of the brain, and the [[dentate gyrus]] of the [[hippocampus]]. Neural precursor cells in the human SVZ are known to yield offspring which can then produce [[glial cells]] or even migrate and form new [[neurons]] in specific areas such as the mammalian [[olfactory bulb]].<ref name="goldmanrev" /><ref name="scheffler">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0503965102|title=Phenotypic and functional characterization of adult brain neuropoiesis|journal=PNAS|year=2005|first=Bjorn|last=Scheffler|coauthors=Noah Walton, Dean Lin, Katrin Goetz, Grigori Enikolopov, Steve Roper, Dennis Steindler|pmid=15961540|volume=102|issue=26|pmc=1150897|pages=9353–9358|id= |url=|format= }}</ref>

==Mechanisms of neuropoiesis==
Although the exact chemical signaling pathways which regulate Neuropoiesis are still poorly understood, there have been some recent advances in this field. [[Hematopoiesis]], the differentiation of stem cells in the bone marrow to form blood cells, is a comparatively well studied phenomenon, and the study of hematopoiesis has yielded some insight into the mechanisms of neuropoiesis.<ref name="schefflerhemo">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(99)01416-2|title=Marrow-mindedness: a perspective on neuropoiesis|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=1999|first=Bjorn|last=Scheffler|coauthors=Meyer Horn, Ingmar Blumcke, Eric Laywell, Debra Coomes, Valery Kukekov, Dennis Steindler|pmid=10407420|volume=22|issue=8|pages=348–357|id= |url=|format= }}</ref><ref name="Terskith">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.81.s1.105.x|title=From hematopoiesis to neuropoiesis: evidence of overlapping genetic programs|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|year=2002|first=Terskith|last=AV|coauthors=M Easterday, L Li, L Hood, H Kornblum, D Geschwind, I Weissman|volume=81|issue=|pages=81–81|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref> Several developmental genes (e.g. Notch, Delta, neurogenin, neuregulin, OCT, Presenilin) growth factors (e.g. epidermal growth factor, NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and [[extracellular matrix]] proteins (e.g. tenascin, CD34) have been linked to the mechanisms of neuropoiesis.<ref name="schefflerhemo" /><ref name="Terskith"/><ref>{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1101/gad.1772509|title= Revert field A high throughput embryonic stem cell screen identifies Oct-2 as a bifunctional regulator of neuronal differentiation|journal=Genes & Development|year=2009|first=E|last=Theodorou|coauthors=G Dalembert, C Heffelfinger, E White, S Weissman, L Corcoran, M Snyder|volume=23|issue=5|pages=575–588|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref> Many of these factors were originally identified as involved in hematopoiesis, but have since been found in neuropoetic cells in the [[subventricular zone|SVZ]].<ref name="schefflerhemo" /><ref name="Terskith"/><ref name="Wenreview">{{cite journal | author = Wen Shu, Li Hong, Liu Jia | year = 2009 | title = Epigenetic background of neuronal fate determination | url = | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 87 | issue = 2| pages = 98–117 | doi = 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.10.002 | pmid = 19007844 }}</ref><ref name="presenilin">{{Cite journal|title=Presenilins are required for maintenance of neural stem cells in the developing brain|journal=Molecular Neurodegeneration|year=2008|first=W Y|last=Kim|coauthors=J Shen|volume=3|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref>

==Research applications==
While a full understanding of neuropoiesis is still some time away, there are numerous applications for this research. A complete understanding of the mechanisms for neural differentiation and proliferation could prove to be crucial to the treatment of [[neurodegenerative diseases]]. Towards this end, many researchers are attempting to control the differentiation and proliferation of neural stem cells ''in vivo'' by altering the expression of key genes such as presenilins and the sonic hedgehog pathway.<ref name="Wenreview"/><ref name="presenilin"/><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Reprogramming of human somatic cells to pluripotency with defined factors|journal=Nature|year=2008|first=I H|last=Park|coauthors=R Zhao, A West, A Yabuuchi, H Huo, Ince T, P Lerou, M Lensch, G Daley|volume=451|issue=7175|pages=141–6|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=|pmid=18157115|doi=10.1038/nature06534}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1074/jbc.M109.026328|title=Differential Processing of Amyloid-beta Precursor Protein Directs Human Embryonic Stem Cell Proliferation and Differentiation into Neuronal Precursor Cells|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|year=2009|first=P|last=Porayette|coauthors=M gallego, M Kaltcheva, R Bowen, S Meethal, C Atwood|pmid=19542221|volume=284|issue=35|pmc=2749153|pages=23806–23817|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref>
