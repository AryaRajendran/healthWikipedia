'''Hypertryptophanemia''', also called '''familial hypertryptophanemia''',<ref name=omim>{{OMIM|600627}}</ref> is a rare [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]<ref name=ht95>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.1995.tb03956.x |author=Martin JR, Mellor CS, Fraser FC |title=Familial hypertryptophanemia in two siblings |journal=Clin Genet. |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=180–183 |year=1995 |month= April|pmid=7628119}}</ref> [[metabolic disorder]] that results in a massive buildup of the [[amino acid]] [[tryptophan]] in the [[blood]], with associated symptoms and tryptophanuria (''-uria'' denotes "in the [[urine]]").<ref name=ht83>{{cite journal |pmid=6883719 |year=1983 |month= July|author=Snedden W, Mellor CS, Martin JR |title=Familial hypertryptophanemia, tryptophanuria and indoleketonuria. |volume=131 |issue=3 |pages=247–256 |issn=0009-8981 |journal=Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry |doi=10.1016/0009-8981(83)90094-3}}</ref><ref name=ht82>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198211253072219 |pmid=7133092 |issn=0028-4793 |year=1982 |month= November|author=Snedden W, Mellor CS, Martin JR |title=Hypertryptophanemia and indoleketonuria in two mentally subnormal siblings. |volume=307 |issue=22 |pages=1405 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+73-22-3 |format=Free full text}}</ref>

Elevated levels of tryptophan are also seen in [[Hartnup disease]],<ref name=ohd>{{OMIM|234500}}</ref> a disorder of amino acid transport.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15286788 |year=2004 |month= September|author=Seow HF, Bröer S, Bröer A, Bailey CG, Potter SJ, Cavanaugh JA, Rasko JE |title=Hartnup disorder is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19. |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=1003–1007 |doi=10.1038/ng1406 |journal=Nature Genetics}}</ref> However, the increase of tryptophan in that disorder is negligible when compared to that of hypertryptophanemia.<ref name=omim/><ref name=ohd/>

==Symptoms==
A number of abnormalities and symptoms have been observed with hypertryptophanemia. 

Musculoskeletal effects include: [[joint]] [[muscle contracture|contractures]] of the [[elbow]]s and [[interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal]] joints of the [[finger]]s and [[thumb]]s (specifically the [[distal phalanges]]), [[flat feet|pes planus]] (fallen [[arches of the foot|arches]]), an [[ulna]]r drift affecting the fingers of both [[hand]]s (an unusual, yet correctible feature where the fingers slant toward the ulnar side of the [[forearm]]), joint pain and laxity, and [[adduction]] of the thumbs (where the thumb appears drawn into the palm, related to contracture of the [[adductor pollicis muscle|adductor pollicis]]).<ref name=omim/><ref name=ht95/>

Behavioral, developmental and other anomalies often include: [[hypersexuality]], [[sensory defensiveness|perceptual hypersensitivity]], [[labile affect|emotional lability]] ([[lability|mood swings]]),<ref name=ht83/> [[aggression|hyperaggressive]] behavior;<ref name=ht95/> [[hypertelorism]] (widely-set [[human eye|eye]]s),
optical [[strabismus]] (misalignment) and [[myopia]].<ref name=omim/><ref name=ht95/>

Metabolically, hypertryptophanemia results in tryptophanuria and exhibits significantly elevated [[blood plasma|serum]] levels of tryptophan, exceeding 650% of maximum (normal range: 25-73 [[mole (unit)|micromole]]/l) in some instances.<ref name=ht95/><ref name=ht83/> 

A product of the [[bacterium|bacterial]] [[biosynthesis]] of tryptophan is [[indole]].<ref name=trole>{{cite journal |pmid=18486479 |year=2008 |month= June|author=Dunn MF, Niks D, Ngo H, Barends TR, Schlichting I |title=Tryptophan synthase: the workings of a channeling nanomachine. |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=254–264 |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2008.04.008 |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences}}</ref><ref name=trole2>{{cite journal |pmid=2186812 |year=1990 |month= March|author=Houben KF, Dunn MF |title=Allosteric effects acting over a distance of 20-25 A in the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase bienzyme complex increase ligand affinity and cause redistribution of covalent intermediates. |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=2421–2429 |issn=0006-2960 |journal=Biochemistry |doi=10.1021/bi00461a028}}</ref> The excess of tryptophan in hypertryptophanemia also results in substantial [[excretion]] of indoleic acids. These findings suggest a possible [[congenital disorder|congenital]] defect in the metabolic pathway where tryptophan is converted to [[kynurenine]].<ref name=ht83/>

==Pathophysiology==

At present, no specific [[enzyme]] deficiency nor [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] has been implicated as the cause of hypertryptophanemia.<ref name=omim/><ref name=ht95/> Several known factors regarding tryptophan metabolism and kynurenines, however, may explain the presence of behavioral abnormalities seen with the disorder.   

Tryptophan is an [[essential amino acid]], and is required for [[protein]] [[protein synthesis|synthesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10867060 |date=1 July 2000|author=Reeds PJ |title=Dispensable and indispensable amino acids for humans. |volume=130 |issue=7 |pages=1835S–1840S |issn=0022-3166 |journal=The Journal of nutrition |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10867060 |format=Free full text }}</ref> Aside from this crucial role, the remainder of tryptophan is primarily metabolized along the kynurenine pathway in most [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], including those of the [[brain]] and [[central nervous system]].<ref name=trab>{{cite journal |pmid=10936623 |year=2001 |month= January|author=Stone TW |title=Endogenous neurotoxins from tryptophan. |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=61–73 |issn=0041-0101 |journal=Toxicon |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(00)00156-2}}</ref><ref name=trab03>{{cite journal |pmid=12940508 |year=2003 |month= July|author=Stone TW, Mackay GM, Forrest CM, Clark CJ, Darlington LG |title=Tryptophan metabolites and brain disorders. |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=852–859 |doi=10.1515/CCLM.2003.129 |journal=[[Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine]] : CCLM / FESCC}}</ref><ref name=trab07>{{cite journal |pmid=17712616 |year=2007 |month= December|author=Stone TW, Forrest CM, Mackay GM, Stoy N, Darlington LG |title=Tryptophan, adenosine, neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. |volume=22 |issue=3–4 |pages=337–352 |doi=10.1007/s11011-007-9064-3 |journal=Metabolic brain disease}}</ref><ref name=kac>{{cite journal |author=Stone TW |title=Kynurenic acid antagonists and kynurenine pathway inhibitors |journal=Expert Opin Investig Drugs |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=633–645 |year=2001 |month= April|pmid=11281814 |doi=10.1517/13543784.10.4.633}}</ref>

As the main defect behind hypertryptophanemia is suspected to alter and disrupt the metabolic pathway from tryptophan to kynurenine,<ref name=ht95/> a possible correlation between hypertryptophanemia and the known effects of kynurenines on [[neuron]]al function, [[physiology]] and behavior may be of interest.<ref name=kybe>{{cite journal |pmid=16942634 |year=2006 |month= August|author=Ruddick JP, Evans AK, Nutt DJ, Lightman SL, Rook GA, Lowry CA |title=Tryptophan metabolism in the central nervous system: medical implications |volume=8 |issue=20 |pages=1–27 |issn= |doi=10.1017/S1462399406000068 |journal=Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine}}</ref><ref name=inbe>{{cite journal |pmid=10443567 |year=1999 |month= June|author=Moroni F |title=Tryptophan metabolism and brain function: focus on kynurenine and other indole metabolites |volume=375 |issue=1–3 |pages=87–100 |issn=0014-2999 |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(99)00196-X}}</ref>

One of these kynurenines, aptly named [[kynurenic acid]], serves as a neuroprotectant through its function as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] at both [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nicotinic]] and [[glutamate receptor]]s (responsive to the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[nicotine]] and [[glutamate]], respectively).<ref name=trab03/><ref name=trab07/> This action is in opposition to the [[agonist]] [[quinolinic acid]], another kynurenine, noted for its potential as a [[neurotoxin]].<ref name=trab/><ref name=kac/> Quinolinic acid activity has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]], the neuroprective abilities of kynurenic acid forming a counterbalance against this process, and the related [[excitotoxicity]] and similar damaging effects on neurons.<ref name=kac/><ref name=kybe/> 

Indoleic acid excretion is another indicator of hypertryptophanemia.<ref name=ht95/><ref name=ht83/> Indirectly related to kynurenine metabolism, indole modifies neural function and human behavior by interacting with [[voltage|voltage-dependant]] [[sodium channel]]s ([[integral membrane protein]]s that form [[ion channel]]s, allowing vital [[synapse|synaptic]] [[action potential]]s).<ref name=inbe/>

== Inheritance ==

[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Familial Hypertryptophanemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]         

Hypertryptophanemia is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.<ref name=ht95/> This means a defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.
