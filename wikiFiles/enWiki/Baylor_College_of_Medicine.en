==History==
The school was formed in 1900 in [[Dallas, Texas]], by a small group of Baylor Alumni physicians who aimed to improve medical practice in North Texas. Originally called the University of Dallas Medical Department, the school opened its doors October 30, 1900, with 81 students. In 1903, an alliance with [[Baylor University]] in Waco was formed and the name changed to Baylor University College of Medicine.

By 1918, Baylor University College of Medicine was the only private medical school in Texas. The M.D. Anderson Foundation invited Baylor University College to join the newly formed [[Texas Medical Center]] in 1943. The College opened in the medical center on July 12, 1943, in a converted Sears, Roebuck & Co. building, with 131 students. Four years later, the College moved into its present site in The Roy and Lillie Cullen Building, the first building completed in the Texas Medical Center.

In 1948, [[Michael E. DeBakey]] joined the faculty as chair of the Department of Surgery, and the following year, The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences was established. The College's rise in prominence began in the 1950s when Dr. DeBakey's innovative surgical techniques garnered international attention. In the 1960s, the college underwent its first major expansion.

In 1969, the College separated from Baylor University and became an independent institution, which allowed it access to federal research funding. The institution's name changed to Baylor College of Medicine. That same year, the College entered into an agreement with the state legislature to double its class size in order to increase the number of physicians in Texas.<ref>[http://www.bcm.edu/about/history.cfm BCM History - Baylor College of Medicine - Houston, Texas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2005, Baylor College of Medicine began the process of building a hospital and clinic, to be called The Baylor Hospital, slated to open in 2011. In 2009, the college postponed construction due to lack of funds, with the outer shell of the hospital completed and the interiors remaining unfinished.  In March of 2012, BCM decided to convert the building to an outpatient clinics center.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Baylor-hospital-project-to-be-outpatient-center-3383881.php Baylor hospital project to be outpatient center - Houston Chronicle<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.bcm.edu/about/affiliates.cfm Affiliated Hospitals - Baylor College of Medicine - Houston, Texas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2009, BCM entered into discussions with [[Rice University]] regarding a potential merger between the two Houston institutions. After extensive meetings, the boards at both institutions decided that each school would remain an independent. In 2010, Baylor University entered into talks with BCM to strengthening ties to each other; however, the BCM board decided that it would remain an independent institution for the time being.

==Medical school==
Each year the medical school matriculates around 172, around 75% of whom are Texas residents. In 2010, the average undergraduate GPA was 3.80 and the average MCAT score was 33.1.<ref>[http://www.bcm.edu/medschool/snapshot.html Baylor College of Medicine: Snapshot of the Student Body]</ref>  In the 2014 ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' top medical schools rankings, Baylor College of Medicine was ranked 18th for research and 24th for primary care, making it the highest ranked medical school in Texas and the greater Southwest.<ref>[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/research-rankings U.S. News and World Report]</ref> 

Baylor College of Medicine is the only private medical school in the southwest region of the United States, and has the lowest tuition of all United States private medical schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  Baylor is one of the few medical schools in the United States that is structured with an accelerated 1.5 year preclinical curriculum (the others are [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in [[New York City]], the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], [[University of Virginia School of Medicine]], and [[Emory University School of Medicine]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]). BCM has nearly 4,000 staff faculty (including affiliated hospital faculty, volunteer faculty and emeritus) with a faculty-student ratio of 5 to 1.<ref name="bcm.edu"/>

Baylor College of Medicine is also one of only 45 medical institutions in the United States to offer a [[Medical Scientist Training Program]].<ref>[http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/PredocOverview-MSTP.htm Medical Scientist Training Program - National Institute of General Medical Sciences<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This federally sponsored and highly competitive program allows exceptionally well qualified students to study for a combined MD and PhD in a medical science to be earned in 7-9 total years.

==Graduate Program in Nurse Anesthesia==
Baylor College of Medicine houses one of the top-ranked nurse anesthesia programs in the country. Currently accepting 15 students per year, applicants are among the brightest minds in critical care nursing, each possessing experience in a variety of intense settings. The program is academically front-loaded with students beginning coursework in January and completing 18 months of comprehensive didactic preparation prior to immersion into clinical anesthesia training. 

Clinical anesthesia experiences are gained within the distinguished [[Texas Medical Center]], and include an array of settings, such as pediatric, obstetric, cardiovascular, and trauma anesthesia. The clinical phase of the program is 18 months in length, and enables graduates to enter practice as proficient, well-equipped, doctorally-prepared anesthetists. Additionally, throughout their training, students are given ample opportunities to enhance non-clinical skills, such as leadership and research, with nationally-recognized faculty members.

Transitioning in 2011, the BCM GPNA now offers a post-master’s track for practicing anesthetists interested in obtaining their Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). Over 24 months, the curriculum will focus on producing leaders in clinical practice, as well as, healthcare research, education, and policy. Graduates will embrace innovation, technology, and evidence-based approaches within a culture of lifelong learning.

==Physician Assistant program==
Baylor College of Medicine is also home to a [[Physician Assistant]] (PA) program. Forty PA students are accepted each year. For PA students entering in 2004, the average GPA was 3.70 and the average GRE score was 1169 verbal/quantitative and 4.9 analytical. Baylor College of Medicine ranked 7th in the 2007 [[U.S. News and World Report]] rankings for Physician Assistant schools. The overall passing rate for all graduates of the PA Program on the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination is 97 percent with a 100 percent pass rate for the past eight years.

==Residency training==
Baylor College of Medicine offers residency training in a wide variety of specialties. Notable departments at the college include the Department of [[Pediatrics]], led until 2008 by world-renowned pediatrician Dr. [[Ralph Feigin]] and currently by Dr. [[Mark Kline]], a world expert on pediatric HIV, and the Department of [[Surgery]] founded by Dr. [[Michael E. DeBakey]], the world-renowned cardiothoracic surgeon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.debakeydepartmentofsurgery.org/home/content.cfm?menu_id=21|title=Michael E.

==Hospital affiliation==
BCM is affiliated with many of the hospitals that make the [[Texas Medical Center]] the largest medical center in the world. BCM's affiliations include:

*[[Texas Children's Hospital]]
*[[The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center]]
*[[The Methodist Hospital]]
*[[St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital]] & [[The Texas Heart Institute]]
*[[Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center]]
*[[Ben Taub General Hospital]]
*[[Memorial Hermann Healthcare System|Memorial Hermann - The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research]]
*[[Menninger Clinic]]

Cooperating Patient Care Institutions:

* Community Health Centers
* Cullen Bayou Place
* [[DePelchin Children's Center]]
* Houston Child Guidance Center
* Jewish Family Service Cancer Center
* Kelsey-Seybold Clinic
* Park Plaza Hospital
* Quentin Mease Hospital
* Seven Acres Jewish Geriatric Center
* Houston Shriners Hospital (orthopedic)
* Thomas Street AIDS Clinic
* [[Woman's Hospital of Texas]]

[[The Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]] had been Baylor's primary private teaching hospital for many decades. Baylor and Methodist dissolved some of their connections during a conflict in 2004 for reasons that seem to revolve around a planned ambulatory care center and ownership of the physicians' private practices. Methodist and Baylor retain a number of important affiliations, however, and Baylor medical students and residents continue to rotate through The Methodist Hospital. In the meantime, Baylor has strengthened its ties to other Medical Center hospitals like MD Anderson and St. Luke's, leading, for example, to the recent decision for MD Anderson's chairman of neurosurgery to also be chair at Baylor.

Baylor initiated plans to build its own hospital and clinic after ties with [[The Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]] were dissolved.  The Baylor Clinic is currently in operation and the 600 bed not-for-profit hospital's exteriors are complete but construction is currently suspended on the interiors due to economic concerns.<ref>{{cite web | title = Baylor med school to put Houston hospital work on hold | work = The Houston Chronicle | accessdate = 2009-03-27| url = http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nb/bellaire/news/6342486.html}}</ref> The hospital will be located in Texas Medical Center on the McNair Campus of Baylor College of Medicine near [[Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center]] on Old Spanish Trail. Once the Hospital building is fully complete the Baylor Clinic will move from its current location to the McNair Campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcm.edu/pdf/bchfactsheet0108.pdf|title=Baylor College of Medicine Webpage}}</ref>

==Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative==
The Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) <http://bayloraids.org> at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital was established in 1996, and has rapidly become the world's largest university-based program dedicated to global pediatric and family HIV/AIDS care and treatment, health professional training and clinical research. Baylor constructed and opened the world's two largest centers for the care and treatment of HIV-infected children and families, the Romanian-American Children's Center in Constanta, Romania in 2001, and the Botswana-Baylor Children's Clinical Center of Excellence in Gaborone, Botswana in 2003. These centers have transformed the care and treatment of pediatric HIV/AIDS in the two countries, making Romania and Botswana two of a precious few countries worldwide where children are at least proportionately represented among those accessing HIV/AIDS care and treatment. BIPAI has replicated these successes in Uganda, Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi, and Tanzania, where it has entered into partnership with the Ministries of Health to scale up pediatric HIV/AIDS care and treatment, and build and open new Children's Clinical Centers of Excellence.

BIPAI also has created the Pediatric AIDS Corps; a model program to place up to 250 American pediatricians and infectious disease specialists in its African centers to vastly expand capacity for pediatric HIV/AIDS care and treatment and health professional training.   Major funders of BIPAI's activities include NIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, Abbott Laboratories, and numerous private and corporate foundations.
