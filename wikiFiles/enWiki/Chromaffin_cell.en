'''Chromaffin cells''' are [[neuroendocrine cell]]s found mostly in the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal gland]]s (located above the kidneys) in [[mammal]]s. They are in close proximity to pre-synaptic [[sympathetic ganglia]] of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], with which they communicate, and structurally they are similar to post-synaptic sympathetic neurons. They release [[catecholamine]]s: ~80% of [[Epinephrine]] ([[Adrenaline]]) and ~20%  of [[Norepinephrine]] ([[Noradrenaline]]) into [[systemic circulation]] for systemic effects on multiple organs (similarly to secretory neurons of the [[hypothalamus]]), and can also send [[paracrine]] signals. Hence they are called neuroendocrine cells.

In the mammalian fetal development (fourth to fifth week in humans), [[neuroblast]] cells migrate from the [[neural crest]] to form the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic chain]] and [[preaortic ganglia]]. The cells migrate a second time to the adrenal medulla.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ehrlich|first=ME|coauthors=Evinger, M; Regunathan, S; Teitelman, G|title=Mammalian adrenal chromaffin cells coexpress the epinephrine-synthesizing enzyme and neuronal properties in vivo and in vitro.|journal=Developmental biology|date=1994 Jun|volume=163|issue=2|pages=480-90|pmid=8200483}}</ref> Chromaffin cells also settle near the [[sympathetic ganglia]], [[vagus nerve]], [[paraganglia]], and [[carotid arteries]].

In non-mammals, chromaffin cells are found in a variety of places, generally not organized as an individual organ, and may be without innervation, relying only on [[endocrine]] or [[paracrine]] signals for secretion.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=SF|coauthors=Capaldo, A|title=The autonomic nervous system and chromaffin tissue: neuroendocrine regulation of catecholamine secretion in non-mammalian vertebrates.|journal=Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical|date=2011 Nov 16|volume=165|issue=1|pages=54-66|pmid=20547474}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Pohorecky|first=LA|coauthors=Wurtman, RJ|title=Adrenocortical control of epinephrine synthesis.|journal=Pharmacological reviews|date=1971 Mar|volume=23|issue=1|pages=1-35|pmid=4941407|url=http://wurtmanlab.mit.edu/static/pdf/151.pdf}}</ref>

==Function==
[[File:Adrenaline.svg|thumb|[[Epinephrine]]]]
[[File:Norepinephrine structure.png|thumb|[[Norepinephrine]]]]
Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are innervated by the [[splanchnic nerve]] and secrete adrenaline ([[epinephrine]]), noradrenaline ([[norepinephrine]]), a little [[dopamine]], [[enkephalin]] and enkephalin-containing peptides, and a few other hormones into the [[blood]] stream. The secreted adrenaline and noradrenaline play an important role in the [[fight-or-flight response]]. The enkephalins and enkephalin-containing peptides are related to, but distinct from endogenous peptides named [[endorphin]]s (which are secreted from the pituitary); all of these peptides bind to opioid receptors and produce analgesic (and other) responses. The hormones are secreted from [[chromaffin granule]]s; this is where the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Szewczyk|first=A|coauthors=Lobanov, NA; Kicińska, A; Wójcik, G; Nałecz, MJ|title=ATP-sensitive K+ transport in adrenal chromaffin granules.|journal=Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis|date=2001|volume=61|issue=1|pages=1-12|pmid=11315316|url=http://www.ane.pl/pdf/6101.pdf}}</ref>  Distinct N and E cell forms exist (also Na and A cells in British nomenclature - noradrenaline and adrenaline); the former produce norepinephrine, the latter arise out of N cells through interaction with glucocorticoids, and convert norepinephrine into epinephrine.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wheater's Functional Histology |edition=5th |editor1-last=Young |editor2-last=Lowe |editor3-last=Stevens |editor4-last=Heath |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |isbn=0-443-06850-X |year=2006 }}</ref>

==Nomenclature==
The word 'Chromaffin' comes from a portmanteau of ''chrom''ium and ''affin''ity. They are named as such because they can be visualized by [[stain]]ing with [[chromium]] salts. Chromium salts oxidize and polymerize [[catecholamines]] to form a brown color, most strongly in the cells secreting noradrenaline. Chromaffin cells are also called pheochromocytes.

The [[enterochromaffin cells]] are so named because of their histological similarity to chromaffin cells (they also stain yellow when treated with chromium salts), but their function is quite different and they are not derivatives of the neural crest.

[[Paraganglia]] are clusters of either chromaffin cells of [[glomus cell]]s near sympathetic ganglia.

==Pathology==
[[Neoplasm]]s arising from these cells are [[pheochromocytoma]]s (also called chromaffin or sympathetic paragangliomas, in contrast to non-chromaffin or parasympathetic [[paraganglioma]]s of glomus cells). Sometimes only neoplasms of adrenal origin are named pheochromocytomas, while others are named extra-adrenal paragangliomas.
