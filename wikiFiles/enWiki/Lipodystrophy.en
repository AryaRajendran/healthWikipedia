'''Lipodystrophy''' is a medical condition characterized by abnormal or degenerative conditions of the body's [[adipose tissue]]. ("Lipo" is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "fat" and "dystrophy" is Greek for "abnormal or degenerative condition".) A more specific term, [[lipoatrophy]] is used when describing the loss of fat from one area (usually the face). This condition is also characterized by a lack of circulating [[leptin]] which may lead to [[osteosclerosis]].

== Types ==
Lipodystrophy is be divided into the following types:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|495-7}}

== Insulin injections ==
A lipodystrophy can be a lump or small dent in the [[skin]] that forms when a person keeps performing [[Injection (medicine)|injections]] in the same spot. These types of lipodystrophies are harmless. People who want to avoid them can do so by changing (rotating) the places where they perform injections. For people with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], using purified [[insulin]]s may also help.

One of the side-effects of lipodystrophy is the rejection of the injected medication, the slowing down of the absorption of the medication, or trauma that can cause bleeding that, in turn, will reject the medication.  In any of these scenarios, the dosage of the medication, such as insulin for diabetics, becomes impossible to gauge correctly and the treatment of the disease for which the medication is administered is impaired thereby allowing the medical condition to worsen.

In some cases, rotation of the injection sites may not be enough to prevent lipodystrophy.

== Antiretroviral drugs ==
Lipodystrophies can be a possible side effect of [[antiretroviral drug]]s.  Other lipodystrophies manifest as [[lipid]] redistribution; with excess, or lack of, fat in various regions of the body.  These include, but are not limited to, having sunken cheeks and/or "humps" on the back or back of the neck (also referred to as buffalo hump)<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=19678 Physical and Biochemical Changes in HIV Disease] Eric S. Daar, M.D. MedicineNet, Accessed 22 September 2007</ref> which also exhibits due to excess [[cortisol]].

== Hereditary forms ==
Lipodystrophy can be caused by metabolic abnormalities due to genetic issues. These are often characterized by [[insulin resistance]] and are associated with [[Metabolic Syndrome]].
