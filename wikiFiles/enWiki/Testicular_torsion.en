'''Testicular torsion''' occurs when the [[spermatic cord]] (from which the [[testicle]] is suspended) twists, cutting off the testicle's blood supply, a condition called [[ischemia]].  The principal symptom is rapid onset of [[testicular pain]]. The most common underlying cause is a congenital malformation known as a "bell-clapper deformity" wherein the testis is inadequately affixed to the scrotum allowing it to move freely on its axis and susceptible to induced twisting of the cord and its vessels. The diagnosis can be made clinically but an urgent [[ultrasound]] is helpful in evaluation. Irreversible ischemia begins around six hours after onset and emergency diagnosis and treatment is required within this time in order to minimize [[necrosis]] and to improve the chance of salvaging the testicle.

==Signs and symptoms==
Testicular torsion usually presents with acute, diffuse, [[testicular pain]] and tenderness. There is often an absent or decreased [[cremasteric reflex]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Karmazyn B |title=Clinical and sonographic criteria of acute scrote in children: a retrospective study of 172 boys |journal=Pediatr Radiol |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=302–10 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15503003 |doi=10.1007/s00247-004-1347-9 |url=|author-separator=,|author2=Steinberg R|author3=Kornreich L|display-authors=3|last4=Freud|first4=Enrique|last5=Grozovski|first5=Sylvia|last6=Schwarz|first6=Michael|last7=Ziv|first7=Nitza|last8=Livne|first8=Pinchas}}</ref> Many of the symptoms are similar to [[epididymitis]] though epididymitis may be characterized by discoloration and swelling of the testis, often with fever, while the cremasteric reflex is not affected. Both conditions can, of course, co-occur. Testicular torsion, or more probably impending testicular [[infarction]], can also produce a low-grade fever.<ref name=kav>{{Cite book

==Risk factors==
===Congenital===
Conditions that allow the testicle to rotate predispose to torsion.<ref name=PC2010/> A congenital malformation of the [[processus vaginalis]] known as the "[[bell-clapper deformity]]" accounts for 90% of all cases.<ref name=AFP2006/> In this condition, rather than the testes attaching posteriorly to the inner lining of the scrotum by the [[mesorchium]], the mesorchium terminates early and the testis is free floating in the [[tunica vaginalis]].

===Temperature===
Torsions are sometimes called "winter syndrome" because they are more frequent in cold conditions, specifically decreasing atmospheric temperature and humidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347%2807%2902056-3/abstract |title=Climatic Conditions and the Risk of Testicular Torsion in Adolescent Males |publisher=Jurology.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Immediate testing for torsion is indicated when the onset of testicular pain is sudden and/or severe. In general a doppler ultrasound should be obtained in low suspicion cases to rule out torsion while in those cases with a convincing history and physical exam immediate surgical detorsion (derotation) is reasonable.<ref name=PC2010/>

===Clinical exam===
[[Prehn's sign]], a classic physical exam finding, has not been reliable in distinguishing torsion from other causes of testicular pain such as epididymitis.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lavallee ME, Cash J |title=Testicular torsion: evaluation and management |journal=Curr Sports Med Rep |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=102–4 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15763047 |doi= |url=}}</ref> In cases of true torsion the cremasteric reflex is typically absent (the twisted cords of the testicle make reflexive responses all but impossible), the scrotum is generally neither swollen nor discolored, and the affected testis may have a horizontal lie.<ref name=PC2010/>  The individual will not usually have a fever, though nausea is common.

===Imaging===
A [[ultrasound|doppler ultrasound scan]], also called a high-frequency transducer sonography and including pulsed color Doppler imaging, of the scrotum is nearly 100% accurate at detecting torsion.<ref name=PC2010/> It is identified by the absence of blood flow in the twisted testicle, which distinguishes the condition from [[epididymitis]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Arce J, Cortés M, Vargas J | title = Sonographic diagnosis of acute spermatic cord torsion.

Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate, diagnostic, imaging technique, but it is not routinely available, particularly with the urgency that might be required.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/ Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010] from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Recommendations and Reports. December 17, 2010 / Vol. 59 / No. RR-12</ref> The agent of choice for this purpose is technetium-99m pertechnetate.<ref name=medscape>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/381204-overview#a23 Medscape > Testicular Torsion Imaging] by David Paushter. Updated: May 25, 2011</ref> Initially it provides a [[radionuclide angiogram]], followed by a static image after the radionuclide has perfused the tissue. In the healthy patient, initial images show symmetric flow to the testes, and delayed images show uniformly symmetric activity.<ref name=medscape/>

==Pathophysiology==
Torsion is due to a mechanical twisting process. It is also believed that torsion occurring during fetal development can lead to so-called neonatal torsion or [[vanishing testis]], and is one of the causes of an infant being born with [[monorchism]] (one testicle)<ref>{{cite journal | title=New insights into perinatal testicular torsion | author=Callewaert PRH, Kerrebroeck PV | date=2010 June | journal=Eur J Pediatr | volume=169 | pages=705–12 | pmid=19856186 | doi=10.1007/s00431-009-1096-8 | issue=6 | pmc=2859224}}</ref> .

==Treatment==
With prompt diagnosis and treatment the testicle can usually be preserved.<ref name=PC2010/> Typically, when a torsion takes place, the surface of the testicle has rotated towards the midline of the body.  Non-surgical correction can sometimes be accomplished by manually rotating the testicle in the opposite direction (i.e., outward, towards the thigh); if this is initially unsuccessful, a forced manual rotation in the other direction may correct the problem.<ref name=uribe>{{Cite book

Testicular torsion is a [[surgical emergency]] that requires immediate intervention to restore the flow of blood.<ref name=PC2010/>  If treated either manually or surgically within six hours, there is a high chance (approx. 90%) of preserving the testicle.  At 12 hours the rate decreases to 50%; at 24 hours it drops to 10%, and after 24 hours the rate of preservation approaches 0.<ref name=PC2010/>

==Epidemiology==
Torsion is most frequent among adolescents with about 65% of cases presenting between 12 – 18 years of age.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Edelsberg JS, Surh YS |title=The acute scrotum |journal=Emerg. Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=521–46 |year=1988 |month=August |pmid=3292226 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  It occurs in about 1 in 160 males, or 1 in 4000 males per year, before 25 years of age<ref name=PC2010>{{Cite journal|author=Wampler SM, Llanes M |title=Common scrotal and testicular problems |journal=Prim.

==Intermittent testicular torsion==
A variant is a less serious but chronic condition called intermittent testicular torsion (ITT), characterized by the symptoms of torsion but followed by eventual spontaneous detortion and resolution of pain.  Nausea or vomiting may also occur.<ref name=uribe/>{{rp|p.150}}  Though less pressing, such individuals are at significant risk of complete torsion and possible subsequent [[orchiectomy]] and the recommended treatment is elective bilateral [[orchiopexy]].  Ninety-seven percent of patients who undergo such surgery experience complete relief from their symptoms.<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.316}}

==Extravaginal testicular torsion==
A torsion which occurs outside of the tunica vaginalis, when the testis and [[gubernaculum]] can rotate freely, is termed an extravaginal testicular torsion.  This type occurs exclusively in newborns. Neonates experiencing such a torsion present with scrotal swelling, discoloration, and a firm, painless mass in the scrotum.  Such testes are usually necrotic from birth and must be removed surgically.<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.315}}

==Torsion of the testicular appendix==
This type of torsion is the most common cause of acute scrotal pain in boys ages 7–14.  Its appearance is similar to that of testicular torsion but the onset of pain is more gradual.  [[Palpation]] reveals a small firm nodule on the upper portion of the testis which displays a characteristic "blue dot sign."  This is the appendix of the testis which has become discolored and is noticeably blue through the skin.  Unlike other torsions, however, the cremasteric reflex is still active.  Typical treatment involves the use of over-the-counter [[analgesics]] and the condition resolves within 2–3 days.<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.316}}
