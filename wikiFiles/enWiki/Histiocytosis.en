In [[medicine]], '''histiocytosis''' refers to an excessive number of [[histiocyte]]s,<ref>{{EMedicineDictionary|Histiocytosis}}</ref> (''tissue [[macrophages]]''), and is typically used to refer to a group of rare diseases which share this as a characteristic.  Occasionally and confusingly, the term "histiocytosis" is sometimes used to refer to individual diseases.

According to the [[Histiocytosis Association]], 1 in 200,000 children in the [[United States]] are born with histiocytosis each year.<ref>[http://www.histio.org/site/c.kiKTL4PQLvF/b.1810505/k.F16D/Disease_Information.htm Disease information] at the Histiocytosis Association of America</ref> HAA also states that most of the people diagnosed with histiocytosis are children under the age of 10, although the disease can aflict adults. The [[University of California, San Francisco]], states that the disease usually occurs from birth to age 15.<ref>[http://www.ucsfhealth.org/childrens/medical_services/cancer/histio/conditions/histio/signs.html Histiocytosis - Signs and Symptoms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Histiocytosis (and [[malignant histiocytosis]]) are both important in veterinary as well as human pathology.

==Classification, and relationships to other conditions==
There are competing systems for classifying histiocytoses. According to the 1999 classification proposed by the [[World Health Organization]], they can be divided into three categories.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harris N, Jaffe E, Diebold J, Flandrin G, Muller-Hermelink H, Vardiman J, Lister T, Bloomfield C |title=The World Health Organization classification of neoplastic diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Report of the Clinical Advisory Committee meeting, Airlie House, Virginia, November, 1997 |journal=Ann Oncol |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=1419–32 |year=1999 |pmid=10643532 |doi=10.1023/A:1008375931236}}</ref><ref>{{EMedicine|ped|1997|Histiocytosis}}</ref> However, the classifications in ICD10 and MeSH are slightly different, as shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Name''' || '''WHO''' || '''[[ICD10]]''' ||  '''[[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]]'''
 |-
 | [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] (LCH) || I || {{ICD10|D|76|0|d|70}}  || Langerhans-cell histiocytosis
 |-
 | [[Juvenile xanthogranuloma]] (JXG) || II || {{ICD10|D|76|3|d|70}}  ||  non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis
 |-
 | [[Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]] (HLH)  || II   || {{ICD10|D|76|1|d|70}} ||  non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis
 |-
 | [[Niemann–Pick disease]] || II || {{ICD10|E|75|2|e|70}} || non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis
 |-
 | [[Sea-blue histiocytosis]] || II || - || non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis
 |-
 | [[Acute monocytic leukemia]] || III    || {{ICD10|C|93|0|c|81}} || malignant histiocytic disorders
 |-
 | [[Malignant histiocytosis]] || III || {{ICD10|C|96|1|c|81}} || malignant histiocytic disorders
 |-
 | [[Erdheim–Chester disease]] || II || {{ICD10|C|96|1|c|81}} || malignant histiocytic disorders
|}

Types of LCH have also been known as "Eosinophilic Granuloma", "Hand-Schuller-Christian Disease", "Letterer-Siwe Disease", and "Histiocytosis X". (See [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] for details).

Alternatively, histiocytoses may be divided into the following groups:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|714-724}}

:* [[X-type histiocytoses]]
:* [[Non-X histiocytoses]]

==Common treatments==
*Chemotherapy
**[[Cladribine]] (also known as 2CDA or Leustatin)
**[[Etoposide]]
**[[Vinblastine]] (Velban)

==Organizations==
Patients and families can gain support and educational materials from the [http://www.histio.org Histiocytosis Association], or the [http://www.hrtrust.org/ Histiocytosis Research Trust]. Information concerning histiocytosis and clinicians located in European countries may be found in many languages at the web portal of [http://www.eurohistio.net Euro Histio Net] (EHN).  This is a project funded by the European Union, co-ordinated by Dr. Jean Donadieu, [http://www.aphp.fr/ APHP], Paris, FRANCE.  Additional information about Erdheim-Chester Disease can be obtained from the [http://www.erdheim-chester.org ECD Global Alliance].

The [http://www.histiocytesociety.org Histiocyte Society], a nonprofit organization, is a group of more than 200 physicians and scientists from around the world committed to improving the lives of patients with histiocytic disorders by conducting clinical and laboratory research into the causes and treatment of this disease. The Society has instituted several [http://www.histiocytesociety.org/page.aspx?pid=768 clinical trials and treatment plans.]
