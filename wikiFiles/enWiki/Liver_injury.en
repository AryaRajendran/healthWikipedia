A '''liver injury''' is some form of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] sustained to the [[liver]]. This can occur through either a [[blunt trauma|blunt]] force such as a car accident, or a [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]] foreign object such as a [[knife]].<ref name="piper">{{cite journal |author=Piper GL, Peitzman AB |title=Current management of hepatic trauma |journal=The Surgical Clinics of North America |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=775–85 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20637947 |doi=10.1016/j.suc.2010.04.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039-6109(10)00044-7 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Liver injuries constitute 5% of all traumas, making it the most common abdominal injury.<ref name="clay">{{cite doi|10.1007/s00068-008-8029-5}}</ref> Generally nonoperative management and observation is all that is required for a full recovery.

==Cause==
Given its [[anterior]] position in the [[body]] and its [[large]] [[shape]], is it prone to [[ballistic trauma|gun shot wounds]] and [[stab wound]]s.<ref name="clay"/> Its firm location under the diaphragm also makes it especially prone to shearing forces.<ref name="piper"/> Common causes of this type of injury are blunt force mechanisms such as [[motor vehicle accidents]], [[fall]]s, and [[sports injury|sports injuries]]. Typically these blunt forces dissipate through and around the structure of the liver.<ref name="blunt"/> A large majority of of people who sustain this injury also have another accompanying injury.<ref name="piper"/>

==Diagnosis==
Imaging, such as the use of [[ultrasound]] or a [[computed tomography]] scan, is the generally preferred way of diagnosis as it is more accurate and is sensitive to bleeding, however; due to logistics this is not always possible.<ref>Moore 2012, p. 543</ref> For a person who is hemodynamically unstable a [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma]] (FAST) scan may take place which is used to find free floating fluid in the [[Right upper quadrant (abdomen)|right upper quadrant]] and [[left lower quadrant]] of the abdomen. A physical examination may be used but is typically inaccurate in blunt trauma, unlike in penetrating trauma where the trajectory the projectile took can be followed digitally.<ref>Pietzman 2002, p. 255</ref> A [[diagnostic peritoneal lavage]] may also be utilized but has limited application as it is hard to determine the origin of the bleeding.<ref>Moore 2012, p. 542</ref>

Liver injuries are [[:wikt:classified|classified]] on a [[roman numeral]] [[:wikt:scale|scale]] with I being the lease severe, to VI being the most severe. Generally any injury ≥III requires surgery.<ref name="blunt"/><ref name="polish"/>

==Management==
The initial management of liver trauma generally follows the same procedures for all traumas with a focus on maintaining [[airway]], [[breathing]], and [[circulation]]. A physical examination is a corner stone of the assessment of which there are various [[non-invasive]] means of diagnostic tools that can be utilized.<ref name="blunt"/> An invasive [[diagnostic peritoneal lavage]] can also be used to diagnose and classify the extent of the damage.<ref>Moore 2012, p. 541</ref><ref name="spanish">{{cite journal |author=Stracieri LD, Scarpelini S |title=Hepatic injury |journal=Acta Cirúrgica Brasileira / Sociedade Brasileira Para Desenvolvimento Pesquisa Em Cirurgia |volume=21 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=85–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17013521 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-86502006000700019&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en |accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref> A large majority of liver injuries are minor and require only observation.<ref name="isbn1-880696-14-2">{{cite book |author=American College of Surgeons |title=Atls, Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors |publisher=Amer College of Surgeons |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-880696-14-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Generally if there is estimated to me less than 300mL of free floating fluid, no injury to surrounding organs, an no need for blood transfusion, there is a low risk of complication from nonoperative management.<ref name="piper"/> In special cases where there is a higher risk with surgery, such as in the [[elderly]], nonoperative management would include the [[infusion]] of [[packed red blood cell]]s in an [[intensive care unit]].<ref name="clay"/> Typically hepatic injuries resulting from stab wounds cause little damage unless a vital part of the liver is injured such as the [[hepatic portal vein]], with [[gunshot wound]]s, the damage is worse.<ref name="trauma surgery">{{cite book |author=Kenneth D.

===Surgery===
In severe liver injuries (class ≥III), surgical correction is generally necessary. In these severe injuries a hepatopancreatobiliary surgeon may be utilized rather than a trauma surgeon given their expertise with the organ and generally yields better outcomes.<ref name="piper"/> Surgical techniques such as [[perihepatic packing]] or the use of the [[Pringle manoeuvre]] can be used to control [[hemorrhage]].<ref name ="clay"/><ref name="blunt">{{cite journal |author=Bouras AF, Truant S, Pruvot FR |title=Management of blunt hepatic trauma |journal=Journal of Visceral Surgery |volume=147 |issue=6 |pages=e351–8 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21111696 |doi=10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2010.10.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1878-7886(10)00148-7 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Temporary control of the hemorrhage can be direct manual pressure to the wound site.<ref name="clay"/> In these severe cases it is important to prevent the progression of the [[trauma triad of death]], which often requires the utilization of damage control surgery.<ref name="spanish"/> The common cause of death while operating is [[exsanguination]] caused by profuse loss of blood volume.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1177/1460408607086775}}</ref> Rarely, surgery entails the use of [[Hepatectomy|liver resection]], which removes the source of the bleeding and [[necrotic]] tissue. The drastic nature of this procedure means it can only be used in [[Hemodynamics|hemodynamically]] stable patients.<ref name="polish">{{cite doi|10.2478/v10035-009-0090-1}}</ref> Another rare procedure would be [[liver transplantation]] which is typically impractical due to the [[logistics]] of finding a proper [[organ donor]] in a timely fashion.<ref name="british">{{cite journal |author=Parks RW, Chrysos E, Diamond T |title=Management of liver trauma |journal=The British Journal of Surgery |volume=86 |issue=9 |pages=1121–35 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10504364 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2168.1999.01210.x |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2168.1999.01210.x |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>

==History==
In the 1880s a severe liver injury would in most cases prove fatal in the first 24 hours after sustaining the injury.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Moynihan | first1 = Baron Berkeley | title = Abdominal operations | publisher = Saunders | year = 1906 | pages = 563 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=2q0SAAAAYAAJ | accessdate = 2012-08-04}}</ref> Before the 1980s nonoperative management was seldom used in favor of the methods of management suggested by [[James Hogarth Pringle]].<ref name="pringle">{{cite journal |author=Pringle JH |title=V.
