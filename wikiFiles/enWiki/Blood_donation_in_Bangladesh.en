'''Blood donation in Bangladesh''' is an activity conducted by several different organisations. As of 2011, about 25% of the nation's blood supply came from voluntary donation, 20–25% from paid donors, and 50–55% from one-time donation for a specific patient.

==Background==
[[Blood transfusion]] service became available in [[Bangladesh]] at the [[Dhaka Medical College and Hospital|Dhaka Medical College Hospital]] in 1950.<ref name=MBI>{{cite doi|10.4103/0973-6247.53880}}</ref> Professional blood donors were the mainstay of blood donation in Bangladesh, with 47% of donated blood coming from professional donors as late as the year 2000.<ref name=MBI/> The potential for contamination in the supply, and the need for volunteer donors was well recognized.<ref name=MBI/> An estimate from 2011 is that of the 500,000 units of blood required annually, only 25% come from voluntary donation, 20–25% from paid donors, and 50–55% from one-time donation for a specific patient.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=198380&cid=2|journal=bd24news.com|author=Nurul Islam Hasib |title=Let Bangladeshi youth's blood 'flow'|date=14 June 2011}}</ref>

==Badhan==
A 1997 survey of students at the [[University of Dhaka]] had found a generally favourable attitude towards voluntary blood donation, and an overwhelmingly unfavourable attitude to paid blood donation, and recommended that a campaign should be started immediately to increase awareness and participation in voluntary blood donation among the student population.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hosain, G.M.M.; Anisuzzaman, M.; Begum, A.|year=1997|title=Knowledge and attitude towards voluntary blood donation among Dhaka University students in Bangladesh|journal=East African Medical Journal|volume=74|issue=9|pages=549–553|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9487428}}</ref>

Badhan is a non-political voluntary [[blood donation|blood donors']] organization in Bangladesh that was established in 1997.<ref name=badhan>{{citejournal|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/02/01/camspotlight_BADHAN.htm|title=Campus Spotlight: Badhan|journal=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=1 February 2007|author=Mahmud-Ur-Rashid}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Badhan's first activity was a free blood-group testing program that took place on 24 October, 1997 at [[Shahidullah Hall]] of the University of Dhaka.<ref name=badhan/> Shahidullah Hall is very close to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, and before that time people needing blood for patients would gather regularly in or near the hall gate, seeking help.<ref name=badhan/> Md. Shahidul Islam Ripon was a principal originator of the program, along with other students.<ref name=website/>

The blood provided is fresh rather than stored,<ref name=website>{{cite web|url=http://www.badhan.com.bd/|title=BADHAN (A Voluntary Blood Donor's Organization): Official Web Site}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> using a database of people whose blood type has been previously established. The graduate- and postgraduate-level students of Bangladeshi universities and postgraduate colleges are the main participants of the organization.<ref name=badhan/> The organization is active in 10 universities and 19 university colleges.<ref name=website/>

Other activities of the organisation include vaccination clinics, and helping with organization in times of natural disasters.<ref name=website/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.univdhaka.edu/cocuricular.php#|title=University of Dhaka: Co-curricular activities}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

Financing comes primarily from individual members and ex-members, as well as from the universities and colleges, from donations, and from funded vaccination clinics.<ref name=website/> The [[California]] [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] SpaandanB has been a significant contributor from outside Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaandanb.org/projects/badhan/badhan1.html#3|title=SpaandanB project: Badhan Blood Transfusion Centre}}</ref>
