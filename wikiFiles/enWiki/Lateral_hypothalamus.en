The '''lateral hypothalamus''' or '''lateral hypothalamic area''' is a part of the [[hypothalamus]]. 

It is concerned with [[hunger]]. Damage to this area can cause reduced food intake. Stimulating the lateral hypothalamus causes a desire to eat, while stimulating the [[ventromedial hypothalamus]] causes a desire to stop eating.  

== Function ==
The [[glucostatic]] explanation is based on the homeostatic theory which indicates that the body has balanced states of equilibrium for each system. When out of balance, the body will be pushed to restore balance. Therefore, when the blood sugar level drops, the glucostatic [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] in the blood take a message to the lateral hypothalamus, which is the feeding center of the [[brain]]. This causes certain [[neurons]] in the brain to fire in unison, creating the sensation of hunger. Now the person wants to eat. 

When the [[glucose]] level increases because the person is eating or has eaten, the glucostatic receptors in the blood then send a message to the [[Ventro-medial Hypothalamus]] (the satiety or satisfaction center) and the sensation of fullness occurs.

Damage to the lateral hypothalamus may lead to a condition known as [[Fr√∂lich's syndrome]].

==Lateral zone of hypothalamus==
The "lateral zone of hypothalamus" is a similarly named compound structure, consisting of the following two structures:<ref>{{BrainInfo|ancil|316}}</ref> 
* lateral hypothalamic area
* lateral [[preoptic nucleus]]
