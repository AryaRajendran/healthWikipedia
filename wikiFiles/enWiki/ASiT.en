The '''[http://www.asit.org Association of Surgeons in Training]''' ('''ASiT''') is an independent professional body and registered charity working to promote excellence in surgical training. It represents over 2,000 surgical trainees from all ten surgical specialities at both regional and national levels in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

Founded in 1976 as a forum for [[Senior Registrar]]s to meet socially and discuss issues around training, ASiT has grown substantially and continues to fulfil those objectives. ASiT has a voice on the Councils of the [[Royal Surgical Colleges]] in the United Kingdom and the Specialist Advisory Committees, in addition to many other Department of Health and [[National Health Service|NHS]] groups. ASiT collects input from both training organizations and the trainees, and works to improve communications between these groups whilst promoting excellence in surgical training. The organisation publishes recommendations for developing and improving surgical training, including the role of simulation.<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.05.005 Milburn J, Khera G, Hornby ST, Malone P, Fitzgerald JEF.
