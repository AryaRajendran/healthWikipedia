'''Trichorrhexis nodosa''' is a defect in the [[hair]] shaft characterized by thickening or weak points (nodes) that cause the hair to break off easily.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|766}}<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref>{{rp|636}} This group of conditions contributes to the appearance of [[hair loss]], lack of growth, and damaged-looking hair.

==Causes, incidence, and risk factors==
Trichorrhexis may have a [[genetics|genetic]] basis but appears to be precipitated by [[natural environment|environment]]al factors. Among Caucasians the defect often appears at the ends of the hair shaft with splitting of the ends, thinning and whitish discoloration.

These conditions are directly related to environmental causes such as "[[perm (hairstyle)|perming]]", [[blowdryer|blow drying]], aggressive [[hairbrush|hair brushing]], and excessive chemical exposure.

In some cases, trichorrhexis nodosa may be caused by an underlying disorder such as [[argininosuccinic aciduria]], [[Menkes disease|Menkes' kinky hair syndrome]], [[Netherton's syndrome]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[argininosuccinic lyase deficiency]] or [[trichothiodystrophy]].

==Symptoms==
* lack of apparent hair growth
* hair appears patchy
* hair breaks easily close to scalp
* hair may have thickenings or nodes in the shaft
* ends of hair thinned or [[Trichoptilosis|split]]
* whitish discoloration of hair tips
* hair breaks easily at tips

==Signs and tests==
Examination of the hair shafts with a microscope may reveal changes of trichorrhexis nodosa.

==Treatment==
Improving environmental factors will reduce damage to the hair. Gentle brushing with a soft brush should replace more aggressive brushing, ratting, or other procedures. Harsh chemicals such as [[hair straightening]] compounds and permanents should be avoided. The hair should not be ironed. Excessively harsh [[shampoo]] should be avoided. [[Hair conditioners]] should be used.

==Prognosis==
This condition is self-limiting. Improvements in grooming techniques and in environmental conditions will correct the abnormality.

==Complications==
This condition is not dangerous but may affect [[self-esteem]].
