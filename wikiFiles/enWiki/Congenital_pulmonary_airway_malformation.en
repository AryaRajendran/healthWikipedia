'''Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM)''' is a [[hamartomatous]] lesion of the lung, with an incidence of about 1 in 5,000 live births. It can be separated into five types, based on clinical and pathologic features.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/65ESBMCwn Nihal Kilin√ß et al, "Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation: Case Report". ''Perinatal Journal'', vol. 15, issue 1 (April 2007)]</ref> CPAM type 1 is the most common, with large [[cyst]]s and a good prognosis.  CPAM type 2 (with medium-sized cysts) often has a poor prognosis, owing to its frequent association with other significant anomalies. Other types are rare.<ref>Robbins and Cotran, ''Pathologic Basis of Disease'' 7th ed.
