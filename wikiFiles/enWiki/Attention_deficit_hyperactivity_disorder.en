Often people refer to ADHD-PI as "attention deficit disorder" (ADD), however, the latter has not been officially accepted since the 1994 revision of the DSM. ADHD impacts school-aged children and results in restlessness, acting impulsively, and lack of focus which impairs their ability to learn properly.

<!--Management  -->
[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder management|ADHD management]] usually involves some combination of medications, [[behavior therapy]], lifestyle changes, and counseling. Only children with severe ADHD symptoms should be considered for medication as a first-line treatment option.

The symptom categories yield three potential classifications of ADHD—predominantly inattentive type, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, or combined type if criteria for both subtypes are met:<ref name = Ramsay4>{{cite book|author=Ramsay, J. Russell |title=Cognitive behavioral therapy for adult ADHD|publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |isbn=0-415-95501-7 |page=4}}</ref>

Predominantly inattentive type symptoms as listed by the U.S. [[National Institute of Mental Health]] may include:<ref name="NIMH1">{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/complete-index.shtml |title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) |author=National Institute of Mental Health |authorlink=National Institute of Mental Health |year=2008 |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |location=USA }}</ref>

* Be easily distracted, miss details, forget things, and frequently switch from one activity to another
* Have difficulty maintaining focus on one task
* Become bored with a task after only a few minutes, unless doing something enjoyable
* Have difficulty focusing attention on organizing and completing a task or learning something new or trouble completing or turning in homework assignments, often losing things (e.g., pencils, toys, assignments) needed to complete tasks or activities
* Not seem to listen when spoken to
* Daydream, become easily confused, and move slowly
* Have difficulty processing information as quickly and accurately as others
* Struggle to follow instructions.

Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type symptoms may include:<ref name="NIMH1"/>

* Fidget and squirm in their seats
* Talk nonstop
* Dash around, touching or playing with anything and everything in sight
* Have trouble sitting still during dinner, school, and story time
* Be constantly in motion
* Have difficulty doing quiet tasks or activities

and also these manifestations primarily of impulsivity:<ref name="NIMH1"/>

* Be very impatient
* Blurt out inappropriate comments, show their emotions without restraint, and act without regard for consequences
* Have difficulty waiting for things they want or waiting their turns in games

Most people exhibit some of these behaviors, but not to the degree where such behaviors significantly interfere with a person's work, relationships, or studies—and in the absence of significant interference or impairment, a diagnosis of ADHD is normally not appropriate. The core impairments are consistent even in different cultural contexts.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=ADHD-Type Behavior and Harmful Dysfunction in Childhood: A Cross-Cultural Model|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2000|first=Alexandra|last=Brewis|volume=102|issue=4|page=826|id= |doi= 10.1525/aa.2000.102.4.823|last2=Schmidt|first2=Karen L.|last3=Meyer|first3=Mary }}</ref>

Some children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD have an increased risk of experiencing difficulties with [[social skills]], such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience rejection by their peers compared to 10-15 percent of non-ADHD children and adolescents. Training in social skills, behavioural modification and medication may have some limited beneficial effects. The most important factor in reducing emergence of later psychopathology, such as [[major depression]], [[criminality]], school failure, and [[substance use disorder]]s is formation of friendships with people who are not involved in delinquent activities.<ref name="pmid20490677">{{cite journal |author=Mikami AY |title=The importance of friendship for youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=181–98 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20490677 |pmc=2921569 |doi=10.1007/s10567-010-0067-y }}</ref> Adolescents with ADHD are more likely to have difficulty making and keeping friends due to impairments in processing verbal and [[nonverbal language]].<ref name="pmid18822833">{{cite journal |author=Coleman WL |title=Social competence and friendship formation in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Adolesc Med State Art Rev |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=278–99, x |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18822833 }}</ref>

===Associated disorders===
Inattention and hyperactive behavior are not necessarily the only problems in children with ADHD. ADHD exists alone in only about 1/3 of the children diagnosed with it. The combination of ADHD with other conditions can greatly complicate diagnosis and treatment. Many co-existing conditions require other courses of treatment and should be diagnosed separately instead of being grouped in the ADHD diagnosis.

Some of the associated conditions are:

{{See also|Hunter vs. farmer hypothesis}}
At more than 1 percent of the population, researchers have proposed that the high prevalence of ADHD may be due to [[natural selection]] having favoured ADHD, possibly because the individual traits may be beneficial on their own, and only become dysfunctional when these traits combine to form ADHD.<ref name="pmid20200842">{{cite journal |author=Cardo E, Nevot A, Redondo M, ''et al.'' |title=El déficit de atención desorganiza e hiperactividad: ¿un modelo de evolución? |trans_title=Attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity: a pattern of evolution? |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Rev Neurol |volume=50 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=S143–7 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20200842 }}</ref> The high prevalence of ADHD may in part be because women in general are more attracted to males who are risk takers, thereby promoting ADHD in the [[gene pool]].<ref name="pmid=16849269"/>

Further evidence that hyperactivity might be evolutionarily beneficial was put forth in a 2006 study finding that it may carry specific benefits for certain forms of society. In these societies, those with ADHD are hypothesized to have been more proficient in tasks involving risk, competition, and/or unpredictable behavior (i.e. exploring new areas, finding new food sources, etc.), where these societies may have benefited from confining impulsive or unpredictable behavior to a small subgroup.

====Diet====
{{Main|Diet and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}
Concerns were first raised by [[Benjamin Feingold]], a paediatric allergist, that food colourings and additives may affect children's behaviour in 1973. There is evidence suggesting that some food colourings may make some children hyperactive. However, the evidence for a link between food colourings and hyperactive behaviour remains uncertain. The FDA interpreted the evidence as being inconclusive as to whether food colours caused hyperactivity or not. The FDA review of food colours has been criticised for only doing a very narrow investigation into food colourings and their possible association with causing hyperactivity instead of investigating their possible effect on neurobehaviour in general.<ref name="Weiss-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weiss | first1 = B. | title = Synthetic food colours and neurobehavioral hazards: the view from environmental health research. | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 120 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | month = Jan | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.1103827 | PMID = 21926033 }}</ref> It is possible that certain food colourings act as a trigger for ADHD symptoms in subgroup of children who have a genetic vulnerability.

Previously it was thought that the elevated number of dopamine transporters seen in ADHD patients was part of the pathophysiology of ADHD but it now appears that the reason for elevated striatal dopamine transporter density in ADHD individuals is due to neuroadaptations occurring due to the continuous exposure to stimulants such as methylphenidate or dexamphetamine as the body tries to counter-act the effects of the stimulants by developing a tolerance to the stimulant medications.<ref name="pmid22294258">{{cite journal |author=Fusar-Poli P, Rubia K, Rossi G, Sartori G, Balottin U |title=Striatal dopamine transporter alterations in ADHD: pathophysiology or adaptation to psychostimulants?

Critics, such as Jonathan Leo and David Cohen, who reject the characterization of ADHD as a disorder, contend that the controls for stimulant medication usage were inadequate in some lobar volumetric studies, which makes it impossible to determine whether ADHD itself or [[psychotropic]] medication used to treat ADHD is responsible for the decreased thickness observed<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Longitudinal Mapping of Cortical Thickness and Clinical Outcome in Children and Adolescents With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=63 |pages=540–549 |year=2006 |pmid=16651511 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.5.540 |author1=Philip Shaw, MD |author2=Jason Lerch, PhD |author3=Deanna Greenstein, PhD |author4=Wendy Sharp, MSW |author5=Liv Clasen, PhD |author6=Alan Evans, PhD |author7=Jay Giedd, MD |author8=F.

==Diagnosis==
ADHD is diagnosed via a paediatric or psychiatric assessment of the person's childhood behavioural and cognitive development symptoms; this assessment includes ruling out the effects of drugs, medications and other medical or psychiatric disorders as possible explanations for the signs and symptoms.<ref name = NICE2008/>{{Rp|p.19–27|date=March 2013}}

In North America, the [[DSM-IV]] criteria are often the basis for a diagnosis, while European countries usually use the [[ICD-10]]. If the DSM-IV criteria are used, rather than the ICD-10, a diagnosis of ADHD is 3–4 times more likely.<ref name="Singh I 2008 957–64"/> Factors other than those within the DSM or ICD, however, have been found to affect the diagnosis in clinical practice. For example, the youngest children in a class are much more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD compared to their older counterparts in the same year. This is because these children may behave more hyperactively, not because they have ADHD, but because they are younger and developmentally behind their classmates. It is estimated that about 20 percent of children given a diagnosis of ADHD are misdiagnosed because of the month they were born.<ref name="Elder-2010">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Elder | first1 = TE. | title = The importance of relative standards in ADHD diagnoses: evidence based on exact birth dates. | journal = J Health Econ | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 641–56 | month = Sep | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2010.06.003 | PMID = 20638739 |pmc=2933294}}</ref>

The previously used term ''ADD'' expired with the most recent revision of the DSM. As a consequence, ADHD is the current nomenclature used to describe the disorder as one distinct disorder that can manifest itself as being a primary deficit resulting in hyperactivity/impulsivity (ADHD, predominantely hyperactive-impulsive type) or inattention (ADHD, predominantely inattentive type) or both (ADHD combined type).<ref name=DSM-IV-TR/>

===Classification===
ADHD may be seen as one or more continuous traits found normally throughout the general population.<ref name=NICE2008>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf |format=PDF|title=CG72 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): full guideline |publisher=NHS |author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|authorlink=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |date=24 September 2008 }}</ref> It is a [[developmental disorder]] in which certain traits such as [[impulse control]] lag in development. Using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] of the prefrontal cortex, this developmental lag has been estimated to range from 3 to 5 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071112172200.htm |title=Brain Matures A Few Years Late In ADHD, But Follows Normal Pattern |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090429032715/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071112172200.htm|archivedate= 29 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  However, the definition of ADHD is based on behaviour and it does not imply a neurological disease.<ref name=NICE2008/> ADHD is classified as a [[Disruptive Behavior Disorders|disruptive behavior disorder]] along with [[oppositional defiant disorder]], [[conduct disorder]] and [[antisocial personality disorder]].<ref name=autogenerated10>{{Cite book|author=Wiener, Jerry M., Editor |title=Textbook Of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2003|isbn=1-58562-057-2 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIgGKcp0SpkC |oclc= }}</ref>

The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) classifies ADHD according to the predominance of symptoms of:
# ''[[ADHD predominantly inattentive|Inattention]]'';
# ''[[Hyperactivity]]–[[impulsivity]]'';
# or a combination of both (''Combined type'').<ref name=DSM-IV-TR>{{cite book |author= |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2000|pages=|isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

This subdivision is based on presence of at least six out of nine long-term maladaptive symptoms (lasting at least 6 months) of either inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity, or both. Thus, a child who is diagnosed with the inattention subtype may also show signs of hyperactivity–impulsivity, and ''vice-versa''. To be considered, the symptoms must have appeared before the age of 6, manifest in more than one environment (e.g. at home and at school or work), and not be better explained by another mental disorder.<ref name=DSM-IV-TR/>

Most children with ADHD have the combined type. Children with the inattention subtype are less likely to act out or have difficulties getting along with other children. They may sit quietly, but without paying attention to what they are doing. Therefore, the child may be overlooked, and parents and teachers may not notice symptoms of ADHD.<ref name=DSM-IV-TR/>

===DSM-IV===
As with many other psychiatric and medical disorders, the formal diagnosis is made by a qualified professional in the field based on a set number of criteria. In the USA these criteria are laid down by the American Psychiatric Association in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ([[DSM-IV]]), 4th edition. Based on the DSM-IV criteria listed below, three types of ADHD are classified:<ref name="pmid21991721"/>

# ADHD, Combined Type is a combination of the two other ADHD subtypes.<ref name="pmid21991721"/>
# [[ADHD predominantly inattentive|ADHD Predominantly Inattentive]] Type presents with symptoms including being easily distracted, forgetful, daydreaming, disorganisation, poor concentration, and difficulty completing tasks.<ref name="pmid21991721"/>
# ADHD, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type presents with excessive fidgetiness and restlessness, hyperactivity, difficulty waiting and remaining seated, immature behaviour; destructive behaviors may also be present.<ref name="pmid21991721"/>

For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made the signs must not be due to the course of a Pervasive Developmental Disorder, [[Schizophrenia]], or other Psychotic Disorder. The signs are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (such as [[Mood Disorder]], [[Anxiety Disorder]], [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]], or a [[Personality Disorder]]).<ref name=DSM-IV-TR/>

===ICD-10===
In the tenth edition of the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (ICD-10) the signs of ADHD are given the name "[[Hyperkinesis|hyperkinetic disorders]]". When a [[conduct disorder]] (as defined by ICD-10<ref name=ICD10>{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) Version for 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=World Health Organisation }}</ref>) is present, the condition is referred to as "hperkinetic conduct disorder". Otherwise the disorder is classified as "disturbance of activity and attention", "other hyperkinetic disorders" or "hyperkinetic disorders, unspecified".  The latter is sometimes referred to as, "hyperkinetic syndrome".<ref name=ICD10/>

===Other guidelines===
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]' [[Guideline (medical)|clinical practice guideline]] for children with ADHD emphasizes that a reliable diagnosis is dependent upon the fulfillment of three criteria:<ref name=AAP2001>{{Cite journal|author=American Academy of Pediatrics. Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Committee on Quality Improvement |title=Clinical practice guideline: treatment of the school-aged child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Pediatrics |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=1033–44 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11581465 |doi=10.1542/peds.108.4.1033 }}</ref>

* The use of explicit criteria for the diagnosis using the [[DSM-IV-TR]].
* The importance of obtaining information about the child's signs in more than one setting.
* The search for coexisting conditions that may make the diagnosis more difficult or complicate treatment planning.

All three criteria are determined using the patient's history given by the parents, teachers and/or the patient.

Adults often continue to be impaired by ADHD. Adults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria, including the stipulation that their signs must have been present prior to the age of seven. Questioning parents or guardians as to how the person behaved and developed as a child also forms part of the clinical assessment of the individual; a family history of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis of adult ADHD due the strong heritability of ADHD.<ref name="Kooij-2010">{{Cite journal |last1=Kooij |first1=SJ. |last2=Bejerot |first2=S. |last3=Blackwell |first3=A. |last4=Caci |first4=H. |last5=Casas-Brugué |first5=M. |last6=Carpentier |first6=PJ. |last7=Edvinsson |first7=D. |last8=Fayyad |first8=J. |last9=Foeken |first9=K. |title=European consensus statement on diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD: The European Network Adult ADHD |url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2942810/ |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=10 |pages=67 |year=2010 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-10-67 |PMID=20815868 |displayauthors=9}}</ref> While the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in children and adults they often present differently in adults than in children, for example excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults.<ref name="Kooij-2010"/>

The [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] (AACAP) considers it necessary that the following be present before attaching the label of ADHD to a child:<ref name=AACAP>{{cite web |url=http://www.aacap.org/cs/adhd_a_guide_for_families/what_is_adhd |title=ADHD&nbsp;– A Guide for Families |year=2010 |publisher=American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry |location=USA }}</ref>
*The behaviors must appear before age 7.
*They must continue for at least six months.
*The symptoms must also create a real handicap in at least two of the following areas of the child's life:
**in the classroom,
**on the playground,
**at home,
**in the community, or
**in social settings.

If a child seems too active on the playground but not elsewhere, the problem might not be ADHD. It might also not be ADHD if the behaviors occur in the classroom but nowhere else. A child who shows some symptoms would not be diagnosed with ADHD if his or her schoolwork or friendships are not impaired by the behaviors.<ref name=AACAP/>

===Differential===
To make the diagnosis of ADHD, a number of other possible medical and psychological conditions must be considered. Medical conditions that must be excluded as causing the ADHD symptoms include: [[hypothyroidism]], [[anemia]], [[lead poisoning]], [[chronic illness]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] or [[Visual perception|vision]] impairment, [[substance abuse]], [[Adverse effect (medicine)|medication side-effects]], [[sleep disorder]]s and [[child abuse]],<ref name=smfttadhdebp/><ref name="pmid11563573">{{Cite journal|author=Smucker WD, Hedayat M |title=Evaluation and treatment of ADHD |journal=American Family Physician |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=817–29 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11563573 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20010901/817.html}}</ref> among others.

Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively and may display sensation seeking behaviour and be short-tempered. Addictive behaviour such as substance abuse and gambling are also very common in adult ADHD individuals. The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria has been criticised for not being developmentally appropriate for adults with ADHD as these impairments present differently to children thus leading to claims that adults are outgoing the diagnostic criteria rather than the ADHD disorder itself and thus are not being properly diagnosed.<ref name="Kooij-2010"/>

===High IQ children===
There has been controversy as to whether children and adolescents with ADHD and a high IQ have significant impairments.<ref name=Ant2008/> Evidence supports an increased likelihood of repeating grades and more social and functional impairments; more than half require additional academic support compared to children without ADHD. Additionally, more than half of high IQ ADHD people experience [[major depressive disorder]] or [[oppositional defiant disorder]] at some point in their lives. [[Generalised anxiety disorder]], [[separation anxiety disorder]] and [[social phobia]] is also more common. There is some evidence that high IQ ADHD individuals are not at an increased risk of substance abuse and [[conduct disorder]] compared to low and average IQ ADHD young people. High IQ children and adolescents with ADHD can have their high intelligence level missed when standard testing is performed; high IQ ADHD people tend to require more comprehensive testing to detect their true intelligence level.<ref name=Ant2008>{{cite journal |author=Antshel, KM |title=Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in the context of a high intellectual quotient/giftedness |journal=Dev Disabil Res Rev |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=293–9 |year=2008 |pmid=19072757 |doi=10.1002/ddrr.34 }}</ref> High IQ ADHD children have a unique neuropsychological profile which typically shows a gap of 20 points or more between the verbal IQ and the performance IQ when tested on the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]]; high IQ children without ADHD do not usually present with this sizable gap.<ref name="pmid21977044">{{cite journal |author=Vaivre-Douret L |title=Developmental and cognitive characteristics of "high-level potentialities" (highly gifted) children |journal=Int J Pediatr |volume=2011 |issue= |pages=420297 |year=2011 |pmid=21977044 |pmc=3184407 |doi=10.1155/2011/420297 |url=}}</ref>
