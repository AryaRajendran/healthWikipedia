'''Tuberculosis''', '''MTB''', or '''TB''' (short for ''tubercle [[Bacillus (shape)|bacillus]]'') is a common, and in many cases lethal, [[infectious disease]] caused by various strains of [[mycobacterium|mycobacteria]], usually ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book |author=Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N, Mitchell RN |year=2007 |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |edition=8th |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |pages=516–522 |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1}}</ref> Tuberculosis typically attacks the [[lung]]s, but can also affect other parts of the body. It is spread through the air when people who have an active TB infection cough, sneeze, or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air.<ref name=AP>{{cite journal|author=Konstantinos A |year=2010|title=Testing for tuberculosis |journal=Australian Prescriber |volume= 33 |issue=1 |pages=12–18 |url= http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/1/12/18/}}</ref> Most infections are [[asymptomatic]] and latent, but about one in ten latent infections eventually progresses to active disease which, if left untreated, kills more than 50% of those so infected.

The classic symptoms of active TB infection are a [[cough|chronic cough]] with [[hemoptysis|blood-tinged]] [[sputum]], [[fever]], [[night sweats]], and [[weight loss]] (the latter giving rise to the formerly prevalent term "consumption"). Infection of other organs causes a wide range of symptoms. [[Medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] of active TB relies on [[tuberculosis radiology|radiology]] (commonly [[chest X-ray]]s), as well as microscopic examination and [[microbiological culture]] of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the [[Mantoux test|tuberculin skin test]] (TST) and/or blood tests. [[Tuberculosis treatment|Treatment]] is difficult and requires administration of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Social contacts are also screened and treated if necessary. [[Antibiotic resistance]] is a growing problem in [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) infections. Prevention relies on screening programs and [[vaccination]] with the [[bacillus Calmette-Guérin|bacillus Calmette–Guérin]] vaccine.

Tuberculosis is classified as one of the [[granuloma]]tous inflammatory diseases. [[Macrophage]]s, [[T cell|T lymphocytes]], [[B cell|B lymphocytes]], and [[fibroblast]]s are among the cells that aggregate to form [[granuloma]]s, with [[lymphocytes]] surrounding the infected macrophages. The granuloma prevents dissemination of the mycobacteria and provides a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death ([[necrosis]]) in the center of [[Tubercle (anatomy)|tubercles]]. To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed [[caseous]] [[necrosis]].<ref name=Grosset>{{cite journal |author=Grosset J |title=Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the Extracellular Compartment: an Underestimated Adversary |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=833–6 |year=2003|pmid = 12604509|doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.3.833-836.2003 |pmc=149338}}</ref>

In many people, the infection waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and [[fibrosis]].<ref name=Grosset/> Affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages [[bronchi]] and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, and so can spread the infection. Treatment with appropriate [[antibiotic]]s kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.<ref name=Grosset/>

A definitive diagnosis of TB is made by identifying ''M. tuberculosis'' in a clinical sample (e.g. [[sputum]], [[pus]], or a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[biopsy]]).

Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts primarily rely on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.<ref name=Lancet11/> The [[World Health Organization]] has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.<ref name=Lancet11/>

===Vaccines===
The only currently available [[vaccine]] as of 2011 is [[bacillus Calmette-Guérin|bacillus Calmette–Guérin]] (BCG) which, while it is effective against disseminated disease in childhood, confers inconsistent protection against contracting pulmonary TB.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McShane|first=H|title=Tuberculosis vaccines: beyond bacille Calmette–Guérin|journal=Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

==Management==
{{Main|Tuberculosis management}}
Treatment of TB uses [[antibiotics]] to kill the bacteria.

===New onset===
The recommended treatment of new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010, is six months of a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, isoniazid, [[pyrazinamide]] and [[ethambutol]] for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months.<ref name=Lancet11/> Where resistance to isoniazid is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative.<ref name=Lancet11/>

===Recurrent disease===
If tuberculosis recurs, testing to determine to which antibiotics it is sensitive is important before determining treatment.<ref name=Lancet11/> If [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|multiple drug-resistant TB]] (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24&nbsp;months is recommended.<ref name=Lancet11/>

===Medication resistance===
Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible TB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication.<ref name=OBrien>{{cite journal |author=O'Brien R |title=Drug-resistant tuberculosis: etiology, management and prevention |journal=Semin Respir Infect |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=104–12 |year=1994|pmid = 7973169}}</ref> Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs.

Progression from TB infection to overt TB disease occurs when the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply.

[[File:RobertKoch.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Dr. Robert Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacillus.]]

The bacillus causing tuberculosis, ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', was identified and described on 24 March 1882 by [[Robert Koch]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine]] in 1905 for this discovery.<ref>[[Nobel Foundation]]. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905.] Accessed 7 October 2006.</ref> Koch did not believe the bovine (cattle) and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the [[pasteurization]] process. Koch announced a [[glycerine]] extract of the tubercle bacilli as a "remedy" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it 'tuberculin'. While it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of presymptomatic tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Waddington K |title=To stamp out "So Terrible a Malady": bovine tuberculosis and tuberculin testing in Britain, 1890–1939 |journal=Med Hist |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=29–48 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14968644 |pmc=546294 |doi=10.1017/S0025727300007043 }}</ref>

Tuberculosis caused the most widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as an [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease of the urban poor. In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to "consumption". By 1918, one in six deaths in France was still caused by TB. After determining the disease was contagious in the 1880s, TB was put on a [[List of notifiable diseases|notifiable disease]] list in Britain, campaigns were started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were "encouraged" to enter [[sanatorium|sanatoria]] that resembled prisons (the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention).<ref name =sanatoria/> Whatever the (purported) benefits of the "fresh air" and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered died within five years (''circa'' 1916).<ref name =sanatoria/>

In 1946, the development of the antibiotic [[streptomycin]] made effective treatment and cure of TB a reality. Prior to the introduction of this drug, the only treatment (except sanatoria) was surgical intervention, including the "[[pneumothorax]] technique", which involved collapsing an infected lung to "rest" it and allow tuberculous lesions to heal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shields|first=Thomas|title=General thoracic surgery|year=2009|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-7982-1|pages=792|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=bVEEHmpU-1wC&pg=PA792|edition=7th}}</ref> The emergence of MDR-TB has again introduced surgery as an option within the generally accepted standard of care in treating TB infections.
