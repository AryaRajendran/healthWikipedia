'''Male infertility''' refers to the inability of a male to achieve a [[pregnancy]] in a fertile female. In humans it accounts for 40-50% of [[infertility]].<ref name="titleMen's Health - Male Factor Infertility">{{cite web | url = http://healthcare.utah.edu/healthinfo/adult/men/infertil.htm | title = Men's Health - Male Factor Infertility | publisher =  University of Utah Health Sciences Center | date = 2003-04-01 | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | work = | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070704064049/http://healthcare.utah.edu/healthinfo/adult/men/infertil.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | archivedate = 2007-07-04}}</ref><ref name="pmid15049583">{{cite journal | author = Brugh VM, Lipshultz LI | title = Male factor infertility | journal = Medical Clinics of North America | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 367–85 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15049583 | doi = 10.1016/S0025-7125(03)00150-0 }}</ref><ref name="pmid14500443">{{cite journal | author = Hirsh A | title = Male subfertility | journal = BMJ | volume = 327 | issue = 7416 | pages = 669–72 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14500443 | pmc = 196399 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.327.7416.669 }}</ref> Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the [[semen]], and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.<ref name=who2010>{{cite journal | author = Cooper TG, Noonan E, Von Eckardstein S, Auger J, Baker HWG, Behre HM, Haugen TB, Kruger T, Wang C | title = World Health Organization reference values for human semen characteristics | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–45 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19934213 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmp048 }}</ref>

===Pre-testicular causes===
Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:
  
*[[Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] due to various causes
**[[Obesity]] increases the risk of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.<ref name = "Teerds_2011">{{cite journal | author = Teerds KJ, de Rooij DG, Keijer J | title = Functional relationship between obesity and male reproduction: from humans to animal models | journal = Hum.

* Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as [[chemotherapy]], [[anabolic steroids]], [[cimetidine]], [[spironolactone]]; those that decrease FSH levels such as [[phenytoin]]; those that decrease sperm motility such as [[sulfasalazine]] and [[nitrofurantoin]]
*Genetic abnormalities such as a [[Robertsonian translocation]]

====Tobacco smoking====
{{See also|Smoking and pregnancy}}
Male smokers also have approximately 30% higher odds of infertility.<ref name="urlwww.cdc.gov">{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/publications/factsheets/prevention/pdf/smoking.pdf | title = Preventing Smoking and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Before, During, and After Pregnancy | format = pdf | work = factsheet  | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) | accessdate = 2012-08-27 }}</ref> There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking kill sperm cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Agarwal A, Prabakaran SA, Said TM | title = Prevention of Oxidative Stress Injury to Sperm | journal = Journal of Andrology | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 654–60 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16291955 | doi = 10.2164/jandrol.05016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Robbins WA, Elashoff DA, Xun L, Jia J, Li N, Wu G, Wei F | title = Effect of lifestyle exposures on sperm aneuploidy | journal = Cytogenetic and Genome Research | volume = 111 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 371–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16192719 | doi = 10.1159/000086914 }}</ref> Therefore, some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets. Smoking tobacco increases intake of cadmium, because the tobacco plant absorbs the metal. Cadmium, being chemically similar to zinc, may replace zinc in the DNA polymerase, which plays a critical role in sperm production. Zinc replaced by cadmium in DNA polymerase can be particularly damaging to the testes.<ref name="isbn0-19-850340-7">{{cite book | author = Emsley J | title = Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2001 | page = 76 | isbn = 0-19-850340-7 }}</ref>

====DNA damage====
Common inherited variants in genes that encode enzymes employed in DNA mismatch repair are associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility.<ref>Ji G, Long Y, Zhou Y, Huang C, Gu A, Wang X (2012). Common variants in mismatch repair genes associated with increased risk of sperm DNA damage and male infertility. BMC Med 10:49. doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-10-49. PMID:  22594646</ref>   As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage.<ref>Silva LF, Oliveira JB, Petersen CG, Mauri AL, Massaro FC, Cavagna M, Baruffi RL, Franco JG Jr (2012). The effects of male age on sperm analysis by motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME). Reprod Biol Endocrinol 10:19. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-10-19. PMID: 22429861</ref> (Silva et al., 2012).  These findings suggest that DNA damage is an important factor in male infertility.

===Testicular factors===
Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produce semen of low quantity and/or poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:

*Age{{See also|Paternal age effect}}
*Genetic defects on the [[Y chromosome]]
** [[Y chromosome microdeletion]]s
*Abnormal set of chromosomes
** [[Klinefelter syndrome]]
*[[Neoplasm]], e.g. [[seminoma]]
*[[Idiopathic]] failure
*[[Cryptorchidism]]
*[[Varicocele]] (14% in one study)<ref name="title">{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_causes_of_male_infertility_000067_4.htm |title=Infertility in men |accessdate=2007-11-21 |work=}}</ref><ref name="pmid11744480">{{cite journal | author = Costabile RA, Spevak M | title = Characterization of patients presenting with male factor infertility in an equal access, no cost medical system | journal = Urology | volume = 58 | issue = 6 | pages = 1021–4 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11744480 | doi = 10.1016/S0090-4295(01)01400-5 }}</ref>

[[Radiation therapy]] to a testis decreases its function, but infertility can efficiently be avoided by avoiding radiation to both testes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gutfeld O, Wygoda M, Shavit L, Grenader T | title = Fertility After Adjuvant External Beam Radiotherapy for Stage I Seminoma | journal = The Internet Journal of Oncology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages =  | year = 2007 | pmid =  | doi = 10.5580/2188 }}</ref>

===Post-testicular causes===
Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in [[ejaculation]]: 

*[[Vas deferens]] obstruction
*Lack of [[Vas deferens]], often related to genetic markers for [[Cystic Fibrosis]]
*[[Infection]], e.g. [[prostatitis]]
*[[Retrograde ejaculation]]
*[[Ejaculatory duct obstruction]]
*[[Hypospadias]]
*[[Impotence]]

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician, preferably a specialist with experience or who specializes in male infertility. Typically two separate [[semen analysis|semen analyses]] will be required. The provider may order blood tests to look for hormone imbalances, medical conditions, or genetic issues.

===Medical history===
The history should include prior testicular  or penile insults ([[Testicular torsion|torsion]], [[cryptorchidism]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]]), [[infections]] ([[mumps]] [[orchitis]], [[epididymitis]]), environmental factors (excessive heat, [[radiation]], medications, and drug use ([[anabolic steroids]], [[alcohol]], [[smoking]]). 

Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of [[lubricant]]s, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important. 

Loss of [[libido]] and [[headaches]] or [[visual disturbances]] may indicate a [[pituitary tumor]]. 

The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), [[diabetic neuropathy]] ([[retrograde ejaculation]]), radical pelvic or [[retroperitoneal]] surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or [[hernia repair]] (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).

A [[family history]] may reveal genetic problems.

===Physical examination===
Usually, the patient disrobes completely and puts on a gown.   The physician will perform a thorough examination of the penis, scrotum, testicles, anus and rectum.

===Sperm sample===

{{Main|Semen analysis}}
{{Further|Semen quality}}
The volume of the semen sample, approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured.  This is the most common type of fertility testing.<ref name="pmid3697634">{{cite journal | author = Hargreave TB, McGowan B, Harvey J, McParland M, Elton RA | title = Is a male infertility clinic of any use? | journal = Br. J. Urol. | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 188–93 | year = 1986 | month = April | pmid = 3697634 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid21243017">{{cite journal | author = Hwang K, Walters RC, Lipshultz LI | title = Contemporary concepts in the evaluation and management of male infertility | journal = Nat. Rev. Urol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–94 | year = 2011 | month = February | pmid = 21243017 | doi = 10.1038/nrurol.2010.230 }}</ref>
Semen deficiencies are often labeled as follows:
*[[Oligospermia|'''Oligo'''spermia]] or [[Oligozoospermia|'''Oligozoo'''spermia]] - decreased number of spermatozoa in semen
*[[Aspermia|'''A'''spermia]] - complete lack of semen
*[[Hypospermia|'''Hypo'''spermia]] - reduced seminal volume
*[[Azoospermia|'''Azoo'''spermia]] - absence of sperm cells in semen
*[[Teratospermia|'''Terato'''spermia]] - increase in sperm with abnormal morphology
*[[Asthenozoospermia|'''Asthenozoo'''spermia]] - reduced sperm motility
There are various combinations of these as well, e.g. ''Teratoasthenozoospermia'', which is reduced sperm morphology and motility.
Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia" or "oligospermia" can be used as a [[catch-all]].

===Blood sample===

Common hormonal test include determination of [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] and [[testosterone]] levels. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. [[Klinefelter syndrome]], a [[Y chromosome microdeletion]], or [[cystic fibrosis]].

==Prevention==
Some strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:
* Avoiding [[smoking]]<ref name="pmid17304390">{{cite journal | author = Gaur DS, Talekar M, Pathak VP | title = Effect of cigarette smoking on semen quality of infertile men | journal = Singapore Medical Journal | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–23 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17304390 | doi =  | url = http://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4802/4802a2.pdf }}</ref> as it damages sperm DNA
* Avoiding heavy [[marijuana]] and [[alcohol]] use.<ref name=speroff>{{cite book |author=Speroff L, Glass RH, Kase NG |title=Clinical Endocrinology and Infertility |edition=6th |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |year=1999 |page=1085 |isbn=0-683-30379-1}}</ref>
* Avoiding excessive heat to the testes.<ref name=speroff/>
* Sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity<ref name=speroff/> and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more).<ref name=speroff/>
* When participating in contact sports, wear an [[Protective Cup]] and [[Jockstrap]] to protect the testicles.  Sports such as [[Baseball]], [[Football]], [[Cricket]], [[Lacrosse]], [[Hockey]], [[Softball]], [[Paintball]], [[Rodeo]], [[Motorcross]], [[Wrestling]], [[Soccer]], [[Karate]] or other [[Martial Arts]] or any sport where a ball, foot, arm, knee or bat can come into contact with the groin.

==Treatment==
Treatments vary according to the underlying disease and the degree of the impairment of the male fertility. Further, in an infertility situation, the fertility of the female needs to be considered.

Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions. 

Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for [[intrauterine insemination]] (IUI), [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF), or IVF with [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|intracytoplasmatic sperm injection]] (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved.

Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF. 

The [[off-label use]] of [[Clomiphene citrate]], an anti-estrogen drug designed as a fertility medicine for women, is controversial.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pasqualotto FF, Fonseca GP, Pasqualotto EB | title = Azoospermia after treatment with clomiphene citrate in patients with oligospermia | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 90 | issue = 5 | pages =  | year = 2008 | pmid = 18555230 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.03.036 }}</ref> [[Vitamin E]] helps counter oxidative stress,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Traber MG, Stevens JF | title = Vitamins C and E: Beneficial effects from a mechanistic perspective | journal = Free Radical Biology and Medicine | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 1000–13 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21664268 | pmc = 3156342 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.05.017 }}</ref> which is associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lombardo F, Sansone A, Romanelli F, Paoli D, Gandini L, Lenzi A | title = The role of antioxidant therapy in the treatment of male infertility: An overview | journal = Asian Journal of Andrology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 690–7 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21685925 | doi = 10.1038/aja.2010.183 }}</ref> A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ghanem H, Shaeer O, El-Segini A | title = Combination clomiphene citrate and antioxidant therapy for idiopathic male infertility: A randomized controlled trial | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 7 | pages = 2232–5 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19268928 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.01.117 }}</ref>
