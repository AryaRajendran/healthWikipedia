In the [[human body]], the '''adductor longus''' is a [[skeletal muscle]] located in the [[thigh]].  One of the [[adductor muscles of the hip]], its main function is to [[Adduction|adduct]] the thigh and it is innervated by the [[obturator nerve]].  It forms the medial wall of the [[femoral triangle]].

==Origin and insertion==
The adductor longus arises from the [[Superior pubic ramus|superior ramus of the pubis]].

It lies ventrally on the [[adductor magnus]], and near the femur, the [[adductor brevis]] is interposed between these two muscles.  Distally, the fibers of the adductor longus extend into the [[adductor canal]].<ref name="Platzer-242" />

It is inserted into the middle third of the medial lip of the ''[[linea aspera]]''.<ref name="Platzer-242" />

==Relations==
The adductor longus is in relation by its anterior surface with the pubic portion of the [[fascia lata]], and near its insertion with the [[femoral artery]] and [[Femoral vein|vein]].

By its posterior surface with the [[adductor brevis]] and [[Adductor magnus|magnus]], the anterior branches of the [[obturator artery]], [[obturator vein|vein]], and [[obturator nerve|nerves]], and near its insertion with the [[Profunda femoris artery|profunda artery]] and [[Profunda femoris vein|vein]].

By its outer border with the [[pectineus]], and by the inner border with the [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]].

==Actions==
Its main actions is to adduct and laterally rotate the femur; it can also produce some degree of flexion/anteversion.<ref name="Platzer-242" />

==Innervation==
As part of the medial compartment of the thigh, the adductor longus is innervated by the anterior division (sometimes the posterior division) of the [[obturator nerve]].<ref name="Platzer-242" /> The obturator nerve exits via the anterior rami of the [[spinal cord]] from L2, L3, and L4.<ref name="Saladin">Saladin, Kenneth S.

==Development==
Adductor longus is derived from the [[myotome]] of [[spinal root]]s L2, L3, and L4.<ref>{{cite book
