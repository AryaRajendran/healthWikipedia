'''Castleman's disease (giant or angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, lymphoid hamartoma, angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia)''' is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder that can involve single lymph node stations or
can be systemic. It must be distinguished from reactive lymph node hyperplasia
and malignancies.<ref name=pmid21934347>{{cite journal|last=Weng|first=Chien-Hsiang|coauthors=Joe-Bin Chen, John Wang, Cheng-Chung Wu, Yuan Yu, Tseng-Hsi Lin|title=Surgically Curable Non-Iron Deficiency Microcytic Anemia: Castleman’s Disease|journal=Onkologie|date=23|year=2011|month=August|volume=34|issue=8-9|pages=456–458|doi=10.1159/000331283|pmid=21934347|url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&ArtikelNr=000331283&Ausgabe=255572&ProduktNr=224106}}</ref> It is a very rare disorder characterized by non-cancerous growths (tumors) that may develop in the lymph node tissue at a single site or throughout the body. <ref name="pmid15941478">{{cite journal |author=Bucher P, Chassot G, Zufferey G, Ris F, Huber O, Morel P |title=Surgical management of abdominal and retroperitoneal Castleman's disease |journal=World J Surg Oncol |volume=3 |issue= |pages=33 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15941478 |pmc=1166581 |doi=10.1186/1477-7819-3-33 |url=http://www.wjso.com/content/3//33}}</ref> It involves  hyperproliferation of certain [[B cell]]s that often produce [[cytokine]]s.

There are several variants of Castleman's disease. 

In most of the cases, Castleman's disease is likely due to hypersecretion of the cytokine [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]],<ref name="pmid17766835">{{cite journal |author=Ahmed B, Tschen JA, Cohen PR, ''et al.'' |title=Cutaneous castleman's disease responds to anti interleukin-6 treatment |journal=Mol. Cancer Ther. |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=2386–90 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17766835 |doi=10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0256 |url=http://mct.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17766835}}</ref> but some patients may have normal IL-6 levels and present with non-iron-deficient microcytic anemia.<ref name=pmid21934347 />  

* In tumors that are positive for [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]] (KSHV), also called human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), this is most likely due to expression of the virus-encoded cytokine, vIL-6.<ref name="pmid11264189">{{cite journal |author=Aoki Y, Yarchoan R, Wyvill K, Okamoto  S, Little RF, Tosato G |title=Detection of viral interleukin-6 in Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-linked disorders |journal=Blood |volume=97 |issue=7 |pages=2173–6 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11264189 |doi= 10.1182/blood.V97.7.2173|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11264189}}</ref>
* KSHV negative tumors appear to be the result of over-secretion of human IL-6.

===Unicentric vs. multicentric===
'''Unicentric Castleman's disease''' involves tissue growths at only a single site. It usually has few or no symptoms other than those directly associated with the physical enlargement of the lymph node.  In 90% or more, removal of the enlarged node is curative, with no further complications. However, in 2011, Weng et al. described a patient with unicentric Castleman's disease, hyaline vascular type, presenting with severe chronic non-iron-deficient anemia. He suggested that in patients with normal IL-6 level may present with non-iron deficient type and may resolve after effective treatment of Castleman's disease.<ref name=pmid21934347 /> 

'''Multicentric Castleman's disease''' (MCD) involves growths at multiple sites.<ref name="pmid17803812">{{cite journal |author=Menezes BF, Morgan R, Azad M |title=Multicentric Castleman's disease: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=1 |issue= |pages=78 |year=2007 |pmid=17803812 |pmc=2014764 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-1-78 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/1//78}}</ref> About 50% is caused by KSHV, also called HHV-8, a gammaherpesvirus that is also the cause of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] and [[primary effusion lymphoma]], while the remainder of MCD are of unknown cause.   The form of MCD most closely associated with KSHV is the plasmacytic form of Castleman's disease while another pathologic form, the hyaline-vascular form, is generally negative for this virus.

==MCD Symptoms==
The most common 'B Symptoms' of MCD are high fevers, anemia, weight loss, loss of appetite, and low white blood cell counts, which may to be due to the overproduction of [[interleukin 6]]. Symptomatically, therefore, MCD can be difficult to diagnose and even in the case of a lymph-node biopsy a conclusive diagnosis remains problematic.

Castleman's is seen in [[POEMS syndrome]] and is implicated in 10% of cases of [[paraneoplastic pemphigus]].

===Unicentric===
In the Unicentric form of the disease, surgical [[Segmental resection|resection]] is often curative,<ref name=pmid21934347 /> <ref name="pmid18419976">{{cite journal |author=Talarico F, Negri L, Iusco D, Corazza GG |title=Unicentric Castleman's disease in peripancreatic tissue: case report and review of the literature |journal=G Chir |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=141–4 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18419976 |doi= |url=http://www.giornalechirurgia.it/index.php?PAGE=article&ID=2770}}</ref> and the prognosis is excellent.

===Multicentric===
There is no standard therapy for MCD at the moment.

It is important to distinguish AIDS-related Multicentric Castleman’s disease from other forms of Multicentric Castleman’s disease. Treatment for the former can be focused upon the same protocols used for treating the underlying AIDS.<ref name="pmid14760135">{{cite journal |author=Sprinz E, Jeffman M, Liedke P, Putten A, Schwartsmann G |title=Successful treatment of AIDS-related Castleman's disease following the administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) |journal=Ann. Oncol. |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=356–8 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14760135 |doi= 10.1093/annonc/mdh066|url=http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14760135}}</ref>

Prior to 1996 MCD carried a poor prognosis of about 2 years, due to [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] which may arise as a result of proliferation of infected cells.  The timing of diagnosis, with particular attention to the difficulty of determining the cause of B symptoms without a CT scan and lymph node biopsy, may impact significantly on the prognosis and risk of death. Left untreated, MCD usually gets worse and becomes increasingly difficult and unresponsive to current treatment regimens. 

Recent work with HIV-positive patients with KSHV-related MCD suggests that treatment with the antiherpesvirus drug [[ganciclovir]] or the antiCD20 B cell [[monoclonal antibody]], [[rituximab]], may markedly improve outcome. These drugs target and kill B cells via the B cell specific CD20 marker. Since B cells are required for the production of antibodies, the body's immune response is weakened whilst on treatment and the risk of further viral or bacterial infection is increased. Due to the uncommon nature of the condition there are not many large scale research studies from which standardized approaches to therapy may be drawn, and the extant case studies of individuals or small cohorts should be read with caution. As with many diseases, the patient's age, physical state and previous medical history with respect to infections may impact on the disease progression and outcome.

Use of [[tocilizumab]] has been proposed.<ref name="pmid17541233">{{cite journal |author=Matsuyama M, Suzuki T, Tsuboi H, ''et al.'' |title=Anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab) treatment of multicentric Castleman's disease |journal=Intern.
