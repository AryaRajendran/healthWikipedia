'''Interleukins''' are a group of [[cytokine]]s (secreted [[proteins]]/[[signaling molecules]]) that were first seen to be expressed by [[white blood cell]]s ([[leukocyte]]s).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brocker|first=C|coauthors=Thompson, D; Matsumoto, A; Nebert, DW; Vasiliou, V|title=Evolutionary divergence and functions of the human interleukin (IL) gene family.|journal=Human Genomics|year=2010|month=Oct|volume=5|issue=1|pages=30–55|pmid=21106488|url=http://www.humgenomics.com/content/5/1/30}}</ref>   The term ''interleukin'' derives from (''inter-'') "as a means of communication", and (''-leukin'') "deriving from the fact that many of these proteins are produced by leukocytes and act on leukocytes". The name is something of a relic, though (the term was coined by Dr. Vern Paetkau, [[University of Victoria]]); it has since been found that interleukins are produced by a wide variety of body cells. The function of the [[immune system]] depends in a large part on ''interleukins'', and [[rare disease|rare]] deficiencies of a number of them have been described, all featuring [[autoimmune disease]]s or [[immune deficiency]]. The majority of interleukins are synthesized by helper CD4 T lymphocytes, as well as through monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. They promote the development and differentiation of T, B, and hematopoietic cells.

Interleukin receptors on [[astrocytes]] in the [[hippocampus]] are also known to be involved in the development of spatial memories in mice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ben Menachem-Zidon|first=Ofra|coauthors=Avi Avital, Yair Ben-Menahem, Inbal Goshen, Tirzah Kreisel, Eli M.

[[Interleukin 15]] (IL-15) is a cytokine that possesses a variety of biological functions, including stimulation and maintenance of cellular immune responses.<ref name="PUB00009488">{{cite journal |author=Arena A, Merendino RA, Bonina L, Iannello D, Stassi G, Mastroeni P |title=Role of IL-15 on monocytic resistance to human herpesvirus 6 infection |journal=New Microbiol. |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=105–112 |year=2000 |pmid=10872679}}</ref> IL-15 stimulates the proliferation of T-lymphocytes, which requires interaction of IL-15 with components of IL-2R, including IL-2R beta and probably IL-2R gamma, but not IL-2R alpha.
