==Revolution in psychiatric education==
The Menninger School of Psychiatry and the local [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] Hospital represented the center of a psychiatric education revolution. The Clinic and the School became the hub for training professionals in the bio-psycho-social approach. This approach integrated the foundations of [[medicine|medical]], [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], developmental, and [[family]] systems to focus on the overall [[health]] of patients. For patients, this way of treatment attended to their physical, [[emotion]]al, and social needs.

Dr. [[Otto Fleischmann]], head of the psychoanalytic institute 1956 - 1963 was doing psychotherapy behind a one-way vision screen, in full view of all the students.

After the war, Dr. Will lead a national revolution to reform state [[sanatorium|sanitarium]]s.

Numerous independent organizations recognized the Menninger Foundation as a world leader in psychiatric and behavioral health treatment.

==Research==
The Menninger Clinic remains one of the primary North American settings supporting psychodynamically informed research on clinical diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. Recently, efforts have been organized around the construct of mentalizing, a concept integrating research activities related to attachment, theory of mind, internal representations, and neuroscience.

In the 1960s the Menninger Clinic studied [[Swami Rama]], a noted [[yogi]], specifically investigating his ability to exercise voluntary control of bodily processes (such as heartbeat) which are normally considered non-voluntary (autonomous) and also the famous  [[Yoga Nidra]].
