'''DIPEx''' is an [[Oxford, England]]-based health charity<ref name=cc-1087019>{{EW charity|1087019|DIPEX}}</ref> that works closely with the Health Experiences Research Group at [[University of Oxford]] to disseminate research into personal experiences of health and illness. The charity publishes two websites called '''Healthtalkonline'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Healthtalkonline |url=http://healthtalkonline.org |work=Healthtalkonline}}</ref> and '''Youthhealthtalk'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Youthhealthtalk |url=http://www.youthhealthtalk.org |work=Youthhealthtalk}}</ref> The websites feature clips of people talking about their experiences of living with a range of health conditions and are aimed at patients, their carers, family and friends, doctors, nurses and other health professionals.

== History ==
DIPEx was established in 2001 by [[General practitioner|GP]] Dr [[Ann McPherson]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] and Dr Andrew Herxheimer after their own experiences of illness. Ann had been diagnosed with breast cancer and although she knew all the medical information, couldn't find anyone else to talk to about the personal and emotional side of having the disease. This, and Herxheimer's experience of knee replacement surgery, prompted them to come up with the idea of a patient experience website. A small group of people from various backgrounds were asked to join a Steering Group and after many meetings around McPherson's kitchen table, the idea came into being with the help of Lion New Media (part of Lion Television).<ref>{{cite web|title= About Us|url=http://www.healthtalkonline.org/Overview/Organisation|work=Healthtalkonline}}</ref>
