An '''embryo''' is a [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[ploidy|diploid]] [[eukaryote]] in its earliest stage of [[Developmental biology|development]], from the time of first [[cell division]] until [[birth]], [[Egg (biology)|hatching]], or [[germination]]. In humans, it is called an embryo until about eight weeks after [[fertilisation|fertilization]] (i.e. ten weeks after the [[Gestational age|last menstrual period]] or LMP), and from then it is instead called a [[fetus]].

The development of the embryo is called [[embryogenesis]]. In [[organism]]s that [[sex|reproduce sexually]], once a [[spermatid|sperm]] fertilizes an [[ovum|egg cell]], the result is a [[cell (biology)|cell]] called the [[zygote]], which possesses half the [[DNA]] of each of its two parents. In [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and some [[protist]]s, the zygote will begin to divide by [[mitosis]] to produce a multicellular organism. The result of this process is an embryo.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in the mid-14c., the word ''embryon'' derives from [[Medieval Latin]] ''embryo'', itself from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔμβρυον}} (''embruon''), plural {{lang|grc|ἔμβρυα}} (''embrua''), lit. "young one",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruon ἔμβρυον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> which is the neuter of {{lang|grc|ἔμβρυος}} (''embruos''), lit. "growing in",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruos ἔμβρυος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> from ἐν (''en''), "in"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29n ἐν], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> + βρύω (''bruō''), "swell, be full";<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbru%2Fw βρύω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> the proper [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form of the Greek term would be ''embryum''.

==Animal embryos==
In animals, the development of the zygote into an embryo proceeds through specific recognizable stages of [[blastula]], [[gastrulation|gastrula]], and [[organogenesis]]. The blastula stage typically features a fluid-filled cavity, the [[blastocoele|blastocoel]], surrounded by a sphere or sheet of cells, also called [[blastomere]]s. The embryo of a [[eutheria|placental mammal]] is defined as the organism between the first [[cell division|division]] of the '''''[[zygote]]''''' (a fertilized [[ovum]]) until it becomes a '''[[fetus]]'''. An ovum is fertilized in a [[fallopian tube]] through which it travels into the uterus. In humans, the embryo is defined as the product of conception after it is implanted in the [[uterus]] wall through the eighth week of development. An embryo is called a fetus at a more advanced stage of development and up until [[childbirth|birth]] or hatching. In humans, this is from the eighth week of [[gestation]]. However, animals which develop in eggs outside the mother's body are usually referred to as embryos throughout development, e.g. one would refer to a [[bird|chick]] embryo, not a "chick fetus" even at late stages. 

During [[gastrulation]] the cells of the blastula undergo coordinated processes of cell division, invasion, and/or migration to form two ([[diploblasty|diploblastic]]) or three ([[triploblasty|triploblastic]]) tissue layers. In triploblastic organisms, the three [[germ layer]]s are called [[endoderm]], [[ectoderm]], and [[mesoderm]]. The position and arrangement of the germ layers are highly species-specific, however, depending on the type of embryo produced. In [[vertebrate]]s, a special population of embryonic cells called the [[neural crest]] has been proposed as a "fourth germ layer", and is thought to have been an important novelty in the evolution of head structures.

During organogenesis, molecular and cellular interactions between germ layers, combined with the cells' developmental potential, or [[competence (biology)|competence]] to respond, prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} For example, in [[neurogenesis]], a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], and [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]]. Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis, including [[angiogenesis]] (formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones), [[chondrogenesis]] (cartilage), [[myogenesis]] (muscle), [[osteogenesis]] (bone), and many others.

Generally, if a structure pre-dates another structure in evolutionary terms, then it often appears earlier than the second in an embryo; this general observation is sometimes summarized by the phrase "[[recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]".<ref>Gould, Stephen. [http://www.sjgarchive.org/library/ontogeny.html Ontogeny and Philogeny], p. 206 (1977): "recapitulation was not 'disproved'; it could not be, for too many well-established cases fit its expectations."</ref> For example, the backbone is a common structure among all vertebrates such as [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, and [[mammal]]s, and the backbone also appears as one of the earliest structures laid out in all vertebrate embryos. The [[cerebrum]] in humans, which is the most sophisticated part of the [[human brain|brain]], develops last. This sequencing rule is not absolute, but it is recognized as being partly applicable to development of the human embryo.

===Fossilised animal embryos===
{{Main|Fossil embryos}}
Fossilised animal embryos are known from the Precambrian, and are found in great numbers during the Cambrian period. Even fossilised dinosaur embryos have been discovered.

; Week 1–3 :5–7 days after fertilization, the blastocyst attaches to the wall of the uterus ([[endometrium]]). When it comes into contact with the endometrium it performs [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. Implantation connections between the mother and the embryo will begin to form, including the [[umbilical cord]]. The embryo's growth centers around an axis, which will become the spine and spinal cord. The brain, spinal cord, heart, and gastrointestinal tract begin to form.<ref name="facts">NIH Medical Encyclopedia http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm</ref>

; Week 4–5 :Chemicals produced by the embryo stop the woman's [[menstrual cycle]]. Neurogenesis is underway, showing brain activity at about the 6th week.<ref>Gazzaniga, Mike S.[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/books/chapters/0619-1st-gazza.html The Ethical Brain] "not until the end of week 5 and into week 6 (usually around forty to forty-three days) does the first electrical brain activity begin to occur. This activity, however, is not coherent activity of the kind that underlies human consciousness, or even the coherent activity seen in a shrimp's nervous system."</ref> The [[Embryonic heart|heart]] will begin to beat around the same time. Limb buds appear where arms and legs will grow later. Organogenesis begins. The head represents about one half of the embryo's axial length, and more than half of the embryo's [[mass]]. The brain develops into five areas. Tissue formation occurs that develops into the vertebra and some other bones. The heart starts to beat and blood starts to flow.<ref name="facts"/>

; Week 6–8 :[[Myogenesis]] and neurogenesis have progressed to where the embryo is capable of motion, and the eyes begin to form. Organogenesis and growth continue. Hair has started to form along with all essential organs. Facial features are beginning to develop. At the end of the 8th week, the embryonic stage is over, and the [[fetus|fetal]] stage begins.<ref name="facts"/>

===Miscarriage===
{{see also|Miscarriage}}
[[File:Human Embryo - Approximately 8 weeks estimated gestational age.jpg|right|thumb|A complete spontaneous abortion at about 6 weeks from [[fertilisation|conception]], i.e. 8 weeks from [[gestational age|LMP]]]]
Some embryos do not survive through to the fetal stage, which begins about two months after fertilization (10 weeks [[gestational age|LMP]]). Embryos may be aborted spontaneously or purposely.

Studies using very sensitive early pregnancy tests have found that 25% of embryos are aborted by the sixth week [[gestational age|LMP]] (since the woman's last menstrual period), even if a woman does not realize it.<ref name="implantation">{{cite journal | author=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | title=Time of implantation of the conceptus and loss of pregnancy. | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | volume=340 | issue=23 | pages=1796–1799 | year=1999 | pmid=10362823 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199906103402304}}</ref><ref name="epl">{{cite journal | author = Wang X, Chen C, Wang L, Chen D, Guang W, French J | title = Conception, early pregnancy loss, and time to clinical pregnancy: a population-based prospective study. | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 577–84 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12620443 | doi = 10.1016/S0015-0282(02)04694-0}}</ref> Abortions after the sixth week LMP happen in 8% of pregnancies.<ref name="epl" /> The risk of them is "virtually complete by the end of the [[embryonic period]]," with a rate of only two percent after 8.5 weeks LMP.<ref>Rodeck, Charles; Whittle, Martin.

===Induced abortion===
{{see also|Abortion}}
The majority of induced abortions occur during the embryonic period. For example, in England and Wales during 2006, 68% of them occurred by the end of the embryonic period.<ref>{{cite web |author=Department of Health |year=2007 |title=Abortion statistics, England and Wales: 2006 |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsStatistics/DH_075697 |quote=68% were at under 10 weeks |accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>

Induced (i.e. purposeful) abortion of an embryo may be accomplished by a variety of methods, including both pharmaceutical and surgical techniques. [[suction-aspiration abortion|Suction-aspiration]] is the most common surgical method of aborting an embryo within the United States.<ref>{{cite web |author=Healthwise |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 |title=Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion |year=2004 |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref>

Common reasons for purposely aborting an embryo include a desire to delay or end [[childbirth|childbearing]], concern over the interruption of [[employment|work]] or [[education]], issues of financial or relationship stability, perceived immaturity and health concerns.<ref name="bankole98">Bankole, Akinrinola, Singh, Susheela, & Haas, Taylor.

===Use in ART and diagnosis===
Embryos are used in various techniques of [[assisted reproductive technology]], such as [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[embryo donation]]. They may be subject to [[Cryopreservation#Embryos|embryo cryopreservation]] for later use if IVF procedures have resulted in more embryos than is currently needed. Some aspects, e.g. [[selective reduction]], are issues in the [[beginning of pregnancy controversy]].

[[Prenatal diagnosis]] or [[preimplantation diagnosis]] involves testing embryos for diseases or conditions.

===Viability===
Current medical technology does not allow an embryo to survive outside the [[uterus]] under any circumstances, or to be transplanted from the uterus of one woman to that of another.<ref>Rumbold, Graham. [http://books.google.com/books?id=D1vnFannII4C&pg=PA120&lpg=PA120&dq=%22transplant+an+embryo%22&source=bl&ots=PStu-wJiNZ&sig=IG0_0pennltbuMH457qMm9kuo9U&hl=en&ei=GRH1SbqsAZCaMqm10KkP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5 Ethics in nursing practice], p. 120 (Elsevier Health Sciences 1999).</ref> A human embryo is therefore not considered [[Viability (fetal)|viable]].

===Research===
Human embryos are being researched to determine their use in treating diseases. Their use in [[stem cell research]], [[reproductive cloning]], and [[germline engineering]] are currently being explored. The morality of this type of research is debated because an embryo is often used.<ref>Freedman, Jeri. "America Debates Stem Cell Research."

==Plant embryos==
{{further|Sporophyte}}
[[File:Ginkgo embryo and gametophyte.jpg|thumb|The inside of a ''[[Ginkgo]]'' seed, showing the embryo]]
In [[botany]], a [[seed plant]] ''embryo'' is part of a [[seed]], consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves, stem (see '''[[hypocotyl]]'''), and root (see '''[[radicle]]'''), as well as one or more '''[[cotyledon]]s'''. Once the embryo begins to [[germination|germinate]]&nbsp;— grow out from the seed&nbsp;— it is called a '''seedling''' (plantlet). Plants that do not produce seeds, but do produce an embryo, include the [[bryophyte]]s and [[fern]]s. In these plants, the embryo is a young plant that grows attached to a parental '''[[gametophyte]]'''.
