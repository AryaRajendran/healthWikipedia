Smallpox localized in small [[blood vessel]]s of the skin and in the mouth and throat. In the skin it resulted in a characteristic [[maculopapular rash]] and, later, raised fluid-filled [[blister]]s. ''V. major'' produces a more serious disease and has an overall [[mortality rate]] of 30–35%.

== Classification ==
There were two clinical forms of smallpox. Variola major was the severe and most common form, with a more extensive rash and higher fever. [[Alastrim|Variola minor]] was a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical death rates of 1% or less.<ref name=FactSheet>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp |title=CDC Smallpox |accessdate= 2007-12-26 |work=Smallpox Overview }}</ref> Subclinical ([[asymptomatic]]) infections with variola virus have been noted but were not common.<ref name= PinkBook/> In addition, a form called ''variola sine eruptione'' (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.<ref name= PinkBook/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Smallpox child.jpg|thumb|Child showing rash due to ordinary-type smallpox (variola major)]]
The [[incubation period]] between contraction and the first obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days. Once inhaled, variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the [[respiratory]] mucosa, migrates to regional [[lymph nodes]], and begins to multiply. In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, [[lysis]] of many infected cells occurs and the virus is found in the [[blood]]stream in large numbers (this is called ''[[viremia]]''), and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen, [[bone marrow]], and lymph nodes. The initial or prodromal symptoms are similar to other viral diseases such as [[influenza]] and the [[common cold]]: [[fever]] of at least {{convert|38.5|°C|°F|0}}, [[myalgia|muscle pain]], malaise, headache and [[prostration]]. As the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] is commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occur. The prodrome, or preeruptive stage, usually lasts 2–4 days. By days 12–15 the first visible lesions—small reddish spots called ''[[enanthem]]''—appear on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, [[palate]], and throat, and temperature falls to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts of virus into the [[saliva]].<ref name= AFIP/>

Smallpox virus preferentially attacks skin cells, causing the characteristic pimples (called [[macule]]s) associated with the disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear.<ref name= AFIP/> At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification:<ref>Rao, A. R. (1972). Smallpox. Bombay: Kothari Book Depot. {{Oclc|723806}}</ref> ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall [[fatality rate]] of about 30%; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.<ref name=eMedicine_Smallpox>{{cite web | author = Hogan CJ, Harchelroad F | title=CBRNE – Smallpox | work=eMedicine | url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic885.htm | accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

=== Ordinary ===
Ninety percent or more of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons are of the ordinary type.<ref name= PinkBook/> In this form of the disease, by the second day of the rash the macules become raised ''[[papule]]s''. By the third or fourth day the papules fill with an opalescent fluid to become ''[[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]]''. This fluid becomes [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and [[turbid]] within 24–48 hours, giving them the appearance of [[pustule]]s; however, the so-called pustules are filled with tissue debris, not pus.<ref name= AFIP/>

By the sixth or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules mature and reach their maximum size. The pustules are sharply raised, typically round, tense, and firm to the touch. The pustules are deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them the feel of a small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaks from the pustules, and by the end of the second week the pustules deflate, and start to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs have formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving [[depigmentation|depigmented]] scars.<ref name=training1>{{cite web |url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview/pdf/diseasemgmt.pdf |title=Smallpox Disease and Its Clinical Management |accessdate=2007-12-26 |format=PDF |work=From the training course titled "Smallpox: Disease, Prevention, and Intervention" (www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview)}}</ref>

Ordinary smallpox generally produces a discrete rash, in which the pustules stand out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash is densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet are involved in the majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merge into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which begin to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remain ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62%.<ref name= PinkBook/>
[[File:Hemorrhagic smallpox.jpg|thumb|left|This man is suffering from severe hemorrhagic-type smallpox.]]

=== Modified ===
Referring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified smallpox occurs mostly in previously vaccinated people. In this form the prodromal illness still occurs but may be less severe than in the ordinary type. There is usually no fever during evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tend to be fewer and evolve more quickly, are more superficial, and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox.<ref name=training1/> Modified smallpox is rarely, if ever, fatal. This form of variola major is more easily confused with [[chickenpox]].<ref name= PinkBook/>

=== Malignant ===
In malignant-type smallpox (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remain almost flush with the skin at the time when raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people develop this type. Historically, it accounted for 5%–10% of cases, and the majority (72%) were children.<ref name= Fenner1>{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=92-4-156110-6 |format=PDF}}</ref> Malignant smallpox is accompanied by a severe [[prodromal]] phase that lasts 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of [[Bacteremia|toxemia]]. The rash on the tongue and palate is extensive. Skin lesions mature slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they are flat and appear to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contain little fluid, are soft and velvety to the touch, and may contain hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox is nearly always fatal.<ref name= PinkBook/>

=== Hemorrhagic ===
[[Hemorrhagic]] smallpox is a severe form that is accompanied by extensive [[Internal bleeding|bleeding into]] the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2% of infections and occurred mostly in adults.<ref name= PinkBook/> In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black,<ref name= PinkBook/> hence this form of the disease is also known as [[black pox]].<ref name=PrestonNY/>

In the early, or fulminating form, hemorrhaging appears on the second or third day as sub-[[conjunctival]] bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky [[erythema]], [[petechiae]], and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, [[serosa]], muscle, and, rarely, the [[epicardium]], [[liver]], [[testes]], [[ovaries]] and [[bladder]]. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage.<ref name= PinkBook/> Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in [[coagulation factor]]s (e.g. [[platelet]]s, [[prothrombin]], and [[globulin]]) and an increase in circulating [[antithrombin]]. Patients in the late stage have significant [[thrombocytopenia]]; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin.<ref name= AFIP/> This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25% of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain.<ref name=eMedicine_Smallpox/> Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.<ref name= PinkBook/>

Smallpox is caused by infection with variola virus, which belongs to the genus [[Orthopoxvirus]], the family [[Poxviridae]] and subfamily chordopoxvirinae.

Four orthopoxviruses cause infection in humans: variola, [[vaccinia]], [[cowpox]], and [[monkeypox]].

Vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature.<ref name = PinkBook>{{cite book | author = Atkinson W, Hamborsky J, McIntyre L, Wolfe S (eds.) | chapter = Smallpox | title = Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (The Pink Book) | edition = 9th | pages = 281–306 | publisher = Public Health Foundation | location =Washington DC |year = 2005 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/smallpox.pdf | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20100409144819/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/smallpox.pdf | archivedate = 2010-04-09| format = PDF}}</ref>

The lifecycle of poxviruses is complicated by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell rather than in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. In order to replicate, poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other [[DNA viruses]], the most important of which is a viral-associated [[DNA-dependent RNA polymerase]].

Both [[viral envelope|enveloped]] and unenveloped virions are infectious. The viral envelope is made of modified [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] membranes containing viral-specific polypeptides, including [[hemagglutinin]].<ref name=Moss/> Infection with either variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other.<ref name=AFIP>{{cite web |url=http://www.afip.org/Departments/infectious/sp/text/1_1.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071009141639/http://www.afip.org/Departments/infectious/sp/text/1_1.htm |archivedate=2007-10-09 |title=Smallpox |accessdate=2008-10-28 |work=Armed Forces Institute of Pathology: Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases}}</ref>

=== Transmission ===
Transmission occurs through inhalation of [[Airborne disease|airborne]] variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] [[mucosa]] of an infected person. It is transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected [[bodily fluid]]s or contaminated objects ([[fomite]]s) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains.<ref name= FactSheet/> The virus can cross the [[placenta]], but the incidence of [[congenital]] smallpox is relatively low.<ref name=AFIP/>
Smallpox is not notably infectious in the [[prodrome|prodromal]] period and viral shedding is usually delayed until the appearance of the rash, which is often accompanied by [[lesion]]s in the mouth and pharynx. The virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness, but is most frequent during the first week of the rash, when most of the skin lesions are intact.<ref name= PinkBook/> Infectivity wanes in 7 to 10 days when scabs form over the lesions, but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Henderson DA |title=Smallpox as a biological weapon: medical and public health management. Working Group on Civilian Biodefense |journal=JAMA |volume=281 |issue=22 |pages=2127–37 |year=1999 |pmid=10367824 |doi=10.1001/jama.281.22.2127 |last12=Parker |first12=G |last13=Perl |first13=T |first14=PK |first15=K |author-separator=, |author2=Inglesby TV |author3=Bartlett JG |display-authors=3 |last4=Russell |last5=Tonat |first4=MS |first5=E |last6=Jahrling |first6=PB |last7=Hauer |first7=J |last8=Layton |first8=M |last9=McDade |first9=J }}</ref>

Smallpox is highly contagious, but generally spreads more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after the onset of the rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In [[temperate]] areas, the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year.<ref name= PinkBook/> Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on [[acquired immunity]]. [[Vaccination]] [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] declines over time and is probably lost in all but the most recently vaccinated populations.<ref name=AFIP/> Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no [[asymptomatic carrier]] state.<ref name= PinkBook/>

== Diagnosis ==
The clinical definition of smallpox is an illness with acute onset of fever greater than 101&nbsp;°F (38.3&nbsp;°C) followed by a rash characterized by firm, deep seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause.<ref name= PinkBook/> If a clinical case is observed, smallpox is confirmed using laboratory tests.

[[Microscope|Microscopically]], poxviruses produce characteristic [[cytoplasmic]] inclusions, the most important of which are known as [[Guarnieri bodies]], and are the sites of [[viral replication]]. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Riedel S |title=Smallpox and biological warfare: a disease revisited |journal=Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent) |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=13–20 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=16200143 |pmc=1200695 }}</ref> The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by [[electron microscopy|electron microscopic]] examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy.<ref name=AFIP/>

Definitive laboratory identification of variola virus involves growing the virus on [[chorioallantoic membrane]] (part of a chicken [[embryo]]) and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/smallpox/biofacts/smllpx-summary.html#_Criteria_for_Determining |title= Smallpox: Current, comprehensive information on pathogenesis, microbiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis |accessdate=2007-12-27 |work= Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy}}</ref> Strains may be characterized by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) analysis.

[[Chickenpox]] was commonly confused with smallpox in the immediate post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.<ref name= PinkBook/>

The earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was [[inoculation]] (also known as variolation). Inoculation was possibly practiced in India as early as 1000 BC,<ref name=Bourzac_2002>{{cite journal | author = Bourzac K| title = Smallpox: Historical Review of a Potential Bioterrorist Tool | journal = Journal of Young Investigators | year = 2002 | volume = 6 | issue = 3 |url= http://www.jyi.org/volumes/volume6/issue3/features/bourzac.html}}</ref> and involved either nasal [[Wiktionary:insufflation|insufflation]] of powdered smallpox scabs, or scratching material from a smallpox lesion into the skin. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged as few of the ancient [[Sanskrit]] medical texts described the process of inoculation.<ref>Wujastyk, Dominik. (1995).

However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2% mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30% mortality rate of the disease itself.<ref name= PinkBook/>

[[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] observed smallpox inoculation during her stay in the [[Ottoman Empire]], writing detailed accounts of the practice in her letters, and enthusiastically promoted the procedure in England upon her return in 1718.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/mod/montagu-smallpox.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689–1762): Smallpox Vaccination in Turkey |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> In 1721, [[Cotton Mather#Smallpox inoculation controversy|Cotton Mather]] and colleagues provoked controversy in Boston by inoculating hundreds. In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]], a doctor in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire]], rural England, discovered that immunity to smallpox could be produced by inoculating a person with material from a [[cowpox]] lesion. Cowpox is a poxvirus in the same family as variola. Jenner called the material used for inoculation [[vaccine]], from the [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] ''vacca'', which is [[Latin]] for cow. The procedure was much safer than variolation, and did not involve a risk of smallpox transmission. Vaccination to prevent smallpox was soon practiced all over the world. During the 19th century, the cowpox virus used for smallpox vaccination was replaced by [[vaccinia virus]]. Vaccinia is in the same family as cowpox and variola but is [[Genetics|genetic]]ally distinct from both. The origin of vaccinia virus and how it came to be in the vaccine are not known.<ref name= PinkBook/>

The current formulation of smallpox vaccine is a live virus preparation of infectious vaccinia virus. The vaccine is given using a bifurcated (two-pronged) needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution. The needle is used to prick the skin (usually the upper arm) a number of times in a few seconds. If successful, a red and itchy bump develops at the vaccine site in three or four days. In the first week, the bump becomes a large blister (called a "Jennerian vesicle") which fills with pus, and begins to drain. During the second week, the blister begins to dry up and a scab forms. The scab falls off in the third week, leaving a small scar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/faq.asp |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Smallpox Vaccine |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=Last reviewed February 7, 2007 |accessdate=2010-12-28 }}</ref>

The [[antibodies]] induced by vaccinia vaccine are cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, cowpox, and variola (smallpox) viruses. Neutralizing antibodies are detectable 10 days after first-time vaccination, and seven days after revaccination. Historically, the vaccine has been effective in preventing smallpox infection in 95% of those vaccinated.<ref name= CDCvac/> Smallpox vaccination provides a high level of immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter. If a person is vaccinated again later, immunity lasts even longer. Studies of smallpox cases in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than 10 years before exposure was 1.3%; it was 7% among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior, and 11% among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection. By contrast, 52% of unvaccinated persons died.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mack TM |title=Smallpox in Europe, 1950–1971 |journal=J. Infect. Dis. |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=161–9 |year=1972 |pmid=5007552 |doi=10.1093/infdis/125.2.161 }}</ref>

There are side effects and risks associated with the smallpox vaccine. In the past, about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated for the first time experienced serious, but non-life-threatening, reactions including toxic or [[allergic reaction]] at the site of the vaccination ([[erythema multiforme]]), spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body, and to other individuals. Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198%) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial [[encephalitis]] or severe [[necrosis]] in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).<ref name= CDCvac/>

Given these risks, as smallpox became effectively eradicated and the number of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s.<ref name=WHO_Factsheet/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pütz MM, Alberini I, Midgley CM, Manini I, Montomoli E, [[Geoffrey L.

== Treatment ==
Smallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease.<ref name=CDCvac>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf |format=PDF|title=Vaccine Overview |accessdate=2008-01-02 |work=Smallpox Fact Sheet}}</ref> Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible [[ventilator]] assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], such as [[Fluid replacement|fluid resuscitation]]. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin [[burn]]s.<ref name= Fenner4/>

No drug is currently approved for the treatment of smallpox. However, [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics, and studies suggest that the antiviral drug [[cidofovir]] might be useful as a therapeutic agent. The drug must be administered [[intravenously]], however, and may cause serious [[renal|kidney]] toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bray M, Roy CJ |title=Antiviral prophylaxis of smallpox |url= http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/54/1/1 |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15163655 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkh286}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
The overall case-fatality rate for ordinary-type smallpox is about 30%, but varies by pock distribution: ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 50–75% of the time, ordinary-type semi-confluent about 25–50% of the time, in cases where the rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10%. The overall fatality rate for children younger than 1 year of age is 40–50%. Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates. The fatality rate for flat-type is 90% or greater and nearly 100% is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox. The case-fatality rate for variola minor is 1% or less.<ref name=training1/> There is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with variola virus.<ref name=training1/>

In fatal cases of ordinary smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth days of the illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating [[immune complex]]es, overwhelming [[viremia]], or an uncontrolled [[immune response]] may be contributing factors.<ref name=PinkBook/> In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved [[heart failure]], sometimes accompanied by [[pulmonary edema]]. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe [[platelet]] loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death.<ref name= Fenner1/> In flat smallpox modes of death are similar to those in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and [[electrolyte]]s beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating [[sepsis]].<ref name= Fenner4>{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf |pages=31,125 |isbn=92-4-156110-6 }}</ref>

=== Complications ===
Complications of smallpox arise most commonly in the [[respiratory system]] and range from simple [[bronchitis]] to fatal [[pneumonia]]. Respiratory complications tend to develop on about the eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary [[bacteria]]l infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of smallpox. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.<ref name=PinkBook/>

Other complications include [[encephalitis]] (1 in 500 patients), which is more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2% of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, [[conjunctiva]], and [[cornea]], leading to complications such as [[conjunctivitis]], [[keratitis]], [[corneal ulcer]], [[iritis]], [[iridocyclitis]], and optic [[atrophy]]. [[Blindness]] results in approximately 35% to 40% of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and [[retina]]l hemorrhages. In 2% to 5% of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing ''[[osteomyelitis]] variolosa''. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, [[tibia]], and [[fibula]], and characteristically cause separation of an [[epiphysis]] and marked [[periosteum|periosteal]] reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and [[arthritis]] may lead to limb deformities, [[ankylosis]], malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.<ref name=AFIP/>

{{Main|History of smallpox}}

=== Viral evolution ===

The date of the appearance of smallpox is not settled. It most likely evolved from a rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago.<ref name=Esposito2006>{{cite journal |author=Esposito JJ, Sammons SA, Frace AM, ''et al.'' |title=Genome sequence diversity and clues to the evolution of variola (smallpox) virus |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5788 |pages=807–12 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16873609 |doi=10.1126/science.1125134 |url=}}</ref><ref name=Li2007>{{cite journal | author = Li Y, Carroll DS, Gardner SN, Walsh MC, Vitalis EA, Damon IK | year = 2007 | title = On the origin of smallpox: correlating variola phylogenics with historical smallpox records | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 104 | issue = 40| pages = 15787–15792 |pmid=17901212 |pmc=2000395 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0609268104}}</ref> The wide range of dates is due to the different records used to calibrate the molecular clock. One [[clade]] was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 years ago. A second clade included both alastrim minor (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present. This clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 years ago.

A second estimate has placed the separation of variola from [[Taterapox]] at 3000–4000 years ago.<ref name=Hughes2010>{{cite journal | author = Hughes AL, Irausquin S, Friedman R | year = 2010 | title = The evolutionary biology of pox viruses | url = | journal = Infect Genet Evol | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 50–59 | pmid=19833230 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2009.10.001 | pmc = 2818276 }}</ref> This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding the appearance of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin. However if the mutation rate is assumed to be similar to that of the [[herpesvirus]]es the divergence date between variola from [[Taterapox]] has been estimated to be 50,000 years ago.<ref name="Hughes2010" /> While this is consistent with the other published estimates it suggests that the archaeological and historical evidence is very incomplete. Better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed.

It seems to have emerged in its endemic form in [[India]] 2500–3000 years ago.<ref name=Shchelkunov2011>{{cite journal |author=Shchelkunov SN |title=Emergence and reemergence of smallpox: the need for development of a new generation smallpox vaccine |journal=Vaccine |volume=29 Suppl 4 |issue= |pages=D49–53 |year=2011 |month=December |pmid=22185833 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.05.037 |url=}}</ref>

By the mid-18th century smallpox was a major [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic disease]] everywhere in the world except in Australia and in several small islands. In Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stanley A Plotkin, Walter A Orenstein, Donald A.

Improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America, but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world. In the United States and South Africa a much milder form of smallpox, ''variola minor'', was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century ''variola minor'' occurred along with ''variola major'', in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with ''variola minor'' experience only a mild systemic illness, are often [[walk|ambulant]] throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with ''v. minor'' induces immunity against the more deadly ''variola major'' form. Thus as ''v. minor'' spread all over the USA, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox, further reducing mortality rates.<ref name= Fenner1/>

Since English physician [[Edward Jenner]] demonstrated the effectiveness of cowpox to protect humans from smallpox in 1796, various attempts were made to eliminate smallpox on a regional scale. As early as 1803, the Spanish Crown organized a mission (the [[Balmis expedition]]) to transport the vaccine to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]] in the Americas and the Philippines, and establish mass vaccination programs there.<ref>[http://www.doh.gov.ph/sphh/balmis.htm Dr. Francisco de Balmis and his Mission of Mercy, Society of Philippine Health History]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> The [[US Congress]] passed the [[Vaccine Act of 1813]] to ensure that safe smallpox vaccine would be available to the American public.

[[File:Rahima Banu.jpg|thumb|left|Two-year old [[Rahima Banu]] of Bangladesh (pictured) was the last person infected with naturally occurring ''Variola major'', in 1975]]
In the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year.<ref name=WHO_Factsheet/> To eradicate smallpox, each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading, by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by. This process is known as "ring vaccination". The key to this strategy was monitoring of cases in a community (known as surveillance) and containment. The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases, as many cases did not come to the attention of the authorities. The fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection, and that [[asymptomatic carrier|carriers]] did not exist, played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox. The WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. Early on donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union and the United States, but by 1973, more than 80% of all vaccine was produced in developing countries.<ref name=Plotkin_1999/>

The last major European outbreak of smallpox was in [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia|1972 in Yugoslavia]], after a pilgrim from [[Kosovo]] returned from the Middle East, where he had contracted the virus. The epidemic infected 175 people, causing 35 deaths. Authorities declared [[martial law]], enforced quarantine, and undertook widespread re-vaccination of the population, enlisting the help of the WHO. In two months, the outbreak was over.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_03.shtml |title=BBC – History – Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge |work= |accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> Prior to this, there had been a smallpox outbreak in May–July 1963 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, brought from the [[Far East]] by a Swedish sailor; this had been dealt with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population.<ref>{{cite journal | author = | title = International Notes—Quarantine Measures Smallpox—Stockholm, Sweden, 1963 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00042757.htm |journal = MMWR | year = 1996 | volume = 45 | issue = 25 | pages = 538–45 | pmid = 9132571 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>

By the end of 1975, smallpox persisted only in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Conditions were very difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, and refugees made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1977, under the direction of Australian microbiologist [[Frank Fenner]]. As the campaign neared its goal, Fenner and his team played an important role in verifying eradication.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/world/26fenner.html |title=Frank Fenner Dies at 95|work= NYTimes.com|accessdate=2010-11-27|first=William|last=Grimes|date=2010-11-25}}</ref> The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (''Variola minor'') was diagnosed in [[Ali Maow Maalin]], a hospital cook in Merca, [[Somalia]], on 26 October 1977.<ref name= PinkBook/> The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly ''Variola major'' had been detected in October 1975 in a two-year-old [[Bangladesh]]i girl, [[Rahima Banu]].<ref name=PrestonNY>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Preston |authorlink=Richard Preston |coauthors= |title=A reporter at large: Demon in the Freezer |url=http://cryptome.org/smallpox-wmd.htm |work=The New Yorker |publisher= |date=12 July 1999 |accessdate=2008-01-03 }}</ref>

More recent public figures include [[Guru Har Krishan]], 8th Guru of the Sikhs, in 1664, [[Peter II of Russia]] in 1730 (died),<ref name="doctorzebra.com">{{cite web|title=President Abraham Lincoln: Health & Medical History|url= http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm#25|date=2007-03-24|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> [[George Washington]] (survived), king [[Louis XV]] in 1774 (died) and [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria]] in 1777.

Prominent families throughout the world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease. For example, several relatives of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] survived the disease but were scarred by it. These include his sister [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret, Queen of Scotland]], his fourth wife, [[Anne of Cleves]], and his two daughters: [[Mary I of England]] in 1527 and [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1562 (as an adult she would often try to disguise the pockmarks with heavy makeup). His great-niece, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring.

In Europe, deaths from smallpox often changed dynastic succession. The only surviving son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], died from complications shortly after apparently recovering from the disease, thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his immediate successors were all females). [[Louis XV of France]] succeeded his great-grandfather [[Louis XIV]] through a series of deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. [[William III of England|William III]] lost his mother to the disease when he was only ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle [[Charles II of England|Charles]] as legal guardian: her death from smallpox would indirectly spark a chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne. William III's wife, [[Mary II of England]], died from smallpox as well. 

In Russia, [[Peter II of Russia]] died of the disease at 15 years of age. Also, prior to becoming [[Russian Empire|Russian Emperor]], [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] caught the virus and suffered greatly from it. He was left scarred and disfigured. His wife, [[Catherine the Great]], was spared but fear of the virus clearly had its effects on her. She feared for her son and heir [[Paul I of Russia|Pavel's]] safety so much that she made sure that large crowds were kept at bay and sought to isolate him. Eventually, she decided to have herself inoculated by a [[Scotland|Scottish]] doctor, Thomas Dimsdale. While this was considered a controversial method at the time, she succeeded. Her son Pavel was later inoculated as well. Catherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her empire stating: "My objective was, through my example, to save from death the multitude of my subjects who, not knowing the value of this technique, and frightened of it, were left in danger." By 1800, approximately 2 million inoculations were administered in the Russian Empire.<ref>Massie, Robert K. (2011). ''Catherine the Great: Portrait of as Woman'', pp. 387-388.

=== Religion and mythology ===
[[File:Kalighat Shitala.jpg|thumb|The Hindu goddess [[Shitala]] was worshipped to prevent or cure smallpox.]]

As a reaction to the devastation of smallpox, smallpox gods and goddesses were invented as a mechanism to cope with the disease. Two examples of this occurred in China and India.

United States of America: HarperCollins Publishers, 1995.</ref> The Chinese also took great measure to protect children from the dangers of smallpox by tricking their smallpox goddess. It was believed that the goddess enjoyed passing the disease to attractive children. This transmission was most likely to occur on the last night of the year, so children wore ugly masks to bed to trick the goddess into passing over them.<ref name="GiblinJames" /> If infection of smallpox did occur, shrines were set up in the homes of the victims. These shrines were worshipped and offerings made to while the victim was sick. If the victim recovered, the shrines were taken away from the home in a special handmade paper chair or boat and burned. If the patient did not recover, the shrine was destroyed and curses were used to remove the goddess from the house.<ref name="HopkinsDonald" />

India’s first records of smallpox can be found in a medical book that dates back to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox.<ref name="GiblinJames" /> India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess [[Shitala]] was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted.<ref>Wiley, Andrea S., & Allen, John S. Medical Anthropology: A Biocultural Approach. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009.</ref> Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims.<ref name="GiblinJames" /> Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.<ref>Tucker, Jonathan B. Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001.</ref>

In medieval times, several countries held a belief in the [[smallpox demon]], who was blamed for the disease. Such beliefs were prominent in Japan, Europe, Africa, and other parts of the world. Nearly all cultures who believed in the demon also believed that it was afraid of the color red. This led to the '''red treatment''', where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red. The practice spread to Europe in the 12th century and was practiced by (among others) [[Charles V of France]] and [[Elizabeth I of England]].<ref name=SmaPoHist/> Given scientific credibility by some studies by Finsen showing red light reduced scarring,<ref name=SmaPoHist/> the belief persisted until the 1930s.
