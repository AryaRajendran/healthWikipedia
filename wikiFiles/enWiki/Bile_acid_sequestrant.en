The '''bile acid sequestrants''' are a group of resins used to bind certain components of [[bile]] in the [[Gut (zoology)|gastrointestinal tract]]. They disrupt the [[enterohepatic circulation]] of [[bile acid]]s by combining with bile constituents and preventing their reabsorption from the gut. In general, they are classified as [[hypolipidemic agent]]s, although they may be used for purposes other than lowering cholesterol. They are used in the treatment of [[chronic diarrhoea]] due to [[bile acid malabsorption]].

==Medical uses==
Since bile acids are biosynthesized from [[cholesterol]], disruption of bile acid reabsorption will decrease cholesterol levels, in particular, [[low-density lipoprotein]] (commonly known as "bad cholesterol"). Therefore, they may be used for the treatment of [[hypercholesterolemia]] and [[dyslipidemia]].  

In chronic [[liver]] diseases such as [[cirrhosis]], bile acids may deposit in the skin, causing [[pruritus]] (itching). Hence, bile acid sequestrants may be used for the prevention of [[pruritus]] in patients with chronic liver disease.

In addition, [[diarrhea]] may be caused by excess bile salts entering the colon rather than being absorbed at the end of the small intestine (the [[ileum]]). The condition of [[bile acid malabsorption]] occurs after surgery to the [[ileum]], in [[Crohn's disease]], with a number of other gastro-intestinal causes, or is commonly a primary, idiopathic condition. The [[SeHCAT]] test can be used for diagnosis. Bile salt diarrhea is a side-effect of [[gallbladder]] removal. Bile acid sequestrants may reduce diarrhea in these patients.

Bile acid sequestrants may also be used to treat hyperthyroidism as an adjunct therapy. By inhibiting the [[enterohepatic circulation]], more L-thyroxine will be lost through defecation, thus lowering body [[thyroxine]] levels.

===Role===
Use of these agents as [[hypolipidemic agent]]s has decreased markedly since the introduction of the [[statin]]s, which are more efficacious than bile acid sequestrants at lowering [[LDL]]. They are occasionally used as an adjunct to the statins (as an alternative to the [[fibrate]]s (another major group of cholesterol-lowering drugs), which are thought to increase the risk of [[rhabdomyolysis]] when used with statins.

Because bile acid sequestrants are not well-absorbed from the gut, they are generally regarded as safe in pregnant women.  However, by interfering with vitamin absorption, they may cause vitamin deficiencies that may affect the fetus. Hence, vitamin supplementation may be warranted, with appropriate intervals between dosing of the vitamins and bile acid sequestrants.

Bile acid sequestrants are the principal therapy for the diarrhea found in [[bile acid malabsorption]].  [[Cholestyramine]], [[colestipol]] and [[colesevelam]] have all been used.  Doses may not need to be as high as those previously used for hyperlipidemia. Many patients find them hard to tolerate, as although the diarrhea may improve, bloating and abdominal pain can worsen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walters|first=JR|coauthors=Pattni, SS|title=Managing bile acid diarrhoea|journal=Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology|year=2010|volume=3|issue=6|pages=349–57|pmid=21180614|doi=10.1177/1756283X10377126|pmc=3002596}}</ref>

Cholestyramine is used in the treatment of ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' infections, in order to absorb toxins A and B.

==Side-effects==
Since bile acid sequestrants are designed to stay in the gut, they, in general, do not have systemic side-effects.  However, they may cause problems in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] (GI tract), such as [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], and [[flatulence]].  Some patients complain of the bad taste.

==Drug interactions==
In addition to bile acids, bile acid sequestrants may also bind drugs in the GI tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream.  For this reason, it is generally advised that bile acid sequestrants be spaced several hours apart from other drugs.

They may also bind fat-soluble [[vitamin]]s, such as [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin D]], [[vitamin E]], and [[vitamin K]].  This effect may result in a vitamin deficiency.  Hence, vitamin supplementation may be warranted.

==Mechanism==
Bile acid sequestrants are [[polymer]]ic compounds that serve as [[ion-exchange resin]]s.  Bile acid sequestrants exchange [[anion]]s such as [[chloride]] ions for bile acids.  By doing so, they bind bile acids and sequester them from enterohepatic circulation.

Since bile acid sequesterants are large polymeric structures, they are not well-absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream.  Thus, bile acid sequestrants, along with any bile acids bound to the drug, are excreted via the feces after passage through the gastrointestinal tract.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/hearthealth/treatments/medications/bileacid.html FDA Heart Health Online - Bile Acid Sequestrants<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Examples==
Three drugs are members of this class; all are synthetic [[polymer]]ic resins:
* [[Cholestyramine]] (Questran)
* [[Colesevelam]]<ref name="pmid11975771">{{cite journal |author=Wong NN |title=Colesevelam: a new bile acid sequestrant |journal=Heart disease (Hagerstown, Md.) |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=63–70 |year=2001 |pmid=11975771 |doi=}}</ref> (Cholestagel in Europe, Welchol in the USA)
