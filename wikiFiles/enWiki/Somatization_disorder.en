'''Somatization disorder''' (also '''Briquet's syndrome''' or '''[[hysteria]]''') is a [[somatoform disorder]] characterized by recurring, multiple, clinically significant complaints about pain, gastrointestinal, sexual and pseudoneurological symptoms. Those complaints must begin before the individual turns 30 years of age,<ref name=DSM4TR>{{cite book |author= American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision: [[DSM-IV-TR]] |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2000|pages=486–490 |isbn=0-89042-025-4}}</ref> and could last for several years, resulting in either treatment seeking behavior or significant treatment.<ref>Goldberg R.J. MD. Practical guide to the care of the psychiatric patient. 3rd ed. Mosby-Elsevier: USA</ref> Individuals with somatization disorder typically visit many doctors in pursuit of effective treatment. Somatization disorder also causes challenge and burden on the life of the caregivers or significant others of the patient.

==Diagnosis==
The [[DSM-IV-TR]] diagnostic criteria are:<ref name=DSM4TR/> 
*A history of somatic complaints over several years, starting prior to the age of 30.
*At least four different sites of pain on the body, AND at least two gastrointestinal problems, AND one sexual dysfunction, AND one pseudoneurological symptom.
*Such symptoms cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition or substance use OR, when there is an associated medical condition, the impairments due to the somatic symptoms are more severe than generally expected.
*Complaints are not feigned as in [[malingering]] or [[factitious disorder]].

The symptoms do not all have to occur at the same time, but may occur over the course of the disorder. A somatization disorder itself is chronic but fluctuating that rarely remits completely. A thorough physical examination of the specified areas of complaint is critical for Somatization disorder diagnosis. Medical examination would provide object evidence of subjective complaints of the individual.<ref name=DSM4TR/>

==Epidemiology==
Somatization disorder is uncommon in the general population. It is thought to occur in 0.2% to 2% of females,<ref>{{cite journal | author = DeGruy F, Columbia L, Dickinson P | year = 1987 | title = Somatization disorder in a family practice | url = | journal = J Fam Pract | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 45–51 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lichstein P. R. | year = 1986 | title = Caring for the patient with multiple somatic complaints | url = | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 79 | issue = 3| pages = 310–314 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Gordon G.H. | year = 1987 | title = Treating somatizing patients | url = | journal = Western Journal of Medicine | volume = 147 | issue = | pages = 88–91 }}</ref><ref>Farley J, Woodruff RA, Guze SB (1968). "The prevalence of hysteria and conversion symptoms," ''The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'', 114:1121–1125 (1968).</ref> and 0.2% of males. Research showed cultural differences in prevalence of somatization disorder. For example, somatization disorder and symptoms were found to be significantly more common in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Canino, Glorisa; Bird, Hector; Rubio-Stipec, Maritza; Bravo, Milagros. |title= The epidemiology of mental disorders in the adult population of Puerto Rico |journal= Revista Interamericana de Psicologia. |volume=34 |issue=1X |pages= 29–46 |year=2000}}</ref> 

There is usually co-morbidity with other psychological disorders, particularly [[mood disorders]] or [[anxiety disorders]].<ref name=DSM4TR/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lieb, Roselind; Meinlschmidt, Gunther; Araya, Ricardo. |title=Epidemiology of the association between somatoform disorders and anxiety and depressive disorders: An update |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=860–863 |year=2007}}</ref> Research also showed comorbidity between somatization disorder and [[personality disorder]], especially [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], and [[Dependent personality disorder|dependent]] personality disorder.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bornstein, Robert F; Gold, Stephanie H |title=Comorbidity of personality disorders and somatization disorder: A meta-analytic review |journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=154–161 |year=2008 }}</ref>

About 10-20 percent of female first degree relatives also have somatization disorder, and male relatives are have increased rates of alcoholism and sociopathy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stern|first=Theodore|title=Massachusetts General Hospital comprehensive clinical psychiatry|year=2008|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780323047432|page=323|edition=1st ed.}}</ref>

==Explanations==
Although somatization disorder has been studied and diagnosed for more than a century, there is debate and uncertainty regarding its pathophysiology.  Most current explanations focus on the concept of a misconnection between the mind and the body.  Widely held theories on this troublesome, often familial disorder fit into three general categories.  

The first and one of the oldest theories is that the symptoms of somatization disorder represent the body’s own defense against psychological stress.  This theory states that the mind has a finite capacity to cope with stress and strain.  Therefore, increasing social or emotional stresses beyond a certain point are experienced as physical symptoms, principally affecting the digestive, nervous, and reproductive systems. In recent years, researchers have found connections between the brain, immune system, and digestive system which may be the reason why somatization affects those systems and that people with [[irritable bowel syndrome]] are more likely to get somatization disorder.<ref name="DSM4TR"/> This theory also helps explain why depression is related to somatization.  It is also experienced in very high levels in women with a history of physical, emotional or sexual abuse<ref>Pribor, E. F., Yutzy, S. H., Dean, J. T., Wetzel, R. D. (1993).  Briquet's Syndrome, dissociation and abuse. american Journal of Psychiatry, 150, 1507-1511.</ref>

The second theory for the cause of somatization disorder is that the disorder occurs due to heightened sensitivity to internal physical sensations.  Some people have the ability to feel even the slightest amount of discomfort or pain within their body.  With this hypersensitivity, the patient would sense pain that the brain normally would not register in the average person such as minor changes in one's heartbeat.  Somatization disorder would then be very closely related to panic disorder under this theory.  However, not much is known about hypersensitivity and its relevance to somatization disorder.  The psychological or physiological origins of hypersensitivity are still not well understood by experts.

The third theory is that somatization disorder is caused by one’s own negative thoughts and overemphasized fears.  Their catastrophic thinking about even the slightest ailments such as thinking a cramp in their shoulder is a tumor, or shortness of breath is due to asthma, could lead those who have somatization disorder to actually worsen their symptoms.  This then causes them to feel more pain for just a simple thing like a headache. Often the patients feel like they have a rare disease.  This is because their doctors would not be able to have a medical explanation for their unconsciously exaggerated pain that the patient actually thinks is there.  This thinking that the symptom is catastrophic also often reduces the activities they normally do. They fear that doing activities that they would normally do on a regular basis would make the symptoms worse.  The patient slowly stops doing activities one by one until they practically shut themselves from a normal life.  With nothing else to do it leaves more time to think about the “rare disease” they have and consequently ending in greater stress and disability.<ref name="minddisorders.com">www.minddisorders.com/Py-Z/Somatization-disorder.html.

===Neuroimaging evidence===
A recent review of the cognitive–affective neuroscience of somatization disorder suggested that catastrophization in patients with somatization disorders tend to present a greater vulnerability to pain. The relevant brain regions include the dorsolateral prefrontal, insular, rostral anterior cingulate, premotor, and parietal cortices.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Stein DJ, Muller J. |title= Cognitive-affective neuroscience of somatization disorder and functional somatic syndromes: reconceptualizing the triad of depressionanxiety-somatic symptoms |journal= CNS Spectr |volume=13| pages=379–384 |year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Garcia-Campayoa, Javier; Fayed, Nicolas; Serrano-Blanco, Antoni; Roca, Miquel |title=Brain dysfunction behind functional symptoms: Neuroimaging and somatoform, conversive, and dissociative disorders. |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=224–231 |year=2009 | pmid =  19553880 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3283252d43}}</ref>

==Treatments==
To date, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is the best established treatment for a variety of somatoform disorders including somatization disorder.<ref name="pmid16864762">{{cite journal |author=Allen LA, Woolfolk RL, Escobar JI, Gara MA, Hamer RM |title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy for somatization disorder: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Arch.
