'''Alcian blues''' ([[WP:IPA for English|IPA]] ′al·shən ′blü<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/alcian-blue McGraw-Hill Science & Technology Dictionary: alcian blue]</ref>), are a family of polyvalent basic dyes, of which, the '''Alcian blue 8G''' (also called '''Ingrain blue 1''', and '''C.I. 74240''', formerly called Alcian blue 8GX from the name of a batch of an [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] product) has been historically the most common and the most reliable member.<ref name=Hayat80>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oGj7MLioFlQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Stains and Cytochemical Methods'', By M. A. Hayat, 1993 ed, Chapter 8, page 80]</ref> It is used to stain acidic polysaccharides such as [[glycosaminoglycan]]s in [[cartilage]]s and other body structures, some types of [[mucopolysaccharide]]s, sialylated glycocalyx of cells etc. For many of these targets it is one of the most widely used [[cationic]] dyes for both [[Optical microscope|light]] and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]]. Use of alcian blue has historically been a popular [[staining]] method in [[histology]] especially for light microscopy in paraffin embedded sections and in semithin resin sections. The tissue parts that specifically stain by this dye become blue to bluish-green after staining and are called '''"Alcianophilic"''' (akin to "[[eosin]]ophilic" or "[[Sudan stain|sudanophilic]]"). Alcian blue staining can be combined with [[H&E stain]]ing, [[Periodic acid-Schiff stain|PAS staining]] and [[van Gieson]] [[staining]] methods. Alcian blue can be used to quantitate acidic glycans both in [[microspectrophotometry|microspectrophotometric]] quantitation in solution or for staining glycoproteins in [[Gel_electrophoresis#Polyacrylamide|polyacrylamide gels]] or on [[western blot]]s. Biochemists had used it to assay acid polysaccharides in urine since 1960s for diagnosis of diseases like [[mucopolysaccharidosis]] but from 1970's, partly due to lack of availability of Alcian and partly due to length and tediousness of the procedure, alternative methods had to be developed e.g. [[Dimethyl methylene blue]] (DMB) method.<ref>''Clinical Chemistry'' March 1989 vol. 35 no. 3 374–379</ref>

Prof. J. E. Scott, the first person outside the dye Industry to crack the chemical secret of this dye comments:
:"Probably no other dyestuff has been applied to such wide variety of problems in biology and medicine. On the other hand, no other dyestuff had such a chequered history as AB.<ref name="Scott Now you see it">[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0722.1996.tb00038.x/abstract ''Eur J Oral Sci.'' 1996 Feb;104(1):2–9. Alcian blue. Now you see it, now you don't. Scott J. E.]</ref>"

In addition to its wide use as a stain Alcian blue has also been used in other diverse applications e.g. gelling agent for lubricating fluids, modifiers for electrodes, charged coating agents etc.

==History==
The [[Phthalocyanine Blue BN|Monstral blue]] found to coat the inside of [[copper]] vessels used to process [[phthalic acid]] derivatives had lead to the discovery of [[Phthalocyanine]] in 1907. Attracted by the brilliance, stability and insolubility of this [[chromophore]], attempts were made to reversibly modify it so that it would be carried into fabric in a solution and then easily precipitated (ingrained) into an unleachable but finely well dispersed deposit (hence the name "'''''ingrain dyeing'''''"). From this attempt, Alcian Blue (Ingrain blue 1) was first synthesized by the [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] dyestuffs department under N. H. Haddock and Wood in the early 1940s and patented in 1947 (Patent numbers: [http://www.wikipatents.com/GB-Patent-586340/phthalocyanine-derivaties GB 586340] and [http://www.wikipatents.com/GB-Patent-587636/new-water-soluble-phthalocyanine-derivatives GB 587636]),<ref name=druglead>http://www.druglead.com/cds/Alcian-Blue.html</ref> originally as a textile dye. In 1950 it was used by Steedman as a selective dye for mucins.<ref>Steedman, H. F., ''Microsc. Sci.'', v. 91, 477–479 (1950)</ref> While the popularity of Alcian blue expanded exponentially, the difficulty involved in its production due to environmentally hazardous intermediate steps made its availability difficult and ICI stopped producing it by 1973. Many of the alternate sources sold similar looking color products with unreliable staining.

Prof J. E. Scott worked to decipher the chemistry of Alcian blue which was known only to the Industry but kept as a tight trade secret. After spending 3 man-years of effort (which would have been unnecessary had the industry released the results) in 1972 he published the structure of Alcian blue and was able to get ICI to confirm it in 1973, incidentally in the same time that ICI also had just stopped producing it.<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/pt161084838nq785/ ''Histochemistry and Cell Biology'' Volume 37, Number 4 (1973), 379–380, "Alcian dyes: I.C.I. cease manufacture and release details of composition" J. E. Scott]</ref>

After the interim crisis since 1970s when [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] had to stop, there have now been environmentally safe alternative industrial manufacturing of this dye that is supposed to work as well as 8GX but is called 8G since it is made differently.<ref name=anatech>http://www.anatechltdusa.com/Innovators/6_InnDyes.html</ref> In attempt to answer what was the importance of discovering an alternative method of manufacturing this compound, a company (Anatech Ltd, USA) which remanufactured Alcian Blue says:
:"Alcian blue is highly selective for the tissue substances (given the proper solution pH), and forms insoluble complexes that withstand harsh subsequent treatment (like PAS) without destaining. That is what makes this dye so important. Do any other dyes have this attribute? Yes, two others to be exact, out of thousands listed in the Colour Index and Conn's Biological Stains." These two are '[[Alcian yellow]]' and [[basic red 18]] which are again both equally unavailable and also lack the brilliant contrast of the blue.

==Etymology of "Alcian"==
[[Image:WoodlandKingfisher.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the [[Halcyon (genus)#Etymology|'''Halcyon''' Kingfisher]]s whose name comes from a Greek myth where [[Alcyone]] was converted to this bird and caused the calmness of the seas during the [[wiktionary:halcyon days|Halcyon Days]].]]According to Elsevier's dictionary of chemoetymology the ''Alcian'' in Alcian Blue might have been coined by contraction (and slight alteration) of ''[[phthalocyanine]]''.".<ref>Alexander Senning. 2007. [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&q=alcian#v=snippet&q=alcian&f=false ''Elsevier's dictionary of chemoetymology]''. Amsterdam: Elsevier. p. 11.</ref> Oxford online dictionary mentions that it was a [[trademark]] and also specifies<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Alcian%2Bblue?region=us</ref> 
:"1940s: Alcian perhaps from (phth)'''al'''(o)'''cyan'''(ine) with a phonetic respelling".
This hypothesis is consistent with the name of [[Alcian green]] which is a tetraphenyl-phthalocyanine with copper.<ref>http://www.chemnet.com/resource/colour/supplier.cgi?exact=dict&f=plist&l=en&terms=37370-50-6&id=1329</ref>

However Prof. J. E. Scott who had cracked the Chemistry of Alcian Blue himself and later received confirmation from the manufacturer (ICI) wrote that Alcian was a trademark that ICI preferred to be spelt starting with a capital "A", and he presumes it came from the [[old English]] word "'''''halcyon'''''", which has a "romantic and poetic associations with the [[Halcyon (genus)#Etymology|kingfisher bird]] and [[wiktionary:halcyon days|calm seas]]".<ref name="Scott Now you see it"/> Prof. Scott also states that Alcian green was merely a mixture of Alcian Blue and [[Alcian yellow]] and not a single compound, which is also supported by [[thin layer chromatography]] data from various sources e.g. works by another dye expert Prof. R. W. Horobin—one of the two chief editors of the 10th edition of the 75-year-old ''Conn's Biological Stains Manual'' published on behalf of the [[Biological Stain Commission]].<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/q2v7731r12202482/ ''The Histochemical Journal'' Volume 4, Number 5 (1972), 391–399, DOI: 10.1007/BF01012530 Impurities and staining characteristics of Alcian Blue samples R. W. Horobin and D. J. Goldstein]</ref>

[[Alcian Yellow]] is an azo dye which neither has a [[phthalocyanine]] ring nor any of the colors of the Kingfisher, but in common with Alcian blue, has hydrolyzable charged [[thiouronium]] side-chains and similar stability of the final stained product. On the other hand there are other [[phthalocyanine]] dyes like [[Luxol fast blue]] and [[Durazol blue]] which have not acquired "Alcian" as a part of their names.<ref>[http://stainsfile.info/StainsFile/dyes/phthalocompare.htm stainsfile.info]</ref>

==Physical properties==

===Color===
The solid Alcian Blue is obtained as greenish-black (or sometimes dark bluish violet<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=A8VvfFbNBIcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Handbook of Biological Dyes and Stains: Synthesis and Industrial Applications'' By R. W. Sabnis]</ref>) crystals with metallic sheen. The aqueous solution is bright greenish-blue. Though the compound alcian blue itself is unstable (see stability below) the staining it produces is stable and light fast (i.e. does not bleach).

===Paradoxic lack of Metachromasia===
Unlike tricyclic thiazines (e.g. [[toluidine blue]], [[methylene blue]] and [[azure A]] etc.) which are [[metachromasy|metachromatic]] due to switching from monomeric to [[Stacking (chemistry)|stacked]] aggregates, Alcian blue is apparently [[orthochromatic]]. In common with [[Astra blue]] and other similar dyes, this property that it does not change color either by change in concentration or by combination with substrates, makes it very suitable for microspectrophotometry. The apparent lack of metachromasia is not because it is truly [[orthochromatic]] but because "it is already fully metachromatic" in aqueous solution.<ref name="Scott Now you see it"/>

====Absorption maximum affected by aggregation====
In aqueous solution large numbers of AB molecules [[Stacking (chemistry)|stack]] together as [[micelle]]s of very large size, too large to be even dialysed. Thus even at a fairly high dilution, it has an absorption maximum at ~600–615&nbsp;nm which is actually not the absorption maximum of a dye monomer but that of the multimer. Since the absorbed light is of yellow orange spectrum, the transmitted/reflected light is perceived by our eye as the [[complementary color]] of slightly greenish blue or [[cyan]]. In aqueous solution Alcian blues continue to be metachromatic at molar concentrations one hundredth those at which toluidine blue is mainly orthochromatic. Only a very small shoulder of the absorption curve at 670–680&nbsp;nm represent the monomeric dye which is usually the minority and becomes even lesser minority (<10<sup>8</sup>M) in presence of salts. However when the solvent is [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]]—a non-protic solvent of moderately high dielectric constant, Alcian blue does not aggregate and a big monomeric absorption peak can be well visualized. A similar spectral shift to the longer monomeric peak is also observed when solvents like ethanol (or ethanol water mixture) is used as a vehicle or when nonionic detergents like [[Triton X-100]] are used, that make exogenous micelles.

===Molar extinction coefficient===
Alcians blue carries [[Phthalocyanine]] one of the most highly colored chromophores yet known with a [[Molar absorptivity|molar extinction]] of 120,000 i.e. AB is detectable at half the molar concentration of popular dyes like [[toluidine blue]], tryarylmethanes (e.g. [[pararosaniline]] and the analogous Schiff bases used in [[Periodic acid-Schiff stain|PAS stain]], [[Crystal violet]] in [[Gram staining|Gram stain]]) etc.

===Solubility===
It is water soluble. When each of the pair of substituents on the pendant group nitrogens are toluyl, the solubility in water at 20&nbsp;°C is about 9.5% w/w ; and similarly a few other solubilities are: 6.0% in absolute [[ethanol]], 6.0% in [[2-Ethoxyethanol|Cellosolve]] and 3.25% ethylene glycol, whereas it is practically insoluble in xylene.<ref name=druglead/> In relative/partitioning terms, Alcian Blue 8G has a (octanol) [[Partition coefficient]] "LogP" of −9.7, suggesting it is rather water soluble (lipid soluble if LogP>0, and good lipid stains generally have a LogP>+7).<ref name=DakoSpecial>[http://www.dako.com/index/knowledgecenter/kc_publications/kc_publications_connection/kc_publications_connection14.htm/28829_2010_conn14_special_stains_dye_chemistry_staining_horobin.pdf Dako Scientific Publications March 2010, Volume 14, ''Special Stains and H&E'' p. 121 Ask the experts: "Special Stains" – Influence of Dye Chemistry on Staining]</ref> [[Methanol]] is an acceptable substitute for ethanol as a potential vehicle for Alcian blue, but [[isopropanol]] is not, because, within a few hours all of suspended Alcian blue precipitates if isopropanol is tried as a vehicle.<ref>[http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10520298109067298 Stain Technol. 1981 Mar;56(2):129–31. A newly certified dye—Alcian blue 8GX. Schenk E.]</ref>

===Melting point===
The sample compound with Merck index number 218 has a melting point of 148&nbsp;°C.

==Chemistry==
It is a tetravalent basic (cationic) dye with a copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>, coordination 4 of 6, orbital configuration d<sup>9</sup> with [[Jahn–Teller effect|Jahn–Teller]] distortion) [[phthalocyanine]] nucleus ([[Phthalocyanine Blue BN|CuPc]]) with three or four pendent [[isothiouronium]] side chains imparting its bulkiness and positive charges. In order to qualify as an alcian blye family member there has to be at least 2 side chains and the mixtures often have 3 chains in average to qualify as 8G. Four tetramethylisothiouronium groups per molecule are shown in the picture. ICI had claimed an average of about three side chains per molecule, but analyses by Prof Scotts lab suggested between three and four. Most of them are at the 2(3) positions, as in the formula and sometimes a cartoon representation uses the methylene bridge criss crossing across the bond between these two positions to indicate that it could bind either of these two positions. A large number of isomers, differing in the positions of the cationic groups, are possible. Alcian blue 7GX carries fewer isothiouronium groups than 8GX. Similarly 5GX and 2GX may have even fewer side groups but it was not rigorously proven.

The [[phthalocyanine]] aromatic nucleus has a large Conjugated system which has a CBN (Conjugated bond number) of 48.<ref name=DakoSpecial/> However it is the charges on the isothiouronium side groups that still keeps it water soluble. These side groups can carry bulkier alkyl or aryl substituents rather than the 8x2 methyl groups as in the image given. These groups split off from the macrocyclic ring during the washing at the end of staining or by rather mind conditions (e.g. pH above 5.6) or during spontaneous degradation.

The metals in the Phthallocyanine nucleus and substituted groups directly attached to the aromatic nucleus determine colors of the members of the metal phthallocyanine family e.g. Alcian Blue and the [[Phthalocyanine Blue|copper phthalocyanine]] itself are blue, but brominated or [[Phthalocyanine Green G|chlorinated copper phthalocyanine]] and sulfonated copper phthalocyanine are green.

Alcian Blue has a relatively high solubility in salt solutions and stains slower than other dyes. By changing pH or ambient salt concentrations characteristic staining patterns can be obtained.

===pH controlled staining===
At pH 1.0 it stains only sulfated polysaccharides and at pH 2.5 also stains carboxyl group containing sugars such as [[sialic acid]]s and [[uronic acid]]s intensify the stain of hyaluronic acids which would also stain albeit relatively weakly by their half sulfate esters at pH 1.0.<ref>[http://jhc.sagepub.com/content/22/8/774.full.pdf "Simultaneous Differential Staining by a Cationic Carbocyanine Dye of Nucleic Acids Proteins and Conjugated Proteins Ii. Carbohydrate and Sulfated Carbohydrate-containing Proteins" Marie R. Green and Jullia V. Pastewka ''J Histochem Cytochem'' 1974 22: 774]</ref>

===Electrolyte controlled staining===
A staining method where at a fixed pH of about 5.5, different critical salt concentration (Classically MgCl<sub>2</sub>, but NaCl, KCl, LiBr are potential alternatives) can be used where the smaller (faster diffusing) salt cation competes with alcian blue to bind to the anionic sites. Target material specific critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) is supposed to selectively identify sulphated, carboxylated and phosphated structures for example as the targets.

===Stability===
Alcian blue 8G as an exception to most other dyes can deteriorate even in the solid state, changing to an insoluble pigment, unless it is the [[pyridine variant of alcian blue]] (Alcian Blue-tetrakis(methylpyridinium) chloride, [[CAS registry number|CAS]] 123439-83-8, CB6503730, [[PubChem]] [http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=24860335 24860335]).<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10950177 ''Biotech Histochem.'' 2000 May;75(3):147–50. Alcian blue pyridine variant—a superior alternative to alcian blue 8GX: staining performance and stability. Churukian C. J., Frank M., Horobin R. W.]</ref> The solution is unstable at pH 5.6 and above, unless MgCl<sub>2</sub> is used as a stabilizer. According to Prof. [[John A. Kiernan]]—one of the two chief editors of the 10th edition of the 75-year-old ''Conn's Biological Stains Manual'' published on behalf of the [[Biological Stain Commission]]:<ref>http://www.histosearch.com/histonet/Jan06A/Re.HistonetDryStainsShelfA.html</ref> 
:"Acidic solutions of alcian blue 8G are stable for some years on my shelves. Churukian's lab manual gives a recommended shelf life of 6 months. An alcian blue solution with a precipitate should be discarded and replaced, not filtered and used."

===Explanation of staining selectivity===
[[Nucleic acid]]s are generally basophilic because they have a very high density of negative charge due to the sugar phosphate backbone. However in contrast to other basic i.e. cationic dyes, Alcian blue usually (given the right pH and salt concentrations, and normal temperature and duration in minutes, not hours) preferably stains acidic [[glycosaminoglycan]]s but not the chromatin and nissel substance, the mechanism of which had been a mystery for a long time and various theories were proposed. Though the presumed basis of the staining is its positive charge attracted to negative structures (e.g. acidic sugars), bulkiness (width 2.5–3&nbsp;nm, compared to [[toluidine blue]] ~0.7 x1.1&nbsp;nm<ref>http://www.chalcogen.infim.ro/789_Jebaramya.pdf</ref>) makes its diffusion very slow in less permeable parts of the tissue and thus prevent it from staining highly negative yet compact structures such as chromatin and nissel substance.<ref>[http://www.dako.com/08066_12may10_webchapter18.pdf Dako Education Guide—''Special Stains and H & E'' second edition, Chapter 18: How Do Dyes Impart Color to Different Components of the Tissues? by Richard W. Horobin]</ref> However prolonged staining (few days at 25&nbsp;°C) or DNA denaturing conditions may allow Alcian blue to also stain the nucleus. The isolation of the positive charge from the aromatic electron cloud by the intervening methylene bridges makes the localized positive charged regions "hard" ions in contrast to soft ions where the charge is delocalized over the whole aromatic pi cloud.<ref>[http://www.anatechltdusa.com/Innovators/6_InnDyes.html anatechltdusa.com]</ref> When these hard cations encounter the hard anions e.g. in form of sulfate they form salts without regard for the precise chemical nature of the anion. The resulting salts are highly stable but can be slowly exchanged with high concentration of salts. Washing with water or alkali treatment after staining causes base catalyzed hydrolysis and removal of the pendant positively charged side chains and the resulting compound is [[Phthalocyanine Blue]] which forms a blue water insoluble dye precipitate.<ref>"Dyes and other colorants in microtechnique and biomedical research" J. A. Kiernan—''Coloration technology'', 2006—Wiley Online Library</ref> The precipitates are so robust that they withstand harsh conditions like PAS or other counterstaining and also dehydration and embedding treatments (in contrast [[toluidine blue]] is partially extracted away during dehydration). This unleachability is the chemical basis of the ingrain dyeing for which AB (Ingrain blue 1) was originally designed by the dye industry.

==Manufacturing and purity==
The historic Alcian Blue varied so much batch to batch that only the 8GX (e.g. not even the 8GS) batch produced by ICI was later decided to be the biologically useful ones. Commercially available batches usually contained about 49% of the actual dye and rest used to be Sulfate, boric acid, dextrin and other impurities and by various extraction methods up to 80% pure extracts can be made. Actually the dye does not necessary contain all 4 substituents but might contain 2 or 3 of them and have various geometric isomers. But anyhow the manufacture of 8GX by ICI had stopped by Mid-1970s because of environmental hazards and very small lots were available that were received from alternate sources. Only recently Alcian Blue has been re manufactured in bulk using safer procedures but the newer product does not have the suffix X (or S) since the manufacture process (and the exact product composition) is somewhat different.<ref name=anatech/>

==Material safety==
Alcian blue is an eye and respiratory tract irritant. Solid Alcian blue is a combustible powder and should never be handled close to heat or a naked flame. Heating Alcian blue produces toxic fumes of nitrogen compounds. It can react violently if mixed with oxidising materials. The solution of Alcian blue is a skin sensitiser and corrosive (partly due to the acidic pH needed to maintain it unhydrolyzed in solution) and harmful by skin absorption. Most vendor MSDS (Material safety datasheet) mention that effect of ingestion not known or target organ not known. However some do mention that potential target organs are teeth and kidneys.<ref>http://www.lifelinecelltech.com/MSDS/MSDS%20for%20CM-0052,%20Alcian%20Blue%20Stain.pdf</ref>

==Uses in Dye Industry==
This stain was originally discovered by ICI in 1940s as a member of the competitive dye industry for the purpose of industrial dying. It was used for some time for staining textiles, leather products and inks. ICI sold thousands of tons of alcian blue and filed multiple patents regarding its manufacturing process to keep its chemistry a tight secret. However ICI had had trouble with the dye's solubility under textile dyeing conditions, and various process changes in manufacturing were made during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Uses in biological staining==

===Drug interference in staining===
[[Trypanosoma|Trypanocidal]] drug [[suramin]] is polysulfated and gives a positive alcian blue reaction even at pH 1.<ref name=Hayat80/> Thus, in tissues from a patient on Suramin Alcian blue cannot be used or interpreted reliably.

==Uses in quantitative biochemistry==

{{Empty section|date=September 2012}}

==Uses other than as a dye or stain==
In addition to its use as a dye or stain Alcian blue also finds other material science uses.

===Adhesive===
Alcian blue has been used as an adhesive to help stick  glycol methacrylate sections to glass slides (which have negatively charged silicate groups).<ref>Archimbaud E., Islam A., Preisler H. D. (1986) "Alcian blue method for attaching glycol methacrylate sections to glass slides". ''Stain Technology'' 61: 121–123.</ref>

===Coating agent===
Alcian blue carrying a large aromatic surface that can participate in Van der Waal's interaction as well as multiple licalized charges. Thus it can be coated onto surfaces and significantly modify surface property and charge. Some cells in culture grow better on surfaces coated with positive charge like [[poly-L-lysine]] or [[polyornithine]] or Alcian blue. Alcian blue coated surfaces hold onto the negatively charge glycocalyx so tight that it can even be used to cover a layer of cells and then float it up to peel off the roof ("unroofing") to study the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=P3d1Pvoui8wC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Introduction to Electron Microscopy for Biologists'' edited by Terence David Allen]</ref>

===Gelling or lubricating agent===
Alcian Blue has been used as a gelling agent for lubricating fluids<ref name=druglead/> likely due to the stacking properties of this macrocylic [[aromatic]] compound.

===Electrode component===
Another application is "Alcian Blue Modified Carbon Paste Electrode" (ABMCPE) which acts as a highly sensitive redox sensor compared to Bare Carbon Paste Electrode (BCPE) and exhibits strong "promoting" effect and stability.<ref>[http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol4/4060832.pdf ''Int. J. Electrochem. Sci.'', Vol. 4, 2009]</ref>
