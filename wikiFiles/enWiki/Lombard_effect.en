==Lombard speech==
When heard with noise, listeners hear speech recorded in noise better compared to that speech which has been recorded in quiet and then played given with the same level of [[Auditory masking|masking noise]]. Changes between normal and Lombard speech include:<ref name="Junqua"/><ref name="Summers"/>
* increase in phonetic [[fundamental frequency|fundamental frequencies]]
* shift in energy from low frequency bands to middle or high bands,
* increase in [[sound intensity]],
* increase in [[vowel]] duration,
* spectral tilting,
* shift in [[formant]] center frequencies for F1 (mainly) and F2.
* the duration of [[content word]]s are prolonged to a  greater degree in noise than [[function word]]s.<ref name="Patel">{{cite journal |author=Patel R, Schell KW |title=The influence of linguistic content on the Lombard effect |journal=J.

These changes cannot be controlled by instructing a person to speak as they would in silence, though people can learn control with feedback.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.397561 |author=Pick HL, Siegel GM, Fox PW, Garber SR, Kearney JK |title=Inhibiting the Lombard effect |journal=J.

The Lombard effect also occurs following [[laryngectomy]] when people following [[speech therapy]] talk with  [[esophageal speech]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9924(88)90022-6 |author=Zeine L, Brandt JF |title=The Lombard effect on alaryngeal speech |journal=J Commun Disord |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=373–83 |year=1988 |month=September |pmid=3183082 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0021-9924(88)90022-6}}</ref>

==Mechanisms==

The intelligibility of an individual’s own vocalization can be adjusted with audio-vocal reflexes using  their own hearing (private loop), or it can be adjusted indirectly in terms of how well listeners can hear the vocalization (public loop).<ref name="Lane"/> Both processes are involved in the Lombard effect.

===Private loop===
A speaker can regulate their vocalizations particularly its amplitude relative to background noise with reflexive auditory feedback. Such auditory feedback is known to maintain the production of vocalization since deafness affects the vocal acoustics of both humans<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.400107 |author=Waldstein RS |title=Effects of postlingual deafness on speech production: implications for the role of auditory feedback |journal=J. Acoust. Soc. Am. |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=2099–114 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2269726 |url=http://link.aip.org/link/?jas/88/2099&agg=MEDLINE_JAS}}</ref> and songbirds<ref>{{cite journal |author=Konishi M |title=Effects of deafening on song development in American robins and black-headed grosbeaks |journal=Z Tierpsychol |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=584–99 |year=1965 |month=August |pmid=5879978 }}</ref> Changing the auditory feedback also changes vocalization in human speech<ref>{{cite journal |author=Siegel GM, Schork EJ, Pick HL, Garber SR |title=Parameters of auditory feedback |journal=J Speech Hear Res |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=473–5 |year=1982 |month=September |pmid=7176623 |url=http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7176623}}</ref> or bird song.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leonardo A, Konishi M |title=Decrystallization of adult birdsong by perturbation of auditory feedback |journal=Nature |volume=399 |issue=6735 |pages=466–70 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10365958 |doi=10.1038/20933}}</ref> Neural circuits have been found in the [[brainstem]] that enable such reflex adjustment.<ref name="Huge">{{cite journal |author=Hage SR, Jürgens U, Ehret G |title=Audio-vocal interaction in the pontine brainstem during self-initiated vocalization in the squirrel monkey |journal=Eur.

===Public loop===
A speaker can regulate their vocalizations at higher cognitive level in terms of observing its consequences on their audience’s ability to hear it.<ref name="Lane"/>  In this auditory self-monitoring adjusts vocalizations in terms of learnt associations of what features of their vocalization, when made in noise, create effective and efficient communication.  The Lombard effect has been found to be greatest upon those words that are important to the listener to understand a speaker suggesting such cognitive effects are important.<ref name="Patel"/>

===Development===
Both private and public loop processes exist in children. There is a [[child development|development]] shift however from the Lombard effect being linked to acoustic self-monitoring in young children to the adjustment of vocalizations to aid its intelligibility for others in adults.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Amazi DK, Garber SR |title=The Lombard sign as a function of age and task |journal=J Speech Hear Res |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=581–5 |year=1982 |month=December |pmid=7162159 |url=http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7162159}}</ref>

===Neurology===
The Lombard effect depends upon audio-vocal neurons in the periolivary region of the [[superior olivary complex]] and the adjacent pontine [[reticular formation]].<ref name="Huge"/> It has been  suggested that the Lombard effect might also involve the higher cortical areas<ref name="Lane"/> that control these lower brainstem areas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jürgens U |title=The neural control of vocalization in mammals: a review |journal=J Voice |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18207362 |doi=10.1016/j.jvoice.2007.07.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-1997(07)00092-6}}</ref>

==Choral singing==

[[Choir|Choral singer]]s  experience reduced  [[feedback]] due to the sound of other singers upon their own voice.<ref name="tomkinson">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0892-1997(05)80316-9 |author=Tonkinson S |title=The Lombard effect in choral singing |journal=J Voice |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=24–9 |year=1994 |month=March |pmid=8167784 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-1997(05)80316-9}}</ref> This results in a tendency for people in choruses to sing at a louder level if it is not controlled by a [[conducting|conductor]]. Trained soloists can control this effect but it has been suggested that after a concert they might speak more  loudly in noisy surrounding as in after-concert parties.<ref name="tomkinson"/> 

The Lombard effect also occurs to those playing instruments such as the [[guitar]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.381900 |author=Johnson CI, Pick HL, Garber SR, Siegel GM |title=Intensity of guitar playing as a function of auditory feedback |journal=J.

==Animal vocalization==

Noise has been found to affect the vocalizations of animals that vocalize  against a background of human [[noise pollution]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brumm H.|coauthors=Slabbekoorn H.|title=Acoustic communication in noise|journal=In: Advances in the Study of Behavior|year=2005|volume=35|pages=151–209|doi=10.1016/S0065-3454(05)35004-2|series=Advances in the Study of Behavior|first1=H|isbn=978-0-12-004535-8}}</ref>
