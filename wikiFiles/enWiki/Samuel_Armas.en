}}'''Samuel Alexander Armas''' (born {{Birth date|1999|12|02}}) is the child shown in a famous photograph by Michael Clancy, dubbed the '''"Hand of Hope"''',<ref>[http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl-handofhope.htm Hand of Hope], David Emery, Urban Legends (About.com)</ref> of his hand extending from an opening in his mother's uterus and touching his surgeon's finger during [[fetal surgery|open fetal surgery]] for [[spina bifida]].

==Story behind the photo==

The photograph was taken during a medical procedure to fix the spina bifida lesion of a 21-week-old fetus in the womb. The operation was performed by a surgical team at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. The team, Dr. Joseph Bruner and Dr. Noel Tulipan, had been developing a technique for correcting certain fetal problems in mid-pregnancy. Their procedure involved temporarily opening the [[uterus]], draining the [[amniotic fluid]], partially extracting and performing surgery on the tiny [[fetus]], and then restoring the fetus to the uterus back inside the mother.

===Samuel Armas===

Alex and Julie Armas first discovered that their baby had spina bifida during an ultrasound 14 weeks after [[Conception (biology)|conception]]. The Armases came across the Vanderbilt procedure while researching their options online.<ref name="FamousPictures">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.famouspictures.org/mag/index.php?title=Fetus_hand_reaches_out|title = Famous Pictures Magazine - Fetus Hand Reaches Out|publisher = Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate = 2007-08-17 }}</ref>

This was the surgical team's 54th operation on a fetus still in the uterus.<ref name="snopes">{{cite web |date=September 3, 2006|url = http://www.snopes.com/photos/medical/thehand.asp|title = Urban Legends Reference Pages - The Hand|publisher = pub| accessdate = 2007-08-17 | last=Barbara and David P. Mikkelson}}</ref>  During the operation, Dr. Joseph Bruner opened the womb and Dr. Tulipan successfully alleviated the effects of the opening in Samuel's spine caused by the spina bifida.

==Around the world==

Pictures from the surgery were printed in a number of newspapers in the U.S. and around the world, including [[USA Today]]. As a result of the operation, Armas was healthy when he was delivered on December 2, 1999.

On September 25, 2003, the boy's parents, Alex and Julie, testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space about the photo and their experience with in-utero surgery.

==Matt Drudge==

In 1999 [[Matt Drudge]] hosted a Saturday night television show called ''[[Drudge (TV series)|Drudge]]'' on the [[Fox News Channel]]. In Nov 1999 he attempted to show Samuel's picture on his Fox News program, but was not allowed to by the network. This led to his leaving of the show for what he claimed to be the network's censorship. Fox News directors didn't want to use the picture because they feared Drudge would use it to support a pro-life argument. They viewed this would be misleading because the tabloid photo dealt not with abortion, but with an emergency operation on the baby for spina bifida.<ref name="abort">{{Cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/15/021r-111599-idx.html |title=The Going Gets Tough, and Matt Drudge Gets Going |accessdate=2007-07-29 |publisher=The Washington Post |date=1999-11-15 |author=Howard Kurtz}}</ref>

==Controversy==
The picture attracted a lot of attention when it was released, as it was used by opponents of [[abortion]] who asserted that the baby reached through the womb and grabbed the doctor's hand, thus showing signs of life at the 21st week of pregnancy. Indeed the photograph and many of the texts which often accompany it seem to support this view, including the account of the photographer Michael Clancy:

{{Cquote2|As a doctor asked me what speed of film I was using, out of the corner of my eye I saw the uterus shake, but no one's hands were near it. It was shaking from within. Suddenly, an entire arm thrust out of the opening, then pulled back until just a little hand was showing. The doctor reached over and lifted the hand, which reacted and squeezed the doctor's finger. As if testing for strength, the doctor shook the tiny fist. Samuel held firm. I took the picture! Wow! 

It happened so fast that the nurse standing next to me asked, "What happened?" 

"The child reached out," I said.

"Oh. They do that all the time," she responded.<ref name="MichaelClancyme">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://web.archive.org/web/20021004090635/http://www.michaelclancy.com/story.html |title = Story of the "Fetal Hand Grasp" Photograph |publisher = [http://www.michaelclancy.com Michael Clancy] | accessdate = 2007-08-17 | last=Michael Clancy}} (via archive.org)</ref>}}

However, the surgeon later stated that Samuel and his mother Julie were under anesthesia and could not move.

"The baby did not reach out," Dr Bruner said. "The baby was anesthetized. The baby was not aware of what was going on."<ref name="">Davis, Robert. "Hand of a Fetus Touched the World." USA Today. 2 May 2000 (p. D8)</ref>

Clancy had become a Christian within the previous three months.<ref>[http://www.lifenews.com/2008/07/04/nat-4018/ Michael Clancy: The Photographer Whose Amazing Pro-Life Picture Changed the World], by Steven Ertelt, LifeNews.com, July 4, 2008</ref> The surgeon who operated on the mother stated that rather than the fetus' hand clutching on to his finger, he was simply pushing the fetus' arm that had suddenly jolted out of the womb back into the womb in order to finish the surgery.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/photos/medical/thehand.asp Hand of Hope: Real Photo; Inaccurate Description <!-- Bot generated title -->] Snopes.com</ref>

==Cultural references==

The event has been referred to in two medical TV series: the drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', in the episode [[Fetal Position (House)|Fetal Position]], and the sitcom ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', in the episode [[My Road to Nowhere]].
