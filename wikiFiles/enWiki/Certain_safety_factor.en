The '''Certain Safety Factor''' is the ratio of the [[lethal dose]] to 1% of population to the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] to 99% of the population (LD1/ED99). This is a better safety index than the [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] for materials that have both desirable and undesirable effects, because it factors in the ends of the spectrum where doses may be necessary to produce a response in one person but can, at the same dose, be lethal in another.

<math>\mbox{Certain safety factor} = \frac{\mathrm{LD}_{1}}{\mathrm{ED}_{99}}</math>
