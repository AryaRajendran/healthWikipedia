A '''handlebar moustache''' is a [[moustache]] with particularly lengthy and upwardly curved extremities; a shorter version is named the petit handlebar. <ref name="C.D.'s Wax">{{cite web|last=Zawalek|first=C.D.|title=C.D.'s Wax|url=http://cdswax.ca|work=manufacturer/purveyor of grooming products|publisher=C.D.'s Wax|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref> These moustache styles are named for their resemblance to the [[bicycle handlebar|handlebar]]s of a [[bicycle]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/handlebar%20moustache | title=handlebar moustache | accessdate=2011-02-23 | author=Dictionary.com Unabridged | publisher=Random House, Inc.}}</ref>  It is also known as a '''spaghetti moustache''', because of its stereotypical association with Italian men.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Layout/Includes/MIRRORNEW/ArtWin.asp?From=Archive&Source=Page&Skin=MIRRORNEW&BaseHref=PMIR%2F2010%2F09%2F28&ViewMode=HTML&PageLabel=20&EntityId=Ar01900&AppName=1|publisher=Times of India|author=Gauri Shah|title=‘MOONCH’AS GRACIAS: Salman’s Dabangglook has brought the good ‘ole moustache in the spotlight.|accessdate=2012-08-15|quote=The handle-bar a.k.a ‘spaghetti moustache’ grew in popularity thanks to Italian men.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/fashion/article/broadsheets-guide-movember|title=Broadsheet's Guide to Movember|first=Caroline|last=Clements|date=29 October 2010|publisher=Broadsheet|accessdate=2012-08-15|quote=Handlebar or Spaghetti Moustache: Curling upwards at the sides like an Italian lion tamer}}</ref>  The [[Handlebar Club]] humorously describes the style as "a hirsute appendage of the upper lip and with graspable extremities".<ref name=joynath>{{cite news|title=London’s Handlebar Club campaigns against sacking of Indian airline steward |date=16 Feb, 2008 |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshowarchive.cms?msid=2786728 |accessdate=2008-11-27|work=[[The Economic Times]]}}</ref>

==Styles==
This style is usually achieved by the use of [[moustache wax]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handlebarclub.co.uk/wax/wax.shtml|publisher=The Handlebar Club|title=The Wax FAQtor: Questions about Moustache Wax|accessdate=2011-09-21}}</ref> although [[hair gel]], a [[curling iron]], or natural curling can suffice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://handlebarmoustachelife.com/grooming-a-handlebar-moustache/grooming-a-handlebar-moustache-part-2-of-3/|publisher=Handlebar Moustache Life|title=Grooming a Handlebar Moustache (part 2 of 3)}}</ref>  The greater the curl of the extremities the more dramatic the appearance achieved.  When worn without wax or grooming, the moustache style may more closely resemble a [[walrus moustache]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://handlebarmoustachelife.com/grooming-a-handlebar-moustache/grooming-a-handlebar-moustache-part-3-of-3/|publisher=Handlebar Moustache Life|title=Grooming a Handlebar Moustache (part 3 of 3)}}</ref>  

==History==
Similar styles of moustache are quite ancient, appearing on statues and other depictions of [[Iron Age]] [[Celts]].<ref>[http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/themselves/celtsthemselves.html The Celts Themselves]</ref>  In the United States, handlebar moustaches were worn in the later part of the 19th century by [[Wild West]] figures like [[Wyatt Earp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/dating/top-10-outrageous-moustaches_3.html|title=Top 10: Outrageous Moustaches|publisher=Ask Men|first=Ryan|last=Barnett}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&dat=19931227&id=ifEaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qkcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5509,6153050|title=Handlebar moustache is a work of art to Russell|publisher=Daily News|date=Dec 27, 1993}}</ref> In Europe, handlebar moustaches were often worn by soldiers during the 18th century through roughly the World War I era.

In 1972, to win a $300 "best facial hair" prize offered by team owner [[Charlie O. Finley]], [[Oakland A's]] [[pitcher]] [[Rollie Fingers]] grew a handlebar moustache which he sported throughout his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfingers34.com/rollie-fingers-biography/|title=Biography|publisher=Rollie Fingers Official Website|accessdate=2011-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Armold|first=Elijah|date=January 25, 2007|title=A Man and His Famous Moustache: Hall of Fame reliever Rollie Fingers and his facial hair visited York Area Sports Night"|publisher=[[York Daily Record]]}}</ref>

More recently, the [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|contemporary hipster subculture]] has embraced the handlebar moustache by mocking conventional ideals of fashion, and by [[irony|ironically]] combining a highly manicured handlebar moustache with the portrayal of an unkempt appearance or a haphazardly selected clothing ensemble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/fashion/trends_500/553_hipster-trends-we-hate.html|title=Hipster Trends We Hate|publisher=Ask Men|first=Farah|last=Averill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hipster-mustache.htm|title=What is a Hipster Mustache|publisher=Wise Geek|first=D.|last=Nelson|date=14 June 2011}}</ref>
