'''Epidermodysplasia verruciformis''' (also called '''Lewandowsky-Lutz dysplasia''') is an extremely rare [[autosomal recessive]] genetic<ref name="Ramoz 2002">{{cite journal |author=Ramoz N, Rueda LA, Bouadjar B, Montoya LS, Orth G, Favre M |title=Mutations in two adjacent novel genes are associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=579–81 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12426567 |doi=10.1038/ng1044}}</ref> [[genodermatosis|hereditary skin disorder]] associated with a high risk of [[carcinoma]] of the skin.

== Genetic cause ==
The cause of the condition is an inactivating HP mutation in either the [[EVER1]] or [[EVER2]] genes, which are located adjacent to one another on [[chromosome 17]].<ref name="Ramoz 2002" /> The precise function of these genes is not yet fully understood, but they play a role in regulating the distribution of zinc in the cell nucleus. Zinc is a necessary cofactor for many viral proteins, and that the activity of EVER1/EVER2 complex appears to restrict the access of viral proteins to cellular zinc stores, limiting their growth.<ref name="EVER Zn">{{cite journal |author=Lazarczyk M, Favre M |title=Role of Zn2+ ions in host-virus interactions |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=82 |issue=23 |pages=11486–94 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18787005 |pmc=2583646 |doi=10.1128/JVI.01314-08}}</ref>

Other genes have also been rarely been associated with this condition. These include the ras homolog gene family member H.<ref name=Crequer2012>Crequer A, Troeger A, Patin E, Ma CS, Picard C, Pedergnana V, Fieschi C, Lim A, Abhyankar A, Gineau L, Mueller-Fleckenstein I, Schmidt M, Taieb A, Krueger J, Abel L, Tangye SG, Orth G, Williams DA, Casanova JL, Jouanguy E (2012) Human RHOH deficiency causes T cell defects and susceptibility to EV-HPV infections. J Clin Invest  pii: 62949. doi: 10.1172/JCI62949. </ref>

== Diagnosis ==
Clinical diagnostic features are lifelong eruptions of [[pityriasis versicolor]]-like macules, flat wart-like papules and development of cutaneous carcinomas.

Patients present with flat, slightly scaly, red-brown macules on the face, neck and body, recurring especially around the penial area, or verruca-like papillomatous lesions, seborrheic keratosis-like lesions, and pinkish-red plane papules on the hands, upper and lower extremities, and face. The benign form of EV presents with only flat, wart-like lesions over the body, whereas the malignant form shows a higher rate of polymorphic skin lesions and development of multiple [[skin|cutaneous]] [[tumor]]s.

Generally, cutaneous lesions are disseminated over the body, but there are some cases with only a few lesions which are limited to one extremity.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lowy DR, Androphy EJ |chapter=Warts |editor=Freedberg IM, Eisen AZ, Wolff K, ''et al'' |edition=6th |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |year=2003 |pages=2119–2131 |title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine |isbn=978-0-07-138076-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pereira de Oliveira WR, Carrasco S, Neto CF, Rady P, Tyring SK |title=Nonspecific cell-mediated immunity in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis HPV |journal=The Journal of Dermatology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=203–9 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12692356 |url=http://www.dermatol.or.jp/Journal/JD/2003/030030203.html}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
A totally effective treatment method against EV has not yet been found. Several treatments have been suggested, and [[acitretin]] 0.5–1&nbsp;mg/day for 6 months’ duration is the most effective treatment owing to antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects.

[[Interferon]]s can also be used effectively together with [[retinoid]]s.

[[Cimetidine]] was reported to be effective because of its depressing [[mitogen]]-induced [[lymphocyte]] proliferation and [[Regulatory T cell]] activity features. A report by Oliveira ''et al.'' showed that cimetidine was ineffective. Hayashi et al. applied topical [[calcipotriol]] to a patient with a successful result.

As mentioned, various treatment methods are offered against EV; however, most importantly, education of the patient, early diagnosis and excision of the tumoral lesions take preference to prevent the development of cutaneous tumors.

== Notable cases ==
In March 2007, a Romanian man named Ion Toader was diagnosed with this condition.<ref>{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Allen |date=12 March 2007 |title=Missionary encounters extremely bizarre skin condition in Eastern Europe |work=Beware of the Blog |publisher=[[WFMU]] |url=http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/03/missionary_enco.html |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> A patient of dermatologist Carmen Madeleine Curea, his pictures appeared on numerous blogs and Romanian press sources.

In November 2007, a new video of a 34-year-old Indonesian man named Dede Koswara with a similar disease appeared on the internet.<ref>{{cite news |date=22 November 2007 |title=The man who looks like a tree |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=76668 |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> His story has appeared in the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] series "My Shocking Story" (''[[Extraordinary People (2005 TV series)|Extraordinary People]]'' on UK's [[five (channel)|Five]]) in the episode "Half Man Half Tree".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/myshockingstory/halfman/index.shtml |title=Half Man Half Tree |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> And then on August 12, 2008, Dede Koswara's story was the subject of an ABC's Medical Mystery episode entitled "Tree Man".<ref>{{cite web|title="Tree Man" Medical Mystery|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video?id=5566524|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 December 2012|date=15 August 2008}}</ref> 

On 26 August 2008, Dede returned home following surgery to remove {{Convert|6|kg|0|abbr=on}} of warts from his body.<ref name=warts>{{cite journal |author=[[Reuters]] |date=28 August 2008 |title=Indonesia's 'tree man' comes home after treatment |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-on-treeman28-2008aug28,0,3563028.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=6 August 2009 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> The surgery consisted of three steps:

* Removal of the thick carpet of warts and massive horns on his hands. 
* Removal of the smaller warts on his head, torso, and feet.
* Covering of the hands with grafted skin.

In all, 95 percent of the warts were removed.<ref name=warts /> The surgery was documented by the Discovery Channel and TLC in the episode "Treeman: Search for the Cure."{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} However, his warts have returned and it appears he will need two surgeries a year for the rest of his life to keep them at bay.<ref>{{cite news |first=Telly |last=Nathalia |coauthors=[[Reuters]] |date=20 December 2008 |title='Tree man's' warts growing again |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24826865-12335,00.html |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>  The Discovery Channel funded a blood analysis and found he lacked an immune system antigen to fight yeast infection. He was offered to have more tests run to determine whether it is treatable, and the doctor was fairly optimistic, but he refused the treatment.

In 2009, the Discovery Channel episode "Treeman Meets Treeman" reported on another Indonesian man, from the same region as Dede, who also has the disease and was given a similar treatment for it. Thus far, his treatment seems to have worked better.

According to The Jakarta Post, Dede underwent the first of a series of new surgical procedures to remove the regrown warts in the spring of 2011. Surgery has, however, proven to be a temporary solution for Dede as the warts continue to reemerge. He has thus undergone three surgical operations since his major surgery in 2008, which was covered by the Discovery channel. At the end of December 2010, two doctors from Japan, affiliated with the Japanese Society for Complementary and Alternative Medicine came and brought Dede alternative medicine in powder form, made from  coix seeds, or [[Job's Tears]]. The medicine is still undergoing a lab test.<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/13/%E2%80%98tree-man%E2%80%99-undergoes-2hour-surgery-remove-warts.html</ref>

==Television==
A character with epidermodysplasia verruciformis was profiled on season 5, episode 20 of ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' in 2009.

A similar case was featured on ''Grey's Anatomy'' [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|season 7]] in 2010.<ref> {{cite news | first = Meg | last = Marinis | title = Superfreak | date = 2010-10-07 | url = http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy/medical-case-file/ThemeGallery/579093 | work = [[American Broadcasting Company/ABC.com]] | accessdate = 2010-12-21}}</ref>

Additionally, a similar character was featured in ''[[C.I.D. (India TV series)|C.I.D]]'' in episode no. 797, "Raaz Chalte Pedh Ka" on February 3, 2012
