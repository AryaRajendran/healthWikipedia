The '''UCL Institute of Neurology''' is an institute within the Faculty of Brain Sciences of [[University College London|University College London (UCL)]] and is located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=home/> Together with the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]], an adjacent facility with which it cooperates closely, the Institute forms a major centre for teaching, training and research in neurology and allied clinical and basic neurosciences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/britains-best-hospitals-a-patients-guide-798352.html|title=Britain's best hospitals: A patients' guide|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=The Independent|date=20 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brt.org.uk/the-institute-of-neurology-ion|title=World-class research|accessdate=20 September 2010|publisher=The Brain Research Trust }}</ref>

The Institute has a staff of around 500, an annual turnover of £33 million and occupies around 6,451 sq m of laboratory and office space.<ref name=about/> Four of the 12 most highly-cited authors in neuroscience and behaviour in the world are currently based at the Institute.<ref name=about/> The Institute holds active grants for research into a wide range of neurological conditions, including movement disorders, [[multiple sclerosis]], [[epilepsy]], [[brain tumour]], [[stroke]] and [[brain injury]], muscle and nerve disorders, [[cognitive dysfunction]] and [[dementia]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NQnh4PU9X40C&pg=PR13&dq=Institute+of+Neurology&hl=en&ei=ScasTfeEEoz4sgb08ZSECg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Institute%20of%20Neurology&f=false |title=Neurology: A Queen Square Textbook|author=Charles Clarke, Robin Howard, Martin Rossor and Simon D.

==History==
[[File:NationalNeurologyHospital.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]]]]

The Institute of Neurology was established in 1950.<ref name=home/> It merged with UCL in 1997, becoming the UCL Institute of Neurology.<ref name=home/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/22/highereducation.universitymergers|title=The merger and the man|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 October 2002}}</ref>

In November 2002, a team of researchers at the Institute led by Professor John Collinge published the results of a study which showed that the number of cases of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease|CJD]] caused by the consumption of [[BSE]]-infected beef may have been higher than previously calculated and that BSE, in addition to causing [[variant CJD]] (vCJD), may also have caused some cases of "sporadic" CJD.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2521883.stm|title=BSE linked to further CJD cases|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=28 November 2002}}</ref> In February 2004, a team of researchers at the Institute led by Tania Singer published research showing that it is possible for one human to feel another’s pain and that the same regions of the brain are activated in the empathizer and the empathisee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1024500.ece|title=Love means that you really do feel each other's pain|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=The Times|date=20 February 2004}}</ref> In July 2005, a team of researchers at the Institute led by Davina Bristow published the results of research funded by the [[Wellcome Trust]] in ''Current Biology'' which demonstrated that parts of the human brain are temporarily "switched off" when blinking.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4714067.stm|title=Blink and you really do 'miss it' |accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=25 July 2005}}</ref> In September 2005, a team of researchers at the Institute led by Victor Tybulewicz at the National Institute for Medical Research and Professor Elizabeth Fisher from the Institute published the results of a study in which they had been able to introduce most of a human chromosome into mice, producing the most successful recreation of [[Down's syndrome]] to date.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4268226.stm|title=Down's syndrome recreated in mice|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=22 September 2005}}</ref> In August 2007, a team of researchers at the Institute led by Henrik Ehrsson published research in ''Science'' which was the first to describe how it is possible to use cameras to trick the human brain into thinking that a person is elsewhere in a room than they really are.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12531-outofbody-experiences-are-all-in-the-mind.html|title=Out-of-body experiences are 'all in the mind' |accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=New Scientist|date=23 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-08-23-80536913_x.htm|title=Scientists study out-of-body experiences|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=USA Today|date=23 August 2007}}</ref>

In February 2011, a team of researchers at the Institute led by Nick Wood published the results of a genetic study which had identified five new genes linked to [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/02/01/scientists-new-parkinsons-genes/|title=Scientists Find 5 New Parkinson's Genes|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=Fox News|date=1 February 2011}}</ref>
