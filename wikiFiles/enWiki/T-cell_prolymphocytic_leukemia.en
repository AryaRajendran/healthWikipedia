'''T-cell-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL)''' is a mature [[T-cell]] [[leukemia]] with aggressive behavior and predilection for [[blood]], [[bone marrow]], [[lymph nodes]], [[liver]], [[spleen]], and [[skin]] involvement.<ref name="who1">{{cite book |author=Elaine Sarkin Jaffe, Nancy Lee Harris, World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Harald Stein, J.W.

It represents 2% of all small lymphocytic leukemias in adults.<ref name="mat1">{{cite journal |author=Matutes E, Brito-Babapulle V, Swansbury J, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical and laboratory features of 78 cases of T-prolymphocytic leukemia |journal=Blood |volume=78 |issue=12 |pages=3269–74 |year=1991 |pmid=1742486 |doi=}}</ref> Other names include ''T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia'', ''"knobby" type of T-cell leukemia'', and ''T-prolymphocytic leukemia/T-cell lymphocytic leukemia.''<ref name="who1"/>

==Etiology==
It is postulated that the originating cell line for this disease is a mature (post-[[thymus|thymic]]) T-cell.<ref name="who1"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients typically have systemic disease at presentation, including [[hepatosplenomegaly]], generalized [[lymphadenopathy]], and skin infiltrates.<ref name="who1"/> 

Due to the systemic nature of this disease, leukemic cells can be found in peripheral blood, [[lymph nodes]], [[bone marrow]], [[spleen]], [[liver]], [[skin]].<ref name="who1"/>  A high lymphocyte count (> 100 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L)along with [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] are common findings. [[HTLV-1]] serologies are negative, and serum [[immunoglobin]]s are within normal limits with no [[paraproteins]] present.<ref name="who1"/>

==Morphology==

In the peripheral blood, T-PLL consists of medium-sized [[lymphocytes]] with single [[nucleoli]] and [[basophilic]] [[cytoplasm]] with occasional blebs or projections. The [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] are usually round to oval in shape, with occasional patients having cells with a more irregular nuclear outline that is similar to the cerebriform nuclear shape seen in [[Sézary syndrome]].<ref name="mat2">{{cite journal |author=Matutes E, Garcia Talavera J, O'Brien M, Catovsky D |title=The morphological spectrum of T-prolymphocytic leukaemia |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=111–24 |year=1986 |month=September |pmid=3489482 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb07579.x|url=}}</ref> A small cell variant comprises 20% of all T-PLL cases, and the Sézary cell-like (cerebriform) variant is seen in 5% of cases.<ref name="mat2"/> 

Marrow involvement is typically diffuse with morphology similar to what is observed in peripheral blood.<ref name="who1"/> In the [[spleen]], the leukemic cell infiltrate both the [[red pulp]] and [[white pulp]], and [[lymph node]] involvement is typically diffuse through the [[paracortex]].<ref name="who1"/> Skin infiltrates are seen in 20% of patients, and the infiltrates are usually dense and confined to the [[dermis]] and around the skin appendages.<ref name="mat1"/>

==Molecular findings==
===Immunophenotype===
T-PLL has the [[immunophenotype]] of a mature (post-thymic) T-lymphocyte, and the [[neoplastic]] cells are typically positive for pan-T antigens [[CD2]], [[CD3]], and [[CD7]] and negative for [[TdT]] and [[CD1a]]. The immunophenotype [[CD4]]+/[[CD8]]- is present in 60% of cases, the CD4+/CD8+ immunophenotype is present in 25%, and the CD4-/CD8+ immunophenotype is present in 15% of cases.<ref name="mat1"/>

===Genetic findings===
Clonal TCR gene rearrangements for the γ and δ chains are typically found. The most frequent chromosomal abnormality is the inversion of chromosome 14, specifically inv 14(q11;q32). This is found in 80% of cases, while 10% of cases show a reciprocal translocation of [[chromosome 14]] (t(14;14)(q11;q32)).<ref name="bri1">{{cite journal |author=Brito-Babapulle V, Catovsky D |title=Inversions and tandem translocations involving chromosome 14q11 and 14q32 in T-prolymphocytic leukemia and T-cell leukemias in patients with ataxia telangiectasia |journal=Cancer Genet.

==Treatment==
Most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia require immediate treatment.<ref name="pmid11535503">{{cite journal |author=Dearden CE, Matutes E, Cazin B, ''et al.'' |title=High remission rate in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia with CAMPATH-1H |journal=Blood |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=1721–6 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11535503 |doi= 10.1182/blood.V98.6.1721|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11535503}}</ref>  

T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is difficult to treat, and it does not respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs.<ref name="pmid11535503" />  Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients:  [[purine analogues]] (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), [[chlorambucil]], and various forms of combination [[chemotherapy regimens]], including [[CHOP|cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone]] (CHOP), cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone (COP), and vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin (VAPEC-B).  

[[Alemtuzumab]] (Campath), an anti-CD52 [[monoclonal antibody]] that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.<ref name="pmid11535503" />  In one study of previously treated people with T-PLL, people who had a complete response to alemtuzumab survived a median of 16 months after treatment.<ref name="pmid11535503" /> 

Some patients who successfully respond to treatment also undergo [[stem cell transplantation]] to consolidate the response.<ref name="pmid11535503" />

==Prognosis==
T-PLL is an aggressive disease, and patients are not expected to live normal lifespans.  Before the recent introduction of better treatments, such as [[alemtuzumab]], the median survival time was 7.5 months after diagnosis.<ref name="pmid11535503" />  More recently, some patients have survived five years and more, although the median survival is still low.

==Epidemiology==
About four men are diagnosed with this disease for every three women.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Matutes Estella | year = 1998 | title = T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a rare variant of mature post-thymic T-cell leukemias, has distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics and a poor prognosis | url = http://www.moffitt.org/moffittapps/ccj/v5n1/article2.html | journal = Cancer Control Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 }}</ref>  Despite its overall rarity, it is also the most common type of mature [[T cell]] leukemia.<ref name="pmid15716243">{{cite journal |author=Valbuena JR, Herling M, Admirand JH, Padula A, Jones D, Medeiros LJ |title=T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia involving extramedullary sites |journal=Am.
