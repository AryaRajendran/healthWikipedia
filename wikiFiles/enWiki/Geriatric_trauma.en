'''Geriatric trauma'''  refers to a [[trauma (medicine)|traumatic]] injury that occurs to an [[Old age|elderly]] person. The three prevailing causes of traumatic death in the elderly are [[Falling (accident)|falls]] (which account for 40% of traumatic death in this age group), [[traffic collision]]s and [[burn]]s.<ref name=pre/><ref name=ATLS2008>{{cite book|first=American College of Surgeons|last=Committee on Trauma|authorlink=American College of Surgeons|title=ATLS: Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors|publisher=American College of Surgeons|location=Chicago|edition=8th|chapter=Chapter 10: Extremes of Age|pages=243–74|year=2008|isbn=978-1-880696-31-6}}</ref>

==Biomechanics of injury==
A progressive decline in [[central nervous system]] function leads to a loss of [[proprioception]], [[Equilibrioception|balance]] and overall [[motor coordination]], as well as a reduction in [[eye–hand coordination]], [[Mental chronometry|reaction time]] and an unsteady [[gait]].<ref name=ATLS2008/> These degenerative changes are often accompanied by [[osteoarthritis]] (degenerative joint disease), which leads to a reduction in the [[range of motion]] of the head, neck and extremities. Furthermore, elderly people frequently take multiple [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]] for control of various diseases and conditions. The side effects of some of these medications may either predispose to injury, or may cause a minor trauma to result in a much more severe condition. For example, a person taking [[warfarin]] (Coumadin) and/or [[clopidogrel]] (Plavix) may experience a life-threatening [[intracranial hemorrhage]] after sustaining a relatively minor [[closed head injury]], as a result of the defect in the [[Hemostasis|hemostatic mechanism]] caused by such medications. The combined effects of these changes greatly predisposes elderly people to traumatic injury. Both the incidence of falls and the severity of associated complications increase with advancing age.<ref name=ATLS2008/>

==Physiologic differences in the elderly==
Virtually all organ systems experience a progressive decline in function as a result of the [[ageing|aging]] process.<ref name="pre">{{cite book |author=Grande, Christopher M.; Søreide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=441–50|isbn=0-8247-0537-8}}</ref><ref name="brady">{{cite book |author=Campbell, John Creighton|title=ITLS|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2008 |pages=279–87 |isbn=0-13-237982-1}}</ref> One example is a decline in [[circulatory system]] function caused in part by thickening of the [[cardiac muscle]]. This can lead to [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] or [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name="btls">{{cite book|author=Campbell, John Creighton|title=Basic trauma life support for paramedics and other advanced providers|publisher=Brady/Prentice Hall Health|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|year=2000|pages=231–8|isbn=0-13-084584-1}}</ref><ref name=Peitzman2008>{{cite book|editor=Peitzman AB, Rhodes M, Schwab CW, Yealy DM, Fabian TC|title=The Trauma Manual|edition=3rd|year=2008|chapter=Chapter 48: Geriatric Trauma|pages=524–32|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-7817-6275-8|url=http://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Manual-Surgery-Lippincott-Formerly/dp/0781762758}}</ref>

[[Atrophy]] of the brain begins to accelerate at around seventy years of age,<ref name=Peitzman2008/> which leads to a significant reduction in brain mass. Since the skull does not decrease in size with the brain, there is significant space between the two when this occurs which puts the elderly at a higher risk of a [[subdural hematoma]] after sustaining a closed head injury.<ref name="brady"/> The reduction of brain size can lead to issues with [[Visual perception|eyesight]], [[cognition]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]].<ref name=Peitzman2008/>

==Epidemiology==
Elderly people are the most rapidly growing [[Demographics|demographic]] in [[Developed country|developed nations]]. Although they sustain traumatic injury less commonly than [[Pediatric trauma|children]] and young adults, the [[mortality rate]] for trauma in the elderly is higher than in younger people.<ref name=ATLS2008/>
