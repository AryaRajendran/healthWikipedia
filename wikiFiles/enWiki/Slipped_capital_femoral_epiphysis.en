'''Slipped capital femoral epiphysis''' (SCFE, also known as "Slipped upper femoral epiphysis") is a [[medical]] term referring to a fracture through the physis (the growth plate), which results in slippage of the overlying epiphysis.  The head of the [[femur]], called the capital, should sit squarely on the femoral neck.  Abnormal movement along the growth plate results in the slip. 

Often this condition will present in obese [[adolescent]] [[males]], especially young black males, and sometimes [[females]], with an insidious onset of thigh or knee pain with a painful limp. Hip motion will be limited, particularly internal rotation.

SCFE (sometimes pronounced "skiffy") is a common cause of hip and knee pain in children ages 7 and 11 caused usually during a growth spurt. It is the most common hip disorder in adolescence. It is the displacement of the upper femoral [[epiphysis]].  Slippage occurs through the growth plate (epiphysis between the head and neck of the bone).  The femoral epiphysis remains in the acetabulum (hip socket), while the metaphysis (end of the femur) move in an anterior direction with external rotation.

== Classification ==
* Atypical
* Typical

* Stable
* Unstable

* Acute
* Chronic

== Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms are waddling gait, loss of motion in the hip joint, externally rotated foot, pain in the knee / groin / hip and shortening of the hip.  Up to 40 percent of cases involve slippage on both sides.<ref name=SCFE_family>{{cite journal|last=Loder|first=RT|title=Slipped capital femoral epiphysis.|journal=American family physician|date=1|year=1998|month=May|volume=57|issue=9|pages=2135–42, 2148–50|pmid=9606305|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/0501/p2135.html|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>  If a SCFE occurs on the other side, it typically happens within one year after the first SCFE.<ref name=PrevalencePathNatHx/>  About 20 percent of all cases include a SCFE on both sides at the time of presentation.<ref name=Medscape>{{cite web|last=Walter|first=Kevin|title=Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/91596-overview#showall|work=WebMD, LLC|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> 
The knee starts to hurt about 2-4 months before the actual hip goes{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.  The pain in the knee can fluctuate.

==Cause==
In general, SCFE is caused by increased force applied across the ephysis, or a decrease in the resistance within the physis to shearing.<ref name=PrevalencePathNatHx>{{cite journal|last=Novais|first=Eduardo N.|coauthors=Millis, Michael B.|title=Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Natural History|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research®|year=2012|month=December|volume=470|issue=12|pages=3432–3438|doi=10.1007/s11999-012-2452-y|pmid=23054509|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>  This may be caused by endocrine disorders, [[obesity]], femoral or acetabular retroversion, and coxa profunda.<ref name=PrevalencePathNatHx/>  The [[Centers for Disease Control]] offers a [[body mass index]] (BMI) calculator to help determine a person's risk for obesity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Body Mass Index|url=http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> 

The disorder can sometimes be associated with endocrinopathies such as [[thyroid]] problems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Pathophysiology==
SCFE is a [[Salter-Harris fractures|Salter-Harris type 1 fracture]] through the proximal femoral physis. Stress around the hip causes a shear force to be applied at the growth plate.  While trauma has a role in the manifestation of the fracture, an intrinsic weakness in the physeal cartilage also is present.  The almost exclusive incidence of SCFE during the adolescent growth spurt indicates a hormonal role. Obesity is another key predisposing factor in the development of SCFE.

The fracture occurs at the hypertrophic zone of the physeal cartilage.  Stress on the hip causes the epiphysis to move posteriorly and medially. By convention, position and alignment in SCFE is described by referring to the relationship of the proximal fragment (capital femoral epiphysis) to the normal distal fragment (femoral neck). Because the physis has yet to close, the blood supply to the epiphysis still should be derived from the femoral neck; however, this late in childhood, the supply is tenuous and frequently lost after the fracture occurs. Manipulation of the fracture frequently results in osteonecrosis and chondrolysis because of the tenuous nature of the blood supply.  

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is a combination of clinical suspicion plus radiological investigation.  Children with a SCFE experience a decrease in their range of motion, and are often unable to complete hip flexion or fully rotate the hip inward.<ref name=AAOS>{{cite web|last=Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America|title=Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00052|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>  20-50% of SCFE are missed or misdiagnosed on their first presentation to a medical facility.  This is because the common symptom is knee pain.  This is referred pain from the hip.  The knee is investigated and found to be normal.

The diagnosis requires x-rays of the pelvis, with anteriorposterior (AP) and frog-leg lateral views.<ref name=AFP_Dx_Management>{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=David|title=Slipped capital femoral epiphysis: diagnosis and management.|journal=American family physician|date=2010 Aug 1|volume=82|issue=3|pages=258–62|pmid=20672790|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0801/p258.html|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>  The appearance of the head of the femur in relation to the shaft likens that of a "melting ice cream cone".  The severity of the disease can be measured using the [[Southwick angle]].

Consultation with an [[orthopaedic surgeon]] is necessary to repair this problem. Untreated cases can result in serious growth abnormalities and permanent disability.

== Treatment ==
The disease can be treated with external in-situ pinning or open reduction and pinning.  The risk of reducing this fracture is disruption of the blood supply. Some also advocate pinning the unaffected side prophylactically.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Once SCFE is suspected, the patient should be non [[weight bearing]] and remain on strict [[bed rest]]. It should be regarded as an orthopaedic emergency as further slippage may result in occlusion of the blood supply and avascular necrosis (risk 25%). Almost all treatment requires surgery, which usually involves the placement of one or two pins into the femoral head to prevent further slippage.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kuzyk|first=Paul R.|coauthors=Kim, YJ; Millis, MB|title=Surgical management of healed slipped capital femoral epiphysis.|journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|year=2011|month=Nov|volume=19|issue=11|pages=667–77|pmid=22052643|url=http://www.jaaos.org.proxy.westernu.edu/content/19/11/667.long|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>  The chances of a slippage occurring in the other hip are 20% within 18 months of diagnosis of the first slippage and consequently the opposite unaffected femur may also require pinning.

It has been shown in the past that attempts to correct the slippage by moving the head back into its correct position can cause the bone to die.  Therefore the head of the femur is usually pinned 'as is'. A small incision is made in the outer side of the upper thigh and metal pins are placed through the femoral neck and into the head of the femur. A dressing covers the wound.

== Complications ==
Failure to treat the condition may lead to: [[avascular necrosis]] (death of the femoral head), degenerative hip disease, gait abnormalities and chronic pain.  SCFE is associated with a greater risk of [[Osteoarthritis|arthritis]] of the hip joint later in life.<ref name=PubMedHealth />
