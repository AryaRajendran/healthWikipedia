'''Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia''' ('''CIN'''), also known as '''cervical dysplasia''' and '''cervical interstitial neoplasia''', is the potentially [[premalignant]] transformation and abnormal growth ([[dysplasia]]) of [[squamous]] cells on the surface of the [[cervix]].<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book| author=Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N.| year = 2007 | title = Robbins Basic Pathology| edition = 8th | publisher = Saunders Elsevier| pages=718–721 | isbn= 978-1-4160-2973-1}}</ref> CIN is not cancer, and is usually curable.<ref name=womensHealthChanel>[http://www.womenshealthchannel.com/cervicaldysplasia/index.shtml Cervical Dysplasia: Overview, Risk Factors]</ref> Most cases of CIN remain stable, or are eliminated by the host's [[immune system]] without intervention. However a small percentage of cases progress to become [[cervical cancer]], usually [[Squamous cell carcinoma#Vagina and cervix|cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)]], if left untreated.<!--

--> The major cause of CIN is chronic [[infection]] of the cervix with the sexually transmitted [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), especially the high-risk HPV types 16 or 18. Over 100 types of HPV have been identified. About a dozen of these types appear to cause cervical dysplasia and may lead to the development of cervical cancer. Other types cause [[wart]]s.

The earliest microscopic change corresponding to CIN is [[dysplasia]] of the [[epithelium|epithelial]] or surface lining of the [[cervix]], which is essentially undetectable by the woman. Cellular changes associated with HPV infection, such as [[koilocyte]]s, are also commonly seen in CIN. CIN is usually discovered by a screening test, the [[pap smear|Papanicolaou or "Pap" smear]]. The purpose of this test is to detect potentially precancerous changes. Pap smear results may be reported using the [[Bethesda System]]. An abnormal [[Pap smear]] result may lead to a recommendation for [[colposcopy]] of the cervix, during which the cervix is examined under magnification. A [[biopsy]] is taken of any abnormal appearing areas. Cervical dysplasia can be diagnosed by biopsy.

==Risk factors==
Some risk factors that have been found to be important in developing CIN are:<ref name=Robbins/>
* Women who become infected by a "high risk" type of HPV, such as 16, 18, 31, or 45
* Women who are immunodeficient
* Women who give birth before age 17

A number of risk factors have been shown to increase a woman's likelihood of developing CIN,<ref name="Murthy2000">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00008469-200002000-00002 | author = Murthy NS, Mathew A. | title = Risk factors for pre-cancerous lesions of the cervix | journal = European Journal of Cancer Prevention | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–14 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10777005 | id = 10777005 }}</ref> including poor [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], multiple sexual partners, lack of [[condom]] use, and [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]].

==Classification==
Depending on several factors such as the type of HPV and the location of the infection, CIN can start in any of the three stage, and can either progress, or regress.<ref name=Robbins/>

CIN is classified in grades:

| Normal cervical epithelium

| '''CIN 1''' (Grade I)
| [[low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion|LSIL]]<ref name="Park">{{cite journal |author=Park J, Sun D, Genest D, Trivijitsilp P, Suh I, Crum C |title=Coexistence of low and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix: morphologic progression or multiple papillomaviruses? |journal=Gynecol Oncol |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=386–91 |year=1998|pmid=9790792 |doi=10.1006/gyno.1998.5100}}</ref>
| The least risky type, represents only mild [[dysplasia]], or abnormal cell growth.<ref name="Agorastos"/> It is confined to the basal 1/3 of the epithelium. This corresponds to infection with HPV, and typically will be cleared by immune response in a year or so, though can take several years to clear.

| '''CIN 2/3'''

| '''CIN 2''' (Grade II)

| '''CIN 3''' (Grade III)

| Severe dysplasia that spans more than 2/3 of the epithelium, and may involve the full thickness. This lesion may sometimes also be referred to as cervical [[carcinoma in situ]].

==Treatment==
People with CIN 1 does not require treatment if it lasts less than 2 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wright TC|first=Jr|coauthors=Massad, LS; Dunton, CJ; Spitzer, M; Wilkinson, EJ; Solomon, D; 2006 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology-sponsored Consensus, Conference|title=2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ.|journal=Journal of lower genital tract disease|date=2007 Oct|volume=11|issue=4|pages=223-39|pmid=17917567}}</ref> Treatment for higher grade CIN involves removal or destruction of the neoplastic cervical cells by [[cryocautery]], [[electrocautery]], [[Cauterization|laser cautery]], [[loop electrical excision procedure]] (LEEP), or [[cervical conization]]. Therapeutic [[HPV vaccine|vaccines]] are currently undergoing clinical trials. The lifetime recurrence rate of CIN is about 20%,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} but it isn't clear what proportion of these cases are new infections rather than recurrences of the original infection.

==Prognosis==
It used to be thought that cases of CIN progressed through these stages toward cancer in a linear fashion.<ref name="Agorastos"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hillemanns P, Wang X, Staehle S, Michels W, Dannecker C |title=Evaluation of different treatment modalities for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN): CO(2) laser vaporization, photodynamic therapy, excision and vulvectomy |journal=Gynecol Oncol |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=271–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16169064|doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2005.08.012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rapp L, Chen J |title=The papillomavirus E6 proteins|journal=Biochim Biophys Acta |volume=1378 |issue=1 |pages=F1–19 |year=1998 |pmid=9739758}}</ref>

However most CIN spontaneously regress. Left untreated, about 70% of CIN-1 will regress within one year, and 90% will regress within two years.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Bosch FX, Burchell AN, Schiffman M, Giuliano AR, de Sanjose S, Bruni L, Tortolero-Luna G, Kjaer SK, Muñoz N | title = Epidemiology and natural history of human papillomavirus infections and type-specific implications in cervical neoplasia | journal = Vaccine | volume = 26 | issue = Supplement 10 | pages = K1–16 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18847553 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.05.064 | id = 18847553 }}</ref> About 50% of CIN 2 will regress within 2 years without treatment.

Progression to [[cervical carcinoma in situ]] (CIS) occurs in approximately 11% of CIN1 and 22% of CIN2. Progression to invasive cancer occurs in approximately 1% of CIN1, 5% in CIN2 and at least 12% in CIN3.<ref name=williams2008>Section 4 Gynecologic Oncology > Chapter 29. Preinvasive Lesions of the Lower Genital Tract > Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia in:{{cite book |author=Bradshaw, Karen D.; Schorge, John O.; Schaffer, Joseph; Lisa M. Halvorson; Hoffman, Barbara G.|title=Williams' Gynecology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-07-147257-6 |oclc=|doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Progression to cancer typically takes 15 (3 to 40) years. Also, evidence suggests that cancer can occur without first detectably progressing through these stages and that a high grade intraepithelial neoplasia can occur without first existing as a lower grade.<ref name=Robbins/><ref name="Agorastos"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Monnier-Benoit S, Dalstein V, Riethmuller D, Lalaoui N, Mougin C, Prétet J |title=Dynamics of HPV16 DNA load reflect the natural history of cervical HPV-associated lesions | journal=J Clin Virol |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=270–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16214397|doi=10.1016/j.jcv.2005.09.001}}</ref>

It is thought that the higher risk HPV infections, have the ability to inactivate [[tumor suppressor genes]] such as the [[p53]] gene and the [[Retinoblastoma protein|RB]] gene, thus allowing the infected cells to grow unchecked and accumulate successive mutations, eventually leading to cancer.<ref name=Robbins/>

==Epidemiology==
Between 250,000 and 1 million American women are diagnosed with CIN annually. Women can develop CIN at any age, however, women generally develop it between the ages of 25 to 35.<ref name=Robbins/>
