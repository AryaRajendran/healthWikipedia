==Other work==
He is on the list of Distinguished Supporters of the [[British Humanist Association]].<ref>[http://www.humanism.org.uk/about/people/distinguished-supporters Humanism.org - distinguished supporters]</ref> Tallis is also a Patron of [[Dignity in Dying]]. On 15 September 2010, Tallis, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in [[The Guardian]], stating their opposition to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s state visit to the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=Letters: Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 September 2010 | location=London | date=15 September 2010}}</ref> 

In a 2010 Interview with author Jesse Horn, Tallis expressed that he is a optimistic humanist and an atheist. “Given that I was born a few months after Auschwitz was liberated, it is hardly surprising that I have a strong sense of the evil that humans – individually and collectively – do. My position is that of cautious and chastened optimism, a belief that, if we are ourselves well-treated by others, we will usually treat others reasonably well.”<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.azalert.com/mogollonconnection/?p=791|title=Chasing Demons|work=The Mogollon Connection|accessdate=21 March 2012 }}</ref>
