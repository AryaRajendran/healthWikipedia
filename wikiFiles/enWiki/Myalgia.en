'''Myalgia''', or [[muscle]] [[pain]], is a symptom of many diseases and disorders. The most common causes are the overuse or over-stretching of a muscle or group of muscles. Myalgia without a traumatic history is often due to [[virus|viral infection]]s. Longer-term myalgias may be indicative of a [[metabolic myopathy]], some nutritional deficiencies or [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].

==Causes==
The most common causes of myalgia are overuse, [[injury]] or [[Strain (injury)|strain]]. However, myalgia can also be caused by diseases, disorders, medications, or as a response to a [[vaccination]]. It is also a sign of acute rejection after heart transplant surgery.

The most common causes are: 
* Injury or trauma, including sprains, hematoma
* Overuse: using a muscle too much, too often, including protecting a separate injury
* Chronic tension 
Muscle pain occurs with:
* [[Rhabdomyolysis]], associated with:
**[[Biological virus|Viral]]
**[[Compression injury]]
**Drug-related, esp [[fibrates]] and [[statins]], occ [[ACE inhibitors]], [[cocaine]], some retro-viral drugs
**[[Hypokalemia|Severe potassium deficiency]] 
* [[Fibromyalgia]]
* Infections, including:
** [[Influenza]] (the flu)
** [[Lyme disease]]
** [[Malaria]]
** [[Toxoplasmosis]]
** [[Dengue Fever]]
** [[Hemorrhagic fever]]
** [[Muscle abscess]]
** [[Polio]]
** [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]
** [[Trichinosis]] (roundworm)
*Auto-immune disorders, including:
** [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]]
** [[Polymyalgia rheumatica]]
** [[Polymyositis]]
** [[Dermatomyositis]]
** [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (this is neurologic pain localised to myotome)

===Overuse===
Overuse of a muscle is using it too much, too soon and/or too often.<ref name=MedlinePlus>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003178.htm MedlinePlus]</ref>  Examples are:
*[[Repetitive strain injury]].

===Injury===
The most common causes of myalgia by [[injury]] are: [[sprains]] and [[strain (injury)]].<ref name=MedlinePlus/>

===Autoimmune===
[[Multiple sclerosis]] (neurologic pain interpreted as muscular), Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, [[Myositis]], [[Lupus erythematosus]], [[Familial Mediterranean fever]], [[Polyarteritis nodosa]], [[Devic's disease]], [[Morphea]], [[Sarcoidosis]]

===Metabolic defect===
[[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency]], [[Conn's syndrome]], [[Adrenal insufficiency]], [[Hyperthyroidism]],
[[Hypothyroidism]]

===Other===
[[Chronic fatigue syndrome]] aka Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, [[Ehlers Danlos Syndrome]], [[Hypokalemia]], [[Exercise intolerance]], [[Mastocytosis]], [[Peripheral neuropathy]], [[Eosinophilia myalgia syndrome]], [[Fibromyalgia]], [[Barcoo Fever]], [[Herpes]], [[Hemochromatosis]] aka Iron Overload Disorder, [[Delayed onset muscle soreness]], [[AIDS]], [[HIV]], [[Tumor-induced osteomalacia]], [[Postorgasmic illness syndrome]]

===Withdrawal syndrome from certain drugs===
Sudden cessation of high-dose [[corticosteroids]], [[opioids]], [[barbiturates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[caffeine]] or [[alcohol]] can induce myalgia in many respects.
