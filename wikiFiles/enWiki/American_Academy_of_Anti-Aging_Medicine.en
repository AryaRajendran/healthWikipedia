The '''American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine''' (A4M) is a [[United States]] registered [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization that promotes the field of [[anti-aging medicine]] and trains and certifies physicians in this specialty. As of 2011, approximately 26,000 practitioners had been given certificates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fontenot|first=Cliff|title=Dr Ronald Klatz's Interview With The Anti Aging Source|url=http://www.anti-aging-source.com/dr-ronald-klatz.html|work=Interview|publisher=The Anti Aging Source|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref>  However, the field of anti-aging medicine is not recognized by established medical organizations, such as the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA). In addition to certifying practitioners, the Academy's activities include lobbying, education of the public, and public relations. The A4M was founded in 1993 by Dr. [[Robert Goldman]]{{dn|date=November 2012}} and Dr. [[Ronald Klatz]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic physicians]],<ref name="CNN">

Several of the anti-aging methods recommended by the Academy have wide support among experts in the field, such as exercise and a healthy diet, but others, such as [[hormone treatment]]s, do not have support from a consensus of the wider medical community. Many scientists studying aging dissociate themselves from the claims of A4M,<ref name=Mykytyn2006/><ref name=LATimes2004/> and critics have accused the group of using misleading marketing to sell expensive and ineffective products.<ref name=SilverFleece/> In contrast, the Academy sees itself as acting within [[science]], stating that it bases its ideas on [[mainstream]] [[scientific research]], and arguing that its ideas challenge current [[medical practice]].<ref name=Mykytyn/> The A4M's founders and merchants who promote products through the organization have been involved in several legal and [[professional dispute]]s.

The activities of the A4M are controversial: in 2003 a commentary on the response of the [[scientific community]] to the promotion of anti-aging medicine noted that the activities of the A4M were seen as a threat to the credibility of serious scientific research on aging.<ref name=Binstock>{{Cite journal

The A4M believe that an "anti-aging transformation" can be produced by a combination of interventions, which include [[hormone]]s, [[antioxidant]]s, [[lifestyle modification]]s and [[exercise]].<ref name=A4MPdf>{{cite web | last = Goldman | first = R | coauthors = Klatz R | url = http://www.worldhealth.net/pdf/Goldman,Klatz_intl-PRINT.pdf | title = Anti-Aging Medicine: An Introduction to the World’s Fastest-Growing Medical Specialty | format = PDF | publisher = American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine | accessdate =December 16, 2009 | year = 2002| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100119193936/http://www.worldhealth.net/pdf/Goldman,Klatz_intl-PRINT.pdf| archivedate= January 19 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> A 2002 presentation produced by Klatz highlights many widely recommended interventions to maintain health in old age, such as staying slim, avoiding smoking, regular exercise, maintaining an active social and sex life, continued mental stimulation, avoiding stress, a healthy diet, and moderate alcohol consumption.

Writing in the 2001 issue of the journal ''Generations'', historian Carole Haber of the [[University of Delaware]], states that Klatz' aspirations  and the rhetoric of the A4M "reflect well-worn ideas and the often-enunciated hopes of the past", drawing parallels with the ideas of the 19th century [[physiologist]]s [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]], [[Serge Voronoff]] and [[Eugen Steinach]]. Haber states that the current resurgence of these ideas may be due to their appeal to the aging [[Baby Boom Generation]], in a culture that is focused on the ideal of youth.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Divergent views on anti-aging products==

According to a 2002 article in the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', there are two opposing viewpoints of anti-aging products. The article states that the first view is represented by scientists who publish their findings in the [[scientific literature]] and who believe that no currently available intervention can slow or prevent aging. The alternative viewpoint is represented by people who the article states have "fewer credentials" and who promote a range of products that claim to have anti-aging properties.<ref name=Garreau>Joel Garreau [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20021019&slug=aging19 Holding back the years: Scientists say extended youth may be near] ''Seattle Times'' 2002, Accessed September 28, 2009</ref> A similar observation was made by ''[[Business Week]]'' in 2006, when they stated that although anti-aging medicine is increasingly popular, there is "precious little scientific data to back up their claims that the potions extend life."<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_12/b3976001.htm? Selling The Promise Of Youth] cover story ''[[Business Week]]'' March 20, 2006, Accessed September 28, 2009</ref>

As an example of the first viewpoint, a 2004 review in ''[[Trends in Biotechnology]]'' written by Leigh Turner of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] stated that the products promoted by the A4M have "no credible scientific basis" and that "there are no proven, scientifically established ‘anti-aging’ medications".<ref>{{Cite journal

The alternative view is held by the A4M, who argue that anti-aging medicine is "evidence-based, clinically sound health care." and state that "only those diagnostic and treatment elements which prove their validity through independent evaluations are embraced by the A4M."<ref>[http://www.worldhealth.net/about-anti-aging-medicine/introduction-anti-aging-medicine/ Introduction to Anti-Aging Medicine] American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, Accessed September 28, 2009</ref> The ''Seattle Times'' quotes Klatz as describing those who doubt the validity of anti-aging medicine as "flat-earthers" who make unjustified criticisms that are not backed by scientific evidence, the article also states that Klatz "sees the science and medical establishments as out to get him."<ref name=Garreau/>  Though he has been quoted as saying, "I’m not against the AMA and I’m not against the establishment, I’m really for the establishment, I’m for technology I’m for science-based medicine.

===Human growth hormone controversy===
{{Main|HGH controversies}}
The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine was formed following a 1990 study on [[human growth hormone]] (hGH) that was published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.<ref name="MSNBC"/> The study was performed by Daniel Rudman and colleagues at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]]. Rudman had treated twelve men over 60 years of age with human growth hormone; after six months, these men had an increase in lean body mass and a decrease in adipose tissue mass when compared with a group of nine men who did not receive hormone.<ref name=Rudman>{{cite journal

}}</ref>  Members of the anti-aging movement have interpreted these results to support a role for growth hormone in slowing or reversing aging. A review in ''The Journal of Urology'' noted that this promotion of growth hormone as an anti-aging remedy is "arguably similar" to ideas that date back to the late 19th century, when the physiologist [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] advocated rejuvenating hormone products prepared from animal testicles and stated that "the injections have taken 30 years off my life".<ref>{{Cite journal

''The New York Times'' reports that the idea that growth hormone can improve "health, energy level and sense of well-being." is a core belief of the A4M,<ref name="NYTPoison"/> with Klatz writing a book in 1998 entitled ''Grow Young with HGH: The Amazing Medically Proven Plan to Reverse Aging'' where he states "The ‘Fountain of Youth’ lies within the cells of each of us.

In fact, he was horrified his study was being used to support the industry especially since heavy use of growth hormone can have unwanted side effects".<ref name="MSNBC"/> 

''The New York Times'' states that medical authorities not affiliated with the A4M question the safety and efficacy of the use of growth hormone in anti-aging medicine, quoting Michael Fossell of [[Michigan State University]] who stated that "hormone therapies are the new patent medicines – cure-alls embraced by a too-trusting public."<ref name="NYTPoison"/>  A 2003 review that was published in the ''[[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Review of Medicine]]'' noted that the long-term risks or benefits of this treatment are uncertain, that "neither the benefits nor the dangers have been defined" and advising that a "prudent physician should not condone the use of GH for normal aging".<ref>{{Cite journal

As a result of the reactions to the 1990 article and its frequent citation by proponents of HGH as an anti-aging agent, in 2003 the New England Journal of Medicine published two articles that strongly and clearly stated that there was insufficient medical and scientific evidence to support use of HGH as anti-aging drug. One article was written by the Journal's then-current editor in chief, Jeffrey M. Drazen, M.D. and was entitled, "Inappropriate Advertising of Dietary Supplements".<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp030021</ref>  It focused mostly on the advertising of dietary supplements.  The other article was written by the editor-in-chief at the time the 1990 article was published, Mary Lee Vance, M.D., and was entitled, "Can Growth Hormone Prevent Aging?"; it focused more on the medical issues around whether there was sufficient evidence to use HGH as an anti-aging agent.<ref name="Vance">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp020186</ref>

A 2007 review on the use of human growth hormone as an anti-aging treatment in healthy elderly people published in the ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' concluded the risks of HGH significantly outweigh the benefits, noted [[edema|soft tissue edema]] as a common side effect and found no evidence that the hormone prolongs life.<ref>{{Cite journal

The Academy's co-founders include Klatz and Goldman, who are licensed osteopathic physicians and have [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degrees (D.O.).
