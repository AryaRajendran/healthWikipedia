'''Thyroid Cancer Canada (TCC)''' is a volunteer organization dedicated to supporting patients newly diagnosed and living with [[thyroid cancer]]. TCC was incorporated as a [[non-profit organization]] in 2002 and received [[Charitable organization|charitable status]] in 2003. The organization was originally established under the name ''Canadian Thyroid Cancer Support Group (Thry’vors) Inc''. and changed its name to '''Thyroid Cancer Canada/Cancer de la thyroide Canada''' in October 2009. As a charitable organization registered with the [[Canada Revenue Agency]], Thyroid Cancer Canada holds an [[Annual general meeting|Annual General Meeting (AGM)]] and elects a Board of Directors each year.

Thyroid Cancer Canada is operated entirely by volunteers. TCC has no ongoing financial support from any institution or government program, nor does it receive core funding from any source. All of the funds raised by TCC go directly to supporting patients.

== History ==
Thyroid Cancer Canada was started in 2000 after some Canadian women participating on an American online forum realized their commonality. These women had a few conversations off-line, and those who lived in the [[Toronto]] area met a few times over coffee. The first in-person meeting of these thyroid cancer survivors, some of whom became the founders of TCC, was held on May 7, 2000.

In the fall of 2001, the TCC founders attended a meeting at a Toronto hospital with others working in the field of thyroid disease, including doctors, representatives from a thyroid foundation and reps from [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] companies.  The main focus of the meeting was to look for ways to offer support to Canadian thyroid cancer patients.  After this meeting, the TCC founders who attended decided to meet again and formalize their own group.

The first formal meeting of the TCC founders occurred in [[Kingston, Ontario]] on January 19, 2002.  Interestingly, on the agenda for that first meeting were some items that have remained priorities.  They looked at providing credible information to thyroid cancer patients in the form of printed material and a website. They also set out to offer support and information in various ways such as by telephone, email, online, and through hard copy publications. They discussed advocacy issues and the support of thyroid cancer research. Soon after the meeting the TCC founders started an Online Forum, which was modeled after the American one where they had first met.

They also decided on a name for their group.  A friend of a group member suggested that they not refer to themselves as “survivors”, but rather as “thri-vers”, since they were and still are thriving despite having cancer. They coined the spelling of “Thry’vors” as a combination of three words – thriving, thyroid and survivors. Although the organization has recently changed its name to Thyroid Cancer Canada, TCC will continue to refer to its members as Thry’vors.<ref name="history">[http://www.thyroidcancercanada.org/history.php History], Thyroid Cancer Canada</ref>
