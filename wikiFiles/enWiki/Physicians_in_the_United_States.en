'''[[Physicians]] in the [[United States]]''' include both ones trained by [[medical education in the United States]] (which produce MDs and DOs) and ones that are [[international medical graduate]]s (MBBS and MDs) who have progressed through the necessary steps to acquire a [[medical license]] to practice in a state. They are an important part of [[health care in the United States]].

The [[American College of Physicians]], uses the term ''physician'' to describe specialists in [[internal medicine]]. The [[American Medical Association]] as well as the [[American Osteopathic Association]] both currently use the term ''physician'' to describe members.

==Medical education==
The [[medical education in the United States|US medical education]] for physicians includes participation in a [[Medical school in the United States|US medical school]] that eventually grants the a [[Doctor_of_Medicine#United_States_and_Canada|US form of Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) degree<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001936.htm |title=Doctor of medicine profession (MD) |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine of National Institutes of Health |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> or a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.) degree. United States [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medical schools]] have a [[Comparison of MD and DO in the United States|curriculum nearly identical to MD schools]] with the addition of [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]], which focuses on extra instruction in the musculoskeletal system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002020.htm |title=Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine of National Institutes of Health |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> After graduating from a first-professional school, physicians who wish to practice in the U.S. usually take standardized exams, such as the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]] and/or the [[COMLEX-USA]].

In addition, the United States requires [[residency (medicine)|residency]] before granting a [[medical license]] to practice independently.

==Specialists==
Currently, a specialist physician may be described in the United States as an ''internist''. Another term, ''hospitalist'', was introduced in 1996,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wachter R, Goldman L |title=The emerging role of "hospitalists" in the American health care system |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=335 |issue=7 |pages=514–7 |year=1996 |pmid=8672160 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199608153350713}}</ref> to describe US specialists in [[internal medicine]] who work largely or exclusively in hospitals. Such 'hospitalists' now make up about 19% of all US '' general internists''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kuo |first1=YF |last2=Sharma |first2=G |last3=Freeman |first3=JL |last4=Goodwin |first4=JS| title=Growth in the care of older patients by hospitalists in the United States|journal=N Engl J Med |volume=360 |issue=11 |pages=1102–1112 |year=2009|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0802381 |pmc=2977939 |pmid=19279342}}</ref>

There are three agencies or organizations in the United States which collectively oversee [[physician board certification]] of [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] and [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|D.O.]] [[physicians in the United States]] in the 26 approved medical specialties recognized in the country. These organizations are the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] (ABMS) and the [[American Medical Association]]; the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] (AOABOS) and the [[American Osteopathic Association]]; the [[American Board of Physician Specialties]] (ABPS) and the [[American Association of Physician Specialists]]. Each of these agencies and their associated national medical organization functions as its various specialty academies, colleges, and societies.

All boards of certification now require that [[physician|medical practitioners]] demonstrate, by examination, continuing mastery of the core knowledge and skills for a chosen specialty. Recertification varies by particular specialty between every seven and every ten years.

==Salaries==

===Compared to foreign countries===
America has the highest paid general practitioners in the world.<ref name=OECD>{{cite web|title=OECD health working papers #41: The renumeration of general practitioners an specialists in 14 OECD countries: What are the factors influencing variations across countries?|url=http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/41925333.pdf|work=Directorate for Employment, Labour, and Social Affairs|publisher=OECD|accessdate=17 March 2013|author=Rie Fujisawa|coauthors=Gaetan Lafortune|pages=63|date=2008}}</ref>  America has the second-highest paid specialists in the world behind the Netherlands.<ref name="OECD"></ref> Public and private payers pay higher fees to US [[primary care]] physicians for [[doctor's visit|office visits]] (overall 27 percent more for public and 70 percent more for private) than in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.<ref name=Laugesen2011>{{cite doi|10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0204}}</ref> US primary care physicians also earn more (overall earning $186,000 yearly) than the foreign counterparts, with even higher numbers for [[Medical_specialty#Physician_compensation|physician compensation for medical specialists]].<ref name=Laugesen2011/> Higher fees, rather than factors such as higher practice costs, volume of services, or tuition expenses, mainly drive higher US spending.<ref name=Laugesen2011/>

===Variations within the US===
{{dablink|Specialty-specific salaries given in [[Specialty (medicine)]]}}
A survey of 15,000 physicians practicing in the United States reported that, across all specialties, male physicians earn approximately 41% more than female physicians.<ref name=medscape2011/> An attributable variable is that female physicians tend to a higher degree to choose [[specialty (medicine)|medical specialties]] of relatively lower compensation, such as [[obstetrics]].<ref name=medscape2011>[http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2011 Medscape Physician Compensation Report: 2011]</ref> Also, female physicians are more likely to report working fewer hours than their male counterparts.<ref name=medscape2011/>

The same survey reported that, the highest-earning physicians were located in [[West North Central States|North Central]] region, comprising [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], [[Iowa]], and [[Missouri]], with a median salary of $225,000 per year, as per 2010. The next highest earning physicians were those in the [[South Central United States|South Central]] region, comprising [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Arkansas]], at $216,000. Those physicians reporting the lowest compensation levels were located in the Northeast and Southwest, earning an across-specialty median annual income of $190,000.<ref name=medscape2011/>

The survey concluded that physicians in small cities (50,000–100,000) earned slightly more than those living in community types of other sizes, ranging from metropolitan to rural, but the differences were only marginal (a few percent more or less).<ref name=medscape2011/>

Other results from the survey were that those running a solo practice earned marginally less than private practice employees, who, in turn, earned marginally less than hospital employees.<ref name=medscape2011/>
