'''Cyclosporiasis''' is an infection with the [[protozoan]] ''[[Cyclospora cayetanensis]]'', a pathogen transmitted by [[feces]] or feces-contaminated fresh produce and water.  [[Outbreak]]s have been reported due to contaminated [[raspberry|raspberries]].  It is not spread from person to person.  It can be a cause of [[diarrhea]] for travelers.

==Mode of infection==
When an [[oocyst]] of ''Cyclospora cayetanensis'' enters the [[small intestine]] and invades the [[mucosa]] it incubates for about one week.  After incubation the person begins to experience severe watery diarrhea, bloating, fever, stomach cramps, and muscle aches.  

Oocysts can be present due to using contaminated water or human feces as [[fertilizer]]. This infection primarily affects humans and other primates.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
[[Diagnosis]] can be difficult due to the lack of recognizable oocysts in the feces.  Using tests like [[PCR]]-based [[DNA]] tests and [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain|acid-fast staining]] can help with identification. The infection is often treated with [[Co-trimoxazole]], because traditional anti-protozoan drugs are not sufficient.  To prevent transmission through food, cook food and try to avoid drinking stream water while outdoors.

==Vaccine research==
[[Haiti]] is one of the countries that is known to be highly endemic for the parasite Cyclospora. Symptoms of cyclosporiosis include prolonged watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, weight loss, anorexia, myalgia, and occasionally vomiting and/or fever.  There is no vaccine to control Cyclospora or  toxoplasmosis in humans at the present time but one is available for reduction of fetal losses in sheep.The cost to develop vaccine for humans and the fact that poor people are mostly affected has delayed development.
