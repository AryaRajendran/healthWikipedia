'''Lint''' is the common name of visible accumulations of [[textile]] [[fiber]]s and other materials, usually found on and around [[clothing]]. Certain materials used in the manufacture of clothing, such as [[cotton]], [[wool]], and [[linen]], contain numerous very short fibers bundled together.<ref name="ESD">R. W. Welker, Ramamurthy Nagarajan, Carl E. Newberg, ''Contamination and ESD Control in High-Technology Manufacturing'' (2006), p. 415-16.</ref> During the course of normal wear, these fibers may either break, or be jostled out of the weave of which they are part.<ref name="ESD"/> This is the reason that heavily used articles like [[shirt]]s and [[towel]]s become thin over time,<ref name="ESD"/> and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a [[clothes dryer]].<ref name="ESD"/> Because of their low surface area, [[static cling]] causes fibers that have detached from an article of clothing tend to continue to stick to one another, and to that article or other surfaces with which they come in contact. Other small fibers or particles also accumulate with these clothing fibers, including human and animal [[hair]], [[skin cell]]s, plant fibers, [[pollen]], [[dust]], and [[microorganism]]s. The [[etymology]] of the modern word "lint" is related to "linting", the term used for the cultivation of the shorter fibers from the [[Gossypium|cotton plant]] (''[[Gossypium]]''), also called "lint", from which lower quality cotton products are manufactured.<ref>Norma R. Hollen, Jane Saddler, ''Modern textiles'' (1952), p. 14.</ref> Lint is composed of threads of all colors which blend hues and appear to be a uniform grey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glass|first=Don|title=The Color of Lint|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/color-lint/|work=A Moment of Science|publisher=Indiana Public Media|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=October 16, 2008}}</ref>

==Varieties of lint==
===Pocket lint===
Pocket lint is [[debris]] including not only bits of [[fabric]], but also small shreds of [[paper]] and [[Facial tissue|tissue]] that are often found in [[pocket]]s. It may be caused by the clothing run through a [[washing machine]] one or more times, causing the pocket lining or contents to compact and shred.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

As pocket lint is an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of the contents of the pockets, pocket lint can be helpful when determining if [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]s have been previously stored in the pockets, by testing it with various [[drug test]]s. In a survival situation, pocket lint can be used as kindling for starting a fire.

The [[Infocom]] game, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', was sold with a collection of "props" that included a small bag of "pocket fluff".<ref>Blake Wilson, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/hitchikers-guide-the-game/ 'Hitchhiker's Guide': The Game] "Arts Beat", ''[[New York Times]]'' (September 18, 2008).</ref>

===Navel lint===
'''Navel lint''' (also known by names such as '''navel fluff''', '''belly button lint,''' '''belly button fluff,''' and ''' dip lint''') is an accumulation of fluffy fibers in the [[navel]] cavity. Many people find that, at the beginning and end of the day, a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity. This lint is an accumulation of cloth fibers that are scraped by body hair. The reasons for its accumulation in the navel are a subject of speculation. A likely hypothesis is that rubbing of navel hairs and [[clothing]] contributes to a build-up of [[static electricity]] resulting in the collection of clothing fibers and to a lesser extent, dead skin cells. 

Georg Steinhauser, a chemist writing in the journal [[Medical Hypotheses]] said that small pieces of fluff first form in the hair and then end up in the navel at the end of the day. He further said that abdominal hair often seems to grow in concentric circles around the navel, the scaly structure of the hair enhances the abrasion of minuscule fibres from the shirt and directs the lint towards the belly button.<ref name="georg">{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4883791/Revealed-The-secrets-of-belly-button-fluff.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Sawer | title=Revealed: The secrets of belly button fluff | date=28 February 2009}}</ref> Steinhauser established that shaving one's belly will result in a fluff-free navel but only until the hairs grow back. His other suggestions include wearing old clothes, as they tend to shed less lint than newer garments, which can lose up to one thousandth of their weight to the belly button over the course of a year. A body piercing can also be used, with [[Navel piercing|belly button rings]] particularly effective at sweeping away fibres before they lodge.<ref name="georg" />  Another method, not noted by Steinhauser, is to wear denim jeans with a belt holding them up perpendicular to the navel.

==Problems related to lint==
===Biological problems===
Inhalation of excessive amounts of lint, as observed in early textile workers, may lead to diseases of the lungs, such as [[byssinosis]].<ref>Stephen Yafa, ''Cotton: The Biography of a Revolutionary Fiber'' (2006).</ref> Lint shed from clothing during the course of wear may also carry [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es.<ref>Mastura Raheel, ''Protective Clothing Systems and Materials (1994), p. 19.</ref> For this reason, the presence of lint presents a danger during [[surgery]], when it might carry microorganisms into open wounds. It has been demonstrated that due to the abrasive contact between clothing and skin, "a person wearing a standard cotton scrub suit actually sheds more bacteria than without clothing".<ref>GS Kulkarni, ''Textbook of orthopedics and trauma'' (2008), p. 296.</ref> Lint presents a threat to the environment in spaces that generally do not experience human contact, constituting "one of the primary polluters" in [[cave exploration]].<ref>Barbara Hurd, ''Entering the Stone: On Caves and Feeling Through the Dark'' (2005), p. 54.</ref>

===Mechanical problems===
Lint contamination also presents perhaps the most serious threat of damage to delicate mechanical devices.<ref>Ira Cochin, ''Analysis and Design of the Gyroscope for Inertial Guidance'' (1963), p. 143.</ref><ref>Michael Kozicki, Stuart A. Hoenig, Patrick J. Robinson, ''Cleanrooms: Facilities and Practices'' (1991).</ref> In order to prevent lint contamination, workers entering [[clean room]]s are generally required to wear an outer layer of clothing made from artificial fibers that are longer, thicker, and therefore much less likely to shed any material.<ref name="ESD"/><ref>"The Inside Story on Outdoor Gear", ''[[Popular Science]]'' (May 1991), Vol. 238, No. 5, p. 82.</ref> Lint-resistant clothing materials include elastic fabrics like [[spandex]] (or Lycra), for which the fibers will tend to stretch rather than break; and longer, stronger [[polyolefin]] fibers such as [[Tyvek]].<ref>Krishan Kumar Chawla, ''Fibrous Materials'' (1998), p. 102.</ref>

===Other problems===
Lint on clothing is generally considered unattractive and unprofessional. Furthermore, lint may be abrasive, and may damage the clothing itself.<ref>Cynthia Townley Ewer, ''Houseworks'' (2009), p. 139.</ref> For this reason, visible lint is often removed with a [[lint roller]] or [[clothes brush]]. The accumulation of lint during clothes cleaning can be reduced with the use of a [[fabric softener]], which reduces the amount of static electricity on clothing surfaces, and therefore prevents the lint from sticking to the clothes.<ref>Jeff Bredenberg, ''Clean It Fast, Clean It Right'' (1999), p. 235-36.</ref> Dryer lint, which collects on the lint screen of a [[clothes dryer]], is highly flammable, and therefore presents a [[fire hazard]].<ref>Eric Kleinert, ''Troubleshooting and Repairing Major Appliances'' (1995), p. 231.</ref> However, because of this flammability, dryer lint may be collected for use as kindling,<ref>Lori Baird, ''Don't Throw It Out: Recycle, Renew and Reuse to Make Things Last'' (2007), p. 216.</ref> although burning man-made fibres can produce toxic fumes.

==Uses of lint==
===Use in forensic science===
Lint is useful to examine in [[forensic science]] because it is accumulated over time, and because the fibers shed from clothing not only adhere to that clothing, but also adhere to other particles to which the carrier is exposed.<ref name="FEC145">Jane Moira Taupin, Chesterene Cwiklik, ''Forensic Examination of Clothing'' (2009), p. 145.</ref> The lint on a person's clothing is therefore likely to contain material transferred from the various environments through which that person has passed,<ref name="FEC145"/> enabling forensic examiners to collect and examine lint to determine the movements and activities of the wearer.<ref>Jane Moira Taupin, Chesterene Cwiklik, ''Forensic Examination of Clothing'' (2009), p. 195.</ref><ref>Ashraf Mozayani, Carla Noziglia, ''The Forensic Laboratory Handbook: Procedures and Practice'' (2006), p. 266.</ref> Examiners may use various chemicals to isolate lint fibers from different articles of clothing based on differences in color and other characteristics.<ref>Jane Moira Taupin, Chesterene Cwiklik, ''Forensic Examination of Clothing'' (2009), p. 190.</ref>

===Composting===
It is possible to [[compost]] lint retrieved from the lint screen on a dryer by adding it to other materials being composted.<ref name="CCGG">Barbara Pleasant, Deborah L. Martin, ''The Complete Compost Gardening Guide'' (2008), p. 128.</ref> The texture of the material allows the organic matter within it to compost quickly and easily,<ref name="CCGG"/> but depending on the source it may include inorganic fibers and materials which never break down.<ref name="CCGG"/>

===As tinder===
As noted above, dryer lint burns readily. Although this may present a hazard in the household, it also means that lint makes excellent [[tinder]] for starting fires.<ref>Michael Sweeney, Mireya Mayor, Michele Kayal, ''National Geographic Complete Survival Manual'' (2009), p. 46.</ref> It is especially useful for catching sparks from [[flint and steel]] or similar striker-type fire starters in the absence of matches.
