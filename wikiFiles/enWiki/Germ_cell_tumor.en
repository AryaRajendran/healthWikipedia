A '''germ cell tumor''' ('''GCT''') is a [[neoplasm]] derived from [[germ cell]]s. Germ cell tumors can be [[cancer]]ous or [[benign tumor|non-cancerous]] tumors. Germ cells normally occur inside the [[gonads]] ([[ovary]] and [[testis]]).  Germ cell tumors that originate outside the gonads may be [[birth defect]]s resulting from errors during [[Developmental biology|development]] of the [[embryo]].

==Etiology==

Some investigators suggest that this distribution arises as a consequence of abnormal migration of germ cells during embryogenesis. Others hypothesize a widespread distribution of germ cells to multiple sites during normal embryogenesis, with these cells conveying genetic information or providing regulatory functions at somatic sites.

Extragonadal germ cell tumors were thought initially to be isolated [[metastasis|metastases]] from an undetected primary tumor in a [[gonad]], but it is now known that many germ cell tumors are [[congenital]] and originate outside the gonads.  The most notable of these is [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]], the single most common tumor diagnosed in babies at birth.

Of all anterior mediastinal tumors, 15-20% are germ cell tumors of which approximately 50% are benign teratomas. <ref>[http://www.jpmsonline.com/jpms-vol2-issue1-pages11-12-ci.html Clinical Image: Mediastinal Teratoma]</ref>

== Classification ==

Germ cell tumors are classified by their [[histology]],<ref name="pmid15761467">{{cite journal

Germ cell tumors are broadly divided in two classes:<ref>{{EMedicine|med|2246|Germinoma, Central Nervous System}}</ref>

* The '''germinomatous''' or '''seminomatous''' germ cell tumors (GGCT, SGCT) include only [[germinoma]] and its synonyms [[dysgerminoma]] and [[seminoma]].
* {{anchor|Nonseminoma}}The '''nongerminomatous''' or '''nonseminomatous''' germ cell tumors (NGGCT, NSGCT) include all other germ cell tumors, pure and mixed.

The two classes reflect an important clinical difference. Compared to germinomatous tumors, nongerminomatous tumors tend to grow faster, have an earlier mean age at time of diagnosis (~25 years versus ~35 years, in the case of [[testicular cancer]]s), and have a lower 5 year survival rate.  The survival rate for germinomatous tumors is higher in part because these tumors are very sensitive to radiation, and they also respond well to chemotherapy.  The prognosis for nongerminomatous tumours has improved dramatically, however, due to the use of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robbins, Stanley L.; Kumar, Vinay; Cotran, Ramzi S. |title=Robbins basic pathology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=664 |isbn=0-7216-9274-5 |edition=7th }}</ref>

Mixed germ cell tumors occur in many forms.  Among these, a common form is teratoma with endodermal sinus tumor.
 
'''Teratocarcinoma''' refers to a germ cell tumor that is a mixture of [[teratoma]] with [[embryonal carcinoma]], or with [[choriocarcinoma]], or with both.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2008/MB_cgi?mode=&term=Teratocarcinoma&field=entry MESH 2008:  Teratocarcinoma]</ref>  This kind of mixed germ cell tumor may be known simply as a teratoma with elements of embryonal carcinoma or choriocarcinoma, or simply by ignoring the teratoma component and referring only to its malignant component:  embryonal carcinoma and/or choriocarcinoma. They can present in the [[anterior mediastinum]].

==Location==

Despite their name, germ cell tumors occur both within and outside the [[ovary]] and [[testis]].

* [[head]]
** inside the [[Human cranium|cranium]] — [[pineal]] and [[suprasellar]] locations are most commonly reported
** inside the [[mouth]] — a fairly common location for [[teratoma]]
* [[neck]]
* [[mediastinum]] — account for 1% to 5% of all germ cell neoplasms {{main|mediastinal germ cell tumor}}
* [[pelvis]], particularly [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]]
*[[ovary]] {{main|Ovarian cancer}}
*[[testis]] {{main|Testicular cancer}}

In females, germ cell tumors account for 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 1 to 3% of [[ovarian cancer]]s in [[North America]]. In younger women germ cell tumors are more common, thus in patients under the age of 21, 60% of ovarian tumors are of the germ cell type, and up to one-third are [[malignant]]. In males, germ cell tumors of the testis occur typically after puberty and are malignant ([[testicular cancer]]).  In [[neonates]], [[infants]], and [[children]] younger than 4 years, the majority of germ cell tumors are [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]]s. 

Males with [[Klinefelter syndrome]] have a 50 times greater risk of germ cell tumors (GSTs).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bebb GG, Grannis FW, Paz IB, Slovak ML, Chilcote R |title=Mediastinal germ cell tumor in a child with precocious puberty and Klinefelter syndrome |journal=Ann. Thorac. Surg. |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=547–8 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9725401 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003-4975(98)00504-9 |doi=10.1016/S0003-4975(98)00504-9}}</ref>  In these persons, GSTs usually contain nonseminomatous elements, present at an earlier age, and seldom are gonadal in location.

==Treatment==
Women with benign germ cell tumors such as [[mature teratoma]]s (dermoid cysts) are cured by [[ovarian cystectomy]] or [[oophorectomy]].<ref name=acs2012/> In general, all patients with malignant germ cell tumors will have the same staging surgery that is done for [[epithelial ovarian cancer]]. If the patient is still interested in having children, an alternative is unilateral [[salpingoophorectomy]], while the uterus, the ovary, and the fallopian tube on the opposite side can be left behind. This isn't an option when the cancer is in both ovaries. If the patient has finished having children, the surgery involves complete staging including salpingoophorectomy on both sides as well as [[hysterectomy]].<ref name=acs2012/>

Most patients with germ cell cancer will need to be treated with combination [[chemotherapy]] for at least 3 cycles.. The [[chemotherapy regimen]] most commonly used in germ cell tumors is called PEB (or BEP), and consists of [[bleomycin]], [[etoposide]], a [[platinum-based antineoplastic]] ([[cisplatin]]).<ref name=acs2012>[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/OvarianCancer/DetailedGuide/ovarian-cancer-treating-germ-cell-tumors Treatment for germ cell tumors of the ovary] at American Cancer Society. Last Medical Review: 12/05/2011. Last Revised: 01/11/2012</ref>

==Prognosis==

Oncol. |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=594–603 |year=1997 |month=February |pmid=9053482 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9053482}}</ref> is a tool for estimating the risk of relapse after treatment of malignant germ cell tumor.

Because the cystic extent of a tumor can be estimated by ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan before surgery, this permits selection of the most appropriate surgical plan to minimize risk of spillage of a malignant tumor.

Access to appropriate treatment has a large effect on outcome.  A 1993 study of outcomes in Scotland found that for 454 men with non-seminomatous (non-germinomatous) germ cell tumors diagnosed between 1975 and 1989, 5-year survival increased over time and with earlier diagnosis.  Adjusting for these and other factors, survival was 60% higher for men treated in a cancer unit that treated the majority of these men, even though the unit treated more men with the worst prognosis.<ref name="pmid8096954">{{cite journal

==Research==
{{See|Cancer research}}

Germ cell tumors of children are the subject of [[clinical research]] by the worldwide [[Children's Oncology Group]] (COG), in a number of studies coordinated by Dr. John Cullen, MD.<ref>[http://www.curesearch.org/our_research/research_stories/research_stories.aspx?id=1097 CureSearch.org press release re Germ Cell Cancer]</ref>

Intracranial Germ Cell Tumors have been studied through the International CNS GCT Study Group. Under the direction of Jonathan Finlay, the program director, three international treatment studies have been initiated since 1990 with the goal to maintain a high rate of cure while minimizing the [[late effect]]s of treatment.
