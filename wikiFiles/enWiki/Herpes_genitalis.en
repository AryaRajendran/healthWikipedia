'''Herpes genitalis''' (or '''genital herpes''') refers to a [[genital]] infection by [[Herpes simplex virus]].

When symptomatic, the typical manifestation of a primary HSV-1 or HSV-2 genital infection is clusters of genital sores consisting of inflamed [[papule]]s and [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]] on the outer surface of the genitals, resembling cold sores.<ref name="titleSTD Facts - Genital Herpes">{{cite web

In males,  the lesions occur on the [[glans penis]], shaft of the penis or other parts of the genital region, on the inner thigh, buttocks, or [[anus]]. In females, lesions appear on or near the [[Mons pubis|pubis]], [[Labium (genitalia)|labia]], [[clitoris]], [[vulva]], buttocks or anus.<ref name="titleSTD Facts - Genital Herpes"/> 

Other common symptoms include pain, itching, and burning.  Less frequent, yet still common, symptoms include discharge from the penis or [[vagina]], [[fever]], [[headache]], muscle pain ([[myalgia]]), swollen and enlarged lymph nodes and [[malaise]].<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Women often experience additional symptoms that include painful urination ([[dysuria]]) and [[cervicitis]]. Herpetic [[proctitis]] (inflammation of the anus and rectum) is common for individuals participating in anal intercourse.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> 

After 2–3 weeks, existing lesions progress into ulcers and then crust and heal, although lesions on mucosal surfaces may never form crusts.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> In rare cases, involvement of the [[sacrum|sacral]] region of the [[spinal cord]] can cause acute [[urinary retention]] and one-sided symptoms and signs of  myeloradiculitis (a combination of [[myelitis]] and [[radiculitis]]): pain, sensory loss, abnormal sensations ([[paresthesia]]) and rash.<ref name="pmid16680560">{{cite journal |author=Sakakibara R, Yamanishi T, Uchiyama T, Hattori T |title=Acute urinary retention due to benign inflammatory nervous diseases |journal=Journal of neurology |volume=253 |issue=8 |pages=1103–10 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16680560 |doi=10.1007/s00415-006-0189-9}}</ref><ref name="pmid8277988">{{cite journal |author=Vonk P |title=Elsberg syndrome: acute urinary retention following a viral infection |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde |volume=137 |issue=50 |pages=2603–5 |year=1993 |month=December |pmid=8277988 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Historically this has been termed Elsberg syndrome, although this entity is not clearly defined.<ref name="pmid16680560"/>

==Treatment==
Medical research has not been able to find a way to halt the spread of herpes and the number of infected people keeps growing. In the [[United States]] alone, 45 million people are infected, with an additional one million new infections occurring every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/genital_herpes/article_em.htm|title=Genital Herpes|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref> 

Presently, genital herpes cannot be cured. Moreover, genital herpes can be transmitted by viral shedding prior to and following the visual signs of symptoms. There are however some drugs that can shorten outbreaks and make them less severe or even stop them from happening. Among these drugs are: [[acyclovir]], [[valacyclovir]] and [[famciclovir]].<ref name="Genital Herpes Treatment">{{cite web|url=http://www.genitalherpessymptoms.org/genital-herpes-treatment.html| title=Genital Herpes Treatment|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref> 

Acyclovir is an [[antiviral drug]] used against herpes viruses, [[varicella-zoster]], and [[Epstein-Barr Virus]]es. This drug reduces the pain and the number of lesions in the initial case of genital herpes. Furthermore, it decreases the frequency and severity of recurrent infections. It comes in [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], [[Injection (medicine)|injection]], powder for injection, and [[ointment]]. The ointment is used topically and it decreases pain, reduces healing time, and limits the spread of the infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm| title=Medications and Drugs|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref> 

Valacyclovir is also used to treat herpes virus infections. Once in the body, it becomes the anti-herpes medicine, acyclovir. It helps relieve the pain and discomfort and the sores heal faster.  It only comes in caplets and its advantage is that it has a longer duration of action than acyclovir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/valacyclovir/article.htm| title=Brand Name: Valtrex|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref> 

Famciclovir is another antiviral drug that belongs to the same class of acyclovir and valacyclovir. Famciclovir is a [[prodrug]] that is converted to penciclovir in the [[body]]. The latter is the one active against the viruses. This drug has a longer duration of action than acyclovir and it only comes in tablets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/famciclovir/article.htm| title=Brand Name: Famvir|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>
