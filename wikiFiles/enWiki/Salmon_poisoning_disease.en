'''Salmon poisoning disease''' (SPD) is a fatal disease of [[dog]]s and other [[canidae|canid]]s caused by infection with a type of [[rickettsia]], ''[[Neorickettsia helminthoeca]]''.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>  It results from eating raw [[salmon]], [[trout]], or Pacific [[giant salamander]] and is found in the [[Pacific Northwest]].  These fish and amphibians are infected with [[metacercaria]]e of a [[trematoda|fluke]], ''[[Nanophyetus salmincola]]'' through an [[intermediate host]], the [[snail]] ''[[Oxytrema plicifer]]''.  The fluke attaches to the intestine of the dog and the rickettsiae are released, causing severe gastrointestinal disease and systemic infection.

''[[Neorickettsia elokominica]]'', carried by the same fluke, causes a similar disease known as Elokomin fluke fever (EFF) in canids, [[bear]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and [[ferret]]s.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web | title = Salmon Poisoning Disease and Elokomin Fluke Fever | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | date = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/57305.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-26 }}</ref>

Symptoms of SPD begin about one week after eating the salmon and include vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, depression, high fever, and enlarged [[lymph node]]s.  Untreated, [[mortality rate|mortality]] reaches 90 percent.<ref>{{cite web | last = Lobetti | first = Remo | title = Infectious Diseases of the GI Tract | work = Proceedings of the 31st World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | date = 2006 | url = http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/wsava/2006/lecture16/Lobetti2.pdf?LA=1 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-26 }}</ref>  Death occurs seven to ten days after symptoms begin.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>

Diagnosis is through finding the fluke eggs microscopically in a stool sample.  A [[needle aspiration biopsy]] of an enlarged lymph node will reveal rickettsial organisms within [[macrophage]]s in many cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johns J, Strasser J, Zinkl J, Christopher M |title=Lymph node aspirate from a California wine-country dog |journal=Vet Clin Pathol |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=243–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16783722 |doi=10.1111/j.1939-165X.2006.tb00123.x |last2=Strasser |last3=Zinkl}}</ref>  The rickettsial infection can be successfully treated with [[antibiotic]]s such as [[tetracycline]], and the fluke infection can be treated with [[fenbendazole]].

EFF has less severe symptoms than SPD, with less gastrointestinal signs and more lymph node involvement.  The mortality in untreated cases is about ninety percent.<ref name=Merck/>

A similar disease has been identified in [[Brazil]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Headley S, Vidotto O, Scorpio D, Dumler J, Mankowski J |title=Suspected cases of Neorickettsia-like organisms in Brazilian dogs |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume=1026 |issue= |pages=79–83 |year=2004 |pmid=15604473 |doi=10.1196/annals.1307.010}}</ref>
