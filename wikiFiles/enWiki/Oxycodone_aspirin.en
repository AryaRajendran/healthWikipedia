'''Oxycodone/aspirin''' (trade name '''Percodan''') is a combination drug marketed by [[Endo Pharmaceuticals]]. It is a tablet containing a mixture of 325&nbsp;mg  (5 [[Grain (unit)|grains]]) of [[aspirin]] and 4.8355&nbsp;mg of [[oxycodone|oxycodone HCl]] (equivalent to 4.3346&nbsp;mg of oxycodone as the free base); it is used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endo.com/File%20Library/Products/Prescribing%20Information/percodan_pack_insert.pdf |title=Percodan Package Insert |date=July 2010 |publisher=Endo Pharmaceuticals|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref> The safety of the combination during pregnancy has not been established, although aspirin is generally contraindicated during pregnancy, and the drug has been placed in [[Pregnancy category|pregnancy category D]].<ref name=DailyMed>{{cite web |url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=10380 |title=PERCODAN - oxycodone hydrochloride and aspirin tablet |date=April 2009 |work=[[Daily Med|DailyMed]] |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref> Inactive ingredients include [[D&C Yellow 10]], [[FD&C Yellow 6]], [[microcrystalline cellulose]], and [[corn starch]].<ref name=DailyMed/> Percodan was first [[marketed]] by [[DuPont]] Pharmaceuticals and prescribed in the [[United States]] in 1950.  At one time one of the most widely prescribed painkillers, it has largely been replaced by alternative oxycodone compounds containing [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen, Tylenol) instead of [[aspirin]], such as [[Percocet]].

==Pharmacology==
The [[oxycodone]] component in the combination is technically 14-hydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodein-6-one, a [[white]] [[odorless]], [[crystalline]] [[Powder (substance)|powder]] which is [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] from the [[opium]] [[alkaloid]] [[thebaine]]. Thebaine by itself has no therapeutic [[Value theory|value]]. Oxycodone is [[metabolized]] into [[oxymorphone]]. Unlike [[morphine]] and like [[codeine]], oxycodone has a good oral [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]]. Prior to the introduction of paracetamol, Percodan was the mainstay in post-operative oral pain treatment due to the potency and long [[half-life]] of oxycodone. It originally contained a small amount of [[caffeine]].

The usual [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]] is one tablet every six hours as needed for pain. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 12 tablets.

==Reformulation==

Percodan was reformulated in 2005; prior to 2005, it contained two oxycodone [[salts]]â€”4.62&nbsp;mg of oxycodone hydrochloride and 0.38&nbsp;mg of oxycodone terephthalate.  Since the latter salt is unusual in the [[pharmacopeia]], the manufacturer increased the amount of oxycodone hydrochloride to 4.8355 and discontinued the oxycodone terephthalate.

==Decline of use==
Percodan has largely been replaced by [[Percocet]] (which is a [[Chemical compound|compound]] of oxycodone and paracetamol, instead of Percodan's aspirin) and other oxycodone-containing compounds for post-operative pain, since aspirin and other [[anti-inflammatory drugs]] increase [[prothrombin time]] and thus inhibit the blood from clotting, which can result in post-operative complications, such as excessive bleeding.  [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Norco]] and [[Vicodin]], which contain [[hydrocodone]] and paracetamol, have also gained favor over Percodan for post-operative pain because hydrocodone is nearly as potent as oxycodone, and it is not as highly regulated.  In the United States, Percodan is regulated as a Schedule II [[controlled substance]] under the Uniform [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970, along with [[cocaine]], morphine and raw (unprocessed) [[opium]]. Schedule II prescriptions may not be filled by telephone (except in an emergency), and no [[refill]]s are allowed. By contrast, Vicodin, Norco, and other hydrocodone-containing compounds are in Schedule III.  Percodan is becoming something of a relic in the United States, at least, as the number of prescriptions has fallen precipitously since the 1960s in light of the alternate drugs available containing oxycodone (Percocet, [[Tylox]], [[Oxycodone|OxyContin]], [[Roxicodone]]).

==Miscellaneous==
The combination oxycodone/aspirin is also sold under the brand name '''Endodan'''. All products containing oxycodone (including Percodan, Percocet, OxyContin) have the potential to be habit-forming. Oxycodone can produce [[drug abuse|drug]] [[Chemical dependency|dependence]] of the morphine type and, therefore, has the potential for being addictive.
