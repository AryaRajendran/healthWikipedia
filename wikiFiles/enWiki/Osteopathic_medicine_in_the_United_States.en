{{Osteopathic Medicine}}
'''Osteopathic medicine''' is a branch of the medical [[profession]] '''in the United States.''' Osteopathic [[physician]]s ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) are licensed to practice [[medicine]] and [[surgery]] in all 50 states and are recognized in [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine#International practice rights|fifty-five other countries]], including all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]].

[[Frontier]] physician [[Andrew Taylor Still]] founded the profession as a radical rejection of the prevailing system of medical thought of the 19th century. Still's techniques relied heavily on the [[Joint manipulation|manipulation of joints and bones]] to diagnose and treat illness, and he called his practices "[[osteopathy]]". By the middle of the 20th century, the profession had moved closer to mainstream [[medicine]], adopting modern [[public health]] and [[Biomedicine|biomedical]] principles. American "osteopaths" became "osteopathic physicians", gradually achieving full practice rights as medical doctors in all 50 states, including serving in the U.S. armed forces as physicians.<ref name = "Reform">{{cite pmid|8267703}}</ref>

==Nomenclature==
Physicians and surgeons who graduate from osteopathic medical schools are known as physicians or [[osteopathic medicine|osteopathic]] physicians.  Upon graduation, they are conferred a [[professional doctorate]], the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.), instead of the more familiar degree, the [[Doctor of Medicine]], or M.D.<ref name="Visible">{{cite pmid|9107129}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|10693310}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Oths |first=Kathryn S.|coauthors=Servando Z.

==Osteopathic Principles==
[[Image:Medical School.jpg|thumb|A physician demonstrates an [[Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine|OMM]] technique to medical students at an osteopathic medical school.]]
Osteopathic medical students take the Osteopathic Oath, a revised version of the [[Hippocratic oath]], to maintain and uphold the "core principles" of osteopathic medical philosophy. Revised in 1953, and again in 2002, the core principles are:
#The body is a unit, and the person represents a combination of [[body]], [[mind]] and [[spirit]].
#The body is capable of [[homeostasis|self-regulation]], self-healing, and health maintenance.
#Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated.
#Rational treatment is based on an understanding of these principles: body unity, self-regulation, and the interrelationship of structure and function.<ref name="Gevitz" />

===Significance===
There are different opinions on the significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic philosophy is akin to the tenets of [[holistic medicine]].<ref name = "Harvard">[http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8513/34968/358839.html?d=dmtContent ''Osteopathic medicine.''] Intelihealth.com.</ref> They suggest that osteopathic philosophy is a kind of [[social movement]] within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the [[primary care]] physician within the health care system.<ref name="NYT"/><ref>{{cite web|title=About Osteopathic Medicine|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-dos/about-osteopathic-medicine/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=30 August 2007}}</ref> Others liken the [[American Osteopathic Association|American Osteopathic Association's]] emphasis of the core principles to professional [[indoctrination]], a process which glorifies osteopathic practices and beliefs while misrepresenting those of the M.D. community.<ref name = "Paradox">{{cite pmid|10547412}}</ref> Still others point out that there is nothing in the principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in the ''[[Journal of the American Osteopathic Association]]'' found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles, and some would even endorse them generally as sound medical principles.<ref name="Gevitz" />

==History==

===19th Century, A new movement within medicine===
[[Image:Andrew Taylor Still 1914.jpg|thumb|upright|Andrew Taylor Still, founder Osteopathic medicine]]
[[Frontier]] physician [[Andrew Taylor Still]], [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]], founded the American School of Osteopathy (now the A.T. Still University-Kirksville (Mo.) College of Osteopathic Medicine) in [[Kirksville, MO]], in 1892 as a radical protest against the turn-of-the-century medical system. A.T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease.<ref>Still AT.[http://www.archive.org/stream/philosophymechan00stiliala/philosophymechan00stiliala_djvu.txt ''The Philosophy and Mechanical Principles of Osteopathy.''] Kansas City, Mo: Hudson-Kimberly Pub Co; 1902:9–20,185,210,270. Version 2.0. Inter Linea Web site. Accessed January 23, 2006.</ref> He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri at a time when medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were [[arsenic]], [[castor oil]], [[whiskey]], and [[opium]]. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures.<ref name = "Hansen">{{cite pmid|16585374}}]</ref>

Dr. Still intended his new system of medicine to be a reformation of the existing 19th century medical practices. He imagined that someday "rational medical therapy" would consist of manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, surgery, and very sparingly used drugs. He invented the name "osteopathy" by blending two Greek roots ''osteon-'' for bone and''-pathos'' for suffering in order to communicate his [[theory]] that disease and physiologic dysfunction were [[Etiology|etiologically]] grounded in a disordered musculoskeletal system. Thus, by diagnosing and treating the musculoskeletal system, he believed that physicians could treat a variety of diseases and spare patients the negative side-effects of drugs.

[[Image:Twain1909.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mark Twain was a vocal supporter of the early osteopathic movement.]]The new profession faced stiff opposition from the medical establishment at the time. The relationship of the osteopathic and medical professions was often "bitterly contentious"<ref name="Cohen">Cohen, Jordan.

One notable advocate for the fledgling movement was [[Mark Twain]]. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter [[Jean Clemens|Jean's]] [[epilepsy]] as well as Twain's own [[chronic bronchitis]]. In 1909, he spoke before the [[New York State Assembly]] at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. "I don't know as I cared much about these osteopaths until I heard you were going to drive them out of the state, but since I heard that I haven't been able to sleep." Philosophically opposed to the [[American Medical Association]]'s stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the [[New York County Medical Society]] responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with "[t]he physicians think they are moved by regard for the best interests of the public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?" "...&nbsp;The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business."<ref name="Twain">{{cite pmid|9005751}}</ref>

===1916–1966, Federal recognition===
Recognition by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] was a key goal of the osteopathic medical profession in its effort to establish equivalency with its M.D. counterparts. Between 1916 and 1966, the profession engaged in a "long and tortuous struggle" for the right to serve as physicians and surgeons in the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|U.S. Military Medical Corps]]. On May 3, 1966 [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] authorized the acceptance of osteopathic physicians into all the medical military services on the same basis as MDs. The first osteopathic physician to take the oath of office to serve as a military physician was Harry J. Walter. The acceptance of osteopathic physicians was further solidified in 1996 when [[Ronald R. Blanck|Ronald Blanck, DO]] was appointed to serve as [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the Army]], the only osteopathic physician to hold the post.<ref name="Military"/>

===1962, California===
{{Main|Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California v. California Medical Association}}
In the 1960s in California, the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), sensing increased competition from osteopathic medicine, spent nearly [[Dollar|$]]8&nbsp;million to end the practice of osteopathic medicine in the state. In 1962, Proposition 22, a statewide ballot initiative in California, eliminated the practice of osteopathic medicine in the state. The California Medical Association (CMA) issued [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degrees to all [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DOs]] in the state of California for a nominal fee. "By attending a short seminar and paying $65, a doctor of osteopathy (D.O.) could obtain an M.D. degree; 86 percent of the DOs in the state (out of a total of about 2000) chose to do so."<ref name="Paradox" /> Immediately following, the AMA re-accredited the formerly osteopathic University of California at Irvine College of Osteopathic Medicine as [[University of California, Irvine School of Medicine]], an M.D. medical school. It also placed a ban on issuing physician licenses to DOs moving to California from other states.<ref name="The DO's">{{cite book|last=Gevitz|first=Norman|title=''The DO's: osteopathic medicine in America|year=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=0-8018-7833-0}}</ref> However, the decision proved to be controversial. In 1974, after protest and lobbying by influential and prominent DOs, the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California v. California Medical Association]], that licensing of DOs in that state must be resumed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crum|first=Jean F|title=The saga of osteopathy in California.|journal=The Western Journal of Medicine|year=1975|month=Jan|volume=122|issue=1|pages=87-90|pmid=1089010|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1130289/pdf/westjmed00293-0115.pdf}}</ref> Four years later, in 1978, the [[College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific]] opened in Pomona, and in 1997 [[Touro University California]] opened in [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]].

===1969, AMA House of Delegates approval===
[[Image:DO residents in ACGME total.svg|thumb|290px|Total number of DOs in [[Residency (medicine)#United States|residency programs]], by year.{{legend|#5B8CBE|DO residents in ACGME (M.D.) programs<ref>{{cite pmid|16145028}}</ref>}}

In 1969, the American Medical Association (AMA) approved a measure allowing qualified osteopathic physicians as full and active members of the Association. The measure also allowed osteopathic physicians to participate in AMA-approved intern and [[Residency (medicine)#United States|residency programs]]. However, the American Osteopathic Association rejected this measure, claiming it was an attempt to eliminate the distinctiveness of osteopathic medicine. In 1970, AMA President Dwight L. Wilbur, M.D. sponsored a measure in the AMA's House of Delegates permitting the AMA Board of Trustees' plan for the merger of D.O. and M.D. professions. Today, a majority of osteopathic physicians are trained alongside MDs, in residency programs governed by the [[ACGME]], an independent board of the AMA.<ref name="ACGME">{{cite pmid|15176520}}</ref>

===1993, First African American Woman to Serve as Dean of a U.S. Medical School===
In 1993, Barbara Ross-Lee, DO was appointed to the position of dean of the [[Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine|Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine]]; she was the first African-American woman to serve as the dean of a U.S. medical school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_279.html |title=Dr. Barbara Ross-Lee |author= |date= |work= |publisher=National Library of Medicine |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref>

===Non-discrimination policies===
Recent years have seen a professional rapprochement between the two groups. DOs have been admitted to full active membership in the [[American Medical Association]] since 1969. The AMA has invited a representative of the American Osteopathic Association to sit as a voting member in the AMA legislative body, the house of delegates.<ref name=ACP>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Jennifer Fisher|title=Osteopathic Medicine's Growing Pains|url=http://www.acpinternist.org/archives/1997/11/osteopat.htm|publisher=ACP Internist|accessdate=November 1997}}</ref>

====2006, American Medical Student Association====
In 2006, during the presidency of an osteopathic medical student, the [[American Medical Student Association]] (AMSA) adopted a policy regarding the membership rights of osteopathic medical students in their main policy document, the "Preamble, Purposes and Principles."
{{quotation|AMSA RECOGNIZES the equality of osteopathic and allopathic medical degrees within the organization and the healthcare community as a whole. As such, DO students shall be entitled to the same opportunities and membership rights as allopathic students.|''PPP'', AMSA<ref name = "AMSA"/>}}

====2007, AMA====
In recent years, the largest M.D. organization in the U.S., the [[American Medical Association]], adopted a fee non-discrimination policy discouraging differential pricing based on attendance of an M.D. or D.O. medical school.<ref name="ama295">{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/council-on-med-ed/cme-report-12a-09.pdf |title=AMA policy H-295.876 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>

In 2006, calls for an investigation into the existence of differential fees charged for visiting D.O. and M.D. medical students at American medical schools were brought to the American Medical Association. After an internal investigation into the fee structure for visiting D.O. and M.D. medical students at M.D. medical schools, it was found that one institution of the 102 surveyed charged different fees for D.O. and M.D. students.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Melissa|title=Recommendation on Equal Fees for Osteopathic and Allopathic Medical Students|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/377/a-07cmerpt6.pdf|work=Report of the Council on Medical Education (Report 6-A-07) |publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>  The house of delegates of the [[American Medical Association]] adopted resolution 809, I-05 in 2007.

===State Licensing of Practice Rights===
In the United States, laws regulating physician licenses are governed by the states. Between 1901 and 1989, osteopathic physicians lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving those with a D.O. degree the same legal privilege to practice medicine as those with an M.D. degree. In many states, the debate was long and protracted. Both the AOA and the AMA were heavily involved in influencing the legislative process. The first state to pass such a law was California in 1901, the last was [[Nebraska]] in 1989.<ref name="The DO's"/>

===Education and training===
{{Main|Medical school in the United States|Medical education in the United States}}
According to [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]], "the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of allopathic ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]) physicians, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and [[Board certification|[board] certification]]."<ref name = "Harrisons"/>

D.O.-granting U.S. medical schools have [[curricula]] identical for the most part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of [[Clerkship (medicine)|clinical rotations]] through the major specialties of medicine.<ref name="Shannon2" /> Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who may not be able to provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hubbard|first=Kevin|title=Letter to Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine |url=http://www.maops.org/associations/11748/files/Letter%20of%20Comment-Homer%20G..pdf|publisher=Missouri Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons|date=January 17, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref> Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.

====Graduate medical education====
[[Image:NewDocsTraining.PNG|thumb|left|390px|Sources of the 24,012 medical school graduates entering U.S. physician training programs in 2004.<ref name="Shannon">Shannon, Stephen C. [http://www.aamc.org/workforce/pwrc06/shannon.pdf ''The Impact of Osteopathic Medicine’s Growth on Physician Workforce in the US''] [[American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|AACOM]]. accessed Feb 2007.</ref>]]Upon graduation, most osteopathic medical physician pursue [[residency (medicine)|residency]] training programs. Depending on state licensing laws, osteopathic medical physicians may also complete a one-year rotating [[internship (medicine)|internship]] at a hospital approved by the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA).
Osteopathic physicians may apply to residency programs accredited by either the AOA or the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME). Currently, osteopathic physicians participate in more ACGME programs than in programs approved by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).<ref name="ACGME"/>  By 2015, all AOA residencies will also have ACGME accreditation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rao|first=Ankita|title=Osteopathic physicians make headway in conventional medicine|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/osteopathic-physicians-make-headway-in-conventional-medicine/2013/03/11/ddecb3a8-7147-11e2-ac36-3d8d9dcaa2e2_story.html|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 11, 2013}}</ref>

===Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT)===
[[Image:Manuellterapi5.jpg|right|450px|thumb|[[Osteopathic manipulative treatment]] (OMT) involves [[palpation]] and [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] of [[bone]]s, [[muscle]]s, [[joint]]s, and [[fascia]]e.]]
{{Main|Osteopathic manipulative medicine}}
Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, manipulative treatment is taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions for a number of disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% of their patients. The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like M.D. physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe drugs or suggest surgery as a first line of treatment.<ref name=diminishedOMT>{{cite journal |author=Johnson SM, Kurtz ME |title=Diminished use of osteopathic manipulative treatment and its impact on the uniqueness of the osteopathic profession |journal=Acad Med |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=821–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11500286 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1040-2446&volume=76&issue=8&spage=821 |doi=10.1097/00001888-200108000-00016}}</ref>
The [[American Osteopathic Association]] has made an effort in recent years to support scientific inquiry into the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulation as well as to encourage osteopathic physicians to consistently offer manipulative treatments to their patients. However, the number of osteopathic physicians who report consistently prescribing and performing manipulative treatment has been falling steadily. Medical historian and sociologist [[Norman Gevitz]]<ref name="NYT"/> cites poor educational quarters and few full-time OMM instructors as major factors for the decreasing interest of medical students in OMM. He describes problems with "the quality, breadth, nature, and orientation of OMM instruction," and he claims that the teaching of osteopathic medicine has not changed sufficiently over the years to meet the intellectual and practical needs of students.<ref name = "Gevitz">{{cite pmid|16585378}}</ref>

{{quote|In their assigned readings, students learn what certain prominent DOs have to say about various [[somatic dysfunction]]s. There is often a theory or model presented that provides conjectures and putative explanations about why somatic dysfunction exists and what its significance is. Instructors spend the bulk of their time demonstrating osteopathic manipulative (OM) techniques without providing evidence that the techniques are significant and efficacious. Even worse, faculty members rarely provide instrument-based objective evidence that somatic dysfunction is present in the first place.<ref name="Gevitz" />}}

At the same time, recent studies show an increasingly positive attitude of patients and physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality.<ref name = "pmid11837337">{{cite pmid|11837337}}</ref> One survey, published in the ''Journal of [[Continuing Medical Education]]'', found that a majority of physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM.<ref>{{cite pmid|12739255}}</ref> Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMM. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.<ref>{{cite pmid|16273444}}</ref>

===Professional attitudes===
Recent years have seen an increasingly cooperative climate between the D.O. and M.D. professions.
In 1998, a New York Times article described the increasing numbers, public awareness, and mainstreaming of osteopathic physicians, but said that "some aspects of osteopathic practice can still raise eyebrows among conventional doctors." "Leaders of conventional medicine may no longer use the word ''quack,'' but many still look askance at the osteopathic system of medical thought, which they feel lacks the intellectual rigor and the scientific underpinnings of their own practice."<ref name="NYT">Zuger A. ''Scorned No More, Osteopathy Is on the Rise.'' New York Times. Feb 17, 1998.</ref>

In 2005, during his tenure as president of the [[American Association of Medical Colleges]], Jordan Cohen described a climate of cooperation between D.O. and M.D. practitioners: {{quote|"We now find ourselves living at a time when osteopathic and allopathic graduates are both sought after by many of the same residency programs; are in most instances both licensed by the same licensing boards; are both privileged by many of the same hospitals; and are found in appreciable numbers on the faculties of each other's medical schools".<ref name="Cohen"/>{{dead link|date=July 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Jordan|title=Following in Flexner's Footsteps|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/MemberCenter/Premeds/edRx/Footsteps2.aspx|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref>}}
Elsewhere, he has remarked that [[Osteopathic manipulative medicine|osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM)]] can be an aid to the physician in fostering a relationship with the patient, while also a source of skepticism to MDs. In particular, he noted that suggestions that OMM could be used to treat diseases other than back problems, "reinforces lingering feelings among proponents of conventional medicine that osteopathy is simply a less intellectual field all around."<ref name="NYT"/>

===International practice rights===
[[Image:DOworld.PNG|thumb|375px|right|International practice rights of U.S. trained DOs]]
Each country has different requirements and procedures for licensing or registering osteopathic physicians and osteopaths. The only osteopathic practitioners that the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] recognizes as physicians are graduates of [[List of medical schools in the United States|osteopathic medical colleges in the United States]].<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/2005-4/100305b.pdf ''Notices.''] Federal Register. Vol. 70, No. 190. Oct 3, 2005.</ref> Therefore, osteopaths who have trained outside the United States are not eligible for medical licensure in the United States. On the other hand, U.S.-trained DOs are currently able to practice in 45 countries with full medical rights and in several others with restricted rights.

The ''Bureau on International Osteopathic Medical Education and Affairs'' (BIOMEA) is an independent board of the [[American Osteopathic Association]]. The BIOMEA monitors the licensing and registration practices of physicians in countries outside of the United States and advances the recognition of American-trained DOs. Towards this end, the BIOMEA works with international health organizations like the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) as well as other groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Practice Rights Map|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/international-osteopathic-medicine/Pages/international-practice-rights-map.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association}}</ref>

The procedure by which international countries consider granting physician licensure to foreigners varies widely. For U.S. trained physicians, the ability to qualify for "unlimited practice rights" also varies according to one's degree, [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic medicine|D.O.]]<ref name = "Int'l table">''AOA International License Summary.''[[American Osteopathic Association]]. Council on International Osteopathic Medical Education and Affairs.[http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/licensure/Documents/international-licensure-summary.pdf]</ref> Many countries recognize U.S.-trained MDs as applicants for licensure, granting successful applicants "unlimited" practice rights. The American Osteopathic Association has lobbied the governments of other countries to recognize U.S.-trained DOs similarly to their M.D. counterparts, with some success.{{Osteopathic medicine2}} In 55 countries, U.S.-trained DOs have unlimited practice rights. In 2005, after one year of deliberations, the [[General Medical Council of Great Britain]] announced that U.S.-trained DOs will be accepted for full medical practice rights in the United Kingdom. According to Josh Kerr of the AOA, "some countries don’t understand the differences in training between an [[osteopathic physician]] and an [[osteopath]]."<ref>''DO's around the World.''[[American Osteopathic Association]].[http://www.osteopathic.org/index.cfm?PageID=ost_dogoblobal]</ref> The [[American Medical Student Association]] strongly advocates for U.S.-trained D.O. international practice rights "equal to that" of M.D. qualified physicians.<ref name = "AMSA">[http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Libraries/Convention/C-9_Principles_Regardng_Osteopathic_Medicine.sflb.ashx ''Principles Regarding Osteopathic Medicine.''] Preamble, Purposes and Principles.

===Osteopathic medicine and primary care===
[[Image:OsteoPrimaryCare.PNG|thumb|left|400px|Trends in primary care as a career choice of osteopathic medical students<ref name="Singer">Singer, Allen M. [http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/debt/Pages/default.aspx Debt, Plans and Opinions of Osteopathic Medical Students in 2004.] American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine.</ref><br />{{legend0|#4A75AD|4th year students}} {{legend0|#9CAED6|1st year students}}]]

Osteopathic physicians have historically entered [[primary care]] fields at a higher rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a greater emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining.<ref name="pmid15980090">{{cite pmid|15980090}}</ref> Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a [[family medicine]] residency (the largest primary care field).<ref>{{cite pmid|16127950}}</ref> In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.<ref name="Singer"/>

==Criticism and internal debate==
[[Image:1styear osteopathic enrollment.PNG|thumb|right|330px|First-year enrollment at osteopathic medical schools, 1968–2011]]

===OMM===
Traditional osteopathic medicine, specifically [[Osteopathic manipulative medicine|OMM]], has been criticized for many techniques such as [[craniosacral therapy|cranial and cranio-sacral manipulation]]. A recent study questions the therapeutic utility of osteopathic manipulative treatment modalities.<ref>Heath D, Gevitz N. The research status of somatic dysfunction. In: Ward RC, ed. Foundations for Osteopathic Medicine. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, Pa: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2003:1188–1193.</ref> A website cites numerous studies demonstrating that there are some ailments for which the benefit of manipulative therapy has "firmly established" scientific support.<ref name = "Harvard">[http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH?d=dmtContent&c=358839&p=~br,IHW|~st,8513|~r,WSIHW000|~b,*  ''Osteopathic Medicine.''] Intelihealth.com.</ref> Also, [[New York University]] health information website claims that "it is difficult to properly ascertain the effectiveness of a hands-on therapy like OMT."<ref>[http://www.med.nyu.edu/patientcare/library/article.html?ChunkIID=37409#evidence ''What Is the Scientific Evidence for Osteopathic Manipulation?''] [[New York University School of Medicine|NYU Medical Center]].</ref>

===Research emphasis===

{{cquote|If osteopathy has become the functional equivalent of allopathy [meaning the MD profession], what is the justification for its continued existence? And if there is value in therapy that is uniquely osteopathic, why should its use be limited to osteopaths?<ref name = "Paradox">{{cite pmid|10547412}}</ref>|30px|30px}}

====Rapid expansion====
As the number of osteopathic schools has increased, the debate over distinctiveness has often seen the leadership of the American Osteopathic Association at odds with the community of osteopathic physicians.
{{cquote|within the osteopathic community, the growth is drawing attention to the identity crisis faced by [the profession]. While osteopathic leaders emphasize osteopaths' unique identity, many osteopaths would rather not draw attention to their uniqueness.<ref name=ACP />|30px}}

The rapid expansion has raised concerns about the number of available faculty at osteopathic schools and the role those faculty play in maintaining the integrity of the academic program of the schools.

{{cquote|DO schools are currently expanding their class sizes much more quickly than are their MD counterparts. Unlike MD colleges, where it is widely known that academic faculty members—fearing dilution of quality as well as the prospect of an increased teaching workload—constitute a powerful inhibiting force to expand class size, osteopathic faculty at private osteopathic schools have traditionally had little or no input on such matters. Instead, these decisions are almost exclusively the responsibility of college administrators and their boards of trustees, who look at such expansion from an entrepreneurial as well as an educational perspective. Osteopathic medical schools can keep the cost of student body expansion relatively low compared with that of MD institutions. Although the standards of the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation ensure that there will be enough desks and lab spaces to accommodate all new students, they do not mandate that an osteopathic college must bear the expense of maintaining a high full-time-faculty:student ratio.<ref name = "faculty">{{Cite pmid|19474540}}</ref>|30px}}

The president of the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine commented on the current climate of crisis within the profession.  {{cquote|The simultaneous movement away from osteopathic medicine’s traditionally separate training and practice systems, when coupled with its rapid growth, has created a sense of crisis as to its future. The rapid rate of growth has raised questions as to the availability of clinical and basic science faculty and clinical resources to accommodate the increasing load of students.<ref name="Shannon2">{{Cite pmid|19474542}}</ref>|30px}}

===For-profit medical education===
The accreditation of [[Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine]] (RVUCOM) generated some controversy before the school held its first class. Like all osteopathic medical schools, RVUCOM is accredited by a board of the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) [[Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation]] (COCA). Unlike the other 29 osteopathic and 141 [[Medical Doctor|M.D.]] medical colleges in the U.S., RVUCOM is organized as a [[for-profit school|for-profit]] corporation.<ref name = "RVU">Croasdale, Myrle.

Oct 1, 2007.</ref> Critics claimed the AOA's approval of a for-profit school will negatively affect osteopathic medical schools' credibility, especially in comparison to their M.D. counterparts.<ref>{{cite pmid|17682109}}</ref>
