'''Gliomatosis cerebri (infiltrative diffuse astrocytosis)''' is a rare primary [[brain tumor]]. It is commonly characterized by diffuse infiltration of the brain with neoplastic [[glial cells]] that affect various areas of the cerebral lobes.<ref>[http://rad.usuhs.mil/medpix/radpix.html?mode=single&comebackto=mode%3Dgeo_browse&recnum=923 Gliomatosis Cerebri, MedPix : 923 - Medical Image Database and Atlas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Glimatosis Cerebi behaves like a malignant tumor that is very similar to Glioblastoma.  

While gliomatosis cerebri can occur at any age, it is generally found in the third and fourth decades of life.

==Presentation==
It may affect any part of the [[brain]] or even the [[spinal cord]], [[optic nerve]] and compact [[white matter]]. Clinical manifestations are indefinite, and include [[headache]], [[seizures]], visual disturbances, [[corticospinal tract]] deficits, [[lethargy]], and [[dementia]]. A case of gliomatosis cerebri presenting as rapidly progressive dementia and Parkinson's disease like symptoms was described in an 82 year old woman.<ref>http://jmedicalcasereports.com</ref>

==Diagnosis==

Before the advent of [[MRI]], diagnosis was generally not established until [[autopsy]]. Even with MRI, however, diagnosis is difficult.<ref name="pmid10696026">{{cite journal |author=Bendszus M, Warmuth-Metz M, Klein R, ''et al.'' |title=MR spectroscopy in gliomatosis cerebri |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=375â€“80 |year=2000 |pmid=10696026 |doi= |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10696026}}</ref> Typically, gliomatosis cerebri appears as a diffuse, poorly circumscribed, infiltrating non-enhancing lesion that is hyperintense on T2-weighted images and expands the cerebral white matter. It is difficult to distinguish from highly infiltrative [[anaplastic]] [[astrocytoma]] or [[Glioblastoma multiforme|GBM]].<ref name="titleRadiology, University of Rochester Medical Center">{{cite web |url=http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/smd/Rad/neurocases/Neurocase01.htm |title=Radiology, University of Rochester Medical Center |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work=}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for gliomatosis cerebri is generally poor, with a median survival time of only 12 months.<ref>[http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site963/mainpageS963P0.html Gliomatosis Cerebri - My Child Has - Children's Hospital Boston<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Surgery is not practical considering the extent of the disease, standard [[chemotherapy]] (nitrosourea) has been unsuccessful, and while brain irradiation can stabilize or improve neurologic function in some patients, its impact on survival has yet to be proven.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
