==Biography==
Chrousos was born  in [[Patras]], [[Greece]], attended the [[University of Athens]] Medical School and finished as the valedictorian of his class in 1975. He completed his doctorate thesis at the University of Athens, followed by a residency in Pediatrics at New York University Medical School, New York, NY, and a fellowship in Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. He is Board Certified in Pediatrics/ Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes. He has held the positions at NIH of   directorship of the ACGME-accredited Affiliate NIH/Georgetown University Pediatric Endocrinology Training Program,     Chief of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH, Developmental Endocrinology Branch, Pediatric Endocrinology Section, and finally Chief of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,  Pediatric and Reproductive Endocrinology Branch. Dr. Chrousos went rapidly through the academic hierarchy steps from Assistant Professor to Full Professor of Pediatrics at Georgetown University, which he still holds, in addition to   his professorship at Athens.

==Research==
Chrousos has focused his research on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA) axis and has extensively studied the neuroendocrine alterations associated with mood disorders, sleep, pain perception, and immune function.  In particular, he has worked on the glucocorticoid signaling system diseases of the HPA axis, such as Cushing’s syndrome, Addison’s disease, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and the physiologic and molecular mechanisms of stress.  Early in his career, he described in the Journal of Clinical Investigation the Glucocorticoid Resistance Syndrome, a rare   genetic disease of the glucocorticoid receptor that causes hypertension and hyperandrogenism in children and adults [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20649902]. Subsequently, he has contributed the majority of the international original publications on this syndrome, which has served as a model of the study of the physiologic functions of these key steroid hormones that regulate the homeostasis of the organism.

==Publications==
He has an outstanding record of over 1100 scientific papers, edited 26 books, including 2 popular electronic volumes and 2 encyclopedias, and his work has been cited over 60,000 times throughout the scientific literature.  He is one of the most cited physician scientists in the world (Institute of Scientific Information, ISI highly cited) both in the fields of Clinical Medicine and Biology and Biochemistry.   Dr. Chrousos’s published work   has an h index of 123. He has published his work in journals of the highest caliber, such as the New England Journal of Medicine,  the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the Annals of Internal Medicine, PNAS, Science, Nature, etc.

==Teaching==
He has helped to develop the careers of over 60 young physicians and scientists, many of whom are now professors and chairpersons in Europe, the United States, Australia and Latin America,  and  directed several training programs for physicians for many years. He taught at the University of Ioannina  Medical School, Greece for 10 years (1980–1990).   He has had a number of visiting professorships and given prestigious and named lectures throughout the world.
