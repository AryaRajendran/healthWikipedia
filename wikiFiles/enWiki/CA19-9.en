'''CA19-9''' ('''carbohydrate antigen 19-9''', also called '''cancer antigen 19-9'''<ref name=Perkins>{{cite pmid|14524394}}</ref> or '''sialylated Lewis (a) antigen''') is a [[tumor marker]]<ref>{{MeshName|CA-19-9+Antigen}}</ref> that is used primarily in the management of [[pancreatic cancer]].

==History==
CA19-9 was discovered in patients with [[colon cancer]] and [[pancreatic cancer]] in 1981.<ref name="pmid6163212">{{cite journal |author=Koprowski H, Herlyn M, Steplewski Z, Sears HF |title=Specific antigen in serum of patients with colon carcinoma |journal=Science |volume=212 |issue=4490 |pages=53–5 |year=1981 |pmid=6163212 |doi=10.1126/science.6163212}}</ref> 

==Uses==
Guidelines from the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] discourage the use of CA19-9 as a screening test for cancer, particularly [[pancreatic cancer]]. The reason is that the test may be falsely normal ([[false negative]]) in many cases, or abnormally elevated in people who have no cancer at all ([[false positive]]). The main use of CA19-9 is therefore to see whether a pancreatic tumor is secreting it; if that is the case, then the levels should fall when the tumor is treated, and they may rise again if the disease recurs.<ref name=Asco>{{cite journal |author=Locker G, Hamilton S, Harris J, Jessup J, Kemeny N, Macdonald J, Somerfield M, Hayes D, Bast R |title=ASCO 2006 update of recommendations for the use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancer |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=24 |issue=33 |pages=5313–27 |year=2006 |pmid=17060676|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/24/33/5313 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.08.2644}}</ref>

In people with [[pancreatic mass]]es, CA19-9 can be useful in distinguishing between cancer and other diseases of the gland.<ref name=Perkins/><ref name=Goonetilleke/>

==Limitations==
CA19-9 can be elevated in many types of gastrointestinal cancer, such as [[colorectal cancer]], [[esophageal cancer]] and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].<ref name=Perkins/> Apart from cancer, elevated levels may also occur in [[pancreatitis]], [[cirrhosis]],<ref name=Perkins/> and diseases of the bile ducts.<ref name=Perkins/><ref name=Goonetilleke/> It can be elevated in people with obstruction of the [[bile duct]]s.<ref name=Goonetilleke/>

In patients who lack the [[Lewis antigen]] (a blood type protein on [[red blood cell]]s), which is about 10% of the Caucasian population, CA19-9 is not expressed,<ref name=Goonetilleke>{{cite journal |author=Goonetilleke KS, Siriwardena AK |title=Systematic review of carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) as a biochemical marker in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer |journal=Eur J Surg Oncol |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=266–70 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17097848 |doi=10.1016/j.ejso.2006.10.004}}</ref> even in those with large tumors.<ref name=Asco/> This is because of a deficiency of a [[fucosyltransferase]] enzyme that is needed to produce CA19-9 as well as the Lewis antigen.<ref name=Asco/>
