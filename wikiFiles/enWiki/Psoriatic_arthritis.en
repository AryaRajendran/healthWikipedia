'''Psoriatic arthritis''' (also '''arthritis psoriatica''', '''arthropathic psoriasis''' or '''psoriatic arthropathy''') is a type of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[arthritis]]<ref name="Fitz2">{{cite book |author=Freedberg, Irwin M.; Fitzpatrick, Thomas B. |title=Fitzpatrick's dermatology in general medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-138076-0 |edition=6th |pages=427–436}}</ref><ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |edition=10th |page=194}}</ref> that will develop in up to 30 percent of people who have the chronic skin condition [[psoriasis]].<ref>{{Cite document | publisher = [[National Psoriasis Foundation]] | title = About psoriatic arthritis | accessdate = 2008-08-31 | url = http://www.psoriasis.org/about/psa/ | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> Psoriatic arthritis is said to be a [[seronegative arthritis|seronegative]] [[spondyloarthropathy]] and therefore occurs more commonly in patients with [[HLA-B27|tissue type HLA-B27]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Common symptoms of psoriatic arthritis include:<ref name="pmid20015187">{{cite journal |author=Amherd-Hoekstra A, Näher H, Lorenz HM, Enk AH|title=Psoriatic arthritis: a review. |journal=Journal of the German Society of Dermatology|volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=332–9 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20015187 }}</ref>
* Pain, swelling, or stiffness in one or more joints.
* Joints that are red or warm to the touch.
* Sausage-like swelling in the fingers or toes, known as [[dactylitis]].
* Pain in and around the feet and ankles, especially [[tendinitis]] in the Achilles tendon or [[Plantar fasciitis]]  in the sole of the foot.
* Changes to the nails, such as pitting or separation from the nail bed.
* Pain in the area of the [[Sacrum]] (the lower back, above the tailbone).
Along with the above noted pain and inflammation, there is extreme exhaustion that does not go away with adequate rest. The exhaustion may last for days or weeks without abatement.  Psoriatic arthritis may remain mild, or may progress to more destructive joint disease. Periods of active disease, or flares, will typically alternate with periods of remission. 

Because prolonged inflammation can lead to joint damage, early diagnosis and treatment to slow or prevent joint damage is recommended.<ref name="pmid20461787">{{cite journal |author=Farragher TM, Lunt M, Plant D, Bunn DK, Barton A, Symmons DP|title=Benefit of early treatment in inflammatory polyarthritis patients with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies versus those without antibodies. |journal=Ann.

==Causes==

The exact causes are not yet known, but a number of genetic associations have been identified in a genome-wide association study of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis including [[HLA-B27]].<ref name="pmid18369459">{{cite journal |author=Liu Y, Helms C, Liao W, ''et al.'' |editor1-last=Leal |editor1-first=Suzanne M. |title=A genome-wide association study of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis identifies new disease loci |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e1000041 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18369459 |pmc=2274885 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000041 |url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000041}}</ref><ref name="pmid15708933">{{cite journal |author=Rahman P, Elder JT |title=Genetic epidemiology of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis |journal=Ann.

== Diagnosis ==
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
There is no definitive test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis may closely resemble other diseases, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. A [[rheumatologist]] (a doctor specializing in diseases affecting the joints) may use physical examinations, health history, blood tests and x-rays to accurately diagnose psoriatic arthritis. 

Factors that contribute to a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis include:

* Psoriasis in the patient, or a family history of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.
* A negative test result for [[Rheumatoid factor]], a blood factor associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
* Arthritis symptoms in the distal [[Interphalangeal articulations of hand]] (the joints closest to the tips of the fingers). This is not typical of rheumatoid arthritis.
* Ridging or pitting of fingernails or toenails ([[onycholysis]]), which is associated with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
* Radiologic images indicating joint change.

Other symptoms that are more typical of psoriatic arthritis than other forms of arthritis include inflammation in the [[Achilles tendon]] (at the back of the heel) or the [[Plantar fascia]] (bottom of the feet), and [[dactylitis]] (sausage-like swelling of the fingers or toes).<ref>{{Cite document | publisher = [[The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center]] | title = Psoriatic Arthritis | accessdate = 2011-05-04 | url = http://www.hopkins-arthritis.org/arthritis-info/psoriatic-arthritis/diagnosis.html | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

===Classification===
There are five main types of psoriatic arthritis:

* Asymmetric: This type affects around 70% of patients and is generally mild.  This type does not occur in the same joints on both sides of the body and usually only involves fewer than 3 joints.

* Symmetric: This type accounts for around 25% of cases, and affects joints on both sides of the body simultaneously.  This type is most similar to [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and is disabling in around 50% of all cases.

* Arthritis mutilans ({{ICD10|M|07|1|m|05}}): Affects less than 5% of patients and is a severe, deforming and destructive arthritis.  This condition can progress over months or years causing severe joint damage.  Arthritis mutilans has also been called chronic absorptive arthritis, and may be seen in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] as well.

* Spondylitis ({{ICD10|M|07|2|m|05}}): This type is characterised by stiffness of the spine or neck, but can also affect the hands and feet, in a similar fashion to symmetric arthritis.

* Distal interphalangeal predominant ({{ICD10|M|07|0|m|05}}): This type of psoriatic arthritis is found in about 5% of patients, and is characterised by inflammation and stiffness in the joints nearest to the ends of the fingers and toes.  Nail changes are often marked.

== Treatments ==

The underlying process in psoriatic arthritis is [[inflammation]], therefore treatments are directed at reducing and controlling [[inflammation]]. Milder cases of psoriatic arthitis may be treated with NSAIDS alone; however there is a trend toward earlier use of [[Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s or [[biological response modifier]]s to prevent irreversible joint destruction.

===Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs===

Typically the medications first prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are [[NSAID]]s such as [[ibuprofen]] and [[naproxen]] followed by more potent NSAIDs like [[diclofenac]], [[indomethacin]], and [[etodolac]]. NSAIDs can irritate the stomach and intestine, and long-term use can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.<ref name="pmid10377455">{{cite journal| author=Warner TD, Giuliano F, Vojnovic I, Bukasa A, Mitchell JA, Vane JR| title=Nonsteroid drug selectivities for cyclo-oxygenase-1 rather than cyclo-oxygenase-2 are associated with human gastrointestinal toxicity: a full in vitro analysis | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | year= 1999 | volume= 96 | issue= 13 | pages= 7563–8 | pmid=10377455 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.96.13.7563| pmc=22126 | url= }}</ref><ref name="pmid3085490">{{cite journal |author=Scholer DW, Ku EC, Boettcher I, Schweizer A |title=Pharmacology of diclofenac sodium |journal=Am.

===Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs===

Rather than just reducing pain and inflammation, this class of drugs helps limit the amount of joint damage that occurs in psoriatic arthritis. Most DMARDs act slowly, and may take weeks or even months to take full effect. Drugs such as [[methotrexate]] or [[leflunomide]] are commonly prescribed; other DMARDS used to treat psoriatic arthritis include [[cyclosporin]], [[azathioprine]] and [[sulfasalazine]]. These [[immunosuppressant]] drugs can also reduce psoriasis skin symptoms, but can lead to liver and kidney problems and an increased risk of serious infection.

===Biological response modifiers===

Recently, a new class of therapeutics called [[biological response modifiers]] or biologics has been developed using [[recombinant DNA]] technology. Biologic medications are derived from living cells cultured in a laboratory. Different from the traditional DMARDS that impact the entire immune system, biologics target specific parts of the immune system. They are given by injection or intravenous (IV) infusion.

Biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-α]] inhibitors, including [[infliximab]], [[etanercept]], [[golimumab]], [[certolizumab pegol]] and [[adalimumab]].   

Biologics may increase the risk of both minor and serious infections. More rarely, they may be associated with nervous system disorders, blood disorders or certain types of cancer.

===Other treatments===

Doctors may use [[joint injection]]s with [[corticosteroid]]s in cases where one joint is severely impacted. In psoriatic arthritis patients with severe joint damage [[orthopedic surgery]] may be implemented to correct joint destruction, usually with use of a [[joint replacement]]. Surgery is effective for pain alleviation, correcting joint disfigurement, and reinforcing joint usefulness and strength.

===Self care===
{{unsourced-section|date=March 2012}}
People with psoriatic arthritis and other forms of arthritis may find day to day tasks difficult. Adjustments include using gadgets such as jar openers to twist the lids from jars, lifting heavy pans or other objects with both hands, etc.
    
Maintaining a healthy weight places less strain on the joints, leading to reduced pain and increased energy and mobility. 

Regular exercise is recommended for people with arthritis to help maintain flexibility and strength. Biking (gentle), swimming and walking are commonly recommended.
 
Hot and cold packs can relieve inflamed joints. Cold has a numbing effect and can dull the sensation of pain. Heat can help relax tense muscles and relieve pain.

==Epidemiology==

Seventy percent of people who develop psoriatic arthritis first show signs of [[psoriasis]] on the skin, 15 percent develop skin psoriasis and arthritis at the same time, and 15 percent develop skin psoriasis following the onset of psoriatic arthritis.<ref>{{Cite document | publisher = [[The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center]] |title = Psoriatic Arthritis | accessdate = 2011-05-04 | url =http://www.hopkins-arthritis.org/arthritis-info/psoriatic-arthritis/#epidemiology | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> 

Psoriatic arthritis can develop in people who have any level severity of psoriatic skin disease from mild to very severe.<ref>{{Cite document | publisher = [[National Psoriasis Foundation and Arthritis Foundation]] | title = Who's At Risk | accessdate = 2011-05-04 | url = http://www.bejointsmart.org/psoriatic-arthritis-whos-at-risk | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> 

Psoriatic arthritis tends to appear about 10 years after the first signs of [[psoriasis]].  For the majority of people this is between the ages of 30 and 55, but the disease can also affect children. The onset of psoriatic arthritis symptoms before symptoms of skin psoriasis is more common in children than adults.<ref>{{Cite document | publisher = [[WebMD LLC]] | title = Psoriatic Arthritis | accessdate = 2011-05-04 | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331037-overview | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

More than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis will have psoriatic nail lesions characterized by nail pitting, separation of the nail from the underlying nail bed, ridging and cracking, or more extremely, loss of the nail itself ([[onycholysis]]).<ref>{{Cite document | publisher = [[WebMD LLC]] | title = Psoriatic Arthritis | accessdate = 2011-05-04 | url =http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331037-overview | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

Men and women are equally affected by this condition. Like [[psoriasis]], psoriatic arthritis is more common among Caucasians than Africans or Asians.<ref>{{Cite document | publisher = [[WebMD LLC]] | title = Epidemiology of Psoriatic Arthritis |accessdate = 2011-05-04 | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331037-overview#aw2aab6b6 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>
