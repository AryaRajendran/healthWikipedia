'''Malaria''' is a [[Mosquito-borne disease|mosquito-borne infectious disease]] of humans and other animals caused by [[protist]]s (a type of microorganism) of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]''. It begins with a bite from an infected female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito, which introduces the protists through saliva into the [[circulatory system]]. In the blood, the protists travel to the liver to mature and reproduce. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include [[fever]] and [[headache]], which in severe cases can progress to [[coma]] or [[death]]. The disease is widespread in [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions in a broad band around the equator, including much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]].

<!--Cause-->
Five species of ''Plasmodium'' can infect and be transmitted by humans. The vast majority of deaths are caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P.&nbsp;falciparum]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P.&nbsp;vivax]]'', while ''[[Plasmodium ovale|P.&nbsp;ovale]]'', and ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P.&nbsp;malariae]]'' cause a generally milder form of malaria that is rarely fatal.  The [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] species ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi|P.&nbsp;knowlesi]]'', prevalent in Southeast Asia, causes malaria in [[macaques]] but can also cause severe infections in humans. <!--Prevention--> Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because rainfall, warm temperatures, and stagnant waters provide habitats ideal for [[mosquito]] larvae. Disease transmission can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites by distribution of [[mosquito net]]s and [[insect repellent]]s, or with mosquito-control measures such as spraying [[insecticide]]s and draining standing water.

<!--Diagnosis-->Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using [[blood film]]s, or with [[antigen]]-based [[Malaria antigen detection tests|rapid diagnostic tests]]. Modern techniques that use the [[polymerase chain reaction]] to detect the parasite's [[DNA]] have also been developed, but these are not widely used in malaria-[[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas due to their cost and complexity.<!--Epidemiology--> The [[World Health Organization]] has estimated that in 2010, there were 219 million documented cases of malaria. That year, between 660,000 and 1.2 million people died from the disease,<ref name="Nayyar 2012"/> many of whom were children in Africa. The actual number of deaths is not known with certainty, as accurate data is unavailable in many rural areas, and many cases are undocumented. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and may also be a major hindrance to [[economic development]].

<!--Prophylaxis & treatment-->
Despite a need, no effective [[vaccine]] currently exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to malaria-endemic countries ([[malaria prophylaxis|prophylaxis]]). A variety of [[antimalarial medication]]s are available. Severe malaria is treated with [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] or [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] [[quinine]] or, since the mid-2000s, the [[artemisinin]] derivative [[artesunate]], which is superior to quinine in both children and adults and is given in combination with a second anti-malarial such as [[mefloquine]]. [[Drug resistance|Resistance]] has developed to several antimalarial drugs; for example, [[chloroquine]]-resistant ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' has spread to most malarial areas, and emerging resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of Malaria.png|thumb|250px|Main symptoms of malaria<ref name="PPID 2010"/>]]
[[File:Malaria fever.svg|thumb|350px|The typical fever patterns of the different types of malaria]]
The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection;<ref name="PPID 2010"/> however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to [[flu]]-like symptoms,<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/> and can resemble other conditions such as [[septicemia]], [[gastroenteritis]], and [[viral disease]]s.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> The presentation may include [[headache]], [[fever]], [[shivering]], [[arthralgia|joint pain]], [[vomiting]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[jaundice]], [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]], [[Retinopathy|retinal damage]],<ref name="Beare 2006"/> and [[convulsion]]s. 

The classic symptom of malaria is [[Paroxysmal attacks|paroxysm]]—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by [[Rigor (medicine)|rigor]] and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days (tertian fever) in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections, and every three days (quartan fever) for ''P.&nbsp;malariae''. ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.<ref name="Ferri 2009"/>

Severe malaria is usually caused by ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparium malaria arise 9–30 days after infection.<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/> Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit [[neurological disorder|neurological]] symptoms, including [[abnormal posturing]], [[nystagmus]], [[conjugate gaze palsy]] (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), [[opisthotonus]], [[seizure]]s, or [[coma]].<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/>

===Complications===
There are several serious [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] of malaria. Among these is the development of [[respiratory distress]], which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of [[metabolic acidosis]], noncardiogenic [[pulmonary oedema]], concomitant [[pneumonia]], and severe [[anaemia]]. [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) may develop in 5–25% in adults and up to 29% of pregnant women but it is rare in young children.<ref name="Taylor 2012"/> [[Coinfection]] of HIV with malaria increases mortality.<ref name="Korenromp 2005"/> Renal failure is a feature of [[blackwater fever]], where hemoglobin from [[lysis|lysed]] red blood cells leaks into the urine.<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/> 

Infection with ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' may result in [[cerebral malaria]], a form of severe malaria that involves [[encephalopathy]]. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever.<ref name="Beare 2011"/> Splenomegaly, severe headache, [[hepatomegaly]] (enlarged liver), [[hypoglycemia]], and hemoglobinuria with [[renal failure]] may occur.<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/>

[[Pregnancy-associated malaria|Malaria in pregnant women]] is an important cause of [[stillbirth]]s, [[infant mortality]] and [[low birth weight]],<ref name="Hartman 2010"/> particularly in ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection, but also with ''P.&nbsp;vivax''.<ref name="Rijken 2012"/>

==Cause==
Malaria [[parasite]]s belong to the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' (phylum [[Apicomplexa]]). In humans, malaria is caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P.&nbsp;falciparum]]'', ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P.&nbsp;malariae]]'', ''[[Plasmodium ovale|P.&nbsp;ovale]]'', ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P.&nbsp;vivax]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi|P.&nbsp;knowlesi]]''.<ref name="Mueller 2007"/><ref name="Collins 2012"/> Among those infected, ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' (~20%).<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> Although ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths,<ref name="Sarkar 2009"/> recent evidence suggests that ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions                        about as often as with a diagnosis of ''P. falciparum'' infection.<ref name="Baird 2013"/> ''P.&nbsp;vivax '' proportionally is more common outside of Africa.<ref name="Arnott 2012"/> There have been documented human infections with several species of ''Plasmodium'' from [[simian|higher apes]]; however, with the exception of ''P.&nbsp;knowlesi''—a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] species that causes malaria in [[macaques]]<ref name="Collins 2012"/>—these are mostly of limited public health importance.<ref name="Collins 2009"/>

===Life cycle===
[[Image:MalariacycleBig.jpg|thumb|450px|The life cycle of malaria parasites: A mosquito causes infection by taking a blood meal. First, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the liver. They infect [[liver cells]], where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells, and return to the bloodstream. Then, the merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts that in turn produce further merozoites. [[Gametocytes|Sexual forms]] are also produced, which, if taken up by a mosquito, will infect the insect and continue the life cycle.]]

In the life cycle of ''Plasmodium'', a female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito (the [[host (biology)|definitive host]]) transmits a motile infective form (called the [[sporozoite]]) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s), where it reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] (tissue [[schizogony]]), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.<ref>Schlagenhauf-Lawlor (2008), [http://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&pg=PA70 pp. 70–1.]</ref> Other merozoites develop into immature [[gametes]], or gametocytes. When a fertilised mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form [[zygote]]s ([[ookinete]]s), which develop into new sporozoites. The sporozoites migrate to the insect's [[salivary gland]]s, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, alongside saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.<ref name="Cowman 2012"/>

Only female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar, and thus do not transmit the disease. The females of the ''Anopheles'' genus of mosquito prefer to feed at night.  They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and will continue throughout the night until taking a meal.<ref name="Arrow 2004"/> Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s, although this is rare.<ref name="Owusu-Ofori 2010"/>

===Recurrent malaria===
Symptoms of malaria can reappear (recur) after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either [[recrudescence]], [[relapse]], or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.<ref>WHO (2010), p. vi.</ref> Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells. Relapse commonly occurs between 8–24 weeks and is commonly seen with ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' malaria cases in [[temperate]] areas often involve [[overwintering]] by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite.<ref name="White 2011"/> Reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure.<ref>WHO (2010), p. 17.</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{further2|[[Plasmodium falciparum biology|''Plasmodium falciparum'' biology]]}}
[[Image:Maternal malaria placenta - cropped - very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a [[placenta]] from a[[stillbirth]] due to maternal malaria. [[H&E stain]]. Red blood cells are anuclear; blue/black staining in bright red structures (red blood cells) indicate foreign nuclei from the parasites]]

Malaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the [[liver]] (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or [[erythrocyte]]s (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.<ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/>

After a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to yield thousands of [[merozoite]]s, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.<ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/> The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the [[cell membrane]] of the infected host liver cell.<ref name="Vaughan 2008"/>

Within the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.<ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/>

Some ''P.&nbsp;vivax''  sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7–10 months is typical) to several years. After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' infections,<ref name="White 2011"/> although their existence in ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' is uncertain.<ref name="Richter 2010"/>

The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<ref name="Tilley 2011"/> The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria.<ref name="Mens 2010"/> Sequestered red blood cells can breach the [[blood–brain barrier]] and cause cerebral malaria.<ref name="Rénia 2012"/>

Although the red blood cell surface adhesive proteins (called [[PfEMP1]], for ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' erythrocyte membrane protein&nbsp;1) are exposed to the immune system, they do not serve as good immune targets because of their extreme diversity; there are at least 60 variations of the protein within a single parasite and even more variants within whole parasite populations. The parasite switches through a broad repertoire of PfEMP1 surface proteins, thereby avoiding detection by protective [[antibodies]].<ref name="Rowe 2009"/>

===Genetic resistance===
{{Main|Genetic resistance to malaria}}
Due to the high levels of [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria—especially the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' species—it has placed the greatest [[selection|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including [[sickle cell trait]], [[thalassaemia]] traits, [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the absence of [[Duffy antigen]]s on red blood cells.<ref name="Kwiatkowski 2005"/><ref name="Hedrick 2011"/>

The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity is of particular interest. Sickle cell trait causes a defect in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Instead of retaining the biconcave shape of a normal red blood cell, the modified [[hemoglobin S|hemoglobin&nbsp;S]] molecule causes the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. Due to the sickle shape, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen. Infection causes red cells to sickle more, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are [[homozygous]] (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta [[allele]]) have [[sickle-cell anaemia]], while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition seems to be unfavourable to the trait's survival, the trait is preserved because of the [[heterozygote advantage|benefits]] provided by the heterozygous form.<ref name="Hedrick 2011"/><ref name="Weatherall 2008"/>

===Liver dysfunction===
Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is rare and is usually a result of a coexisting liver condition such as [[viral hepatitis]] or [[chronic liver disease]]. The syndrome is sometimes called ''malarial hepatitis'', although inflammation of the liver ([[hepatitis]]) does not actually occur.  While traditionally considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.<ref name="Bhalla 2006"/>

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Diagnosis of malaria}}
[[File:5901 lores.jpg|thumb|The blood film is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for malaria diagnosis.]]
[[File:Plasmodium.jpg|thumb|Ring-forms and [[gametocyte]]s of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' in human blood]]
Approximately 30% of people will no longer have a fever upon arriving to a health care facility. Owing to the non-specific nature of the presentation, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires a high degree of suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, [[splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]], fever without localizing signs, [[thrombocytopenia|low platelets]], and [[hyperbilirubinemia]] combined with a normal peripheral [[white blood cells|blood leukocyte count]].<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/>

Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of [[blood film]]s or by [[antigen]]-based [[Malaria antigen detection tests|rapid diagnostic tests]] (RDT).<ref name="Abba 2011"/><ref name="Kattenberg 2011"/> Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010.<ref name="Wilson 2012"/> Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.<ref name="Wilson 2012"/>

In regions where laboratory tests are readily available, malaria should be suspected, and tested for, in any unwell patient who has been in an area where malaria is endemic. In areas that cannot afford laboratory diagnostic tests, it has become routine to use only a history of subjective fever as the indication to treat for malaria—a [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|presumptive]] approach exemplified by the common teaching "fever equals malaria unless proven otherwise". A drawback of this practice is [[overdiagnosis]] of malaria and mismanagement of non-malarial fever, which wastes limited resources, erodes confidence in the health care system, and contributes to drug resistance.<ref name="Perkins 2008"/> Although [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based tests have been developed, these are not widely implemented in malaria-endemic regions as of 2012, due to their complexity.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/>

===Classification===
Malaria is classified into either "severe" or "uncomplicated" by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> It is deemed severe when ''any'' of the following criteria are present, otherwise it is considered uncomplicated.<ref>WHO (2010), p. 35.</ref>

* Decreased consciousness
* Significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk
* Inability to feed
* Two or more [[convulsions]]
* [[Low blood pressure]] (less than 70&nbsp;[[mmHg]] in adults and 50&nbsp;mmHg in children)
* [[respiratory distress|Breathing problems]]
* [[Circulatory shock]]
* [[Kidney failure]] or [[hemoglobin]] in the urine
* Bleeding problems, or hemoglobin less than 50&nbsp;g/L (5&nbsp;g/dL)
* [[Pulmonary edema]]
* [[Blood glucose]] less than 2.2&nbsp;mmol/L (40&nbsp;mg/dL)
* [[Acidosis]] or [[lactic acid|lactate]] levels of greater than 5&nbsp;mmol/L
* A parasite level in the blood of greater than 100,000 per [[microlitre]] (µL) in low-intensity transmission areas, or 250,000 per µL in high-intensity transmission areas

Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe ''P.&nbsp;falciparum''-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms, including coma (with a [[Glasgow coma scale]] less than 11, or a [[Blantyre coma scale]] greater than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.<ref>WHO (2010), p. v.</ref>

==Prevention==
<!-- The list of methods seems to put the least cost-effective first. What's the reason for that? -->
[[File:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg|thumb|An ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'' mosquito shortly after obtaining blood from a human (the droplet of blood is expelled as a surplus). This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.]]

Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe and much of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favours the parasite's reproduction.<ref name="whqlibdoc"/>

Many researchers argue that prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the [[capital cost]]s required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide disparity in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the [[Chinese province]]s—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.<ref name="Sabot 2010"/>

===Vector control===
{{further2|[[Mosquito control]]}}
[[File:Mansprayingkeroseneoil.jpg|thumb|right|Man spraying kerosene oil in standing water, [[Panama Canal Zone]] 1912]]
[[File:Mosquitoes-Killedy-By-DDT-Lake-Victoria.JPG|thumb|right|Walls where indoor residual spraying of DDT has been applied. The mosquitoes remain on the wall until they fall down dead on the floor.]]
[[Vector control]] refers to preventative methods used to decrease malaria and morbidity and mortality by reducing the levels of transmission. For individual protection, the most effective chemical [[insect repellent]]s to reduce human-mosquito contact are those based on [[DEET]] and [[picaridin]].<ref name="Kajfasz 2009"/> Insecticide-treated [[mosquito net]]s (ITNs) and [[indoor residual spraying]] (IRS) have been shown to be highly effective vector control interventions in preventing malaria morbidity and mortality among children in malaria-endemic settings.<ref name="Lengeler 2004"/><ref name="Pluess 2010"/> IRS is the practice of spraying insecticides on the interior walls of homes in malaria-affected areas. After feeding, many mosquito species rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of dwellings have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another victim and transfer the malaria parasite.<ref name="Enayati 2010"/> As of 2006, the World Health Organization advises the use of 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including [[DDT#Use against malaria|DDT]] and the pyrethroids [[cyfluthrin]] and [[deltamethrin]]).<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_HTM_MAL_2006.1112_eng.pdf Indoor Residual Spraying: Use of Indoor Residual Spraying for Scaling Up Global Malaria Control and Elimination.] World Health Organization, 2006.</ref> This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[Persistent Organic Pollutant]]s (POPs), which prohibits the agricultural use of DDT.<ref name="van den Berg 2009"/>

One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance via evolution. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS, which greatly reduces its effectiveness as a defense mechanism.<ref name="Pates 2005"/>

[[File:Midnight in Pediatric ICU.jpg|thumb|Mosquito nets create a protective barrier against malaria-carrying mosquitoes that bite at night.]]
Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and significantly reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria.  Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.<ref name="Raghavendra 2011"/> Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="Howitt 2012"/> Although ITNs prevent malaria, only about 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries own them.<ref name="Miller 2007"/>  A recommended practice for usage is to hang a large "bed net" above the center of a bed to drape over it completely with the edges tucked in. [[Pyrethroid]]-treated nets and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets offer the best personal protection, and are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.<ref>Schlagenhauf-Lawlor (2008), [http://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&pg=PA215 p. 215.]</ref>

===Other methods===
Community participation and [[health education]] strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world.<ref name="Lalloo 2006"/>  Recognizing the disease in the early stages can stop the disease from becoming fatal.  Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.<ref name="Mehlhorn 2008"/> [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants,<ref name="Bardají 2012"/> and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.<ref name="Meremikwu 2012"/>

===Medications===
{{Main|Malaria prophylaxis}}
Several drugs, most of which are used for treatment of malaria, can be taken to prevent contracting the disease during travel to endemic areas. [[Chloroquine]] may be used where the parasite is still sensitive.<ref name="Jacquerioz 2009"/> Because of the prevalence of drug-resistant ''Plasmodium'', one of three medications—[[mefloquine]] (''Lariam''), [[doxycycline]] (available generically), or the combination of [[atovaquone]] and [[proguanil]] hydrochloride (''Malarone'')—is frequently needed.<ref name="Jacquerioz 2009"/> Doxycycline and the atovaquone and proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and higher rates of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.<ref name="Jacquerioz 2009"/>

The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and should continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (with the exception of atovaquone proguanil that only needs to be started two days prior and continued for seven days afterwards).<ref name="Freedman 2008"/> Use of prophylactic drugs is seldom practical for full-time residents of malaria-endemic areas, and their use is usually restricted to short-term visitors and travellers to malarial regions. This is due to the cost of purchasing the drugs, negative [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]s from long-term use, and because some effective anti-malarial drugs are difficult to obtain outside of wealthy nations.<ref name="Fernando 2011"/> The use of prophylactic drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial immunity.<ref name="Turschner 2009"/>

==Treatment==
{{Further|Antimalarial medication}}

The treatment of malaria depends on the severity of the disease. Uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications. The most effective strategy for ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection is the use of [[artemisinin]]s in combination with other antimalarials (known as [[artemisinin-combination therapy]], or ACT), which reduces the ability of the parasite to develop resistance to any single drug component.<ref name="Kokwaro 2009"/> These additional antimalarials include [[amodiaquine]], [[lumefantrine]], mefloquine or [[sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine]].<ref>WHO (2010, pp. 75–86.</ref> Another recommended combination is [[dihydroartemisinin]] and [[piperaquine]].<ref>WHO (2010), p. 21.</ref><ref name="Keating 2012"/> ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria.<ref name="Howitt 2012"/> To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus [[clindamycin]] early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters).<ref name="Manyando 2012"/> In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia.<ref name="O'Brien 2011"/><ref name="Fairhurst 2012"/>

Severe malaria requires the [[parenteral administration]] of antimalarial drugs. Until the mid-2000s the most used treatment for severe malaria was quinine, but [[artesunate]] has been shown to be superior to quinine in both children and adults.<ref name="Sinclair 2012"/> Treatment of severe malaria also involves supportive measures that are optimally performed in a [[critical care unit]], including management of high fevers ([[hyperpyrexia]]) and the subsequent seizures that may result from it, and monitoring for [[respiratory depression]], hypoglycemia, and [[hypokalemia]].<ref name="Sarkar 2009"/> Infection with ''P.&nbsp;vivax'', ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' or ''P.&nbsp;malariae'' is usually treated on an outpatient basis (while a person is at home). Treatment of ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) as well as clearance of liver forms with [[primaquine]].<ref name="Waters 2012"/>

When properly treated, people with malaria can usually expect a complete recovery.<ref name="CDC Malaria"/> However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days.<ref name="Trampuz 2003"/> In the most severe cases of the disease, [[fatality rate]]s can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria.<ref name="Fernando 2010"/> Chronic infection without severe disease can occur, a form of acquired immunity where the immune system is also less responsive to ''[[Salmonella]]'' and the [[Epstein–Barr virus]].<ref name="Riley 2013"/>

Malaria causes widespread anemia during a period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage. This neurologic damage results from cerebral malaria to which children are more vulnerable.<ref name="Fernando 2010"/> Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioural disorders]], and [[epilepsy]].<ref name="Idro 2010"/> Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in [[clinical trial]]s when compared to [[placebo]] groups.<ref name="Fernando 2010"/>

The WHO estimates that in 2010 there were 219 million cases of malaria resulting in 660,000 deaths,<ref name="World Malaria Report 2012"/> equivalent to roughly 2000 deaths every day.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> Using a different set of predictive models to estimate mortality, a 2012 study determined the number of documented and undocumented deaths in 2010 to be 1.24 million.<ref name="lancet-glob-mal-mort"/> The majority of cases (65%) occur in children under 15 years old.<ref name="lancet-glob-mal-mort"/> About 125 million pregnant women are at risk of infection each year; in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], maternal malaria is associated with up to 200,000 estimated infant deaths yearly.<ref name="Hartman 2010"/>  There are about 10,000 malaria cases per year in Western Europe, and 1300–1500 in the United States.<ref name="Taylor 2012"/> About 900 people died from the disease in Europe between 1993 and 2003.<ref name="Kajfasz 2009"/>  Both the global incidence of disease and resulting mortality have declined in recent years. According to the WHO, deaths attributable to malaria in 2010 were reduced by over a third from a 2000 estimate of 985,000, largely due to the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based combination therapies.<ref name="Howitt 2012"/>

Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur.<ref name="Layne 2006"/> An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were [[Ivory Coast]] with 86.15, [[Angola]] (56.93) and [[Burkina Faso]] (50.66).<ref name="Provost 2011"/> An estimate for 2010 said the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, [[Mozambique]] and [[Mali]].<ref name="lancet-glob-mal-mort"/> The [[Malaria Atlas Project]] aims to map global [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] levels of malaria, providing a means with which to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess [[disease burden]].<ref name="Guerra 2007"/><ref name="Hay 2010"/> This effort led to the publication of a map of ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' endemicity in 2010.<ref name="Gething 2011"/> As of 2010, about 100 countries have endemic malaria.<ref name="World Malaria Report 2012"/><ref name="Feachem 2010"/> Every year, 125 million international travellers visit these countries, and more than 30,000 contract the disease.<ref name="Kajfasz 2009"/>

The geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found close to each other.<ref name="Greenwood 2002"/> Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters in which mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding.<ref name="Jamieson 2006"/> In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall.<ref name="Abeku 2007"/> Malaria is more common in rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes.<ref name="Cui 2012"/> In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.<ref name="Machault 2011"/>

==History==
{{Main|History of malaria}}

Although the parasite responsible for ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria has been in existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture<ref name="Harper 2011"/> and the development of human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria may have originated in gorillas.<ref name="Prugnolle 2012"/>

References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout recorded history, beginning in 2700 BC in China.<ref name="Cox 2002"/> Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the [[Roman Empire]],<ref>{{Cite news |title=DNA clues to malaria in ancient Rome |date=February 20, 2001 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1180469.stm}}, in reference to {{Cite journal |journal=Ancient Biomolecules |title=Biomolecular archaeology of malaria |author=Sallares R, Gomzi S |volume=3 |issue=3 |year= 2001 |pages=195–213 |oclc=538284457}}</ref> and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the "[[Roman Fever (disease)|Roman fever]]".<ref name="Sallares 2003"/> Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of [[Sardinia]], the [[Pontine Marshes]], the lower regions of coastal [[Etruria]] and the city of [[Rome]] along the [[Tiber River]]. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, runoff from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.<ref name="Hays 2005"/>
[[File:Ronald Ross.jpg|thumb|right|British doctor [[Ronald Ross]] received the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1902 for his work on malaria.]]
The term malaria originates from [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] {{lang-it|mala aria}}&nbsp;— "[[miasma theory of disease|bad air]]"; the disease was formerly called ''ague'' or ''marsh fever'' due to its association with swamps and marshland.<ref name="Reiter 2000"/> Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America,<ref name="Lindemann 1999"/> where it is no longer endemic,<ref name="Gratz 2006"/> though imported cases do occur.<ref name="Webb 2009"/>

Malaria was the most important health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during [[World War II]], where about 500,000 men were infected.<ref name="Bray 2004"/> According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, "Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns."<ref name="Byrne 2008"/> Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]]—a French army doctor working in the military hospital of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in [[Algeria]]—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time. He therefore proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, the first time a [[protist]] was identified as causing disease.<ref name="Laveran bio"/> For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]].  A year later, [[Carlos Finlay]], a Cuban doctor treating people with [[yellow fever]] in [[Havana]], provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans.<ref name="Tan 2008"/> This work followed earlier suggestions by [[Josiah C. Nott]],<ref name="Chernin 1983"/> and work by [[Sir Patrick Manson]], the "father of tropical medicine", on the transmission of [[filariasis]].<ref name="Chernin 1977"/>

In April 1894, a Scottish physician [[Ronald Ross|Sir Ronald Ross]] visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1898 when Ross, who was working in the [[Presidency General Hospital]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.<ref name="Ross bio"/> For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] and directed malaria-control efforts in [[Egypt]], [[Panama]], [[Greece]] and [[Mauritius]].<ref name="CDC Ross"/> The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by [[Walter Reed]] in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by [[William C. Gorgas]] in [[Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal|the health measures undertaken]] during construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.<ref name="Simmons 1979"/>

The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]], which contains [[quinine]]. This tree grows on the slopes of the [[Andes]], mainly in [[Peru]]. The [[indigenous peoples]] of Peru made a [[tincture]] of cinchona to control fever.  Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the [[Jesuit]]s introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640; by 1677, it was included in the [[London Pharmacopoeia]] as an antimalarial treatment.<ref name="Kaufman 2005"/> It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]].<ref name="Pelletier 1820"/><ref name="Kyle 1974"/>
[[File:Artemisia annua West Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|''Artemisia annua'' contains the antimalarial drug artemisin.]]
Quinine become the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s, when other medications began to be developed. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.<ref name="Achan 2011"/> Artemisinins, discovered by Chinese scientist [[Tu Youyou]] in the 1970s from the plant ''[[Artemisia annua]]'', became the recommended treatment for ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria, administered in combination with other antimalarials as well as in severe disease.<ref name="Hsu 2006"/>

The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was DDT.<ref name="CDC history"/> Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to [[agriculture]]. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of [[pesticide resistance|resistant]] mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be compared to [[antibiotic resistance]] shown by bacteria.  During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.<ref name="van den Berg 2009"/> Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound [[Paris Green]] to places with standing water.<ref name="Killeen 2002"/>

Malaria vaccines have been an elusive goal of research.  The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-[[Attenuator (genetics)|attenuated]] sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies within humans.<ref name="Vanderberg 2009"/>

==Society and culture==
{{see also|World Malaria Day}}
=== Economic impact ===
[[File:Saving Lives with SMS for Life.jpg|thumb|right|Malaria clinic in Tanzania]]

Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to [[economic development]].<ref name="IftSoL"/><ref name="Worrall 2005"/> Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.<ref name="Humphreys 2001"/>

A comparison of average per capita [[GDP]] in 1995, adjusted for [[purchasing power parity|parity of purchasing power]], between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference ($1,526 USD versus $8,268 USD). In countries where malaria is common, average per capita GDP has risen (between 1965 and 1990) only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.<ref name="Sachs 2002"/>

Poverty can increase the risk of malaria, since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa $12 billion USD every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.<ref name="Greenwood 2005"/> The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of [[outpatient]] visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.<ref name="Roll Back Malaria WHO"/>

Cerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.<ref name="Idro 2010"/> Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.<ref name="Fernando 2010"/> Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching [[socioeconomic]] consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.<ref name="Ricci 2012"/>

===Counterfeit and substandard drugs===
Sophisticated [[counterfeit drugs|counterfeits]] have been found in several Asian countries such as [[Cambodia]],<ref name="Lon 2006"/> [[People's Republic of China|China]],<ref name="Newton 2008"/> [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]], and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries.<ref name="Newton 2006"/> The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater [[Mekong]] region and have established a rapid alert system to enable information about counterfeit drugs to be rapidly reported to the relevant authorities in participating countries.<ref name="Parry 2005"/> There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.<ref name="Gautam 2009"/>

Another clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging.<ref name="Caudron 2008"/> A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.<ref name="Nayyar 2012"/>

===War===
[[File:"Don't go to Bed with Malaria Mosquito" - NARA - 514146.tif|thumb|right|World War II poster]]
Throughout history, the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers, nation-states, military personnel, and military actions.<ref name="Russell 2009"/> In 1910, [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]]-winner Ronald Ross (himself a malaria survivor), published a book titled ''The Prevention of Malaria'' that included a chapter titled "The Prevention of Malaria in War." The chapter's author, Colonel C. H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at [[Royal Army Medical College]] in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: "The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era. ... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin."<ref name="Ross 1910"/>

Significant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new anti-malarial agents. During [[World War I]] and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural anti-malaria drugs [[cinchona bark]] and quinine prompted substantial funding into [[research and development]] of other drugs and vaccines.  American military organizations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]], and the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] of the US Armed Forces.<ref name="malariasite1"/>

Additionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], or CDC) established in 1946.  According to the CDC, MCWA "was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic".<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Eradication efforts===
Several notable attempts are being made to eliminate the parasite from sections of the world, or to eradicate it worldwide.  In 2006, the organization [[Malaria No More]] set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization plans to dissolve if that goal is accomplished.<ref name="Strom 2011"/>  Several [[malaria vaccine]]s are in clinical trials, which are intended to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the speed of transmission of the disease.  As of 2012, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] has distributed 230 million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-born transmission of malaria.<ref name="Global Fund"/> The U.S.-based [[Clinton Foundation]] has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market.<ref name="WSJ 2008"/>  Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict the spread of malaria based on the availability of habitat of malaria-carrying parasites.<ref name="Guerra 2007"/>

Malaria has been successfully eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but [[vector control]] programs, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in [[water management]] practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings.<ref name="Meade 2010"/> Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, and the use of the [[pesticide]] [[DDT]] and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s.<ref name="Williams 1963"/> (see [[National Malaria Eradication Program]]) In [[Suriname]], the disease has been cleared from its capital city and coastal areas through a three-pronged approach initiated by the [[Global Malaria Eradication program]] in 1955, involving: vector control through the use of DDT and IRS; regular collection of blood smears from the population to identify existing malaria cases; and providing chemotherapy to all affected individuals.<ref name="Breeveld 2012"/> [[Bhutan]] is pursuing an aggressive malaria elimination strategy, and has achieved a 98.7% decline in microscopy-confirmed cases from 1994 to 2010. In addition to vector control techniques such as IRS in high-risk areas and thorough distribution of long-lasting ITNs, factors such as economic development and increasing access to health services have contributed to Bhutan's successes in reducing malaria incidence.<ref name="Yangzom 2012"/>

==Research==
{{See also|Malaria vaccine}}
Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria does occur naturally, but only in response to years of repeated infection.<ref name="Tran 2012"/> An individual can be protected from a ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of [[X-ray]] [[irradiation]].<ref name="Hill 2011"/> An effective [[Vaccination|vaccine]] is not yet available for malaria, although several are under development.<ref name="Geels 2011"/> The highly [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] nature of many ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.<ref name="Cromptom 2010"/> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.<ref name="Graves 2006b"/> For example, [[SPf66]] was tested extensively in endemic areas in the 1990s, but clinical trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.<ref name="Graves 2006"/> Several potential vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite's life cycle are being developed, with [[RTS,S]] as the leading candidate;<ref name="Hill 2011"/> it is expected to be licensed in 2015.<ref name="Riley 2013"/> A US biotech company, [[Sanaria]], is developing a pre-erythrocytic [[attenuated vaccine]] called PfSPZ that uses whole sporozoites to induce an immune response.<ref name="Hoffman 2010"/> In 2006, the [[Malaria Vaccine Advisory Committee]] to the WHO outlined a "Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap" that has as one of its landmark objectives to "develop and license a first-generation malaria vaccine that has a protective efficacy of more than 50% against severe disease and death and lasts longer than one year" by 2015.<ref name="Roadmap 2006"/>

Malaria parasites contain [[apicoplast]]s, organelles usually found in plants, complete with their own [[genome]]s. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]] of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as [[fatty acid biosynthesis]]. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.<ref name="Kalanon 2010"/>

With the onset of drug-resistant ''Plasmodium'' parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic [[pyridoxal]]-amino acid [[adduct]]s, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B-vitamins.<ref name="Müller 2010"/><ref name="Du 2011"/> Antimalarial drugs using [[Organometallic chemistry|synthetic metal-based]] [[coordination complex|complexes]] are attracting research interest.<ref name="Biot 2012"/><ref name="Roux 2012"/>

A non-chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in [[genetic engineering]] technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. [[Sterile insect technique]] is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile males mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.<ref name="Raghavendra 2011"/>

==Other animals==
Nearly 200 parasitic ''Plasmodium'' species have been identified that infect [[Plasmodium species infecting birds|birds]], [[Plasmodium species infecting reptiles|reptiles]], and [[Plasmodium species infecting mammals other than primates|other mammals]],<ref name="Rich 2006"/> and about 30 species naturally infect non-human primates.<ref name="Baird 2009"/> Some of the malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as [[model organism]]s for human malarial parasites, such as ''[[Plasmodium coatneyi|P.&nbsp;coatneyi]]'' (a model for ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'') and ''[[Plasmodium cynomolgi|P.&nbsp;cynomolgi]]'' (''P.&nbsp;vivax''). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP are similar to those employed for humans.<ref name="Ameri 2010"/> Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as ''[[Plasmodium berghei|P.&nbsp;berghei]]''.<ref name="Mlambo 2008"/> [[Avian malaria]] primarily affects species of the order [[Passeriformes]], and poses a substantial threat to birds of [[Hawaii]], the [[Galapagos]], and other [[archipelago]]es. The parasite ''[[Plasmodium relictum|P.&nbsp;relictum]]'' is known to play a role in limiting the distribution and abundance of [[endemic birds of Hawaii|endemic Hawaiian birds]]. [[Global warming]] is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.<ref name="LaPointe 2012"/>
