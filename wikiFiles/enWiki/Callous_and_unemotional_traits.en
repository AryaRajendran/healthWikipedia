 }}'''Callous and unemotional (CU) traits''' are distinguished by a persistent pattern of behavior that reflects a disregard for others, and also a lack of [[empathy]] and generally deficient [[affect (psychology)|affect]].  The interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors may play a role in the expression of these [[Trait theory|traits]] as a [[conduct disorder]] (CD).

A CU specifier has been proposed for inclusion as a distinct subset of conduct disorder in the fifth revision of the  ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]).<ref name="Frick_Moffitt_2010">{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}} {{cite web |author=Frick PJ, Moffitt TE |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2010 |title=A Proposal to the DSM-V Childhood Disorders and the ADHD and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Work Groups to Include a Specifier to the Diagnosis of Conduct Disorder based on the Presence of Callous-Unemotional Traits |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Proposed%20Revision%20Attachments/Proposal%20for%20Callous%20and%20Unemotional%20Specifier%20of%20Conduct%20Disorder.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref> However a 2008 review concluded that CU does not as yet have the required [[evidence-based medicine|evidence base]] to be included as a new [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] in DSM-5.<ref name= Moffitt_2008>{{cite journal | author = Moffitt TE, Arseneault L, Jaffee SR, Kim-Cohen J, Koenen KC, Odgers CL, Slutske WS, Viding E | title = Research review: DSM-V conduct disorder: research needs for an evidence base | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–33 | year = 2008 | month = January | pmid = 18181878 | pmc = 2822647 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01823.x }}</ref>

==Classification==

The proposed addition "with significant callous-unemotional traits" to the conduct disorder diagnosis in DSM-5 is an attempt to classify a specific subgroup of antisocial youth<ref name="Frick_Moffitt_2010" /> that possess  distinquishing antisocial behaviors and psychopathic traits.<ref name="Frick_White_2008">{{cite journal | author = Frick PJ, White SF | title = Research review: the importance of callous-unemotional traits for developmental models of aggressive and antisocial behavior | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 359–75 | year = 2008 | month = April | pmid = 18221345 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01862.x }}</ref> The provision of the CU specifier for CD youth is claimed to improve the diagnostic power, treatment options, and increase the understanding [[life course approach|life-course outcomes]].<ref name="Frick_White_2008"/> However a 2008 review said that "reasonable rationales" had been advanced for the inclusion of this qualifier, but that better and more research was needed to justify inclusion.<ref name=Moffitt_2008/>

==Symptoms==

===Behavioral===

Children with CU traits have distinct problems in emotional and behavioral regulation that distinguish them from other antisocial youth and show more similarity to characteristics found in adult [[psychopathy]].<ref name="Frick_2009">{{cite journal | author = Frick PJ | title = Extending the construct of psychopathy to youth: implications for understanding, diagnosing, and treating antisocial children and adolescents | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 803–12 | year = 2009 | month = December | pmid = 20047719 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Young adolescents with higher levels of CU traits were more likely to engage in direct and indirect forms of [[bullying]].<ref name = "Viding_2009">{{primary source-inline|date=April 2012}} {{cite journal | author = Viding E, Simmonds E, Petrides KV, Frederickson N | title = The contribution of callous-unemotional traits and conduct problems to bullying in early adolescence | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–81 | year = 2009 | month = April | pmid = 19207635 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02012.x }}</ref><ref name="Crapanzano_2010">{{primary source-inline|date=April 2012}} {{cite journal | author = Crapanzano AM, Frick PJ, Terranova AM | title = Patterns of physical and relational aggression in a school-based sample of boys and girls | journal = J Abnorm Child Psychol | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–45 | year = 2010 | month = May | pmid = 20013045 | doi = 10.1007/s10802-009-9376-3 | url = }}</ref><ref name="Muñoz_2011">{{primary source-inline|date=April 2012}} {{cite journal | author = Muñoz LC, Qualter P, Padgett G | title = Empathy and bullying: exploring the influence of callous-unemotional traits | journal = Child Psychiatry Hum Dev | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–96 | year = 2011 | month = April | pmid = 20886285 | doi = 10.1007/s10578-010-0206-1 | url = }}</ref> In general, children or adolescents with CU traits exhibit more severe and instrumental displays of aggression than individuals with non CU conduct disorder.<ref name="Frick_2009"/>

===Cognitive===
[[Anti-social behaviour|Antisocial]] youth with CU traits tend to have a range of distinctive cognitive characteristics. They are often less sensitive to punishment cues, particularly when they are already keen for a reward<ref name = "Frick_Dickens_2006"/> and tend to expect more positive outcomes in aggressive situations with peers.<ref name="Pardini_2004">{{cite journal | author = Pardini D, Lochman J, Wells K | title = Negative emotions and alcohol use initiation in high-risk boys: the moderating effect of good inhibitory control | journal = J Abnorm Child Psychol | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 505–18 | year = 2004 | month = October | pmid = 15500030 | doi = 10.1023/B:JACP.0000037780.22849.23 }}</ref>

==Causes==

===Neural mechanisms===
Abnormally low [[cortisol]] levels may be a [[biomarker|biological marker]] for individuals with CU traits.<ref name="Loney_2006">{{cite journal | author = Loney BR, Butler MA, Lima EN, Counts CA, Eckel LA | title = The relation between salivary cortisol, callous-unemotional traits, and conduct problems in an adolescent non-referred sample | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 30–6 | year = 2006 | month = January | pmid = 16405638 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01444.x }}</ref> Research has found that CU males had lower resting cortisol levels, and therefore lower hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|HPA]] axis activity, compared to healthy individuals.<ref name="Loney_2006" /> The fearlessness theory of CU traits suggests that low amounts of cortisol lead to underarousal, causing impairments in fear processing, a trait seen in CU individuals.<ref name="Hawes_2009" >{{cite journal | author = Hawes DJ, Brennan J, Dadds MR | title = Cortisol, callous-unemotional traits, and pathways to antisocial behavior | journal = Curr Opin Psychiatry | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–62 | year = 2009 | month = July | pmid = 19455037 | doi = 10.1097/YCO.0b013e32832bfa6d }}</ref> Hypoactivity in the HPA axis in combination with environmental stressors is thought to cause the development of antisocial behavior.<ref name="van_Goozen_2000">{{cite journal | author = van Goozen SH, Matthys W, Cohen-Kettenis PT, Buitelaar JK, van Engeland H | title = Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system activity in disruptive children and matched controls | journal = J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry | volume = 39 | issue = 11 | pages = 1438–45 | year = 2000 | month = November | pmid = 11068900 | doi = 10.1097/00004583-200011000-00019 }}</ref> However, recent studies have found that hypoactivity in the HPA in combination with CU traits seem to cause antisocial behavior even without external hardships.<ref name="Hawes_2009" />  

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|FMRI]] research has demonstrated that decreased [[amygdala]] activation in response to fearful faces as well as distress based social cues is seen in children with CU traits.<ref name="Marsh_2008">{{cite journal | author = Marsh AA, Finger EC, Mitchell DG, Reid ME, Sims C, Kosson DS, Towbin KE, Leibenluft E, Pine DS, Blair RJ | title = Reduced amygdala response to fearful expressions in children and adolescents with callous-unemotional traits and disruptive behavior disorders | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 165 | issue = 6 | pages = 712–20 | year = 2008 | month = June | pmid = 18281412 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07071145 }}</ref>  Further research has demonstrated decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and regulatory regions.

===Genetic ===
[[Twin studies]] have found CU traits to be highly heritable, and not significantly related to environmental factors such as socioeconomic status, school quality, or parent quality.<ref name="Frick_White_2008"/> Two twin studies have suggested a significant genetic influence for CU, with an estimated average amount of variation (42.5%) in CU traits accounted for by genetic effects.<ref name="Frick_White_2008"/> A substantial proportion of this genetic variation occurred independent of other dimensions of psychopathy.<ref name="Frick_White_2008"/> Children with conduct problems who also exhibit high levels of CU traits reflect a particularly high heritability rate of 0.81, as reflected in [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] research.<ref name="Frick_Dickens_2006"/>

Maltreatment and parenting may play a role in the development of antisocial behavior, but better research is needed to understand the interaction between genetic and epigenetic factors.<ref name=Viding_2008>{{cite journal | author = Viding E, Larsson H, Jones AP | title = Quantitative genetic studies of antisocial behaviour | journal = Philos.

==Diagnosis==
Research has attempted to subtype youth with callous and unemotional traits by distinguishing between those with childhood-onset versus adolescent-onset conduct disorder, conduct disorder [[comorbidity|co-morbid]] with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), or by the severity and type of aggression displayed.<ref name="Frick_2009">{{cite journal | author = Frick PJ | title = Extending the construct of psychopathy to youth: implications for understanding, diagnosing, and treating antisocial children and adolescents | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 803–12 | year = 2009 | month = December | pmid = 20047719 | doi = }}</ref> The Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU) assesses three independent factors in CU traits: uncaring, callous, and unemotional.<ref name="Kimonis_2008">{{cite journal | author = Kimonis ER, Frick PJ, Skeem JL, Marsee MA, Cruise K, Munoz LC, Aucoin KJ, Morris AS | title = Assessing callous-unemotional traits in adolescent offenders: validation of the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits | journal = Int J Law Psychiatry | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–52 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18514315 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijlp.2008.04.002 }}</ref> The ICU has been studied in both male and female populations.<ref name="Essau_2006">{{cite journal | author = Essau CA, Sasagawa S, Frick PJ | title = Callous-unemotional traits in a community sample of adolescents | journal = Assessment | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 454–69 | year = 2006 | month = December | pmid = 17050915 | doi = 10.1177/1073191106287354 }}</ref> The severity of CD has been studied in children rated high on CU traits.<ref name = "Frick_Dickens_2006"/> Children are typically diagnosed with CU traits between third and seventh grade although they have been shown to remain fairly constant throughout adolescence.<ref name="Frick_2005">{{primary source-inline|date=April 2012}} {{cite journal | author = Frick PJ, Stickle TR, Dandreaux DM, Farrell JM, Kimonis ER | title = Callous-unemotional traits in predicting the severity and stability of conduct problems and delinquency | journal = J Abnorm Child Psychol | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–87 | year = 2005 | month = August | pmid = 16118993 | doi = 10.1007/s10648-005-5728-9 }}</ref>

The addition of a CU specifier for conduct disorder has been proposed for DSM-5.<ref name=DSM5>{{cite web | url= http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=424 |title= Proposed revision APA DSM-5 |year= 2012 | work= Q 06.1 Callous and unemotional specifier for conduct cisorder |publisher= American Psychiatric Association |accessdate= April 25, 2012}}</ref>

==Management==
Though CU traits are relatively stable, they can decrease over time through effective treatment.<ref name="Frick_White_2008"/> Early intervention is thought to be more effective because CU traits are thought to be more malleable early in life.<ref name="Frick_Ellis_1999">{{cite journal | author = Frick PJ, Ellis M | title = Callous-unemotional traits and subtypes of conduct disorder | journal = Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 149–68 | year = 1999 | month = September | pmid = 11227072 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021803005547 }}</ref>

===Parenting techniques===
Parenting interventions are the best treatment for early onset antisocial behaviors in children.<ref name = "Dadds_2008">{{cite journal | author = Dadds MR, Rhodes T | title = Aggression in young children with concurrent callous-unemotional traits: can the neurosciences inform progress and innovation in treatment approaches? | journal = Philos.

Quality parenting can decrease the manifestation of CU traits.<ref name="Frick_White_2008"/> Children with high CU traits are less responsive to time-out and other punishing techniques than are healthy children as time-out does not seem to bother them, so their behavior does not improve.<ref name="Loeber_2009">{{cite journal | author = Loeber R, Burke JD, Pardini DA | title = Development and etiology of disruptive and delinquent behavior | journal = Annu Rev Clin Psychol | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 291–310 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19154139 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.032408.153631 }}</ref> Reward-based disciplining techniques, such as praise and reinforcement, tend to have a greater effect than punishing techniques on children with high CU traits.<ref name="Frick_Dickens_2006"/>

===Medication and therapy===
Behavioral therapy alone does not seem to reduce CU traits over time.{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}<ref name="Frick_White_2008"/> However, people with CU traits respond just as well as those without CU traits if medication, such as [[methylphenidate]], is combined with behavioral therapy.<ref name="Frick_White_2008"/>

===Multi-component treatment===
Taking an approach involving multiple forms of intervention is helpful in improving CU traits and maintaining those improvements over at least a three-year period of time.{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}<ref name="Kolko_2009">{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}} {{cite journal | author = Kolko DJ, Dorn LD, Bukstein OG, Pardini D, Holden EA, Hart J | title = Community vs. clinic-based modular treatment of children with early-onset ODD or CD: a clinical trial with 3-year follow-up | journal = J Abnorm Child Psychol | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 591–609 | year = 2009 | month = July | pmid = 19221871 | doi = 10.1007/s10802-009-9303-7 }}</ref> Different types of intervention exist and can be combined to have a lasting effect on children high in CU traits.{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}<ref name="Kolko_2009" /> For a child with CU traits, cognitive behavioral therapy can be used for skills training, and medication is especially helpful for those with both CU traits and ADHD.<ref name="Frick_White_2008" /> Parent training can help parents learn how to best discipline children with CU traits.{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}<ref name="Hawes_Dadds_2007">{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}} {{cite journal | author = Hawes DJ, Dadds MR | title = Stability and malleability of callous-unemotional traits during treatment for childhood conduct problems | journal = J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 347–55 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17658979 | doi = 10.1080/15374410701444298 }}</ref> Group forms of intervention, including parent-child/family therapy and school programming/teacher consultation, can also be successful.<ref name="Kolko_2009" /> To improve social skills and the social interactions of those with CU, possible treatments include peer relations/community activities development and crisis management on a case-by-case basis.<ref name="Kolko_2009" />

==Prognosis==
Childhood-onset CU shows a more aggressive and stable pattern of antisocial behavior with higher rates of CU traits, as well as more severe temperamental and [[neuropsychological]] risk factors relative to their adolescent-onset counterparts.<ref name="Moffitt_2006" /> Children with combined CD and ADHD are more likely to show features associated with psychopathy, but only in those who have high rates of CU traits.<ref name="Barry_2000" /> In support of the idea of lifetime persistence of CU traits, childhood-onset delinquency has been more strongly associated with psychopathic traits than adolescent-onset delinquency.<ref name="Moffitt_2002">{{cite journal | author = Moffitt TE, Caspi A, Harrington H, Milne BJ | title = Males on the life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited antisocial pathways: follow-up at age 26 years | journal = Dev.

==History==
Due to the potential severity of antisocial and violent traits seen in adult psychopathy, research has focused on identifying the associated traits in childhood. In adult psychopathy, individuals with primarily [[affect (psychology)|affective]] and interpersonal deficits show a distinct etiology<ref name="Hare_2008">{{cite journal | author = Hare RD, Neumann CS | title = Psychopathy as a clinical and empirical construct | journal = Annu Rev Clin Psychol | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 217–46 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18370617 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091452 }}</ref> compared to individuals with antisocial, affective and interpersonal traits.{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}<ref name = "Poythress_2010">{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}} {{cite journal | author = Poythress NG, Edens JF, Skeem JL, Lilienfeld SO, Douglas KS, Frick PJ, Patrick CJ, Epstein M, Wang T | title = Identifying subtypes among offenders with antisocial personality disorder: a cluster-analytic study | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 389–400 | year = 2010 | month = May | pmid = 20455611 | doi = 10.1037/a0018611 }}</ref> Similarly, different subtypes of aggressive and antisocial behaviors in youth may predict distinct problem-behaviors and risk factors.<ref name="Frick_Moffitt_2010" /> There have been a number of attempts to officially designate psychopathic-like traits in antisocial youths based on the affective and interpersonal traits of psychopathy. The third edition of the ''[[DSM III|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM III) divided conduct disorder into four subtypes: unsocialized-aggressive, undersocialized-nonaggressive, socialized-aggressive, and socialized-nonaggressive in an attempt to recognize the existence of psychopathic traits in children.<ref name="Barry_2000">{{cite journal | author = Barry CT, Frick PJ, DeShazo TM, McCoy MG, Ellis M, Loney BR | title = The importance of callous-unemotional traits for extending the concept of psychopathy to children | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 335–40 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10895572 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.109.2.335 }}</ref> The distinction between "socialized" and "unsocialized" children was the most pertinent in distinguishing between psychopathic-like youths.  According to these definitions, "undersocialized" children exhibited characteristic behaviors of psychopathy, including: lack of empathy, lack of affection, and inappropriate social relationships (DSM III). This differed from "socialized" individuals, who were able to form healthy social attachments to others, and whose aggressive and antisocial acts typically derived from engagement in a deviant social group (e.g. youth gangs).<ref name="Frick_Moffitt_2010" />

Following the publication of DSM-III, these distinctions prompted research, but there were still issues with the terminology in diagnosing the core features of the undersocialized versus socialized subtype.<ref name="Frick_Moffitt_2010" /> The word ''undersocialized'' was used in order to avoid the negative connotations of ''psychopathy'', but was commonly misinterpreted to mean that the child was not well socialized by parents or lacked a peer group.<ref name="Frick_Moffitt_2010" /> Also, the operational definition failed to include dimensions that could reliably predict the affective and interpersonal deficits in psychopathic-like youths.<ref name="Frick_Moffitt_2010" /> Due to these issues, the American Psychiatric Association removed the undersocialized and socialized distinctions from the conduct disorder description in the DSM after the third edition. The only subtypes that have been included in the manual since then relate to the time of onset: childhood-onset (before age 10), adolescent-onset (absence of antisocial traits before age 10), and unspecified-onset.<ref name="Frick_Moffitt_2010" /><ref name="Moffitt_2006">{{cite book | author = Moffitt TE | title = Developmental psychopathology | chapter = Life-course persistent versus adolescence-limited antisocial behavior | edition = 2  | editor = Cicchetti D, Cohen DJ |publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year = 2006 | location = New Jersey | pages = 570–98 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UlQjE-Ka09sC&pg=PA570 | isbn = 978-0-470-05006-4 |oclc=300282429 }}</ref>
