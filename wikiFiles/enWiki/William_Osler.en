'''Sir William Osler, 1st Baronet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|z|.|l|ə}}, July 12, 1849 – December 29, 1919) was a Canadian physician. He was one of the "Big Four" founding professors at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] as the first Professor of Medicine and founder of the Medical Service there. (The "Big Four" were William Osler, Professor of Medicine; [[William Stewart Halsted]], Professor of Surgery; [[Howard A. Kelly]], Professor of Gynecology; and [[William H. Welch]], Professor of Pathology.) Osler created the first residency program for specialty training of physicians, and he was the first to bring medical students out of the lecture hall for bedside clinical training.<ref name = "Big Four">[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/history5.html Johns Hopkins Medicine:The Four Founding Professors]</ref>

He has been called the "Father of modern medicine."<ref name = "Tuteur">{{cite web|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/amytuteurmd/2008/11/19/listen_to_your_patient|last=Tuteur|first=Amy|title=Listen to your patient|publisher=The Skeptical OB|date=2008-11-19|accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref>  Osler was a multifaceted physician and individual, functioning as a [[pathologist]], [[internist]], educator, [[bibliophile]], historian, author, and renowned practical joker.

==Biography==

===Family===
William's great grandfather, Edward Osler, was variously described as either a [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] or a [[pirate]], and one of William's uncles (Edward Osler 1798–1863), a medical officer in the Navy, wrote the ''Life of Lord Exmouth'' and the poem ''The Voyage.'' William Osler's father, Featherstone Lake Osler (1805–1895), the son of a shipowner at [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], was a former Lieutenant in the Royal Navy and served on {{HMS|Victory}}. In 1831 Featherstone Osler  was invited to serve on {{HMS|Beagle}} as the science officer on [[Charles Darwin]]'s historic voyage to the [[Galápagos Islands]], but he turned it down as his father was dying. As a teenager Featherstone Osler was aboard {{HMS|Sappho|1806|6}} when it was nearly destroyed by Atlantic storms and left adrift for weeks. Serving in the Navy he was ship-wrecked off [[Barbados]]. In 1837 Featherstone Osler retired from the Navy and emigrated to Canada, becoming a 'saddle-bag minister' in rural [[Upper Canada]]. When Featherstone Osler and his bride (Ellen Free Picton) arrived in Canada they were nearly ship-wrecked again on Egg Island in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. The Oslers had several children and William was the brother of [[Britton Bath Osler]] and [[Edmund Boyd Osler (Ontario politician)|Sir Edmund Boyd Osler]].

===Early life===
William Osler was born in [[Bradford-West Gwillimbury, Ontario|Bond Head]], [[Canada West]] (now [[Ontario]]) on July 12, 1849, and raised after 1857 in [[Dundas, Ontario]]. (He was called William  after [[William III of England|William of Orange]], who won the [[Battle of the Boyne]]  on July 12, 1690.)

Educated at the original [[Trinity College School]] in Weston Ontario, as a teenager William Osler's aim was to follow his father into the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]] ministry and to that end he entered [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College, Toronto]] (now a constituent college of the [[University of Toronto]]) in the autumn of 1867. However, his chief interest proved to be medicine and, forsaking his original intention, he enrolled in the Toronto School of Medicine. This was a proprietary, or privately owned institution, not to be confused with the Medical Faculty of the [[University of Toronto]], which was then not active as a teaching body. Osler left the Toronto School of Medicine after being accepted to the [[MDCM]] program at [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine]] in [[Montreal]]. He received his medical degree (MDCM) in 1872.

===Career===
Following post-graduate training in Europe, Osler returned to [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine]] as a professor in 1874.  It is here that he created the first formalized [[journal club]].  In 1884, he was appointed Chair of Clinical Medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] and in 1885, was one of the seven founding members of the [[Association of American Physicians]], a society dedicated to "the advancement of scientific and practical medicine." When he left Philadelphia in 1889, his farewell address Aequanimitas<ref>[http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/osler/aequessay.htm Medicalarchives.jhmi.edu]</ref> was on the equanimity necessary for physicians.
[[File:William osler 1909.jpg|left|thumb|Osler in 1909, at the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Oxford]], holding [[Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, 9th Baronet|Sir William Stirling Maxwell]]'s copy of [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]]'s ''Tabulae Anotomicae'']]
In 1889, he accepted the position as the first Physician-in-Chief of the new [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] USA. Shortly afterwards, in 1893, Osler was instrumental in the creation of the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] and became one of the school's first professors in medicine. Osler quickly increased his reputation as a clinician, humanitarian and teacher. He presided over a rapidly expanding domain. In the Hospital's first year of operation, when it had 220 beds, 788 patients were seen for a total of over 15,000&nbsp;days of treatment. Sixteen years later, when Osler left for Oxford, over 4,200 patients were seen for a total of nearly 110,000&nbsp;days of treatment.

In 1905, he was appointed to the [[Regius Chair of Medicine]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], which he held until his death. He was also a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. During his time at Oxford, he met many aspiring doctors, a notable example being [[Wilder Penfield]].

In 1911, he initiated the Postgraduate Medical Association, of which he was the first President.<ref>D. G. James. The portraiture of Sir William Osler. [http://pmj.bmj.com/content/68/797/159.extract pmj.bmj.com]</ref>

Osler was created a [[baronet]] in the Coronation Honours List of 1911 for his many contributions to the field of medicine.

==Assessment==
[[File:William Osler photograph.jpg|thumb|left|Photo-portrait of Osler in about 1880]]

Perhaps Osler's greatest contribution to medicine was to insist that students learn from seeing and talking to patients and the establishment of the [[Residency (medicine)|medical residency]]. This latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, doctors in training make up much of a hospital's medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the Administration Building of the Hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Doctors spent as long as seven or eight years as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost monastic life.

He liked to say, "He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all." His best-known saying was "Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis," which emphasises the importance of taking a good history.<ref name = "Tuteur" />

The contribution to medical education of which he was proudest was his idea of clinical clerkship – having third- and fourth-year students work with patients on the wards. He pioneered the practice of bedside teaching making rounds with a handful of students, demonstrating what one student referred to as his method of "incomparably thorough physical examination." Soon after arriving in Baltimore Osler insisted that his medical students attend at bedside early in their training: by their third year they were taking patient histories, performing physicals and doing lab tests examining secretions, blood and excreta.

[[File:Four doctors.jpg|frame|right|''The Four Doctors'' by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1905, depicts the four physicians who founded [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. The original hangs in the William H. Welch Medical Library of [[Johns Hopkins University]].<br/>From left to right: [[William H. Welch|William Henry Welch]], [[William Stewart Halsted]], Osler, [[Howard Atwood Kelly|Howard Kelly]]]]

He reduced the role of [[Didacticism|didactic]] lectures and once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, "He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching." He also said, "I desire no other epitaph … than the statement that I taught medical students in the wards, as I regard this as by far the most useful and important work I have been called upon to do."  Osler fundamentally changed medical teaching in the North America, and this influence, helped by a few such as the Dutch [[internal medicine|internist]] Dr. [[P.K. Pel]], spread to medical schools across the globe.

Osler was a prolific author and a great collector of books and other material relevant to the [[history of medicine]]. He willed his library to the Faculty of Medicine of [[McGill University]] where it now forms the nucleus of McGill University's [[Osler Library of the History of Medicine]], which opened in 1929. The printed and extensively annotated catalogue of this donation is entitled ''"Bibliotheca Osleriana: a catalogue of books illustrating the history of medicine and science, collected, arranged and annotated by Sir William Osler, Bt. and bequeathed to McGill University".''<ref>[http://mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=1902 Bibliotheca Osleriana]</ref> Osler was a strong supporter of libraries and served on the library committees at most of the universities at which he taught and was a member of the Board of Curators of the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford. He was instrumental in founding the [[Medical Library Association]] in North America and served as its second President from 1901–1904. In Britain he was the first (and only) President of the Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland<ref name="Crawford04">{{cite journal |author=Crawford DS |title=The Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland |journal=Health Info Libr J |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=266–8 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15606885 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-1842.2004.00533.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1471-1842.2004.00533.x}}</ref> and also a President of the [[Bibliographical Society]] of London (1913).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/presidents.htm |title=The Bibliographical Society – Past Presidents |publisher=Bibsoc.org.uk |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref>

Osler was a prolific author and public speaker and his public speaking and writing were both done in a clear, lucid style. His most famous work, [[The Principles and Practice of Medicine|''''The Principles and Practice of Medicine'''']] quickly became a key text to students and clinicians alike. It continued to be published in many editions until 2001 and was translated into many languages. (See Osler Library Studies in the History of Medicine vol. 8.)<ref>''A History of William Osler’s The Principles and Practice of Medicine'' by Richard Golden. ISBN 0-7717-0615-4.  Available from the Osler Library.</ref> It is notable in part for supporting the use of [[Bloodletting]] as recently as 1923.<ref>[http://www.library.ucla.edu/specialcollections/biomedicallibrary/12193.cfm Bloodletting – UCLA Biomedical Library History and Special Collections for the Sciences]</ref>  Though his own textbook was a major influence in medicine for many years, Osler described [[Avicenna]] as the 'author of the most famous medical textbook ever written.' He noted that Avicenna's ''[[Canon of Medicine]]'' remained 'a medical bible for a longer time than any other work.<ref>{{cite web|author=Journal of Perinatology |url=http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v28/n1/full/7211832a.html |title=Access : Avicenna (AD 980 to 1037) and the care of the newborn infant and breastfeeding : Journal of Perinatology |publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref>
Osler's essays were important guides to physicians. The title of his most famous essay, ''Aequanimitas'', espousing the importance of imperturbability, is the motto on the Osler family crest and is used on the Osler housestaff tie and scarf at Hopkins.

==Controversy==
Osler is well known in the field of gerontology for the speech he gave when leaving Hopkins to become the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford.  His speech "The Fixed Period", given on February 22, 1905, included some controversial words about old age.  Osler, who had a well-developed humorous side to his character, was in his mid-fifties when he gave the speech and in it he mentioned [[Anthony Trollope]]'s ''[[The Fixed Period]]'' (1882), which envisaged a College where men retired at 67 and after a contemplative period of a year were 'peacefully extinguished' by chloroform. He claimed that, "the effective, moving, vitalizing work of the world is done between the ages of twenty-five and forty" and it was downhill from then on.  Osler's speech was covered by the popular press which headlined their reports with "Osler recommends chloroform at sixty". The Fixed Period speech is  included in the book of his collected addresses, ''"Aequanimitas, with other Addresses to Medical Students etc."'')

==Personal life and family==
An inveterate prankster, he wrote several humorous pieces under the pseudonym "Egerton Yorrick Davis", even fooling the editors of the ''Philadelphia Medical News'' into publishing a report on the imaginary phenomenon of ''[[penis captivus]]'', on December 13, 1884.<ref>{{cite book|last= Davis|first= Egerton Yorrick|editor1-last= Golden|editor1-first= Richard L|title= The Works of Egerton Yorrick Davis, MD: Sir William Osler's Alter Ego|series= Osler Library studies in the history of medicine, no. 3| publisher = Osler Library, McGill University|year= 1999 |location = Montreal|isbn= 978-0-7717-0548-9|oclc= 48551127}} A collection of writings by the fictitious surgical character created by Osler, E.Y. Davis</ref> The letter (still cited in all seriousness in a number of textbooks) was apparently a response to a report on the phenomenon of  [[vaginismus]] reported three weeks previously in the ''Philadelphia Medical News'' by Osler’s colleague Theophilus Parvin.<ref name="eyd">"[http://lifeinthefastlane.com/2008/11/egerton-y-davis/ Egerton Y. Davis]", Chris Nickson, ''Life in the Fastlane'', November 16, 2008</ref>

Davis, a prolific writer of letters to medical societies, purported to be a retired US Army surgeon living in Caughnawaga, [[Quebec]] (now called [[Kahnawake]]), author of a controversial paper on the [[obstetrical]] habits of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes which was suppressed and unpublished. Osler would enhance Davis' myth by signing Davis' name to [[hotel register]]s and [[Academic conference|medical conference]] attendance lists; Davis was eventually reported drowned in the [[Lachine Rapids]] in 1884.<ref name="eyd"/>

Throughout his life, Osler was a great admirer of the 17th century physician and philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]].

He died at the age of 70, on December 29, 1919 in [[Oxford]], during the [[Spanish flu|Spanish influenza epidemic]]; his wife, Grace, lived another nine years but succumbed to a series of strokes. Sir William and Lady Osler's ashes now rest in a niche within the [[Osler Library]] at [[McGill University]]. They had two sons, one of whom died shortly after birth.  The other, Edward Revere Osler, was mortally wounded in combat in [[World War I]] at the age of 21, during the 3rd battle of [[Ypres]] (also known as the [[battle of Passchendaele]]). At the time of his death in August 1917, he was a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the (British) Royal Field [[Artillery]]; Lt. Osler's grave is in the Dozinghem Military Cemetery in West [[Flanders]], Belgium.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Starling|first= P H|title= The case of Edward Revere Osler|year= 2003|month= March|journal= Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps|volume= 149|issue= 1|pages= 27–29|url= http://www.ramcjournal.com/2003/mar03/starling.pdf|format= PDF|pmid= 12743923}}</ref> According to one biographer, Dr. Osler was emotionally crushed by the loss; he was particularly anguished by the fact that his influence had been used to procure a military commission for his son, who had mediocre eyesight.<ref name="Bliss">Bliss, Michael (1999)</ref> Lady Osler (Grace Revere) was born in Boston in 1854; her paternal great-grandfather was [[Paul Revere]]. In 1876, she married Samuel W. Gross, chairman of surgery at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. Dr. Gross died in 1889 and in 1892 she married William Osler who was then professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.

Osler was a founder donor of the [[American Anthropometric Society]], a group of academics who pledged to donate their brains for scientific study. Osler's brain was taken to the [[Wistar Institute]] in Philadelphia to join the Wistar Brain Collection. In April 1987 it was taken to the [[Mütter Museum]], on 22nd Street near Chestnut in [[Philadelphia]] where it was displayed during the annual meeting of the American Osler Society.<ref>[http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-03/news/25777383_1_brains-annual-meeting-brothers "They Put Their Brains To Work William Osler, Joseph Leidy, Edward Drinker Cope And William Pepper Were Among The Greatest Brains In Turn -of-the-century Philadelphia.

In 1925, a monumental biography of William Osler was written by [[Harvey Cushing]].<ref>Cushing, Harvey (1925)</ref> For this work, Cushing received the 1926 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for biography. A later and somewhat more balanced biography by [[Michael Bliss]] was published in 1999.<ref name="Bliss" /> In 1994 Osler was inducted into the [[Canadian Medical Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Sir William Osler|url= http://www.cdnmedhall.org/sir-william-osler|publisher= [[Canadian Medical Hall of Fame]]|accessdate= 2010-03-24}}</ref>

==Eponyms==
Osler lent his [[eponym|name]] to a number of diseases, signs and symptoms, as well as to a number of buildings which have been named for him.

===Conditions===
* [[Osler's sign]] is an artificially high systolic [[blood pressure]] reading due to the calcification of [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[artery|arteries]].
* [[Osler's node]]s are raised tender nodules on the pulps of fingertips or toes, an autoimmune vasculitis that is suggestive of [[endocarditis|subacute bacterial endocarditis]]. They are usually painful, as opposed to [[Janeway lesions]] which are due to emboli and are painless.
* [[Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia|Rendu-Osler-Weber disease]] (also known as ''hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia'') is a syndrome of multiple [[blood vessel|vascular]] malformations on the skin, in the nasal and oral mucosa, in the lungs and elsewhere.
* Osler-Vaquez disease (also known as [[Polycythemia]] vera)
* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|Osler-Libman-Sacks syndrome]] is an atypical, verrucous, nonbacterial, valvular and mural [[endocarditis]]. Final stage of systemic [[lupus erythematosus]].
* Osler's [[filaria]] is a parasitic nematode.
* Osler's manoeuvre: in [[pseudohypertension]], the blood pressure as measured by the [[sphygmomanometer]] is artificially high because of arterial wall calcification. Osler's manoeuvre takes a patient who has a palpable, although pulseless, [[radial artery]] while the blood pressure cuff is inflated above [[systolic pressure]]; thus they are considered to have "Osler's sign."
*Osler's rule: States that a neurological defect has to be related to a specific lesion, in contrast to [[Hickam's dictum]], which states that the neurological defect can be due to several lesions.
* Osler's syndrome is a syndrome of recurrent episodes of colic pain, with typical radiation to back, cold shiverings and fever; due to the presence in [[Ampulla of Vater|Vater’s diverticulum]] of a free-moving [[gallstone]] which is larger than the orifice.
* Osler's triad: association of [[pneumonia]], [[endocarditis]], and [[meningitis]].
* Sphryanura osleri is a [[trematode]] worm found in the gills of a newt.
