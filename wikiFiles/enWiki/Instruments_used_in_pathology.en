|-
| Tissue section floating baths (in [[histopathology]]) || used to spread the cut thin slices onto water using [[surface tension]] from where it is placed onto glass slides
|-
| [[Ryle's tube]] or [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tube]] || used for nasogastric suction (or at times introduction of food or drugs). ''vide link''
|-
| [[Needle aspiration biopsy|FNAC]] needles || used for fine needle aspiration of material from inside the body; used for diagnostic examinations of the cells hence obtained; ''vide link''

|-
| [[Spirometer]] || used to test lung function; ''vide link''
|-
| •Water-seal type || -do-
|-
| •[[Douglas bag]] type || -do-
|-
| [[Peak flow meter]] or [[peak expiatory flow rate]] meter || used to test lung function by testing the rate at which the person can exhale; useful to diagnose [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] and [[asthma]]
|-
| [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] or other [[manometer]]s || used to measure pressure of a fluid within a cavity like the [[spinal canal]], which is raised in certain diseases
