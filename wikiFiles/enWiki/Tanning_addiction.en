'''Tanning addiction''' is a rare syndrome where an individual appears to have a physical or psychological addiction to [[sun tanning|sunbathing]] or the use of [[tanning bed]]s.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1001/archderm.141.8.963}}</ref> The mechanism of the addiction is unknown at this time.

==Medical evidence==
In 2005, a group of dermatologists published a study showing that frequent tanners experience a loss of control over their tanning schedule, displaying a pattern of addiction similar to smokers and alcoholics. <ref name="warthan2005">M. Warthan, T. Uchida, R. Wagner, Jr. UV Light Tanning as a Type of Substance-Related Disorder. Archives of Dermatology, August 2005; vol 141: pp 963-966.</ref>

Biochemical evidence indicates that tanning addicts are addicted to an opioid release experienced during tanning. When frequent tanners took an [[endorphin]] blocker in a 2006 study, they experienced severe withdrawal symptoms, while infrequent tanners experienced no withdrawal symptoms under the same conditions. <ref name="kaur2006">M. Kaur, A. Liguori, W. Lang, S. Rapp, A. Fleischer, Jr., S. Feldman. Induction of withdrawal-like symptoms in a small randomized, controlled trial of opioid blockade in frequent tanners.  Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 54(4): p. 709-711, 2006</ref>

==Tanorexia==
'''Tanorexia''' is the term often used to describe a condition in which a person participates in excessive outdoor [[sun tanning]] or excessive use of other skin tanning methods (such as [[tanning bed]]s) to achieve a darker [[skin]] complexion because they perceive themselves as unacceptably pale). <ref>{{cite news|title=Young 'tanorexics' risking cancer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/real_story/3737025.stm|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2004}}</ref> The syndrome is different from tanning addiction, although both may fit into the same syndrome and can be considered a subset of tanning addiction.

Although the term "tanorexia" has been commonly used by the media and several doctors to describe the syndrome, both the word and syndrome have not been widely accepted by the medical community, and is considered slang by many.  The term was coined after the medical condition [[anorexia nervosa]], a disorder characterized by low body weight and body image distortion with an obsessive fear of gaining weight. It can be likened to the common practice of adding the suffix "-aholic" (from the term [[alcoholic]]) to the end of any action or food someone enjoys extensively and often (e.g., "choc-aholic," "work-aholic" "golf-aholic," "shop-aholic," etc.).

Serious cases of tanorexia can be considered dangerous because many of the more popular methods of tanning (such as those mentioned above) require prolonged exposure to [[Ultraviolet|UV]] radiation, which is known to be a cause of many negative side effects, including [[skin cancer]].

Extreme instances may be an indication of [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD), <ref>{{cite journal |author=Hunter-Yates J, Dufresne RG, Phillips KA |title=Tanning in body dysmorphic disorder |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=56 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S107–9 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17434030 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.05.025 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190-9622(06)01497-6}}</ref> a mental disorder in which one is extremely critical of his or her physique or self-image to an obsessive and compulsive degree.  As it is with [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], a person with BDD is said to show signs of a characteristic called distorted body image. In layman's terms, anorexia sufferers commonly believe they are overweight, many times claiming they see themselves as "fat", when in reality, they are nutritionally underweight and physically much thinner than the average person.  In the same way, a sufferer of "tanorexia" may believe him or herself to have a much lighter – even a pale – complexion when he or she is actually quite dark-skinned.   

Neither tanning addiction nor tanorexia are covered under the latest edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.  However, a 2005 article in ''The Archives of Dermatology'' presents a case for UV light tanning addiction to be viewed as a type of substance abuse disorder. <ref name="warthan2005">M. Warthan, T. Uchida, R. Wagner, Jr. UV Light Tanning as a Type of Substance-Related Disorder. Archives of Dermatology, August 2005; vol 141: pp 963-966.</ref>

In 2012, New Jersey mother Patricia Krentcil received national media attention amid accusations that she had brought her then 5 year old daughter, Anna, with her to a tanning salon in order for Anna to tan. The child's school nurse had expressed concern over her sunburn, at which point the daughter claimed she had gone 'tanning with mommy'. This prompted the school to call [[Child Protective Services]], as New Jersey law bans children under 14 from tanning booths.<ref name="Tanning Mom">{{cite news|title=Grand jury says no indictment for mom in tan salon visit by daughter, 5|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/26/justice/new-jersey-tanning-case|accessdate=2013-03-01|date=2013-02-27}}</ref> Initial media coverage of the event resulted in widespread attention given to Patricia's unusually bronzed image, leading many to speculate that she was tanorexic.

==Symptoms ==
Although the syndrome has not been officially described by the medical community, it may include the following reported symptoms: intense anxiety if a session of tanning is missed, competition among peers to see which can get the darkest tan, and chronic frustration about the color of one's skin, with the affected person being convinced his or her complexion is constantly lighter than it actually is.{{CN|date=March 2013}}
