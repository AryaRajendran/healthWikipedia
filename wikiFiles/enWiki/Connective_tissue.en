'''Connective tissue (CT)''' is a kind of [[tissue (biology)|biological tissue]] that supports, connects, or separates different types of tissues and organs of the body. It is one of the four general classes of biological tissues—the others of which are [[epithelium|epithelial]], [[muscle tissue|muscular]], and [[nervous tissue|nervous]] tissues.

All CT has three main components: cells, fibers, and extracellular matrices, all immersed in the body fluids.

Connective tissue can be broadly subdivided into [[connective tissue proper]], special connective tissue, and series of other, less classifiable types of connective tissues.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shostak|first=Stanley|title=Connective Tissues|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~sshostak/biosci1450/hislec03.html|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref> [[Connective tissue proper]] consists of [[loose connective tissue]] and [[dense connective tissue]] (which is further subdivided into [[dense regular connective tissue|dense regular]] and [[dense irregular connective tissue|dense irregular]] connective tissues.)<ref>{{cite web|last=Potter|first=Hugh|title=The Connective Tissues|url=http://faculty.ucc.edu/biology-potter/connective_tissues.htm|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref> Special connective tissue consists of [[reticular connective tissue]], [[adipose tissue]], [[cartilage]], [[bone]], and [[blood]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Caceci|first=Thomas|title=Connective Tisues|url=http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/education/curriculum/vm8054/labs/lab5/lab5.htm|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref> Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and [[lymphatic system#lymphoid tissue|lymphoid]] connective tissues.<ref>{{cite news|last=King|first=David|title=Histology Intro|url=http://www.siumed.edu/~dking2/intro/ct.htm#ordinspecial|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>

[[Fibroblasts]] are the cells responsible for the production of some CT.

[[Type-I collagen]], is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/277/6/4223|year=2002|author=Di Lullo, G.

==Functions of connective tissue==
*Storage of energy 
*Protection of organs
*Provision of structural framework for the body
*Connection of body tissues
*Connection of epithelial tissues to muscle tissues

==Characteristics of connective tissue and fiber types==
Characteristics of CT:
*Cells are spread through an extracellular fluid. 
*Ground substance - A clear, colorless, and viscous fluid containing glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans to fix the bodywater and the collagen fibers in the intercellular spaces. Ground substance slows the spread of pathogens.
*[[Fiber]]s. Not all types of CT are fibrous. Examples include adipose tissue and blood. Adipose tissue gives "mechanical cushioning" to our body, among other functions.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172309700015|year=2008|author=Xu, H. et al.|title=Monitoring Tissue Engineering Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging|journal=Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering|volume=106|pmid=19134545|doi=10.1263/jbb.106.515|pages=515–527|issue=6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475306002316|year=2007|author=Laclaustra, M. et al.|title=Metabolic syndrome pathophysiology: The role of adiposetissue|journal=Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases|volume=17|pmid=17270403|doi=10.1016/j.numecd.2006.10.005|pages=125–139|issue=2}}</ref> Although there is no dense collagen network in adipose tissue, groups of adipose cells are kept together by collagen fibers and collagen sheets in order to keep fat tissue under compression in place (for example, the sole of the foot). The matrix of blood is plasma. 
*Both the ground substance and proteins (fibers) create the matrix for CT.

==Disorders of connective tissue==
{{Main|Connective tissue disease}}
Various CT in CT.
* [[Sarcoma]] - a [[neoplastic]] process originating within CT.
* [[Hemangiopericytoma]] - a [[neoplastic]] process

==Staining of connective tissue==
For microscopic viewing, the majority of the CT staining techniques color tissue fibers in contrasting shades. Collagen may be differentially stained by any of the following techniques:
*[[Van Gieson's]] stain
*[[Masson's trichrome|Masson's Trichrome]] stain
*[[Mallory's Aniline Blue]] stain
*[[Azocarmine]] stain
*[[Krajian's Aniline Blue]] stain
*[[Eosin]]
