'''Neonatal withdrawal''' or '''neonatal abstinence syndrome''' (NAS) is a withdrawal syndrome of [[infant]]s, caused by the cessation of the administration of licit or illicit drugs. [[drug tolerance|Tolerance]], [[drug dependence|dependence]]. Withdrawal may occur as a result of repeated administration of drugs or even after short-term high dose use -- for example during [[mechanical ventilation]] in [[intensive care units]]. There are two types of NAS: prenatal and postnatal. Prenatal NAS is caused by discontinuation of drugs taken by the pregnant mother, while postnatal NAS is caused by discontinuation of drugs directly to the infant.<ref name=emedicine>[http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2760.htm emedicine.com - Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome] Author: Jaques Belik, MD</ref><ref name="Hall-2007">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hall | first1 = RW. | last2 = Boyle | first2 = E. | last3 = Young | first3 = T. | title = Do ventilated neonates require pain management? | journal = Semin Perinatol | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 289–97 | month = Oct | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1053/j.semperi.2007.07.002 | PMID = 17905183 }}</ref>

The drugs involved may be for example [[opioids]], [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] and [[benzodiazepines]].<ref name=emedicine/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Iqbal MM, Sobhan T, Ryals T |title=Effects of commonly used benzodiazepines on the fetus, the neonate, and the nursing infant |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=39–49 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11773648 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ps.53.1.39|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/53/1/39}}</ref> Neonatal abstinence syndrome does not happen in [[prenatal cocaine exposure]] (with babies exposed to [[cocaine]] in utero) in the sense that such symptoms are difficult to separate in the context of other factors such as [[Preterm birth|prematurity]] or prenatal exposure to other drugs.<ref name="Mercer09">{{cite book |author=Mercer, J |chapter=Claim 9: "Crack babies" can't be cured and will always have serious problems |title=Child Development: Myths and Misunderstandings |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2009 |pages=62–64 |isbn=1-4129-5646-3 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>

When pharmacological treatment of opiate withdrawal in neonates is deemed necessary, opiates are the treatment of choice, which are slowly tapered down to wean the neonate off opiates.<ref>http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/2/e540.short</ref> [[Phenobarbitol]] is sometimes used as an alternative but is less effective in suppressing [[seizures]]; however, phenobarbitol is superior to [[diazepam]] for neonatal opiate withdrawal symptoms. In the case of [[sedative|sedative-hypnotic]] neonatal withdrawal, phenobarbitol is the treatment of choice.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Osborn | first1 = DA. | last2 = Jeffery | first2 = HE. | last3 = Cole | first3 = M. | title = Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants. | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20927730 | | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 3 | pages = CD002059 | month =  | year = 2010 | doi =10.1002/14651858.CD002059.pub3 | PMID = 20927730 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Osborn | first1 = DA. | last2 = Jeffery | first2 = HE. | last3 = Cole | first3 = MJ. | title = Sedatives for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants. | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20927729 | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 3 | pages = CD002053| month =  | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002053.pub3 | PMID = 20927729 }}</ref>

A 2012 study from the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]] published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' analyzed information on 7.4 million discharges from 4,121 hospitals in 44 states, to measure trends and costs associated with NAS over the past decade. The study indicated that between 2000 and 2009, the number of mothers using opiates increased from 1.19 to 5.63 per 1,000 hospital births per year. Newborns with NAS were 19% more likely than all other hospital births to have low birthweight and 30% more like to have respiratory complications. Between 2000 and 2009, total hospital charges for NAS cases, adjusted for inflation, are estimated to have increased from $190 million to $720 million.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/opiate-us-mothers-increases-neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/ | title=Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and Associated Health Care Expenditures: United States, 2000-2009}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved May 15, 2012</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Patrick | first1 = Stephen W. | last2 = Schumacher | first2 = Robert E. | last3 = Benneyworth | first3 =Brian D. | year = 2012 | title = Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and Associated Health Care Expenditures: United States, 2000-2009 | journal = [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] | url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/early/2012/04/25/jama.2012.3951.full }}</ref>
