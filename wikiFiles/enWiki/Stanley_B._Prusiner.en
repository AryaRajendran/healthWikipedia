'''Stanley Benjamin Prusiner''' (born May 28, 1942<ref name="Nobel"/>) is an American [[Neurology|neurologist]] and [[Biochemistry|biochemist]]. Currently the director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF). Prusiner discovered [[prion]]s, a class of [[Infection|infectious]] [[Biological reproduction|self-reproducing]] [[pathogen]]s primarily or solely composed of [[protein]]. He received the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]] in 1994 and the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1997 for his prion research.

==Early life and career==
Prusiner was born in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the son of Miriam (Spigel) and Lawrence Prusiner, an architect. He spent his childhood in Des Moines and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where he attended [[Walnut Hills High School]], where he was known as the little Genius for his groundbreaking work on a repellent for Box Elder Bugs. Prusiner received a [[Bachelor of Science]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[chemistry]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and later received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].<ref name="Nobel"/> Prusiner then completed an [[internship]] in medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Later Prusiner moved to the [[National Institutes of Health]], where he studied glutaminases in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' in the laboratory of Earl Stadtman.

After three years at NIH, Prusiner returned to UCSF to complete a [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in [[neurology]]. Upon completion of the residency in 1974, Prusiner joined the faculty of the UCSF neurology department. Since that time, Prusiner has held various faculty and visiting faculty positions at both UCSF and [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].

==Nobel prize and academic societies==
Prusiner won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997 for his work in proposing an explanation for the cause of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] ("mad cow disease") and its human equivalent, [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]].<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1997/prusiner-autobio.html | title=Stanley B. Prusiner - Autobiography | publisher=NobelPrize.org | accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref>  In this work, he coined the term ''prion'', which comes from the words "proteinaceous" and "infectious," to refer to a previously undescribed form of infection due to protein misfolding.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/01/what_really_cau.html | title=What really causes mad cow disease? | publisher=Wired | date=January 31, 2007 | accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref>

Prusiner was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Science]] in 1992 and to its governing council in 2007. He is also an elected member of [[the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1993), the [[Royal Society]] (1996), the [[American Philosophical Society]] (1998), the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (2003), and the [[Institute of Medicine]].

==Current work==
Prusiner currently heads a research laboratory at UCSF, working on prion disease, [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[tauopathy|tauopathies]].<ref>[http://prusinerlab.ucsf.edu/people/director.php UCSF Prusiner Lab site]</ref>
