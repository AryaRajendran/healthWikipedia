'''Giant-cell arteritis''' ('''GCA''' or '''temporal arteritis''' or '''cranial arteritis''') or '''Horton disease''' is an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] disease of [[blood vessel]]s most commonly involving large and medium [[artery|arteries]] of the head, predominantly the branches of the [[external carotid artery]]. It is a form of [[vasculitis]].

The name ([[giant cell]] arteritis) reflects the type of inflammatory cell involved<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000008441|giant cell arteritis}}</ref> as seen on a [[biopsy]].

The terms "giant-cell arteritis" and "temporal arteritis" are sometimes used interchangeably, because of the frequent involvement of the [[temporal artery]]. However, it can involve other large vessels (such as the [[aorta]] in "giant-cell aortitis"<ref name="pmid15728420">{{cite journal |author=Walter MA, Melzer RA, Graf M, Tyndall A, Müller-Brand J, Nitzsche EU |title=[18F]FDG-PET of giant-cell aortitis |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=690–1 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15728420 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keh551 |url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15728420}}</ref>).  Giant-cell arteritis of the temporal artery is referred to as "temporal arteritis," and is also known as "cranial arteritis" and "Horton's disease."<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|840}}

==Signs and symptoms==
It is more common in women than in men by a ratio of 2:1 and more common in those of Northern European descent, as well as those residing at higher latitudes.  The mean age of onset is >55 years, and it is rare in those less than 55 years of age.

People present with:

* reduced [[visual acuity]] (blurred vision)
* acute [[visual loss]] (sudden blindness)
* [[diplopia]] (double vision)
* acute [[tinnitus]] (ringing in the ears)
* [[polymyalgia rheumatica]] (in 50%)

The inflammation may affect blood supply to the [[Human eye|eye]] and blurred vision or sudden [[blindness]] may occur. In 76% of cases involving the eye, the [[ophthalmic artery]] is involved causing [[arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Hayreh |title=Ocular Manifestations of GCA |url=http://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/dept/GCA/04-ocular.htm |date=April 3, 2003 |publisher =University of Iowa Health Care |accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref> Loss of vision in both eyes may occur very abruptly and this disease is therefore a [[medical emergency]].

===Associated conditions===
The disorder may coexist (in a half of cases) with [[polymyalgia rheumatica]] (PMR), which is characterized by sudden onset of pain and stiffness in muscles ([[pelvis]], [[shoulder]]) of the body and is seen in the elderly. GCA and PMR are so closely linked that they are often considered to be different manifestations of the same disease process. Other diseases related with temporal arteritis are systemic [[lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and severe [[infection]]s.

Giant-cell arteritis can involve branches of the aorta as well leading to aortic aneurysm. For this reason patients should be followed with serial chest X-rays

==Diagnosis==
===Physical exam===
* Palpation of the head reveals prominent [[Superficial temporal artery|temporal arteries]] with or without pulsation.
* The [[Temporal bone|temporal area]] may be tender.
* Decreased pulses may be found throughout the body

* Evidence of [[ischemia]] may be noted on fundal exam.

===Laboratory tests===
* LFTs, [[liver function tests]], are abnormal particularly raised ALP- alkaline phosphatase
* [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], an inflammatory marker, >60&nbsp;mm/hour (normal 1–40&nbsp;mm/hour).
* [[C-reactive protein]], another inflammatory marker, is also commonly elevated.
* [[Platelets]] may also be elevated.

===Biopsy===
[[File:Cerebral Giant-Cell Vasculitis.jpg|thumb|Histopathology of giant cell vasculitis in a cerebral artery. Elastica-stain.]]
The [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for diagnosing temporal arteritis is [[biopsy]], which involves removing a small part of the vessel and examining it [[microscope|microscopically]] for [[giant cell]]s infiltrating the tissue. Since the [[blood vessel]]s are involved in a patchy pattern, there may be unaffected areas on the vessel and the biopsy might have been taken from these parts. Unilateral biopsy of a 1.5–3&nbsp;cm length is 85-90% sensitive (1&nbsp;cm is the minimum).<ref>{{cite journal

===Imaging studies===
Radiological examination of the temporal artery with [[ultrasound]] yields a [[halo sign]].
Contrast enhanced brain MRI and CT is generally negative in this disorder.
Recent studies have shown that 3T MRI using super high resolution imaging and contrast injection can non-invasively diagnose this disorder with high specificity and sensitivity.<ref name="pmid17885247">{{cite journal |author=Bley TA, Uhl M, Carew J, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnostic value of high-resolution MR imaging in giant cell arteritis |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1722–7 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17885247 |doi=10.3174/ajnr.A0638 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17885247}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Corticosteroid]]s, typically high-dose [[prednisone]] (1&nbsp;mg/kg/day), must be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected (even before the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy) to prevent irreversible blindness secondary to [[ophthalmic artery]] occlusion. Steroids do not prevent the diagnosis from later being confirmed by biopsy, although certain changes in the histology may be observed towards the end of the first week of treatment and are more difficult to identify after a couple of months.<ref name="pmid16987903">{{cite journal |author=Font RL, Prabhakaran VC |title=Histological parameters helpful in recognising steroid-treated temporal arteritis: an analysis of 35 cases |journal=The British journal of ophthalmology |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=204–9 |year=2007 |pmid=16987903 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2006.101725 |pmc=1857614}}</ref> The dose of [[prednisone]] is lowered after 2–4 weeks, and slowly tapered over 9–12 months. Tapering may require two or more years.  Oral steroids are at least as effective as intravenous steroids,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=708 |title=BestBets: Steroids and Temporal Arteritis |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> except in the treatment of acute visual loss where intravenous steroids appear to offer significant benefit over oral steroids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chan CC, Paine M, O'Day J |title=Steroid management in giant cell arteritis |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=85 |issue=9 |pages=1061–4 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11520757 |pmc=1724128 |url=http://bjo.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11520757 |doi=10.1136/bjo.85.9.1061}}</ref>
