{{Disability}}
'''Scope''' is a UK [[disability]] [[charitable organization|charity]] working with disabled people and their families in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. It runs support services such as schools, a college, residential care, training, short breaks and runs a helpline providing information and advice on disability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.org.uk/services |title=Services |publisher=Scope |accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref> Scope also campaigns for the full inclusion and equal participation of disabled people in society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.org.uk/campaigns |title=Campaigns |publisher=Scope |accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref>

==History==
It was founded as the '''National Spastics Society''' on 9 October 1951<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davies  |first1=Chris |title=Changing Society: A Personal History of Scope (Formerly The Spastics Society) 1952-2002 |publisher=Scope |date=April, 2001 |pages=19 |chapter=Beginnings |isbn=0946828962 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> by Ian Dawson-Shepherd, Eric Hodgson, Alex Moira and a social worker, Jean Garwood, with the aim of improving and expanding services for people with cerebral palsy. 

From 1955 to 1989, the society ran the [[Thomas Delarue School]], a specialist secondary boarding school at [[Tonbridge]], [[Kent]].<ref name=TDS>{{cite web|url=http://www.tds.org.uk/school.htm |title=TDS - The School |publisher=TDS |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> Scope still runs schools for disabled children in Hertfordshire,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/110920 |title=Meldreth Manor |publisher=Ofsted |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref> West Sussex<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/CARE/SC014584 |title=Ingfield Manor |publisher=Ofsted |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref> and near Cardiff<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estyn.gov.uk/english/provider/6816087/ |title=Craig y Parc |publisher=Ofsted |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref> as well as a Further Education College in Lancaster, which was founded in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beaumontcollege.ac.uk/ |title=Beaumont College |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>

Over time, thanks in large part to the influence of [[Bill Hargreaves]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hargreaves  |first1=Bill |title=Can You Manage Stares? |publisher=Scope |year=2002 |isbn=0946828954 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> the first trustee with cerebral palsy, the charity’s aims extended to improving and expanding services for people with cerebral palsy and disabled people in general. Bill’s pioneering work in employment in the 1950s supported over 1,500 disabled people into their first jobs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hargreaves  |first1=Bill |title=Can You Manage Stares? |publisher=Scope |year=2002 |pages=70 |chapter=Chapter 7: Man of industry, 1957-62 |isbn=0946828954 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> In 1962, he set up the 62 Clubs where disabled people could choose and control their own leisure activities. Through its employment services and inclusion teams, Scope continues to support disabled people to have the same opportunities as everyone else.

In 1963 it merged with the [[British Council for the Welfare of Spastics]] to become '''The Spastics Society'''. The Spastics Society provided [[sheltered workshop]]s and [[day centre]]s for people with cerebral palsy (commonly referred to as ''spastics'' at the time, despite [[spasticity]] being a symptom of only one variant of cerebral palsy), who were seen as being unemployable in mainstream society. The Society also provided residential units and schools, as well as opening a chain of charity shops. The term ''spastic'' came to be viewed as a general insult (perversely, in part due to the ''[[Blue Peter]]'' programmes following the life story of [[Joey Deacon]], during the [[International Year of Disabled Persons]], in an attempt to show disability in a positive light) and the society changed to its current name on 26 March 1994,<ref>{{cite news  |first = Jeremy  |last = Laurance  |title = SPASTICS SOCIETY PUTS ITS FUTURE IN SCOPE  |work = The Times |publisher = Times Newspapers Ltd  |date = 4 November 1994}}</ref> following a two-year consultation with disabled people and their families.<ref>{{cite news |title = CHARITY CHANGE - SPASTICS SOCIETY CHANGES NAME TO SCOPE  |work = The Sunday Times |publisher = Times Newspapers Ltd  |date = 27 March 1994 |accessdate = 2006-10-19}}</ref> 
 
In November 1996, Scope AGM voted in favour of an individual membership scheme to give a voice to the 20,000 people that Scope and its local groups are in contact with every year - the first major UK disability charity to do so. In 1998, Scope individual members voted in elections to Executive Council and, since this time, the majority of trustees have been disabled people. However the first person with cerebral palsy to play a major managerial role was [[Bill Hargreaves]], who had been elected to the Executive Council back in 1957.

In January 2012, Scope replaced its logo with a combination of more than 60 “visions of the future” created by disabled people, their friends and families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/scope-unveils-user-generated-brand-identity/3033648.article  |title=Scope unveils user-generated brand identity |publisher=Marketing Week |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref> Scope wants to make disability better understood by the public, at a time when attitudes towards disabled people are getting worse<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comres.co.uk/poll/526/scope-tracker-survey-of-disabled-people.htm |title=Poll Digest - Social - Scope Tracker Survey of Disabled People |publisher=ComRes |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref> and disabled people are struggling to get the support they need due to budget cuts.

With over 3,500 staff (more than 20% of whom are people with a disability) and an annual turnover of around £100 million, Scope continues to create independent living, education and employment opportunities for people with cerebral palsy and related impairments and to campaign for equality for all disabled people.

==Campaigns==

In 2004 Scope launched the ''Time to Get Equal'' campaign to banish [[disablism]], which it defines as "discriminatory, oppressive or abusive behaviour arising from the belief that disabled people are inferior to others".<ref>[http://www.scope.org.uk/timetogetequal Time to Get Equal]</ref>

The campaign had three aims:

*To raise awareness of the problems and barriers faced by disabled people in their everyday lives
*To demand an improvement in the attitudes and actions that disabled people experience
*To build a mass movement of disabled and non-disabled people campaigning and working for equality.

==Patrons and celebrity supporters==

High-profile supporters for the ''Time to Get Equal'' campaign included [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Bill Clinton]] and former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. Scope’s patrons are [[Ade Adepitan]], [[Cherie Booth]], David Hall and [[Alastair Stewart]]. Celebrity supporters include [[Brian Blessed]], [[Karren Brady]], [[Jeff Brazier]], [[Cerrie Burnell]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Ben Elton]], [[Tanni Grey-Thompson]], [[Nicolas Hamilton]], [[Nick Hewer]], [[Lorraine Heggessey]], [[Richard Herring]], [[John Inverdale]], [[Gabby Logan]], [[Francesca Martinez]] and [[Tony Parsons (British journalist)|Tony Parsons]].
