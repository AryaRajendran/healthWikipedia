A '''paraprotein''' is an [[immunoglobulin]] or immunoglobulin light-chain that is produced in excess by the clonal proliferation of [[plasma cell]]s. Detection of paraproteins in the [[urine]] or [[blood]] is most often associated with benign [[Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance|MGUS]] (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), where they remain "silent",<ref>{{cite journal | author = Maniatis A | title = Pathophysiology of paraprotein production. | journal = Ren Fail | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 821–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9834980 | doi = 10.3109/08860229809045179}}</ref> and [[multiple myeloma]]. An excess in the blood is known as [[paraproteinemia]]. Paraproteins form a narrow band, or 'spike' in [[protein electrophoresis]] as they are all exactly the same protein.

Paraproteins are also referred to as "'''M proteins'''," where the "M" stands for "monoclonal."

Monoclonal free light chains in the serum or urine are called [[Bence Jones protein]]s.

==History==
The concept and term were introduced by the [[Berlin]] pathologist Dr Kurt Apitz in 1940,<ref>Apitz K. ''Die Paraproteinosen. Über die Störungen des Eiweißstoffwechsels bei Plasmozytomen.'' Virchows Arch Pathol Anat 1940;306:630-699. <!--not indexed, obviously--></ref> at that time the ''Oberarzt'' of the pathological institute at the [[Charité]] hospital.<ref>McDevitt HO. ''Albert Hewett Coons''. In: "Biographical Memoirs", National Academy of Sciences 1996;69:26-37. ISBN 0-309-05346-3. [http://books.nap.edu/books/0309053463/html/26.html Fulltext].</ref>

Paraproteins allowed the detailed study of immunoglobulins, which eventually led to the production of [[monoclonal antibodies]] in 1975.

==Interpretation upon detection==
[[Blood serum]] paraprotein levels of more than 30 g/L is diagnostic of [[multiple myeloma]], according to the diagnostic criteria of the [[International Myeloma Working Group]],<ref name="IMWG2003">{{cite journal |author=International Myeloma Working Group |title=Criteria for the classification of monoclonal gammopathies, multiple myeloma and related disorders: a report of the International Myeloma Working Group |journal=Br.
