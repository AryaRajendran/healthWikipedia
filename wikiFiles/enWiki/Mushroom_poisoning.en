'''Mushroom poisoning''' (also known as '''mycetism''') refers to harmful effects from ingestion of [[toxic]] substances present in a [[mushroom]]. These symptoms can vary from slight [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] discomfort to [[death]]. The [[toxin]]s present are [[secondary metabolites]] produced in specific [[biochemical pathways]] in the [[Fungus|fungal]] cells. Mushroom [[poisoning]] is usually the result of [[ingestion]] of wild mushrooms after misidentification of a toxic mushroom as an edible species. The most common reason for this misidentification is close resemblance in terms of colour and general [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the toxic mushrooms species with edible species. Even very experienced wild mushroom gatherers are upon rare occasion poisoned by eating toxic species, despite being well aware of the risks, through carelessness.

To prevent mushroom poisoning, mushroom gatherers need to be very familiar with the mushrooms they intend to collect as well as with any similar-looking toxic species. In addition, edibility of mushrooms may depend on methods of preparation for cooking. Collectors also need to be well aware that edibility or toxicity of some species varies with geographic location.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Folk traditions==
There are many folk traditions concerning the defining features of poisonous mushrooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calpoison.org/public/mushrooms.html|title=California Poison Action Line: Mushrooms|accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms of the World|author=Ian Robert Hall|year=2003|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=0-88192-586-1|page=103}}</ref>
Unfortunately there are no general identifiers for poisonous mushrooms (only guidelines to identify mushrooms themselves exist, if one knows what mushroom is toxic), and so such traditions are unreliable guides. Use of folk traditions to try to identify edible mushrooms is a frequent cause of mushroom poisoning.
<br/>Examples of erroneous folklore "rules" include:
*"Poisonous mushrooms are brightly colored." – While the [[fly agaric]],  usually bright red to orange and/or yellow, is narcotic and hallucinogenic, there have been no reported human deaths; the deadly [[destroying angel]], in contrast, is an unremarkable white, and the deadly ''[[Galerina]]s'' are brown. Some choice edible species ([[chanterelles]], ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'', ''[[Laetiporus sulphureus]]'', etc.) are brightly colored, while most poisonous species are brown or white.
*"Insects/animals will avoid toxic mushrooms." – Fungi that are harmless to invertebrates can still be toxic to humans; the [[death cap]], for instance, is often infested by insect [[larva]]e. 
*"Poisonous mushrooms blacken [[silver]]." – None of the known mushroom toxins have a reaction with silver.
*"Poisonous mushrooms taste bad." – People who have eaten the deadly ''[[Amanitas]]'' reported that the mushrooms tasted quite good.
*"All mushrooms are safe if cooked/parboiled/dried/pickled/etc." – While it is true that some otherwise inedible species can be rendered safe by special preparation, many toxic species cannot be made toxin-free. Many [[mycotoxin|fungal toxins]] are not particularly [[thermostability|sensitive to heat]] and so are not broken down during cooking; particularly [[α-amanitin]], the poison produced by the death cap (''[[Amanita phalloides]]'') and others of the [[Amanita|genus]], is not denatured by heat.
*"Poisonous mushrooms will turn rice red when boiled".<ref name="CDC1981">{{cite journal | title = Mushroom Poisoning among Laotian Refugees – 1981 | journal = MMWR | volume = 31 | issue = 21 | pages = 287–8 | publisher = CDC | location = USA | date = June 4, 1982 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001107.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-04 | pmid = 6808348 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control (CDC)}}</ref> – A number of Laotian refugees were hospitalized after eating mushrooms (probably toxic ''[[Russula]]'' species) deemed safe by this folklore rule and this misconception cost at least one person her life.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/8574915.stm | work=BBC News | title=Woman died of mushroom poisoning | date=2010-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7067321.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Laura | last=Pitel | title=Amphon Tuckey died after eating death cap mushrooms picked at botanic gardens | date=2010-03-19}}</ref>
*"Poisonous mushrooms have a pointed cap. Edible ones have a flat, rounded cap." – The shape of the mushroom cap does not correlate with presence or absence of mushroom toxins, so this is not a reliable method to distinguish between edible and poisonous species. [[Death cap]], for instance, has a rounded cap when mature.
*"[[Boletus|Boletes]] are generally safe to eat" – It is true that unlike a number of ''Amanita'' species in particular, in most parts of the world, there are no known deadly varieties of the Boletus genus, which reduces the risks associated with misidentification. However, mushrooms like the [[Boletus satanas|Devil's Bolete]] are poisonous both raw and cooked and can lead to strong gastrointestinal symptoms, and other species like the ''[[Boletus luridus|Lurid Bolete]]'' require thorough cooking to break down toxins. As with other mushroom ''genera'', proper caution is therefore advised in determining the correct species.

A majority of these cases are due to "mistaken identity." One way this can happen is that the victim attempts to apply folk knowledge from one geographic area to another.<ref name="CDC1981" /> This is a common occurrence with ''A. phalloides'' in particular, due to its resemblance to the Asian "paddy-straw" mushroom, ''[[Volvariella volvacea]]''. Both are light-colored and covered with a [[universal veil]] when young.

[[Amanitas]] can be mistaken for other species, as well, particularly when immature.

In this case the victim had some (obviously limited) experience in identifying mushrooms, but did not take the time to correctly identify these particular mushrooms until after he began to experience symptoms of mushroom poisoning.

Foragers are encouraged to always cut the fruiting bodies of suspected puffballs in half, as this will reveal the outline of a developing amanita should it be present within the structure.

A majority of mushroom poisonings in general are the result of small children, especially toddlers in the "grazing" stage, ingesting mushrooms found in the lawn. While this can happen with any mushroom, ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' is often implicated due to its preference for growing in lawns. ''C. molybdites'' causes severe gastrointestinal upset but is not considered deadly poisonous.

A few poisonings are the result of misidentification while attempting to collect hallucinogenic mushrooms for recreational use.<ref name="Halpern2005">{{cite journal | last = Halpern | first = John | authorlink = John Halpern | coauthors = R.

They contain [[muscarine]], which causes vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, perspiration, and tears. In high doses it can cause respiratory failure. The same toxin occurs in ''[[Clitocybe dealbata]]'', which is occasionally mistaken for an [[oyster mushroom]] or other edible species.

Toxicities can also occur with collection of [[morels]]. Even true [[morels]], if eaten raw, will cause gastrointestinal upset. Therefore morels should always be thoroughly cooked before eating. ''[[Verpa bohemica]]'', although referred to as "thimble morels" or "early morels" by some, have caused toxic effects in some individuals.<ref name="FDAimport">

''[[Paxillus involutus]]'' is also indigestible when raw, but is eaten in Europe after pickling or parboiling.

All the victims died of an acute brain disorder, and all had pre-existing kidney disease. The exact cause of the toxicity was not known at this time and the deaths cannot be definitively attributed to mushroom consumption.

However, mushroom poisoning is not always due to mistaken identity. For example, the highly toxic ergot (''[[Claviceps purpurea]]''), which grows on rye, is sometimes ground up with rye, unnoticed, and later consumed. This can cause devastating, even fatal effects, which is called [[Ergotism]].

Cases of [[idiosyncratic]] or "unusual" reactions to fungi can also occur. Some are probably due to allergy, others to some other kind of sensitivity. It is not uncommon for an individual person to experience gastrointestinal upset associated with one particular mushroom species or genus.<ref name="Beug2004" /> Eating small portions when trying a new mushroom may be used as a precaution to identify individual problems with the new species.

==Toxins and their symptoms==
{{see also|Category:Mycotoxins}}

Poisonous mushrooms contain a variety of different toxins that can differ markedly in toxicity. Symptoms of mushroom poisoning may vary from gastric upset to life-threatening organ failure resulting in death. Serious symptoms do not always occur immediately after eating; often not until the toxin attacks the kidney or liver, sometimes days or weeks later.

The most common consequence of mushroom poisoning is simply gastrointestinal upset. Most "poisonous" mushrooms contain gastrointestinal irritants which cause [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] (sometimes requiring hospitalization), but usually no long-term damage. However, there are a number of recognized mushroom toxins with specific, and sometimes deadly, effects:
* [[Alpha-amanitin]] (deadly: causes liver damage 1–3 days after ingestion) – principal toxin in genus ''Amanita''.
* [[Phallotoxin]] (causes gastrointestinal upset) – also found in poisonous ''Amanitas''
* [[Orellanine]] (deadly: causes kidney failure within 3 weeks after ingestion) – principal toxin in genus ''Cortinarius''.
* [[Muscarine]] (sometimes deadly: can cause respiratory failure) – found in genus ''Omphalotus''.
* [[Gyromitrin]] (deadly: causes neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal upset, and destruction of blood cells) – principal toxin in genus ''Gyromitra''.
* [[Coprine]] (causes illness when consumed with alcohol) – principal toxin in genus ''Coprinus''.
* [[Ibotenic acid]] (causes neurotoxicity) and [[muscimol]] (hallucinogenic) – principal toxins in ''A. muscaria'', ''A. pantherina'', and ''A. gemmata''.
* [[Psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] (hallucinogenic, 'magic', ''''psychoactive'''') – principal 'toxin' in genus ''Psilocybe''.
* [[Arabitol]] (causes gastrointestinal irritation in some people).
* [[Bolesatine]] a toxin found in ''[[Boletus satanas]]''
* [[Ergotamine]] (deadly: affects the vascular system and can lead to loss of limbs and death): An alkaloid found in genus ''Claviceps''.

Symptoms of mushroom poisoning vary depending on the toxins involved.
* Alpha-amanitin: For 6–12 hours, there are no symptoms. This is followed by a period of gastrointestinal upset (vomiting and profuse, watery diarrhea). This stage is caused primarily by the phallotoxins<ref name="ClinTox2001" /> and typically lasts 24 hours. At the end of this second stage is when severe liver damage begins. The damage may continue for another 2–3 days. Kidney damage can also occur. Some patients will require a liver transplant.<ref name="emedAmanita">

* Orellanine: This toxin causes no symptoms for 3–20 days after ingestion. Typically around day 11, the process of kidney failure begins,<ref name="ClinTox2001" /> and is usually symptomatic by day 20. These symptoms can include pain in the area of the kidneys, thirst, vomiting, [[headache]], and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].

* Muscarine: Muscarine stimulates the muscarinic receptors of the nerves and muscles. Symptoms include sweating, salivation, tears, blurred vision, palpitations, and, in high doses, respiratory failure.<ref name="emed">{{eMedicine|emerg|874|Toxicity, Mushrooms}}
</ref> Muscarine is found in mushrooms of the genus ''Omphalotus'', notably the [[Omphalotus olearius|Jack o' Lantern mushrooms]]. It is also found in ''A. muscaria'', although it is now known that the main effect of this mushroom is caused by ibotenic acid. Muscarine can also be found in some ''[[Inocybe]]'' species and ''[[Clitocybe]]'' species, particularly ''[[Clitocybe dealbata]]'', and some red-pored ''[[Boletes]].''<ref name="Arora" />
* Gyromitrin: Stomach acids convert gyromitrin to [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH), a compound employed in rocket fuel. It affects multiple body systems. It blocks the important neurotransmitter [[GABA]], leading to [[stupor]], [[delirium]], muscle cramps, loss of coordination,<ref name="ClinTox2001" /> [[tremors]], and/or [[seizures]]. It causes severe gastrointestinal irritation, leading to vomiting and diarrhea. In some cases, liver failure has been reported.<ref name="ClinTox2001" /> It can also cause red blood cells to break down, leading to [[jaundice]], kidney failure, and signs of [[anemia]]. It is found in mushrooms of the genus ''Gyromitra''.<ref name="emedGyro" /> A gyromitrin-like compound has also been identified in mushrooms of the genus ''[[Verpa]]''.<ref name="FDAimport" />
* Coprine: Coprine is metabolized to a chemical that resembles [[disulfiram]]. It inhibits [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] (ALDH), which generally causes no harm, unless the person has alcohol in their bloodstream while ALDH is inhibited. This can happen if alcohol is ingested shortly before or up to a few days after eating the mushrooms. In that case the alcohol cannot be completely metabolized, and the person will experience flushed skin, vomiting, [[headache]], [[dizziness]], weakness, apprehension, confusion, palpitations, and sometimes trouble breathing. Coprine is found mainly in mushrooms of the genus ''[[Coprinus]]'', although similar effects have been noted after ingestion of ''[[Clitocybe clavipes]]''.
* Ibotenic acid: This organic acid is metabolized to [[muscimol]]. The effects of muscimol vary, but nausea and vomiting are common. Confusion, euphoria, or sleepiness are possible. Loss of muscular coordination, sweating, and chills are likely. Some people experience visual distortions, a feeling of strength, or delusions. Symptoms normally appear after 30 minutes to 2 hours and last for several hours. ''A. muscaria'', the "Alice in Wonderland" mushroom, is known for the toxic/hallucinogenic properties caused by muscimol, but ''A. pantherina'' and ''A. gemmata'' also contain the same compound.<ref name="Arora" /> While normally self-limiting, fatalities have been associated with ''A. pantherina'',<ref name="emedHallu" /> and consumption of a large number of any of these mushrooms is likely to be dangerous.
* Psilocybin: This compound is converted into [[psilocin]] when ingested. Symptoms begin shortly after ingestion. The effects can include euphoria, visual and religious hallucinations, and heightened perception. However, some persons experience fear, agitation, confusion, and schizophrenia-like symptoms. All symptoms generally pass after several hours. Some (though not all) members of the genus ''Psilocybe'' contain psilocybin, as do some ''[[Panaeolus]]'', ''[[Copelandia]]'', ''[[Conocybe]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus]]'', and others. Some of these mushrooms also contain [[baeocystin]], which has effects similar to psilocin.
* Arabitol: A [[sugar alcohol]], similar to mannitol, which causes no harm in most people but causes gastrointestinal irritation in some. It is found in small amounts in [[oyster mushrooms]], and considerable amounts in ''[[Suillus]]'' species and ''[[Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca]]'' (the "[[false chanterelle]]").<ref name="SporePrints">{{cite web | last = Lindgren | first = Jan | authorlink = Jan Lindgren | coauthors = | title = Theory for why "edible" mushrooms make some people sick | work = Spore Prints | publisher = Puget Sound Mycological Society | month = May | year = 2003 | url = http://www.psms.org/sporeprints/sp392.pdf |format=PDF| format = newsletter | doi = | accessdate = 2008-08-05}}</ref>

Some mushrooms contain less toxic compounds and, therefore, are not severely poisonous. Poisonings by these mushrooms may respond well to treatment. However, certain types of mushrooms, such as the Amanitas, contain very potent toxins and are very poisonous; so even if symptoms are treated promptly [[Mortality rate|mortality]] is high. With some toxins, death can occur in a week or a few days. Although a liver or kidney transplant may save some patients with complete organ failure, in many cases there are no organs available. Patients who are hospitalized and given aggressive support therapy almost immediately after ingestion of amanitin-containing mushrooms have a mortality rate of only 10%, whereas those admitted 60 or more hours after ingestion have a 50–90% mortality rate.<ref name="FDAbadbug">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Mushroom Toxins | work = FDA Bad Bug Book | publisher = FDA | date = 9 January 2008 | url = http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070853.htm | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>

==Poisonous mushrooms==
{{see also|List of deadly fungi}}

Three of the most lethal mushrooms belong to the genus ''[[Amanita]]'': the [[death cap]] (''A. phalloides'') and [[destroying angel]]s (''A. virosa'', and ''A. bisporigera''); the [[fool's mushroom]] (''A. verna'') and two are from the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'': the [[deadly webcap]] (''C. rubellus''), and the [[fool's webcap]] (''C. orellanus''). Several species of [[Galerina]], [[Lepiota]], and [[Conocybe]] also contain lethal amounts of [[amatoxin]]s. Deadly species are listed in the [[List of deadly fungi]].

The following species may cause great discomfort, sometimes requiring hospitalization, but are not considered deadly.
* ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' (fly agaric) – known for its use as an [[entheogen]], and it is now known that the toxins convert to psychoactives upon drying.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
* ''[[Amanita muscaria|Amanita muscaria'' var. ''regalis]]'' – symptoms generally mild.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
* ''[[Amanita pantherina]]'' (panther mushroom) – contains similar toxins as ''A. muscaria'', but is associated with more fatalities than ''A. muscaria''.<ref name="emedHallu" />
* ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' (greengills) – causes intense gastrointestinal upset.
* ''[[Entoloma]]'' (pinkgills) – some species are highly poisonous, such as livid entoloma (''[[Entoloma sinuatum]]''), ''[[Entoloma rhodopolium]]'', and ''[[Entoloma nidorosum]]''. Symptoms of intense gastrointestinal upset appear after 20 minutes to 4 hours, caused by an unidentified gastrointestinal irritant.<ref name="sydney">{{cite web | last = Gover | first = DW | authorlink = DW Gover | coauthors = | title = FUNGAL TOXINS AND THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS | work = | publisher = | date = 2005-04-24 | url = http://www.sydneyfungalstudies.org.au/articles/fungaltoxinsphysioeffec.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2008-08-13}}</ref>
* Many ''[[Inocybe]]'' species such as ''[[Inocybe fastigiata]]'' and ''[[Inocybe geophylla]]'' contain [[muscarine]], while ''[[Inocybe erubescens]]'' is the only one known to have caused death.
* Some white ''[[Clitocybe]]'' species, including ''[[Clitocybe rivulosa|C. rivulosa]]'' and ''[[Clitocybe dealbata|C. dealbata]]'' – contain muscarine.<ref name="Arora" />
* ''[[Tricholoma pardinum]]'', ''[[Tricholoma tigrinum]]'' (Tiger Tricholoma) – gastrointestinal upset due to an unidentified toxin, begins in 15 minutes to 2 hours and lasts 4 to 6 days.
* ''[[Tricholoma equestre]]'' Man-on-horseback – until recently thought edible and good, can lead to [[rhabdomyolysis]] after repeated consumption.
* ''[[Hypholoma fasciculare]]''/''Naematoloma fasciculare'' (Sulfur tuft) – usually causes gastrointestinal upset<ref name="Arora" /> but the toxins fasciculol E and F could lead to paralysis and death<ref name="Nfasciculare">{{cite journal | last = Kumiko | first = Suzuki | authorlink = Suzuki Kumiko | coauthors = Fujimoto Haruhiro, Yamazaki Mikio | title = THE TOXIC PRINCIPLES OF NAEMATOLOMA FASCICULARE | journal = Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 2176–2178 | publisher = | location = Japan | year = 1983 | url = http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110003624406/ | doi = | id = ISSN:00092363 | accessdate = 2008-08-13}}</ref>
* ''[[Paxillus involutus]]'' (Brown roll-rim) – once thought edible, but now found to destroy [[red blood cell]]s with regular or long-term consumption.<ref name="Bresinsky" />
* ''[[Boletus satanas]]'' (Devil's bolete), ''[[Boletus luridus]]'', ''[[Boletus legaliae]]'', ''[[Boletus piperatus]]'', ''[[Boletus erythropus]]'', ''[[Boletus pulcherrimus]]'' – gastrointestinal irritation. Of these, only ''B. pulcherrimus'' has been implicated in a death. Many books list ''B. erythropus'' as edible, but Arora<ref name="Arora" /> lists it as "to be avoided."
* ''[[Hebeloma crustuliniforme]]'' (known as Poison pie or Fairy cakes) – causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
* ''[[Russula emetica]]'' (the Sickener) – [[emetic|as its name implies]], causes rapid vomiting. Other Russulas with a peppery taste (''[[Russula silvicola]]'', ''[[Russula mairei]]'') will likely do the same.<ref name="Arora" />
* ''[[Agaricus hondensis]]'', ''[[Agaricus californicus]]'', ''[[Agaricus praeclaresquamosus]]'', ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus]]'' – cause vomiting and diarrhea in most people, although some people seem to be immune.<ref name="Arora" />
* ''[[Lactarius piperatus]]'', ''[[Lactarius torminosus]]'', ''[[Lactarius rufus]]'' – these and other peppery-tasting ''Lactarius'' are pickled and eaten in [[Scandinavia]], but are indigestible or poisonous unless correctly prepared.<ref name="Arora" />
* ''[[Lactarius vinaceorufescens]]'', ''[[Lactarius uvidus]]'' – reportedly poisonous. Arora<ref name="Arora" /> reports that all yellow- or purple-staining ''Lactarius'' are "best avoided."
* ''[[Ramaria gelatinosa]]'' – causes indigestion in many people, although some seem immune.<ref name="Arora" />
* ''[[Gomphus floccosus]]'' (the scaly chanterelle) – causes gastric upset in many people, although some eat it without problems. ''G. floccosus'' is sometimes confused with the chanterelle.<ref name="Arora" />

==Other causes of poisoning==
Mushrooms may be rendered poisonous by insecticides or herbicides sprayed on lawns or reserves. At least one author recommends never picking them in non-natural landscapes for this reason.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Also, mushrooms are sometimes contaminated by concentrating pollutants, such as heavy metals or radioactive material (see [[Chernobyl disaster effects]]).

Rotten mushrooms may cause [[food poisoning]]. Mushrooms which are mushy, bad-smelling, or moldy (even of a choice edible species) may be toxic due to bacterial decay or mold.

Many mushrooms are high in fiber. Excessive consumption of mushrooms may lead to [[indigestion]], which may be diagnosed as mushroom "poisoning."

==Famous poisonings==
* [[Siddhartha Gautama]] (known as The Buddha), by some [[Gautama_Buddha#Death_.2F_Mahaparinirvana|accounts]], may have died of mushroom poisoning around ~479 BCE,<ref name=Stamets>{{cite book|last=Stamets|first=Paul|title=Growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms|year=2000|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-58008-175-7|pages=1}}</ref> though this claim has not been universally accepted.<ref name=Wasson>{{cite book|last=Wasson|first=Gordon|title=Persephone's Quest: Entheogens and the Origins of Religion|year=1986|publisher=privately published|isbn=0-300-05266-9|pages=131}}</ref>
* Roman Emperor [[Claudius]] is said to have been murdered by being fed the [[death cap]] mushroom. However this story first appeared some two centuries after the events, and it is even debatable whether Claudius was murdered at all.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marmion VJ, Wiedemann TE |title=The death of Claudius |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=260–1 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11983773 |pmc=1279685 |doi= 10.1258/jrsm.95.5.260|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11983773}}</ref> [[Pope Clement VII]] is also rumored to have been murdered this way. However it is similarly debated whether he died from any kind of poisoning at all.
* [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]] and Tsaritsa [[Natalia Naryshkina]] are believed to have died from [[Amanita_phalloides#Notable victims|eating the death cap mushroom]].
* According to a popular legend, the composer [[Johann Schobert]] died in Paris, along with his wife, one of his children, maidservant and four acquaintances after insisting that certain poisonous mushrooms were edible.
* The best-selling author [[Nicholas Evans]] (''[[The Horse Whisperer (book)|The Horse Whisperer]]'') was poisoned after eating ''[[Cortinarius speciosissimus]]''.<ref>http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/Delicious-or-deadly-You-pick.4451032.jp</ref>
* The parents of the physicist [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]], who created the [[degF|Fahrenheit]] temperature scale, died in Danzig on 14 August 1701 from accidentally eating poisonous mushrooms.
