A considered mechanism of action involves brain [[peptides]] called [[orexins]], also known as hypocretins. Orexin neurons are found in the [[hypothalamus]] but project to many different parts of the brain, including several areas that regulate wakefulness.  Activation of these neurons increases dopamine and [[norepinephrine]] in these areas, and excites histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons increasing [[histamine]] levels there. It has been shown in rats that modafinil increases [[histamine]] release in the brain, and this may be a possible mechanism of action in humans.<ref name="pmid12614915">{{cite journal | author = Ishizuka T, Sakamoto Y, Sakurai T, Yamatodani A | title = Modafinil increases histamine release in the anterior hypothalamus of rats | journal = Neurosci.

Modafinil's substantial, but incomplete, independence from both monoaminergic systems and those of the orexin peptides has proven difficult to explain, in contrast to the better-understood mechanisms of stimulants such as [[cocaine]] or amphetamines. Alternative mechanisms of action that have been proposed include the activation of [[glutamate]]rgic circuits while inhibiting [[GABA]]ergic neurotransmission.<ref name="pmid20631691">{{cite journal | author = Tahsili-Fahadan P, Carr GV, Harris GC, Aston-Jones G | title = Modafinil blocks reinstatement of extinguished opiate-seeking in rats: mediation by a glutamate mechanism | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 11 | pages = 2203–10 | year = 2010 | month = October | pmid = 20631691 | pmc = 2939923 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2010.94 }}</ref><ref name="pmid20810311">{{cite journal | author = Nardone R, Bergmann J, Lochner P, Caleri F, Kunz A, Staffen W, Tezzon F, Ladurner G, Trinka E, Golaszewski S | title = Modafinil reverses hypoexcitability of the motor cortex in narcoleptic patients: a TMS study | journal = Sleep Med. | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 870–5 | year = 2010 | month = October | pmid = 20810311 | doi = 10.1016/j.sleep.2010.05.007 }}</ref>
Enhanced [[electrotonic coupling]] by enhancing the effectiveness of direct [[gap junctions]] between neurons has also been suggested by several studies. Most neurons are separated by [[synapses]], and communication between cells is accomplished via release and diffusion of [[neurotransmitters]]. However, some neurons are directly connected to one another via [[gap junctions]], and it is proposed that modafinil influences the effectiveness of these connections. Urbano et al. determined that modafinil increased activity via this mechanism in the [[thalamocortical loop]], which is critical in organizing sensory input and modulating global brain activity.<ref name="pmid17640897">{{cite journal | author = Urbano FJ, Leznik E, Llinás RR | title = Modafinil enhances thalamocortical activity by increasing neuronal electrotonic coupling | journal = Proc.

Further research by the same group also noted the capacity of the calmodulin kinase&nbsp;II ([[CaMKII]]) inhibitor, KN-93, to abolish modafinil's enhancement of electrotonic coupling. They came to the conclusion that modafinil's effect is mediated, at least in part, by a CaMKII-dependent [[exocytosis]] of gap junctions between [[GABA]]ergic [[interneurons]] and possibly even [[glutamatergic]] [[pyramidal cells]].  Additionally, Garcia-Rill et al. discovered that modafinil has pro electrotonic effects on specific populations of neurons in two sites in the reticular activating system.  These sites, the [[subcoeruleus]] nucleus and the [[pedunculopontine]] nucleus, are thought to enhance arousal via [[cholinergic]] inputs to the [[thalamus]].<ref name="pmid18041475">{{cite journal | author = Garcia-Rill E, Heister DS, Ye M, Charlesworth A, Hayar A | title = Electrical coupling: novel mechanism for sleep-wake control | journal = Sleep | volume = 30 | issue = 11 | pages = 1405–14 | year = 2007 | month = November | pmid = 18041475 | pmc = 2082101 | doi = }}</ref>

Looking more closely at electrotonic coupling, gap junctions permit the diffusion of current across linked cells and result in higher resistance to [[action potential]] induction since [[excitatory post-synaptic potentials]] must to diffuse across a greater membrane area. This means, however, that when action potentials do arise in coupled cell populations, the entire populations tend to fire in a synchronized manner.<ref name="Siegel J 2008">{{cite news |author=Siegel J |title=Gaps that wake you up|work=Department of Psychiatry, University of California, Los Angeles |year=2008|url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sleepresearch/2008/08%20modafinil%20gaps%20siegel.pdf}}</ref> Thus enhanced electrotonic coupling results in lower [[tonicity|tonic]] activity of the coupled cells while increasing rhythmicity.  Agreeing with data implicating [[catecholamine]]rgic mechanisms, modafinil increases [[phasic]] activity in the [[locus coeruleus]] (the source for CNS norepinephrine) while reducing tonic activity with respect to interconnections with the prefrontal cortex.<ref name="pmid19074351">{{cite journal | author = Minzenberg MJ, Watrous AJ, Yoon JH, Ursu S, Carter CS | title = Modafinil shifts human locus coeruleus to low-tonic, high-phasic activity during functional MRI | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5908 | pages = 1700–2 | year = 2008 | month = December | pmid = 19074351 | doi = 10.1126/science.1164908 }}</ref>  This implies an increased signal-to-noise ratio in the circuits connecting the two regions.

Direct links between electrotonic coupling and wakefulness were provided by Beck et al. who showed that administration of modafinil enhanced arousal-specific P13 evoked potentials in a gap-junction dependent manner.<ref name="pmid19090320">{{cite journal | author = Beck P, Odle A, Wallace-Huitt T, Skinner RD, Garcia-Rill E | title = Modafinil increases arousal determined by P13 potential amplitude: an effect blocked by gap junction antagonists | journal = Sleep | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 1647–54 | year = 2008 | month = December | pmid = 19090320 | pmc = 2603487 | doi = | url = http://www.websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?ID=20083728 }}</ref> Tying into inconclusive effects on monoamine systems, enhanced electrotonic coupling is thought to reduce activity in localized populations of GABAergic neurons whose normal function is to reduce neurotransmitter release in other cells.<ref name="Siegel J 2008"/>  For example, dopamine release in the [[nucleus accumbens]] has been demonstrated to be the result of decreased GABAergic tone.<ref name="pmid8813612">{{cite journal | author = Ferraro L, Tanganelli S, O'Connor WT, Antonelli T, Rambert F, Fuxe K | title = The vigilance promoting drug modafinil increases dopamine release in the rat nucleus accumbens via the involvement of a local GABAergic mechanism | journal = Eur.

It is likely that modafinil's exact pharmacology will feature the interaction of direct effects on electrotonic coupling and various receptor-mediated events.

Recently, modafinil was screened at a large panel of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s and [[membrane transport protein|transporter]]s in an attempt to elucidate its pharmacology.<ref name="pmid19197004">{{cite pmid | 19197004}}</ref> Of the sites tested, it was found to significantly act only on the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT), inhibiting the [[reuptake]] of dopamine with an [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] value of 4&nbsp;μM. Accordingly, it increases [[hyperactivity|locomotor activity]] and extracellular dopamine concentrations in a manner similar to the [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (DRI) [[vanoxerine]], and also blocks [[methamphetamine]]-induced dopamine release. As a result, it appears that modafinil exerts its effects by acting as a weak DRI, though it cannot be ruled out that other mechanisms may also be at play. On account of its action as a DRI and lack of [[abuse potential]], modafinil was suggested as a treatment for [[methamphetamine]] [[drug addiction|addiction]] by the authors of the study.<ref name="pmid19197004" />

The (''R'')-enantiomer of modafinil has also recently been found to act as a [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>receptor]] [[partial agonist]], with a [[dissociation constant|K<sub>i</sub>]] of 16&nbsp;nM, an [[intrinsic activity]] of 48%, and an [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] of 120&nbsp;nM, in rat [[striatum|striatal]] tissue.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Modafinil  [[enzyme inhibitor|induces]] the [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2B6]] and [[CYP3A4]], as well as inhibiting [[CYP2C9]] and [[CYP2C19]] in vitro. It may also induce [[P-glycoprotein]], which may affect drugs transported by Pgp, such as [[digoxin]]. The [[bioavailability]] of Modafinil is greater than 80% of the administered dose. In vitro measurements indicate that 60% of modafinil is bound to plasma proteins at clinical concentrations of the drug. This percentage actually changes very little when the concentration is varied.<ref name="Hardman">Hardman, Joel and Limbird, Lee. 2001. "Goodman and Gilman’s: The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics." Edition 10. pp 1984t. New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> C<sub>max</sub> occurs approximately 2–3 hours after administration. Food slows absorption, but does not affect the total [[Area under the curve|AUC]]. Half-life is generally in the 10–12 hour range, subject to differences in CYP genotypes, liver function and renal function. It is metabolized in the liver, and its inactive metabolite is excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of the unchanged drug ranges from 0% to as high as 18.7%, depending on various factors.<ref name="Hardman"/>

Modafinil's efficacy in improving vigor and well-being in sleep deprivation subjects is dependent on [[COMT]] status. Research suggests that individuals with the Val/Val genotype experience a great improvement in their cognitive function, while those with the Met/Met genotype experience very little improvement.{{cite pmid|19037200}}

==History==

Modafinil was originally developed in France by [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiologist]] and [[emeritus]] experimental medicine professor [[Michel Jouvet]] and Lafon Laboratories.<ref>Lafon Laboratories was bought by American firm [[Cephalon]] in 2001.</ref> Modafinil originated with the late 1970s invention of a series of benzhydryl sulfinyl compounds, including [[adrafinil]], which latter was first offered as an experimental treatment for narcolepsy in France in 1986. Modafinil is the primary metabolite of adrafinil, lacking the polar -OH group on its terminal amide,<ref name=Ballas>{{cite journal|last=Ballas|first=Christos A|coauthors=Deborah Kim, Claudia F Baldassano, Nicholas Hoeh|title=Modafinil: past, present and future|journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics|year=2002|month=July|volume=2|issue=4|pages=449–57|doi=10.1586/14737175.2.4.449|pmid=19810941|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref> and has similar activity to the parent drug but is much more widely used.  It has been prescribed in France since 1994 under the name Modiodal, and in the US since 1998 as Provigil. It was approved for use in the UK in December 2002. Modafinil is marketed in the US by [[Cephalon|Cephalon Inc.]], who originally leased the rights from Lafon, but eventually purchased the company in 2001.

In the United States, modafinil is approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] only for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]], [[shift work sleep disorder]], and as an adjunct treatment for obstructive [[sleep apnea]]/[[hypopnea]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The prevalence and cost of unapproved uses of top-selling orphan drugs |author=Kesselheim AS, Myers JA, Solomon DH, Winkelmayer WC, Levin R, Avorn J |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=2 |page=e31894 |date=2012 February 21 |pmid=22363762 |pmc=3283698 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031894 |editor1-last=Alessi-Severini |editor1-first=Silvia}}</ref> In some countries, it is also approved for other [[hypersomnia]]s, like [[idiopathic hypersomnia]]. The usual prescribed dosage for these disorders is 200&nbsp;mg once a day (less commonly, 100 to 400&nbsp;mg/day in one or two doses).

For conditions other than shift work sleep disorder, modafinil is normally taken in one dose in the morning or in two doses in the morning and at midday. It is generally not recommended to take modafinil after noon: modafinil is a relatively long-acting drug with a half-life of 15 hours, and taking it during the later part of the day carries a risk of sleep disturbances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/about-multiple-sclerosis/what-we-know-about-ms/treatments/medications/modafinil/index.aspx |title=Provigil (modafinil) |publisher=(U.S.) National Multiple Sclerosis Society}}</ref>{{MEDRS|date=June 2012}}

Because of the risk for development of skin or hypersensitivity reactions and neuropsychiatric disorders, the [[European Medicines Agency]] has recommended that new patient prescriptions should only be to treat sleepiness associated with narcolepsy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66L5ZN20100722|work=Reuters |title=Use of Cephalon's Provigil could be limited in Europe |date=2010-07-22}}</ref> Because any serious side effects will usually appear within the first twelve weeks, the guidance does not require patients already receiving treatment to stop taking the drug.<ref>European Medicines Agency, EMA/725532/2010 rev.

===ADHD===
Modafinil was shown to be an effective treatment for [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]](ADHD);<ref name="adhd1" /> however, in 2006, it was found by the FDA to be unfit for use by children for that purpose. It was rejected primarily due to two cases of serious skin rash, suspected to have been [[Erythema multiforme]] or [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], among 933 subjects receiving the drug.<ref name="urlwww.fda.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/slides/2006-4212S1-01-02-FDAAndreason.ppt |title=www.fda.gov|work= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref><ref name="urlModafinil ( Provigil )">{{cite web|url=http://www.modafinil.com/ |title=Modafinil ( Provigil ) |work= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref><ref name="pmid19300563">{{cite journal |author=Rugino T |title=A review of modafinil film-coated tablets for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents |journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat|volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293–301 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=19300563 |pmc=2654790 |doi=|url=}}</ref><ref name="urlFDA cites Stevens-Johnson in modafinils ADHD rejection | Clinical Psychiatry News | Find Articles at BNET">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4345/is_9_34/ai_n29293254/ |title=FDA cites Stevens-Johnson in modafinil's ADHD rejection &#124; Clinical Psychiatry News &#124; Find Articles at BNET |work= Clinical Psychiatry News|accessdate=2010-08-07 | first=Elizabeth | last=Mechcatie | year=2006}}</ref> Cephalon's own label for Provigil now discourages its use by children for any purpose.<ref name="adhd1">{{cite journal |author=Biederman J, Pliszka SR |title=Modafinil improves symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder across subtypes in children and adolescents |journal=J.

A [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized]] [[double-blind study]] of modafinil showed that normal healthy volunteers between the ages of 30-44 showed general improvement in alertness as well as mood.  In the three-day study, counterbalanced, randomized, crossover, inpatient trial of modafinil 400&nbsp;mg was administered as well as a placebo to the control group.  The conclusion demonstrated that modafinil may have general mood-elevating effects in particular for the adjunctive use in [[treatment-resistant depression]].<ref name="Bonaventure"/>

===Depersonalization disorder===

Modafinil used alone has been reported to be effective in a subgroup of individuals with [[depersonalisation disorder]]; the subgroup of people with depersonalisation disorder most likely to respond are those who have attentional impairments, under-arousal and [[hypersomnia]].

===Cocaine addiction===

Modafinil is under investigation as a possible method to treat cocaine dependence, for several reasons involving biochemical mechanisms of the two drugs, as well as the observation that clinical effects of modafinil are largely opposite to symptoms of cocaine withdrawal.

The pilot 8-week double-blind study of modafinil for cocaine dependence (2004) produced inconclusive results. The number of cocaine-positive urine samples was significantly lower in the modafinil group as compared to the placebo group in the middle of the trial, but by the end of the 8 weeks the difference stopped being significant. Even before the treatment began, the modafinil group had lower cocaine consumption further confounding the results. As compared to placebo, modafinil did not reduce cocaine craving or self-reported cocaine use, and the physicians ratings were only insignificantly better.<ref name="pmid15525998">{{cite journal |author=Dackis CA, Kampman KM, Lynch KG, Pettinati HM, O'Brien CP|title=A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of modafinil for cocaine dependence|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=205–11 |year=2005 |pmid=15525998|doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300600}}</ref> Dan Umanoff, of the National Association for the Advancement and Advocacy of Addicts, criticized the authors of the study for leaving the negative results out of the discussion part and the abstract of the article.<ref name="pmid16294193">{{cite journal |author=Umanoff DF |title=Trial of modafinil for cocaine dependence |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=12|pages=2298; author reply 2299–300 |year=2005 |pmid=16294193|doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300866}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dackis CA, Kampman KM, Lynch KG, Pettinati HM, O'Brien CP |title=Reply: Do Self-Reports Reliably Assess Abstinence in Cocaine-Dependent Patients?|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=2299–300 |year=2005|doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300867}}</ref>

In experimental studies, the appetite reducing effect of modafinil appears to be similar to that of amphetamines, but, unlike amphetamines, the dose of modafinil that is effective at decreasing food intake does not significantly increase heart rate. Also, an article published in the ''Annals of Clinical Psychiatry'', presented the case of a 280 pound patient (BMI=35.52) who lost 40 pounds over the course of a year on Modafinil (to 30.44 BMI). After three years, his weight stabilized at a 50 pound weight loss (29.59 BMI).

===Military and law enforcement===

Militaries of several countries are known to have expressed interest in Modafinil as an alternative to [[amphetamine]]s—the drug traditionally employed in combat situations where troops face [[sleep deprivation]], such as during lengthy missions. The [[France|French]] government indicated that the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] used modafinil during certain covert operations.

==Contraindications and warnings==
Literature distributed by maker Cephalon advises that it is important to consult a [[physician]] before using Modafinil, particularly for those with:
* Hypersensitivity to the drug or other constituents of the tablets (such as lactose or lactose monohydrate), or
* Previous cardiovascular problems, particularly while using other stimulants, or
* [[Cirrhosis]], or should not be taken with alcohol, a recent study conducted showed slight euphoria, increased blood pressure, heart rate and some subjects also presented with mild to moderate effects mimicking amphetamines.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* Cardiac conditions, particularly:
** [[Left ventricular hypertrophy]], or
** [[Mitral valve prolapse]].
*** [[Asymptomatic]] MVP is not uncommon, but neither is it prominently discussed in Modafinil's context.
* Modafinil can make certain types of birth control pills less effective, which could result in an unplanned pregnancy.
Modafinil in combination with [[Yohimbine]] causes a dangerous increase in heart rate and blood pressure.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1359924?ordinalpos=4&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum |title=Role of catecholamines in the modafinil and amphetamine induced wakefulness, a comparative pharmacological study in the cat. 1992 Sep 25 |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2012-05-24 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Modafinil is less likely than its parent drug, adrafinil, to cause side-effects such as stomach pain, skin irritation, anxiety and (with prolonged use) elevated [[Liver function tests|liver enzymes]].<ref name=Ballas/> Common side effects of modafinil include:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tevausa.com/assets/base/products/pi/Modafinil_PI.pdf |format=PDF |title=Modafinil Information Page |publisher=[[Teva Pharmaceuticals]] |date=2012-02-01}}</ref>

* Back pain
* Headache
* [[Nausea]]
* Nervousness
* Stuffy nose
* [[Diarrhea]]
* Anxiety
* [[Dizziness]]
* Upset stomach
* Trouble sleeping

Serious side effects include:

* Serious rash
* Serious allergic reaction involving the liver or blood cells
* [[Urticaria|Hives]]
* [[Mouth ulcer|Mouth sores]]
* Blistering or peeling skin
* Swelling of the face, eyes, lips, tongue, legs, or throat
* Trouble swallowing or breathing
* [[Fever]]
* [[Dyspnea|Shortness of breath]]

In 2007, the FDA ordered Cephalon to modify the Provigil leaflet in bold-face print of several serious and potentially fatal conditions attributed to modafinil use, including [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (TEN), [[DRESS syndrome]], and [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] (SJS).

===Toxicity===
In mice and rats, the [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) of modafinil is approximately or slightly greater than 1250&nbsp;mg/kg. Oral LD<sub>50</sub> values reported for rats range from 1000&nbsp;mg/kg to 3400&nbsp;mg/kg. Intravenous LD<sub>50</sub> for dogs is 300&nbsp;mg/kg. Clinical trials on humans involving taking up to 1200&nbsp;mg/day for 7 to 21 days and known incidents of acute one-time overdoses up to 4500&nbsp;mg did not appear to cause life-threatening effects, although a number of adverse experiences were observed, including excitation or agitation, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, confusion, nervousness, tremor, palpitations, sleep disturbances, nausea, and diarrhea.<ref name="fda_label">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/briefing/2007-4325b_04_08_Modafinil%20Label.pdf |format=PDF |title=FDA Approved Labeling Text for Provigil |date=2004-01-23 |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref> As of 2004, FDA is not aware of any fatal overdoses involving modafinil alone (as opposed to multiple drugs, including modafinil).<ref name="fda_label"/>  Consequently, oral LD<sub>50</sub> of modafinil in humans is not known exactly.

Modafinil may induce severe dermatologic reactions requiring hospitalization. From the date of initial marketing, December 1998, to January 30, 2007, FDA received six cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions associated with modafinil, including [[erythema multiforme]] (EM), SJS, TEN, and DRESS involving adult and pediatric patients. The FDA issued a relevant alert. In the same alert, the FDA also noted that [[angioedema]] and multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in postmarketing experience.<ref>{{cite web |title=Modafinil (marketed as Provigil): Serious Skin Reactions |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/dsn/2007_fall/postmarketing.htm#modafinil}}</ref>

==Addictive potential==
A [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) study highlighted "the need for heightened awareness for potential abuse of and dependence on modafinil in vulnerable populations" due to the drug's effect on dopamine in the brain's reward center.<ref name="pmid19293415">{{cite journal | author = Volkow ND, Fowler JS, Logan J, Alexoff D, Zhu W, Telang F, Wang GJ, Jayne M, Hooker JM, Wong C, Hubbard B, Carter P, Warner D, King P, Shea C, Xu Y, Muench L, Apelskog-Torres K | title = Effects of modafinil on dopamine and dopamine transporters in the male human brain: clinical implications | journal = JAMA | volume = 301 | issue = 11 | pages = 1148–54 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19293415 | pmc = 2696807 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.351 }}</ref> However, the synergistic actions of modafinil on both [[catecholamine]]rgic and [[histamine]]rgic pathways lower abuse potential as compared to traditional stimulant drugs while maintaining the effectiveness of the drug as a wakefulness promoting agent.

==Patent protection and antitrust litigation==
{{US patent|4927855}} was issued to [[Laboratoire L. Lafon]] on May 22, 1990, covering the chemical compound modafinil. After receiving an interim term extension of 1066 days and [[pediatric exclusivity]] of six-months, it expired on October 22, 2010.  On October 6, 1994, Cephalon filed an additional patent, covering modafinil in the form of particles of defined size.  That patent, {{US patent|5618845}} was issued on April 8, 1997, but was reissued in 2002 as RE 37,516, which surrendered the 5618845 patent. With pediatric exclusivity, this patent was due to expire on April 6, 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2006/03/27/daily13.html |title=Cephalon gets six-month Provigil patent extension |publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal |date=2006-03-28 |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/patent/index.php?query=RE37516|title=Details for Patent: RE37516}}</ref>

On December 24, 2002, anticipating the expiration of exclusive marketing rights, generic drug manufacturers Mylan, Teva, Barr, and Ranbaxy applied to the FDA to market a generic form of modafinil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prescriptionaccess.org/lawsuitssettlements/current_lawsuits?id=0024 |title=Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) Project :: Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) Project :: Lawsuits & Settlements :: Current Lawsuits |publisher=Prescriptionaccess.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> At least one withdrew its application after early opposition by Cephalon based on the '516 patent. There is some question as to whether a particle size patent is sufficient protection against the manufacture of generics.  Pertinent questions include whether modafinil may be modified or manufactured to avoid the granularities specified in the new Cephalon patent, and whether patenting particle size is invalid because particles of appropriate sizes are likely to be obvious to practitioners skilled in the art.  However, under United States patent law, a patent is entitled to a legal presumption of validity, meaning that in order to invalidate the patent, much more than "pertinent questions" are required.

Cephalon made an agreement with four major generics manufacturers [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[Barr Pharmaceuticals]], [[Ranbaxy Laboratories]], and [[Watson Pharmaceuticals]] between 2005 and 2006 to delay sales of generic modafinil in the US until April 2012 by these companies in exchange for upfront and royalty payments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/873364/000104746909001690/a2190556z10-k.htm|title=Cephalon Inc., SEC 10K 2008 disclosure |pages=9–10| date=23 February 2009|accessdate=29 August 2009}}</ref>  Litigation arising from these agreements is still pending including an FTC suit filed in April 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=CVS, Rite Aid Sue Cephalon Over Generic Provigil |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=arNEtMSU7D9s |accessdate=29 August 2009 |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=2009-08-21}}</ref> [[Apotex]] received regulatory approval in Canada despite a suit from Cephalon's marketing partner in Canada, [[Shire Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=71906 |title=Canada IP Year in Review 2008|date=1 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shire v.

==Legal status==
Modafinil is {{As of|2005|alt=currently}} classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule IV controlled substance]] under [[United States]] federal law; it is illegal to import by anyone other than a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]-registered importer without a prescription.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/illegal_internet.html |publisher=[[United States Drug Enforcement Administration]] |title=Is It Illegal to Obtain Controlled Substances From the Internet? |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>  However, one may legally bring Modafinil into the United States in person from a foreign country, provided that he or she has a prescription for it, and the drug is properly declared at the border crossing. U.S. residents are limited to 50 dosage units (''i.e.'' pills).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1301/1301_26.htm |title=USC 201 Section 1301.26 Exemptions from import or export requirements for personal medical use |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |date=1997-03-24}}</ref> Note that [[Adrafinil]], a drug that is closely related to Modafinil, is currently not classified as a controlled substance and therefore is not as severely regulated.
Under the US [[Food and Drug Act]], drug companies are not allowed to market their drugs for [[off-label use]]s (conditions other than those officially approved by the FDA);<ref>U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The following countries do not classify Modafinil as a controlled substance:
* Canada (not listed in the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]], but it is a Schedule F prescription drug,<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2005/2005-03-26/html/reg5-eng.html#REF1 |title=Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (1184 — Modafinil) |journal=[[Canada Gazette]] |volume=140 |issue=20 |date=2006-10-04 |format= &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3ARegulations+Amending+the+Food+and+Drug+Regulations+%281184+%E2%80%94+Modafinil%29&as_publication=%5B%5BCanada+Gazette%5D%5D&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |author1=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}} {{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref> so it is subject to seizure by [[Canada Border Services Agency]])

* [[Australia]] (listed as a Schedule 4 prescription drug)
* In [[Germany]] the classification has been changed from controlled substance (BtM) to prescription drug (RP) effective March 1, 2008.
* In [[India]], generic retailing as Modalert is available from [[Sun Pharmaceuticals]]; Indian firms are not required to respect [[Pharmaceuticals in India#Patents|patents filed before 1995]].

Currently, use of modafinil is controversial in the sporting world, with high profile cases attracting press coverage since several prominent [[United States|American]] athletes have tested positive for the substance (see [[#Doping agent|Modafinil as a doping agent]]). Some athletes who were found to have used modafinil protested that the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offenses. However, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) maintains that it was related to already banned substances. The Agency added modafinil to its list of prohibited substances on August 3, 2004, ten days before the start of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].
