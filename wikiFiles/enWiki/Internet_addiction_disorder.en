'''Internet addiction disorder''' ('''IAD'''), or, more broadly, ''Internet overuse'', ''problematic computer use'' or ''pathological computer use'', is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life.<ref name="CPandB"/>  These terms avoid the term ''[[Behavioral addiction|addiction]]'' and are not limited to any single cause.

IAD was originally proposed as a [[psychological disorder|disorder]] in a [[satire|satirical]] [[hoax]] by Ivan Goldberg, M.D., in 1995.<ref>[http://www.nurseweek.com/features/97-8/iadct.html Internet Addiction?] August 8, 1997</ref>
He took [[pathological gambling]] as diagnosed by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] ([[DSM-IV]]) as his model for the description<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psycom.net/iadcriteria.html|title=Internet Addictive Disorder (IAD)Diagnostic Criteria|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> of IAD. It is not, however, included in the current DSM as of 2009. IAD receives coverage in the press, and possible future classification as a psychological disorder continues to be [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=99602 debated and researched in the psychiatric community]. 

Online activities which, if done in person, would normally be considered troublesome, such as compulsive gambling, or shopping, are sometimes called ''net compulsions''.<ref>[http://www.netaddiction.com/net_compulsions.htm Types of Internet addiction?]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref>
Other habits such as reading, playing computer games, or watching a staggering amount of internet videos or movies are all troubling only to the extent that these activities interfere with normal life.
Supporters of disorder classification often divide IAD into subtypes by activity, such as excessive, overwhelming, or inappropriate [[pornography]] use,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02049/types_1.htm |title=Internet addiction Disorder: The Mind Prison-types |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref>

==Disputed disorder==
Over the past decade, the concept of Internet addiction has grown in terms of acceptance as a legitimate  clinical disorder often requiring treatment.<ref>Young, K., S., and Nabuco de Abreu, C. (ed.) (2011) ''Internet Addiction, A handbook and guide to evaluation and treatment''. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</ref>  However, known academic authorities take stances in either supporting or opposing the existence of Internet addiction disorder (IAD).  In 2006, the [[American Medical Association]] declined to recommend to the [[American Psychiatric Association]] that they include IAD as a formal diagnosis in DSM-V,<ref>[http://psychcentral.com/news/2007/06/26/video-games-no-addiction-for-now/ Video Games No Addiction For Now] June 26, 2007</ref> and recommended further study of "video game overuse."<ref name="LATimes Phạm">{{cite news|title=Medical association backs off labeling 'video-game addiction'|author=Alex Phạm|first=Alex|last=Phạm|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2007-06-22|page=C1|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1292728181.html?dids=1292728181:1292728181&FMT=ABS}}<!-- http://news.cincypost.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070628/NEWS01/706280356 --><!-- http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CNPB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=11A1482975669BC8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420 --></ref>
Some members of the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] opposed identifying Internet overuse and video game overuse as disorders.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/fun.games/06/25/addiction.video.games.reut/index.html Experts: Video games not an addiction] June 25, 2007</ref> Among the research identified as necessary is to find  ways to define "overuse" and to differentiate an "Internet addiction" from [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]], [[self-medicating]] for depression or other disorders, and [[compulsive behavior|compulsion]].  A debate over whether to include "Internet Addiction" as a diagnosis in [[DSM-V]], may conclude in the May, 2013 edition of the DSM.  Some argue that Internet addiction disorder exists and should be included, and some that it is neither an [[addiction]] nor a [[Disorder (medicine)|specific disorder]] and should not be included in [[DSM-V]].

While the existence of Internet addiction is debated, self-proclaimed sufferers are resorting to the courts for redress. In one American case (Pacenza v. IBM Corp.), the plaintiff argued he was illegally dismissed from his employment in violation of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] because of Internet addiction triggered by [[Vietnam War]]-related [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=9942461|title=Internet Addiction: The Next Disability|accessdate=2009-01-31|publisher=LRP Publications|date=February 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>http://overlawyered.com/2007/02/update-pacenza-v-ibm-lawsuit-alleges-internet-sex-chat-addiction-is-entitled-to-ada-protection/</ref>
The case is pending before the court in the Southern District of New York (case summarized in Glaser & Carroll, 2007).

25% of users fulfill Internet addiction criteria within the first six months of using the Internet. Many individuals initially report feeling intimidated by the computer but gradually feel a sense of "competency and exhilaration from mastering the technology and learning to navigate the applications quickly by visual stimulation" (Beard 374). The feeling of exhilaration can be explained by the way IAD sufferers often describe themselves as: bold, outgoing, open-minded, intellectually prideful, and assertive.<ref name ="Beard and Wolf">{{cite journal|coauthors=Keith W.

Data from China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), as of January 16 2012 showed that over 513 million Chinese are now connected online, which is 55.4% of the "netizen" population in Asia, and 23.2% of the similar population in the world.<ref>http://www1.cnnic.cn/uploadfiles/pdf/2012/2/27/112543.pdf</ref>{{dead link|date=January 2013}}  The [[Communist Youth League|China Communist Youth League]] claimed in 2007 that over 17% of Chinese citizens between 13 and 17 were addicted to the Internet.<ref>[http://www.pacificepoch.com/newsstories/86510_0_5_0_M/ 17% Of Youth Addicted To Internet] January 11, 2007</ref>

Public concern, interest in, and the study of, internet over use can be attributed to the fact that it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between the online and offline worlds.

Another supporter, [[David Greenfield, PhD]] of the [Center for Internet and Technology Addiction] conducted a study with [[ABC News]].com in 1999 and is author of ''Virtual Addiction.''  He believes that some services available over the [[Internet]] have unique psychological properties which induce [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], time distortion, and instant gratification, with about 6% of individuals experiencing some significant impact on their lives. However, he says it may not best be seen as an addiction but rather as a [[compulsive behavior|compulsion]].  Greenfield claims that sex, gaming, gambling, and shopping online can produce a mood-altering effect.

According to the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery (whose director is Kimberly S. Young,<ref name=youngk2009>Young, K. (2009). Issues for Internet  Addiction as a New Diagnosis in the DSM-V. Washington, District of Columbia, US:  American Psychological Association.

In his essay Internet Addiction: Does it Really Exist? Mark Griffiths states that "[t]he way of determining whether nonchemical (i.e., behavioral) addictions are addictive in a nonmetaphorical sense is to compare them against clinical criteria for other established drug-ingested addictions", and although his data is dated, and may no longer represent average internet use accurately, Griffiths comes to the conclusion that the internet does meet that criteria for addiction in a small number of users.<ref>Griffiths, Mark.

[[Patricia Wallace]] PhD, Senior Director, Information Technology and CTY Online, at the [[Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth]] argues<ref>Wallace, P. (2001) ''The Psychology of the Internet'', paperback edn, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> that based on the case histories that have surfaced, no one denies that excessive involvement with certain psychological spaces on the net can have serious effects on a person’s life.  [[Patricia Wallace]] PhD explains that, at a large university in New York, the dropout rate among freshmen newcomers rose dramatically as their investment in computers and Internet access increased, and the administrators learned that 43% of the dropouts were staying up all night on the Internet.

===Opposition===
Psychiatrist Dr. Goldberg states that Internet addiction disorder is not a true addiction and may in fact be no more than a symptom of other, existing disorders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news82749930.html |title=Experts debate Internet addiction |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref>  An overbroad description of addiction leaves open the possibility of every compensatory behavior being declared an addiction.  For example, a person who has lengthy telephone conversations with a friend to avoid an unpleasant situation could be declared "addicted to the telephone" with equal validity as a person who chats on the Internet with the same underlying goal.

Most, if not all "Internet addicts", already fall under existing diagnostic labels.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/01/fashion/thursdaystyles/01addict.html?ex=1184731200&en=29b02b567c2ef1ef&ei=5070 Hooked on the Web: Help Is on the Way]</ref><ref>Young, Kimberly "The Relationship Between Depression and Internet Addiction", 1998</ref>  For many individuals, overuse or inappropriate use of the Internet is a manifestation of their [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[impulse control]] disorders, or [[pathological gambling]].<ref>[http://www.netaddiction.com/newspr/press_release_index.htm#PR4 Press Releases #4 at netaddiction.com]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> IAD is compared to [[food addiction]], in which patients overeat as a form of self-medication for depression, anxiety, etc., without actually being truly [[Behavioral addiction|addicted]] to eating.

It is possible that a person could have a pathological relationship with a specific aspect of the Internet, such as bidding on [[online auctions]], viewing [[pornography]], online gaming, or online gambling (which is included under the existing [[Problem gambling#Pathological gambling|Pathological Gambling]]), but that does not make the Internet medium itself addictive. For example,<ref>[http://www.netaddiction.com/newspr/press_release_index.htm#PR4 Press Release #4 at netaddiction.com]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> whether gambling is done on a computer or face-to-face does not affect whether or not it is pathological; a person with poor impulse control can lose sleep over a suspenseful novel or favorite television show or a computer game or the temptation to click on another web link.

Also, there are significant and critical differences between common Internet activities (e-mail, chatting, web surfing) and pathological gambling, which the IAD notion heavily parallels.  The Internet is largely a pro-social, interactive, and information-driven medium, while gambling is seen as a single, anti-social behavior that has very little social redeeming value.  Many so-called Internet addicts do not suffer from the same damage to health and relationships that are common to established addictions.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

A complete review of the Internet addiction research at the end of 2008 (Byun et al., 2008) demonstrated significant, multiple flaws in most studies in this area. The researchers wrote in that article, "The analysis showed that previous studies have utilized inconsistent criteria to define Internet addicts, applied recruiting methods that may cause serious [[sampling bias]], and examined data using primarily exploratory rather than confirmatory data analysis techniques to investigate the degree of association rather than causal relationships among variables."<ref name="CPandB">{{cite journal|coauthors=Sookeun Byun, Celestino Ruffini, Juline E.

==Causes and effects==
[[Kimberly Young|Dr. Kimberly S. Young]] <ref>Young,K.(1998)"The Relationship Between Depression and Internet Addiction",CyberPsychology & Behavior, 1(1),p25-28.</ref> says that prior research links Internet Addiction Disorder with existing mental health issues, most commonly depression. This may be due to that virtual engagements do not stimulate the release of neurotransmitters responsible for feelings of satisfaction and relaxation, such as oxytocin and endorphin, the way real interactions do. <ref>{{cite web|last=Poquérusse|first=Jessie|title=The Neuroscience of Sharing|url=https://www.uniiverse.com/neuroscience|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> Young states that the disorder has significant effects socially, psychologically and occupationally. Addicts were known to use the internet an average of 38 hours a week for nonacademic and non-employment purposes resulting in poor grades among students, discord among couples and reduced work performance.

In an article titled ''Internet Over-Users' Psychological Profiles: A Behavior Sampling Analysis on Internet Addiction'' <ref>Sang-Min Whang, L. Lee, S. Chang, Geunyoung.(2003)"Internet Over-Users' Psychological Profiles: A Behavior Sampling Analysis on Internet Addiction", CyberPsychology & Behavior,6(2),p143-152</ref> a Korean study into the disorder, pathological use of the internet results in negative life consequences such as job loss, marriage breakdown, financial debt, and academic failure. 70% of internet users in Korea are reported to play online games, 18% of which are diagnosed as [[Game addiction|game addicts]]. The authors of the article conducted a study utilising [[Kimberly Young]]'s questionnaire. The study showed that the majority of those who met the requirements of [[Internet Addiction Disorder]] suffered from interpersonal difficulties and stress and that those addicted to online games specifically responded that they hoped to avoid reality.

[[Kimberly Young|Dr. Kimberly S. Young]] <ref>Young, K., S. (1998) ''Caught in the Net''. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</ref> states that 52% of the respondents to her own study said that they were following recovery programs for other addictions.  These included [[alcoholism]], [[chemical dependency]], [[compulsive gambling]], or [[Overeating|chronic overeating]].  These participants could see the same excessive behaviour, the need for a crutch to help them relax, in their use of the Internet, that they had exhibited in prior addictions.  Though they believed that Internet addiction was not as serious as [[alcoholism]], they still felt disheartened that a new addiction had substituted for the old one.  Young<ref>Young, K., S (1999) 'Internet Addiction: Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment'. reproduced from VandeCreel, L., Jackson, t., L (e.d.), (1999) 'Innovations in Clinical Practice' ''Professional Resource Press." (17)</ref> also discusses the findings of  [[Maressa Orzack|Dr. Maressa Hecht-Orzack]] of [[McLean Hospital]] who set up a service for computer and Internet addiction<ref>[http://www.icaservices.com/ Service for Computer and Internet addiction]</ref> in the spring of 1996.  Orzack noted that primarily [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[bi-polar disorder]] in its depressive swing were co-morbid features of pathological Internet use, along with this Orzack indicated that referrals received were from various clinics throughout the hospital rather than direct self-referrals for Internet addiction.

Determining the cause of excessive internet use as it relates to negative outcomes may require a consideration of moderating factors. For example, excessive use accompanied by the cognitive factor of high preoccupation with the internet (excessive thinking about the internet) has been found to be related to greater amounts of negative outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Caplan|first=Scott E.|coauthors=Andrew High|title=Beyond Excessive Use: The Interaction between Cognitive and Behavioral Symptoms of Problematic Internet Use|journal=Communication Research Reports|year=2006|volume=23|issue=4|page=265}}</ref>

==Measurement==
===Psychiatric Services study===
[[Psychiatric Services]] conducted a study <ref>Psychiatric Services.(2001)"Internet Addiction Disorder Among Clients of a Virtual Clinic", online article, http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=86615</ref> in which visitors to a virtual mental health clinic could discuss their ailments with 100 volunteer mental health professionals.
Psychiatric Services hypothesized, internet users who suffered from existing mental health problems, specifically depression and symptoms of social impairment, had a higher risk of developing IAD.
The study was conducted between May and October 2000. All visitors to the virtual clinic completed Young's IAD questionnaire <ref>Young,K.(2009)"Internet Addiction Test",Online, http://www.netaddiction.com/index.php?option=com_bfquiz&view=onepage&catid=46&Itemid=106</ref> a brief seven-item instrument that adapts DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling.

{{Block quote|{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} total of 251 clients completed the questionnaire. The mean±SD age of the clients was 25.04±6.19 years, with a range of 14 to 44 years. Most were female (67 percent) and single (84 percent). Most had an education beyond the college level (63 percent), and about a third (36 percent) were students. A majority (56 percent) reported that they had never visited a real mental health clinic.}}

===Internet Addiction Test===
The ''Internet Addiction Test'' (IAT) is the first validated instrument to assess Internet addiction.<ref name="Young"/> Studies have found<ref name="Young"/> that the IAT is a reliable measure that covers the key characteristics of pathological online use.  The test measures the extent of a client’s involvement with the computer and classifies the addictive behavior in terms of mild, moderate, and severe impairment.  The IAT can be utilized in outpatient and inpatient settings and adapted accordingly to fit the needs of the clinical setting.  Furthermore, beyond validation in English, the IAT has also been validated in Italy (Ferraro, Caci, D' Amico, & Di Blasi, 2007<ref>Ferraro, G., Caci, B., D' Amico, A,. and Di Blasi, M. (2007) 'Internet addiction disorder: An Italian study' ''CyberPsychology & Behaviour'', 10(2), pp.170–175 in Young, K. (2011). 'Clinical Assessment of Internet-Addicted Clients' in Young, K., Nabuco do Abreu, C. (ed). Internet Addiction. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons Inc.</ref>) and France (Khazaal et al., 2008<ref>Khazaal, Y., Billieux, J., Thorens, G., Kahan, R., Louati, Y., Scarlatti, E., et al. (2008). 'French validation of the Internet Addiction test.' ''CyberPsychology & Behaviour'', 11(6), pp.703–706. in Young, K. (2011). 'Clinical Assessment of Internet-Addicted Clients' in Young, K., Nabuco do Abreu, C. (ed). Internet Addiction. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons Inc</ref>) making it the first global psychometric measure.<ref name = "Young">Young, K. (2011). 'Clinical Assessment of Internet-Addicted Clients' in Young, K., Nabuco do Abreu, C. (ed). Internet Addiction. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons Inc.</ref>

The test consists of twenty questions with answers rated from 1 to 5, which produces a score from 20 to 100.<ref name="Young"/>

===Griffiths criteria===
[[Mark D. Griffiths]]' five criteria of Internet addiction are:<ref>Joinson, A. N. (2003) ''Understanding the Psychology of Internet Behaviour'', Houndmills: Palgrave McMillan.</ref><ref>Griffiths, M. D. (1998) 'Internet addiction: does it really exist?' in Gackenbach, J. (ed), Psychology and the Internet. New York: Academic Press, pp. 61–75.</ref>

#'''Salience:''' Using the Internet dominates the person’s life, feelings and behaviour.
#'''Mood modification:''' The person experiences changes in mood (e.g. a ‘buzz’) when using the Internet.
#'''Tolerance:''' Increasing amounts of Internet use are needed to achieve the same effects on mood.
#'''Withdrawal symptoms:''' If the person stops using the Internet, they experience unpleasant feelings or physical effects.
#'''Relapse:''' The addict tends to relapse into earlier patterns of behaviour, even after years of abstinence or control.

==Prevention and correction==
In many cases, though not all, Internet overuse corrects itself.  Sarah Kershaw wrote for the New York Times in 2005:  "It was Professor Kiesler who called Internet addiction a fad illness.

===Communication addiction disorder===
{{Main|Communication addiction disorder}}
Communication addiction disorder is a behavior disorder related to the necessity of being in constant communication with other people, even when there is no practical necessity for such communication. Within an article titled 'Communication Addiction Disorder: Concern over Media, Behavior and Effects'<ref>Walther,J,B.(1999)"Communication Addiction Disorder: Concern over Media, Behavior and Effects",online article, http://psychcentral.com/archives/walther_cad.pdf</ref> internet overuse or Internet Addiction (IAD) is linked to communication addiction disorder, a theorized disorder in which users become addicted to the social elements of the internet, such as Facebook and YouTube. Users become addicted to one-on-one/group communication in the form of social support, relationships and entertainment however interference with these activities can result in conflict and guilt.

===Online gaming addiction===
[[Video game addiction]] is a known issue around the world. Incidence and severity grew in the 2000s, with the advent of broadband technology, games allowing for the creation of avatars, 'second life' games, and MMORPGs ([[massive multiplayer online role playing games]]). [[World of Warcraft]] has the largest MMORPG community on-line and there have been a number of studies about the addictive qualities of the game. Addicts of the game range from children to mature adults. A well-known example is Ryan van Cleave, a university professor whose life declined as he became involved in on-line gaming. <ref>"At war with World of Warcraft", The Guardian, London, 29 August 2011. Retrieved on 2012-03-15. http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/aug/29/world-of-warcraft-video-game-addict</ref> Andrew Doan, MD, PhD, a physician with a research background in neuroscience, battled his own addictions with video games, investing over 20,000 hours of playing games over a period of nine years. <ref>http://www.hooked-on-games.com/about-the-book.html</ref>

Online gaming addiction may be considered in terms of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s theory of [[operant conditioning]], which claims that the frequency of a given behaviour is directly linked to rewarding and punishment of that behavior. If a behaviour is rewarded, it is more likely to be repeated. If it is punished, it becomes suppressed.<ref>"The Virtual Skinner Box", Retrieved on 2012-03-15. http://www.nickyee.com/eqt/skinner.html</ref>  Orzack says {{ Citation needed| date=April 2012}}[[variable ratio reinforcement]] that the best way to optimize the desired behaviour in the subject is to provide rewards for correct behaviour, and then adjust the number of times the subject is required to exhibit that behaviour before a reward is provided.{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} For instance, if a rat must press a bar to receive food, then it will press faster and more often if it doesn't know how many times it needs to press the bar. An equivalent in World of Warcraft would be purple (epic) loot drops <ref name = "doctor">Reimer, Jeremy. "Doctor claims 40 percent of World of Warcraft players are addicted", ARS Technica, 9 August 2006. Retrieved on 2012-03-15.</ref> Players in World of Warcraft will often spend weeks hunting for a special item which is based on a chance system, sometimes with only a 0.001% chance of it being dropped by a slain monster. The rarity of the item and difficulty of acquiring the item gives the player a status amongst their peers once they obtain the item.

Orzack, a clinical psychologist at McLean Hospital in Massachusetts claims that 40 percent of World of Warcraft (WoW) players are addicted.<ref name="doctor"/>

[[Online Gamers Anonymous]], an American non-profit organization formed in 2002, is a twelve-step, self-help, support and recovery organization for gamers and their loved ones who are suffering from the adverse effects of addictive computer gaming.
