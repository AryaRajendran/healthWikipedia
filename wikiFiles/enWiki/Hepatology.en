'''Hepatology''' is the branch of [[medicine]] that incorporates the study of [[liver]], [[gallbladder]], [[biliary tree]], and [[pancreas]] as well as management of their disorders. [[Etymologically]] the word ''Hepatology'' is formed of [[ancient Greek]] ''hepar''(ηπαρ) or ''hepato-''(ηπατο-) meaning 'liver' and suffix ''-logia''(-λογια) meaning 'word' or 'speech'. Although traditionally considered a sub-specialty of [[gastroenterology]], rapid expansion has led in some countries to doctors specializing solely on this area, who are called '''hepatologists'''.

Diseases and complications related to [[viral hepatitis]] and alcohol are the main reason for seeking specialist advice. More than 2 billion people have been infected with [[Hepatitis B]] virus at some point in their life, and approximately 350 million have become persistent carriers.<ref name="urlWHO | Hepatitis B">{{cite web

}}</ref>  Up to 80% of [[liver cancer]]s can be attributed to either hepatitis B or [[Hepatitis C]] virus. In terms of [[Mortality rate|mortality]], the former is second only to smoking among known agents causing [[cancer]]. With more widespread implementation of [[vaccination]] and strict [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] before [[blood transfusion]], lower [[infection]] rates are expected in the future. In many countries, though, overall alcohol consumption is increasing, and consequently the number of people with [[cirrhosis]] and other related complications is commensurately increasing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Scope of specialty==
As for many medical specialties, patients are most likely to be referred by family physicians ( i.e., GP) or by physicians from different disciplines. The reasons might be:
* Drug overdose. [[Paracetamol hepatotoxicity|Paracetamol overdose]] is common.
* [[Gastrointestinal bleeding]] from [[portal hypertension]] related to liver damage
* Abnormal blood test suggesting [[liver disease]]
* [[Enzyme]] defects leading to bigger liver in children commonly named [[storage disease]] of liver
* [[Jaundice]] / [[Hepatitis]] virus positivity in blood, perhaps discovered on screening blood tests
* [[Ascites]] or swelling of [[abdomen]] from fluid accumulation, commonly due to liver disease but can be from other diseases like heart failure
* All patients with advanced liver disease e.g. cirrhosis should be under specialist care
* To undergo [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]] for diagnosing diseases of biliary tree or their management
* [[Fever]] with other features suggestive of infection involving mentioned organs. Some exotic [[tropical]] diseases like [[hydatid cyst]], [[kala-azar]] or [[schistosomiasis]] may be suspected. [[Microbiologists]] would be involved as well
* [[multisystem disease|Systemic diseases]] affecting liver and biliary tree e.g. [[haemochromatosis]]
* Follow up of [[liver transplant]]
* [[Pancreatitis]] - commonly due to alcohol or [[gall stone]]
* Cancer of above organs. Usually multi-disciplinary approach is undertaken with involvement of [[oncologist]] and other experts.

==History==

Evidence from autopsies on Egyptian [[mummies]] suggest that liver damage from [[parasitic]] infection [[Bilharziasis]] was widespread in the ancient society.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosalie David A, Contis G |title=Paleopathology on schistosomiasis in Egyptian mummies |journal=Parasitol.

It is possible that the [[Greeks]] may have been aware of the liver's ability to exponentially duplicate as illustrated by the story of [[Prometheus]]. However, knowledge about liver disease in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] is questionable. Most of the important advances in the field have been made in the last 50 years.
