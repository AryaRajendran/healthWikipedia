==Early life and education==
According to church records, Thomas Wynne was the fourth of five sons of Thomas Wynne Sr., Thomas Wynne lost his father at the age of 11.<ref>Thomas Allen Glenn Welsh Founders of Pennsylvania, 1970 reprint 1911 original</ref> While attracted to the study of [[medicine]] early on, heavy [[tax]]es levied on his family originally made the acquisition of proper learning materials difficult. His trade was that of cooper. He was later able to make the acquaintance of an established surgeon by the name of Richard Moore, and soon he was able to apprentice until he was deemed worthy of licensing. He was licensed in [[Shropshire]] by Drs.

After Martha died, he married Mrs. Elizabeth Rowden (b. 1637; d. after 1691) on July 20, 1676, and she accompanied him as he joined Penn on his trip to America, leaving on August 30 and landing on October 27, 1682.<ref>Wynne is an [http://www.welcomesociety.org/Welcome_ancestors.htm approved ancestor] for the [http://www.welcomesociety.org/ Welcome Society].</ref>
