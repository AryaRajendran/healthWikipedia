==History and name==
Nicotine is named after the tobacco plant ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]],'' which in turn is named after the [[France|French]] ambassador in [[Portugal]], [[Jean Nicot|Jean Nicot de Villemain]], who sent tobacco and seeds to [[Paris]] in 1560, and who promoted their medicinal use. The tobacco and seeds were brought to ambassador Nicot from [[Brazil]] by [[Luis de Gois]], a Portuguese colonist in [[São Paulo]]. Nicotine was first isolated from the tobacco plant in 1828 by physician Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and chemist Karl Ludwig Reimann of [[Germany]], who considered it a poison.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Posselt, W.; Reimann, L. |title=Chemische Untersuchung des Tabaks und Darstellung eines eigenthümlich wirksamen Prinzips dieser Pflanze |trans_title=Chemical investigation of tobacco and preparation of a characteristically active constituent of this plant |language=German |journal=Magazin für Pharmacie |volume=6 |issue=24 |pages=138–161 |year=1828 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cgkCAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA138}}</ref><ref name="pmid16463054">{{cite journal | author = Henningfield JE, Zeller M | title = Nicotine psychopharmacology research contributions to United States and global tobacco regulation: a look back and a look forward | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 184 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 286–91 | year = 2006 | month = March | pmid = 16463054 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-006-0308-4 }}</ref> Its chemical [[empirical formula]] was described by [[Louis Melsens|Melsens]] in 1843,<ref>Melsens, Louis-Henri-Frédéric (1843) [http://books.google.com/books?id=j-E3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA465#v=onepage&q&f=false "Note sur la nicotine,"] ''Annales de chimie et de physique'', third series, vol. 9, pages 465-479; see especially page 470.

===Historical use of nicotine as an insecticide===
[[Tobacco]] was introduced to [[Europe]] in 1559, and by the late 17th century, it was used not only for [[smoking]] but also as an [[insecticide]]. After [[World War II]], over 2,500 tons of nicotine insecticide (waste from the tobacco industry) were used worldwide, but by the 1980s the use of nicotine insecticide had declined below 200 tons. This was due to the availability of other insecticides that are cheaper and less harmful to [[mammal]]s.<ref name=Ujvary />

Currently, nicotine is a permitted [[pesticide]] for [[organic farming]] because it is derived from a botanical source. Nicotine sulfate sold for use as a pesticide is labeled "DANGER," indicating that it is highly toxic.<ref name=organic /> However, in 2008, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] received a request to cancel the registration of the last nicotine pesticide registered in the United States.<ref name=epacancel1>{{Cite journal | author = USEPA | title = Nicotine; Notice of Receipt of Request to Voluntarily Cancel a Pesticide Registration | journal = Federal Register | pages = 64320–64322 | date = 29 October 2008 | url = https://federalregister.gov/a/E8-25831 | accessdate = 8 April 2012 }}</ref>
This request was granted, and after 1 January 2014, this pesticide will not be available for sale.<ref name=epacancel2>{{Cite journal | author = USEPA | title = Nicotine; Product Cancellation Order | journal = Federal Register | pages = 26695–26696 | url = https://federalregister.gov/a/E9-12561 | date = 3 June 2009 | accessdate = 8 April 2012 }}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Nicotine is a [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]], oily liquid that is [[miscible]] with [[water (molecule)|water]] in its [[base (chemistry)|base]] form. As a [[nitrogenous base]], nicotine forms [[salt]]s with [[acid]]s that are usually solid and water soluble, for example nicotine sulfate which, being a solid, is easier to handle in its use as an insecticide. (For retail use it is sold as solution in water ready for spraying.)<ref name=organic/> Its [[flash point]] is 95°C and its auto-ignition temperature is 244°C.<ref name=SLMSDS>[http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9926222 www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9926222] Material Safety Data Sheet

==Optical activity==
Nicotine is [[optically active]], having two [[enantiomer]]ic forms. The naturally occurring form of nicotine is [[levorotatory]] with a [[specific rotation]] of [α]<sub>D</sub> = –166.4° ((−)-nicotine). The [[dextrorotatory]] form, (+)-nicotine is physiologically less active than (–)-nicotine. (−)-nicotine is more toxic than (+)-nicotine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gause|first=G.

==Biosynthesis==
[[File:Nicotine biosynthesis june 2012.png|thumb|300px|Nicotine biosynthesis]]
The biosynthetic pathway of nicotine involves a coupling reaction between the two cyclic structures that compose nicotine. Metabolic studies show that the [[pyridine]] ring of nicotine is derived from [[niacin]] (nicotinic acid) while the pyrrolidone is derived from N-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006300259904925 |title=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Ornithine as a precursor for the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine |publisher=ScienceDirect.com |date=2002-12-16 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Dawson RF, Christman DR, D'Adamo A, Solt ML, Wolf AP | title = The Biosynthesis of Nicotine from Isotopically Labeled Nicotinic Acids | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | year = 1960 | volume = 82 | issue = 10 | pages = 2628–2633 | doi = 10.1021/ja01495a059 }}</ref>  Biosynthesis of the two component structures proceeds via two independent syntheses, the NAD pathway for niacin and the tropane pathway for N-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation.

The NAD pathway in the genus ''[[nicotiana]]'' begins with the oxidation of aspartic acid into α-imino succinate by aspartate oxidase (AO). This is followed by a condensation with [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] and a cyclization catalyzed by quinolinate synthase (QS) to give [[quinolinic acid]]. Quinolinic acid then reacts with phosphoriboxyl pyrophosphate catalyzed by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPT) to form niacin mononucleotide (NaMN). The reaction now proceeds via the NAD salvage cycle to produce niacin via the conversion of [[nicotinamide]] by the enzyme [[nicotinamidase]].

The N-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation used in the synthesis of nicotine is an intermediate in the synthesis of tropane-derived alkaloids. Biosynthesis begins with [[decarboxylation]] of [[ornithine]] by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce [[putrescine]]. Putrescine is then converted into N-methyl putrescine via [[methylation]] by SAM catalyzed by putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT). N-methylputrescine then undergoes [[deamination]] into 4-methylaminobutanal by the N-methylputrescine oxidase (MPO) enzyme, 4-methylaminobutanal then spontaneously cyclize into N-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation.

The final step in the synthesis of nicotine is the coupling between N-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation and niacin. Although studies conclude some form of coupling between the two component structures, the definite process and mechanism remains undetermined. The current agreed theory involves the conversion of niacin into 2,5-dihydropyridine through 3,6-dihydronicotinic acid. The 2,5-dihydropyridine intermediate would then react with N-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation to form [[enantiomer]]ically pure (–)-nicotine.<ref name=plant-meta>{{cite book|last=Komamine|first=edited by Hiroshi Ashihara, Alan Crozier, Atsushi|title=Plant metabolism and biotechnology|publisher=Wiley|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780470747032}}</ref>

The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the types of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. For [[chewing tobacco]], [[dipping tobacco]], [[snus]] and [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], which are held in the mouth between the lip and gum, or taken in the nose, the amount released into the body tends to be much greater than smoked tobacco.{{Clarify|Say how much for each?|date=July 2011}} Nicotine is [[metabolized]] in the [[liver]] by [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes (mostly [[CYP2A6]], and also by [[CYP2B6]]).

===Detection of use===
====Medical detection====
Nicotine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary cotinine concentrations are frequently measured for the purposes of pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benowitz NL, Hukkanen J, Jacob P |title=Nicotine chemistry, metabolism, kinetics and biomarkers |pages=29–60 |year=2009 |pmid=19184645 |pmc=2953858 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69248-5_2 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |isbn=978-3-540-69246-1 |volume=192 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Randall Clint |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |year=2008 |publisher=Biomedical Publications |isbn=978-0-9626523-7-0 |edition=8th |pages=1103–7}}</ref> Nicotine use is not regulated in competitive sports programs, yet the drug has been shown to have a significant beneficial effect on athletic endurance in subjects who have not used nicotine before.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Mündel, T. and Jones, D.

===Pharmacodynamics===
Nicotine acts on the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, specifically the [[ganglion type nicotinic receptor]] and one [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|CNS nicotinic receptor]]. The former is present in the [[adrenal medulla]] and elsewhere, while the latter is present in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). In small concentrations, nicotine increases the activity of these receptors. Nicotine also has effects on a variety of other neurotransmitters through less direct mechanisms.

====In the central nervous system====
[[File:NicotineDopaminergic WP1602.png|thumb|right|Effect of nicotine on dopaminergic neurons.]]
By binding to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, nicotine increases the levels of several [[neurotransmitter]]s&nbsp;– acting as a sort of "volume control". It is thought that increased levels of [[dopamine]] in the [[reward circuit]]s of the [[Human brain|brain]] are responsible for the apparent [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] and [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], and addiction caused by nicotine consumption. Nicotine has a higher affinity for [[acetylcholine]] receptors in the brain than those in [[skeletal muscle]], though at toxic doses it can induce contractions and respiratory paralysis.<ref>{{cite book |author=Katzung, Bertram G. |title=Basic and Clinical Pharmacology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |year=2006 |pages=99–105 }}</ref> Nicotine's selectivity is thought to be due to a particular amino acid difference on these receptor subtypes.<ref name="pmid19252481">{{cite journal | author = Xiu X, Puskar NL, Shanata JA, Lester HA, Dougherty DA | title = Nicotine binding to brain receptors requires a strong cation-pi interaction | journal = Nature | volume = 458 | issue = 7237 | pages = 534–7 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19252481 | pmc = 2755585 | doi = 10.1038/nature07768 }}</ref>

Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing the release of epinephrine (and noradrenaline) into the [[bloodstream]]. Nicotine also has an affinity for [[melanin]]-containing tissues due to its precursor function in melanin synthesis or due to the irreversible binding of melanin and nicotine. This has been suggested to underlie the increased [[nicotine dependence]] and lower [[smoking cessation]] rates in darker pigmented individuals. However, further research is warranted before a definite conclusive link can be inferred.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King G, Yerger VB, Whembolua GL, Bendel RB, Kittles R, Moolchan ET |title=Link between facultative melanin and tobacco use among African Americans |journal=Pharmacol.

====In adrenal medulla====
[[File:NicotineChromaffinCells WP1603.png|thumb|300px|Effect of nicotine on chromaffin cells.]]
By binding to [[ganglion type nicotinic receptor]]s in the adrenal medulla nicotine increases flow of [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine), a stimulating [[hormone]] and neurotransmitter. By binding to the receptors, it causes cell depolarization and an influx of [[calcium]] through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the [[exocytosis]] of [[Chromaffin cell|chromaffin granules]] and thus the release of [[epinephrine]] (and norepinephrine) into the [[bloodstream]]. The release of [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) causes an increase in [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]] and [[breathing|respiration]], as well as higher [[blood glucose]] levels.<ref name="Marieb" >{{cite book | author = Elaine N.

Nicotine is the natural product of tobacco, having a half-life of 1 to 2 hours. [[Cotinine]] is an active metabolite of nicotine that remains in the blood for 18 to 20 hours, making it easier to analyze due to its longer half-life.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Detection of Cotinine in Blood Plasma by HPLC MS/MS |journal=MIT Undergraduate Research Journal |volume=8 |date=Spring 2003 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/murj/www/v08/v08-Reports/v08-r2.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

When a [[cigarette]] is smoked, nicotine-rich blood passes from the [[Human lung|lung]]s to the [[Human brain|brain]] within seven seconds and immediately stimulates the release of many chemical messengers such as [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[epinephrine]], [[vasopressin]], [[histamine]], [[arginine]], [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[autocrine agents]], and [[beta-endorphin]].<ref>''[http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/par16.htm Chemically Correct: Nicotine]'', Andrew Novick</ref> This release of neurotransmitters and hormones is responsible for most of nicotine's effects.

When they wish to relax, they take deep puffs, which produce a high level of blood nicotine, which depresses the passage of [[nerve impulses]], producing a mild sedative effect. At low doses, nicotine potently enhances the actions of [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the brain, causing a drug effect typical of those of [[psychostimulants]]. At higher doses, nicotine enhances the effect of [[serotonin]] and [[opiate]] activity, producing a calming, [[analgesic|pain-killing]] effect. Nicotine is unique in comparison to most [[drug]]s, as its profile changes from [[stimulant]] to [[sedative]]/[[pain killer]] in increasing [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosage]]s and use.

==Dependence and withdrawal==
{{See also|Smoking cessation}}
Modern [[research]] shows that nicotine acts on the brain to produce a number of effects. Specifically, research examining its addictive nature has been found to show that nicotine activates the [[mesolimbic pathway]] ("reward system")&nbsp;– the circuitry within the brain that regulates feelings of pleasure and euphoria.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Institute on Drug Abuse |chapter=Extent, Impact, Delivery, and Addictiveness |chapterurl=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco-addiction/what-are-extent-impact-tobacco-use |title=Tobacco Addiction |publisher=National Institutes of Health |location=Bethesda MA |year=June 2009 |series=NIDA Report Research Series |id=09-4342 |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco-addiction}}</ref>

[[Dopamine]] is one of the key [[neurotransmitters]] actively involved in the brain. Research shows that by increasing the levels of dopamine within the reward circuits in the brain, nicotine acts as a chemical with intense addictive qualities. In many studies it has been shown to be more addictive than [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/science/is-nicotine-addictive-it-depends-on-whose-criteria-you-use.html | work=The New York Times | first=Philip J. | last=Hilts | title=Is Nicotine Addictive?

As dopamine regulates the sensitivity of nicotinic [[acetylcholine]] receptors decreases. To compensate for this compensatory mechanism, the brain in turn upregulates the number of receptors, [[convoluting]] its regulatory effects with compensatory mechanisms meant to counteract other compensatory mechanisms. An example is the increase in [[norepinephrine]], one of the successors to dopamine, which inhibit reuptake of the [[glutamate receptors]],<ref name="pmid6493048">{{cite journal | author = Yoshida T, Nishioka H, Nakamura Y, Kondo M | title = Reduced norepinephrine turnover in mice with monosodium glutamate-induced obesity | journal = Metab.

The net effect is an increase in reward pathway sensitivity, the opposite of other addictive drugs such as cocaine and heroin, which reduce reward pathway sensitivity.<ref name=Kenny/> This neuronal brain alteration can persist for months after administration ceases.

===Immunology prevention===
[[File:Nicotin 8338.JPG|thumb|A model of a nicotine molecule]]

Because of the severe addictions and the harmful effects of smoking, vaccination protocols have been developed. The principle operates under the premise that if an antibody is attached to a nicotine molecule, it will be prevented from diffusing through the [[capillaries]], thus making it less likely that it ever affects the brain by binding to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]].

These include attaching the nicotine molecule as a [[hapten]] to a protein carrier such as [[Keyhole limpet hemocyanin]] or a safe modified bacterial toxin to elicit an active immune response. Often it is added with [[bovine serum albumin]].

Additionally, because of concerns with the unique immune systems of individuals being liable to produce antibodies against endogenous hormones and over the counter drugs, [[monoclonal antibodies]] have been developed for short term passive immune protection. They have half-lives varying from hours to weeks. Their half-lives depend on their ability to resist degradation from [[pinocytosis]] by [[epithelial cells]].<ref name="pmid19592672">{{cite journal | author = Peterson EC, Owens SM | title = Designing immunotherapies to thwart drug abuse | journal = Mol.

The [[Teratogenesis|teratogenic]] properties of nicotine has been investigated.  According to a study of ca. 77,000 pregnant women in Denmark{{fact|date=March 2013}}, women who used [[nicotine gum]] and patches during the early stages of pregnancy were found to face an increased risk of having babies with birth defects. The study showed that women who used nicotine-replacement therapy in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy had a 60% greater risk of having babies with birth defects compared to women who were non-smokers.

Tobacco use among pregnant women has also been correlated to increased frequency of ADHD. Children born to mothers who used tobacco were two and a half times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rauch, Stephen and Lanphear, Bruce |title=Prevention of Disability in Children:Elevating the Role of Environment |journal= Future of Children |volume=22 |issue=1 |year=2012 |url=http://www.futureofchildren.org/futureofchildren/publications/docs/22_01_09.pdf }}</ref> Froelich estimated that "exposure to higher levels of lead and prenatal tobacco each accounted for 500,000 additional cases of ADHD in U.S. children".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tanya Froelich, "et al." |title=Association of Tobacco and Lead Exposures with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder |journal=Pediatrics |issue=124 |year=2009 }}</ref>

Effective April 1, 1990, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) of the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] added nicotine to the list of chemicals known to cause developmental toxicity.<ref>http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/prop65_list/files/P65single121809.pdf</ref>

==Therapeutic uses==
The primary therapeutic use of nicotine is in treating nicotine dependence in order to eliminate [[smoking]] with the damage it does to health. Controlled levels of nicotine are given to patients through gums, dermal patches, lozenges, electronic/substitute cigarettes or nasal sprays in an effort to wean them off their dependence.

However, in a few situations, smoking has been observed to be of therapeutic value.
These are often referred to as "[[Smoker’s Paradoxes]]".<ref name="Cohen_2001">{{cite journal | author = Cohen DJ, Doucet M, Cutlip DE, Ho KK, Popma JJ, Kuntz RE | title = Impact of smoking on clinical and angiographic restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention: another smoker's paradox? | journal = Circulation | volume = 104 | issue = 7 | pages = 773–8 | year = 2001 | month = August | pmid = 11502701 | doi = 10.1161/hc3201.094225 }}</ref> Although in most cases the actual mechanism is understood only poorly or not at all, it is generally believed that the principal beneficial action is due to the nicotine administered, and that administration of nicotine without smoking may be as beneficial as smoking, without the higher risk to health due to [[tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] and other ingredients found in tobacco.

For instance, studies suggest that smokers require less frequent repeated [[revascularization]] after [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI).<ref name="Cohen_2001"/> Risk of [[ulcerative colitis]] has been frequently shown to be reduced by smokers on a dose-dependent basis; the effect is eliminated if the individual stops smoking.<ref name="ohcm">{{cite book |author=Longmore, M., Wilkinson, I., Torok, E. |title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine |page=232 |edition=5th}}</ref><ref name="pmid11069313">{{cite journal | author = Green JT, Richardson C, Marshall RW, Rhodes J, McKirdy HC, Thomas GA, Williams GT | title = Nitric oxide mediates a therapeutic effect of nicotine in ulcerative colitis | journal = Aliment.

Tobacco smoke has been shown to contain compounds capable of inhibiting [[monoamine oxidase]], which is responsible for the degradation of dopamine in the human brain.

Studies suggest a correlation between smoking and [[schizophrenia]], with estimates near 75% for the proportion of schizophrenic patients who smoke.

While acute/initial nicotine intake causes activation of nicotine receptors, chronic low doses of nicotine use leads to desensitisation of nicotine receptors (due to the development of tolerance) and results in an antidepressant effect, with research showing low dose nicotine patches being an effective treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] in non-smokers.<ref name="pmid20965579">{{cite journal |author=Mineur YS, Picciotto MR |title=Nicotine receptors and depression: revisiting and revising the cholinergic hypothesis |journal=Trends Pharmacol.
