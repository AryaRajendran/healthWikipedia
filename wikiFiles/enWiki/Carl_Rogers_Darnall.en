==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Darnall was born on his father’s farm in the [[Cottage Hill, Texas|Cottage Hill]] community near [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]], in [[Collin County, Texas]]. He was the eldest of the seven children of Reverend Joseph Rogers Darnall, minister of the [[Christian Church]], and Mary Ellen (Thomas) Darnall. 

He studied at [[Carlton College]], [[Bonham, Texas]], and [[Transylvania University]], [[Lexington, Kentucky]] and received a [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree from [[Jefferson Medical College]], [[Philadelphia]] (1890). In 1892 he married Annie Estella Major of [[Erwinna, Pennsylvania]]. In 1896, after a few years of private practice, he was commissioned a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] and assistant surgeon in the U.S. Army. He graduated from the [[Army Medical School]] in Washington the following year.

===Early career===
Darnall’s first assignments were to stations in Texas – [[Fort Clark, Texas|Fort Clark]] at [[Brackettville, Texas|Brackettville]], and [[Fort McIntosh, Texas|Fort McIntosh]] at [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]. During the [[Spanish-American War]] (1898), Darnall served in [[Cuba]]. Later, he served as an operating surgeon and pathologist aboard the hospital ship [[USS Relief (1896)|USS ''Relief'']] in the [[Philippines]] and commanded the hospital at [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]]. He was one of the few medical officers that accompanied the Allied Forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/biographies/darnall.html|title=Carl Rodgers Darnall Brigadier General U.

===Chlorination===

In 1902, Darnall returned to Washington, D.C., and served as secretary of the faculty and instructor for sanitary chemistry and operative surgery at the Army Medical School. It was while a [[Major (United States)|major]] and a professor of chemistry there that he demonstrated the value of [[anhydrous]], liquefied chlorine in purifying water. His 1910 invention, the mechanical liquid chlorine purifier (known as a "chlorinator"), was the prototype of the technology that is now applied to municipal water supplies throughout the world. Darnall also devised and patented a water filter that was used by the Army for many years. Major [[William J. L. Lyster|William Lyster]] further adapted the process of water chlorination to field use by inventing a method to apply [[sodium hypochlorite]] in a cloth bag, known as a [[Lyster bag]].

===Later career===
Darnall was promoted to [[Colonel]] in 1917. During [[World War I]], Darnall’s talents for business and organization were recognized and he was assigned to the Finance and Supply Division in the Office of The Surgeon General (OTSG). After the war, he served as department surgeon in Hawaii. In 1925, he returned to the OTSG as [[executive officer]]. In November (or December 5?), 1929, he was promoted to brigadier general and became the Commanding General of the Army Medical Center, a post he held until he retired on December 31, 1931. 

Darnall died on 18 January 1941 at [[Walter Reed General Hospital]], [[Washington, D.C.]]. Six days earlier, his wife had died at the family home in Washington. They left three sons, Joseph Rogers (1894–1976), William Major (b. 1895), and Carl Robert (b. 1904), all of whom served in some capacity in the Army. He is buried in the [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

==Awards and honors==
Darnall was a [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons]], a member of the [[American Medical Association]] and [[Association of Military Surgeons of the United States]]. He was a veteran of the [[Military Order of the Carabao]], member of the [[Army and Navy Club, Washington|Army and Navy Club]] of Washington, and Founder Member of the [[Army and Navy Country Club]]. Darnall received the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] for his organizing, developing and administering medical supplies during World War I.
