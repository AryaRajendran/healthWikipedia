'''Polyhydramnios''' ('''polyhydramnion''', '''hydramnios''', '''polyhydramnios''') is a medical condition describing an excess of [[amniotic fluid]] in the [[amniotic sac]]. It is seen in about 1% of pregnancies.<ref>Alexander, ES, Spitz, HB, Clark, RA. Sonography of polyhydramnios.

There are two clinical varieties of polyhydramnios:
* Chronic polyhydramnios where excess amniotic fluid accumulates gradually
* Acute polyhydramnios where excess amniotic fluid collects rapidly

The opposite to polyhydramnios is [[oligohydramnios]], a deficiency in amniotic fluid.

==Causes==
[[File:Ultrasound Scan ND 152505 1531230 cr.png|thumb]]
In most cases, the exact cause cannot be identified. A single case of polyhydramnios may have one or more causes.  Some cases are due to maternal [[diabetes mellitus]], which causes fetal [[hyperglycemia]] and resulting [[polyuria]] (fetal urine is a major source of amniotic fluid) and also rh-isoimmunisation can cause it. Few cases are associated with fetal anomalies that impair the ability of the fetus to swallow (the fetus normally swallows the amniotic fluid). These anomalies include: 

*[[gastrointestinal]] abnormalities such as [[esophageal atresia]], [[duodenal atresia]], facial cleft, neck masses, tracheoesophageal fistula, and diaphragmatic hernias. An annular pancreas causing obstruction may also be the cause. 
*Bochdalek's hernia, in which the pleuro-peritoneal membranes (especially the left) will fail to develop & seal the pericardio- peritoneal canals.  This results in the stomach protrusion up into the thoracic cavity, and the fetus is unable to swallow sufficient amounts of amniotic fluid.
* fetal [[renal]] disorders that results in increased urine production during pregnancy, such as in antenatal [[Bartter syndrome]].<ref name="pmid18695706">{{cite journal |author=Seyberth HW. |title=An improved terminology and classification of Bartter-like syndromes. |journal=Nat Clin Pract Nephrol.  |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=560–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18695706 |doi=10.1038/ncpneph0912}}</ref> Molecular diagnosis is available for these conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moldiag.de/en/dis/bartter.htm |title=Hereditary disease: Bartter syndrome |publisher=Moldiag.de |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>
*neurological abnormalities such as [[anencephaly]], which impair the swallowing reflex 
*chromosomal abnormalities such as [[Down syndrome|Down's syndrome]] and [[Edwards syndrome]] (which is itself often associated with GI abnormalities)
*Skeletal dysplasia, or dwarfism. There is a possibility of the chest cavity not being large enough to house all of the baby's organs causing the trachea and esophagus to be restricted, not allowing the baby to swallow the appropriate amount of amniotic fluid.

It can also be caused by intrauterine infection ([[TORCH complex|TORCH]])

In a multiple gestation pregnancy, the cause of polyhydramnios usually is [[Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome|twin-twin transfusion syndrome]].

Other maternal causes include [[cardiac]] or [[kidney]] problems. Additionally, [[angioma|chorioangioma of the placenta]] can also cause this condition.

A recent study distinguishes between mild and severe polyhydramnios and showed that Apgar score of less than 7, perinatal death and structural malformations only occurred in women with severe polyhydramnios.<ref>Bundgaard A, Andersen BR, Rode L, Lebech M, Tabor A, Prevalence of polyhydramnios at a Danish hospital--a population-based study. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2007 ; 86(12): 1427-31.</ref> 
In another study, all patients with polyhydramnios, that had a sonographically normal fetus, showed no chromosomal anomalies.<ref name="Barnhard" />

==Diagnosis==
There are several pathologic conditions that can predispose a pregnancy to polyhydramnios. These include a maternal history of [[diabetes mellitus]], [[Rh incompatibility]] between the fetus and mother, intrauterine infection, and [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancies]].

During the pregnancy, certain clinical signs may suggest polyhydramnios. In the mother, the physician may observe increased abdominal size out of proportion for her weight gain and gestation age, uterine size that outpaces gestational age, shiny skin with stria (seen mostly in severe polyhydramnios), dyspnea, and chest heaviness. When examining the fetus, faint fetal heart sounds are also an important clinical sign of this condition.

==Associated conditions==
Fetuses with polyhydramnios are at risk for a number of other problems including [[cord prolapse]], [[placental abruption]], premature birth and perinatal death. At delivery the baby should be checked for congenital abnormalities.

==Treatment==
* Mild asymptomatic polyhydramnios is managed expectantly. For a woman with symptomatic polyhydramnios may need hospital admission. [[Antacids]] may be prescribed to relieve heartburn and [[nausea]].
* No data support dietary restriction of salt and fluid.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* In some cases, [[amnioreduction]], also known as therapeutic [[Amniocentesis]], has been used in response to polyhydramnios.<ref name="pmid15301292">{{cite journal |author=Piantelli G, Bedocchi L, Cavicchioni O, ''et al.'' |title=Amnioreduction for treatment of severe polyhydramnios |series=75 |journal=Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis |volume=Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=56–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15301292 |doi=}}</ref>
