His involvement as a director of Telectronics ceased in about 1982 when control of the company was gained by [[Nucleus Limited|Nucleus]].<br> Subsequently, while continuing involvement in bio-engineering particularly in paediatrics, he studied aerodynamics and structural engineering which led to construction of a fuel efficient light aircraft which was awarded the SAAA prize of the "[[Henry Millicer]] Best Australian Technical Innovation and Design" in 1998.
