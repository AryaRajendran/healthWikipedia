'''Choanal atresia''' is a [[congenital disorder]] where the back of the nasal passage ([[choana]]) is blocked, usually by abnormal [[bone|bony]] or soft tissue formed during fetal development.

==Presentation==
It can be [[unilateral]] or bilateral. 

* Sometimes, a unilateral choanal atresia is not detected until much later in life because the baby manages to get along with only one nostril available for breathing.

* Bilateral choanal atresia is a very serious life-threatening condition because the [[infant|baby]] will then be unable to breathe directly after [[childbirth|birth]] as babies are [[obligate nasal breathing|obligate nasal breathers]] (they '''must''' use their noses to breathe).  In some cases, this may present as [[cyanosis]] while the baby is feeding, because the oral air passages are blocked by the tongue, further restricting the airway.  The cyanosis may improve when the baby cries, as the oral airway is used at this time.  These babies may require airway [[resuscitation]] soon after birth.

==Associated conditions==
Sometimes babies born with choanal atresia also have other abnormalities:
*[[coloboma]]
*[[heart defects]]
*[[mental retardation]]
*growth impairment
*others (see also [[CHARGE syndrome]])

Also any condition that causes significant depression of the nasal bridge or midface retraction can be associated with choanal atresia.  Examples include the [[craniosynostosis]] syndromes such as [[Crouzon syndrome]], [[Pfeiffer syndrome]], and [[Antley-Bixler syndrome]].

==Diagnosis==
Choanal atresia can be suspected if it is impossible to insert a nasal [[catheter]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002608/ Choanal atresia - PubMed Health<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Also, if one notices a continuous stream of mucous draining from one or both nostrils, it could be a sign of an atresia. Another common sign is cyanosis in an infant while breast feeding, as breathing is dependent on nasal patency in this situation.<ref name=autogenerated1 />
Diagnosis is confirmed by [[radiology|radiological]] imaging, usually [[CT scan]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Risk factors==

Very few risk factors for choanal atresia have been identified.  While causes are unknown, both genetic and environmental triggers are suspected.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002608/ Choanol atresia], NIH PubMed Health, August 2011.</ref> One study suggests that chemicals that act as [[endocrine disrupters]] may put an unborn infant at risk.  A 2012 [[Epidemiological_study#Types_of_studies|epidemiological study]] looked at [[atrazine]], a commonly used herbicide in the U.S., and found that women who lived in counties in [[Texas]] with the highest levels of this chemical being used to treat agricultural crops were 80 times more likely to give birth to infants with choanal atresia or stenosis compared to women who lived in the counties with the lowest levels.<ref>[http://www.bcm.edu/news/item.cfm?newsID=6287 Study: Exposure to herbicide may increase risk of rare disorder - Baylor College of Medicine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Another epidemiological report in 2010 found even higher associations between increased incidents of choanal atresia and exposure to second-hand-smoke, coffee consumption, high maternal zinc and B-12 intake and exposure to anti-infective urinary tract medications.<ref>[http://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/829 Epidemiology of choanal atresia - the National Birth Defects Prevention Study], Vijaya Kancherla, University of Iowa,

==Treatment==
Temporary alleviation can be achieved by inserting an oral airway into the mouth.  However, the only definitive treatment is surgery to correct the defect by perforating the atresia to create a nasopharyngeal airway. If the blockage is caused by bone, this is drilled through and  stent inserted. The patient has to have this sucked out by an air vacuum machine . And in later life as a teenager or in early twenties the hole will have to be re-drilled larger. 

A stent may be inserted<ref name="pmid9466228">{{cite journal |author=Sadek SA |title=Congenital bilateral choanal atresia |journal=Int. J. Pediatr.
