[[Blood transfusion]] was first performed in [[Sri Lanka]] in late 1950.<ref name=Source>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodbanksrilanka.com/|title=History of Blood Transfusion Service in Sri Lanka|publisher=National Blood Transfusion Service of Sri Lanka|year=2010|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> It became more widely known to the public in 1959 after the assassination of [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]] [[S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]], when an appeal was made to the public to [[blood donation|donate blood]].<ref name=Source/> Initially, there was only one [[blood bank]] in Sri Lanka, confined to a room close to the surgical unit of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL).<ref name=Source/>

==History==
In 1960, the NHSL blood bank was shifted to its current building, near the hospital's main entrance. In 1967, a "red donor booklet" was introduced as a certificate for free blood donors. Other donors were paid a minimum of 10 [[Sri Lankan rupee|rupees]] for each donation.<ref name=Source/> In 1968, the blood bank was semi-decentralized under the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health and placed under the direction of a superintendent blood transfusion service. It had a staff of 124.<ref name=Source/> During this era, blood was collected into glass bottles and collected blood was [[screening (medicine)|screened]] only for [[malaria]] and [[syphilis]]. Hospital-based blood banks started operations in late 1968.

In 1979, paid donation was discontinued and voluntary donation was encouraged to ensure the safety of collected blood. In 1980, the number of hospital-based blood banks reached 20, and 12 emergency bleeding centres were also established. Mobile blood donation programs were initiated with two mobile blood collection teams.<ref name=Source/> In 1981, the NHSL's blood bank (then referred to as the Central Blood Bank) started to use disposable plastic bags instead of glass bottles for blood collection. A component laboratory was established in the Central Blood Bank.

By 1982, volunteer non-remunerated blood donations accounted for 97% of all transfusions, and the "Anti A1" [[reagent]] was manufactured for the first time in Sri Lanka using [[Horse gram|kollu seeds]].<ref name=Source/> In 1985, disposable plastic bags were introduced to all Sri Lankan blood banks. Screening of blood for [[hepatitis B]] was initiated. In 1987, the emergence of [[AIDS]] led to the introduction of screening of all collected blood for [[HIV]] 1 and 2 antibodies. In 1988, the Central Blood Bank's component laboratory facility was extended to some of the larger blood banks ([[Colombo]] North and [[Kandy]]).<ref name=Source/>

In 1990, the component laboratory facility was further extended to blood banks at [[Karapitiya]], [[Kurunegala]], CI [[Maharagama]], [[Peradeniya]], [[Anuradhapura]], [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]] and [[Badulla]]. By this time there were 32 blood banks and 10 emergency bleeding centres.<ref name=Source/> The Central Blood Bank functioned as the training centre for medical and paramedical personnel of the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS). In 1999, the headquarters of the NBTS were established at the National Blood Centre, absorbing most of the vital laboratories and the majority of the staff from the Central Blood Bank. The NBTS thus became a fully [[decentralized]] unit.<ref name=Source/>

In 2009, a cluster centre concept was established, and more authority was given to these cluster centres for effective delivery of service to various parts of the country.<ref name=Source/> In 2012, the [[Anura Bandaranaike]] Memorial Blood Bank was opened in Wathupitiwela.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=47233|title=Opening of Anura B ward and blood bank|publisher=TheIsland.lk|date=11 March 2012|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>
