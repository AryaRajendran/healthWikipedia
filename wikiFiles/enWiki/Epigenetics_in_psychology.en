== Background ==
=== History ===
:''For more details on this topic, see [[Epigenetics#Etymology_and_definitions|Epigenetic etymology and definitions]].''

British biologist [[Conrad Hal Waddington|Conrad Waddington]] is credited with developing the term ''epigenetics'' in 1947.<ref name="Wong_2011"/> ''Epi'' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] term meaning ''upon'' or ''above''. Hence, epigenetics reflects the effects that take place ''upon'', ''above''<ref name="Bagot_2010">{{cite journal | author = Bagot RC, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetics and the biological basis of gene x environment interactions | journal = J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry | volume = 49 | issue = 8 | pages = 752–71 | year = 2010 | month = August | pmid = 20643310 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaac.2010.06.001 }}</ref> or ''in addition to'' genetics.<ref name="Champagne" /><ref name=Jablonka>{{cite journal | author = Jablonka E, Lamb MJ | title = The changing concept of epigenetics | journal = Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. | volume = 981 | issue = | pages = 82–96 | year = 2002 | month = December | pmid = 12547675 | doi =  10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04913.x}}</ref>  This original definition implied that something aside from genes was involved in defining the phenotype.  When Waddington created the term epigenetics, little was known about the expression of genes. Waddington and others eventually realized that development involved networks of interactions between genes. By the 1990s, Hall wrote that epigenetics involves genetic and non-genetic factors that affect [[gene expression]]. Hall further noted that the code of heredity includes an extra layer in addition to [[DNA]].<ref name=Jablonka /> By the 2000s, ''epigenetics'' was used to describe how experiences shape heritable genetic expression.<ref name="Campbell_2011" /> Psychosocial and environmental factors have been shown to alter these epigenetic mechanisms which, in turn, influence normal and abnormal psychology.<ref name=Masterpasqua /> The current definition still maintains its continuity to Waddington’s, as ''epigenetics'' is used to explain how genes and the environment work in tandem.<ref name=Jablonka /> As such, epigenetic changes do not alter or mutate the DNA. Instead, epigenetic mechanisms affect DNA by ''regulating'' the expression of [[genes]].<ref name="isbn0-553-59226-2">{{cite book | author = Urdang, Laurence | title = The Bantam Medical Dictionary, Sixth Edition | publisher = Bantam | location = London | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 0-553-59226-2 }}</ref> Therefore, due to their regulatory function, epigenetic mechanisms are still considered to occur ''upon'' or ''above'' the DNA,<ref name="Bagot_2010"/> without actually altering it.<ref name="Wong_2011"/>

=== Epigenetic mechanisms ===
{{Main|Epigenetics}}

[[Image:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb|Modifications of the [[epigenome]] do not alter DNA.]]

Genes can be likened to books, categorized and arranged, in a library. The books contain enormous amounts of accessible information that can be utilized in an infinite number of ways. Therefore, books are similar to DNA in that both are “waiting to be read.” <ref name="Champagne" />{{rp|128}} In a library, many factors may contribute to whether a book will be read. If a book is difficult to reach or is hidden from view, it may not be read. Like an unread gene, an obstructed book is not altered or discarded. Both are still present, but if they are not accessible, neither the gene nor the book can be read.<ref name="Champagne" /> In this manner, epigenetics can silence a gene.<ref name="Bell_2011">{{cite journal | author = Bell JT, Spector TD | title = A twin approach to unraveling epigenetics | journal = Trends Genet. | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 116–25 | year = 2011 | month = March | pmid = 21257220 | pmc = 3063335 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.12.005 }}</ref>

=== Epigenetics across the life-span ===
Epigenetic changes occur not only in the developing fetus, but also in individuals throughout the human life-span.<ref name="Campbell_2011"/> Epigenetic changes occur cumulatively over the life-span as evidenced by: (i) increased levels of epigenetic changes in older [[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|monozygotic (identical) twins]] compared to younger twins; and, (ii) identical twins who become more epigenetically dissimilar as they age.<ref name="pmid16009939">{{cite journal | author = Fraga MF, Ballestar E, Paz MF, Ropero S, Setien F, Ballestar ML, Heine-Suñer D, Cigudosa JC, Urioste M, Benitez J, Boix-Chornet M, Sanchez-Aguilera A, Ling C, Carlsson E, Poulsen P, Vaag A, Stephan Z, Spector TD, Wu YZ, Plass C, Esteller M | title = Epigenetic differences arise during the lifetime of monozygotic twins | journal = Proc.

=== Comparison with evolution ===
According to [[On the Origin of Species|Darwin’s classic theory of evolution]], several generations are required for [[adaptation]] to occur. Also known as [[natural selection]], this process contributes to humans' (and other species') ability to survive and reproduce in their particular environments. Adaptation may occur through physiological, structural (anatomical) and/or behavioural changes. In the context of natural selection and psychology, more successful (i.e., better adapted) traits and behaviours are more likely to be passed down from an individual to subsequent generations.<ref name="isbn0-205-83256-3">{{cite book | author =Pinel J | title = Biopsychology (8th Edition) | edition = | language = | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J | year = 2010 | isbn = 0-205-83256-3 }}</ref>  Thus, most [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] agree that modern human traits and behaviours can be characterized as beneficial adaptations to the [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment]].<ref name="isbn0-13-255770-3"/> However, other theorists argue that some traits are maladaptive.<ref name="Keller and Miller, 2006">{{cite journal | author = Keller MC, Miller G | title = Resolving the paradox of common, harmful, heritable mental disorders: which evolutionary genetic models work best? | journal = Behav Brain Sci | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–404; discussion 405–52 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 17094843 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X06009095 | url = }}</ref> Not to be confused with evolution, epigenetics provides a mechanism for immediate adaptations to ever-changing environments<ref name="Campbell_2011"/><ref name="pmid20535202">{{cite journal | author = Dulac C | title = Brain function and chromatin plasticity | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7299 | pages = 728–35 | year = 2010 | month = June | pmid = 20535202 | pmc = 3075582 | doi = 10.1038/nature09231 }}</ref> throughout the human life-span.<ref name="Campbell_2011"/>

Individual diversity, stemming from epigenetic differentiation, cannot be attributed to random mutations. Therefore, one view suggests that epigenetics is inconsistent with Darwinian theory of evolution’s concept of random mutations resulting in diversity.<ref name="Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky" /> Although [[Lamarckism]] is not appropriate to explain evolution, it might offer insight into epigenetic-related individuation. For example, [[evolutionary developmental biology]] accounts for epigenetic and pseudo-Lamarckian mechanisms whereby environmentally induced variation is inherited.<ref name="Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky">{{cite book | editor = Bronner F, Helmtrud I | title = Epigenetic Aspects of Chronic Diseases | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2011 | isbn = 1-84882-643-5 | author = Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky H, Glatt SJ, Tsuang MT | chapter = Epigenetics in Psychiatry | pages = 163–174 }}</ref><ref name="kirschner and gerhart">{{cite book | title=The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin's Dilemma | publisher=Yale University Press | author=Kirschner, M.

In this context, heritable epigenetic differences are viewed as part of long-term development, whereby the number of generations through which epigenetic modifications traverse is dependent on the duration of the influence on the genes.<ref name="pmid12547675">{{cite journal | author = Jablonka E, Lamb MJ | title = The changing concept of epigenetics | journal = Ann.

[[Image:TwinGirls.jpg|right|thumb|[[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|Monozygotic twins]] are identical twins. [[Twin studies]] help to reveal epigenetic differences related to various aspects of psychology.]]
Epigenetic differences have been linked to differences in risk-taking and reactions to stress. Specifically, epigenetic differentiation in [[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|monozygotic twins]] has been shown to play a role in individual differences in:
* risk-taking that is characterized by impulsive or disinhibited decision making.<ref name="Kaminsky_2008">{{cite journal | author = Kaminsky Z, Petronis A, Wang SC, Levine B, Ghaffar O, Floden D, Feinstein A | title = Epigenetics of personality traits: an illustrative study of identical twins discordant for risk-taking behavior | journal = Twin Res Hum Genet | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | year = 2008 | month = February | pmid = 18251670 | doi = 10.1375/twin.11.1.1 | url = }}</ref>

Epigenetic variations, associated with risk-taking behaviours and anxiety, have been linked to individual differences in lifestyle and career choices. In one study, each member of a pair of twins had chosen two very different life paths. One twin, who displayed high-risk behaviours (like gambling), chose a dangerous and high-sensation career as a war journalist. Despite the dangerous profession, this twin showed no elevated anxiety levels when confronted with stress. This twin married late in life (to an individual who also chose a dangerous profession), had no children, and consumed more alcohol than is considered medically healthy. In contrast, the other twin was considered to be a polar opposite. The second twin was prone to anxiety and developing somatic complaints when faced with stress.<ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/> Instead of displaying risk-taking behaviours, the second twin displayed risk-averse behaviours. The second twin chose a safe and predictable career as a manager in a law firm, married a lawyer, had children at a young age and had only traveled out of country once (to another English-speaking country).<ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/>

In this twin study, epigenetic differences in [[DNA methylation]] of the [[CpG island]]s proximal to the [[DLX1]] gene have been implicated as affecting risk-taking behaviours and coping with stress in terms of anxiety.<ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/> DLX1 exerts its effects by helping to regulate the production of the neurotransmitter GABA ([[gamma-aminobutyric acid]]), and the hormone [[neuropeptide Y]].

The researchers of the above twin study noted that despite the associations between epigenetic markers for individual differences in personality traits and behaviours that might influence occupational choices, epigenetics cannot on their own predict complex decision-making processes like career selection.

=== Stress ===
[[Image:Basic HPA Axis.jpeg|right|thumb|The [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis]] is involved in the [[Stress (biology)|human stress response]].]]
The early parental care-giving environment has long been a central focus of human psychological development.

Specifically, the effects of maternal care in terms of the parental licking-grooming of offspring were examined. High licking-grooming resulted in a positive, long-term effect on the reactivity of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) as evidenced by decreased [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and [[corticosterone]] in response to stress in offspring. The effects of parental care on the HPA and ACTH resulted from epigenetic changes, whereby high licking-grooming led to decreased DNA methylation. In turn, decreased methylation allowed for increased access to the [[hippocampal]] [[glucocorticoid receptor]] genes in the offspring.<ref name="Szyf and McGowan" /> Increased expression of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors causes the hippocampus to release less ACTH-releasing hormone, which acts on the [[pituitary gland]] to release less ACTH. In turn, a decrease in ACTH results in the [[adrenal glands]] releasing less [[cortisol]]. In contrast, less parental care (low licking-grooming) ultimately results in increased cortisol release.<ref name=Masterpasqua /> The release of increased cortisol, via the HPA axis, as a reaction to psychological stress is well-established.<ref name=Guyton /><ref name=McCance>{{cite book | author = Parkinson CF, McCance KL, Huether SE | title = Pathophysiology : The Biologic Basis for Disease in Adults and Children (Study Guide & Workbook) | publisher = Mosby Elsevier Health Science | location = St. Louis, USA | year = 1997 | pages = | isbn = 0-8151-3766-4  }}</ref> Therefore, pups that received less licking-grooming were more prone to react to stress.<ref name=Masterpasqua /> Since humans also show the same cortisol response to stress and heritable cortisol levels,<ref name=McCaffery>{{cite book | author = Baum A, Contrada RJ | title = The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health | publisher = Springer Publishing Company | location = New York | year = 2010 | pages = 77–100 | isbn = 0-8261-1471-7  }}</ref> the animal models have implications for humans.<ref name="Szyf and McGowan" />

Research has demonstrated that the maternal [[genotype]] did not determine stress reactions in offspring. Instead, the early parental care environment affected genetic expression to influence how offspring react to stress.  When rat offspring were removed from their low licking-grooming mothers and placed with high licking-grooming mothers, the epigenetic changes related to an increased stress response were reversed. The reverse was observed when pups were removed from their high licking-grooming parents and placed with low licking-grooming mothers.

Pharmacological research has also demonstrated the reversibility of epigenetic changes related to maternal care in mice. When adult offspring of low licking-grooming mothers were injected with an agent that decreased DNA methylation to match levels of adult pups of high licking-grooming mothers, their responsivity to stress decreased to match the levels seen in the offspring of high licking-grooming mothers.<ref name="Weaver_2004">{{cite journal | author = Weaver IC, Cervoni N, Champagne FA, D'Alessio AC, Sharma S, Seckl JR, Dymov S, Szyf M, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior | journal = Nat.

Stable epigenetic variations in parental care can be passed down from one generation to the next, from mother to female offspring. Female offspring who received increased parental care (i.e., high licking-grooming) became mothers who engaged in high licking-grooming. Conversely, offspring who received less licking-grooming became mothers who engaged in less licking-grooming. Research has also provided a transgenerational epigenetic link related to maternal care. To this end, offspring of mothers with high licking-grooming behaviour evidenced DNA methylation-related increased expression of an [[estrogen receptor]] gene in the medial [[Preoptic area|preoptic region]] of the hypothalamus – an area of the brain known to be linked to maternal nurturing and care.<ref name="Champagne et al, 2006">{{cite journal | author = Champagne FA, Weaver IC, Diorio J, Dymov S, Szyf M, Meaney MJ | title = Maternal care associated with methylation of the estrogen receptor-alpha1b promoter and estrogen receptor-alpha expression in the medial preoptic area of female offspring | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 147 | issue = 6 | pages = 2909–15 | year = 2006 | month = June | pmid = 16513834 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-1119 }}</ref> 

In humans, the relationship between prenatal exposure to maternal [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and genetic expression resulting in increased reactivity to stress in offspring has been shown. Three groups of infants were examined: those born to mothers medicated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] with [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|serotonin reuptake inhibitors]]; those born to depressed mothers not being treated for depression; and those born to non-depressed mothers. Prenatal exposure to depressed/anxious mood was associated with increased epigenetic changes in terms of increased DNA methylation at the glucorticoid receptor gene. In turn, this was related to increased HPA axis stress reactivity - as measured by increased salivary cortisol in three month old infants.<ref name="Oberlander_2008">{{cite journal | author = Oberlander TF, Weinberg J, Papsdorf M, Grunau R, Misri S, Devlin AM | title = Prenatal exposure to maternal depression, neonatal methylation of human glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and infant cortisol stress responses | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–106 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18536531 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Increased cortisol levels are associated with increased stress.<ref name=McCance /> The findings were independent of whether the mothers were being pharmaceutically treated for depression.<ref name="Oberlander_2008"/>

Specifically, mice with brain damage were subjected to a fear paradigm that consisted of a single exposure to a conditioning context followed by an electric foot shock that elicited a freezing (i.e., staying still) response. After training, the mice rested for four weeks in order to develop long-term memories. Mice were then housed in regular animal cages or in enriched environments for ten weeks. The enriched environments consisted of cages with running wheels, play tunnels, and climbing apparatuses. When re-exposed to the conditioned context, mice housed in regular cages displayed impaired freezing responses. Conversely, the environmentally-enriched mice displayed the freezing behaviour, indicating a recovery of long-term memories.<ref name="Fischer and Tsai" /> 

Other memory-related research has yielded similar results. For example, when  placed in a tub of water, brain-damaged mice learned to swim to a platform to escape from the water in the [[Morris water navigation task]]. After training, the brain-damaged mice that had resided in regular cages could no longer swim directly to the platform. However, brain-damaged mice that had resided in enriched environments remembered where the platform was located and swam to it – indicating a recovery of long-term memories. The environmental enrichment induced epigenetic changes in the hippocampus and cortex regions (via [[Histone acetylation and deacetylation|histone acetylation]]) of the brain. Injection of [[histone deacetylase inhibitor]] was shown to increase hippocampal acetylation and mimic the effects of environmental enrichment in brain-damaged mice by reinstating learning and long-term memory loss. The latter was assessed by the freezing-fear response and performance on the [[Morris water navigation task|Morris water maze]]. These findings are consistent with human studies that have noted cognitive fluctuations like temporary periods of clear memories in individuals with [[dementia]].<ref name="Fischer and Tsai" /> Research has also linked learning and long-term memory formation to reversible epigenetic changes in the hippocampus and cortex in animals with normal-functioning, non-damaged brains.<ref name="Miller_2010" /><ref name=Gupat>{{cite journal | author = Gupta S, Kim SY, Artis S, Molfese DL, Schumacher A, Sweatt JD, Paylor RE, Lubin FD | title = Histone methylation regulates memory formation | journal = J.

=== Eating disorders and obesity ===

Epigenetics help to facilitate the development and maintenance of [[eating disorder]]s via influences in the early environment and throughout the life-span.<ref name="Campbell_2011"/> [[Pre-natal]] epigenetic changes due to maternal stress, behaviour and diet may later predispose offspring to persistent, increased anxiety and [[anxiety disorders]].

Epigenetic differences accumulating over the life-span may account for the incongruent differences in eating disorders observed in monozygotic twins. At [[puberty]], [[sex hormones]] may exert epigenetic changes (via DNA methylation) on gene expression, thus accounting for higher rates of eating disorders in men as compared to women.

Limited access to human brain tissue poses a challenge to conducting human research.<ref name="Powledge_2011" /> Not yet knowing if epigenetic changes in the blood and (non-brain) tissues parallel modifications in the brain, places even greater reliance on brain research.<ref name="Albert_2010"/> Although some epigenetic studies have translated findings from animals to humans,<ref name="McGowan_2009">{{cite journal | author = McGowan PO, Sasaki A, D'Alessio AC, Dymov S, Labonté B, Szyf M, Turecki G, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetic regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor in human brain associates with childhood abuse | journal = Nat.

Some researchers note that epigenetic perspectives will likely be incorporated into pharmacological treatments.<ref name="pmid18197504" /> Others caution that more research is necessary as drugs are known to modify the activity of multiple genes and may, therefore, cause serious side effects.<ref name="Miller_2010" /> However, the ultimate goal is to find patterns of epigenetic changes that can be targeted to treat mental illness, and reverse the effects of childhood stressors, for example. If such treatable patterns eventually become well-established, the inability to access brains in living humans to identify them poses an obstacle to pharmacological treatment.<ref name="Albert_2010"/> Future research may also focus on epigenetic changes that mediate the impact of psychotherapy on personality and behaviour.<ref name=Masterpasqua /> 

Most epigenetic research is cross-sectional in that  it establishes associations. More longitudinal research is necessary to help establish causation.<ref name="pmid21908516">{{cite journal | author = Dempster EL, Pidsley R, Schalkwyk LC, Owens S, Georgiades A, Kane F, Kalidindi S, Picchioni M, Kravariti E, Toulopoulou T, Murray RM, Mill J | title = Disease-associated epigenetic changes in monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder | journal = Hum.
