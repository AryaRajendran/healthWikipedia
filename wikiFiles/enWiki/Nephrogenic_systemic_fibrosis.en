'''Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis''' ('''NSF''') or '''nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy''' is a rare and serious [[syndrome]] that involves [[fibrosis]] of skin, joints, eyes, and internal organs. The first cases were identified in 1997 and its cause is not fully understood. However, there is much evidence to suggest that it is associated with exposure to [[gadolinium]] (with [[gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent]]s being frequently used as contrast agents for [[magnetic resonance imaging]]) in patients with severe [[renal failure|kidney failure]].<ref>Thomsen HS. (2009) Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: history and epidemiology'' Radiol Clin North  Am.'' '''47'''(5):827-31</ref> Epidemiological studies suggest that the incidence of NSF is unrelated to gender, race, or age and it is not thought to have a genetic basis. A registry for NSF has identified about 335 cases as of 2011.<ref>[http://www.icnsfr.org/ The NSF registy site].</ref>

Most patients with NSF have undergone [[hemodialysis]] for renal failure, some have never undergone dialysis and others have received only [[peritoneal dialysis]]. Many patients have taken [[immunosuppressant|immunosuppressive]] medications and have other diseases, such as [[hepatitis C]]. Four of the seven gadolinium contrast agents approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] have been principally implicated in NSF, including [[Omniscan]], [[MultiHance]], [[Magnevist]], and [[Gadoversetamide|OptiMARK]].

==Systemic symptoms==

In NSF, patients develop large areas of hardened skin with fibrotic nodules and plaques. NSF may also cause joint contractures resulting in joint pain and limitation in range of motion. In its most severe form, NSF may cause severe systemic fibrosis affecting internal organs including the lungs, heart and liver.<ref>Kucher C, Steere, J, Elenitsas, R, Siegel, DL, Xu, X.

==Microscopic pathology==

At the microscopic level, NSF resembles [[scleromyxedema]]. Both conditions show a proliferation of dermal [[fibroblast]]s and [[dendritic cells]], thickened [[collagen]] bundles, increased [[elastic fiber]]s, and deposits of [[mucin]].<ref>Scheinfeld, NS; Cowper, S; Kovarik, CL; Butler, DF.

==Classification of gadolinium contrast agents as to risk==

The [[European Medicines Agency]] has classified the gadolinium-containing contrast agents into three risk groups:<ref>[[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]]. ''Drug Safety Update'', August 2007 pg 2-4. [http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=35149 Link] (121 KB)</ref>
*Least likely (safest) to release free gadolinium [[ion]]s Gd(III) (also written Gd<sup>3+</sub>) in the body have a cyclical [[Molecular geometry|structure]]: [[Dotarem]], [[Gadovist]] and [[ProHance]]
*Intermediate have an ionic linear structure: [[Magnevist]], [[MultiHance]], [[Primovist]] (''Eovist'' in the U.S.) and [[Vasovist]]
*Most likely to release Gd (III) have a linear non-ionic structure: [[Omniscan]] and [[OptiMARK]]

The suitability of gadolinium complexes as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents depends on a number of factors. A thermodynamic relationship to toxicity exists if one assumes that the chemotoxicity of the intact complex is minimal but that the toxicity of the components of the complex (free metal and uncomplexed ligands) is substantial. 

Release of Gd(III) from the complex is responsible for the toxicity associated with gadolinium complexes; this release appears to be a consequence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transmetallation in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by acute toxicity experiments, which demonstrate that despite a 50-fold range of LDse values for four Gd(III) complexes, all become lethally toxic when they release precisely the same quantity of Gd(III). It is also supported by subchronic rodent toxicity experiments, which demonstrate a set of gross and microscopic findings similar to those known to be caused by Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency. Finally, this hypothesis predicts that subtle changes in formulation can further enhance the intrinsic safety of these complexes. The added Ca<sup>2+</sup> salt of the ligand must have a favorable toxicity so that the decrease in toxicity from in vivo transmetallation is not offset, or overcome, by the addition of a toxic component to the formulation.<ref>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THERMODYNAMICS AND THE TOXICITY OF GADOLINIUM COMPLEXES: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Vol. 8 pp. 467-468, 1990, ftp://124.42.15.59/ck/2011-01/165/060/614/791/The%20relationship%20between%20thermodynamics%20and%20the%20toxicity%20of%20gadolinium%20complexes..pdf</ref>

==Relation to acute kidney injury==
NSF has also developed in patients with acute kidney injury [14], even if renal function subsequently returned to normal following GBCM administration [15]. In one series, up to 20% of NSF cases were diagnosed in patients who had been in some element of transient acute renal failure (often, but not always, superimposed upon chronic kidney disease) at the time of GBCM administration [16].<ref>Revision performed with input from and approval of the ACR Subcommittee on MR Safety, Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis, http://www.acr.org/SecondaryMainMenuCategories/quality_safety/contrast_manual/NephrogenicSystemicFibrosis.aspx</ref>

It can be noted that this classification was released after another proposition would have left the safest category (ionic cyclical structure) with only one agent (''Dotarem'', not sold in North America). The intermediate category would have been both ionic linear structure and non-ionic cyclical structure. The third category most at risk was unchanged (linear non-ionic).<ref>http://www.ismrm.org/special/EMEA2.pdf</ref>
