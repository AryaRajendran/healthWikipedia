Spaceflight induced [[Visual impairment]] is hypothesized to be a result of increased [[intracranial pressure]].  The study of visual changes and [[Intracranial pressure|intracranial pressure (ICP)]] in astronauts on long-duration flights is a relatively recent topic of interest to Space Medicine professionals.  Although reported signs and symptoms have not appeared to be severe enough to cause blindness in the near term, long term consequences of chronically elevated intracranial pressure is unknown.<ref name=5-5 />

NASA has reported that fifteen long-duration male astronauts (45–55 years of age) have experienced confirmed visual and anatomical changes during or after long-duration flights.<ref name="Evidence Report">{{cite journal|last=Otto|first=C.|coauthors=Alexander, DJ; Gibson, CR; Hamilton, DR; Lee, SMC; Mader, TH; Oubre, CM; Pass, AF; Platts, SH; Scott, JM; Smith, SM; Stenger, MB; Westby, CM; Zanello, SB|title=Evidence Report: Risk of spaceflight-induced intracranial hypertension and vision alterations|journal=Human Research Program: Human Health Countermeasures Element|date=12|year=2012|month=July|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/Evidence/reports/VIIP.pdf}}</ref>  [http://cms.revoptom.com/handbook/sect6b.htm Optic disc edema], globe flattening, [http://dro.hs.columbia.edu/chorfolds.htm choroidal folds], [http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/hyperopic-shift hyperopic shifts] and an increased intracranial pressure have been documented in these astronauts.

Although the exact cause is not known at this time, it is suspected that microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift and comparable physiological changes play a significant role in these changes.<ref name=17-17 />  Other contributing factors may include pockets of increased CO<sub>2</sub> and an increase in sodium intake.  It seems unlikely that resistive or aerobic exercise are contributing factors, but they may be potential countermeasures to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) or intracranial pressure (ICP) in-flight.<ref name="Evidence Report" />

==Causes and current studies==
Although a definitive cause (or set of causes) for the symptoms outlined in the [[VIIP#Existing_Long-Duration_Flight_Occurrences|Existing Long-Duration Flight Occurrences]] section is unknown, it is thought that venous congestion in the brain brought about by cephalad-fluid shifts may be a unifying pathologic mechanism. As part of the effort to elucidate the cause(s), NASA has initiated an enhanced occupational monitoring program for all mission astronauts with special attention to signs and symptoms related to ICP.

Similar findings have been reported among Russian Cosmonauts who flew long-duration missions on MIR.  The findings were published by Mayasnikov and Stepanova in 2008.<ref name="Mayasnikov and Stepanova (11)">{{cite journal|last=Mayasnikov|first=VI|coauthors=Stepanova, SI|title=Features of cerebral hemodynamics in cosmonauts before and after flight on the MIR Orbital Station|journal=Orbital Station MIR|year=2008|volume=2|pages=300–305|publisher=Institute of Biomedical Problems: State Scientific Center of Russian Federation}}</ref>

===CO<sub>2</sub>===
[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a natural product of metabolism.  People typically exhale around 200mL of CO<sub>2</sub> per minute at rest and over 4.0 L at peak exercise levels.<ref name="Williams (216)">{{cite web|last=Williams|first=WJ|title=Physiological responses to oxygen and carbon dioxide in the breathing environment|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/resources/certpgmspt/meetings/09172009/pdfs/9CO202PresentWJW.pdf|work=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Public Meeting slides|location=Pittsburgh, PA|year=2009}}</ref>  In a closed environment, CO<sub>2</sub> levels can quickly rise and can be expected to a certain degree in an environment such as the ISS.

Ventilation and heart rate increase as CO<sub>2</sub> rise.  [[Hypercapnia]] also stimulates [[vasodilation]] of cerebral blood vessels, increased cerebral blood flow and elevated ICP presumably leading to headache, visual disturbance and other central nervous system (CNS) symptoms.  CO<sub>2</sub> is a known potent vasodilator and an increase in cerebral perfusion pressure will increase the CSF fluid production by about 4%.<ref name="Ainslie (217)">{{cite journal|last=Ainslie|first=PN|coauthors=Duffin, J|title=Integration of cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity and chemoreflex control of breathing: mechanisms of regulation, measurement, and interpretation.|journal=American journal of physiology.

Since air movement is reduced in microgravity, local pockets of increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may form.

===Sodium Intake===
A link between increased ICP and altered sodium and water retention was suggested by a report in which 77% of [[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension|IIH]] patients had evidence of [[peripheral edema]] and 80% with orthostatic retention of sodium and water.<ref name="Smith (222)">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=SM|coauthors=Zwart, SR|title=Nutritional biochemistry of spaceflight.|journal=Advances in clinical chemistry|year=2008|volume=46|pages=87–130|pmid=19004188|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065242308004034|doi=10.1016/S0065-2423(08)00403-4}}</ref>  Impaired saline and water load excretions were noted in the upright position in IIH patients with orthostatic edema compared to lean and obese controls without IIH.  However, the precise mechanisms linking orthostatic changes to IIH were not defined, and many IH patients do not have these sodium and water abnormalities.  Astronauts are well known to have orthostatic intolerance upon reentry to gravity after long-duration spaceflight, and the dietary sodium on orbit is also known to be in excess of 5 grams per day in some cases.  The Majority of the NASA cases did have high dietary sodium during their increment.  The ISS program is working to decrease in-flight dietary sodium intake to less than 3 grams per day.<ref name="Smith (222)" />

===Exercise===
While exercise is used to maintain muscle, bone and cardiac health during spaceflight, its effects on ICP and IOP have yet to be determined.  The effects of resistive exercise on the development of ICP remains controversial.  An early investigation showed that the brief [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/intrathoracic+pressure intrathoractic pressure] increase during a [[Valsalva maneuver]] resulted in an associated rise in ICP.<ref name="Junqueira (223)">{{cite journal|last=Junqueira, Jr.|first=LF|title=Teaching cardiac autonomic function dynamics employing the Valsalva (Valsalva-Weber) maneuver.|journal=Advances in physiology education|year=2008|month=March|volume=32|issue=1|pages=100–6|pmid=18334576|url=http://sistemas.fcm.uncu.edu.ar/medicina/escuela_ayudantes/archivos/ARTICULOS2008/artic1-grupo2-com1.pdf|doi=10.1152/advan.00057.2007}}</ref>  Two other investigations using transcranial Doppler ultrasound techniques showed that resistive exercise without a Valsalva maneuver resulted in no change in peak systolic pressure or ICP.<ref name="Edwards (224)">{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=MR|coauthors=Martin, DH; Hughson, RL|title=Cerebral hemodynamics and resistance exercise.|journal=Medicine and science in sports and exercise|year=2002|month=July|volume=34|issue=7|pages=1207–11|pmid=12131264}}</ref><ref name="Dickerman (225)">{{cite journal|last=Dickerman|first=RD|coauthors=McConathy, WJ; Smith, GH; East, JW; Rudder, L|title=Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity in elite power athletes during maximal weight-lifting.|journal=Neurological research|year=2000|month=June|volume=22|issue=4|pages=337–40|pmid=10874679|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/94/4/1335.full}}</ref><ref name="Haykowsky (226)">{{cite journal|last=Haykowsky|first=MJ|coauthors=Eves, ND; R Warburton, DE; Findlay, MJ|title=Resistance exercise, the Valsalva maneuver, and cerebrovascular transmural pressure.|journal=Medicine and science in sports and exercise|year=2003|month=January|volume=35|issue=1|pages=65–8|pmid=12544637|doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000043449.65647.C9}}</ref>  The effects of resistive exercise in IOP are less controversial.

===Biomarkers===
Several [[biomarkers]] may be used for early VIIP Syndrome detection.  The following biomarkers were suggested as potential candidates by the 2010 Visual Impairment Summit:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure Summit Report|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2011-216160.pdf|publisher=NASA}}</ref>
* [[S-100 protein|S-100]]
* [[Platelet_count#High_and_low_counts|platelet count]]
* [[albumin]]
* [[C-reactive protein|CRP/inflammation markers]]
* [[insulin-like growth factor]]s
* [[somatostatin]]
* tet-transactivator (TTA)
* [[myelin basic protein]]
* immunoglobin G index
* [[oligoclonal band]]s
* [[Atrial natriuretic peptide|atrial naturetic peptide]]
* [[vasopressin]]
* [[aquaporin]]

Also, [[gene expression profiling]], [[epigenetic modifications]], [[CO₂ retention|CO<sub>2</sub> retaining variants]], [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] and [[copy number variants]] should be expanded in order to better characterize the individual susceptibility to develop the VIIP syndrome.  As he etiology of the symptoms is more clearly defined, the appropriate biomarkers will be evaluated.

===One-Carbon Metabolism (Homocysteine)===
While the common theories regarding vision issues during flight focus on cardiovascular factors (fluid shift, intracranial hypertension, CO<sub>2</sub> exposure, etc.), the difficulty comes in trying to explain how on any given mission, breathing the same air and exposed to the same microgravity, why some crewmembers have vision issues while others do not.  Data identified as part of an ongoing nutrition experiment (aka, the [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/Nutrition.html Nutrition SMO]) found biochemical evidence that the folate-dependent [http://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP241 one-carbon metabolic pathway] may be altered in those individuals who have vision issues.  These data have been published<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zwart|first=SR|coauthors=Gibson, CR; Mader, TH; Ericson, K; Ploutz-Snyder, R; Heer, M; Smith, SM|title=Vision changes after spaceflight are related to alterations in folate- and vitamin B-12-dependent one-carbon metabolism.|journal=The Journal of nutrition|date=2012 Mar|volume=142|issue=3|pages=427–31|pmid=22298570|doi=10.3945/jn.111.154245}}</ref>  and  summarized by the ISS Program,<ref>{{cite web|last=Keith|first=L|title=New Findings on Astronaut Vision Loss|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/vision_changes.html|work=International Space Station|publisher=NASA}}</ref> and described in a journal sponsored pubcast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zwart|first=S|title=Vision Changes after Spaceflight Are Related to Alterations in Folate– and Vitamin B-12–Dependent One-Carbon Metabolism|url=http://www.scivee.tv/node/38821|work=SciVee|coauthors=Gibson, CR; Mader, TH; Ericson, K; Ploutz-Snyder, R; Heer, M; Smith, SM}}</ref> 

In brief: serum concentrations of metabolites of the [[folate]], vitamin B-12 dependent one carbon metabolism pathway, specifically, [[homocysteine]], [[cystathionine]], 2-methylcitric acid, and [[methylmalonic acid]] were all significantly (P<0.001) higher (25-45%) in astronauts with ophthalmic changes than in those without such changes. These differences existed before, during, and after flight. Serum folate tended to be lower (P=0.06) in individuals with ophthalmic changes. Preflight serum concentrations of cystathionine and 2-methylcitric acid, and mean in-flight serum folate, were significantly (P<0.05) correlated with changes in refraction (postflight relative to preflight).  

Thus, data from the Nutrition SMO 016E provide evidence for an alternative hypothesis: that individuals with alterations in this metabolic pathway may be predisposed to anatomic and/or physiologic changes that render them susceptible to ophthalmologic damage during space flight.  A follow-up project has been initiated (the "One Carbon" study) to follow up and clarify these preliminary findings.

===Space Obstructive Syndrome===
An anatomic cause of the microgravity related intracranial hypertension and visual disturbances has been proposed and is termed [http://www.SpaceObstructiveSyndrome.com Space Obstructive Syndrome] or SOS. This hypothesis has the possibility of linking the various symptoms and signs together through a common mechanism in a cascade phenomenon, and explaining the findings in one individual and not another due to specific anatomic variations in the structural placement of the internal jugular vein. This hypothesis was presented, (presentation [http://www.spaceobstructivesyndrome.com/ here]), in May 2011 at the annual meeting of the Aerospace Medicine Association in Anchorage, Alaska, and was published in January, 2012.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wiener|first=TC|title=Space obstructive syndrome: intracranial hypertension, intraocular pressure, and papilledema in space|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=2012 Jan|volume=83|issue=1|pages=64–66|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2012/00000083/00000001/art00014|pmid=22272520|doi=10.3357/ASEM.3083.2012}}</ref>

In 1G on earth, the main outflow of blood from the head is due to gravity, rather than a pumping or vacuum mechanism. In a standing position, the main outflow from the head is through the vertebral venous system because the [[internal jugular veins]], located primarily between the [[carotid artery]] and the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]] are partially or completely occluded due to the pressure from these structures, and in a supine position, the main outflow is through the internal jugular veins as they have fallen laterally due to the weight of the contained blood, are no longer compressed and have greatly expanded in diameter, but the smaller vertebral system has lost the gravitational force for blood outflow.  In microgravity, there is no gravity to pull the internal jugular veins out from the zone of compression [http://plasticsurgery-houston.com/sos/img16.html (Wiener classification Zone I)], and there is also no gravitational force to pull blood through the vertebral venous system. In microgravity, the cranial venous system has been put into minimal outflow and maximal obstruction. This then causes a cascade of cranial venous hypertension, which decreases CSF resorption from the [[arachnoid granulations]], leading to [[intracranial hypertension]] and [[papilledema]]. The venous hypertension also contributes to the head swelling seen in photos of astronauts and the nasal and sinus congestion along with headache noted by many. There is also subsequent venous hypertension in the venous system of the eye which may contribute to the findings noted on ophthalmic exam and contributing to the visual disturbances noted. 

The astronauts afflicted with long term visual changes and prolonged intracranial hypertension have all been male, and SOS may explain this because in men, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is typically thicker than in women and may contribute to more compression. The reason that SOS does not occur in all individuals may be related to anatomic variations in the internal jugular vein. Ultrasound study has shown that in some individuals, the internal jugular vein is located in a more lateral position to Zone I compression, and therefore not as much compression will occur, allowing continued blood flow.

==Current ICP  and IOP Measurement==

===ICP Measurement===
[[Intracranial pressure|Intracranial pressure (ICP)]] needs to be directly measured before and after long duration flights to determine if microgravity causes the increased ICP.  On the ground, lumbar puncture is the standard method of measuring cerebral spinal fluid pressure and ICP,<ref name=17-17 /><ref name=2-2>{{cite web|title=The Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure Summit Report|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2011-216160.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=13 June 2012|page=2-2}}</ref> but this carries additional risk in-flight.<ref name=5-5 />  NASA is determining how to correlate ground-based MRI with inflight ultrasound<ref name=5-5>{{cite web|title=The Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure Summit Report|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2011-216160.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=13 June 2012|page=5-5}}</ref> and other methods of measuring ICP in space is currently being investigated.<ref name=2-2 />

To date, NASA has measured [[Intraocular pressure|intraocular pressure (IOP)]], visual acuity, [http://vision.about.com/od/eyeexamequipment/g/Cycloplegic_Refraction.htm cycloplegic refraction], [[Optical coherence tomography|Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)]] and [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1228447-overview A-scan] axial length changes in the eye before and after spaceflight.<ref name=3-3>{{cite web|title=The Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure Summit Report|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2011-216160.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=13 June 2012|page=3-3}}</ref>

====Non-invasive ICP Measurement====

There are different approaches to [[Non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement methods|non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement]], which include ultrasound "time-of-flight" techniques, transcranial Doppler, methods based on acoustic properties of the cranial bones, EEG, MRI, tympanic membrane displacement, oto-acoustic emission, ophthalmodynamometry,  ultrasound measurements of optic nerve sheath diameter, and Two-Depth Transcranial Doppler.

Non-invasive absolute intracranial pressure value meter, based on Two-Depth Transcranial Doppler has been shown to be accurate in clinical settings.  Analysis of the 72 simultaneous paired recordings of non-invasive ICP and the "gold standard" invasive CSF pressure showed good accuracy for the non-invasive method as indicated by the low mean systematic error (0.12 mmHg; confidence level (CL) = 0.98). The method also showed high precision as indicated by the low standard deviation (SD) of the random errors 
(SD = 2.19 mmHg; CL = 0.98).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ragauskas A, Matijosaitis V, Zakelis R, Petrikonis K, Rastenyte D, Piper I, Daubaris G | year = 2012 | month = May | title = Clinical assessment of noninvasive intracranial pressure absolute value measurement method | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 78 | issue = 21| pages = 1684–91 }}</ref> 
This measurement method eliminates the main limiting problem of all other non-successful "correlation based" approaches to non-invasive ICP absolute value measurement - the calibration to the individual patient problem.<ref>News-Medical.net. http://www.news-medical.net/news/20120705/Non-invasive-absolute-intracranial-pressure-value-meter-shown-to-be-accurate-in-clinical-settings.aspx</ref>

===IOP Measurement===
[[Intraocular pressure|Intraocular pressure (IOP)]] is determined by the production, circulation and drainage of ocular [[aqueous humor]] and is described by the equation:</br>
::<math>IOP =\frac {F}{C} +PV</math>

Where:</br>
::F = aqueous fluid formation rate
::C = aqueous outflow rate
::PV = episcleral venous pressure

In general populations IOP ranges between  and 20 mmHg with an average of 15.5 mmHg, aqueous flow averages 2.9 μL/min in young healthy adults and 2.2 μL/min in octogenarians, and episcleral venous pressure ranges from 7 to 14 mmHg with 9 to 10 mmHg being typical.

The first U.S. case of visual changes observed on orbit was reported by a long-duration astronaut that noticed a marked decrease in near-visual acuity throughout his mission on board the [[ISS]], but at no time reported [[headache]]s, transient visual obscurations, [[Tinnitus#Objective_tinnitus|pulsatile tinnitus]] or [[diplopia]] (double vision).  His postflight [[Dilated fundus examination|fundus examination]] (Figure 1) revealed [http://dro.hs.columbia.edu/chorfolds.htm choroidal folds] below the [[optic disc]] and a single [[Cotton wool spots|cotton-wool spot]] in the inferior arcade of the right eye.  The acquired choroidal folds gradually improved, but were still present 3 year postflight.  The left eye examination was normal.  There was no documented evidence of optic-disc edema in either eye.  [[Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain|Brain MRI]], [[lumbar puncture]], and [[Optical coherence tomography|OCT]] were not performed preflight or postflight on this astronaut.<ref name="Evidence Report" />

[[File:VIIP Figure 1.png|thumb|'''Figure 1:'''Fundus examination of the first case of visual changes from long-duration spaceflight. Fundus examination revealed choroidal folds inferior to the optic disc and a single cotton-wool spot in the inferior arcade of the right eye (white arrow).]]

The second case of visual changes during long-duration spaceflight on board the ISS was reported approximately 3 months after launch when the astronaut noticed that he could now only see Earth clearly while looking through his reading glasses.  The change continued for the remainder of the mission without noticeable improvement or progression.  He did not complain of transient visual obscurations, headaches, diplopia, pulsatile tinnitus or visual changes during eye movement.  In the months since landing, he has noticed a gradual, but incomplete, improvement in vision.<ref name="Evidence Report" />

Both optic discs show grade 1 disc edema.]]

The third case of visual changes while on board the ISS had no changes in visual acuity and no complaints of headaches, transient visual obscurations, diplopia or pulsatile tinnitus during the mission.  Upon return to Earth, no eye issues were reported by the astronaut at landing.  Fundus examination revealed bilateral, asymmetrical disc edema.  There was no evidence of choroidal folds or cotton-wool spots, but a small hemorrhage was observed below the optic dics in the right eye. This astronaut had the most pronounced optic-disc edema of all astronauts reported to date, but had no choroidal folds, globe flattening or [http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/hyperopic-shift hyperopic shift].  At 10 days post landing, an MRI of the brain and eyes was normal, but there appeared to be a mild increase in CSF signal around the right optic nerve.<ref name="Evidence Report" />

The fourth case of visual changes on orbit was significant for a past history of [[Hypophysectomy|transsphenoidal hypophysectomy]] for [[Pituitary adenoma|macroadenoma]] where postoperative imaging showed no residual or recurrent disease.  Approximately 2 months into the ISS mission, the astronaut noticed a progressive decrease in near-visual acuity in his right eye and a [[scotoma]] in his right temporal field of vision.<ref name="Evidence Report" />

During the same mission, another ISS long-duration astronaut reported the fifth case of decreased near-visual acuity after 3 weeks of spaceflight.  In both cases, CO<sub>2</sub>, cabin pressure and oxygen levels were reported to be within acceptable limits and the astronauts were not exposed to any toxic fumes.<ref name="Evidence Report" />

The fifth case of visual changes observed on the ISS was noticed only 3 weeks into his mission.  This change continued for the remainder of the mission without noticeable improvement or progression.  He never complained of headaches, transient visual obscurations, diplopia, pulsatile tinnitus or other visual changes.  Upon return to Earth, he noted persistence of the vision changes he observed in space.  He never experienced losses in subjective best-corrected acuity, color vision or stereopsis.  This case is interesting because the astronaut did not have disc edema or choroidal folds, but was documented to have nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickening, globe flattening, a hyperopic shift and subjective complaints of loss of near vision.<ref name="Evidence Report" />

The sixth case of visual changes of an ISS astronaut was reported after return to Earth from a 6 month mission.  When he noticed that his far vision was clearer through his reading glasses.  A fundus examination performed 3 weeks postflight documented a grade 1 nasal optic-disc edema in the right eye only.  There was no evidence of disc edema in the left eye or choroidal folds in either eye (Figure 13).  MRI of the brain and eyes  days postflight revealed bilateral flattening of the posterior globe, right greater than left, and a mildly distended right optic nerve sheath.  There was also evidence of optic-disc edema in the right eye.  A fundus examination postflight revealed a "new onset" cotton-wool spot in the left eye.  This was not observed in the fundus photographs taken 3 weeks postflight.<ref name="Evidence Report" />

The seventh case of visual changes associated with spaceflight is significant in that it was eventually treated postflight.  Approximately 2 months into the ISS mission, the astronaut reported a progressive decrease in his near and far acuity in both eyes.  The ISS cabin pressure, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> levels were reported to be within normal operating limits and the astronaut was not exposed to any toxic substances.  He never experienced losses in subjective best-corrected acuity, color vision or stereopsis.  A fundus examination revealed a grade 1 bilateral optic-disc edema and choroidal folds (Figure 15).<ref name="Evidence Report" />

==Case Definition and Clinical Practice Guidelines==
According to guidelines set forth by the Space Medicine Division, all long-duration astronauts with postflight vision changes should be considered a suspected case of VIIP syndrome.  Each case could then be further differentiated by definitive imaging studies establishing the postflight presence of optic-disc edema, increased ONSD and altered OCT findings.  The results from these imaging studies are then divided into five classes that determine what follow-up testing and monitoring is required.

===Classes===
The definition of the classes and Frisén scale used for optic disc edema diagnosis are listed below:

'''Class 0'''
* < 0.50 diopter cycloplegic refractive change
* No evidence of optic-disc edema, nerve sheath distention, choroidal folds, globe flattening, scotoma or cotton-wool spots compared to baseline

'''Class 1'''</br>
Repeat OCT and visual acuity in 6 weeks
* Refractive changes ≥ 0.50 diopter cycloplegic refractive change and/or cotton-wool spot
* No evidence of optic-disc edema, nerve sheath distanton, choroidal folds, globe flattening or scotoma compared to baseline
* CSF opening pressure ≤ 25&nbsp;cm H<sub>2</sub>O (if measured)

'''Class 2'''</br>
Repeat OCT, cycloplegic refraction, fundus examination and threshold visual field every 4 to 6 weeks × 6 months, repeat MRI in 6 months
* ≥ 0.50 diopter cycloplegic refractive changes or cotton-wool spot
* Choroidal folds and/or ONS distention and/or globe flattening and/or scotoma
* No evidence of optic-disc edema
* CSF opening pressure ≤ 25&nbsp;cm H<sub>2</sub>O (if measured)

'''Class 3'''</br>
Repeat OCT, cycloplegic refraction, fundus examination and threshold visual field every 4 to 6 weeks × 6 months, repeat MRI in 6 months
* ≥ 0.50 diopter cycloplegic refractive changes and/or cotton-wool spot
* Optic nerve sheath distention, and/or globe flattening and/or choroidal folds and/or scotoma
* Optic-disc edema of Grade 0-2
* CSF opening pressure ≤ 25&nbsp;cm H<sub>2</sub>O

'''Class 4'''</br>
Institute treatment protocol as per Clinical Practice Guideline
* ≥ 0.50 diopter cycloplegic refractive changes and/or cotton-wool spot
* Optic nerve sheath distention, and/or globe flattening and/or choroidal folds and/or scotoma
* Optic-disc edema Grade 2 or above
* Presenting symptoms of new headache, pulsatile tinnitus and/or transient visual obscurations
* CSF opening pressure > 25&nbsp;cm H<sub>2</sub>O

===Stages===
Optic-disc edema will be graded based on the Frisén Scale<ref name="Frisén (247)">{{cite journal|last=Frisén|first=L|title=Swelling of the optic nerve head: a staging scheme.|journal=Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry|year=1982|month=January|volume=45|issue=1|pages=13–8|pmid=7062066|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC491259/|pmc=491259}}</ref> as below:

'''Stage 0 - Normal Optic-disc'''</br>
Blurring of nasal, superior and inferior poles in inverse proportion to disc diameter.  Radial nerve fiber layer (NFL) without NFL tortuosity.  Rare obscuration of a major blood vessel, usually on the upper pole.

'''Stage 1 - Very Early Optic-disc Edema'''</br>
Obscuration of the nasal border of the disc.  No elevation of the disc borders.  Disruption of the normal radial NFL arrangement with grayish opacity accentuating nerve fiber layer bundles.  Normal temporal disc margin.  Subtle grayish halo with temporal gap (best seen with indirect opthalmoscopy).  Concentric or radial retrochoroidal folds.

'''Stage 2 - Early Optic-disc Edema'''</br>
Obscuration of all borders.  Elevation of the nasal border.  Complete peripapillary halo.

'''Stage 3 - Moderate Optic-disc Edema'''</br>
Obscurations of all borders.  Increased diameter of ONH.  Obscuration of one or more segments of major blood vessels leaving the disc.  Peripapillary halo - irregular outer fringe with finger-like extensions.

'''Stage 4 - Marked Optic-disc Edema'''</br>
Elevation of the entire nerve head.  Obscuration of all borders.  Peripapillary halo.  Total obscuration on the disc of a segment of a major vessel.

'''Stage 5 - Severe Optic-disc Edema'''</br>
Dome-shaped protrusions representing anterior expansion of the ONG.  Peripapillary halo is narrow and smoothly demarcated.  Total obscuration of a segment of a major blood vessel may or may not be present.  Obliteration of the optic cup.

==Risk Factors and Recommendations==
Risk factors and underlying mechanisms based on anatomy, physiology, genetics and epigenetics need to be researched further.<ref name=6-6>{{cite web|title=The Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure Summit Report|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2011-216160.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=13 June 2012|pages=6-6}}</ref>

The following actions have been recommended to assist in the research of vision impairment and increased intracranial pressure associated with long-duration space flight:<ref name=9-10>{{cite web|title=The Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure Summit Report|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2011-216160.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=13 June 2012|pages=9–10}}</ref>

===Immediate Actions===
* Correlate pre-flight and post-flight MRIs with in-flight Ultrasound
* Directly measure intracranial pressure through lumbar puncture pre-flight and post-flight on all long duration astronauts
* Due to the normal variability in this measurement, obtain more than one pre-flight intracranial pressure measurement through lumbar puncture
* Enhanced analysis of OCT findings such as RPE angle
* Blinded readings of previous and future diagnostic imaging to minimize potential bias
* Measurement of in-flight IOP on all astronauts
* Improved in-flight fundoscopic imaging capability
* Measurement of pre-flight and post-flight compliance (cranial, spinal, vascular)

===Near and Long Term Actions===
* Establish case definition based on current [http://www.lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/lsda_data/mrid_docs/mrid_book.pdf Medical Requirements Integration Documents (MRID)] and clinical findings
* Develop clinical practice guidelines
* Establish a reliable and accurate non-invasive in-flight capability to measure and monitor ICP, compliance and cerebral blood flow
* Develop more sophisticated in-flight neurocognitive testing
* Establish risk stratification and underlying mechanisms based on anatomy and physiology
* Characterization of Human Spaceflight Physiology and Anatomy (human and animal tissue studies)
* Develop or utilize advance imaging modalities ([[Near-infrared spectroscopy|Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)]], [[Transcranial Doppler|Transcranial Doppler (TCD)]], Opthalmodynanometry, Venous Doppler Ultrasound
* Genetic testing and the use of biomarkers in blood and [[Cerebrospinal fluid|cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)]]

==Benefits to Earth==
The development of accurate and reliable non-invasive ICP measurement methods for VIIP has the potential to benefit many patients on earth who need diagnostic ICP measurement, including those with hydrocephalus, intracranial hypertension, intracranial hypotension, and patients with cerebrospinal fluid shunts. Current ICP measurement techniques are invasive and require either a lumbar puncture, insertion of a temporary spinal catheter,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Torbey|first=MT|coauthors=Geocadin RG, Razumovsky AY, Rigamonti D, Williams MA|title=Utility of CSF pressure monitoring to identify idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema in patients with chronic daily headache|journal=Cephalalgia|year=2004|volume=24|issue=6|pages=495–502|pmid=15154860|accessdate=22 August 2012|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2004.00688.x}}</ref> insertion of a cranial ICP monitor, or insertion of a needle into a shunt reservoir.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Geocadin|first=RG|coauthors=Varelas PN, Rigamonti D, Williams MA|title=Continuous intracranial pressure monitoring via the shunt reservoir to assess suspected shunt malfunction in adults with hydrocephalus.|journal=Neurosurg Focus|year=2007|month=April|volume=22|issue=4|pages=E10|pmid=17613188|url=http://thejns.org/doi/pdf/10.3171/foc.2007.22.4.12|accessdate=22 August 2012|doi=10.3171/foc.2007.22.4.12}}</ref>
