A '''medical error''' is a preventable [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]] of care, whether or not it is evident or harmful to the patient.  This might include an inaccurate or incomplete [[Diagnosis (medical)|diagnosis]] or [[therapy|treatment]] of a [[disease]], [[injury]], [[syndrome]], [[behavior]], [[infection]], or other ailment.

==Definitions==
A medical error occurs when a health-care provider chooses an inappropriate method of care or improperly executes an appropriate method of care. Medical errors are often described as human errors in healthcare.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zhang, J., Patel, V.L., & Johnson, T.R | year = 2008 | title = Medical error: Is the solution medical or cognitive?| journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 6 | issue = Supp1 | pages = 75–77 | doi = 10.1197/jamia.M1232}}</ref>

However, medical error definitions are subject to debate, as there are many types of medical error from minor to major,<ref name="mederror">{{cite journal|title=What Is an Error?|author=Timothy P. Hofer, MD|date=November 2000|publisher=Effective Clinical Practice (American College of Physicians)|url=http://www.acponline.org/journals/ecp/novdec00/hofer.htm}}</ref> and causality is often poorly determined.<ref name="mederror2">{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.286.4.415|title=Estimating Hospital Deaths Due to Medical Errors: Preventability Is in the Eye of the Reviewer|author=Rodney A.

==Impact==
A 2000 [[Institute of Medicine]] report estimated that medical errors are estimated to result in about between 44,000 and 98,000 preventable deaths and 1,000,000 excess injuries each year in U.S. hospitals.<ref>{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | first= | year=2000 | url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9728 | title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (2000) | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Charatan | first=Fred | year=2000 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7235/597?ijkey=190e9b6dd6e8fec4ca3c2e353f290efb8237b334&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | title=Clinton acts to reduce medical mistakes | publisher=BMJ Publishing Group |doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7235.597| accessdate=2006-03-17}}</ref><ref name=Epid>{{cite journal |author=Weingart SN, Wilson RM, Gibberd RW, Harrison B |title=Epidemiology of medical error |journal=BMJ |volume=320 |issue=7237 |pages=774–7 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10720365 |pmc=1117772 |doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7237.774 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10720365}}</ref>

Some researchers questioned the accuracy of the IOM study, criticizing the statistical handling of [[measurement error]]s in the report,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hayward RA, Heisler M, Adams J, Dudley RA, Hofer TP |title=Overestimating outcome rates: statistical estimation when reliability is suboptimal |journal=Health Serv Res |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=1718–38 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17610445 |pmc=1955272 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2006.00661.x |url=}}</ref> significant subjectivity in determining which deaths were "avoidable" or due to medical error, and an erroneous assumption that 100% of patients would have survived if optimal care had been provided.<ref name="Hayward & Hofer"/> A 2001 study in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' of seven [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] medical centers estimated that for roughly every 10,000 patients admitted to the subject hospitals, one patient died who would have lived for three months or more in good cognitive health had "optimal" care been provided.<ref name="Hayward & Hofer">{{cite journal |author=Hayward R, Hofer T |title=Estimating hospital deaths due to medical errors: preventability is in the eye of the reviewer |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=4 |pages=415–20 |year=2001 |pmid=11466119 |doi=10.1001/jama.286.4.415}}</ref>

A 2006 follow-up to the IOM study found that medication errors are among the most common medical mistakes, harming at least 1.5 million people every year. According to the study, 400,000 preventable drug-related injuries occur each year in hospitals, 800,000 in long-term care settings, and roughly 530,000 among Medicare recipients in outpatient clinics. The report stated that these are likely to be conservative estimates. In 2000 alone, the extra medical costs incurred by preventable drug related injuries approximated $887 million{{mdash}}and the study looked only at injuries sustained by Medicare recipients, a subset of clinic visitors.  None of these figures take into account lost wages and productivity or other costs.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |year=2006 |url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11623 |title=Medication Errors Injure 1.5 Million People and Cost Billions of Dollars Annually |format= |publisher=The National Academy of Science |accessdate=2006}}</ref>

According to a 2002 [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] report, about 7,000 people were estimated to die each year from medication errors - about 16 percent more deaths than the number attributable to work-related injuries (6,000 deaths).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Medical errors affect one in 10 patients worldwide. One extrapolation suggests that 180,000 people die each year partly as a result of iatrogenic injury.<ref name="pmid7503827">{{cite journal |author=Leape LL |title=Error in medicine |journal=JAMA |volume=272 |issue=23 |pages=1851–7 |year=1994 |pmid=7503827 |doi=10.1001/jama.272.23.1851}}</ref> One in five Americans (22%) report that they or a family member have experienced a medical error of some kind.<ref>[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Annual-Reports/2002-Annual-Report.aspx 2002 Annual Report], [[The Commonwealth Fund]]</ref>

===Difficulties in measuring frequency of errors===
About 1% of hospital admissions result in an adverse event due to negligence.<ref name="pmid1987460">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199102073240604 |author=Brennan T, Leape L, Laird N, Hebert L, Localio A, Lawthers A, Newhouse J, Weiler P, Hiatt H |title=Incidence of adverse events and negligence in hospitalized patients. Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study I |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=324 |issue=6 |pages=370–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1987460}}</ref> However, mistakes are likely much more common, as these studies identify only mistakes that led to measurable adverse events occurring soon after the errors. Independent review of doctors' treatment plans suggests that decision-making could be improved in 14% of admissions; many of the benefits would have delayed manifestations.<ref name="pmid15109337">{{cite journal |author=Lucas B, Evans A, Reilly B, Khodakov Y, Perumal K, Rohr L, Akamah J, Alausa T, Smith C, Smith J |title=The Impact of Evidence on Physicians' Inpatient Treatment Decisions |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=19 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=402–9 |year=2004 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30306.x | pmid=15109337 |pmc=1492243}}</ref> Even this number may be an underestimate.

The quality of health care delivered to adults in the United States. N Engl J Med. 2003;348(:2635-45. PMID 12826639</ref>. At the same time, a second study found that 30% of care in the United States may be unnecessary.<ref name="pmid14573739">{{cite journal | pmid = 14573739 | doi=10.1056/NEJMe038149 | volume=349 | issue=17 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | year=2003 | title = Medical Care — Is More Always Better? | month=October | pages=1665–7 | author=Fisher ES}}</ref> For example, if a doctor fails to order a mammogram that is past due, this mistake will not show up in the first type of study.<ref name="pmid1987460"/> And because no adverse event occurred during the short follow-up of the study, the mistake also would not show up in the second type of study,<ref name="pmid15109337"/> because only the principal treatment plans were critiqued. However, the mistake would be recorded in the third type of study. If a doctor recommends an unnecessary treatment or test, it may not show in any of these types of studies.

==Causes==
:''See also [[Healthcare error proliferation model]]''

Medical errors are associated with inexperienced physicians and nurses, new procedures, extremes of age, and complex or urgent care.<ref>{{cite web | last=Weingart | first=Saul | coauthors=Ciara Wilson, Bob Marley, Karina  | year=2000 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7237/774 | title=Epidemiology of medical error | publisher=BMJ Publishing Group | accessdate=2006-03-17}}</ref> Poor communication (whether in one's own language or, as may be the case for [[medical tourism|medical tourists]], another language), improper documentation, illegible handwriting, inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios, and similarly named medications are also known to contribute to the problem. Patient actions may also contribute significantly to medical errors. Falls, for example, may result from patients' own misjudgements. Human error has been implicated in nearly 80 percent of adverse events that occur in complex healthcare systems. The vast majority of medical errors result from faulty systems and poorly designed processes versus poor practices or incompetent practitioners.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Palmieri, P. A., DeLucia, P. R., Ott, T. E., Peterson, L. T., & Green, A. | year = 2008 | title = The anatomy and physiology of error in averse healthcare events | journal = Advances in Health Care Management | volume = 7 | pages = 33–68 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-8231(08)07003-1 | series = Advances in Health Care Management | isbn = 978-1-84663-954-8}}</ref>

===Healthcare complexity===
Complicated technologies, powerful drugs, intensive care, and prolonged hospital stay can contribute to medical errors.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===System and process design===

In 2000, The Institute of Medicine released "To Err Is Human," which asserts that the problem in medical errors is not bad people in health care—it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer.<ref>National Academy of Sciences. 2000. To Err is Human. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=9728</ref>

Poor communication and unclear lines of authority of physicians, nurses, and other care providers are also contributing factors.<ref name=cause /> Disconnected reporting systems within a hospital can result in fragmented systems in which numerous hand-offs of patients results in lack of coordination and errors.<ref name=Gardner>{{cite news | last=Gardner | first=Amanda | date=6 March 2007 | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/06/AR2007030601334.html | title=Medication Errors During Surgeries Particularly Dangerous | publisher=The Washington Post | accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

Other factors include the impression that action is being taken by other groups within the institution, reliance on automated systems to prevent error.,<ref name=barcode>{{cite journal  | last = McDonald, MD   | first = Clement J. | title = Computerization Can Create Safety Hazards: A Bar-Coding Near Miss  | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine  | volume = 144  | issue = 7  | pages = 510–516  | date=4 April 2006| url = http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/144/7/510  | accessdate = 2006-07-31 | pmid = 16585665  }}</ref> and inadequate systems to share information about errors, which hampers analysis of contributory causes and improvement strategies.<ref>{{cite web | last=US Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality | first= | date=2008-01-09 | url=http://www.ahrq.gov/news/press/pr2008/errepsyspr.htm | title=Physicians Want To Learn from Medical Mistakes but Say Current Error-reporting Systems Are Inadequate | publisher=  | accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref>
Cost-cutting measures by hospitals in response to reimbursement cutbacks can compromise patient safety.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clement JP, Lindrooth RC, Chukmaitov AS, Chen HF |title=Does the patient's payer matter in hospital patient safety?: a study of urban hospitals |journal=Med Care |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=131–8 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17224775 |doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000244636.54588.2b }}</ref>
In emergencies, patient care may be rendered in areas poorly suited for safe monitoring. The American Institute of Architects has identified concerns for the safe design and construction of health care facilities.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The American Institute of Architects Academy Journal|publisher=The American Institute of Architects|title=Incorporating Patient-Safe Design into the Guidelines|date=2005-10-19 | url=http://www.aia.org/journal_aah.cfm?pagename=aah_jrnl_20051019_guidelines&dspl=1&article=article }}</ref>
Infrastructure failure is also a concern. According to the [[WHO]], 50% of medical equipment in developing countries is only partly usable due to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment.

The [[JCAHO|Joint Commission]]'s Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007 found that inadequate communication between healthcare providers, or between providers and the patient and family members, was the root cause of over half the serious adverse events in accredited hospitals.<ref>The Joint Commission’s Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007: [http://www.jointcommissionreport.org/ Improving America’s Hospitals] (Accessed 2008-04-09)</ref> Other leading causes included inadequate assessment of the patient's condition, and poor leadership or training.

===Competency, education, and training===

===Human factors and ergonomics===

[[Sleep deprivation]] has also been cited as a contributing factor in medical errors. One study found that being awake for over 24 hours caused medical interns to double or triple the number of preventable medical errors, including those that resulted in injury or death.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barger LK, Ayas NT, Cade BE, Cronin JW, Rosner B ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = Impact of Extended-Duration Shifts on Medical Errors, Adverse Events, and Attentional Failures | url = | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 3 | issue = 12| page = e487 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030487 | pmc = 1705824 | pmid=17194188}}</ref> The risk of car crash after these shifts increased by 168%, and the risk of near miss by 460%.<ref name="npr">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6619687 When Doctors Don't Sleep], Talk of the Nation, National Public Radio, 13 December 2006.</ref> Interns admitted falling asleep during lectures, during rounds, and even during surgeries.<ref name="npr" />

==Examples of errors==
Errors can include [[misdiagnosis]] or delayed diagnosis, administration of the wrong [[medication|drug]] to the wrong patient or in the wrong way, giving multiple drugs that [[drug interaction|interact]] negatively, [[surgery]] on an incorrect site, failure to remove all [[retained surgical instruments|surgical instruments]], failure to take the correct blood type into account, or incorrect record-keeping.

===Errors in HIV diagnosis===
A large study reported several cases where patients were wrongly told that they were HIV-negative when the physicians erroneously ordered and interpreted HTLV (a closely related virus) testing rather than HIV testing. In the same study, >90% of HTLV tests were ordered erroneously. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Siemieniuk|first=Reed|coauthors=Fonseca, Kevin; Gill, M.

===Misdiagnosis of psychological disorders===
Regarding [[mental illness]]es, sufferers of [[dissociative identity disorder]] usually have [[psychiatric history|psychiatric histories]] that contain three or more separate [[mental disorders]] and previous [[therapy|treatment]] failures.<ref name = merckdoc>{{cite web | url = http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec15/ch197/ch197e.html | title = Dissociative Identity Disorder, doctor's reference | publisher = Merck.com | accessdate = 2008-03-30 | date = 2005-11-01 }}</ref> The disbelief of some doctors around the validity of dissociative identity disorder may also add to its misdiagnosis.<ref name = merckdoc/>

Female sexual desire sometimes used to be diagnosed as [[Female hysteria]].

[[Food sensitivity|Sensitivities to foods]] and [[food allergies]] risk being misdiagnosed as the [[anxiety disorder]] [[Orthorexia]].

Studies have found that [[bipolar disorder]] has often been misdiagnosed as [[major depression]].

===Outpatient vs. inpatient===
Misdiagnosis is the leading cause of medical error in out patient facilities.
Since the National Institute of Medicine’s 1999 [http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/1999/To-Err-is-Human/To%20Err%20is%20Human%201999%20%20report%20brief.pdf report], “To Err is Human,” found up to 98,000 hospital patients die from preventable medical errors in the U.S. each year, government and private sector efforts have focused on inpatient safety.<ref>{{cite web|last=Janet|first=Howard|title=Malpractice Lawsuits Shed Light on Ailing Outpatient System|url=http://myadvocatesblog.com/malpractice/malpractice-lawsuits-shed-light-on-ailing-outpatient-system|work=My Advocates|accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref>

Some doctors recognize that adverse outcomes from errors usually do not happen because of an isolated errors and actually reflect system problems.<ref name="pmid2013929">{{cite journal |author=Wu AW, Folkman S, McPhee SJ, Lo B |title=Do house officers learn from their mistakes? |journal=JAMA |volume=265 |issue=16 |pages=2089–94 |year=1991 |pmid=2013929 |doi=10.1001/jama.265.16.2089}}</ref> This concept is often referred to as the Swiss Cheese Model.<ref name="Dean B 2000 232‐237">{{cite journal|last=Dean B|coauthors=Barber N & Schachter M|title=What is a prescribing error?|journal=Qual Saf Health Care|year=2000|month=Oct|volume=9|issue=4|pages=232‐237|url=http://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/9/4/232.fulll}}</ref> This is the concept that there are layers of protection for clinicians and patient to prevent mistakes from occurring. Therefore, even if a doctor or nurse makes a small error (incorrect dose of drug written on a drug chart by doctor) this is picked up before it actually affects patient care (pharmacist checks the drug chart and makes rectifies the error).<ref name="Dean B 2000 232‐237"/> Such mechanisms include: 
Practical alterations (e.g.-medications that cannot be given IV, are fitted with tubing which means they cannot be linked to an IV even if a clinician makes a mistake and tries to),<ref name="Romero‐Perez 2012 1–9">{{cite journal|last=Romero‐Perez|first=Raquel|coauthors=Dr Philippa Hildick‐Smith|title=Minimising Prescribing Errors in Paediatrics ‐ Clinical Audit|journal=Scottish Universities Medical Journal|year=2012|month=Sept|volume=EPub|issue=EPub 1:14|pages=1–9}}</ref> systematic safety processes (e.g.- all patients must have a Waterlow score assessment and falls assessment completed on admission),<ref name="Romero‐Perez 2012 1–9"/> training programmes/continuing professional development courses <ref name="Romero‐Perez 2012 1–9"/> are measures that may be put in place.

===Placing the practice of medicine in perspective===
Essayists imply that the potential to make mistakes is part of what makes being a physician rewarding and without this potential the rewards of medical practice would be less. Laurence states that "Everybody dies, you and all of your patients. All relationships end. Would you want it any other way? [...] Don't take it personally"<ref name="isbn1-56053-603-9">{{cite book |author=Thomas Laurence, |chapter=What Do You Want?|title=Extreme Clinic -- An Outpatient Doctor's Guide to the Perfect 7 Minute Visit |publisher=Hanley & Belfus |location=Philadelphia |year=2004 |isbn=1-56053-603-9 |oclc= |doi= |page=120}}</ref>
Seder states "[...] if I left medicine, I would mourn its loss as I've mourned the passage of my poetry. On a daily basis, it is both a privilege and a joy to have the trust of patients and their families and the camaraderie of peers.

===Disclosing mistakes===
[[Forgiveness]], which is part of many cultural traditions, may be important in coping with medical mistakes.<ref name="pmid15681676">{{cite journal |author=Berlinger N, Wu A |title=Subtracting insult from injury: addressing cultural expectations in the disclosure of medical error |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=106–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15681676 |doi=10.1136/jme.2003.005538 |pmc=1734098}}</ref>

A 2005 study by Wendy Levinson of the [[University of Toronto]] showed surgeons discussing medical errors used the word "error" or "mistake" in only 57 per cent of disclosure conversations and offered a verbal apology only 47 per cent of the time.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kelly | first=Karen | year=2005 | url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin6/051117-1824.asp | title=Study explores how physicians communicate mistakes | publisher=University of Toronto | accessdate=2006-03-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060322154328/http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin6/051117-1824.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-03-22}}</ref>

Patient disclosure is important in the medical error process. The current standard of practice at many hospitals is to disclose errors to patients when they occur. In the past, it was a common fear that disclosure to the patient would incite a malpractice lawsuit. Many physicians would not explain that an error had taken place, causing a lack of trust toward the healthcare community. In 2007, 34 states passed legislation that precludes any information from a physician’s apology for a medical error from being used in malpractice court (even a full admission of fault).<ref>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) http://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer.aspx?primerID=2</ref> This encourages physicians to acknowledge and explain mistakes to patients, and keeping an open line of communication.

The American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs states in its ethics code:
:"Situations occasionally occur in which a patient suffers significant medical complications that may have resulted from the physician's mistake or judgment. In these situations, the physician is ethically required to inform the patient of all facts necessary to ensure understanding of what has occurred. Concern regarding legal liability which might result following truthful disclosure should not affect the physician's honesty with a patient."

From the American  College of Physicians Ethics Manual:<ref name="pmid15809467">{{cite journal |author=Snyder L, Leffler C |title=Ethics manual: fifth edition |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=142 |issue=7 |pages=560–82 |year=2005 |pmid=15809467 |last3=Ethics Human Rights Committee}}</ref>
:“In addition, physicians should disclose to patients information about procedural or judgment errors made in the course of care if such information is material to the patient's well-being. Errors do not necessarily constitute improper, negligent, or unethical behavior, but failure to disclose them may.”

However, "there appears to be a gap between physicians' attitudes and practices regarding error disclosure. Willingness to disclose errors was associated with higher training level and a variety of patient-centered attitudes, and it was not lessened by previous exposure to malpractice litigation".<ref name="pmid17473944">{{cite journal |author=Kaldjian LC, Jones EW, Wu BJ, Forman-Hoffman VL, Levi BH, Rosenthal GE |title=Disclosing Medical Errors to Patients: Attitudes and Practices of Physicians and Trainees |journal=Journal of general internal medicine : official journal of the Society for Research and Education in Primary Care Internal Medicine |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=988–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17473944 |doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0227-z |pmc=2219725}}</ref> Hospital administrators may share these concerns.<ref name="pmid15769969">{{cite journal |author=Weissman JS, Annas CL, Epstein AM, ''et al.'' |title=Error reporting and disclosure systems: views from hospital leaders |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=11 |pages=1359–66 |year=2005 |pmid=15769969 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.11.1359}}</ref>

Consequently, in the [[United States]], many states have enacted laws excluding expressions of sympathy after accidents as proof of liability; however, "excluding from admissibility in court proceedings apologetic expressions of sympathy but not fault-admitting apologies after accidents"<ref name="sorryworks.net">{{cite web |url=http://www.sorryworks.net/ |title=SorryWorks.net |accessdate=2007-08-16 |format= |work=}}</ref>

In a study of physicians who reported having made a mistake, disclosing to non-physicians sources of support may reduce stress more than disclosing to physician colleagues.<ref name="pmid8601210">{{cite journal |author=Newman MC |title=The emotional impact of mistakes on family physicians |journal=Archives of family medicine |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=71–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8601210 |doi=10.1001/archfami.5.2.71}}</ref> This may be due to the physicians in the same study, when presented with a hypothetical scenario of a mistake made by another colleague, only 32% physicians would have unconditionally offered support.

====Use of rationalization to cover up medical errors====
Based on anecdotal and survey evidence, Banja<ref name=banja1>Banja, John, Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism, 2005</ref> states that [[rationalization (making excuses)]] is very common amongst the medical profession in covering up medical errors.

====By presence of to the patient====
A survey of more than 10,000 physicians in the United States came to the results that, on the question ''"Are there times when it's acceptable to cover up or avoid revealing a mistake if that mistake would not cause harm to the patient?"'', 19% answered ''yes'', 60% answered ''no'' and 21% answered ''it depends''. On the question ''"Are there times when it is acceptable to cover up or avoid revealing a mistake if that mistake would potentially or likely harm the patient?"'', 2% answered ''yes'', 95% answered ''no'' and 3% answered ''it depends''.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735033?src=mp&spon=25 'Some Worms Are Best Left in the Can' -- Should You Hide Medical Errors?] By Gail Garfinkel Weiss. Posted: 01/04/2011</ref>

===Cause-specific preventive measures===
Traditionally, errors are attributed to mistakes made by individuals who may be penalized for these mistakes. The usual approach to correct the errors is to create new rules with additional checking steps in the system, aiming to prevent further errors. As an example, an error of free flow IV administration of heparin is approached by teaching staff how to use the IV systems and to use special care in setting the IV pump. While overall errors become less likely, the checks add to workload and may in themselves be a cause of additional errors.

A newer model for improvement in medical care takes its origin from the work of [[W. Edwards Deming]] in a model of [[Total Quality Management]]. In this model, there is an attempt to identify the underlying system defect that allowed the opportunity for the error to occur. As an example, in such a system the error of free flow IV administration of Heparin is dealt with by not using IV heparin and substituting subcutaneous administration of heparin, obviating the entire problem. However, such an approach presupposes available research showing that subcutaneous heparin is as effective as IV. Thus, most systems use a combination of approaches to the problem.

===In specific specialties===
The field of medicine that has taken the lead in systems approaches to safety is [[anaesthesiology]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Gaba | first=David | year=2000 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7237/785 | title=Anaesthesiology as a model for patient safety in health care | publisher=BMJ Publishing Group | accessdate=2006-03-17}}</ref> Steps such as standardization of IV medications to 1 ml doses, national and international color-coding standards, and development of improved airway support devices has made anesthesia care a model of systems improvement in care.

[[Pharmacy]] professionals have extensively studied the causes of errors in the prescribing, preparation, dispensing and administration of medications. As far back as the 1930s, pharmacists worked with physicians to select, from amongst many options, the safest and most effective drugs available for use in hospitals.<ref>Pease E. "Minimum standards for a hospital pharmacy." Bull Am Coll Surg 1936;21:34-35</ref> The process is known as the Formulary System and the list of drugs is known as the Formulary. In the 1960s, hospitals implemented unit dose packaging and unit dose drug distribution systems to reduce the risk of wrong drug and wrong dose errors in hospitalized patients;<ref>Chapter IV.1 Medication Distribution Systems, Garrison TJ (au) in Handbook of Institutional Pharmacy Practice, Smith MC and Brown TR eds, Williams and Wilkins Co. 1979,</ref> centralized sterile admixture services were shown to decrease the risks of contaminated and infected intravenous medications;<ref>Chapter IV.3 Developing Intravenous Admixture Systems, Woodward WA and Schwartau N (au) in Handbook of Institutional Pharmacy Practice, Smith MC and Brown TR eds, Williams and Wilkins Co. 1979,</ref> pharmacy computers screened each patient’s medication list for drug-drug interactions;<ref>Chapter 53 The Patient Profile System, Powell MF (au) in Handbook of Institutional Pharmacy Practice, Smith MC and Brown TR eds, Williams and Wilkins Co. 1986,</ref> and, pharmacists provided drug information and clinical decision support directly to physicians to improve the safe and effective use of medications.<ref>Chapter 31 Communicating Drug Information, Evens RP (au) in Handbook of Institutional Pharmacy Practice, Smith MC and Brown TR eds, Williams and Wilkins Co. 1986,</ref> Pharmacists are recognized experts in medication safety and have made many contributions that reduce error and improve patient care over the last 50 years. More recently, governments have attempted to address issues like patient-pharmacists communication and consumer knowledge through measures like the [[Australian Government]]'s [[Quality Use of Medicines]] policy.

===Legal procedure===
{{Main|Medical malpractice}}
Standards and regulations for medical malpractice vary by country and jurisdiction within countries.  Medical professionals may obtain [[professional liability insurance]]s to offset the risk and costs of lawsuits based on medical malpractice.

==Methods to improve safety and reduce error==
{{Further|Patient safety}}

Medical care is frequently compared adversely to [[aviation]]; while many of the factors that lead to errors in both fields are similar, aviation's error management protocols are regarded as much more effective.<ref>{{cite web | last=Helmreich | first=Robert | year=2000 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/ijlink?linkType=FULL&journalCode=bmj&resid=320/7237/781 | title=On error management: lessons from aviation | publisher=BMJ Publishing Group | accessdate=2006-03-17}}</ref>
Safety measures include [[informed consent]], the availability of a second practitioner's opinion, voluntary reporting of errors, [[root cause analysis]], reminders to improve patient medication adherence, [[hospital accreditation]], and systems to ensure review by experienced or specialist practitioners<ref>{{cite web | last=Espinosa | first=James | coauthors=Thomas Nolan | year=2000 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7237/737 | title=Reducing errors made by emergency physicians in interpreting radiographs: longitudinal study | publisher=BMJ Publishing Group | accessdate=2006-03-17}}</ref>

===Reporting requirements===
In the United States reporting medical errors in hospitals is a condition of payment by Medicare.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/health/study-of-medicare-patients-finds-most-hospital-errors-unreported.html "Report Finds Most Errors at Hospitals Go Unreported"] article by Robert Pear in ''[[The New York Times]]'' January 6, 2012</ref> An investigation by the Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services released January 6, 2012 found that most errors are not reported and even in the case of errors that are reported and investigated changes are seldom made which would prevent them in the furture. The investigation revealed that there was often lack of knowledge regarding which events were reportable and recommended that lists of reportable events be developed.<ref>[http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-09-00091.asp Summary "Hospital Incident Reporting Systems Do Not Capture Most Patient Harm"] Report (OEI-06-09-00091) Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services, January 6, 2012</ref>

==Misconceptions of medical error==
Common misconceptions about adverse events are the following, and in parentheses are the arguments and explanations against those misconceptions:
*"Bad apples" or incompetent health care providers are a common cause. (Although human error is commonly an initiating event, the faulty process of delivering care invariably permits or compounds the harm, and is the focus of improvement.<ref name=Epid/>
* High risk procedures or medical specialties are responsible for most ''avoidable'' adverse events. (Although some mistakes, such as in surgery, are harder to conceal, errors occur in all levels of care.<ref name=Epid /> Even though complex procedures entail more risk, adverse outcomes are not usually due to error, but to the severity of the condition being treated.).<ref name=cause /><ref name=barrier>{{cite journal | author = René Amalberti, MD, PhD; Yves Auroy, MD; Don Berwick, MD, MPP; and Paul Barach, MD, MPH  | date=3 May 2005| title = Five System Barriers to Achieving Ultrasafe Health Care | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 142 | pages = 756–764 | url = http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/142/9/756 | accessdate = 2006-07-12 | pmid = 15867408 | issue = 9 }}</ref> However, [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]] has reported that medication errors during the course of a surgical procedure are three times more likely to cause harm to a patient than those occurring in other types of hospital care.<ref name=Gardner />
* If a patient experiences an adverse event during the process of care, an error has occurred. (Most medical care entails some level of risk, and there can be complications or side effects, even unforeseen ones, from the underlying condition or from the treatment itself.<ref>{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | first= | year=1999 | url=http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309068371/html/4.html | title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, page 4 | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>
