The ''' human skin''' is the outer covering of the body. In [[human]]s, it is the largest organ of the [[integumentary system]].  The skin has multiple layers of [[ectodermal]] [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] and guards the underlying [[muscle]]s, [[bone]]s, [[ligament]]s and [[organ (anatomy)|internal organ]]s.<ref name="Hcare">

==Skin components==
{{See also|#Skin layers|l1=Skin layers}}

Skin has mesodermal cells, [[pigment]]ation, or [[melanin]] provided by [[melanocyte]]s, which absorb some of the potentially dangerous [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) in [[sunlight]]. It also contains [[DNA]]-repair [[enzyme]]s that help reverse UV damage, and people who lack the [[gene]]s for these enzymes suffer high rates of [[skin cancer]]. One form predominantly produced by UV light, [[malignant]] [[melanoma]], is particularly invasive, causing it to [[metastasize|spread]] quickly, and can often be deadly. Human skin pigmentation varies among populations in a striking manner. This has led to the classification of people(s) on the basis of [[human skin color|skin color]].<ref>{{cite book

The skin is the largest organ in the human body. For the average adult human, the skin has a surface area of between 1.5-2.0 square metres (16.1-21.5 sq ft.), most of it between 2–3&nbsp;mm (0.10&nbsp;inch) thick. The average square inch (6.5&nbsp;cm²) of skin holds 650 sweat glands, 20 blood vessels, 60,000 melanocytes, and more than 1,000 nerve endings.

==Functions==
Skin performs the following functions:

# '''Protection''': an anatomical barrier from pathogens and damage between the internal and external environment in bodily defense; [[Langerhans cell]]s in the skin are part of the [[adaptive immune system]].<ref name="Proksch"/><ref name="Madison"/>
# '''[[Wikt:sensation|Sensation]]''': contains a variety of nerve endings that react to [[thermoreceptor|heat and cold]], touch, pressure, vibration, and tissue injury; see [[somatosensory system]] and [[hapticity|haptics]].
# '''Heat regulation''': the skin contains a blood supply far greater than its requirements which allows precise control of energy loss by radiation, convection and conduction. Dilated blood vessels increase perfusion and heatloss, while constricted vessels greatly reduce cutaneous blood flow and conserve heat.
# '''Control of evaporation''': the skin provides a relatively dry and semi-impermeable barrier to fluid loss.<ref name="Madison"/> Loss of this function contributes to the massive fluid loss in [[burn (injury)|burns]].
# '''Aesthetics and communication''': others see our skin and can assess our mood, physical state and attractiveness.
# '''Storage and synthesis''': acts as a storage center for lipids and water, as well as a means of synthesis of [[vitamin D]] by action of [[Ultraviolet|UV]] on certain parts of the skin.
# '''Excretion''': [[sweat]] contains [[urea]], however its concentration is 1/130th that of [[urine]], hence [[excretion]] by sweating is at most a secondary function to temperature regulation.
# '''Absorption''': the cells comprising the outermost 0.25–0.40&nbsp;mm of the skin are "almost exclusively supplied by external oxygen", although the "contribution to total respiration is negligible".<ref>Stücker, M., A. Struk, P. Altmeyer, M. Herde, H. Baumgärtl & D.W. Lübbers (2002). {{PDFlink|[http://jp.physoc.org/content/538/3/985.full.pdf The cutaneous uptake of atmospheric oxygen contributes significantly to the oxygen supply of human dermis and epidermis.]}} ''Journal of Physiology'' '''538'''(3): 985–994. {{DOI|10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013067}}</ref> In addition, medicine can be administered through the skin, by ointments or by means of adhesive [[transdermal patch|patch]], such as the [[nicotine patch]] or [[iontophoresis]]. The skin is an important site of transport in many other organisms.
# '''Water resistance''': The skin acts as a water resistant barrier so essential nutrients aren't washed out of the body.

==Pigments==
There are at least five different pigments that determine the color of the skin.<ref>Handbook of General Anatomy by B. D. Chaurasia. ISBN 978-81-239-1654-5</ref><ref>[http://www.mananatomy.com/basic-anatomy/pigmentation-skin Pigmentation of Skin]</ref> These pigments are present at different levels and places.
*[[Melanin]]: It is brown in color and present in the germinative zone of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].
*Melanoid: It resembles melanin but is present diffusely throughout the epidermis.
*[[Keratin]]: This pigment is yellow to orange in color. It is present in the stratum corneum and fat cells of dermis and superficial fascia.
*[[Hemoglobin]] (also spelled ''haemoglobin''): It is found in blood and is not a pigment of the skin but develops a purple color.
*Oxyhemoglobin: It is also found in blood and is not a pigment of the skin. It develops a red color.

==Hygiene and skin care==
{{See also|Exfoliation (cosmetology)}}
The skin supports its own [[ecosystem]]s of [[microorganism]]s, including [[yeast]]s and bacteria, which cannot be removed by any amount of cleaning. Estimates place the number of individual bacteria on the surface of one square inch (6.5 square cm) of human skin at 50 million, though this figure varies greatly over the average {{convert|20|sqft|m2}} of human skin. Oily surfaces, such as the face, may contain over 500 million bacteria per square inch (6.5&nbsp;cm²). Despite these vast quantities, all of the bacteria found on the skin's surface would fit into a volume the size of a pea.<ref>Theodor Rosebury. ''Life on Man'': Secker & Warburg, 1969 ISBN 0-670-42793-4</ref> In general, the microorganisms keep one another in check and are part of a healthy skin. When the balance is disturbed, there may be an overgrowth and infection, such as when [[antibiotic]]s kill [[microbe]]s, resulting in an overgrowth of yeast. The skin is continuous with the inner [[epithelial]] lining of the body at the orifices, each of which supports its own complement of microbes.

Proper skin hygiene is important because unclean skin favors the development of pathogenic organisms. The dead cells that continually slough off the epidermis mix with the secretions of the sweat and sebaceous glands and the dust found on the skin form a filthy layer on its surface. If not washed away, the slurry of sweat and sebaceous secretions mixed with dirt and dead skin is decomposed by bacterial flora, producing a foul smell. Functions of the skin are disturbed when it is excessively dirty; it becomes more easily damaged, the release of antibacterial compounds decreases, and dirty skin is more prone to develop infections.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Cosmetics should be used carefully on the skin because these may cause allergic reactions. Each season requires suitable clothing in order to facilitate the evaporation of the sweat. Sunlight, water and air play an important role in keeping the skin healthy.

===Oily skin===
Oily skin is caused by over-active sebaceous glands, that produce a substance called [[sebum]], a naturally healthy skin lubricant.<ref name=Hcare/> When the skin produces excessive [[sebum]], it becomes heavy and thick in texture. Oily skin is typified by shininess, blemishes and [[pimples]].<ref name=Hcare/> The oily-skin type is not necessarily bad, since such skin is less prone to wrinkling, or other signs of aging,<ref name=Hcare/> because the oil helps to keep needed moisture locked into the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] (outermost layer of skin).

The negative aspect of the oily-skin type is that oily complexions are especially susceptible to clogged pores, [[blackhead]]s, and buildup of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin.<ref name=Hcare/> Oily skin can be sallow and rough in texture and tends to have large, clearly visible pores everywhere, except around the eyes and neck.<ref name=Hcare/>

== Aging ==
{{details|senescence}}
{{details|Intrinsic and extrinsic aging}}
[[Image:Rash.jpg|thumb|A typical rash]]
[[Image:Scabies-burrow.jpg|thumb||Skin infected with [[Scabies]]]]
As skin ages, it becomes thinner and more easily damaged. Intensifying this effect is the decreasing ability of skin to heal itself as a person ages.

Among other things, skin aging is noted by a decrease in volume and elasticity. There are many [[Intrinsic and extrinsic aging|internal and external causes]] to skin aging. For example, aging skin receives less blood flow and lower glandular activity.

A validated comprehensive grading scale has categorized the clinical findings of skin aging as laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), and the various facets of photoaging, including erythema/telangiectasia (redness), dyspigmentation (brown discoloration), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths) and poor texture.<ref>Alexiades-Armenakas, M. R., et al. The spectrum of laser skin resurfacing: nonablative, fractional, and ablative laser resurfacing.J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008 May;58(5):719-37; quiz 738-40</ref>

[[Cortisol]] causes degradation of [[collagen]],<ref>http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/107640112/abstract</ref> accelerating skin aging.<ref>http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/ics/2004/00000026/00000002/art00010</ref>

[[Anti-aging supplements]] are used to treat skin aging.

===Photoaging===
{{Main|Photoaging}}
Photoaging has two main concerns: an increased risk for [[skin cancer]] and the appearance of damaged skin. In younger skin, sun damage will heal faster since the cells in the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] have a faster turnover rate, while in the older population the skin becomes thinner and the epidermis turnover rate for cell repair is lower which may result in the [[dermis]] layer being damaged.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gilchrest | first1 = BA | title = Skin aging and photoaging | journal = Dermatology nursing / Dermatology Nurses' Association | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 79–82 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2141531 }}</ref>

== Disease ==
{{details|skin disease}}
Diseases of the skin include [[skin infection]]s and [[skin neoplasm]]s (including skin cancer).

[[Dermatology]] is the branch of [[medicine]] that deals with conditions of the skin.<ref name="lookingbill">Marks, James G; Miller, Jeffery (2006). ''Lookingbill and Marks' Principles of Dermatology'' (4th ed.). Elsevier Inc. ISBN 1-4160-3185-5.</ref>

==Variability in skin tone==
{{Main|Human skin color}}

Human skin shows high skin colour variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white hues. Human skin shows higher variation in colour than any other single mammalian species and is the result of [[natural selection]]. Skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UVR) penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book|last=Muehlenbein|first=Micheal|title=Human Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=192–213}}</ref>

The actual skin colour of different humans is affected by many substances, although the single most important substance determining human skin colour is the pigment [[melanin]]. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called [[melanocyte]]s and it is the main determinant of the skin colour of [[Dark skin|darker-skinned]] humans. The skin colour of people with [[light skin]] is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the [[dermis]] and by the [[haemoglobin]] circulating in the veins of the dermis. The red colour underlying the skin becomes more visible, especially in the face, when, as consequence of [[physical exercise]] or the stimulation of the [[nervous system]] (anger, fear), [[arterioles]] dilate.<ref name=Jabl06>{{cite book|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|title=Skin: a Natural History|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}</ref>

There is a correlation between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that highlight higher amounts of UVR reflect darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer towards the equator. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations.<ref name=webb06>{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=A.R.|title=Who, what, where, and when: influences on cutaneous vitamin D synthesis|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|volume=92|pages=17–25}}</ref>

In the same population it has been observed that adult human [[woman|female]]s are considerably lighter in skin pigmentation than [[man|male]]s. Females need more [[calcium]] during [[pregnancy]] and [[lactation]]. [[Vitamin D]] which is synthesized from sunlight helps absorbing calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin in order to help their bodies absorb more calcium.<ref name=Jabl00>{{cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|coauthors=Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2000|volume=39|pages=57–106}}</ref>

==Skin flora==
{{Main|Skin flora}}

The human skin is a rich environment for microbes.<ref name="Grice"/><ref name="Pappas"/> Around 1000 species of [[bacteria]] from 19 bacterial [[phylum|phyla]] have been found. Most come from only four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%). [[Propionibacteria]] and [[Staphylococci]] species were the main species in [[sebaceous]] areas. There are three main ecological areas: moist, dry and sebaceous. In moist places on the body [[Corynebacteria]] together with [[Staphylococci]] dominate. In dry areas, there is a mixture of species but dominated by b-[[Proteobacteria]] and [[Flavobacteriales]]. Ecologically, sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry ones. The areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between [[finger]]s, the spaces between [[toe]]s, [[axillae]], and [[umbilical cord]] stump. Most similarly were beside the [[nostril]], [[nare]]s (inside
the nostril), and on the back.

Reflecting upon the diversity of the human skin researchers on the human skin [[microbiome]] have observed: "hairy, moist underarms lie a short distance from smooth dry forearms, but these two niches are likely as ecologically dissimilar as rainforests are to deserts."<ref name="Grice"/>

The [[NIH]] has been launched the [[Human Microbiome Project]] to characterize the human microbiota which includes that on the skin and the role of this microbiome in health and disease.<ref>[http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp NIH Human Microbiome Project].</ref>

==Skin layers== <!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Skin layers]]"; please adjust when changing section title -->

'''Skin''' is composed of three primary layers:
*the ''[[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]'', which provides waterproofing and serves as a barrier to infection;
*the ''[[dermis]]'', which serves as a location for the [[appendages]] of skin; and
*the ''[[hypodermis]] (subcutaneous [[adipose]] layer)''.

===Epidermis===
{{main|Epidermis (skin)}}

'''Epidermis''', "epi" coming from the Greek meaning "over" or "upon", is the outermost layer of the skin. It forms the waterproof, protective wrap over the body's surface and is made up of stratified squamous [[epithelium]] with an underlying [[basal lamina]].

The epidermis contains no [[blood vessel]]s, and cells in the deepest layers are nourished by diffusion from blood capillaries extending to the upper layers of the dermis. The main type of cells which make up the epidermis are [[Merkel cell]]s, [[keratinocyte]]s, with [[melanocyte]]s and [[Langerhans cell]]s also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following ''strata'' (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, basale. Cells are formed through [[mitosis]] at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see [[cell division]]) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein [[keratin]] is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off ([[desquamation]]). This process is called ''keratinization'' and takes place within about 27 days. This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and [[pathogens]] out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.

At the bottom are the superficial parts of the dermis. The sweatducts are clearly visible. (See also:&nbsp;[[:Image:HautFingerspitzeOCT.gif|Rotating 3D Version]])]]

====Components====
The epidermis contains no [[blood vessel]]s, and is nourished by [[diffusion]] from the dermis. The main type of cells which make up the epidermis are [[keratinocyte]]s, [[melanocyte]]s, [[Langerhans cell]]s and [[Merkels cell]]s. The epidermis helps the skin to regulate body temperature.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

====Layers====
Epidermis is divided into several layers where cells are formed through [[mitosis]] at the innermost layers. They move up the strata changing shape and composition as they differentiate and become filled with [[keratin]]. They eventually reach the top layer called ''stratum corneum'' and are sloughed off, or desquamated. This process is called ''[[keratinization]]'' and takes place within weeks. The outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells.

====Sublayers====
Epidermis is divided into the following 5 sublayers or strata:

*[[Stratum corneum]]
*[[Stratum lucidum]]
*[[Stratum granulosum]]
*[[Stratum spinosum]]
*[[Stratum germinativum]] (also called "stratum basale").

Blood capillaries are found beneath the epidermis, and are linked to an arteriole and a venule. Arterial shunt vessels may bypass the network in ears, the nose and fingertips.

===Dermis===
{{main|Dermis}}

The '''dermis''' is the layer of skin beneath the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] that consists of [[connective tissue]] and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a [[basement membrane]]. It also harbors many [[mechanoreceptor | nerve endings]] that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains the [[hair follicles]], [[sweat glands]], [[sebaceous glands]], [[apocrine glands]], [[lymphatic vessels]] and [[blood vessels]]. The blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste removal from its own cells as well as from the Stratum basale of the epidermis.

The dermis is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the ''papillary region'', and a deep thicker area known as the ''reticular region''.

====Papillary region====
The papillary region is composed of loose [[areolar connective tissue]]. It is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'', that extend toward the epidermis. The papillae provide the dermis with a "bumpy" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.

In the palms, fingers, soles, and toes, the influence of the papillae projecting into the epidermis forms contours in the skin's surface. These [[epidermal ridges]] occur in patterns (''see:'' [[fingerprint]]) that are genetically and [[epigenetic]]ally determined and are therefore unique to the individual, making it possible to use fingerprints or footprints as a means of [[Forensic identification|identification]].

====Reticular region====
The reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue, and receives its name from the dense concentration of [[collagenous]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and [[reticular]] fibers that weave throughout it. These [[protein]] fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity.

Also located within the reticular region are the [[roots of the hair]], [[sebaceous glands]], [[sweat glands]], [[Cutaneous receptor|receptors]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], and blood vessels.

Tattoo ink is held in the dermis. Stretch marks from pregnancy are also located in the dermis.

===Hypodermis===

The hypodermis is not part of the skin, and lies below the dermis. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and [[muscle]] as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue and elastin. The main cell types are [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[adipocyte]]s (the hypodermis contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.

Microorganisms like ''[[Staphylococcus]] epidermidis'' colonize the skin surface. The density of skin flora depends on region of the skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from bacteria residing in the deeper areas of the hair follicle, gut and urogenital openings.

==Permeability==

Human skin has a low [[Permeation|permeability]], that is, most foreign substances are unable to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is an effective barrier to most [[inorganic]] nanosized particles.<ref name = "Baroli">Baroli, B. Penetration of Nanoparticles and Nanomaterials in the Skin: Fiction or Reality? Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 2009 December;99:21-50</ref><ref name="Felipe">Felipe, P., Silva, J.N., Silva, R., Cirne de Castro, J.L., Gomes, M., Alves, L.C., et al. Stratum Corneum Is an Effective Carrier to TiO2 and ZnO Nanoparticle Percutaneous Absorption. [[Skin Pharmacology and Physiology]] 2009;22:266-275</ref> This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to come into contact with internal tissues. However in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in [[nanomedicine]] and [[biology]] to increase skin permeability. One application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where [[nanoparticles]] can interact directly with cells that have lost their growth-control mechanisms ([[Cancer|cancer cells]]). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.

===Nanoparticles===

Nanoparticles 40&nbsp;nm in diameter and smaller have been successful in penetrating the skin.<ref name="Vogt">Vogt, A., Combadiere, B., Hadam, S., Stieler, K., Lademann, J., Schaefer, H., et al. 40nm, but not 750 or 1,500 nm, Nanoparticles Enter Epidermal CD1a+ Cells after Transcutaneous Application on Human Skin.

The permeability of skin relative to different shapes of nanoparticles has also been studied. Research has shown that spherical particles have a better ability to penetrate the skin compared to [[rectangle|oblong]] (ellipsoidal) particles because spheres are symmetric in all three spacial dimensions.<ref name ="Ryman"/> One study compared the two shapes and recorded data that showed spherical particles located deep in the epidermis and dermis whereas ellipsoidal particles were mainly found in the stratum corneum and epidermal layers.<ref name ="Ryman"/> [[Nanorods]] are used in experiments because of their unique [[fluorescent]] properties but have shown mediocre penetration.

Toxicology 2009 September;255:33-37</ref> [[Cadmium selenide]] (CdSe) [[quantum dots]] have proven to penetrate very effectively when they have certain properties. Because CdSe is toxic to living organisms, the particle must be covered in a surface group. An experiment comparing the permeability of quantum dots coated in [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG), PEG-[[amine]], and [[carboxylic acid]] concluded the PEG and PEG-amine surface groups allowed for the greatest penetration of particles. The carboxylic acid coated particles did not penetrate past the stratum corneum.<ref name ="Ryman"/>

===Increasing permeability===

Scientists previously believed that the skin was an effective barrier to inorganic particles. Damage from mechanical stressors was believed to be the only way to increase its permeability.<ref name="Mortensen1">Mortensen, L., Oberdorster, G., Pentland, A. and DeLoiuse, L. In Vivo Skin Penetration of Quantum Dot Nanoparticles in the Murine Model: The Effects of UVR. Nano Letters 2008;8(9):2779-2787</ref> Recently, however, simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin permeabiltiy have been developed. For example, [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UVR) has been used to slightly damage the surface of skin, causing a time-dependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles.<ref name="Mortensen2">Mortensen, L., Zheng, H., Faulknor, R., De Benedetto, A., Beck, L., DeLouise, L.A. Increased in vivo skin penetration of quantum dots with UVR and in vitro quantum dot cytotoxicity. Colloidal Quantum Dots for Biomedical Applications IV 2009;7189:1605</ref> The UVR’s high energy causes a restructuring of cells, weakening the boundary between the stratum corneum and the epidermal layer.<ref name="Mortensen1"/><ref name="Mortensen2"/> The damage of the skin is typically measured by the [[transepidermal water loss]] (TEWL), though it may take 3–5 days for the TEWL to reach its peak value. When the TEWL reaches its highest value, the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to permeate the skin. Studies confirm that UVR damaged skin significantly increases the permeability.<ref name="Mortensen1"/><ref name="Mortensen2"/> The effects of increased permeability after UVR exposure can lead to an increase in the number of particles that permeate the skin. However, the specific permeability of skin after UVR exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined.<ref name="Mortensen2"/>

Other skin damaging methods used to increase nanoparticle penetration include tape stripping, [[abrasion (medical)|skin abrasion]], and chemical enhancement. Tape stripping is the process in which tape is applied to skin then lifted to remove the top layer of skin. Skin abrasion is done by shaving the top 5-10 micrometers off the surface of the skin. Chemical enhancement is the process in which chemicals such as [[polyvinylpyrrolidone]] (PVP), [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO), and [[oleic acid]] are applied to the surface of the skin to increase permeability.<ref>Sokolov, K., Follen M., Aaron, J., Pavlova, I., Malpica, A., Lotan, R., et al. Real-Time Vital Optical Imaging of Precancer Using Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Antibodies Conjugated to Gold Nanoparticles. Cancer Research 2003 May;63:199</ref><ref name = "Mark">Prausnitz, M., Mitragotri, S. and Langer, R. Current Status and Future Potential of Transdermal Drug Delivery. Drug Discovery 2004 February;3:115-124</ref>

[[Electroporation]] is the application of short pulses of [[electric fields]] on skin and has proven to increase skin permeability. The pulses are high voltage and on the order of milliseconds when applied. [[Electric charge|Charged molecules]] penetrate the skin more frequently than neutral molecules after the skin has been exposed to electric field pulses. Results have shown molecules on the order of 100 [[micrometers]] to easily permeate electroporated skin.<ref name = "Mark"/>

===Applications===

A large area of interest in nanomedicine is the [[transdermal patch]] because of the possibility of a painless application of therapeutic agents with very few side effects. Transdermal patches have been limited to administer a small number of drugs, such as [[nicotine]], because of the limitations in permeability of the skin. Development of techniques that increase skin permeability has led to more drugs that can be applied via transdermal patches and more options for patients.<ref name = "Mark"/>

Increasing the permeability of skin allows nanoparticles to penetrate and target [[cancer]] cells. Nanoparticles along with [[Medical imaging|multi-modal imaging]] techniques have been used as a way to diagnose cancer [[non-invasive]]ly. Skin with high permeability allowed quantum dots with an [[antibody]] attached to the surface for active targeting to successfully penetrate and identify cancerous [[tumors]] in mice. Tumor targeting is beneficial because the particles can be excited using [[fluorescence microscopy]] and emit light energy and heat that will destroy cancer cells.<ref>Gao, X., Cui, Y., Levenson, R., Chung, L. and Nie, S. In vivo cancer targeting and imaging with semiconductor quantum dots. Nature Biotechnology 2005;22(8):969-976</ref>

===Sunblock and sunscreen===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
Although some believe that sunblock and sunscreen are both the same, they are not, although they have similar properties and are both important in caring of the skin.

'''Sunblock'''
Sunblock is opaque and is stronger than sunscreen since it is able to block majority of the UVA/UVB rays and radiation from the sun, thus not having to be reapplied several times a day. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are two of the important ingredients in sunblock.

'''Sunscreen'''
Sunscreen is more transparent once applied to the skin and also has the ability to protect against UVA/UVB rays as well, although the sunscreen's ingredients have the ability to break down at a faster rate once exposed to sunlight, and some of the radiation is able to penetrate to the skin. In order for sunscreen to be more effective it is necessary to consistently reapply and use a higher spf.

===Nutrition for healthy skin===

[[Vitamin A]], also known as [[retinoids]], benefits the skin by normalizing [[keratinization]], downregulating [[sebum]] production which contributes to [[acne]], and reversing and treating photodamage, striae, and [[cellulite]].

[[Vitamin D]] and analogs are used to downregulate the cutaneous immune system and epithelial proliferation while promoting differentiation.

[[Vitamin C]] is an [[antioxidant]] that regulates collagen synthesis, forms barrier lipids, regenerates vitamin E, and provides photoprotection.

[[Vitamin E]] is a membrane antioxidant that protects against oxidative damage and also provides protection against harmful [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays.
