An '''equianalgesic''' (or [[opioid|narcotic]]) chart is a conversion chart that lists equivalent doses of
[[analgesic]]s (drugs used to relieve pain). Equianalgesic charts are used for calculation of an equivalent dose (a dose which would offer an equal amount of [[analgesia]]) between different analgesics.<ref>{{Cite book | ref=harv | title=Palliative medicine secrets | last=Joishy | first=S.

==Format==

Equianalgesic tables are available in different formats, such as pocket-sized cards for ease of reference.<ref>{{Harvnb | Joishy | 1999 | p=97}}</ref> A frequently-seen format has the drug names in the left column, the route of administration in the center columns and any notes in the right column.<ref>{{Cite book | ref=harv | title=Demystifying Opioid Conversion Calculations: A Guide for Effective Dosing | last=McPherson | first=Mary Lynn M. | year=2000 | publisher=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc. | location=Bethesda, MD | page=5 | isbn=1-58528-198-0}}</ref>

==Purpose==

There are several reasons for switching a patient to a different pain medication. These include practical considerations such as lower cost or unavailability of a drug at the patient's preferred pharmacy, or medical reasons such as lack of effectiveness of the current drug or to minimize adverse effects. Some patients request to be switched to a different narcotic due to stigma associated with a particular drug (i.e. a patient refusing [[methadone]] due to its association with [[opioid]] [[Methadone maintenance|addiction treatment]]).<ref>{{Harvnb | McPherson | 2000 | p=3}}</ref> Equianalgesic charts are also used when calculating an equivalent dosage of the same drug, but with a different [[route of administration]].

==Precautions==
Equianalgesic chart are a useful tool, but the user must take care to correct for all relevant variables such as route of administration, [[cross tolerance]], [[half-life]] and the [[bioavailability]] of a drug.<ref>{{Harvnb | McPherson | 2000 | p=4}}</ref> For example, the narcotic [[levorphanol]] is 4–8 times [[Potency (pharmacology)|stronger]] than [[morphine]], but also has a much longer half-life. Simply switching the patient from 40&nbsp;mg of morphine to 10&nbsp;mg of levorphanol would be dangerous due to dose accumulation, and hence frequency of administration should also be taken into account.

There are other concerns about equianalgesic charts. Many charts derive their data from studies conducted on opioid-naïve patients. Patients with [[Chronic pain|chronic]] (rather than acute) pain may respond differently to analgesia. Repeated administration of a medication is also different from single dosing, as many drugs have active metabolites that can build up in the body.<ref>{{Harvnb | McPherson | 2000 | p=8}}</ref> Patient variables such as sex, age, and organ function may also influence the effect of the drug on the system. These variables are rarely included in equianalgesic charts.<ref>{{Harvnb | McPherson | 2000 | p=9}}</ref>
