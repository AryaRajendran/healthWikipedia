'''Salpingectomy''' refers to the surgical removal of a [[Fallopian tube]]. It is often related to tubal pregnancies and is a procedure that is preferred over its ovarian tube-sparing counterparts due to the high rate of recurrence in said ectopic pregnancies. 

==Indications==
The procedure was first performed by [[Lawson Tait]] in 1883 in patients with a bleeding [[ectopic pregnancy]]; this procedure has since saved the lives of countless women. Other indications for a salpingectomy include infected tubes, (as in a [[hydrosalpinx]]) or as part of the surgical procedure for tubal cancer.

A bilateral salpingectomy will lead to [[infertility|sterility]], and was used for that purpose, however less invasive procedures have become available as [[tubal ligation|tubal occlusion procedure]]s.

==Process==
Salpingectomy has traditionally been done via a [[laparotomy]]; more recently however, [[laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] salpingectomies have become more common as part of [[minimally invasive surgery]]. The tube is severed at the point where it enters the [[uterus]] and along its mesenteric edge with hemostatic control.

==Related procedures==
===Salpingo-oophorectomy===
Salpingectomy is commonly done as part of a procedure called a '''salpingo-[[oophorectomy]]''', where one or both [[ovary|ovaries]], as well as one or both Fallopian tubes, are removed in one operation (a ''Bilateral'' Salpingo-Oophorectomy (BSO) if both ovaries and Fallopian tubes are removed).  If a BSO is combined with a [[hysterectomy]], the procedure is commonly called a TAH-BSO: Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with a Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy.

===Salpingostomy / Salpingotomy===
Salpingectomy is different from a '''salpingostomy''' and '''salpingotomy'''. The latter two terms are often used interchangeably and refer to creating an opening into the tube (e.g. to remove an [[ectopic pregnancy]]), but the tube itself is not removed.<ref name="pmid12611098">{{cite journal |author=Pal L, Parkash V, Rutherford TJ |title=Omental trophoblastic implants and hemoperitoneum after laparoscopic salpingostomy for ectopic pregnancy.

==History==
Salpingectomies were performed in the United States in the early 20th century in accordance with eugenics legislation. From ''[[Buck v. Bell]]''(1927): 
<blockquote>
The Virginia statute providing for the sexual sterilization of inmates of institutions supported by the State who shall be found to be afflicted with an hereditary form of insanity or imbecility, is within the power of the State under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0274_0200_ZS.html Buck v. Bell<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

''Buck v. Bell'' while not expressly overturned, was implicitly overturned by ''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma]]'' (1942), in which the Court held that a person's choices whether to aid in the propagation of the human species was a cognizable fundamental right guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, a liberty retained by the people under the 9th Amendment of the Constitution.
