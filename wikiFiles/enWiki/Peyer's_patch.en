'''Peyer's patches''' (or '''aggregated lymphoid nodules''') are organized lymphoid nodules, named after the 17th-century [[Swiss]] anatomist [[Johann Conrad Peyer]]. They are aggregations of lymphoid tissue that are usually found in the lowest portion of the [[small intestine]], the [[ileum]], in humans; as such, they differentiate the ileum from the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]]. The duodenum can be identified by [[Brunner's glands]]. The jejunum has neither Brunner's glands nor Peyer's Patches.

==Location and appearance==
Peyer's patches are observable as elongated thickenings of the intestinal epithelium measuring a few centimeters in length. About 30 are found in humans. Microscopically, Peyerâ€™s patches appear as oval or round lymphoid follicles (similar to [[lymph nodes]]) located in the [[lamina propria]] layer of the [[mucosa]] and extending into the submucosa of the [[ileum]].

In adults, B lymphocytes are seen to predominate in the follicles' germinal centers.  T lymphocytes are found in the zones between follicles.

==Function==
Because the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] is exposed to the external environment, much of it is populated with potentially [[pathogen]]ic [[microorganism]]s. Peyer's patches thus establish their importance in the immune surveillance of the intestinal lumen and in facilitating the generation of the immune response within the [[mucosa]].  

Pathogenic microorganisms and other [[antigen]]s entering the intestinal tract encounter [[macrophages]], [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B-cells|B-lymphocytes]], and [[T-lymphocytes]] found in Peyer's patches and other [[Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue|Mucosa Associated Lymphatic Tissue]] (MALT). 

Peyer's patches are covered by a special epithelium that contains specialized cells called microfold cells ([[M cells]]) which sample antigen directly from the lumen and deliver it to [[antigen-presenting cells]] (located in a unique pocket-like structure on their basolateral side). [[T cells]], [[B-cell]]s and memory cells are stimulated upon encountering [[antigen]] in Peyer's patches. These cells then pass to the mesenteric lymph nodes where the immune response is amplified. Activated lymphocytes pass into the blood stream via the [[thoracic duct]] and travel to the gut where they carry out their final effector functions.

==Pathology==
Although important in the immune response, excessive growth of lymphoid tissue in Peyer's patches is pathologic, as [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] of Peyer's patches has been closely associated with idiopathic [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]].

The hypertrophy of Peyer's patches has also been associated with susceptibility to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (commonly known as [[prion diseases]]).
