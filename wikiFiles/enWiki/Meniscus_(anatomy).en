In [[anatomy]], a '''meniscus''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μηνίσκος|μηνίσκος]] ''meniskos'', "crescent"<ref>μηνίσκος, "small moon", is diminutive of μήνη, "moon", from the root ma-, "measure", which reflects the fact the time was measured according to the phases of the moon.  The word was also used for curved things in general, such as a necklace or a line of battle. (''Lexicon of Orthopaedic Etymology'', p 199)</ref>) is a crescent-shaped [[fibrocartilage|fibrocartilaginous]] structure that, in contrast to [[articular disk]]s, only partly divides a joint cavity.<ref name="Platzer-208">Platzer (2004), p 208</ref> In [[human]]s it is present in the [[knee]], [[acromioclavicular joint|acromioclavicular]], [[sternoclavicular joint|sternoclavicular]], and [[temporomandibular joint]]s;<ref>''Meniscus'', Stedman's (27th ed.)</ref> in other organisms they may be present in other joints (e.g., between the [[forearm]] bones of [[bird]]s). A small meniscus also occurs in the [[radio-carpal joint]].

It usually refers to either of two specific parts of [[cartilage]] of the knee: The [[lateral meniscus|lateral]] and [[medial meniscus|medial menisci]]. Both are [[Cartilaginous#Fibrocartilage|cartilaginous]] tissues that provide structural integrity to the knee when it undergoes [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] and [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]]. The menisci are also known as 'semi-lunar' cartilages&nbsp;— referring to their half-moon "C" shape&nbsp;— a term which has been largely dropped by the medical profession, but which led to the menisci being called knee 'cartilages' by the lay public.

== Anatomy ==

The menisci of the knee joint are two pads of [[Cartilaginous#Fibrocartilage|cartilaginous]] tissue which serve to disperse friction in the [[knee]] joint between the lower leg ([[tibia]]) and the thigh ([[femur]]).  They are shaped [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] on the top and flat on the bottom, articulating with the tibia.  They are attached to the small depressions ([[Fossa (anatomy)|fossa]]e) between the condyles of the tibia (intercondyloid fossa), and towards the center they are unattached and their shape narrows to a thin shelf.<ref name="Gray-7b">Gray's (1918), 7b</ref>

== Function ==

The menisci act to disperse the weight of the body and reduce friction during movement.  Since the condyles of the femur and tibia meet at one point (which changes during [[flexion]] and [[Human anatomical terms#Types of movement|extension]]), the menisci spread the load of the body's weight.<ref>Cluett, ''Meniscus Tear&nbsp;— Torn Cartilage''</ref> This differs from [[sesamoid bone]]s, which are made of [[osseous tissue]] and whose function primarily is to protect the nearby tendon and to increase its mechanical effect.

== Injury ==

In [[sport]]s and [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedics]], people will sometimes speak of "torn cartilage" and actually be referring to an injury to one of the menisci.

The [[Unhappy Triad]] is a set of commonly co-occurring knee injuries which includes injury to the medial meniscus.

Two surgeries are most common of the meniscus. Depending on location, age, and doctor's preference, people usually either repair it or remove a part or all of it (meniscectomy). Each has its advantages and disadvantages.
