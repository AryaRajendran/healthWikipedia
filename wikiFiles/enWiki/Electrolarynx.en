An '''electrolarynx''', sometimes referred to as a "throat back", is a medical device about the size of a small electric razor used to produce clearer [[Speech communication|speech]] by those who have lost their original [[Larynx|voicebox]], usually due to [[cancer of the larynx]]. The most common device is a handheld, battery operated device placed under the [[Human mandible|mandible]] which produces vibrations and allow speech.<ref>{{cite web|last=Department of Otolaryngology|title=Electrolaryngeal Speech|url=http://www.evmsent.org/electrolarynx.asp|publisher=Eastern Virginia Medical School|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>  Earlier non-electric devices were called mechanical larynxes. Along with developing esophageal voice, robotic voice or undergoing a surgical procedure, the electrolarynx serves as a mode of speech recovery for [[laryngectomy]] patients.

==Overview==
Initially, the [[pneumatic]] mechanical larynx was developed in the 1920s by [[Western Electric]], which did not run on [[electricity]], and was flawed in that it produced a weak voice. Electrolarynxes were introduced in the 1940s, at a time when [[Esophageal speech|esophageal voice]] was being promoted as the best course in speech recovery; however, since that technique is difficult to master, the electrolarynx became quite popular. Since then, many medical procedures, such as the [[tracheo-oesophageal puncture]], were created to enable speech without continued dependence on a handheld device.

The use of an electrolarynx can cause some social issues including difficulty ordering a drink in a noisy pub<ref name="SECLSG"/>, and, when answering a telephone, the caller responds "Is this a computer that I'm speaking to?"<ref name="NPR"/>  One user states {{Quote|People are really very kind once they realize what the situation is. I may go into a restaurant once, and if I go back there a year later, and it's the same woman at the front desk, she'll say, 'Where have you been? We haven't seen you for a while.' So, I feel like a movie star... <br>I'm really very blessed in my life. I am happier now, without my voice, than I've ever been with my voice. It's a small price to pay for being alive and enjoying life. So I am very happy where I am now.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web
