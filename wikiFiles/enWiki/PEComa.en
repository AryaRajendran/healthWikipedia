In [[oncology]], '''PEComa''', also '''PEC tumour''' and '''perivascular epithelioid cell tumour''', is a family of [[mesenchymal tumour]]s consisting of [[peri-|peri]][[vascular]] epithelioid [[cell (biology)|cell]]s (PECs).<ref name=martignoni>{{cite journal |author=Martignoni G, Pea M, Reghellin D, Zamboni G, Bonetti F |title=PEComas: the past, the present and the future |journal=Virchows Arch. |volume=452 |issue=2 |pages=119–32 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18080139 |pmc=2234444 |doi=10.1007/s00428-007-0509-1 |url=}}</ref> These are rare tumours that can occur in any part of the human body.

The cell type from which these tumours originate remains unknown. Normally, no perivascular epitheloid cells exist; the name refers to the characteristics of the tumour when examined under the microscope.<ref name="HumanPathology2009">{{cite journal |last=Folpe |first=AL |authorlink= |coauthors=Kwiatkowski DJ |year=2009 |title=Perivascular epitheloid cell neoplasms: pathology and pathogenesis |journal=Human Pathology |url= |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | pmid = 19604538 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1016/j.humpath.2009.05.011 }}</ref>

Establishing the malignant potential of these tumours remains challenging although criteria<ref name="criteria">{{cite journal |last=Folpe AL, Mentzel T, Lehr HA, Fisher C, Balzer BL, Weiss SW |year=2005 |month=Dec |title=Perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms of soft tissue and gynecologic origin: a clinicopathologic study of 26 cases and review of the literature |journal= Am J Surg Pathol |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=1558–75 |first1=AL |last2=Mentzel |first2=T |last3=Lehr |first3=HA |last4=Fisher |first4=C |last5=Balzer |first5=BL |last6=Weiss |first6=SW  | pmid = 16327428 }}</ref> have been suggested; some PEComas display malignant features whereas others can cautiously be labeled as having 'uncertain malignant potential'.<ref name="HumanPathology2009"/> The most common tumours in the PEComa family are [[renal]] [[angiomyolipoma]] and [[pulmonary]] [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]], both of which are more common in patients with [[tuberous sclerosis complex]]. The genes responsible for this multi-system genetic disease have also been implicated in other PEComas.<ref name="HumanPathology2009"/>

Many PEComa types shows a female predominance in the sex ratio.

==Histologic appearance==
PECs consist of perivascular [[epithelioid]] cells with a clear/granular [[cytoplasm]] and central round nucleus without prominent [[nucleoli]].

==Immunohistochemical markers==
PECs typically stain for melanocytic markers ([[HMB-45]], [[Melan A]] (Mart 1), [[Mitf]]) and myogenic markers ([[actin]], [[myosin]], [[calponin]]).

==PECs and other conditions==
PECs bear significant [[histologic]] and [[immunohistochemical]] similarity to:
*[[angiomyolipoma]],
*clear-cell sugar tumour (CCST),
*[[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]], and,
*clear-cell myomelanocytic tumour of [[ligamentum teres]]/[[falciform ligament]].
*abdominopelvic sarcoma of perivascular epitheloid cells<ref name="HumanPathology2009"/>
*primary extrapulmonary sugar tumour<ref name="HumanPathology2009"/>
Thus, it has been advocated that the above could be classified PEComas.<ref name=martignoni/>

==Etiology==
The precursor cell of PEComas is currently unknown; there is no normal counterpart "perivascular epitheloid cell".<ref name=martignoni/>  Genetically, PECs are linked to the [[tuberous sclerosis]] [[gene]]s [[TSC1]] and [[TSC2]], although this link is stronger for angiomyolipoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis than for other members of the PEComa family.

==Differential diagnosis==
PEComas are rare and can have myriad features; therefore, they can be confused with [[carcinoma]]s, [[smooth muscle tumour]]s, [[adipocyte|adipocytic]] tumours, clear cell [[sarcoma]]s, [[melanoma]]s and [[gastrointestinal stromal tumour]]s (GIST).<ref name="HumanPathology2009"/>
