'''Persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis''' (PPBL) is very rare anomaly of the human [[immune system]] characterized by mildly elevated levels of white blood cells (called [[leukocytosis]]), chronic, stable absolute [[polyclonal]] [[B-cell]] [[lymphocytosis]], elevated polyclonal [[IgM]] and [[binucleated]] cells. 

Although cases of non-smoking women or men have been reported, patients are predominantly young smoking women.

==Signs and symptoms==
Ten percent of patients present with [[splenomegaly]] and [[lymphadenopathy]]. Some patients report a varying degree of fatigue, consistent with a [[chronic fatigue syndrome]],<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05579.x|last=Mitterer|first=M|coauthors=Pescosta et al|title=Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus disease in a case of persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis|journal=Br J Haematol|year=1995|month=July|volume=90|issue=3|pages=526–31|pmid=7646989}}</ref> or postviral fatigue as seen in EBV infections while others remain asymptomic.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0145-2126(00)00069-2|last=Tonelli|first1=S|coauthors=Petronilla et al|title=Persistent polyclonal B lymphocytosis: morphological, immunological, cytogenetic and molecular analysis of an Italian case|journal=Leuk Res.|year=2000|month=October|volume=24|issue=10|pages=877–9|pmid=10996207}}</ref>  

==Molecular and immunological analysis==
Genetically, PPBL has been associated with a few unusual genetic characteristics.  Among them, it is associated with a particular genetic variant of the [[human leukocyte antigen]] called [[HLA-DR7]].  This variant is normally present in 26% in the Caucasian population. [[Chromosome]] analysis has detected an isochromosome +i(3q), with or without premature chromosome condensation. Also, a t(14;18)(q22;21) bcl-2/IgH rearrangement has been described, as usually seen in [[follicular lymphoma]]. 

Immunologically, peripheral B-cells show more functional IgD+ positive [[CD27]] cells than usual.

==Prognosis==
In the followup of 111 patients, most remained stable and event free. However, two patients developed IgM gammopathy 2 lung cancer; one developed cervical cancer and three developed non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma. The possibility of developing  a clonal proliferation, malignant lymphoma or secondary solid cancer led the authors to conclude not to classify  PPBL as a benign pathology, as has been previously postulated but rather to recommend a careful and continued clinical and biological longterm follow-up.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/leu.2008.208|last=Cornet|first=E|coauthors=Lesesve JF et al.|title=Long-term follow-up of 111 patients with persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis with binucleated lymphocytes|journal=Leukemia|year=2009|month=February|volume=23|issue=2|pages=419–22|pmid=18668130|pmc=2685812}}</ref>
