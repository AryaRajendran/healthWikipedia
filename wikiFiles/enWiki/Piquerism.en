==Examples==

===Andrei Chikatilo===
[[Andrei Chikatilo]] was [[impotent]] and could only get sexual arousal through stabbing and cutting people with a knife.

===Jack the Ripper===
Dr. [[Robert D. Keppel]] and his colleagues concluded in an analysis of [[London]]'s [[Jack the Ripper]] murders of 1888 that "the injuries sustained by the victims displayed the signature characteristic of picquerism."

===Albert Fish===

Notorious [[serial killer]] [[Albert Fish]] has been said to have engaged in piquerism upon his victims and his own body, [[flagellation|flagellating]] himself constantly with a nail-studded board. After his arrest and subsequent jailing for the murder of Grace Budd, an [[X-Ray]] revealed at least 29 [[Sewing needle|needles]] that were inserted into his groin. However, this is actually a condition called [[infibulation]]. Infibulation is the purposeful use of sharp objects such as pins, needles, and piercings, in the genital area for sexual pleasure and pain.
