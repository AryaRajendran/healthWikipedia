IMPORTANT NOTE TO EDITORS

As per the discussion in the Talk page, there has been no consensus as to using the American (gynecology) or British (gynaecology) spelling for this article, BUT:

* As per Nightstallion's reasoning (see the green box), the article will stick to the British spelling.

* As per WP:MOS#National-varieties_of_English, the earliest available version of the article ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Obstetrics_and_Gynecology&oldid=75573 ) used British spellings and was not a stub (note that an earlier version is unavailable because of the Phase III switch).

You are therefore discouraged to move this article from its British spelling without first opening a move discussion in WP:RM .

'''[[Obstetrics]] and [[gynaecology]]''' (or '''obstetrics and gynecology'''; often abbreviated to '''OB/GYN''', '''OBG''', '''O&G''' or '''Obs & Gynae''') are the two [[surgery|surgical]]–medical specialties dealing with the female reproductive organs in their [[obstetrics|pregnant]] and [[gynaecology|non-pregnant state]], respectively, and as such are often combined to form a single [[medical specialty]] and postgraduate training programme. This combined training prepares the practicing OB/GYN to be adept at the surgical management of the entire scope of clinical pathology involving female reproductive organs, and to provide care for both [[pregnancy|pregnant]] and non-pregnant patients. In [[veterinary medicine]], [[theriogenology]] is the more commonly used term that also includes [[andrology]].

==Training==
The training for physicians in this field is quite long: in [[Australia]], for example, the [[medical residency|residency]] training period is among the longest at six years, matched only by [[neurosurgery]] and [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|maxillofacial surgery]]. In the UK, training lasts seven years. In the [[United States]], four years in [[residency (medicine)|residency]] are required for [[Doctor of Medicine|MDs]] and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DOs]]. In [[India]], post graduate training in [[obstetrics]] and [[gynaecology]] is in the form of a two-year diploma course (DGO) or a three-year ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] or [[Master of Science|MS]]). Some OB/GYN surgeons elect to do further subspecialty training in programs known as fellowships after completing their residency training, although the majority choose to enter private or academic practice as general OB/GYNs. Fellowship training can range from one to four years in duration, and usually have a research component involved with the clinical and operative training.

All gynaecologists are trained obstetricians, although the reverse is not necessarily true. However, some OB/GYNs may choose to drop the obstetric component of their practice and focus solely on gynaecology, especially as they get older. This decision is often based on the double burden of very late hours and, depending on the country, high rates of [[malpractice|litigation]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

This combined training prepares the practicing OB/GYN to be adept at the surgical management of the entire scope of clinical pathology involving female reproductive organs, and to provide care for both pregnant and non-pregnant patient.
A bachelors degree is the minimum formal education required.

==Subspecialties==
Examples of subspecialty training available to physicians in the US are:

*[[Maternal-fetal medicine]]&nbsp;– an [[Obstetrics|obstetrical]] subspecialty, sometimes referred to as perinatology, that focuses on the medical and surgical management of high-risk pregnancies and surgery on the fetus with the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality.
* [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility]]&nbsp;– a subspecialty that focuses on the biological causes and interventional treatment of infertility
*Gynaecological oncology&nbsp;– a gynaecologic subspecialty focusing on the medical and surgical treatment of women with [[cancers]] of the reproductive organs
*[[urogynecology|Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery]]&nbsp;– a gynaecologic subspecialty focusing on the diagnosis and surgical treatment of women with [[urinary incontinence]] and [[prolapse]] of the pelvic organs. Sometimes referred to by laypersons as "[[Female urology]]"
*Advanced [[Laparoscopy|laparoscopic surgery]]
*[[Family planning]]&nbsp;– a gynaecologic subspecialty offering training in [[contraception]] and pregnancy termination ([[abortion]])
*Paediatric and adolescent gynaecology
*[[Menopause|Menopausal]] and [[Geriatrics|geriatric]] gynaecology

Of these, only the first four are truly recognized sub-specialties by the Accredited Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG). The other subspecialties are recognized as informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a board-certified subspecialist by the [[American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology]], a practitioner must have completed an ACGME or AOA-accredited residency and obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.<ref>[http://www.abog.org Welcome to the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Web Site: Certification of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aobog.org/pages/eligibility |title=Eligibility/Board Eligibility |author= |date=2012 |work= |publisher=American Osteopathic Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology |accessdate=19 September 2012 }}</ref>

Additionally, physicians of other specialties may become trained in [[Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics]] (ALSO), a short certification that equips them to better manage emergent OB/GYN situations.

Journals whose scope specifically is within any of the subspecialties of obstetrics and gynaecology are listed in the main articles of these.

In addition, journals with more specific scope, yet not specific to any of the main subspecialties of obstetrics and gynaecology include:
*[[Placenta (journal)|Placenta]], the official journal of ''The International Federation of Placenta Associations''

==Recent shortage in US==
From 2000 through 2004, American medical students were increasingly choosing not to specialize in obstetrics.<ref>Bower, Amanda, "Today’s Lesson: Switch Specialty." ''Time''. June 9, 2003. Vol. 161, Issue 23, p. 58, 1/2p, 1c.</ref> This led to a critical shortage of obstetricians in some states and often fewer health care options for women&nbsp;— although it did not lead to higher average salaries.<ref>[http://www.medicaleconomics.com/memag/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=112482 Physicians' Earnings: Our exclusive survey]</ref> However, beginning in 2004, increasing state legislation mandating [[tort reform]] combined with the ACGME's decision to limit resident work hours led to a gradual resurgence in the number of medical students choosing OB/GYN as a specialty. In the [[residency (medicine)|medical residency]] match for 2007, only six spots in OB/GYN training programmes remained vacant throughout the entire [[United States]]; a record low number, and one that puts OB/GYN on par in terms of  competitiveness with some other surgical specialties.<ref>[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/data_tables.html NRMP: Selected Data Tables 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
