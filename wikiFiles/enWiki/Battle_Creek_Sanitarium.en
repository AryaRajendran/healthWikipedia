The '''Battle Creek Sanitarium''' in [[Battle Creek]], [[Michigan]], United States, was a health resort based on the health principles advocated by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], most notably associated with John Harvey Kellogg. The complex was purchased by the U.S. Army during World War II and converted into the '''[[Percy Jones Army Hospital]]'''. The facility later became the '''[[Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center]]'''. 

==History==
It first opened on September 5, 1866, as the '''Western Health Reform Institute'''. In 1876, [[John Harvey Kellogg]] became the superintendent, and his brother, [[W. K. Kellogg]], worked as the bookkeeper. In 1878, a new structure was built on the site, but it burned down in 1902. The following year, it was rebuilt, enlarged and renamed The Battle Creek Sanitarium. As Kellogg put it, they took the word "[[sanatorium]]", which back then was defined as an English term designating a health resort for invalid soldiers. "A change of two letters transformed 'sanatorium' to 'sanitarium', and a new word was added to the English language". Kellogg states the number of patients grew from 106 in 1866, to 7,006 patrons during the year 1906.<ref name="Kellog1908">{{cite book | title=The Battle Creek Sanitarium System. History, Organisation, Methods |url=http://www.archive.org/details/battlecreeksani00kellgoog| last= Kellogg| first= J.H., M.D., ''Superintendent'' | edition= | year=1908 | publisher=Battle Creek| location= Michigan| page=13|accessdate=October 30, 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)</ref> "The San" and Kellogg were lampooned in [[T. Coraghessan Boyle]]'s 1993 novel ''[[The Road to Wellville]]'', and the 1994 [[The Road to Wellville (film)|film adaptation]].

===Guests, staff, and buildings===
Along with high numbers of patrons, there were a large number of staff at Battle Creek. Kellogg stated that "at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, the number of persons employed is never less than eight hundred, and often rises in the busiest season to more than one thousand".<ref name="Kellog190821-23">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), pp.21–23 (p.22 contains photographs)</ref> They comprised "physicians, nurses, helpers etc".<ref name="Kellog190829">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.29</ref> (There were 30 physicians on staff).<ref name="Kellog190837">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.37</ref> The main buildings comprised four large buildings, chief of which was the central structure, "which affords rooming accommodations for about 400 guests...(and)...treatment rooms capable of handling more than 1,000 patients"<ref name="Kellog190823">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.23</ref>

The sanitarium became a destination for both prominent and middle-class American citizens. Celebrated American figures who visited the sanitarium (including [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] and [[Sojourner Truth]]) would influence and encourage enthusiasm for health and wellness among the general population. "Battle Creek Sanitarium was world renowned and became the 'in' place for the rich and famous to seek their lost health, to listen to health lectures and to learn and practice the principles of a healthy lifestyle".<ref name="sanitariumhistory">{{cite web |title= Sanitarium – Our History | url=http://www.sanitarium.co.nz/about-us/our-history | accessdate=December 22, 2010}}</ref>

===Therapeutic system===
At the sanitarium, Kellogg explored various treatments for his patients, including diet reform and frequent [[enemas]]. He encouraged a low-fat, low-protein diet with an emphasis on whole grains, fiber-rich foods, and most importantly, nuts. Kellogg also recommended a daily intake of fresh air, exercise, and the importance of hygiene. Many of the theories of John Harvey Kellogg were later published in his book ''The Road to Wellness''.

Kellogg described the Sanitarium system as "a composite physiologic method comprising [[hydrotherapy]], [[phototherapy]], [[thermotherapy]], [[electrotherapy]], [[mechanotherapy]], [[dietetics]], [[physical culture]], cold-air cure, and [[Health education|health training]]". To assist with diagnostics and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, various measures of physiological integrity were utilised to obtain numerous vital coefficients "especially in relation to the integrity and efficiency of the blood, the heart, the lungs, the liver, the kidneys, stomach, intestines, brain, nerves and muscles".<ref name="Kellog19088">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.8</ref>{{Ref_label|a|a|none}}

====Hydrotherapy====
Hydrotherapy was widely utilized. Two three-story buildings, for men and women respectively, were devoted to hydrotherapy. Each building had a basement, "devoted to rectal and bowel applications and classrooms". Both buildings were connected to the main building and the 'great gymnasium'. Kellogg noted "That hydrotherapy has won a definite and permanent place in modern rational therapeutics can no longer be questioned, and the Battle Creek Sanitarium claims recognition as the pioneer in scientific hydrotherapy" in America.<ref name="Kellog190877">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.77</ref> Indeed, while some therapies from the 19th century and early 20th century have fallen by the wayside, or remain controversial, hydrotherapy remains widely used. 

Kellogg's use of hydrotherapy was a more sophisticated development of the system that was utilized in the early 19th century by [[Vincent Priessnitz]], which when introduced to America was essentially a "cold water cure",<ref name="Kellog190873">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.73</ref> although "as a tonic, cold water has no superior".<ref name="Kellog190879">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.79</ref> "The crude, but thoroughgoing methods of the original system of Priessnitz, which prospered among the hardy mountaineers of Austrian Silesia, were much too strenuous for more delicately organized and pampered American invalids. This fact, together with the crass empiricism which characterized the use of water in the first half of the last century, when water-cures were for a time almost a fad, brought water into general disrepute as a curative means, and greatly hindered the scientific development of this invaluable agent".<ref name="Kellog190873"/> The Battle Creek system utilized both hot and cold, and correlated the use of hydrotherapy with other therapeutic modalities. Amongst the physiologic tonics used were douches, sitz baths, cold mitten frictions, salt glows, towel rubs, wet sheet rubs, wet and dry packings, compresses, "full baths of various sorts, including [[Bad Nauheim|Nauheim]] baths,{{Ref_label|b|b|none}} electro-hydric baths, shallow and neutral baths". The use of hot and cold applications was to produce "profound reflex effects", including vasodilation and vasoconstriction.<ref name="Kellog190879"/> These physiological mechanisms now seem fairly well understood, and underpin the contemporary use of hydrotherapy,<ref name="Thrash&Thrash">{{Cite book| last= Thrash| first = Agatha| coauthors =& Calvin Thrash

====Phototherapy, Thermotherapy, and Electrotherapy====
This department employed both solar and electric light, with the latter used chiefly during winter. Phototherapy held a prominent place at Battle Creek, where the first electric light bath was constructed.<ref name="Kellog190885">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.85</ref> Regarding the application of electricity, Kellogg noted that "electricity is not capable of accomplishing half the marvels that are claimed for it by many enthusiastic electrotherapists". Nevertheless, he considered it valuable when used in conjunction with hydrotherapy, thermotherapy, and other methods.<ref name="Kellog190887">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.87</ref>

====Physical training====
Physical exercise was an important part of the Battle Creek system, facilitating not just the improvement of muscle tone, but also of posture, respiration, and of circulation and the facilitation of anabolic and catabolic functions enabled by circulatory processes. Exercise included such components as postural, calisthetics, gymnastics, swimming, and passive methods such as mechanotherapy, vibrotherapy, mechanical massage.<ref name="Kellog190893-106">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), pp.93–106</ref>

====Open-air and cold-air methods====
Exposure to the sun and open air were regarded as fundamentally important for health, including stimulation of the skin. Battle Creek had a large outdoor gymnasium. Again, the use of temperature differentials facilitated by water was a component, with exercise followed by a plunge into a fresh water swimming pool "just cool enough to be refreshing and invigorating".<ref name="Kellog1908-107">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.107</ref> Patients were encouraged to sleep in the open air, and a range of outdoor activities were facilitated, from wood-chopping, to basketball and other games, walking trotting, swimming lessons. Also available were skating, tobogganing, skiing, and other outdoor sports (p.&nbsp;111). "Thus all the best advantages of the seashore, camping out, 'going fishing', and other forms of recreation are secured, while the patient is protected from excess by the careful guidance of his physician, and has the advantages of medical care, dietetic regulation, etc".<ref name="Kellog1908109">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.109</ref>

====Dietetics====
Battle Creek utilised information as known at that time to provide nutritional requirements for health and well-being relative to each person's requirements. Food required careful prescriptive preparation, with care also taken to ensure appetiveness and palatability were recognised. The diet lists included "scores of special dishes and hundreds of special food preparations, each of which has been carefully studied in relation to its nutritive and therapeutic properties", with the diet lists used "by the physicians in arranging the diet prescriptions of individual patients".<ref name="Kellog1908125">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.125</ref> Also, "all the so-called Sanitarium health foods" were "regularly found on the Sanitarium bill of fare, having been originally devised solely for this use".<ref name="Kellog1908137">Kellogg, J.H. (1908), p.137</ref>

==Decline of the Battle Creek Sanitarium==
After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] few previously well-to-do patients came to the sanitarium. Finances became very difficult for the "San" and the complex was put under receivership in 1933. The sanitarium stayed in business until after the beginning of WWII.
The U.S. Army, needing a hospital, paid $2,341,000 and moved in creating Percy Jones Army Hospital. The complex was later converted into a federal center and is currently named the [[Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center]].
