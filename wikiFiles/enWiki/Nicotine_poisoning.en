'''Nicotine poisoning''' describes the symptoms of the toxic effects of consuming [[nicotine]], which can potentially be deadly. Historically, most cases of nicotine poisoning have been the result of use of nicotine as an [[insecticide]].

Sixty milligrams of [[nicotine]] (the amount in about 30-40 cigarettes <ref name=WP>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083001418.html Washington Post - 2006]</ref>), has the potential to kill an adult who is not a smoker<ref name=INCHEM>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/chemical/nicotine.htm#PartTitle:7.%20TOXICOLOGY IPCS INCHEM]</ref> if all of the nicotine were absorbed. This figure is ~120&nbsp;mg in chronic cigarette smokers, smoking an average of 20 non-light cigarettes delivering ~1.7&nbsp;mg of nicotine each daily. One cigarette's-worth of nicotine is enough to make a toddler severely ill.  In some cases children have become poisoned by topical medicinal creams which contain nicotine.

People who harvest or cultivate tobacco may experience [[Green Tobacco Sickness]] (GTS), a type of nicotine poisoning caused by dermal exposure to wet tobacco leaves.<ref name="Schep">{{cite journal |author=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Beasley DM |title=Nicotinic plant poisoning |journal=Clinical Toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.) |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=771–81  |year=2009 |month=September–October  |pmid=19778187  |doi=10.1080/15563650903252186}}</ref>

==Common Symptoms==
*[[Vomiting]] and [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]]
*[[Headache]]s
*[[Fainting]]
*Difficulty [[breath]]ing
*[[Pallor]]
*[[diaphoresis|Sweating]]
*[[Palpitations]]
*[[Lisp]]s
*[[Stomach]] pains/cramps/[[bloating]]
*[[Seizures]]
*[[Weakness]]
*[[Drooling]]

==Other symptoms==
*[[Hypertension]]
*[[Stimulant psychosis]]

==Physical process==
These symptoms can be traced back to excessive stimulation of nicotinic [[Cholinergic|cholinergic neuron]]s. Initially, nicotine has a short-lived stimulatory-phase, followed by a longer inhibitory phase leading to neuromuscular blockade.

It is sometimes reported that people poisoned by [[organophosphate]] insecticides experience the same symptoms as nicotine poisoning. Organophosphates inhibit an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, causing a build up of acetylcholine, excessive stimulation of all types of [[Cholinergic|cholinergic neuron]]s, and a wide range of symptoms. Nicotine is specific for nicotinic cholinergic receptors only and has some, but not all of the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning.

==Diagnosing==
Increased nicotine or [[cotinine]] (the nicotine [[metabolite]]) is detected in urine or blood, or serum nicotine levels increase.

==Toxicology==
The {{LD50}} of nicotine is 50&nbsp;mg/kg for [[rat]]s and 3&nbsp;mg/kg for [[mouse|mice]]. 0.5-1.0&nbsp;mg/kg can be a lethal dosage for adult humans, and 0.1&nbsp;mg/kg for children.<ref name=INCHEM/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0773.1994.tb00316.x |author=Okamoto M, Kita T, Okuda H, Tanaka T, Nakashima T |title=Effects of aging on acute toxicity of nicotine in rats |journal=Pharmacol Toxicol. |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=1994 |month=Jul |pmid=7971729
}}</ref> Nicotine therefore has a high [[toxicity]] in comparison to many other alkaloids such as [[cocaine]], which in mice has an LD<sub>50</sub> of 95.1&nbsp;mg/kg. A person can overdose on nicotine through a combination of nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler cartridges and/or tobacco smoking at the same time.<ref>http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/drugs/overdose.html</ref><ref>http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/coffin.htm</ref> Spilling an extremely high concentration of nicotine onto the skin can result in intoxication or even death since nicotine readily passes into the bloodstream from dermal contact.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3762.246-c |author=Lockhart LP |title=Nicotine poisoning |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue= 3762|pages=246–7 |year=1933}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is typically good when medical care is provided. It has been stated that if a patient survives nicotine poisoning during the first 4 hours, they usually recover completely.<ref name="Saxena">{{cite journal |author=Saxena K, Scheman A |title=Suicide plan by nicotine poisoning: a review of nicotine toxicity |journal=Vet Hum Toxicol |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=495–7 |year=1985 |month=December |pmid=4082460}}</ref>
