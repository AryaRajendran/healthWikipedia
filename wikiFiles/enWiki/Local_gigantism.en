[[Image:Local gigantism.JPG|right|thumb|250px|'''Local gigantism''' affecting 2nd toe of a child]]'''Local [[gigantism]]''' or '''localised gigantism''' is a condition in which a certain part of the body acquires larger than normal size due to excessive growth of the anatomical structures or abnormal accumulation of substances. It is more common in [[finger]]s and [[toe]]s, where it is termed '''macrodactyly'''. However, sometimes an entire limb may be enlarged.

== Causes ==
Local gigantism may be caused by a heterogeneous group of both [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired conditions.

=== Congenital ===
<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Elephantman1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|An extreme example of local gigantism in [[Joseph Merrick]], the Elephant Man, who may have had [[Proteus syndrome]]]] -->
Congenital causes include:
*[[Klippel Trenaunay Weber syndrome]]
*[[Maffucci syndrome]]
*[[macrodystrophia lipomatosa]]<ref>[http://www.ijri.org/articles/archives/20001002/letter3.htm Letter to the Indian Journal of Radiology and Imaging]</ref>
*[[neurofibromatosis]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lassmann H, Gebhart W, Mamoli B, Niebauer G |title=Nervous lesions in a case of local gigantism |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=109–15 |year=1977 |pmid=878849 |doi=10.1007/BF00688556}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chung IH, Kim NH, Choi IY |title=Macrodactylism associated with neurofibroma of the median nerve.

*[[Proteus syndrome]], which by one theory accounts for the deformities of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]]

=== Acquired ===
There are a number of acquired causes of local gigantism. A body part can attain bigger size from causes as common as the following:
*[[inflammation]], due to trauma or infection
*[[tumor]]s like [[Osteoma|osteoid osteoma]], [[melorheostosis]], and [[lipofibromatous hamartoma]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Razzaghi A, Anastakis DJ |title=Lipofibromatous hamartoma: review of early diagnosis and treatment |journal=Canadian Journal of Surgery.  Journal canadien de chirurgie |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=394–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16248139 |doi=}}</ref>
*[[Arteriovenous malformation]]s occurring on a limb, before the closure of [[epiphyses]] in [[long bone]]s<ref>[http://indianheartjournal.com/SeptOctober2001/abstact/659-662/265_focal_gigantism.htm Case report]</ref> 
*[[Elephantiasis]], which is quite common in [[south-east asia]] due to prevalence of [[filariasis]].
*[[Still's disease]]
*[[amyloidosis]]
*[[acromegaly]]

===Treatment===
As the causes of local gigantism are varied, treatment depends on the particular condition.  Treatment may range from [[antibiotics]] and other medical therapy, to [[surgery]] in order to correct the anatomical anomaly.
