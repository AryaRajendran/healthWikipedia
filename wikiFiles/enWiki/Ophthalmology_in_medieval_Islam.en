'''[[Ophthalmology]]''' was one of the foremost branches '''in medieval [[Islamic medicine]]'''. The oculist or ''kahhal'' (کحال), a somewhat despised professional in [[Galen]]’s time, was an honored member of the medical profession by the [[Abbasid]] period, occupying a unique place in royal households. Medieval Islamic scientists (unlike their classical predecessors) considered it normal to combine theory and practice, including the crafting of precise instruments, and therefore found it natural to combine the study of the eye with the practical application of that knowledge.<ref>{{citation|title=Science in the Middle Ages|author=[[David C. Lindberg]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1980|isbn=0-226-48233-2|page=21}}</ref> The specialized instruments used in their operations ran into scores. Innovations such as the “[[Injection (medicine)|injection]] [[syringe]]”, a [[hypodermic needle|hollow needle]], invented by Ammar ibn Ali of [[Mosul]], which was used for the extraction by suction of soft [[cataracts]], were quite common.

Muslim physicians described such conditions as [[pannus]], [[glaucoma]] (described as ‘headache of the pupil’), [[phlyctenulae]], and operations on the [[conjunctiva]].  They were the first to use the words '[[retina]]' and '[[cataract]]'.

==Education and history==
To become a practitioner, there was no one fixed method or path of training. There was even no formal specialization in the different branches of medicine, as might be expected. But some students did eventually approximate to a specialist by acquiring proficiency in the treatment of certain diseases or in the use of certain drugs.

Nevertheless it was standard and necessary to learn and understand the works and legacy of predecessors. Among those one can mention, ''The alteration of the eye'' by [[Masawaiyh|Yuhanna ibn Masawayh]], whose work can be considered the earliest work on Ophthalmology, followed by [[Hunain ibn Ishaq]], known in the west as Johannitius, for his work ''The ten treatises of the eye''.

===Cataract extraction===
The next major landmark text on ophthalmology was the ''Choice of Eye Diseases'' written in [[Egypt]] by the [[Iraq]]i Ammar bin Ali Al Mawsili [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_09.html] who attempted the earliest extraction of [[cataract]]s using [[suction]]. He invented a hollow metallic [[syringe]], which he applied through the [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerotic]] and successfully extracted the cataracts through suction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He wrote the following on his invention:

{{quote|"Then I constructed the hollow needle, but I did not operate with it on anybody at all, before I came to [[Tiberias]]. There came a man for an operation who told me: Do as you like with me, only I cannot lie on my back. Then I operated on him with the hollow needle and extracted the cataract; and he saw immediately and did not need to lie, but slept as he liked. Only I bandaged his eye for seven days. With this needle nobody preceded me. I have done many operations with it in Egypt."<ref>{{citation|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|first=Stanley|last=Finger|year=1994|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-514694-8|page=70}}</ref>}}

In his ''Coliget'', [[Averroes]] (1126–1198) was the first to attribute [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] properties to the [[retina]],<ref name=Araguz>Martin-Araguz, A.; Bustamante-Martinez, C.; Fernandez-Armayor, Ajo V.; Moreno-Martinez, J. M. (2002). "Neuroscience in al-Andalus and its influence on medieval scholastic medicine", ''Revista de neurología'' '''34''' (9), p. 877-892.</ref> and he was also the first to suggest that the principle organ of [[Visual perception|sight]] might be the [[Arachnoid mater|arachnoid membrane]] (''aranea''). His work led to much discussion in 16th century Europe over whether the principle organ of sight is the traditional [[Galen]]ic crystalline [[Humorism|humour]] or the Averroist ''aranea'', which in turn led to the discovery that the retina is the principle organ of sight.<ref>{{citation|title=Theories of Vision from Al-kindi to Kepler|first=David C.|last=Lindberg|year=1981|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=0-226-48235-9|page=238}}</ref>

[[Ibn al-Nafis]] wrote a large textbook on ophthalmology called ''The Polished Book on Experimental Ophthalmology''. The book is divided into two sections: "On the Theory of Ophthalmology" and "Simple and Compunded Ophthalmic Drugs".<ref name=Iskandar-Selin>Albert Z. Iskandar, "Ibn al-Nafis", in [[Helaine Selin]] (1997), ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], ISBN 0-7923-4066-3.</ref>Other significant works in medieval Islamic ophthalmology include [[Rhazes]]’ ''Continens'', [[Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal]]’s ''Notebook of the Oculists'', and the ethnic Assyrian Christian [[Jabril ibn Bukhtishu|Jibrail Bukhtishu]]’s ''Medicine of the Eye'', among numerous others.

==Ottoman Empire==
In the [[Ottoman Empire]], and well into the [[Republic of Turkey]] of the 20th century, a class of ambulatory eye surgeons, popularly known as the ‘kırlangıç oğlanları’ (‘sons of the swallow’) operated on cataract using special knives. From contemporary sources can be glimpsed that the reputation of these “blinding frauds” was far from spotless.<ref>Laban Kaptein (ed.), Ahmed Bican, ''Dürr-i meknûn'', p. 31f. Asch 2007.
