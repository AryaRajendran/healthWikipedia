'''B   vitamins''' are a group of water-soluble [[vitamin]]s that play important roles in [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[metabolism]]. The B vitamins were once thought to be a single vitamin, referred to as '''vitamin B''' (much as people refer to [[vitamin C]]). Later research showed that they are [[chemical]]ly distinct vitamins that often coexist in the same foods. In general, supplements containing all eight are referred to as a '''vitamin B complex'''. Individual B vitamin supplements are referred to by the specific name of each vitamin (e.g., B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> etc.).

== List of B vitamins ==

* '''Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>''' ([[thiamine]])
* '''Vitamin B<sub>2</sub>''' ([[riboflavin]])

| '''Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>''' || [[Thiamine]] || [[File:Thiamin.svg|110px]] || Thiamine plays a central role in the generation of energy from carbohydrates. It is involved in [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] production, as well as nerve function. Its active form is a coenzyme called [[Thiamine pyrophosphate]] (TPP), which takes part in the conversion of pyruvate to [[acetyl Coenzyme A]] (CoA) in metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fattal-Valevski|first=A|title=Thiamin (vitamin B1)|journal=Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary & Alternative Medicine|year=2011|volume=16|issue=1|pages=12–20|accessdate=17 September 2012}}</ref>
|-
| '''Vitamin B<sub>2</sub>''' || [[Riboflavin]] || [[File:Riboflavin.svg|110px]] || Riboflavin is involved in the energy production for the [[electron transport chain]], the [[citric acid cycle]], as well as the catabolism of fatty acids ([[beta oxidation]])<ref>{{cite journal|title=Riboflavin|journal=Alternative Medicine Review|year=2008|volume=13|issue=4|pages=334–340|accessdate=17 September 2012}}</ref> 
|-
| '''Vitamin B<sub>3</sub>''' || [[Niacin]] || [[File:Niacin structure.svg|center|60px]] || Niacin is composed of two structures: nicotinic acid and [[nicotinamide]]. There are two co-enzyme forms of niacin: [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) and [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP). Both play an important role in energy transfer reactions in the metabolism of glucose, fat and alcohol.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Nutrition|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Melbourne|author=Whitney, N|coauthors=Rolfes, S Crowe, T Cameron-Smith, D Walsh, A}}</ref>

== B vitamin deficiency ==

Several named vitamin deficiency diseases may result from the lack of sufficient B-vitamins.  Deficiencies of other B vitamins result in symptoms that are not part of a named deficiency disease.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Vitamin''' || '''Name''' || '''Deficiency effects
 |-
 | '''Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>''' || [[thiamine]] || Deficiency causes [[beriberi]].  Symptoms of this disease of the [[nervous system]] include weight loss, emotional disturbances, [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]] (impaired sensory perception), weakness and pain in the limbs, periods of [[arrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]], and [[edema]] (swelling of bodily tissues).  [[Heart failure]] and [[death]] may occur in advanced cases. Chronic thiamine deficiency can also cause [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], an irreversible psychosis characterized by [[amnesia]] and [[confabulation]].
 |-
 | '''Vitamin B<sub>2</sub>'''   || [[riboflavin]] || Deficiency causes [[ariboflavinosis]].  Symptoms may include [[Angular cheilitis|cheilosis]] (cracks in the lips), high sensitivity to sunlight, [[angular cheilitis]], [[glossitis]] (inflammation of the tongue), [[seborrheic dermatitis]] or pseudo-[[syphilis]] (particularly affecting the [[scrotum]] or [[labia majora]] and the [[nasolabial folds|mouth]]), [[sore throat|pharyngitis]] (sore throat), [[hyperemia]], and edema of the [[Pharynx|pharyngeal]] and [[Wiktionary:oral|oral]] [[mucus membranes|mucosa]].
 |-
 | '''Vitamin B<sub>3</sub>''' || [[niacin]] || Deficiency, along with a deficiency of [[tryptophan]] causes [[pellagra]].  Symptoms include aggression, [[dermatitis]], [[insomnia]], [[weakness]], mental confusion, and [[diarrhea]].  In advanced cases, pellagra may lead to [[dementia]] and death (the 3(+1) Ds: dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death).
 |-
 | '''Vitamin B<sub>5</sub>'''  || [[pantothenic acid]] || Deficiency can result in [[acne]] and [[paresthesia]], although it is uncommon.
 |-
 | '''Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>'''  || [[pyridoxine]] || Deficiency may lead to [[microcytic anemia]] (because pyridoxyl phosphate is the cofactor for heme synthesis), [[clinical depression|depression]], dermatitis, high blood pressure ([[hypertension]]), water retention, and elevated levels of [[homocysteine]].
 |-
 | '''Vitamin B<sub>7</sub>'''   || [[biotin]] || Deficiency does not typically cause symptoms in adults but may lead to impaired growth and neurological disorders in infants. [[Multiple carboxylase deficiency]], an inborn error of metabolism, can lead to biotin deficiency even when dietary biotin intake is normal.
 |-
 | '''Vitamin B<sub>9</sub>''' || [[folic acid]] || Deficiency results in a [[Megaloblastic anemia|macrocytic anemia]], and elevated levels of [[homocysteine]]. Deficiency in pregnant women can lead to birth defects. Supplementation is often recommended during pregnancy. Researchers have shown that folic acid might also slow the insidious effects of age on the brain.
 |-
 | '''Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>''' || [[cobalamin]] || Deficiency results in a [[megaloblastic anemia|macrocytic anemia]], elevated [[homocysteine]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], memory loss and other cognitive deficits. It is most likely to occur among elderly people, as absorption through the gut declines with age; the autoimmune disease [[pernicious anemia]] is another common cause. It can also cause symptoms of [[mania]] and [[psychosis]].  In rare extreme cases, paralysis can result.

== B vitamin sources ==

B vitamins are found in whole unprocessed foods. Processed carbohydrates such as sugar and white flour tend to have lower B vitamin than their unprocessed counterparts. For this reason, it is required by law in the United States (and many other countries) that the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid be added back to white flour after processing. This is sometimes called "Enriched Flour" on food labels. B vitamins are particularly concentrated in meat such as turkey, tuna and liver.<ref>Stipanuk, M.H. (2006). Biochemical, physiological, molecular aspects of human nutrition (2nd ed.). St Louis: Saunders Elsevier p.667</ref> Good sources for B vitamins include [[kombucha]], whole grains, potatoes, bananas, [[lentil]]s, chili peppers, [[tempeh]], beans, [[nutritional yeast]], [[brewer's yeast]], and [[molasses]].

The B<sub>12</sub> vitamin is of note because it is not available from plant products, making B<sub>12</sub> deficiency a legitimate concern for [[vegan]]s. Manufacturers of plant-based foods will sometimes report B<sub>12</sub> content, leading to confusion about what sources yield B<sub>12</sub>. The confusion arises because the standard [[US Pharmacopeia]] (USP) method for measuring the B<sub>12</sub> content does not measure the B<sub>12</sub> directly. Instead, it measures a bacterial response to the food. Chemical variants of the B<sub>12</sub> vitamin found in plant sources are active for bacteria, but cannot be used by the human body. This same phenomenon can cause significant over-reporting of B<sub>12</sub> content in other types of foods as well.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vitamin B-12: Plant sources, requirements, and assay |journal=Am.

Another popular means of increasing one's vitamin B intake is through the use of [[dietary supplement]]s. B vitamins are also commonly added to [[energy drinks]], many of which have been marketed with large amounts of B vitamins<ref name="Woolston">{{cite news|title=B vitamins don't boost energy drinks' power|author=Chris Woolston|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 14, 2008|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-skeptic14-2008jul14,0,3939169.story|accessdate=2008-10-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019063954/http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-skeptic14-2008jul14,0,3939169.story| archivedate= 19 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> with claims that this will cause the consumer to "sail through your day without feeling jittery or tense."<ref name="Woolston"/> Some nutritionists  have been critical of these claims, pointing out for instance that while B vitamins do "help unlock the energy in foods," most Americans acquire the necessary amounts easily in their diets.<ref name="Woolston"/>

Many of the following substances have been referred to as vitamins as they were once believed to be vitamins. They are no longer considered as such, and the numbers that were assigned to them now form the "gaps" in the true series of B-complex vitamins described above (e.g., there is no vitamin B<sub>4</sub>). Some of them, though not essential to humans, are essential in the diets of other organisms; others have no known nutritional value and may even be toxic under certain conditions.
