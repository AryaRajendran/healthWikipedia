The '''Edmonton Protocol''' is a method of implantation of [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] [[Islets of Langerhans|islet]]s for the treatment of [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]], specifically "[[Brittle diabetes|brittle]]" type 1 diabetics prone to hypoglycemic unawareness. The protocol is named for the islet transplantation group at the [[University of Alberta]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] city of [[Edmonton]], where the protocol was first devised in the late 1990s, and published in ''The New England Journal of Medicine'' in July 2000.

==Procedure==
The Edmonton Protocol involves isolating islets from a [[organ donation|cadaveric donor]] [[pancreas]] using a mixture of [[enzymes]] called Liberase ([[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]]). Each recipient receives islets from one to as many as three donors. The islets are infused into the patient's [[portal vein]], and are then kept from being destroyed by the recipient's [[immune system]] through the use of two [[immunosuppressants]], [[sirolimus]] and [[tacrolimus]] as well as a monoclonal [[antibody]] drug used in transplant patients called [[daclizumab]].

==History==
Islet isolation and [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] was pioneered by [[Paul Lacy]] throughout the 1960s. He and Walter Ballinger together were able to restore normoglycaemia in diabetic [[rat]]s following the transplantation of isolated islets into the rodent's livers.  Scientists have not yet successfully translated Dr. Lacy's success in rodents to humans.

The Edmonton Protocol was primarily developed by Dr [[James Shapiro]] (transplant surgeon), Jonathan Lakey Ph.D., Dr Edmond Ryan ([[Endocrinology|endocrinologist]]), Gregory Korbutt Ph.D., Dr. Ellen Toth, Dr. Garth Warnock, Dr. Norman Kneteman, and Ray Rajotte Ph.D., at the University of Alberta Hospital and the Surgical-Medical Research Institute. The first patient was treated using the Edmonton Protocol in March 1999. The protocol was first published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in July 2000<!--Reference?: (1)-->.

The NEJM report was exciting for the diabetes field because the seven patients undergoing the Edmonton Protocol remained [[insulin]]-independent after an average of 12 months.

==Current review==
It has recently been reported that of thirty-six patients transplanted, only sixteen (44%) were insulin-independent after one year; ten (28%) had partial graft function after one year; and ten (28%) had complete graft loss after one year. Insulin independence is not usually sustainable in the long term, but the transplanted islets still function enough to provide protection from severe hypoglycemic episodes and unawareness.

The major problem limiting islet transplantation therapy for type 1 diabetic individuals is the lack of organ donors.

"Since 2000, Several hundred people have received islet transplants, by a year after transplant, 50 - 68% of patients do not need to receive additional insulin, but by five years after the procedure, few than 10% of total patients are free of daily insulin supplementaition."<ref>Hole's Essentials of Human Anatomy & Physiology, Tenth Edition pg 309</ref>
