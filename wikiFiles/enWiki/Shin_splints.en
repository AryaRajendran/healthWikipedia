'''Medial tibial stress syndrome''' (MTSS), '''tibial [[periostitis]]''' or '''shin splints''' is a common injury that affects athletes who engage in running sports or physical activity. This condition is characterized by pain in the lower part of the leg between the [[knee]] and the [[ankle]]. MTSS injuries are caused by repeated trauma to the [[Connective tissue in skeletal muscle|connective]] [[muscle tissue]] surrounding the [[tibia]]. Ignoring this injury may result in a more serious condition such as a [[stress fracture]] or breakage of the bones.

==Causes and epidemiology==
Shin splints, known as ''medial tibial stress syndrome'' (MTSS), can usually be attributed to overloading the muscles of the lower extremities or to biomechanical irregularities. If an athlete begins running a lot after not running for a long period of time, it puts excess stress on the muscles, causing shin splints. Muscle imbalance, including weak core muscles, can cause lower-extremity injuries, and inflexibility and tightness of the [[gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]], [[soleus muscle|soleus]], and [[plantar]] muscles (commonly the [[flexor digitorum longus]]) may contribute, as well.<ref>Galbraith, M., & Lavallee, M. (2009).  Medial tibial stress syndrome: conservative treatment options. 2(3):127–133. Retrieved from Pubmed</ref>  Increasing activity, intensity, and duration too quickly leads to shin splints because the tendons and muscles are unable to absorb the impact of the shock force as they become fatigued; also, the tibial bone-remodeling capabilities are overloaded. The pain associated with MTSS is caused from a disruption of [[Sharpey's fibres]] that connect the medial soleus fascia through the [[periosteum]] of the tibia where it inserts into the bone.<ref>Craig, D. I. (2008). "Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome: Evidence-Based Prevention". ''Journal of Athletic Training'' 43(3), 316–318. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.</ref> With repetitive stress, the impact forces eccentrically fatigue the soleus and create repeated tibial bending or bowing; thus, contributing to MTSS. The impact is made worse by running uphill, downhill, on uneven terrain, or  on hard surfaces. Improper footwear, including worn-out shoes can also contribute to shin splints. Risk factors for developing MTSS include:

While MTSS is the most common name, other conditions often overlap as causes including [[compartment syndrome]] and [[stress fracture]]s.

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
MTSS usually occurs late in a sports season for athletes or after prolonged activity for active individuals.  However, onset can occur during the initial rigors of exercise after an individual has been inactive for a long period. A typical clinical presentation of this condition involves pain, palpable tenderness, and possibly swelling. Pain associated with MTSS is usually a recurring dull ache over the distal one-third posteromedial cortex of the tibia. In early diagnosis, individuals may experience pain at the beginning of a workout, which may go away by continued activity and then occur again at the end of the activity. As the syndrome progresses pain may stay throughout the whole training or during low intensity activity and may continue at rest. Range of motion in the ankle and foot should not cause pain.

Vascular and neurological examinations produce normal results in patients with MTSS. Radiographies and three-phase bone scans are recommended to differentiate between MTSS and other causes of chronic leg pain.

Chronic lower leg pain results from various conditions such as medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fracture, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, [[nerve entrapment]], and [[popliteal artery]] entrapment syndrome. These conditions often have many overlapping symptoms which makes a final diagnosis difficult. Therefore, an algorithmic approach was created to help in the evaluation of patients with complaints of lower leg pain, and assist in finding a diagnosis. Confirmation of the diagnosis is key and involves appropriate diagnostic studies including: [[radiograph]]s, [[bone scan]]s, [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[magnetic resonance angiography]], compartmental pressure measurements, and [[arteriogram]]s.

==Treatment==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}} 
Correct diagnosis of the cause of pain or discomfort is necessary in order to choose the most appropriate treatment. Compartment syndrome may require immediate medical intervention, depending on the severity of the condition. Stress fractures require rest until the bone has healed. If needed apply ice to the injured area. The inflammation of soft tissue known as shin splints can be initially treated with rest, ice to reduce inflammation, NSAIDS, and physiotherapy. For healing, rest may be required for a couple of weeks or up to three months for severe cases. Crutches may be necessary for temporary non-weight bearing, casting of the limb is only recommended for severe cases. Patients may be advised to decrease the duration or intensity of their exercise and then build it up slowly, as well as to exercise caution on high impact surfaces, until the muscles re-condition. Specially fitted footwear or an orthotic may be used to prevent a reoccurrence of shin splints.<ref>{{cite web|last=NHS Choices|title=Shin splints|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shin-splints/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> 

Acute phase of treatment options include resting and applying ice. Therapy option includes physical therapy modalities such as ultrasound, whirlpool baths, [[phonophoresis]], augmented soft tissue mobilization, electrical stimulation, and unweighted ambulation. Subacute phase is modifying the training routine, after the acute phase. The goal of the treatment should focus on modifying training regimens and addressing biomechanical abnormalities. Following the subacute phase is stretching and strengthening exercises. Exercises should focus on strengthening the [[Tibialis anterior muscle|tibialis anterior]] and other muscles controlling both inversion and eversion of the foot. Strengthening of the core hip muscles may also be beneficial.

Other ways to treat shin splints is to have appropriate footwear. Orthotics can also help with biomechanical problems of the foot. Over-the-counter orthosis help with excessive foot pronation, and mal-alignments may benefit from custom orthotics.

Potential treatments may include extracorporeal shock wave therapy, which is used to treat various tendinopathies of the lower extremity, injection methods, which have been used to treat injuries of the lower extremity, including [[cortisone]]. There are also surgical options that are reserved for recalcitrant cases that do not respond with normal treatment. "Posterior fasciotomy" is the procedure performed. This may include cauterization of the posteromedial ridge of the tibia, and results may not cause complete resolution but can improve the pain and function.
