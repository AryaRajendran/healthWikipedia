The '''medial [[meniscus_(anatomy)|meniscus]]''' is a [[fibrocartilage]] semicircular band that spans the [[knee]] joint medially, located between the [[medial condyle of femur|medial condyle]] of the [[femur]] and the [[medial condyle of tibia|medial condyle]] of the [[tibia]].<ref name="Platzer-208">Platzer (2004), p 208</ref> It is also referred to as the '''internal semilunar fibrocartilage'''. It is a common site of injury, especially if the knee is twisted.

== Structure ==
The meniscus attaches to the tibia via meniscotibial (coronary ligaments). 

Its anterior end, thin and pointed, is attached to the [[anterior intercondyloid fossa]] of the [[tibia]], in front of the [[anterior cruciate ligament]];

Its posterior end is fixed to the [[posterior intercondyloid fossa]] of the tibia, between the attachments of the [[lateral meniscus]] and the [[posterior cruciate ligament]].

It is fused with the [[tibial collateral ligament]] which makes it far less mobile than the lateral meniscus. The points of attachment are relatively widely separated and, because the meniscus is wider posteriorly than anteriorly, the anterior crus is considerably thinner than the posterior crus. The greatest displacement of the meniscus is caused by external rotation, while internal rotation relaxes it.<ref name="Platzer-208" />

During rotational movements of the tibia (with the knee flexed 90 degrees), the medial meniscus remains relatively fixed while the lateral part of the lateral meniscus is displaced across the tibial condyle below.<ref>''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 399</ref>

==Function==
The medial meniscus separates the [[tibia]] and [[femur]] to decrease the contact area between the bones, and serves as a [[shock absorber]] reducing the peak contact force experienced. It also reduces friction between the two bones to allow smooth movement in the knee and distribute load during movement.

==Injury==
Acute injury to the medial meniscus fairly often accompanies an injury to the ACL ([[anterior cruciate ligament]]) or MCL ([[medial collateral ligament]]). A person occasionally injures the medial meniscus without harming the ligaments. Healing of the medial meniscus is generally slow. Damage to the outer third of the meniscus will often fully heal, but the inner two thirds of the medial meniscus has a limited blood supply and thus limited healing ability. Large tears to the meniscus may require surgical repair or removal.  If the meniscus has to be removed (menisectomy) because of injury (either because it cannot heal or because the damage is too severe), the patient has an increased risk of developing [[osteoarthritis]] in the knee later in life.<ref>[http://www.arthroscopy.com/sp05005.htm Torn Cartilage (Meniscus)]</ref><ref>[http://www.orthoassociates.com/meniscus.htm The Meniscus]</ref><ref>[http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/meniscusinjuries1/a/meniscus.htm Meniscus Tear - Torn Cartilage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

More chronic injury occurs with [[osteoarthritis]], made worse by [[obesity]] and high-impact activity. The medial meniscus and the medial compartment are more commonly affected than the lateral compartment.
