'''Phototoxins''' are [[toxin]]s that can cause allergic reactions in particularly susceptible individuals and which can cause dangerous [[photosensitivity]] in a much broader range of subjects.

Phototoxins are common in:
*a variety of plants (including food plants where they may be a [[biological defence]]):
**many [[citrus]]es contain [[essential oil]]s that are photosensitizers;
**some [[herbalism|herbal]] remedies (notably [[St John's wort]], though incident rates for this plant are reportedly low);

*some prescribed medications (such as [[tetracycline]] antibiotics); and
*many [[essential oils]], [[perfume]]s and [[cosmetics]].
Ingested medications may cause systemic photosensitivity and topically applied medications, cosmetics and essential oils may lead to local (or perhaps systemic) photosensitivity. Curiously and ironically, para-aminobenzoic acid ([[4-Aminobenzoic acid|PABA]]) found in some sunscreens can also cause photosensitivity.

Upon exposure to light, notably light containing [[ultraviolet]] radiation, discolouration of the skin (whether as inflammation, lightening or darkening) or rashes may result. In extreme cases, blistering may also occur.

==Uses==
The [[Marigold (common)|marigold]] plant produces the phototoxin alpha-terthienyl, which functions as a [[nematicide]]. When exposed to near ultraviolet light, such as in sunlight, alpha-terthienyl generates the toxic [[singlet oxygen]].<ref>J. Bakker, F. J. Gommers, I. Nieuwenhuis and H. Wynberg.

[[Rose bengal]] and other [[singlet oxygen]] generating phototoxins are also used in synthetic organic chemistry. They have also found use in [[photodynamic therapy]], where the toxin is activated by intense light to destroy cancer cells.
