In [[human anatomy]], the '''popliteal artery''' is defined as the extension of the "superficial" [[femoral artery]] after passing through the [[adductor canal]] and [[adductor hiatus]] above the [[knee]].  The termination of the popliteal artery is its bifurcation into the [[anterior tibial artery]] and [[posterior tibial artery]].

The popliteal artery, through numerous smaller branches, supplies blood to the [[knee joint]] and [[muscle]]s in the [[thigh]] and [[calf muscle|calf]].  It is accompanied, along its length, by the [[popliteal vein]].

==Branches==
The branches of the popliteal artery are:
*[[anterior tibial artery]]
*[[posterior tibial artery]]
*[[sural artery]]
*[[medial superior genicular artery]]
*[[lateral superior genicular artery]]
*[[middle genicular artery]]
*[[lateral inferior genicular artery]]
*[[medial inferior genicular artery]]

===Tibial-fibular trunk===
{{main|Tibial-fibular trunk}}
The [[fibular artery]] typically arises from the [[posterior tibial artery]].<ref name=day>{{cite journal | author = Day C, Orme R | title = Popliteal artery branching patterns -- an angiographic study | journal = Clin Radiol | volume = 61 | issue = 8 | pages = 696â€“9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16843754 | doi = 10.1016/j.crad.2006.03.014}}</ref> Therefore, the posterior tibial artery proximal to the fibular artery origin is sometimes called the ''[[tibial-peroneal trunk]]'' or ''tibial-fibular trunk'' and it could be said that the popliteal artery bifurates into the ''tibial-fibular trunk'' and ''anterior tibial artery''.

==Pulse==
Its [[pulse]] can be [[palpation|palpated]] behind the [[knee]] when it is semi-flexed, but is generally more challenging to find than other arteries of the leg; thus, a readily-detectable and easy-to-find popliteal pulse may actually suggest some pathology.
