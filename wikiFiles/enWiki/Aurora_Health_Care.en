==History==
===Formation (1984–1987)===
In 1984, St. Luke's Medical Center, located on Milwaukee's south side, and Good Samaritan Medical Center, located on Milwaukee's near north side, formed an affiliation called St. Luke's Samaritan Health Care.  This partnership was the first in the Milwaukee area of two formerly independent hospitals. Three years later, when Mount Sinai Medical Center merged with Good Samaritan Medical Center in 1987, the partnership changed its name to Aurora Health Care.<ref name="aurora-history"/>

The goal of the partnership of the three hospitals was to reduce costs, maintain a high level of care, and compete with the other hospitals in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.<ref name="aurora-history"/>

===Expansion through partnerships (1988–1997)===
After forming a partnership with Aurora, the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) of Milwaukee joined Aurora in 1988. The VNA, founded in 1907, is Wisconsin's largest provider of hospice care for children and adults.<ref name="aurora-history"/>
[[Image:AuroraSheboyganMemorialMedicalCenter.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Aurora [[Sheboygan]] Medical Center]]

Between 1992 and 1995, the health care system added five more hospitals:<ref name="aurora-history"/>
*Sheboygan Memorial Medical Center (1992)
*Milwaukee Psychiatric Hospital (1993)
*Hartford Memorial Hospital (1993)
*Two Rivers Community Hospital (1993)
*West Allis Memorial Hospital (1995)

Two more hospitals were brought into the Aurora system in 1995: the 78-year-old Lakeland Medical Center in [[Elkhorn, Wisconsin|Elkhorn]], owned by Walworth County, and Trinity Memorial Hospital in Cudahy, founded in 1958 and owned by Catholic Health Corp. Aurora acquired Lakeland Medical Center for about $16 million. In the deal, Aurora assumed the hospital's bond obligations and debt and agreed to contribute to a fund to cover the uninsured.<ref>{{cite news | last = Lincoln | first = Judy | title = Country OKs hospital deal with Aurora | publisher = [[Milwaukee Sentinel]] | date = 1995-03-15 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4208/is_19950315/ai_n10188965 | accessdate = 2007-04-02 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In February 1996, Memorial Hospital of Burlington was the final hospital to join Aurora Health Care .<ref name="aurora-history"/>

===Expansion through construction (1998 – present)===
[[Image:Aurora Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aurora Medical Center in [[Two Rivers, WI|Two Rivers]]]]
In 1998, Aurora built its first hospital, on the west side of [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], which opened in February 1999. That same year Aurora replaced Two Rivers Community Hospital with a new facility, which opened in June 2000.<ref name="aurora-history"/>

Constrained by space at the {{convert|17|acre|m2|adj=on}} St. Luke's Medical Center campus, Aurora expanded upward by building a 12-story "heart tower" on top of the existing parking structure.  The expansion has 270 beds and opened in 2004.<ref>{{cite news | last = Trewyn | first = Phill | title = The answer at St. Luke's: elevate | publisher = The Business Journal | date = 2003-09-03 | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2003/09/15/focus2.html | accessdate = 2007-04-01 }}</ref>

During the spring of 2002, the five-story Aurora Women's Pavilion was opened at West Allis Memorial Hospital.<ref name="aurora-history"/>

On October 27, 2003, the health care system opened a new 84-bed hospital in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]], which employs over 400 people, and competes with the 157-bed Mercy Medical Center.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Open house celebration Oct. 25 to unveil Aurora Medical Center in Oshkosh | publisher = Aurora Health Care | date = 2003-08-31 | url = http://www.aurorahealthcare.org/aboutus/media/news/index.asp?AutoNumber=63 | accessdate = 2007-04-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Trewyn | first = Phill | title = Aurora on track in Oshkosh | publisher = The Business Journal | date = 2003-03-28 | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2003/03/31/story5.html | accessdate = 2007-04-01 }}</ref>

==Recent activity==
In March 2004, Aurora Health Care announced a new QuickCare service, the first of its kind in the Milwaukee area. The kiosks, known as Aurora QuickCare, are staffed by providers who handle basic, common medical issues for a flat rate.<ref>{{cite news | last = Williams | first = Scott | title = Aurora plans to launch 8 'Quick Care' kiosks | work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | publisher = FindArticles.com | date = 2004-05-28 | accessdate = 2007-04-01 }}</ref> Aurora has opened 19 of these facilities including five in [[Walmart|Walmart Supercenters]].<ref>{{cite web | title =  Aurora Facilities | publisher = Aurora Health Care | url = http://www.aurorahealthcare.org/facilities/search.asp?fldFacilityKind=QuickCare&fldAddress=&fldService=ALL&fldFacilityName=ALL&fldCounty=ALL&fldZipCode=&fldZipCodeDistance=5&fldCity=ALL&docsubmit=Search | accessdate = 2007-04-01 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070505002016/http://www.aurorahealthcare.org/facilities/search.asp?fldFacilityKind=QuickCare&fldAddress=&fldService=ALL&fldFacilityName=ALL&fldCounty=ALL&fldZipCode=&fldZipCodeDistance=5&fldCity=ALL&docsubmit=Search| archivedate= May 5, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

After leading the health care system since its creation 22 years earlier, G. Edwin Howe announced his retirement as president and chief executive officer.<ref>{{cite news | title = Aurora Health Care CEO Howe to retire | publisher = The Business Journal | date = 2006-03-24 | url = http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2006/03/20/daily41.html | accessdate = 2007-04-01 }}</ref>  Nick Turkal, M.D., a family practice physician and president of Aurora's metro Milwaukee region, was chosen as Howe's replacement, effective on January 1, 2007.

===Summit Hospital===
In March 2001, Aurora announced plans to build a new hospital in the Pabst Farms development that was in the jurisdiction of the city of Oconomowoc. The Oconomowoc Common Council rezoned the property in June 2001, preventing the development.  Aurora sued Oconomowoc because it believed that the rezoning was done illegally.<ref name="oconfous-deal">{{cite news | last = Clark | first = Jonna | title = Town and city come together over hospital | work = Waukesha Freeman | publisher = Aurora Health Care | date = 2006-08-22 | url = http://www.aurorahealthcare.org/facilities/more/western-waukesha/up-to-date/news/2006/ocon8-22-06.asp | accessdate = 2007-04-02 }}</ref>

Aurora revealed plans in 2004 to construct a hospital in the Pabst Farms development located in the [[Summit, Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Town of Summit]] a few hundred feet south of the proposed Oconomowoc site.  It will be Aurora's first hospital in Waukesha County. In 2007, the Summit Town Board approved the new Aurora hospital, which is planned to have a capacity of 110 beds<ref>{{cite news | last = Rinard | first = Amy | title = Aurora given green light | publisher = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | date = 2007-03-01 | url = http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=572366 | accessdate = 2007-04-02 }}</ref> and to be completed in March 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title = Aurora to open Town of Summit clinic months ahead of schedule |publisher=  Aurora Health Carea| url = http://www.aurorahealthcare.org/aboutus/media/news/index.asp?AutoNumber=570| accessdate = June 10, 2009}}</ref>

The new Summit home for Aurora Wilkinson Medical Clinic will open October 26, 2009 and will replace the current Aurora Wilkinson Medical Clinic, the Wilkinson Women's Center and the Aurora Vision Center, all currently in Oconomowoc. The Vince Lombardi Cancer Clinic will also move from its Oconomowoc location to the Summit campus and a new Aurora Pharmacy will open at the Summit facility.

The new Aurora Medical Center campus in the Town of Summit is at the southeast corner of Interstate 94 and Highway 67. The new Aurora Wilkinson Medical Clinic will be on the west side of the campus, and the Vince Lombardi Cancer Clinic is on the south side.

===Advanced Healthcare Merger===
In late 2006, Advanced Healthcare, the largest independent practice in southeastern Wisconsin that had not aligned with a health care system, began seeking a buyer or a partnership with a Milwaukee-area health care system. On July 31, 2007, Advanced Healthcare and Aurora Health Care announced that they would be joined "under a broad affiliation agreement."<ref name="js-grafton">{{cite news | last = Boulton | first = Guy | coauthors = Sussman, Lawrence | title = Aurora plans Grafton hospital | publisher = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | date = 2007-08-01 | url = http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=641044 | accessdate = 2007-08-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070811200618/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=641044 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-11}}</ref><ref name="adv-health-purchase-press">{{cite press release | title = Advanced Healthcare and Aurora Health Care agree to form broad new alliance to improve care | publisher = Aurora Health Care | date = 2007-07-31 | url = http://www.aurorahealthcare.org/aboutus/media/news/index.asp?AutoNumber=302 | accessdate = 2007-07-31 }}</ref>  According to the agreement, the leadership of Advanced Healthcare would remain intact.

In concert with the purchase announcement, Aurora and Advanced Healthcare announced they would construct a new hospital in [[Grafton, Wisconsin|Grafton]], a northern suburb of Milwaukee, which opened in late 2010 and competes for patients in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]] with Columbia-St. Mary's Hospital Ozaukee.  Health care industry experts estimated the total cost of purchasing Advanced Healthcare and constructing the Grafton hospital at $250 million.<ref name="js-grafton" />
