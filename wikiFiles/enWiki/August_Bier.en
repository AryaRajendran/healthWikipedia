==Spinal anesthesia==
[[File:Liquor bei Spinalanaesthesie.JPG|thumb|left|[[Cerebrospinal fluid]] flowing through a [[Needle gauge comparison chart|25 gauge]] spinal needle during [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal anesthesia]]]]

On 16 August 1898, Bier performed the first [[surgery|operation]] under spinal anesthesia at the Royal Surgical Hospital of the [[University of Kiel]]. The subject was scheduled to undergo [[segmental resection]] of his left [[ankle]], which was severely infected with [[tuberculosis]], but he dreaded the prospect of [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] because he had suffered severe adverse [[side effect]]s during multiple previous operations. Therefore, Bier suggested "cocainization" of the [[spinal cord]] as an alternative to general anesthesia. Bier [[Injection (medicine)|injected]] 15&nbsp;mg of [[cocaine]] [[intrathecal]]ly, which was sufficient to allow him to perform the operation. The subject was fully conscious during the operation, but felt no pain. Two hours after the operation, the subject complained of [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], severe [[headache]], and pain in his back and ankle. The vomiting, back and leg pain improved by the following day, but the headache was still present. Bier performed spinal anesthetics on five more subjects for lower extremity surgery, using a similar technique and achieving similar results.<ref name=Bier1899/><ref name=Wulf1998/>

After this series of six subjects, Bier was to receive a spinal anesthetic administered by his assistant, August Hildebrandt. Unfortunately, although Hildebrandt placed the spinal [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] correctly, with [[cerebrospinal fluid]] flowing freely from it, the [[syringe]] was only then discovered to not fit into the hub of the needle. During the efforts to fit the syringe into the hub of the needle, a great deal of cerebrospinal fluid escaped, most of the cocaine to be injected was lost, and the spinal anesthetic was consequently a complete failure. After this experiment — and later that same evening — Bier performed a cocaine spinal anesthetic on Hildebrandt. After the injection, Hildebrandt was temporarily unable to move or feel any sensation in his legs. The profound analgesia of his legs was demonstrated with repeated kicks to his shins, which however, soon regained their sensation. Later that evening, they celebrated their success with wine and cigars. Like all of Bier's previous experimental subjects, Bier and Hildebrandt both experienced severe [[Post-dural-puncture headache|post-spinal headaches]]. Hildebrandt's symptoms lasted about four days, while Bier remained confined to bed for nine days.<ref name=Bier1899/><ref name=Wulf1998/>

==Intravenous regional anesthesia==
[[File:Venadaxili regional anesteziya.jpg|thumb|left|[[Intravenous regional anesthesia]]]]

In 1908, Bier pioneered the use of [[intravenous regional anesthesia]],<ref name=Bier1908/><ref name=Bier1909/> a technique which is commonly referred to as a "Bier block".<ref name=Wulf1998/> This technique is frequently used for operations of brief duration upon the hand, wrist, and forearm. It can also be used for operations of brief duration upon the foot, ankle, and leg.<ref name=Bier1908/><ref name=Bier1909/>

==Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin==
In 1903 he joined the faculty of the [[University of Bonn]] as a full professor, where he taught until 1907. Then he went to Berlin, where he was appointed [[Geheimrat]] [[Professor]] of Surgery and Chief Surgeon at the [[Charité|Charité - Universitätsmedizin]]. Bier was elected President of the German Surgical Society in 1911.<ref name=MR1911>{{cite journal|last=Shrady|first=George Frederick|last2=Stedman|first2=Thomas Lathrop|title=Fiftieth anniversary of Berlin Medical Society|journal=Medical record: a weekly journal of medicine and surgery|volume=79|issue=3|pages=119–20|date=1911-01-21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2T8cAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA120&lpg=PA120&dq=%22President+of+the+German+Surgical+Society%22+Bier#v=onepage&q=%22President%20of%20the%20German%20Surgical%20Society%22%20Bier&f=false}}</ref> Bier treated many important people, such as [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], family members of [[Nicholas II of Russia]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]].<ref name=VanZundert2000>{{cite journal|last=Van Zundert|first=A|last2=Goerig|first2=M|title=August Bier 1861-1949.

Although he was arguably the most accomplished surgeon of his time, not all of his operations were successful. [[Hugo Stinnes]] (a [[Business magnate]] and politician who was among the wealthiest men in the world at that time) died on 10 April 1924, about a month after Bier performed a [[cholecystectomy]] on him.<ref name=LDS1924>{{cite news|author=|title=Hugo Stinnes dead; was one of the world's richest men and German leader|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Lewiston Daily Sun|page=1,7|location=Lewiston, Maine|date=1924-04-11|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&dat=19240409&id=urkgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=emkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1769,663407|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> On 24 February 1925, Bier performed an [[appendectomy]] on [[Friedrich Ebert]], the first [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|President of Germany]].<ref name=EDR1925>{{cite news|author=|title=German president has appendicitis|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Evening Record|page=2|publisher=Ellensburg Daily Record|location=Ellensburg, Washington|date=1925-02-24|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&dat=19250224&id=qdQrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=koQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6522,2262802|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> Ebert — who had signed the [[Weimar Constitution]] into law in 1919 following Germany's defeat in [[World War I]] — died of [[septic shock]] four days after his appendectomy.<ref name=Kershaw>{{cite book|last=Kershaw|first=I|title=Hitler, 1889-1936: Hubris|page=267|publisher=W.

Upon Ebert's death, retired [[Field Marshal (Germany)|Field Marshal]] and national hero [[Paul von Hindenburg]] was elected as his successor. Hindenburg was among the main proponents of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|Dolchstoßlegende]] ("Stab-in-the-back myth"), and his election as President of Germany is widely viewed as the beginning of the end of the short-lived [[Weimar Republic]]. Hindenburg played an important (though probably unintended) role in the [[Nazi Party]]'s rise to power. When Hindenburg died in office on 2 August 1934, [[Adolf Hitler]] declared the office of President vacant and, as "[[Führer]] und [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of the Third Reich (1933–1945)|Reichskanzler]] (''Chancellor of the Reich'')", made himself [[head of state]].

Bier was Chief Surgeon at the Charité in Berlin until 1928, when [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]] (1875{{ndash}}1951) assumed the position. Bier remained at the Charité as Professor Emeritus until his retirement in 1932. Ironically, Sauerbruch treated President von Hindenburg when he was dying of [[lung cancer]] in 1934.

==Sports medicine==
Bier is also considered to be a pioneer in the field of [[sports medicine]], having played a pivotal role in establishing it as a discipline. Along with [[Arthur Mallwitz]] (1880{{ndash}}1968), Bier organized the first lectures in sports medicine at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] in 1919.<ref name=Beamish2006>{{cite book|last=Beamish|first=R|last2=Ritchie|first2=I|title=Fastest, Highest, Strongest: A Critique of High-Performance Sport|chapter="Sport", German traditions, and the development of "training"|pages=53|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2006|isbn=978-0415770422|url=http://books.google.com/?id=PqFSH4PaU60C&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=August+Bier+established+the+science+of+sports+medicine.#v=onepage&q=Bier&f=false}}</ref><ref name=Berg2002>{{cite journal|last=Berg|first=A|last2=König|first2=D|title=History of sports medicine in germany with special reference to the university of Freiburg|journal=European Journal of Sport Science|volume=2|issue=4|pages=1–7|year=2002|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1080/17461390200072402|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17461390200072402#preview}}</ref>

Bier had been director of the ''[[Academy for Exercise and Physical Education|Akademie für Sport und Leibeserziehung]]'' ("Academy for Exercise and Physical Training") in Berlin. Following Bier's retirement in 1932, Sauerbruch temporarily headed the Academy until 1933, when [[Karl Gebhardt]] (1897{{ndash}}1948) was put in charge. In 1933 Gebhardt was appointed director of [[Hohenlychen Hospital]], which became the first sports medicine clinic in Germany and was generously funded by the government. Gebhardt became the first professor of sports medicine in Berlin and in 1933 was appointed to the ''[[Deutsche Hochschule für Leibesübungen]]'' (German College for Physical Education). Gebhardt expanded on Bier’s methods, adopting an academic approach to sports medicine and awarding degrees.<ref name=Silver2011>{{cite journal|last=Silver|first=JR|title=Karl Gebhardt (1897–1948): a lost man|journal=Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|volume=41|issue=4|pages=366–71|year=2011|pmid=22184577|pmc=|doi=10.4997/JRCPE.2011.417|url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_41_4/silver.pdf}}</ref>

==Awards==
The title of [[Geheimrat]] was bestowed upon Bier by German Emperor Wilhelm II.<ref name=Little1962/> On 24 November 1936, Bier received the [[Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches|Eagle Shield of the German Reich]]. On 30 January 1938, Bier became one of only nine people to have received the [[German National Prize for Art and Science]],<ref name=Nimmergut2001>{{cite book|last=Nimmergut|first=J|title=Deutsche Orden und Ehrenzeichen bis 1945 (German medals and decorations to 1945)|volume=Band 4: Württemberg II – Deutsches Reich (Volume 4: Württemberg II - German Empire)|page=1915|publisher=Zentralstelle für Wissenschaftliche Ordenskunde|location=Munich|year=2001|isbn=3-00-001396-2|language=German|url=}}</ref> an award created by Adolf Hitler that year as a replacement for the [[Nobel Prize]], which he had forbidden Germans to accept. The German National Prize for Art and Science is the rarest of all awards given in [[Nazi Germany]], even rarer than the [[German Order (decoration)|German Order]].
