The word ''progeria'' comes from the Greek words "pro" ([[:wikt:πρό|πρό]]), meaning "before", and "gēras" ([[:wikt:γῆρας|γῆρας]]), meaning "old age".

==Signs and symptoms==
Children with progeria usually develop the first symptoms during their first few months.   The earliest symptoms may include a  [[failure to thrive]] and a localized [[scleroderma]]-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent usually around 18–24 months. Limited growth, full-body [[alopecia]], and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow recessed jaw, and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria. Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to get worse as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, [[atherosclerosis]], kidney failure, loss of eyesight, hair loss, and [[cardiovascular]] problems. Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of elderly people. The face is usually wrinkled, with a larger head in relation to the body, a narrow face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals do usually retain normal mental and motor development.

In normal conditions, the ''[[LMNA]]'' gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A. There is a farnesyl functional group attached to the carboxyl-terminus of its structure. The farnesyl group allows prelamin A to attach temporarily to the nuclear rim. Once the protein is attached, the farnesyl group is removed. Failure to remove this farnesyl group, permanently affixes the protein to the nuclear rim. Without its farnesyl group, prelamin A is referred to as [[lamin A]]. Lamin A, along with lamin B and lamin C, make up the [[nuclear lamina]], which provides structural support to the nucleus.

Before the late 20th century, research on progeria yielded very little information about the syndrome. In 2003, the cause of progeria was discovered to be a [[point mutation]] in position 1824 of the ''LMNA'' gene, in which cytosine is replaced with thymine. This mutation causes [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the ''LMNA'' gene to stop too early, which results in the creation of an abnormally short mRNA transcript. This mRNA strand, when [[translation (biology)|translated]], yields an abnormal variant of the prelamin A protein whose farnesyl group cannot be removed. Because its farnesyl group cannot be removed, this abnormal protein, referred to as [[progerin]], is permanently affixed to the nuclear rim, and therefore does not become part of the nuclear lamina. Without lamin A, the nuclear lamina is unable to provide the [[nuclear envelope]] with adequate structural support, causing it to take on an abnormal shape.<ref name = "Cao">{{cite journal

Unlike "[[DNA repair-deficiency disorder|accelerated aging diseases]]" (such as [[Werner's syndrome]], [[Cockayne's syndrome]], or [[xeroderma pigmentosum]]), progeria is not caused by defective [[DNA repair]]. Because these diseases cause changes in different aspects of aging, but never in every aspect, they are often called "segmental progerias".<ref>{{cite journal | author=Best,BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is suspected according to signs and symptoms, such as skin changes, abnormal growth, and loss of hair. A genetic test for LMNA mutations can confirm the diagnosis of progeria.<ref name="titlegenome.gov1 | Learning About Progeria">{{cite web |url=http://www.genome.gov/11007255#isthere |publisher=genome.gov | title=Learning About Progeria |accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.progeriaresearch.org/diagnostic_testing.html |title=Progeria Research Foundation &#124; The PRF Diagnostic Testing Program |accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref>

==Treatment==
No treatments have been proven effective. Most treatment focuses on reducing complications (such as cardiovascular disease) with [[heart bypass]] surgery or low-dose [[aspirin]].<ref name="titleProgeria: Treatment - MayoClinic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/progeria/DS00936/DSECTION=7 |title=Progeria: Treatment|publisher=MayoClinic.com |accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref> Children may also benefit from a high-energy diet.

[[File:Medicationsthatinhibitfarnesylation.jpeg|thumb|250px|left| Potential therapeutic targets for the inhibition of progerin farnesylation]]
A type of anticancer drug, the [[farnesyltransferase inhibitor]]s (FTIs), has been proposed, but their use has been mostly limited to [[animal model]]s.<ref name="pmid16942914">{{cite journal |author=Meta M, Yang SH, Bergo MO, Fong LG, Young SG |title=Protein farnesyltransferase inhibitors and progeria |journal=[[Trends Mol Med]] |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=480–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16942914 |doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2006.08.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471-4914(06)00175-4}}</ref> A Phase II clinical trial using the FTI [[lonafarnib]] began in May 2007.<ref name="ls1">{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00425607|Phase II Trial of Lonafarnib (a Farnesyltransferase Inhibitor) for Progeria}}</ref> In studies on the cells another anti-cancer drug, [[rapamycin]], caused removal of [[progerin]] from the nuclear membrane through [[autophagy]].<ref name = "Cao"/><ref>{{cite journal|title=New Drug Hope for ‘Aging’ Kids|journal=Nature|volume=333|page=142|year=2011|doi=10.1126/science.333.6039.142-b |author=Staff writer|issue=6039}}</ref> It has been proved that [[pravastatin]] and [[zoledronate]] are effective drugs when it comes to the blocking of farnesyl group production. However, it is important to remember  that no treatment is able to cure progeria.

Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are drugs which inhibit the activity of an enzyme needed in order to make a link between progerin proteins and farnesyl groups. This link generates the permanent attachment of the progerin to the nuclear rim. In progeria, cellular damage can be appreciated because that attachment takes place and the nucleus is not in a normal state. Lonafarnib is an FTI, which means it can avoid this link, so progerin can not remain attached to the nucleus rim and it now has a more normal state.
The delivery of Lonafarnib is not approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Therefore, it can only be used in certain clinical trials. Until the treatment of FTIs is implemented in progeria children we will not know its effects—which are positive in mice.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Inhibiting farnesylation of progerin prevents the characteristic nuclear blebbing of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome|journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=102|year=2005|author= Capell BC et al. |issue=36|pmc=1200293|pmid=16129833|doi=10.1073/pnas.0506001102|pages=12879–84}}</ref>

[[Pravastatin]], traded as Pravachol or Selektine, is included in the family of statins. As well as [[zoledronate]] (also known as Zometa and Reclast, which is a bisphosphonate), its utility in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is the prevention of farnesyl groups formation, which progerin needs to provoke the disease.
Some animal trials have been realized using FTIs or a combination of [[pravastatin]] and [[zoledronate]] so as to observe whether they are capable of reversing abnormal nuclei.
The results, obtained by blinded electron microscopic analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy, showed that nucleus abnormalities could be reversed in transgenic mice expressing progerin. The reversion was also observed in vivo—cultured cells from human subjects with progeria—due to the action of the pharmacs, which block protein prenylation (transfer of a farnesyl polypeptide to C-terminal cysteine). The authors of that trial add, when it comes to the results, that: “They further suggest that skin biopsy may be useful to determine if protein farnesylation inhibitors are exerting effects in subjects with HGPS in clinical trials”.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Blocking protein farnesylation improves nuclear shape abnormalities in keratinocytes of mice expressing the prelamin A variant in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome|journal= Landes Bioscience |volume=1|year=2010 Sep-Oct |author= Wang Y et al.|issue=5|pmc=3037539|pmid=21326826|doi=10.4161/nucl.1.5.12972|pages=432–9}}</ref>
Unlike FTIs, [[pravastatin]] and [[zoledronate]] were approved by the U.S. FDA (in 2006 and 2001 respectively), although they are not sold as a treatment for progeria. [[Pravastatin]] is used to decrease cholesterol levels and [[zoledronate]] to prevent [[hypercalcaemia]].

[[Rapamycin]], also known as [[Sirolimus]], is a [[macrolide]]. There are recent studies concerning rapamycin which conclude that it can minimize the phenotypic effects of progeria fibroblasts. Other observed consequences of its use are: abolishment of nuclear blebbing, degradation of progerin in affected cells and reduction of insoluble progerin aggregates formation. All these results do not come from any clinical trial, although it is believed that the treatment might benefit HGPS kids.<ref name = "Cao"/>

A 2012 study showed that the cancer drug [[Lonafarnib]] can be used to treat progeria.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Jon|title=Experimental Drug Is First To Help Kids With Premature-Aging Disease|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/09/25/161691083/experimental-drug-is-first-to-help-kids-with-premature-aging-disease?|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=September 22, 2012}}</ref> 

It should always be taken in account that no treatment is delivered in order to cure Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome; all potential drugs are in pre-clinical stages.

Although there may not be any successful treatments for progeria itself, there are treatments for the problems it causes, such as arthritic, respiratory, and cardiovascular problems.

Classical Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome is usually caused by a sporadic mutation taking place during the early stages of embryo development. It is almost never passed on from affected parent to child, as affected children rarely live long enough to have children themselves.

There have been only two cases in which a healthy person was known to carry the LMNA mutation that causes progeria. These carriers were identified because they passed it on to their children.<ref name=Kork08/> One family from India has five children with progeria, though not the classical HGPS type;<ref>Grant, Matthew (22 February 2005).

===Lamin A===

[[Lamin A]] is a major component of a protein [[scaffold]] on the inner edge of the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] called the [[nuclear lamina]] that helps organize nuclear processes such as [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] synthesis.

Prelamin A contains a [[CAAX box]] at the [[C-terminus]] of the protein (where C is a [[cysteine]] and A is any [[aliphatic]] [[list of standard amino acids|amino acids]]). This ensures that the cysteine is [[prenylation|farnesylated]] and allows prelamin A to bind [[Cell membrane|membranes]], specifically the nuclear membrane. After prelamin A has been localized to the cell nuclear membrane, the C-terminal amino acids, including the farnesylated cysteine, are cleaved off by a specific [[protease]]. The resulting protein, now lamin A, is no longer membrane-bound, and carries out functions inside the nucleus.

In HGPS, the recognition site that the enzyme requires for cleavage of prelamin A to lamin A is mutated. Lamin A cannot be produced, and prelamin A builds up on the nuclear membrane, causing a characteristic nuclear [[blebbing]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lans H, Hoeijmakers JH |title=Cell biology: ageing nucleus gets out of shape |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7080 |pages=32–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16511477 |doi=10.1038/440032a |url=}}</ref> This results in the symptoms of progeria, although the relationship between the misshapen nucleus and the symptoms is not known.

A study that compared HGPS patient cells with the skin cells from young and elderly normal human subjects found similar defects in the HGPS and elderly cells, including [[down-regulation]] of certain nuclear proteins, increased [[DNA]] damage, and [[demethylation]] of [[histone]], leading to reduced [[heterochromatin]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Scaffidi P, Misteli T | title=Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging | journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=May&nbsp;19, 2006 | volume=312 | issue=5776 | pages=1059–63 | pmid=16645051 | doi=10.1126/science.1127168 | pmc=1855250}}</ref> [[Nematode]]s over their lifespan show progressive lamin changes comparable to HGPS in all cells but [[neuron]]s and [[gamete]]s.<ref name="pmid16269543">{{cite journal |author=Haithcock E, Dayani Y, Neufeld E, ''et al.'' |title=Age-related changes of nuclear architecture in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |journal=[[Proc.

A mouse [[animal model|model]] of progeria exists, though in the mouse, the [[LMNA]] prelamin A is not mutated. Instead, [[ZMPSTE24]], the specific protease that is required to remove the C-terminus of prelamin A, is missing.

Fong et al. use a [[farnesyl transferase inhibitor]] (FTI) in this mouse model to inhibit protein farnesylation of prelamin A. Treated mice had greater grip strength and lower likelihood of [[rib fracture]] and may live longer than untreated mice.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Fong, L. G. ''et al.''| title=A&nbsp;Protein Farnesyltransferase Inhibitor Ameliorates Disease in a Mouse Model of Progeria | journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=March&nbsp;17, 2006 | volume=311 | issue=5767 | pages=1621–3| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1124875v1 |pmid=16484451 | doi=10.1126/science.1124875}}</ref>

This method does not directly "cure" the underlying cause of progeria. This method prevents prelamin A from going to the nucleus in the first place so that no prelamin A can build up on the nuclear membrane, but equally, there is no production of normal lamin A in the nucleus. Lamin A does not appear to be necessary for life; mice in which the ''Lmna'' gene is knocked out show no embryological symptoms (they develop an [[Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy]]-like condition postnatally).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sullivan et al.| title=Loss of A-type lamin expression compromises nuclear envelope integrity leading to muscular dystrophy. | journal=J Cell Biol. | date=November 29, 1999 |pmid=10579712 | doi=10.1083/jcb.147.5.913 | volume=147 | issue=5 | pmc=2169344 | pages=913–20}}</ref> This implies that it is the buildup of prelamin A in the wrong place, rather than the loss of the normal function of lamin A, that causes the disease.

It was hypothesized that part of the reason that treatment with an FTI such as [[alendronate]] is inefficient is due to [[prenylation]] by [[geranylgeranyltransferase]]. Since [[statins]] inhibit geranylgeranyltransferase, the combination of an FTI and statins was tried, and markedly improved "the aging-like phenotypes of mice deficient in the metalloproteinase Zmpste24, including growth retardation, loss of weight, lipodystrophy, hair loss, and bone defects".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Varela I, Pereira S, Ugalde AP, ''et al.'' |title=Combined treatment with statins and aminobisphosphonates extends longevity in a mouse model of human premature aging |journal=Nat.

==Popular culture==
Perhaps one of the earliest influences of progeria on popular culture occurred in the 1922 short story ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'' by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] (and later released as a [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|feature film]] in 2008). The main character, Benjamin Button, is born as a seventy-year-old man and ages backwards; it has been suggested that this was inspired by progeria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maloney WJ |title=Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome: its presentation in F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' and its oral manifestations |journal=J. Dent. Res. |volume=88 |issue=10 |pages=873–6 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19783794 |doi=10.1177/0022034509348765 |url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/88/10/873.full }}</ref>

[[Charles Dickens]] may have described a case of progeria in the family of Smallweed of  ''[[Bleak House]]'', specifically in the grandfather and his grandchildren Judy and twin brother Bart.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Singh V | year = 2010 | title = Reflections: neurology and the humanities.

A Bollywood movie, [[Paa (film)|Paa]], was made about the condition; in it, the lead ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) played an 11-year-old child affected by progeria.

The movie ''[[Renaissance (film)|Renaissance]]'' deals with progeria.

In episode sixteen of the first season of the television show The X-Files, the corrupt doctor had experimented on children with Progeria.

In the 4 book series ''[[Otherland]]'', by Tad Williams, one of the main characters suffers from progeria.

Harold Kushner's 1978 book ''[[When Bad Things Happen to Good People]]'', which explores God and the problem of evil, was written in response to his 14 year old son's death by progeria.

South African artist/hip hop artist [[Leon Botha]] was one of the oldest known Progeria sufferers, surviving to the age of 26 before his death in June 2011.
