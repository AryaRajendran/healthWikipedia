'''Immunodeficiency''' (or '''immune deficiency''') is a state in which the [[immune system]]'s ability to fight [[infectious disease]] is compromised or entirely absent. Immunodeficiency may also decrease [[cancer immunosurveillance]]. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired ("secondary") but some people are born with defects in their immune system, or [[primary immunodeficiency]]. Transplant patients take medications to suppress their immune system as an anti-rejection measure, as do some patients suffering from an over-active immune system. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be '''immunocompromised'''. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to [[opportunistic infection]]s, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone.

==Types==

===By affected component===
*[[Humoral immune deficiency]], with signs or symptoms depending on the cause, but generally include signs of [[hypogammaglobulinemia]] (decrease of one or more types of antibodies) with presentations including repeated mild [[respiratory infection]]s, and/or [[agammaglobulinemia]] (lack of all or most antibody production) which results in frequent severe infections and is often fatal.<ref>[http://www.utoronto.ca/kids/Immunodeficiency.htm Immunodeficiency] by Dr. Saul Greenberg. University of Toronto. Last updated, on February 5, 2009</ref>
*[[T cell deficiency]], often causes secondary disorders such as [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]].<ref name=Schwartz2011>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/888372-overview Medscape > T-cell Disorders]. Author: Robert A Schwartz, MD, MPH; Chief Editor: Harumi Jyonouchi, MD. Updated: May 16, 2011</ref>
*{{anchor|granulocyte}}''Granulocyte deficiency'', including decreased numbers of [[granulocyte]]s (called [[granulocytopenia]] or, if absent, [[agranulocytosis]]) such as of [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s (termed [[neutropenia]]). Granulocyte deficiencies also include decreased function of individual granulocytes, such as in [[chronic granulomatous disease]].
*[[Asplenia]], where there is no function of the [[spleen]]
*[[Complement deficiency]] is where the function of the [[complement system]] is deficient

In reality, immunodeficiency often affects multiple components, with notable examples including [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] (which is primary) and [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (which is secondary).

===Primary or secondary===
Distinction between primary versus secondary immunodeficiencies are based on, respectively, whether the cause originates in the immune system itself or is, in turn, due to insufficiency of a supporting component of it or an external decreasing factor of it.

====Primary immunodeficiency (PID)====
{{Main|Primary immunodeficiency}}

A number of [[rare disease]]s feature a heightened susceptibility to [[infection]]s from childhood onward.  Primary Immunodeficiency is also known as congenital immunodeficiencies.<ref name="BasicImmunology">Basic Immunology: Functions and Disorders of the Immune System, 3rd Ed. 2011.</ref>  Many of these disorders are [[genetic disorder|hereditary]] and are [[autosomal recessive]] or [[Sex linkage|X-linked]]. There are over 80 recognised primary immunodeficiency syndromes; they are generally grouped by the part of the immune system that is malfunctioning, such as [[lymphocyte]]s or [[granulocyte]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosen FS, Cooper MD, Wedgwood RJ |title=The primary immunodeficiencies |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=333 |issue=7 |pages=431–40 |year=1995 |pmid=7616993|doi=10.1056/NEJM199508173330707}}</ref>

The treatment of primary immunodeficiencies depends on the nature of the defect, and may involve antibody infusions, long-term antibiotics and (in some cases) [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell transplantation]].

====Secondary immunodeficiencies====
{{Further|Immunosuppression}}
{{anchor|acquired}}Secondary immunodeficiencies, also known as acquired immunodeficiencies, can result from various [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] agents, for example, [[malnutrition]], [[aging]] and particular medications (e.g. [[chemotherapy]], [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s, [[immunosuppressive drug]]s after [[organ transplant]]s, [[glucocorticoid]]s). For medications, the term [[immunosuppression]] generally refers to both beneficial and potential adverse effects of decreasing the function of the immune system, while the term ''immunodeficiency'' generally refers solely to the adverse effect of increased risk for infection.

Many specific diseases directly or indirectly cause immunosuppression. This includes many types of [[cancer]], particularly those of the bone marrow and blood cells ([[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], [[multiple myeloma]]), and certain chronic infections. Immunodeficiency is also the hallmark of [[AIDS|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (AIDS),<ref name="BasicImmunology" /> caused by the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). HIV directly infects a small number of [[T helper cell]]s, and also impairs other immune system responses indirectly.

== Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity ==
There are a large number of immunodeficiency syndromes that present clinical and laboratory characteristics of autoimmunity. The decreased ability of the immune system to clear infections in these patients may be responsible for causing autoimmunity through perpetual immune system activation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grammatikos A, Tsokos G |title= Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity: lessons from systemic lupus erythematosus |journal= Trends Mol Med |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=101–108 |year=2012 |pmid= 22177735}}</ref>

One example is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) where multiple autoimmune diseases are seen, e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune thyroid disease.
Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency, is another example. Pancytopenia, rashes, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are commonly seen in these patients. Presence of multiple uncleared viral infections due to lack of perforin are thought to be responsible.
In addition to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma and type 1 diabetes are also seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).
Recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammation of the gut and lungs are seen in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) as well. CGD is a caused by decreased production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase by neutrophils.
Hypomorphic RAG mutations are seen in patients with midline granulomatous disease; an autoimmune disorder that is commonly seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegenr’s disease) and NK/T cell lymphomas. 
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients also present with eczema, autoimmune manifestations, recurrent bacterial infections and lymphoma. 
In autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g. hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
Finally, IgA deficiency is also sometimes associated with the development of autoimmune and atopic phenomena.
