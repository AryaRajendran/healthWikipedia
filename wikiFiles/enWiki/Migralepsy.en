'''Migralepsy''' is a rare condition in which a [[migraine]] is followed, within an hour period, by an [[epileptic seizure]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1142731-overview "Migraine Variants" - eMedicine]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=RVYv54RlXuIC&pg=PA2737&lpg=PA2737&dq=Migralepsy&source=bl&ots=Jyq2DYctmJ&sig=WkYtTPNHS1bqef9c2V9JvvJm-Ec&hl=en&ei=3NmeS87QNpDctgP9neXUCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAUQ6AEwADgy#v=onepage&q=Migralepsy&f=false "Epilepsy: A Comprehensive Textbook, Volume 1" - Google Books]</ref> Because of the similarities in signs, symptoms, and treatments of both conditions, such as the [[neurological disorder|neurological basis]], the [[lifestyle medicine|psychological issues]], and the [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic distress]] that is created from them, they individually increase the likelihood of causing the other. However, also because of the sameness, they are often [[medical error|misdiagnosed]] for each other, as migralepsy rarely occurs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2003.07.003 |title=Epilepsy and migraine |year=2003 |last1=Bigal |first1=M.E |last2=Lipton |first2=R.B |last3=Cohen |first3=J |last4=Silberstein |first4=S.D |journal=Epilepsy & Behavior |volume=4 |pages=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10194-010-0191-6 |title=Comorbidity between headache and epilepsy in a pediatric headache center |year=2010 |last1=Toldo |first1=Irene |last2=Perissinotto |first2=Egle |last3=Menegazzo |first3=Francesca |last4=Boniver |first4=Clementina |last5=Sartori |first5=Stefano |last6=Salviati |first6=Leonardo |last7=Clementi |first7=Maurizio |last8=Montagna |first8=Pasquale |last9=Battistella |first9=Pier Antonio |journal=The Journal of Headache and Pain |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=235–40 |pmid=20112041}}</ref>

==Etiology==

The connection between migraines and epileptic seizures is currently being researched and not much is known. Patients have been shown to have had migraines long before developing epileptic symptoms, creating the possibility of severe cases of migraines creating [[epilepsy]].<ref>[http://www.migraine-aura.org/content/e27891/e27265/e42285/e55504/index_en.html "Pathomechanisms of persistent aura" - Migraine Aura Foundation]</ref><ref name="USD">[http://google.com/search?q=cache:OOlwRZAQk1IJ:www.headaches.org/pdf/HeadacheResearchSummit/Michael_Rogawski.pdf+Migralepsy&cd=11&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us "Migraine, Epilepsy, and Migralepsy: Myths and Realities" - UC Davis Department of Neurology]</ref> However, not every migraine may be accompanied by a seizure and sometimes the seizures happen without any migraine involvement. Due to this, finding the origin of migralepsy is difficult and enveloped somewhere in the overlap between both conditions. Some patients have shown that their relatives suffered from migraines as well and even some from migralepsy, forming the possibility that migralepsy is [[Genetics|genetic]] in origin and forms only rarely as both, generally resulting in only one condition or the other.<ref>{{cite book |title=Migraine and other headache disorders |last=Lipton |first=Richard B. |authorlink= |coauthors=Marcelo Eduardo Bigal |year=2006 |publisher=[[Informa Healthcare]] |location= |isbn=0-8493-3695-3 |page= |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QmXkWzTTZjcC&pg=PA228&lpg=PA228&dq=Migralepsy&source=bl&ots=6Miw4R7O-I&sig=SNbWmDBuQEYb3cRSUxtTocdyTDE&hl=en&ei=GayeS_LrL4yysgPcy6y_Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CCEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=Migralepsy&f=false |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/20011979/Epilepsy-Migraine---More-than-just-a-headache "Epilepsy Migraine - More than just a headache" - .docstoc]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.00349.x |title=A Case of 'Migralepsy' |year=2005 |last1=Milligan |first1=Tracey A. |last2=Bromfield |first2=Edward |journal=Epilepsia |volume=46 |pages=2}}</ref>

==Problems of Diagnosis==

Because epileptic seizures may occur with a [[side effect]] that resembles migraine aura, it is complicated to diagnose whether a patient is having a normal epileptic episode or if it is a true migraine that is then being followed by a seizure, which would be a true sign of migralepsy. Many neurological symptoms can only be expressed by the patient, who can confuse different feelings, especially when the symptoms of a migraine are extremely similar to that of a seizure. Thus, many physicians are reluctant to consider migralepsy to be a true condition, considering its rarity, and those that do believe in it are prone to [[Overdiagnosis|over-diagnose]] it, leading to more problems in terms of finding the truth of the condition.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Clinical Guide to Epileptic Syndromes and Their Treatment |last=Panayiotopoulos |first=C.

However, it has been found that [[Electroencephalography|EEG scans]] have been able to differentiate between migraine auras and auras related to epilepsy. It has generally been seen that EEG scans are not as helpful in determining facets of migraines as they are with epilepsy. Though they are able to work in determining the starting and ending points of migraines and the overlap of epileptic episodes during or after them, even if the scans are still lacking in considerable necessary data and confusing results. EEG scans have been able to observe seizures that occur in between the [[aura (symptom)|aura]] and [[headache]] phase of migraines  and such occurrences have been termed [[intercalated seizures]].<ref>[http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/migraine_eeg.html "The EEG: Differential diagnosis of migraine and epilepsy" - Epilepsy.com]</ref>

==Treatment==

Since migralepsy is, for all intents and purposes, a combination of migraines and epilepsy, the medication for the conditions supplied individually can be combined jointly in order to lessen the effects of both. It is also helpful that many [[Anticonvulsant|antiepileptic drugs]] also work as [[antimigraines]], lessening the number of medications that must be taken. Thus, while neither can be cured, they can be treated so that they occur less frequently and allow a patient to live a relatively normal life.<ref name="USD"/>
