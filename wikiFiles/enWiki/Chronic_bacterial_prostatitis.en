'''Chronic bacterial [[prostatitis]]''' is a [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] of the [[prostate]] gland. It should be distinguished from other forms of prostatitis such as [[Acute prostatitis|acute bacterial prostatitis]] and [[Chronic pelvic pain syndrome|chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS)]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Chronic bacterial prostatitis is a relatively rare condition that usually presents with an intermittent [[Urinary tract infection|UTI]]-type picture. It is defined as recurrent urinary tract infections in men originating from a chronic infection in the prostate. Symptoms may be completely absent until there is also bladder infection, and the most troublesome problem is usually recurrent [[cystitis]].<ref name="pmid16409145">{{cite journal |author=Habermacher GM, Chason JT, Schaeffer AJ |title=Prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome |journal=Annu. Rev. Med. |volume=57 |issue= 1|pages=195–206 |year=2006 |pmid=16409145 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.57.011205.135654}}</ref> Chronic bacterial prostatitis occurs in less than 5% of patients with prostate-related non-[[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|BPH]] lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Dr. Weidner, Professor of Medicine, Department of Urology, University of Gießen, has stated: "In studies of 656 men, we seldom found chronic bacterial prostatitis. It is truly a rare disease. Most of those were E-coli."<ref name="pmid14535851">{{cite journal |author=Schneider H, Ludwig M, Hossain HM, Diemer T, Weidner W |title=The 2001 Gießen Cohort Study on patients with prostatitis syndrome--an evaluation of inflammatory status and search for microorganisms 10 years after a first analysis |journal=Andrologia |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=258–62 |year=2003 |pmid=14535851| doi = 10.1046/j.1439-0272.2003.00586.x}}</ref> 

==Diagnosis==
In chronic bacterial prostatitis there are bacteria in the prostate, but there may be no symptoms or milder symptoms than occur with [[acute prostatitis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=NHS Choices |title=Prostatitis - Symptoms}}http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/prostatitis/pages/symptoms.aspx</ref> The prostate infection is diagnosed by culturing urine as well as prostate fluid (expressed prostatic secretions or EPS) which are obtained by the doctor performing a rectal exam and putting pressure on the prostate. If no fluid is recovered after this prostatic massage, a post massage urine should also contain any prostatic bacteria. [[Prostate specific antigen]] levels may be elevated, although there is no malignancy. [[Semen analysis]] is a useful diagnostic tool.<ref name="pmid19377490">{{cite journal |author=Magri V, Wagenlehner FM, Montanari E, ''et al.'' |title=Semen analysis in chronic bacterial prostatitis: diagnostic and therapeutic implications |journal=Asian J. Androl. |volume= 11|issue= 4|pages= 461–77|year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19377490 |doi=10.1038/aja.2009.5 |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment requires prolonged courses (4–8 weeks) of antibiotics that penetrate the prostate well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Charalabopoulos K, Karachalios G, Baltogiannis D, Charalabopoulos A, Giannakopoulos X, Sofikitis N |title=Penetration of antimocrobial agents into the prostate |journal=Chemotherapy |volume=49 |issue=6|pages=269–279|year=2003 |pmid=14671426 |doi=10.1159/000074526}}</http://home.swipnet.se/isop/Penetration.pdf</ref> These include [[nitrofurantoin]], [[quinolone]]s ([[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]]), [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfas]] ([[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole|Bactrim, Septra]]), [[doxycycline]] and [[macrolide]]s ([[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]]). Persistent infections may be helped in 80% of patients by the use of [[alpha blocker]]s ([[tamsulosin]] (Flomax), [[alfuzosin]]), or long term low dose antibiotic therapy.<ref name="pmid12629373">{{cite journal |author=Shoskes DA, Hakim L, Ghoniem G, Jackson CL |title=Long-term results of multimodal therapy for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome |journal=J. Urol. |volume=169 |issue=4 |pages=1406–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12629373 |doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000055549.95490.3c}}</ref> Recurrent infections may be caused by inefficient urination (benign prostatic hypertrophy, neurogenic bladder), prostatic stones or a structural abnormality that acts as a reservoir for infection.

[[Escherichia coli]] extract and [[cranberry]] have a potentially preventive effect on the development of chronic bacterial prostatitis.<ref name="Kim-2010">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kim | first1 = SH. | last2 = Ha | first2 = US. | last3 = Lee | first3 = HR. | last4 = Sohn | first4 = DW. | last5 = Lee | first5 = SJ. | last6 = Kim | first6 = HW. | last7 = Han | first7 = CH. | last8 = Lee | first8 = CB. | last9 = Cho | first9 = YH. | title = Do Escherichia coli extract and cranberry exert preventive effects on chronic bacterial prostatitis?

The addition of [[prostate massage]] to courses of antibiotics was previously proposed as being beneficial.<ref name="pmid10527258">{{cite journal |author=Nickel JC, Downey J, Feliciano AE, Hennenfent B |title=Repetitive prostatic massage therapy for chronic refractory prostatitis: the Philippine experience |journal=Techniques in urology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=146–51 |year=1999 |pmid=10527258 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid12496826">{{cite journal |author=Shoskes DA, Zeitlin SI |title=Use of prostatic massage in combination with antibiotics in the treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal= Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=159–162 |year=1999 |pmid=12496826 |doi=10.1038/sj.pcan.4500308}}</ref> However, in more recent trials, this was not shown to improve outcome compared to antibiotics alone.<ref name="pmid16566972">{{cite journal |author=Ateya A, Fayez A, Hani R, Zohdy W, Gabbar MA, Shamloul R |title=Evaluation of prostatic massage in treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal=Urology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=674–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16566972 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2005.10.021}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Over time, the relapse rate is high, exceeding 50%. A 2007 study showed that repeated courses of combination antibiotics may eradicate infection in 83.9% of patients with clinical remission extending throughout a follow-up period of 30 months for 94% of these patients.<ref name="pmid17336504">{{cite journal |author=Magri V, Trinchieri A, Pozzi G, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy of repeated cycles of combination therapy for the eradication of infecting organisms in chronic bacterial prostatitis |journal=Int.
