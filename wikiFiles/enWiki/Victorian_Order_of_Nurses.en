==History==
[[Image:Countess of Aberdeen in Queen's U robes Topley.jpg|thumb|200px|Hamilton-Gordon was the first woman to receive an [[honorary degree]] in [[Canada]]. She is shown here in [[Queen's University]] robes, photographed by [[William James Topley]], in May 1897.]]
Lady [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Aberdeen]], wife of [[Governor General of Canada|Canadian Governor General]] [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]], visited [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] in 1896. While there, she heard many stories of women and children alone in remote areas of Canada as their husbands had to travel great distances for [[medical]] help. At a meeting of the [[National Council for Women]] in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], she was asked to create an order of visiting nurses in Canada. It was to be a memorial for the 60th anniversary of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s ascent to the [[throne]] of the [[British Empire]]. At [[Rideau Hall]] on February 10, 1897, The Right Honourable [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] hosted an [[inauguration]] to create the Victorian Order of Nurses "as a mode of commemoration by the [[Dominion of Canada|Dominion]] (Canada) of the Queen's [[Diamond Jubilee]]". In 1898, the first nurse training program was established for the Victorian Order of Nurses in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].    

In 1898, one of the first high profile projects for the VON was a call to women to join the Victorian Order of Nurses' Klondike contingent. Candidates had to be unmarried, at least twenty-eight years old, and be a graduate of a recognized nursing school. They were warned they would have to dress very plainly and not curl or crimp their hair. Four nurses were selected, three Canadians and one recent immigrant from England. They reached Dawson one month after the Sisters of St. Ann and found their skills desperately needed to care for the many victims of the typhoid epidemic that was raging through the Klondike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitepinepictures.com/seeds/ii/14/sidebar.html |title=Sidebar: Women of the Klondike |work=A Scattering of Seeds - The Creation of Canada |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>

The VON has helped Canada through many incidents including [[World War I]], the [[Halifax Explosion]] and [[World War II]]. More importantly, VON has been an important element of building community, creating opportunities for people to work together to meet their needs and those of their friends and neighbou

{{As of|2005}}, the VON, as it is almost universally known in Canada, was still the largest single, national homecare organization. With a staff of  more than 7,000 supported by more than 14,000 volunteers, they touch the lives of many Canadians daily.

VON Canada is structured into a national service provider and local charities. Both are governed by volunteer Board members. The National Board is composed of dedicated volunteers from across Canada elected by the representatives of the local branches. The local branches operate in each of their communities, raising funds and lobbying to meet specific needs.
