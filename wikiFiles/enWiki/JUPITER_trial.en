The '''JUPITER trial''' ('''J'''ustification for the '''U'''se of Statins in Primary '''P'''revention: An '''I'''ntervention '''T'''rial '''E'''valuating '''R'''osuvastatin trial) is a study aimed at evaluating whether [[statin]]s reduce [[heart attack]]s and strokes in people with normal [[cholesterol]] levels. 

== Study rationale ==
JUPITER was a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized]] [[double-blind]] [[placebo-controlled study]] investigating the use of [[rosuvastatin]] in the [[primary prevention]] of [[cardiovascular disease]]. The trial focused on patients with normal [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) [[cholesterol]] levels but increased levels of [[high-sensitivity C-reactive protein]] (hs-CRP). JUPITER was the first [[clinical trial]] to indicate that statin therapy may provide benefit to patients with low-to-normal LDL levels and no known cardiovascular disease.<ref name=ET1>[http://endocrinetoday.com/view.aspx?rid=32617 "JUPITER: Using hsCRP to identify primary prevention patients who may benefit from statin therapy"], ''Endocrine Today'', 25 November 2008</ref> The trial, which began in 2003, is directed by [[Paul Ridker]] of [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]].<ref name=infopage>[http://www.brighamandwomens.org/preventivemedicine/research/jupiter.aspx JUPITER trial information page], [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]]</ref>

Because half of all vascular events occur in patients with normal or low levels of LDL cholesterol, JUPITER was designed to determine whether hs-CRP testing could identify these patients, and whether statin therapy could prevent cardiovascular events among them.<ref name=rationale>{{cite journal |author=Ridker PM |title=Rosuvastatin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease among patients with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein: rationale and design of the JUPITER trial |journal=Circulation |volume=108 |issue=19 |pages=2292–7 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14609996 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000100688.17280.E6 |url=http://www.brighamandwomens.org/preventivemedicine/Research/Circv108p2292.pdf |last2=Jupiter Study |first2=Group}}</ref> Elevated hs-CRP levels are thought to be a [[biomarker]] of inflammation, and have been [[association (statistics)|associated]] with an increased risk of [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]], [[peripheral arterial disease]], and [[sudden cardiac death]].<ref name=rationale/>

== Study details ==
The trial analyzed 17,802 patients without evidence of heart disease but with high CRP levels. In 2008, results presented at the [[American Heart Association]] meeting and published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' found that patients with low-to-normal LDL cholesterol receiving rosuvastatin had a lower rate of major cardiovascular events. Compared to patients taking a [[placebo]], patients given rosuvastatin had reductions in LDL and CRP levels, and a reduction of 0.2% to 0.6% in their [[absolute risk]] of [[heart attack]], [[stroke]], and death at 1 year.<ref name=pmid18997196>{{cite journal |author=Ridker PM, Danielson E, Fonseca FA, ''et al.'' |title=Rosuvastatin to prevent vascular events in men and women with elevated C-reactive protein |journal=N.

=== Adverse events ===
The researchers noted small but significant increases in the rate of physician-reported [[diabetes]] and [[glycated hemoglobin]] values in the rosuvastatin group, an effect that has also been seen in studies with other statins.<ref name=pmid18997196/> This finding, along with concerns over the safety of very low LDL levels, rosuvastatin's higher cost compared to [[generic drug|generic]] statins, and the validity of biomarkers used in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, has been cited by those urging caution before expanding indications for statin treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hlatky MA |title=Expanding the orbit of primary prevention--moving beyond JUPITER |journal=N.

== Contrasting results from other studies ==

Some subsequent studies have contrasted with the JUPITER trial results, particularly on the role of C-reactive protein. A 2009 study employing [[Mendelian randomization]], published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', suggested that CRP does not play a causal role in cardiovascular disease, though it may still be a useful marker of cardiovascular disease risk.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = JAMA | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/302/1/37 | title = Genetic Loci Associated With C-Reactive Protein Levels and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease | author = Elliott P et al. | year = 2009 | volume = 302 | issue = 1 | page = 37&ndash;48 | pmid = 19567438 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.954 | pmc = 2803020}}</ref> The discordant results of this subsequent study provoked debate over the role and value of CRP as a biomarker and possible therapeutic target in heart disease.<ref name="nyt-followup"/>
