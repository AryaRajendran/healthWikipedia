'''Leukostasis''' (aka '''symptomatic hyperleukocytosis''')<ref name=UpToDate>{{cite web|last=Schiffer|first=Charles, MD|title=Hyperleukocytosis and Leukostasis|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis|work=UpToDate|accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> is a white blood cell count above 100,000/μL. It is characterized by abnormal [[Blood vessel|intravascular]] [[White blood cell|leukocyte]] aggregation and clumping. It is most often seen in [[leukemia]] patients. The [[brain]] and [[lung]]s are the two most commonly affected organs. Occluded microcirculation causes local hypoxemia and hemorrage manifesting as headache, blurred vision, transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular accidents and dyspnea. It is an [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] syndrome requiring aggressive [[Debulking|cytoreductive]] [[:wikt:modality|modalities]] including [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[leukapheresis]] to both reduce the number of circulating leukocytes and to break apart any aggregates that have already formed. It is different from leukemic infiltration which is a [[Neoplasm|neoplastic]] process where leukemic cells invade organs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html |title=Leukostasis |date= 1995-06-01 |work=Medical Subject Headings, 2009–2009-02-13 |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
