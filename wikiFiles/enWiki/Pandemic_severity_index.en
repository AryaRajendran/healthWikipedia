The '''pandemic severity index''' (PSI) is a proposed classification scale for reporting the severity of [[influenza pandemic]]s in the United States. The PSI was accompanied by a set of guidelines intended to help communicate appropriate actions for communities to follow in potential [[pandemic]] situations.<ref name=HHS>[[Department of Health & Human Services]], (2007) [http://www.pandemicflu.gov/plan/community/community_mitigation.pdf Interim Pre-Pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States— Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions] (Full Text of the Initial Report outlining PSI), [[Centers for Disease Control]], USA</ref> Released by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) on 1 February 2007, the PSI was designed to resemble the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] classification scheme.<ref>{{cite news | title=U.S. Health Officials Unveil Flu Pandemic Plan | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020101246.html | quote=U.S. health officials on Thursday outlined an early-warning system similar to that employed for hurricanes to protect and mobilize the country against a flu pandemic. |work=Washington Post |date=1 February 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-21 | first=Amanda | last=Gardner}}</ref><ref name=ties>{{cite news | last=Roos | first=Robert | coauthors=Lisa Schnirring | title=HHS ties pandemic mitigation advice to severity | publisher=[[CIDRAP]] News | date=1 Feb 2007 | url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/feb0107pandemic.html | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}</ref>

==Development==
The PSI was developed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) as a new pandemic influenza planning tool for use by states, communities, businesses and schools, as part of a drive to provide more specific community-level prevention measures.<ref name=unveils>{{cite press release | title=HHS unveils two new efforts to advance pandemic flu preparedness | publisher=Office of Enterprise Communication, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date=2007-02-01 | url=http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/2007/r070201a.htm | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}</ref> Although designed for domestic implementation, the HHS has not ruled out sharing the index and/or guidelines with interested international parties.<ref name=simple>{{cite news | last=Pellerin | first=Cheryl | title=Simple Planning Tools Can Help in Early Days of Pandemic | publisher=[[USINFO]] | date=12 Feb 2007 | url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/February/20070212130917lcnirellep0.3025629.html }}</ref>

The index and guidelines were developed by applying principles of [[epidemiology]] to data from the history of the last three major flu pandemics and [[seasonal flu]] transmission, mathematical models,  and input from experts and citizen focus groups.<ref name=ties/> Many "tried and true"<ref name=praise>{{cite news | last=Roos | first=Robert | coauthors=Lisa Schnirring | title=Experts give qualified praise to new pandemic guidance | publisher=[[CIDRAP]] News | date=2007-02-02 | url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/feb0207reactions.html | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}</ref> practices were combined together in a more structured manner:-

{{quote|"We also realize as we look back through history is what cities did – 44 cities did, is that many of these measures ultimately every city adopted at some point or another, and the difference may be in the timing of using these measures and whether they’re coordinated in an effective way for us to really gain the benefits of them."|Dr Martin Cetron, Director of CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine<ref name=transcript/>}}

==Context==
During the onset of a growing pandemic, local communities cannot rely upon widespread availability of [[antiviral drug]]s and [[influenza vaccine|vaccine]]s<ref name=simple/><ref name=usatoday>{{cite news

The goal of the index is to provide guidance as to what measures various organizations can enact that will slow down the progression of a pandemic, easing the burden of stress upon community resources while definite solutions, like drugs and vaccines, can be brought to bear on the situation. The CDC expects adoption of the PSI will allow early co-ordinated use of community mitigation measures to affect pandemic progression<ref name =ties/>

==Guidelines==
The index focuses less on how likely a disease will spread worldwide – that is, become a pandemic – and more upon how severe the epidemic actually is.<ref name = transcript>{{cite press release | title=Update of Pandemic Flu Preparedness | publisher=Office of Enterprise Communication, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control | date=1 February 2007 | url=http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/%20t070201.htm | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}</ref>
The main criterion used to measure pandemic severity will be [[case-fatality ratio]] (CFR), the percentage of deaths out of the total reported cases of the disease.<ref name=ties/>

The actual implementation of PSI alerts is expected to occur after the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) announces [[WHO pandemic phases|phase 6]] influenza transmission (human to human) in the United States. This would probably result in immediate announcement of a PSI level 3–4 situation.<ref name=ties/>

The analogy of "category" levels were introduced to provide an understandable connection to [[Tropical cyclone scales|hurricane classification]] schemes, with specific reference to the recent aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=unveils/><ref name=transcript/>
Like the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]], the PSI ranges from 1 to 5, with Category 1 pandemics being most mild (equivalent to [[seasonal flu]]) and level 5 being reserved for the most severe "worst-case" scenario pandemics (such as the 1918 [[Spanish flu]]).<ref name=ties/><ref name=unveils/>

The report recommends four primary measures for slowing down a pandemic:
* Isolation and treatment of people who have suspected or confirmed cases of pandemic influenza
* Voluntary home quarantine of household contacts of those with suspected or confirmed pandemic influenza
* Dismissing school classes and closing daycare centers
* Changing work schedules and canceling large public gatherings<ref name=HHS/>

These actions, when implemented, can have an overall effect of reducing the number of new cases of the disease; but they can carry potentially adverse consequences in terms of community and social disruption.<ref name=unveils/> The measures should have the most noticeable impact if implemented uniformly by organizations and governments across the US.<ref name=unveils/><ref name=simple/><ref name=praise/>

==Response==
While unveiling the PSI, Dr. [[Martin Cetron]], Director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the CDC, reported that early feedback to the idea of a pandemic classification scale has been "uniformly positive".<ref name=transcript/>

The [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy]] (CIDRAP) reports that the PSI has been "drawing generally high marks from public health officials and others, but they say the plan spells a massive workload for local planners". One MD praised that the PSI were "a big improvement over the previous guidance"; while historical influenza expert and author [[John M. Barry]] was more critical of the PSI, saying not enough emphasis was placed on basic health principles that could have an impact at the community level, adding "I'd feel a lot more comfortable with a lot more research [supporting them]"<ref name=praise/>

During the initial press releases in 2007, the CDC acknowledge that the PSI and the accompanying  guidelines were a work in progress and will likely undergo revision in the months following their release.<ref name=unveils/>
