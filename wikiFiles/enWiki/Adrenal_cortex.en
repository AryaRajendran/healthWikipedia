Situated along the perimeter of the [[adrenal gland]], the '''adrenal cortex''' mediates the stress response through the production of [[mineralocorticoid]]s and [[glucocorticoid]]s, including [[aldosterone]] and [[cortisol]] respectively. It is also a secondary site of [[androgen]] synthesis.<ref>{{AnatomyAtlasesMicroscopic|15|292}} - "Adrenal Gland"</ref>

==Layers==<!-- This section is linked from [[Reticular layer]] --> 

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Layer''' || '''Name''' || '''Primary product''' 
 |- 
 | Most superficial cortical layer || [[zona glomerulosa]] || [[mineralocorticoid]]s (e.g., [[aldosterone]]) 
 |- 
 | Middle cortical layer || [[zona fasciculata]]  || [[glucocorticoid]]s (e.g., [[cortisol]])
 |- 
 | Deepest cortical layer || [[zona reticularis]] || weak [[androgen]]s (e.g., [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], [[adrenosterone]])
|}
Notably, the reticularis in all animals is not always easily distinguishable and dedicated to androgen synthesis.  In rodents, for instance, the reticularis also generates corticosteroids (specifically [[corticosterone]], not cortisol).  The two layers are collectively referred to as the fasciculo-reticularis.
Female rodents also exhibit another cortical layer called the "X zone" whose function is not yet clear.

==Hormone synthesis==
All adrenocortical hormones are synthesized from [[cholesterol]].  [[Cholesterol]] is transported into the adrenal gland. The steps up to this point occur in many [[steroid]]-producing tissues. Subsequent steps to generate aldosterone and cortisol, however, primarily occur in the adrenal cortex:
* Progesterone → (hydroxylation at C21) → 11-[[Deoxycorticosterone]] → (two further hydroxylations at C11 and C18) → [[Aldosterone]]
* Progesterone → (hydroxylation at C17) → 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone → (hydroxylation at C21) → [[11-Deoxycortisol]] → (hydroxylation at C11) → [[Cortisol]]

==Production==
The adrenal cortex produces a number of different [[corticosteroid]] [[hormone]]s.

===Mineralocorticoids===
{{Main|Mineralocorticoids}}
They are produced in the [[zona glomerulosa]]. The primary [[mineralocorticoid]] is [[aldosterone]]. Its secretion is regulated by the [[oligopeptide]] [[angiotensin II]] (angiotensin II is regulated by [[angiotensin I]], which in turn is regulated by [[renin]]). Aldosterone is secreted in response to high [[extracellular]] [[potassium]] levels, low extracellular [[sodium]] levels, and low fluid levels and blood volume. Aldosterone affects [[metabolism]] in different ways:
*It increases [[urine|urinary]] excretion of potassium [[ions]]
*It increases interstitial levels of sodium ions
*It increases water retention and blood volume

===Glucocorticoids===
{{Main|Glucocorticoids}}
They are produced in the [[zona fasciculata]]. The primary glucocorticoid released by the adrenal gland in the human is [[cortisol]] and [[corticosterone]] in many other animals. Its secretion is regulated by the hormone [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] from the [[anterior pituitary]]. Upon binding to its target, cortisol enhances [[metabolism]] in several ways:
*It stimulates the release of [[amino acid]]s from the body
*It stimulates [[lipolysis]], the breakdown of [[fat]]
*It stimulates [[gluconeogenesis]], the production of [[glucose]] from newly-released amino acids and [[lipid]]s
*It increases blood glucose levels in response to stress, by inhibiting glucose uptake into [[muscle cells|muscle]] and [[adipose tissue|fat cells]]
*It strengthens [[cardiac muscle]] contractions
*It increases water retention
*It has anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects

===Androgens===
{{Main|Androgens}}
They are produced in the [[zona reticularis]]. The most important androgens include:
*[[Testosterone]]: a hormone with a wide variety of effects, ranging from enhancing muscle mass and stimulation of [[cell growth]] to the development of the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s.
*[[Dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT): a [[metabolism|metabolite]] of testosterone, and a more potent androgen than testosterone in that it binds more strongly to androgen receptors.
*[[Androstenedione]] (Andro): an androgenic steroid produced by the [[testes]], adrenal cortex, and [[ovaries]]. While [[androstenedione]]s are converted metabolically to testosterone and other [[androgen]]s, they are also the parent structure of [[estrone]].
*[[Dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA): It is the primary precursor of natural [[estrogen]]s. DHEA is also called [[dehydroisoandrosterone]] or [[dehydroandrosterone]].  The reticularis also produces [[Dehydroepiandrosterone_sulfate|DHEA-sulfate]] due to the actions of a [[sulfotransferase]], [[SULT2A1]].<ref name="pmid17945481">{{cite journal | author = Rainey WE, Nakamura Y | title = Regulation of the adrenal androgen biosynthesis | journal = J.
