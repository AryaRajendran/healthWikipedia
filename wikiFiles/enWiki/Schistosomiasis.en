'''Schistosomiasis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ʃ|i|s|t|ə|ˈ|s|ɵ|m|aɪ|ə|s|ə|s}} (also known as '''bilharzia''', '''bilharziosis''' or '''snail fever''') is a collective name of [[parasitic disease]]s caused by several species of [[Trematoda|trematodes]] belonging to the [[genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Schistosoma]]''. [[Snail]]s serve as the intermediary agent between mammalian [[Host (biology)|host]]s. Individuals within developing countries who cannot afford proper water and [[sanitation]] facilities are often exposed to contaminated water containing the infected snails.<ref name="CIA - The World Factbook">"CIA - The World Factbook." Central Intelligence Agency, 4 Apr. 2007 {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#2193 | title=cia.gov}}</ref>

Although it has a low [[mortality rate]], schistosomiasis often is a [[chronic illness]] that can damage internal organs and, in children, impair growth and [[cognitive development]]. The [[urinary]] form of schistosomiasis is associated with increased risks for [[bladder cancer]] in adults. Schistosomiasis is the second most socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease after [[malaria]].<ref name="SCP"/> 

This disease is most commonly found in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[South America]], especially in areas where the water contains numerous [[freshwater snail]]s, which may carry the parasite. 

The disease affects many people in developing countries, particularly children who may acquire the disease by swimming or playing in infected water.<ref name="SCP">{{Cite web | author= The Carter Center| title=Schistosomiasis Control Program|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/schistosomiasis/index.html|accessdate=2008-07-17 | postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref>  When children come into contact with a contaminated water source, the parasitic [[larva]]e easily enter through their skin and further mature within organ tissues. As of 2009, 74 developing countries statistically identified epidemics of Schistosomiasis within their respective populations.<ref name="CIA - The World Factbook"/>

==Classification==
Species of ''Schistosoma'' that can infect humans:

* ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'' ([[ICD|ICD-10]] B65.1) and ''[[Schistosoma intercalatum]]'' (B65.8) cause [[intestinal]] schistosomiasis
* ''[[Schistosoma haematobium]]'' (B65.0) causes [[urine|urinary]] schistosomiasis
* ''[[Schistosoma japonicum]]'' (B65.2) and ''[[Schistosoma mekongi]]'' (B65.8) cause [[Asia]]n intestinal schistosomiasis
Avian schistosomiasis species cause [[swimmer's itch]] and [[clam digger itch]]

Species of ''Schistosoma'' that can infect other animals: 

''S. bovis'' — normally infects cattle, sheep and goats in Africa, parts of Southern Europe and the Middle East<br /> 
''S. mattheei'' — normally infects cattle, sheep and goats in Central and Southern Africa<br />
''S. margrebowiei'' — normally infects antelope, buffalo and waterbuck in Southern and Central Africa<br />
''S. curassoni'' — normally infects domestic ruminants in West Africa<br />
''S. rodhaini'' — normally infects rodents and carnivores in parts of Central Africa

==Signs and symptoms==
Above all, schistosomiasis is a [[chronic disease]]. Many infections are subclinically symptomatic, with mild [[anemia]] and [[malnutrition]] being common in endemic areas. Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama's fever) may occur weeks after the initial infection, especially by ''S.&nbsp;mansoni'' and ''S.&nbsp;japonicum''. Manifestations include:

* [[Abdominal pain]]
* [[Cough]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Eosinophilia]] — extremely high [[eosinophil granulocyte]] (white blood cell) count.
* [[Fever]]
* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]
* [[Hepatosplenomegaly]] — the enlargement of both the [[liver]] and the [[spleen]]. Hepatic schistosomiasis is the second most common cause of [[esophageal varices]]<ref>p.771 Robbin and Cotran Pathological Basis of Disease 8th</ref> worldwide.
* [[Genital sore]]s — lesions that increase vulnerability to [[HIV]] infection. Lesions caused by schistosomiasis may continue to be a problem after control of the schistosomiasis infection itself. Early treatment, especially of children, which is relatively inexpensive, prevents formation of the sores.<ref>{{cite news |author=Donald G.

Occasionally [[central nervous system]] lesions occur: [[cerebral granulomatous disease]] may be caused by ectopic ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'' eggs in the [[brain]], and granulomatous lesions around ectopic eggs in the [[spinal cord]] from ''S.&nbsp;mansoni'' and ''S.&nbsp;haematobium'' infections may result in a [[transverse myelitis]] with flaccid [[paraplegia]].<ref>FREITAS, André Ricardo Ribas; OLIVEIRA, Augusto César Penalva  and  SILVA, Luiz Jacintho.

Continuing infection may cause granulomatous reactions and [[fibrosis]] in the affected organs, which may result in manifestations that include:

* Colonic [[polyposis]] with bloody diarrhea (''Schistosoma mansoni'' mostly);
* [[Portal hypertension]] with [[hematemesis]] and [[splenomegaly]] (''S.&nbsp;mansoni'', ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'');
* [[Cystitis]] and [[ureteritis]] (''S.&nbsp;haematobium'') with [[hematuria]], which can progress to [[bladder cancer]];
* [[Pulmonary hypertension]] (''S.&nbsp;mansoni'', ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'', more rarely ''S.&nbsp;haematobium'');
* [[Glomerulonephritis]]; and [[central nervous system lesions]].

[[Bladder cancer]] diagnosis and mortality are generally elevated in affected areas.

==Pathophysiology==

===Life cycle===
[[File:Schistosomiasis Life Cycle.png|thumb|''Schistosoma'' life cycle. Source: CDC]]

Schistosomes have a typical [[trematode]] vertebrate-invertebrate [[Trematode lifecycle stages|lifecycle]], with humans being the definitive host.

====Snails====
The life cycles of all five human schistosomes are broadly similar: parasite eggs are released into the environment from infected individuals, hatching on contact with fresh water to release the free-swimming [[miracidium]]. Miracidia infect [[freshwater snail]]s by penetrating the snail's foot. After infection, close to the site of penetration, the miracidium transforms into a primary (mother) sporocyst. Germ cells within the primary sporocyst will then begin dividing to produce secondary (daughter) sporocysts, which migrate to the snail's [[hepatopancreas]]. Once at the hepatopancreas, germ cells within the secondary sporocyst begin to divide again, this time producing thousands of new parasites, known as [[cercariae]], which are the larvae capable of infecting mammals. 

Cercariae emerge daily from the snail host in a [[circadian]] rhythm, dependent on ambient temperature and light. Young cercariae are highly mobile, alternating between vigorous upward movement and sinking to maintain their position in the water. Cercarial activity is particularly stimulated by water turbulence, by shadows and by chemicals found on human skin.

====Humans====
Penetration of the human skin occurs after the cercaria have attached to and explored the skin. The parasite secretes enzymes that break down the skin's protein to enable penetration of the cercarial head through the skin. As the cercaria penetrates the skin it transforms into a migrating [[schistosomulum]] stage.
[[Image:Schistosoma bladder histopathology.jpeg|thumb|right|Photomicrography of bladder in ''S.&nbsp;hematobium'' infection, showing clusters of the parasite eggs with intense eosinophilia, Source: CDC]]

The newly transformed schistosomulum may remain in the skin for two days before locating a post-capillary [[venule]]; from here the schistosomulum travels to the [[lung]]s where it undergoes further developmental changes necessary for subsequent migration to the [[liver]]. Eight to ten days after penetration of the skin, the parasite migrates to the [[liver sinusoid]]s. ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'' migrates more quickly than ''S. mansoni'', and usually reaches the liver within eight days of penetration. Juvenile ''S.&nbsp;mansoni'' and ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'' worms develop an oral sucker after arriving at the liver, and it is during this period that the parasite begins to feed on [[red blood cell]]s. The nearly-mature worms pair, with the longer female worm residing in the [[gynaecophoric channel]] of the shorter male. Adult worms are about 10&nbsp;mm long. Worm pairs of ''S.&nbsp;mansoni'' and ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'' relocate to the [[mesenteric]] or rectal veins. ''S.&nbsp;haematobium'' schistosomula ultimately migrate from the liver to the perivesical venous plexus of the bladder, ureters, and [[kidney]]s through the hemorrhoidal plexus.

Parasites reach maturity in six to eight weeks, at which time they begin to produce eggs. Adult ''S.&nbsp;mansoni'' pairs residing in the mesenteric vessels may produce up to 300&nbsp;eggs per day during their reproductive lives. ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'' may produce up to 3,000 eggs per day. Many of the eggs pass through the walls of the blood vessels, and through the intestinal wall, to be passed out of the body in feces. ''S.&nbsp;haematobium'' eggs pass through the ureteral or bladder wall and into the urine. Only mature eggs are capable of crossing into the digestive tract, possibly through the release of [[proteolytic]] enzymes, but also as a function of host immune response, which fosters local tissue ulceration. Up to half the eggs released by the worm pairs become trapped in the mesenteric veins, or will be washed back into the liver, where they will become lodged. Worm pairs can live in the body for an average of four and a half years, but may persist up to twenty years.

Trapped eggs mature normally, secreting [[antigens]] that elicit a vigorous [[immune]] response. The eggs themselves do not damage the body. Rather it is the cellular infiltration resultant from the immune response that causes the pathology classically associated with schistosomiasis.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Schistosome20043-300.jpg|thumb|right|High powered detailed micrograph of ''Schistosoma'' parasite eggs in human bladder tissue.]]
[[Image:Schistosoma japonicum (3) histopathology.JPG|thumb| ''S. japonicum'' eggs in hepatic portal tract.]]
Contemporary diagnosis involves detection of parasitic antigens by [[ELISA]]; all that is required from the patient is a blood sample.  This screening method is highly effective. Microscopic identification of eggs in [[feces|stool]] or, less commonly, the [[urine]] is another way of arriving at a positive diagnosis.  For the measurement of eggs in the feces of presenting patients the scientific unit used is [[eggs per gram]] (epg). Stool examination should be performed when infection with ''S.&nbsp;mansoni'' or ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'' is suspected, and urine examination should be performed if ''S.&nbsp;haematobium'' is suspected.

Eggs can be present in the stool in infections with all ''Schistosoma'' species. The examination can be performed on a simple smear (1 to 2&nbsp;mg of fecal material). Since eggs may be passed intermittently or in small amounts, their detection will be enhanced by repeated examinations and/or concentration procedures (such as the formalin-ethyl acetate technique). In addition, for field surveys and investigational purposes, the egg output can be quantified by using the [[Kato-Katz technique]] (20 to 50&nbsp;mg of fecal material) or the Ritchie technique.

Eggs can be found in the urine in infections with ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'' and with ''S.&nbsp;intercalatum'' (recommended time for collection: between noon and 3&nbsp;p.m.) Detection will be enhanced by [[centrifugation]] and examination of the sediment. Quantification is possible by using filtration through a [[nucleopore]] membrane of a standard volume of urine followed by egg counts on the membrane. Investigation of ''S.&nbsp;haematobium'' should also include a pelvic x-ray as bladder wall [[Calcification|calcificaition]] is highly characteristic of chronic infection.

Recently a field evaluation of a novel handheld microscope was undertaken in [[Uganda]] for the diagnosis of intestinal schistosomiasis by a team led by Dr. Russell Stothard from the Natural History Museum of London, working with the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, London.<ref name = "Stothard">{{Cite journal

Tissue [[biopsy]] (rectal biopsy for all species and biopsy of the bladder for ''S.&nbsp;haematobium'') may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative.

The eggs of ''S. haematobium'' are ellipsoidal with a terminal spine, ''S.&nbsp;mansoni'' eggs are also ellipsoidal but with a lateral spine, ''S.&nbsp;japonicum'' eggs are spheroidal with a small knob.

[[Antibody]] detection can be useful in both clinical management and for [[epidemiologic]] surveys.

==Prevention==

===Eliminating or avoiding the snails===
Prevention is best accomplished by eliminating the water-dwelling snails that are the [[natural reservoir]] of the disease. [[Acrolein]], [[copper sulfate]], and [[niclosamide]] can be used for this purpose. Recent studies have suggested that snail populations can be controlled by the introduction of, or augmentation of existing, [[crayfish]] populations. 

In 1989, [[Aklilu Lemma]] and [[Legesse Wolde-Yohannes]] received the [[Right Livelihood Award]] for their research on the [[sapindus|sarcoca]] plant, as a preventive measure for the disease by controlling the snail. Concurrently, Dr.&nbsp;Chidzere of Zimbabwe researched the similar [[Sarcoca dodecandra|gopo berry]] during the 1980s and found that it could be used in the control of infected freshwater snails. In 1989 he drew attention to his concerns that big chemical companies denigrated the gopo berry alternative for snail control.<ref>The Gopu Berry p33. Part 4 School Journal number.2 1989 Dept of Education Wellington N.Z.</ref> Gopo berries from hotter Ethiopia climates reputedly yield the best results.

For many years from the 1950s onwards, civil engineers built vast dam and irrigation schemes, oblivious to the fact that they would cause a massive rise in water-borne infections from schistosomiasis. The detailed specifications laid out in various UN documents since the 1950s could have minimized this problem. Irrigation schemes can be designed to make it hard for the snails to colonize the water, and to reduce the contact with the local population.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Charnock, Anne |title=Taking Bilharziasis out of the irrigation equation |journal=New Civil Engineer |date=7 August 1980 |quote=Bilharzia caused by poor civil engineering design due to ignorance of cause and prevention}}</ref>

This has been cited as a classic case of the [[relevance paradox]] because guidelines on how to design these schemes to minimise the spread of the disease had been published years before, but the designers were unaware of them.<ref>{{cite book |title=The IRG Solution — hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it |publisher=Souvenir Press |location=London |year=1984 |page=88 }}</ref>

The World Health Organization has developed guidelines for community treatment of schistosomiasis based on the impact the disease has on children in endemic villages:<ref name="STreat"/> 
*When a village reports more than 50 percent of children have blood in their urine, everyone in the village receives treatment.<ref name="STreat"/>
*When 20 to 50 percent of children have bloody urine, only school-age children are treated.<ref name="STreat"/>
*When less than 20 percent of children have symptoms, mass treatment is not implemented.<ref name="STreat"/>
The [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] has recently funded an operational research program---the [http://www.ctegd.uga.edu/score.php Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE)] to answer strategic questions about how to move forward with schistosomiasis control and elimination. The focus of SCORE is on development of tools and evaluation of strategies for use in mass drug administration campaigns.

[[Antimony]] has been used in the past to treat the disease. In low doses, this [[toxic]] [[metalloid]] bonds to [[sulfur]] atoms in [[enzymes]] used by the parasite and kills it without harming the host. This treatment is not referred to in present-day [[peer-review]] scholarship; praziquantel is universally used. Outside of the U.S., there is a drug available exclusively for treating ''Schistosoma mansoni'' ([[oxamniquine]]) and one exclusively for treating ''S.hematobium'' ([[metrifonate]]). While metrifonate has been discontinued for use by the British [[National Health Service]], a Cochrane review found it equally effective in treating urinary schistosomiasis as the leading drug, praziquantel.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Danso-Appiah A, Utzinger J, Liu J, Olliaro P |title=Drugs for treating urinary schistosomiasis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD000053 |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000053.pub2 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000053/frame.html |editor1-last=Danso-Appiah |editor1-first=Anthony}}</ref>

Among human parasitic diseases, schistosomiasis (sometimes called bilharziasis) ranks second behind [[malaria]] in terms of socio-economic and public health importance in tropical and subtropical areas.

In some cases, urbanization, pollution, and/or consequent destruction of snail habitat has reduced exposure, with a subsequent decrease in new infections. The most common way of getting schistosomiasis in developing countries is by wading or swimming in lakes, ponds and other bodies of water that are infested with the [[snail]]s (usually of the genera ''[[Biomphalaria]]'', ''[[Bulinus]]'', or ''[[Oncomelania]]'') that are the [[natural reservoir]]s of the ''Schistosoma'' pathogen.

==History==
Schistosomiasis is known as bilharzia or bilharziosis in many countries, after German physician [[Theodor Bilharz]], who first described the cause of urinary schistosomiasis in 1851. 

The first doctor who described the entire disease cycle was [[Pirajá da Silva]] in 1908.

It was a common cause of death for [[Ancient Egypt]]ians in the Greco-Roman Period.<ref>[http://www.ucalgary.ca/uofc/Others/HOM/Proceedings-2004.pdf#page=13 "Proceedings of the 13h Annual History of Medicine Days"], a medical historical paper from University of Calgary. March 2004.</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Egypt treatment campaign and Hepatitis C===
Schistosomiasis is [[Endemism|endemic]] in [[Egypt]], exacerbated by the country's dam and irrigation projects along the [[Nile]]. From the late 1950s through the early 1980s, infected villagers were treated with repeated shots of [[tartar emetic]]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that this campaign unintentionally contributed to the spread of the [[hepatitis C virus]] via unclean needles. Egypt has the world's highest hepatitis C infection rate, and the infection rates in various regions of the country closely track the timing and intensity of the anti-schistosomiasis campaign.<ref name="pmid16628669">{{cite journal |author=Strickland GT |title=Liver disease in Egypt: hepatitis C superseded schistosomiasis as a result of iatrogenic and biological factors |journal=Hepatology |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=915–22 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16628669 |doi=10.1002/hep.21173 |url=}}</ref>
