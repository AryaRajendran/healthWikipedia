== Life ==
Küchenmeister studied medicine in [[Leipzig]] and [[Prague]], and in 1846 became a general practitioner in [[Zittau]]. In 1847 he married, and in 1856 he moved to Dresden. He conducted research on tapeworms, [[trichinosis]], and other parasites and wrote about it several works. He was also publisher of the ''Allgemeine Zeitschrift für Epidemiologie'' (General Journal of Epidemiology). In 1852, his theory that [[bladder-worm]]s are juvenile [[tapeworms]] gained the attention of the medical profession.<ref>http://www.physiologus.de/finnen.htm</ref><ref>http://www.slaek.de/50aebl/2008/archiv/05/pdf/0508_222.pdf</ref> In the later 1850s, he carried out an experiment demonstrating this by feeding pork containing [[cysticerci]] of ''[[Taenia solium]]'' to prisoners awaiting execution, and after they had been executed, he recovered the developing and adult tapeworms in their intestines.<ref>Wadia, NH, Singh, G. “Taenia Solium: A Historical Note” Taenia Solium Cysticercosis: From Basic to Clinical Science  CABI Publishing, 2002. 157–168.

Küchenmeister was an advocate of [[cremation]], as he saw the risk of [[soil contamination]] in the [[putrefaction]] and [[decomposition]] products that occur after [[burial]].<ref>http://www.n-fischer.de/feuer_6.html</ref> In Dresden, he founded the group The Urn: Association for Facultative Cremation. In 1876, he took part in the first European Congress of the Friends of Cremation, also in Dresden.<ref>http://www.dresdner-stadtteile.de/Ost/Tolkewitz/Johannisfriedhof/johannisfriedhof.html</ref>
