The '''orbital septum''' ('''palpebral ligament''') is a [[membranous]] sheet that acts as the anterior boundary of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]. It extends from the orbital rims to the [[eyelid]]s. It forms the fibrous portion of the eyelids.<ref name="MafeeValvassori2004">{{cite book|author1=Mahmood F. Mafee|author2=Galdino E.

==Anatomy==
In the upper eyelid it blends with the tendon of the [[Levator palpebrae superioris]], and in the lower eyelid with the [[Tarsus (eyelids)|tarsal plate]].<ref>Meyer DR, Linberg JV, Wobig JL, et al.: Anatomy of the orbital septum and associated eyelid connective tissues. Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg 7:104, 1991</ref>

When the eyes are closed, the whole orbital opening is covered by the septum and tarsi.  Medially it is thin, and, becoming separated from the [[medial palpebral ligament]], attaches to the lacrimal bone at its [[posterior lacrimal crest|posterior crest]].  The medial ligament and its much weaker lateral counterpart, attached to the septum and orbit, keep the lids stable as the eye moves.<ref>"eye, human."Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 2008"</ref>

The septum is perforated by the vessels and nerves which pass from the orbital cavity to the [[face]] and [[scalp]].

==Clinical significance==
With age the septum may weaken, and as a result orbital fat may herniate forwards. The operation to correct this is called [[blepharoplasty]].

The orbital septum is an important landmark in distinguishing between [[orbital cellulitis]] (inside the septum) and [[periorbital cellulitis]] (outside the septum).<ref name="urlCellulitis, Orbital: eMedicine Ophthalmology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1217858-overview |title=Cellulitis, Orbital: eMedicine Ophthalmology |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-06-16}}</ref>
