'''Penile subincision''' is a form of [[body modification]] consisting of a [[urethrotomy]], in which the underside of the [[penis]] is incised and the [[urethra]] slit open lengthwise, from the urethral opening ([[urinary meatus|meatus]]) toward the base. The slit can be of varying lengths.

Subincision is traditionally performed around the world, notably in [[Australia]], but also in [[Africa]], [[South America]] and the [[Polynesia]]n and [[Melanesia]]n cultures of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], often as a [[coming of age]] ritual. The practice has been taken up in the [[western world]] in recent years for the purpose of sexual pleasure or aesthetics.

Disadvantages include the risk of surgery, which is often [[self-surgery|self-performed]], and increased susceptibility to [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted infections (STIs)]]. The ability to impregnate (specifically, getting [[Semen|sperm]] into the [[vagina]]) may also be decreased.

Subincisions can greatly affect [[urination]] and often require the subincised male to sit or squat while urinating. The scrotum can be pulled up against the open urethra to quasi-complete the tube and allow an approximation to normal urination, while a few subincised men carry a tube with which they can aim. 

==Cultural traditions==
Subincision (like [[circumcision]]) is widespread{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australians]], and is well documented{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} among the peoples of the [[Central Australia|central desert]] such as the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] and [[Luritja]]. The Arrernte word for subincision is ''arilta'', and occurs as a [[rite of passage]] ritual for adolescent boys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It was gifted to the Arrernte by [[Mangar-kunjer-kunja]], a lizard-man spirit being from the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]]. A subincised penis is thought to resemble a [[vulva]], and the bleeding is likened to [[menstruation]].<ref>Myerhoff 1982: 122</ref> 
This type of modification of the penis was also traditionally performed by the [[Lardil]] people of [[Mornington Island]], [[Queensland]]. The young men who chose to endure this custom were the only ones to learn a simple ceremonial language, [[Damin]]. In later ceremonies, repeated throughout adult life, the subincised penis would be used as a site for ritual bloodletting. According to [[Kenneth L. Hale|Ken Hale]], who studied Damin, no ritual initiations have been carried out in the Gulf of Carpentaria for half a century, and hence the language has also died out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rickharrison.com/language/damin.html |accessdate=2008-08-16 |title=Damin |author=Ken Hale |authorlink=Kenneth L. Hale}}</ref>

Another indigenous Australian term for the custom is ''mika''.<ref>{{cite book|author = Andrew Arthur Abbie |authorlink=Andrew Arthur Abbie |title = The Original Australians |publisher = Muller |date =1969 |location =London |page = 147 |url = http://books.google.com/books?ei=kVkAUODOJaOO2wWnxa2fBA&sqi=2&id=c_5yAAAAMAAJ&dq=Australia+subincision+mika&q=mika#search_anchor |oclc = 640051856}}</ref>

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures of the [[Amazon Basin]] also practise subincision, as do [[Samburu people|Samburu]] herdboys of [[Kenya]], who are said to perform subincisions on themselves (or sometimes their peers) at age seven to ten. In [[Samoa]], subincision of the foreskin, skin located along the tip of the penis, was ritually performed upon young men, as in [[Hawaii]], where subincision of the foreskin is reported to have been performed at age six or seven.
