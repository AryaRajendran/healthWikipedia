==Mission and Approach==
Founded in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, International Medical Corps is a private, voluntary, nonpolitical, nonsectarian organization that works to improve the quality of life through health interventions and related activities that build local capacity in under served communities worldwide.

International Medical Corps provides life-saving relief while building self-reliance through programs that focus on education and training.  As a result of this approach, approximately 96% of its field-based staff and health professionals are recruited from the local community, helping ensure that the skills stay within the area long after the program has ended.<ref name="Our Approach">{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalmedicalcorps.org/Page.aspx?pid=393 |title=Our Approach |publisher=International Medical Corps |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref>

The emphasis on capacity building through education and training is central to all International Medical Corps programs.  Its central program priorities include: emergency response; health capacity building; women’s and children’s health and wellbeing; mental health; and clean water, sanitation, and hygiene.<ref name="Our Approach"/>  In addition to these priorities, International Medical Corps also runs programs providing nutrition services, economic and agricultural livelihoods support, and prevention, testing, and care for communicable diseases like [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].

==History==
International Medical Corps was founded by Dr. Robert Simon, a young emergency-room physician at UCLA Medical Center, who was moved to take action after learning about the plight of the Afghan people as a result of the 1979 Soviet invasion and subsequent occupation. All but 200 of the country’s 1,500 doctors had been executed, imprisoned, or exiled, and relief agencies had been ordered out of the country, worsening the shortage of doctors, although [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] had been in Afghanistan since 1980.<ref>[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.com/news/country.cfm?id=2269 MSF in Afghanistan] Médecins Sans Frontières web site.</ref>

Simon began making trips to Afghanistan to provide medical assistance directly to civilians, eventually selling his Malibu home to finance a clinic in the battered Kunar River Valley. Eventually, understanding that a few new clinics would not meet the overwhelming health care needs of Afghans, Simon set up a full-time Afghan medical training center in the nearby – and relative security of - the Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan.

At the end of one nine-month course, the Afghan medics trained by International Medical Corps were able to diagnose and treat 75-80 percent of the injuries and illnesses they encountered in the field. By 1990, International Medical Corps had graduated more than 200 medics who helped established 57 clinics and 10 hospitals in 18 provinces throughout rural Afghanistan.<ref name="From Relief to Self-Reliance"/>

==Current operations==
Today, International Medical works in more than 25 countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, providing relief to populations facing war, conflict, natural disaster, famine, and poverty while also laying the foundation for sustainable development.  Its programs are funded from both public and private sources, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, The European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO), The United Nations, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and AmeriCares.<ref name="internationalmedicalcorps1">http://content.internationalmedicalcorps.org/pdfs/IMC_2008_Annual_Report.pdf</ref>  In 2008, International Medical Corps received $94.7 million in support from grants, contributions, and donated medical supplies and services.<ref name="internationalmedicalcorps1"/>
