A '''speculum''' (Latin for "mirror"; plural '''specula''' or speculums) is a medical tool for investigating body cavities, with a form dependent on the body cavity for which it is designed.  In old texts, the speculum may also be referred to as a '''diopter''' or '''dioptra'''.<ref>''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 1971 - see entry for ''diopter''</ref> Like an [[endoscope]], a speculum allows entry into a body cavity; endoscopes, however, tend to have [[optics]] while a speculum is intended for direct vision.

==History==
Vaginal and anal specula were used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/roman_surgical/ |author=Univ. of Virginia |title=Surgical Instruments from Ancient Rome  (with pictures) |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>  and speculum [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been found in [[Pompeii]].<ref>{{cite book|title = History of Medicine|author = [[Cecilia Mettler]]|publisher = The Blakiston Co (1947)}}</ref> A vaginal speculum, developed by [[J. Marion Sims]], consists of a hollow cylinder with a rounded end that is divided into two hinged parts, somewhat like the [[beak]] of a duck. The speculum is inserted into the vagina to dilate it for examination of the [[vagina]] and [[cervix]].

==Construction==
All{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} specula were formerly made of [[stainless steel]], and sterilized after use. However, many, especially those used in emergency departments and doctor's offices, are now made of plastic, and are sterile, disposable, single-use items.  Those used in surgical suites are still commonly made of metal.

==Types of specula==

Specula come in a variety of shapes based on their purpose, in any case the cylinder or blade(s) of the instrument allow the operator a direct vision of the area of interest and the possibility to introduce instruments for further interventions such as a biopsy.

===Vaginal use===

The best-known speculum is the bivalved vaginal specula; the two blades are hinged and are "closed" when the speculum is inserted to facilitate its entry and "opened" in its final position where they can be arrested by a screw mechanism, so that the operator is freed from keeping the blades apart. 

A cylindrical-shaped speculum, introduced in 2001, the dilating vaginal speculum (also known as the Veda-scope<ref>Longmore Peter G "Veda-scope: More comfortable than the bivalve speculum and cytologically equivalent" ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology'' 2004; 44: 140-145</ref>) invented by Clemens van der Weegen,<ref>http://www.google.com/patents?id=fvgQAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> inflates the vagina with filtered air.<ref>Thomas A et al "A randomised controlled trial comparing a dilating vaginal speculum with a conventional bivalve speculum" ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology'' 2001;41:4:379</ref> (see diagram) The device has two main functions: a) to take a normal Pap smear with a cervical brush or a cytology brush; and b) as an internal [[colposcope]] so that the operator can pivot the Veda-scope to view any part of the vagina barrel and cervix facilitated by an internal light source that can illuminate the vaginal wall and cervix with multi-coloured light filters, which can detect pre-cancerous cells with the aid of [[acetic acid]] solution and [[iodine]] solution. It also has a facility to attach a digital camera for viewing and recording.<ref>http://pacificei.com/how_work.html</ref>[[File:Dilating vaginal speculum inflating vagina and light illuminating.jpg|right|thumb|Dilating vaginal speculum inflating vagina and light illuminating (cervical brush inserts through top inlet)]]

A specialized  form of vaginal speculum is the weighted speculum, which consists of a broad half tube which is bent at about a 90 degree angle, with the channel of the tube on the exterior side of the angle.  One end of the tube has a roughly spherical metal weight surrounding the channel of the speculum.  A weighted speculum is placed in the vagina during vaginal [[surgery]] with the patient in the [[lithotomy position]].  The weight holds the speculum in place and frees the surgeon's hands for other tasks.
A vaginal speculum is also used in fertility treatments, particularly artificial insemination, and allows the vaginal cavity to be opened and observed thereby facilitating the deposit of semen into the vagina.

===Rectal use===
Vaginal specula are also used for [[anus|anal]] surgery, although several other forms of anal specula exist.  One form, the [[Anoscopy|anoscope]], resembles a tube that has a removable [[bullet]]-shaped insert.  When the anoscope is inserted into the anus, the insert dilates the anus to the diameter of the tube.  The insert is then removed, leaving the tube to allow examination of the lower rectum and anus.  

This style of anal speculum is one of the oldest designs for surgical instruments still in use, with examples dating back many centuries. The [[sigmoidoscope]] can be further advanced into the lower intestinal tract and requires an endoscopic set-up.

===Nasal use===
[[human nose|Nasal]] specula have two relatively flat blades with handle.  The instrument is hinged so that when the handles are squeezed together the blades spread laterally, allowing examination.

[[Ear]] or aural specula resemble a [[funnel]], and come in a variety of sizes.

===Oral use===
In veterinary medicine, a McPherson Speculum can be used for oral examination. The speculum helps keep the mouth open during the exam and helps avoid biting injuries.

==Non-medical uses==
Some health centers and feminist organizations sell plain specula, to allow women to better understand their body and improve how they view their vulva and vagina
