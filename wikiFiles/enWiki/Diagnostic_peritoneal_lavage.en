'''Diagnostic peritoneal lavage''' ('''DPL''') or '''diagnostic peritoneal aspiration''' ('''DPA''') is a surgical diagnostic procedure to determine if there is free floating fluid (most often blood) in the [[abdominal cavity]].

==Indications==
This procedure is performed when intra-abdominal bleeding ([[hemoperitoneum]]), usually secondary to trauma, is suspected.<ref>Rosen 2009, p. 422-4</ref> In a hemodynamically  unstable patient with high-risk mechanism of injury, peritoneal lavage is a means of rapidly diagnosing intra-abdominal injury requiring laparotomy, but has largely been replaced in trauma care by the use of a [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma]] (FAST scan) due to its repeatability, non-invasiveness and non-interference with subsequent [[computed tomography]] (CT scan). Abdominal CT and contrast [[duodenography]] may complement lavage in stable patients, but in an unstable or uncooperative persons, these studies are too time-consuming or require ill-advised sedation. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] is extremely accurate for the anatomic definition of structural injury, but logistics limit its practical application in acute abdominal trauma.<ref>{{cite book|author = Tintinalli JE, Kelen GD, Stapczynski JS| title = Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, ed 6 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2004 | pages = 1615–1616}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author = Townsed CM Jr, Beauchamp RD, Evers BM, et al  | title = Sabiston Textbook of Surgery: The Bilogical Basis of Modern Surgical Practice, ed 18 | publisher = Saunders | year = 2008 | pages = 502–504}}</ref>
The procedure was first described in 1965 by Hauser Root.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/82888-overview | title=Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage | publisher=Medscape | date=June 18, 2012 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Jagminas, Liudvikas}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Root H, Hauser C, McKinley C, Lafave J, Mendiola R | title = Diagnostic peritoneal lavage. | journal = Surgery | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 633–7 | year = 1965 | pmid = 14295771}}</ref>

==Procedure==
After the application of [[local anesthesia]], a vertical skin incision is made one third of the distance from the [[Navel|umbilicus]] to the [[pubic symphysis]].  The [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] is divided and the [[peritoneum]] entered after it has been picked up to prevent bowel perforation. A catheter is inserted towards the pelvis and aspiration of material attempted using a syringe. If no blood is aspirated, 1 litre of warm 0.9% saline is infused and after a few (usually 5) minutes this is drained and sent for analysis.<ref>{{cite video | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9BZamRlXVA | title=Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL) | publisher="The Division of Trauma/Surgical Critical Care/Burns is part of the Department of Surgery, UC San Diego Health System | date=July 17, 2012 | people=Kim, Dennis(Narrator) | location=San Diego | time=4:00}}</ref>

==Interpretation of results==
If any of the following are found then the DPL is positive of trauma and operative exploration is warranted:<ref name="manual">{{cite book |author=Andrew B., MD Peitzman; Andrew B.
