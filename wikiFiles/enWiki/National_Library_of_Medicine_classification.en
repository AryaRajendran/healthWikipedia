The '''National Library of Medicine (NLM) classification system''' is a [[Library classification|library indexing system]] covering the fields of [[medicine]] and preclinical basic sciences. The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] classification is patterned after the [[Library of Congress classification|Library of Congress (LC) Classification system]]: [[Alphabet|alphabetical letters ]]  denote broad subject categories which are subdivided by numbers.<ref name=NLM_Factsheet>{{cite web | title =Fact Sheet: NLM Classification | work = | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/nlmclassif.html | date = 2005-07-15 | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> For example, ''QW 279'' would indicate a book on an aspect of [[microbiology]] or [[immunology]].

The one- or two-letter alphabetical codes in the NLM classification use a limited range of letters: only QS–QZ and W–WZ. This allows the NLM system to co-exist with the larger LC coding scheme as neither of these ranges are used in the LC system. There are, however, three pre-existing codes in the LC system which overlap with the NLM: ''Human Anatomy'' (QM), ''Microbiology'' (QR), and ''Medicine'' (R). To avoid further confusion, these three codes are not used in the NLM.

The headings for the individual ''schedules'' (letters or letter pairs) are given in brief form (e.g., QW - ''Microbiology and Immunology''; WG - ''Cardiovascular System'') and together they provide an outline of the subjects covered by the NLM classification. Headings are interpreted broadly and include the [[Physiology|physiological]] system, the specialties connected with them, the regions of the body chiefly concerned and subordinate related fields. The NLM system is [[hierarchical]], and within each schedule, division by [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] usually has priority. Each main schedule, as well as some sub-sections, begins with a group of form numbers ranging generally from 1–49 which  classify materials by publication type, e.g., [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[atlas]]es, laboratory manuals, etc.

The main schedules QS-QZ, W-WY, and WZ (excluding the range WZ 220–270)  classify works published after 1913; the 19th century schedule is used for works published 1801-1913; and WZ 220-270 is used to provide century groupings for works published before 1801.
