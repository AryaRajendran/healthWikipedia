'''Melvin Starkey Henderson''' (1883â€“1954) was an American [[orthopedic surgeon]], who was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] (USA).

==Biography==
Upon his mother's death, he went to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] to live with relatives, the family of Eliza Starkey and Edward Drewry and owner of the [[Drewry Brewery]].  There he received the generous financial support to continue his undergraduate college and medical degrees from the [[University of Toronto]]. He returned to the US and interned at the County Hospital in St. Paul, and in 1907 went to work in [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester, MN]] as a surgical assistant with the Mayo brothers practice, [[William James Mayo|William James]] and [[Charles Horace Mayo]]. He worked closely with Will Mayo, and in keeping with his preference and skill as a "bone surgeon", it was decided that the young Dr. Henderson would limit his practice to a precise specialty.  In 1911, Dr. Henderson went abroad to the UK, to work under Sir [[Robert Jones (surgeon)|Robert Jones]] in [[Liverpool]], England and then [[Sir Harold Stiles]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, both recognized as experts in the new field of specialized [[orthopaedic surgery]]. Upon his return to Rochester, he then proceeded to organize and head the new section of orthopaedic surgery at the [[Mayo Clinic]], until he retired in 1948.<ref>''Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research''; August 1990, Volume 257, Issue, pp.3-10, SECTION I: SYMPOSIUM CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION IN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY: The Classic: Fifty Years in the American Board of Orthopaedic  Surgery</ref><ref>''Spokane Daily Chronicle'', "Sister Kenny Foundation Helps with Rehabilitation" by Walter C. Alvarez Emeritus Professor of Medicine, Mayo Foundation April 2, 1973</ref>  He spent his medical career in Rochester, working closely with the Mayo brothers in the early years, contributing to The Mayo Clinic's growth into the major [[medical practice]] it has gone on to become, and witnessing the small city's expansion. 

During his tenure, he consulted and advised many associates.  Always a visionary, he accepted a meeting in 1940 with Sister [[Elizabeth Kenny]].  Although she was already denounced by many [[physician]]s and [[surgeon]]s, including the [[American Medical Association|AMA]] president, as an "ignorant [[Quackery|quack]] seeking money for her own gain", Dr. Henderson chose to make his own opinions.  Instead of dismissing her and her experience as just a untrained nurse of [[polio]] patients, Dr. Henderson referred her to an associate in [[Minneapolis]], MN.<ref>The Woman Who Challenged the Doctors; Victor Cohn,University of Minnesota Press, January 1, 1975</ref>  There, she was finally given a chance to demonstrate her work to doctors [[Miland Knapp]] and [[John Pohl]], who headed the polio treatment centers and told her that she should "stick around". However, Dr. Henderson's wife, Mabel, was also a strong personality of pioneer stock; a nurse called to training as a first graduate of [[St Mary's Nursing School]] which began following disastrous [[tornado]]es in the Rochester area, which may have contributed to Dr. Henderson's open mind.

Dr. Henderson operated on many famous [[sportsperson|athlete]]s, [[actor]]s, personalities from around the world, as well as, provided free [[surgery]] to patients as needed.  He kept precise research notes on his surgeries and outcomes, and published numerous articles for medical journals. He presented his work at many medical organizations, developed surgical techniques, and equipment. He is recognised for his research on [[synovial chondromatosis]], a disease affecting the thin flexible membrane around a joint called the [[synovium]]. The disorder is also known as Reichel's syndrome, Henderson-Jones syndrome, or Reichel-Jones-Henderson syndrome, named after Doctors [[Friedrich Paul Reichel]], Hugh Toland Jones and Melvin Starkey Henderson.<ref>

Dr. Henderson was involved in many national and international organizations, and was a founder and first President of the [[American Board of Orthopaedic Surgeons]], when it was established at the [[Kahler Hotel]] in Rochester, Minnesota, on June 5, 1934. Describing the organization of the board, the closed, socially elite Eastern establishment of surgeons, withheld endorsement, "After all, in the opinion of the East Coast establishment, Dr. Henderson (who was born in St. Paul, was educated in [[Canada]], and had his beginning with the Mayo brothers as a clinical assistant riding a bicycle around Rochester, making house calls on the Mayo brothers' patients) was a mere upstart." He was 31 years old and had already been President of the [[American Orthopaedic Association]] and [[Clinical Orthopaedic Society]], as well as prominent in the American Medical Association and other organizations. Dr. Henderson was one of three of the first 15 [[American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons|AAOS]] presidents (the other two being Drs. [[Philip D. Wilson]] and [[John C. Wilson, Sr.]]) who had a son who succeeded him professionally as both President and as the Director of Orthopaedic Surgery at the Mayo Clinic. He was greatly respected for his organizational abilities, particularly at the Board, whose objectives were uncertain in the beginning and required his careful quidance. Dr. Henderson served on the Trustee Board for the Mayo Clinic, and many other professional and charitable foundations.<ref>Journal of  Bone and Joint Surgery Am., Obituary, 1954; 36:1087-1088</ref><ref>Who's Who in Orthopaedic Surgery; Seyed Mostoffi, Springer; 1 edition (September 17, 2004).</ref>

Throughout his busy career, Dr. Henderson remained a gifted amateur [[photographer]].  Disappearing into his [[darkroom]] when he had the opportunity, he later entered his photographs to document his family, friendships, and professional associates into his [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]].  Also an early fan of the movie camera, beginning in the 1920s, he documented many activities in hundreds and hundreds of feet of old black-and-white 16mm movie reels of the Mayo family and fellow associates, his travels, and of his family, all in the possession of his family today.

Dr. Henderson died June 17, 1954 in Rochester, Minnesota, from [[cardiac disease]] when he was 71 years old.
