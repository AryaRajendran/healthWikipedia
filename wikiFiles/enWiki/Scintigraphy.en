'''Scintigraphy''' ("scint," Latin scintilla, spark) is a form of diagnostic test used in [[nuclear medicine]], wherein [[radioisotope]]s (here called ''radiopharmaceuticals'') are taken internally, and the emitted radiation is captured by external detectors ([[gamma camera]]s) to form two-dimensional<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/scintigraphy thefreedictionary.com > scintigraphy] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers, 2007 by Saunders; Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. 2007; McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine, 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies</ref> images. In contrast, [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] and ''[[positron emission tomography]]'' (PET) form 3-dimensional images, and are therefore classified as separate techniques to scintigraphy, although they also use [[gamma camera]]s to detect internal radiation. Scintigraphy is unlike a diagnostic [[X-ray]] where external radiation is passed through the body to form an image. 

==By organ or organ system==
===Biliary system (Cholescintigraphy)===
{{Main|Cholescintigraphy}}
Scintigraphy of the [[biliary system]] is called ''cholescintigraphy'' and is done to diagnose  obstruction of the [[bile ducts]] by a gallstone ([[cholelithiasis]]), a tumor, or another cause.<ref name=medterms>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9136 MedicineNet.com > Definition of Scintigraphy] Last Editorial Review: 12/6/2003</ref> It can also diagnose [[gallbladder diseases]], e.g. bile leaks of [[biliary fistula]]s.<ref name=medterms/> In cholescintigraphy, the injected radioactive chemical is taken up by the liver and secreted into the bile. The radiopharmaceutical then goes into the bile ducts, the gallbladder, and the intestines. The gamma camera is placed on the abdomen to picture these perfused organs.<ref name=medterms/> Other scintigraphic tests are done similarly.<ref name=medterms/>

===Lung scintigraphy===
[[File:Lung scintigraphy keosys.JPG|thumb|Lung scintigraphy evaluating lung cancer]]
The most common indication for lung scintigraphy is to diagnose [[pulmonary embolism]], e.g. with a [[ventilation/perfusion scan]]. Less common indications include evaluation of [[lung transplantation]], preoperative evaluation, evaluation of [[right-to-left shunt]]s.<ref>Society of Nuclear Medicine Procedure - Guideline for Lung Scintigraphy. Version 3.0, approved February 7, 2004 [http://interactive.snm.org/docs/Lung%20Scintigraphy_v3.0.pdf]</ref>

In the ventilation phase of a ventilation/perfusion scan, a gaseous radionuclide [[xenon]] or [[technetium]] [[DTPA]] in an aerosol form (or ideally using Technegas, a radioaerosol invented in Australia by Dr Bill Burch and Dr Richard Fawdry) is inhaled by the patient through a mouthpiece or mask that covers the nose and mouth. The perfusion phase of the test involves the intravenous injection of radioactive technetium [[macro aggregated albumin]] (Tc99m-MAA). A gamma camera acquires the images for both phases of the study.

===Bone===
{{main|bone scintigraphy}}
For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching [[technetium-99m]] to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer.

===Heart===
A ''thallium stress test'' is a form of scintigraphy, where the amount of [[thallium]]-201 detected in cardiac tissues correlates with tissue blood supply. Viable cardiac cells have normal [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ion exchange pumps]]. Thallium binds the K<sup>+</sup> pumps and is transported into the cells. Exercise or [[dipyridamole]] induces widening ([[vasodilation]]) of normal coronary arteries. This produces coronary steal from areas where arteries are maximally dilated. Areas of infarct or [[Ischemia|ischemic tissue]] will remain "cold". Pre- and post-stress thallium may indicate areas that will benefit from myocardial [[revascularization]]. Redistribution indicates the existence of coronary steal and the presence of ischemic [[coronary artery disease]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=u_A5BSqsb20C&pg=PA100&dq=thallium+stress+NA%2B/K%2B&cd=5#v=onepage&q=thallium%20stress%20NA%2B%2FK%2B|page=100|title=Primary Care Cardiology |author=George J. Taylor |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn= 1-4051-0386-8}}</ref>

===Parathyroid===
{{main|Sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy}}
Tc99m-[[sestamibi]] is used to detect [[parathyroid adenoma]]s.<ref name="Rosen2008">{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Clifford J.|title=Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uiZG0v9K6XEC&pg=PA168|accessdate=17 July 2011|date=2008-11-18|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-9778882-1-4|pages=168–}}</ref>

===Thyroid===
{{Main|Radioactive iodine uptake test}}
To detect metastases/function of thyroid, the isotopes [[iodine-131]] or Technetium-99m is generally used,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1677/ERC-07-0120}} [http://erc.endocrinology-journals.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/3/799]</ref> and for this purpose the iodide isotope does not need to be attached to another protein or molecule, because thyroid tissue takes up free iodide actively.

===Full body===
Examples are [[gallium scan]]s, [[indium white blood cell scan]]s, [[Iobenguane]] scan (MIBG) and [[octreotide scan]]s. The MIBG scan detects adrenergic tissue and thus can be used to identify the location of [[tumor]]s<ref name="pmid17374863">{{cite journal |author=Scarsbrook AF, Ganeshan A, Statham J, ''et al.'' |title=Anatomic and functional imaging of metastatic carcinoid tumors |journal=Radiographics |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=455–77 |year=2007 |pmid=17374863 |doi=10.1148/rg.272065058}}</ref> such as [[phaeochromocytoma]]s and [[neuroblastoma]]s.

==Function tests==
Certain tests, such as the [[Schilling test]] and [[Urea breath test]], use radioisotopes but are not used to produce a specific image.
