The '''College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka''' ('''CCPSL''') is the [[professional association]] of the Public Health Practitioners in [[Sri Lanka]]. The membership consists of specialists in Community Medicine and [[master's degree]] holders in Community Medicine. In addition to these professionals, there are members from other specialties as well. This organisation is incorporated by an act of Parliament No.18/99.

== History ==
The first professional association of public health officers in Sri Lanka was the Society of Medical officers of health which was  established during the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial era on 26 November 1927. It was established with a view to safeguarding interests of its members and promoting [[public health]] in the country and stimulating interest of the public in matters relevant to their health.  Dr. F.E. Bridger was the first president. It started with a membership of 26 which rose to 56 in 4 years. The society consisted of [[Medical Officers of Health]] (MOH), specialists in public health and professionals engaged in the advancement of public health. ''The transactions of the society of medical officers of health of [[Ceylon]]'' was their annual journal, made up of papers presented at the annual meeting.

In 1960, the society changed its name to the “Ceylon Public Health Association”.  It brought under its banner all persons involved in public health thus making it an exclusive forum for both medical and non-medical professionals equally.  These included clinicians, sanitary engineers,  health educators and invariably MOHs. The journal was also renamed as the ''Journal of the Ceylon Public Health Association''.  In 1960, the society reached a state of dormancy. In 1970, some keen public health practitioners formed the Sri Lanka association of preventive and social medicine.  Dr. N.P.M.Cooray was its inaugural president while Dr. Terrance Fernando was the secretary. The association was again renamed as the Sri Lanka association of Community Medicine. The association organised regular guest lectures and symposia. A one day scientific session was an annual feature. High quality{{fact|date=July 2008}} research papers were presented to the highly attended membership. Annual sessions were followed by the general meeting. Presidential address preceded the annual dinner in the evening. 

In 1994, the members unanimously adopted a resolution to convert the association to a college.  It was named The College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka.  Professor Dulitha Fernando was the first president. Initial membership was 180.  The first council meeting was held on 13 December 1995. The first annual sessions were held on 6th and 7th of December 1996.  In the inaugural ceremony Professor Savithri Gunasekera, the vice chancellor of the [[University of Colombo]] was the chief guest.  The oldest and most distinguished member and a past president Dr. W.A. Karunaratne was admitted as the first fellow of the college.

As a mark of recognition of the service rendered by the College of Community Physicians in promoting public health in Sri Lanka, the World Health Organization has supported the college to establish a public health forum. The forum was ceremoniously opened by Dr. Samlee Plianbangchang, the Regional Director of the WHO South East Asian Region (SEAR) on 11 th April  2008.
