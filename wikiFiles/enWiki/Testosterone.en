{{TOC limit|3}}
== Physiological effects ==
In general, [[androgens]] promote [[protein synthesis]] and growth of those tissues with [[androgen receptors]].  Testosterone effects can be classified as [[virilization|virilizing]] and [[anabolism|anabolic]], though the distinction is somewhat artificial, as many of the effects can be considered both.

* ''Anabolic effects'' include growth of [[muscle mass]] and strength, increased [[bone density]] and strength, and stimulation of linear growth and [[bone maturation]].
* ''Androgenic effects'' include [[Developmental biology|maturation]] of the [[sex organs]], particularly the [[penis]] and the formation of the [[scrotum]] in the fetus, and after birth (usually at [[puberty]]) a deepening of the voice, growth of the [[beard]] and [[axillary hair]]. Many of these fall into the category of male [[secondary sex characteristics]].

Testosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence. For [[postnatal]] effects in both males and females, these are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone.

=== Prenatal ===
The ''prenatal androgen effects'' occur during two different stages.  Between 4 and 6 weeks of the gestation.
*Genital virilization (midline fusion, [[phallus|phallic]] [[urethra]], scrotal thinning and rugation, [[phallic]] enlargement); although the role of testosterone is far smaller than that of [[dihydrotestosterone]].
*Development of [[prostate]] and [[seminal vesicle]]s.

During the second trimester, androgen level is associated with [[gender]] formation.<ref name="pmid19403051">{{cite journal | author = Swaab DF, Garcia-Falgueras A | title = Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation | journal = Funct. Neurol. |volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–28 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19403051 | doi = }}</ref>  This period affects the femininization or masculinization of the fetus and can be a better predictor of feminine or mascular behaviours such as sex typed behaviour than an adult's own levels. A mother's testosterone level during pregnancy is correlated with her daughter's sex-typical behavior as an adult, and the correlation is even stronger than with the daughter's own adult testosterone level.<ref name="isbn0-8135-3053-9">{{cite book | author = Browne KR | title = Biology at work: rethinking sexual equality | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, N.J | year = 2002 | page = 112 | isbn = 0-8135-3053-9 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=vq_0BUkcZ5MC&lpg=PP1&dq=Biology%20at%20Work%3A%20Rethinking%20Sexual%20Equality&pg=PA112#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>

=== Early infancy ===
''Early infancy androgen effects'' are the least understood.  In the first weeks of life for male infants, testosterone levels rise. The levels remain in a pubertal range for a few months, but usually reach the barely detectable levels of childhood by 4–6 months of age.<ref name="pmid4715291">{{cite journal | author = Forest MG, Cathiard AM, Bertrand JA | title = Evidence of testicular activity in early infancy | journal = J.

=== Pre-peripubertal ===
''Pre- Peripubertal effects'' are the first observable effects of rising
androgen levels at the end of childhood, occurring in both boys and girls.
*Adult-type [[body odor]]
*Increased oiliness of skin and hair, [[Acne vulgaris|acne]]
*[[Pubarche]] (appearance of [[pubic hair]])
*[[Axillary hair]]
*[[Growth spurt]], accelerated [[epiphysis|bone maturation]]
*[[Hair]] on upper lip and [[sideburn]]s.

=== Pubertal ===
''Pubertal effects'' begin to occur when androgen has been higher than normal adult female levels for months or years. In males, these are usual late pubertal effects, and occur in women after prolonged periods of heightened levels of free testosterone in the blood.
*Enlargement of [[sebaceous glands]]. This might cause acne.
*[[Phallic]] enlargement or [[clitoromegaly]]
*Increased [[libido]] and frequency of [[erection]] or clitoral engorgement
*Pubic hair extends to thighs and up toward [[Navel|umbilicus]]
*[[Facial hair]] ([[sideburns]], [[beard]], [[moustache]])
* Loss of scalp hair (Androgenetic alopecia)
*[[Chest hair]], periareolar hair, [[perianal]] hair
*[[Leg hair]]
*[[Axillary hair]]
*Subcutaneous [[body fat|fat]] in face decreases
*Increased muscle strength and mass<ref name="pmid8637535">{{cite journal | author = Bhasin S, Storer TW, Berman N, Callegari C, Clevenger B, Phillips J, Bunnell TJ, Tricker R, Shirazi A, Casaburi R | title = The effects of supraphysiologic doses of testosterone on muscle size and strength in normal men | journal = N.

*Deepening of voice
*Growth of the [[Adam's apple]]
*Growth of [[spermatogenic]] tissue in testicles, male [[fertility]]
*Growth of [[jaw]], brow, chin, nose, and remodeling of facial bone contours
*Shoulders become broader and rib cage expands
*Completion of bone maturation and termination of growth. This occurs indirectly via [[estradiol]] [[metabolites]] and hence more gradually in men than women.

=== Adult ===
Adult testosterone effects are more clearly demonstrable in males than in females, but are likely important to both sexes. Some of these effects may decline as testosterone levels decrease in the later decades of adult life.

==== Testosterone and sexual arousal ====
*See also: [[Sexual_arousal#Hormones|Hormones and sexual arousal]]

It has been found that when testosterone and endorphins in ejaculated semen meet the cervical wall after sexual intercourse, females receive a spike in testosterone, endorphin, and [[oxytocin]] levels, and males after orgasm during copulation experience an increase in endorphins and a marked increase in oxytocin levels. This adds to the hospitable physiological environment in the female internal reproductive tract for conceiving, and later for nurturing the conceptus in the pre-embryonic stages, and stimulates feelings of love, desire, and paternal care in the male (this is the only time male oxytocin levels rival a female's).<ref name="pmid15177709" />

=====Mammalian studies=====
Studies conducted on rats have indicated that their degree of sexual arousal is sensitive to reductions in testosterone. When testosterone-deprived rats were given medium levels of testosterone, their sexual behaviors (copulation, partner preference, etc.) resumed, but not when given low amounts of the same hormone. Therefore, these mammals may provide a model for studying clinical populations among humans suffering from sexual arousal deficits such as [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]].<ref name="pmid20920505">{{cite journal | author = Harding SM, Velotta JP | title = Comparing the relative amount of testosterone required to restore sexual arousal, motivation, and performance in male rats | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 666–73 | year = 2011 | month = May | pmid = 20920505 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.09.009 }}</ref>

=== Aggression and criminality ===
{{See also|Aggression#Testosterone|biosocial criminology}}
The "evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory" focuses on the hormone testosterone as a factor influencing aggression and criminality and being evolutionary beneficial during certain forms of competition. In most species, males are more aggressive than females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on their aggressive behavior. In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens which happen at the same time as testosterone levels rise. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by a [[lumbar puncture]] which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often instead used more unreliable measurements from blood or saliva. Most studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. Nearly all studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most studies have also found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with criminality such as [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial behavior]] and [[alcoholism]]. Many studies have also been done on the relationship between more general aggressive behavior/feelings and testosterone. About half the studies have found a relationship and about half no relationship.<ref name="isbn0-12-373612-9">{{cite book | author = Wright J, Ellis L, Beaver K | title = Handbook of crime correlates | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 2009 | pages =208–210 | isbn = 0-12-373612-9 }}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
The original and primary use of testosterone is for the treatment of males who have too little or no natural endogenous testosterone production—males with [[hypogonadism]]. Appropriate use for this purpose is legitimate hormone replacement therapy (testosterone replacement therapy [TRT]), which maintains serum testosterone levels in the normal range.

However, over the years, as with every hormone, testosterone or other [[anabolic steroids]] has also been given for many other conditions and purposes besides replacement, with varying success but higher rates of side effects or problems. Examples include reducing [[infertility]], correcting lack of libido or erectile dysfunction, correcting [[osteoporosis]], encouraging [[penis enlargement|penile enlargement]], encouraging height growth, encouraging [[bone marrow]] stimulation and reversing the effects of [[anemia]], and even appetite stimulation. By the late 1940s testosterone was being touted as an anti-aging wonder drug (e.g., see [[Paul de Kruif]]'s ''The Male Hormone'').<ref name = "de Kruif_1945"/> Decline of testosterone production with age has led to interest in [[androgen replacement therapy]].<ref name="pmid16985841">{{cite journal | author = Myers JB, Meacham RB | title = Androgen Replacement Therapy in the Aging Male | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 216–26 | year = 2003 | pmid = 16985841 | pmc = 1508369 | doi = | url =  }}</ref>

To take advantage of its [[virilizing]] effects, testosterone is often administered to [[transsexual|transsexual men]] as part of the [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormone replacement therapy]], with a "target level" of the normal male testosterone level. Like-wise, [[trans women|transsexual women]] are sometimes prescribed [[antiandrogen|anti-androgens]] to decrease the level of testosterone in the body and allow for the effects of estrogen to develop.

=== Hormone replacement therapy ===
{{Main|Androgen replacement therapy}}
Testosterone levels decline gradually with age in human beings. The clinical significance of this decrease is debated (see [[andropause]]). There is disagreement about when to treat aging men with testosterone replacement therapy. The American Society of Andrology's position is that "testosterone replacement therapy in aging men is indicated when both clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of [[Hypogonadism|androgen deficiency]] and decreased testosterone levels are present."<ref name="pmid16474019">{{cite journal | author = | title = Testosterone replacement therapy for male aging: ASA position statement | journal = J.

There is not total agreement on the threshold of testosterone value below which a man would be considered [[hypogonadal]]. (Currently there are no standards as to when to treat women.)  Testosterone can be measured as "free" (that is, bioavailable and unbound) or more commonly, "total" (including the percentage which is chemically bound and unavailable).

Adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include minor side effects such as acne and oily skin, and more significant complications such as increased [[hematocrit]] which can require [[venipuncture]] in order to treat, exacerbation of [[sleep apnea]] and acceleration of pre-existing [[prostate cancer]] growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation. Another adverse effect may be significant hair loss and/or thinning of the hair.  This may be prevented with Propecia (Finasteride), which blocks DHT (a byproduct of testosterone in the body), during treatment.  Exogenous testosterone also causes suppression of [[spermatogenesis]] and can lead to infertility.<ref name="pmid1977002">{{cite journal | author = | title = Contraceptive efficacy of testosterone-induced azoospermia in normal men.

=== Insufficiency ===
{{Further|Hypogonadism}}
''Testosterone insufficiency'' (also termed ''hypotestosteronism'' or ''hypotestosteronemia'') is an abnormally low testosterone production. It may occur because of testicular dysfunction ([[primary hypogonadism]]) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction ([[secondary hypogonadism]]) and may be congenital or acquired.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gould DC, Petty R |title=The male menopause: does it exist?: For: Some men need investigation and testosterone treatment |journal=West.

==Recreational use==
=== Athletics ===
Testosterone can be used by an [[sportsperson|athlete]] in order to improve performance, but it is considered to be a form of [[Doping (sport)|doping]] in most sports.  There are several application methods for testosterone, including [[intramuscular injection]]s, [[transdermal|transdermal gels and patches]], and implantable pellets. Supplement of the hormone results in lower metabolic production via the [[Ray Farquharson|Farquharson phenomenon]], creating long term dependence for improved performance level.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Anabolic steroids]] (including testosterone) have also been taken to enhance muscle development, strength, or endurance. They do so directly by increasing the muscles' protein synthesis.  As a result, muscle fibers become larger and repair faster than the average person's.
After a series of scandals and publicity in the 1980s (such as [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson's]] improved performance at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]]), [[prohibition]]s of anabolic steroid use were renewed or strengthened by many sports organizations. Testosterone and other anabolic steroids were designated a "[[controlled substance]]" by the [[United States Congress]] in 1990, with the ''Anabolic Steroid Control Act''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ussc.gov/USSCsteroidsreport-0306.pdf#search=%22Anabolic%20Steroid%20Control%20Act%20of%201990%22 | title = Anabolic Steroid Control Act| publisher = United States Sentencing Commission|year = 1990}}</ref> The use is seen as being a seriously problematic issue in modern sport, particularly given the lengths to which athletes and professional laboratories go to in trying to conceal such abuse from sports regulators. Steroid abuse once again came into the spotlight recently as a result of the [[Chris Benoit]] double murder-suicide in 2007, and the media frenzy surrounding it&nbsp;– however, there has been no evidence indicating steroid use as a contributing factor.

=== Detection of abuse ===
A number of methods for detecting testosterone use by athletes have been employed, most based on a [[urinalysis|urine test]]. These include the testosterone/[[epitestosterone]] ratio (normally less than 6), the testosterone/luteinizing hormone ratio and the [[carbon-13]] / [[carbon-12]] ratio (pharmaceutical testosterone contains less carbon-13 than endogenous testosterone). In some testing programs, an individual's own historical results may serve as a reference interval for interpretation of a suspicious finding. Another approach being investigated is the detection of the administered form of testosterone, usually an ester, in hair.<ref name="pmid19549614">{{cite journal | author = Strahm E, Emery C, Saugy M, Dvorak J, Saudan C | title = Detection of testosterone administration based on the carbon isotope ratio profiling of endogenous steroids: international reference populations of professional soccer players | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 43 | issue = 13 | pages = 1041–4 | year = 2009 | month = December | pmid = 19549614 | pmc = 2784500 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2009.058669 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid20355155">{{cite journal | author = Kicman AT, Cowan DA | title = Subject-based profiling for the detection of testosterone administration in sport | journal = Drug Test Anal | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–4 | year = 2009 | month = January | pmid = 20355155 | doi = 10.1002/dta.14 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid19353724">{{cite journal | author = Pozo OJ, Deventer K, Van Eenoo P, Rubens R, Delbeke FT | title = Quantification of testosterone undecanoate in human hair by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry | journal = Biomed.

== Adverse effects ==
Exogenous testosterone supplementation comes with a number of health risks.  [[Fluoxymesterone]] and [[methyltestosterone]] are synthetic derivatives of testosterone. Methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone are no longer prescribed by physicians given their poor safety record, and testosterone replacement in men does have a very good safety record as evidenced by over sixty years of medical use in hypogonadal men.

Testosterone in the presence of a slow-growing cancer is assumed to increase its growth rate.

== Biochemistry ==
=== Biosynthesis ===
[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|left|500px|Human [[steroidogenesis]], showing testosterone near bottom.]]

=== Regulation ===
[[File:Hypothalamus pituitary testicles axis.png|thumb|right|Hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis]]

In males, testosterone is primarily synthesized in [[Leydig cells]].  The number of Leydig cells in turn is regulated by [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH).  In addition, the amount of testosterone produced by existing Leydig cells is under the control of LH which regulates the expression of 17-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.<ref name="isbn0-9627422-7-9">{{cite book | author =  Payne AH, O'Shaughnessy P | authorlink = | editor = Payne AH, Hardy MP, Russell LD | others = | title = Leydig Cell | edition = | language = | publisher = Cache River Press | location = Vienna [Il] | year = 1996 | origyear = | pages = 260–285 | quote = | isbn = 0-9627422-7-9 | oclc = | doi = | url = | chapter = Structure, function, and regulation of steroidogenic enzymes in the Leydig cell }}</ref>

Finally, increasing levels of testosterone through a negative [[feedback]] loop act on the hypothalamus and pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH and FSH/LH, respectively.

DHT is a more potent form of testosterone while estradiol has completely different activities (feminization) compared to testosterone (masculinization).

== Mechanism of action ==

The effects of testosterone in humans and other [[vertebrates]] occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the [[androgen receptor]] (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to [[estradiol]] and activation of certain [[estrogen receptor]]s.<ref name="pmid18406296">{{cite journal | author = Hiipakka RA, Liao S | title = Molecular mechanism of androgen action |journal = Trends Endocrinol.

Free testosterone (T) is transported into the [[cytoplasm]] of target [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], where it can bind to the [[androgen receptor]], or can be reduced to 5α-[[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme [[5-alpha reductase]]. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 5 times that of T.<ref name="pmid3762019">{{cite journal | author = Breiner M, Romalo G, Schweikert HU | title = Inhibition of androgen receptor binding by natural and synthetic steroids in cultured human genital skin fibroblasts | journal = Klin.

The areas of binding are called [[hormone response element]]s (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain [[gene]]s, producing the androgen effects.

Androgen receptors occur in many different vertebrate body system tissues, and both males and females respond similarly to similar levels. Greatly differing amounts of testosterone prenatally, at puberty, and throughout life account for a share of biological [[sexual differentiation|differences]] between males and females.

The bones and the brain are two important tissues in humans where the primary effect of testosterone is by way of [[aromatization]] to [[estradiol]]. In the bones, estradiol accelerates ossification of cartilage into bone, leading to closure of the [[epiphysis|epiphyses]] and conclusion of growth. In the central nervous system, testosterone is aromatized to estradiol. Estradiol rather than testosterone serves as the most important feedback signal to the hypothalamus (especially affecting [[luteinizing hormone|LH]] secretion).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In many [[mammal]]s, prenatal or perinatal "masculinization" of the [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] areas of the brain by estradiol derived from testosterone programs later male sexual behavior.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Synthetic analogs ==
A number of synthetic analogs of testosterone have been developed with improved [[bioavailability]] and [[biological half-life|metabolic half life]] relative to testosterone.  Many of these analogs have an [[alkyl]] group introduced at the C-17 position in order to prevent [[Xenobiotic conjugation#Phase II - conjugation|conjugation]] and hence improve oral bioavailability. These are the so-called "17-aa" (17-alkyl androgen) family of androgens such as [[fluoxymesterone]] and [[methyltestosterone]].

== Related drugs ==
Some drugs indirectly target testosterone as a way of treating certain conditions. For example, [[5-alpha-reductase inhibitor]]s such as [[finasteride]] inhibit the conversion of testosterone into [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), a metabolite which is more potent than testosterone.<ref name="pmid15853706">{{cite journal | author = Bratoeff E, Cabeza M, Ramirez E, Heuze Y, Flores E | title = Recent advances in the chemistry and pharmacological activity of new steroidal antiandrogens and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors | journal = Curr.

== History ==
A [[testicular]] action was linked to circulating blood fractions&nbsp;– now understood to be a family of androgenic hormones&nbsp;– in the early work on castration and testicular transplantation in fowl by [[Arnold Adolph Berthold]] (1803–1861).<ref name="Berthold_1849">{{cite journal |author = Berthold AA | title = Transplantation der Hoden | trans_title = Transplantation of testis | language = German | journal = Arch. Anat. Physiol.

He reported in ''The Lancet'' that his vigor and feeling of well-being were markedly restored but, predictably, the effects were transient<ref name="Brown-Sequard_1889">{{cite journal |author = Brown-Sequard CE | title = The effects produced on man by subcutaneous injections of liquid obtained from the testicles of animals |language = | journal = Lancet |volume = 2 | issue =  3438|page = 105| year = 1889 | month =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)64118-1| url =}}</ref> (and likely based on a placebo effect), and Brown-Séquard's hopes for the compound were dashed.  Suffering the ridicule of his colleagues, his work on the mechanisms and effects of androgens in human beings was abandoned by Brown-Séquard and succeeding generations of biochemists for nearly 40 years.

The trail remained cold until the University of Chicago's Professor of Physiologic Chemistry, Fred C. Koch, established easy access to a large source of bovine testicles—the Chicago stockyards—and to students willing to endure the ceaseless toil of extracting their isolates. In 1927, Koch and his student, Lemuel McGee, derived 20&nbsp;mg of a substance from a supply of 40 pounds of bovine testicles that, when administered to castrated roosters, pigs and rats, remasculinized them.<ref name="Gallagher_Koch_1929">{{cite journal | author = Gallagher TF, Koch FC | title = The testicular hormone |journal = J.
