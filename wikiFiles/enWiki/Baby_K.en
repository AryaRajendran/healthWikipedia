'''Baby K''' (October 13, 1992 &ndash; April 5, 1995) was an [[anencephaly|anencephalic]] baby who became the center of a major U.S. court case and a debate among [[bioethics|bioethicists]].

==History==
===Prenatal assessment===
'''Stephanie Keene''',<ref name=rtd95 /> better known by the pseudonym Baby K, was born at [[Inova Fairfax Hospital|Fairfax Hospital]] in [[Virginia]], [[USA]].  At the time of her birth, she was missing most of her brain, including the cortex; only the [[brainstem]] had developed during pregnancy, the portion of the brain responsible for [[autonomic function|autonomic]] and regulatory functions, such as the control of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], the [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and [[blood pressure]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/us/hospital-fights-parents-wish-to-keep-life-support-for-a-brain-dead-child.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm |title=Ruling in Virginia |location=Richmond |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 11, 1994}}</ref>

===Opposing viewpoints===
The baby's mother had been notified of her condition following [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]],<ref name=rtd95 /> and was advised to terminate the pregnancy by her [[obstetrician]] and [[neonatologist]]<ref name="Flannery">{{cite journal|last=Flannery|first=Ellen J.|title=One advocate’s viewpoint: conflict and tensions in the Baby K case|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|publisher=American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=23|issue=1|pages=7–12|doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.1995.tb01323.x|accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref> but chose to carry the child to term because of "a firm [[Christianity|Christian]] faith that all life should be protected".<ref name=nyt93>{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=Hospital Appeals Ruling on Treating Baby with Most of Brain Gone|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 1993 |accessdate=May 25, 2009|page=A10|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/us/hospital-appeals-ruling-on-treating-baby-born-with-most-of-brain-gone.html?scp=4&sq=Baby%20K&st=nyt&pagewanted=1}}</ref>  The hospital believed that care provided to the baby would be [[futile medical care|futile]].<ref name=nyt93 /> The mother believed mechanical breathing support must be provided during the baby's periodic respiratory crises.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=Court Order to Treat Baby With Partial Brain Prompts Debate on Costs and Ethics|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 20, 1994 |accessdate=May 25, 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/20/us/court-order-to-treat-baby-with-partial-brain-prompts-debate-on-costs-and-ethics.html?scp=5&sq=Baby+K&st=nyt|page=A20}}</ref> Fairfax Hospital doctors strongly advised a [[do not resuscitate]] order for the child, which the mother refused. Stephanie remained on [[ventilator]] support for 6 weeks while Fairfax searched for another hospital to transfer to, but no other hospital would accept her. After the baby was weaned off constant ventilator support, the mother agreed to move the child to a nursing facility, but the baby returned to the hospital many times for respiratory problems.

===Legal proceedings===
When Stephanie was admitted to the hospital at six months of age for severe respiratory problems, the hospital filed a legal motion to appoint a guardian for the child's care and sought a court order that the hospital did not need to provide any services beyond [[palliative care]].  At trial, several experts testified that providing ventilator support to an anencephalic infant went beyond the accepted standard of medical care.<ref name="4th Circuit">''Matter of Baby K.'', 16 [[Federal Reporter|F. 3d]] 590 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|4th Cir.]] 1994).</ref> In contrast, the baby's mother argued her case on the grounds of religious freedom and the [[sanctity of life]]. In a controversial ruling, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] decided that the hospital caring for Stephanie must put her on a mechanical ventilator whenever she had trouble breathing. The court interpreted the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] (EMTALA) to require continued ventilation for the infant. The wording of this act requires that patients who present with a [[medical emergency]] must get "such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition" before the patient is transferred to another facility. The court refused to take a [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] position on the issue, insisting that it was only interpreting the laws as they existed. As a result of the decision, Stephanie was kept alive much longer than most anencephalic babies.<ref name=nyt93 />  It has been suggested by the dissenting judge in the case that the court should have used the condition anencephaly as the basis of the case, not the recurring subsidiary symptoms of respiratory distress. As the irreversibility of anencephaly is widely understood in the medical community, he argued that the decision to continue futile care only resulted in the repetitive diversion of medical equipment.<ref name="4th Circuit" />

Stephanie Keene died April 5, 1995, at Fairfax Hospital, at age 2 years 174 days.<ref name=rtd95>{{cite news|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|title=`Baby K' Dies at 2½ in Fairfax Hospital|date=1995-04-07|page=B.6|accessdate=2009-05-25|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=17976227&sid=4&Fmt=3&clientId=20886&RQT=309&VName=PQD}} (Registration required)</ref>

==Significance==
The case of Baby K is of particular importance to the field of [[bioethics]] because of the issues it raises: the definition of death, the nature of [[personhood]], the concept of medical [[futile medical care|futility]], and many issues relating to the allocation of scarce resources. Some commentators, including [[Arthur Kohrman]] and [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]], have argued that the ruling effectively undermined the right of physicians to make sound medical decisions.{{fact|date=January 2013}}
