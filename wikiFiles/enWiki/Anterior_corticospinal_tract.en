The '''anterior corticospinal tract''' (also called the '''ventral corticospinal tract''', '''medial corticospinal tract''', '''direct pyramidal tract''', or '''anterior cerebrospinal fasciculus''') is a small bundle of descending fibers that connect the [[cerebral cortex]] to the [[spinal cord]]. It is usually small, varying inversely in size with the [[lateral corticospinal tract]], which is the main part of the [[corticospinal tract]].

It lies close to the [[anterior median fissure]], and is present only in the upper part of the [[medulla spinalis]]; gradually diminishing in size as it descends, it ends about the middle of the thoracic region.

It consists of descending fibers that arise from cells in the motor area of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, and that, as they run downward in the medulla spinalis, cross in succession through the [[anterior white commissure]] to the opposite side, where they end, either directly or indirectly, by [[arborizing]] around the [[motor neuron]]s in the [[anterior column]].

A few of its fibers pass to the [[lateral column]] of the same side and to the gray matter at the base of the [[posterior column]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

They conduct voluntary motor impulses from the [[precentral gyrus]] to the motor centers of the cord.
