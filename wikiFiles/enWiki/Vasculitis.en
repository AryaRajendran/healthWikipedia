'''Vasculitis''' (plural: ''vasculitides'')<ref name="urlVasculitis - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Vasculitis |title=Vasculitis - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-08}}</ref> is a group of disorders that destroy [[blood vessels]] by [[inflammation]].<ref name="urlGlossary of dermatopathological terms. DermNet NZ">{{cite web |url=http://dermnetnz.org/pathology/pathology-glossary.html |title=Glossary of dermatopathological terms. DermNet NZ |work= |accessdate=2009-01-08}}</ref> Both [[arteries]] and [[veins]] are affected. [[Lymphangitis]] is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000114505|Vasculitis}}</ref> Vasculitis is primarily due to [[leukocyte]] migration and resultant damage.

Although both occur in vasculitis, inflammation of veins ([[phlebitis]]) or arteries ([[arteritis]]) on their own are separate entities.

==Classification==
Vasculitis can be classified by the cause, the location, the type of vessel or the size of vessel. 
* ''Underlying cause''. For example, the cause of [[syphilitic aortitis]] is infectious ([[aortitis]] simply refers to arteritis of the [[aorta]], which is an artery.) However, the cause of many forms of vasculitis are poorly understood. There is usually an immune component, but the trigger is often not identified. In these cases, the antibody found is sometimes used in classification, as in [[ANCA-associated vasculitides]].
* ''Location of the affected vessels''. For example, [[ICD-10]] classifies "[[vasculitis limited to skin]]" with skin conditions (under "L"), and "[[necrotizing vasculopathies]]" with musculoskeletal system and connective tissue conditions (under "M"). Arteritis/phlebitis on their own are classified with circulatory conditions (under "I").
* ''Type or size of the blood vessels'' that they predominantly affect.<ref name="pmid8129773">{{cite journal |author=Jennette JC, Falk RJ, Andrassy K, ''et al.'' |title=Nomenclature of systemic vasculitides. Proposal of an international consensus conference |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=187–92 |year=1994 |pmid=8129773 |doi=10.1002/art.1780370206}}</ref> Apart from the [[arteritis]]/[[phlebitis]] distinction mentioned above, vasculitis is often classified by the caliber of the vessel affected. However, there can be some variation in the size of the vessels affected.

According to the size of the vessel affected, vasculitis can be classified into:<ref>http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/musculoskeletal_and_connective_tissue_disorders/vasculitis/overview_of_vasculitis.html</ref>
* Large vessel: [[Polymyalgia rheumatica]], [[Takayasu's arteritis]], [[Temporal arteritis]]
* Medium vessel: [[Buerger's disease]], [[Cutaneous vasculitis]], [[Kawasaki disease]], [[Polyarteritis nodosa]]
* Small vessel: [[Behçet's syndrome]], [[Churg–Strauss syndrome]], cutaneous vasculitis, [[Henoch–Schönlein purpura]], [[Microscopic polyangiitis]], [[Wegener's granulomatosis]]

==Conditions==
Some disorders have vasculitis as their main feature. The major types are given in the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!colspan=3| Comparison of major types of vasculitis
|-
! Vasculitis !! Affected organs !! [[Histopathology]]
|-
| [[Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis]] || Skin, kidneys || [[Neutrophil]]s, [[fibrinoid necrosis]]
|-
| [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] || Nose, lungs, kidneys || Neutrophils, [[giant cell]]s
|-
| [[Churg–Strauss syndrome]] || Lungs, kidneys, heart, skin || [[Histiocyte]]s, [[eosinophil]]s
|-
| [[Kawasaki disease]] || Skin, heart, mouth, eyes || [[Lymphocyte]]s, [[endothelial]] necrosis
|-
| [[Buerger's disease]] || Leg arteries and veins ([[gangrene]]) || Neutrophils, [[granuloma]]s
|-
| "Limited" Wegener's vasculitis  || Commonly sinuses, brain, and skin; can affect other organs such as lungs, kidneys, joints; || 
|}

[[Takayasu's arteritis]], [[polyarteritis nodosa]] and [[giant cell arteritis]] mainly involve arteries and are thus sometimes classed specifically under [[arteritis]].

Furthermore, there are many conditions that have vasculitis as an accompanying or atypical symptom, including:
* [[Rheumatic diseases]], such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], and [[dermatomyositis]]
* [[Cancer]], such as [[lymphomas]]
* [[Infections]], such as [[hepatitis C]]
* Exposure to chemicals and drugs, such as [[amphetamines]], [[cocaine]], and [[anthrax vaccines]] which contain the Anthrax Protective Antigen as the primary ingredient.


Several of these vasculitides are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.<ref name=Millet2013>Millet A, Pederzoli-Ribeil M, Guillevin L, Witko-Sarsat V, Mouthon L (2013) Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides: is it time to split up the group? Ann Rheum Dis </ref> These are
*granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis)
*eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome).
*microscopic polyangiitis

==Symptoms==

Possible symptoms include:<ref name="urlThe Johns Hopkins Vasculitis Center - Symptoms of Vasculitis">{{cite web |url=http://vasculitis.med.jhu.edu/whatis/symptoms.html |title=The Johns Hopkins Vasculitis Center - Symptoms of Vasculitis |work= |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref>
* General symptoms: [[Fever]], weight loss
* Skin: Palpable [[purpura]], [[livedo reticularis]]
* Muscles and joints: [[Myalgia]] or [[myositis]], [[arthralgia]] or [[arthritis]]
* Nervous system: [[Mononeuritis multiplex]], [[headache]], [[stroke]], [[tinnitus]], reduced [[visual acuity]], acute [[visual loss]]
* Heart and arteries: [[Myocardial infarction]], [[hypertension]], [[gangrene]]
* Respiratory tract: [[Epistaxis|Nose bleeds]], [[hemoptysis|bloody cough]], lung infiltrates
* GI tract: [[Abdominal pain]], [[melena|bloody stool]], perforations
* Kidneys: [[Glomerulonephritis]]

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Vasculitis FDG PET-CT.png|thumb|Severe Vasculitis of the major vessels, displayed on [[FDG-PET/CT]]]]
* Laboratory tests of blood or body fluids are performed for patients with active vasculitis. Their results will generally show signs of inflammation in the body, such as increased [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR), elevated [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP), [[anemia]], [[leukocytosis|increased white blood cell count]] and [[eosinophilia]]. Other possible findings are elevated [[antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody]] (ANCA) levels and [[hematuria]].
* Other organ functional tests may be abnormal. Specific abnormalities depend on the degree of various organs involvement.  A Brainspect can show decreased blood flow to the brain and brain damage.
* The definite diagnosis of vasculitis is established after a [[biopsy]] of involved organ or tissue, such as [[skin]], [[sinuses]], [[lung]], [[nerve]], [[brain]] and [[kidney]]. The biopsy elucidates the pattern of blood vessel inflammation.
* An alternative to biopsy can be an [[angiogram]] ([[x-ray]] test of the blood vessels). It can demonstrate characteristic patterns of inflammation in affected blood vessels.
* Acute onset of vasculitis-like symptoms in small children or babies may instead be the life-threatening [[purpura fulminans]], usually associated with severe infection.

==Treatment==
Treatments are generally directed toward stopping the inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Typically, [[cortisone]]-related medications, such as [[prednisone]], are used. Additionally, other [[immune suppression]] drugs, such as [[cyclophosphamide]] and others, are considered. In case of an infection, antimicrobial agents including [[cephalexin]] may be prescribed. Affected organs (such as the heart or lungs) may require specific medical treatment intended to improve their function during the active phase of the disease.
