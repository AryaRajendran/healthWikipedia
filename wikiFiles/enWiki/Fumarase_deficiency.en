'''Fumarase deficiency''' (or '''fumaric aciduria'''), also known as "Polygamist Down's",<ref name=digitaljournal /> is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[metabolic disorder]] characterized by a deficiency of the [[enzyme]] [[fumarate hydratase]], which is indicated by a build up of [[fumaric acid]] in the [[urine]].

==Pathophysiology==
Fumarase deficiency is caused by a mutation in the fumarate hydratase (FH) [[gene]] in humans, which encodes the enzyme that converts [[fumarate]] to [[malate]] in the [[mitochondria]].  Other mutant alleles of the FH gene, located on human [[Chromosome 1]] at position 1q42.1, cause [[Multiple cutaneous leiomyoma|multiple cutaneous]] and uterine [[leiomyomata]], hereditary [[leiomyomatosis]] and [[renal cell cancer]].<ref>{{OMIM|606812|Fumarase Deficiency}}</ref> Fumarase deficiency is one of the few known deficiencies of the [[Krebs cycle]] or [[tricarboxylic acid cycle]], the main enzymatic pathway of cellular aerobic [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].<ref name="isbn0-471-67808-2">{{cite book |author=Devlin, Thomas M. |title=Textbook of biochemistry: with clinical correlations |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-471-67808-2 |page=546}}</ref>

==Emergence in a polygamist settlement==
Fumarase deficiency is extremely rare, with only thirteen diagnosed and identified cases worldwide until roughly 1990. Since then an additional twenty cases have been documented in the twin towns of [[Colorado City, Arizona]] (formerly known as Short Creek or the [[Short Creek Community]]), and [[Hildale, Utah]], settled in the 1930s by the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], a church whose members left [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) beginning in 1890,<ref name="Dougherty2005">[http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-12-29/news/forbidden-fruit/ Forbidden Fruit:Inbreeding among polygamists along the Arizona-Utah border is producing a caste of severely retarded and deformed children], by John Dougherty, ''The Phoenix New Times News'', December 29, 2005, page 2.</ref> when the LDS Church [[1890 Manifesto|banned plural marriage]]. The condition has since been dubbed "Polygamist's [[Down syndrome|Down's]]."<ref name=digitaljournal>[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/195535 Mormon Sect's Polygamy Causes Most Of The World's Fumarase Deficiency Cases], Digital Journal</ref>  

Theodore Tarby, a pediatric [[neurologist]] who has treated some of the community's fumarase deficient residents, has been quoted as estimating the [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] of his patients as around 25.<ref>[http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,635182923,00.html Birth defect is plaguing children in FLDS towns:] Fumarase Deficiency afflicts 20, is linked to marriages of close Kin By John Hollenhorst for Deseret News Published: Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2006 11:36 p.m</ref>  While treating a child with a [[developmental disability]] Tarby sent off a [[Human urine|urine]] sample for testing and learned the child had a disorder so rare that only 13 other current cases were known worldwide.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0727298120070614?sp=true Polygamist community faces rare genetic disorder] By Jason Szep Thu Jun 14, 2007 11:00am EDT for Reuters</ref>  Tarby later learned the child he treated had a sibling who had been diagnosed with [[cerebral palsy]], a disease commonly associated with developmental difficulties.  This sibling also turned out to have fumarase deficiency.<ref name="Dougherty2005"/>
