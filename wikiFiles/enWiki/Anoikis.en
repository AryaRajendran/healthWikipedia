'''Anoikis''' is a form of [[programmed cell death]] which is induced by anchorage-dependent cells detaching from the surrounding [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM).<ref name="definition">{{cite journal |author=Frisch SM, Screaton RA |title=Anoikis mechanisms |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=555–62 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11544023 |doi=10.1016/S0955-0674(00)00251-9}}</ref> Usually cells stay close to the tissue to which they belong since the communication between proximal cells as well as between cells and ECM provide essential signals for growth or survival. When cells are detached from the ECM, ''i.e.'' there is a loss of normal cell–matrix interactions, they may undergo anoikis. However, [[metastatic]] tumor cells may escape from anoikis and invade other organs.

==Etymology==
The word '''Anoikis''' was coined by Frisch and Francis in a paper published in the [[Journal of Cell Biology]] in 1994<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119917/pdf/jc1244619.pdf</ref>. '''Anoikis''', in their words, means "(...the state of being without a home) to describe the cells' apoptotic response to the absence of cell–matrix interactions." The word apparently is a neologism construction consisting of three Greek [[morpheme]]s agglutinated together: [[wikt:ἀν-|ἀν-]] "without", [[wikt:οἶκος|οἰκ-]] "house", and -ις (extracted from -σις "trait, attribute"; confer apo-pto-sis "state of being fallen off").

==Anoikis in metastasis==
The mechanism by which invading tumor cells survive the anoikis process remains largely unknown. Recent findings suggest that the protein TrkB, best known for its role in the nervous system, might be involved together with its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It seems that TrkB could make tumor cells resistant to anoikis by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade.
In squamous cell carcinoma, researchers have found that anoikis resistance can be induced through hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activating BOTH extracellular signalling-receptor kinase (ERK) and PI3K.

Using a novel high-throughput screening assay, Mawji et al. showed that anisomycin can sensitize metastatic epithelial cells to anoikis and reduce [[circulating tumor cell]] implantation in vivo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mawji IA, Simpson CD, Gronda M, ''et al.'' |title=A chemical screen identifies anisomycin as an anoikis sensitizer that functions by decreasing FLIP protein synthesis |journal=Cancer Research |volume=67 |issue=17 |pages=8307–15 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17804746 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1687}}</ref> Anisomycin achieved this anti-metastatic activity in part by decreasing the abundance of the death receptor inhibiting protein FLIP. In related work, Schimmer's team showed that FLIP levels are higher in metastatic cells than non-metastatic cells, and that reducing FLIP levels using RNAi (RNA Interference) or other small molecule inhibitors of FLIP can sensitize metastatic cells to anoikis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mawji IA, Simpson CD, Hurren R, ''et al.'' |title=Critical role for Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein in anoikis resistance and distant tumor formation |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=99 |issue=10 |pages=811–22 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17505076 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djk182}}</ref> Given that FLIP is an inhibitor of anoikis, and that reducing FLIP can sensitize metastatic cells to anoikis, Mawji ''et al.'' hypothesize that FLIP reduction may be a viable therapeutic strategy against cancer metastasis.
