'''Hospital medicine''' in the [[United States]] is the discipline concerned with the [[medicine|medical]] care of [[High acuity medicine|acutely ill]] [[hospital]]ized patients. [[Physician]]s whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called '''hospitalists'''; this type of medical practice has extended beyond the US into [[Canada]].  The practical effect of the hospitalist is to act as transition coordinator and case manager, due to the tremendous growth in medical knowledge and resultant number of medical specialists. 

The term ''hospitalist'' was first coined by [[Robert M. Wachter|Robert Wachter]] and Lee Goldman in a 1996 ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' article.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wachter R, Goldman L |title=The emerging role of "hospitalists" in the American health care system |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=335 |issue=7 |pages=514–7 |year=1996 |pmid=8672160 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199608153350713}}</ref>  Hospitalist activities may include patient care, teaching, research, and leadership related to hospital care.  Hospital medicine, like [[emergency medicine]], is a specialty organized around a site of care (the hospital), rather than an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] (like [[cardiology]]), a [[disease]] (like [[oncology]]), or a patient’s age (like [[pediatrics]]).<ref>[http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/hmdef ''In 2009 The Society of Hospital Medicine Updated its definition of hospitalist and hospital medicine'', hospitalmedicine.org]</ref>

==Training==
The majority of hospitalists are physicians with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.) degree.<ref>[http://www.oprah.com/article/omagazine/200903_omag_primary_care ''New Kinds of Primary Care'', O The Oprah Magazine March 2009]</ref> While it was commonly believed that any residency program with a heavy inpatient component provided good hospitalist training, studies have found that general residency training is inadequate because common hospitalist problems like neurology, hospice and palliative care, consultative medicine, and quality assurance tend to be glossed over. To address this, residency programs are starting to develop hospitalist tracks with more tailored education.  Several universities have also started fellowship programs specifically geared toward hospitalist medicine.

According to the State of Hospital Medicine Survey by the Medical Group Management Association and the Society of Hospital Medicine, 89.60% of hospitalists specialize in general internal medicine, 5.5% in a pediatrics subspecialty, 3.7% in family practice and 1.2% in internal medicine pediatrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Practice_Resources&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=29857 |title=2012 Hospital Medicine Survey &#124; Society of Hospital Medicine |publisher=Hospitalmedicine.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> Data from the survey also reported that 53.5% of hospitalists are employed by hospitals/integrated delivery system and 25.3% are employed  by independent hospitalists groups. 

According to the recent data, there are more than 30,000 hospitalists practicing in 3,300 large hospitals and half of all community hospitals.<ref>http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Media_Kit&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=26269</ref>

==History==
Hospital medicine is a relatively new phenomenon in American medicine. Almost unheard of a generation ago, this type of practice arose from three powerful shifts in medical practice:
*Nearly all states, as well as the national residency accreditation organizations, the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA), have established limitations on [[medical resident|house staff]] duty hours, the number of hours that [[medical intern|interns]] and [[medical resident|residents]] can work. Many hospitalists are coming to perform the same tasks formerly performed by residents; although this is usually referred to as a House Officer rather than a hospitalist.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  The fundamental difference between a hospitalist and a house officer is that the hospitalist is the [[attending physician]] of a patient while that patient is hospitalized.  The house officer admits the patient for another attending physician and cares for that patient until the attending physician can see the patient.
*Most primary care physicians are experiencing a shrinking role in hospital care. Many primary care physicians find they can generate more revenue in the office during the hour or more they would have spent on inpatient rounds, including traveling to and from the hospital.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In addition to patient care duties, hospitalists are often involved in developing and managing aspects of hospital operations such as inpatient flow and quality assurance. The formation of hospitalist training tracks in residency programs has been driven in part by the need to educate future hospitalists about business and operational aspects of medicine, as these topics are not covered in traditional residencies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Certification==
As a relatively new specialty, only recently has certification for specialty experience and training for hospital medicine been offered.  The [[American Board of Hospital Medicine]] (ABHM), a Member Board of the [[American Board of Physician Specialties]] (ABPS), was founded in 2009. The ABHM was North America’s first board of certification devoted exclusively to hospital medicine.  In September 2009, the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] (ABIM) created a program that provides general internists practicing in hospital settings the opportunity to maintain Internal Medicine Certification with a Focused Practice in Hospital Medicine (FPHM).

==Quality initiatives==
Research shows that hospitalists reduce the length of stay, treatment costs and improve the overall efficiency of care for hospitalized patients. Hospitalists are leaders on several quality improvement initiatives in key areas including transitions of care, co-management of patients, reducing hospital acquired diseases and optimizing the care of patients.

==Employment==
The number of available hospitalists positions grew exponentially from 2006 to 2010 but has since then leveled off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=hospitalist&l |title=hospitalist Job Trends |publisher=Indeed.com |date=2004-10-24 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> However, the job market still remained very active with some hospitals maintaining permanent openings for capable hospitalists. Salaries are generally very competitive, averaging almost $230,000 per year for adult hospitalists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayshospitalist.com/index.php?b=articles_read&cnt=1380 |title=Today's Hospitalist :: Hospitalist pay is rising - survey results show pressure for productivity growth to match |publisher=Todayshospitalist.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> Hospitalists who are willing to work night shifts only ([[nocturnist]]) are compensated higher than their day shift peers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalistworking.com/hospitalist.html |title=Hospitalist Jobs &#124; Hospitalist Positions from |publisher=HospitalistWorking.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>
