In the [[nervous system]], '''afferent neurons''' (otherwise known as [[sensory neuron|sensory]], receptor [[neuron]]s, and afferent axons<ref name="carlson">{{Cite isbn|9780205239399|noedit}}</ref>), carry [[action potential|nerve impulses]] from [[Sensory receptor|receptor]]s or sense organs ''towards'' the [[central nervous system]]. This term can also be used to describe relative connections between structures. Afferent neurons communicate with specialized [[interneuron]]s. The opposite activity of direction or flow is '''[[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]]'''.

In the nervous system there is a "closed loop" system of sensation, decision, and reactions. This process is carried out through the activity of afferent neurons, interneurons, and efferent neurons.

A touch or [[pain]]ful [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], for example, creates a sensation in the brain only after information about the stimulus travels there via afferent nerve pathways. Afferent neurons are [[pseudounipolar neurons]], that have a single long [[dendrite]] and a short [[axon]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, and a smooth and rounded cell [[soma (biology)|body]]. The dendrite is structurally and functionally similar to an axon, and is [[myelin]]ated; it is these axon-like dendrites that make up the afferent nerves. Just outside the [[spinal cord]], thousands of afferent neuronal cell bodies are aggregated in a swelling in the [[dorsal root]] known as the [[dorsal root ganglion]].<ref name="carlson"/>

Afferent neurons Somas are located in the peripheral nervous system and the axons of these cells travel from ganglion to ganglion and lead back to the spinal cord. The majority of these are [[unipolar neuron]]s in that they have a single axon leaving the cell body and is sent towards the sensory organ.<ref name="carlson"/> All of the axons in the dorsal root, which contains afferent nerve fibers, are used in the transduction of somatosensory information.  Somatosensory receptors include senses such as pain, touch, temperature, itch, and stretch.  For example, a specific muscle fiber called an [[intrafusal muscle fiber]] is a type of afferent neuron that lies parallel to the [[extrafusal muscle fibers]] thus functions as a stretch receptor by detecting muscle length.<ref name="carlson"/> All of these sensations travel along the same general pathway towards the brain, from the dorsal root ganglion they travel to the spinal cord.<ref name="carlson"/> From the spinal cord to the medulla, which then leads to the medial lemniscus of the midbrain. From here it travels to the primary somatosensory cortex of the parietal lobe.

==Etymology and mnemonics==
Afferent is derived from [[Latin]] participle ''afferentem'' (''af- = ad-'' : to + ''ferre'' : bear, carry), meaning carrying into.
''Ad'' and ''ex'' give an easy [[mnemonic device]] for remembering the relationship between ''afferent'' and ''efferent'' : '''''a'''fferent connection '''a'''rrives'' and an '''''e'''fferent connection '''e'''xits''.<ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|3502|3463|367|115}}</ref> 

Another mnemonic device used for remembering afferent and efferent (in terms of the spinal cord, with its dorsal/ventral organization) is SAME DAVE. Sensory Afferent Motor Efferent, Dorsal Afferent Ventral Efferent.

Afferent and efferent are connected to affect and effect through their common Latin roots: afferent nerves affect the subject while efferent nerves allow the subject to effect change.
