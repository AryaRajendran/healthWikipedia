'''Tonsilloliths''', also known as '''tonsil stones''' or '''tonsilar calculi''' (singular: calculus), are clusters of [[calcified]] material that form in the [[Palatine tonsils#Tonsillar crypts|crevices]] of the [[tonsils]]<ref name=Ram04/> ([[tonsillar crypts]].) While they occur most commonly in the [[palatine tonsils]], they may also occur in the [[lingual tonsils]].<ref name=Ram04/>  Tonsilloliths have been recorded weighing from 300&nbsp;mg to 42 g.<ref name=Ram04/> They are composed mostly of [[calcium]], but may contain other minerals such as [[phosphorus]] and [[magnesium]], as well as [[ammonia]] and [[carbonate]].<ref name=Ram04/>

Protruding tonsilloliths may feel like foreign objects lodged in the [[Tonsillar crypts|tonsil crypt]]. They may be a nuisance and difficult to remove, but are usually not harmful. They are one of the causes of [[halitosis]] (bad breath).<ref name="pmid16859950">{{cite journal |author=Tsuneishi M, Yamamoto T, Kokeguchi S, Tamaki N, Fukui K, Watanabe T |title=Composition of the bacterial flora in tonsilloliths |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=8 |issue=9–10 |pages=2384–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16859950 |doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2006.04.023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/health/01tons.html | work=The New York Times | title=In Tonsils, a Problem the Size of a Pea | first=Elizabeth | last=Svoboda | date=2009-09-01 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>

While true tonsillar stones are rare, small areas of calcification or concretions are relatively common.<ref name=Ram04/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Tonsilloliths may produce no symptoms, be associated with [[bad breath]], or may produce pain when swallowing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giudice M, Cristofaro MG, Fava MG, Giudice A |title=An unusual tonsillolithiasis in a patient with chronic obstructive sialoadenitis |journal=Dentomaxillofac Radiol |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=247–50 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15961601 |doi=10.1259/dmfr/19689789 |url=}}</ref>

Tonsilloliths occur more frequently in adults than in children. Many small tonsil stones do not cause any noticeable symptoms. Even when they are large, some tonsil stones are only discovered incidentally on X-rays or [[X-ray computed tomography|CAT scans]].

Other symptoms include a metallic taste, throat closing or tightening, coughing fits, and choking.

Larger tonsilloliths may cause multiple symptoms, including recurrent [[halitosis]], which frequently accompanies a tonsil infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste in the back of the throat, difficulty swallowing, [[otalgia|ear ache]], and tonsil swelling.<ref name="WebMD" /> A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and bad breath in patients with a certain type of recurrent tonsillitis. Among those with bad breath, 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist in the back of throat. The condition may also be an [[asymptomatic condition]], with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or [[submucosal]] mass.

==Causes==

The exact cause of tonsillar stones is not known.<ref name=Ram04/>

==Classification==
Tonsilloliths or tonsil stones are [[calcification]]s that form in the crypts of the palatal tonsils. They are also known to form in the throat and on the roof of the mouth. Tonsils are filled with crevices where bacteria and other materials, including dead cells and mucus, can become trapped. When this occurs, the debris can become concentrated in white formations that occur in the pockets.<ref name="WebMD">[http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/tonsil-stones-tonsilloliths-treatment-and-prevention Tonsil Stones - WebMD.com]</ref>
Tonsilloliths are formed when this trapped debris combines and hardens, or calcifies. This tends to occur most often in people who suffer from chronic inflammation in their tonsils or repeated bouts of tonsillitis.<ref name="WebMD" /> They are often associated with [[post-nasal drip]]. These [[Calculus (medicine)|calculi]] are composed of calcium salts such as [[hydroxyapatite]] or calcium carbonate apatite, [[oxalate]]s and other [[magnesium]] salts or containing ammonium radicals, macroscopically appear white or yellowish in color, and are usually of small size - though there have been occasional reports of large tonsilloliths or calculi in peritonsillar locations. Many people have small tonsilloliths that develop in their tonsils, and it is quite rare to have a large and solidified tonsil stone.

===Giant===
Much rarer than the typical tonsil stones are giant tonsilloliths. Giant tonsilloliths may often be mistaken for other oral maladies, including [[peritonsillar abscess]], and tumours of the tonsil.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Padmanabhan TK, Chandra Dutt GS, Vasudevan DM, Vijayakumar | title=Giant tonsillolith simulating tumour of the tonsil – a case report | journal=Indian J Cancer | month=May-Jun | year=1984  | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=90–1 | pmid=6530236}}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Gray1027.png|thumb|Low-power microscope magnification of a cross-section through one of the tonsillar crypts (running diagonally) as it opens onto the surface of the throat (at the top). Stratified [[epithelium]] (e) covers the throat's surface and continues as a lining of the crypt. Beneath the surface are numerous nodules (f) of [[lymphoid]] tissue. Many lymph cells (dark-colored region) pass from the nodules toward the surface and will eventually mix with the [[saliva]] as salivary corpuscles (s).]]
The mechanism by which these calculi form is subject to debate,<ref name=Ram04/> though they appear to result from the accumulation of material retained within the crypts, along with the growth of bacteria and fungi – sometimes in association with persistent chronic purulent [[tonsillitis]].

Recently, an association between [[biofilms]] and tonsilloliths was shown. Central to the biofilm concept is the assumption that bacteria form a three dimensional structure; dormant bacteria being in the center to serve as a constant nidus of infection. This impermeable structure renders the biofilm immune to antibiotic treatment. By use of [[confocal microscopy]] and microelectrodes, biofilms similar to dental biofilms were shown to be present in the tonsillolith, with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, [[denitrification]] toward the middle, and acidification toward the bottom.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19716006 Tonsillolith: not just a stone but a living biofilm.]</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually made upon inspection. [[Differential diagnosis]] of tonsilloliths includes foreign body, calcified [[granuloma]], [[malignancy]], an enlarged [[styloid]] process or rarely, isolated bone which is usually derived from [[embryonic rest]]s originating from the [[branchial arch]]es.<ref>[http://www.ijri.org/getarticleimages.asp?a=IndianJRadiolImaging_2001_11_1_31_28307 Images]</ref>

Tonsilloliths are difficult to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] in the absence of clear manifestations, and often constitute casual findings of routine [[radiological]] studies.

Imaging diagnostic techniques can identify a [[radiodensity|radiopaque]] mass that may be mistaken for foreign bodies, displaced teeth or calcified blood vessels. Computed [[tomography]] (CT) may reveal nonspecific calcified images in the tonsillar zone. The differential diagnosis must be established with acute and chronic tonsillitis, tonsillar [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]], peritonsillar abscesses, foreign bodies, [[Phlebolith|phlebolite]]s, ectopic bone or cartilage, [[lymph nodes]], granulomatous lesions or calcification of the [[stylohyoid ligament]] in the context of [[Eagle syndrome]] (elongated styloid process).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silvestre-Donat F, Pla-Mocholi A, Estelles-Ferriol E, Martinez-Mihi V |title=Giant tonsillolith: report of a case |journal=Medicina oral, patología oral y cirugía bucal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=239–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15876967 | url=http://www.medicinaoral.com/medoralfree01/v10i3/medoralv10i3p239.pdf | format=PDF}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Often, no treatment is needed, as few stones produce symptoms.<ref name="WebMD" />

===Irrigation===
A simple yet effective method to remove tonsil stones and thoroughly clean the tonsil crypts is to use an [[oral irrigator]]. Most electric oral irrigators are unsuitable for tonsil stone removal because they are too powerful and are likely to cause discomfort and rupture the tonsils, which could result in further complications such as infection. Irrigators that connect directly to the sink tap via a threaded attachment or otherwise are suitable for tonsil stone removal and everyday washing of the tonsils because they can jet water at arbitrarily low pressure levels that the user can adjust by simply turning the sink tap, allowing for a continuous range of pressures to suit each user's specific requirements.<ref name="WebMD" />

More simply still, gargling with warm, salty water may help alleviate the discomfort of tonsillitis, which often accompanies tonsil stones. Vigorous gargling each morning can also keep the tonsil crypts clear of all but the most persistent tonsilloliths.<ref name="WebMD" />

===Curettage===
Larger tonsil stones may require removal by [[curettage]] or otherwise, although thorough irrigation will still be required afterwards to effectively wash out smaller pieces. Larger [[lesion]]s may require local [[surgery|excision]] although these treatments may not completely help the bad breath issues that are often associated with this condition.

===Laser===
Another option is to decrease the surface area (crypts, crevices, etc.) of the tonsils via laser resurfacing.  The procedure is called laser [[cryptolysis]].  It can be performed using a [[Local anesthesia|local anesthetic]].  A scanned [[carbon dioxide laser]] selectively vaporizes and smooths the surface of the tonsils.  This technique flattens the edges of the crypts and crevices that collect the debris, preventing trapped material from forming stones.

===Surgery===
[[Tonsillectomy]] may be indicated if bad breath due to tonsillar stones persists despite other measures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Darrow DH, Siemens C |title=Indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=112 |issue=8 Pt 2 Suppl 100 |pages=6–10 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12172229 |doi=10.1002/lary.5541121404 |url=}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Tonsilloliths or tonsillar concretions occur in up to 10% of the population, frequently due to episodes of tonsillitis.<ref>{{cite book |author=S. G.
