'''Sydenham's chorea''' or '''chorea minor''' (historically referred to as '''Saint [[Vitus]] Dance''')<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/sydenham/sydenham.htm NINDS Sydenham Chorea Information Page] Saint Vitus Dance, Rheumatic Encephalitis from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Accessed April 26, 2008</ref> is a disease characterized by rapid, uncoordinated jerking movements affecting primarily the face, feet and hands. Sydenham's chorea (SC) results from childhood infection with Group A beta-hemolytic [[Streptococcus]]<ref>[http://www.wemove.org/syd/syd_sym.html Sydenham's chorea:] Symptoms/Findings from WeMOVE.Org Accessed April 26, 2008</ref> and is reported to occur in 20-30% of patients with [[rheumatic fever|acute rheumatic fever]] (ARF). The disease is usually latent, occurring up to 6 months after the acute infection, but may occasionally be the presenting symptom of [[rheumatic fever]]. Sydenham's Chorea is more common in females than males and most patients are children, below 18 years of age. Adult onset of Sydenham's Chorea is comparatively rare and most of the adult cases are associated with exacerbation of [[chorea (disease)|chorea]] following childhood Sydenham's Chorea.

==Presentation==
Sydenham's chorea is characterised by the acute onset (sometimes a few hours) of neurologic symptoms, classically [[chorea]], usually affecting all limbs. Other neurologic symptoms include behavior change, [[dysarthria]], gait disturbance, loss of fine and gross motor control with resultant deterioration of handwriting, [[headache]], slowed cognition, facial grimacing, fidgetiness and [[hypotonia]].<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Chan/> Also, there may be tongue fasciculations ("bag of worms"), and a "milk sign", which is a relapsing grip demonstrated by alternate increases and decreases in tension, as if [[hand milking]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/891897-clinical#a0217 Medscape > Pediatric Rheumatic Heart Disease Clinical Presentation > Noncardiac manifestations]. Author: Thomas K Chin, MD; Chief Editor: Stuart Berger, MD. Updated: Aug 4, 2010</ref>

Non-neurologic manifestations of acute rheumatic fever are [[carditis]], [[arthritis]], [[erythema marginatum]], and [[subcutaneous nodules]].<ref name=Chun/> 

The [[PANDAS]] (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated With Streptococcal Infections) syndrome is similar, but is not characterized by Sydenham's motor dysfunction, but presenting with tics and/or with psychological components (OCD) and much sooner, days to week after GABHS infection rather than 6–9 months.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Swedo SE, Leonard HL, Garvey M, ''et al'' |title=Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections: clinical description of the first 50 cases |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=264–71 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9464208 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9464208}}</ref> It may be confused with other conditions such as [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] and [[Tourette syndrome]].

Movements cease during sleep, and the disease usually resolves after several months. It is associated with post-[[streptococcus|streptococcal]] [[rheumatic fever]], [[pregnancy]], [[hyperthyroidism]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]].
==History==
Sydenham’s chorea became a well defined nosological entity only during the second half of the nineteenth century. Such progress was promoted by the availability of large clinical series provided by newly founded paediatric hospitals. A 2005 study examined the demographic and clinical features of patients with chorea admitted to the first British paediatric hospital (the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London]]) (GOS) between 1852 and 1936. The seasonal and demographic characteristics of Sydenham’s chorea during this time appear strikingly similar to those observed today, and witness the introduction of modern “statistically averaging” techniques in the approach to complex paediatric syndromes. [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street hospital]] case notes provide detailed descriptions of the “typical cases” of SC, and show that British physicians working in the early age of paediatric hospitals succeeded in recognising the most distinctive clinical features of this fascinating condition.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author=D Martino,A Tanner,G Defazio,A J Church,K P Bhatia,G Giovannoni,R C Dale|title=Tracing Sydenham''’''s chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease In Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507-511 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=|doi= |url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full}}</ref>

Throughout the nineteenth century the term “[[chorea|chorea]]” referred to an ill-defined spectrum of [[Hyperkinesia| hyperkinesias]], including those recognised today as [[chorea|chorea]], [[tic|tics]], [[dystonia|dystonia]], or [[myoclonus|myoclonus]]. [[William Osler|William Osler]] started his [[monography|monography]] on chorea1 stating that “in the whole range of medical terminology there is no such [[olla podrida|olla podrida]] as Chorea, which for a century has served as a sort of nosological pot into which authors have cast indiscriminately affections characterised by irregular, purposeless movements”.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author=D Martino,A Tanner,G Defazio,A J Church,K P Bhatia,G Giovannoni,R C Dale|title=Tracing Sydenham''’''s chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease In Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507-511 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=|doi= |url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full}}</ref>

Sydenham’s chorea (SC), a frequent cause of paediatric acute chorea, is a major manifestation of rheumatic fever (RF) The association of chorea with rheumatism was first reported in 1802,3 and confirmed in the following decades by several French and English authors.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author=D Martino,A Tanner,G Defazio,A J Church,K P Bhatia,G Giovannoni,R C Dale|title=Tracing Sydenham''’''s chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease In Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507-511 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=|doi= |url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full}}</ref> The inclusion of chorea under the rheumatic umbrella helped discriminate SC from other “choreic” syndromes.

Physicians working in early children’s hospitals recognised new clinical syndromes through the definition of “typical clinical cases”. Complex multi-systemic diseases, such as RF, were categorised only after the observation of large, hospital based series. Therefore, paediatric hospitals gradually became an important setting for the application of a modern “statistical averaging” technique to paediatric syndromes. Historical authorities in paediatrics, such as [[Walter Butler Cheadle|Walter Butler Cheadle]] and [[Octavius Sturges|Octavius Sturges]], worked at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London (the first British paediatric hospital), and their clinical notes help to understand how the typical case of SC was defined.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author=D Martino,A Tanner,G Defazio,A J Church,K P Bhatia,G Giovannoni,R C Dale|title=Tracing Sydenham''’''s chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease In Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507-511 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=|doi= |url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full}}</ref>

Between 1860 and 1900 the proportion of choreic patients ranged between 5% and 7% of the total number of patients admitted (mean per year, 1003), whereas from 1900 to 1936 it was constantly below 4% (mean per year). Chorea was the fourth most frequent cause of admission between 1860 and 1900, and in the 1880s temporarily became the second most frequent diagnosis among inpatients. Contemporary articles report a homogeneous distribution of paediatric chorea all over [[United Kingdom|England]] However, since many choreic children were “cured” at home, the hospital based rates probably underestimate the incidence of chorea in the general paediatric population.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author=D Martino,A Tanner,G Defazio,A J Church,K P Bhatia,G Giovannoni,R C Dale|title=Tracing Sydenham''’''s chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease In Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507-511 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=|doi= |url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full}}</ref>

A higher number of cases were admitted during the colder months, consistent with the reference epidemiological report on chorea at the end of the century. In the 1950s and 1960s the highest frequency of chorea was recorded during the winter months in several Northern and Central European countries. Interestingly, the incidence of rheumatism among GOS inpatients peaked in October, preceding chorea by approximately two months. This is consistent with the current knowledge that most of the RF symptoms appear about 10 days after the streptococcal infection, whereas SC occurs typically 2–3 months after infection.

More than 80% of choreic patients were aged between 7 and 11 years (mean 9.2). Due to a referral bias, this age may be falsely low. Indeed, the British Medical Association (1887) reported the peak age between 11 and 15 years. In the present series, the female:male ratio was 2.7, in accordance with the general choreic population of Britain towards the end of the 1800s. Interestingly, in children below age 7, the female preponderance is less manifest. This was observed also by [[Charles West (physician)|Charles West]] (founder physician of GOS), and subsequently by Osler, who stated that “the second hemi-decade contains the greatest number of cases in males, and the third the greatest number in females”. In the majority of the 20th century studies, female preponderance is evident only in children over 10 years of age. These observations suggest a role for [[Estrogen|oestrogen]] in SC expression. Supporting this view, oral [[contraceptives|contraceptives]] and pregnancy can cause relapses of disease.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author=D Martino,A Tanner,G Defazio,A J Church,K P Bhatia,G Giovannoni,R C Dale|title=Tracing Sydenham''’''s chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease In Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507-511 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=|doi= |url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full}}</ref>

Ten per cent(10%) of the 1548 patients whose records were researched for the British study, were subsequently admitted with a relapse of chorea. Given that relapse admissions had a negative impact on the hospital cure rate, this rate might underestimate the actual relapse incidence in the general population of patients.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author=D Martino,A Tanner,G Defazio,A J Church,K P Bhatia,G Giovannoni,R C Dale|title=Tracing Sydenham''’''s chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease In Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507-511 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=|doi= |url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Fifty percent of patients with acute Sydenham's Chorea spontaneously recover after 2 to 6 months whilst mild or moderate chorea or other motor symptoms can persist for up to and over 2 years in some cases (for example a patient in the UK who has suffered the illness since 1999){{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. Sydenham's is also associated with psychiatric symptoms with [[OCD|obsessive compulsive disorder]] being the most frequent manifestation. 

==Causes==
A major manifestation of acute rheumatic fever, Sydenham's chorea is a result of an autoimmune response that occurs following infection by group A β-hemolytic streptococci<ref name=Chen>[http://www.wemove.org/syd/syd_sym.html Sydenham's Chorea Symptoms].Accessed September 24, 2009.</ref> that destroys cells in the [[corpus striatum]] of the [[basal ganglia]].<ref name=Chan>Swedo SE,Leonard HL, Shapiro MB.

==Treatment and management==
Treatment of Sydenham's Chorea is based on the following three principles:
# The first tenet of treatment is to eliminate the streptococcus at a primary, secondary and tertiary level. Strategies involve the adequate treatment of throat and skin infections, with a 10-day course of [[penicillin]] when Sydenham's Chorea is newly diagnosed, followed by long-term penicillin prophylaxis. Behavioural and emotional changes may precede the movement disorders in a previously well child.
# Treatment of movement disorders. Therapeutic efforts are limited to palliation of the movement disorders. [[Haloperidol]] is frequently used because of its anti-dopaminergic effect. It has serious potential side-effects, e.g. [[tardive dyskinesia]]. In a study conducted at the RFC, 25 out of 39 patients on haloperidol reported side-effects severe enough to cause the physician or parent to discontinue treatment or reduce the dose. Other medications which have been used to control the movements include [[pimozide]], [[clonidine]], [[valproic acid]], [[carbamazepine]] and [[phenobarbitone]].
# Immunomodulatory interventions include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and plasma exchange. Patients may benefit from treatment with steroids; controlled clinical trials are indicated to explore this further.

==Etymology==
It is named after British physician [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624–1689).<ref name="ReferenceA">Walker K, Lawrenson J, Wilmshurst JM.

Saint Vitus is considered to be the patron saint of dancers, with the eponym given as homage to the manic dancing that historically took place in front of his statue during the feast of Saint Vitus in Germanic and Latvian cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-vitus/ |title=St. Vitus Information Page - Star Quest Production Network |publisher=Saints.sqpn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>
