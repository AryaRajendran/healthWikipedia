In [[human anatomy]], the '''carotid sinus''' is a dilated area in the bifurcation of the [[common carotid]] at the level of the superior border of [[thyroid cartilage]]. The carotid sinus is sensitive to pressure changes in the arterial blood at this level.

==Functions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}
The carotid sinus contains numerous [[baroreceptors]] which function as a "sampling area" for many [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms for maintaining [[blood pressure]].  The carotid sinus baroreceptors are innervated by the sinus nerve of Hering, which is a branch of [[cranial nerve]] IX ([[glossopharyngeal nerve]]).   The glossopharyngeal nerve synapses in the [[Solitary nucleus|nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)]] located in the medulla of the brainstem.  The NTS indirectly modulates the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) neurons in the medulla and pons through the hypothalamus.  These neurons then regulate the autonomic control of the heart and blood vessels. The [[aortic arch]] baroreceptors are innervated by the aortic nerve (Nerve of Cyon), which combines with CN X ([[vagus nerve]]) and travels to the NTS.

==Disease of the carotid sinus==<!-- This section is linked from [[Swimming]] -->
The carotid sinus often has [[atherosclerotic plaque]]s because of disturbed [[hemodynamics]] (low [[wall shear stress]], flow reversal/recirculation).<ref>Glagov S, Zarins C, Giddens DP, Ku DN. Hemodynamics and atherosclerosis. Insights and perspectives gained from studies of human arteries. biod degradable Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1988 Oct;112(10):1018-31. PMID 3052352</ref>  Since these plaques, if large and unstable, predispose to [[Stroke#Ischemic stroke 2|ischemic stroke]]s and [[transient ischemic attack]]s, [[carotid endarterectomy|carotid endarterectomies]] are frequently done for [[prophylaxis]].

The carotid sinus can be oversensitive to manual stimulation, a condition known as '''carotid sinus hypersensitivity''', '''carotid sinus syndrome''' or '''carotid sinus syncope''', in which manual stimulation causes large changes in [[heart rate]] and/or [[blood pressure]]. This classically presents as a patient who has "fainted" on several occasions while shaving, or in some other way coming into contact with their carotid sinus.

Carotid sinus syndrome is a temporary loss of consciousness that sometimes accompanies convulsive seizures because of the intensity of the carotid sinus reflex when pressure builds in one or both carotid sinuses.

==Carotid sinus massage==
[[Massage]] of the carotid sinus, '''carotid sinus massage''' is used to diagnose carotid sinus syncope and is sometimes useful for differentiating [[supraventricular tachycardia]] (SVT) from [[ventricular tachycardia]].  Like the [[valsalva maneuver]], it is a therapy for SVT.<ref>Lim SH, Anantharaman V, Teo WS, Goh PP, Tan AT. Comparison of treatment of supraventricular tachycardia by Valsalva maneuver and carotid sinus massage. Ann Emerg Med. 1998 Jan;31(1):30-5. {{DOI|10.1016/S0196-0644(98)70277-X}} PMID 9437338</ref> It is less effective than pharmaceutical management of SVT with [[verapamil]] or [[adenosine]]<ref>Ballo P, Bernabo D, Faraguti SA. Heart rate is a predictor of success in the treatment of adults with symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Eur Heart J. 2004 Aug;25(15):1310-7. {{DOI|10.1016/j.ehj.2004.05.011}} PMID 15288158</ref> though is still the preferred first-line of treatment in a hemodynamically stable patient<ref>American Heart Association.

==Carotid sinus reflex death==
'''Carotid sinus reflex death''' is a disputed mechanism of [[death]] in which manual stimulation of the carotid sinus allegedly causes strong glossopharyngeal nerve (Vagus nerve is for aortic arch baroreceptors) impulses leading to terminal [[cardiac arrest]]. Carotid sinus reflex death has been pointed out as a possible cause of death in cases of [[strangling|strangulation]], [[hanging]] and [[Erotic asphyxiation|Autoerotic Strangulation]], but such deductions remain controversial. Studies {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} have however suggested that the carotid sinus reflex can be a contributing factor in other mechanisms of death by reducing [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]], especially in the [[elderly]] or in people suffering from carotid sinus hypersensitivity. A carotid massage can also possibly dislodge a thrombus, or some plaque. This could lead to any number of life threatening effects, including [[stroke]].<ref>Passig, K.
