The '''MMR vaccine controversy''' centered around the 1998 publication of a fraudulent research paper in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' that lent support to the subsequently discredited theory that [[colitis]] and [[autism spectrum]] disorders could be caused by the [[MMR vaccine|combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine]].<ref name=Wakefield/> The media has been heavily criticised for its naive reporting and for lending undue credibility to the architect of the fraud, [[Andrew Wakefield]].

Investigations by ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' journalist [[Brian Deer]] revealed that Wakefield had multiple undeclared [[conflicts of interest]],<ref name=Deer04a/><ref name=Patent-and-test-results/> had manipulated evidence,<ref name=Deer2009/> and had broken other ethical codes. The ''Lancet'' paper was partially retracted in 2004 and fully retracted in 2010, and Wakefield was found guilty by the [[General Medical Council]] of serious professional misconduct in May 2010 and was struck off the [[General Medical Council#Registering doctors to practise in the UK|Medical Register]], meaning he could no longer practice as a doctor.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8695267.stm |title=MMR doctor struck off register |author=Nick Triggle |date=24 May 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref>  In 2011, Deer provided further information on Wakefield's improper research practices to the British medical journal, ''[[BMJ]]'', which in a signed editorial described the original paper as fraudulent.<ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ>{{cite journal |author=Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |title=Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=342 |issue= |pages=c7452 |year=2011 |pmid=21209060 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |doi = 10.1136/bmj.c7452}}</ref><ref name=DeerarticleBMJ>{{cite journal |author=Deer B |title=Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=342 |issue= |pages=c5347|year=2011 |pmid=21209059

While the Cochrane review expressed a need for improved design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, it concluded that the evidence of the safety and effectiveness of MMR in the prevention of diseases that still carry a heavy burden of [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] justifies its global use, and that the lack of confidence in the vaccine has damaged public health.<ref name=Cochrane/> A special court convened in the United States to review claims under the [[National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program]] rejected compensation claims from parents of autistic children.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/11/autism.vaccines/|title=Vaccine didn't cause autism, court rules|date=12 February 2009| publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref><ref name=Cedillo-v-HHS/>

==Background==
{{further2|[[MMR vaccine#Safety|MMR vaccine safety]]}}

===Concerns about the Urabe strain===
Before the autism-related controversy started in 1998, some concern had already arisen about the safety of the MMR vaccine due to side effects associated with the Urabe [[mumps]] strain, including rare adverse events of [[aseptic meningitis]], a transient mild form of viral meningitis.<ref name=Schattner>{{cite journal |journal=Vaccine |year=2005 |volume=23 |issue=30 |pages=3876–86 |title= Consequence or coincidence?

Concerns about adverse reactions to the vaccine were raised by American and Canadian authorities  based on reports from Japan linking Urabe MMR with [[meningoencephalitis]]. In early 1988, Canadian authorities suspended distribution of the Urabe-based MMR and eventually recalled the product.

The UK [[National Health Service]] introduced an MMR vaccine using the Urabe mumps strain in 1988, replacing it entirely with the Jeryl Lynn strain in September 1992 following the identification of an unacceptable risk of [[aseptic meningitis]] 15–35 days after vaccination.<ref name=pmid7483800>{{cite journal |author=Miller E, Hill A, Morgan-Capner P, Forsey T, Rush M |title=Antibodies to measles, mumps and rubella in UK children 4 years after vaccination with different MMR vaccines |journal=Vaccine |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=799–802 |year=1995 |month=June |pmid=7483800 |doi= 10.1016/0264-410X(94)00086-3|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0264410X94000863}}</ref> Decisions taken by British authorities at this time were to be criticized later following documents delivered by FOIA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foiacentre.com/news-MMR-files.html |title=FOIA Centre news archive: The MMR files |publisher=Foiacentre.com |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> With no such risk seen in vaccines using the [[Jeryl Lynn]] mumps strain,<ref name=pmid7483800/><ref name=Colville/> the UK NHS withdrew two of the three MMR vaccine then available (Immravax, made by [[Merieux UK]], and Pluserix, made by [[GlaxoSmithKline|SmithKline Beecham]]) in favor of [[Merck Sharp and Dohme]]'s MMR II brand, based on the Jeryl Lynn strain.<ref name=Colville>{{cite journal |journal= Eur J Pediatr |year=1994 |volume=153 |issue=6 |pages=467–8 |title=Withdrawal of a mumps vaccine |author= Colville A, Pugh S, Miller E, Schmitt HJ, Just M, Neiss A |pmid=8088305 |doi=10.1007/BF01983415}}</ref> Although MMR administration did continue with MMR II, the MMR vaccination rate first began to fall after 1996, following claims by Wakefield that it was linked to the [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[Crohn's disease]].<ref>{{cite news |title= MMR timeline |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jan/28/mmr-doctor-timeline  |accessdate=2010-10-28 |work=The Guardian |date=28 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the [[Jeryl Lynn]] strain,<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Int J Epidemiol |year=2002 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=983–4 |title= Commentary: Ongoing debate over the safety of the different mumps vaccine strains impacts mumps disease control |author= Fullerton KE, Reef SE |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/31/5/983 |pmid=12435772 |doi=10.1093/ije/31.5.983}}</ref> and a strain with higher [[efficacy]] along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events.<ref name=Colville/>

===Revaccination campaign===
In the wake of measles outbreaks which occurred in England in 1992, and on the basis of analyses of seroepidemiological data combined with mathematical modeling, British Health authorities predicted a major resurgence of measles in school age children. Two strategies were then examined: either to target vaccination at all children without a history of prior measles vaccination or to immunize all children irrespective of vaccination history.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0950268800058969 |author=Calvert N, Cutts F, Irving R, Brown D, Marsh J, Miller E |title=Measles immunity and response to revaccination among secondary school children in Cumbria |journal=Epidemiol.

=== MMR litigation starts ===
In April 1994, Richard Barr,<ref>[http://www.richardbarr.org/#/mmr/4511615194 Richard Barr]</ref> a solicitor, succeeded in winning legal aid for the pursuit of a class action against the manufacturers of MMR vaccines under the [[Consumer Protection Act 1987]]. The class action case was aimed at [[Aventis Pasteur]], [[SmithKlineBeecham]], and [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], manufacturers respectively of Immravax, Pluserix-MMR and MMR II.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Fitzpatrick |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/articles/00000006E019.htm |title=spiked-health &#124; Medicine on trial |publisher=Spiked-online.com |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> This suit, based on a claim that MMR is a defective product and should not have been used, was the first big class action lawsuit funded by the Legal Aid Board (now the [[Legal Services Commission]]) after its formation in 1988. Noticing two publications from Andrew Wakefield that explored the role of measles virus in [[Crohn's disease]] and [[inflammatory bowel disease]],<ref>"Evidence of Persistent Measles Virus in Crohn's Disease," [[Journal of Medical Virology]] 39 (1993),345-53</ref><ref>"Is Measles Vaccine a Risk for Inflammatory Bowel Disease?" [[The Lancet]] 345 (1995), 1071–74</ref> Barr contacted Wakefield for his expertise. According to Wakefield supporters, the two men first met on 6 January 1996.<ref>http://www.wesupportandywakefield.com/documents/AutismFile_US31_Wakefield.pdf</ref> The Legal Services Commission halted proceedings in September 2003, citing a high probability of failure based on the medical evidence, bringing an end to the first case of research funding by the LSC.<ref name="Fitz2004" />

==1998 ''Lancet'' paper==
In February 1998, a group led by [[Andrew Wakefield]] published a controversial paper in the respected British medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', supported by a press conference<ref name=EMBOreports/> at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in London.<ref name=LancetPR>[http://briandeer.com/mmr/royal-free-press-1998.pdf Press release from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine], 26 February 1998, hosted at briandeer.com</ref> This paper reported on twelve children with developmental disorders referred to the Royal Free Hospital. The parents or physicians of eight of these children were said to have linked the start of behavioral symptoms to MMR vaccination. The paper described a collection of bowel symptoms, [[endoscopy]] findings and [[biopsy]] findings that were said to be evidence of a possible novel syndrome that Wakefield would later call [[autistic enterocolitis]], and recommended further study into the possible link between the condition and the MMR vaccine. The paper suggested that the connection between autism and the [[gastrointestinal]] pathologies was real, but said it did not prove an association between the MMR vaccine and autism.<ref name=Wakefield>{{cite journal|author=[[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]], Murch S, Anthony A ''et al.''|title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet|volume=351|issue=9103|pages = 637–41|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0|pmid=9500320|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|accessdate= 2007-09-05}}{{Retracted paper|PMID 20137807|intentional=yes}}</ref>

The limited initial press coverage of the story was reasonable for a small and not very significant study.

===Wakefield ''Lancet paper'' controversy===
The controversy began to gain momentum in 2001 and 2002, after Wakefield published papers which suggested that the immunisation programme was not safe. These were a review paper with no new evidence, published in a minor journal, and two papers on laboratory work which he claimed showed that measles virus had been found in tissue samples taken from children who had autism and bowel problems. There was wide media coverage including distressing anecdotal evidence from parents, and political coverage attacking the health service and government peaked with unmet demands that Prime minister [[Tony Blair]] reveal whether his infant son, Leo, had been given the vaccine. It was the biggest science story of 2002, with 1257 articles mostly written by non-expert commentators. In the period January to September 2002, 32% of the stories written about MMR mentioned Leo Blair, as opposed to only 25% which mentioned Wakefield. Less than a third of the stories mentioned the overwhelming evidence that MMR is safe.<ref name=Goldacre-2008/> The paper, press conference and video sparked a major health scare in the United Kingdom. As a result of the scare, full confidence in MMR fell from 59% to 41% after publication of the Wakefield research. In 2001, 26% of family doctors felt the government had failed to prove there was no link between MMR and autism and bowel disease.<ref name="Halvorsen">{{cite book | author = Halvorsen R | title = The Truth about Vaccines | publisher = Gibson Square | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-903933-92-3}}</ref> In his book ''[[Bad Science (book)|Bad Science]]'',<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Goldacre |first=Ben |title= Bad Science|year=2009 |publisher=[[HarperCollins Music Entertainment|Fourth Estate]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-728487-0 |page= 283}}</ref> [[Ben Goldacre]] describes the MMR vaccine scare as one of the "three all-time classic bogus science stories" by the British newspapers (the other two are the Arpad [[Pusztai affair]] about genetically modified crops, and Chris Malyszewicz and the [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] hoax).

Confidence in the MMR vaccine increased as it became clearer that Wakefield's claims were unsupported by scientific evidence. A 2003 survey of 366 family doctors in the UK reported that 77% of them would advise giving the MMR vaccine to a child with a close family history of autism, and that 3% of them thought that autism could sometimes be caused by the MMR vaccine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/files/HPSurveyreport.pdf |accessdate=2007-09-06 |format=PDF |year=2003 |title= Health professionals 2003 childhood immunisation survey report |publisher= NHS Immunisation Information |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060929103639/http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/files/HPSurveyreport.pdf |archivedate = 29 September 2006}}</ref> A similar survey in 2004 found that these percentages changed to 82% and at most 2%, respectively, and that confidence in MMR had been increasing over the previous two years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/files/hp_survey_2004.pdf |accessdate=2007-09-06 |format=PDF |year=2004 |title= Health professionals 2004 childhood immunisation survey executive summary |publisher= Immunisation Information England |author= BMRB Social Research |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060929104358/http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/files/hp_survey_2004.pdf |archivedate = 29 September 2006}}</ref>

In 2001, Berelowitz, one of the co-authors of the paper, said "I am certainly not aware of any convincing evidence for the hypothesis of a link between MMR and autism".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/basics/truths.php |accessdate=2008-08-31 |year=2004 |title= MMR: myths and truths |publisher= NHS Immunisation Information}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> The [[Canadian Paediatric Society]],<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Paediatr Child Health |year=2007 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=393–5 |title= Autistic spectrum disorder: No causal relationship with vaccines |author= Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee, Canadian Paediatric Society |url=http://cps.ca/english/statements/ID/pidnote_jun07.htm |accessdate=2008-10-17}} Also published (2007) in ''Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol'' '''18''' (3): 177–9.

===Conflict of interest===
In February 2004, after a four-month investigation, reporter [[Brian Deer]] wrote in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' of London that, prior to submitting his paper to ''The Lancet'', Wakefield had received [[Pound sterling|£]]55,000 from [[Legal Services Commission|Legal Aid Board]] solicitors seeking evidence to use against vaccine manufacturers, that several of the parents quoted as saying that MMR had damaged their children were also litigants, and that Wakefield did not inform colleagues or medical authorities of the conflict of interest.  When the editors of ''The Lancet'' learned about this, they said that based on Deer's evidence, Wakefield's paper should have never been published because its findings were "entirely flawed."<ref name=Deer04a>''The Sunday Times'' 2004:

Deer continued his reporting in a [[Channel 4]] [[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]] television documentary, ''MMR: What They Didn't Tell You'', broadcast on 18 November 2004. This documentary alleged that Wakefield had applied for patents on a vaccine that was a rival of the MMR vaccine, and that he knew of test results from his own laboratory at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] that contradicted his claims.<ref name=Patent-and-test-results>2004 BBC documentary:

In January 2005, Wakefield sued Channel 4, 20/20 Productions, and the investigative reporter Brian Deer, who presented the Dispatches programme. However, after two years of litigation, and the revelation of more than £400,000 in undisclosed payments by lawyers to Wakefield, he discontinued his action and paid all the defendants' costs.

In 2006, Deer reported in ''The Sunday Times'' that Wakefield had been paid £435,643, plus expenses, by British trial lawyers attempting to prove that the vaccine was dangerous, with the undisclosed payments beginning two years before the ''Lancet'' paper's publication.<ref>{{cite news |author= Deer B |title= MMR doctor given legal aid thousands |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/newspapers/sunday_times/britain/article1265373.ece |accessdate=2007-09-23 |work=The Sunday Times |date=31 December 2006 | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> This funding came from the UK legal aid fund, a fund intended to provide legal services to the poor.<ref name=Deer-so-far/>

===Retraction of an interpretation===
''The Lancet'' and many other medical journals require papers to include the authors' conclusions about their research, known as the "interpretation". The summary of the 1998 ''Lancet'' paper ended as follows:

<blockquote>
'''Interpretation''' We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.<ref name=Wakefield/>
</blockquote>

In March 2004, immediately following the news of the conflict of interest allegations, ten of Wakefield's 12 coauthors retracted this interpretation,<ref name=retraction>{{cite journal |author=Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH ''et al.'' |title= Retraction of an interpretation |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |page=750 |year=2004 |pmid=15016483 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2}}</ref> while insisting that the possibility of a distinctive gastrointestinal condition in children with autism merited further investigation.<ref name="Fitz2004">{{cite book | last1 = Fitzpatrick | first1 = Michael | title = MMR and Autism: What Parents Need to Know | publisher = Routledge | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2011-02-02 | isbn = 978-0-415-32179-2}}</ref> However, a separate study of children with gastrointestinal disturbances found no difference between those with [[Autism spectrum|ASD]] and those without, with respect to the presence of measles virus [[RNA]] in the bowel; it also found that gastrointestinal symptoms and the onset of autism were unrelated in time to the administration of MMR vaccine.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= PLoS ONE |year=2008 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e3140 |title= Lack of association between measles virus vaccine and autism with enteropathy: a case-control study |editor1-first= Mark R. |editor1-last= Cookson |author= Hornig M, Briese T, Buie T ''et al.'' |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003140 |pmid=18769550 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003140 |laysummary=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/03/AR2008090303396.html |laysource= Washington Post |laydate=2008-09-04 |pmc= 2526159}}</ref>

===Manipulation of data===
On 8 February 2009, Brian Deer reported in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that Wakefield had "fixed" results and "manipulated" patient data in his 1998 paper, creating the appearance of a link with autism.<ref name=Deer2009>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/news/article148992.ece |title= MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism |author= Deer B |work=The Sunday Times |date=8 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-09 | location=London}}</ref> Wakefield denied these allegations,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Pediatrics/Autism/12850 |title= Father of vaccine–autism link said to have fudged data |author= Gever J | work= MedPage Today |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-11}}</ref> and even filed a complaint with the [[Press Complaints Commission]] (PCC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.box.net/shared/9cz9sntkzy |title=Complaint to UK |publisher=Box.net |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> over this article on 13 March 2009.

The [[General Medical Council]] (GMC), which is responsible for licensing doctors and supervising medical ethics in the UK, investigated the affair.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article565188.ece |title=MMR scare doctor faces list of charges |work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=2008-07-10 |date=11 September 2005 | location=London | first=Brian | last=Deer}}</ref> The GMC brought the case itself, not citing any specific complaints, claiming that an investigation was in the public interest.

On 5 January 2011, the ''BMJ'' published the first of a series of articles by Brian Deer, detailing how Wakefield and his colleagues had faked some of the data behind the 1998 Lancet article.

A March 2007 paper in ''[[BMC Public Health]]'' by Shona Hilton, Mark Petticrew, and Kate Hunt postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had "created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against".<ref name=hilton>Hilton, Shona, Mark Petticrew, and Kate Hunt, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1851707/ "Parents' champions vs. vested interests: Who do parents believe about MMR?

A 2007 editorial in ''Australian Doctor'' complained that some journalists had continued to defend Wakefield's study even after ''Lancet'' had published the retraction by 10 of the study's 12 original authors, but noted that it was an investigative journalist, Brian Deer, who had played a leading role in exposing weaknesses in the study.<ref name=Katelaris>Katelaris, Annette, [http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/bf/0c04f2bf.asp "Wakefield saga a study in integrity"]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}, ''Australian Doctor'', 17 August 2007: p20.</ref> ''[[PRWeek]]'' noted that after Wakefield was removed from the general medical register for misconduct in May 2010, 62% of respondents to a poll regarding the MMR controversy stated they did not feel that the media conducted responsible reporting on health issues.<ref name=PRWeek>[http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1007378/Reputation-survey-MMR-panic-subsides "Reputation Survey: MMR panic subsides."] ''[[PR Week]]'', 2 June 2010: 24.</ref>

A ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' article examining the history of antivaccinationists said that opposition to vaccines has existed since the 19th century, but "now the antivaccinationists' media of choice are typically television and the Internet, including its social media outlets, which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence".<ref name=AgeOld>{{cite journal |author= Poland GA, Jacobson RM |title= The Age-Old Struggle against the Antivaccinationists |journal= N Engl J Med |volume= 364 |issue= 2 |pages= 97–9 |date= 13 January 2011 |pmid= 21226573 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMp1010594}}</ref> The editorial characterized anti-vaccionationists as people who "tend toward complete mistrust of government and manufacturers, conspiratorial thinking, denialism, low cognitive complexity in thinking patterns, reasoning flaws, and a habit of substituting emotional anecdotes for data", including people who range from those "unable to understand and incorporate concepts of risk and probability into science-grounded decision making" and those "who use deliberate mistruths, intimidation, falsified data, and threats of violence".<ref name=AgeOld/>

In a January 2011 editorial in ''[[The American Spectator]]'', Robert M. Goldberg contended that evidence from the scientific community of issues with Wakefield's research " ... were undermined because the media allowed Wakefield and his followers to discredit the findings just by saying so".<ref>Goldberg, Robert M., "[http://spectator.org/archives/2011/01/07/andrew-wakefields-lethal-legac Andrew Wakefield's Lethal Legacy]", ''[[The American Spectator]]'', 7 January 2011. Retrieved 11 January 2011.</ref>

[[Fiona Godlee]], editor of the ''BMJ'' said in January 2011:

: "The original paper has received so much media attention, with such potential to damage public health, that it is hard to find a parallel in the history of medical science. Many other medical frauds have been exposed but usually more quickly after publication and on less important health issues."<ref name=GodleeEditorial />

Concerns have also been raised over the journal peer-review system, which largely relies on trust among researchers,<ref name=BMJLiftsCurtain /> and the role of journalists reporting on scientific theories that they "are hardly in a position to question and comprehend".<ref name=IBTimes/> Neil Cameron, a historian who specializes in the history of science, writing for The ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'' labeled the controversy a "failure of journalism" that resulted in unnecessary deaths, saying that 1) ''The Lancet'' should not have published a study based on "statistically meaningless results" from only 12 cases; 2) the anti-vaccination crusade was continued by the satirical ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' magazine; and 3) a grapevine of worried parents and "nincompoop" celebrities fueled the widespread fears.<ref name=FailureJournalism>{{cite news |url= http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/Autism+study+represents+failure+journalism/4095111/story.html |title= Autism 'study' represents a failure of journalism | author= Cameron, Neil |date= 12 January 2011 |work = The Montreal Gazette |accessdate= 2011-01-12}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>  The ''Gazette'' also reported that:
: "There is no guarantee that debunking the original study is going to sway all parents.

==Litigation==
Litigations are parts of the controversy in different ways. During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of lawsuits were brought in the United States against manufacturers of vaccines, alleging the vaccines had caused a variety of physical and [[mental illness|mental disorders]] in children. While these lawsuits were unsuccessful they did lead to a large jump in the costs of the MMR vaccine, and pharmaceutical companies sought legislative protections. In 1993, [[Merck KGaA]] became the only company willing to sell MMR vaccines in the United States and the United Kingdom.

===In the UK===
Commenced before the Civil Procedure Rules were promulgated, The MMR Litigation had its status as group litigation achieved by the then Lord Chief Justice’s practice direction of 8 July 1999. On 8 June 2007, the High Court judge, Justice Keith, put an end to the group litigation because the withdrawal of legal aid by the legal services commission had made the pursuit of most of the claimants impossible. He ruled that all but two claims against various pharmaceutical companies must be discontinued.<ref>http://briandeer.com/wakefield/keith-judgment.doc</ref> The judge stressed that his ruling did not amount to a rejection of any of the claims that MMR had seriously damaged the children concerned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foiacentre.com/news-MMR-070608.html |title=FOIA Centre news: MMR group legal claim collapses in high court |publisher=Foiacentre.com |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref>

A [[pressure group]] called JABS (Justice, Awareness, Basic Support) was established to represent families with children who, their parents said, were "vaccine-damaged". £15&nbsp;million in public legal aid funding was spent on the litigation, of which £9.7&nbsp;million went to solicitors and [[barrister]]s, and £4.3&nbsp;million to expert witnesses.<ref name=Fitzpatrick07>{{cite news |work=spiked |date=4 July 2007 |title= 'The MMR–autism theory? There's nothing in it' |author= Fitzpatrick M |url=http://spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/3562/ |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

Several British cases where parents claimed that their children had died as a result of Urabe MMR had received compensation under the "vaccine damage payment" scheme.<ref name="foiacentre.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.foiacentre.com/news-MMR-comment.html |title=comments on MMR vaccine |publisher=FOIA Centre |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref>

===In the United States===
The Omnibus Autism Proceeding (OAP)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/omnibus-autism-proceeding |title=Omnibus Autism Proceeding &#124; US Court of Federal Claims |publisher=Uscfc.uscourts.gov |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> is a coordinated proceeding before the Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims—commonly called the [[vaccine court]]. It is structured to facilitate the handling of nearly 5000 vaccine petitions involving claims that children who have received certain vaccinations have developed autism. The Petitioners' Steering Committee have claimed that MMR vaccines can cause autism, possibly in combination with [[thiomersal controversy|thiomersal-containing vaccines]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/pressrelease.autismproceedings.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-13 |date=7 May 2008 |title= The autism proceedings |publisher= [[U.S. Court of Federal Claims]]}}{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref> In 2007 three individual test cases were presented to test the claims about the combination; these test cases failed. The vaccine court ruled against the plaintiffs in all three cases, stating that the evidence presented did not validate their claims that vaccinations caused autism in these specific patients, or in general.<ref name=Cedillo-v-HHS>''[ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf Cedillo v. HHS]'' (PDF), U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Office of Special Masters, No. 98-916V (12 February 2009). Retrieved 2009-03-25.</ref>

In some cases, the plaintiffs' attorneys opted out of the Omnibus Autism Proceedings, which were concerned solely with autism, and also issues concerned with bowel disorders, and argue their cases in the regular vaccine court:

On 30 July 2007, the family of Bailey Banks, a child with pervasive developmental delay, won its case versus the Department of Health and Human Services.<ref>http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Abell.BANKS.02-0738V.pdf</ref> Special Master Richard Abell ruled that the Banks had successfully demonstrated that "the MMR vaccine at issue actually caused the conditions from which Bailey suffered and continues to suffer." In his conclusion, he ruled that he was satisfied that MMR had caused a brain inflammation called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).{{cn|date=October 2012}}

In other cases, attorneys also did not claim that vaccines caused autism, but sought compensation for encephalopathy, encephalitis, or seizure disorders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html |title=Robert F.

===Japan===
The Urabe strain, which was different from the strain used in UK,<ref name=whyjapan /> was introduced in 1989 and discontinued in 1993 due to causing a high incidence of [[aseptic meningitis]] and other low-level disorders, and it was replaced by the three different vaccines.<ref name=whyjapan /><ref name=naoko /> The problems were caused by the anti-mumps component.<ref name=andy /> The MMR scare caused a low percentage of mumps vaccination (less than 30%), which keeps causing outbreaks in Japan.<ref name=naoko>{{cite journal |journal= [[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]] |last1= Yoshida |title= Simple differentiation method of mumps Hoshino vaccine strain from wild strains by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)☆ |first1= N |last2= Fujino |first2= M |last3= Ota |first3= Y |last4= Notomi |first4= T |last5= Nakayama |first5= T |author8= Naoko Yoshidaa, Motoko Fujinoa, Yoshinori Otab, Tsugunori Notomib, Tetsuo Nakayama |volume= 25 |issue= 7 |pages= 1281–1286 |date= 26 January 2007 |pmid= 17097200 |doi= 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.09.093 }}</ref> Measles causes deaths in Japan while there are none in UK, but it's apparently due to Japan applying the vaccine at a later age; a spokesman for the Ministry of Health said that the discontinuation had no effect in measles, although also saying that there were more deaths by measles while MMR was being used.<ref name=whyjapan>{{Cite news |title= Why Japan stopped using MMR |work=BBC news |date= 8 February 2002 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1808316.stm |postscript= <!--None--> }}</ref> In 1994 the government dropped the vaccination requirement for measles and rubella due to the 1993 MMR scare.<ref>{{Cite news |work=Daily Mail |title= Why Japan banned MMR vaccine |author= Jenny Hope |date=undated |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-17509/Why-Japan-banned-MMR-vaccine.html |postscript= <!--None--> | location=London}}</ref><ref name=norrie />{{rp|2}} Japan is nowadays the only developed country with large measles epidemics, and it has been called a "measles exporter" by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<ref name=norrie>{{Cite news |title= Japanese measles epidemic brings campuses to standstill |work=The Sydney Morning Herald| author= Justin Norrie |date= 27 May 2007 |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/japanese-measles-epidemic-brings-campuses-to-standstill/2007/05/27/1180205052602.html |postscript= <!--None--> }}</ref> As another consequence of the scare, in 2003, 7 million schoolchildren had not been vaccinated against rubella.<ref name=kakuchi />

==Research==
The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices;<!-- ref name=Rutter/ --> it is not known how much, if any, growth came from real changes in autism's [[prevalence]], and no causal connection to the MMR vaccine has been demonstrated.<ref name=Rutter>{{cite journal |author=Rutter M |title= Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning |journal= Acta Paediatr |volume=94 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=2–15 |pmid=15858952 |doi= 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x |authorlink= Michael Rutter}}</ref> The following were published after the 1998 Wakefield ''et al.'' paper:

The authors concluded that although the vaccine is associated with positive and negative side effects, a connection between MMR and autism was "unlikely".

*In February 2005, a study compared autism in Japan before and after the 1993 withdrawal of the MMR vaccine: the autism rates continued to increase, which means that the withdrawal of MMR in other countries is unlikely to cause a reduction in future autism cases.<ref name=honda/>

After vaccination rates dropped, the incidence of two of the three diseases increased greatly in the UK. In 1998 there were 56 confirmed cases of measles in the UK; in 2006 there were 449 in the first five months of the year, with the first death since 1992; cases occurred in inadequately vaccinated children.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=BMJ |year=2006 |volume=333 |issue=7574 |pages=890–5 |title= Measles in the United Kingdom: can we eradicate it by 2010? |author= Asaria P, MacMahon E |doi=10.1136/bmj.38989.445845.7C |pmid=17068034 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7574/890 |pmc=1626346}}</ref> Mumps cases began rising in 1999 after years of very few cases, and by 2005 the United Kingdom was in a mumps epidemic with almost 5000 notifications in the first month of 2005 alone.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=BMJ |year=2005 |volume=330 |issue=7500 |pages=1132–5 |title=Mumps and the UK epidemic 2005 |author= Gupta RK, Best J, MacMahon E |pmid=15891229 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7500.1132 |pmc=557899}}</ref> The age group affected was too old to have received the routine MMR immunisations around the time the paper by Wakefield ''et al.'' was published, and too young to have contracted natural mumps as a child, and thus to achieve a [[herd immunity]] effect.

In 2008, for the first time in 14 years, measles was declared [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in the UK, meaning that the disease was sustained within the population; this was caused by the preceding decade's low MMR vaccination rates, which created a population of susceptible children who could spread the disease.<ref name=Eurosurveillance>{{cite journal |journal=Eurosurveillance |year=2008 |author1=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) – Surveillance and Communication Unit |volume=13 |issue=27 |page=18919 |title= Measles once again endemic in the United Kingdom |url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919|pmid=18761933}}</ref> MMR vaccination rates for English children were unchanged in 2007–08 from the year before, at too low a level to prevent serious measles outbreaks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7633115.stm |date=24 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-24 |title= MMR vaccine uptake rise 'stalls' |work=BBC News}}</ref> In May 2008, a British 17-year-old with an underlying [[immunodeficiency]] died of measles.

=== Impact on society ===
The ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' said that antivaccinationist activities resulted in a high cost to society, "including damage to individual and community well-being from outbreaks of previously controlled diseases, withdrawal of vaccine manufacturers from the market, compromising of national security (in the case of anthrax and smallpox vaccines), and lost productivity".<ref name=AgeOld/>

Costs to society from declining vaccination rates (in US dollars) were estimated by AOL's ''Daily Finance'' in 2011:<ref name=CostlyLie>{{cite web |url= http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/autism-vaccine-fraud-wakefield-cost-money-deaths/19793484/ |title= The Autism Vaccine Fraud: Dr. Wakefield's Costly Lie to Society |author= Alazraki, Molly |date= 12 January 2011 |publisher= AOL Money and Finance: Daily Finance |accessdate= 2011-01-13}}</ref>

* A 2002–2003 outbreak of measles in Italy, "which led to the hospitalizations of more than 5,000 people, had a combined estimated cost between 17.6 million euros and 22.0 million euros".
* A 2004 outbreak of measles from "an unvaccinated student return[ing] from India in 2004 to Iowa was $142,452".
* A 2006 outbreak of mumps in Chicago, "caused by poorly immunized employees, cost the institution $262,788, or $29,199 per mumps case."
* A 2007 outbreak of mumps in Nova Scotia cost $3,511 per case.
* A 2008 outbreak of measles in San Diego, California cost $177,000, or $10,376 per case.

To offset increased insurance expenses, [[pediatrics|pediatrician]] Rahul Parikh relates how he and a colleague have suggested how anti-vaccine parents should help to defray those expenses:

: "Refusing to vaccinate a child is dangerous not just for that child but for entire communities. It's precisely this point a colleague of mine was considering when he had the idea that parents who refuse to vaccinate their kids should pay substantially higher health insurance premiums. It makes sense. Insurance, after all, is just a pool of money into which we all pay."<ref name=Parikh>Rahul Parikh, [http://articles.cnn.com/2011-01-20/opinion/parikh.childhood.immunizations_1_autism-and-vaccines-andrew-wakefield-anti-vaccine?_s=PM:OPINION "Make anti-vaccine parents pay higher premiums"], ''[[CNN]]'' 20 January 2011</ref>

He then related some of the human impact caused by the 2008 measles outbreak in San Diego, California mentioned above:

: "A child whose parents refused to vaccinate him traveled to Europe and brought home the measles. That family exposed 839 people, resulting in 11 additional cases of measles. One child too young to be vaccinated had to be hospitalized. Forty-eight children too young to be vaccinated had to be quarantined...."<ref name=Parikh/>
