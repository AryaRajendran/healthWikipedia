'''Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome (THE)''', also known as '''syndromic''' or '''phenotypic diarrhea''', is an extremely rare [[congenital disease|congenital]] bowel disorder which manifests itself as intractable [[diarrhea]] in infants with [[intrauterine growth retardation]], [[hair disease|hair]] and [[Dysmorphic feature|facial abnormalities]].<ref name="Orphanet">{{cite journal |author=Goulet O, Vinson C, Roquelaure B, Brousse N, Bodemer C, Cézard JP |title=Syndromic (phenotypic) diarrhea in early infancy |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=3 |issue= |pages=6 |year=2008 |pmid=18304370 |pmc=2279108 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-3-6 |url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/3//6}}</ref> Many also have [[liver disease]] and abnormalities of the [[immune system]].<ref name="Orphanet"/> The associated [[malabsorption]] leads to [[malnutrition]] and [[failure to thrive]].<ref name="Orphanet"/>

It is thought to be a [[genetic disorder]] with an [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance pattern, although responsible [[gene]]s have not been found and the exact cause remains [[idiopathic|unknown]]. Prognosis is poor; many patients die before the age of 5 (mainly from [[infection]]s or [[cirrhosis]]), although most patients nowadays survive with intravenous feeding ([[parenteral nutrition]]).

== Genetics ==

The syndrome appears to be due to mutations in the gene [[tetratricopeptide repeat domain 37]] (TTC37) which encodes the protein [[Thespin]].<ref name=Fabre2011>Fabre A, Martinez-Vinson C, Roquelaure B, Missirian C, André N, Breton A, Lachaux A, Odul E, Colomb V, Lemale J, Cézard JP, Goulet O, Sarles J, Levy N, Badens C (2011) Novel mutations in TTC37 associated with tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome. Hum Mutat 32(3):277-281. {{doi|10.1002/humu.21420}}.</ref> This gene is expressed is in the [[adrenal gland]], [[amniotic fluid]], [[bladder]], [[blood]], [[bone]], [[bone marrow]], [[brain]], [[cervix]], [[connective tissue]], [[ear]], [[epididymis]], [[eye]], [[heart]], [[intestine]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], [[human lung|lung]], [[lymph node]]s, [[mammary gland]]s, [[mouth]], [[muscle]], [[nerve]], [[oesophagus]], [[ovary]], [[pancreas]], [[human pharynx|pharynx]], [[placenta]], [[prostate]], [[pituitary gland]], [[salivary gland]], [[testis]], [[thyroid]], [[tonsil]], [[thymus]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[skin]], [[uterus]], [[spleen]], [[spinal cord]], [[stomach]] and vascular tissue. It is also expressed in [[ascites]] and various embryonic tissues. It is expressed at high level in the intestine, lung, lymph nodes, pituitary and vascular tissues. This gene is also known as KIAA0372, MGC32587 and TPR repeat protein 37.  

This gene is located on the Crick (minus) strand of the long arm of [[chromosome 5]] (5q15). The gene is 91,113 bases in length and encodes a protein of 1564 amino acid residues with twenty tetratricopeptide repeats. It has 43 exons of which exons 1, 2 and 3 are non coding. The predicted molecular weight of the protein is 175.486 kilo[[Dalton (unit)|Dalton]]s and its predicted pI is 7.47. Its function is unknown but it may have adenylate cyclase activity and calcium- and calmodulin-responsive adenylate cyclase activity.  A homolog has been identified in the frog (''[[Xenopus tropicalis]]''), the mouse (''[[Mus musculus]]'') and the rat (''[[Rattus norvegicus]]''). In the mouse this gene is located on chromosome 13.

==Symptoms==
Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome is one particular form of [[intractable diarrhea of infancy]], presenting typically in the first month of life. These babies were usually born [[small for gestational age|small for their age]] and continue to experience [[failure to thrive]], usually with a final [[short stature]]. Typical facial features include prominent forehead and cheeks, a broad nasal root and widely spaces eyes ([[hypertelorism]]). Their hairs are woolly, easily removed and poorly pigmented. Liver disease is mainly present as [[cirrhosis]] or [[fibrosis]], and staining might reveal high iron content of the [[hepatocyte|liver cells]] (consistent with [[hemochromatosis]]).<ref name="pmid9021008">{{cite journal |author=Verloes A, Lombet J, Lambert Y, ''et al.'' |title=Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome: further delineation of a distinct syndrome with neonatal hemochromatosis phenotype, intractable diarrhea, and hair anomalies |journal=Am.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome (1).jpg|thumb|Microscopic analysis of the hair shaft showing breaks located at nodes in the hair ([[trichorrhexis nodosa]]) and longitudinal breaks.]]

===Facial features===

The typical facial features are low-set ears, prominent eyes with hypertelorism, broad flat nose, prominent forehead and large mouth.

===Liver===

There may be fibrosis with bile duct proliferation, occasional giant cells and regenerative parenchymal nodules. Siderosis is common.

===Small bowel===

[[Histopathology|Microscopic examination]] of a biopsy of the small bowel in these patients shows [[villous atrophy]] with low or no [[mononuclear leucocyte|mononuclear cell]] infiltration of the [[lamina propria]] nor specific abnormalities involving the [[epithelium]]. The amount of villous atrophy does not explain the severity of the diarrhea.

Studies of enterocyte brush-border ion transporter proteins ([[sodium hydrogen exchanger]] 2, sodium hydrogen exchanger 3, [[aquaporin]] 7, [[sodium iodide symporter]] and [[hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase]]) showed reduced expression or mislocalization in all patients with different profiles for each.<ref name=Hartley2010>Hartley JL, Zachos NC, Dawood B, Donowitz M, Forman J, Pollitt RJ, Morgan NV, Tee L, Gissen P, Kahr WH, Knisely AS, Watson S, Chitayat D, Booth IW, Protheroe S, Murphy S, de Vries E, Kelly DA, Maher ER (2010) Mutations in TTC37 cause trichohepatoenteric syndrome (phenotypic diarrhea of infancy). Gastroenterology 138 (7) 2388-2398.e2</ref>

===Hair===

Microscopic analysis of the hair shows twisted hairs of unequal size and different shapes (pili torti, aniso- and poikilotrichosis), longitudinal breaks and breaks located at nodes ([[trichorrhexis nodosa]]). [[Scanning electron microscopy]] might reveal hair budding ([[trichorrhexis blastysis]]). Biochemical analysis may reveal sulfur-deficient brittle hair ([[trichothiodystrophy]]; note that [[disulfide bond]]s determine hair waviness).

===Platelets===

[[Platelet]]s may be enlarged. The membrane surface connected canalicular system is disrupted with prominent tubules and small membranous vesicles. Alpha granules may be missing from the platelets. Despite these abnormalities there is no increased tendency to bleed in this syndrome.

===Other===

Immunodeficiency is a consistent feature with low serum concentrations of immunoglobulins which may improve with age and a poor immunological response to childhood vaccination. [[T cell]] dysfunction and abnormal [[antibody]] generation have been reported.

==Treatment==
No specific treatment or cure exists. Affected children usually need [[total parenteral nutrition]] through a [[central venous catheter]]. Further worsening of liver damage should however be avoided if possible. Diarrhea will likely continue even though food stops passing through the [[gastrointestinal system]].<ref name="pmid8021782">{{cite journal |author=Girault D, Goulet O, Le Deist F, ''et al.'' |title=Intractable infant diarrhea associated with phenotypic abnormalities and immunodeficiency |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=125 |issue=1 |pages=36–42 |year=1994 |month=July |pmid=8021782 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-3476(94)70118-0|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022347694001022}}</ref> They can subsequently be managed with [[tube feeding]], and some may be weaned from nutritional support during adolescence.

==Epidemiology==
Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 300,000 to 400,000 live births in [[Western Europe]]. This syndrome was first reported in 1982 with a report on 2 siblings,<ref name="pmid7073301">{{cite journal |author=Stankler L, Lloyd D, Pollitt RJ, Gray ES, Thom H, Russell G |title=Unexplained diarrhoea and failure to thrive in 2 siblings with unusual facies and abnormal scalp hair shafts: a new syndrome |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=212–6 |year=1982 |month=March |pmid=7073301 |pmc=1627586 |doi= 10.1136/adc.57.3.212|url=}}</ref> and as of 2008 there were around 25 published cases in medical journals. There seem to be no racial differences in its occurrence. It might be more common, as many genetic diseases, in areas with high levels of [[consanguinity]].
