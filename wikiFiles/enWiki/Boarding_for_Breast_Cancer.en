B4BC was founded in 1996 by Lisa Hudson and Kathleen Gasperini with professional snowboarders [[Tina Basich]] and [[Shannon Dunn-Downing]].

==History==
Boarding for Breast Cancer (B4BC) was founded in 1996 to [[Raising awareness|raise awareness]] about breast cancer.  B4BC cites the death of a 26-year old woman who died of breast cancer as a result of complications that arose from delayed diagnosis of the disease as the inspiration for the formation of the group.<ref name="b4bc_aboutus">{{cite web|title=B4BC: About Us|url=http://www.b4bc.org/index.php?area=aboutus|work=http://www.b4bc.org|publisher=Boarding for Breast Cancer Foundation|accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref>  To increase awareness of the risks of breast cancer in youth populations, B4BC hosted a "Snowboard + Music festival".

B4BC now performs educational outreach by advocating at colleges and universities, [[music festivals]] and [[action sports]] events. B4BC also hosts a nationwide "board-a-thons" nationwide as a platform to advocate for healthy lifestyles. 

In 2009, B4BC established the Survivor Scholarship Fund which seeks to enhance [[survivorship]] by connecting breast cancer survivors to health + wellness retreats.

==Events==
B4BC sponsors and participates in a wide array of events to raise money and awareness for their cause. They set up tents and educate girls about Breast Cancer Awareness at a wide variety of events, from large events such as the [[Warped Tour]] and the Winter [[X Games]] to the Union Square Street Sessions in [[Central Park]]. They also sponsor snowboarding events and rail jams across the country.  Their events have attracted several notable music groups including the [[Beastie Boys]], [[Blink-182]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Moby]], [[Less than Jake]], [[Luscious Jackson]], [[Ozomatli]], [[Michael Franti|Spearhead]], and [[Supersuckers]].

Other fundraising efforts include a variety of parties and auctions to raise money for the organization. At a recent auction during SNOWBOARDER Magazine's Superpark event in [[Keystone Resort]], the organization auctioned off dates with single snowboarders, such as [[Scotty Arnold]] and [[Hana Beaman]].
