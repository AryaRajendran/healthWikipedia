'''Globus pharyngis''' (also known as '''globus sensation''', '''globus''' or, somewhat outdatedly, '''globus hystericus''', commonly referred to as having a "'''lump in one's throat'''"), is the persistent sensation of having [[phlegm]], a pill or some other sort of obstruction in the [[throat]] when there is none. Swallowing can be performed normally, so it is not a true case of [[dysphagia]], but it can become quite irritating. One may also feel mild chest pain or even severe pain with a clicking sensation when swallowing.

==Causes==
The "lump in the throat" sensation that characterizes globus pharyngis is often caused by [[inflammation]] of one or more parts of the throat, such as the [[larynx]] or [[hypopharynx]], due to [[Cricopharyngeal Spasm]], [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|gastroesophageal reflux]] (GERD), [[Laryngopharyngeal reflux]] or [[Dysphagia|esophageal dysmotility]].<ref name="Smith"/> 

In some cases the cause is unknown and symptoms may be attributed to a [[psychogenic]] cause ''i.e.'' a [[Somatoform disorder|somatoform]] or [[anxiety disorder]]. It has been recognised as a symptom of depression, which responds to anti-depressive treatment.<ref>Cybulska EM, 1997, "Globus Hystericus—A Somatic Symptom of Depression? The Role of
Electroconvulsive Therapy and Antidepressants"''Psychosomatic Medicine'', 59:67-69.</ref><ref>Cybulska EM,1998, "Globus Hystericus or Depressivus?", ''Hospital Medicine'', Aug;59(8):640-1.</ref>
Differential diagnosis must be made from Eagle's Syndrome which uses the patient's description of "something caught in my throat" as a diagnostic tool. Eagle's Syndrome is an elongation of the styloid process causing irritation to nerves and muscles in the region resulting in a number of unusual symptoms.

A less common cause, distinguished by a "lump in the throat" accompanied with clicking sensation and considerable pain when swallowing, may be due to thyroid-cartilage rubbing against anomalous asymmetrical [[Larynx|laryngeal]] anatomy ''e.g.'' the superior cornu abrading against the [[Cricothyroid muscle|thyroid lamina]],<ref name="Nadig">{{Cite journal

}}</ref> However this cause is frequently misdiagnosed, despite requiring a simple clinical examination involving careful palpation of the neck side to side which elicits the same click sensation (laryngeal crepitus) and pain as when swallowing, most cases are due to prior trauma to the neck.<ref name="Smith"/> High resolution [[Computed tomography|computed tomographic]] (CT) or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan of the larynx is usually required to fully understand the anomalous [[Larynx|laryngeal]] anatomy. Anterior displacement the thyroid ala on the affected side while swallowing can help resolve symptoms.

==Cultural references==
A notable fictional sufferer was [[Danny Kaye|Danny Weems]] in the 1944 film ''[[Up in Arms]]'', a [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]] who constantly complained about a "clicking" in his throat, especially when he turned his neck.<ref name="Smith"/>
