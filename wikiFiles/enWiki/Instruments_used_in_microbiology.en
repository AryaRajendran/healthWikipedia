{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Instrument !! Uses
|-
| [[Incubator (microbiology)|Incubator]] ||  used for bacterial or fungal cultures
|-
| [[brittany]] || 	a process of sterilization from [[spore]]-bearing [[bacteria]]
|-
| [[Vaccine bath]] || used to heat vaccine containing medium gently (to around 45-55 degrees Celsius) during [[vaccine]] production
|-
| [[Thermal cycler]] || used to amplify segments of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process.
|-
| [[Inoculation loop]]: || used to [[inoculate]] test samples into [[culture media]] for bacterial or fungal cultures, antibiograms, etc.
|-
| •Nichrome wire loop || used to inoculate test samples into culture media for bacterial or fungal cultures, antibiograms, etc.; reheated by flaming to red hot before use
|-
| •Platinum wire loop || used to inoculate test samples into culture media for bacterial or fungal cultures, antibiograms, etc.; reheated by flaming to red hot before use
|-
| •Sterile loops || used to inoculate test samples into culture media for bacterial or fungal cultures, antibiograms, etc.; not heated before use—these are disposable presteriliised
|-
| [[Petri dish]]/[[agar plate]] || to act as a supporting container to hold the [[culture medium]] in
|-
| [[McIntosh and Filde's anaerobic jar]] || production of [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions for organisms that die in the presence of even little [[oxygen]] (anaerobiosis), e.g. [[tetanus]] bacteria
|-
| [[Gas-pak]] || releases gases to remove oxygen from a closed container, usually for [[anaerobiosis]]
|-
| [[Vacuum pump]] || to draw out the air from any closed chamber before pumping back [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[dioxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] or [[dinitrogen|N<sub>2</sub>]], usually for [[anaerobiosis]]
|-
| [[Durham tube|Durham's tube]] || used to detect gas production in [[sugar]] [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] media; the tube is placed in an inverted fashion so that gases produces get trapped in it and do not float away to the surface
|-
| Bijou bottle || a cylindrical small glass bottle with a screw cap used as a culture medium holder
|-
| [[Blood]] collection bottle || to collect blood by [[venipuncture]] 
|-
| Castaneda's medium / Castaneda's bottle || used for simultaneous solid and liquid cultures in one bottle
|-
| Universal container || a cylindrical small glass bottle with a screw cap used as a culture medium holder
|-
| Flat medical bottle or McCartney's bottle || for simultaneous solid and liquid cultures.
|-
|[[Tuberculin]] syringe || as a normal syringe or to perform [[Mantoux]] test
|-
| Desiccator || to dry things
|-
| Pre-sterilized [[disposable]] container || specimen collection
|-
| Pre-sterilized [[Sharps waste#Injection technologies|disposable syringe]] / [[Sharps waste#Injection technologies|auto-destruct syringes]] || specimen collection
|-
| Pre-sterilized disposable [[Cotton swab|swab]]s / NIH swab / postnasal swab || specimen collection
|-
| [[VDRL]] rotator || for [[VDRL]] test
|-
| [[serology|Serological]] test slides like those for [[anti-streptolysin O|ASO]], [[VDRL]], rheumatoid factor || ''vide links''
|-
| [[Lovibond comparator]] || a type of a [[Colorimeter (chemistry)|colorimeter]]
|-
| Microtitre plates || for [[ELISA]]
|-
| [[Haemagglutination]] plate || for viral culture detection
|-
| [[Latex]] [[agglutination]] tiles || for serological analysis
|-
| [[Cragie tube]] || ''see link''
|-
| [[Tissue culture]] bottles || to grow or keep alive cells or tissue from a living organism, e.g. [[stem cells]]
|-
| Candle jar || historically used for anaerobiosis; a lit candle was placed in as air-tight jar such that when it went out it would be because it used up all the available [[oxygen]]
|}[[Centrifuge]] toseperate suparnatent & pallete
As well as those "used in microbiological sterilization and disinfection" (see relevant section).'''
