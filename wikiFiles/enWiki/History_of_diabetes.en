Concerning the sweetness of urine, it is to be noted that the Chinese, Japanese and Korean words for diabetes are based on the same ideographs (糖尿病) which mean "sugar urine disease". It was in 1776 that [[Matthew Dobson]] confirmed that the sweet taste comes from an excess of a kind of sugar in the urine and blood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dobson|first=M.|coauthors=|year=1776|title=Nature of the urine in diabetes|journal=Medical Observations and Inquiries|volume=5|pages=298–310 }}</ref>

The first complete clinical description of diabetes was given by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[physician]] [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1st century [[Common Era|CE]]), who noted the excessive amount of urine which passed through the kidneys and gave the disease the name “diabetes.”<ref name=RCPE>{{cite web

Diabetes mellitus appears to have been a death sentence in the ancient era. Hippocrates makes no mention of it, which may indicate that he felt the disease was incurable. Aretaeus did attempt to treat it but could not give a good prognosis; he commented that "life (with diabetes) is short, disgusting and painful."<ref>{{Cite book|author=Medvei, Victor Cornelius|title=The history of clinical endocrinology|publisher=Parthenon Pub. Group|location=Carnforth, Lancs., U.K|year=1993|pages=23–34|isbn=1-85070-427-9 }}</ref>

In medieval [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[Avicenna]] (980–1037) provided a detailed account on diabetes mellitus in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', "describing the abnormal appetite and the collapse of sexual functions," and he documented the sweet taste of diabetic urine. Like Aretaeus before him, Avicenna recognized a primary and secondary diabetes. He also described diabetic [[gangrene]], and treated diabetes using a mixture of [[lupin]]e, [[trigonella]] ([[fenugreek]]), and [[zedoary]] seed, which produces a considerable reduction in the excretion of sugar, a treatment which is still prescribed in modern times. Avicenna also "described diabetes insipidus very precisely for the first time", though it was later [[Johann Peter Frank]] (1745–1821) who first differentiated between diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism|year=2003|volume=1|pages=43–45 [44–5]|title=Clinical Endocrinology in the Islamic Civilization in Iran|last=Nabipour|first=I.}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=September 2010}}

Although diabetes has been recognized since [[ancient history|antiquity]], and treatments of various efficacy have been known in various regions since the [[Middle Ages]], and in [[Snake oil|legend]] for much longer, pathogenesis of diabetes has only been understood experimentally since about 1900.<ref name="FASEBJ2002-Patlak">{{Cite journal|author=Patlak M |title=New weapons to combat an ancient disease: treating diabetes |journal=The FASEB Journal |volume=16 |issue=14 |page=1853 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12468446|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/16/14/1853.2}}</ref>
The discovery of a role for the pancreas in diabetes is generally ascribed to [[Joseph von Mering]] and [[Oskar Minkowski]], who in 1889 found that dogs whose pancreas was removed developed all the signs and symptoms of diabetes and died shortly afterwards.<!--

In 1910, Sir [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer]] suggested that people with diabetes were deficient in a single chemical that was normally produced by the pancreas—he proposed calling this substance ''insulin'', from the Latin ''insula'', meaning island, in reference to the insulin-producing [[islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas.

The endocrine role of the pancreas in metabolism, and indeed the existence of insulin, was not further clarified until 1921, when Sir [[Frederick Grant Banting]] and [[Charles Herbert Best]] repeated the work of Von Mering and Minkowski, and went further to demonstrate they could reverse induced diabetes in dogs by giving them an extract from the pancreatic islets of Langerhans of healthy dogs.<!--

Banting, Best, and colleagues (especially the chemist [[James Collip|Collip]]) went on to purify the hormone insulin from bovine pancreases at the [[University of Toronto]]. This led to the availability of an effective treatment—insulin injections—and the first patient was treated in 1922. For this, Banting and laboratory director [[John James Rickard Macleod|John MacLeod]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1923; both shared their Prize money with others in the team who were not recognized, in particular Best and Collip. Banting and Best made the patent available without charge and did not attempt to control commercial production. [[Insulin]] production and therapy rapidly spread around the world, largely as a result of this decision. Banting is honored by [[World Diabetes Day]] which is held on his birthday, November 14.

The distinction between what is now known as type&nbsp;1 diabetes and type&nbsp;2 diabetes was first clearly made by Sir [[Harold Percival Himsworth|Harold Percival (Harry) Himsworth]], and published in January 1936.<ref name="Lancet1936-Himsworth">{{Cite journal|author= Himsworth|title=''Diabetes mellitus: its differentiation into insulin-sensitive and insulin-insensitive types|journal= Lancet|year=1936|pages=127–30|volume=227|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)36134-2|issue= 5864}}</ref>

Other landmark discoveries include:<ref name="FASEBJ2002-Patlak" />

* Identification of the first of the [[sulfonylurea]]s in 1942
* Reintroduction of the use of [[biguanides]] for Type&nbsp;2 diabetes in the late 1950s. The initial [[phenformin]] was withdrawn worldwide (in the U.S. in 1977) due to its potential for sometimes fatal lactic acidosis and [[metformin]] was first marketed in France in 1979, but not until 1994 in the US.
* The determination of the [[amino acid sequence]] of insulin (by Sir [[Frederick Sanger]], for which he received a Nobel Prize)
* The [[radioimmunoassay]] for insulin, as discovered by [[Rosalyn Yalow]] and [[Solomon Berson]] (gaining Yalow the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine)<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Yalow RS, Berson SA |title=Immunoassay of endogenous plasma insulin in man |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=39 |issue= 7|pages=1157–75 |year=1960 |month=July |pmid=13846364 |pmc=441860|doi=10.1172/JCI104130}}</ref>
* The three-dimensional structure of insulin ({{PDB|2INS}})
* Dr [[Gerald Reaven]]'s identification of the constellation of symptoms now called [[metabolic syndrome]] in 1988
* Demonstration that intensive glycemic control in type&nbsp;1 diabetes reduces chronic side effects more as glucose levels approach 'normal' [[Diabetes control and complications trial|in a large longitudinal study]],<ref>{{Cite journal|author= |title=The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

* Identification of the first [[thiazolidinedione]] as an effective insulin sensitizer during the 1990s

In 1980, U.S. biotech company Genentech developed biosynthetic human insulin. The insulin was isolated from genetically altered bacteria (the bacteria contain the human gene for synthesizing synthetic human insulin), which produce large quantities of insulin. The purified insulin is distributed to pharmacies for use by diabetes patients.  Initially, this development was not regarded by the medical profession as a clinically meaningful development.  However, by 1996, the advent of insulin analogues which had vastly improved [[ADME|absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)]] characteristics which were clinically meaningful based on this early biotechnology development.
