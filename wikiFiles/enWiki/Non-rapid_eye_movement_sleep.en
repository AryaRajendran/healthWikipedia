'''Non-rapid eye movement''', or '''NREM''', is, collectively, [[sleep]] stages 1–3, previously known as stages 1–4. [[Rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM) is not included. There are distinct [[electroencephalographic]] and other characteristics seen in each stage. Unlike REM sleep, there is usually little or no eye movement during this stage. [[Dream]]ing is rare during NREM sleep, and muscles are not paralyzed as in REM sleep. People who do not go through the sleeping stages properly get stuck in NREM sleep and because muscles are not paralyzed, a person may be able to sleepwalk.<ref>OConnell, C. (2010, Mar 09).

==Stages of NREM sleep==
NREM sleep was divided into four stages in the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) standardization of 1968. That has been reduced to three in the 2007 update by The [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]] (AASM).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schulz |first=Hartmut |year=2008 |title=Rethinking sleep analysis.

* '''Stage 1''' – occurs mostly in the beginning of sleep, with slow eye movement. [[Alpha waves]] disappear and the [[theta wave]] appears. People aroused from this stage often believe that they have been fully awake. During the transition into stage 1 sleep, it is common to experience [[hypnic jerk]]s.<ref>[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]], [http://www.talkaboutsleep.com/sleep-disorders/archives/understandingsleep.htm# Understanding sleep]</ref>
* '''Stage 2''' – no eye movement occurs, and dreaming is very rare. The sleeper is quite easily awakened. [[EEG]] recordings tend to show characteristic "[[sleep spindle]]s" and "[[K-complex]]es" during this stage.
* '''Stage 3''' – previously divided into stages 3 and 4, is deep sleep, [[slow-wave sleep]] (SWS). Stage 3 was formerly the transition between stage 2 and stage 4 where [[delta wave]]s, associated with "deep" sleep, began to occur, while delta waves dominated in stage 4. In 2007, these were combined into just stage 3 for all of deep sleep.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/glossary/n-p |title= Glossary.

While never confirmed, various education systems eg. the VCAA of Australian victorian education practice still practise the stages 3 & 4 separation.

==Dreaming during NREM==
Although study participants' reports of intense dream vividness during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]] and increased recollection of dreams occurring during that phase{{clarify|date=November 2012}}<!-- "Increased recollection" = increased percentage of dream timespan recalled, increased detail in whatever portions are recalled, or both?  Were subjects awakened during dream phases, after a given amount of time regardless of phase, or not at all (allowing them to wake up when they felt like doing so)? --> suggest that dreaming most commonly occurs during that stage{{clarify|date=November 2012}}<!-- "[D]reaming most commonly occurs..." = "a majority/plurality of dreams occur during that stage," "the time fraction of that stage spent dreaming is greater than the time fraction of any other stage spent dreaming" (the difference being that if a phase is short but "sleep-dense," it could in theory be the most "dream-dense" part even if only a small fraction of dreams occur during it), or ...?  --> ,<ref>Dement W, Kleitman N. The relation of eye movements during sleep to dream activity: an objective method for the study of dream. J. Exp. Psychol. 1957; 53: 339–4</ref> dreaming can also occur during NREM sleep. 

Research has also shown that dreams during the NREM stage most commonly occur during the morning hours which is also the time period with the highest occurrence of REM sleep.  This was found through a study involving subjects taking naps over specific intervals of time and being forcefully awakened, their sleep was separated into naps including only REM sleep and only NREM sleep using [[polysomnography]]. This implies that the polysomnographic occurrence of REM sleep is not required for dreaming. Rather, the actual mechanisms that create REM sleep cause changes to one's sleep experience. Through these changes, by morning, a sub-cortical activation occurs during NREM that is comparable to the type that occurs during REM. It is this sub-cortical activation that results in dreaming during the NREM stage during the morning hours.<ref>Suzuki H; Uchiyama M; Tagaya H et al. Dreaming during nonrapid eye movement sleep in the absence of prior rapid eye movement sleep. SLEEP 2004;27(8):1486-90.</ref>

==Polysomnography==
[[Polysomnography]] (PSG) is a test used in the study of sleep; the test result is called a [[polysomnogram]]. Below are images of the NREM stages 1, 2 and 4 (prior to the merging of stages 3 and 4). 

The figures represent 30-second epochs (30 seconds of data). They represent data from both eyes, chin, EEG, legs, microphone, intercostal EMG, sternocleidomastoid activity, nasal/oral air flow, thoracic effort, abdominal effort, [[EKG]], [[pulse oximetry|oxymetry]], and body position, in that order. EEG is highlighted by the red box. Sleep spindles in the stage 2 figure are underlined in red.

==Slow-wave sleep==
[[Slow-wave sleep]] (SWS) is made up of the deepest stage of NREM, and is often referred to as deep sleep. 

The highest arousal thresholds (e.g. difficulty of awakening, such as by a sound of a particular volume) are observed in stage 3. A person will typically feel groggy when awoken from this stage, and indeed, cognitive tests administered after awakening from stage 3 indicate that mental performance is somewhat impaired for periods up to 30 minutes or so, relative to awakenings from other stages. This phenomenon has been called "[[sleep inertia]]."

After [[sleep deprivation]] there is usually a sharp rebound of SWS, suggesting there is a "need" for this stage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11382878|title=Selective slow-wave sleep (SWS) deprivation and SWS rebound: do we need a fixed SWS amount per night? |accessdate=2012-07-02 |year=1999 |quote=Visually scored delta activity (stages 3 and 4, SWS) as well as computerized delta activity measures increase after total and selective sleep deprivation. It is, however, still controversial if SWS amount is only a function of prior waking duration, or if it is related to the structure of the previous sleep period}}</ref>

Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) is a highly active state unlike a state of brain quiescence as previously thought.   Brain imaging data has shown that during nonREM sleep the regional brain activity is influenced by the waking experience just passed.  

A study was done involving an experimental and a control group to have them learn to navigate a 3D maze.  The blood flow in the parahippocampal gyrus increased in conjunction with the individual's performance through the 3D maze.  Participants were then trained in the maze for 4 hours and later, during the various sleep cycles of nonREM sleep, REM sleep and wakefulness, they were scanned twelve times using PET during the night.  The PET scan demonstrated a higher blood flow in the hippocampus during SWS/non-REM sleep due to the training from the previous day while the control group exhibited no increased blood flow and they had not received the training the prior day.  The brain activity during sleep, according to this study, would show the events of the previous day do make a difference.  One theory suggests a model of Hippocampal-neocortical dialogue.  "Two stages of hippocampal activity have been proposed, the first being the recording of the memory during waking and the second involving the playback of the memory during nonREM sleep.  This process of reactivation of memory firing sequences is believed to gradually reinforce initially weak connections between neocortical sites allowing the original information to be activated in the cortex independently of the hippocampus, and thus ensuring refreshed encoding capacity of the hippocampus." Maquet concluded that the areas of the brain involved with information processing and memory have increased brain activity during the slow wave sleep period.  Events experienced in the previous day have more efficient and clearer memory recall the next day thus indicating that the memory regions of the brain are activated during SWS/non-REM sleep instead of being dormant as previously thought.<ref>Maquet, Pierre, "Understanding non rapid eye movement sleep through neuroimaging."
