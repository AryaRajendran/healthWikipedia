'''Female genital mutilation''' ('''FGM''') is practised in 28 countries in western, eastern, and north-eastern Africa, in parts of Asia and the Middle East, and within some immigrant communities in Europe and North America, according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). The WHO defines the practice as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."<ref name=WHO1>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html "Female genital mutilation"], World Health Organization, February 2010.</ref>

==Classifications of FGM==
{{main|Female genital mutilation}}
The WHO identifies four types of FGM:
*'''Type I''': removal of the [[clitoral hood]], the skin around the [[clitoris]], with or without partial or complete removal of the clitoris;
*'''Type II''': removal of the clitoris with partial or complete removal of the [[labia minora]];
*'''Type III''': removal of all or part of the labia minora and [[labia majora]], and the stitching of a seal across the vagina, leaving a small opening for the passage of urine and menstrual blood ([[infibulation]]);
*'''Type IV''': other miscellaneous acts, including cauterization of the clitoris, cutting of the vagina ([[gishiri cutting]]), and introducing corrosive substances into the vagina to tighten it.<ref name=Momoh6>Momoh, Comfort (ed).

In the Arabian peninsula, Types I and II FGM are usually performed, often referred to as "[[Sunnah|Sunna]] circumcision,"<ref>http://whqlibdoc.who.int/emro/tp/EMRO_TP_2_vol2_(part2).pdf</ref><ref>http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/first/hosken.html</ref> especially among Afro-Arabs (ethnic groups of African descent are more likely to prefer infibulation). The practice occurs particularly in northern [[Saudi Arabia]],<ref name="csmonitor.com">http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0810/p06s01-woiq.html?s=t5</ref> southern [[Jordan]],<ref name="csmonitor.com"/> and northern [[Iraq]] ([[Kurdistan]]).<ref name="Stop FGM in Kurdistan">[http://www.stopfgmkurdistan.org Stop FGM in Kurdistan]</ref><ref name="FGM in IK">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopfgmkurdistan.org/html/english/updates/update003e.htm|author=Strobel S, von der Osten-Sacken T |title=Female genital mutilation in Iraqi Kurdistan.

In the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], it is practiced mainly among foreign workers from [[East Africa]] and the [[Nile Valley]]. A 2009 study suggested that FGM had virtually disappeared among the [[Negev Bedouin]].<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=83287 "Bedouins shunning FGM/C – new research"], IRIN, March 4, 2009.</ref>

The practice can also be found among a few ethnic groups in South America.<ref name="irinnews" />  In [[Indonesia]], it is common in several districts; almost all are Type I or Type IV. Sometimes the procedures are merely symbolic, and no actual cutting is done.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/wi/rls/rep/crfgm/10102.htm " Indonesia: Report on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC)"], U.S. Department of State, June 1, 2001.</ref> As a result of immigration, FGM has also spread to Europe, Australia, and the United States, with some families having their daughters undergo the procedure while on vacation overseas. As Western governments become more aware of FGM, legislation has come into effect in many countries to make the practice a criminal offense. In 2006, [[Khalid Adem]] became the first man in the United States to be prosecuted for circumcising his daughter.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/02brfs-001.html?_r=1 "Georgia: Man Convicted in Daughter’s Mutilation"], Associated Press, 2 November 2010.</ref>

{{further|Maputo Protocol}}
In July 2003 at its second summit, the [[African Union]] adopted the Maputo Protocol promoting women's rights including and to end FGM. It came into force in November 2005, and by December 2008, 25 member countries had ratified it.<ref name=USStateDep>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080113175522/http://www.state.gov/g/wi/rls/rep/crfgm/ "Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC): Individual Country Reports"], U.S. State Department, accessed 7 September 2011.</ref>

In December 1997, the Court of Cassation (Egypt's highest appeals court) upheld a government banning of the practice providing that those who did not comply would be subjected to criminal and administrative punishments. This law had proved ineffective and in a survey in 2000, a study found that 97% of the country's population still practiced FGM; a 2005 study found that over 95% of Egyptian women have undergone some form of FGM.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL30168862 "Egypt death sparks debate on female circumcision"], Reuters, 20 June 2007.</ref>

No cases regarding the practice under the law have ever been brought to trial. Article 6 of the Guinean Constitution, which outlaws cruel and inhumane treatment, could be interpreted to include these practices, should a case be brought to the Supreme Court.

; Italy: After a few cases of infibulation practiced by complaisant medical practitioners within the African immigrants community came to public knowledge through media coverage, the Law n°7/2006 was passed on 1/9/2006, becoming effective on 1/28/2006, concerning "Measures of prevention and prohibition of any female genital mutilation practice"; the Act is also known as the ''Legge Consolo'' ("Consolo Act") named after its primary promoter, Senator Giuseppe Consolo. Article 6 of the law integrates the Italian Penal Code with Articles 583-''Bis'' and 583-''Ter'', punishing any practice of female genital mutilation "not justifiable under therapeutical or medical needs" with imprisonment ranging from 4 to 12 years (3 to 7 years for any mutilation other than, or less severe than, clitoridectomy, excision or infibulation). Penalty can be reduced up to {{frac|2|3}} if the harm caused is of modest entity (i.e. if partially or completely unsuccessful), but may also be elevated up to {{frac|3}} if the victim is a minor or if the offense has been committed for profit. An Italian citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in Italy can be punished under this law even if the offense is committed abroad; the law will as well afflict any individual of any citizenship in Italy, even illegally or provisionally. The law also mandates any medical practitioner found guilty under those provisions to have his/her medical license revoked for a minimum of six up to a maximum of ten years.<ref>[http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/06007l.htm Italian Law n°7 1/9/2006, ''Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile''], accessed 23 March 2009.</ref>

The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of 12 years. However, the sentence can be higher if the offender is a family member of the victim. It is also illegal to assist or encourage another person to perform FGM. A Dutch citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in the Netherlands can be punished even if the offense is committed abroad. Doctors have the obligation to report suspected cases of FGM and may break patient confidentiality rules if necessary.

The law was further reformulated in 1999, to allow for prosecution in a Swedish court of someone performing FGM even if the act has been performed in a country where it is not considered criminal (removal of the principle of double incrimination).<ref>{{Cite document|author=Johnsdotter, Sara |title=FGM in Sweden: Swedish Legislation Regarding 'Female Genital Mutilation' and Implementation of the Law.
