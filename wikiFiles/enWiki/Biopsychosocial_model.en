The '''biopsychosocial model''' (abbreviated "BPS") is a general model or approach positing that [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] (which entails thoughts, emotions, and behaviors), and [[social]] factors, all play a significant role in human functioning in the context of [[disease]] or illness. Indeed, health is best understood in terms of a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors rather than purely in biological terms.<ref name="Santrock, J. W. 2007">Santrock, J. W. (2007). ''A Topical Approach to Human Life-span Development'' (3rd ed.). St. Louis, MO: McGraw-Hill.</ref> This is in contrast to the traditional, [[reductionism|reductionist]] [[biomedical model]] of medicine that suggests every disease process can be explained in terms of an underlying deviation from normal function such as a [[pathogen]], genetic or [[developmental abnormality]], or injury.<ref name=engel77>Engel, George L.

The biopsychosocial paradigm is also a technical term for the popular concept of the "mind–body connection", which addresses more philosophical arguments between the biopsychosocial and biomedical models, rather than their empirical exploration and clinical application.<ref>Sarno, John E. MD "The Mindbody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain." 1998  [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446675156].</ref>

The model was theorized by [[psychiatrist]] [[George L. Engel]] at the [[University of Rochester]], and putatively discussed in a 1977 article in [[Science (journal)|Science]],<ref name=engel77/> where he posited "the need for a new medical model"; however no single definitive, irreducible model has been published.<ref name="mac">{{cite journal | author = McLaren N | year = 2002 | title = The myth of the biopsychosocial model | url = | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 701–703 }}</ref> The novelty, acceptance, and prevalence of the biopsychosocial model varies across cultures.<ref name="Santrock, J. W. 2007" />

==Model description and application in medicine==
The biological component of the biopsychosocial model seeks to understand how the cause of the illness stems from the functioning of the individual's body. The psychological component of the biopsychosocial model looks for potential psychological causes for a health problem such as lack of self-control, emotional turmoil, and negative thinking. The social part of the biopsychosocial model investigates how different social factors such as socioeconomic status, culture, poverty, technology, and religion can influence health.<ref name="Santrock, J. W. 2007" />

The biopsychosocial model of health is based in part on [[social cognitive theory]]. The biopsychosocial model implies that treatment of disease processes, for example type two [[diabetes]] and [[cancer]], requires that the health care team address [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[society|social]] influences upon a patient's functioning. In a philosophical sense, the biopsychosocial model states that the workings of the body can affect the mind, and the workings of the mind can affect the body.<ref>Halligan, P.W., & Aylward, M. (Eds.) (2006). "The Power of Belief: Psychosocial influence on illness, disability and medicine". Oxford University Press, UK</ref> This means both a direct interaction between mind and body as well as indirect effects through intermediate factors.

The biopsychosocial model presumes that it is important to handle the three together as a growing body of empirical literature suggests that patient perceptions of health and threat of disease, as well as barriers in a patient's social or cultural environment, appear to influence the likelihood that a patient will engage in health-promoting or treatment behaviors, such as medication taking, proper diet or [[nutrition]], and engaging in physical activity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = DiMatteo M.R., Haskard K.B., Williams S. L. | year = 2007 | title = Health beliefs, disease severity, and patient adherence: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Medical Care | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 521–528 }}</ref>

While operating from a BPS framework requires that more information be gathered during a consultation, a growing trend in US healthcare (and already well-established in Europe such as in the U.K. & Germany) includes the integration of professional services through integrated disciplinary teams, to provide better care and address the patient's needs at all three levels.<ref name="Gatchel, R. J. 2003">Gatchel, R. J. & Oordt, M. S. (2003) Clinical health psychology and primary care: Practical advice and clinical guidance for successful collaboration. American Psychological Association: Washington, D.C.</ref> As seen, for example in integrated primary care clinics, such as used in the U.K., Germany, U.S. Veteran's Administration, U.S. military, Kaiser Permanente, integrated teams may comprise physicians, nurses, health psychologists, social workers, and other specialties to address all three aspects of the BPS framework, allowing the physician to focus on predominantly biological mechanisms of the patient's complaints<ref name="Gatchel, R. J. 2003" /> See also<ref>Society of Behavioral Medicine</ref>

Psychosocial factors can cause a biological effect by predisposing the patient to risk factors. An example is that [[clinical depression|depression]] by itself may not cause [[liver]] problems, but a depressed person may be more likely to have [[ethanol|alcohol]] problems, and therefore liver damage. Perhaps it is this increased risk-taking that leads to an increased likelihood of disease. Most diseases in BPS discussion are such behaviourally-moderated illnesses, with known high risk factors, or so-called "biopsychosocial illnesses/disorders".<ref>Bruns D, Disorbio JM, "Chronic Pain and Biopsychosocial Disorders".

For example, approximately 20 million Americans are estimated to have diabetes, with 90% to 95% considered type 2.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wild S., Roglic G., Green A., Sicree R., King H. | year = 2004 | title = Global prevalence of diabetes: Estimates for the year 2000 and projections for 2030 | url = | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1047–1053 }}</ref>

It is important to note that the biopsychosocial model does not provide a straightforward, testable model to explain the interactions or causal influences (that is, amount of variance accounted for) by each of the components (biological, psychological, or social). Rather, the model has been a general framework to guide theoretical and empirical exploration, which has amassed a great deal of research since Engel's 1977 article. One of the areas that has been greatly influenced is the formulation and testing of social-cognitive models of health behavior over the past 30 years.<ref name="Armitage, C.

==Criticism==
Some critics point out this question of distinction and a question of determination of the roles of illness and disease runs against the growing concept of the patient–medical tradesperson partnership or [[patient empowerment]], as "biopsychosocial" becomes one more disingenuous [[euphemism]] for [[psychosomatic]] illness.<ref>McLaren N. "The Biopsychosocial Model and Scientific Fraud". {Paper presented to RANZCP Congress, Christchurch NZ May 2004. Revised version: "When does Self-Deception become Culpable?" Chap.8 in McLaren N. "Humanizing Madness: Psychiatry and the cognitive neurosciences" ISBN 978-1-932690-39-2</ref> This may be exploited by medical insurance companies or government welfare departments eager to limit or deny access to medical and social care.<ref>Rutherford J.

Some psychiatrists see the BPS model as flawed, in either formulation or application. Epstein and colleagues describe six conflicting interpretations of what the model might be, and proposes that "...habits of mind may be the missing link between a biopsychosocial intent and clinical reality."<ref>Epstein RM, Borrell-Carrio F, "The biopsychosocial model: exploring six impossible things". Families, Systems & Health 22 Dec 2005</ref> Psychiatrist Hamid Tavakoli argues that the BPS model should be avoided because it unintentionally promotes an artificial distinction between biology and psychology, and merely causes confusion in psychiatric assessments and training programs, and that ultimately it has not helped the cause of trying to destigmatize mental health.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2719450 | title =  A Closer Evaluation of Current Methods in Psychiatric Assessments: A Challenge for the Biopsychosocial Model | author= Hamid R.

Sociologist David Pilgrim suggests that a necessary pragmatism and a form of "mutual tolerance" (Goldie, 1977) has forced a co-existence of perspectives, rather than a genuine "theoretical integration as a shared BPS orthodoxy."<ref name="pilg">Pilgrim D. "The biopsychosocial model in Anglo-American psychiatry: Past, present and future" ''Journal of Mental Health'', Volume 11, Issue 6 December 2002 , pages 585 - 594 {{doi|10.1080/09638230020023930}}</ref> Pilgrim goes on to state that despite "scientific and ethical virtues," the BPS model "...has not been properly realised. It seems to have been pushed into the shadows by a return to medicine and the re-ascendancy of a biomedical model."<ref>The biopsychosocial model in Anglo-American psychiatry: Past, present and future" ''Journal of Mental Health'', Volume 11, Issue 6, pages 585 - 594 {{doi|10.1080/09638230020023930}}</ref>

"Since the collapse of the 19th century models (psychoanalysis, biologism and behaviourism), psychiatrists have been in search of a model that integrates the psyche and the soma.  So keen has been their search that they embraced the so-called 'biopsychosocial model' without ever bothering to check its details.  If, at any time over the last three decades, they had done so, they would have found it had none.  This would have forced them into the embarrassing position of having to acknowledge that modern psychiatry is operating in a theoretical vacuum."<ref>{{cite journal | author = McLaren N | year = 2006 | title = Interactive dualism as a partial solution to the mind-brain problem for psychiatry | url = | journal = Med Hypotheses | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 1165–73 }}</ref></blockquote>

In this sense, models are real and their material consequences can be measured, whereas theories are ideas and can no more be measured than daydreams. Model-building separates theories with a future from those that always remain dreams. An example of a true scientific model is longer necked giraffes reach more food, survive at higher rates, and pass on this longer neck trait to their progeny. This is a model (natural selection) of the theory of evolution. Therefore, from an [[epistemology|epistemological]] stance there can be no model of mental disorder without first establishing a [[theory of mind|theory of the mind]]. Dr. McLaren does not say that the biopsychosocial model is devoid of merit, just that it does not fit the definition of a scientific model (or theory) and does not "reveal anything that would not be known (implicitly, if not explicitly) to any practitioner of reasonable sensitivity." He states that the biopsychosocial model should be seen in a historical context as bucking against the trend of [[biological reductionism]], which was (and still is) overtaking psychiatry. Engel "has done a very great service to orthodox psychiatry in that he legitimised the concept of talking to people as people." In short, even though it is correct to say that sociology, psychology, and biology are factors in mental illness, simply stating this obvious fact does not make it a model in the scientific sense of the word.<ref name="McLaren 2007"/><ref name="McLaren N 1998 86–92; discussion 93–6"/><ref name=McLaren2010/><ref>{{Cite book

The psychiatry professor and author [[S. Nassir Ghaemi]] considers Engel's model to be anti-humanistic and advocates the use of less eclectic, less generic and less vague alternatives such as [[William Osler]]’s medical humanism or [[Karl Jaspers]]’ method-based psychiatry. <ref> Ghaemi S.N.
