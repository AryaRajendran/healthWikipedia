'''Autism therapies''' attempt to lessen the deficits and abnormal behaviours associated with [[autism]] and other [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD), and to increase the [[quality of life]] and functional independence of autistic individuals, especially children. Treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Treatments fall into two major categories: educational interventions and medical management. Training and support are also given to families of those with ASD.<ref name=CCD/>

Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about [[efficacy]].<ref name=Ospina/> Although many [[psychosocial]] interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of [[systematic review]]s of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options.<ref name=Seida/> Intensive, sustained special education programs and [[behavior therapy]] early in life can help children with ASD acquire self-care, social, and job skills,<ref name=CCD/> and often can improve functioning, and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors;<ref name=Rogers/> claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.<ref name=Howlin09/> Available approaches include [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA), developmental models, [[TEACCH|structured teaching]], [[speech and language therapy]], [[social skills]] therapy, and [[occupational therapy]].<ref name=CCD/> Educational interventions have some effectiveness in children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children,<ref name=Eikeseth/> and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children.<ref name=Rogers/> Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE |title=Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=367–84 |year=2008 |pmid=18855144 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z }}</ref> The limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |date=2003 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=131–40 |title=Effects of a model treatment approach on adults with autism |author=Van Bourgondien ME, Reichle NC, [[Eric Schopler|Schopler E]] |doi=10.1023/A:1022931224934 |pmid=12757352 }}</ref>

Many medications are used to treat problems associated with ASD.<ref name=Leskovec/> More than half of U.S. children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed [[psychoactive drug]]s or [[anticonvulsant]]s, with the most common drug classes being [[antidepressant]]s, [[stimulant]]s, and [[antipsychotic]]s.<ref name=medication-use/> Aside from antipsychotics,<ref name=Posey/> there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD.<ref name=Angley1/><ref name=Broadstock/> A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications, the medications can have [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]], and no known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments.<ref name=Buitelaar/>

==Historical approach==
Before autism was well understood, children in Britain and America would often be put in institutions on the instruction of doctors and the parents told to forget about them. [[The Observer|Observer]] journalist [[Christopher Stevens (journalist)|Christopher Stevens]], father of an autistic child, reports how a British doctor told him that after a child was admitted, usually "nature would take its course" and the child would die due to the prevalence of [[tuberculosis]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/nov/13/autism-first-child-growing-up ''Autism's early child''], Guardian, retrieved 13/11/2011</ref>

==Educational interventions==
Educational interventions attempt to help children not only to learn academic subjects and gain traditional readiness skills, but also to improve functional communication and spontaneity, enhance social skills such as [[joint attention]], gain cognitive skills such as symbolic play, reduce disruptive behavior, and generalize learned skills by applying them to new situations. Several model programs have been developed, which in practice often overlap and share many features, including:<ref name=CCD/>
* early intervention that does not wait for a definitive diagnosis;
* intense intervention, at least 25 hours per week, 12 months per year;
* low student/teacher ratio;
* family involvement, including training of parents;
* interaction with [[neurotypical]] peers;
* structure that includes predictable routine and clear physical boundaries to lessen distraction; and
* ongoing measurement of a systematically planned intervention, resulting in adjustments as needed.

Several educational intervention methods are available, as discussed below. They can take place at home, at school, or at a center devoted to autism treatment; they can be done by parents, teachers, speech and language therapists, and occupational therapists.<ref name=CCD/><ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Am J Occup Ther |date=2008 |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=416–29 |title=Evidence-based review of interventions for autism used in or of relevance to occupational therapy |author=Case-Smith J, Arbesman M |pmid=18712004 }}</ref> A 2007 study found that augmenting a center-based program with weekly home visits by a [[special education]] teacher improved cognitive development and behavior.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Rickards AL, Walstab JE, Wright-Rossi RA, Simpson J, Reddihough DS |title=A randomized, controlled trial of a home-based intervention program for children with autism and developmental delay |journal=J Dev Behav Pediatr |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=308–16 |year=2007 |pmid=17700083 |doi=10.1097/DBP.0b013e318032792e }}</ref>

===Applied behavior analysis===
{{further|Applied behavior analysis}}
Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the applied research field of the science of [[behavior analysis]], and it underpins a wide range of techniques used to treat autism and many other behaviors and diagnoses,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Dillenburger K, Keenan M |title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths |journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=193–5 |year=2009 |pmid=19404840 |doi=10.1080/13668250902845244 }}</ref> including those who are patients in rehab or who need to have their behavior reinforced using [[Positive behavior support]] (PBS) systems.

====Early intensive behavioral intervention====
{{further|Early intensive behavior intervention}}
Many behavioral interventions rely heavily on discrete trial teaching (DTT) methods, which use stimulus-response-reward techniques to teach foundational skills such as attention, compliance, and imitation.<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Ryan Carolyn S., Hemmes Nancy S. | year = 2005 | title = Post-training Discrete-Trial Teaching Performance by Instructors of Young Children with Autism in Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_6/ai_n28321085/ | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 1–16 }}</ref> However, children have problems using DTT-taught skills in natural environments.<ref name=CCD/> These students are often taught with [[Natural language procedures]] to help lessen problems from DTT. In functional assessment, a common technique, a teacher formulates a clear description of a problem behavior, identifies antecedents, consequents, and other environmental factors that influence and maintain the behavior, develops hypotheses about what occasions and maintains the behavior, and collects observations to support the hypotheses.<ref name=CCD/> A few more-comprehensive ABA programs use multiple assessment and intervention methods individually and dynamically.<ref name=Steege>{{vcite journal |journal=Psychol Schools |year=2007 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=91–9 |title=Applied behavior analysis: beyond discrete trial teaching |author=Steege MW, Mace FC, Perry L, Longenecker H |doi=10.1002/pits.20208 }}</ref>

ABA-based techniques have demonstrated effectiveness in several controlled studies: children have been shown to make sustained gains in academic performance, [[adaptive behavior]], and language, with outcomes significantly better than control groups.<ref name=CCD/> A 2009 review of educational interventions for children, whose mean age was six years or less at intake, found that the higher-quality studies all assessed ABA, that ABA is well-established and no other educational treatment is considered probably-efficacious, and that intensive ABA treatment, carried out by trained therapists, is demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children.<ref name=Eikeseth>{{vcite journal |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=158–78 |year=2009 |title=Outcome of comprehensive psycho-educational interventions for young children with autism |author=Eikeseth S |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2008.02.003 |pmid=18385012 }}</ref> These gains maybe complicated by initial IQ.<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Weiss M.J, Delmolino L. | year = 2006 | title = The Relationship Between Early Learning Rates and Treatment Outcome For Children With Autism Receiving Intensive Home-Based Applied Behavior Analysis | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_7/ai_n28460870/| journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 96–100 }}</ref> A 2008 evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches found that ABA is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD.<ref name=Rogers/> A 2009 comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), a form of ABA treatment, found that EIBI produces strong effects, suggesting that it can be effective for some children with autism; it also found that the large effects might be an artifact of comparison groups with treatments that have yet to be empirically validated, and that no comparisons between EIBI and other widely recognized treatment programs have been published.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |title=Comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral interventions for young children with autism based on the UCLA Young Autism Project model |author=Reichow B, Wolery M |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0596-0 |pmid=18535894 }}</ref> A 2009 systematic review came to the same principal conclusion that EIBI is effective for some but not all children, with wide variability in response to treatment; it also suggested that any gains are likely to be greatest in the first year of intervention.<ref name=Howlin09>{{vcite journal |author=Howlin P, Magiati I, Charman T |title=Systematic review of early intensive behavioral interventions for children with autism |journal=Am J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |pmid=19143460 |doi=10.1352/2009.114:23-41 }}</ref> A 2009 [[meta-analysis]] concluded that EIBI has a large effect on full-scale intelligence and a moderate effect on adaptive behavior.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Eldevik S, Hastings RP, Hughes JC, Jahr E, Eikeseth S, Cross S |title=Meta-analysis of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for children with autism |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=439–50 |year=2009 |pmid=19437303 |doi=10.1080/15374410902851739 }}</ref> However, a 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis found that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Spreckley M, Boyd R |title=Efficacy of applied behavioral intervention in preschool children with autism for improving cognitive, language, and adaptive behavior: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J Pediatr |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=338–44 |year=2009 |pmid=18950798 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.09.012 }}</ref>

Recently behavior analysts have built comprehensive models of child development (see [[Behavior analysis of child development]]) to generate models for prevention as well as treatment for autism.

====Pivotal response therapy====
{{Main|Pivotal response therapy}}
Pivotal response therapy or treatment (PRT) is a naturalistic intervention derived from ABA principles. Instead of individual behaviors, it targets pivotal areas of a child's development, such as motivation, responsivity to multiple cues, self-management, and social initiations; it aims for widespread improvements in areas that are not specifically targeted. The child determines activities and objects that will be used in a PRT exchange. Intended attempts at the target behavior are rewarded with a natural reinforcer: for example, if a child attempts a request for a stuffed animal, the child receives the animal, not a piece of candy or other unrelated reinforcer.<ref>Pivotal response therapy:

====Aversive therapy====
The [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center]] uses [[aversion therapy]], notably contingent shock ([[electric shock]] delivered to the skin for a few seconds), to control the behavior of its patients, many of whom are autistic. The practice is controversial<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Mother Jones |volume=32 |issue=5 |year=2007 |title=School of shock |author=Gonnerman J |url=http://motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock.html |accessdate=2008-10-19 }}</ref> and has not been popular or used elsewhere since the 1990s.

===Communication interventions===
{{See also|Speech therapy|Picture Exchange Communication System}}
The inability to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, is a core deficit in Autism. Children with Autism are often engaged in repetitive activity or other behaviors because they cannot convey their intent any other way. They do not know how to communicate their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping a child with Autism learn to communicate their needs and ideas is absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be verbal or non-verbal. Children with Autism require intensive intervention to learn how to communicate their intent.

Communication interventions fall into two major categories. First, many autistic children do not speak, or have little speech, or have difficulties in effective use of language.<ref name="baojournal.com">{{vcite journal | author = Gillis J.M., Butler R.C. | year = 2007 | title = Social skills interventions for preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A description of single - subject design studies | url = | journal = Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 532–548 }}</ref> [[Social skills]] have been shown to be effective in treating children with autism.<ref name="baojournal.com"/> Interventions that attempt to improve communication are commonly conducted by speech and language therapists, and work on joint attention, communicative intent, and alternative or [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) methods such as visual methods.<ref name=SIGN/> AAC methods do not appear to impede speech and may result in modest gains.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |year=2008 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=212–30 |title=Effects of augmentative and alternative communication intervention on speech production in children with autism: a systematic review |author=Schlosser RW, Wendt O |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2008/021) |pmid=18663107 }}</ref> A 2006 study reported benefits both for joint attention intervention and for symbolic play intervention,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Kasari C, Freeman S, Paparella T |title=Joint attention and symbolic play in young children with autism: a randomized controlled intervention study |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=611–20 |year=2006 |pmid=16712638 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01567.x }} {{vcite journal |title=Erratum |date=2007 |quotes=no |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=523 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01768.x }}</ref> and a 2007 study found that joint attention intervention is more likely than symbolic play intervention to cause children to engage later in shared interactions.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Gulsrud AC, Kasari C, Freeman S, Paparella T |title=Children with autism's response to novel stimuli while participating in interventions targeting joint attention or symbolic play skills |journal=Autism |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=535–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17947289 |doi=10.1177/1362361307083255 }}</ref>

Second, [[social skills]] treatment attempts to increase social and communicative skills of autistic individuals, addressing a core deficit of autism. A wide range of intervention approaches is available, including modeling and reinforcement, adult and peer mediation strategies, peer tutoring, social games and stories, self-management, [[pivotal response therapy]], [[video modeling]], direct instruction, visual cuing, [[Circle of friends (disability)|Circle of Friends]] and social-skills groups.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Matson JL, Matson ML, Rivet TT |title=Social-skills treatments for children with autism spectrum disorders: an overview |journal=Behav Modif |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=682–707 |year=2007 |pmid=17699124 |doi=10.1177/0145445507301650 }}</ref> A 2007 meta-analysis of 55 studies of school-based social skills intervention found that they were minimally effective for children and adolescents with ASD,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Bellini S, Peters JK, Benner L, Hopf A |title=A meta-analysis of school-based social skills interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Remedial Spec Educ |volume=28 |issue=3 |date=2007 |pages=153–62 |doi=10.1177/07419325070280030401 }}</ref> and a 2007 review found that social skills training has minimal empirical support for children with [[Asperger syndrome]] or [[high-functioning autism]].<ref name=Rao>{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |date=2008 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=353–61 |title=Social skills interventions for children with Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism: a review and recommendations |author=Rao PA, Beidel DC, Murray MJ |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0402-4 |pmid=17641962 }}</ref>

====SCERTS====
The SCERTS model<ref name=Prizant>{{cite book|author=Barry M. Prizant et al|title=The SCERTS manual : a comprehensive educational approach for young children with autism spectrum disorders|year=2005|publisher=Paul H. Brookes|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=1-55766-818-3}}</ref> is an educational model for working with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was designed to help families, educators and therapists work cooperatively together to maximize progress in supporting the child.

The acronym refers to the focus on:

* SC - social communication - the development of functional communication and emotional expression.

* ER - emotional regulation - the development of well-regulated emotions and ability to cope with stress.

* TS - transactional support - the implementation of supports to help families, educators and therapists respond to children's needs, adapt the environment and provide tools to enhance learning.

===Relationship based, developmental models===
Relationship based models give importance to the relationships that help children reach and master early developmental milestones. These are often missed or not mastered in children with ASD. Examples of these early milestones are engagement and interest in the world, intimacy with a caregiver, intentionality of action.

====Relationship Development Intervention====
{{Main|Relationship Development Intervention}}
Relationship development intervention<ref name=Gutstein_2012>{{cite journal|last=Gutstein|first=S. E.|coauthors=Burgess, A. F., Montfort, K.|title=Evaluation of the Relationship Development Intervention Program|journal=Autism|date=1 September 2007|volume=11|issue=5|pages=397–411|doi=10.1177/1362361307079603|pmid=17942454}}</ref> is a family-based treatment program for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This program is based on the belief that the development of dynamic intelligence (the ability to think flexibly, take different perspectives, cope with change and process information simultaneously) is key to improving the quality of life of children with autism.

====Floortime/DIR====
{{advert|section|date=June 2012}}
{{Main|Floortime}}
The Floortime/DIR (Developmental, Individual Differences based, Relationship based ) approach is a developmental intervention to autism developed by [[Stanley Greenspan]] and Serena Weider. Its core precept is to understand the child's sensory differences, follow the child's lead and use these to encourage children with ASD to climb up the developmental ladder. This approach is based on the idea that the core deficits in autism are individual differences in the sensory system, motor planning problems, difficulties in communication and relation to others, and the inability to connect ones desire to intentional action and communication. When addressed through a combination of sensory support and DIR/Floortime techniques, the facilitator is playfully obstructive to redirect the child to play and relate to their therapist. Exponents of the floortime approach claim that children can thus become more social, less repetitive and also develop symbolic abilities.{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2011}}<ref>{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2011}} http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml</ref> However, these claims should be regarded with some scepticism, owing to a lack of independent scientific research into the efficacy of the floortime approach.

The DIR model is based on the model of a developmental 'tree', the central notion being that Autistic children have yet to master certain early developmental milestones, or 'branches' of the tree, which are as follows: 

*'''Stage One: Regulation and Interest in the World''': Being calm and feeling well enough to attend to a caregiver and surroundings. Have shared attention.
*'''Stage Two: Engagement and Relating''': Interest in another person and in the world, developing a special bond with preferred caregivers. Distinguishing inanimate objects from people.
*'''Stage Three: Two way intentional communication''': Simple back and forth interactions between child and caregiver. Smiles, tickles, anticipatory play.
*'''Stage Four: Social Problem solving''': Using gestures, interaction, babble to indicate needs, wants, pleasure, upset. Get a caregiver to help with a problem. Using pre-language skills to show intention.
*'''Stage Five: Symbolic Play''': Using words, pictures, symbols to communicate an intention, idea. Communicate ideas and thoughts, not just wants and needs.
*'''Stage Six: Bridging Ideas''': This stage is the foundation of logic, reasoning, emotional thinking and a sense of reality.

Exponents of the floortime approach argue that children with ASD struggle with or have missed some of these vital developmental stages. When these foundational abilities are strengthened through the child's lead and through meaningful play with a caregiver, children begin to climb up the developmental ladder. An introduction to DIR/Floortime can be found in the book - Engaging Autism: Using the Floortime Approach to Help Children Relate, Communicate, and Think, by [[Stanley Greenspan]], M.D. and Serena Wieder, PhD.

====The P.L.A.Y. Project (or PLAY Project)====
{{Main|The P.L.A.Y. Project}}
The P.L.A.Y. Project (or PLAY Project) <ref>[http://www.playproject.org The P.L.A.Y. Project website]</ref>(an acryonym for PLAY and Language for Autistic Youngsters) is a community-based, national autism training and early intervention program established in 2001 by Richard Solomon, MD.<ref>[http://www.playproject.org/about_drrick.php Richard Solomon, MD Founder of the P.L.A.Y. Project]</ref> Based on the DIR® (Developmental, Individualized, Relationship-based) theory of Stanley Greenspan MD, the program is designed to train parents and professionals to implement intensive, developmental interventions for young children (18 months to 6 years) with autism. The program is operating in nearly 100 agencies worldwide including 25 states and in 5 countries outside of the U.S. (Australia, Canada, England, Ireland and Switzerland). The PLAY Project has been operating since 2001 from its headquarters in Ann Arbor, MI.

In September 2009, The P.L.A.Y. Project received a $1.85 million grant <ref>http://www.annarbor.com/news/ann-arbor-based-play-project-awarded-18-million-for-autism-therapy-trial/</ref> from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to conduct a three-year controlled, clinical study of the P.L.A.Y. Project model. Drawing participants from five Easter Seals autism service locations, the study compares the outcomes of 60 children who participate in The P.L.A.Y. Project with the outcomes of 60 children who receive standard community interventions, making it the largest study of its kind. Before and after the 12-month intervention, each child is assessed with a battery of tests to measure developmental level, speech and language, sensory-motor profile, and social skills.

The results of previous research on the program were published by the peer-reviewed British journal, Autism <ref>Solomon, R., Necheles, J., Ferch, C., & Bruckman, D. (2007).

====Son-Rise====
{{Main|Son-Rise}}
Son-Rise is a home-based program that emphasizes on implementing a color- and sensory-free playroom. Before implementing the home-based program, an institute trains the parents how to accept their child without judgment through a series of dialogue sessions. Like Floortime, parents join their child's ritualistic behavior for relationship-building. To gain the child's "willing engagement", the facilitator continues to join them only this time through parallel play. Proponents claim that children will decide to become non-autistic after parents accept them for who they are and engage them in play. The program was started by the parents of [[Raun Kaufman]], who is claimed to have gone from being autistic to normal via the treatment in the early 1970s.<ref>{{vcite book |author=Kaufman BN |title=Son-Rise: the Miracle Continues |publisher=HJ Kramer |year=1995 |isbn=0-915811-61-8 }}</ref> No independent study has tested the efficacy of the program, but a 2003 study found that involvement with the program led to more drawbacks than benefits for the involved families over time,<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=J Intellect Disabil Res |year=2003 |volume=47 |issue=4–5 |pages=291–9 |title=The Son-Rise Program intervention for autism: an investigation into family experiences |author=Williams KR, Wishart JG |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2788.2003.00491.x |pmid=12787161 }}</ref> and a 2006 study found that the program is not always implemented as it is typically described in the literature, which suggests it will be difficult to evaluate its efficacy.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Autism |year=2006 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=86–102 |title=The Son-Rise Program intervention for autism: prerequisites for evaluation |author=Williams KR |doi=10.1177/1362361306062012 |pmid=16522712 }}</ref>

===TEACCH===
{{Main|Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children}}
Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), which has come to be called "structured teaching", emphasizes structure by using organized physical environments, predictably sequenced activities, visual schedules and visually structured activities, and structured work/activity systems where each child can practice various tasks.<ref name=CCD/> Parents are taught to implement the treatment at home. A 1998 controlled trial found that children treated with a TEACCH-based home program improved significantly more than a control group.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Ozonoff S, Cathcart K |title=Effectiveness of a home program intervention for young children with autism |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=25–32 |year=1998 |doi=10.1023/A:1026006818310 |pmid=9546299 }}</ref>

===Sensory integration===

Unusual responses to [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory stimuli]] are more common and prominent in children with autism, although there is not good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |date=2005 |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1255–68 |title=Annotation: what do we know about sensory dysfunction in autism?

Other treatments have been studied, with small positive outcomes, but few conclusions can be drawn due to methodological problems with the studies. These treatments include prism lenses, physical exercise, [[auditory integration training]], and sensory stimulation or inhibition techniques such as "deep pressure"—firm touch pressure applied either manually or via an apparatus such as a [[hug machine]] or a pressure garment.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2002 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=397–422 |title=Efficacy of sensory and motor interventions for children with autism |author=Baranek GT |doi=10.1023/A:1020541906063 |pmid=12463517 }}</ref> Weighted vests, a popular deep-pressure therapy, have only a limited amount of scientific research available, which on balance indicates that the therapy is ineffective.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |date=2009 |title=The use of weighted vests with children with autism spectrum disorders and other disabilities |author=Stephenson J, Carter M |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0605-3 |pmid=18592366 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=105–14 }}</ref> Although replicable treatments have been described and valid outcome measures are known, gaps exist in knowledge related to sensory integration dysfunction and therapy.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2005 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |title=Occupational therapy using a sensory integrative approach for children with developmental disabilities |author=Schaaf RC, Miller LJ |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20067 |pmid=15977314 }}</ref> Because empirical support is limited, systematic evaluation is needed if these interventions are used.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Can J Occup Ther |date=2007 |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=393–400 |title=Somatosensory stimulation interventions for children with autism: literature review and clinical considerations |author=Hodgetts S, Hodgetts W |pmid=18183774 |doi=10.2182/cjot.07.013}}</ref>

The term Sensory integration in simple terms means the ability to use all of ones senses to accomplish a task. Occupational Therapists sometimes prescribe sensory treatments for children with Autism however in general there has been little or no scientific evidence of effectiveness.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

A 2008 book [[My Stroke of Insight]] by Jill Bolte Taylor gives some insight, from a brain researcher's point of view, on what sensory dysfunction feels like. Other books on sensory integration include The Out of Sync Child - Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Processing Disorder by Carol Kranowitz and Lucy Jane Miller.

===Massage therapy===
A review of [[massage therapy]] as a symptomatic treatment of autism found limited evidence of benefit.  There were few high quality studies, and due to the risk of [[bias]] found in the studies analyzed, no firm conclusions about the efficacy of massage therapy could be drawn.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee MS, Kim JI, Ernst E |title=Massage therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=406–11 |year=2011 |month=March |pmid=21208598 |doi=10.4088/JCP.09r05848whi |url=}}</ref>

===Music===
[[Music therapy]] uses the elements of music to let people express their feelings and communicate. Two small studies have reported short-term improvement in verbal and gestural communication skills of children with autism from a week's work of daily sessions; no significant effects on behavior problems were observed.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Gold C, Wigram T, Elefant C |title=Music therapy for autistic spectrum disorder |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=2 |pages=CD004381 |year=2006 |pmid=16625601 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004381.pub2 }}</ref>

===Animal-assisted therapy===
[[Animal-assisted therapy]], where an animal such as a dog or a horse becomes a basic part of a person's treatment, is a controversial treatment for some symptoms. A 2007 [[meta-analysis]] found that animal-assisted therapy is associated with a moderate improvement in autism spectrum symptoms.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Anthrozoos |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=225–38 |date=2007 |author=Nimer J, Lundahl B |title=Animal-assisted therapy: a meta-analysis |doi=10.2752/089279307X224773 }}</ref> [[Review]]s of published [[dolphin]]-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT is a legitimate therapy or that it affords any more than fleeting improvements in mood.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Anthrozoos |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=239–49 |date=2007 |doi=10.2752/089279307X224782 |author=Marino L, Lilienfeld SO |title=Dolphin-Assisted Therapy: more flawed data and more flawed conclusions |url=http://www.marineconnection.org/docs/DAT%20Paper%202007.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-20 }}</ref>

===Neurofeedback===
[[Neurofeedback]] attempts to train individuals to regulate their brainwave patterns by letting them observe their brain activity more directly. In its most traditional form, the output of EEG electrodes is fed into a computer that controls a game-like audiovisual display. Neurofeedback has been evaluated with positive results for ASD, but studies have lacked random assignment to controls.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Coben R, Linden M, Myers TE |title=Neurofeedback for autistic spectrum disorder: a review of the literature |journal=Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=83–105 |year=2010 |pmid=19856096 |doi=10.1007/s10484-009-9117-y }}</ref>

===Patterning===
Patterning is a set of exercises that attempts to improve the organization of a child's neurologic impairments. It has been used for decades to treat children with several unrelated neurologic disorders, including autism. The method, taught at the [[The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential]], is based on oversimplified theories and is not supported by carefully designed research studies.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=1999 |volume=104 |issue=5 |pages=1149–51 |title=The treatment of neurologically impaired children using patterning |author=American Academy of Pediatrics.

===Packing===
In packing, children are wrapped tightly for up to an hour in wet sheets that have been refrigerated, with only their heads left free. The treatment is repeated several times a week, and can continue for years. It is intended as treatment for autistic children who harm themselves; most of these children cannot speak. Similar envelopment techniques have been used for centuries, such as to calm violent patients in Germany in the 19th century; its modern use in France began in the 1960s, based on psychoanalytic theories such as the theory of the [[Refrigerator mother theory|refrigerator mother]]. Packing is currently used in hundreds of French clinics. There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of packing, and some concern about risk of adverse health effects.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Lancet |date=2007 |volume=370 |issue=9588 |pages=645–6 |title=Therapy for autistic children causes outcry in France |author=Spinney L |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61322-1 |pmid=17726792 }}</ref>

==Medical management==

Drugs, supplements, or diets are often used to alter physiology in an attempt to relieve common autistic symptoms such as seizures, sleep disturbances, irritability, and hyperactivity that can interfere with education or social adaptation or (more rarely) cause autistic individuals to harm themselves or others.<ref name=Levy/> There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support medical treatment; many parents who try one or more therapies report some progress, and there are a few well-publicized reports of children who are able to return to mainstream education after treatment, with dramatic improvements in health and well-being. However, this evidence may be confounded by improvements seen in autistic children who grow up without treatment, by the difficulty of verifying reports of improvements, and by the lack of reporting of treatments' negative outcomes.<ref>{{vcite book |author=Schreibman L |title=The Science and Fiction of Autism |date=2005 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-01931-8 |chapter=Critical evaluation of issues in autism |chapterurl=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/SCHSCI_excerpt.pdf }}</ref> Only a very few medical treatments are well supported by scientific evidence using controlled experiments.<ref name=Levy/>

===Dietary supplements===

Many parents give their children [[dietary supplement]]s in an attempt to treat autism or to alleviate its symptoms. The range of supplements given is wide; few are supported by scientific data, but most have relatively mild side effects.<ref name=Angley2/><ref name=Levy/>

A review found some low-quality evidence to support the use of [[vitamin B6]] in combination with [[magnesium]] at high doses, but the evidence was equivocal and the review noted the possible danger of fatal [[hypermagnesemia]].<ref>{{cite pmid | 19917212 }}</ref>  A [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane Review]] of the evidence for the use of B6 and magnesium found that "[d]ue to the small number of studies, the methodological quality of studies, and small sample sizes, no recommendation can be advanced regarding the use of B6-Mg as a treatment for autism."<ref>{{cite pmid | 16235322 }}</ref>

[[Dimethylglycine]] (DMG) is hypothesized to improve speech and reduce autistic behaviors,<ref name=Angley2/> and is a commonly used supplement.<ref name=Levy/> Two double-blind, [[placebo]]-controlled studies found no statistically significant effect on autistic behaviors,<ref name=Angley2/> and reported few side effects. No peer-reviewed studies have addressed treatment with the related compound [[trimethylglycine]].<ref name=Levy/>

[[Vitamin C]] decreased stereotyped behavior in a small 1993 study. The study has not been replicated, and vitamin C has limited popularity as an autism treatment. High doses might cause kidney stones or gastrointestinal upset such as diarrhea.<ref name=Levy/>

[[Probiotic]]s containing potentially beneficial [[bacteria]] are hypothesized to relieve some symptoms of autism by minimizing [[Candidiasis|yeast overgrowth]] in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. The hypothesized yeast overgrowth has not been confirmed by [[endoscopy]], the mechanism connecting yeast overgrowth to autism is only hypothetical, and no clinical trials to date have been published in the peer-reviewed literature. No negative side effects have been reported.<ref name=Levy>{{vcite journal |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2005 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=131–42 |title=Novel treatments for autistic spectrum disorders |author=Levy SE, Hyman SL |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20062 |pmid=15977319 }}</ref>

[[Melatonin]] is sometimes used to manage sleep problems in developmental disorders. Adverse effects are generally reported to be mild, including drowsiness, headache, dizziness, and nausea; however, an increase in seizure frequency is reported among susceptible children.<ref name=Angley2/> A 2008 open trial found that melatonin appears to be a safe and well-tolerated treatment for [[insomnia]] in children with ASD. and suggested controlled trials to determine efficacy;<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=J Child Neurol |date=2008 |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=482–5 |title=Melatonin for insomnia in children with autism spectrum disorders |author=Andersen IM, Kaczmarska J, McGrew SG, Malow BA |pmid=18182647 |doi=10.1177/0883073807309783 }}</ref> a small 2009 retrospective study had similar results for adults.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Galli-Carminati G, Deriaz N, Bertschy G |title=Melatonin in treatment of chronic sleep disorders in adults with autism: a retrospective study |journal=Swiss Med Wkly |volume=139 |issue=19–20 |pages=293–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19452292 |url=http://www.smw.ch/docs/PdfContent/smw-12342.pdf |format=PDF |doi=<!--Work around Citation bot bug.--> }}</ref>

Although [[omega-3]] fatty acids, which are [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFA), are a popular treatment for children with ASD, there is very little scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Bent S, Bertoglio K, Hendren RL |title=Omega-3 fatty acids for autistic spectrum disorder: a systematic review |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=8 |pages=1145–54 |year=2009 |pmid=19333748 |doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0724-5 |pmc=2710498 }}</ref> and further research is needed.<ref name=CCD/>

In the early 1990s, it was hypothesized that autism can be caused or aggravated by [[opioid peptide]]s like [[casomorphine]] that are metabolic products of [[gluten]] and [[casein]].<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Reichelt KL, Knivsberg A-M, Lind G, Nødland M |title=Probable etiology and possible treatment of childhood autism |journal=Brain Dysfunct |year=1991 |volume=4 |pages=308–19 }}</ref> Based on this hypothesis, diets that eliminate foods containing either gluten or casein, or both, are widely promoted, and many testimonials can be found describing benefits in autism-related symptoms, notably social engagement and verbal skills. Studies supporting these claims have had significant flaws, so these data are inadequate to guide treatment recommendations.<ref name=Christison>{{vcite journal |journal=J Dev Behav Pediatr |date=2006 |volume=27 |issue=2 Suppl 2 |pages=S162–71 |title=Elimination diets in autism spectrum disorders: any wheat amidst the chaff? |title.= |author=Christison GW, Ivany K |pmid=16685183 |doi=10.1097/00004703-200604002-00015 }}</ref><ref>{{vcite journal |author=Millward C, Ferriter M, Calver S, Connell-Jones G |title=Gluten- and casein-free diets for autistic spectrum disorder |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |year=2008 |issue=2 |pages=CD003498 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003498.pub3 |pmid=18425890 }}</ref>

Other [[elimination diet]]s have also been proposed, targeting [[salicylates]], [[food dye]]s, [[yeast]], and simple sugars. No scientific evidence has established the efficacy of such diets in treating autism in children. An elimination diet may create nutritional deficiencies that harm overall health unless care is taken to assure proper nutrition.<ref name=Angley2/> For example, a 2008 study found that autistic boys on casein-free diets have significantly thinner bones than usual, presumably because the diets contribute to calcium and [[Vitamin_D#Deficiency|vitamin D deficiencies]].<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |date=2008 |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=848–56 |title=Reduced bone cortical thickness in boys with autism or autism spectrum disorder |author=Hediger ML, England LJ, Molloy CA, Yu KF, Manning-Courtney P, Mills JL |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0453-6 |pmid=17879151 |laysummary=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2008/nichd-29.htm |laysource=NIH News |laydate=2008-01-29 }}</ref>

===Chelation therapy===
Based on the speculation that [[heavy metals|heavy metal poisoning]] may trigger the symptoms of autism, particularly in small subsets of individuals who cannot excrete toxins effectively, some parents have turned to [[alternative medicine]] practitioners who provide detoxification treatments via [[chelation therapy]]. However, evidence to support this practice has been [[anecdote|anecdotal]] and not rigorous. Strong [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence refutes links between environmental triggers, in particular [[thimerosal]] containing [[vaccine]]s, and the onset of autistic symptoms.

[[Craniosacral therapy]] is an alternative medical practice whose main hypothesis is that restrictions at [[cranial sutures]] of the skull affect rhythmic impulses conveyed via [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and that gentle pressure on external areas can improve the flow and balance of the supply of this fluid to the brain, relieving symptoms of many conditions.<ref name=Green/> There is no scientific support for major elements of the underlying model,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Hartman SE, Norton JM |year=2002 |title=Interexaminer reliability and cranial osteopathy |journal=Sci Rev Alt Med |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–34 |url=http://faculty.une.edu/com/shartman/sram.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-10-08 }}</ref> there is little scientific evidence to support the therapy, and research methods that could conclusively evaluate the therapy's effectiveness have not been applied.<ref name=Green>{{vcite journal |journal=Complement Ther Med |year=1999 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=201–7 |title=A systematic review of craniosacral therapy: biological plausibility, assessment reliability and clinical effectiveness |author=Green C, Martin CW, Bassett K, Kazanjian A |doi=10.1016/S0965-2299(99)80002-8 |pmid=10709302 }} An earlier version of the paper is available without a subscription: {{Cite journal |title=A systematic review and critical appraisal of the scientific evidence on craniosacral therapy |author=Green C, Martin CW, Bassett K, Kazanjian A |url=http://chspr.ubc.ca/files/publications/1999/bco99-01J_cranio.pdf |format=PDF |year=1999 |accessdate=2007-10-08 |version=BCOHTA 99:1J |publisher=British Columbia Office of Health Technology Assessment }}</ref> No published studies are available on the use of this therapy for autism.<ref name=Levy2008>{{vcite journal |author=Levy SE, Hyman SL |title=Complementary and alternative medicine treatments for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=803–20, ix |year=2008 |pmid=18775371 |pmc=2597185 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2008.06.004 }}</ref>

===Electroconvulsive therapy===
Studies indicate that 12–17% of adolescents and young adults with autism satisfy diagnostic criteria for [[catatonia]], which is loss of or hyperactive motor activity. [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has been used to treat cases of catatonia and related conditions in people with autism. However, no controlled trials have been performed of ECT in autism, and there are serious ethical and legal obstacles to its use.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Dhossche DM, Reti IM, Wachtel LE |title=Catatonia and autism: a historical review, with implications for electroconvulsive therapy |journal=J ECT |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=19–22 |year=2009 |pmid=19190507 |doi=10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181957363 }}</ref>

===Hyperbaric oxygen therapy===
[[File:FatherandSoninChamber.jpg#Summary|thumb|A boy with ASD, and his father, in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.]]

One small 2009 double-blind study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided significant improvement in the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Rossignol DA, Rossignol LW, Smith S ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Hyperbaric treatment for children with autism: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial |journal=BMC Pediatrics |year=2009 |volume=9 |page=21 |pmid=19284641 |doi=10.1186/1471-2431-9-21 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2431-9-21.pdf |format=PDF |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7940149.stm |laysource=BBC News |laydate=2009-03-14 |pmc=2662857 }}</ref> More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 double-blind study compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were used to evaluate the treatment. No differences were found between the HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures.<ref>Granpeesheh, D., Tarbox, J., Dixon, D. R., Wilke, A. E., Allen, M. S., & Bradstreet, J. (2010). Randomized trial of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for children with autism. Research In Autism Spectrum Disorders, 4(2), 268-275. {{doi|10.1016/j.rasd.2009.09.014}}</ref> A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant.<ref name="Jepson">Jepson, B., Granpeesheh, D., Tarbox, J., Olive, M. L., Stott, C., Braud, S., & ... Allen, M. S. (2011). Controlled evaluation of the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on the behavior of 16 children with autism spectrum disorders. Journal Of Autism And Developmental Disorders, 41(5), 575-588. {{doi|10.1007/s10803-010-1075-y}}</ref> Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.

Nonetheless, news reports and related blogs indicate that HBOT is used for many cases of children with autism. HBOT can cost up to $150 per hour with individuals using anywhere from 40 to 120 hours as a part of their integrated treatment programs. In addition, purchasing (at $8,495–27,995) and renting ($1,395 per month) of the HBOT chambers is another option some families use.<ref name="Jepson" /> When considering the financial and time investments required in order to participate in this treatment and the inconsistency of the present findings, HBOT seems to be a riskier and thus, often less favorable alternative treatment for autism. Further studies are needed in order for practitioners and families to make more conclusive and valid decisions concerning HBOT treatments.<ref>Rossignol, Daniel A., Lanier W. Rossignol, S.

===Prosthetics===
Unlike conventional neuromotor [[prostheses]], neurocognitive prostheses would sense or modulate neural function in order to physically reconstitute cognitive processes such as [[executive function]] and language. No neurocognitive prostheses are currently available but the development of implantable neurocognitive brain-computer interfaces has been proposed to help treat conditions such as autism.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Behav Brain Res |date=2008 |title=Techniques and devices to restore cognition |author=Serruya MD, Kahana MJ |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.04.007 |pmid=18539345 |volume=192 |issue=2 |pages=149–65 |pmc=3051349}}</ref>

[[Affective computing]] devices, typically with image or voice recognition capabilities, have been proposed to help autistic individuals improve their social communication skills.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Learning |date=2003 |title=The Internet for educating individuals with social impairments |volume=19 |issue=4 |author=Bishop J |doi=10.1046/j.0266-4909.2003.00057.x |pages=546–56 }}</ref> These devices are still under development.

===Stem cell therapy===

[[Mesenchymal stem cells]] and [[cord blood]] [[CD34]]+ cells have been proposed to treat autism, but this proposal has not been tested.<ref name=Ichim>{{vcite journal |journal=J Transl Med |year=2007 |volume=5 |issue=30 |title=Stem cell therapy for autism |author=Ichim TE, Solano F, Glenn E ''et al.'' |author.= |doi=10.1186/1479-5876-5-30 |pmid=17597540 |url=http://translational-medicine.com/content/5/1/30 |pages=30 |pmc=1914111 }}</ref> Since immune system deregulation has been implicated in autism, mesenchymal stem cells show the greatest promise as treatment for the disorder. Changes in the innate and adaptive immune system have been observed. Those with autism show an imbalance in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, as well as in NK cells.<ref name=Siniscalco>{{cite journal|last=Siniscalco|first=Dario|coauthors=Sapone, Anna, Cirillo, Alessandra, Giordano, Catia, Maione, Sabatino, Antonucci, Nicola|title=Autism Spectrum Disorders: Is Mesenchymal Stem Cell Personalized Therapy the Future?|journal=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology|date=1 January 2012|volume=2012|pages=1–6|doi=10.1155/2012/480289}}</ref> In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) overproduce IL-1β.<ref name=Siniscalco/> MSC mediated immune suppressive activity could restore this immune imbalance.

===Alternative medicine===
[[Acupuncture]] has not been found to be helpful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cheuk|first=DK|coauthors=Wong, V, Chen, WX|title=Acupuncture for autism spectrum disorders (ASD)|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2011 Sep 7|volume=9|pages=CD007849|pmid=21901712|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007849.pub2|editor1-last=Cheuk|editor1-first=Daniel KL|issue=9}}</ref>

==Religious interventions==

The ''[[Table Talk (Luther)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]] contains the story of a twelve-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality |author=Wing L }}</ref> According to Luther's notetaker [[Johannes Mathesius|Mathesius]], Luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh [[Demonic possession|possessed by the devil]], and suggested that he be suffocated.<ref>{{vcite web |author=Miles M |year=2005 |title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say? |title.= |publisher=Independent Living Institute |url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |accessdate=2008-12-23 }}</ref> In 2003, an autistic boy in Wisconsin suffocated during an [[exorcism]] in which he was wrapped in sheets.<ref>{{vcite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/08/25/national/main570077.shtml |title=Autistic boy dies during exorcism |author=Collins D |date=2003-08-25 |work=CBS News }}</ref> Some [[Pentecostal]] and [[charismatic movement|charismatic]] Christians believe that autism is the result of a "generational curse" visited upon a child for the sins of a parent, and can be cured through repentance and divine healing.

Ultraorthodox Jewish parents sometimes use spiritual and mystical interventions such as prayers, blessings, recitations of religious text, holy water, amulets, changing the child's name, and exorcism.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Shaked M, Bilu Y |title=Grappling with affliction: autism in the Jewish ultraorthodox community in Israel |journal=Cult Med Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |year=2006 |pmid=16783528 |doi=10.1007/s11013-006-9006-2 }}</ref>

One study has suggested that [[spirituality]] and not [[religious activities]] involving the mothers of autistic children were associated with better outcomes for the child.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Ekas NV, Whitman TL, Shivers C |date=2009 |title=Religiosity, spirituality, and socioemotional functioning in mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=706–19 |pmid=19082877 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0673-4 }}</ref>

==Anti-cure perspective==
{{further2|[[Autism rights movement#Anti-cure perspective|Autism rights movement]]}}
The exact [[causes of autism|cause of autism]] is unclear, yet some organizations advocate researching a cure. Some autism rights organizations view autism as a way of life rather than as a disease and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.<ref name=Harmon>{{cite news |last=Harmon |first=Amy |title=How About Not 'Curing' Us, Some Autistics Are Pleading |date=2004-12-20 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |accessdate=2007-11-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071116181504/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html?| archivedate= 16 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=SanerDisease>{{cite news |author=Saner E |title=It is not a disease, it is a way of life |work=The Guardian |date=2007-08-07 |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/health/story/0,,2143123,00.html |accessdate=2007-08-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070820055604/http://society.guardian.co.uk/health/story/0,,2143123,00.html| archivedate= 20 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
