'''Cyanotoxins''' are [[toxin]]s produced by bacteria called [[cyanobacteria]] (also known as blue-green algae). Cyanobacteria are found almost everywhere, but particularly in lakes and in the ocean where, under certain conditions, they [[exponential growth|reproduce exponentially]] to form [[Algal bloom|blooms]]. Blooming cyanobacteria can produce cyanotoxins in such concentrations that they [[poison]] and even kill animals and humans. Cyanotoxins can also accumulate in other animals such as fish and [[shellfish]], and cause poisonings such as [[shellfish poisoning]].

Among cyanotoxins are some of the most powerful natural poisons known, including poisons which can cause rapid death by respiratory failure.<ref name=Stewartetal>{{cite journal | author = Stewart I, Seawright AA, Shaw GR | year = 2008 | title = Cyanobacterial poisoning in livestock, wild mammals and birds – an overview | url = http://www.epa.gov/cyano_habs_symposium/monograph/Ch28.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms: State of the Science and Research Needs | volume = 619 | issue = | pages = 613–637 | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-75865-7_28 | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | isbn = 978-0-387-75864-0 }}</ref> The toxins include potent [[neurotoxins]], [[hepatotoxins]], [[cytotoxins]], and [[endotoxins]].

The first published report that blue-green algae or cyanobacteria could have lethal effects appeared in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1878. George Francis described the algal bloom he observed in the estuary of the [[Murray River]] in Australia, as "a thick scum like green oil paint, some two to six inches thick." Wildlife which drank the water died rapidly and terribly.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Francis G | year = 1878 | title = Poisonous Australian Lake | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v18/n444/abs/018011d0.html | journal = Nature | volume = 18 | issue = 444| pages = 11–12 | doi = 10.1038/018011d0 |bibcode = 1878Natur..18...11F }}</ref> Most reported incidents of poisoning by microalgal toxins have occurred in freshwater environments, and they are becoming more common and widespread.

==Cyanobacteria==
{{main|Cyanobacteria}}

Cyanotoxins are produced by [[cyanobacteria]], a [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[bacteria]] that obtain their energy through [[photosynthesis]]. The prefix ''[[cyan]]'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κύανoς meaning "a dark blue substance",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Fanos κύανος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and usually indicates any of a number of colours in the blue/green range of the spectrum. Cyanobacteria are commonly referred to as ''blue-green algae''. Traditionally they were thought of as a form of algae, and were introduced as such in older textbooks. However modern sources tend to regard this as outdated;<ref name="IntroBot">{{cite book|last=Nabors|first=Murray W.|year=2004|title=Introduction to Botany|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-8053-4416-0}}</ref> they are now considered to be more closely related to bacteria,<ref>Ed.

Cyanobacteria are found almost everywhere; in oceans, lakes and rivers as well as on land. They flourish in Arctic and Antarctic lakes,<ref>Skulberg OM (1996) "Terrestrial and limnic algae and cyanobacteria".

==Harmful algal blooms==
{{further2|[[algal bloom]]|[[red tide]]|[[eutrophication]]}}
[[File:Potomac river eutro.jpg|thumb|right|Dense bloom of cyanobacteria on the [[Potomac River]] estuary. These blooms can be toxic.]]

Cyanotoxins are often implicated in what are commonly called ''[[red tide]]s'' or ''harmful algal blooms''. Lakes and oceans contain many single-celled organisms called [[phytoplankton]]. Under certain conditions, particularly when nutrient concentrations are high, these organisms [[exponential growth|reproduce exponentially]]. The resulting dense swarm of phytoplankton is called an [[algal bloom]]; these can cover hundreds of square kilometres and can be easily seen in satellite images. Individual phytoplankton rarely live more than a few days, but blooms can last weeks.<ref>Lindsey R and Scott M (2010) [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Phytoplankton/page1.php What are phytoplankton] [[NASA Earth Observatory]].</ref><ref name=NOAA_HAB>[http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf Harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes] 2009, [[NOAA]], Center of Excellence for Great Lakes and Human Health.</ref> 

Generally these blooms are harmless, but if not they are called [[harmful algal bloom]]s, or HABs. HABs can contain toxins or pathogens which result in [[fish kill]] and can also be fatal to humans.<ref name=NOAA_HAB /> In marine environments, HABs are mostly caused by [[dinoflagellate]]s,<ref name=Stewart&Falconer>Stewart I and Falconer IR (2008) [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=c6J5hlcjFaAC&pg=PA271&dq=%22Cyanobacteria+and+cyanobacterial+toxins%22&hl=en&ei=rKM4TeKBLIrmvQPKu_SICg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Cyanobacteria%20and%20cyanobacterial%20toxins%22&f=false "Cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial toxins"] Pages 271–296 in ''Oceans and human health: risks and remedies from the seas'', Eds: Walsh PJ, Smith SL and Fleming LE. Academic Press, ISBN 0-12-372584-4.</ref> though species of other algae taxa can also cause HABs ([[diatom]]s, [[flagellate]]s, [[haptophyte]]s and [[raphidophyte]]s).<ref>Moestrup Ø, Akselman R, Cronberg G, Elbraechter M, Fraga S, Halim Y, Hansen G, Hoppenrath M, Larsen J, Lundholm N, Nguyen LN and Zingone A. [http://www.marinespecies.org/hab/ "IOC-UNESCO Taxonomic Reference List of Harmful Micro Algae (HABs)"]  Accessed 21 January 2011.</ref> Marine dinoflagellate species are often toxic, but freshwater species are not known to be toxic. Neither are diatoms known to be toxic, at least to humans.<ref name=Vasconcelos />

[[Cyanobacteria]] also commonly produce blooms and HABs.<ref name=Stewart&Falconer /> Cyanobacteria species are often toxic, and in freshwater ecosystems are the most common cause of [[eutrophication]]. Their blooms can look like foam, scum or mats or like paint floating on the surface of the water, but they are not always visible. Nor are the blooms always green; they can be blue, and some cyanobacteria species are  coloured brownish-red. The water can become malodorous when the cyanobacterial in the bloom die.<ref name=NOAA_HAB />

Strong cyanobacterial blooms reduce visibility to one or two centimetres. Species which do not need to see to [[Diel vertical migration|migrate]] in the [[water column]] (such as the cyanobacteria themselves) survive, but species which need to see to find food and partners are compromised. During the day blooming cyanobacteria saturate the water with oxygen. At night respiring aquatic organisms can deplete the oxygen to the point where sensitive species, such as certain fish, die. This is more likely to happen near the sea floor or a [[thermocline]]. Water acidity also cycles daily during a bloom, with the pH reaching 9 or more during the day and dropping to low values at night, further stressing the ecosystem. In addition, many cyanobacteria species produce potent cyanotoxins which concentrate during a bloom to the point where they become lethal to nearby aquatic organisms and any other animals in direct contact with the bloom, including birds, livestock, domestic animals and sometimes humans.<ref name=Vasconcelos>{{cite journal | author = Vasconcelos V | year = 2006 | title = Eutrophication, toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins: when ecosystems cry for help | url = http://www.limnetica.net/Limnetica/limne25a/L25a425_Eutrophication_toxic_cyanobacteria_cyanotoxins.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Limnetica | volume = 25 | issue = 1–2| pages = 425–432 }}</ref>

==Chemical structure==
The chemical structure of cyanotoxins falls into three broad groups: cyclic peptides, alkaloids 
and lipopolysaccharides.<ref name=Chorus&Bartram />

Most cyanotoxins have a number of variants ([[chemical analog|analogues]]). Altogether over 84 cyanotoxins are known although only a small number have been well studied.<ref name=Sinonen&Jones>Sinonen K and Jones G (1999) [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/resourcesquality/toxicyanbact/en/ "Cyanobacterial Toxins"] In ''Toxic Cyanobacteria in Water.'' Chorus I and Bartram J (eds): 41-111. WHO, Geneva.</ref>

==Cyclic peptides==
A [[peptide]] is a short [[polymer]] of [[amino acid]]s linked by [[peptide bond]]s. They have the same chemical structure as [[protein]]s, except they are shorter. In a [[cyclic peptide]] the links link back to the start to form a stable circular chain. In mammals this stability makes them resistant to the process of digestion and they can [[bioaccumulate]] in the liver. Of all the cyanotoxins, the cyclic peptides are of most concern to human health. The microcystins and nodularins poison the liver, and exposure to high doses can cause death. Exposure to low doses in drinking water over a long period of time may promote liver and other tumours.<ref name=Chorus&Bartram />

===Microcystins===
[[File:Microcystin-LR.png|thumb|[[Microcystin LR]]]]

As with other cyanotoxins, [[microcystin]]s were named after the first organism discovered to produce them, ''Microcystis aeruginosa''. However it was later found other cyanobacterial genera also produced them.<ref name=Chorus&Bartram /> There are about 60 known variants of microcystin, and several of these can be produced during a bloom. The most reported variant is microcystin-''LR'', possible because the earliest commercially available chemical standard analysis was for [[microcystin-LR|microcystin-''LR'']].<ref name=Chorus&Bartram>Chorus & Bartram, 1999</ref> 

Blooms containing microcystin are a problem worldwide in freshwater ecosystems.<ref>Pelaez M et al, 2010</ref> Microcystins are cyclic peptides and can be very toxic for plants and animals including humans. They bioaccumulate in the [[liver]] of fish, in the [[hepatopancreas]] of mussels, and in zooplankton. They are [[hepatotoxic]] and can cause serious damage to the liver in humans.<ref name=Chorus&Bartram /> In this way they are similar to the nodularins (below), and together the microcystins and nodularins account for most of the toxic cyanobacterial blooms in fresh and brackish waters.<ref name=Sinonen&Jones /> In 2010, a number of sea otters were reported as having been poisoned by microcystin. Marine bivalves were the likely source of hepatotoxic [[shellfish poisoning]]. This is the first confirmed example of mammals in a marine environment dying from ingesting a cyanotoxin.<ref name=Milleretal>{{cite journal | author = Miller MA, Kudela RM, Mekebri A, Crane D, Oates SC ''et al.'' | year = 2010 | title = Evidence for a Novel Marine Harmful Algal Bloom: Cyanotoxin (Microcystin) Transfer from Land to Sea Otters | url = http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012576 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 9| page = e12576 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012576 | editor1-last = Thompson | editor1-first = Ross | pmid=20844747 | pmc=2936937}}</ref>

===Nodularins===
[[File:Nodularin R.svg|thumb|[[Nodularin-R]]]]

The first nodularin variant to be identified was [[nodularin-R]], produced by the cyanobacterium ''[[Nodularia|Nodularia spumigena]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sivonen K, Kononen K, Carmichael WW, Dahlem AM, Rinehart KL, Kiviranta J, Niemela SI |title=Occurrence of the hepatotoxic cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena in the Baltic Sea and structure of the toxin |journal=Appl.

Globally, the most common toxins present in cyanobacterial blooms in fresh and brackish waters are the cyclic peptide toxins of the nodularin family. Like the microcystin family (above), nodularins are potent hepatotoxins and can cause serious damage to the liver. They present health risks for wild and domestic animals as well as humans, and in many areas pose major challenges for the provision of safe drinking water.<ref name=Sinonen&Jones />

==Alkaloids==
[[Alkaloid]]s are a group of naturally occurring [[chemical compound]]s which mostly contain [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[nitrogen]] atoms. They are produced by a large variety of organisms, including cyanobacteria, and are part of the group of [[natural product]]s, also called [[secondary metabolite]]s. Alkaloids act on diverse metabolic systems in humans and other animals, often with [[psychotropic]] or toxic effects. Almost uniformly, they are [[Bitter (taste)#Bitterness|bitter tasting]].<ref name=Rhoades1979>{{cite book|year=1979 |author=Rhoades, David F |chapter=Evolution of Plant Chemical Defense against Herbivores |editor=Rosenthal, Gerald A., and Janzen, Daniel H|title=Herbivores: Their Interaction with Secondary Plant Metabolites |place=New York |publisher=Academic Press |page=41 |isbn=0-12-597180-X}}</ref>

===Anatoxin-''a''===
[[File:Anatoxin-a.png|thumb|140px|right|[[Anatoxin-a|Anatoxin-''a'']]]]

Investigations into [[Anatoxin-a|anatoxin-''a'']], also known as "Very Fast Death Factor", began in 1961 following the deaths of cows that drank from a lake containing an algal bloom in Saskatchewan, Canada.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Carmichael WW, Gorham PR | year = 1978 | title = Anatoxins from clones of Anabaena flos-aquae isolated from lakes of western Canada."

ISBN 978-0-549-35451-2.</ref>

Toxic effects from anatoxin-''a'' progress very rapidly because it acts directly on the nerve cells ([[neuron]]s) as a [[neurotoxin]]. The progressive symptoms of anatoxin-''a'' exposure are loss of coordination, [[Fasciculation|twitching]], convulsions and rapid death by [[respiratory paralysis]]. The nerve tissues which communicate with muscles contain a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] called the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]. Stimulation of these receptors causes a [[muscular contraction]]. The anatoxin-''a'' molecule is shaped so it fits this receptor, and in this way it mimics the natural [[neurotransmitter]] normally used by the receptor, [[acetylcholine]]. Once it has triggered a contraction, anatoxin-''a'' does not allow the neurons to return to their resting state, because it is not degraded by [[cholinesterase]] which normally performs this function. As a result the muscle cells contract permanently, the communication between the brain and the muscles is disrupted and breathing stops.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wood S. A., Rasmussen J.

===Cylindrospermopsins===
[[File:Cylindrospermopsin.png|thumb|140px|right|[[Cylindrospermopsin]]]]

[[Cylindrospermopsin]] (abbreviated to CYN or CYL) was first discovered after an outbreak of a mystery disease on [[Palm Island, Queensland|Palm Island]] in Australia.<ref name=Byth1980>{{cite journal |author=Byth S |title=Palm Island mystery disease |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=40, 42 |year=1980 |month=July |pmid=7432268}}</ref> The outbreak was traced back to a bloom of ''Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii'' in the local drinking water supply, and the toxin was subsequently identified. Analysis of the toxin led to a proposed [[chemical structure]] in 1992, which was revised after [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] was achieved in 2000. Several variants of cylindrospermopsin, both toxic and non-toxic, have been isolated or synthesised.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Griffiths DJ, Saker ML | year = 2003 | title = The Palm Island mystery disease 20 years on: a review of research on the cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin | url = | journal = Environ Toxicol | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 78–93 | pmid = 12635096 | doi = 10.1002/tox.10103 }}</ref>

===Saxitoxins===
[[File:Saxitoxin.svg|thumb|140px|[[Saxitoxin]]]]

[[Saxitoxin]] (STX) is one of the most potent natural [[neurotoxin]]s known. The term saxitoxin originates from the species name of the butter clam (''[[Saxidomus]] giganteus'') whereby it was first recognized. Saxitoxin is produced by the cyanobacteria ''[[Anabaena]]'' spp., some ''[[Aphanizomenon]]'' spp., ''[[Cylindrospermopsis]]'' sp., ''[[Lyngbya]]'' sp. and ''[[Planktothrix]]'' sp.).<ref name="uhm">{{cite journal |author=Clark RF, Williams SR, Nordt SP, Manoguerra AS |title=A review of selected seafood poisonings |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=175–84 |year=1999 |pmid=10485519 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2314 |accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref> [[Puffer fish]] and some marine [[dinoflagellate]]s also produce saxitoxin.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nakamuraa M, Oshimaa Y, Yasumoto T | year = 1984 | title = Occurrence of saxitoxin in puffer fish | journal = Toxicon | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 381–385 | doi = 10.1016/0041-0101(84)90082-5 | pmid = 6474491 }}</ref><ref>Landsberg JH, 2002.

Saxitoxin has been used in molecular biology to establish the function of the [[sodium channel]]. It acts on the voltage-gated sodium channels of nerve cells, preventing normal cellular function and leading to paralysis.  The blocking of neuronal sodium channels which occurs in paralytic shellfish poisoning produces a [[flaccid paralysis]] that leaves its victim calm and conscious through the progression of symptoms. Death often occurs from [[respiratory failure]].<ref>Kao CY and Levinson SR (1986) ''Tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin, and the molecular biology of the sodium channel'' New York Academy of Sciences.

===Lipopolysaccharides===
[[Lipopolysaccharide]]s are present in all cyanobacteria. Though not as potent as other cyanotoxins, some researchers have claimed that all lipopolysaccharides in cyanobacteria can irritate the skin, while other researchers doubt the toxic effects are that generalized.<ref name=NOAA_HAB /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Stewart I, Schluter PJ, Shaw GR |title=Cyanobacterial lipopolysaccharides and human health - a review |journal=Environ Health |volume=5 |issue= 1|pages=7 |year=2006 |pmid=16563160 |pmc=1489932 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-5-7 |url=http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7}}</ref>
