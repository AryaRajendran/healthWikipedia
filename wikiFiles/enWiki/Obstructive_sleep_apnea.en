'''Obstructive sleep apnea''' (OSA) or '''obstructive sleep apnea syndrome''' is the most common type of [[sleep apnea]] and is caused by obstruction of the [[Upper respiratory tract|upper airway]].  It is characterized by repetitive  pauses in breathing during sleep, despite the effort to breathe, and is usually associated with a reduction in [[oxygen saturation|blood oxygen saturation]]. These pauses in breathing, called "[[apnea]]s" (literally, "without breath"),  typically last 20 to 40 seconds.<ref name='AASM2001'>{{cite book | last1 = AASM | title = The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revised | publisher = American Academy of Sleep Medicine, | year = 2001 | location = Westchester, Illinois | pages = 52–8 | url = http://www.esst.org/adds/ICSD.pdf | accessdate = 2010-09-11}}</ref>

The individual with OSA is rarely aware of having difficulty breathing, even upon awakening. It is recognized as a problem by others witnessing the individual during episodes or is suspected because of its effects on the body (''[[sequelae]]''). OSA is commonly accompanied with [[snoring]].

Symptoms may be present for years or even decades without identification, during which time the sufferer may become conditioned to the daytime sleepiness and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] associated with significant levels of sleep disturbance. Sufferers who generally sleep alone are often unaware of the condition, without a regular bed-partner to notice and make them aware of their symptoms.

As the muscle tone of the body ordinarily relaxes during sleep, and the airway at the throat is composed of walls of soft tissue, which can collapse, it is not surprising that breathing can be obstructed during sleep.  Although a very minor degree of OSA is considered to be within the bounds of normal sleep, and many individuals experience episodes of OSA at some point in life, a small percentage of people are afflicted with chronic, severe OSA.

Many people experience episodes of OSA for only a short period of time. This can be the result of an upper respiratory infection that causes nasal congestion, along with swelling of the throat, or tonsillitis that temporarily produces very enlarged tonsils. The [[Epstein-Barr virus]], for example, is known to be able to dramatically increase the size of lymphoid tissue during acute infection, and OSA is fairly common in acute cases of severe [[infectious mononucleosis]]. Temporary spells of OSA syndrome may also occur in individuals who are under the influence of a drug (such as alcohol) that may relax their body tone excessively and interfere with normal arousal from sleep mechanisms.

==Signs and symptoms==
Common signs of OSA include unexplained daytime sleepiness, restless sleep, and loud [[snoring]] (with periods of silence followed by gasps). Less common symptoms are morning [[headaches]]; insomnia; trouble concentrating; mood changes such as [[irritability]], [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; forgetfulness; increased heart rate and/or [[blood pressure]]; decreased sex drive; unexplained weight gain;  increased urination and/or [[nocturia]]; frequent heartburn or [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]]; and heavy night sweats.

===Adults===
In adults, the most typical individual with OSA syndrome suffers from [[obesity]], with particular heaviness at the face and neck. Obesity is not always present with OSA; in fact, a significant number of adults with normal body mass indices (BMIs) have decreased muscle tone causing airway collapse and sleep apnea. The cause of this is not well understood. The hallmark symptom of OSA syndrome in adults is [[excessive daytime sleepiness]]. Typically, an adult or adolescent with severe long-standing OSA will fall asleep for very brief periods in the course of usual daytime activities if given any opportunity to sit or rest. This behavior may be quite dramatic, sometimes occurring during conversations with others at social gatherings.

The hypoxia (absence of oxygen supply) related to OSA may cause changes in the neurons of the [[hippocampus]] and the right [[frontal cortex]]. Research using neuro-imaging revealed evidence of hippocampal atrophy in people suffering from OSA. They found that some sufferers have problems in mentally manipulating non-verbal information and in [[executive function]].<ref name="pmid14751008">{{cite journal |author=Gale SD, Hopkins RO |title=Effects of hypoxia on the brain: neuroimaging and neuropsychological findings following carbon monoxide poisoning and obstructive sleep apnea |journal=J Int Neuropsychol Soc |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=60–71 |year=2004 |pmid=14751008 |doi=10.1017/S1355617704101082 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1355617704101082 }}</ref>

===Children===
Although this so-called "hypersomnolence" (excessive sleepiness) may also occur in children, it is not at all typical of young children with sleep apnea. Toddlers and young children with severe OSA instead ordinarily behave as if "over-tired" or "[[hyperactivity|hyperactive]]."  Adults and children with very severe OSA also differ in typical body ''habitus''. Adults are generally heavy, with particularly short and heavy necks. Young children, on the other hand, are generally not only thin, but may have "[[failure to thrive]]", where growth is reduced. Poor growth occurs for two reasons: the work of breathing is intense enough that calories are burned at high rates even at rest, and the nose and throat are so obstructed that eating is both tasteless and physically uncomfortable. OSA in children, unlike adults, is often caused by obstructive [[tonsil]]s and [[adenoid]]s and may sometimes be cured with [[tonsillectomy]] and [[adenoidectomy]].

This problem can also be caused by excessive weight in children.  In this case, the symptoms are more like the symptoms adults feel:  restlessness, exhaustion, etc.

Children with OSA may experience learning and memory deficits and OSA has also been linked to lowered childhood IQ scores.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Halbower AC, Degaonkar M, Barker PB, ''et al.'' |title=Childhood obstructive sleep apnea associates with neuropsychological deficits and neuronal brain injury |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=e301 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16933960 |pmc=1551912 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030301 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030301}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
Old age is often accompanied by muscular and neurological loss of muscle tone of the upper airway.  Decreased muscle tone is also temporarily caused by chemical depressants; alcoholic drinks and sedative medications being the most common.  Permanent premature muscular tonal loss in the upper airway may be precipitated by [[traumatic brain injury]], [[neuromuscular disorders]], or poor adherence to chemical and or speech-therapy treatments.

Individuals with decreased muscle tone, increased soft tissue around the airway, and structural features that give rise to a narrowed airway are at high risk for OSA. Men, in which the anatomy is typified by increased mass in the torso and neck, are at increased risk of developing sleep apnea, especially through middle age and later.  Women suffer typically less frequently and to a lesser degree than do men, owing partially to physiology, but possibly also to differential levels of [[progesterone]].  Prevalence in [[menopause|post-menopausal]] women approaches that of men in the same age range. Women are at greater risk for developing OSA during [[pregnancy]].<ref>Natalie Edwards, Colin E. Sullivan, Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Pregnancy, Sleep Medicine Clinics, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2008, Pages 81-95, ISSN 1556-407X, 10.1016/j.jsmc.2007.10.010. (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1556407X0700121X)</ref> 

OSA also appears to have a genetic component; those with a family history of it are more likely to develop it themselves. Lifestyle factors such as smoking may also increase the chances of developing OSA as the chemical irritants in smoke tend to inflame the soft tissue of the upper airway and promote fluid retention, both of which can result in narrowing of the upper airway. An individual may also experience or exacerbate OSA with the consumption of alcohol, sedatives, or any other medication that increases sleepiness as most of these drugs are also muscle relaxants.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sleep-apnea/DS00148/DSECTION=risk-factors Sleep Apnea: Risk Factors], Mayo Clinic, June 29, 2010, Retrieved November 4, 2010.</ref>

==Epidemiology==
{{expand section|date=November 2011}}
OSA is more frequent than [[central sleep apnea]] and is the most common category of sleep-disordered breathing. It is a common condition in many parts of the world. 

If studied carefully in a sleep lab by polysomnography (formal "sleep study"), it is believed by some authorities that approximately 1 in 5 American adults would have at least mild OSA.<ref name="facial phenotype">{{cite journal

}}</ref> The precise prevalence of OSA among the adult population in western Europe and North America, however, has not been confidently established. In the mid-1990s it was estimated to be 3-4% of women and 6-7% of men.

==Causes==

===Common causes===
Most cases of OSA are believed to be caused by: 
* old age (natural or premature),
* brain injury (temporary or permanent),
* decreased muscle tone,
* increased soft tissue around the airway (sometimes due to obesity), and
* structural features that give rise to a narrowed airway.

Decreased muscle tone can be caused by drugs or alcohol, or it can be caused by neurological problems or other disorders.  Some people have more than one of these issues. There is also a theory that long-term snoring might induce local nerve lesions in the pharynx in the same way as long-term exposure to vibration might cause nerve lesions in other parts of the body. Snoring is a vibration of the soft tissues of the upper airways, and studies have shown electrophysiological findings in the nerves and muscles of the pharynx indicating local nerve lesions.

===Craniofacial syndromes===
There are patterns of unusual facial features that occur in recognizable syndromes. Some of these craniofacial syndromes are genetic, others are from unknown causes. In many craniofacial syndromes, the features that are unusual involve the nose, mouth and jaw, or resting muscle tone, and put the individual at risk for OSA syndrome.

[[Down syndrome]] is one such syndrome. In this [[chromosome|chromosomal]] abnormality, several features combine to make the presence of obstructive sleep apnea more likely. The specific features in Down syndrome that predispose to obstructive sleep apnea include: relatively low muscle tone, narrow [[nasopharynx]], and large tongue. Obesity and enlarged tonsils and adenoids, conditions that occur commonly in the western population, are much more likely to be obstructive in a person with these features than without them.  Obstructive sleep apnea does occur even more frequently in people with Down syndrome than in the general population. A little over 50% of all people with Down syndrome suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (de Miguel-Díez, et al. 2003), and some physicians advocate routine testing of this group (Shott, et al. 2006).

In other craniofacial syndromes, the abnormal feature may actually improve the airway, but its correction may put the person at risk for obstructive sleep apnea ''after'' surgery, when it is modified. [[Cleft palate]] syndromes are such an example. During the newborn period, all humans are [[obligate nasal breathing|obligate nasal breathers]]. The palate is both the roof of the mouth and the floor of the nose. Having an open palate may make feeding difficult, but generally does not interfere with breathing, in fact, if the nose is very obstructed, then an open palate may relieve breathing. There are a number of clefting syndromes in which the open palate is not the only abnormal feature; additionally there is a narrow nasal passage - which may not be obvious. In such individuals, closure of the cleft palate- whether by surgery or by a temporary oral appliance, can cause the onset of obstruction.

Skeletal advancement in an effort to physically increase the [[human pharynx|pharyngeal]] airspace is often an option for craniofacial patients with upper airway obstruction and small lower jaws ([[Human mandible|mandible]]s). These syndromes include [[Treacher Collins syndrome]] and [[Pierre Robin sequence]]. [[Mandibular advancement surgery]] is often just one of the modifications needed to improve the airway, others may include reduction of the tongue, [[tonsillectomy]] or modified [[uvulopalatoplasty]].

=== Post-operative complication ===
OSA can also occur as a serious post-operative complication that seems to be most frequently associated with [[pharyngeal flap surgery]] as compared to other procedures for the treatment of [[velopharyngeal inadequacy]] (VPI).<ref name=Sloan>{{cite journal |doi=10.1597/1545-1569(2000)037<0112:PPFASP>2.3.CO;2 |author=Sloan GM |title=Posterior pharyngeal flap and sphincter pharyngoplasty: the state of the art |journal=Cleft Palate Craniofac.

The surgical treatment for velopalatal insufficiency may cause obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. When velopalatal insufficiency is present, air leaks into the nasopharynx even when the soft palate should close off the nose. A simple test for this condition can be made by placing a tiny mirror at the nose, and asking the subject to say "P". This p sound, a plosive, is normally produced with the nasal airway closes off - all air comes out of the pursed lips, none from the nose. If it is impossible to say the sound without fogging a nasal mirror, there is an air leak - reasonable evidence of poor palatal closure. Speech is often unclear due to inability to pronounce certain sounds. One of the surgical treatments for velopalatal insufficiency involves tailoring the tissue from the back of the throat and using it to purposefully cause partial obstruction of the opening of the [[nasopharynx]]. This may actually ''cause'' OSA syndrome in susceptible individuals, particularly in the days following surgery, when swelling occurs (see below: Special Situation: Anesthesia and Surgery).

==Pathophysiology==
The normal sleep/wake cycle in adults is divided into REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, and consciousness. NREM sleep is further divided into Stages 1, 2 and 3 NREM sleep. The deepest stage (stage 3 of NREM) is required for the physically restorative effects of sleep, and in pre-adolescents this is the period of release of [[human growth hormone]]. NREM stage 2 and REM, which combined are 70% of an average person's total sleep time, are more associated with mental recovery and maintenance.  During REM sleep in particular, muscle tone of the throat and neck, as well as the vast majority of all skeletal muscles, is almost completely attenuated, allowing the tongue and soft palate/oropharynx to relax, and in the case of sleep apnea, to impede the flow of air to a degree ranging from light [[snoring]] to complete collapse. In the cases where airflow is reduced to a degree where blood oxygen levels fall, or the physical exertion to breathe is too great, neurological mechanisms trigger a sudden interruption of sleep, called a neurological arousal.  These arousals rarely result in complete awakening, but can have a significant negative effect on the restorative quality of sleep.  In significant cases of OSA, one consequence is [[sleep deprivation]] due to the repetitive disruption and recovery of sleep activity.  This sleep interruption in stage 3 (also called [[slow-wave sleep]]), and in REM sleep, can interfere with normal growth patterns, [[healing]], and [[immune response]], especially in children and young adults.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of OSA is often based on a combination of patient history and tests  (lab- or home-based).
These tests range, in decreasing order of cost, complexity and tethering of the patient (number and type of channels of data recorded), from lab-attended full polysomnography ("sleep study") down to single-channel home recording. In the USA, these categories are associated with insurance classification from Type I down to Type IV.<ref>[http://www.sleepeducation.com/Topic.aspx?id=80 FAQ on www.sleepeducation.com]</ref>  Reimbursement rules vary among European countries.<ref>http://www.sleep-journal.com/article/S1389-9457(10)00379-5/abstract</ref>

[[Polysomnography]] in diagnosing OSA characterizes the pauses in breathing. As in central apnea, pauses are followed by a relative decrease in blood oxygen and an increase in the blood carbon dioxide. Whereas in central sleep apnea the body's motions of breathing stop, in OSA the chest not only continues to make the movements of inhalation, but the movements typically become even more pronounced. Monitors for airflow at the nose and mouth demonstrate that efforts to breathe are not only present, but that they are often exaggerated. The chest muscles and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] contract and the entire body may thrash and struggle.

An "event" can be either an apnea, characterised by complete cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds, or a [[hypopnea]] in which airflow decreases by 50 percent for 10 seconds or decreases by 30 percent if there is an associated decrease in the oxygen saturation or an arousal from sleep.<ref>American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999</ref> To grade the severity of sleep apnea, the number of events per hour is reported as the [[apnea-hypopnea index]] (AHI). An AHI of less than 5 is considered normal. An AHI of 5-15 is mild; 15-30 is moderate and more than 30 events per hour characterizes severe sleep apnea.

===Home oximetry===
In patients who are at high likelihood of having OSA, a [[randomized controlled trial]] found that home [[oximetry]] (a non-invasive method of monitoring blood oxygenation) may be adequate and easier to obtain than formal polysomnography.<ref name="pmid17283346">{{cite journal |author=Mulgrew AT, Fox N, Ayas NT, Ryan CF |title=Diagnosis and initial management of obstructive sleep apnea without polysomnography: a randomized validation study |journal=Ann.

J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=150 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1279–85 |year=1994 |pmid=7952553 }}</ref> Home oximetry, however, does not measure apneic events or respiratory event-related arousals and thus does not produce an AHI value.

==Treatment ==
There are a variety of treatments for OSA; use is determined by an individual patient's medical history, the severity of the disorder and, most importantly, the specific cause of the obstruction.

In acute [[infectious mononucleosis]], for example, although the airway may be severely obstructed in the first 2 weeks of the illness, the presence of lymphoid tissue (suddenly enlarged [[tonsils]] and [[adenoids]]) blocking the throat is usually only temporary. A course of anti-inflammatory steroids such as [[prednisone]] (or another kind of glucocorticoid drug) is often given to reduce this lymphoid tissue. Although the effects of the steroids are short term, in most affected individuals, the tonsillar and adenoidal enlargement are also short term, and will be reduced on its own by the time a brief course of steroids is completed. In unusual cases where the enlarged lymphoid tissue persists after resolution of the acute stage of the [[Epstein-Barr]] infection, or in which medical treatment with anti-inflammatory steroids does not adequately relieve breathing, tonsillectomy and [[adenoidectomy]] may be urgently required.

OSA in children is sometimes due to chronically enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is curative. The operation may be far from trivial, especially in the worst apnea cases, in which growth is retarded and abnormalities of the right heart may have developed. Even in these extreme cases, the surgery tends to cure not only the apnea and upper airway obstruction, but allows normal subsequent growth and development. Once the high end-expiratory pressures are relieved, the cardiovascular complications reverse themselves. The postoperative period in these children requires special precautions (see "Surgery and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome" below).

The treatment of OSA in adults with poor [[oropharynx|oropharyngeal]] airways secondary to heavy upper body type is varied. Unfortunately, in this most common type of OSA, unlike some of the cases discussed above, reliable cures are not the rule.

Some treatments involve lifestyle changes, such as avoiding alcohol and medications that relax the central nervous system (for example, sedatives and muscle relaxants), losing weight, and quitting smoking. Some people are helped by special pillows or devices that keep them from sleeping on their backs, or oral appliances to keep the airway open during sleep. For those cases where these conservative methods are inadequate, doctors can recommend [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP), in which a face mask is attached to a tube and a machine that blows pressurized air into the mask and through the airway to keep it open. There are also surgical procedures intended to remove and tighten tissue and widen the airway, but none has been reproducibly successful.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  Some individuals may need a combination of therapies to successfully treat their condition. Home polysomnogram equipment can assist patients in reviewing treatment effectiveness.  Though some equipment is marketed as [[sleep hygiene]] devices not intended for medical use, the equipment can prove invaluable under medical supervision to evaluate overall treatment effectiveness in conjunction with physician administered sleep studies {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. 

Some patients may reduce apnea events through the use of nocturnal oxygen, as the use of nocturnal oxygen lowers respiration rate, which minimizes airway collapse.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11181239</ref>

=== Physical intervention ===
The most widely used current therapeutic intervention is ''positive airway pressure'' whereby a breathing machine pumps a controlled stream of air through a mask worn over the nose, mouth, or both. The additional pressure splints or holds open the relaxed muscles, just as air in a [[balloon]] inflates it. There are several variants:
* ([[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]]), or ''continuous positive airway pressure'', in which a computer controlled air flow generator, generates an airstream at a constant pressure. This pressure is prescribed by the patient's physician, based on an overnight test or [[Titration (disambiguation)|titration]]. Newer CPAP models are available which slightly reduce pressure upon exhalation to increase patient comfort and compliance. CPAP is the most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.
* ([[VPAP]]), or ''variable positive airway pressure'', also known as bilevel or BiPAP, uses an electronic circuit to monitor the patient's breathing, and provides two different pressures, a higher one during [[inhalation]] and a lower pressure during [[exhalation]]. This system is more expensive, and is sometimes used with patients who have other coexisting respiratory problems and/or who find breathing out against an increased pressure to be uncomfortable or disruptive to their sleep.
* ([[Automatic Positive Airway Pressure|APAP]]), or ''automatic positive airway pressure'', also known as "Auto CPAP", is the newest form of such treatment. An APAP machine incorporates pressure <!-- and our vibration --> sensors and a computer which continuously monitors the patient's breathing performance.<ref  name="pmid15486338">{{cite journal| author=Whitelaw WA, Brant RF,  Flemons WW| title=Clinical usefulness of home oximetry compared with  polysomnography for assessment of sleep apnea. | journal=Am J Respir  Crit Care Med | year= 2005 | volume= 171 | issue= 2 | pages= 188–93 |  pmid=15486338 | doi=10.1164/rccm.200310-1360OC | pmc= |  url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=15486338   }}   [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=15989309  Review in: ACP J Club. 2005 Jul-Aug;143(1):21]</ref><ref name="pmid11902424">{{cite journal| author=Littner M, Hirshkowitz M, Davila D, Anderson WM, Kushida CA, Woodson BT et al.| title=Practice parameters for the use of auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure devices for titrating pressures and treating adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

Although approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), these devices are still considered experimental by many, and are not covered by most [[United States]] insurance plans under an APAP-specific code, but only at the rate of a standard CPAP machine.

A second type of physical intervention, a [[mandibular advancement splint]] (MAS), is sometimes prescribed for mild or moderate sleep apnea sufferers. The device is a mouthguard similar to those used in sports to protect the teeth. For apnea patients, it is designed to hold the lower jaw slightly down and forward relative to the natural, relaxed position. This position holds the tongue farther away from the back of the airway, and may be enough to relieve apnea or improve breathing for some patients.
The FDA has approved only 16 types of oral appliances for the treatment of sleep apnea. A listing is available at [http://www.fda.gov/cdrh its website].

Oral appliance therapy is less effective than CPAP, but is more 'user friendly'. Side effects are common, but rarely is the patient aware of them.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Oral administration of the [[methylxanthine]] [[theophylline]] (chemically similar to [[caffeine]]) can reduce the number of episodes of apnea, but can also produce side effects such as heart palpitations and [[insomnia]]. Theophylline is generally ineffective in adults with OSA, but is sometimes used to treat central sleep apnea (see below), and [[infant]]s and children with apnea.

When other treatments do not completely treat the OSA, drugs are sometimes prescribed to treat a patient's daytime sleepiness or [[somnolence]]. These range from [[stimulants]] such as [[amphetamine]]s to modern anti-[[narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] medicines. The [[narcolepsy|anti-narcoleptic]] medicine [[modafinil]] is seeing increased use in this role {{As of|2004|lc=on}}.

In most cases, weight loss will reduce the number and severity of apnea episodes. In the morbidly obese, a major loss of weight (such as what occurs after [[bariatric surgery]]) can sometimes cure the condition.

=== Neurostimulation ===
Some researchers believe that OSA is at root a [[neurological]] condition, in which nerves that control the tongue and soft palate fail to sufficiently stimulate those muscles, leading to over-relaxation and airway blockage. A few experiments and trial studies have explored the use of pacemakers and similar devices, some programmed to detect breathing effort while other maintain the natural tone by delivering gentle electrical stimulation to the muscles of the tongue, at the time.{Mwenge GB et al., Targeted hypoglossal neurostimulation for obstructive sleep apnoea. A 1 year pilot Study. Eur Respir J. 2012 May 17. [Epub ahead of print]. PMID:[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22599356 22599356]; Zaidi FN, et al., Tongue Anatomy and Physiology, the Scientific Basis for a Novel Targeted Neurostimulation System Designed for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

This is not a common mode of treatment for OSA patients as of 2004, but it is an active field of research.

=== Surgical intervention ===
{{Quote box
| title = '''Special situation:''' Surgery and anesthesia in patients with sleep apnea
| quote  = Many drugs and agents used during surgery to relieve pain and to depress consciousness remain in the body at low amounts for hours or even days afterwards. In an individual with either central, obstructive or mixed sleep apnea, these low doses may be enough to cause life-threatening irregularities in breathing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Use of analgesics and sedatives in these patients postoperatively should therefore be minimized or avoided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Surgery on the mouth and throat, as well as dental surgery and procedures, can result in postoperative swelling of the lining of the mouth and other areas that affect the airway. Even when the surgical procedure is designed to improve the airway, such as tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy or tongue reduction - swelling may negate some of the effects in the immediate postoperative period.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Individuals with sleep apnea generally require more intensive monitoring after surgery for these reasons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

[[Sleep surgery]] can be performed to improve the size or tone of a patient's airway. For decades, [[tracheostomy]] was the only effective treatment for sleep apnea. It is used today only in rare, intractable cases that have withstood other attempts at treatment. Modern operations employ one or more of several options, tailored to each patient's needs. Success rates are directly proportional to the accuracy in the initial diagnosis of the site of obstruction. 
* Nasal surgery, including [[turbinectomy]] (removal or reduction of a nasal [[turbinate]]), or straightening of the [[nasal septum]], in patients with nasal obstruction or congestion which reduces airway pressure and complicates OSA.
* [[Tonsillectomy]] and/or [[adenoidectomy]] in an attempt to increase the size of the airway.
* Removal or reduction of parts of the [[soft palate]] and some or all of the [[uvula]], such as [[uvulopalatopharyngoplasty]] (UPPP) or [[laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty]] (''LAUP''). Modern variants of this procedure sometimes use [[radiofrequency]] waves to heat and remove tissue.
* Reduction of the tongue base, either with laser excision or [[radiofrequency ablation]].
* [[Genioglossus advancement]], in which a small portion of the lower jaw that attaches to the tongue is moved forward, to pull the tongue away from the back of the airway.
* ''Hyoid suspension'', in which the [[hyoid bone]] in the neck, another attachment point for tongue muscles, is pulled forward in front of the [[larynx]].
* [[Maxillomandibular advancement]] (MMA) is the most effective sleep apnea surgical procedure currently available, with reduction of the AHI to less than 15 in over 90% of patients, and reduction of AHI to <5 in ~45% of patients. MMA was once thought to be fairly invasive, but has shown to be less painful, in general, than a UPPP soft palate procedure. The associated surgical risks are low, including bleeding, infection, malocclusion, and permanent numbness of the chin and lip. In general, patient perceptions of surgical outcome have been very favorable.<ref>{{cite journal

The role of surgery in the treatment of sleep apnea has been questioned repeatedly, as the long term success rate of the procedures has come into question. Patient selection in the past was oftentimes quite poor, resulting in poor overall results. Potential surgical candidates should now be extensively examined to assure the site of obstruction is clearly evident prior to any surgical intervention. The patients' age, weight and other factors may make them a bad candidate for surgery. When a patient can tolerate it, positive air pressure treatment is the gold standard. However, surgical intervention is a viable option for those patients who cannot, or refuse, to use CPAP.<ref>[http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_surgical_procedures_sleep_apnea_000065_10.htm Sleep apnea<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Compression stockings===
A small [[randomized controlled trial]] reported that [[compression stockings]] reduced the number of apneas and hypopnea, perhaps by "prevention of fluid accumulation in the legs during the day, and its nocturnal displacement into the neck at night."<ref  name="pmid21836140">{{cite journal| author=Redolfi S, Arnulf I, Pottier M, Lajou J, Koskas I, Bradley TD et al.| title=Attenuation of Obstructive Sleep Apnea by Compression Stockings in Subjects With Venous Insufficiency. | journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med | year= 2011 | volume=  184| issue=  9| pages=  1062–6| pmid=21836140 | doi=10.1164/rccm.201102-0350OC | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=21836140   }}</ref>

===Oropharyngeal muscle exercises ===
One study showed that playing the [[didgeridoo]] may reduce snoring and daytime sleepiness due to OSA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Puhan MA, Suarez A, Lo Cascio C, Zahn A, Heitz M, Braendli O |title=Didgeridoo playing as alternative treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome: randomised controlled trial |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7536 |pages=266–70 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16377643 |pmc=1360393 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38705.470590.55 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/332/7536/266}}</ref>  Since OSA is sometimes caused by hypotonicity (low tone) in the muscles of the throat, playing the didgeridoo may improve symptoms of sleep apnea by exercising muscles of the throat and increasing tone.<ref name="Guimaraes KC, Drager LF, Genta PR, Marcondes BF, Lorensi-Filhol G 2009 962–966">{{cite journal |author=Guimaraes KC, Drager LF, Genta PR, Marcondes BF, Lorensi-Filhol G |title=Effects of Oropharyngeal Exercises on Patients with Moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome |journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=962–966 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19234106 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200806-981OC |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/short/200806-981OCv1?ck=nck}}</ref>

A study published in 2009<ref name="Guimaraes KC, Drager LF, Genta PR, Marcondes BF, Lorensi-Filhol G 2009 962–966"/> tested the effect of a set of oropharyngeal exercises developed from exercises used by speech-language pathologists to improve swallowing function. Participants with moderate OSA who performed the exercises every day showed a significant decrease in snoring frequency, snoring intensity, daytime sleepiness, sleep quality score, neck circumference, and AHI score when compared with a control group who performed sham exercises.  The improvement in OSA shown by this group was comparable to the improvement shown in patients who use oral appliances to treat this condition.

Although this study was not designed to determine which specific exercises were beneficial, an editorial response to this study in the same journal<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steele CM |title=On the Plausibility of Upper Airway Remodeling as an Outcome of Orofacial Exercise |journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=858–859 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19423718 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200901-0016ED |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/179/10/858}}</ref> argues that only two of the set of exercises were likely capable of effecting the improvements they reported.  These two exercises included sucking the tongue upward against the palate for a total of three minutes throughout the day, and inflating a balloon by blowing forcefully and then breathing in deeply through the nose, repeated five times without removing the balloon from the mouth.  The tongue exercise is intended to increase the strength of tongue protrusion, and the balloon exercise is intended to increase the strength of the pharyngeal wall.<ref name="Guimaraes KC, Drager LF, Genta PR, Marcondes BF, Lorensi-Filhol G 2009 962–966"/>  Although more research is needed to clarify the effects of oropharyngeal exercise on OSA, this recent study suggests a promising new approach to treating the condition.

===Positional treatments===

Many people benefit from sleeping at a 30 degree elevation of the upper body<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neill AM, Angus SM, Sajkov D, McEvoy RD |title=Effects of sleep posture on upper airway stability in patients with obstructive sleep apnea |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=199–204 |year=1997 |month=January |pmid=9001312 |doi= |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/1/199}}</ref> or higher, as if in a [[recliner]]. Doing so helps prevent the gravitational collapse of the airway. [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|Lateral positions]] (sleeping on a  side), as opposed to [[supine position]]s (sleeping on the back), are also recommended as a treatment for sleep apnea,<ref>[http://www.cardinal.com/mps/focus/respiratory/abstracts/abstracts/ab2003/OF-03-249.asp The Study Of The Influence Of Sleep Position On Sleep Apnea<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?ID=20067187 Positioner–a method for preventing sleep apnea<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Szollosi I, Roebuck T, Thompson B, Naughton MT |title=Lateral sleeping position reduces severity of central sleep apnea / Cheyne-Stokes respiration |journal=Sleep |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=1045–51 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16944673 }}</ref> largely because the gravitational component is smaller than in  the supine position.  A 30 degree elevation of the upper body can be achieved by sleeping in a recliner, an adjustable bed, or a bed wedge placed under the mattress.  This approach can easily be used in combination with other treatments and may be particularly effective in very obese people.

==Health risks==
Many studies indicate the effect of a "[[fight or flight]]" response on the body that happens with each apneic event is what increases health risks and consequences in OSA. The fight or flight response causes many hormonal changes in the body; those changes, coupled with the low oxygen saturation level of the blood, cause damage to the body over time.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v35.n30/story17.html www.yale.edu]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/04/020403025512.htm |title=Cellular Link Between Sleep Apnea And Atherosclerosis Found |year=2002 | month=April |publisher=ScienceDaily.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.schlaflabor-breisgau.de/Bild_gif/Peppard.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070520183530.htm |title=Sleep Apnea May Increase Risk Of Diabetes |year=2007 | month=May |publisher=ScienceDaily.com}}</ref>

The most serious consequence of untreated OSA is to the heart. Sleep apnea sufferers have a 30% higher risk of [[heart attack]] or death than those unaffected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thoracic.org/sections/publications/press-releases/conference/articles/2007/press-releases/sleep-apnea-increases-risk-of-heart-attack-or-death-by-30.html |title=Sleep Apnea Increases Risk of Heart Attack or Death by 30% |last=N.A.
