'''Brenner tumors''' are uncommon tumours that are part of the [[surface epithelial-stromal tumor]] group of [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian neoplasm]]s.

The majority of these tumours are [[benign]]. However, they can be [[malignant]].<ref name="pmid16758686">{{cite journal |author=Marwah N, Mathur SK, Marwah S, Singh S, Karwasra RK, Arora B |title=Malignant Brenner tumour--a case report |journal=Indian J Pathol Microbiol |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=251–2 |year=2005 |pmid=16758686 |doi=}}</ref>

They are most frequently found as incidental findings<ref name="pmid16998096">{{cite journal |author=Green GE, Mortele KJ, Glickman JN, Benson CB |title=Brenner tumors of the ovary: sonographic and computed tomographic imaging features |journal=J Ultrasound Med |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1245–51; quiz 1252–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16998096 |doi= |url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16998096}}</ref> on [[pelvic examination]] or at [[laparotomy]].

Brenner tumours very rarely can occur in other locations, including [[testis]].<ref name="pmid2021324">{{cite journal |author=Caccamo D, Socias M, Truchet C |title=Malignant Brenner tumor of the testis and epididymis |journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=524–7 |year=1991 |pmid=2021324 |doi=}}</ref>

==Presentation==
On gross [[pathology|pathological]] examination, they are solid, sharply circumscribed and pale yellow-tan in colour.  90% are unilateral (arising in one ovary, the other is unaffected).  The tumours can vary in size from less than {{convert|1|cm|in}} to {{convert|30|cm|in}}.  Borderline and malignant Brenner tumours are possible but each are rare.

==Diagnosis==

[[Histology|Histologically]], there are nests of transitional-type epithelial cells with longitudinal nuclear grooves ([[coffee]] bean nuclei) lying in abundant fibrous stroma.

==Similar conditions==
Transitional cell carcinoma is an even rarer entity, in which neoplastic transitional epithelial cells similar to transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder are seen in the ovary, without the characteristic stromal/epithelial pattern of a Brenner tumour.

==Eponym==
It is named for Fritz Brenner, who characterized it in 1907.<ref name="pmid903146">{{cite journal |author=Lamping JD, Blythe JG |title=Bilateral Brenner tumors: a case report and review of the literature |journal=Hum.
