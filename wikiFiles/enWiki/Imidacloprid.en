'''Imidacloprid''' is a systemic [[insecticide]] which acts as an [[insect]] [[neurotoxin]] and belongs to a class of chemicals called the [[neonicotinoids]] which act on the [[central nervous system]] of insects with much lower toxicity to mammals. The chemical works by interfering with the transmission of stimuli in the insect nervous system. Specifically, it causes a blockage in the [[Nicotinic|nicotinergic]] neuronal pathway. This blockage leads to the accumulation of [[acetylcholine]], an important [[neurotransmitter]], resulting in the insect's paralysis, and eventually death. It is effective on contact and via stomach action.<ref name=extoxnet /> Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuron [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] than to mammal neuron receptors, this [[insecticide]] is selectively more toxic to insects than mammals.<ref name=NPIC-imi>{{cite web

==Authorized uses==

Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in the world.  Its major uses include:

* Agriculture - Control of [[aphid]]s, [[thrips]],<ref name="EPAproblem">{{cite web | first = N.E. | last = Federoff | first2 = Allen | last2 = Vaughan | first3 = M.R. | last3 = Barrett | publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] | date = 13 November 2008 | title = Environmental Fate and Effects Division Problem Formulation for the Registration Review of Imidacloprid | url = http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0844-0003 | accessdate = 18 April 2012}}</ref> [[stink bug]]s, [[locust]]s, and a variety of other insects that damage crops
* Arboriculture - Control of the [[emerald ash borer]] and other insects that attack trees (including [[Hemlock tree|hemlock]], [[maple]], [[oak]], and [[birch]])<ref name=trees />
* Home Protection - Control of [[termite]]s,<ref name="EPAproblem" /><ref name="NPIC-imi" /> [[carpenter ant]]s, [[cockroach]]es, and moisture-loving insects
* Domestic animals - Control of [[flea]]s (applied to the neck)<ref name="NPIC-imi" />
* Turf - Control of [[Japanese beetle]] larvae
* Gardening - Control of [[aphid]]s and other pests

When used on plants, imidacloprid, which is systemic, is slowly taken up by plant roots and slowly translocated up the plant via [[xylem]] tissue.

==Application to trees==
When used on trees, it can take 30 – 60 days to reach the top, (depending on the size and height) and enter the leaves in high enough quantities to be effective. Imidacloprid can be found in the trunk, the branches, the twigs, the leaves, the leaflets, and the seeds.  Many trees are wind pollinated.  But others such as fruit trees, Linden, Catalpa, and Black Locust trees are bee and wind pollinated and imidacloprid would likely be found in the flowers in small quantities.  Higher doses must be used to control boring insects than other types.<ref name=trees/>

==Background==

On January 21, 1986 a patent was filed, and granted on May 3, 1988, for imidacloprid in the United States (U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,060) by [[Nihon Tokushu Noyaku Seizo]] K.K. of Tokyo, Japan.<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=4,742,060.PN.&OS=PN/4,742,060&RS=PN/4,742,060 U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,060] - uspto.gov</ref>  <!-- Access on 0812-2008 -->

On March 25, 1992, Miles, Inc. (later Bayer CropScience) applied for registration of imidacloprid for turfgrass and ornamentals in the United States.  On March 10, 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved the registration of imidacloprid.<ref name="epa.gov">[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/chemical/foia/cleared-reviews/reviews/129099/129099.htm Index of Cleared Science Reviews for Imidacloprid (Pc Code 129099)] U.S. EPA.</ref>

On January 26, 2005, the Federal Register notes the establishment of the '(Pesticide Tolerances for) Emergency Exemptions' for imidacloprid. It use was granted to ''Hawaii (for the) use (of) this pesticide on bananas(,) and the States of Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota to use (of) this pesticide on sunflower(s)''.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-PEST/2005/January/Day-26/p1438.htm  Imidacloprid; Pesticide Tolerances for Emergency Exemptions] Federal Register: January 26, 2005 (Volume 70, Number 16), Page 3634-3642- epa.gov</ref> <!-- Access on 0812-2008 -->

==Brand names==

Imidacloprid has many brands and formulations for a wide range of uses, from delousing or defleaing animals to protecting trees. Selected brand names include: Admire, Advantage (Advocate) (flea killer for pets), Confidor, Conguard, Gaucho, Hachikusan, Intercept, Kohinor, Mallet, Merit, Nuprid, Optrol, Premise, Prothor, Provado, Turfthor, Winner, and Xytect.

==Biochemistry==

Imidacloprid is a [[systemic effect|systemic]] [[chloronicotinyl]] [[pesticide]], belonging to the class of [[neonicotinoid]] insecticides. It works by interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses in insects by binding irreversibly to specific insect [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]].<ref name=CanadianWaterQuality>{{cite book|last=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|title=Canadian water quality guidelines: imidacloprid: scientific supporting document|year=2007|publisher=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|location=Winnipeg, Man.|isbn=978-1-896997-71-1|url=http://www.ccme.ca/assets/pdf/imidacloprid_ssd_1388.pdf}}</ref>

As a systemic pesticide, imidacloprid [[translocates]] or moves easily in the xylem of plants from the soil into the leaves, fruit, pollen, and nectar of a plant.  Imidacloprid also exhibits excellent translaminar movement in plants and can penetrate the leaf cuticle and move readily into leaf tissue.<ref>[http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/emon/pubs/fatememo/Imidclprdfate2.pdf Environmental Fate of Imidacloprid] California Department of Pesticide Regulation 2006</ref>

Since imidacloprid is efficacious at very low levels (nanogram and picogram), it can be applied at lower concentrations (e.g., 0.05–0.125&nbsp;lb/acre or 55–140 g/ha) than other insecticides. The availability of imidacloprid and its favorable toxicity package as compared to other insecticides on the market in the 1990s, allowed the EPA to replace more toxic insecticides including the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, the organophosphorus compounds, and methylcarbamates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/risk/rcd/imidacloprid.pdf |title=Imidacloprid: Risk Characterization Document - Dietary and Drinking Water Exposure |publisher=California Environmental Protection Agency |date=February 9, 2006 |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="efsa.europa.eu">[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/148r.htm Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance imidacloprid.] European Food Safety Authority.

==Environmental fate==

The main routes of dissipation of imidacloprid in the environment are [[aqueous]] [[photolysis]] (half-life = 1–4 hours) and plant uptake. The major photo-metabolites include [[imidacloprid desnitro]], [[imidacloprid olefine]], imidacloprid urea, and five minor metabolites. The end product of photodegradation is [[chloronicotinic acid]] (CNA) and then ultimately carbon dioxide. Since imidacloprid has a low [[vapor pressure]], it normally does not volatilize readily.<ref name="CanadianWaterQuality"/>

Imidacloprid breaks down rapidly in water in the presence of light (half-life = 1–4 hours) but is persistent in water in the absence of light.  It has a water solubility of .61 g/L. which is relatively high.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flores-Céspedes|first=Francisco|coauthors=Figueredo-Flores, Cristina Isabel, Daza-Fernández, Isabel, Vidal-Peña, Fernando, Villafranca-Sánchez, Matilde, Fernández-Pérez, Manuel|title=Preparation and Characterization of Imidacloprid Lignin–Polyethylene Glycol Matrices Coated with Ethylcellulose|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|date=January 18, 2012|pages=1042–1051|doi=10.1021/jf2037483|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf2037483|volume=60|issue=4|pmid=22224401}}</ref> In the dark, at pH between 5 and 7, it breaks down very slowly, and at pH 9, the half-life is about 1 year. In soil under aerobic conditions, imidacloprid is persistent with half-lives on the order of 1–3 years. Major soil metabolites include imidacloprid nitrosimine, imidacloprid desnitro, hydroxynicotinic acid, and imidacloprid urea, which ultimately degrade to chloronicotinic acid, CO<sub>2</sub>, and bound residues.<ref name=CanadianWaterQuality /><ref>[European Draft Assessment Report: Imidacloprid. Annex B, B.7. February 2006]</ref><ref name="EPAproblem"/>

Imidacloprid is unstable in sunlit water and it quickly degrades.  In the soil it strongly binds to organic matter.   When not exposed to light, imidacloprid and dinotefuran break down slowly in water, and thus have the potential to persist in groundwater for extended periods. In surveys of groundwater, imidacloprid was usually not detected. When detected, it was present at very low levels, mostly at concentrations less than 1 part per billion (ppb) with a maximum of 7 ppb, which are below levels of concern for human health. The detections have generally occurred in areas with porous rocky or sandy soils with little organic matter, where the risk of leaching is high — and/or where the water table was close to the surface.<ref name="Hahn et al, 2011">Hahn, Jeffrey; Herms, Daniel A.; McCullough, Deborah G. (February 2011). [http://pest.ca.uky.edu/EXT/EAB/Potential%20Side%20Effects%20of%20EAB%20Insecticides%20FAQ.pdf "Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Potential Side Effects of Systemic Insecticides Used To Control Emerald Ash Borer"]. University of Michigan Extension, Michigan State University, The Ohio State University Extension.</ref>

According to standards set by the environmental ministry of Canada, if used correctly (e.g., at recommended rates, without irrigation, and when heavy rainfall is not predicted), imidacloprid does not characteristically leach into the deeper soil layers despite its high water solubility (Rouchaud et al. 1994; Tomlin 2000; Krohn and Hellpointner 2002).<ref name=CanadianWaterQuality/> In a series of field trials conducted by Rouchaud et al. (1994, 1996), in which imidacloprid was applied to sugar beet plots, it was consistently demonstrated that no detectable leaching of imidacloprid to the 10–20&nbsp;cm soil layer occurred. Imidacloprid was applied to a corn field in Minnesota, and no imidacloprid residues were found in sample column segments below the 0-15.2&nbsp;cm depth segment (Rice et al. 1991, as reviewed in Mulye 1995).<ref name="EPAproblem"/><ref name="CanadianWaterQuality"/>

Based on its high water solubility (0.5-0.6 g/L) and persistence, both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency in Canada consider imidacloprid to have a high potential to run off into surface water and to leach into ground water and thus warn not to apply in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow - <ref name="CanadianWaterQuality"/><ref>EPA label for imidacloprid.</ref><ref name="EPAproblem" />

A 2012 water monitoring study by the state of California, performed by collecting agricultural runoff during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011, found imidacloprid in 89% of samples, with levels ranging from 0.1-3.2 µg/L. 19% of the samples exceeded the EPA threshold for chronic toxicity for aquatic invertebrates of 1.05 µg/L. The authors also point out that Canadian and European guidelines are much lower (0.23 µg/L and 0.067 µg/L, respectively) and were exceeded in 73% and 88% of the samples, respectively. The authors concluded that "imidacloprid commonly moves offsite and contaminates surface waters at concentrations that could harm aquatic [invertebrates]"<ref>{{cite journal | first = Keith | last = Starner | first2 = Kean S. | last2 = Goh | year = 2012 | title = Detections of Imidacloprid in Surface Waters of Three Agricultural Regions of California, USA, 2010-2011 | journal = Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology | volume = 88 | pages = 316–321 | doi = 10.1007/s00128-011-0515-5 | issue = 3 | pmid = 22228315}}</ref>

==Toxicology==

Based on laboratory rat studies, imidacloprid is rated as "moderately toxic" on an acute oral basis to mammals and low toxicity on a dermal basis by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (class II or III, requiring a "Warning" or "Caution" label). It is rated as an "unlikely" [[carcinogen]] and as weakly mutagenic by the U.S.EPA (group E).  It is not listed for [[reproductive]], or [[developmental]] toxicity, but is listed on EPA's Tier 1 Screening Order for chemicals to be tested under the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP).<ref name="epa.gov"/><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/endo/pubs/stakeholder/notices.htm Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program: Tier 1 Screening Order Issuing Announcement.] Federal Register Notice, Oct 21, 2009. Vol. 74, No. 202, pp. 54422-54428</ref>  Tolerances for imidacloprid residues in food range from 0.02&nbsp;mg/kg in eggs to 3.0&nbsp;mg/kg in [[hops]].<ref name=extoxnet />

Animal toxicity is moderate when ingested orally and low when applied dermally.  It is not irritating to eyes or skin in [[rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s (although some commercial preparations contain [[clay]] as an inert ingredient, which may be an [[Irritation|irritant]]). The [[Acute toxicity|acute]] [[inhalation]] [[LD50|LD<sub>50</sub>]] in rats was not reached at the greatest attainable concentrations, 69 milligrams per cubic meter of air as an aerosol, and 5,323&nbsp;mg a.i./m³ of air as a dust. In rats subjected to a two-year feeding study, no observable effect was seen at 100 parts per million (ppm).  In rats, the thyroid is the organ most affected by imidacloprid.  Thyroid lesions occurred in male rats at a LOAEL of 16.9&nbsp;mg a.i./kg/day. In a one-year feeding study in dogs, no observable effect was seen at 1,250 ppm, while levels up to 2,500 ppm led to [[hypercholesterolemia]] and elevated [[liver]] [[Cytochrome P-450#Drug metabolism|cytochrome p-450 measurements]].<ref name=extoxnet /><ref name=CanadianWaterQuality />

{{main|Imidacloprid effects on bees}}

Imidacloprid is one of the most toxic insecticides to bees. The acute oral LD<sub>50</sub> ranges from 0.005 µg a.i./bee to 0.07 µg a.i./bee, which makes imidacloprid more toxic to bees than the [[organophosphate]] [[dimethoate]] (oral LD<sub>50</sub> 0.152 µg/bee) or the [[pyrethroid]] [[cypermethrin]] (oral LD<sub>50</sub> 0.160 µg/bee).<ref name=Suchail2001>{{cite journal | first = Séverine | last = Suchail | first2 = David | last2 = Guez | first3 = Luc P. | last3 = Belzunces | year = 2001 | title = Discrepancy between acute and chronic toxicity induced by imidacloprid and its metabolites in ''Apis mellifera'' | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 20 | pages = 2482–2486 | date = November 2011 | doi = 10.1002/etc.5620201113 | issue = 11 | pmid = 11699773}}</ref> The toxicity of imidacloprid to bees differs from most insecticides in that it is more toxic orally than by contact.

Imidacloprid was first widely used in the United States in 1996 as it replaced 3 broad classes of insecticides.  In 2006, U.S. commercial migratory beekeepers reported sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. This has happened in the past, however unlike previous losses, adult bees were abandoning their hives.  Scientists named this phenomenon [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD). Reports show that beekeepers in most states have been affected by CCD.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33938.pdf Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder] Congressional Research Service.</ref>  Although no single factor has been identified as causing CCD, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in their progress report on CCD stated that CCD may be "a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/ccd/ccdprogressreport2010.pdf |title=USDA Colony Collapse Disorder Progress Report |publisher=USDA Agriculture Research Service |format=PDF |date=June 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}</ref> Several studies have found that sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid increase honey bee susceptibility to the pathogen ''Nosema''.<ref name="Alaux2010">{{cite journal|last1=Alaux|first1=Cédric|last2=Brunet|first2=Jean-Luc|last3=Dussaubat|first3=Claudia|last4=Mondet|first4=Fanny|last5=Tchamitchan|first5=Sylvie|last6=Cousin|first6=Marianne|last7=Brillard|first7=Julien|last8=Baldy|first8=Aurelie|last9=Belzunces|first9=Luc P.|last10=Le Conte|first10=Yves|title=Interactions between ''Nosema'' microspores and a neonicotinoid weaken honeybees (''Apis mellifera'')|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=12|issue=3|year=2010|pages=774–782|issn=14622912|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02123.x|pmid=20050872|pmc=2847190}}</ref><ref name="Didier2011">{{cite journal|last1=Didier|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Vidau|first2=Cyril|last3=Diogon|first3=Marie|last4=Aufauvre|first4=Julie|last5=Fontbonne|first5=Régis|last6=Viguès|first6=Bernard|last7=Brunet|first7=Jean-Luc|last8=Texier|first8=Catherine|last9=Biron|first9=David G.|last10=Blot|first10=Nicolas|last11=El Alaoui|first11=Hicham|last12=Belzunces|first12=Luc P.|last13=Delbac|first13=Frédéric|title=Exposure to Sublethal Doses of Fipronil and Thiacloprid Highly Increases Mortality of Honeybees Previously Infected by ''Nosema ceranae''|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=6|year=2011|pages=e21550|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021550|editor1-last=Didier|editor1-first=Elizabeth|pmid=21738706|pmc=3125288}}</ref><ref name="Pettis2012">{{cite journal|last1=Pettis|first1=Jeffery S.|last2=vanEngelsdorp|first2=Dennis|last3=Johnson|first3=Josephine|last4=Dively|first4=Galen|title=Pesticide exposure in honey bees results in increased levels of the gut pathogen ''Nosema''|journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=99|issue=2|year=2012|pages=153–158|issn=0028-1042|doi=10.1007/s00114-011-0881-1|pmid=22246149|pmc=3264871}}</ref>

David Goulson (2012) from the University of Stirling was able to show that trivial effects due to imidacloprid in lab and greenhouse experiments can translate into large effects in the field. The research found that bees consuming the pesticide suffered an 85% loss in the number of queens their nests produced, and a doubling of the number of bees who failed to return from food foraging trips.<ref name=GuardianBee /><ref name="Whitehorn2012" />

Lu et al (2012) reported they were able to replicate CCD with sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid. The imidacloprid-treated hives were nearly empty, consistent with CCD, and the authors exclude ''Varroa'' or ''Nosema'' as contributing causes.<ref name=LuCCD />

In May 2012, researchers at the University of San Diego released a study that showed that honey bees treated with a small dose of imidacloprid, comparable to what they would receive in nectar and formerly considered a safe amount, became "picky eaters,"  refusing nectars of lower sweetness and preferring to feed only on sweeter nectar.  It was also found that bees exposed to imidacloprid performed the "waggle dance," the movements that bees use to inform hive mates of the location of foraging plants, at a lesser rate.<ref name=PickyBee>{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=Kim|title=Commonly Used Pesticide Turns Honey Bees Into 'Picky Eaters'|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressreleases/commonly_used_pesticide_turns_honey_bees_into_picky_eaters/|publisher=[[UCSD]] News Center|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=23 May 2012}}</ref>

Researchers from the Canadian Forest Service showed that imidacloprid used on trees at realistic field concentrations decreases leaf litter breakdown due to adverse sub-lethal effects on non-target terrestrial invertebrates. The study did not find significant indication that the invertebrates, which normally decompose leaf litter, preferred non-contaminated leaves, and concluded that the invertebrates could not detect the imidacloprid.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kreutzweiser | first1 = DP. | last2 = Thompson | first2 = DG. | last3 = Scarr | first3 = TA. | title = Imidacloprid in leaves from systemically treated trees may inhibit litter breakdown by non-target invertebrates | journal = Ecotoxicol Environ Saf | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 1053–7 | month = May | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2008.09.017 | pmid = 18973940 }}</ref>

A 2012 ''in situ'' study provided strong  evidence that exposure
to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid in [[high fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) used to feed honey bees when forage is not available causes bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks post imidacloprid
dosing. The researchers suggested that "the observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/pesticide-tied-to-bee-colony-collapse/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=04.06.12%2520%281%29&utm_content |title=Pesticide tied to bee colony collapse &#124; Harvard Gazette |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref><ref name="Lu2012">{{cite journal|author=Chensheng Lu, Kenneth M.

Sub-lethal doses (<10 ppb) to [[aphid]]s have been found to lead to altered behavior, such as wandering and eventual starvation. Very low concentrations also reduced nymph viability.<ref name=Wollweber1999>{{cite encyclopedia | first = Detlef | last = Wollweber | first2 = Klaus | last2 = Tietjen | year = 1999 | title = Chloronicotinyl insecticides: a success of the new chemistry | pages = 109–125 | encyclopedia = Nicotinoid Insecticides and the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor | editor-first = Izuru | editor-last = Yamamoto | editor2-first = John | editor2-last = Casida | editor2-link = John E.

In January 2013, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] stated that neonicotinoids pose an unacceptably high risk to bees, and that the industry-sponsored science upon which regulatory agencies' claims of safety have relied may be flawed, concluding that, "A high acute risk to honey bees was identified from exposure via dust drift for the seed treatment uses in maize, oilseed rape and cereals. A high acute risk was also identified from exposure via residues in nectar and/or pollen."<ref name="EFSA" /> An author of a ''Science'' study prompting the EESA review suggested that industry science pertaining to neonicotinoids may have been deliberately deceptive, and the UK Parliament has asked manufacturer [[Bayer Cropscience]] to explain discrepancies in evidence they have submitted to an investigation.<ref name="carrington" />

===Birds===

In [[Northern_Bobwhite|bobwhite quail]] (''Colinus virginianus''), imidacloprid was determined to be moderately toxic with an acute oral [[LD50|LD<sub>50</sub>]] of 152&nbsp;mg a.i./kg. (this is a relatively large amount and exposure to this amount in real situations is highly unlikely) It was slightly toxic in a 5-day dietary study with an acute oral LC<sub>50</sub> of 1,420&nbsp;mg a.i./kg diet, a [[NOAEC]] of < 69&nbsp;mg a.i./kg diet, and a LOAEC = 69&nbsp;mg a.i./kg diet.  Exposed birds exhibited ataxia, wing drop, opisthotonos, immobility, hyperactivity, fluid-filled crops and intestines, and discolored livers.  In a reproductive toxicity study with bobwhite quail, the NOAEC = 120&nbsp;mg a.i./kg diet and the [[LOAEC]] = 240&nbsp;mg a.i./kg diet.  Eggshell thinning and decreased adult weight were observed at 240&nbsp;mg a.i./kg diet.<ref name="epa.gov"/><ref name="CanadianWaterQuality"/>

Imidacloprid is highly toxic to four bird species:  Japanese quail, house sparrow, canary, and pigeon.  The acute oral LD<sub>50</sub> for Japanese quail (''Coturnix coturnix'') is 31&nbsp;mg a.i./kg bw with a NOAEL = 3.1&nbsp;mg a.i./kg.  The acute oral LD<sub>50</sub> for house sparrow (''Passer domesticus'') is 41&nbsp;mg a.i./kg bw with a NOAEL = 3&nbsp;mg a.i./kg and a NOAEL = 6&nbsp;mg a.i./kg.  The LD<sub>50</sub>s for pigeon (''Columba livia'') and canary (''Serinus canaries'') are 25–50&nbsp;mg a.i./kg.  Mallard ducks are more resistant to the effects of imidacloprid with a 5-day dietary LC<sub>50</sub> of > 4,797 ppm.  The NOAEC for body weight and feed consumption is 69&nbsp;mg a.i./kg diet.  Reproductive studies with mallard ducks showed eggshell thinning at 240&nbsp;mg a.i./kg diet.<ref name="epa.gov"/><ref name=CanadianWaterQuality /> According to the European Food Safety Authority, imidacloprid poses a potential high acute risk for [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[Insectivore|insectivorous]] birds and [[Seed predation|granivorous]] mammals.  Chronic risk has not been well established.<ref name="efsa.europa.eu"/><ref name="CanadianWaterQuality"/>

===Aquatic life===

Imidacloprid is highly toxic on an [[Acute toxicity|acute]] basis to aquatic [[invertebrate]]s, with [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] values = 0.037 - 0.115 ppm. It is also highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates on a [[Chronic toxicity|chronic]] basis (effects on growth and movement):  [[NOAEC]]/[[LOAEC]] = 1.8/3.6 ppm in [[daphnid]]s; NOAEC = 0.001 in ''[[Chironomus]]'' midge, and NOAEC/LOAEC = 0.00006/0.0013 ppm in [[mysid shrimp]]. Its toxicity to fish is relatively low; however, the EPA has requested review of secondary effects on fish with [[food chain]]s that include sensitive aquatic invertebrates.<ref name="EPAproblem"/>

===Plant life===
Imidacloprid has been shown to turn off some genes that some rice varieties use to produce defensive chemicals. While imidacloprid is used for control of the brown planthopper and other rice pests, there is evidence that imidacloprid actually increases the susceptibility of the rice plant to planthopper infestation and attacks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Yao|coauthors=Shi, Zhao-Peng, Jiang, Li-Ben, Ge, Lin-Quan, Wu, Jin-Cai, Jahn, Gary C.|title=Possible connection between imidacloprid-induced changes in rice gene transcription profiles and susceptibility to the brown plant hopper Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Hemiptera: Delphacidae)|journal=Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology|volume=102|issue=3|pages=213–219|doi=10.1016/j.pestbp.2012.01.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357512000041|pmid=22544984|pmc=3334832|year=2012}}</ref>

==Health impact==
A Study conducted on rats suggests that the neonicotinoids may adversely affect human health, especially the developing brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kimura-Kuroda J, Komuta Y, Kuroda Y, Hayashi M, Kawano H | year = 2012 | title = Nicotine-Like Effects of the Neonicotinoid Insecticides Acetamiprid and Imidacloprid on Cerebellar Neurons from Neonatal Rats | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 2| page = e32432 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0032432 | editor1-last = Okamoto | editor1-first = Shu-Ichi }}</ref>

==Overdosage==

Persons who might orally ingest acute amounts would experience [[emesis]], [[diaphoresis]], [[drowsiness]] and [[disorientation]]. This would need to be intentional since a large amount would need to be ingested to experience a toxic reaction. In dogs the LD<sub>50</sub> is 450&nbsp;mg/Kg of body weight. Blood imidacloprid concentrations may be measured to confirm diagnosis in hospitalized patients or to establish the cause of death in postmortem investigations.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 764-765.</ref>
