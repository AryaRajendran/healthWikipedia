'''Benedikt syndrome''', also called Benedikt's syndrome or paramedic midbrain syndrome, is a rare type of posterior circulation [[stroke]] of the [[brain]], with a range of neurological symptoms affecting the [[midbrain]], [[cerebellum]] and other related structures.

==Characterization==
It is characterized by the presence of an  [[Oculomotor nerve palsy|oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy]] and cerebellar [[ataxia]] including tremor.  [[Neuroanatomy|Neuroanatomical]] structures affected include CNIII nucleus, Red nucleus, corticospinal tracts, brachium conjunctivum, and cerebellum. It is very similar in etiology, morphology and clinical presentation to [[Weber's syndrome]]; the main difference between the two being that Weber's is more associated with [[hemiplegia]] (i.e. paralysis), and Benedikt's with [[hemiparesis]] (i.e. weakness).

==Causes==
Benedikt syndrome is caused by a [[lesion]] ( [[infarction]], [[hemorrhage]], tumor, or [[tuberculosis]]) in the [[tegmentum]] of the midbrain and cerebellum. Specifically, the median zone is impaired. It can result from occlusion of the [[posterior cerebral artery]] <ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15607218 |year=2005 |month=Jan |author=Akdal G, Kutluk K, Men S, Yaka E |title=Benedikt and "plus-minus lid" syndromes arising from posterior cerebral artery branch occlusion |volume=228 |issue=1 |pages=105–107 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2004.09.029 |journal=Journal of the neurological sciences}}</ref> or paramedian penetrating branches of the basilar artery.<ref>AMA citation: Greenberg DA, Simon RP.

==Treatment==

[[Deep brain stimulation]] may provide relief from some symptoms of Benedikt syndrome, particularly the tremors associated with the disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18826349 |year=2008 |month=Oct |author=Bandt SK, Anderson D, Biller J |title=Deep brain stimulation as an effective treatment option for post-midbrain infarction-related tremor as it presents with Benedikt syndrome |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=635–639 |doi=10.3171/JNS/2008/109/10/0635 |journal=Journal of neurosurgery}}</ref>
