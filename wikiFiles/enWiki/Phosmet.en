'''Phosmet''' is a [[phthalimide]]-derived, non-systemic, [[organophosphate]] [[insecticide]] used on plants and animals. It is mainly used on apple trees for control of [[codling moth]], though it is also used on a wide range of fruit crops, ornamentals, and vines for the control of aphids, suckers, mites, and fruit flies.<ref name="Toxicology">{{cite web|url=http://extoxnet.orst.edu/pips/phosmet.htm|title=Toxicology of Phosmet|accessdate=2006-08-06|format=Webpage}}</ref>

==Safety==
Phosmet is on the US Emergency Planning [[List of Extremely Hazardous Substances]].  It is [[Pesticide toxicity to bees|highly toxic to bees]].<ref name="Toxicology" />

[[Mark Purdey]] has made the controversial suggestion that phosmet may have played a key role in the epidemic of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Purdey M |title=High-dose exposure to systemic phosmet insecticide modifies the phosphatidylinositol anchor on the prion protein: the origins of new variant transmissible spongiform encephalopathies? |journal=Med. Hypotheses |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=91–111 |year=1998 |pmid=9572563 |doi=10.1016/S0306-9877(98)90194-3}}</ref>

A 2010 study found that each 10-fold increase in urinary concentration of organophosphate metabolites was associated with a 55% to 72% increase in the odds of [[ADHD]] in children.<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/721892</ref>
