A '''Spitz nevus''' (also known as an "Epithelioid and spindle-cell nevus,"<ref name="Andrews" /> "Benign juvenile melanoma"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|691}}, and "Spitz's juvenile melanoma"<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=1728–30 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>) is a [[benign]] [[melanocytic nevus]], a type of [[skin]] lesion, affecting the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and [[dermis]].<ref name=who>LeBoit, PE, Burg G, Weedon D, Sarasin A. (Eds) '''World Health Organization Classification of Tumours: Pathology and Genetics of Skin Tumours'''. Lyon: ''IARC''Press. 2006.</ref>

Spitz nevus is also known as spindle and epithelioid cell nevus and juvenile melanoma.  The latter term is generally no longer used as it is misleading: it is not a melanoma, it is a benign lesion; it can also occur in adults, not only in children.<ref name=crotty>Crotty, K. Spitz Naevus: Histological features and distinction from malignant melanoma. '''Australasian Journal of Dermatology'''. 38 (suppl): S49-S53. 1997.</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Spitz nevi are uncommon.  Their annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] was estimated in a coastal population of [[sub-tropical]] [[Queensland]] to be 1.4 cases per 100,000 people.  For comparison, the annual incidence of [[melanoma]] in the same population, which is high by world standards<ref name="Stat">Ries LAG, et al., eds. SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975–2000. Bethesda, MD: National Cancer Institute; 2003: Tables XVI-1-9.</ref> is 25.4 cases per 100,000 people.<ref name=crotty/>

Although they are most commonly found on people in their first two decades of life,<ref name=who/> the age range for people with Spitz nevi is from 6 months to 71 years, with a [[arithmetic mean|mean]] age of 22 years and a [[median]] age of 19 years.<ref name=crotty/>

==Pathology==
[[Image:Spitz nevus - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a Spitz nevus showing the characteristic vertically arranged nests of cells ("hanging bananas"). [[H&E stain]].]]
The cause of Spitz nevi is not yet known.  There is an association with [[sunburn]], but causation is not established. <ref name=who/>  Genetic studies of Spitz nevi have shown that most cells have the normal number of [[chromosome]]s, however a minority (25%) of cells have been shown to contain extra copies of parts of some chromosomes, such as the short arm of [[Chromosome 11 (human)|chromosome 11]] (11p). <ref name=who/>

Spitz nevi characteristically have vertically arranged nests of nevus cells that have both a [[spindle cell|spindled]] and an [[epithelioid]] morphology.  [[apoptosis|Apoptotic]] cells may be seen at the [[dermoepidermal junction]].  The main [[histologic]] [[differential diagnoses]] are [[pigmented spindle cell nevus]] and [[malignant melanoma]].

==Eponym==
The lesion is named after [[Sophie Spitz]], the pathologist who originally described it in 1948.<ref name=spitz> Spitz S. Melanomas of childhood. '''Am. J. Pathol.'''1948;24:591-609.</ref>
