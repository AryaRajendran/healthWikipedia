In a very small percentage of the adult population, ''C. difficile'' bacteria naturally reside in the gut. Other people accidentally ingest spores of the bacteria while they are patients in a hospital (where 14,000 people a year in America alone die as a result),<ref>[http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21565586-bacterial-medicine-starting-emerge-bugs-system Treating disease with microbes: Bugs in the system | The Economist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> nursing home, or similar facility. When the bacteria are in a colon in which the normal gut flora has been destroyed (usually after a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as [[clindamycin]] has been used), the gut becomes overrun with ''C. difficile''. This overpopulation is harmful because the bacteria release toxins that can cause [[bloating]] and [[diarrhea]], with abdominal pain, which may become severe. ''C. difficile'' infections are the most common cause of pseudomembranous colitis, and in rare cases this can progress to [[toxic megacolon]], which can be life-threatening.

Latent symptoms of ''C. difficile'' infection often mimic some [[flu-like symptoms]] and can mimic disease flare in patients with [[inflammatory bowel disease]]-associated colitis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Binion |first1=David G |title=''Clostridium difficile'' and IBD |journal=Inflammatory Bowel Disease Monitor |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=7–14 |year=2010 |url=http://www.remedicajournals.com/Inflammatory-Bowel-Disease-Monitor/BrowseIssues/Volume-11-Issue-1/Article-Clostridium-difficile-and-IBD}}</ref> Mild cases of ''C. difficile'' infection can often be cured by discontinuing the antibiotics responsible.<ref name=Sherris /> In more serious cases, oral administration of, first, oral [[metronidazole]] and—if that fails—then, second, [[vancomycin]] and if unsuccessful again, intravenous metronidazole can be used.

== Signs and symptoms ==

In adults, a [[clinical prediction rule]] found the best [[medical sign|signs]] to be: significant diarrhea ("new onset of more than three partially formed or watery stools per 24 hour period"), recent antibiotic exposure, abdominal pain, fever (up to 40.5°C), and a distinctive foul stool odour.

With the introduction of [[broad-spectrum antibiotics]] and chemotherapeutic antineoplastic drugs{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} in the second half of the 20th century, antibiotic- and chemotherapy-associated diarrhea became more common. Pseudomembranous colitis was first described as a complication of ''C. difficile'' [[infection]] in 1978,<ref name=Larson_1978>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(78)90912-1 |title=Clostridium difficile and the aetiology of pseudomembranous colitis |year=1978 |month = May |last1=Larson |first1=HE |last2=Price |first2=AB |last3=Honour |first3=P |last4=Borriello |first4=SP |journal=The Lancet |volume=311 |issue=8073 |pages=1063–6 |pmid=77366}}</ref> when a toxin was isolated from patients suffering from pseudomembranous colitis and [[Koch's postulates]] were met.

The many spores formed by ''C. difficile'' are resistant to most routine cleaning methods used on surfaces (except for diluted bleach).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Spores of these bacteria can remain viable outside of the human body for very long periods of time, and this means the patients in a medical facility are often exposed to situations where they end up accidentally ingesting spores. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Extremely rigorous infection protocols are required to decrease or eliminate this risk.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/c-difficile/DS00736/DSECTION=prevention Mayo Clinic ''C. diff'' prevention]</ref>

''C. difficile'' infection (CDI) can range in severity from asymptomatic to severe and life-threatening, especially among the elderly. People are most often [[nosocomial]]ly infected in [[hospital]]s, [[nursing home]]s, or other medical institutions, although CDI in the community, outpatient setting is increasing. The rate of ''C. difficile'' acquisition is estimated to be 13% in patients with hospital stays of up to two weeks, and 50% in those with hospital stays longer than four weeks.<ref name=Clabots_1992>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/infdis/166.3.561 |title=Acquisition of Clostridium difficile by hospitalized patients: evidence for colonized new admissions as a source of infection |year=1992 |month = September |last1=Clabots |first1=CR |last2=Johnson |first2=S |last3=Olson |first3=MM |last4=Peterson |first4=LR |last5=Gerding |first5=DN |journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=166 |issue=3 |pages=561–7 |pmid=1323621}}</ref> ''C. difficile''-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is most strongly associated with [[fluoroquinolones]], [[cephalosporins]], [[carbapenems]], and [[clindamycin]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Baxter R, Ray GT, Fireman BH | title = Case-control study of antibiotic use and subsequent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients | journal = Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–50 | year = 2008 | month = January | doi = 10.1086/524320 | pmid = 18171186}}</ref><ref name="pmid17072575">{{cite journal| author=Gifford AH, Kirkland KB| title=Risk factors for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea on an adult hematology-oncology ward | journal=Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis | year= 2006 | month = December | volume= 25 | issue= 12 | pages= 751–5 | pmid=17072575 | doi=10.1007/s10096-006-0220-1 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16156323">{{cite journal| author=Palmore TN, Sohn S, Malak SF, Eagan J, Sepkowitz KA| title=Risk factors for acquisition of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea among outpatients at a cancer hospital | journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol | year= 2005 | month = August | volume= 26 | issue= 8 | pages= 680–4 | pmid=16156323 | doi=10.1086/502602 }}</ref> In addition to previous use of antimicrobials, use of [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s (PPI) is associated with a two-fold increase in risk for CDI.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2011.09.030 |title=Association between proton pump inhibitor therapy and Clostridium difficile infection in a meta-analysis |year=2012 | month = March |last1=Deshpande |first1=A |last2=Pant |first2=C |last3=Pasupuleti |first3=V |last4=Rolston |first4=DD |last5=Jain |first5=A |last6=Deshpande |first6=N |last7=Thota |first7=P |last8=Sferra |first8=TJ |last9=Hernandez |first9=AV |journal=Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=225–33 |pmid=22019794}}</ref>

=== Bacteriology ===

[[File:Clostridium difficile EM.png|thumb|Individual, drumstick-shaped ''C. difficile'' bacilli seen through [[scanning electron microscopy]]]]
Clostridia are [[Motility|motile]] [[bacteria]], ubiquitous in nature, and especially prevalent in soil. Under the microscope, clostridia appear as long, irregularly (often drumstick- or spindle-shaped) cells with a bulge at their terminal ends. Under [[Gram stain]]ing, ''C. difficile'' cells are [[Gram-positive]] and show optimum growth on [[blood agar]] at human body temperatures in the absence of [[oxygen]]. When stressed, the bacteria produce [[spore]]s that can tolerate extreme conditions that the active bacteria cannot tolerate.<ref name=Sherris/>

''C. difficile'' is a [[commensal bacterium]] of the human [[intestine]] in 2–5% of the population.<ref name=Sherris/> Long-term hospitalization or residence in a nursing home within the previous year are independent risk factors for increased [[Colony (biology)|colonization]].<ref name="Halsey">{{cite journal |doi=10.2146/ajhp070077 |title=Current and future treatment modalities for Clostridium difficile-associated disease |year=2008 |last1=Halsey |first1=J. |journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=705–15 |pmid=18387898}}</ref> In small numbers, ''C. difficile'' does not result in significant disease. [[Antibiotic]]s, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity (such as [[clindamycin]]) cause disruption of normal [[intestinal flora]], leading to an overgrowth of ''C. difficile'', which flourishes under these conditions. This can lead to [[pseudomembranous colitis]], the generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, [[fibrin]], and necrotic cells.<ref name=Sherris/>

[[File:How C. difficile spreads.png|thumb|How ''C. difficile'' spreads]]
Pathogenic ''C. difficile'' strains produce several known [[toxin]]s. The most well-characterized are [[enterotoxin]] ([[Clostridium difficile toxin A|''Clostridium difficile'' toxin A]]) and [[cytotoxin]] ([[Clostridium difficile toxin B|''Clostridium difficile'' toxin B]]), both of which are responsible for the [[diarrhea]] and [[inflammation]] seen in infected patients, although their relative contributions have been debated.<ref name=Sherris /> Toxins A and B are glucosyltransferases that target and inactivate the [[Rho family of GTPases]]. Toxin B (cytotoxin) induces actin depolymerization by a mechanism correlated with a decrease in the [[ADP-ribosylation]] of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI117747 |title=The low molecular mass GTP-binding protein Rho is affected by toxin a from ''Clostridium difficile'' |year=1995 |last1=Just |first1=I |last2=Selzer |first2=J |last3=Von Eichel-Streiber |first3=C |last4=Aktories |first4=K |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=1026–31 |pmid=7883950 |pmc=441436}}</ref> Another toxin, [[Pore-forming toxin#Binary toxins|binary toxin]], has also been described, but its role in disease is not yet fully understood.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/MMBR.68.3.373-402.2004 |title=Binary Bacterial Toxins: Biochemistry, Biology, and Applications of Common Clostridium and Bacillus Proteins |year=2004 |last1=Barth |first1=Holger |last2=Aktories |first2=Klaus |last3=Popoff |first3=Michel R. |last4=Stiles |first4=Bradley G. |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=373–402, table of contents |pmid=15353562 |pmc=515256}}</ref>

Antibiotic treatment of CDIs can be difficult, due both to [[antibiotic resistance]] and physiological factors of the bacteria itself (spore formation, protective effects of the pseudomembrane).<ref name=Sherris /> Pseudomembranous colitis caused by ''C. difficile'' is treated with specific antibiotics, for example, [[vancomycin]] (Vancocin) or [[metronidazole]] (Flagyl).

''C. difficile'' is transmitted from person to person by the [[fecal-oral route]]. However, the organism forms large numbers of heat-resistant spores, and these are not killed by alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine cleaning of surfaces. Thus, these spores remain viable in the [[hospital]] or [[nursing home]] environment for long periods of time, and, because of this, the bacteria can be cultured from almost any surface in the hospital. Once spores are ingested by a patient, they pass through the stomach unscathed because of their acid-resistance. They germinate into vegetative cells in the colon upon exposure to bile acids, and multiply.

Several [[disinfectant]]s commonly used in hospitals are ineffective against ''C. difficile'' spores, and may actually promote spore formation. However, disinfectants containing [[bleach]] are effective in killing the organisms.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4871840.stm | title=Cleaning agents 'make bug strong' | publisher=BBC News Online | date=2006-04-03 | accessdate=2008-11-17}}</ref>

=== Computed tomography ===

In a recent{{when|date=February 2013}} study, a patient who received a diagnosis of ''Clostridium difficile'' colitis (CDC) on the basis of [[computed tomography]] (CT scan) had an 88% probability of testing positive on stool assay.<ref name="pmid11222194">{{cite journal |first1=Iain D.

Once colon wall thickening is identified as being >4&nbsp;mm, the best ancillary findings were pericolonic stranding, [[ascites]], and colon wall nodularity. The presence of wall thickness plus any one of these ancillary findings is 70% sensitive and 93% specific.

Using criteria of ≥10&nbsp;mm or a wall thickness of >4&nbsp;mm and any of the more-specific findings does not add significantly to the diagnosis but gives equally satisfactory results. In this study with a prevalence of positive ''C. difficile'' toxin of 54%, the PPV was 88%. Patients who have antibiotic-associated diarrhea with CT findings diagnostic of CDC merit consideration for treatment on that basis.

=== Real-Time PCR ===

By the end of 2009, 3 different Real-Time PCR tests had achieved 510(k) clearance from the FDA.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Cepheid's GeneXpert is by far the fastest and easiest of the three, but it is also the most expensive. Cepheid uses a cartridge-based kit that is tailored for small hospitals or labs without the ability to batch large numbers of samples together. In fact, batching is not required since the extraction occurs in the same vial as amplification of the target, positive, and negative controls. The reported time from sample to result is ~45 minutes.

Prodesse offers another kit-based IVD Real-Time PCR test (ProGastro Cd), which uses an external extraction and purification on the Roche [[MagnaPure]]. Prodesse (Gen-Probe) tech support claims that this external separation produces higher yields than the BD GeneOhm. The Prodesse technique is similar in price to the BD GeneOhm technique after one includes the price of the extraction and takes about three hours from sample to result.

The final IVD ''Clostridium difficile'' Real Time PCR test on the market since 2009 is from BD GeneOhm. The protocol uses a glass-bead lysis rather than an extraction, but results are reported to be good and the method shaves a little over an hour off the protocol time (about 1 hour 45 minutes from sample to result). Total costs for the Prodesse and BD GeneOhm tests are approximately the same.

For each test, sensitivities are generally reported as 88–91% and specificities as 96–97%, depending on the tests, prevalence of the disease and the size of the patient pool.<ref name="pmid21890762">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cid/cir505 |title=Diagnostic Accuracy of Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction in Detection of ''Clostridium difficile'' in the Stool Samples of Patients with Suspected ''Clostridium difficile'' Infection: A Meta-Analysis |year=2011 |last1=Deshpande |first1=Abhishek |last2=Pasupuleti |first2=Vinay |last3=Rolston |first3=David D.

===Dogs===
One experimental technique for detecting C.Diff. is based on the observation that nurses were able to smell a faint but distinctive "C.Diff." smell on affected patients stools. It was then found that it was possible to train sniffer dogs to detect this smell on patients without taking a sample, with high specificity.<ref>Naked Scientist- Does a Frozen Body Shatter- 23-12-2012</ref>

==Prevention==
===Antibiotics===
The most effective method for preventing CDAD is proper antimicrobial prescribing. In the hospital setting, where CDAD is most common, nearly all patients that develop CDAD are exposed to antimicrobials. Although proper antimicrobial prescribing sounds easy to do, approximately 50% of antimicrobial use is considered inappropriate. This is consistent whether in the hospital, clinic, community, or academic setting. Several studies{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} have demonstrated a decrease in CDAD by limiting antibiotics most strongly associated with CDAD or by limiting unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing in general, both in outbreak and non-outbreak settings.

===Infection control===
Infection control measures, such as wearing gloves when caring for patients with CDAD, have been proven to be effective at prevention. This works by limiting the spread of ''C. difficile'' in the hospital setting. In addition, washing with soap and water will eliminate the spores from contaminated hands, but alcohol-based hand rubs are ineffective.<ref>{{cite web |author=Roehr B |title=Alcohol Rub, Antiseptic Wipes Inferior at Removing ''Clostridium difficile'' |date=21 September 2007 |publisher=Medscape |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/563232}}</ref> Bleach wipes containing 0.55 percent sodium hypochlorite have been shown to kill the spores and prevent transmission between patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nm.2405 |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110821141128.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=21 August 2011 |title=Host S-nitrosylation inhibits clostridial small molecule–activated glucosylating toxins |year=2011 |last1=Savidge |first1=Tor C |last2=Urvil |first2=Petri |last3=Oezguen |first3=Numan |last4=Ali |first4=Kausar |last5=Choudhury |first5=Aproteem |last6=Acharya |first6=Vinay |last7=Pinchuk |first7=Irina |last8=Torres |first8=Alfredo G |last9=English |first9=Robert D |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=1136–41 |pmid=21857653 |pmc=3277400}}</ref> Installing lidded toilets and closing the lid prior to flushing also reduces the risk of contamination.<ref>{{cite web |author=Laidman J |title=Flush With Germs: Lidless Toilets Spread ''C difficile'' |date=29 December 2011 |publisher=Medscape |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/756189}}</ref>

[[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide|Hydrogen peroxide vapor]] (HPV) systems used to sterilize a patient room post discharge has been shown to reduce infection rates and to reduce risk of infection to subsequent patients. One study (Boyce ''et al.'' 2008) showed that incidence of CDAD was reduced by 53% though use of HPV. A second study (Manian ''et al.'' 2010) showed a 42% reduction in [[CDAD]] rates through use of HPV.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

===Vaccine===
In a limited clinical trial, a ''C. difficile'' anti-[[toxoid]] [[vaccine]] was reported to improve people's outcomes. Further testing will be required to validate this trial.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1080/00365540801964960 |title=A randomized, double-blind study comparing ''Clostridium difficile'' immune whey and metronidazole for recurrent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea: Efficacy and safety data of a prematurely interrupted trial |year=2008 |last1=Mattila |first1=Eero |last2=Anttila |first2=Veli-Jukka |last3=Broas |first3=Markku |last4=Marttila |first4=Harri |last5=Poukka |first5=Paula |last6=Kuusisto |first6=Kaisa |last7=Pusa |first7=Liana |last8=Sammalkorpi |first8=Kari |last9=Dabek |first9=Jan |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=40 |issue=9}}</ref>

== Treatment ==

Asymptomatic colonization with ''C. difficile'' is common. Treatment in asymptomatic patients is controversial, also leading into the debate of [[clinical surveillance]] and how it intersects with public health policy. In general, mild cases do not require specific treatment.<ref name=Sherris/><ref name="pmid17636768">{{cite journal |author=Nelson R |title=Antibiotic treatment for ''Clostridium difficile''-associated diarrhea in adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3 |pages=CD004610 |year=2007 |pmid=17636768 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004610.pub3 |last2=Nelson |first2=Richard L |editor1-last=Nelson |editor1-first=Richard L}}</ref>

Patients should be treated as soon as possible when the diagnosis of ''Clostridium difficile'' colitis (CDC) is made to avoid frank [[sepsis]] or bowel perforation. To reduce complications, physicians often begin treatment based on clinical presentation before definitive results are available. Knowledge of the local epidemiology of intestinal flora of a particular institution can guide therapy. In addition, [[oral rehydration therapy|oral rehydration therapy (ORT)]] is useful in retaining fluids during the duration of diarrhea.

=== Medications ===

Three antibiotics are specifically effective against ''C. difficile''. With the available agents more or less equally effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Drekonja|first=DM|coauthors=Butler, M, MacDonald, R, Bliss, D, Filice, GA, Rector, TS, Wilt, TJ|title=Comparative effectiveness of ''Clostridium difficile'' treatments: a systematic review|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2011 Dec 20|volume=155|issue=12|pages=839–47|pmid=22184691|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-155-12-201112200-00007}}</ref>
*[[Metronidazole]] is the drug of choice, because of lower price and comparable efficacy.<ref name=Na2011/>
*Oral [[vancomycin]] is second line for mild to moderate cases and is recommended first line for severe disease.<ref name=Na2011/> Vancomycin is the treatment of choice in the following cases: no response to oral metronidazole; the organism is resistant to metronidazole; the patient is allergic to metronidazole; the patient is either pregnant, breastfeeding, or younger than 10 years of age. Vancomycin must be administered orally because [[intravenous]] administration does not achieve gut lumen minimum therapeutic concentration. People unresponsive to metronidazole can be placed on 14 days of vancomycin followed by [[rifaximin]] for another 14 days.
There is no difference between vancomycin and metronidazole in mild disease, however vancomycin was superior to metronidazole for treating severe disease.<ref name="pmid17599306">{{cite journal |author=Zar FA, Bakkanagari SR, Moorthi KM, Davis MB |title=A comparison of vancomycin and metronidazole for the treatment of ''Clostridium difficile''-associated diarrhea, stratified by disease severity |journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=302–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17599306 |doi=10.1086/519265}}</ref> In this study, severe disease was defined on a point score: One point each was given for age >60 years, temperature >38.3°C, albumin level <2.5&nbsp;mg/dL, or peripheral WBC count >15,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> within 48 h of enrollment. Two points were given for endoscopic evidence of [[pseudomembranous colitis]] or treatment in the intensive care unit. Severe disease was defined as 2 or more points on this score. The main criticism of this study is that a low, non-standard dose of metronidazole (250&nbsp;mg) was used instead of (500&nbsp;mg).

*[[Fidaxomicin]] has been found to be equally effective as vancomycin<ref>fda.gov 27 May 2011: [http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm257024.htm FDA approves treatment for ''Clostridium difficile'' infection]</ref> A study<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(11)70374-7 |title=Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for infection with ''Clostridium difficile'' in Europe, Canada, and the USA: A double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial |year=2012 |last1=Cornely |first1=Oliver A |last2=Crook |first2=Derrick W |last3=Esposito |first3=Roberto |last4=Poirier |first4=André |last5=Somero |first5=Michael S |last6=Weiss |first6=Karl |last7=Sears |first7=Pamela |last8=Gorbach |first8=Sherwood |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=281–9 |pmid=22321770 |last9=Opt-80-004 Clinical Study |first9=Group}}</ref> showed that the enduring treatment success of [[fidaxomicin]] is better than the previous medication.

Drugs used to stop [[diarrhea]] frequently worsen the course of ''C. difficile''-related pseudomembranous colitis. [[Loperamide]], [[diphenoxylate]], and [[bismuth]] compounds are contraindicated: slowing of fecal transit time is thought to result in extended toxin-associated damage.

[[Cholestyramine]], a powder drink (an [[ion exchange resin]]), which is occasionally used to lower cholesterol, is effective in binding both Toxin A and B, slowing bowel motility and helping prevent dehydration.<ref name=Stroehlein_2004>{{cite journal |author=Stroehlein J |title=Treatment of ''Clostridium difficile'' Infection |journal=Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=235–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15149585 |doi=10.1007/s11938-004-0044-y}}</ref> The dosage can be 4&nbsp;grams daily, to up to four doses a day; however caution should be exercised to prevent constipation, or drug interactions, most notably the binding of drugs by cholestyramine, preventing their absorption. Cholestyramine is not an anti-infective; it dramatically reduces many of the symptoms of a ''C. difficile'' infection, but it is not appropriate to use by itself, as it does not change the infection status. Cholestyramine is not recommended in concert with vancomycin. Powdered banana flakes given twice daily are an alternative to cholestyramine, and allow for stool bulking.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

=== Probiotics ===
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics in the treatment of active disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=MP|coauthors=van Dissel, JT; Kuijper, EJ|title=''Clostridium difficile'': controversies and approaches to management|journal=Current opinion in infectious diseases|date=2009 Dec|volume=22|issue=6|pages=517–24|pmid=19738464|doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e32833229ce}}</ref><ref name=Na2011/> and thus in this situation they are neither recommended as an adjunct to standard therapy or for use alone.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pillai|first=A|coauthors=Nelson, R|title=Probiotics for treatment of ''Clostridium difficile''-associated colitis in adults|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2008 January 23|issue=1|pages=CD004611|pmid=18254055|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004611.pub2|editor1-last=Pillai|editor1-first=Anjana}}</ref>

===Stool transplant===

[[Fecal bacteriotherapy]], known in colloquial terms as ''stool transplant'', a procedure related to [[probiotic]] research, has preliminarily been shown to cure the disease.<ref name="pmid23323867">{{Cite journal | last1 = van Nood | first1 = E | last2 = Vrieze | first2 = A | last3 = Nieuwdorp | first3 = M | last4 = Fuentes | first4 = S | last5 = Zoetendal | first5 = EG | last6 = de Vos | first6 = WM | last7 = Visser | first7 = CE | last8 = Kuijper | first8 = EJ | last9 = Bartelsman | first9 = JFWM | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1205037 | title = Duodenal Infusion of Donor Feces for Recurrent Clostridium difficile | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine|N.

The procedure replaces normal, healthy colonic flora that had been wiped out by antibiotics, and reestablishes the patient's resistance to colonization by ''Clostridium'' ''difficile''. However, there is often patient resistance due to the perceived unpleasantness of the procedure that must be overcome first before proceeding with this often-effective treatment.

=== Colectomy ===

In those patients that develop systemic symptoms of CDC, [[colectomy]] may improve the outcome if performed before the need for [[vasopressors]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

=== Recurrence ===

The evolution of protocols for patients with recurrent ''C. difficile'' diarrhea also present a challenge: There is no known proper length of time or universally accepted alternative drugs with which one should be treated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} However, re-treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin at the previous dose for 10 to 14 days is generally successful. The addition of [[rifampin]] to vancomycin also has been effective.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Prognosis==
After a first treatment with [[metronidazole]] or [[vancomycin]], ''Clostridium difficile'' recurs in about 20% of people.

==Society and culture==
=== Pronunciation ===

[[binomial nomenclature|Scientific name]]s of organisms are Latin or latinised Greek, in this case one of each. The anglicized pronunciation {{IPAc-en|k|l|ɒ|s|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|d|i|əm|_|d|ɨ|ˈ|f|ɪ|s|ɨ|l|iː}} is common, though a more classical {{IPAc-en|d|ɨ|ˈ|f|ɪ|k|ɨ|l|eɪ}} is also used. A common practice has developed of pronouncing ''difficile'' as {{IPAc-en|d|iː|f|i|ˈ|s|iː|l}}, as though it were French. The pronunciation varies because this is an example of [[international scientific vocabulary]] (ISV). The [[classical Latin]] sound is /dɨˈffɪkɨle/. One may also hear Spanish-influenced sound /diˈfi.si.le/ and Italian- or church-Latin-influenced sound /dɪfˈfi.tʃi.le/.

=== Notable outbreaks ===

*4 June 2003, two outbreaks of a highly virulent strain of this bacterium were reported in [[Montreal, Quebec]] and [[Calgary, Alberta]], in [[Canada]]. Sources put the death count as low as 36 and as high as 89, with approximately 1,400 cases in 2003 and within the first few months of 2004. ''C. difficile'' infections continued to be a problem in the Quebec healthcare system in late 2004. As of March 2005, it had spread into the [[Toronto, Ontario]] area, hospitalizing 10 people. One died while the others were being discharged.

*A similar outbreak took place at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in the [[United Kingdom]] between 2003 and 2005. The local [[epidemiology]] of ''C. difficile'' may offer clues on how its spread may relate to the amount of time a patient spends in hospital and/or a rehabilitation center. It also samples institutions' ability to detect increased rates, and their capacity to respond with more aggressive hand-washing campaigns, quarantine methods, and availability of yogurt containing live cultures to patients at risk for infection.

*It has been suggested that both the Canadian and English outbreaks were related to the seemingly more virulent Strain NAP1/027 of bacterium. This novel strain, also known as Quebec strain, has also been implicated in an epidemic at two Dutch hospitals ([[Harderwijk]] and [[Amersfoort]], both 2005). A theory for explaining the increased virulence of 027 is that it is a hyperproducer of both toxins A and B, and that certain antibiotics may actually stimulate the bacteria to hyperproduce.

*1 October 2006, ''C. difficile'' was said to have killed at least 49 people at hospitals in [[Leicester]], [[England]] over eight months, according to a [[National Health Service]] investigation. Another 29 similar cases were investigated by [[coroner]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Trust confirms 49 superbug deaths |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/5396800.stm | date=2006-10-01}}</ref> A UK Department of Health memo leaked shortly afterwards revealed significant concern in government about the bacterium, described as being "endemic throughout the health service"<ref name=hawkes2007>{{cite news

=== Genome sequencing ===
The first complete genome sequence of a ''Clostridium difficile'' strain was first published in 2005 by [[Sanger Institute]] in the UK. This was of the ''C. difficile'' strain 630, a virulent and multidrug-resistant strain isolated in Switzerland in 1982. Scientists at Sanger Institute have also recently{{when|date=February 2013}} sequenced genomes of about 30 ''Clostridium difficile'' isolates using next generation [[sequencing]] technologies from [[454 Life Sciences]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]].<ref name="pmid20368420">{{cite journal | author = He M, Sebaihia M, Lawley TD, ''et al.'' | title = Evolutionary dynamics of Clostridium difficile over short and long time scales | journal = [[Proc.

Researchers at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], sequenced the [[genome]] of the highly virulent Quebec strain of ''C. difficile'' in 2005 using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology. The tests involved doing 400,000 DNA parallel-sequencing reactions of the bacterium's genome, which had been fragmented for sequencing. These sequences were assembled computationally to form a complete genome sequence.<ref name=Loo_2005 /><ref>[http://www.iapm.ca/newsmanager/anmviewer.asp?a=144&z=14 Scientists map C. difficile strain] - Institute of Public Affairs, Montreal</ref>

<!-- Two closely-related strains of Clostridium difficile became antibiotic resistant and were able to rapidly spread to hospitals around the world, a study says.

Researchers were able to show how the bacterium travelled by forensically analysing its genetic code.

The strains of the hospital infection seemed to become more severe after they became resistant.

The findings were published in the journal Nature Genetics.

The US Centers for Disease Control say C. difficile is linked to 14,000 deaths in the US each year.

The infection has been in hospitals for decades. However, there was growing concern in the last decade after large outbreaks in Europe, the US and Canada.

They were caused by a once rare variant of C. difficile which has become the most common cause of the infection in North America.

Tracking
The genetic code of C. difficile mutates rapidly. By comparing the genetic code of batches of C. difficile, researchers can work out how related different batches of C. difficile are.

Doing this on a large scale, involving 151 samples from infections in 19 countries, allowed researchers to build up a picture of the spread of the antibiotic resistant strains.

It showed there was an strain called FQR1 which started in the US and spread across the country and to Switzerland and South Korea.

A second strain FQR2 started in Canada before spreading across North America, Europe and Australia. It entered the UK on four separate occasions.

Dr Trevor Lawley, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, told the BBC: "If we can understand how it happened there are lessons in that. It's a fact that two strains emerged which tells us this is more frequent than we realise and it is driven by antibiotic resistance.

"It also shows the global healthcare systems are completely interlinked - it showed up in the UK within months."

Prof Brendan Wren, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has been studying C. difficile for 25 years.

He said: "Once it became fluoroquinolone resistant, it just seemed to become more severe and transmissible."

"Not only is [the antibiotic] virtually useless against this organism, but resistance seem to have been a major factor in the continued evolution and persistence of these strains in hospitals and clinical settings."

The cost and time taken to sequencing the whole genome of a bacterium has plummeted. It took less than a day at a cost of £40-60.

The hope is that in the future researchers will be able to monitor the spread of diseases while outbreaks are happening as well as getting a better understanding of the disease and how to stop it.
