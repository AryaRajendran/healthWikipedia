==Symptoms==
The symptoms are nonspecific but are generally [[flu-like syndrome|flu-like]] including [[fever]], [[chills]], [[nausea]], [[headache]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[muscle ache]]s, [[joint pain]]s, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. A sweet or metallic taste in the mouth may also be reported along with a dry or irritated throat which may lead to hoarseness. <ref>[http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/201203/201203Wong.pdf]</ref> Symptoms of a more severe metal toxicity may also include a burning sensation in the body, shock, no urine output, collapse, convulsions, shortness of breath, yellow eyes or yellow skin, rash, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhea or low blood pressure, which require prompt medical attention.<ref name="Medline Zinc" >[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002570.htm "Medline Medical Encyclopedia: Zinc"]</ref> Milder flu-like symptoms will normally disappear within 24 to 48 hours, and someone suffering from metal fume fever will usually feel well enough to return to work the next day, despite the fact that they may still be feeling a little bit under the weather. It often takes 4 days to fully recover.

==Cause==
Metal fume fever is due to the inhalation of certain metals, either as fine dust or most commonly as fumes. Simple compounds of the metals, such as their oxides, are equally capable of causing it. The effects of ''particularly'' toxic compounds, such as [[nickel carbonyl]], are not considered as a mere metal fume fever.

Exposure usually arises through hot metalworking processes, such as smelting and casting of zinc alloys, or welding of galvanized metals. If the metal concerned is particularly high-risk, then cold sanding processes may also cause it, even though the dose is lower. This may also occur with electroplated surfaces or metal-rich anti-corrosion paint, such as cadmium passivated steel or [[zinc chromate]] primer on aluminium aircraft parts. Exposure has also been reported in use of lead free ammunition, by the harder steel core stripping excess metal from the jacket of the bullet and barrel of the rifle.<ref>http://forsvaret.no/aktuelt/publisert/nyheter/Sider/blyfri-ammo-helseplager.aspx</ref>

The most plausible mechanism accounting for the symptoms involves a dose-dependent release of certain cytokines, an event which occurs by inhaled metal oxide fumes which injure the lung cells. This is not an allergic reaction, though allergic reactions to metal fumes can occur.   <ref>[Kunimasa K, et al. Chemical Pneumonitis and Acute Lung Injury Caused by Inhalation of Nickel Fumes. Internal Medicine. 50:2035-2038, 2011]</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis primarily depends upon a good occupational history. Diagnosis of metal fume fever can be easily missed, as the complaints are non-specific, resemble a number of other common illnesses, and presentation occurs typically 1-2 days after the exposure. When respiratory symptoms are prominent, metal fume fever may be confused with acute [[bronchitis]] or pneumonia. The diagnosis is based primarily upon a history of exposure to metal oxide fumes.  Cain and Fletcher (2010) report a case of metal fume fever that was diagnosed only by taking a full occupational history and by close collaboration between primary and secondary health care personnel.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/occmed/kqq036}}</ref>

Physical examination findings vary among persons exposed, depending largely upon the stage in the course of the syndrome during which examination occurs. Patients may present with wheezing or crackles in the lungs. They typically have an increased white blood cell count, and urine, blood plasma and skin zinc levels may (unsurprisingly) be elevated. Chest X-ray findings may also be present. <ref>[Kunimasa K, et al. Chemical Pneumonitis and Acute Lung Injury Caused by Inhalation of Nickel Fumes. Internal Medicine. 50:2035-2038, 2011]</ref>

An interesting feature of metal fume fever involves rapid adaptation to the development of the syndrome following repeated metal oxide exposure. Workers with a history of recurrent metal fume fever often develop a tolerance to the fumes. This tolerance, however, is transient, and only persists through the work week. After a weekend hiatus, the tolerance has usually disappeared. This phenomenon of tolerance is what led to the name "Monday Fever".

In 2006, there were approximately 700 metal fume exposures reported to United States [[Poison control center]]. The [[American Welding Society]] estimated that 2500 employees in the steel industry develop metal fume fever in the US each year since the majority of the cases are not reported.

==Treatment==
Treatment of mild metal fume fever consists of bedrest, and symptomatic therapy (e.g. aspirin for headaches) as indicated. In the case of non-allergic acute lung injury in the setting of metal fume fever, a standard or even recommended approach to treatment has not been studied. <ref>[Kunimasa K, et al. Chemical Pneumonitis and Acute Lung Injury Caused by Inhalation of Nickel Fumes. Internal Medicine. 50:2035-2038, 2011]</ref>  

A traditional remedy is to consume large quantities of [[cow's milk]], either before or immediately after exposure.<ref name="Chastain" />

==Prevention==
Prevention of metal fume fever in workers who are at potential risk (such as [[welder]]s) involves avoidance of direct contact with potentially toxic fumes, improved engineering controls (exhaust ventilation systems), personal protective equipment (respirators), and education of workers regarding the features of the syndrome itself and proactive measures which can be taken to prevent its development.

Particularly for cadmium, the design of the product may be changed so as to eliminate it. [[NiCd]] rechargeable batteries are being replaced by [[NiMH]]. Cadmium plating is replaced with zinc or nickel. Silver solder alloys now rarely contain it.
