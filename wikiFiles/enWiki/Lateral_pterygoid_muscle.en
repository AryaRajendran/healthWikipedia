The '''lateral pterygoid''' (or '''external pterygoid''') is a muscle of [[mastication]] with two heads. It lies superiorly to the [[medial pterygoid muscle|medial pterygoid]].

==Origin and insertion==
The upper/superior head originates on the infratemporal surface and infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] bone, and the lower/inferior head on the lateral surface of the [[lateral pterygoid plate]].

Inferior head inserts onto the neck of [[condyloid process]] of the [[Human mandible|mandible]]; upper/superior head inserts onto the [[articular disc]] and [[fibrous membrane of articular capsule|fibrous capsule]] of the [[temporomandibular joint]].

==Innervation==
The mandibular branch of the fifth cranial nerve,  the [[trigeminal nerve]], specifically the [[lateral pterygoid nerve]], innervates the lateral pterygoid muscle.

==Function==
The primary function of the lateral pterygoid muscle is to pull the head of the condyle out of the [[mandibular fossa]] along the articular eminence to protrude the mandible. A concerted effort of the lateral pterygoid muscles acts in helping lower the mandible and open the jaw whereas unilateral action of a lateral pterygoid produces contralateral excursion (a form of [[mastication]]), usually performed in concert with the [[Medial pterygoid muscle|medial pterygoids]].

Unlike the other three muscles of mastication, the lateral pterygoid is the only muscle of mastication that assists in depressing the mandible (opening the jaw). At the beginning of this action it is assisted by the [[digastric]], [[mylohyoid muscle|mylohyoid]] and [[geniohyoid]] muscles.
