'''The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet''' is a [[low-fat]], low-calorie [[dieting|weight-loss diet]] system and accompanying book (''The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program'') by [[Scarsdale, New York]] [[physician]] [[Herman Tarnower]] with the co-author [[Samm Sinclair Baker]].

==Scarsdale Medical Diet==
The '''Scarsdale Medical Diet''' specifies a very specific and structured diet that is to be followed exactly for the first 14 days, another 14 day period follows that still specifies certain foods to eat, but is less structured and allows additional foods.<ref>{{cite web

Critics acknowledge that the diet gives quick results but say that weight loss on the plan results simply from the reduced caloric intake, and is mostly water weight that is quickly regained.<ref>{{cite journal  | last =Swartz | first =Jacqueline   | title =The sense and nonsense of the best-selling diet books.  | journal =Canadian Medical Association Journal  | volume =126  | pages =696–701  | publisher =Canadian Medical Association | date =March 15, 1982  }}</ref> In addition, critics argue that the diet is no better than any other diet that changes eating behavior.

==Book==
The book, originally published in 1978, received an unexpected boost in popular sales when its author, [[Herman Tarnower]], was murdered on March 10, 1980, by his long-time lover [[Jean Harris]], the headmistress of [[The Madeira School]], a fashionable boarding school for high school girls in [[McLean, Virginia]]. The murder was the subject of a 2005 made-for-TV movie called ''[[Mrs. Harris (film)|Mrs. Harris]]''.
