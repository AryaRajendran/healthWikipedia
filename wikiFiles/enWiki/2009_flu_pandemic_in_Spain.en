In March and April 2009, an [[outbreak]] of a new strain of [[influenza]] commonly referred to as [[swine flu]] infected many people in [[Mexico]] and parts of the [[United States]], causing severe illness in the former. The new strain was identified as a combination of several different strains of [[Influenzavirus A]], subtype [[H1N1]], including separate strains of this subtype circulating in humans (see [[Human influenza]]) and in pigs (see [[Swine influenza]]).

[[File:Video xo.ogv|thumb|left|In this video, Dr. Joe Bresee, with CDC's Influenza Division, describes the symptoms of swine flu and warning signs to look for that indicate the need for urgent medical attention. <br /> See also: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wK1127fHQ4&feature=channel_page See this video with subtitles in YouTube]]]

== First case in Europe ==
On April 27, Spain confirmed the first case of Swine influenza in Europe. The patient was a 23-year-old man that had returned from Mexico on the 22nd. The case was confirmed in the [[province of Albacete]].

On April 28, a second case was confirmed in [[Valencian Community|Valencia]]. The patient had traveled to Mexico with the first confirmed patient.

== Response ==
The Health and Social Policy minister, [[Trinidad Jiménez]], announced that all passengers coming from [[Mexico]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Colombia]], [[France]] and [[Israel]] have to fill a form during their flight.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/04/27/espana/1240832632.html Los aeropuertos españoles, 'blindados' ante la epidemia], In Spanish</ref>

There has been a reinforcement of medical teams on all airports to handle possible swine flu cases.

The [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] recommended to cancel any travel to [[Mexico]] unless strictly necessary. It also recommended to re evaluate the need to travel to the [[United States]].

The [[Spanish government]] has several million doses of [[Tamiflu]] on hand if necessary.
