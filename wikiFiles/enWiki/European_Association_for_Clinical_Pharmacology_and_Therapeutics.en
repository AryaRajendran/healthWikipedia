The '''European Association for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics''' (EACPT) is a [[learned society]] in the field of [[clinical pharmacology]]. It is the leading society in Europe serving the European and global clinical pharmacology and therapeutics community. It has its origins in a working party in the early 1980s under the auspices of the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO-Europe). Subsequently, a committee was created in 1993 chaired by Folke Sjöqvist<ref>http://kikatalogen.ki.se/kikat/faces/personView.xhtml?lin=674821</ref> with the remit to prepare the first congress of EACPT, held in Paris in 1995.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00194942 |title=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology becomes the official organ of European Association for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |year=1995 |last1=Dahlqvist |first1=Rune |last2=Lange |first2=Rolf |last3=Cheymol |first3=Georges |last4=Orme |first4=Michael |last5=Sjöqvist |first5=Folke |journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=48 |issue=5}}</ref> At that congress the founding EACPT Council elected an Executive Committee with Sjöqvist as chairman, Michael Orme (United Kingdom) as Honorary Secretary, Jochen Kuhlmann (Germany) as Treasurer, and Giampaolo Velo (Italy) as Vice-Chairman, with 26 European countries as members through their home country clinical pharmacology society or section.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eacpt.org/?q=node/1 |title=EACPT Historical Make up of Exec Comm Sept 2007 &#124; European Association for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |publisher=Eacpt.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-13}}</ref> The EACPT now includes all national organisations for clinical pharmacology in Europe and provides educational and scientific support for the more than 4000 individual professionals interested in clinical pharmacology and therapeutics throughout the European region, with its congresses attended by a global audience.
