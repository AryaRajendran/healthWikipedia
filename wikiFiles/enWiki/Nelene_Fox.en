'''Nelene Hiepler Fox''' (January 9, 1953 - April 22, 1993) was a [[California]] woman diagnosed with advanced [[breast cancer]]. She requested her [[HMO]] to pay for High-Dose [[Chemotherapy]] and [[Bone marrow transplant|Bone Marrow Transplant]] ([[HDC/BMT]]) to treat her cancer. Her [[health maintenance organization]], Health Net, declined her request, stating this therapy was an unproven, experimental therapy. She ultimately received her BMT after raising $212,000, but died eight months later, aged 40.  

Her estate sued and received $5 million due to the denial.  Subsequent research proved that HDC/BMT was a harmful treatment for breast cancer patients, and it is no longer used.

==Lawsuit==
Her [[Estate (law)|estate]] brought suit against [[Health Net]], and won a judgment for $89 million against Health Net, including $12.1 for bad faith and reckless infliction of emotional distress, and $77 million in [[punitive damages]]. ''Jim Fox and the estate of Nelene Fox v. Health Net'' is considered a watershed case in that most health insurers subsequently began approving HDC/BMT for advanced breast cancer.<ref name=Mukherjee>{{cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=Siddhartha|title=The Emperor of All Maladies|year=2011|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=9780007435814|url=http://books.google.co.za/books?id=wiJN_pHHLHsC}}</ref> This judgment was subsequently negotiated down to $5 million.

==Consequences==
By September 1994, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which covers employees of the United States' federal government, began requiring all of its health plans to pay for [[HDC/BMT]] for advanced breast cancer. The State of California subsequently passed a law requiring [[health insurance]] to pay for HDC/BMT.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Subsequent research reportedly shows that HDC/BMT for advanced breast cancer does not extend life, worsens quality of life, increases the number of days hospitalized, and costs an additional $55,000 <ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0YUG/is_8_9/ai_n18608560/ Excerpt from ''Transplant News'', April 30, 1999]</ref>

==Opinion==
Some researchers claim that the politicization of HDC/BMT for breast cancer made it more difficult to recruit women into randomized trials to evaluate its efficacy, as most women did not wish to take the chance of being randomized into the conventional treatment arms of such studies.<ref name=Mukherjee />
