'''Spondyloarthropathy''' is any [[joint disease]] of the [[vertebral column]].<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/spondyloarthropathy thefreedictionary.com/spondyloarthropathy] citing:
*Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. © 2009
*Miller-Keane Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied Health, Seventh Edition. © 2003
*Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. © 2007</ref>  As such, it is a class or category of diseases rather than a single, specific entity.  It differs from [[spondylopathy]], which is a disease of the vertebra itself.  However, many conditions involve both spondylopathy and spondyloarthropathy. 

Spondyloarthropathy with inflammation is called '''spondylarthritis'''. In the broadest sense, the term spondyloarthropathy includes joint involvement of vertebral column from any type of joint disease, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[osteoarthritis]], but the term is often used for a specific group of disorders with certain common features, the group often being termed specifically '''seronegative spondylarthropathies'''. They have an increased incidence of [[HLA-B27]], as well as negative [[rheumatoid factor]] and [[Anti-nuclear antibody|ANA]]. [[Enthesopathy]] is also sometimes present in association with seronegative spondarthritides. 

Nonvertebral symptoms of spondyloarthropathies include asymmetric peripheral arthritis (which is distinct from [[rheumatoid arthritis]]), arthritis of the Toe IP Joints, [[sausage digits]], achilles tenosynovitis, [[plantar fasciitis]], [[costochondritis]], [[iritis]], and mucocutaneous lesions. However, [[lower back pain]] is the most common clinical presentation of the disease; this back pain is unique because it decreases with activity.

==Seronegative spondyloarthropathy==
''Seronegative spondyloarthropathy'' (or ''seronegative spondyloarthritis'') is a group of diseases involving the [[axial skeleton]]<ref name="pmid17364081">{{cite journal |author=Howe HS, Zhao L, Song YW, ''et al.'' |title=Seronegative spondyloarthropathy--studies from the Asia Pacific region |journal=Ann. Acad. Med. Singap. |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=135–41 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17364081 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf/36VolNo2Feb2007/V36N2p135.pdf}}</ref> and having a negative [[serostatus]].

"Seronegative" refers to the fact that these diseases are negative for [[rheumatoid factor]],<ref name="urlSeronegative Spondyloarthropathies: Joint Disorders: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec04/ch034/ch034d.html |title=Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies: Joint Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |work= |accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> indicating a different pathophysiological mechanism of disease than what is commonly seen in [[rheumatoid arthritis]].
