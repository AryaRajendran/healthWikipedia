[[Image:direct DNA damage.png|thumb|right|500px| Direct DNA damage: The UV-photon is directly absorbed by the DNA (left). One of the possible reactions from the excited state is the formation of a thymine-thymine cyclobutane dimer (right). The direct DNA damage leads to sunburn, causing an increase in melanin production, thereby leading to a long-lasting tan. However, it is responsible for only 8% of all melanoma.]]

'''Direct DNA damage''' can occur when DNA directly absorbs the UV-B-photon. UVB light causes [[thymine]] base pairs next to each other in genetic sequences to bond together into [[pyrimidine dimers]], a disruption in the strand, which reproductive enzymes cannot copy. It causes [[sunburn]] and it triggers the production of [[melanin]].<ref name=Parrish1982>{{cite journal |author=John A. Parrish, Kurt F. Jaenicke, R.

Due to the excellent photochemical properties of DNA, this nature-made molecule is damaged only by a tiny fraction of the absorbed photons. DNA transforms more than 99.9% of the photons into harmless heat<ref name="DNA_IC"/> (But the damage from the remaining < 0.1% of the photons is still enough to cause [[sunburn]]).<ref name="Parrish1982"/> The transformation of excitation energy into harmless heat occurs via a photochemical process called [[internal conversion (chemistry)|internal conversion]]. In DNA, this [[internal conversion (chemistry)|internal conversion]] is extremely fast—and therefore efficient. This ultrafast (subpicosecond) [[internal conversion (chemistry)|internal conversion]] is an extremely powerful [[photoprotection]] provided by single nucleotides.<ref name=DNA_IC>{{cite web |url= http://www.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~kohler/dna.html |title=ultrafast internal conversion of DNA |accessdate=2008-02-13 |work= }}</ref> However, the Ground-State Recovery is much slower (picoseconds) in G·C−DNA duplexes and hairpins.<ref>Ground-State Recovery Following UV Excitation is Much Slower in G·C−DNA Duplexes and Hairpins Than in Mononucleotides: Carlos E. Crespo-Hernndez†, Kimberly de La Harpe and Bern Kohler. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja802183s</ref> It is presumed to be even slower for double-stranded DNA in conditions of the nucleus.
The absorption spectrum of DNA shows a strong absorption for UVB-radiation and a much lower absorption for UVA-radiation. Since the action spectrum of sunburn is identical to the absorption spectrum of DNA, it is generally accepted that the direct DNA damages are the cause of sunburn.<ref name="Parrish1982" /> 
While the human body reacts to direct DNA damages with a painful warning signal,<ref name="Parrish1982"/> no such warning signal is generated from [[indirect DNA damage]].

==Sunscreen and melanoma==

A study by Hanson suggests [[sunscreen]] that penetrates into the skin and thereby amplifies the amount of [[free radicals]] and [[oxidative stress]]
<ref name="Hanson">{{cite journal |author=Hanson Kerry M.; Gratton Enrico; Bardeen Christopher J. |title=Sunscreen enhancement of UV-induced reactive oxygen species in the skin |doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.06.011| journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=1205–1212 |year=2006 |pmid=17015167 }}</ref> contributes to the formation of melanoma, but this idea has not been validated by other researchers.

== Effect of topical sunscreen and effect of absorbed sunscreen ==
The direct DNA damage is reduced by sunscreen. This prevents sunburn. When the sunscreen is at the surface of the skin, it filters the UV-rays, which attenuates the intensity. Even when the sunscreen molecules have penetrated into the skin, they protect against the direct DNA damage, because the UV-light is absorbed by the sunscreen and not by the DNA.<ref name=KnowlandGulston1999>{{cite journal |author=Gulston M, Knowland J.  |year= 1999 |month=July |title= Illumination of human keratinocytes in the presence of the sunscreen ingredient Padimate-O and through an SPF-15 sunscreen reduces direct photodamage to DNA but increases strand breaks  |journal=Mutat Res.  |volume= 444 |issue=1  |pages=49–60 |id= |pmid=10477339}}</ref>
