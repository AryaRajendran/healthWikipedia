The [[2009 flu pandemic]], involving an [[outbreak]] of a new strain of [[influenza]] commonly known as [[Swine influenza|swine flu]] (usually referred as ''grippe A'' or ''grippe porcine'' in French), reached [[France]] in early May 2009.

In order to respond to flu epidemics in France, the government has a "national plan",<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.pandemie-grippale.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/PLAN_PG_2009.pdf Plan national de prevention et de lutte "Pandemie grippale"]. Accessed 2009-08-28.  [http://www.webcitation.org/5jglVSV7q Archived] 2009-09-10.</ref> which is also applied for this flu pandemic. In this plan, the different phases of the flu, which are slightly different from the [[World Health Organization]] phases, are detailed.
