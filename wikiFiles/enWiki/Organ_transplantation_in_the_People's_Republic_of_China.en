'''Organ transplantation in the People's Republic of China''' has taken place since the 1960s, and is one of the largest [[organ transplant]] programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004.<ref name=Lancet/> China is also involved in innovative transplant surgery such as [[face transplantation]] including bone.<ref name=bone/>

Involuntary [[organ harvesting]] is illegal under Chinese law; though, under a 1984 regulation, it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. Growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations, by the 1990s, to start condemning the practice.<ref name=TTS>{{cite web|url=https://www.dafoh.org/TTS__policy_on_Interactions.php |title=TTS' policy on Interactions with China |publisher=Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting |accessdate=24 May 2010 }}</ref> These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations. Further, in 2006, there were claims of harvesting of organs from live practitioners of the persecuted spiritual movement [[Falun Gong]],  which led to a disputed report being compiled by former Canadian parliamentarian [[David Kilgour]] and human rights lawyer [[David Matas]]. The report makes 17 recommendations, including that China immediately put an end to the practice. Other key recommendations include mobilizing the Canadian government and other parties to conduct their own investigations, denying or revoking the passports of people traveling to China for organ transplants, barring Chinese doctors from entering other countries to seek training in organ transplantation, and urging Chinese authorities to conduct a criminal investigation for possible prosecution.<ref name=epochtimes>http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-7-7/43638.html</ref> Kilgour and Matas assessed 18 different elements of proof or disproof, all of which they say are "verifiable and in most cases incontestable." <ref name=epochtimes/> One of the elements they considered was the backdrop of the current climate in China, one marked by corruption, human rights violations and a state policy of persecution against Falun Gong that includes repression, hate incitement, and massive arrests.<ref name=epochtimes/> While not revealing exact figures, the Chinese authorities have not denied the practice of taking organs from executed prisoners, and have taken steps to address international concerns regarding both the State's reliance on executed prisoners for organ donation and the illegal trading of these organs which in 2005 they acknowledged had occurred. They have consistently denied the allegations of removing organs from living Falun Gong practitioners. In 2007, China issued regulations banning the commercial trading of organs,<ref name="www.chinadaily.com.cn">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-04/10/content_9711027.htm |title=New system to boost number of organ donors |work=China Daily |accessdate=21 May 2010 }}</ref> and the Chinese Medical Association agreed that the organs of prisoners should not be used for transplantation, except for members of the immediate family of the deceased.<ref name=CMA>Press release, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/84754.php "Chinese Medical Association Reaches Agreement With World Medical Association Against Transplantation Of Prisioners's (sic) Organs"], ''Medical News Today'', 7 October 2007 retrieved 24 September 2010</ref>

==International concerns==
Transplantation first began in the early 1970s China, when organs were sourced from executed prisoners. Although other sources, such as brain-dead donors, had been tried, the lack of legal framework hampered efforts. Dr Klaus Chen said in 2007 that this was still the dominant pool.<ref name=chen/> Concerns that some poorer countries were answering donor shortages by selling organs to richer countries led the [[World Medical Association]] (WMA) to condemn the purchase and sale of human organs for transplantation at Brussels in 1985,<ref name=Geneva/> and at Stockholm in 1994.<ref name=icrc>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList302/87DC95FCA3C3D63EC1256B66005B3F6C |title=The Bellagio Task Force Report on Transplantation, Bodily Integrity, and the International Traffic in Organs |publisher=www.icrc.org |accessdate=14 June 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> In Madrid in 1987, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) condemned the practice of extracting organs from executed prisoners due to the difficulty of knowing if they had given consent.<ref name=Hillman/> Growing concern led other professional societies and human rights organisations to condemn the practice in the 1990s,<ref name=TTS/> and to question the way in which the organs were obtained.<ref name=tidyup/> The WHO starting drafting an international guideline (WHA44.25) on human organ transplants in 1987<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ethics/topics/human_transplant_report/en/index.html |title=Human organ and tissue transplantation |publisher=WHO |accessdate=23 September 2010 }}</ref> which resulted in the ''WHO Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation'' being endorsed in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ethics/topics/transplantation_guiding_principles/en/index.html |title=Draft guiding principles on human organ transplantation |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> However, the wording did not allow the international community to draw up any laws preventing China from continuing to trade in human organs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/prisonorgans.htm |title=Illegal Human Organ Trade from Executed Prisoners in China |publisher=www1.american.edu |accessdate=9 June 2010 }}</ref>

In June 2011 the US added a question to its DS-160 application for non-immigrant visas. The application asks if the person has ever taken part in forced human organ transplantation.<ref name= ntdtv>http://ntdtv.org/en/news/world/north-america/2012-10-26/nyu-medical-ethics-director-urges-us-to-release-information-on-organ-harvesting-in-china.html</ref>

No straight answers have been produced by the Chinese regime over the allegations of state-sanctioned organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners, said Manfred Nowak, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture.“The Chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparent,” said Nowak in an interview with The Epoch Times. “It remains to be seen how it could be possible that organ transplant surgeries in Chinese hospitals have risen massively since 1999, while there are never that many voluntary donors available.” <ref name="Nowak"/> Nowak has submitted two reports to the U.N. Human Rights Council formally requesting the Chinese regime respond to the allegations. The report states, in part, that, “The [Falun Gong] practitioners were given injections to induce heart failure, and therefore were killed in the course of the organ harvesting operations or immediately thereafter.” “Nothing seems to have changed for the better,” said Nowak. The majority of the inmates in the forced labor camps were Falun Gong members. And that is so frightening, because none of these people were ever given the benefit of a trial. They were never charged”, he said.<ref name=Nowak/>

On 12 September 2012, the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs heard the testimonies of experts about organ harvesting in China. Ethan Gutmann, an investigative journalist, referred to the body of witness testimony, much of which he has wrangled, from former surgeons and nurses who have direct knowledge of organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. He has also interviewed imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners who have been tested for their blood type, which is needed for their organs to be harvested. He lamented the lack of interest in the West in the evidence that he and others have worked to accumulate, and urged the committee to invite the witnesses to be cross-examined.<ref name=uscongress>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/united-states/congress-hones-in-on-vast-organ-harvest-in-china-291603.html</ref> Dr. Gabriel Danovitch, a professor of medicine at UCLA, noted the efforts that international medical organizations have made to change abusive Chinese organ sourcing practices. Dr. Damon Noto, the spokesman with the medical society Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, presented a careful historical analysis of the beginnings of organ harvesting by the CCP, and ran through a narrative that led to the ultimate conclusion that the Party has harvested the organs of up to 60,000 Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. The CCP’s military apparatus began with death row prisoners in the 1990s and after 1999 moved on to the newly persecuted Falun Gong population. There was an “exponential increase in transplantations” from 2000 onward, Noto said.<ref name=uscongress/>

Arthur Caplan, a Professor of Medical Ethics and the Director of the Langone Medical Center and School of Medicine of New York University, said that the release of any information on forced organ removal is the first step in stopping the practice. "Having this release of information is very important. I am very pleased that these Congressmen have called for this release and I hope that the state department responds quickly”, he said. He also said the evidence that this is happening in China should not be in question.<ref name="ntdtv"/> Dr. Caplan also called on the American scientific and medical community to actively boycott transplant information and research coming from China.<ref name=ntdtv/>

==Developments since 2006==

In March 2006, the Ministry of Health issued the ''Interim Provisions on Clinical Application and Management of Human Organ Transplantation'', which stipulated that medical centres must meet new requirements for transplant services; the provinces were made responsible for plans for clinical applications. Establishments performing transplantation were thereby obliged to incorporate considerations for ethics, medical and surgical expertise, and intensive care. In April 2006, the Committee of Clinical Application of Human Organ Transplantation Technologies was created to standardise clinical practice; a national summit on clinical management took place in November 2006 which issued a declaration outlining regulatory steps.<ref name=Lancet/> Professor Guo Shuzhong conducted a series of [[face transplant]] experiments in Xijing hospital, leading in April 2006 to the world’s first face transplant that included bone.<ref name=bone/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9010-worlds-second-face-transplant-performed-in-china.html |title=World's second face transplant performed in China – health – 18&nbsp;April 2006 – New Scientist |publisher=www.newscientist.com |accessdate=24 September 2010 }}</ref> The donor had been declared brain-dead before the operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.dailynewscentral.com/content/view/2210/63 |title=Chinese Man Gets World's Second Face Transplant |publisher=health.dailynewscentral.com |accessdate=25 September 2010 }}</ref>

In May 2007 the Regulation on Human Organ Transplantation came into force, banning organ trading and the removal of a person's organs without their prior written consent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2007-04/06/content_574120.htm |title=人体器官移植条例 |publisher=www.gov.cn |accessdate=21 May 2010 }}[http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.cn%2Fzwgk%2F2007-04%2F06%2Fcontent_574120.htm&sl=zh-CN&tl=en Google translation].

To further combat transplant tourism, the Health Ministry issued a notice in July 2007 in line with the Istanbul Declaration, giving Chinese citizens priority as organ recipients.<ref name=Lancet/> In October 2007, after several years of discussions with the WHO, the Chinese Medical Association agreed to cease commercial organ collection from condemned prisoners, who would only be able to donate to their immediate relatives.<ref name="CMA"/><ref>Pact to block harvesting of inmate organs, Pg 1, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', 7 October 2007</ref> Other safeguards implemented under the legislation include documentation of consent for organ removal from the donor, and review of all death sentences by the Supreme People’s Court. Transplant professionals are not involved until death is declared. A symposium among legal and medical professionals was held in April 2008 to discuss the diagnostic criteria for brain death for donors of transplant organs.<ref name=Lancet/>

A liver-transplant registry system was established in Shanghai, in 2008, which allows the monitoring of the after-care of liver recipients; at the same time a nationwide proposal was announced that would allow people to note on their driving licence that they wish to donate their organs.<ref name=liver/> Despite these initiatives the ''[[China Daily]]'' newspaper reported in August 2009 that approximately 65% of transplanted organs still came from death row prisoners,<ref name=bbc20090826/> which has been described as "not a proper source for organ transplants" by Vice-Health Minister Huang Jiefu.<ref name="www.chinadaily.com.cn"/> China's first posthumous [[organ donation]] system was jointly launched in March 2010 by the [[Red Cross]] and the Ministry of Health.<ref name=Lancet/>  Huang Jiefu announced that the scheme, which will allow people to express their wishes on their driver’s licences, would be trialled in 10 pilot regions including the cities of [[Tianjin]], [[Wuhan]] and [[Shenzhen]].<ref name="www.chinadaily.com.cn"/> Funds will be made available for the families of people who voluntarily donate their organs. Chinese authorities say they hope the pilot program's success will reduce the need to take organs from death row prisoners and stem the tide of black market organs.<ref name=bbc20090826/>  In 2012 China officials stated they plan to phase out organ harvesting of death-row inmates.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304724404577298661625345898.html China to Stop Harvesting Inmate Organs] 23 March 2012</ref>

In September 2012, the report "Organ Harvesting of Religious and Political Dissidents by the
Chinese Communist Party" presented to the members of a US Congress Subcommittee by Damon Noto, the spokesperson for the organization Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, opined: "Medical doctors outside China have confirmed that their patients have gone to China and received organs from Falun Gong practitioners".<ref name=Damon>Damon Noto, M.D., [http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/HHRG-112-FA17-WState-NotoD-20120912.pdf Organ Harvesting of Religious and Political Dissidents by the  Chinese Communist Party], [[House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], 12 September 2012</ref>

After the congressional hearing on 12 September 2012, Congressmen Robert Andrews and Chris Smith have initiated a bipartisan letter  to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, asking for information that the Department of State might have about the organ harvesting practices in China. They asked their fellow House members to co-sign the letter to Clinton which states that “serious allegations suggest unimaginable abuses have occurred” in the practice of organ transplantation in China. Out of a total House membership of 435, 106 representatives from 33 states signed the letter, as of 3 October when sponsorship closed.On the next day at a rally in Fairfax, Va., President Barack Obama accepted a letter apprizing him of the contents of the House  letter, said Karen Gao, who delivered the letter on behalf of the Falun Dafa Association of Washington, D.C. It asks the president for his support in having the State Department release important documents, which, the association’s letter says, “may be instrumental in helping put an end to the atrocity that has been referred to as ‘a new form of evil on this planet.’” <ref name=epochtimesreport>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/world/us-house-members-want-answers-on-transplantation-abuse-in-china-300526.html</ref>

On 5 November 2012, the organization 'Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvest' stated in a press release in response to the announcement of Dr. Haibo Wang in the Bulletin of the WHO to phase out the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners, that, phasing out a crime against humanity remains a crime until it has completely ended. 'If we applaud the recent announcements by Dr. Haibo Wang, we actually risk to lose our responsibility for all those who are still being killed for their organs', they stated.<ref name= pressrelease>https://dafoh.org/Press_Release_11_05_2012.php</ref>{{dead link|date=January 2013}}

== Organ Transplantation in Other Countries ==

The median waiting time for an organ transplantation in Australia is 6 months to 4 years,<ref name=auswaitingtime>http://www.donatelife.gov.au/discover/facts-a-statistics</ref> in Canada, it is 6 years as of 2011.<ref name=canadawaitingtime>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/transplant-waiting-lists-and-dialysis-costs-grow-as-kidney-supply-lags-behind/article569465/</ref> In UK it is 3 years.<ref name=waittimeuk>http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/statistics/centre-specific_reports/pdf/waiting_time_to_transplant.pdf</ref> The wait times for organ transplants for organ recipients in China appear to be much lower than anywhere else. The China International Transplantation Assistant Centre website says, "It may take only one week to find out the suitable (kidney) donor, the maximum time being one month..." <ref name="kilgourmatasreport"/>
