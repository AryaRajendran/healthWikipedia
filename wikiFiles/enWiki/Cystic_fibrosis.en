'''Cystic fibrosis''' (also known as '''CF''' or '''mucoviscidosis''') is an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] [[genetic disorder]] that affects most critically the [[lungs]], and also the [[pancreas]], [[liver]], and [[intestine]]. It is characterised by abnormal transport of [[chloride]] and [[sodium]] across an [[epithelium]], leading to thick, viscous secretions.<ref name="yankas">{{cite journal |title=Cystic fibrosis adult care consensus conference report |author=Yankaskas JR, Marshall BC, Sufian B, Simon RH, Rodman D. |journal=Chest |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/125/1_suppl/1S.long |year=2004 |volume=125 |pages=1–39|pmid=14734689 |doi=10.1378/chest.125.1_suppl.1S |issue=90010}}</ref>

The name ''cystic fibrosis'' refers to the characteristic [[scar]]ring ([[fibrosis]]) and [[cyst]] formation within the [[pancreas]], first recognized in the 1930s.<ref name="andersen">{{cite journal |author=Andersen DH |title=Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and its relation to celiac disease: a clinical and pathological study |journal=Am J Dis Child |volume=56 |pages=344–399 |year=1938 }}</ref> [[Shortness of breath|Difficulty breathing]] is the most serious symptom and results from frequent [[pneumonia|lung infections]] that are treated with [[antibiotics]] and other medications. Other [[symptom]]s, including [[Sinusitis|sinus infections]], [[failure to thrive|poor growth]], and [[infertility]] affect other parts of the body. 

CF is caused by a [[mutation]] in the [[gene]] for the [[protein]] [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] (CFTR). This protein is required to regulate the components of sweat, [[digestion|digestive]] fluids, and [[mucus]]. CFTR regulates the movement of chloride and sodium ions across epithelial membranes, such as the alveolar epithelia located in the [[lungs]]. Most people without CF have two working copies of the CFTR gene, and both copies must be missing for CF to develop, due to the disorder's recessive nature. CF develops when neither gene works normally (as a result of mutation) and therefore has [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive gene|recessive]] inheritance.

CF is most common among [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]; 4% of people of European descent [[genetic carrier|carries]] one [[allele]] for CF.<ref name=Ratjen03>{{cite journal |author=Ratjen F, Döring G |title=Cystic fibrosis |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9358 |pages=681–9 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12606185 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12567-6 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(03)12567-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Cystic-Fibrosis.htm |title=Patient UK website – Cystic Fibrosis |publisher=Patient.co.uk |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] states that "In the European Union, 1 in 2000–3000 newborns is found to be affected by CF".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html |title=WHO &#124; Genes and human disease |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref> Individuals with cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed before birth by [[genetic testing]], or by a [[sweat test]] in early childhood.

The causes of growth failure are multifactorial and include chronic lung infection, poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and increased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.<ref name="pmid15339250" />

In rare cases, cystic fibrosis can manifest itself as a coagulation disorder. A double recessive allele is needed for cystic fibrosis to be apparent. Young children are especially sensitive to [[vitamin K]] malabsorptive disorders because only a very small amount of vitamin K crosses the placenta, leaving the child with very low reserves. Because factors II, VII, IX, and X (clotting factors) are vitamin K–dependent, low levels of vitamin K can result in coagulation problems. Consequently, when a  child presents with unexplained bruising, a coagulation evaluation may be warranted to determine whether there is an underlying disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reaves J, Wallace G |title=Unexplained bruising: weighing the pros and cons of possible causes |journal=Consultant for Pediatricians |volume=9 |pages=201–2 |year=2010 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/pediatrics/display/article/10162/1583642}}</ref>

In the early stages, incessant coughing, copious [[phlegm]] production, and decreased ability to exercise are common. Many of these symptoms occur when [[bacteria]] that normally inhabit the thick mucus grow out of control and cause pneumonia. 
In later stages, changes in the architecture of the lung, such as pathology in the major airways ([[bronchiectasis]]), further exacerbate difficulties in breathing. Other symptoms include coughing up blood ([[hemoptysis]]), high [[blood pressure]] in the lung ([[pulmonary hypertension]]), [[heart failure]], difficulties getting enough [[oxygen]] to the body ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]), and respiratory failure requiring support with breathing masks, such as [[bilevel positive airway pressure]] machines or [[Mechanical ventilation|ventilators]].<ref name="Rowe" /> ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' are the three most common organisms causing lung infections in CF patients.<ref name=kumar2007/> In addition to typical bacterial infections, people with CF more commonly develop other types of lung disease. Among these is [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]], in which the body's response to the common [[fungus]] ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' causes worsening of breathing problems. Another is infection with ''[[Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium]]'' complex (MAC), a group of bacteria related to [[tuberculosis]], which can cause a lot of lung damage and does not respond to common antibiotics.<ref name="pmid16266669">{{cite journal | author = Girón RM, Domingo D, Buendía B, Antón E, Ruiz-Velasco LM, Ancochea J | title = Nontuberculous mycobacteria in patients with cystic fibrosis | language = Spanish; Castilian | journal = Arch.

Mucus in the [[paranasal sinus]]es is equally thick and may also cause blockage of the sinus passages, leading to infection. This may cause facial pain, fever, nasal drainage, and [[headache]]s.

Cardiorespiratory complications are the most common cause of death (~80%) in patients at most CF centers in the United States.<ref name=kumar2007/>

===Gastrointestinal===
Prior to prenatal and [[newborn screening]], cystic fibrosis was often diagnosed when a newborn infant failed to pass feces ([[meconium]]). Meconium may completely block the [[small intestine|intestines]] and cause serious illness. This condition, called [[meconium ileus]], occurs in 5–10%<ref name=kumar2007/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Eggermont E, De Boeck K |title=Small-intestinal abnormalities in cystic fibrosis patients |journal=Eur.

In addition, protrusion of internal [[rectum|rectal]] membranes ([[rectal prolapse]]) is more common, occurring in as many as 10% of children with CF,<ref name=kumar2007/> and it is caused by increased fecal volume, malnutrition, and [[Valsalva maneuver|increased intra–abdominal pressure]] due to coughing.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM195808282590901 |author=Kulczycki LL, Shwachman H |title=Studies in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas; occurrence of rectal prolapse |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=259 |issue=9 |pages=409–12 |year=1958 |month=August |pmid=13578072 }}</ref>

The thick mucus seen in the lungs has a counterpart in thickened secretions from the [[pancreas]], an organ responsible for providing [[Pancreatic juice|digestive juices]] that help break down food. These secretions block the [[exocrine]] movement of the digestive enzymes into the [[duodenum]] and result in irreversible damage to the pancreas, often with painful inflammation ([[pancreatitis]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohn JA, Friedman KJ, Noone PG, Knowles MR, Silverman LM, Jowell PS |title=Relation between mutations of the cystic fibrosis gene and idiopathic pancreatitis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=339 |issue=10 |pages=653–8 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9725922 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199809033391002|url=}}</ref> The [[pancreatic duct]]s are totally plugged in more advanced cases, usually seen in older children or adolescents.<ref name=kumar2007/> This causes atrophy of the exocrine glands and progressive fibrosis.<ref name=kumar2007/>

The lack of digestive enzymes leads to difficulty absorbing nutrients with their subsequent excretion in the feces, a disorder known as [[malabsorption]]. Malabsorption leads to [[malnutrition]] and poor growth and development because of calorie loss. Resultant [[hypoproteinemia]] may be severe enough to cause generalized edema.<ref name=kumar2007/> Individuals with CF also have difficulties absorbing the fat-soluble vitamins [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin D|D]], [[vitamin E|E]], and [[vitamin K|K]]. 

In addition to the pancreas problems, people with cystic fibrosis experience more [[gastroesophageal reflux disease|heartburn]], intestinal blockage by [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]], and [[constipation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malfroot A, Dab I |title=New insights on gastro-esophageal reflux in cystic fibrosis by longitudinal follow up |journal=Arch.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurs in the majority (85% to 90%) of patients with CF.<ref name=kumar2007/> It is mainly associated with "severe" CFTR mutations, where both alleles are completely nonfunctional (e.g. ΔF508/ΔF508).<ref name=kumar2007/> It occurs in 10% to 15% of patients with one "severe" and one "mild" CFTR mutation where there still is a little CFTR activity, or where there are two "mild" CFTR mutations.<ref name=kumar2007/> In these milder cases, there is still sufficient pancreatic exocrine function so that enzyme supplementation is not required.<ref name=kumar2007/> There are usually no other GI complications in pancreas-sufficient phenotypes, and in general, such individuals usually have excellent growth and development.<ref name=kumar2007/> Despite this, idiopathic [[chronic pancreatitis]] can occur in a subset of pancreas-sufficient individuals with CF, and is associated with recurrent abdominal pain and life-threatening complications.<ref name=kumar2007/>

Thickened secretions also may cause liver problems in patients with CF. [[Bile]] secreted by the liver to aid in digestion may block the [[bile duct]]s, leading to liver damage. Over time, this can lead to scarring and nodularity ([[cirrhosis]]). The liver fails to rid the blood of toxins and does not make important [[protein]]s, such as those responsible for [[coagulation|blood clotting]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams SG, Westaby D, Tanner MS, Mowat AP |title=Liver and biliary problems in cystic fibrosis |journal=Br.

==Cause==
[[File:autorecessive.svg|thumb|Cystic fibrosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance]]
CF is caused by a [[mutation]] in the [[gene]] [[CFTR (gene)|cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] (CFTR). The most common mutation, [[ΔF508]], is a deletion ([[delta (letter)#Mathematics and the Sciences|Δ]] signifying deletion) of three nucleotides<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=19 |title=Profile : Lap-Chee Tsui |publisher=Science.ca |date=1989-05-09 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref> that results in a loss of the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] (F) at the 508th position on the protein. This mutation accounts for two-thirds (66–70%<ref name=kumar2007/>) of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the [[United States]]; however, there are over 1500 other mutations that can produce CF.<ref name="prevalence">{{cite journal |author=Bobadilla JL, Macek M, Fine JP, Farrell PM |title=Cystic fibrosis: a worldwide analysis of CFTR mutations—correlation with incidence data and application to screening |journal=Hum. Mutat. |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=575–606 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12007216 |doi=10.1002/humu.10041 }}</ref> Although most people have two working copies (alleles) of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither allele can produce a functional CFTR protein. Thus, CF is considered an [[Autosomal recessive disorder#Dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans|autosomal recessive disease]].

The [[CFTR (gene)|CFTR gene]], found at the q31.2 [[locus (genetics)|locus]] of [[chromosome 7]], is 230,000 [[base pair]]s long, and creates a protein that is 1,480 [[amino acid]]s long. More specifically the location is between base pair 117,120,016 to 117,308,718 on the long arm of chromosome 7, region 3, band 1, sub-band 2, represented as 7q31.2. Structurally, CFTR is a type of gene known as an [[ATP-binding cassette transporter genes|ABC gene]].<ref name="Rowe" /> The product of this gene (the CFTR) is a chloride ion channel important in creating [[Perspiration|sweat]], [[digestion|digestive]] juices and [[mucus]]. This protein possesses two [[ATP hydrolysis|ATP-hydrolyzing]] [[Structural domain|domains]], which allows the protein to use [[energy]] in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. It also contains two domains comprising 6 [[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] apiece, which allow the protein to cross the cell membrane. A regulatory [[binding site]] on the protein allows activation by [[phosphorylation]], mainly by [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]].<ref name="Rowe" /> The [[C-terminal end|carboxyl terminal]] of the protein is anchored to the [[cytoskeleton]] by a [[PDZ (biology)|PDZ]] domain interaction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Short DB, Trotter KW, Reczek D, ''et al.'' |title=An apical PDZ protein anchors the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to the cytoskeleton |journal=J.

In addition, there is increasing evidence that [[genetic modifier]]s besides CFTR modulate the frequency and severity of the disease. One example is [[mannan-binding lectin]], which is involved in [[innate immunity]] by facilitating [[phagocytosis]] of microorganisms. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] in one or both mannan-binding lectin alleles that result in lower circulating levels of the protein are associated with a threefold higher risk of end-stage lung disease, as well as an increased burden of chronic bacterial infections.<ref name=kumar2007/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:CFTR.jpg|thumb|Molecular structure of the CFTR protein]]

There are several mutations in the ''CFTR'' gene, and different mutations cause different defects in the CFTR protein, sometimes causing a milder or more severe disease. These protein defects are also targets for drugs which can sometimes restore their function. ΔF508-CFTR, which occurs in >90% of patients in the U.S., creates a protein that does not [[Protein folding|fold]] normally and is degraded by the cell. Other mutations result in proteins that are too short (truncated) because [[Translation (genetics)|production]] is ended prematurely. Other mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow [[chloride]], [[iodide]] and [[thiocyanate]] to cross the membrane appropriately,<ref>{{harvnb|Childers|Eckel|Himmel|2007}}</ref> or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced.<ref name="Rowe" />

The protein created by this gene is anchored to the [[cell membrane|outer membrane]] of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in the [[sweat gland]]s, lungs, pancreas, and all other remaining exocrine glands in the body. 
The protein spans this membrane and acts as a [[Ion channel|channel]] connecting the inner part of the cell ([[cytoplasm]]) to the [[extracellular fluid|surrounding fluid]]. This channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of halogens from inside to outside of the cell; however, in the sweat ducts it facilitates the movement of chloride from the sweat into the cytoplasm. When the CFTR protein does not work, chloride and thiocyanate<ref>{{harvnb|Xu|Szép|Lu|2009}}</ref> are trapped inside the cells in the airway and outside in the skin. Then [[hypothiocyanite]], OSCN, cannot be produced by immune defense system.<ref>{{harvnb|Moskwa|Lorentzen|Excoffon|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Conner|Wijkstrom-Frei|Randell|2007}}</ref> Because chloride is [[Electric charge|negatively charged]], this creates a difference in the electrical potential inside and outside the cell causing [[cation]]s to cross into the cell. Sodium is the most common cation in the extracellular space and the combination of sodium and chloride creates the [[sodium chloride|salt]], which is lost in high amounts in the sweat of individuals with CF. This lost salt forms the basis for the sweat test.<ref name="Rowe">{{cite journal |author=Rowe SM, Miller S, Sorscher EJ |title=Cystic fibrosis |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=19 |pages=1992–2001 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15888700 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra043184}}</ref>

Most of the damage in CF is due to blockage of the narrow passages of affected organs with thickened secretions. These blockages lead to remodeling and infection in the lung, damage by accumulated digestive enzymes in the pancreas, blockage of the intestines by thick faeces, etc. There are several theories on how the defects in the protein and cellular function cause the clinical effects. One theory is that the lack of halogen and pseudohalogen (mainly, chloride, iodide and thiocyanate) exiting through the CFTR protein leads to the accumulation of more viscous, nutrient-rich mucus in the lungs that allows bacteria to hide from the body's [[immune system]]. Another theory is that the CFTR protein failure leads to a paradoxical increase in sodium and chloride uptake, which, by leading to increased water reabsorption, creates dehydrated and thick mucus. Yet another theory is that abnormal chloride movement ''out'' of the cell leads to dehydration of mucus, pancreatic secretions, biliary secretions, etc.<ref name="Rowe" />

===Chronic infections===
The lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis are colonized and infected by bacteria from an early age. These bacteria, which often spread among individuals with CF, thrive in the altered mucus, which collects in the small airways of the lungs. This mucus leads to the formation of bacterial microenvironments known as [[biofilm]]s that are difficult for immune cells and antibiotics to penetrate. Viscous secretions and persistent respiratory infections repeatedly damage the lung by gradually remodeling the airways, which makes infection even more difficult to eradicate.<ref name="Saiman">{{cite journal |author=Saiman L |title=Microbiology of early CF lung disease |journal=Paediatric Respiratory Reviews |volume=5 |issue=Suppl A |pages=S367–69 |year=2004 |pmid=14980298 |doi=10.1016/S1526-0542(04)90065-6}}</ref>

Over time, both the types of bacteria and their individual characteristics change in individuals with CF. In the initial stage, common bacteria such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and ''[[Hemophilus influenzae]]'' colonize and infect the lungs.<ref name=kumar2007/> Eventually, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' (and sometimes ''[[Burkholderia cepacia complex|Burkholderia cepacia]]'') dominates. By 18 years of age, 80% of patients with classic CF harbor ''P. aeruginosa'', and 3.5% harbor ''B. cepacia''.<ref name=kumar2007/> Once within the lungs, these bacteria adapt to the environment and develop [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to commonly used antibiotics. ''Pseudomonas'' can develop special characteristics that allow the formation of large colonies, known as "mucoid" ''Pseudomonas'', which are rarely seen in people that do not have CF.<ref name="Saiman" />

One way infection spreads is by passing between different individuals with CF.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tümmler B, Koopmann U, Grothues D, Weissbrodt H, Steinkamp G, von der Hardt H |title=Nosocomial acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by cystic fibrosis patients |journal=J.

CF patients may also have their airways chronically colonized by filamentous fungi (such as ''Aspergillus fumigatus'', ''[[Scedosporium apiospermum]]'', ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]'') and/or yeasts (such as ''[[Candida albicans]]''); other filamentous fungi less commonly isolated include ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' (occur transiently in CF respiratory secretions), and ''[[Exophiala dermatitidis]]'' and ''[[Scedosporium prolificans]]'' (chronic airway-colonizers); some filamentous fungi like ''Penicillium emersonii'' and ''[[Acrophialophora fusispora]]'' are encountered in patients almost exclusively in the context of CF.<ref name="Pihet">{{cite journal |author=Pihet M, Carrere J, Cimon B, Chabasse D, Delhaes L, Symoens F, Bouchara JP |title=Occurrence and relevance of filamentous fungi in respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis—a review |journal=Med Mycol. |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=387–97 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19107638 |doi= 10.1080/13693780802609604|url=}}</ref> Defective mucociliary clearance characterizing CF is associated with local immunological disorders.

==Diagnosis and monitoring==
[[File:CFTR gene on chromosome 7.svg|thumb|The location of the CFTR gene on chromosome 7]]

Cystic fibrosis may be diagnosed by many different methods including [[newborn screening]], [[sweat test]]ing, and [[genetic testing]]. As of 2006 in the United States, 10 percent of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth as part of newborn screening programs. The newborn screen initially measures for raised blood concentration of [[immunoreactive trypsinogen]].<ref name="Davies">{{cite journal |author=Davies JC, Alton EW, Bush A |title=Cystic fibrosis |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7632 |pages=1255–9 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18079549 |pmc=2137053 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39391.713229.AD |url=}}</ref> Infants with an abnormal newborn screen need a sweat test to confirm the CF diagnosis. In many cases, a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty.<ref name=kumar2007/> [[Trypsinogen]] levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the ''CFTR'' gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, in individuals with two normal copies of the ''CFTR'' gene. Due to these [[false positive]]s, CF screening in newborns can be controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ross LF |title=Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis: a lesson in public health disparities |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=308–13 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18718257 |pmc=2569148 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.04.061}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Assael | first=BM | coauthors=Castellani C, Ocampo MB et al. | title=Epidemiology and survival analysis of cystic fibrosis in an area of intense neonatal screening over 30 years | journal=American Journal of Epidemiology | volume=156 | issue=5 | pages=397–401 | month=September | year=2002 | url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/156/5/397 | pmid=12196308 | doi=10.1093/aje/kwf064 | pmc= }}</ref> Most states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms (e.g. sinopulmonary disease and GI manifestations<ref name=kumar2007/>) prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat-testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating ([[pilocarpine]]). To deliver the medication through the skin, [[iontophoresis]] is used to, whereby one [[electrode]] is placed onto the applied medication and an [[electric current]] is passed to a separate electrode on the skin. The resultant sweat is then collected on filter paper or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of [[sodium]] and [[chloride]]. People with CF have increased amounts of sodium and chloride in their sweat. In contrast, people with CF have less thiocyanate and [[hypothiocyanite]] in their saliva<ref>{{harvnb|Minarowski|Sands|Minarowska|2008}}</ref> and mucus (Banfi et al.). CF can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stern RC |title=The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=336 |issue=7 |pages=487–91 |year=1997 |month=February |pmid=9017943 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199702133360707|url=}}</ref>

People with CF may be listed in a [[disease registry]] that allows researchers and doctors to track health results and identify candidates for [[clinical trial]]s.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Freudenheim | first = Milt  | title = Tool in Cystic Fibrosis Fight: A Registry  | newspaper = [[New York Times]]  | pages = D1| date = 2009-12-22  | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22cyst.html?8dpc=&pagewanted=all| accessdate = 2009-12-21}}</ref>

===Prenatal===
Couples who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy can have themselves tested for the CFTR gene mutations to determine the risk that their child will be born with cystic fibrosis. Testing is typically performed first on one or both parents and, if the risk of CF is high, testing on the [[fetus]] is performed. The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) recommends testing for couples who have a personal or close family history of CF, and they recommend that carrier testing be offered to all Caucasian couples and be made available to couples of other ethnic backgrounds.<ref>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American College of Medical Genetics. ''Preconception and prenatal carrier screening for cystic fibrosis. Clinical and laboratory guidelines.'' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Washington, DC, October 2001.</ref>

Because development of CF in the fetus requires each parent to pass on a mutated copy of the CFTR gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often performed initially on one parent. If testing shows that parent is a CFTR gene mutation carrier, the other parent is tested to calculate the risk that their children will have CF. CF can result from more than a thousand different mutations, and as of 2006 it is not possible to test for each one. Testing analyzes the blood for the most common mutations such as ΔF508—most commercially available tests look for 32 or fewer different mutations. If a family has a known uncommon mutation, specific screening for that mutation can be performed. Because not all known mutations are found on current tests, a negative screen does not guarantee that a child will not have CF.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elias S, Annas GJ, Simpson JL |title=Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis: implications for obstetric and gynecologic practice |journal=Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=164 |issue=4 |pages=1077–83 |year=1991 |month=April |pmid=2014829 }}</ref>

During pregnancy, testing can be performed on the [[placenta]] ([[chorionic villus sampling]]) or the fluid around the fetus ([[amniocentesis]]). However, [[chorionic villus sampling]] has a risk of fetal death of 1 in 100 and amniocentesis of 1 in 200;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tabor A, Philip J, Madsen M, Bang J, Obel EB, Nørgaard-Pedersen B |title=Randomised controlled trial of genetic amniocentesis in 4606 low-risk women |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8493 |pages=1287–93 |year=1986 |month=June |pmid=2423826 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(86)91218-3|url=}}</ref> a recent study has indicated this may be much lower, approximately 1 in 1,600.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eddleman KA, Malone FD, Sullivan L, ''et al.'' |title=Pregnancy loss rates after midtrimester amniocentesis |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=108 |issue=5 |pages=1067–72 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17077226 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000240135.13594.07 |url= }}</ref>

Economically, for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis, when comparing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) with natural conception (NC) followed by prenatal testing and abortion of affected pregnancies, PGD provides net economic benefits up to a maternal age of approximately 40 years, after which NC, prenatal testing and abortion has higher economic benefit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis LB, Champion SJ, Fair SO, Baker VL, Garber AM |title=A cost-benefit analysis of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis |journal=Fertil.

==Management==
While there are no cures for cystic fibrosis there are several treatment methods. The management of cystic fibrosis has improved significantly over the past 70 years. While infants born with cystic fibrosis 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood. Recent advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis have meant that an individual with cystic fibrosis can live a fuller life less encumbered by their condition. The cornerstones of management are proactive treatment of [[respiratory tract infection|airway infection]], and encouragement of good nutrition and an active lifestyle.  Management of cystic fibrosis continues throughout a patient's life, and is aimed at maximizing organ function, and therefore quality of life. At best, current treatments delay the decline in organ function. Because of the wide variation in disease symptoms treatment typically occurs at specialist multidisciplinary centers, and is tailored to the individual. Targets for therapy are the [[lungs]], [[gastrointestinal tract]] (including pancreatic enzyme supplements), the [[reproductive organs]] (including [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART)) and psychological support.<ref name="Davies"/>

The most consistent aspect of therapy in cystic fibrosis is limiting and treating the lung damage caused by thick mucus and infection, with the goal of maintaining [[quality of life]]. [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous]], [[inhalation|inhaled]], and oral antibiotics are used to treat chronic and acute infections. Mechanical devices and inhalation medications are used to alter and clear the thickened mucus. These therapies, while effective, can be extremely time-consuming for the patient.  One of the most important battles that CF patients face is finding the time to comply with prescribed treatments while balancing a normal life.

In addition, therapies such as [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] and [[gene therapy]] aim to cure some of the effects of cystic fibrosis. Gene therapy aims to introduce normal CFTR to airway. Theoretically this process should be simple as the airway is easily accessible and there is only a single gene defect to correct. There are two CFTR gene introduction mechanisms involved, the first use of a viral vector (adenovirus, adeno-associated virus or retro virus) and secondly the use of [[liposome]]. However there are some problems associated with these methods involving efficiency (liposomes insufficient protein) and delivery (virus provokes an immune response).

===Antibiotics===
Many CF patients are on one or more [[antibiotics]] at all times, even when healthy, to [[prophylactic]]ally suppress infection. Antibiotics are absolutely necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or there has been a noticeable decline in lung function, and are usually chosen based on the results of a sputum analysis and the patient's past response. This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent [[Heparin lock|IV]] such as a [[peripherally inserted central catheter]] (PICC line) or [[Port-a-Cath]]. Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as tobramycin, [[colistin]], and [[aztreonam]] is often given for months at a time to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pai VB, Nahata MC |title=Efficacy and safety of aerosolized tobramycin in cystic fibrosis |journal=Pediatr.

===Other treatments for lung disease===
Several mechanical techniques are used to dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. In the hospital setting, chest physiotherapy (CPT) is utilized; a respiratory therapist percusses an individual's chest with his or her hands several times a day, to loosen up secretions. Devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the [[ThAIRapy Vest]] and the [[intrapulmonary percussive ventilator]] (IPV). Newer methods such as [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, as well as a vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van der Schans C, Prasad A, Main E |editor1-last=Van Der Schans |editor1-first=Cees P |title=Chest physiotherapy compared to no chest physiotherapy for cystic fibrosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD001401 |year=2000 |pmid=10796781 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001401 |url=}}</ref>

As lung disease worsens, mechanical breathing support may become necessary. Individuals with CF may need to wear special masks at night that help push air into their lungs. These machines, known as [[bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BiPAP) ventilators, help prevent low blood oxygen levels during sleep. BiPAP may also be used during physical therapy to improve sputum clearance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moran F, Bradley JM, Piper AJ |title=Non-invasive ventilation for cystic fibrosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD002769 |year=2009 |pmid=19160211 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub3 |editor1-last=Moran |editor1-first=Fidelma}}</ref> During severe illness, a [[intubation|tube]] may be placed in the throat (a procedure known as a [[tracheostomy]]) to enable breathing supported by a [[ventilator]].

===Transplantation===
[[Lung transplantation]] often becomes necessary for individuals with cystic fibrosis as lung function and [[Exercise intolerance|exercise tolerance]] declines. Although single lung transplantation is possible in other diseases, individuals with CF must have both lungs replaced because the remaining lung might contain bacteria that could infect the transplanted lung. A pancreatic or liver transplant may be performed at the same time in order to alleviate liver disease and/or diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fridell JA, Vianna R, Kwo PY, ''et al.'' |title=Simultaneous liver and pancreas transplantation in patients with cystic fibrosis |journal=Transplant.

===Other aspects===
[[File:Icsi.JPG|thumb|Intracytoplasmic sperm injection can be used to provide fertility for men with cystic fibrosis]]

Newborns with intestinal obstruction typically require surgery, whereas adults with [[distal]] intestinal obstruction syndrome typically do not. Treatment of pancreatic insufficiency by replacement of missing digestive enzymes allows the duodenum to properly absorb nutrients and vitamins that would otherwise be lost in the feces.So far, no large-scale research involving the incidence of [[atherosclerosis]] and [[coronary heart disease]] in adults with cystic fibrosis has been conducted. This is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of people with cystic fibrosis do not live long enough to develop clinically significant atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease.

[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is the most common non-pulmonary complication of CF. It mixes features of [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]] diabetes, and is recognized as a distinct entity, [[cystic fibrosis-related diabetes]] (CFRD).<ref name=Alves>{{cite journal |author=Alves CAD, Aguiar RA, Alves AC, Santana MA |title=Diabetes mellitus in patients with cystic fibrosis |journal=J Bras Pneumol |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=213–21 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17724542 |doi=10.1590/S1806-37132007000200017}}</ref><ref name=Zirbes>{{cite journal |author=Zirbes J, Milla CE |title=Cystic fibrosis related diabetes |journal=Paediatr Respir Rev |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=118–23; quiz 123 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19651382 |doi=10.1016/j.prrv.2009.04.004}}</ref> While oral [[anti-diabetic drug]]s are sometimes used, the only recommended treatment is the use of [[insulin]] injections or an [[insulin pump]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Onady GM, Stolfi A |editor1-last=Onady |editor1-first=Gary M |title=Insulin and oral agents for managing cystic fibrosis-related diabetes |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD004730 |year=2005 |pmid=16034943 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004730.pub2}}</ref> and, unlike in type 1 and 2 diabetes, dietary restrictions are not recommended.<ref name=Alves/>

Sinus infections are treated by prolonged courses of antibiotics. The development of nasal polyps or other chronic changes within the nasal passages may severely limit airflow through the nose, and over time reduce the patient's sense of smell. Sinus surgery is often used to alleviate nasal obstruction and to limit further infections. Nasal steroids such as [[fluticasone]] are used to decrease nasal inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marks SC, Kissner DG |title=Management of sinusitis in adult cystic fibrosis |journal=Am J Rhinol |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=11–4 |year=1997 |pmid=9065342 |doi= 10.2500/105065897781446810|url=}}</ref>

Female infertility may be overcome by [[in vitro fertilisation|assisted reproduction]] technology, particularly [[embryo transfer]] techniques. Male infertility caused by absence of the [[vas deferens]] may be overcome with [[testicular sperm extraction]] (TEST), collecting sperm cells directly from the testicles. If the collected sample contains too few sperm cells to likely have a spontaneous [[fertilization]], [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] can be performed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phillipson GT, Petrucco OM, Matthews CD |title=Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, cystic fibrosis mutation analysis and intracytoplasmic sperm injection |journal=Hum.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for cystic fibrosis has improved due to earlier diagnosis through screening, better treatment and access to health care. In 1959, the median age of survival of children with cystic fibrosis in the United States was six months.<ref name="median">{{cite web|year=2008 | url= http://www.cff.org/aboutcf/faqs/#What_is_the_life_expectancy_for_people_who_have_CF_%28in_the_United_States%29?/ |title=What is the life expectancy for people who have CF (in the United States)? | publisher =[[Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]]| accessdate =2010-03-14}}</ref> In 2008, survival averaged 37.4 years.<ref>{{cite book|first=A.Y. |last=Elzouki |title=Textbook of clinical pediatrics|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-642-02201-2|page=2214|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=FEf4EMjYSrgC&pg=PA2214|edition=2nd|date=2011-10-14 }}</ref> In Canada, median survival increased from 24 years in 1982 to 47.7 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |title=Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Patient Data Registry Report |url=http://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/assets/files/pdf/CPDR_ReportE.pdf |publisher=[[Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]] |accessdate=2010-03-14 |format=PDF}}</ref>

===Quality of life===
Chronic illnesses can be very difficult to manage. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic illness that affects the "digestive and respiratory tracts resulting in generalized malnutrition and chronic respiratory infections".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yu H, Nasr SZ, Deretic V |title=Innate lung defenses and compromised Pseudomonas aeruginosa clearance in the malnourished mouse model of respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis |journal=Infect.

If it is compromised, it affects the quality of life of someone with CF, and their ability to complete such tasks as everyday chores. 
It is important for CF patients to understand the detrimental relationship that chronic illnesses place on the quality of life.  According to Schmitz and Goldbeck (2006), the fact that cystic fibrosis significantly increases emotional stress on both the individual and the family, "and the necessary time-consuming daily treatment routine may have further negative effects on quality of life (QOL)".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmitz TG, Goldbeck L |title=The effect of inpatient rehabilitation programmes on quality of life in patients with cystic fibrosis: a multi-center study |journal=Health Qual Life Outcomes |volume=4 |issue= |pages=8 |year=2006 |pmid=16457728 |pmc=1373610 |doi=10.1186/1477-7525-4-8 |url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/4//8}}</ref> However, Havermans and colleagues (2006) have shown that young outpatients with CF that have participated in the CFQ-R (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised) "rated some QOL domains higher than did their parents".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hegarty M, Macdonald J, Watter P, Wilson C |title=Quality of life in young people with cystic fibrosis: effects of hospitalization, age and gender, and differences in parent/child perceptions |journal=Child Care Health Dev |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=462–8 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=18991968 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2008.00900.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0305-1862&date=2009&volume=35&issue=4&spage=462}}<br/>{{cite journal |author=Havermans T, Vreys M, Proesmans M, De Boeck C |title=Assessment of agreement between parents and children on health-related quality of life in children with cystic fibrosis |journal=Child Care Health Dev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16398786 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00564.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0305-1862&date=2006&volume=32&issue=1&spage=1}}</ref>  Consequently, outpatients with CF have a more positive outlook for themselves. 
Furthermore, there are many ways to improve the QOL in CF patients.  Exercise is promoted to increase lung function. The fact of integrating an exercise regimen into the CF patient’s daily routine can significantly improve the quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moorcroft AJ, Dodd ME, Webb AK |title=Exercise limitations and training for patients with cystic fibrosis |journal=Disabil Rehabil |volume=20 |issue=6–7 |pages=247–53 |year=1998 |pmid=9637933 |doi=10.3109/09638289809166735 }}</ref> There is no definitive cure for Cystic Fibrosis.

Other common autosomal recessive diseases such as [[sickle-cell anemia]] have been found to protect carriers from other diseases, a concept known as [[heterozygote advantage]]. Resistance to the following have all been proposed as possible sources of heterozygote advantage:

* Cholera: With the discovery that [[cholera toxin]] requires normal host CFTR proteins to function properly, it was hypothesized that carriers of mutant CFTR genes benefited from resistance to cholera and other causes of diarrhea.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gabriel SE, Brigman KN, Koller BH, Boucher RC, Stutts MJ |title=Cystic fibrosis heterozygote resistance to cholera toxin in the cystic fibrosis mouse model |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5182 |pages=107–9 |year=1994 |month=October |pmid=7524148 |doi= 10.1126/science.7524148|bibcode = 1994Sci...266..107G }}</ref> Further studies have not confirmed this hypothesis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cuthbert AW, Halstead J, Ratcliff R, Colledge WH, Evans MJ |title=The genetic advantage hypothesis in cystic fibrosis heterozygotes: a murine study |journal=J.

* Typhoid: Normal CFTR proteins are also essential for the entry of [[Salmonella Typhi]] into cells,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pier GB, Grout M, Zaidi T, ''et al.'' |title=Salmonella typhi uses CFTR to enter intestinal epithelial cells |journal=Nature |volume=393 |issue=6680 |pages=79–82 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9590693 |doi=10.1038/30006 |bibcode = 1998Natur.393...79P }}</ref> suggesting that carriers of mutant CFTR genes might be resistant to [[typhoid fever]]. No ''in vivo'' study has yet confirmed this. In both cases, the low level of cystic fibrosis outside of Europe, in places where both cholera and typhoid fever are [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], is not immediately explicable.
* Diarrhea: It has also been hypothesized that the prevalence of CF in Europe might be connected with the development of cattle domestication. In this hypothesis, carriers of a single mutant CFTR chromosome had some protection from diarrhea caused by [[lactose intolerance]], prior to the appearance of the mutations that created lactose tolerance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Modiano G, Ciminelli BM, Pignatti PF |title=Cystic fibrosis and lactase persistence: a possible correlation |journal=Eur.

==History==
[[File:Dorothy Hansine Andersen.jpg|thumb|left|[[National Library of Medicine]] photo of [[Dorothy Hansine Andersen]]. Andersen first described cystic fibrosis in 1938.]]
{{See also|List of people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis}}
It is supposed that CF appeared about 3,000 BC because of migration of peoples, gene mutations, and new conditions in nourishment.<ref name= Bosch/> Although the entire clinical spectrum of CF was not recognized until the 1930s, certain aspects of CF were identified much earlier. Indeed, literature{{specify|date=July 2011}} from Germany and Switzerland in the 18th century warned ''Wehe dem Kind, das beim Kuß auf die Stirn salzig schmekt, er ist verhext und muss bald sterbe'' or "Woe to the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow, for he is cursed and soon must die," recognizing the association between the salt loss in CF and illness.<ref name= Bosch/>

In the 19th century, [[Carl von Rokitansky]] described a case of fetal death with [[meconium peritonitis]], a complication of meconium ileus associated with cystic fibrosis. Meconium ileus was first described in 1905 by [[Karl Landsteiner]].<ref name= Bosch>{{cite journal |author=Busch R |title=On the history of cystic fibrosis |journal=Acta Univ Carol Med (Praha) |volume=36 |issue=1–4 |pages=13–5 |year=1990 |pmid=2130674 }}</ref> In 1936, [[Guido Fanconi]] published a paper describing  a connection between [[celiac disease]], cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, and [[bronchiectasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fanconi | first1 = G. | last2 = Uehlinger | first2 = E. | last3 = Knauer | first3 = C. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1936 | title = Das coeliakiesyndrom bei angeborener zysticher pankreasfibromatose und bronchiektasien | url = | journal = Wien.

She was the first to describe the characteristic cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and to correlate it with the lung and intestinal disease prominent in CF.<ref name="andersen" /> She also first hypothesized that CF was a recessive disease and first used pancreatic enzyme replacement to treat affected children. In 1952 Paul di Sant' Agnese discovered abnormalities in [[sweat]] [[electrolyte]]s; a [[sweat test]] was developed and improved over the next decade.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Di Sant'Agnese PA, Darling RC, Perera GA, Shea E |title=Abnormal electrolyte composition of sweat in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas; clinical significance and relationship to the disease |journal=Pediatrics |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=549–63 |year=1953 |month=November |pmid=13111855 }}</ref>

The first linkage between CF and another marker (Paroxonase) was found in 1985, indicating that only one locus exists for CF [[Hans Eiberg]]. In 1988 the first mutation for CF, [[Delta-F508|ΔF508]] was discovered by [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]], [[Lap-Chee Tsui]] and [[John R. Riordan]] on the seventh chromosome. Subsequent research has found over 1,000 different mutations that cause CF.

Because mutations in the CFTR gene are typically small, [[classical genetics]] techniques had  been unable to accurately pinpoint the mutated gene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Riordan JR, Rommens JM, Kerem B, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: cloning and characterization of complementary DNA |journal=Science |volume=245 |issue=4922 |pages=1066–73 |year=1989 |month=September |pmid=2475911 |doi= 10.1126/science.2475911 |bibcode = 1989Sci...245.1066R }}</ref> Using protein markers, [[gene linkage|gene-linkage]] studies were able to map the mutation to chromosome 7. [[Chromosome walking|Chromosome-walking]] and [[chromosome jumping|-jumping]] techniques were then used to identify and [[DNA sequencing|sequence]] the gene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rommens JM, Iannuzzi MC, Kerem B, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: chromosome walking and jumping |journal=Science |volume=245 |issue=4922 |pages=1059–65 |year=1989 |month=September |pmid=2772657 |doi= 10.1126/science.2772657|url= |bibcode=1989Sci...245.1059R}}</ref> In 1989 Lap-Chee Tsui led a team of researchers at the [[Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto]] that discovered the gene responsible for CF. Cystic fibrosis represents the first genetic disorder elucidated strictly by the process of [[reverse genetics]].

===Gene therapy===
[[Gene therapy]] has been explored as a potential cure for cystic fibrosis. Ideally, gene therapy places a normal copy of the [[CFTR (gene)|CFTR gene]] into affected cells. Transferring the normal CFTR gene into the affected epithelium cells would result in the production of functional CFTR in all target cells, without adverse reactions or an inflammation response. Studies have shown that to prevent the lung manifestations of cystic fibrosis, only 5–10% the normal amount of CFTR [[gene expression]] is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ramalho AS, Beck S, Meyer M, Penque D, Cutting GR, Amaral MD |title=Five percent of normal cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mRNA ameliorates the severity of pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis |journal=Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=619–27 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12397022 }}</ref> Multiple approaches have been tested for gene transfer, such as liposomes and viral vectors in animal models and clinical trials. However, both methods were found to be relatively inefficient treatment options.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tate S, Elborn S |title=Progress towards gene therapy for cystic fibrosis |journal=Expert Opin Drug Deliv |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=269–80 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=16296753 |doi=10.1517/17425247.2.2.269 |url=}}</ref> The main reason is that very few cells take up the vector and express the gene, so the treatment has little effect. Additionally, problems have been noted in cDNA recombination, such that the gene introduced by the treatment is rendered unusable.<ref>{{OMIM|219700|CYSTIC FIBROSIS; CF}}</ref> With the help of the [[Cystic Fibrosis Trust]], which has a league of highly professional gene therapists, both somatic and Adeno-associated viral vector have made advances. The [[Adenovirus|Adenoviridae]], or more commonly known as the cold virus, is genetically altered, allowing the CFTR gene to enter lung cells.

===Small molecules===
A number of [[small molecule]]s that aim at compensating various mutations of the CFTR gene are under development. One approach is to develop drugs that get the ribosome to overcome the [[stop codon]] and synthesize a full-length CFTR protein. About 10% of CF result from a premature stop codon in the DNA, leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins. These drugs target [[nonsense mutation]]s such as G542X, which consists of the amino acid [[glycine]] in position 542 being replaced by a stop codon. Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with DNA synthesis and error-correction. In some cases, they can cause the cell to overcome the stop codon, insert a random amino acid, and express a full-length protein.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dietz, HC |last2=Guttmacher |first2=Alan E. |last3=Dietz |first3=Harry C. |title=New therapeutic approaches to Mendelian disorders |journal=N.

The aminoglycoside [[gentamicin]] has been used to treat lung cells from CF patients in the laboratory to induce the cells to grow full-length proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilschanski M, Yahav Y, Yaacov Y, ''et al.'' |title=Gentamicin-induced correction of CFTR function in patients with cystic fibrosis and CFTR stop mutations |journal=N.
