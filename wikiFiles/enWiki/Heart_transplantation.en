A '''heart transplant''', or a '''cardiac transplant''', is a surgical [[organ transplant|transplant]] procedure performed on patients with end-stage [[heart failure]] or severe [[coronary artery disease]]. As of 2008 the most common procedure was to take a working [[heart]] from a recently deceased [[organ donor]] (cadaveric [[allograft]]) and implant it into the patient. The patient's own heart is either removed ([[heart transplantation#Orthotopic procedure|orthotopic procedure]]) or, less commonly, left in place to support the donor heart ([[heart transplantation#Heterotopic procedure|heterotopic procedure]]); both were controversial solutions to an enduring human ailment. Post-operation survival periods averaged 15 years.<ref name="2007 documentary">{{cite video

[[Norman Shumway]] is widely regarded as the father of heart transplantation although the world's first adult human heart transplant was performed by [[Christiaan Barnard]] in South Africa utilizing the techniques developed and perfected by [[Norman Shumway]]  and [[Richard Lower]]. [[Christiaan Barnard]] performed the world's first adult heart transplant on [[Louis Washkansky]] on December 3, 1967 at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town South Africa.<ref name="Daily_I">{{cite news|date=November 29, 1987 |title=Memories of the Heart |publisher=''Daily Intelligencer'' |location=Doylestown, Pennsylvania |page=A–18}}</ref> [[Adrian Kantrowitz]] performed the first pediatric heart transplant in the world on December 6, 1967 at Maimonides Hospital (now [[Maimonides Medical Center]]) in Brooklyn, New York barely three days after Christiaan Barnard. This was the first heart transplant of any kind in the United States.  [[Norman Shumway]] performed the first adult heart transplant in the United States on January 6, 1968 at the Stanford University Hospital.  

Worldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants were performed annually.  The vast majority of these are performed in the United States (2,000-2,300 annually). About 800,000 people have a [[Class IV heart defect]] indicating a new organ.<ref>{{cite video

The United States has continuously led the world in the annual number of heart transplants performed.  Some of the top heart transplant programs in the United States are Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Columbia University Medical Center and Duke University Medical Center.

Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California is currently ranked number one in the US and the world in the number of heart transplants performed yearly.  Cedars-Sinai heart transplant program has consecutively done the largest volume of heart transplants for three years in a row having performed 95 heart transplants in 2012 and 87 in 2011, the highest for any US Medical Center.

==Contraindications==
Some patients are less suitable for a heart transplant, especially if they suffer from other [[circulatory]] conditions related to the heart. The following conditions in a patient increase the chances of [[complication (medicine)|complications]]:
*[[Kidney]], [[lung]], or [[liver]] disease
*[[Insulin]]-dependent [[diabetes]] with other organ dysfunction
*Life-threatening diseases unrelated to [[heart failure]]
*[[Vascular disease]] of the neck and leg arteries.
*High pulmonary vascular resistance
*Recent [[thromboembolism]]
*Age over 60 years (some variation between centers)
*Substance abuse (which increases the chance of lung disease)

==Procedures==
===Pre-operative===
A typical heart transplantation begins when a suitable donor heart is identified. The heart comes from a recently [[deceased]] or [[Brain death|brain dead]] donor, also called a [[beating heart cadaver]]. The patient is contacted by a [[nurse]] coordinator and instructed to come to the hospital for evaluation and pre-surgical medication. At the same time, the heart is removed from the donor and inspected by a team of surgeons to see if it is in suitable condition. Learning that a potential organ is unsuitable can induce distress in an already fragile patient, who usually requires emotional support before returning home.

The patient must also undergo emotional, psychological, and physical tests to verify mental health and ability to make good use of a new heart. The patient is also given [[immunosuppressant]] medication so that the patient's [[immune system]] does not [[Transplant rejection|reject]] the new heart.

===Operative===
[[Image:Heart transplant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of a transplanted heart with native [[lung]]s and the [[great vessels]].]]
Once the donor heart passes inspection, the patient is taken into the [[operating room]] and given a [[general anaesthetic]]. Either an '''orthotopic''' or a '''heterotopic''' procedure follows, depending on the conditions of the patient and the donor heart.

====Orthotopic procedure====
The '''orthotopic procedure''' begins with a [[median sternotomy]], opening the chest and exposing the [[mediastinum]]. The [[pericardium]] is opened, the [[great vessels]] are [[dissect]]ed and the patient is attached to [[cardiopulmonary bypass]]. The donor's heart is injected with [[potassium chloride]] (KCl). Potassium chloride stops the heart beating before the heart is removed from the donor's body and packed in ice. Ice can usually keep the heart usable four<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pdr/custodiol-htk-solution.html Custodiol Htk Solution patient advice including side effects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to six hours depending on preservation and starting condition. The failing heart is removed by transecting the great vessels and a portion of the [[left atrium]]. The patient's [[pulmonary vein]]s are not transected; rather a circular portion of the left atrium containing the pulmonary veins is left in place. The donor heart is trimmed to fit onto the patient's remaining left atrium and the great vessels are [[surgical suture|suture]]d in place. The new heart is restarted<!--how?-->, the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and the chest cavity is closed.

====Heterotopic procedure====
In the '''heterotopic procedure''', the patient's own heart is not removed. The new heart is positioned so that the chambers and blood vessels of both hearts can be connected to form what is effectively a 'double heart'. The procedure can give the patient's original heart a chance to recover, and if the donor's heart fails (e.g., through [[transplant rejection|rejection]]), it can later be removed, leaving the patient's original heart. Heterotopic procedures are used only in cases where the donor heart is not strong enough to function by itself (because either the patient's body is considerably larger than the donor's, the donor's heart is itself weak, or the patient suffers from [[pulmonary hypertension]]).

===='Living organ' transplant====
In February 2006, at the [[Bad Oeynhausen]] Clinic for [[Thorax]] and Cardiovascular Surgery, [[Germany]], surgeons successfully transplanted a 'beating heart' into a patient.<ref>{{cite news | author= | title=Bad Oeynhausen Clinic for Thorax- and Cardiovascular Surgery Announces First Successful Beating Human Heart Transplant | url=http://www.transmedics.com/wt/page/pr_1140714229 | date=23 February 2006 | publisher=TransMedics | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> Rather than cooling the heart, the living organ procedure keeps it at [[body temperature]] and connects it to a special machine called an [[Organ care system|Organ Care System]] that allows it to continue pumping warm, oxygenated blood. This technique can maintain the heart in a suitable condition for much longer than the traditional method.<!-- how much longer? -->

===Post-operative===
[[File:Пересаженное сердце в грудной клетке реципиента.JPG|thumb|right|Transplanted heart in the thorax of recipient]]
The patient is taken to the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] to recover. When they wake up, they move to a special recovery unit for [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]. The duration of in-hospital, post-transplant care depends on the patient's general health, how well the heart is working, and the patient's ability to look after the new heart. Doctors typically prefer that patients leave the hospital 1 – 2 weeks after surgery, because of the risk of infection and presuming no complications. After release, the patient returns for regular check-ups and rehabilitation. They may also require emotional support. The frequency of hospital visits decreases as the patient adjusts to the transplant. The patient remains on [[immunosuppressant]] medication to avoid the possibility of [[transplant rejection|rejection]]. Since the [[vagus nerve]] is severed during the operation, the new heart beats at around 100 beats per minute unless [[nerve regrowth]] occurs.

Immunosuppressive agents are continued in the intensive care unit.

The patient is regularly monitored to detect rejection. This surveillance can be performed via frequent [[biopsy]] or a gene expression blood test known as [[AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing]]. Typically, biopsy is performed immediately post-transplant and then AlloMap replaces it once the patient is stable. The transition from biopsy to AlloMap can occur as soon as 55 days after the transplant.

==Complications==
Post-operative complications include infection, [[sepsis]], [[Transplant rejection|organ rejection]], as well as the side-effects of the immunosuppressive medication. Since the transplanted heart originates from another organism, the recipient's immune system typically attempts to reject it. The risk of rejection never fully goes away, and the patient will be on [[immunosuppressive drugs]] for the rest of his or her life, but these may cause unwanted side effects, such as increased likelihood of infections, like fevers, unusual pains, or any new feelings. Recipients can get kidney disease from a heart transplant. Many recent advances in reducing complications due to tissue rejection stem from mouse heart transplant procedures.<ref>[http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/?p=999 Bishay, R. The ‘ Mighty Mouse’ Model in Experimental Cardiac Transplantation.<!-- Bot generated title -->] Hypothesis 2011, 9(1): e5.</ref>

In a November 2008 study conducted on behalf of the U.S. federal government by Dr. Eric Weiss of the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], it was discovered that heart transplants — other factors equal — work better in male to male and female to female transplants. However, due to the scarcity of donors, this is not always feasible.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
