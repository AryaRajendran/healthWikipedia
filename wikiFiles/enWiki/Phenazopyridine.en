'''Phenazopyridine''' is a chemical which, when excreted into the [[urine]], has a local [[analgesic]] effect. It is often used to alleviate the [[pain]], [[irritation]], discomfort, or [[Urinary urgency|urgency]] caused by [[urinary tract infections]], [[surgery]], or injury to the [[urinary tract]]. Phenazopyridine was discovered by [[Bernhard Joos]], the founder of [[Cilag]].

==Medical uses==
Phenazopyridine is prescribed for its local analgesic effects on the urinary tract. It is sometimes used in conjunction with an antibiotic or other anti-infective medication at the inception of treatment to help provide immediate symptomatic relief. It is recommended that it be used for no longer than the first two days of antibacterial treatment.<ref name="wcrx.com">http://www.wcrx.com/pdfs/pi/pi_pyridium_plus.pdf</ref>

Phenazopyridine is also prescribed for other cases requiring relief from irritation or discomfort during urination. For example, it is often prescribed after the use of an in-dwelling [[Foley catheter]], endoscopic ([[cystoscopy]]) procedures, or after urethral, prostate, or urinary bladder surgery which may result in irritation of the [[epithelial]] lining of the urinary tract.<ref name="wcrx.com"/>

The American Urological Association has recommended the use of phenazopyridine as a first stage treatment for [[interstitial cystitis]].<ref>http://www.auanet.org/content/guidelines-and-quality-care/clinical-guidelines/main-reports/ic-bps/diagnosis_and_treatment_ic-bps.pdf</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
The drug is administered as a tablet, in either 100&nbsp;mg or 200&nbsp;mg doses of phenazopyridine [[hydrochloride]]. The tablets have a light red, dark red or dark violet color, and are taken with food.

The full [[pharmacokinetic]] properties of phenazopyridine have not been determined. It has mostly been studied in [[animal model]]s, but they may not be very representative of humans.<ref name = jps /> Rat models have shown its half-life to be 7.35 hours,<ref name = bdd /> and that it is excreted 40% hepatically.<ref name = bdd>{{cite journal

Its mode of action is not well known, and only basic information on its interaction with the body is available. It is known that the chemical has a direct topical analgesic effect on the [[mucosa]] lining of the urinary tract. It is rapidly excreted by the kidneys directly into the urine.<ref name = jps>{{cite journal

==Side effects==
[[File:Pyridiumurine.jpg|thumb|The characteristic orange colored urine after taking Pyridium]]
Phenazopyridine frequently causes a distinct color change in the urine, typically to a dark orange to reddish color. This effect is common and harmless, and indeed a key indicator of the presence of the drug in the body. Users of phenazopyridine are warned not to wear contact lenses, as phenazopyridine has been known to permanently discolor contact lenses and fabrics.

Phenazopyridine can also cause [[headache]]s, [[upset stomach]] (especially when not taken with food), or [[dizziness]]. Less frequently it can cause a pigment change in the skin or eyes, to a noticeable yellowish color. This is due to a depressed excretion via the kidneys causing a build up of the drug in the skin, and normally indicates a need to discontinue usage. Other such side effects include [[fever]], [[confusion]], [[shortness of breath]], [[skin]] [[rash]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the face, fingers, feet, or legs. Long-term use may cause yellowing of nails.<ref>{{Cite journal
