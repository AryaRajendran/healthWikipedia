'''Henri Gougerot''' (July 2, 1881 - 1955) was a French [[dermatologist]] born in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine. Gougerot is remembered for his work with numerous dermatological disorders. 

In 1908 he earned his doctorate from the [[University of Paris]], and shortly afterwards was ''professor agrégé'' at the faculty of medicine. In 1928 he was appointed to the chair of dermatology and [[syphilology]], becoming chief physician at the [[Hôpital Saint-Louis]]. For his achievements during World War I, he was awarded the French [[Croix de guerre]].

With [[Charles Lucien de Beurmann]] (1851-1923), he conducted extensive research of fungal diseases that included pioneer studies of [[sporotrichosis]]. In 1925 he described three separate cases of [[atrophy]] of the [[salivary gland]]s associated with dryness of the eyes, mouth and [[vagina]].<ref>[http://dermatology.cdlib.org/121/reviews/sjogren/scheinfeld.html Dermatology Online Journal] Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus are distinct conditions; Noah Scheinfeld MD</ref> Several years later, Swedish [[ophthalmologist]] [[Henrik Sjögren]] (1899-1986) wrote a detailed and comprehensive report of the disease in ''Zur Kenntnis der [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca]]''. Today this autoimmune disease is known as [[Sjögren's syndrome]], however it is sometimes referred to as "Gougerot-Sjögren syndrome".<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2100.html Sjögren's syndrome (Henrik Samuel Conrad Sjögren)] @ [[Who Named It]]</ref>

Gougerot was a prolific writer of over 2500 articles. He was the publisher of ''Archives dermato-syphiligraphiques de la clinique de l’hôpital Saint-Louis'', and with [[Ferdinand-Jean Darier]] (1856-1938) and [[Raymond Sabouraud|Raymond Jacques Adrien Sabouraud]] (1864-1938), was editor of ''Nouvelle Pratique Dermatologique''; an eight-volume work on dermatology.

In 1928 he was appointed president of the ''Société française de prophylaxie sanitaire et morale'', and in 1940 became a member of the ''[[Académie de Médecine]]''.<ref>[http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/sfhd/biographies/gougerot.htm BIUM Univ-Paris] (biography)</ref>
