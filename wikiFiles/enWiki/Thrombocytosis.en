'''Thrombocytosis''' (or '''thrombocythemia''') is the presence of high [[platelet]] counts in the [[blood]], and can be either primary (also termed essential and caused by a [[myeloproliferative disease]]) or reactive (also termed secondary). Although often symptomless (particularly when it is a secondary reaction), it can predispose to [[thrombosis]] in some patients.

In a healthy individual, a normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 and 450,000 per mm³ (or microlitre) (150–450 x 10<sup>9</sup>/[[litre|L]]).<ref name="Kumar&Clark">{{cite book

Nevertheless, counts over 750,000 (and especially over a million) are considered serious enough to warrant investigation and intervention.

==Signs and symptoms==
High platelet levels do not necessarily signal any clinical problems, and are picked up on a routine [[full blood count]]. However, it is important that a full medical history be elicited to ensure that the increased platelet count is not due to a secondary process. Often, it occurs in tandem with an [[inflammation|inflammatory disease]], as the principal stimulants of platelet production (e.g. [[thrombopoietin]]) are elevated in these clinical states as part of the [[acute phase reaction]].

High platelet counts can occur in patients with [[polycythemia vera]] (high [[red blood cell]] counts), and is an additional risk factor for complications.

A very small segment of patients report symptoms of [[erythromelalgia]], a burning sensation and redness of the extremities that resolves with cooling and/or [[aspirin]] use.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

Conversely, [[secondary thrombocytosis]] very rarely causes thrombotic complications.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/959378-overview medscape > Pediatric Thrombocytopenia] By Susumu Inoue.

==Diagnosis==
Laboratory tests might include: [[full blood count]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[renal function]] and [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]].

If the cause for the high platelet count remains unclear, [[bone marrow]] [[biopsy]] is often undertaken, to differentiate whether the high platelet count is '''reactive''' or '''essential'''.

==Causes==
Increase platelet counts can be due to a number of disease processes:
* Essential (primary)
**[[Essential thrombocytosis]] (a form of [[myeloproliferative disease]])
**Other [[myeloproliferative disease|myeloproliferative]] disorders such as [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], [[polycythemia vera]], [[idiopathic myelofibrosis|myelofibrosis]]
* Reactive (secondary)
** Inflammation
** Surgery (which leads to an inflammatory state)
** [[Hyposplenism]] (decreased breakdown due to decreased function of the [[spleen]])
** [[Splenectomy]]
** [[Asplenia]] (absence of normal spleen function)  
** [[Iron deficiency anemia]] or [[hemorrhage]]

Over-medication with drugs that treat [[thrombocytopenia]], such as [[eltrombopag]] or [[romiplostim]], may also result in thrombocytosis.
Other causes include the following
*[[Kawasaki disease]]
*[[Soft tissue sarcoma]]
*[[Osteosarcoma]]
*[[Dermatitis]] (rarely)
*[[Inflammatory bowel disease]]
*[[Rheumatoid arthritis]]
*[[Nephritis]]
*[[Nephrotic syndrome]]
*[[Bacterial diseases]], including [[pneumonia]], [[sepsis]], [[meningitis]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, and septic arthritis.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/959378-overview</ref>

The vast majority of causes of thrombocytosis are [[acquired disorder]]s, but in a few cases, they may be [[congenital disorder|congenital]], such as thrombocytosis due to [[congenital asplenia]].<ref>{{cite pmid|11064471}} [http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/content/abstract/85/11/1211]</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}
Often, no treatment is required or necessary for reactive thrombocytosis. In cases of reactive thrombocytosis of more than 1,000x10<sup>9</sup>/L, it may be considered to administer daily [[low dose aspirin]] (such as 65 mg) to minimize the risk of stroke or thrombosis.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/206811-treatment Thrombocytosis, Secondary Treatment & Management] from Medscape. Author: Koyamangalath Krishnan, MD, FRCP, FACP; Chief Editor: Emmanuel C Besa, MD. Updated: Oct 4, 2009</ref>

However, in primary thrombocytosis, if platelet counts are over 750,000 or 1,000,000, and especially if there are other risk factors for thrombosis, treatment may be needed. Selective use of [[aspirin]] at low doses is thought to be protective.  Extremely high platelet counts in primary thrombocytosis can be treated with [[hydroxyurea]] (a cytoreducing agent) or [[anagrelide]] (Agrylin).<ref name="Harrison">{{cite journal
