* NHS services must reflect the needs and preferences of patients, their families and their carers.
* The NHS works across organisational boundaries and in partnership with other organisations in the interest of patients, local communities and the wider population. The NHS is an integrated system of organisations and services bound together by the principles and values reflected in the Constitution.

The NHS grants patients '''rights''' which are intended to be legally enforceable and also  makes other non-binding '''pledges'''. These are in the areas of access; quality of care and encvironment; access to treatments, medicines and screening programmes; Respect, consent and confidentiality; informed choice; patient involvement in healthcare and public involvemenst in the NHS; and complaints and redress.

==Access to Health Care==
The constitution defines '''RIGHTS''' regarding '''access to health care''' which will be
*free of charge
*non-discriminatory
*never refused on unreasonable grounds
*obtainable from any UK NHS provider or with pre-approval from any [[European Economic Area|EEA]] or Swiss public provider
*assessed by the local NHS to meet locally assessed needs

The NHS also make pledges that access to health care will be convenient and easy to access within defined waiting times; based on decision making that will be clear and transparent, and that transfers from one provider to another will be as smooth as possible and that patients will be involved in all relevant discussions.

==Quality of Care and Environment==
The constitution defines '''RIGHTS''' regarding '''quality of care and environment''' as follows

add pledges that services will be provided in a clean and safe environment that is fit for purpose, based on national best practice and that there will be a continuous improvement in the quality of services, identifying and sharing best practice.

==Approved treatments, drugs and programmes==
The constitution defines '''rights''' regarding '''approved treatments, drugs and programmes'''. Patients have the right to

*drugs and treatments that have been recommended by [[NICE]] for use in the NHS, if their doctor says they are clinically appropriate for them.
*expect local decisions on funding of other drugs and treatments <ref>In practice, the vast majority of drugs and treatments are available through the NHS but have NOT been explicitly approved by NICE or local NHS management but usage is simply accepted medical practice. This statement makes it clear that NICE decisions rule nationally and overrides local NHS management and in the absence of other guidance from local NHS management then responsibility lies with the doctor and patient together.  NICE was originally established to guide national policy where there were significant differences of opinion between the different local NHS organizations over certain drugs and treatments – the so called [[postcode lottery]], but local managements have generally had powers over budgets and coverage in their local area.</ref> to be made rationally following a proper consideration of the evidence. If the local NHS decides not to fund a drug or treatment that you{{Who|date=February 2010}} and your doctor feel would be right for you, the local NHS must explain that decision.
