'''Gut flora''' consists of a complex of [[microorganism]] species that live in the [[digestive tracts]] of animals and is the largest reservoir of [[human flora]]. In this context ''gut'' is synonymous with ''intestinal'', and ''flora'' with ''microbiota'' and ''microflora''; the word ''[[microbiome]]'' is also in use. Gut flora's primary benefit to the host is the gleaning of energy from the [[fermentation]] of undigested [[carbohydrate]]s and the subsequent absorption of [[short chain fatty acids]]. The most important of these are [[butyrates]], metabolised by the colonic [[epithelium]]; [[propionates]] by the liver; and [[acetates]] by the muscle tissue. Intestinal [[bacteria]] also play a role in synthesizing vitamins B and K and metabolising [[bile acids]], [[sterols]] and [[xenobiotics]]. <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0261-5614(97)80252-X |title=Role of intestinal bacteria in nutrient metabolism |year=1997 |last1=Cummings |first1=J.H. |last2=MacFarlane |first2=G.T. |journal=Clinical Nutrition |volume=16 |pages=3–9 |pmid=16844615}}</ref>

Three human enterotypes have been discovered.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|title=Bacteria Divide People Into 3 Types, Scientists Say|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/science/21gut.html|accessdate=April 21, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 20, 2011|quote=a group of scientists now report just three distinct ecosystems in the guts of people they have studied.}}</ref><ref name=Nature>{{cite journal |last=Arumugam |first=Manimozhiyan |coauthors=et al |title=Enterotypes of the human gut microbiome |journal=Nature |year=2010 |month=March |doi=10.1038/nature09944 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature09944.html |quote=Our knowledge of species and functional composition of the human gut microbiome is rapidly increasing, but it is still based on very few cohorts and little is known about variation across the world.

==Predicting a human gut microbiota==
With a series of experiments using [[gnotobiotic animal|gnotobiotic]] mice, Faith ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Faith |first=J. J. |coauthors=McNulty, N. P.; Rey, F. E.; Gordon, J. I. |title=Predicting a Human Gut Microbiota's Response to Diet in Gnotobiotic Mice |journal=Science |date=19 May 2011 |volume=333 |issue=6038 |pages=101–4 |doi=10.1126/science.1206025}}</ref> demonstrated that it is possible to predict changes in the human gut microbiota. They reproduced a model human gut community of ten sequenced human gut bacteria in mice and followed changes in community composition in response to changes in host diet.

Using several diets with different concentrations of four ingredients, [[casein]], corn oil, cornstarch, and sucrose, it is possible to feed a linear model to predict the abundance of each species as a function of diet. This model is able to predict 61% of population variation. Total community abundance (biomass) and the abundance of each community member can best be explained by changes in casein consumption. Seven of these species are positively correlated with the concentration of casein and the other three species are negatively correlated with casein concentration.

The scientists also studied some diets consisting of random combinations of human pureed baby food and administered these diets to the mice. In this way, the diets were closer to real human diets. Again, the linear model could predict the 60% of the variation in species abundance knowing the concentrations of the components of the diets.

==Gut flora and diet==
Studies and statistical analyses have identified the different bacterial genera in gut microbiota and their association with nutrient intake.  Gut microflora is mainly composed by three enterotypes: ''[[Prevotella]]'', ''[[Bacteroides]]'' and ''[[Ruminococcus]]''. There is an association between the concentration of each microbial community and dietary components.  For example, ''Prevotella'' is related with carbohydrates and simple sugars, indicating an association with a carbohydrate-based diet more typical of agrarian societies, while ''Bacteroides'' enterotypes is associated with animal proteins, aminoacids and saturated fats, components typical of a Western diet.  That means that one enterotype will dominate over the other depending on the diet - those who eat plenty of protein and animal fats have predominantly ''Bacteroides'' bacteria, while for those who consume more carbohydrates the ''Prevotella'' species dominate.<ref name="science2011"/>

Gut microbiome however can also be changed by following a long-term diet. People whose microbiome is predominantly Bacteroides (diet based on high levels of protein and fat) and change their dietary patterns to a diet based on high levels of carbohydrates, will get a Prevotella enterotype in the long-term.  This relation may be interesting in medical field as the long term dietary interventions may allow modulation of an individual's enterotype to improve health.<ref name="science2011">{{cite journal|author=Wu, G.D., ''et al''.|year=2011|title=Linking Long-Term Dietary Patterns with Gut Microbial Enterotypes|journal=Science|volume=334|issue=6052 |pages=105–108  |pmc=3368382 |pmid=21885731|bibcode=2011Sci...334..105W|last2=Chen|last3=Hoffmann|last4=Bittinger|last5=Chen|last6=Keilbaugh|last7=Bewtra|last8=Knights|last9=Walters|doi=10.1126/science.1208344 }}</ref>

==Functions==

===Carbohydrate fermentation and absorption===
Without gut flora, the human body would be unable to utilize some of the undigested [[carbohydrate]]s it consumes, because some types of gut flora have [[enzyme]]s that human cells lack for breaking down certain [[polysaccharide]]s.<ref name=Sears/> Rodents raised in a sterile environment and lacking in gut flora need to eat 30% more [[calorie (food)|calories]] just to remain the same weight as their normal counterparts.<ref name=Sears/> Carbohydrates that humans cannot [[digestion|digest]] without bacterial help include certain [[starch (food)|starches]], [[fiber (food)|fiber]], [[oligosaccharides]] and [[sugar]]s that the body failed to digest and absorb<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/><ref name=gibson/><ref name="Beaugerie L and Petit JC"/> like [[lactose]] in the case of [[lactose intolerance]] and sugar [[alcohol]]s, [[mucus]] produced by the gut, and proteins.<ref name=gibson/>  A further result is [[flatulence]], specifically due to the metabolism of [[oligosaccharide]]s (notably from [[bean]]s) by many different species.

Bacteria turn carbohydrates they ferment into [[short chain fatty acid]]s (SCFAs)<ref name="University of Glasgow"/><ref name=gibson/><ref name="Beaugerie L and Petit JC"/> by a form of fermentation called [[saccharolytic fermentation]].<ref name=gibson/> Products include [[acetic acid]], [[propionic acid]] and [[butyric acid]].<ref name="University of Glasgow"/><ref name=gibson/><ref name="Beaugerie L and Petit JC"/> These materials can be used by host cells, providing a major source of useful energy and nutrients for humans,<ref name=gibson/> as well as helping the body to absorb essential [[dietary minerals]] such as [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[iron]].<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/> Gases and [[organic acid]]s, such as [[lactic acid]], are also produced by saccharolytic fermentation.<ref name="Beaugerie L and Petit JC"/>  Acetic acid is used by [[muscle]], propionic acid helps the [[liver]] produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and butyric acid provides energy to gut cells and may prevent [[cancer]].<ref name=gibson/>  Evidence also indicates that bacteria enhance the absorption and storage of [[lipids]]<ref name=Sears/> and produce and then facilitate the body to absorb needed vitamins like [[vitamin K]].

Another, less favorable type of fermentation, [[proteolytic fermentation]], breaks down proteins like enzymes, dead host and bacterial cells, and [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] found in food, and can produce toxins and [[carcinogen]]s in addition to SCFAs. Thus, a diet lower in protein reduces exposure to toxins.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/><ref name="University of Glasgow"/> 

Beneficial flora increase the gut's absorption of water, reduce counts of damaging bacteria, increase growth of human gut cells,<ref name="University of Glasgow"/> and stimulate growth of indigenous bacteria.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/>

===Trophic effects===
Another benefit of SCFAs is that they increase growth of intestinal [[epithelial cells]] and control their proliferation and differentiation.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/> They may also cause [[lymphoid tissue]] near the gut to grow.  Bacterial cells also alter intestinal growth by changing the expression of [[cell surface protein]]s such as [[sodium/glucose transporter]]s.<ref name=Sears/> In addition, changes they make to cells may prevent injury to the gut [[mucosa]] from occurring.<ref name=Keeley/>

===Repression of pathogenic microbial growth===
[[Image:Clostridium difficile 01.png|thumb|right|240px|''C. difficile'' colonies on a blood [[agar plate]].  The overgrowth of ''C. difficile'' in the gut can be harmful to the host.]]
Another important role of helpful gut flora is that they prevent species that would harm the host from colonizing the gut through [[competitive exclusion]], an activity termed the "barrier effect".  Harmful [[yeast]]s and bacterial species such as ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' (the overgrowth of which can cause [[pseudomembranous colitis]]) are unable to grow excessively due to competition from helpful gut flora species adhering to the mucosal lining of the intestine, thus animals without gut flora are [[infection|infected]] very easily.  The barrier effect protects humans from both invading species and species normally present in the gut at low numbers, whose growth is usually inhibited by the gut flora.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/>

Helpful bacteria prevent the growth of pathogenic species by competing for nutrition and [[bacterial attachment|attachment]] sites to the [[epithelium]] of the colon.  Symbiotic bacteria are more at home in this ecological niche and are thus more successful in the competition.  Indigenous gut floras also produce [[bacteriocins]], which are proteinaceous toxins that inhibit growth of similar bacterial strains, substances that kill harmful microbes and the levels of which can be regulated by enzymes produced by the host.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/>

The process of fermentation, since it produces lactic acid and different [[fatty acid]]s, also serves to lower the pH in the colon, preventing the proliferation of harmful species of bacteria and facilitating that of helpful species.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The pH may also enhance the excretion of carcinogens.<ref name=gibson/>

===Immunity===
Gut flora have a continuous and dynamic effect on the host's gut and systemic immune systems. The bacteria are key in promoting the early development of the gut's mucosal immune system both in terms of its physical components and function and continue to play a role later in life in its operation.  The bacteria stimulate the lymphoid tissue associated with the gut mucosa to produce antibodies to pathogens.  The immune system recognizes and fights harmful bacteria, but leaves the helpful species alone, a tolerance developed in infancy.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/><ref name=Steinhoff/><ref name="University of Glasgow"/><ref name=Shanahan/>

As soon as an infant is born, bacteria begin colonizing its digestive tract. The first bacteria to settle in are able to affect the [[immune response]], making it more favorable to their own survival and less so to competing species; thus the first bacteria to colonize the gut are important in determining the person's lifelong gut flora makeup.  However, there is a shift at the time of [[weaning]] from predominantly [[facultative anaerobic]] species, such as ''[[Streptococci]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', to mostly [[obligate anaerobic]] species.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/><ref name=Sears/>

Recent findings have shown that gut bacteria play a role in the expression of [[toll-like receptors]] (TLRs) in the intestines, molecules that help the host repair damage due to injury. TLRs cause parts of the immune system to repair injury caused, for example, by [[radiation]].<ref name=Sears/><ref name=Keeley/> TLRs are one of the two classes of [[pattern recognition receptors|pattern-recognition receptors]] (PRR) that provide the intestine the ability to discriminate between the pathogenic and commensal bacteria. These PRRs identify the pathogens that have crossed the mucosal barriers and trigger a set of responses that take action against the pathogen, which involve three main immunosensory cells: surface enterocytes, M cells and dendritic cells.<ref name=OHara06>{{cite journal |author=O'Hara AM, Shanahan F |title=The gut flora as a forgotten organ |journal=EMBO Rep. |volume=7 |issue=  7|pages=688–93 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16819463 |pmc=1500832 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400731 }}</ref>

The other class of PRRs are known as the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain/caspase recruitment domain isoforms (NOD/CARD), which are cytoplasmic proteins that recognize endogenous or microbial molecules or stress responses and forms oligomers that activate inflammatory caspases. This would result in the cleavage and activation of important inflammatory cytokines and/or activate [[NF-κB]] signaling pathway to induce the production of inflammatory molecules.<ref name=OHara06/>

Bacteria can influence the phenomenon known as [[oral tolerance]], in which the immune system is less sensitive to an [[antigen]] (including those produced by gut bacteria) once it has been ingested.  This tolerance, mediated in part by the gastrointestinal immune system and in part by the liver, can reduce an overreactive immune response like those found in [[allergy|allergies]] and [[auto-immune disease]].<ref name=Jewell>{{cite journal |author=Jewell AP |title=Is the liver an important site for the development of immune tolerance to tumours? |journal=Med. Hypotheses |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=751–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15694692 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.10.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-9877(04)00561-4}}</ref>

Some species of gut flora, such as some of those in the ''Bacteroides'' genus, are able to change their surface receptors to mimic those of host cells in order to evade immune response.  Bacteria with neutral and harmful effects on the host can also use these types of strategies.  The host immune system has also adapted to this activity, preventing overgrowth of harmful species.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/><ref name=Steinhoff/>

===Metabolic function===

The resident gut microflora positively control the intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation through the production of short-chain fatty acids. They also mediate other metabolic effects such as the syntheses of vitamins like biotin and folate, as well as absorption of ions including magnesium, calcium and iron.<ref name=OHara06/>

The gut flora play a major role in metabolizing dietary carcinogens,<ref name=OHara06/> the microcomponents and the macrocomponents. The microcomponents are genotoxic, and the major focus is on recent advances in heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which are produced by cooking at high temperatures proteinaceous food, such as meat and fish, which can then induce tumors in organs like the breast, colon and prostate. HCAs are naturally occurring; therefore, the complete avoidance of them is impractical, which is why the metabolic function of gut flora of such components is of great importance to the human, as this would help in prevention of such tumors that are difficult to avoid. The macrocomponents consists of the excessive intake of fat and sodium chloride, which can later promote tumors, such as in breasts and colons, from fat and gastric carcinogenesis from sodium chloride.<ref name=Sugimura>{{cite journal |author=Sugimura T |title=Nutrition and dietary carcinogens |journal=Carcinogenesis |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=387–95 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10688859 |url=http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10688859 |doi=10.1093/carcin/21.3.387}}</ref>

=== Preventing allergy ===
Bacteria are also implicated in preventing [[allergy|allergies]],<ref name="Björkstén"/> an overreaction of the immune system to non-harmful [[antigen]]s. Studies on the gut flora of infants and young children have shown that those who have or later develop allergies have different compositions of gut flora from those without allergies, with higher chances of having the harmful species ''[[clostridium difficile|C. difficile]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'' and lower prevalence of ''Bacteroides'' and ''Bifidobacteria''.<ref name="Björkstén"/> One explanation is that since helpful gut flora stimulate the immune system and "train" it to respond properly to antigens, a lack of these bacteria in early life leads to an inadequately trained immune system that overreacts to antigens.<ref name="Björkstén"/>  On the other hand, the differences in flora could be a result, not a cause, of the allergies.<ref name="Björkstén"/>

=== Preventing inflammatory bowel disease ===
Another indicator that bacteria help train the immune system is the [[epidemiology]] of [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]], or IBD, such as [[Crohn's Disease]] (CD).  Some authors suggest that SCFAs prevent IBD.  In addition, some forms of bacteria can prevent [[inflammation]].<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada, 2003a">{{cite journal |author=Guarner F, Malagelada JR |title=Role of bacteria in experimental colitis |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=793–804 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14507589 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1521691803000684 |doi=10.1016/S1521-6918(03)00068-4}}</ref>  The incidence and prevalence of IBD is high in [[industrialized countries]] with a high [[standard of living]] and low in [[less economically developed country|less economically developed countries]], having increased in developed countries throughout the twentieth century.  The disease is also linked to good hygiene in youth; lack of breastfeeding; and consumption of large amounts of sucrose and animal fat.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada, 2003a"/>  Its incidence is inversely linked with poor sanitation during the first years of life and consumption of fruits, vegetables, and unprocessed foods.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada, 2003a"/>  Also, the use of antibiotics, which kill native gut flora and harmful infectious pathogens alike, especially during childhood, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease.<ref name=Wynne/>  On the other hand, using high concentrations of [[probiotic]]s called "Amanlac" probiotics, helps to effectively maintain intestinal homeostasis, while also treating intestinal inflammation in IBD.<ref>Hahm Ki Baik, et al.

==Alterations in flora balance==

===Effects of antibiotic use===
Altering the numbers of gut bacteria, for example by taking [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s, may affect the host's health and ability to digest food.<ref name=Carman>{{cite journal |author=Carman RJ, Simon MA, Fernández H, Miller MA, Bartholomew MJ |title=Ciprofloxacin at low levels disrupts colonization resistance of human fecal microflora growing in chemostats |journal=Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=319–26 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15546686 |doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2004.08.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0273-2300(04)00124-2}}</ref>  People may take the drugs to cure bacterial illnesses or may unintentionally consume significant amounts of [[antibiotic]]s by eating the meat of animals to which they were fed.<ref name=Carman/>  Antibiotics can cause [[antibiotic-associated diarrhea]] (AAD) by irritating the [[bowel]] directly, changing the levels of gut flora, or allowing [[pathogen]]ic bacteria to grow.<ref name="Beaugerie L and Petit JC"/>  Another harmful effect of antibiotics is the increase in numbers of [[antibiotic-resistant bacteria]] found after their use, which, when they invade the host, cause illnesses that are difficult to treat with antibiotics.<ref name=Carman/>

Changing the numbers and species of gut flora can reduce the body's ability to ferment carbohydrates and metabolize [[bile]] acids and may cause diarrhea. Carbohydrates that are not broken down may absorb too much water and cause runny stools, or lack of SCFAs produced by gut flora could cause the diarrhea.<ref name="Beaugerie L and Petit JC"/>

A reduction in levels of native bacterial species also disrupts their ability to inhibit the growth of harmful species such as ''[[C. difficile]]'' and ''[[Salmonella kedougou]]'', and these species can get out of hand, though their overgrowth may be incidental and not be the true cause of diarrhea.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/><ref name="Beaugerie L and Petit JC"/><ref name=Carman/> Emerging treatment protocols for C. difficile infections involve fecal microbiota transplantation of donor feces. Initial reports of treatment describe success rates of 90%, with few side effects. Efficacy is speculated to result from restoring bacterial balances of bacteroides and firmicutes classes of bacteria.<ref name=Brandt>{{cite journal |author=Brandt Lawrence J. MD |title=Endoscopic Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: "First-Line" Treatment for Severe Clostridium difficile Infection? |journal=Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology |volume=45 |issue=8 |pages=655–7 |year=2011 |month=September |pmid= 21716124|url=http://journals.lww.com/jcge/Fulltext/2011/09000/Endoscopic_Fecal_Microbiota_Transplantation_.2.aspx |doi=10.1097/MCG.0b013e3182257d4f}}</ref>

Gut flora composition also changes in severe illnesses, due not only to antibiotic use but also to such factors as [[ischemia]] of the gut, failure to eat, and [[immune compromise]].  Negative effects from this have led to interest in [[selective digestive tract decontamination]] (SDD), a treatment to kill only pathogenic bacteria and allow the re-establishment of healthy ones.<ref name=Knight>{{cite journal |author=Knight DJ, Girling KJ |title=Gut flora in health and disease |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9371 |pages=1831 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12781578 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673603134381 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13438-1}}</ref>

===Pharmabiotics===
Pharmabiotics is a generic term to encompass any form of therapeutic exploitation of the commensal flora, including the use of live probiotic bacteria, probiotic-derived biologically active metabolites, [[prebiotics]], [[synbiotics]] or genetically modified commensal bacteria.<ref name=OHara06/> Since the lack of gut flora can have such harmful health effects, the use of [[probiotics]] has anti-[[inflammation|inflammatory]] effects in the gut and may be useful for improving health.  [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|Prebiotics]] are dietary components that can help foster the growth of micro-organisms in the gut, which may lead to better health.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada, 2003a"/> There is evidence supporting a therapeutic role for probiotic strategies for treating mucosal inflammatory disorders such as IBD, atopy, infection, diarrhoea, cancer and arthritis.<ref name=OHara06/>

===Pregnancy===
Women's gut microbiota change as pregnancy advances, with the changes similar to those seen in metabolic syndromes such as diabetes. The change in gut flora causes no ill effects. The newborn's gut biota resemble the mother's first-trimester samples. The diversity of the flora reduces from the first to third trimester, but the numbers of certain species go up.<ref>{{cite news | work = Nature News | title = Pregnancy alters resident gut microbes | author = Monya Baker | doi = 10.1038/nature.2012.11118 | date = August 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Weight loss===
Weight loss initiates a shift in the bacteria phyla that compose gut flora. Specifically, ''Bacteroidetes'' increase nearly linearly as weight loss progresses. <ref>{{Cite journal | title = Human gut microbes associated with obesity | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/abs/4441022a.html | year = 2006 | journal = Nature  | volume = 441 | pages = 21–28 | author = RE Ley; ''et al'' | postscript = <!--None--> | issue = 7122}}</ref>  While there is a high level of variation in bacteria species found among individual people, this trend is prominent and distinct in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Assessment of microbial diversity in human colonic samples by 16S rDNA sequence analysis | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168649601001908 | year = 2002 | journal = FEMS Microbiol Ecol  | volume = 39 | pages = 33–39 | author = GL Hold; ''et al'' | postscript = <!--None--> | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2002.tb00904.x | pmid = 19709182 | issue = 1}}</ref>

==Role in disease==
Bacteria in the digestive tract have pathogenic properties in addition to their health-inducing ones: they can produce [[toxin]]s and [[carcinogen]]s<ref name="University of Glasgow"/> and have been implicated in such conditions as [[multisystem organ failure]], [[sepsis]], [[colon cancer]], and [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD).<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/> A major factor in health is the balance of bacterial numbers; if the numbers grow too high or low, it will result in harm to the host. The host has [[enzyme]]s to regulate this balance.<ref name="University of Glasgow"/>

===Cancer===
Some [[genus|genera]] of bacteria, such as ''Bacteroides'' and ''Clostridium'', have been associated with an increase in [[tumor]] growth rate, while other genera, such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' and ''[[Bifidobacteria]]'', are known to prevent tumor formation.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/>

===Translocation===
Helpful bacteria can be very harmful to the host if they get outside of the intestinal tract.<ref name=Sears/><ref name="University of Glasgow"/><ref name=Vedantam/> [[Translocation]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2012}}, which occurs when bacteria leave the gut through its [[mucosa]]l lining, the border between the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the gut and the inside of the body,<ref name=Steinhoff/><ref name=Suenaert>{{cite journal |author=Suenaert P, Bulteel V, Lemmens L, ''et al.'' |title=Anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment restores the gut barrier in Crohn's disease |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=97 |issue=8 |pages=2000–4 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12190167 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2002.05914.x}}</ref> can occur in a number of different diseases.<ref name=Vedantam/><ref name="Guarner and Malagelada, 2003a"/> It can be caused by too much growth of bacteria in the small intestine, reduced immunity of the host, or increased gut lining permeability.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada, 2003a"/>  The gut can become more permeable in diseases like [[cirrhosis]], which is damaging due in part to the activity of gut flora.<ref name="Garcia-Tsao">{{cite journal |author=Garcia-Tsao G, Wiest R |title=Gut microflora in the pathogenesis of the complications of cirrhosis |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=353–72 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15123075 |doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2003.10.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1521691803001306}}</ref>

If the gut is perforated, bacteria can invade the body, causing a potentially fatal infection.  Aerobic bacteria can make an infection worse by using up all available oxygen and creating an environment favorable to anaerobes.<ref name=Vedantam/>

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
Some suspect that IBD is due to a reduction in immune tolerance and subsequent overreaction of the host's immune system to harmful or non-harmful bacteria.  IBD may be caused by the entire gut flora together or some specific types.<ref name=Wynne/><ref name=Hugot>{{cite journal |author=Hugot JP |title=Inflammatory bowel disease: a complex group of genetic disorders |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=451–62 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15157820 |doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2004.01.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1521691804000095}}</ref>

It has been noted that though [[Ulcerative Colitis]] and [[Crohn's disease]] (two types of IBD) probably have [[Genetics|genetic]] components, they are not inherited in a [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] fashion and are thus probably due to a complex set of factors rather than solely to a [[gene]].<ref name=Hugot/> Though neither bacterial colonization nor [[genetics]] is sufficient to cause the disease, bacteria probably play a role in these disorders.<ref name=Hugot/>

Some suspect that inflammation in IBD is due to increased permeability of the inner lining of the colon, which may allow bacteria to invade the tissues and cause an immune reaction that leads to prolonged inflammation.<ref name=Steinhoff/><ref name=Suenaert/> Tissue damage in IBD results from the immunological misperception of danger within the naturally occurring flora or due to failure of normal tolerance to pathogenic bacteria. It is still unclear whether the inflammation that occurs is due to a specific subset of intestinal microbes or due to a problem with the tolerance of commensal gut flora.<ref name=OHara06/> Abnormal [[tight junction]]s, which are supposed to prevent permeability, have been found in cells of patients with IBD.<ref name=Suenaert/>  Because of the potentially harmful role of these bacteria, antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat Crohn's disease.<ref name=Keeley/> However, inflammation could occur first and cause the increased intestinal permeability found in diseases such as Crohn's, so the causative role of bacteria is not clear.<ref name=Suenaert/> Conventional therapies for IBD primarily target the mucosal inflammatory responses by using pharmabiotics.<ref name=OHara06/>

===Colitis===
It has been suggested that commensal bacteria are responsible for the development of [[colitis]], since mice raised in a [[aseptic|sterile]] environment do not get the disease.<ref name=Veltkamp>{{cite journal |author=Veltkamp C, Tonkonogy SL, De Jong YP, ''et al.'' |title=Continuous stimulation by normal luminal bacteria is essential for the development and perpetuation of colitis in Tg(epsilon26) mice |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=120 |issue=4 |pages=900–13 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11231944 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508501606103 |doi=10.1053/gast.2001.22547}}</ref>  However, while some bacterial strains such as ''C. difficile''<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada, 2003a"/> and even normal gut bacteria cause colitis,<ref name=Veltkamp/> others prevent the disease in mice.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada, 2003a"/>

===Obesity===
Obese mice lacking leptin, a lipid metabolism regulator (ob/ob mice), have a distinct gut flora compared to (normal) lean mice, reflected in a change in the ratio between bacteria from the divisions [[Bacteroidetes]] and [[Firmicutes]], which is shifted towards fewer [[Bacteroidetes]] and more [[Firmicutes]] in obese mice.

The microbes occupying the human gut are also in direct relation to [[obesity]]. A shift in the ratio between bacterial divisions [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]] can be observed in lean and obese individuals—in the latter, a shift towards [[Firmicutes]] can be observed. The ratio between [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]] dynamically reflects the overall weight condition of an individual, shifting towards [[Bacteroidetes]] if an obese individual loses weight.
 
The mutual influence of gut flora composition and weight condition is connected to differences in the energy-reabsorbing potential of different ratios of [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]], especially in the digestion of fatty acids and dietary polysaccharides, as shown by experiments wherein the (caecum) gut flora of obese mice were transplanted into germ-free recipient mice, leading to an increase in weight despite a decrease in food consumption.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ley RE, Turnbaugh PJ, Klein S, Gordon JI |title=Microbial ecology: human gut microbes associated with obesity |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7122 |pages=1022–3 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17183309 |doi=10.1038/4441022a}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Turnbaugh PJ, Ley RE, Mahowald MA, Magrini V, Mardis ER, Gordon JI |title=An obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7122 |pages=1027–31 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17183312 |doi=10.1038/nature05414}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bäckhed F, Manchester JK, Semenkovich CF, Gordon JI |title=Mechanisms underlying the resistance to diet-induced obesity in germ-free mice |journal=Proc.
