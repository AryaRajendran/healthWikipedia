The [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] '''MIND Institute''' (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) research and treatment center affiliated with the [[University of California, Davis]], with facilities located on the [[UC Davis School of Medicine|UC Davis Medical Center]] campus in [[Sacramento, California]]. The institute is a consortium of scientists, educators, physicians and parents dedicated to researching the causes of and treatments for [[autism spectrum disorder]]s, [[fragile X syndrome]], and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

==Origins==

Parents of [[autism|autistic]] children led the drive to raise funds for the cause, anticipating the institute could become the premiere [[autism]] research institute in the world. Among the parents behind the institute are Chuck and [[Sarah Gardner]], whose son Chas has been diagnosed with autism. Chuck is a Sacramento area building contractor and co-founder of the institute along with his wife, Sarah, a television anchorwoman for Sacramento (KCRA 3).{{cn|date=December 2012}}

The institute's largest contribution came from the [[California State Legislature]], which provided $34 million to the institute for autism research. The efforts enabled construction of the institute's facility at the UC Davis Medical Center campus in Sacramento. After the major funding from the State, [[Rick Rollens]], the former Secretary of the California State Senate and one of the leaders in the effort to create the institute, said the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) was funding genetic-oriented research into autism, and that the MIND Institute was created by parents demanding that scientists look at other causes.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

==Interdisciplinary research teams==

The MIND Institute brings together experts in fields as diverse as [[molecular genetics]] and clinical [[pediatrics]], using a [[multidisciplinary]] approach to treating and finding cures for [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.

[[David Amaral|David G. Amaral]], PhD, is the research director of the MIND Institute and a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Center for Neuroscience, a [[neuroscientist]] who studies the organization of memory systems in the brain. Sally Rogers, Ph.D. is a specialist in [[developmental psychology]] and professor of [[psychiatry]] and [[behavior]] science for the institute.

==Prevalence study==

In October 2002, the institute released a study appearing to confirm that the prevalence of autism has risen steeply. The study was led by Dr. Robert Byrd, whose team gathered information on 684 children with [[developmental disabilities]] from [[California]]'s Department of Developmental Services regional centers.  Byrd's team's reported autism was on the rise in California, and that some of the increase was real and could not be explained by artificial factors such as misclassification and diagnostic criteria changes, nor by migration of children into California.<ref>{{vcite paper |author=Byrd RS, Sage AC, Keyzer J ''et al.'' |author.= |publisher=[[M.I.N.D.

However, a study published in 2009 found that the seven- to eight-fold increase in the number children born in California with autism since 1990 cannot be explained by either changes in diagnosis or counting.<ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/134717.php</ref>  Published in the January 2009 issue of Epidemiology, results also suggest that research should shift from genetics to the host of chemicals and infectious microbes in the environment that are likely at the root of changes in the neurodevelopment of California's children.

==Autism Phenome Project==

In 2006, the MIND Institute launched its Autism Phenome Project, with the objective of identifying biological and behavioral patterns in order to define distinct [[autism spectrum]] subtypes.  According to Amaral, "The tremendous variation in autism leads us to believe that it is a group of disorders rather than a single one."<ref>{{vcite press release |url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20071107_medicine_autism/index.html |title=Getting closer to finding the culprits |publisher=UC Davis Health System |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

The longitudinal study will enroll 1800 children, aged two to four: 900 diagnosed with autism, 450 with developmental delays, and 450 [[neurotypical]] control subjects.  The study will involve systematic analyses of immune systems, brain structures, genetics, environmental exposures and blood proteins and other developmental indicators, and the medical evaluations will continue for several years.{{cn|date=December 2012}}
