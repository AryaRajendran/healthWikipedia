'''Vision Aid Overseas''' is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]]<ref>{{EW charity|1081695}}</ref> in the [[United Kingdom]], which provides optical aid and services to developing countries in [[Africa]].

==History==
In 1985, a group of British [[optometrist]]s and dispensing [[optician]]s each took two weeks out of their businesses to establish clinics in [[Tanzania]], where they tested the eyes of local people and dispensed second-hand spectacles collected in UK. After the project gained publicity via the media and resultant public support, they formalised their efforts by registering the charity Vision Aid Overseas in 1987.<ref name="StaFind">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stafffinders.co.uk/vision-aid/|title=Vision Aid Overseas|publisher=Stafffinders|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref>

Founded on the delivery of direct service to patient, since registering as a charity, VAO has operated direct service clinics in 23 countries and tested the eyes of over 600,000 patients, helping over 350,000 people to see with a pair of spectacles.<ref name="StaFind"/>

In the 1997 [[New Year Honours 1997|New Years Honours]] list, founder Brian Ellis was awarded the [[MBE]].

==Operations==
VAO today focuses it operations around three core services:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visionaidoverseas.smartchange.org/|title=Vision Aid Overseas|publisher=SmartChange|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref>
*'''Optical Training:''' Establish International Vision Centres where high quality spectacles can be manufactured and sold at an affordable price following a thorough eye examination
*'''Optical Workshop Development:''' Train local healthcare workers in practical eye testing and vision health skills that equips them to work as primary eyecare workers in their local communities
*'''Direct Service Deliver:''' Utilize the expertise of UK optical professionals who develop outreach services in areas away from existing facilities and who undertake teaching programmes across the developing world

VAO presently runs sustainable projects in five target countries: [[Ethiopia]], [[Malawi]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zambia]].<ref name="StaFind"/>

===Support===
VAO Honorary Vice Presidents include competing newsreaders [[Fiona Bruce]] of the BBC, and [[Trevor MacDonald|Sir Trevor MacDonald]] of [[ITV News]]. In February 2005 Bruce did the voice over for VAO's Lifeline Appeal, and in 2007 launched VAO's Annual Review.

The charity has formalised its relationship with the UK eye care industry, and is often the chosen charity supported by many dispensing opticians, and professionals via the [[Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers]], who collect old spectacles from customers for [[recycling]] via VAO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dandacharity.co.uk/tag/vision-aid-overseas/|title=Vision Aid Overseas|publisher=Dollond & Aitchison|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.selectspecs.com/info/vision-aid-overseas/|title=Supporting Vision Aid Overseas|publisher=SelectSpecs|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vision-Aid-Overseas-and-Specsavers/39396635209|title=Vision Aid Overseas and Specsavers|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref>

The charity gained publicity in 2005 after the death of ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' game show host [[Richard Whiteley]]. After his death, his longtime partner [[Kathryn Apanowicz]] donated three pairs of Whiteley's spectacles to VAO, who sent them with a team of optical professionals to Ethiopia, where they were fitted to three locals with the same prescription. The [[BBC]] followed this story on their ''Inside Out'' programme, which was broadcast on 19 September 2007.
