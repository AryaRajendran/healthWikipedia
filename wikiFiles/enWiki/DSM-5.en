==Development==
In 1999, a DSM–5 Research Planning Conference; sponsored jointly by APA and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), was held to set the research priorities. Research Planning Work Groups produced "white papers" on the research needed to inform and shape the DSM-5<ref>{{Citation |last=First |first=Michael B. |year=2002

On July 23, 2007, the APA announced the task force that will oversee the development of DSM-5. The DSM-5 Task Force consists of 27 members, including a chair and vice chair, who collectively represent research scientists from psychiatry and other disciplines, clinical care providers, and consumer and family advocates. Scientists working on the revision of the DSM have experience in research, clinical care, biology, genetics, statistics, epidemiology, public health, and consumer advocacy. They have interests ranging from cross-cultural medicine and genetics to geriatric issues, ethics and addiction. The APA Board of Trustees required that all task force nominees disclose any competing interests or potentially conflicting relationships with entities that have an interest in psychiatric diagnoses and treatments as a precondition to appointment to the task force. The APA made all task force members' disclosures available during the announcement of the task force. Several individuals were ruled ineligible for task force appointments due to their competing interests. Future announcements will include naming the workgroups on specific categories of disorders and their research-based recommendations on updating various disorders and definitions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Regier, MD, MPH |first=Darrel A. |year=2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-21

The DSM-5 field trials included "test-retest reliability" which involved different clinicians doing independent evaluations of the same patient—a new approach to the study of diagnostic reliability.<ref>Reliability and Prevalence in the DSM-5 Field Trials, January 12, 2012 http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Reliability_and_Prevalence_in_DSM-5_Field_Trials_1-12-12.pdf</ref>

Owing to criticism over the perceived proliferation of diagnoses in the current edition of the DSM, [[David Kupfer]], M.D., who is the DSM-5 Task Force chair and is shepherding the DSM's revision, said in an interview: "One of the raps against psychiatry is that you and I are the only two people in the U.S. without a psychiatric diagnosis."<ref>{{cite news

==First draft diagnostic criteria==
The first draft diagnostic criteria for DSM-5 has now been released. Revisions include the following:<ref>http://www.dsm5.org/Newsroom/Documents/Diag%20%20Criteria%20General%20FINAL%202.05.pdf</ref>
# The recommendation of new categories for learning disorders and a single diagnostic category, "autism spectrum disorders" that will incorporate the current diagnoses of autistic disorders, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder (not otherwise specified). Work group members have also recommended that the diagnostic term "mental retardation" be changed to "intellectual disability," bringing the DSM criteria into alignment with terminology used by other  disciplines.
# Eliminating the current categories substance abuse and dependence, replacing them with the new category "addiction and related disorders." This will include substance use disorders, with each drug identified in its own category. Eliminating the category of dependence will better differentiate between the compulsive drug-seeking behavior of addiction and normal responses of tolerance and withdrawal that some patients experience when using prescribed medications that affect the central nervous system.
# Creating a new category of "behavioral addictions," in which gambling will be the sole disorder. Internet addiction was considered for this category, but work group members decided there was insufficient research data to do so, so they recommended it be included in the manual's appendix instead, with a goal of encouraging additional study.
# New suicide scales for adults and adolescents to help clinicians identify those individuals most at risk, with a goal of enhancing interventions across a broad range of mental disorders; the scales include research-based criteria such as impulsive behavior and heavy drinking in teens.
# Consideration of a new "risk syndromes" category, with information to help clinicians identify earlier stages of some serious mental disorders, such as neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and psychosis.
# A proposed new diagnostic category, temper dysregulation with dysphoria (TDD), within the Mood Disorders section of the manual. The new criteria are based on a decade of research on severe mood dysregulation, and may help clinicians better differentiate children with these symptoms from those with [[bipolar disorder]] or [[oppositional defiant disorder]].
# New recognition of binge eating disorder and improved criteria for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, as well as recommended changes in the definitions of some eating disorders now described as beginning in infancy and childhood to emphasize that they may also develop in older individuals.

'''Dimensional assessments'''<br>
In addition to proposed changes to specific diagnostic criteria, the APA proposed that
"dimensional assessments" be added to diagnostic evaluations of mental disorders. These would
permit clinicians to evaluate the severity of symptoms, as well as take into account "crosscutting" symptoms.

'''Careful consideration of gender, race and ethnicity'''<br>
The process for developing the proposed diagnostic criteria for DSM-5 has included careful
consideration of how gender, race and ethnicity may affect the diagnosis of mental illness.

==Proposed changes to DSM-IV diagnoses==

===Asperger syndrome===
{{Main|Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome#Proposed changes to DSM-5}}
Asperger syndrome will be eliminated as a separate disorder, and merged under [[autism spectrum]] disorders (ASD). Under the new classification, clinicians would rate the severity of clinical presentation of ASD as severe, moderate or mild. This change has been met with resistance amongst Asperger Syndrome specialists such as  [[Tony Attwood]] and [[Simon Baron-Cohen]].<ref>[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/child-myths/200911/away-the-aspergers-diagnosis-whats-it-all-about Away With the Asperger's Diagnosis: What's It All About?]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?_r=1&em A Powerful Identity, a Vanishing Diagnosis]</ref><ref>{{Cite document| title=Proposed Revision - APA DSM-5 - Asperger's Disorder |publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]'' |date=2010-02-13 |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=97#}}</ref>

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
{{Further|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}

There has been a proposal to increase the diagnostic criteria for the age when symptoms became present.  The proposal would change the diagnostic criteria from symptoms being present before seven years of age to symptoms being present before twelve years of age.  The new diagnostic criteria would read: "B.   Several noticeable inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present by age 12." <ref name="dsm5">{{Cite document| title=Proposed Revision - APA DSM-5 - 314.0x Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder |publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]'' |date=2010-05-20 |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=383#| postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>

There has been a proposal that for the Inattentive type and Hyperactive/Impulsive type, a minimum of only four symptoms need to be met if a person is 17 years of age or older.  The current [[DSM-IV-TR]] criteria of meeting a minimum of six symptoms for the Inattentive type or Hyperactive/Impulsive Type would still apply for those 16 years of age or younger.<ref name="dsm5" />

===Bipolar disorder===
{{Further|Bipolar disorder}}

There have been proposals to include further and more accurate sub-typing for bipolar disorder. (Akiskal and Ghaemi, 2006){{full|date=November 2012}}

There have been proposals for more stringent criteria for the diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder in children]]<ref name=carey2010nyt/> with a new diagnosis temper dysregulation disorder with dysphoria proposed.<ref name=carey2010nyt>{{Cite document

===Depression===
{{Further|Mood disorder}}
While currently grief is only considered a sign of depression if two months have elapsed since the death of a loved one, the new version would allow for diagnosis within the first few weeks.<ref>[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201003/normal-grief-vs-depression-in-dsm5 Normal Grief vs Depression In DSM5 | Psychology Today]</ref><ref>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=shades-of-grief Shades of Grief: When Does Mourning Become a Mental Illness?: Scientific American]</ref>

===Dissociative identity disorder===
{{Further|Dissociative identity disorder}}
Proposed changes to the controversial dissociative identity disorder diagnosis include adding a new diagnostic criterion: "C. Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning." This phrase, which occurs in several other diagnostic criteria, is proposed for inclusion in 300.14 as part of a proposed merger of dissociative trance disorder with DID. Criterion C would be included to "help differentiate normative cultural experiences from psychopathology". For example, professionals would be able to take [[shaman]]ism, which involves voluntary possession trance states, into consideration, rather than diagnosing those who report it as having a mental disorder.<ref>[http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=57 Dissociative identity disorder at the DSM-V] showing proposed revision, page found 2011-06-05.</ref><ref>[http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=436# Dissociative Trance Disorder at the DSM-V] showing proposed merger with Dissociative Identity Disorder, page found 2011-06-05.</ref>

===Gender identity disorder===
{{Further|Gender Identity Disorder}}
Gender Identity Disorder (GID) will be renamed "Gender Dysphoria" in the DSM 5.<ref>{{cite web | title = APA Removes Gender Identity Disorder from DSM-5 | publisher = Ms. Magazine | date= 2012-12-03 | url = http://www.msmagazine.com/news/uswirestory.asp?id=14011 | accessdate = 2013-02-11}}</ref> Along with these changes comes the creation of a separate Gender Dysphoria in Children as well as one for Adults and Adolescents. The grouping will be moved out of the Sexual Disorders category and into its own. The name change was made in part due to stigmatization of the term "disorder" and the relatively common use of "gender dysphoria" in the GID literature and among specialists in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=P 01 Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents or Adults|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/GenderDysphoria.aspx|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref>  The creation of a specific diagnosis for children reflects the lesser ability of children to have insight into what they are experiencing and ability to express it in the event that they have insight.<ref>{{cite web|title=P 00 Gender Dysphoria in Children|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=192#|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref>

===Hypersexual disorder===
{{Further|Hypersexual disorder}}
Hypersexual Disorder is proposed as a new category to be added. The diagnosis would apply when a person experiences several of the indicated symptoms (extreme amounts of time spent in the sexual activity, using the sexual activity in response to low mood or stress, failed attempts to reduce the behaviors, etc.).<ref name=APApage/> Moreover, it would apply only when the problem lasted six months or more, when person experienced significant distress or impairment in major life areas because of it, and when the problem was not directly caused by a medication or drugs, as well as other criteria. Under the proposal, an official diagnosis would also specify which behavior(s) are problematic in the case: [[masturbation]], pornography use, [[cybersex]], etc.<ref name=APApage>[http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=415 American Psychiatric Association DSM-5 Development Page for Hypersexual Disorder]</ref>

The label "hypersexual disorder" was reportedly chosen because it did not imply any specific theory for what causes [[hypersexuality]], which remains unknown.<ref name=Kafka2010>{{Citation |last=Kafka |first=M. P. |year=2010 |month=April

===Oppositional defiant disorder===
{{Further|Oppositional defiant disorder}}

It is proposed that the eight symptoms of Oppositional Defiant Disorder should be divided into the following categories: Angry/Irritable Mood; Defiant/Headstrong Behavior; and Vindictiveness. However, just as in the [[DSM-IV-TR]], four of these symptoms need to be present to meet diagnostic criteria.  The minimum four symptoms can come from all (or even just one or two) of the three categories.<ref name="dsm5a">{{Cite document| title=Proposed Revision - APA DSM-5 - 313.81 Oppositional Defiant Disorder |publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]'' |date=2010-05-20 |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=106#| postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>

It is proposed that a section be added to the diagnostic criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder stating that for children under 5 years of age, oppositional behavior "must occur on most days for a period of at least six months".  For children 5 years or older, oppositional behavior "must occur at least once per week for at least six months".<ref name="dsm5a" /> The current criteria states that four or more symptoms must be present for at least 6 months.  The proposed change adds the criterion of frequency of symptoms and also delineates required frequency by the age of the child.

===Personality disorders===
{{Further|Personality disorder}}

Major changes have been proposed in the assessment and diagnosis of personality disorders.<ref>{{Cite document| title=Personality and Personality Disorders |date=2010-02-13 |publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]'' |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/PersonalityandPersonalityDisorders.aspx| postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> These include a revamped definition of personality disorder and a dimensional rather than a categorical approach based on the severity of dysfunctional personality trait domains ([[Neuroticism|negative emotionality]], [[introversion]], [[wikt:antagonism|antagonism]], [[disinhibition]], [[Conscientiousness|compulsivity]], and [[schizotypy]]). In addition, patients would be assessed on how much they match each of six prototypic personality disorder types: [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]]/[[Psychopathy|psychopathic]], [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], and [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] with their criteria being derived directly from the dimensional personality trait domains.

===Pica===
{{Further|Pica (disorder)}}

It is proposed that Pica be reclassified from the "Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence" classification to the "Eating Disorders" classification.<ref name="dsm5b">{{Cite document| title=Proposed Revision - APA DSM-5 - 307.52 Pica |publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]'' |date=2010-05-20 |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=108#| postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> 

It is proposed that the wording of "non-food substances" be added alongside the current [[DSM-IV-TR]] wording of "non-nutritive substances".  "Non-food" was added to further clarify that items consumed are not just merely lacking nutrients (diet soda, according to the DSM-V committee, is an example of a non-nutritive substance), but are actual non-foodstuffs.<ref name="dsm5b" />

===Posttraumatic stress disorder===
{{Main|Posttraumatic_stress_disorder#DSM-5_proposed_diagnostic_criteria_changes}}
Various criteria changes are proposed.

===Schizophrenia===

==Criticism==
[[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]], the head of the DSM-III task force, has publicly criticized the APA for mandating that DSM-5 task force members sign a [[nondisclosure agreement]], effectively conducting the whole process in secret: "When I first heard about this agreement, I just went bonkers.

Bursztajn, MD noted that "the fact that 70% of the task force members have reported direct industry ties---an increase of almost 14% over the percentage of DSM-IV task force members who had industry ties---shows that disclosure policies alone, especially those that rely on an honor system, are not enough and that more specific safeguards are needed." <ref>Cosgrove L, Bursztajn HJ, Kupfer DJ, Regier DA.

In June 2009 Allen Frances issued strongly worded criticisms of the processes leading to DSM-5 and the risk of "serious, subtle, (…) ubiquitous" and "dangerous" unintended consequences such as new "false 'epidemics'".  He writes that "the work on DSM-V has displayed the most unhappy combination of soaring ambition and weak methodology" and is concerned about the task force's "inexplicably closed and secretive process.".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Frances | first = Allen | date = 26 June 2009 | year = | month = | title = A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences | journal = Psychiatric Times | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | pmid = | doi = | url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1425378?verify=0A | format = Full text | accessdate = 2009-09-06 | quote = }}</ref> His and Spitzer's concerns about the contract that the APA drew up for consultants to sign, agreeing not to discuss drafts of the fifth edition beyond the task force and committees, have also been aired and debated.<ref>{{cite news|first=Christopher|last=Lane|title=The Diagnostic Madness of DSM-V|work=Slate|date=July 24, 2009|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2223479/}}</ref>

The appointment, in May 2008, of two of the taskforce members, [[Kenneth Zucker]] and [[Ray Blanchard]], has led to an internet petition to remove them.<ref>{{cite news |title=Activists alarmed over APA: Head of psychiatry panel favors 'change' therapy for some trans teens |author=Lou Chibbaro Jr. |date=2008-05-30 |work=[[Washington Blade]]}}</ref>  According to MSNBC, "The petition accuses Zucker of having engaged in 'junk science' and promoting 'hurtful theories' during his career, especially advocating the idea that children who are unambiguously male or female anatomically, but seem confused about their [[gender identity]], can be treated by encouraging gender expression in line with their anatomy."<ref name=msnbc>{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Alexander |title=What's 'normal' sex?

In 2011, psychologist [[Brent Robbins]] co-authored a national letter for the Society for Humanistic Psychology that has brought thousands into the public debate about the DSM. Approximately 13,000 individuals and [[mental health]] professionals have signed a petition in support of the letter. Thirteen other [[American Psychological Association]] divisions have endorsed the petition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pointpark.edu/NewsArtsSciences.aspx?id=467 |title=Professor co-authors letter about America's mental health manual |author= |date=December 12, 2011 |work=Point Park University }}</ref> In a recent article about the debate in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Robbins notes that under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/26/MNJJ1M3DFK.DTL |title=

DSM-5, has been criticized saying nothing about the biological underpinnings of mental disorders.  Previous DSMs would also have this criticism.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=new-dsm5-ignores-biology-mental-illness ''New DSM-5 Ignores Biology of Mental Illness'']; "The latest edition of psychiatry's standard guidebook neglects the biology of mental illness. New research may change that." May 5, 2013 [[Scientific American]]</ref> 

===Borderline personality disorder controversy===
The Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD) campaigns to change the name and designation of [[borderline personality disorder]] in DSM-5.<ref>[http://www.tara4bpd.org Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD)]</ref> The paper ''How Advocacy is Bringing BPD into the Light''<ref>[http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=35 How Advocacy is Bringing BPD into the Light]</ref> reports that "the name BPD is confusing, imparts no relevant or descriptive information, and reinforces existing [[Social stigma|stigma]]...". Instead, it proposes the name "emotional regulation disorder" or "emotional dysregulation disorder". There is also discussion about changing Borderline Personality Disorder, an Axis II diagnosis (personality disorders and mental retardation), to an Axis I diagnosis (clinical disorders).

===More radical criticisms===
Some authors believe that the problem is not simply of a few criteria to be deleted or modified. For example, a [[Kuhnian]] reformulation of the diagnostic debate suggested that apparently trivial problems of the DSM, like the extremely high rates of [[comorbidity]], might fruitfully be analysed as Kuhnian anomalies leading the DSM system to a scientific crisis.<ref>Aragona M. (2009). [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/v016/16.1.aragona.pdf The role of comorbidity in the crisis of the current psychiatric classification system] PDF. [[Philosophy, Psychiatry, & Psychology]]  16: 1-11</ref> As a consequence, a radical rethinking of the concept of mental disorder was proposed, addressing its constructive nature.<ref>Aragona M. (2009) [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-02.pdf The concept of mental disorder and the DSM-V] Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences  2: 1-14</ref> Based on similar views, several revolutionary approaches were proposed, ranging from dimensional diagnosis to various forms of etiopathogenetic diagnosis.<ref>(an example from a cognitive point of view) Sirgiovanni E.

The financial association of DSM-5 panel members with industry continues to be a concern for financial conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cosgrove|first=Lisa|coauthors=Drimsky Lisa|title=A comparison of DSM-iv and DSM-5 panel members' financial associations with industry: A pernicous problem persisits|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2012|month=March|volume=9|issue=3|pages=1–5|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001190|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>

===British Psychological Society response===

The [[British Psychological Society]] in the United Kingdom stated in its June 2011 response that it had "more concerns than plaudits".<ref>[http://apps.bps.org.uk/_publicationfiles/consultation-responses/DSM-5%202011%20-%20BPS%20response.pdf British Psychological Society Response, June 2011]</ref> It criticized proposed diagnoses as ''"clearly based largely on social norms, with 'symptoms' that all rely on subjective judgements... not value-free, but rather reflect[ing] current normative social expectations"'', noting doubts over the reliability, validity, and value of existing criteria, that personality disorders were not normed on the general population, and that "not otherwise specified" categories covered a "huge" 30% of all personality disorders.

It also expressed a major concern that ''"clients and the general public are negatively affected by the continued and continuous medicalisation of their natural and normal responses to their experiences... which demand helping responses, but which do not reflect illnesses so much as normal individual variation"''. 

The Society suggested as its primary specific recommendation, a change from using "diagnostic frameworks" to a description based on an individual's specific experienced problems, and that mental disorders are better explored as part of a spectrum shared with [[normality (behavior)|normality]]:

{{quote|[We recommend] a revision of the way mental distress is thought about, starting with recognition of the overwhelming evidence that it is on a spectrum with 'normal' experience, and that psychosocial factors such as poverty, unemployment and trauma are the most strongly-evidenced causal factors. Rather than applying preordained diagnostic categories to clinical populations, we believe that any classification system should begin from the bottom up – starting with specific experiences, problems or 'symptoms' or 'complaints'...... We would like to see the base unit of measurement as specific problems (e.g. hearing voices, feelings of anxiety etc)? These would be more helpful too in terms of epidemiology.

While some people find a name or a diagnostic label helpful, our contention is that this helpfulness results from a knowledge that their problems are recognised (in both senses of the word) understood, validated, explained (and explicable) and have some relief. Clients often, unfortunately, find that diagnosis offers only a spurious promise of such benefits. Since – for example – two people with a diagnosis of 'schizophrenia' or 'personality disorder' may possess no two symptoms in common, it is difficult to see what communicative benefit is served by using these diagnoses. We believe that a description of a person's real problems would suffice. Moncrieff and others have shown that diagnostic labels are less useful than a description of a person's problems for predicting treatment response, so again diagnoses seem positively unhelpful compared to the alternatives.|[[British Psychological Society]] June 2011 response}}
