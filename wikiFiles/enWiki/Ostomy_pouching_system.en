An '''ostomy pouching system''' (also colloquially called a bag) is a [[medical device]] [[prosthetic]] that provides a means for the collection of waste from a surgically diverted biological system ([[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], [[ileum]], [[urinary]]) and the creation of a [[stoma (medicine)|stoma]]. Pouching systems are most commonly associated with [[Colostomy|colostomies]], [[Ileostomy|ileostomies]], and [[Urostomy|urostomies]].<ref name="ostomy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ostomy.org/ostomy_info/whatis.shtml|title=Ostomy Information|accessdate=September 3, 2010|publisher=United Ostomy Associations of America}}</ref>

Pouching systems usually consist of a collection pouch [[bag]],<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ostomy/SA00072</ref> known as a one-piece system or, in some instances involves a mounting plate, commonly called a [[wafer]] or a baseplate, and a collection [[pouch]] that is attached mechanically or with an [[adhesive]] in
an [[airtight]] seal, known as a two-piece system.  The selection of systems varies greatly between individuals and is often based on personal preference and lifestyle. Ostomy pouching systems collect [[waste]] that is output from a stoma. The pouching system allows the stoma to drain into a sealed collection pouch, while protecting the surrounding [[skin]] from [[contamination]].<ref name="Lueder">{{cite web|url= http://www.browardostomy.org/newsletter-articles/ostomate-choices.html|title= Ostomates' Choices|accessdate=September 3, 2010 |author=Lueder, Wendy |publisher=Broward Ostomy Association |archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081121081858/http://www.browardostomy.org/newsletter-articles/ostomate-choices.html |archivedate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

Ostomy pouching systems are air- and water-tight and allow the wearer to lead an active normal lifestyle that can include all forms of sports and recreation.

Ostomy pouching systems are also sometimes referred to as an [[Prosthesis|appliance]], where the term appliance refers to a prosthesis, as a mechanical replacement for a biological function.

== Wafers/Baseplates ==

Most wafers/baseplates are manufactured using [[pectin]] or similar organic material and are available in a wide variety of sizes to accommodate a person's particular [[anatomy]].

The internal opening must be the correct size to accommodate the individual's [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] while protecting the skin from contact with waste. The methods for sizing this opening vary depending on the type of wafer/baseplate; some pre-cut sizes are available, however most users normally customize the opening using [[scissors]]. Manufacturers have recently introduced moldable wafers than can be shaped by hand without the need for scissors.<ref name="ostomy1"/>

Skin adhesion for modern wafers/baseplates are optimized on all the five parameters required in an adhesive:

*[[absorption (skin)|absorption]]
*tack and adhesion
*flexibility
*[[erosion]] resistance
*ease of removal.

A wafer/baseplate may last between four to ten days before it needs to be replaced; this is highly dependent on the individual's lifestyle, ostomy type, and anatomy.

== Pouches ==

"disposable". Note the [[flange]] ring, which uses a "[[Tupperware]]" type of seal.]]
[[File:Ileostomy bag.jpg|thumb|right|One-piece (open-end) bags]]

For maximum hygiene and to reduce risk of infection, a one-piece (open-end) bag should be changed every 24 hours. A two-piece bag's base plate should be changed weekly with the bag changed every 24 hours.{{Fact|date=February 2013}}

The method of attachment to the wafer varies between manufactures and includes permanent (one-piece), press-on/click ("[[Tupperware]]" type), turning locking rings and "sticky" adhesive mounts. The two-piece arrangement allows pouches to be exchanged without removing the wafer; for example, some people prefer to temporarily switch to a "mini-pouch" for swimming, intimate and other short-term activities. Mini-pouches are suitable for minimum usage only.

Pouches can be broken down into two basic types: open-end (drainable) and closed-end (disposable).
* Open-end pouches have a resealable end that can be opened to drain the contents of the pouch into a [[toilet]]. The end is sealed [[Velcro]]-type closure at the end that eliminates the need for a clip.
* Closed-end pouches must be removed and replaced with a new pouch once the bag is full. This system can cause extreme damage to the skin area under the adhesive due to the frequency of removal and re-application.

The use of open-end vs. closed-end pouches is dependent on the frequency in which an individual needs to empty the contents, as well as [[economics]].<ref name="Lueder"/>

[[Flatulence|Gas]] is created during [[digestion]], and an airtight pouch will collect this and inflate. To prevent this some pouches are available with special [[Activated carbon|charcoal filtered]] vents that will allow the gas to escape, and prevent ballooning at night.
