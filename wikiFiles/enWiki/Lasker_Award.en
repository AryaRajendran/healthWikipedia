The '''Lasker Awards''' have been awarded annually since 1946 to living persons who have made major contributions to [[medical science]] or who have performed public service on behalf of medicine. They are administered by the Lasker Foundation, founded by [[advertising]] pioneer [[Albert Lasker]] and his wife [[Mary Woodard Lasker]] (later an influential medical research activist). The awards are sometimes referred to as "America's Nobels". Seventy-six Lasker laureates have received the [[Nobel Prize]], including 28 in the last two decades.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/2008special.htm The Lasker Foundation - 2008 Special Achievement Award<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Maria C. Freire]] is the current President of the Foundation.
