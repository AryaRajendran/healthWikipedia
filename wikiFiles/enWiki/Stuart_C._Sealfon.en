'''Stuart C. Sealfon, M.D.''', is an [[United States|American]] [[Neurology|neurologist]] who studies the mechanisms of both the [[Therapeutic effect|therapeutic]] and [[adverse effect]]s of [[Pharmacology|drugs]]. He was an early adopter of the use of massively parallel [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|qPCR]] and [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] to characterize cell response state<ref name=CIVIA> {{cite web |url=http://www.civia.org/Page5.html+ |title=The Center for Investigating Viral Immunity & Antagonism |format= |work= |accessdate=}} </ref> and his research accomplishments have included the identification of the primary structure of the [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor]], finding new signaling pathways activated by drugs for [[Parkinson's disease]], elucidating the mechanism of action of [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogens]] and finding a new brain receptor complex implicated in [[schizophrenia]] as a novel target for [[antipsychotic]]s.<ref name=Nature> {{cite journal |author=González-Maeso J, Ang RL, Yuen T, Chan P, Weisstaub NV, López-Giménez JF, [[Ming-Ming Zhou | Zhou M]], Okawa Y, Callado LF, Milligan G, Gingrich JA, Filizola M, Meana JJ, Sealfon SC |title=Identification of a serotonin/glutamate receptor complex implicated in psychosis |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=452 |issue=7183 |pages=93–7 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18297054 |pmc=2743172 |doi=10.1038/nature06612 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.healthbanks.com/PatientPortal/Public/NewsDetails.aspx?ArticleID=612979 |title=www.healthbanks.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2008/02/25/brain-discovery-may-aid-psychosis-treatment/1959.html |title=Brain Discovery May Aid Psychosis Treatment |author=Rick Nauert, Ph.D |date=February 25, 2008 |work= |publisher=PsychCentral.com |accessdate=January, 2010}}</ref>

==Biography==
Sealfon was born in 1956 in New York City. He graduated [[Magna Cum Laude]] [[Phi Beta Kappa Society | Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1978 and received the thesis award in [[comparative literature]]. He received his M.D. in 1982 from [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], where he was selected to the [[Alpha Omega Alpha|Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society]]. He completed an internship in medicine in 1983 and a residency in [[neurology]] in 1986 at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. After completing a fellowship in [[neuroscience]] at the [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Medical Center]], he was named Assistant Professor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 1988.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=249501721+ |title=ZoomInfo |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> 

Sealfon has served on the editorial boards of [[Endocrinology (journal) |Endocrinology]],<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.endocrinetext.com/authors.cfm+ |title=Endocrinology Online |format= |work= |accessdate=}} </ref> [[Endocrine Journal]], [[Molecular Endocrinology]] and the [[Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine]] and served as reviewing editor of [[Biochemical Journal]]. Additionally, he served on the advisory board of the Alanex Corporation.<ref name=CIVIA/>

Sealfon's work is supported by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] and the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]. He directs the multi-institutional Program for Research on Immune Modeling and Experimentation (PRIME), an NIH-funded Modeling Immunity for the Biodefense Center. Through the Sealfon Laboratory and The Mount Sinai Medical Center, he oversees research on human hallucinogenic drugs of abuse, immune cell signaling, and [[gonadotrope]] signaling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IE320080225042055&Page=3&Title=Features+-+Health+%26+Science&Topic=-162 |title=New receptor complex in brain identified |author= |date=August 27, 2008 |work= |publisher= Express Buzz |accessdate=January, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://hstalks.com/main/browse_talk_info.php?talk_id=488&series_id=42&c=252 Henry Stewart Talks – Online Seminars]</ref><ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.mountsinai.org/Research/Centers%20Laboratories%20and%20Programs/Sealfon%20Laboratory/Projects%20and%20Grants+ |title=Mount Sinai Medical Center - Projects and Grants |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
