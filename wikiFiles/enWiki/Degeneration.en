The idea of '''degeneration''' goes back to the 18th century, and had significant influence on [[science]], [[art]] and [[politics]] from the 1850s to the 1950s. The [[social theory]] developed consequently from [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of Evolution]]. Evolution meant that mankind's development was no longer fixed and certain, but could change and evolve or degenerate into an unknown future, possibly a bleak future that clashes with the analogy between evolution and civilization as a progressive positive direction. 

As a consequence, theorists assumed the human species might be overtaken by a more adaptable species or circumstances might change and suit a more adapted species. Degeneration theory presented a pessimistic outlook for the future of [[Western culture|western civilization]] as it believed the progress of the 19th century had begun to work against itself.

==History==
One of the earliest scientists to advocate degeneration was [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] and other [[monogenists]] such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], they were believers in the "Degeneration theory" of racial origins. The theory claims that races can degenerate into "primitive" forms. Blumenbach claimed that [[Adam and Eve]] were [[Caucasian race|white]] and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors such as the sun and poor dieting. Buffon believed that the degeneration could be reversed if proper environmental control was taken and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original [[Caucasian race]].<ref>Marvin Harris, The rise of anthropological theory: a history of theories of culture, 2001, p. 84.</ref>

By the mid 18th century, naturalists such as [[Carl Linnaeus]] recognised a large number of species, each with its own place in nature and with [[adaptation]] to a particular geographical location. Both points made the story of [[Noah's Ark]] seem untenable, with its prospect of organisms migrating from one point over vast stretches of hostile territory. From 1749 onwards [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] published a series of volumes of his ''Natural History'' in which he proposed that creatures had arisen by divinely ordained laws, separately in the old world and in the Americas. Where humans and families of animals were found in both continents, he suggested that they had migrated from the old world at a time when the world was warmer and routes were open, but had changed to suit the new conditions by degeneration from the ideal type. For an example of this "degeneration of animals", he described the cat family, in which the [[lion]] was distinct from the [[cougar]], and the [[leopard]] from the [[jaguar]], but differed even more from each other. From this he concluded "that these animals had one common origin and that, having formerly passed from one continent to another, their present differences have proceeded only from the long influence of their new situation." He wavered as to whether truly new species were produced by this process, and it is unclear as to whether this concept can be thought of as an early theory of evolution.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Young | first1 = David | title = The Discovery of Evolution | date = 2007 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-68746-1 | pages = 54–57 }}</ref>

[[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll]] claimed that modern savages were degenerate descendants from originally civilized peoples. He opposed [[evolution]] and followed cultural degeneration.<ref>Graham Richards, Race, racism, and psychology: towards a reflexive history, 1997, pp. 7-8</ref>

By 1890 there was a growing fear of degeneration sweeping across Europe creating disorders that led to [[poverty]], [[crime]], [[alcoholism]], moral [[perversion]] and [[political violence]]. Degeneration raised the possibility that Europe may be creating a class of degenerate people who may attack the social norms, this led to support for a strong state which polices degenerates out of existence with the assistance of scientific identification.

In the 1850s [[France|French]] doctor [[Bénédict Morel]] argued more vigorously that certain groups of people were degenerating, going backwards in terms of [[evolution]] so each generation became weaker and weaker. This was based on pre-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] ideas of evolution, especially those of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who argued that acquired characteristics like drug abuse and [[sexual perversion]]s, could be inherited. [[Genetic predisposition]]s have been observed for [[alcoholism]] and [[criminality]].

The first scientific [[criminologist]] [[Cesare Lombroso]] working in the 1880s believed he found evidence of degeneration by studying the corpses of criminals. After completing an [[autopsy]] on murderer Villela he found the indentation where the spine meets the neck to be a signal of degeneration and subsequent criminality. Lombroso was convinced he had found the key to degeneration that had concerned liberal circles.<ref>A. Herman op. cit. 110–113.</ref> 

In the twentieth century, eradicating "degeneration" became a justification for various [[eugenic]] programs, mostly in Europe and the United States. Eugenicists adopted the concept, using it to justify the [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] of the supposedly unfit. The [[Nazism|Nazis]] took up these eugenic efforts as well, including extermination, for those who would corrupt future generations. They also used the concept in art,

In Alexey Severtzov's typology of the [[evolution]] directions this term is used in an ethically neutral way; it denotes such an evolutionary transformation that is accompanied by a decrease in complexity, as opposed to [[aromorphosis]] (accompanied by increase in complexity, cp. [[anagenesis]]<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/23973458/Aromorphoses-in-Biological-%D0%B0nd-Social-Evolution-Some-General-Rules-for-Biological-and-Social-Forms-of-Macroevolution Aromorphoses in Biological аnd Social Evolution: Some General Rules for Biological and Social Forms of Macroevolution] in ''[[Social Evolution & History]]'' (Vol. 8 No. 2, September 2009: 6-50).</ref>), and idioadaptation (this term designates such an evolutionary transformation that is accompanied by neither a decrease nor increase in complexity, cp. [[cladogenesis]]) (see, e.g., [[Korotayev]] 2004).

== Art ==

There was an art movement called [[Decadent_movement|decadent art]] in the 1880s which had elements considered by critics as degenerate. 

[[Max Nordau]]'s book [[Degeneration_(Max_Nordau)|Entartung]] (1892) was rendered in English as Degeneration. Nordau blamed modern social phenomena for creating pathological conditions under which unacceptable art was produced. The artists who produced such art were diagnosed as "degenerate," which was a medical term referring to certain mental states caused by social forces.<ref>A. Herman (1997).

The Nazis also used the concept of degeneration in art, banning "degenerate" (''entartete'') art and music: see [[degenerate art]].
