The '''cricothyroid muscle''' is the only tensor muscle of the [[larynx]], aiding with [[phonation]]. It attaches to the anterolateral aspect of the [[cricoid]] and the inferior [[cornu]] and lower [[Planar lamina|lamina]] of the [[thyroid]] cartilage, and its action tilts the thyroid forward to help tense the [[vocal cords]].  Not to be confused with the [[posterior cricoarytenoid muscle]]s, which are the only muscles directly responsible for opening (abducting) the space between the vocal cords to allow for sound production. 

==Action==
The cricothyroid muscle produces tension and elongation of the [[vocal fold]]s by drawing up the arch of the cricoid cartilage and tilting back the upper border of the thyroid cartilage lamina; the distance between the vocal processes and the angle of the thyroid is thus increased, and the folds are consequently elongated, resulting in higher pitch [[phonation]].

== Innervation ==
This muscle is the only laryngeal muscle supplied by the branch of the [[vagus nerve]] known as the [[superior laryngeal nerve|external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve]] (rather than the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]]).
