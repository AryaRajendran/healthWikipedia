'''Robert Charles Gallo''' (born March 23, 1937) is an [[United States|American]] biomedical researcher. He is best known for his role in the discovery of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), the [[pathogen|infectious agent]] responsible for [[AIDS|acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), and he has been a major contributor to subsequent HIV research.

Gallo is the director of the Institute of Human Virology at the [[University of Maryland School of Medicine]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He and two longtime scientific collaborators, [[Robert R. Redfield]] and [[William A. Blattner]], co-founded the institute in 1996 in a partnership including the State of Maryland and the City of Baltimore. In 2005, Gallo co-founded Profectus BioSciences, Inc., which develops and commercializes technologies to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by human viral diseases, including HIV.<ref>[http://www.profectusbiosciences.com/ Profectus Biosciences, Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Gallo was born in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] to a working-class family of Italian immigrants. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] degree in [[Biology]] in 1959 from [[Providence College]] and received an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from [[Jefferson Medical College]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 1963. After completing his [[residency (medicine)|medical residency]] at the [[University of Chicago]], he became a researcher at the [[National Cancer Institute]]. Gallo states that his choice of profession was influenced by the early death of his sister from [[leukemia]], a disease to which he initially dedicated much of his research.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-07/Difference-Robert-Gallo-08-07-01.cfm | publisher = [[Voice of America]] | last = Palacio | first = Zulima | title = AIDS Researcher Robert Gallo Making a Difference |date = 2008-07-01}}</ref>

==Retrovirus work==
[[File:Robert Gallo.jpg|thumb|220px|Robert C. Gallo (in the early eighties)]]
After listening to a talk by biologist [[David Baltimore]], Gallo became interested in the study of [[retrovirus]]es, and made their study the primary activity of his lab. In 1976, Doris Morgan, a researcher in Gallo's lab, was successful in growing [[T lymphocyte]]s. Frank Ruscetti, Gallo, and Morgan coauthored a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' describing their method.<ref name=Morgan76>{{cite journal |author=Morgan DA, Ruscetti FW, Gallo R |title=Selective in vitro growth of T lymphocytes from normal human bone marrows |journal=Science |volume=193 |issue=4257 |pages=1007–8 |year=1976 |month=September |pmid=181845 |doi=10.1126/science.181845|bibcode = 1976Sci...193.1007M }}</ref> Morgan and Ruscetti eventually identified this as being dependent upon the activity of Blastogenic Factor, the T-cell growth factor previously discovered by Julius Gordon in 1965,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Gordon J, Maclean LD| title=A Lymphocyte-stimulating Factor produced in vitro | year=1965 | journal=Nature | volume=208 | pages=795–796 | doi=10.1038/208795a0 | pmid=4223737 | issue=5012|bibcode = 1965Natur.208..795G }}</ref> later renamed as [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] (interleukin-2) by Kendall A.

===HIV/AIDS research===
On May 4, 1984, Gallo and his collaborators published a series of four papers in the scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''<ref>The four papers are,

Gallo was awarded his second Lasker Award in 1986 for "determining that the retrovirus now known as HIV-1 is the cause of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).” He is the only recipient of two Lasker Awards.<ref>http://history.nih.gov/01Docs/about/LaskerAwardees.htm</ref>

In 1995, Gallo published his discovery that [[chemokine]]s, a class of naturally occurring compounds, can block HIV and halt the progression of AIDS. This was heralded by ''Science'' magazine as one of the top scientific breakthroughs within the same year of his publication.<ref name=Gallo_bio>{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Robert C.

Gallo's team at the [[Institute of Human Virology]] maintain an ongoing program of scientific research and clinical care and treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS, treating more than 4,000 patients in Baltimore and 200,000 patients at institute-supported clinics in Africa and the Caribbean.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-05/2008-05-08-voa29.cfm?CFID=61906268&CFTOKEN=94474033 VoA] Zulima Palacio. "AIDS Research Continues at US Laboratory, After Human Trials Halted." Voice of America, May 8, 2008.</ref> In July 2007, Gallo and his team were awarded a $15 million grant from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] for research into a preventive vaccine for HIV/AIDS.

In 2008, Montagnier and his colleague [[Francoise Barre-Sinoussi]] from the Institut Pasteur were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work on the discovery of HIV. [[Harald zur Hausen]] also shared the Prize for his discovery that [[human papilloma virus]]es lead to [[cervical cancer]], but Gallo was left out.<ref name="science nobel"/> Gallo said that it was "a disappointment" that he was not named a co-recipient.<ref name="nytimes-nobel">{{cite news | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]'' | date = 2008-10-06 | accessdate = 2008-10-06 | last = Altman | first = Lawrence | title = Three Europeans Win the 2008 Nobel for Medicine | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/health/07nobel.html}}</ref> Montagnier said he was "surprised" Gallo was not recognized by the Nobel Committee: "It was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and Gallo had a very important role in that. I'm very sorry for Robert Gallo."<ref name="science nobel"/>

===Controversy===
Assignment of [[List of scientific priority disputes|responsibility]] for the discovery of HIV has been controversial and was a subplot in the 1993 American television film docudrama (and earlier book about the early history of AIDS) ''[[And the Band Played On (film)|And the Band Played On]]''.

Montagnier's group, in France isolated HIV, almost one and a half years before Gallo,<ref name="Nobel Prize Surprise">{{cite news|url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/1006/1|title=Nobel Prize Surprise|publisher=[[ScienceNOW]]|date=6 October 2008|first1=Martin|last1=Enserink|first2=Jon|last2=Cohen|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref> while Gallo's group demonstrated that the virus causes AIDS and generated much of the science that made the discovery possible, including a technique previously developed by Gallo's lab for growing [[T cell]]s in the laboratory.<ref name=Morgan76/> When Montagnier's group first published their discovery, they said HIV's role in causing AIDS "remains to be determined."<ref name="science nobel">{{cite journal |author=Cohen J, Enserink M |title=Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Investigative journalist John Crewdson<ref>{{cite news | last = Crewdson | first = John |authorlink = John Crewdson | title = The Great AIDS Quest; Science under the microscope | publisher = (Special section, 16 pp.) ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' | date= 1989-11-19| url =}}</ref> suggested that Gallo's lab may have misappropriated a sample of HIV isolated at the Pasteur Institute by Montagnier's group.<ref name=sumf>[http://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/unh_round1/www.unh.edu/rcr/Misconduct-FraudGoTo2.htm Summary of fraud accusation]</ref> Investigations by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the HHS ultimately cleared Gallo's group of any wrongdoing.<ref name="science nobel"/> As part of these investigations, the [[United States Office of Research Integrity]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] commissioned [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] scientists to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. The conclusion was that virus used in Gallo's lab had come from Montagnier's lab, a patient virus that had contaminated a virus from another patient. On request, Montagnier's group had sent a sample of this culture to Gallo, not knowing it contained two viruses. It then contaminated the pooled culture on which Gallo was working.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sheng-Yung P. Chang, Barbara H. Bowman, Judith B. Weiss, Rebeca E. Garcia & Thomas J.

Because of the discovery uncertainties, the French and US governments disputed a patent for an HIV test that had been filed by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).<ref name="hilts"/> In 1987, the two governments agreed to split equally the proceeds from the patent,<ref name="hilts"/> naming Montagnier and Gallo co-discoverers.<ref name="science nobel"/><ref>{{cite news | last = Crewdson | first = John |authorlink = John Crewdson | title = U.S., France Settle Aids Virus Dispute; NIH will give up millions in profit from test patent | publisher = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' | date= 1994-07-12| url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-07-12/news/9407120109_1_dr-harold-varmus-aids-virus-pasteur-institute}}</ref> Montagnier and Gallo resumed collaborating with each other again for a chronology that appeared in ''Nature'' in 1987.<ref name="science nobel"/>

In the November 29, 2002 issue of ''Science'', Gallo and Montagnier published a series of articles, one of which was co-written by both scientists, in which they acknowledged the pivotal roles that each had played in the discovery of HIV.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Montagnier L |title=Historical essay.

In awarding the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 2008, the Nobel Committee decided not to grant Gallo the award. The rules limit the number of winners to three people, and the Committee chose to split the award to include both the discovery of HIV and the discovery of human papilloma viruses causing cervical cancer. The award was given to Montagnier (HIV), [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]] (HIV), and [[Harald zur Hausen]] (papilloma virus). Montagnier expressed his surprise that Gallo was passed over by the Nobel Committee.<ref name="science nobel" />

==HHV-6==
In 1986, Gallo, [[Dharam Ablashi]], and [[Saira Salahuddin]] discovered [[Human herpesvirus 6]] (HHV-6),<ref name="pmid2842514">{{cite journal |author=Anderson L |title=Human retrovirus family: cancer, central nervous system disease, and AIDS |journal=J.
