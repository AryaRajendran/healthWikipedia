The '''atlanto-occipital joint''' ('''articulation between the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] and the [[occipital bone]]''') consists of a pair of [[condyloid]] joints. The atlanto-occipital joint is a [[synovial joint]].

==Ligaments==
The ligaments connecting the bones are:

* Two [[articular capsules]]	
* [[Posterior atlanto-occipital membrane]]
* [[Anterior atlanto-occipital membrane]]

==Motions==
The movements permitted in this joint are:
* (a) [[flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] in the Sagittal axis, which give rise to the ordinary forward and backward nodding of the head.

* (b) slight lateral motion, lateroflexion, to one or other side in the Frontal axis. 

Flexion is produced mainly by the action of the [[longi capitis]] and [[recti capitis anteriores]]; extension by the [[recti capitis posteriores major]] and minor, the [[obliquus superior]], the [[semispinalis capitis]], [[splenius capitis]], [[sternocleidomastoideus]], and upper fibers of the [[trapezius]]. 

The recti laterales are concerned in the lateral movement, assisted by the trapezius, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, and the sternocleidomastoideus of the same side, all acting together.

==Tension-like headaches==
The atlanto-occipital joint features predominantly in the symptom of tension-like [[headaches]] as a result of prolonged inappropriate [[Human position|posture]] from poor [[ergonomic]] adaptation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In such cases, patients typically report cracking of the neck, discomfort when sitting, continuous [[migraine]]-like headaches, dullness, [[dizziness]], tingling in the fingers, [[sensitivity to light]] and a feeling the head is expanding.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
