'''Emergency contraception''' ('''EC'''), or '''emergency postcoital contraception''', are [[birth control]] measures that, if taken after sexual intercourse, may prevent [[pregnancy]].

== Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) ==
'''Emergency contraceptive pills''' (sometimes referred to as emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) in Great Britain) may contain higher [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]]s of the same [[hormone]]s ([[estrogen]]s, [[progestin]]s, or both) found in regular [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s. Taken after [[unprotected sex|unprotected sexual intercourse]] or contraceptive failure, such higher doses may prevent pregnancy from occurring.<ref name="fr 1997">{{cite journal |author=FDA |date=1997-02-25 |title=Certain combined oral contraceptives for use as postcoital emergency contraception |journal=Fed Regist |volume=62 |issue=37 |pages=8610–2}}</ref> 

The phrase "morning-after pill" is a misnomer; ECPs are most effective when used shortly after intercourse.

===Types of ECPs===
The [[Progestogen only pill|''progestin-only'']] method uses the progestin  [[levonorgestrel]] in a dose of 1.5&nbsp;mg, either as two 750 μg doses 12 hours apart, or more recently as a single dose. Progestin-only EC is available as a dedicated emergency contraceptive product under many names worldwide, including: in the U.S., Canada and Honduras as ''Plan B''; in Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and Italy as ''Levonelle''; in South Africa as Escapelle; in 44 nations including France, most of Western Europe, India, and several countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America as ''NorLevo''; and in 44 nations including most of Eastern Europe, Mexico and many other Latin American countries, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand, Israel, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore as ''Postinor-2''.<ref name="ecp worldwide">{{cite web |author=Trussell, James; Wynn, Lisa |date=2007-06-28 |title=Emergency Contraceptive Pills Worldwide |url=http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/dedicated.html |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> This pill typically works up to 72 hours after intercourse.<ref name="ella">Stockton, Rachel.

The ''combined'' or [[Yuzpe regimen]] uses large doses of both estrogen and progestin, taken as two doses at a 12-hour interval. This method is now believed to be less effective and less well tolerated than the progestin-only method.

Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are not to be confused with ''[[mifepristone]]'' (RU486, Mifeprex), which is used as an "abortion pill". The term "emergency contraceptive pill" does not refer to mifespristone, which is most commonly used in 200 or 600&nbsp;mg doses as an abortifacient.<ref>{{cite web | title=Planned Parenthood - Mifepristone: Expanding Women's Options for Early Abortion | url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/abortion/fact-early-abortion-mifepristone.xml | accessdate=July 23, 2006}}</ref> However, in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Russia]] only,<ref name="Gemzell-Danielsson 2011 467–472"/> mifepristone is available as either emergency contraception or as an [[abortifacient]], depending on whether it is used before or after implantation.

Higher doses of mifepristone can disrupt implantation and, unlike levonorgestrel, mifepristone can be effective in terminating established pregnancies.

===Effectiveness of ECPs===
The effectiveness of emergency contraception is presented differently from the effectiveness of ongoing methods of birth control: it is expressed as a percentage reduction in pregnancy rate for a single use of EC. Different ECP regimens have different effectiveness levels, and even for a single regimen different studies may find varying rates of effectiveness.  Using an example of "75% effective", an article in ''[[American Family Physician]]'' explains the effectiveness calculation thus: <blockquote>... these numbers do not translate into a pregnancy rate of 25 percent. Rather, they mean that if 1,000 women have unprotected intercourse in the middle two weeks of their menstrual cycles, approximately 80 will become pregnant. Use of emergency contraceptive pills would reduce this number by 75 percent, to 20 women.<!--

The progestin-only regimen (using levonorgestrel) is reported by the U.S. FDA to have an 89% effectiveness.  {{As of|2006}}, the labeling on the U.S. brand Plan B explained this effectiveness rate by stating, "Seven out of every eight women who would have gotten pregnant will not become pregnant."<ref name="Plan B 2006">{{cite web |publisher =[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] |month=August 24, |year=2006 |title=Plan B label information |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021045s011lbl.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-07-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070124182515/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021045s011lbl.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-24}}</ref>

====History of calculation methods====
Early studies of emergency contraceptives did not attempt to calculate a failure rate; they simply reported the number of women who became pregnant after using an emergency contraceptive. Since 1980, clinical trials of emergency contraception have first calculated probable pregnancies in the study group if no treatment were given.  The effectiveness is calculated by dividing observed pregnancies by the estimated number of pregnancies without treatment.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal|author=Dixon GW, Schlesselman JJ, Ory HW, Blye RP |title=Ethinyl estradiol and conjugated estrogens as postcoital contraceptives |journal=JAMA |year=1980 |volume=244 |issue=12 |pages=1336–9 |pmid=6251288 | doi = 10.1001/jama.244.12.1336}}</ref>

Placebo-controlled trials that could give a precise measure of the pregnancy rate without treatment would be unethical, so the effectiveness percentage is based on estimated pregnancy rates. These are currently estimated using variants of the [[calendar method]].<!--
 --><ref name="trussell 1996">{{cite journal |author=Trussell J, Ellertson C, Stewart F |year=1996 |title=The effectiveness of the Yuzpe regimen of emergency contraception |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=58–64, 87 |pmid=8777940 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3634/is_199603/ai_n8736107/print | doi = 10.2307/2136125 |jstor=2136125}}</ref>
Women with irregular cycles for any reason (including recent hormone use such as oral contraceptives and [[breastfeeding]]) must be excluded from such calculations. Even for women included in the calculation, the limitations of calendar methods of fertility determination have [[Calendar-based methods#Failure rate|long been recognized]].  In their April 2012 emergency review article, Trussell and Raymond note:
<blockquote>Calculation of effectiveness, and particularly the denominator of the fraction, involves many assumptions that are difficult to validate...The risk of pregnancy for women requesting ECPs appears to be lower than assumed in the estimates of ECP efficacy, which are consequently likely to be overestimates. Yet, precise estimates of efficacy may not be highly relevant to many women who have had unprotected intercourse, since ECPs are often the only available treatment.<ref name="Trussell 2012">{{cite web|last1=Trussell|first1=James|last2=Raymond|first2=Elizabeth G.|date=April 2012|title=Emergency contraception: a last chance to prevent unintended pregnancy|location=Princeton|publisher=Office of Population Research at Princeton University, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals|url=http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/ec-review.pdf|accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref></blockquote>

Existing pregnancy is not a [[contraindication]] in terms of safety, as there is no known harm to the woman, the course of her pregnancy, or the fetus if progestin-only or combined emergency contraception pills are accidentally used, but EC is not [[indication (medicine)|indicated]] for a woman with a known or suspected pregnancy because it is not effective in women who are already pregnant.<ref name="Trussell 2012"/><ref name="AAP 2005">{{cite journal|author=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence|date=October 2005|title=Emergency contraception|journal=Pediatrics|volume=116|issue=4|pages=1026–1035|doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1877|pmid=16147972|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/116/4/1026.full.html}}</ref><ref name="Grimes 2002">{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=David A.|last2=Raymond|first2=Elizabeth G.|date=August 6, 2002|title=Emergency contraception|journal=Ann Intern Med|volume=137|issue=3|pages=180–189|pmid=12160366}}</ref><ref name="ACOG 2010">{{cite journal|author=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|date=May 2010|title=ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 112: Emergency contraception|journal=Obstet Gynecol|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1100–1109|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181deff2a|pmid=20410799}}</ref><ref name="FDA Plan B Rx to OTC switch med review">{{cite web|author=FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|date=August 22, 2006|title=Plan B Rx to OTC switch Medical Reviews|location=Beltsville, Md.|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|pages=32–7, 133–77|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2006/021045s011_Plan_B__MedR.pdf|accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref><ref name="WHO MEC 2009">{{cite book|author=WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research|year=2009|chapter=Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)|title=Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use|edition=4th|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156388-8|page=63|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241563888_eng.pdf}}</ref><ref name="UK MEC 2009">{{cite web|author=RCOG Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare|year=2009|chapter=Emergency contraception|title=UK medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use|location=London|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|pages=107–115|url=http://www.fsrh.org/pdfs/UKMEC2009.pdf|accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref><ref name="US MEC 2010">{{cite journal|author=CDC Division of Reproductive Health|date=June 18, 2010|title=U.S. Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2010|journal=MMWR Recomm Rep|volume=59|issue=RR-4|pages=1–86|pmid=20559203|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5904.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Davidoff 2006">{{cite journal|last1=Davidoff|first1=Frank|last2=Trussell|first2=James|date=October 11, 2006|title=Plan B and the politics of doubt (commentary)|journal=JAMA|volume=296|issue=14|pages=1775–1778|doi=10.1001/jama.296.14.1775|pmid=17032991}}</ref>

===Side effects===
The most common side effect reported by users of emergency contraceptive pills was [[nausea]] (50.5% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users and 23.1% of 977 levonorgestrel-only users in the 1998 WHO trial; 14.3% of 2,720 levonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO trial); [[vomiting]] is much less common and unusual with levonorgestrel-only ECPs (18.8% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users and 5.6% of levonorgestrel-only users in the 1998 WHO trial; 1.4% of 2,720 levonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO trial).<ref name="WHO 1998"/><ref name="WHO 2002"/><ref name="FSRH EC 2012"/> [[Antiemetic|Anti-emetic]]s are not routinely recommended with levonorgestrel-only ECPs.<ref name="FSRH EC 2012"/><ref name="WHO SPR 20">{{cite book|author=WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research|date=December 31, 2004|chapter=Question 20.

Other common side effects (each reported by less than 20% of levonorgestrel-only users in both the 1998 and 2002 WHO trials) were [[abdominal pain]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[headache]], [[dizziness]], and [[mastalgia|breast tenderness]].<ref name="WHO 1998"/><ref name="WHO 2002"/><ref name="FSRH EC 2012"/> Side effects usually do not occur for more than a few days after treatment, and they generally resolve within 24 hours.<ref name="Trussell 2012"/>

Temporary disruption of the menstrual cycle is also commonly experienced. If taken before ovulation, the high doses of progestogen in levonorgestrel treatments may induce [[Progestogen#Progestogen withdrawal bleeding|progestogen withdrawal bleeding]] a few days after the pills are taken. One study found that about half of women who used levonorgestrel ECPs experienced bleeding within 7 days of taking the pills.<ref name="Raymond 2006">{{cite journal|last1=Raymond|first1=Elizabeth G.|last2=Goldberg|first2=Alisa|last3=Trussell|first3=James|last4=Hays|first4=Melissa|last5=Roach|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Taylor|first6=Douglas|date=April 2006|title=Bleeding patterns after use of levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills|journal=Contraception|volume=73|issue=4|pages=376–381|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2005.10.006|pmid=16531171}}</ref> If levonorgestrel is taken after ovulation, it may increase the length of the [[luteal phase]], thus delaying menstruation by a few days.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gainer|first1=Erin|last2=Kenfack|first2=Bruno|last3=Mboudou|first3=Emile|last4=Doh|first4=Anderson Sama|last5=Bouyer|first5=Jean|date=August 2006|title=Menstrual bleeding patterns following levonorgestrel emergency contraception|journal=Contraception|volume=74|issue=2|pages=118–124|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2006.02.009|pmid=16860049|pmc=1934349}}</ref> Mifepristone, if taken before ovulation, may delay ovulation by 3–4 days.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gemzell-Danielsson|first1=Kristina|last2=Marions|first2=Lena|date=July–August 2004|title=Mechanisms of action of mifepristone and levonorgestrel when used for emergency contraception|journal=Hum Reprod Update|volume=10|issue=4|pages=341–348|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh027|pmid=15192056}}</ref> (Delayed ovulation may result in a delayed menstruation.)

==Intrauterine device (IUD) for emergency contraception==
An alternative to emergency contraceptive pills is the copper-T [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) which can be used up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse to prevent pregnancy. Insertion of an IUD is more effective than use of Emergency Contraceptive Pills - pregnancy rates when used as emergency contraception are the same as with normal IUD use.  IUDs may be left in place following the subsequent menstruation to provide ongoing contraception (3–10 years depending upon type).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gottardi G, Spreafico A, de Orchi L |title=The postcoital IUD as an effective continuing contraceptive method | journal = Contraception | volume = 34 | issue = 6 |pages=549–58 |year=1986 | pmid = 3549140 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-7824(86)80011-7}}</ref>

==Postcoital high-dose progestin-only oral contraceptive pills as ongoing contraception==
One brand of [[levonorgestrel]] pills, Postinor, was marketed as an ongoing method of postcoital contraception.<!--

* If not used according to their package directions, but instead used according to the directions of levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills (up to 72 hours after intercourse), they would be estimated to have a "perfect-use" (when not used according to their package directions but used as directed on the package directions for levonorgestrel emergency contraception pills) pregnancy rate of 20% per year when used as the sole means of contraception (as compared to a 40% annual pregnancy rate for the Yuzpe regimen).<!--

ECPs are generally recommended for backup or "emergency" use, rather than as the primary means of contraception.

==History==
In 1966, gynecologist [[John McLean Morris]] and biologist [[Gertrude Van Wagenen]] at the [[Yale School of Medicine]] reported the successful use of oral high-dose estrogen pills as post-coital contraceptives in women and [[rhesus macaque]] monkeys, respectively.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901858,00.html | work=Time | title=Birth Control: The Morning-After Pill | date=1966-05-06 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref><!--

The Yuzpe regimen became the standard course of treatment for postcoital contraception in many countries in the 1980s. The first prescription-only combined estrogen-progestin dedicated product, Schering PC4 (ethinylestradiol and norgestrel), was approved in the UK in January 1984 and first marketed in October 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=Contraception: past, present and future|publisher=UK Family Planning Association|month=April | year=2006|accessdate=2006-11-09|url=http://www.fpa.org.uk/about/info/contraceptionpastpresentandfuture.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060928002621/http://www.fpa.org.uk/about/info/contraceptionpastpresentandfuture.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-09-28}}</ref> Schering introduced a second prescription-only combined product, Tetragynon (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) in Germany in 1985.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=3774816] By 1997, [[Schering AG]] dedicated prescription-only combined products had been approved in only 9 countries: the UK (Schering PC4), New Zealand (Schering PC4), South Africa (E-Gen-C), Germany (Tetragynon), Switzerland (Tetragynon), Denmark (Tetragynon), Norway (Tetragynon), Sweden (Tetragynon) and Finland (Neoprimavlar); and had been withdrawn from marketing in New Zealand in 1997 to prevent it being sold over-the-counter.[http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/nda/99/21-045_Plan%20B_medr.pdf][http://www.amwa-doc.org/index.cfm?objectid=1413E9D2-D567-0B25-593F3D9007E7AA63][http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/dedicated.html] Regular combined oral contraceptive pills (which were less expensive and more widely available) were more commonly used for the Yuzpe regimen even in countries where dedicated products were available.<ref>{{cite journal |author=FDA |month=February 25, |year=1997 |title=Certain combined oral contraceptives for use as postcoital emergency contraception |journal=Fed Regist |volume=62 |issue=37 |pages=8610}} "Since the United Kingdom approved emergency contraceptive pills in 1984, more than 4 million prescriptions have been recorded.

* In May 1973, in an attempt to restrict off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive to emergency situations such as [[rape]], a ''FDA Drug Bulletin'' was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES.<ref>{{cite  journal  |author=FDA |year=1973 |month=May |title=Postcoital diethylstilbestrol |journal=FDA Drug Bull |pmc=1455105 |pmid=18730987 |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=87–8}}</ref> (In February 1975, the FDA Commissioner testified that the only error in the May 1973 ''FDA Drug Bulletin'' was that the FDA had '''not''' approved postcoital contraceptive use of DES.)<ref name="Kennedy hearing">{{cite book |author=U.S. Senate |year=1975 |title=Regulation of diethylstilbestrol (DES), 1975: Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on Health and the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, 94th Congress, 1st Session on S. 963, February 27, 1975 |location=Washington |publisher=U.S. Govt.

In September 2006, emergency contraception expert [[Anna Glasier]] wrote a ''[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]]'' editorial entitled "Emergency Contraception. Is it worth all the fuss?" that said in closing: "So is emergency contraception worth the fuss? If you are a woman who has had unprotected sex then of course it is, because emergency contraception will prevent pregnancy in some women some of the time—and if you don’t want to get pregnant anything is better than nothing. If you are the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal|CMAJ]]’''s editor or FDA commissioner then yes, because scientific freedom is worth the fight. If you are looking for an intervention that will reduce abortion rates, emergency contraception may not be the solution, and perhaps you should concentrate most on encouraging people to use contraception before or during sex, not after it."<!--

Ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) has similar biologic effects as mifepristone and is approved for emergency contraception in Europe and is expected to become available in the U.S.in a single oral dose of 30 mg.

The failure rate (in a small number of studies) is very low, 0.1%.<sup>34,35</sup> This method definitely prevents implantation, but it is not suitable for women who are not candidates for intrauterine contraception, e.g., multiple sexual partners or a rape victim.

The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] in the 2008 Instruction [[Dignitas Personae]] (Paragraph 23) stated that: "Alongside methods of preventing pregnancy which are, properly speaking, contraceptive, that is, which prevent conception following from a sexual act, there are other technical means which act after fertilization, when the embryo is already constituted, either before or after implantation in the uterine wall. Such methods are interceptive if they interfere with the embryo before implantation and contragestative if they cause the elimination of the embryo once implanted...Therefore, the use of means of interception and contragestation fall within the sin of abortion and are gravely immoral. Furthermore, when there is certainty that an abortion has resulted, there are serious penalties in [[canon law]]." <ref>http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20081208_dignitas-personae_en.html</ref>
