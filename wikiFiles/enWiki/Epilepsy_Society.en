==History==

In 1892, a group of physicians from National Hospital for the Paralysed and the Epileptic, together with various philanthropists, founded the National Society for the Employment of Epileptics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sander|first=JW|coauthors=Barclay, J, Shorvon, SD|title=The neurological founding fathers of the National Society for Epilepsy and of the Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy.|journal=Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry|date=1993 Jun|volume=56|issue=6|pages=599â€“604|pmid=8509771|doi=10.1136/jnnp.56.6.599|pmc=489607}}</ref> The first executive committee of the Society
included the notable physicians [[John Hughlings Jackson]], [[William Richard Gowers|Sir William Gowers]], and [[David Ferrier]]. The aim was to establish an agricultural colony where people with epilepsy could live and work. A {{convert|370|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm was bought in Chalfont St Peter which at its peak in the 1950s, cared for over 550 people.

In the 1970s, an [[National Health Service|NHS]] treatment unit was established at Chalfont.

In 1995 a 1.5 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanner was installed - the first dedicated to research in [[epilepsy]]. This has now been superseded by a 3 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] instrument in 2004, which produces higher resolution images. The NSE's MRI Unit is at the forefront of [[medical imaging]] research applied to epilepsy. In 2011 the charity changed its name to Epilepsy Society.
