'''Malaise''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|z}} {{respell|mal|AZE|'}}) is a feeling of general [[suffering|discomfort]] or uneasiness, of being "out of sorts", often the first indication of an [[infection]] or other disease. Malaise is often defined in medical literature as a "general feeling of being unwell". The word has existed in the French language since at least the 12th century.

The term is also often used figuratively in other contexts; for example, "[[economic malaise]]" refers to an economy that is stagnant or in recession (compare [[Depression (economics)|depression]]). The term is particularly associated with the [[1973–75 recession]].<ref>One example can be found in ''The Next 200 Years: A Scenario for America and the World'', by [[Herman Kahn]] et al., published in 1976, p. 2.</ref> A speech made by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1979 is commonly referred to as [[Malaise speech|the "malaise" speech]], even though Carter did not actually use the term in this speech.

== Cause ==
Malaise is a highly [[non-specific symptom]] and causes can range from the slightest ailment, such as an [[emotion]] (causing [[vasovagal response]]) or hunger (light [[hypoglycemia]]), to the most serious ([[cancer]], [[stroke]], [[heart attack]], [[internal bleeding]], etc.).

Generally speaking, malaise expresses a patient's feeling that "something is not right", like a general warning light, but only a medical examination can determine the cause.
