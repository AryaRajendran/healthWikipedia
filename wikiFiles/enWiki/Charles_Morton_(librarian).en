==Life==
Morton first attended [[Leiden University]] from 18 September 1736.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=VT0BAAAAYAAJ&dq=english%20speaking%20students%20at%20leyden&pg=PA71#v=onepage&q=carolus&f=false ''Index to English speaking students who have graduated at Leyden University'', By Edward Peacock, Page 71]''.</ref> Some time before 1745, he moved to [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland|Westmoreland]], where he practiced as a physician. He then practiced in London for several years, and on 19 April 1750 he was elected physician to the [[Middlesex Hospital]]. He was admitted licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]] on 1 April 1751.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 16 January 1752 and was secretary of the Royal Society from 1760 to 1774.<ref name=DNB/> He was also a member of the Academy of [[St Petersburg]].

In 1754 also became physician to the [[Foundling Hospital]].<ref name=DNB>{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Morton, Charles (1716-1799)}}</ref> In June 1754, Lady Vere, wife of [[Vere Beauclerk]], wrote a letter of recommendation for Doctor Morton to temporarily replace Doctor Conyers who had recently resigned.<ref>''[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-afh_1-2&cid=1-1-1-28#1-1-1-28 "London Metropolitan Archives Foundling Hospital [A/FH/A/06&#93;"]''</ref> The recommendation was followed through in July 1754 when he was appointed to attend for the time being. 

By 1756, he was appointed under librarian of the British Museum.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=9g4IAAAAQAAJ&dq=charles%20morton%20British%20Museum&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=&f=false "Statutes and rules for the British museum, as altered in consequence, By British Museum, Page 37"]''</ref> At the British Museum, Morton was initially a medical under-librarian in charge of manuscripts in the [[Cotton library|Cotton]], [[Harley Collection|Harley]], [[Sloane Library|Sloane]], and [[Royal Collection|Royal]] collections.<ref>[[David M. Wilson]], ''The British Museum: A History''. [[The British Museum Press]], 2002. ISBN 0-7141-2764-7. Page 29.</ref> On the death of [[Matthew Maty]] in 1776, Morton was appointed principal librarian and held the office till his death.<ref name=DNB/> 

<ref>''[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/historica/places/stpetersburg.html "Academy of St. Petersburg"]''</ref> Morton died on 10 February 1799.<ref>John Nichols, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=mQ_QAAAAMAAJ&dq=charles%20morton&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1799&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1799&as_brr=0&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q=charles%20morton&f=false "The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 85, page 173]''</ref>

== Marriages ==
Charles Morton was married three, possibly four times; he married into the minor aristocracy.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=SNsN_sa2xg0C&dq=mary%20berkeley%20charles%20morton&pg=PA262#v=onepage&q=mary%20berkeley%20charles%20morton&f=false "Gentlemans Magazine, Volume 176, Page 262"]''</ref> The identity of his son Charles Carr Morton's mother is not clear. Although Charles Carr Morton's mother is listed as Elizabeth Pratt in ''Burke's Landed Gentry'' 1852 (Morton of Kilnacrott),<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=0NEKAAAAYAAJ&dq=morton%20kilnacrott&pg=PA891#v=onepage&q=morton%20kilnacrott&f=false "Burke's genealogical and heraldic history of the landed gentry, Volume 2 By John Burke, Page 891"]''</ref> this is a conventional impossibility, as shown by the sequence of known events.

;Marriage to Mary Berkeley
Morton first married Miss Mary Berkeley, niece of Lady Betty Germaine and granddaughter of [[Charles Berkeley, 2nd Earl of Berkeley]],<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=r_M6AAAAIAAJ&dq=mary%20berkeley%20charles%20morton&pg=PA622#v=onepage&q=mary%20berkeley%20charles%20morton&f=false "Collins's peerage of England; genealogical, biographical, Volume 3 By Arthur Collins, Sir Egerton Brydges, Page 622"]''</ref> on 13 September 1744.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iGDPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q=&f=false "The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 15, Page 108"]''</ref> at Kendal.<ref name="igi">''International Genealogical Index - Batch Number I029354''.</ref> They had one known child, Elizabeth Morton, born on 26 May 1745 also at Kendal.<ref name="igi2">''International Genealogical Index - Batch Number C003112''.</ref> Her descendants, through James Dansie, have been tracked as descendants of the Blood Royal, on account of Mary Berkeley's ancestry.

According to the 1812 Edition of ''[[Arthur Collins (antiquarian)|Collins' Peerage]]'', page 622, Mary Berkeley died on 10 March 1755.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=r_M6AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA622&dq=collins+peerage+berkeley+morton&ei=wAvRS_yoHp-QkAS3npjVCA&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false "1812 Edition of Collin's Peerage - page 622"] ''</ref> This Mary Berkeley did not die in 1768 and subsequently was buried at Twickenham on 6 October 1768, as stated in the current version of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', citing the ''International Genealogical Index'', in which a record is not currently found.

;Marriage to Mary Pratt

Charles Morton's second known marriage, to Lady Savile (born Mary Pratt), took place on 25 August 1767 <ref>'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=e_UqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA595&dq=Lady+Savile+Morton&lr=&as_brr=0&ei=0Q3RS_vJJJPmlQTK8IjjCA&cd=12#v=onepage&q&f=false "The London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer, Volume 36 By Isaac Kimber, Edward Kimber, Page 595"] ''</ref> at [[St. George's Church, Bloomsbury|St George Bloomsbury]] in London across the street from the [[British Museum]] where he was employed.

Lady Savile was 61 years old in 1767, and this was her third marriage. Her first marriage was to George Savile, 7th Baronet on 19 December 1722 <ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=kGABAAAAQAAJ&dq=George%20Savile%20mary%20pratt&pg=PA547#v=onepage&q=George%20Savile%20mary%20pratt&f=false "The autobiography and correspondence of Mary Granville, mrs.

Morton lived at Twickenham <ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=c9tCAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA353&ots=9vqXOU_E2O&dq=charles%20morton%20twickenham%20middlesex&pg=PA353#v=onepage&q=morton&f=false "Memorials of Twickenham: parochial and topographical By Richard Stuteley Cobbett, Page 75"]''</ref> in the former home of [[Elizabeth Montagu]], called Montagu House prior to his acquiring it and being termed Savile House thereafter. Lady Savile, at the age of 61, was too old to be the mother of Charles Carr Morton after she married Doctor Morton.

;Marriage to Elizabeth Pratt

Charles Morton's third known marriage was to Elizabeth Pratt,<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=xkMDAAAAMAAJ&dq=charles%20morton%20miss%20pratt%2035&lr=&as_brr=0&pg=PA487#v=onepage&q=charles%20morton%20miss%20pratt%2035&f=false "The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 61, Part 1, Page 487"]''</ref> who is said to have been age 35 at the time, also took place at St George Bloomsbury, on 25 April 1791,<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Jy0oAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA257#v=onepage&q=morton&f=false "The Scots magazine, Volume 53 By James Boswell, Page 257"]''</ref> one month and two weeks after Lady Savile died. Elizabeth Pratt was the daughter of Reverend Joseph Pratt and a near relation to Lady Savile. As such, she lived in the same household as Doctor Morton and his wife Mary Pratt from as early as 6 January 1778. This is evidenced both her wedding announcement in the Gentleman's Magazine,<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=xkMDAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA487&dq=1791+morton+pratt+%2235+years%22&ei=LRrRS6WWHoOUkASDufX0CA&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false "The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 61, Part 1, Page 487"]''</ref> and also by the summary of a letter now in the Nottinghamshire Archives, which states: "Note from Eliza Pratt sending Lady Savile's compliments to Mr. Hewett and that she will be much obliged to him if he invites Dr. Morton to dine at Grosvenor St. next Saturday." <ref name="nationalarchives.gov.uk">''[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=157-ddfjaddit_1&cid=-1&Gsm=2008-06-18#-1 " Foljambe of Osberton (additional deposit): Deeds and Estate Papers [DD/FJ/11/1&#93;"]''</ref>

== Family ==
Charles Morton had 14 grandchildren by his son Charles Carr Morton. In document at the Nottinghamshire Archives, Eliza Pratt writes: "...Dr. Morton intends putting him to Mr. Angelo's to ride and fence but he is not to go into the guards" <ref name="nationalarchives.gov.uk"/> which seems to indicate that Charles Carr Morton was anywhere from 16 to 18 years old in 1779, having been born around 1761â€“1763, six years after Mary Berkeley died, but four years prior to his marriage to Lady Savile. 

''Burke's Landed Gentry'' identifies Elizabeth Pratt as Charles Carr Morton's mother.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=0NEKAAAAYAAJ&dq=morton%20kilnacrott&pg=PA891#v=onepage&q=morton%20kilnacrott&f=false "Burke's Landed Gentry", page 891]''</ref> It is said that Elizabeth Pratt was 35 years old when she married Charles Morton in 1791 and therefore old enough to have been Charles Carr Morton's mother. However, Charles Carr Morton was married only 8 years after Elizabeth Pratt's marriage to Morton. 

On 1 May 1799<ref>''[http://members.pcug.org.au/~nickred/deeds/memorial_search.cgi?my_memorial=355689 "Registry of Deeds Index Project (Ireland)"]''</ref> Charles Carr Morton married Charlotte Tatlow <ref>Sylvanus Urban, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=RroUAAAAQAAJ&dq=Charlotte%2C%20widow%20of%20Charles%20Carr%20Morton&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q=&f=false "The Gentleman's Magazine", Volume 43, New Series, page 109]''.</ref> at Drumora Lodge in Cavan County, Ireland. By 5 January 1800, Charles Carr Morton was father to his first child Anna.<ref>''The Scotts of Lisanelly and Lisamallard'', pages 136â€“136 - available at Ancestry.com.</ref>

== Publications ==
In March 1767, Morton was put in charge of the publishing the ''[[Publications of the Domesday book since 1086|Domesday Book]]''; a fact which caused resentment towards him from [[Abraham Farley]], a deputy chamberlain of the Exchequer who for many years had controlled access to ''Domesday Book'' in its repository at the [[Chapter House]], Westminster, and furthermore had been involved in the recent Parliament Rolls printing operation.<ref>Ibid., p. 377</ref> In 1768 Farley complained to the Treasury that he, not Morton, should be in charge of the project, while Morton, for his part, complained that he was being obstructed in his work by the staff at the Chapter House.<ref>Ibid., pp. 376&ndash;77</ref> [[Abraham Farley]] took over the project and published a new [[Publications of the Domesday book since 1086#Abraham Farleyâ€™s edition (1783)|edition in 1783]].

Morton produced two large publications during his tenure at the Museum, both related to the activities of Sir [[Bulstrode Whitelocke]] including his ''Journal of the Swedish Embassy''<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=1NdJAAAAMAAJ&dq=Journal%20of%20the%20Swedish%20Embassy&pg=PP7#v=onepage&q=&f=false "Journal of the Swedish Embassy in 1653 and 1654"]''</ref> and ''Notes Upon the King's Writt''.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=f9WgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Notes%20Upon%20the%20Kings%20Writt&pg=PR6#v=onepage&q=&f=false "Notes Upon the Kings Writt"]''</ref> 

In 1759, Morton wrote a series of articles in the ''[[London Magazine]]'' about how annuities should properly be calculated, first appearing on page 251,<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=5RArAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA287&ots=Uuo2WcHN8n&dq=The%20London%20Magazine%20Annuity%20Morton&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q=The%20London%20Magazine%20Annuity%20Morton&f=false "The London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer, Volume 28 By Isaac Kimber, Edward Kimber, Page 251"]''</ref> debated further on page 286 <ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=5RArAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA287&ots=Uuo2WcHN8n&dq=The%20London%20Magazine%20Annuity%20Morton&pg=PA286#v=onepage&q=The%20London%20Magazine%20Annuity%20Morton&f=false "The London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer, Volume 28 By Isaac Kimber, Edward Kimber, Page 286"]''</ref> and answered by Morton on page 425.<ref>'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=5RArAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA287&ots=Uuo2WcHN8n&dq=The%20London%20Magazine%20Annuity%20Morton&pg=PA425#v=onepage&q=Morton&f=false "The London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer, Volume 28 By Isaac Kimber, Edward Kimber Page 425"].''</ref>
