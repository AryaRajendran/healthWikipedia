The '''Monitoring the Future''' (MTF) study, also known as the '''National High School Senior Survey''',<ref name=P&D>[http://monitoringthefuture.org/purpose.html Purpose and Design of Monitoring the Future]</ref> is a long-term [[epidemiological]] study that surveys trends in legal and [[illicit drug]] use among American [[adolescent]]s and [[adult]]s as well as personal levels of perceived risk and disapproval for each drug. The survey is conducted by researchers at the [[University of Michigan]]'s Institute for Social Research, funded by [[research grant]]s from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], one of the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref name=MTF2010> Johnston, L.

==Survey design==
The survey began in 1975 and only focused on that year's senior class. [[Questionnaires]] are sent out yearly by mail. Beginning in 1976, a proportion of survey participants were also chosen for [[Biennale (disambiguation)|biennial]] reevaluations. In 1991, the survey was expanded to include 8th and 10th grade students.<ref name=P&D/> The questionnaire is [[Anonymity|anonymous]] for 8th- and 10th-grade students while the questionnaire for 12th-grade students is confidential—name and address information is collected for [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] follow-up surveys.<ref name=MTF2010/>

Nationally representative samples of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students (The 2010 MTF survey encompassed about 46,500 students from almost 400 schools nationwide<ref name=MTF2010/>) receive a questionnaire investigating [[substance abuse|substance use]] patterns, attitudes and beliefs about drugs, perceived availability of drugs, and norms among peer and role model groups.

The survey also evaluates a variety of topics beyond drug use. Questionnaire questions also explore subjects' occupational and educational plans and experiences, attitudes about [[gender role]]s, attitudes and experiences with people of a different race/ethnicity, trust in government and other institutions, concerns about [[the environment]], media consumption, victimization and delinquency, among other things. Follow-up studies into adulthood also cover [[marriage]] and family formation, college attendance, military service, civilian employment, [[unemployment]], and other topics.
