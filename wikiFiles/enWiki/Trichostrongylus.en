'''''Trichostrongylus''''' species are [[nematodes]] (round worms), which are ubiquitous among herbivores worldwide, including cattle, sheep, donkeys, goats, deer, and rabbits.<ref name="garcia">Garcia LS, editor.

At least 10 ''Trichostrongylus'' species have been associated with human infections.<ref name="garcia" /> Infections occur via ingestion of infective larvae from contaminated vegetables or water.<ref name="garcia" /><ref name="strickland" /> Epidemiological studies indicate a worldwide distribution of ''Trichostrongylus'' infections in humans, with the highest prevalence rates observed in individuals from regions with poor sanitary conditions, in rural areas, or who are farmers / herders.<ref>Adams VJ, Markus MB, Adams JF, Jordaan E, Curtis B, Dhansay MA, et al.

== Clinical presentation ==
The majority of human infections are asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms. Symptomatic individuals may experience abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, flatulence, dizziness, generalized fatigue, and malaise.<ref name="garcia" /><ref name="ralph" /><ref name="strickland" /> Eosinophilia is frequently observed.<ref name="garcia" /><ref name="ralph" /><ref name="strickland" /> Infections with a heavy worm burden can lead to [[anemia]], [[cholecystitis]], and emaciation.<ref name="garcia" /><ref name="strickland" />

== Diagnosis ==
The adult worms live in the [[small intestine]]. The diagnosis is based on the observation of eggs in the stool. The eggs are 85â€“115&nbsp;um, oval, elongated, and pointed at one or both ends.<ref name="strickland" /> ''Trichostrongylus'' eggs must be differentiated from hookworm eggs, which are smaller and do not have pointed ends.<ref name="garcia" /><ref name="strickland" />

== Prevention and treatment ==
Since the use of herbivore manure as fertilizer is a common practice preceding infection, thorough cleaning and cooking of vegetables is required for prevention of infection.<ref name="garcia" /><ref name="strickland" /> Treatment with [[pyrantel pamoate]] (11&nbsp;mg/kg base once, maximum 1 g) is recommended.<ref name="med letter">Drugs for parasitic infections. The Med Lett. 2007;5(Suppl):1-15.</ref> Alternative agents include [[mebendazole]] (100&nbsp;mg twice a day for three days) and [[albendazole]] (400&nbsp;mg once).<ref name="med letter" /> Successful treatment with [[ivermectin]] has also been reported.<ref name="ralph" />
