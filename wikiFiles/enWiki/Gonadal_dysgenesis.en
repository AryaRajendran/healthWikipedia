The first type of gonadal dysgenesis discovered was [[Turner syndrome]].<ref name="Carrell2010">{{cite book|author=Douglas T.

==Pathogenesis==
During [[embryogenesis]], without any external influences for or against, the human reproductive system is intrinsically conditioned to give rise to a female reproductive organisation.

As a result, if a gonad cannot express its sexual identity via its hormones—as in gonadal dysgenesis—then the affected person, no matter whether genetically male or female, will develop external female genitalia. Internal female genitalia, primarily the uterus, may or may not be present depending on the etiology of the disorder. 

In both sexes, the commencement and progression of [[puberty]] require functional gonads that will work in harmony with the hypothalamic and pituitary glands to produce adequate hormones.

For this reason, in gonadal dysgenesis the accompanying hormonal failure also prevents the development of [[secondary sex characteristics]] in either sex, resulting in a sexually infantile female appearance and infertility.

==Embryology==
This condition will occur if there is an absence of both [[Mullerian inhibiting factor]] and [[testosterone]]. The absence of testosterone will result in [[Regression (medicine)|regression]] of the [[Wolffian ducts]]; normal male internal reproductive tracts will not develop. The absence of Mullerian inhibiting factor will allow the [[Mullerian ducts]] to differentiate into the [[oviducts]] and [[uterus]]. In sum, this individual will possess female-like internal and external reproductive characteristics, lacking secondary sex characteristics. The genotype may be either 45,XO, 46,XX or 46,XY.

==Causes==
The condition may  be due to:
*[[Turner syndrome]], and its variations (i.e. [[mosaicism]])
*[[XX gonadal dysgenesis]], also pure gonadal dysgenesis, 46,XX
*[[Swyer syndrome]], also pure gonadal dysgenesis, 46,XY
*[[Perrault syndrome]], XX gonadal dysgenesis + sensorineural hearing loss
*[[Mixed gonadal dysgenesis]]
*Exposure to environmental [[Endocrine disruptors]]
