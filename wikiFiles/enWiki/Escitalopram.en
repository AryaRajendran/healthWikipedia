'''Escitalopram''' (trade names '''Nexito''', '''Anxiset-E '''(India), '''Exodus''' (Brazil), '''Esto''' (Israel), '''Lexapro''', '''Cipralex''', '''Seroplex''', '''Elicea''', '''Lexamil''', '''Lexam''', '''Entact''' (Greece), '''Losita''' (Bangladesh), '''Reposil''' (Chile), '''Animaxen''' (Colombia), '''Esitalo''' (Australia)), '''Lexamil''' (South Africa), is an [[antidepressant]] of the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) class. It is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of adults and children over 12 years of age with [[major depressive disorder]] and [[generalized anxiety disorder]]. Escitalopram is the (''S'')-[[stereoisomer]] ([[enantiomer]]) of the earlier [[Lundbeck]] drug [[citalopram]], hence the name ''es''citalopram. Escitalopram is noted for its high selectivity with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|serotonin reuptake inhibition]]. The similarity between escitalopram and citalopram has led to accusations of "[[evergreening]]", an accusation that Lundbeck has rejected.<ref name=Ind>[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-pays-millions-of-pounds-more-than-it-needs-to-for-drugs-2365615.html ''NHS pays millions of pounds more than it needs to for drugs''], ''The Independent''.

==Adverse effects==

[[Citalopram]] and escitalopram are associated with dose-dependent [[QT interval]] prolongation and should not be used in those with congenital long QT syndrome or known pre-existing QT interval prolongation, or in combination with other medicines that prolong the QT interval. ECG measurements should be considered for patients with cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected before starting treatment. For citalopram, new restrictions on the maximum daily doses now apply: 40&nbsp;mg for adults; 20&nbsp;mg for patients older than 65 years; and 20&nbsp;mg for those with hepatic impairment.
For escitalopram, the maximum daily dose for patients older than 65 years is now reduced to 10&nbsp;mg/day; other doses remain unchanged.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON137769 | title = Citalopram and escitalopram: QT interval prolongation—new maximum daily dose restrictions (including in elderly patients), contraindications, and warnings | date = December 2011 | publisher = [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] | accessdate = March 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url = http://m.utoledo.edu/med/gme/em/pdfs/ECG_escitalopram.pdf | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.04.016 | title = Clinical and ECG Effects of Escitalopram Overdose | year = 2009 | last1 = Van Gorp | first1 = Freek | last2 = Whyte | first2 = Ian M. | last3 = Isbister | first3 = Geoffrey K. | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 404–8 | pmid = 19556032}}</ref>

The [[Adverse drug reaction|side effect]] profile of escitalopram is similar to that of other [[SSRI]]s. For example, according to the FDA analysis of depression trials common side effects for the highest approved dose of escitalopram are insomnia (14% vs. 4% for placebo), dilated pupils (15% vs. 5% for placebo), dry mouth (9% vs 3% for placebo), [[somnolence]] (9% vs 1% for placebo), dizziness (7% vs 2% for placebo), sweating (8% vs 1% for placebo), constipation (6% vs 1% for placebo), fatigue (6% vs 2% for placebo) and indigestion (6% vs. 1% for placebo).<ref name=FDA10>{{cite web | author = FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research| title =Review and evaluation of clinical data for application 21-323|year=2001|accessdate = 2009-12-03 | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2002/21-323.pdf_Lexapro_Medr_P1.pdf}}</ref> SSRI can rarely cause [[extrapyramidal side effects]] including [[akathisia]] through the indirect inhibition of [[dopamine]].

===Overdose===

Excessive doses of escitalopram usually cause relatively minor untoward effects such as agitation and tachycardia. However, [[dyskinesia]], [[hypertonia]] and [[clonus]] may occur in some cases. Plasma escitalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 20-80 μg/L in therapeutic situations and may reach 80-200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, citalopram.<ref>van Gorp F, Whyte IM, Isbister GK. Clinical and ECG effects of escitalopram overdose. Ann. Emer.

[[Image:Cipralex.jpg|thumb|right|Cipralex brand escitalopram 10mg package and tablet sheet]]

Escitalopram increases intrasynaptic levels of the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] by blocking the [[reuptake]] of the neurotransmitter into the presynaptic neuron. Of the SSRIs currently on the market, escitalopram has the highest affinity for the human [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT). The enantiomer of escitalopram ((''R'')-citalopram) counteracts to a certain degree the serotonin-enhancing action of escitalopram. As a result, escitalopram has been claimed to be a more potent antidepressant than citalopram, which is a mixture of  escitalopram and (''R'')-citalopram.
In order to explain this phenomenon, researchers from Lundbeck proposed that escitalopram enhances its own binding via an additional interaction with another [[allosteric site]] on the transporter.<ref name="pmid15160261">For an overview of supporting data, see {{cite journal

}}</ref> Although allosteric binding of escitalopram to the serotonin transporter is of unquestionable research interest, its clinical relevance is unclear since the binding of escitalopram to the allosteric site is at least 1000 times weaker than to the primary binding site.

''In vitro'' studies using human liver microsomes indicated that [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2C19]] are the primary isozymes involved in the ''N''-demethylation of escitalopram. The resulting metabolites, [[desmethylescitalopram]] and [[didesmethylescitalopram]], are significantly less active and their contribution to the overall action of escitalopram is negligible.

==History==

Escitalopram was developed in close cooperation between [[Lundbeck]] and [[Forest Laboratories]]. Its development was initiated in the summer of 1997, and the resulting new drug application was submitted to the U.S. FDA in March 2001. The short time (3.5 years) it took to develop escitalopram can be attributed to the previous extensive experience of Lundbeck and Forest with [[citalopram]], which has similar pharmacology.<ref>{{cite web | title=2000 Annual Report. p 28 and 33 | url=http://www.materials.lundbeck.com/lundbeck/82/fullpdf/1.pdf |format=PDF |year=2000 |publisher=Lundbeck | accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>
The FDA issued the approval of escitalopram for major depression in August 2002 and for generalized anxiety disorder in December 2003. Escitalopram can be considered an example of "[[evergreening]]"<ref>{{cite web | title="New drugs from old".

Escitalopram is an [[enantiomer|enantiopure compound]] of the [[racemic mixture]] [[citalopram]], used for the same indication, and for that reason it required less investment and less time to develop. Two years after escitalopram's launch, when the patent on citalopram expired, the escitalopram sales successfully made up for the loss. On May 23, 2006, the FDA approved a generic version of escitalopram by Teva.<ref>{{cite news |author=Miranda Hitti |title=FDA OKs Generic Depression Drug – Generic Version of Lexapro Gets Green Light |url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/122/114778.htm |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> On July 14 of that year, however, the [[United States District Court for the District of Delaware|U.S. District Court of Delaware]] decided in favor of Lundbeck regarding the patent infringement dispute and ruled the patent on escitalopram valid.<ref>{{cite news |author=Marie-Eve Laforte |title= US court upholds Lexapro patent |date=2006-07-14 |url=http://www.firstwordplus.com/Fws.do?src=corp_site&articleid=7474B41ED0D14C20894E262219E24B62 |publisher=FirstWord |accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

In 2006 Forest Laboratories was granted an 828 day (2 years and 3 months) extension on its [[united States of America|US]] patent for escitalopram.<ref>{{cite press release

==Controversy==

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', aggressive [[pharmaceutical marketing]] of escitalopram by Forest Laboratories has been controversial: the generic alternatives to the drug are cheaper, but a substantial number of doctors continue to prescribe the more expensive proprietary drug. The [[United States Senate Special Committee on Aging]] has released portions of the "Lexapro Fiscal 2004 Marketing Plan" which gives some of the details of the plans to promote use of the drug by doctors.<ref>Harris, "A Drug Maker’s Playbook Reveals a Marketing Strategy"</ref>{{full}}<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/politics/20090831MEDICARE/20090831_MEDICARE.pdf Lexapro Fiscal 2004 Marketing Plan]</ref>

In 2004, two separate civil suits alleging illegal marketing of citalopram and escitalopram for use by children and teenagers by Forest were initiated by two whistleblowers, one by a non-practicing physician named Joseph Piacentile, and the other by a Forest salesman named Christopher Gobble who was disturbed by what he witnessed at Forest.<ref>[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202428657301 "Forest Laboratories: A Tale of Two Whistleblowers"] article by Alison Frankel in ''[[The American Lawyer]] February 27, 2009</ref>

In February 2009, these two suits received support from the US Attorney for Massachusetts and were combined into one. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have also filed notices of intention to intervene as plaintiffs in the action. At the time, these drugs were approved only for use by adults and the application for use of citalopram in children was specifically rejected by the FDA. Although it is not illegal for physicians to prescribe a medicine for an off-label use not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it is illegal for a manufacturer to promote the drugs for such uses. The government alleged that a research study showing lack of effectiveness when taken by children was concealed from its own medical advisers and sales personnel, as well as from researchers who conducted a study financed by the company. From 2001 to 2004, Forest heavily promoted results from another clinical trial it had financed which showed the drug was effective. Federal prosecutors also allege that the company has paid kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe the medicines to children. The kickbacks allegedly included baseball tickets, a $1000 certificate to one of the most expensive New York restaurants, and paid vacations. Further, the complaint alleges that in September 2004, a Forest executive testified before Congress: "I want to emphasize that, because the FDA has not approved pediatric labeling of our products, Forest has always been scrupulous about not promoting the pediatric use of our antidepressant drugs, Celexa and Lexapro. That is the law and we follow it." It is also alleged that the company conducted so-called "seeding studies" that were, in reality, marketing efforts to promote the drug's use by doctors.<ref>[http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/forestfca.pdf United States of America v. Forest Laboratories] Full text of the federal complaint filed in the US District Court for the district of Massachusetts</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/business/26drug.html "Drug Maker Is Accused of Fraud"] article by Barry Meier and Benedict Carey in ''[[The New York Times]] February 25, 2009</ref> Forest responded to these allegations that it "is committed to adhering to the highest ethical and legal standards, and off-label promotion and improper payments to medical providers have consistently been against Forest policy.<ref>[http://www.frx.com/news/PressRelease.aspx?ID=1260234 "Forest Laboratories, Inc.

In Britain, the form Cipralex costs [[£]]14.91, while Lundbeck's older Cipramil can be found for £1.31. ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper reported that this costs Britain's [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) almost £25m extra per year, with no clear clinical benefits.<ref name=Ind/> ''The Independent'' also describes the patenting of escitalopram as an example of [[evergreening]] — slightly changing a drug that is about to go off-patent in order to acquire a patent for the new version, despite its containing similar ingredients to the previous version.<ref name=Ind/> Lundbeck has denied that it has "evergreened" escitalopram.
