'''''Mycobacterium malmoense''''' is a bacterium. <br />
[[Etymology]]: malmoense, from the city of [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]] where it was first isolated.

==Description==
[[Gram-positive]], nonmotile, [[acid-fast]] and [[coccoid]] to short rods.
*Environmental reservoir: soil and water.

'''Colony characteristics'''
*Smooth and nonpigmented colonies, growth below the surface of semisolid agar medium after deep inoculation (as seen with [[Mycobacterium bovis|M. bovis]]), 0.9 - 1.7mm in diameter.

'''Physiology'''
*Growth on inspissated egg medium and oleic acid-albumin agar at a temperature range of 22°C-37°C requires over 1 week.
*Susceptible to [[ethambutol]], [[ethionamide]], [[kanamycin]] and [[cycloserine]].

'''Differential characteristics'''
*[[Antigenic]] structure: [[seroagglutination]] demonstrates a single [[serovar]] distinct from that of other species.

==Pathogenesis==
*Usually infects young children with [[cervical lymphadenitis]] or adults with chronic [[pulmonary]] disease, (mostly with previously documented [[pneumoconiosis]]).
*Rarely causes [[extrapulmonary]] diseases and disseminated infections
*[[Biosafety level]] 2

==Type strain==
*First isolated from [[sputum]] and [[biopsy]] specimens with [[pulmonary]] disease in Malmö, [[Sweden]].
Strain ATCC 29571 = CCUG 37761 = CIP 105775 = DSM 44163 = JCM 13391 = NCTC 11298.
