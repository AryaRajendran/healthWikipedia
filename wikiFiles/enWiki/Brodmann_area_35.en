'''Brodmann area 35''', together with [[Brodmann area 36]], is most frequently referred to as [[perirhinal cortex]].

==Human== 
This area is known as '''perirhinal area 35'''. It is a subdivision of the [[cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitecturally]] defined [[hippocampal region]] of the [[cerebral cortex]]. In the human it is located along the [[rhinal sulcus]]. Cytoarchitectually it is bounded medially by the [[entorhinal area 28]] and laterally by the [[ectorhinal area 36]] (H).

==Monkey==
Brodmann found a cytoarchitecturally [[homology (biology)|homologous]] area in the monkey ([[Cercopithecus]]), but it was so weakly developed that he omitted it from the cortical map of that species (Brodmann-1909).
