'''Anti-inflammatory''' refers to the property of a substance or treatment that reduces [[inflammation]]. Anti-inflammatory drugs make up about half of [[analgesics]], remedying pain by reducing inflammation as opposed to [[opioids]], which affect the [[central nervous system]].

==Medications==
===Steroids===
Many [[steroid]]s, to be specific [[glucocorticoid]]s, reduce inflammation or swelling by binding to glucocorticoid [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]. These drugs are often referred to as [[corticosteroid]]s.

===Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs===
[[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), alleviate pain by counteracting the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX) enzyme. On its own, COX enzyme synthesizes [[prostaglandins]], creating inflammation. In whole, the NSAIDs prevent the prostaglandins from ever being synthesized, reducing or eliminating the pain.

Some common examples of NSAIDs are: [[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], and [[naproxen]]. The newer specific COX-inhibitors - although, it is presumed, sharing a similar mode of action - are not classified together with the traditional NSAIDs.

On the other hand, there are [[analgesic]]s that are commonly associated with anti-inflammatory drugs but that have no anti-inflammatory effects. An example is [[paracetamol]], called [[acetaminophen]] in the U.S. and sold under the brand name of [[Tylenol]].  As opposed to NSAIDs, which reduce pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes, paracetamol has recently been shown to block the reuptake of [[endocannabinoids]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ottani|first=Alessandra|coauthors=Leone, Sheila; Sandrini, Maurizio; Ferrari, Anna; Bertolini, Alfio|title=The analgesic activity of paracetamol is prevented by the blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=February 15, 2006|volume=531|pages=280–281|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.12.015|pmid=16438952}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dani|first=Mélina|coauthors=Guindon, Josée; Lambert, Chantal; Beaulieu, Pierre|title=The local antinociceptive effects of paracetamol in neuropathic pain are mediated by cannabinoid receptors|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=November 14, 2007|volume=573|pages=214–215|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.07.012|pmid=17651722}}</ref> which only reduces pain, likely explaining why it has minimal effect on inflammation.  

Long-term use of NSAIDs can cause gastric erosions, which can become [[stomach ulcers]] and in extreme cases can cause severe haemorrhage, resulting in death. The risk of death as a result of use of NSAIDs is 1 in 12,000 for adults aged 16–45.<ref name=Bandolier>{{cite web|title=Table 7|url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/painpag/nsae/nsae.html#Heading20|work=NSAIDs and adverse effects|publisher=Bandolier|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref> The risk increases almost twentyfold for those over 75.<ref name=Bandolier /> Other dangers of NSAIDs are exacerbating asthma and causing kidney damage.<ref name=Bandolier /> Apart from aspirin, prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs also increase the risk of [[myocardial infarction]] and stroke.<ref name=BMJ2011>{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.c7086|last=Trelle|first=Sven|coauthors=Reichenbach, Stephan; Wandel, Simon; Hildebrand, Pius; Tschannen, Beatrice; Villiger, Peter M.; Egger, Matthias; Jüni, Peter|title=Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis|journal=British Medical Journal (Clinical research ed.)|date=11 January 2011|volume=342|pages=c7086|pmid=21224324|pmc=3019238}}</ref>

===Immune Selective Anti-Inflammatory Derivatives (ImSAIDs)===
[[Immune-selective anti-inflammatory derivative|ImSAIDs]] are a class of [[peptides]] being developed by [[IMULAN BioTherapeutics, LLC]], which were discovered to have diverse biological properties, including anti-inflammatory properties.  ImSAIDs work by altering the activation and migration of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] cells, which are [[immune]] cells responsible for amplifying the inflammatory response.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bao|first=F.|coauthors=John, S.M.; Chen, Y.; Mathison, R.D.; Weaver, L.C.|title=The tripeptide phenylalanine-(d) glutamate-(d) glycine modulates leukocyte infiltration and oxidative damage in rat injured spinal cord|journal=Neuroscience|year=2006|volume=140|issue=3|pages=1011–1022|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.02.061|pmid=16581192}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathison|first=Ronald D.|coauthors=Befus, A.

The ImSAIDs were discovered by scientists evaluating biological properties of the [[submandibular gland]] and [[saliva]]. Early work in this area demonstrated that the submandibular gland released a host of factors that regulate systemic inflammatory responses and modulate systemic immune and inflammatory reactions. It is now well accepted that the immune, nervous, and [[endocrine]] systems communicate and interact to control and modulate [[inflammation]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] repair. One of the neuroendocrine pathways, when activated, results in the release of immune-regulating peptides from the submandibular gland upon neuronal stimulation from [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] nerves. This pathway or communication is referred to as the cervical sympathetic trunk-submandibular gland (CST-SMG) axis, a regulatory system that plays a role in the systemic control of inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathison|first=R.|coauthors=Davison, J.S.; Befus, A.D.|title=Neuroendocrine regulation of inflammation and tissue repair by submandibular gland factors|journal=Immunology Today|year=1994|month=November|volume=15|issue=11|pages=527–532|doi=10.1016/0167-5699(94)90209-7|pmid=7802923}}</ref>

Early work in identifying factors that played a role in the CST-SMG axis lead to the discovery of a seven [[amino acid]] [[peptide]], called the submandibular gland peptide-T. SGP-T was demonstrated to have biological activity and thermoregulatory properties related to [[endotoxin]] exposure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathison|first=Ronald D.|coauthors=Malkinson, Terrance; Cooper, K.E.; Davison, J.S.|title=Submandibular glands: novel structures participating in thermoregulatory responses|journal=Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology|year=1997|volume=75|issue=5|pages=407–413|doi=10.1139/y97-077|pmid=9250374}}</ref> SGP-T, an isolate of the submandibular gland, demonstrated its immunoregulatory properties and potential role in modulating the cervical sympathetic trunk-submandibular gland (CST-SMG) axis, and subsequently was shown to play an important role in the control of inflammation.

One SGP-T derivative is a three-amino acid sequence shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory [[molecule]] with systemic effects. This three-amino acid peptide is [[phenylalanine]]-[[glutamine]]-[[glycine]] (FEG) and its D-[[isomer]]ic form (feG) have become the foundation for the ImSAID category.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dery|first=R.E.|coauthors=Mathison, R.; Davison, J.; Befus; A.D.|title=Inhibition of allergic inflammation by C-terminal peptides of the prohormone submandibular rat 1 (SMR-1)|journal=International archives of allergy and immunology|year=2001|volume=124|issue=1-3|pages=201-024|doi=10.1159/000053710|pmid=11306968}}</ref> Cellular Effects of feG: The cellular effects of the ImSAIDs are characterized in a number of publications. feG and related peptides are known to modulate leukocyte (white blood cells) activity by influencing cell surface receptors to inhibit excessive activation and tissue infiltration.

==Ice treatment==
Applying [[ice]], or even cool water, to a tissue injury has an anti-inflammatory effect and is often suggested as an injury treatment and [[pain management]] technique for athletes.  One common approach is [[RICE (medicine)|Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation]].  Cool temperatures inhibit local blood circulation, which reduces swelling in the injured tissue.

==Health supplements==
In addition to medical drugs, some herbs and health supplements have anti-inflammatory qualities, including [[Harpagophytum|devil's claw]] (''Harpagophytum procumbens''), [[hyssop]], [[ginger]] (''Zingiber officinale''), [[turmeric]] (''Curcuma longa''), [[Arnica montana]] (containing [[helenalin]]), and [[willow|willow bark]] (containing [[salicylic acid]]). Other anti-inflammatory dietary sources include [[pomegranate]] (''Punica granatum''), [[green tea]] (''Camellia sinensis''), [[cat's claw]] (''Uncaria tometosa'' and ''Uncaria guianensis''), [[boswellia serrata|Indian olibaum]] (''Boswelia serrata''), and [[pineapple]] [[bromelain]] (''Ananas comosus'').<ref>{{Cite pmid|22850529 }}</ref> Cannabichromene, a [[cannabinoid]], also has anti-inflammatory effect. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Carlton, E.|coauthors=Elsohly, Mahmoud A.|title=Biological activity of cannabichromene, its homologs and isomers|journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|year=1981|volume=21|issue=8-9 Supplement|pages=283S-291S|pmid=7298870|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/crl/pain/Turner%20&%20Elsohly%2081Cannabichromene_%20JClinPharmacol.pdf|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref> [[Honokiol]] inhibits platelet aggregation, and works as an inverse agonist at the [[cannabinoid|CB2]] receptor.

==Anti-inflammatory foods==
[[Prostaglandins]] are hormone-like substances that affect the body in variety of ways, also regulating inflammatory mediation. An anti-flammatory diet includes less foods that create inflammation-causing prostaglandins (PGE2) in the body, and more foods that create anti-flammatory prostaglandins (PGE1 and PGE3). <ref>{{cite web|title=Inflammation|url=http://apps.scco.edu/ceonline/courseview.asp?selclassid=13&selID=116&selOrderID=8|publisher=Southern California College of Optometry|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref> 

Suggested diets to prevent inflammation include those rich in vegetables and low in simple [[carbohydrates]] and fats, such as [[saturated fats]] and [[trans fats]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Weil’s Anti-Inflammatory Food Pyramid|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/ecs/pyramid/press-foodpyramid.html|publisher=Dr Weil|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref> Anti-inflammatory foods include most colorful fruits and vegetables, [[oily fish]] (which contain higher levels of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s), nuts, seeds, and certain spices, such as [[ginger]].
