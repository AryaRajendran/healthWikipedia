They may also occur on the [[face]], usually on the [[eyelid]]s. Acrochorda are harmless and typically painless, and do not grow or change over time {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}.  Though tags up to a half-inch long have been seen,<ref name=MedlinePlus>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/article/000848.htm "Cutaneous skin tag"]. Medline Plus.

The surface of an acrochordon may be smooth or irregular in appearance and is often raised from the surface of the skin on a fleshy stalk called a [[Peduncle (zoology)|peduncle]]. [[Microscope|Microscopically]], an acrochordon consists of a fibro-[[Vascular tissue|vascular]] core, sometimes also with [[fat cell]]s, covered by an unremarkable [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. However, tags may become irritated by [[shaving]], [[clothing]] or [[jewelry]].

It is believed that skin tags occur from skin rubbing up against skin, since they are so often found in skin creases and folds.<ref name="MedlinePlus" /> Studies have shown existence of low-risk [[HPV]] 6 and 11 in skin tags hinting at a possible role in its [[pathogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta S, Aggarwal R, Gupta S, Arora SK. |title=Human papillomavirus and skin tags: Is there any association?|journal=Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol |volume=74|pages= 222–5|year= 2008|url=http://www.ijdvl.com/text.asp?2008/74/3/222/39585}}</ref> Acrochorda have been reported to have a [[prevalence]] of 46% in the general population.<ref name="emedicine 606">[http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic606.htm "Acrochordon "].

==Treatment==
Because tags are benign, treatment is unnecessary unless the tags become frequently irritated or present a cosmetic concern. If removal is desired or warranted, a [[dermatologist]], [[general practitioner]], or similarly trained professional may use [[cauterization]], [[cryosurgery]], [[excision]], or [[surgical ligation]] to remove the acrochorda.<ref name="MedlinePlus"/>
