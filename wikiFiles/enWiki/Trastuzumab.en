'''Trastuzumab''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; trade names '''Herclon''', '''Herceptin''') is a [[monoclonal antibody]] that interferes with the [[HER2/neu]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]. Its main use is to treat certain breast cancers.

The HER receptors are proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane and communicate molecular signals from outside the cell (molecules called [[Epidermal growth factor|EGFs]]) to inside the cell, and turn genes on and off. The HER proteins stimulate cell proliferation. In some cancers, notably certain types of breast cancer, HER2 is over-expressed, and causes cancer cells to reproduce uncontrollably.<ref name="Hudis_2007">{{cite journal | first=CA | last=Hudis | title=Trastuzumab--mechanism of action and use in clinical practice | journal=N Engl J Med. | year=2007 | pmid=17611206 | volume=357 | issue=1 | pages=39–51 | doi=10.1056/NEJMra043186 }} [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/1/39 Jul 5;357(1):39-51.

It is possible to determine the "erbB2 status" of a tumor, which can be used to predict efficacy of treatment with trastuzumab. If it is determined that a tumor is overexpressing the erbB2 oncogene and the patient has no significant pre-existing heart disease, then a patient is eligible for treatment with trastuzumab.<ref name="YuHung">{{cite journal | first=D | last=Yu | coauthors=Hung M | title=Overexpression of ErbB2 in cancer and ErbB2-targeting strategies | journal=Oncogene | year=2000 | volume=19 | pages=6115–6121 | pmid=11156524 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1203972 | issue=53}}</ref> It is surprising that although trastuzumab has great affinity for HER2 and high doses can be administered (due to its low toxicity), 70% of HER2+ patients do not respond to treatment. In fact resistance to the treatment develops rapidly, in virtually all patients. It is suggested that a mechanism of resistance is the lack of p27Kip1 translocation to the nucleus in some strains of cancer, enabling cdk2 to induce cell proliferation.<ref name="Kute"/>

==Adverse effects==

One of the significant complications of trastuzumab is its effect on the heart.  Trastuzumab is associated with cardiac dysfunction in 2-7% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1200/JCO.20.5.1215|author= Seidman, A, et al.|title=Cardiac Dysfunction in the Trastuzumab Clinical Trials Experience |journal= Journal of Clinical Oncology|volume=20|pages=1215–1221|year=2002 |pmid=11870163|issue= 5}}</ref>  As a result, regular cardiac screening with either a [[MUGA scan]] or [[echocardiography]] is commonly undertaken during the trastuzumab treatment period.

Trastuzumab downregulates neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), which is essential for the activation of cell survival pathways in cardiomyocytes and the maintenance of cardiac function. NRG-1 activates the MAPK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as focal adhesion kinases (FAK). These are all significant for the function and structure of cardiomyocytes. Trastuzumab can therefore lead to cardiac dysfunction.<ref>Zeglinski, M., Ludke, A., Jassal, D. S. & Singal, P. K. Trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction: A 'dual-hit'. Exp. Clin. Cardiol. 16, 70-74 (2011)</ref>

Approximately 10% of patients are unable to tolerate this drug because of pre-existing heart problems; physicians are balancing the risk of recurrent cancer against the higher risk of death due to cardiac disease in this population.  The risk of [[cardiomyopathy]] is increased when trastuzumab is combined with [[anthracycline]]chemotherapy (which itself is associated with cardiac toxicity).

If Herclon is used with a mixed dosage of Penicillin it can have side effects like numbness of the finger tips, cramps in the stomach. Also there might be a shock kind of sensation in the body. The body might get cold while the dosage is going on and the nerve through which it is being given would be warm. Your doctor would be informing you this prior to the dosage and would also get a MOU signed from you stating that you are aware about the effects of the mixed dosage.
==Mechanism of action==

The HER2 gene (also known as HER2/neu and ErbB2 gene) is amplified in 20-30% of early-stage [[breast cancer]]s, which makes it overexpress [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF) receptors in the cell membrane.<ref name="Bange">{{cite journal | first=J | last=Bange | coauthors=Zwick E, Ullrich A. | title=Molecular targets for breast cancer therapy and prevention | journal=Nature Medicine | year=2001 | volume=7 |pages=548–552 | pmid=11329054 | doi=10.1038/87872 | issue=5}}</ref> In some types of cancer HER2 may send signals without growth factors arriving and binding to the receptor, making its effect in the cell constitutive; however, trastuzumab is not effective in this case.

The HER2 pathway promotes cell growth and division when it is functioning normally; however when it is overexpressed, cell growth accelerates beyond its normal limits. In some types of cancer the pathway is exploited to promote rapid cell growth and proliferation and hence tumor formation.<ref name="cancer">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/targetedtherapies/breastcancer_htmlcourse/page3|title=Targeted Therapies for Breast Cancer Tutorial|work=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref>  The EGF pathway includes the receptors HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3, and HER4; the binding of EGF to HER is required to activate the pathway.<ref name="cancer" />  The pathway initiates the MAP Kinase pathway as well as the PI3 Kinase/AKT pathway, which in turn activates the NF-κB pathway.<ref name=Feldman>{{cite journal|last=Feldman|first=A M|coauthors=Koch, W J; Force, T L|title=Developing Strategies to Link Basic Cardiovascular Sciences with Clinical Drug Development: Another Opportunity for Translational Sciences|journal=Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics|date=28 March 2007|volume=81|issue=6|pages=887–892|doi=10.1038/sj.clpt.6100160|accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref>  In cancer cells the HER2 protein can be expressed up to 100 times more than in normal cells (2 million versus 20,000 per cell).<ref>{{cite web|last=Winer|first=Eric|title=HER2 Disease in the Metastatic and Adjuvant Settings|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/557474|work=Medscape Education|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref>  This overexpression leads to strong and constant proliferative signaling and hence tumor formation. Overexpression of HER2 also causes deactivation of checkpoints, allowing for even greater increases in proliferation.

HER2 extends across the cell membrane, and carries signals from outside the cell to the inside. Signaling compounds called [[mitogens]] (specifically EGF in this case) arrive at the cell membrane, and bind to the extracellular domain of the HER family of receptors. Those bound proteins then link ([[protein dimer|dimerize]]), activating the receptor. HER2 sends a signal from its intracellular domain, activating several different biochemical pathways. These include the [[PI3K]]/[[AKT|Akt]] pathway and the [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAPK]] pathway. Signals on these pathways promote cell proliferation and the growth of blood vessels to nourish the tumor ([[angiogenesis]]).<ref name="Menard">{{cite journal | first=S | last=Ménard | coauthors=Pupa SM, Campiglio M,  Tagliabue E | title=Biologic and therapeutic role of HER2 in cancer | journal=Oncogene | year=2003 | volume=22 | pages=6570–6578 | pmid=14528282 | doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1206779 | issue=42}}</ref>

Normal cell division -  [[mitosis]] - has checkpoints that keep cell division under control. Some of the proteins that control this cycle are called [[Cyclin-dependent kinases|cdk2]] (CDKs). Overexpression of HER2 sidesteps these checkpoints, causing cells to proliferate in an uncontrolled fashion.<ref name="Kute">{{cite journal | first=T | last=Kute | coauthors=Lack CM, Willingham M, Bishwokama B, Williams H, Barrett K, Mitchell T, Vaughn JP | title=Development of Herceptin resistance in breast cancer cells | journal=Cytometry | year=2004 | volume=57A | pages=86–93 | pmid=14750129 | doi=10.1002/cyto.a.10095 | issue=2}}</ref> This is caused by phosphorylation by Akt.

Trastuzumab binds to domain IV of the<ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6924/full/nature01392.html</ref> extracellular segment of the HER2/neu receptor. Cells treated with trastuzumab undergo arrest during the G1 phase of the [[cell cycle]] so there is reduced proliferation. It has been suggested that trastuzumab induces some of its effect by [[downregulation]] of HER2/neu leading to disruption of receptor dimerization and signaling through the downstream PI3K cascade.<ref name="Kute"/> In addition, trastuzumab suppresses [[angiogenesis]] both by induction of antiangiogenic factors and repression of proangiogenic factors. It is thought that a contribution to the unregulated growth observed in cancer could be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2/neu that results in the release of the extracellular domain. Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells.<ref name="Albenall">{{cite journal | first=J | last=Albanell | coauthors=Codony J, Rovira A, Mellado B, Gascon P. | title=Mechanism of action of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies: scientific update on trastuzumab and 2C4 | journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | year=2003 | volume=532 | pages=253–268 | pmid=12908564 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-0081-0_21 | series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | isbn=978-0-306-47762-1}}</ref>

Experiments in laboratory animals indicate that antibodies, including trastuzumab, when bound to a cell, induce immune cells to kill that cell, and that such [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] is another important mechanism of action.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Inhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytoxicity against tumor targets | last1=Clynes | first1=RA | last2=Towers |first2=TL | last3=Presta | first3=LG | last4=Ravetch | first4=JV | journal=Nat Med | year=2000 | volume=6 | issue=4 | pages=443–6 | pmid=10742152 | doi=10.1038/74704}}</ref>

There may be other undiscovered mechanisms by which trastuzumab induces regression in cancer.

==Predicting response to therapy==

Trastuzumab inhibits the effects of overexpression of HER2. If the breast cancer doesn't overexpress HER2, trastuzumab will have no beneficial effect (and may cause harm).  Doctors use laboratory tests to discover whether HER2 is overexpressed. In the routine [[clinical laboratory]], the most commonly employed methods for this are [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) and either silver, chromogenic or fluorescent [[in situ hybridisation]] (SISH/CISH/FISH). HER2 amplification can be detected by [[Virtual Karyotype|virtual karyotyping]] of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor. Virtual karyotyping has the added advantage of assessing copy number changes throughout the genome, in addition to detecting HER-2 amplification (but not overexpression). Numerous [[PCR]]-based methodologies have also been described in the literature.<ref name="Jennings">{{cite journal | first=B | last=Jennings | coauthors=Hadfield JE, Worsley SD, Girling A, Willis G. | title=A differential PCR assay for the detection of c-erbB 2 amplification used in a prospective study of breast cancer. | journal=Molecular Pathology | year=1997 | volume=50 |pages=254–256 | pmid=9497915 | doi=10.1136/mp.50.5.254 | issue=5}}</ref>

There are two FDA-approved commercial kits available for HER2 IHC; Dako HercepTest <ref>http://www.dakousa.com/index/prod_search/prod_baseproducts.htm?productareaid=1&productgroupid=3&productsubgroupid=1003000</ref> and [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]] Pathway [http://www.ventanamed.com/]. These are highly standardised, semi-quantitative assays which stratify expression levels into; 0 (<20,000 receptors per cell, no visible expression), 1+ (~100,000 receptors per cell, partial membrane staining, < 10% of cells overexpressing HER-2), 2+ (~500,000 receptors per cell, light to moderate complete membrane staining, > 10% of cells overexpressing HER-2), and 3+ (~2,000,000 receptors per cell, strong complete membrane staining, > 10% of cells overexpressing HER-2). The presence of cytoplasmic expression is disregarded. Treatment with trastuzumab is indicated in cases where HER2 expression has a score of 3+. However, IHC has been shown to have numerous limitations, both technical and interpretative, which have been found to impact on the reproducibility and accuracy of results, especially when compared with ISH methodologies. It is also true, however, that some reports have stated that IHC provides excellent correlation between gene copy number and protein expression.

[[Fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) is viewed as being the “gold standard” technique in identifying patients who would benefit from trastuzumab, but it is expensive and requires fluorescence microscopy and an image capture system. The main expense involved with CISH is in the purchase of FDA-approved kits, and as it is not a fluorescent technique it does not require specialist microscopy and slides may be kept permanently. Comparative studies of CISH and FISH have shown that these two techniques show excellent correlation. The lack of a separate chromosome 17 probe on the same section is an issue with regards to acceptance of CISH.  As of June 2011 Roche has obtained FDA approval for the INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe cocktail <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/article/711287/Ventana-Medical-Systems-Inc-Receives-Fda-Approval-For-The-First-Fully-Automated.html |title=Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. Receives FDA Approval for the First Fully Automated Diagnostic Assay for HER2 Gene Status Determination in Breast Cancer Patients |publisher=BioPortfolio.com |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> developed by [[Ventana Medical Systems]] [http://www.ventanamed.com/].  The DDISH (Dual-chromagen/Dual-hapten In-situ hybridization) cocktail uses both HER2 and Chromosome 17 hybridization probes for chromagenic visualization on the same tissue section.  The detection can be achieved by using a combination of ultraView SISH(silver in-situ hybridization) and ultraView Red ISH for deposition of distinct chromgenic precipitates at the site of DNP or DIG labeled probes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asco.org/ascov2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=70&abstractID=40271 |title=Dual color dual hapten HER2 genotyping for breast biopsy specimens (DDISH): Concordance with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) |publisher=ASCO |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> 

Currently the recommended assays are a combination of IHC and FISH, whereby IHC scores of 0 and 1+ are negative (no trastuzumab treatment), scores of 3+ are positive (trastuzumab treatment), and score of 2+ (equivocal case) is referred to FISH for a definitive treatment decision. Industry best practices indicate the use of FDA-cleared [[Automated Tissue Image Systems]] by laboratories for automated processing of specimens, thereby reducing process variability, avoiding equivocal cases, and ensuring maximjum efficacy of trastuzumab therapy.

==Optimal duration of adjuvant trastuzumab==
The optimal duration of adjuvant trastuzumab is currently unknown.  One year of treatment is generally accepted as the optimum length of therapy based on current clinical trial evidence that demonstrated the superiority of one year treatment over none.<ref name="Romond">{{cite journal | first=EH | last=Romond | coauthors=Perez EA, Bryant J, et al. |title=Trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy for operable HER2-positive breast cancer | journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] | year=2005 | volume=353 | pages=1673–1684 | pmid=16236738 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052122 |issue=16}}</ref><ref name="Piccart">{{cite journal | first=MJ | last=Piccart-Gebhart MJ | coauthors=Procter M, Leyland-Jones B, et al. | title=Trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] | year=2005 | volume=353 | pages=1659–1672 | pmid=16236737 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052306 | issue=16}}</ref> However, a small Finnish trial also showed similar improvement with nine weeks of treatment over no therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Joensuu H, Kellokumpu-Lehtinen PL, Bono P ''et al.'' |title=Adjuvant docetaxel or vinorelbine with or without trastuzumab for breast cancer |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=8|pages=809–20 |year=2006 |pmid=16495393|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053028}}</ref>  Due to the lack of direct head-to-head comparison in clinical trials, it is unknown whether a shorter duration of treatment may be just as effective (with fewer side effects) than the currently accepted practice of treatment for one year.

==History==
The biotech company [[Genentech]] developed trastuzumab jointly with [[UCLA]] and gained FDA approval in September 1998. The drug was first discovered by scientists including Dr. [[Axel Ullrich]] and Dr. [[H. Michael Shepard]]. At [[UCLA]]'s  [http://www.cancer.ucla.edu/ Jonsson Cancer Center], Dr. [[Dennis Slamon]] subsequently worked on trastuzumab's development. A book about Dr. Slamon's work was made into a television film called ''[[Living Proof (film)|Living Proof]]'', that premiered in 2008.

==Costs==
