'''Freewheelers Emergency Voluntary Service''' (EVS) is a [[blood bikes]] group based in [[South West England]]. The charity was founded in [[Weston-super-Mare]] in 1990.<ref name=cc /><ref name=bep2009/>
It owns and operates a fleet of [[BMW R1200RT]] and [[Honda ST1300|Honda Pan-European]] [[motorcycle]]s fitted with [[blues and twos|blue lights and sirens]], which are ridden by [[volunteer]]s, to provide a free-of-charge emergency [[Motorcycle courier|courier service]] to local hospitals.

Freewheelers EVS have helped a number of similar groups to start up in England, including White Knights EVS in [[West Yorkshire]].<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2008/02/07/emergency-dispatch-86081-20444638/ | title= Emergency Dispatch! | publisher= The Huddersfield Daily Examiner | date= 7 February 2008 | first= David | last= Himelfield | accessdate= 17 January 2009}}</ref> Neighbouring groups include [[Severn Freewheelers]],<ref>{{cite web | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/gloucestershire/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8232000/8232118.stm | publisher= BBC Gloucestershire | date= 2 September 2009 | title= Charity works nights for the NHS | accessdate= 7 July 2010}}</ref>
