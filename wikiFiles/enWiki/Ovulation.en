'''Ovulation''' is the phase of a female's [[menstrual cycle]] in which a mature egg is released from the [[ovarian follicles]] into the [[oviduct]].<ref>[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center. Retrieved July 2, 2011</ref> After ovulation, during the [[luteal phase]], the egg will be available to be [[fertilized]] by [[sperm]]. Concomitantly, the lining of the [[uterus]] (the ''[[endometrium]]'') is thickened to be able to receive a fertilized egg. If no conception occurs, the uterine lining as well as blood will be shed during [[menstruation]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Young, Barbara|title=Wheater's Functional Histology: A Text and Colour Atlas|edition=5th|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2006|isbn=9780443068508|page=359|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=88tla60sHAUC&pg=PA359}}</ref>

==Ovulation in humans==
[[File:MenstrualCycle2 en.svg|thumb|right|350px|Ovulation occurs about midway through the [[menstrual cycle]], after the [[follicular phase]], and is followed by the [[luteal phase]]. Note that ovulation is characterized by a sharp spike in levels of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), resulting from the peak of [[estrogen]] levels during the follicular phase.]]

In [[humans]], ovulation occurs about midway through the [[menstrual cycle]], after the [[follicular phase]]. The few days surrounding ovulation (from approximately days 10 to 18 of a 28 day cycle), constitute the most fertile phase.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chaudhuri, S.K.|chapter=Natural Methods of Contraception|title=Practice of Fertility Control: A Comprehensive Manual, 7/e|publisher=Elsevier India|year=2007|isbn=9788131211502|page=49|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pzanxKlcU74C&pg=PA49}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Allen, Denise|title=Managing Motherhood, Managing Risk: Fertility and Danger in West Central Tanzania|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2004|isbn=9780472030279|pages=132-133|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6nMTD4bZmYgC&pg=PA132}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rosenthal, Martha|title=Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9780618755714|page=322|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&pg=PT322}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editors=Nichter, Mark; Nichter, Mimi|title=Anthropology & International Health: South Asian Case Studies|authors=Nichter, Mark; Nichter, Mimi|chapter=Cultural Notions of Fertility in South Asia and Their Influence on Sri Lankan Family Planning Practices|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1996|isbn=9782884491716|pages=8-11|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wWBEhhMPUUcC&pg=PA8}}</ref> The time from the beginning of the [[last menstrual period]] (LMP) until ovulation is, on average, 14.6<ref name=Geirsson2003>{{cite doi|10.1046/j.1469-0705.1991.01030212.x}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1469-0705.1991.01030212.x/pdf]</ref> days, but with substantial variation between women and between cycles in any single woman, with an overall 95% [[prediction interval]] of 8.2 to 20.5<ref name=Geirsson2003/> days.

The process of ovulation is controlled by the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the [[Anterior pituitary|anterior lobe]] of the [[pituitary gland]], [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). In the [[pre-ovulatory]] phase of the [[menstrual cycle]], the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called  cumulus expansion, which is stimulated by FSH. After this is done, a hole called the [[Stigma (anatomy)|stigma]] will form in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]], and the ovum will leave the  follicle through this hole. Ovulation is triggered by a spike in the  amount of FSH and LH released from the pituitary gland. During the [[luteal phase|luteal (post-ovulatory) phase]], the ovum will travel through the [[fallopian tubes]] toward the [[uterus]]. If [[fertilized]] by a [[sperm]], it may perform [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] there 6–12 days  later.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

===Follicular phase===
{{See also|Folliculogenesis}}
The [[follicular phase]] (or proliferative phase) is the phase of the menstrual cycle during which the [[ovarian follicles]] mature. The follicular phase lasts from the beginning of [[menstruation]] to the start of ovulation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Littleton, Lynna A. & Engebretson, Joan C.|title=Maternity Nursing Care|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=9781401811921|page=195|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nondhCqicAAC&pg=PA195}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Gupta, Ramesh C.|title=Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology|publisher=Academic Press|year=2011|isbn=9780123820334|page=22|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jGHRR32wz5MC&pg=PA22}}</ref>

For ovulation to be successful, the ovum must be supported by the corona radiata and cumulus oophorous granulosa cells. The latter undergo a period of proliferation and mucification known as cumulus expansion. Mucification is the secretion of a [[hyaluronic acid]]-rich cocktail that disperses and gathers the cumulus cell network in a sticky matrix around the ovum. This network stays with the ovum after ovulation and has been shown to be necessary for fertilization.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

An increase in cumulus cell number causes a concomitant increase in antrum fluid volume that can swell the follicle to over 20&nbsp;mm in diameter. It forms a pronounced bulge at the surface of the ovary called the blister.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

===Ovulation===
Estrogen levels peak towards the end of the follicular phase, which causes a surge in levels of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). This lasts from 24 to 36 hours, and results in the rupture of the ovarian follicles, causing the egg to be released from the ovary via the oviduct.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Watson, Stephanie & Stacy, Kelli Miller|chapter=The Endocrine System|editor=McDowell, Julie|title=Encyclopedia of Human Body Systems|publisher=Greenwood|year=2010|isbn=9780313391750|pages=201-202|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7tt1C1aJ0G4C&pg=PA201}}</ref> 

Through a signal transduction cascade initiated by LH, [[peptidase|proteolytic enzymes]] are secreted by the follicle that degrade the follicular tissue at the site of the blister, forming a hole called the ''stigma''. The [[cumulus-oocyte complex]] (COC) leaves the ruptured  follicle and moves out into the [[peritoneal cavity]] through the stigma, where it is caught by the [[Fimbria (female reproductive system)|fimbriae]] at the end of the [[fallopian tube]] (also called the oviduct). After entering the oviduct, the ovum-cumulus complex is pushed along by [[cilia]], beginning its journey toward the [[uterus]].{{cn|date=February 2013}}

By this time, the oocyte has completed [[meiosis|meiosis I]], yielding two cells: the larger [[ovum|secondary oocyte]] that contains all of the cytoplasmic material and a smaller, inactive first polar body. [[meiosis|Meiosis II]] follows at once but will be arrested in the [[metaphase]] and will so remain until fertilization. The [[spindle apparatus]] of the second meiotic division appears at the time of ovulation. If no fertilization occurs, the oocyte will degenerate approximately 24 hours after ovulation.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

The [[mucous membrane]]  of the [[uterus]], termed the functionalis, has reached its maximum size, and so have the [[endometrial]] glands, although they are still non-[[secretion|secretory]].{{cn|date=February 2013}}

===Luteal  phase===
{{Main|Luteal phase}}
The follicle proper has met  the end of its lifespan. Without the ovum, the follicle folds inward on  itself, transforming into the [[corpus luteum]] (pl. corpora lutea), a  steroidogenic cluster of cells that produces [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]]. These hormones induce the  endometrial glands to begin production of the [[endometrium|proliferative endometrium]] and later  into [[endometrium|secretory endometrium]], the site of embryonic growth if  [[human fertilization|fertilization]] occurs. The action of progesterone increases [[basal body temperature]] by one-quarter to one-half degree  Celsius (one-half  to one degree Fahrenheit).  The corpus luteum continues this paracrine  action for the remainder of the menstrual cycle, maintaining the  endometrium, before disintegrating into scar tissue during menses.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

==Clinical  presentation==
{{further|Concealed ovulation|Fertility  awareness|Mittelschmerz}}
The start of ovulation can be detected by signs. Because the signs are not readily discernible by people other than the woman herself, humans are said to have a [[concealed ovulation]]. In many animal species there are distinctive signals indicating the period when the female is fertile. Several explanations have been proposed to explain concealed ovulation in humans.

Women near ovulation  experience changes in the [[cervix]],  in mucus produced by the cervix, and in their [[basal body temperature]]. Furthermore, many women experience secondary fertility signs  including [[Mittelschmerz]] (pain associated with ovulation) and a heightened sense of [[olfaction|smell]], and can sense the precise moment of ovulation.<ref>{{cite  journal | last = Navarrete-Palacios | first = E  |  coauthors =  Hudson R, Reyes-Guerrero G et al. | title =  Lower olfactory threshold during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual  cycle. | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 63  | issue  = 3 | pages = 269–279 | month = July | year = 2003 | pmid = 12853171 | doi =  10.1016/S0301-0511(03)00076-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor=Beckmann, Charles R.B.|title=Obstetrics and Gynecology|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2010|isbn=9780781788076|pages=306-307|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0flWgd3OJLEC&pg=PA306}}</ref>

Symptoms related to the onset of ovulation, the moment of ovulation and the body's process of beginning and ending the menstrual cycle vary in intensity with each woman but are fundamentally the same. The charting of such symptoms &mdash; primarily basal body temperature, Mittelschmerz and cervical position &mdash; is referred to as the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness, which allow auto-diagnosis by a woman of her state of ovulation. Once training has been given by a suitable authority, [http://download-fertility-charts.com/download-fertility-charts fertility charts] can be completed on a cycle-by-cycle basis to show ovulation. This gives the possibility of using the data to predict fertility for natural contraception and pregnancy planning.

==Disorders==
Disorders of ovulation are classified as [[menstrual disorder]]s and include oligoovulation and anovulation:
*Oligoovulation is infrequent or irregular ovulation (usually defined as cycles of ≥36 days or <8 cycles a year)
*[[Anovulation]] is absence of ovulation when it would be normally expected (in a post-[[menarche|menarchal]], premenopausal woman).  Anovulation usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. Anovulation can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding ([[dysfunctional uterine bleeding]]).

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has developed the following classification of ovulatory disorders:<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=fh2hJDiLOyAC&pg=PA54 Page 54] in: {{cite book |author=Guillebaud, John; Enda McVeigh; Roy Homburg |title=Oxford handbook of reproductive medicine and family planning |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-19-920380-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
*WHO group I: [[Hypothalamic–pituitary-gonadal axis]] failure
*WHO group II: Hypothalamic–pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction. WHO group II is the most common cause of ovulatory disorders, and the most common causative member is [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms019}}</ref>
*WHO group III: [[Ovarian failure]]
*WHO group IV: [[Hyperprolactinemia]]

==Induction and  suppression==
===Induced ovulation===
{{Main|Ovulation induction}}
Ovulation  induction is a promising [[assisted reproductive technology]] for patients with conditions such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS)  and [[oligomenorrhea]]. It is also used in [[in vitro fertilization]] to make the follicles mature before [[egg retrieval]]. Usually, [[ovarian stimulation]] is used in conjunction with ''ovulation induction'' to stimulate the formation of multiple oocytes.<ref name=ivf.com/> Some sources<ref name=ivf.com/> include ovulation induction in the definition of ''ovarian stimulation''.

A low dose of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (HCG) may be injected after completed ovarian stimulation. Ovulation will occur between 24–36 hours after the HCG injection.<ref name=ivf.com>[http://www.ivf.com/ovind.html IVF.com > Ovulation Induction] Retrieved on Mars 7, 2010</ref>

===Suppressed ovulation===
[[Contraception]] can be achieved by suppressing the ovulation.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

The majority of [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]] and conception boosters focus on the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle because it is the most important determinant of fertility. Hormone therapy can positively or negatively interfere with ovulation and can give a sense of cycle control to the woman.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

Estradiol and  progesterone, taken in various forms including [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s, mimics the hormonal levels of  the menstrual cycle and engage in negative feedback of folliculogenesis  and ovulation.{{cn|date=February 2013}}
