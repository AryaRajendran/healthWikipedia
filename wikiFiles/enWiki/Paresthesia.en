'''Paresthesia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ɨ|s|ˈ|θ|iː|z|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ɨ|s|ˈ|θ|iː|ʒ|ə}}), is a sensation of tickling, tingling, burning, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin with no apparent long-term physical effect. It is more generally known as the feeling of "'''pins and needles'''" or of a limb "falling asleep". The manifestation of paresthesia may be transient or chronic.

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary|paresthesia}}
[[Greek language|Greek]] ''para'' ("beside", ''i.e.'', abnormal) and ''aisthesia'' ("sensation").

==Cause==
===Transient===
Paresthesias of the hands and feet are common, transient symptoms of the related conditions of [[hyperventilation syndrome]], often open mouth, and [[panic attack]]s.

Other common examples occur when sustained pressure has been applied over a [[nerve]], inhibiting/stimulating its function. Removing the pressure will typically result in gradual relief of these paresthesias.<ref name="NINDS">[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/paresthesia/paresthesia.htm Paresthesia Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. (NINDS)]</ref>

===Chronic===
Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of [[neuron]]s. 

In older individuals, paresthesia is often the result of poor [[Circulation (physiology)|circulation]] in the limbs (such as in [[peripheral vascular disease]], also referred to by physicians as '''PVD''' or '''PAD'''), most often caused by [[atherosclerosis]], the build up of plaque within artery walls, over decades, with eventual [[vulnerable plaque|plaque ruptures]], internal clots over the ruptures and subsequent clot healing but leaving behind [[stenosis|narrowing of the artery openings]] or closure, both locally and in downstream smaller branches. Without a proper supply of blood and nutrients, nerve cells can no longer adequately send signals to the brain. Because of this, paresthesia can also be a symptom of [[vitamin deficiency]] and [[malnutrition]], as well as metabolic disorders like [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypothyroidism]], and [[hypoparathyroidism]].  It can also be a symptom of [[mercury poisoning]].

Irritation to the nerve can also come from inflammation to the tissue. Joint conditions such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], and [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] are common sources of paresthesia. Nerves below the head may be compressed where chronic neck and spine problems exist and can be caused by, among other things, muscle cramps that may be a result of clinical anxiety or excessive mental stress,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[bone disease]], poor posture, unsafe heavy-lifting practices or physical trauma such as [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]].  Paresthesia can also be caused simply by putting pressure on a nerve by applying weight (or pressure) to the limb for extended periods of time.

Another cause of paresthesia, however, may be direct damage to the nerves themselves, ''i.e.'', [[neuropathy]], which itself can stem from [[nerve injury|injury]] or infection such as [[frostbite]] or [[Lyme disease]], or which may be indicative of a current neurological disorder. Neuropathy is also a side effect of some chemotherapies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6|title=Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> Benzodiazepine withdrawal may also cause paresthesia as the drug removal leaves the [[GABA receptors]] stripped bare and possibly malformed. Chronic paresthesia can sometimes be symptomatic of serious conditions, such as a [[transient ischemic attack]], or [[autoimmune disease]]s like [[multiple sclerosis]] or [[lupus erythematosus]]. 

The [[herpes zoster]] disease (shingles) can attack nerves causing numbness instead of pain commonly associated with shingles. A diagnostic evaluation by a medical doctor is necessary to rule these out.{{Clarify|date=December 2010|reason=rule what out?  would seem to apply to everything in this section!  and be redundant}} 

[[Demyelinating disease]]s may also cause cross-talk between adjacent axons and lead to paresthesia. During impulse conduction some aberrant current that escaped a demyelinated axon can circulate in the exterior and depolarize an adjacent demyelinated, hyperexcitable axon. This can generate impulses conducted in both directions along this axon since no part of the axon is in a [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory state]]. This becomes very serious in conditions such as multiple sclerosis and [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]].

===Acroparesthesia===
Acroparesthesia is severe pain in the extremities, and may be caused by [[Fabry disease]], a type of [[Sphingolipidoses|sphingolipidosis]].<ref name=brschemi>{{cite book |author=Marks, Dawn B.;Swanson, Todd; Kim, Sandra I.;Glucksman, Marc |title=Biochemistry and Molecular biology |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer Health]]/[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-8624-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Dentistry===
Paresthesia or "persistent anesthesia" is a transient or potentially permanent condition of extended numbness after administration of local anesthesia and the injected anesthetic has terminated. <ref name="dentaldefinition">[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/paresthesia Paresthesia dental definition: The Free Dictionary. (TheFreeDictionary)]</ref>

Potential causes include trauma induced to the nerve sheath during administration of the injection, hemorrhage about the sheath, type of anesthetic used, or administration of anesthetic potentially contaminated with alcohol or sterilizing solutions.

==Diagnostic approach==
The nerve conduction study usually provides useful information for making diagnosis. A [[CT scan]] is sometimes used to rule out some causes from the central nervous system.

==Treatment==
Medications offered can include the [[immunosuppressant]] [[prednisone]], intravenous [[gamma globulin]] (IVIG), [[anticonvulsant]]s such as [[gabapentin]] or [[Tiagabine|Gabitril]] and [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] medication, among others, according to the underlying cause.

In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, palliative care can include the use of topical numbing creams, such as [[lidocaine]] or [[prilocaine]]. Care must be taken to apply only the necessary amount, as excess can contribute to the condition. Otherwise, these products offer extremely effective, but short-lasting, relief from the condition.

Paresthesia caused by shingles is treated with appropriate antiviral medication.
