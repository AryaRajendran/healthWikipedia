'''Abdominal aortic aneurysm''' (also known as '''AAA,''' pronounced "triple-a") is a localized [[Vasodilation|dilatation]] (ballooning) of the [[abdominal aorta]] exceeding the normal diameter by more than 50 percent, and is the most common form of [[aortic aneurysm]]. Approximately 90 percent of abdominal aortic aneurysms occur [[wikt:infrarenal|infrarenally]] (below the kidneys), but they can also occur [[wikt:pararenal|pararenally]] (at the level of the kidneys) or [[wikt:suprarenal|suprarenally]] (above the kidneys). Such aneurysms can extend to include one or both of the [[iliac arteries]] in the pelvis.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most commonly in individuals between 65 and 75 years old and are more common among men and smokers. They tend to cause no symptoms, although occasionally they cause [[pain]] in the abdomen and back (due to pressure on surrounding tissues) or in the legs (due to disturbed blood flow). The major complication of abdominal aortic aneurysms is rupture, which is life-threatening, as large amounts of blood spill into the [[abdominal cavity]], and can lead to death within minutes.<ref name=AAFP>{{cite journal |author=Upchurch GR, Schaub TA |title=Abdominal aortic aneurysm |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=73 |issue=7 |pages=1198–204 |year=2006 |pmid=16623206 }}</ref> Mortality of rupture repair in the hospital is 60% to 90%. 

Surgery is recommended when the aneurysm is large enough (>5.5&nbsp;cm in diameter) that the risk of surgery (1% to 6%){{Clarify|date=April 2012}} is less than the risk of rupture. In open surgery, the surgeon opens the abdomen and stitches in a replacement section of artery; in endovascular surgery the surgeon feeds the replacement section through the patient's artery and replaces it from inside. {{Clarify|date=August 2012}}

There is moderate evidence to support [[screening (medicine)|screening]] in individuals with risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysms (e.g., males ≥65).

==Classification==
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly divided according to their size and symptomatology. An aneurysm is usually defined as an outer aortic diameter over 3&nbsp;cm (normal diameter of the [[aorta]] is around 2&nbsp;cm).<ref name=ACC2005/> If the outer diameter exceeds 5.5&nbsp;cm, the aneurysm is considered to be large.<ref name=screening/>
A ruptured AAA is a clinical diagnosis involving the presence of the triad of abdominal pain, shock and a pulsatile abdominal mass. If these conditions are present, indicating AAA rupture, no further clinical investigations are needed before surgery.<ref name=repair/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Aortadiagramgray.png|thumb|A plate from ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' with yellow lines depicting the most common infrarenal location of the AAA.]]
The vast majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic. However, as abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, they may become painful and lead to pulsating sensations in the abdomen or pain in the chest, lower back, or scrotum.<ref name="harrisons">{{cite book|last=Fauci|first=Anthony|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|date=2008-03-06|edition=17|chapter=242|isbn=0-07-146633-9|accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref> The risk of rupture is high in a symptomatic aneurysm, which is therefore considered an indication for surgery. The complications include rupture, peripheral [[embolization]], acute aortic occlusion, and aortocaval (between the aorta and [[inferior vena cava]]) or aortoduodenal (between the aorta and the [[duodenum]]) [[fistulae]]. On physical examination, a [[palpable]] abdominal mass can be noted. [[Bruit]]s can be present in case of renal or visceral arterial [[stenosis]].<ref name=emedicine/>

The clinical manifestation of ruptured AAA usually includes excruciating pain of the lower back, flank, abdomen and groin. The bleeding usually leads to a [[hypovolemic shock]] with [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], [[cyanosis]], and altered mental status. The mortality of AAA rupture is up to 90%. 65–75% of patients die before they arrive at hospital and up to 90% die before they reach the operating room.<ref name=SmallAneurysmTrial>{{cite journal|author=Brown LC, Powell JT |title=Risk Factors for Aneurysm Rupture in Patients Kept Under Ultrasound Surveillance |journal=Annals of Surgery |volume=230 |issue=3 |pages=289–96; discussion 296–7|year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10493476 |pmc=1420874|doi=10.1097/00000658-199909000-00002}}</ref> The bleeding can be [[wikt:retroperitoneal|retroperitoneal]] or [[wikt:intraperitoneal|intraperitoneal]], or the rupture can create an aortocaval or aortointestinal (between the aorta and intestine) fistula.<ref name=Treska/> Flank [[ecchymosis]] (appearance of a bruise) is a sign of retroperitoneal [[wikt:hemorrhage|hemorrhage]], and is also called [[Grey Turner's sign]].<ref name=emedicine/><ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1437727883|pages=837|edition=24th ed.}}</ref>

==Causes==
The exact causes of the degenerative process remain unclear. There are, however, some hypotheses and well-defined [[risk factors]].<ref>http://www.danmedbul.dk/portal/pls/portal/docs/6348849.PDF</ref>
* Tobacco smoking: Greater than 90% of people who develop an AAA have [[Health effects of tobacco|smoked]] at some point in their life.<ref name="Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT 2008 494–501">{{cite journal |author=Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT |title=Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=358 |issue=5 |pages=494–501 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18234753 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct0707524 }}</ref>
* Alcohol and Hypertension: The inflammation caused by prolonged use of alcohol and hypertensive effects from abdominal edema which  leads to hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, and other conditions, is also considered a long-term cause of AAA.   
* Genetic influences: The influence of genetic factors is highly probable. The high familial prevalence rate is most notable in male individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clifton MA |title=Familial abdominal aortic aneurysms |journal=Br J Surg. |volume=64 |issue=11 |pages=765–6 |year=1977 |month=Nov |pmid=588966|doi=10.1002/bjs.1800641102 }}</ref> There are many hypotheses about the exact genetic disorder that could cause higher incidence of AAA among male members of the affected families. Some presumed that the influence of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]] deficiency could be crucial, while other experimental works favored the hypothesis of [[X-linked]] [[mutation]], which would explain the lower incidence in [[heterozygous]] females. Other hypotheses of genetic etiology have also been formulated.<ref name=emedicine/> [[Connective tissue]] disorders, such as [[Marfan syndrome]] and [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], have also been strongly associated with AAA.<ref name=Treska/> Both [[relapsing polychondritis]] and [[pseudoxanthoma elasticum]] may cause abdominal aortic aneurysm.<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 }}</ref>
* Atherosclerosis: The AAA was long considered to be caused by [[atherosclerosis]], because the walls of the AAA are frequently affected heavily. However, this hypothesis cannot be used to explain the initial defect and the development of [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]], which is observed in the process.<ref name=emedicine/>
* Other causes: Other causes of the development of AAA include: [[infection]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[arteritis]], [[cystic medial necrosis]] (m. Erdheim).<ref name=Treska/>

==Pathophysiology==
The most striking [[histopathology|histopathological]] changes of aneurysmatic aorta are seen in [[tunica media]] and [[intima]]. These include accumulation of lipids in [[foam cells]], extracellular free [[cholesterol]] crystals, [[calcification]]s, [[thrombosis]], and [[venous ulcer|ulcerations]] and ruptures of the layers. There is an [[adventitial]] [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrate]].<ref name=Treska/>
However, the [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] of tunica media by means of [[proteolytic]] process seems to be the basic [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] mechanism of the AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix [[metalloproteinase]]s in individuals with AAA. This leads to elimination of [[elastin]] from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of the [[blood pressure]].<ref name=emedicine/> There is also a reduced amount of [[vasa vasorum]] in the abdominal aorta (compared to the thoracic aorta); consequently, the tunica media must rely mostly on diffusion for nutrition which makes it more susceptible to damage.<ref name="MacSweeney">{{cite journal|author=MacSweeney STR, Powell JT, Greenhalgh RM |title=Pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm |journal=The British Journal of Surgery |volume=81|issue=7 |pages=935–41|year=1994|doi=10.1002/bjs.1800810704}}</ref>

Hemodynamics affect the development of AAA. It has a [[wikt:predilection|predilection]] for the [[wikt:infrarenal|infrarenal]] aorta. The histological structure and mechanical characteristics of infrarenal aorta differ from those of the [[thoracic aorta]]. The diameter decreases from the root to the bifurcation, and the wall of the abdominal aorta also contains a lesser proportion of [[elastin]]. The mechanical [[muscle tension|tension]] in abdominal aortic wall is therefore higher than in the thoracic aortic wall. The [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[wikt:distensibility|distensibility]] also decline with age, which can result in gradual [[wikt:dilatation|dilatation]] of the segment. Higher [[intraluminal]] pressure in patients with arterial hypertension markedly contributes to the progression of the pathological process.<ref name=Treska/> Suitable hemodynamics conditions may be linked to specific Intraluminal Thrombus (ILT) patterns along the aortic lumen, which in turn may affect AAA's development.<ref name="Biasetti">{{cite journal|author=Biasetti J, Hussain F, Gasser TC |title=Blood flow and coherent vortices in the normal and aneurysmatic aortas: a fluid dynamical approach to intra-luminal thrombus formation |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |doi=10.1098/rsif.2011.0041|year=2011|volume=8|issue=63|page=1449}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually diagnosed by [[physical exam]], [[ultrasound]], or [[Computed tomography|CT]]. Plain abdominal radiographs may show the outline of an aneurysm when its walls are calcified. However, this is the case in less than half of all aneurysms. Ultrasonography is used to screen for aneurysms and to determine the size of any present. Additionally, free peritoneal fluid can be detected. It is noninvasive and sensitive, but the presence of bowel gas or obesity may limit its usefulness. CT scan has a nearly 100% sensitivity for aneurysm and is also useful in preoperative planning, detailing the anatomy and possibility for endovascular repair. In the case of suspected rupture, it can also reliably detect retroperitoneal fluid. Alternative less often used methods for visualization of the aneurysm include [[MRI]] and [[angiography]].

An aneurysm ruptures if the mechanical stress (tension per area) exceeds the local wall strength; consequently, peak wall stress (PWS)

==Management==
The treatment options for asymptomatic AAA are [[wikt:conservative treatment|conservative]] management, surveillance with a view to eventual repair, and immediate repair.
There are currently two modes of repair available for an AAA: open aneurysm repair (OR), and endovascular aneurysm repair ([[EVAR]]). An intervention is often recommended if the aneurysm grows more than 1&nbsp;cm per year or it is bigger than 5.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name="Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT 2008 494–501"/> Repair is also indicated for symptomatic aneurysms.<ref name="Ballard DJ, Filardo G, Fowkes G, Powell JT 2008 CD001835">{{cite journal |author=Ballard DJ, Filardo G, Fowkes G, Powell JT |title=Surgery for small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD001835 |year=2008 |pmid=18843626 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001835.pub2 |editor1-last=Ballard |editor1-first=David J}}</ref>

===Conservative===
Conservative management is indicated in patients where repair carries a high risk of mortality and in patients where repair is unlikely to improve life expectancy. The mainstay of the conservative treatment is [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] cessation.

Surveillance is indicated in small asymptomatic aneurysms (less than 5.5&nbsp;cm) where the risk of repair exceeds the risk of rupture. As an AAA grows in diameter the risk of rupture increases. Surveillance until the aneurysm has reached a diameter of 5.5&nbsp;cm has not been shown to have a higher risk as compared to early intervention.<ref name=SmallAneurysm>{{cite journal |author=Powell JT, Brown LC, Forbes JF, ''et al.'' |title=Final 12-year follow-up of surgery versus surveillance in the UK Small Aneurysm Trial |journal=Br J Surg |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=702–8|year=2007 |month=Jun |pmid=17514693 |doi=10.1002/bjs.5778 }}</ref><ref name=ADAM>{{cite journal|author=Lederle FA, Wilson SE, Johnson GR, ''et al.'' |title=Immediate repair compared with surveillance of small abdominal aortic aneurysms |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=346 |issue=19 |pages=1437–44 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12000813 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa012573 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/346/19/1437}}</ref>

===Surgery===

Surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm is known as AAA surgery or AAA repair.  The threshold for repair varies slightly from individual to individual, depending on the balance of risks and benefits when considering repair versus ongoing surveillance. The size of an individual's native aorta may influence this, along with the presence of comorbidities that increase operative risk or decrease life expectancy.<ref name="Ballard DJ, Filardo G, Fowkes G, Powell JT 2008 CD001835"/>

;Open repair
Open repair is indicated in young patients as an elective procedure, or in growing or large, symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms. It was the main surgical intervention used from the 1950s until other procedures developed.

For most operations, the surgeon tries to use as small an incision as reasonably possible, but that is not the case for open AAA surgery because there is an overriding concern. The aorta must be clamped off during the repair, and that denies blood to the entire abdomen and both legs; this can cause a whole range of complications if the aorta is shut off too long. It is essential to make the critical part of the operation fast, so the incision is typically made as large as possible, from just below the breastbone to just above the pubic bone.

Recovery after open AAA surgery takes significant time. The minimums are a few days in intensive care, a week total time in hospital and a few months before full recovery.

;Endovascular repair
[[File:Endovasc.jpg|thumb|Abdominal aortic endoprosthesis, CT scan, original aneurysm marked in blue.]]
{{Main|Endovascular aneurysm repair}}
Endovascular repair first became practical in the 1990s and although it is now an established alternative to open repair, its role is yet to be clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair. However, endovascular repair is feasible for only a proportion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in [[intensive care]], less time in hospital overall and earlier return to normal activity. Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related [[quality of life]] compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower.<ref name=pmid16782510>{{cite journal |author=Rutherford RB |title=Randomized EVAR trials and advent of level i evidence: a paradigm shift in management of large abdominal aortic aneurysms? |journal=Semin Vasc Surg |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=69–74 |year=2006 |month=Jun |pmid=16782510 |doi=10.1053/j.semvascsurg.2006.03.001}}</ref><ref name=pmid17502634>{{cite journal |author=Lederle FA, Kane RL, MacDonald R, Wilt TJ|title=Systematic review: repair of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm |journal=Ann.

Although the current standard of determining rupture risk is based on maximum diameter, it is known that smaller AAAs that fall below this threshold (diameter<5.5&nbsp;cm) may also rupture, and larger AAAs (diameter>5.5&nbsp;cm) may remain stable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Darling RC, Messina CR, Brewster DC, Ottinger LW |title=Autopsy study of unoperated abdominal aortic aneurysms.

Alternative methods of rupture assessment have been recently reported. The majority of these approaches involve the numerical analysis of AAAs using the common engineering technique of the finite element method (FEM) to determine the wall stress distributions. Recent reports have shown that these stress distributions have been shown to correlate to the overall geometry of the AAA rather than solely to the maximum diameter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vorp DA, Raghavan ML, Webster MW |title=Mechanical wall stress in abdominal aortic aneurysm: influence of diameter and asymmetry |journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=632–9 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9576075 |doi=10.1016/S0741-5214(98)70227-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Sacks MS, Vorp DA, Raghavan ML, Federle MP, Webster MW |title=In vivo three-dimensional surface geometry of abdominal aortic aneurysms |journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=469–79 |year=1999 |pmid=10468231|doi=10.1114/1.202}}</ref><ref name="Doyle BJ, Callanan A, Burke PE, et al. 2009 443–54">{{cite journal |author=Doyle BJ, Callanan A, Burke PE, ''et al.'' |title=Vessel Asymmetry as an Additional Diagnostic Tool in the Assessment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms |journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=443–54 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19028061 |doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2008.08.064 |pmc=2666821}}</ref> It is also known that wall stress alone does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength.

==History==
The first historical records about AAA are from [[Ancient Rome]] in the 2nd century AD, when Greek surgeon [[Antyllus]] tried to treat the AAA with [[proximal]] and [[distal]] [[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]], central [[incision]] and removal of [[thrombosis|thrombotic]] material from the [[aneurysm]].
However, attempts to treat the AAA surgically were unsuccessful until 1923. In that year, [[Rudolph Matas]] (who also proposed the concept of endoaneurysmorrhaphy), performed the first successful aortic ligation on a human.<ref name=livesay>{{cite journal |author=Livesay JJ, Messner GN, Vaughn WK |title=Milestones in Treatment of Aortic Aneurysm: Denton A.

===Risk assessment and experimental models===
There have been many calls for alternative approaches to rupture-risk assessment over the past number of years, with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach. Numerical modelling is a valuable tool to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated, thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm. Experimental models are required to validate these numerical results, and provide a further insight into the biomechanical behaviour of the AAA. ''In vivo'', AAAs exhibit a varying range of material strengths<ref>{{cite journal |title=Regional distribution of wall thickness and failure properties of human abdominal aortic aneurysm |journal=J.

===Prevention and treatment===
A recent animal study published in the journal ''Nature Medicine'' showed that removing a single protein prevents early damage in blood vessels from triggering a later-stage, frequently lethal complication of atherosclerosis. By eliminating the gene for a signaling protein called cyclophilin A (CypA) from a strain of mice, researchers were able to provide complete protection against abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).<ref>{{cite web |title=Study establishes major new treatment target in diseased arteries |date=May 10, 2009 |publisher=U.S. News & World Report  |url=http://www.physorg.com/news161183060.html}}</ref>

Other recent research, published in the ''American Journal of Pathology'', identified Granzyme B ([[GZMB]]) (a protein-degrading enzyme) to be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Specifically, elimination of this enzyme in mice models — both slowed the progression of aneurysms and improved survival.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Perforin-Independent Extracellular Granzyme B Activity Contributes to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm |journal=Am J Pathol. |volume=176 |issue=2 |pages=1038–1049 |year=2010 |doi=10.2353/ajpath.2010.090700 |url=http://ajp.amjpathol.org/cgi/content/abstract/176/2/1038 |pmc=2808106 |last1=Chamberlain |first1=C.M. |last2=Ang |first2=L.S. |last3=Boivin|first3=W.A. |last4=Cooper|first4=D.M. |last5=Williams |first5=S.

With the recent advancements in AAA research, coupled with the increasing collaboration between clinicians and engineers, the future research into AAA rupture-prediction and treatment appears to be in a strong position to combat what is currently ranked as the 13th leading cause of death in the US and the 10th leading cause of death in men over the age of 55 years.
