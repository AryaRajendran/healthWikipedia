The '''submandibular ganglion''' (or '''submaxillary ganglion''' in older texts) is part of the human [[autonomic nervous system]]. It is one of four [[parasympathetic ganglia]] of the head and neck. (The others are the [[otic ganglion]], [[pterygopalatine ganglion]], and [[ciliary ganglion]]).

==Function==
The submandibular ganglion is responsible for innervation of two [[salivary glands]]: the [[submandibular gland]] and [[sublingual gland]].

==Location and relations==
The submandibular ganglion is small and [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] in shape. It is situated above the deep portion of the [[submandibular gland]], on the [[hyoglossus muscle]], near the posterior border of the [[mylohyoid muscle]]. 

The ganglion 'hangs' by two nerve filaments from the lower border of the [[lingual nerve]] (itself a branch of the [[mandibular nerve]], CN V<sub>3</sub>). It is suspended from the lingual nerve by two filaments, one anterior and one posterior. Through the posterior of these it receives a branch from the [[chorda tympani]] nerve which runs in the sheath of the lingual nerve.

==Fibers==
Like other parasympathetic ganglia of the head and neck, the submandibular ganglion is the site of synapse for parasympathetic fibers and carries other types of nerve fiber that do not synapse in the ganglion. In summary, the fibers carried in the ganglion are:
*Sympathetic fibers from the [[external carotid plexus]], via the [[facial nerve]] and its branches. These do not synapse in this ganglion.
*[[Preganglionic]] parasympathetic fibers from the [[superior salivatory nucleus]] of the [[medulla oblongata]], via the [[chorda tympani]] and [[lingual nerve]], which synapse at the origin of:
*[[Postganglionic]] parasympathetic fibers to the [[oral mucosa]] and the [[submandibular gland|submandibular]] and [[sublingual gland|sublingual]] salivary glands.They are secretomotor to these glands.
