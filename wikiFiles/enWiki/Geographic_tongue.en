'''Geographic tongue''' is an inflammatory condition of the [[tongue]] affecting approximately 2% of the population as of 2003,<ref name="Fitzpatrick">{{Fitzpatrick 6|112|1208}}</ref> and 3% of as 2012.<ref name="s-mangione" /> It is characterized by discolored regions of [[taste bud]]s or sometimes even cracks in the surface of the tongue. The condition is usually chronic, and frequently manifests after eating any of a range of exacerbating foods, or during times of stress, illness, or hormonal surges (particularly in women just before menstruating). It is also known as benign migratory glossitis, [[Mouth|oral]] [[erythema migrans]], glossitis areata exfoliativa, glossitis areata migrans, lingua geographica, stomatitis areata migrans, and transitory benign plaques of the tongue.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 }}</ref>{{rp|800}}<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The top side of the tongue is covered in small protrusions called [[wiktionary:Papillae|papillae]]. In a tongue affected by geographic tongue, red patches on the surface of the tongue are bordered by grayish white. The papillae are missing from the reddish areas and overcrowded in the grayish white borders. Whitish/yellow discoloration of the tongue is frequently due to a yeast infection.{{fact|date=June 2012}} The small patches may disappear and reappear in a short period of time (hours or days), and change in shape or size. While it is not common for the condition to cause pain, it may cause a burning or stinging sensation, especially after contact with certain foods. Foods that sometimes cause irritation, burning or slight swelling of the tongue include tomato, eggplant, walnuts, sharp cheeses, spicy foods, sour foods, mint, candy and [[citrus]]. Coincidentally, most of these foods contain high levels of natural salicylates, e.g. 2.39 mg/100 g in oranges, 9.4 mg/100 g in fresh mint, and 218 mg/100 g in curry powder. Geographic tongue may also cause numbness. Coexistence of [[Fissured tongue|fissures of the tongue]] is often noticed. Chemicals, such as mouth washes and teeth whiteners, can also aggravate the condition.
Lesions may occasionally occur on sites other than the tongue in the condition [[areata migrans]].<ref name="Fitzpatrick"/> Lesions that are histologically indistinguishable from geographic tongue may also be diagnosed in [[Reiter's syndrome]].<ref name="burket-greenberg-glick">{{cite book |title=Burket's Oral Medicine: Diagnosis & Treatment |first1=Lester William |last1=Burket |first2=Martin S. |last2=Greenberg |first3=Michael |last3=Glick |authorlink=Michael Glick |publisher=PMPH-USA |year=2003 |isbn=1550091867 |page=116 |accessdate=November 12, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EaIieB9kX_gC&pg=PA116&dq=eczema+asthma+allergies+geographic+tongue&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EAqkUL7dKKf42QWo1YGADQ&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=eczema%20asthma%20allergies%20geographic%20tongue&f=false}}</ref>

===Ectopic geographic tongue===
Aside from occurring on the dorsal and lateral tongue, lesions infrequently involve the ventral tongue and buccal or labial mucosa. They are rarely reported on the soft palate and floor of the mouth. This condition is called [[migratory stomatitis]] or ectopic geographic tongue.<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |year=2011 |month=Aug |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0190-9622/PIIS0190962210004883.pdf| format=PDF}}</ref>

==Histopathology==
[[Image:Geographic Tongue.jpg|thumb|right|Another example of geographic tongue, showing strong color contrast between the red and white areas]]

Irregular areas of [[keratin|dekeratinized]] and desquamated [[filiform papillae]] (red in color) are surrounded by elevated whitish or yellow margins due to acantholysis and hyperkeratosis. Neutrophils migrate into the epithelial layer, creating what are termed [[Munro's abscesses]].

==Cause==
Its cause is uncertain,<ref name="cameron-jelinek-everitt">{{cite book |title=Tratado de Medicina de Urgencias Pediátricas |first1=Peter |last1=Cameron |first2=George |last2=Jelinek |first3=Ian |last3=Everitt |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=0443073481 |page=365 |accessdate=November 12, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Woq0HVYwr4kC&pg=PA365&dq=zinc+allergies+geographic+tongue&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eBOkUPu7IKPQ2AXkqoBA&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=zinc%20allergies%20geographic%20tongue&f=false}}</ref><ref name="WebMD">{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/tongue-geographic|title=Tongue, Geographic|publisher=webmd.com|accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> and can occur at any age<ref name="WebMD-causestreat">{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/geographic-tongue|title=Geographic Tongue: Causes and Treatments|publisher=webmd.com|accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> though it tends to affect middle-aged to older adults<ref name="WebMD-causestreat" /> and run in families<ref name="s-mangione" /> and is associated with several different [[genes]], though studies show family association may also be caused by similar diets. Geographic tongue is more commonly found in people or family history who are affected by environmental sensitivity, such as [[hay fever]], [[pernicious anemia]], [[eczema]], and [[asthma]].<ref name="burket-greenberg-glick" /> [[Lithium carbonate]] has been associated with the development of geographic tongue.<ref name="burket-greenberg-glick" /> There is a fourfold increase of geographic tongue with patients who have [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|juvenile diabetes]] and this is possibly due to a increment of elevated amounts of [[HLA-B15]] tissue type.<ref name="burket-greenberg-glick" /> Some think that it may be linked to stress or diets high in sugar or processed foods.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Its prevalence also varies by nationality (0.6% of Americans, 4% of young Iraqis, 2% of young Finns) and gender (females are affected three times more than males). Causes vary, but may include zinc or vitamin B deficiencies,<ref>{{cite book |title=Clinical Naturopathic Medicine |first=Leah |last=Hechtman |publisher=Elsevier |year=2012 |isbn=0729541517 |page=1511 |accessdate=November 12, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9cMOSbgozIC&pg=PA1511&dq=zinc+allergies+geographic+tongue&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eBOkUPu7IKPQ2AXkqoBA&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=zinc%20allergies%20geographic%20tongue&f=false}}</ref> allergies, and hormonal changes. Geographic tongue is said to occur more often in women, especially folic acid deficiency<ref name="burket-greenberg-glick" /> during high hormonal times<ref name="s-mangione" /> such as during ovulation or [[pregnancy]], and while taking birth control (generally around the 17th day).{{medical citation needed|date=June 2012}} Geographic tongue is commonly seen in children under the age of four but is not uncommon for older children.<ref name="cameron-jelinek-everitt" />

Studies show there is a link between geographic tongue and [[psoriasis]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=USA |pmid=11535977 |title=Geographic tongue (migrant glossitis) and psoriasis |publisher=|date=2010-12-08 |volume=50 |issue=6 |journal=Minerva Stomatol |pages=213–7}}</ref><ref>[http://www.maxillofacialcenter.com/BondBook/mucosa/geogtongue.html Migratory Glossitis (Geographic Tongue)].</ref> Although geographic tongue is common in psoriasis, 90% of children who are diagnosed with geographic tongue do not contract psoriasis.<ref name="cameron-jelinek-everitt" />

The New England Journal of Medicine reports a connection between Celiac Disease and geographic tongue and calls this association "very common." "Our report should alert physicians and dental practitioners to consider [[celiac disease]] in managing cases of idiopathic atrophic glossitis." <ref> Alberta Lucchese, Agostino Guida, Rosario Serpico. (2012) Glossodynia and coeliac disease. Immunopharmacology and Immunotoxicology 1-3 [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc070200 Atrophic Glossitis Leading to the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease]. </ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:Fissured geographic tongue.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Fissured tongue]] combined with geographic tongue more posteriorly. It is very common for these two conditions to coexist]]
Treatment is generally unnecessary <ref name="Duodecim">{{cite journal |url=http://www.terveyskirjasto.fi/terveyskirjasto/tk.koti?p_artikkeli=dlk00780}}</ref> and will usually go away but may affect another area of the tongue.<ref name="WebMD" /> While there is no known cure or commonly prescribed treatment for geographic tongue, there are several ways to suppress the condition, including avoiding foods that exacerbate the problem.<ref name="cameron-jelinek-everitt" />  Steroid ointment, such as cortisone products, may be applied topically for symptomatic patients.<ref name="Fitzpatrick"/><ref name="cameron-jelinek-everitt" /> Triamcinolone Acetonide Dental Paste USP,0.1% can be applied to affected area at night to try and help. Burning may also be reduced by antihistamines. The condition is usually asymptomatic and insignificant; persistent pain is rare.  Varying in the severity, doctors and dentists may prescribe anesthetic mouth rinses, pain relievers or zinc supplements.<ref name="WebMD-causestreat" />

Geographic tongue is not contagious.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burkhart|first=Nancy W.|url=http://www.rdhmag.com/articles/print/volume-28/issue-10/columns/oral-exams/geographic-tongue.html|title=Geographic Tongue|publisher=[[PennWell]]|accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref>
