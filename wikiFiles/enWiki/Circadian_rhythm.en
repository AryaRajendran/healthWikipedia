A '''circadian rhythm''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|ɜː|ˈ|k|eɪ|d|i|ə|n}}) is any biological process that displays an [[Endogeny|endogenous]], [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainable]] oscillation of about 24 hours. These rhythms are driven by a [[circadian clock]], and rhythms have been widely observed in [[plants]], [[animals]], [[fungi]] and [[cyanobacteria]]. The term ''circadian'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[circa]]'', meaning "around" (or "approximately"), and ''diem'' or ''dies'', meaning "day". The formal study of biological temporal rhythms, such as daily, [[tidal]], weekly, seasonal, and annual rhythms, is called [[chronobiology]]. Although circadian rhythms are endogenous ("built-in", self-sustained), they are adjusted (entrained) to the local environment by external cues called [[zeitgeber]]s, commonly the most important of which is [[daylight]].

==History==
The earliest recorded account of a circadian process dates from the 4th century BC, when [[Androsthenes of Thasos|Androsthenes]], a ship captain serving under [[Alexander the Great]], described [[diurnality|diurnal]] leaf movements of the [[tamarind]] tree.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Bretzl, H. |title=Botanische Forschungen des Alexanderzuges |location=Leipzig |publisher=Teubner |year=1903}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The observation of a circadian or diurnal process in humans is mentioned in Chinese medical texts dated to around the 13th century, including the ''Noon and Midnight Manual'' and the ''Mnemonic Rhyme to Aid in the Selection of Acu-points According to the Diurnal Cycle, the Day of the Month and the Season of the Year''.<ref name="cl">{{cite book|author=Gwei-Djen Lu|title=Celestial Lancets|accessdate=28 September 2012|date=25 October 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1458-2|pages=137–140}}</ref>

The first recorded observation of an endogenous [[circadian clock|circadian oscillation]] was by the French scientist [[Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan]] in 1729. He noted that 24-hour patterns in the movement of the leaves of the plant ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' continued even when the plants were kept in constant darkness, in the first experiment to attempt to distinguish an endogenous clock from responses to daily stimuli.<ref name="de mairan 1729">{{Cite journal | author=de Mairan JJO | title=Observation Botanique | journal=Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences | year=1729 | pages=35–36}}</ref><ref name="pmid16761955">{{Cite journal |author=Gardner MJ, Hubbard KE, Hotta CT, Dodd AN, Webb AA |title=How plants tell the time |journal=The Biochemical Journal |volume=397 |issue=1 |pages=15–24 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16761955 |pmc=1479754 |doi=10.1042/BJ20060484 |url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/397/0015/bj3970015.htm |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>

The term "circadian" was coined by [[Franz Halberg]] in the late 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/05/circadian_quackery_1.php |title=Circadian Quackery |accessdate=2010-02-23 |last= Zivkovic |first=Bora |date=3 May 2008 |work=A Blog Around the Clock |publisher=[[ScienceBlogs]]}}</ref>

==Criteria==
To be called circadian, a biological rhythm must meet these four general criteria:
# '''The rhythms repeat once a day (they have a 24-hour period).''' In order to keep track of the time of day, a clock must be at the same point at the same time each day, i.e. repeat every 24 hours.
# '''The rhythms persist in the absence of external cues (endogenous).''' The rhythm persists in constant conditions with a period of about 24 hours. The rationale for this criterion is to distinguish circadian rhythms from simple responses to daily external cues. A rhythm cannot be said to be endogenous unless it has been tested in conditions without external periodic input.
# '''The rhythms can be adjusted to match the local time (entrainable).''' The rhythm can be reset by exposure to external stimuli (such as light and heat), a process called [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]]. The rationale for this criterion is to distinguish circadian rhythms from other imaginable endogenous 24-hour rhythms that are immune to resetting by external cues, and hence do not serve the purpose of estimating the local time. Travel across [[time zone]]s illustrates the ability of the human biological clock to adjust to the local time; a person will usually experience [[jet lag]] before entrainment of their circadian clock has brought it into sync with local time.
# '''The rhythms maintain circadian periodicity over a range of physiological temperatures; they exhibit temperature compensation.''' Some organisms live at a broad range of temperatures, and differences in thermal energy will affect the [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of all molecular processes in their cell(s). In order to keep track of time, the organism's circadian clock must maintain a roughly 24-hour periodicity despite the changing kinetics, a property known as temperature compensation.

==Origin==
Photosensitive proteins and circadian rhythms are believed to have originated in the earliest cells, with the purpose of protecting the replicating of DNA from high [[ultraviolet]] radiation during the daytime. As a result, replication was relegated to the dark. The fungus ''[[Neurospora]]'', which exists today, retains this [[circadian oscillator|clock-regulated mechanism]].

Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes; they have great value in relation to the outside world. The rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes, as in coordinating with the environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Sharma, V.K. |title=Adaptive significance of circadian clocks |journal=Chronobiology International |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=901–19 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14680135 |doi=10.1081/CBI-120026099}}</ref> This is suggested by the maintenance (heritability) of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions,<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Sheeba, V.; Sharma, V.K.; Chandrashekaran, M.K.; Joshi, A. |title=Persistence of eclosion rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster after 600 generations in an aperiodic environment |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=86 |issue=9 |pages=448–9 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10501695 |doi=10.1007/s001140050651|bibcode = 1999NW.....86..448S }}</ref> as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild, and by the experimental elimination of behavioural but not physiological circadian rhythms in quail.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Guyomarc'h, C.; Lumineau, S.; Richard, J.P. |title=Circadian rhythm of activity in Japanese quail in constant darkness: variability of clarity and possibility of selection |journal=Chronobiology International |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages= 219–30 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9653576 |doi=10.3109/07420529808998685}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Zivkovic, B.D.; Underwood, H.; Steele, C.T.; Edmonds, K. |title=Formal properties of the circadian and photoperiodic systems of Japanese quail: phase response curve and effects of T-cycles |journal=Journal of Biological Rhythms |url=http://jbr.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10511005 |volume=14 |issue= 5 |pages=378–90 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10511005 |doi=10.1177/074873099129000786}}</ref>

The simplest known circadian clock is that of the prokaryotic [[cyanobacteria]]. Recent research has demonstrated that the circadian clock of ''Synechococcus elongatus'' can be reconstituted ''in vitro'' with just the three proteins of their central oscillator. This clock has been shown to sustain a 22-hour rhythm over several days upon the addition of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Previous explanations of the [[prokaryotic]] circadian timekeeper were dependent upon a DNA transcription/translation feedback mechanism.

A defect in the human homologue of the ''[[Drosophila]]'' "[[period (gene)|period]]" gene was identified as a cause of the sleep disorder FASPS ([[Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]]), underscoring the conserved nature of the molecular circadian clock through evolution. Many more genetic components of the biological clock are now known. Their interactions result in an interlocked feedback loop of gene products resulting in periodic fluctuations that the cells of the body interpret as a specific time of the day.

It is now known that the molecular circadian clock can function within a single cell; i.e., it is cell-autonomous.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Nagoshi, E.; Saini, C.; Bauer, C.; Laroche, T.; Naef, F.; Schibler, U. |title=Circadian gene expression in individual fibroblasts: cell-autonomous and self-sustained oscillators pass time to daughter cells |journal=Cell |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=693–705 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15550250 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.11.015}}</ref> This was shown by [[Gene Block]] in isolated mollusk BRNs{{clarify|date=April 2013}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Michel|first=Stephan|coauthors=et al.|title=Circadian Rhythm in Membrane Conductance Expressed in Isolated Neurons|journal=Science|year=1993|volume=259|pages=239–241}}</ref> At the same time, different cells may communicate with each other resulting in a synchronised output of electrical signaling. These may interface with endocrine glands of the brain to result in periodic release of hormones. The receptors for these hormones may be located far across the body and synchronise the peripheral clocks of various organs. Thus, the information of the time of the day as relayed by the [[Human eye|eye]]s travels to the clock in the brain, and, through that, clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised. This is how the timing of, for example, sleep/wake, body temperature, thirst, and appetite are coordinately controlled by the biological clock.

==Importance in animals==
Circadian rhythmicity is present in the sleeping and feeding patterns of animals, including human beings. There are also clear patterns of core body temperature, [[Neural oscillation|brain wave]] activity, [[hormone]] production, cell regeneration and other biological activities. In addition, [[photoperiodism]], the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of day or night, is vital to both plants and animals, and the circadian system plays a role in the measurement and interpretation of day length.
{{cquote|Timely prediction of seasonal periods of weather conditions, food availability or predator activity is crucial for survival of many species. Although not the only parameter, the changing length of the photoperiod ('daylength') is the most predictive environmental cue for the seasonal timing of physiology and behavior, most notably for timing of migration, hibernation and reproduction.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Clock Tutorial #16: Photoperiodism - Models and Experimental Approaches |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/07/clock_tutorial_16_photoperiodi_1.php |accessdate=2007-12-09 |last=Zivkovic |first=Bora "Coturnix" |date=2005-08-13 / July 25, 2007 |work=A Blog Around the Clock |publisher=ScienceBlogs}}</ref>}}

===Impact of light–dark cycle===
The rhythm is linked to the light–dark cycle. Animals, including humans, kept in total darkness for extended periods eventually function with a [[free-running sleep|freerunning]] rhythm. Their sleep cycle is pushed back or forward each "day", depending on whether their "day", their [[endogenous]] period, is shorter or longer than 24 hours. The environmental cues that reset the rhythms each day are called ''[[zeitgeber]]s'' (from the German, "time-givers").<ref name=health.am>{{Cite web |author=Shneerson, J.M.; Ohayon, M.M.; Carskadon, M.A. |title=Circadian rhythms |publisher=Armenian Medical Network |work=Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep |url=http://www.sleep.health.am/sleep/more/circadian-rhythms/ |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> It is interesting to note that totally blind subterranean mammals (e.g., [[blind mole rat]] ''Spalax'' sp.) are able to maintain their endogenous clocks in the apparent absence of external stimuli. Although they lack image-forming eyes, their photoreceptors (which detect light) are still functional; they do surface periodically as well.<ref>"The Rhythms of Life: The Biological Clocks That Control the Daily Lives of Every Living Thing" Russell Foster & Leon Kreitzman, Publisher: Profile Books Ltd.</ref>

Freerunning organisms that normally have one or two consolidated sleep episodes will still have them when in an environment shielded from external cues, but the rhythm is, of course, not entrained to the 24-hour light–dark cycle in nature. The sleep–wake rhythm may, in these circumstances, become out of phase with other circadian or [[ultradian]] rhythms such as metabolic, hormonal, CNS electrical, or neurotransmitter rhythms.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Regestein |first=Quentin R. |coauthor=Pavlova, Milena |date=September 1995 |title=Treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome |journal=General Hospital Psychiatry |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T70-3Y6PCPVF/2/d71146c55942bb86e95e87fe45e95687 |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=335–345 |publisher=Elsevier Science Inc. |format=Abstract |pmid=8522148 |doi=10.1016/0163-8343(95)00062-V}}</ref>

Recent research has influenced the design of [[human spaceflight|spacecraft]] environments, as systems that mimic the light–dark cycle have been found to be highly beneficial to astronauts.<ref>{{web cite

===Arctic animals===
Norwegian researchers at the [[University of Tromsø]] have shown that some [[Arctic#Biota|Arctic animals]] ([[Rock Ptarmigan|ptarmigan]], [[reindeer]]) show circadian rhythms only in the parts of the year that have daily sunrises and sunsets. In one study of reindeer, animals at [[70th parallel north|70 degrees North]] showed circadian rhythms in the autumn, winter, and spring, but not in the summer. Reindeer at [[78th parallel north|78 degrees North]] showed such rhythms only in autumn and spring. The researchers suspect that other Arctic animals as well may not show circadian rhythms in the constant light of summer and the constant dark of winter.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Ingrid |last=Spilde |title=Reinsdyr uten døgnrytme |url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2005/desember/1135264557.29 |publisher=forskning.no |date=December 2005 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |language=Norwegian, Bokmål}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/07/circadian_rhythms_or_not_in_ar_1.php |title=Circadian Rhythms, or Not, in Arctic Reindeer |accessdate=2007-11-24 |last=Zivkovic |first=Bora, aka Coturnix, chronobiologist |work=A Blog around the Clock |publisher=ScienceBlogs.com}}</ref>

However, another study in northern Alaska found that [[ground squirrel]]s and [[porcupine]]s strictly maintained their circadian rhythms through 82 days and nights of sunshine. The researchers speculate that these two small mammals see that the apparent distance between the sun and the horizon is shortest once a day, and, thus, a sufficient signal to adjust by.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/02/small_arctic_mammals_entrain_t.php |title=Small Arctic Mammals Entrain to Something during the Long Summer Day |accessdate=2007-11-26 |author=Zivkovic, Bora, aka Coturnix, chronobiologist |work=A Blog Around the Clock |date=2007-02-11 |publisher=ScienceBlogs.com}}</ref>

===Butterfly migration===
The navigation of the fall migration of the [[monarch (butterfly)|Eastern North American monarch butterfly]] (''Danaus plexippus'') to their overwintering grounds in central Mexico uses a time-compensated sun compass that depends upon a circadian clock in their antennae.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Merlin, C.; Gegear, R.J.; Reppert, S.M. |title=Antennal circadian clocks coordinate sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5948 |pages=1700–4 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19779201 |doi=10.1126/science.1176221 |pmc=2754321|bibcode = 2009Sci...325.1700M }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Kyriacou, C.P. |title= Physiology.

Plant circadian rhythms tell the plant what season it is and when to flower for the best chance of attracting pollinators. Behaviors showing rhythms include leaf movement, growth, germination, stomatal/gas exchange, enzyme activity, photosynthetic activity, and fragrance emission, among others.<ref name=webb03>{{Cite journal |last=Webb |first=Alex A.R. |date=June 2003 |title=The physiology of circadian rhythms in plants |journal=New Phytologist |issue=160 |pages=281–303 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1514280}}</ref> Circadian rhythms occur as a plant entrains to synchronize with the light cycle of its surrounding environment. These rhythms are endogenously generated and self-sustaining and are relatively constant over a range of ambient temperatures. Important features include two interacting transcription-translation feedback loops; proteins containing PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions; and several photoreceptors that fine-tune the clock to different light conditions. Anticipation of changes in the environment allows appropriate changes in a plant's physiological state, conferring an adaptive advantage.<ref name=mcclung06>{{Cite journal |last=McClung |first=C. Robertson |date=April 2006 |title=Plant Circadian Rhythms |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=18 |pages=792–803 |url=http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/reprint/18/4/792 |doi=10.1105/tpc.106.040980 |issue=4 |pmid=16595397 |pmc=1425852}}</ref> A better understanding of plant circadian rhythms has applications in agriculture, such as helping farmers stagger crop harvests to extend crop availability and securing against massive losses due to weather. 

Light is the signal by which plants synchronize their internal clocks to their environment and is sensed by a wide variety of photoreceptors. Red and blue light are absorbed through several phytochromes and [[cryptochrome]]s. One phytochrome, phyA, is the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the dark but rapidly degrades in light to produce Cry1. Phytochromes B–E are more stable with phyB, the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the light. The cryptochrome (cry) gene is also a light-sensitive component of the circadian clock and is thought to be involved both as a photoreceptor and as part of the clock's endogenous pacemaker mechanism. Cryptochromes 1–2 (involved in blue–UVA) help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions.<ref name=webb03/><ref name=mcclung06/>

The central oscillator generates a self-sustaining rhythm and is driven by two interacting feedback loops that are active at different times of day. The morning loop consists of CCA1 (Circadian and Clock Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in ''Arabidopsis'', as well as PRR 7 and 9 (Pseudo-Response Regulators.)  The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in regulation of flowering time genes.<ref name=Mizoguchi> <Mizoguchi, T., L. Wright, S. Fujiwara, F. Cremer, K. Lee, H. Onouchi, A. Mouradov, S. Fowler, H. Kamada, J. Putterill, and G. Coupland. 2005. Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in [[Arabidopsis]].

Plant Signal Behavior 2(5):370-372 </ref> When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions) plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop. cca1 and lhy gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early morning, while [[TOC1 gene]] expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY,<ref name=mcclung06/>, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of cca1, lhy, and prr7 and 9 in the morning loop, but also of gi and elf4 in the evening loop. This finding and further computational modeling of [[TOC1 gene]] functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component [[repressilator]] model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals.<ref> Pokhilko, A., A.

==Biological clock in mammals==
[[Image:Circadian rhythm labeled.jpg|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating the influence of light and darkness on circadian rhythms and related [[physiology]] and behaviour through the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] in humans.]]
The primary circadian "clock" in [[mammal]]s is located in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (or nuclei) (SCN), a pair of distinct groups of [[cell (biology)|cells]] located in the [[hypothalamus]]. Destruction of the SCN results in the complete absence of a regular sleep–wake rhythm. The SCN receives information about illumination through the eyes. The [[retina]] of the eye contains "classical" [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] ("[[Rod cell|rods]]" and "[[Cone cell|cones]]"), which are used for conventional vision. But the retina also contains specialized [[Photosensitive ganglion cell|ganglion cell]]s which are directly photosensitive, and project directly to the SCN where they help in the entrainment of this master circadian clock.

These cells contain the photopigment [[melanopsin]] and their signals follow a pathway called the [[retinohypothalamic tract]], leading to the SCN. If cells from the SCN are removed and cultured, they maintain their own rhythm in the absence of external cues.

The SCN takes the information on the lengths of the day and night from the retina, interprets it, and passes it on to the [[pineal gland]], a tiny structure shaped like a [[pine cone]] and located on the [[epithalamus]]. In response, the pineal secretes the hormone [[melatonin]]. Secretion of melatonin peaks at night and ebbs during the day and its presence provides information about night-length.

Several studies have indicated that pineal melatonin feeds back on SCN rhythmicity to modulate circadian patterns of activity and other processes. However, the nature and system-level significance of this feedback are unknown. 

The circadian rhythms of humans can be entrained to slightly shorter and longer periods than the Earth's 24 hours. Researchers at Harvard have recently shown that human subjects can at least be entrained to a 23.5-hour cycle and a 24.65-hour cycle (the latter being the natural solar day-night cycle on the planet [[Mars]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Scheer, F.A.; Wright, K.P.; Kronauer, R.E.; Czeisler, C.A. |title= Plasticity of the intrinsic period of the human circadian timing system |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=e721 |year=2007 |pmid=17684566 |pmc=1934931 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000721 |editor1-last=Nicolelis |editor1-first=Miguel|bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..721S }}</ref>

=== Humans ===
Early research into circadian rhythms suggested that most people preferred a day closer to 25 hours when isolated from external stimuli like daylight and timekeeping. However, this research was faulty because it failed to shield the participants from artificial light. Although subjects were shielded from time cues (like clocks) and daylight, the researchers were not aware of the phase-delaying effects of indoor electric lights.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= Duffy |first=Jeanne F. |coauthors=Kenneth P.

Electric light in the evening delayed their circadian phase; these results became well known.<ref name=hno/> 

More recent research has shown that adults have a built-in day, which averages about 24 hours; indoor lighting does affect circadian rhythms; and most people attain their best-quality sleep during their [[chronotype]]-determined sleep periods. A study by [[Charles Czeisler|Czeisler]] et al. at Harvard found the range for normal, healthy adults of all ages to be quite narrow: 24 hours and 11 minutes ± 16 minutes. The "clock" resets itself daily to the 24-hour cycle of the Earth's rotation.<ref name=hno>{{Cite web |author=Charles A.

=== Biological markers ===
The classic phase markers for measuring the timing of a mammal's circadian rhythm are:
* [[melatonin]] secretion by the [[pineal gland]]
* core body temperature<ref name="phasemarkers">{{Cite journal |author=Benloucif, S.; Guico, M.J.; Reid, K.J.; Wolfe, L.F.; L'hermite-Balériaux, M.; Zee, P.C. |title=Stability of melatonin and temperature as circadian phase markers and their relation to sleep times in humans |journal=Journal of Biological Rhythms |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=178–88 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15834114 |doi=10.1177/0748730404273983}}</ref>

For temperature studies, subjects must remain awake but calm and semi-reclined in near darkness while their rectal temperatures are taken continuously. {{Reference necessary|text=The average human adult's temperature reaches its minimum at about 05:00 (5 a.m.), about two hours before habitual wake time|date=June 2011}}, though variation is great among normal [[chronotype]]s.

Melatonin is absent from the system or undetectably low during daytime. Its onset in dim light, ''dim-light melatonin onset'' (DLMO), at about 21:00 (9 p.m.) can be measured in the blood or the saliva. Its major [[metabolite]] can also be measured in morning urine. Both DLMO and the midpoint (in time) of the presence of the hormone in the blood or saliva have been used as circadian markers. However, newer research indicates that the melatonin ''offset'' may be the more reliable marker. Benloucif et al. in Chicago in 2005 found that melatonin phase markers were more stable and more highly correlated with the timing of sleep than the core temperature minimum. They found that both sleep offset and melatonin offset were more strongly correlated with the various phase markers than sleep onset. In addition, the declining phase of the melatonin levels was more reliable and stable than the termination of melatonin synthesis.<ref name="phasemarkers"/>

One method used for measuring melatonin offset is to analyse a sequence of urine samples throughout the morning <!--and day--> for the presence of the melatonin [[metabolite]] 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s). Laberge et al. in Quebec in 1997 used this method in a study that confirmed the frequently found delayed circadian phase in healthy adolescents.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Laberge |first=L. |coauthors=Lesperance, P.; Tremblay, R.; Lambert, C.; Montplaisir, J. |year=1997 |title=Phase delay of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in normal adolescents |journal=Sleep Research |volume=26 |page=727 |publisher=Centre d'etude du Sommeil, Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur, Département de Psychologie, Département de Pharmacologie, Departement de Psychiatrie, Université de Montréal |location=Québec, Canada |url=http://www.websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?issn=19979287 |accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>

A third marker of the human pacemaker is the timing of the maximum plasma cortisol level. Klerman ''et al.'' in 2002 compared cortisol and temperature data to eight different analysis methods of plasma melatonin data, and found that "methods using plasma melatonin data may be considered more reliable than methods using CBT or cortisol data as an indicator of circadian phase in humans."<ref name="Klerman2002"/>

Other physiological changes which occur according to a circadian rhythm include heart rate and production of red blood cells.<ref name= "Volicer2001">{{cite journal |author=Volicer L, Harper DG, Manning BC, Goldstein R, Satlin A |title=Sundowning and circadian rhythms in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=5 |pages=704–11 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11329390 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.704 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/158/5/704}}</ref>

===Outside the "master clock"===
More-or-less independent circadian rhythms are found in many organs and cells in the body outside the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the "master clock". These clocks, called peripheral oscillators, are found in the [[oesophagus]], [[lungs]], [[liver]], [[pancreas]], [[spleen]], [[thymus]], and the skin.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Zanello, S.B.; Jackson, D.M.; Holick, M.F. |title=Expression of the circadian clock genes clock and period1 in human skin |journal=The Journal of Investigative Dermatology |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=757–60 |date=October 2000 |pmid=10998156 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1747.2000.00121.x}}</ref> Though oscillators in the skin respond to light, a systemic influence has not been proven so far.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Kawara, S. |title=Low-dose ultraviolet B rays alter the mRNA expression of the circadian clock genes in cultured human keratinocytes |journal=The Journal of Investigative Dermatology |volume=119 |issue=6 |pages=1220–3 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12485420 |doi= 10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.19619.x |last2=Mydlarski |first2=R. |last3=Mamelak |first3=A.J. |display-authors=4 |last4=Freed |first4=Irwin |last5=Wang |first5=Binghe |last6=Watanabe |first6=Hideaki |last7=Shivji |first7=Gulnar |last8=Tavadia |first8=Sherine K |last9=Suzuki |first9=Hirotake}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Campbell, S.S.; Murphy, P.J. |title=Extraocular circadian phototransduction in humans |journal=Science |volume=279 |issue=5349 |pages=396–9 |date=January 1998 |pmid=9430592 |doi=10.1126/science.279.5349.396|bibcode = 1998Sci...279..396C }}</ref> There is also some evidence that the olfactory bulb and prostate may experience oscillations when cultured, suggesting that these structures may also be weak oscillators.

Furthermore, liver cells, for example, appear to respond to feeding rather than to light. Cells from many parts of the body appear to have freerunning rhythms.

==Light and the biological clock==
{{further|Light effects on circadian rhythm}}
Light resets the biological clock in accordance with the [[phase response curve]] (PRC). Depending on the timing, light can advance or delay the circadian rhythm. Both the PRC and the required [[illuminance]] vary from species to species and lower light levels are required to reset the clocks in [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] rodents than in humans.

Lighting levels that affect the circadian rhythm in humans are higher than the levels usually used in artificial lighting in homes. According to some researchers<ref name=semj/> the illumination intensity that excites the circadian system has to reach up to 1000 [[lux]] striking the retina.

In addition to light intensity, wavelength (or colour) of light is a factor in the entrainment of the body clock. [[Melanopsin]] is most efficiently excited by light from the blue part of the spectrum (420–440&nbsp;nm<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Newman, L.A.; Walker, M.T.; Brown, R.L.; Cronin, T.W.; Robinson, P.R. |title=Melanopsin forms a functional short-wavelength photopigment |journal=Biochemistry |volume=42 |issue=44 |pages=12734–8 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14596587 |doi=10.1021/bi035418z}}</ref> according to some researchers while others have reported 470–485&nbsp;nm). These blue wavelengths are present in virtually all light sources, therefore their elimination requires special lights or filters which appear amber.

It is thought that the direction of the light may have an effect on entraining the circadian rhythm;<ref name=semj>{{Cite web |last=Semjonova |first=Milena |title=Healthy Lighting, from a lighting designer's perspective |url=http://www.enlighter.org/images/2009/01/healthyLighting.pdf |year=2003 |publisher=Milena Lighting Design}}</ref> light coming from above, resembling an image of a bright sky, has greater effect than light entering our eyes from below.

According to a 2010 study completed by the Lighting Research Center, daylight has a direct effect on circadian rhythms and, consequently, on performance and well-being. The research showed that students who experience disruption in lighting schemes in the morning consequently experience disruption in sleeping patterns. The change in sleeping patterns may lead to negatively impacted student performance and alertness. Removing circadian light in the morning delays the dim light melatonin onset by 6 minutes a day, for a total of 30 minutes for five days.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Figueiro, M.G.; Rea, M.S. |title= Lack of short-wavelength light during the school day delays dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) in middle school students |journal=Neuro Endocrinology Letters |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=92–6 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20150866}}</ref>

==Human health==
Timing of medical treatment in coordination with the body clock may significantly increase efficacy and reduce drug toxicity or adverse reactions.

[[File:Day Sleepers crop.jpg|thumb|right|A short nap during the day does not affect circadian rhythms.]]

===Obesity and diabetes===
[[Obesity]] and [[diabetes]] are associated with lifestyle and genetic factors. Among those factors, disruption of the circadian clockwork and/or misalignement of the circadian timing system with the external environment (e.g., light-dark cycle) play a role in the development of metabolic disorders.

[[Shift-work]] or chronic [[jet-lag]] have profound consequences on circadian and metabolic events in our body.

'''Sleep architecture''' describes the structure and pattern of [[sleep]], varying widely across species with differing patterns of phasing of rapid and non-rapid eye movement sleep ([[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] and [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM]]), and involving factors including sleep duration in a 24 hour period and circadian rhythm.<ref name="McNamara, P. 2010">McNamara, P., R.

===Circadian rhythm and airline pilots===
Due to the work nature of airline pilots, who often traverse multiple timezones and regions of sunlight and darkness in one day, and spend many hours awake both day and night, they are often unable to maintain sleep patterns that correspond to the natural human circadian rhythm; this situation can easily lead to [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]. The [[NTSB]] cites this situation as a contributing factor to many accidents<ref>http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/jsp_includes/articlePrint.jsp?storyID=news/FATIGex.xml&headLine=null Aviation Week Article</ref> and has conducted multiple research studies in order to find methods of combating fatigue in pilots.<ref>http://aeromedical.org/Articles/Pilot_Fatigue.html Pilot Fatigue Study</ref><ref>http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/05/15/pilot.fatigue.buffalo.crash/index.html CNN Article</ref>

===Disruption===
{{Further|Circadian rhythm sleep disorder}}
Disruption to rhythms usually has a negative effect. Many travellers have experienced the condition known as [[jet lag]], with its associated symptoms of [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], disorientation and [[insomnia]].

A number of other disorders, for example [[bipolar disorder]] and some [[sleep disorder]]s, are associated with irregular or pathological functioning of circadian rhythms. Recent research suggests that circadian rhythm disturbances found in [[bipolar disorder]] are positively influenced by [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]'s effect on clock genes.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Yin, L.; Wang, J.; Klein, P.S.; Lazar, M.A. |title=Nuclear receptor Rev-erbalpha is a critical lithium-sensitive component of the circadian clock |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5763 |pages=1002–5 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16484495 |doi= 10.1126/science.1121613 |laysummary=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2006/lithium-blocks-enzyme-to-help-cells-clocks-keep-on-tickin.shtml |laysource=[[National Institute of Mental Health]] |laydate=February 17, 2006|bibcode = 2006Sci...311.1002Y }}</ref>
