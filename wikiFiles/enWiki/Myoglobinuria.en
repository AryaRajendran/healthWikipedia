'''Myoglobinuria''' is the presence of [[myoglobin]] in the [[urine]], usually associated with [[rhabdomyolysis]] or muscle destruction. Myoglobin is present in [[muscle]] cells as a reserve of [[oxygen]].

==Causes==
[[Physical trauma|Trauma]], vascular problems, [[venom]]s, [[malignant hyperthermia]], certain drugs and other situations can destroy or damage the muscle, releasing myoglobin to the circulation and thus to the kidneys.

Under ideal situations myoglobin will be filtered and excreted with the urine, but if too much myoglobin is released into the circulation or in case of renal problems, it can occlude the renal filtration system leading to acute tubular necrosis and acute [[renal insufficiency]].

Other causes of myoglobinuria include:

==Diagnosis==
After centrifuging, the serum of myoglobinuria is clear, where the serum of [[hemoglobinuria]] after centrifuge is pink.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
