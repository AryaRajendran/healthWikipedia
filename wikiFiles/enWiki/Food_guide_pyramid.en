==Origin==
[[File:20111110-OC-AMW-0012 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|The "Basic Seven" developed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]]]

Amid high food prices in 1972, [[Sweden]]'s [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] developed the idea of "basic foods" that were both cheap and nutritious, and "supplemental foods" that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. Anna Britt Agnsäter, head of the [[test kitchen]] at [[Kooperativa Förbundet|KF]], a [[cooperative federation|consumer co-op]] that worked with the Board, held a lecture the next year on how to illustrate these food groups. Attendee Fjalar Clemes suggested a triangle displaying basic foods at the base. Agnsäter developed the idea into the first food pyramid, which was introduced to the public in 1974 in KF's ''[[:sv:Vi (tidning)|Vi]]'' magazine.<ref name=sw1>{{cite web |url=http://www.mersmak.kf.se/Toppmeny-startsida-/KFBibliotek/Kooperativ-kronika-startsida/Sok/KF-Kronika---Visa-artikel/?articleid=641 |title=Ett provkok blev provkök |language=swedish|date=2008-10-03 |publisher=kf.se |accessdate=2011-01-21}}</ref><ref name=sw2>{{cite web |url=http://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/OmKF/Kooperativ-samverkan/Var-historia1/Tidslinjen/1960-19901/1973/KF-Provkok-lanserar-iden-om-basmat/ |title=KF Provkök lanserar idén om basmat (engl.: KF test-kitchen introduces the idea of foodgroups) |language=swedish |year=1973 |publisher=coop.se |accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref><ref name=sw3>{{cite web|title=matpyramid|url=http://www.ne.se/matpyramid|work=Nationalencyklopedin|accessdate=7 June 2011|language=Swedish}}</ref> The pyramid was divided into basic foods at the base, including milk, cheese, margarine, bread, cereals and potatoes; a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit; and an apex of supplemental meat, fish and eggs. The pyramid competed with the National Board's "dietary circle," which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it, and food pyramids were developed in other [[Scandinavia]]n countries, as well as [[West Germany]], [[Japan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992. It could also signify the scientific version, which shows the amount of energy, see food pyramid of numbers or food pyramid of biomass

== Food Pyramid published by the WHO and FAO Joint Expert Consultation ==
The World Health Organization, in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, published guidelines that can effectively be represented in a food pyramid relating to objectives to prevent obesity, chronic diseases and dental caries based on meta-analysis <ref>Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation, 2003, "WHO Technical Report Series 916 Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases", page 56 table 6, Geneva</ref><ref>Diet, nutrition and the prevention of dental diseases, Public Health Nutrition: 7(1A), 201–226, Table 2</ref> though they represent it as a table rather than a "pyramid".  The structure is similar in some respects to the USDA food pyramid, but there are clear distinctions between types of fats, and a more dramatic distinction where carbohydrates are split on the basis of [[free sugar]]s versus sugars in their natural form.  Some food substances are singled out due to the impact on the target issues the "pyramid" is meant to address, while in a later revision, some recommendations are omitted since they follow automatically from other recommendations while other sub-categories are added.  The reports quoted here explain that where there is no stated lower limit in the table below, there is ''no'' requirement for that nutrient in the diet.

The representation as a pyramid is not precise, and involves variations due to the alternative percentages of different elements, but the main sections can be represented.
Note that the percentages expressed are by energy (joules or calories) and ''not'' by weight, hence free sugars, for example, since they are, by definition, more refined, should be significantly lower than 10% of intake when measured in food compared to other carbohydrates (those still in their natural form).

== USDA food pyramid ==
=== History ===
{{main|History of USDA nutrition guides}}
[[File:USDA Food Pyramid.gif|thumb|The USDA's original food pyramid from 1992.]]
[[File:MyPyramidFood.svg|thumb|The USDA's updated food pyramid from 2005, [[MyPyramid]].]]
The USDA food pyramid was created in 1992 and divided into six horizontal sections containing depictions of foods from each section's food group. It was updated in 2005 with colorful vertical wedges replacing the horizontal sections and renamed [[MyPyramid]]. MyPyramid was often displayed with the food images absent, creating a more abstract design. 
In an effort to restructure food nutrition guidelines, the USDA rolled out its new [[MyPlate]] program in June 2011.  My Plate is divided into four slightly different sized quadrants, with fruits and vegetables taking up half the space, and grains and protein making up the other half.  The vegetables and grains portions are the largest of the four.

=== Food groups ===
{{main|Food groups}}

==== Vegetables ====
A [[vegetable]] is a part of a plant consumed by humans that is generally savory but is not sweet. A vegetable is not considered a grain, fruit, [[nut (fruit)|nut]], [[spice]], or [[herb]]. For example, the [[Plant stem|stem]], [[root]], [[flower]], etc., may be eaten as vegetables. Vegetables contain many [[vitamin]]s and [[Dietary minerals|minerals]]; however, different vegetables contain different spreads, so it is important to eat a wide variety of types. For example, green vegetables typically contain [[vitamin A]], dark orange and dark green vegetables contain [[vitamin C]],and vegetables like broccoli and related plants contain [[iron]] and [[calcium]]. Vegetables are very low in [[fat]]s and [[calorie]]s, but ingredients added in preparation can often add these.

==== Fruits ====
In terms of food (rather than botany), [[fruit]]s are the sweet-tasting [[seed]]-bearing parts of plants, or occasionally sweet parts of plants which do not bear seeds.
These include [[apple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[plum]]s, [[banana]]s, etc. Fruits are low in calories and fat and are a source of natural [[sugar]]s, [[fiber]] and vitamins. Processing fruits when [[canning]] or making into [[juice]]s may add sugars and remove nutrients. The fruit food group is sometimes combined with the vegetable food group. Note that many foods considered fruits in botany because they bear seeds are '''not''' considered fruits in [[cuisine]] because they lack the characteristic sweet taste, e.g., [[tomato]]s or [[avocado]]s.

==== Oils ====
The food pyramid advises that fats be consumed sparingly. [[Butter]] and [[oil]]s are examples of fats. Healthy sources of fat can be found in fish, nuts, and certain fruits and vegetables, such as avocados.

==== Dairy ====
[[Dairy product]]s are produced from the [[milk]] of [[mammal]]s, most usually but not exclusively [[cattle]]. They include milk, [[yogurt]] and [[cheese]]. Milk and its derivative products are a rich source of dietary calcium, but also provide protein, [[phosphorus]], vitamin A, and [[vitamin D]]. However, many dairy products are high in saturated fat and cholesterol compared to vegetables, fruits and whole grains, which is why skimmed products are available as an alternative.
For adults, three cups of dairy products are recommended per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document/pdf/Chapter5.pdf |title=7773-DGA_V7 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3aday.org/About-3-A-Day/Pages/About-3-A-Day.aspx |title=About 3-A-Day |publisher=3aday.org |date=2006-09-10 |accessdate=2009-09-28}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==== Meat and beans ====
[[Meat]] is the [[Biological tissue|tissue]] – usually [[muscle]] – of an [[animal]] consumed by humans. Since most parts of many animals are edible, there is a vast variety of meats. Meat is a major source of [[protein]], as well as iron, [[zinc]], and [[vitamin B12]]. Meats, poultry, and fish include [[beef]], [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[pork]], [[salmon]], [[tuna]], [[shrimp]], and [[egg (food)|eggs]].

The meat group is one of the major compacted food groups in the food guide pyramid. Many of the same nutrients found in meat can also be found in foods like [[egg (food)|eggs]], dry [[bean]]s, and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], such foods are typically placed in the same category as meats, as '''meat alternatives'''. These include [[tofu]], products that resemble [[meat]] or [[fish (food)|fish]] but are made with [[soybean|soy]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], and [[cheese]]s. For those who do not consume meat or animal products (''see [[Vegetarianism]], [[veganism]] and [[Taboo food and drink]]''), [[meat analog]]s, [[tofu]], beans, lentils, chick peas, nuts and other high-protein vegetables are also included in this group.  The food guide pyramid suggests that adults eat 2–3 servings per day. One serving of meat is {{convert|4|oz|abbr=on}}, about the size of a deck of cards.

===Controversy===
Many nutritional experts, like Harvard nutritionist Dr. Walter Willett, believe the 1992 pyramid does not reflect the latest research on dietetics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/pyramid-full-story/index.html#intro |title=Food Pyramids: What Should You Really Eat? |publisher=www.hsph.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref> Certain dietary choices that have been linked to heart disease, such as three cups of whole milk and an {{convert|8|oz|abbr=on}}, serving of hamburger daily, were technically permitted under the pyramid. The pyramid also lacked differentiation within the protein-rich group ("Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs, and Nuts").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/pyramid-full-story/index.html#dga2005 |title=Dietary Guidelines 2005: Two Steps Forward, One Step Back |publisher=www.hsph.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref>

Some of the recommended quantities for the different types of food in the old pyramid have also come under criticism for lack of clarity. For instance, the pyramid recommends two to three servings from the protein-rich group, but this is intended to be a maximum. The pyramid recommends two to four fruit servings, but this is intended to be the minimum.<ref>{{cite book

The fats group as a whole have been put at the tip of the pyramid, under the direction to eat as little as possible, which is largely problematic. Under the guide, one would assume to avoid fats and fatty foods, which can lead to health problems. For one, fat is essential in a person's general sustainability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/86/2/587 |title=On The Nature And Rôle Of The Fatty Acids Essential In Nutrition—Jbc

===Alternatives===
The Harvard School of Public Health proposes the [[Healthy eating pyramid]], which includes calcium and multi-vitamin supplements as well as moderate amounts of alcohol, as an alternative to the Food Guide Pyramid.

Many observers{{Who|date=August 2011}} believe that the Harvard pyramid follows the results of nutrition studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals more closely.

In their book ''[[Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever]]'', published in 2004, Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman M.D., point out that the guidelines provided in the Harvard Pyramid fail to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy oils. In addition, whole-grain foods are given more priority than vegetables, which should not be the case, as vegetables have a lower glycemic load. Other observations are that fish should be given a higher priority due to its high omega-3 content, and that high fat dairy products should be excluded. As an alternative, the authors postulate a new food pyramid, emphasising low glycemic-load vegetables, healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts and seeds, lean animal protein, fish, and extra virgin olive oil.

The University of Michigan Integrative Medicine’s Healing Foods Pyramid emphasizes plant-based choices, variety and balance. It includes sections for seasonings and water as well as healthy fats.
