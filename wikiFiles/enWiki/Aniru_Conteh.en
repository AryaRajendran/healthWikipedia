'''Aniru Sahib Sahib Conteh''' (August 6, 1942 – April 4, 2004) was a [[Sierra Leonean]] physician and expert on the clinical treatment of [[Lassa fever]], a [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] endemic to [[West Africa]] caused by the [[Lassa virus]]. Conteh studied medicine at the [[University of Ibadan]] in Nigeria and taught at Ibadan Teaching Hospital. He later returned to Sierra Leone where he joined the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) Lassa fever program at Nixon Methodist Hospital in Segbwema, first as superintendent and then as clinical director.  

After the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] began in 1991, the CDC closed their program in Segbwema. Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), where he spent the next two decades running the only dedicated Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity [[Medical Emergency Relief International|Merlin]] to [[Health promotion|promote public health]] in Sierra Leone through education and [[awareness campaign]]s intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and [[#Legacy|saved many lives]] until an accidental [[needlestick injury]] led to his own death from the disease in 2004. 

Conteh received renewed public attention in 2009 as the hero of Ross I. Donaldson's memoir, ''The Lassa Ward''.

==Early life, education, and teaching==
Aniru Sahib Sahib Conteh was born on August 6, 1942, in the town of Jawi Folu, [[Eastern Province, Sierra Leone]], the son of a farmer and chief of the village.<ref name="Wright"/>  He moved to [[Freetown]], the capital of Sierra Leone, after his mother died while he was in his teens. Conteh studied chemistry and biology at [[Fourah Bay College]] and began teaching after receiving his BSc. In 1968, he began studying medicine in Nigeria at the modern [[University of Ibadan]], graduating in 1974. Conteh spent the next four years employed by the Ibadan Teaching Hospital. He returned home to Sierra Leone in 1979.<ref name="RD09">{{harvnb|Donaldson|2009|pp=66–68}}</ref>  Conteh married and raised a family with his wife Sarah, producing several sons and daughters.<ref>Some sources report four sons, others report three; {{harvnb|Mellor|2004b}}, "four sons, two daughters"; {{harvnb|Mellor|2004a}}: "three sons and two daughters"; {{harvnb|Wright|2004}}, "four sons, and two daughters"; {{harvnb|Bausch|Sesay|Oshin|2004}}, "three sons, and two daughters".</ref>

==Medical career==
Conteh spent his professional career working with patients suffering from [[Lassa fever]], a [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] endemic to [[West Africa]].   Lassa fever was first brought to the attention of the public in 1969 during an outbreak in Nigeria.<ref>{{harvnb|Keane|Gilles|1977|p=1399}}; {{harvnb|Bausch|Sesay|Oshin|2004|pp=1889–1890}}</ref>  Identified in 1972, the disease is known to spread through its host, the [[Natal multimammate mouse]] (''Mastomys natalensis''), and infects an estimated 300,000 people and results in 5000 deaths annually in [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], and [[Guinea]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lives in Brief|2004}}; {{harvnb|Khan|Goba|Chu|Roth|2008}}</ref>  In 1976, a [[nosocomial infection|nosocomial]] outbreak in the Panguma Catholic Hospital attracted attention in the United States. In response, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) established research programs in Segbwema, Kenema, and Panguma to study the disease.<ref>{{harvnb|Mellor|2004a|p=1078}}; {{harvnb|Bausch|Sesay|Oshin|2004|p=1889}}</ref>

===Nixon Methodist Hospital===
[[File:Aniru Conteh CDC Lassa Documentary 1989.jpg|thumb|Aniru Conteh in a 1989 CDC documentary about Lassa fever]]
In 1979, Conteh began working with the CDC and team leader [[Joseph B. McCormick]] at the Nixon Methodist Hospital in [[Segbwema]]. Conteh became Medical Superintendent of the hospital in 1980.<ref name="Bausch">{{harvnb|Bausch|Sesay|Oshin|2004|pp=1889–1890}}</ref> The [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] broke out in 1991, forcing the CDC to close their program and move to Guinea. The hospital was destroyed in the conflict and the spread of Lassa fever grew worse. During the civil war, the Natal multimammate mouse infested abandoned houses, increasing the likelihood of infection.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2004|p=1831}}; {{harvnb|Melone|2009}}: Rat meat is an important source of protein in this region, and if the animal is carrying the disease the virus can be killed by boiling the meat. However, infection can take place during the process of finding and preparing the rats for consumption. The virus is transmitted through rat urine and feces, which can enter the body through inhalation, eating food contaminated with excreta, or through skin absorption.</ref>

===Kenema Government Hospital===
Conteh now found himself in the middle of a war zone, starving and homeless.<ref>{{harvnb|Donaldson|2009|p=67}}: "I was so shocked. I had no idea what to do. There was no food or even a safe place to sleep."  Hungry and in a state of perpetual danger, he wandered for months around the countryside. "At some point," he said, "I even became numb to the fear."</ref>  He wandered about for several months and finally came to [[Kenema]] where he began treating the sick in the midst of the fighting. Although he had friends overseas, and could have procured a job outside Sierra Leone, he chose to stay and help his people because "they had no one to help them".<ref name="RD09"/>  Due to the war, most experts familiar with Lassa fever had left the country, and patients suspected of having the disease began to be brought to Conteh for treatment.<ref name="RD09"/>  The Lassa team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). In Kenema, Conteh became director of the only Lassa fever [[Isolation ward (medicine)|isolation ward]] in the world.<ref name="Wright">{{harvnb|Wright|2004|p=1831}}</ref>  Rebels from the [[Revolutionary United Front]] took over the town of Kenema in 1997 and 1999, but Conteh never left his post.<ref>{{harvnb|Obituary: Dr Aniru Conteh|2004}}; {{harvnb|Mellor|2004b}}</ref>  It is thought that the rebels spared the hospital from destruction because they were afraid of catching Lassa fever.<ref name="Wright"/>  When the [[Sierra_Leone_Civil_War#After_the_war|civil war ended in 2002]], the government of Sierra Leone began the process of rebuilding the country.<ref name="mhirt">{{harvnb|MHIRT|2009}}</ref>

===Contributions to medicine===
[[File:CIASierraLeoneKenema.jpg|thumb|Conteh established the Lassa Isolation Ward at Kenema Government Hospital after the CDC moved its facilities to Guinea due to the civil war in Sierra Leone<ref name="Kenema Government Hospital, 2011">{{harvnb|Kenema Government Hospital|2011}}</ref>]]
During the civil war, Conteh was the only clinician in Sierra Leone who had the skills and qualifications to manage patients with Lassa fever.<ref name="Gayer">{{harvnb|Gayer|Gopal|Salter|2003|pp=6, 8}}</ref>  In the absence of the CDC, the Lassa ward was supported by [[Medical Emergency Relief International|Merlin]], a medical relief agency based in the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|Bausch|Sesay|Oshin|2004|p=1889}}; {{harvnb|Khan|Goba|Chu|Roth|2008|p=104}}; {{harvnb|Morris|Calisher|1997|p=1458}};{{harvnb|Wright|2004|p=1831}}</ref> According to Nicholas Mellor, co-founder of Merlin, "Conteh worked with Merlin to get a new laboratory built that would enable collaboration with international research centres with an interest in haemorrhagic diseases. He also worked on training and Lassa fever awareness campaigns."<ref name="Mellor2004a">{{harvnb|Mellor|2004a|p=1078}}</ref></blockquote>  Conteh's Lassa fever program "provided the blueprint for many experts".<ref>{{harvnb|Mellor|2004a|p=1078}}; For more information about the important role of Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), see {{harvnb|Okeke|2011|p=85}}</ref>  In 1996, Daniel Bausch at the [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine]] began working with Conteh and the CDC on research related to Lassa fever.<ref name="Mellor2004a"/>

In 2000, Conteh coauthored a study published in the ''[[Journal of Clinical Microbiology]]'' comparing the efficacy and outcome of diagnosing Lassa fever patients with the [[indirect fluorescent-antibody]] (IFA) test and the [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA). According to Iruka N. Okeke, the study "focused specifically on the development of a diagnostic test for Lassa fever".<ref>{{harvnb|Okeke|2011|p=87}}; {{harvnb|Bausch|Sesay|Oshin|2004|pp=1889–1890}}; {{harvnb|Bausch et al.|2000|pp=2670–2677}}</ref> In 2001, Conteh traveled to London, England to attend an international conference on Lassa fever where he presented a paper on managing the disease.<ref name="independent">{{harvnb|Mellor|2004b}}</ref>  Conteh returned to London in September 2003 to receive the "Spirit of Merlin" award for his outstanding role in "saving lives and alleviating suffering".<ref>{{harvnb|Mellor|2004b}}; {{harvnb|Merlin's 10th Year Anniversary Awards Event|2003}}</ref>

==Death==
The Lassa ward was short-staffed, and Conteh would often draw blood from patients himself.<ref name="d262">{{harvnb|Donaldson|2009|pp=261–262}}; A 2003 WHO/UNHCR report recommended the hiring of additional support staff for Conteh in 2003. See {{harvnb|Gayer|Gopal|Salter|2003|pp=6, 8}}</ref>  On March 17, 2004,<ref name="Mellor2004a" /> Conteh was infected with the Lassa virus when he received a [[needlestick injury]] while drawing blood from a young pregnant nurse suffering from the disease. The nurse died the next day, and Conteh himself became ill on March 23. As his condition worsened, he was treated with intravenous [[ribavirin]]. Conteh initially survived the critical stage of Lassa fever, but died on April 4 from [[renal failure]]—18 days after first becoming infected with the Lassa virus.<ref name="Wright"/><ref name="d262" />  Reporter Sulaiman Momodu described the outpouring of grief in the wake of Conteh's death:

<blockquote>News of his death spread in Kenema and its environs like a bush fire in the harmattan. Most people were devastated to learn that the only Lassa Fever specialist in Sierra Leone was gone, gone forever. Nurses cried, patients wept. Kenema was thrown into a state of shock and mourning.<ref name="Momodu">{{harvnb|Momodu|2004}}; {{harvnb|Mirza et al.|2005}}</ref></blockquote>

Conteh's funeral was held in the town of [[Daru, Sierra Leone|Daru]].<ref name="Momodu"/>

==Legacy==
Conteh's work in the Lassa ward spanned 25 years and saved thousands of lives.<ref>{{harvnb|Bausch|Sesay|Oshin|2004|p=1889}}; {{harvnb|Wright|2004|p=1831}}: "He spent much of his professional life fighting the disease, and saved thousands of lives by developing a regimen of intensive medical care."</ref>  He played a key role in helping Merlin implement a program to support the Lassa ward and fever control measures in Sierra Leone. Because of his skill and dedication, deaths due to cases of suspected Lassa fever declined by 20%.<ref>{{harvnb|Mellor|2004b}}: "His skill in diagnosis and treatment was unparalleled, and resulted in a reduction in mortality of suspected Lassa fever cases to around 20 per cent."  However, Okeke reports that Conteh's "clinical research and treatment advances contributed greatly to an 80 percent reduction in mortality from the disease by 2000."  See {{harvnb|Okeke|2011|p=86}}</ref>  After Conteh's death, Merlin and the peacekeepers in the [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone]] (UNAMSIL) left Sierra Leone and the Lassa ward in Kenema was barely functioning. In 2004, [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|Tulane University]], in coordination with the [[World Health Organization]], began monitoring Lassa fever patients in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea through the Mano River Union Lassa Fever Network (MRU-LFN).<ref>{{harvnb|Kenema Government Hospital|2011}}; {{harvnb|Melone|2009}}</ref>  Today, the Lassa Fever Program is fully operational at Kenema Government Hospital, and focuses on "treatment, containment, prevention and research".<ref name="Kenema Government Hospital, 2011"/>

Conteh was the mentor for UCLA medical professor Ross I. Donaldson in the summer of 2003, and is the hero of Donaldson's 2009 memoir, ''The Lassa Ward''.<ref name="Thomas">{{harvnb|Thomas|2009|p=M6}}; {{harvnb|Heim|2009}}; {{harvnb|Soderburg|2009}}; {{harvnb|Zuger|2009|p=D5}}</ref>
