The '''MMR vaccine''' is an [[immunization]] vaccine against [[measles]], [[mumps]], and [[rubella]] (also called German measles). It is a mixture of live [[attenuated virus]]es of the three diseases, administered via injection. It was first developed by [[Maurice Hilleman]] while at [[Merck & Co.|Merck]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Offit PA |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=0-06-122796-X |year=2007 }}</ref>

A licensed [[vaccine]] to prevent measles first became available in 1963, an improved measles vaccine in 1968. Vaccines for the mumps and rubella (German measles) became available in 1967 and 1969, respectively. The three vaccines (for mumps, measles, and rubella) were combined in 1971 to become the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.<ref>[http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4209.pdf ''Measles: Questions and Answers,''] [http://www.immunize.org/ Immunization Action Coalition].</ref>

The MMR vaccine is generally administered to children around the age of one year, with a second dose before starting school (i.e. age 4/5). The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2–5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose.<ref name=CDC-MMR-FAQ/> In the United States, the vaccine was licensed in 1971 and the second dose was introduced in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Banatvala JE, Brown DW |title=Rubella |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9415 |pages=1127–37 |year=2004 |pmid=15064032 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15897-2}}</ref>
It is widely used around the world; since introduction of its earliest versions in the 1970s, over 500 million doses have been used in over 60 countries.  As with all [[vaccination]]s, long-term effects and [[efficacy]] are subject to continuing study.  The vaccine is sold by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] as M-M-R II, [[GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals]] as Priorix, [[Serum Institute of India]] as Tresivac, and [[Sanofi Pasteur]] as Trimovax.

It is usually considered a childhood vaccination. However, it is also recommended for use in some cases of adults with [[HIV]].<ref name="urlCase 4: Discussion - Appropriate Vaccinations - Initial Evaluation - HIV Web Study">{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/hivaids/initial/case4/discussion.html |title=Case 4: Discussion - Appropriate Vaccinations - Initial Evaluation - HIV Web Study |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="urlMeasles, Mumps, and Rubella -- Vaccine Use and Strategies for Elimination of Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome and Control of Mumps: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm |title=Measles, Mumps, and Rubella -- Vaccine Use and Strategies for Elimination of Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome and Control of Mumps: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Effectiveness==
[[File:Measles US 1944-2007 inset.png| alt=Measles cases 1944-1963 followed a highly variable epidemic pattern, with 150,000-850,000 cases reported per year. A sharp decline followed introduction of the first measles vaccine in 1963, with fewer than 25,000 cases reported in 1968. Outbreaks around 1971 and 1977 gave 75,000 and 57,000 cases, respectively. Cases were stable at a few thousand per year until an outbreak of 28,000 in 1990. Cases declined from a few hundred per year in the early 1990s to a few dozen in the 2000s. | thumb | Measles cases reported in the [[United States]] fell dramatically after introduction of the measles vaccine.]]

Increasing uptake of the vaccine following outbreaks in 1971 and 1977 brought this down to thousands of cases per year in the 1980s. An outbreak of almost 30,000 cases in 1990 led to a renewed push for vaccination and the addition of a second vaccine to the recommended schedule.

The benefit of measles vaccination in preventing illness, disability, and death has been well documented. The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of [[mental retardation]], and 5,200 deaths.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bloch AB, Orenstein WA, Stetler HC ''et al.'' |title=Health impact of measles vaccination in the United States |journal=Pediatrics |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=524–32 |year=1985 |pmid=3931045}}</ref> During 1999–2004, a strategy led by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]] led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=9 |pages=247–9 |title= Progress in reducing global measles deaths, 1999–2004 |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |pmid=16528234 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5509a8.htm}}</ref>

Measles is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] worldwide. Although it was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, high rates of vaccination and good communication with persons who refuse vaccination is needed to prevent outbreaks and sustain the elimination of measles in the U.S.<ref name=Parker/> Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated individual who acquired measles during a visit to [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=50 |pages=1348–51 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5550a2.htm |title= Measles—United States, 2005 |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |pmid=17183226}}</ref> This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children.

[[Mumps]] is another [[virus|viral]] [[disease]] of childhood that was once very common.  If mumps is acquired by a male who is past [[puberty]], a possible complication is bilateral [[orchitis]] which can in some cases lead to [[infertility|sterility]].<ref>

[[File:Rubella-us-1966-93-cdc.gif|thumb|Rubella fell sharply when immunization was introduced.]]  [[Rubella]], otherwise known as German measles, was also very common before the advent of widespread vaccination. The major risk of rubella is in pregnancy. If a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman is infected, her baby may contract [[congenital rubella syndrome|congenital rubella]] from her, which can cause significant [[congenital]] defects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccineInfo/vaccine_detail.cfv?id=24 |accessdate=2007-09-02 |date=2006-09-25 |title= Rubella vaccine information |publisher= National Network for Immunization Information}}</ref>

All three diseases are highly contagious.

The combined MMR vaccine was introduced to induce immunity less painfully than three separate injections at the same time, and sooner and more efficiently than three injections given on different dates.

In 2012, the [[Cochrane Library]] published a [[systematic review]] of scientific studies. Its authors concluded, "Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication and in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with mumps and rubella."<ref name=CD004407/>

==Development, formulation and administration==
[[File:Preparation of measles vaccines.jpg|thumb|Two workers make openings in chicken eggs in preparation for a measles vaccine]]
The component viral strains of MMR vaccine were developed by propagation in animal and human cells.  The live viruses require animal or human cells as a host for production of more virus.

For example, in the case of mumps and measles viruses, the virus strains were grown in embryonated hens' eggs and chick embryo cell cultures.  This produced strains of virus which were adapted for the hens egg and less well-suited for human cells.  These strains are therefore called ''[[Vaccination#Types of vaccinations|attenuated]] strains''.  They are sometimes referred to as ''neuroattenuated'' because these strains are less [[virulence|virulent]] to human neurons than the wild strains.

The Cochrane Library review found that, compared to placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects. The review also found several problems in the quality of MMR vaccine safety studies, and recommended the adoption of standardized definitions of adverse events. The review's abstract concludes, "The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate.
