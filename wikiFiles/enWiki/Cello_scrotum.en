'''Cello scrotum''' is a [[hoax]] medical condition originally published as a brief [[case report]] in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1974.<ref name="BMJ, Murphy, 1974"/><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink=|title=Peer reveals 'cello scrotum' hoax |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/health/7853564.stm |quote=A top doctor has admitted her part in hoodwinking a leading [[medical journal]] after inventing a medical condition called "cello scrotum". |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='Cello scrotum' exposed as a hoax |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/28/uk.cello.scrotum.hoax/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |quote=A medical ailment that has worried male members of string sections across the music world for over 30 years has been exposed as a hoax. |work=[[CNN]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> As its name suggests, it was purportedly an affliction of the [[scrotum]] affecting male players of the [[cello]].

==History==

The original letter<ref name="BMJ, Murphy, 1974" >{{cite journal|journal=[[BMJ|Br Med J]]|last=Murphy |first=J M|title=Letter: Cello scrotum|year=1974|month=May|volume=2|issue=5914|page=335|pmid=4827125|pmc=1610985}}</ref> was written by Dr [[Elaine Murphy, Baroness Murphy|Elaine Murphy]] but signed by her husband as a joke to compare with a previous letter regarding 'guitar nipple',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Curtis P |title=Letter: Guitar nipple |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5912 |pages=226 |year=1974 |month=April |pmid=4857619 |pmc=1610876 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.5912.226-a|url=}}</ref> a condition reportedly occurring when some styles of [[guitar]] playing excessively irritate the player's [[nipple]] (a form of [[Contact_dermatitis#Physical_irritant_contact_dermatitis|contact dermatitis]] similar to [[jogger's nipple]]), which Murphy and her husband believed was likely a joke.

Murphy now points out that even a cursory study of the cellist's [[Cello#Body_position|posture]] would show that the 'cello scrotum' complaint would not occur. The unlikelihood of a cellist's posture contributing to scrotal injury was raised back in 1974, but seems to have been overlooked.<ref name="BMJ, Scheuer, 1974" >{{cite journal|journal=[[BMJ|Br Med J]]|last=Scheuer |first=P J|title=Musical Bumps|year=1974|month=June|volume=2|issue=5917|page=504|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pdf_extract/2/5917/504-a|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5917.504-a|last2=Gillingham|first2=J.}}</ref>
