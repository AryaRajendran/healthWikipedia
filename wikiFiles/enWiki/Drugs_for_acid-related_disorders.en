There are several classes of '''drugs for acid-related disorders''', such as [[dyspepsia]], [[peptic ulcer disease]] (PUD), [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GORD/GERD), or [[laryngopharyngeal reflux]].

The [[World Health Organization]] gives drugs in these classes the categorization code [[ATC code A02]].

==H<sub>2</sub> antagonists==
{{main|H2 receptor antagonists}}
The '''H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists''' are a class of [[medication|drugs]] used to block the action of [[histamine]] on [[parietal cell]]s in the [[stomach]], decreasing the production of [[acid]] by these cells. H<sub>2</sub> antagonists are used in the treatment of [[dyspepsia]], although they have been surpassed in popularity by the more effective<ref>Eriksson S, Långström G, Rikner L, Carlsson R, Naesdal J. Omeprazole and H2-receptor antagonists in the acute treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis: a meta-analysis [published correction appears in Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1996;8:192]. Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1995;7:467-475</ref> [[proton pump inhibitor]]s.

H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists are named using the suffix "-tidine".

==Proton-pump inhibitors==
{{main|Proton-pump inhibitors}}

'''Proton-pump inhibitors''' ('''PPIs''') are a group of [[Medication|drug]]s whose main action is a pronounced and long-lasting reduction of [[gastric acid]] production. They are the most potent inhibitors of acid secretion available. The group followed and has largely superseded another group of [[pharmacology|pharmaceuticals]] with similar effects, but a different mode of action, called [[H2-receptor antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists]]. These drugs are among the most widely sold drugs in the world, and are generally considered effective.<ref>{{cite web |author=The Health Strategies Consultancy LLC |title=Follow The Pill: Understanding the U.S. Commercial Pharmaceutical Supply Chain |publisher=The Kaiser Family Foundation |month=March |year=2005 |url=http://www.kff.org/rxdrugs/7296.cfm}}</ref>

Proton-pump inhibitors are named using the suffix "-prazole".

==Prostaglandins==
{{main|Prostaglandins}}
A '''prostaglandin''' is any member of a group of [[lipid]] compounds that are derived enzymatically from [[fatty acid]]s and have important functions in the [[animal]] body. Every prostaglandin contains 20 [[carbon]] atoms, including a 5-carbon ring.

They are mediators and have a variety of strong [[physiology|physiological]] effects, such as regulating the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue.<ref name="isbn0-87893-617-3">{{cite book |author=Nelson, Randy F. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=An introduction to behavioral endocrinology |edition=3rd |language= |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2005 |origyear= |pages=100 |quote= |isbn=0-87893-617-3 |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> There are many prostaglandins with many effects. [[Prostaglandin E2]] has effects including reducing gastric acid and increasing gastric mucus, which among other effects treat acid-related disorders.

Prostaglandins are named using the root term "-prost-".		

==Other drugs==	
Other drugs which have been used to treat acid-related disorders are not part of the above categories and function through a variety of mechanisms.
