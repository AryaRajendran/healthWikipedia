'''Salicylate testing''' is a category of [[drug testing]] that is focused on detecting salicylates such as [[salicylic acid|acetysalicylic acid]] for either biochemical or medical purposes.

== Analytical ==
Salicylates can be identified by [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GC/MS]], [[proton NMR]], and [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]].

== In vitro ==

One of the first ''in vitro'' tests for aspirin was through the [[Trinder reaction]]. [[Aqueous]] [[ferric chloride]] was added to a urine sample, and the formation of the iron complex turned the solution purple. This test was not specific to [[acetylsalicylic acid]] but would occur in the presence of any [[phenol]] or [[enol]]. The downfall of this test occurs in the presence of hyperbilirubinemia or elevated [[bilirubin]].  When the level of bilirubin exceeds 1 [[Milligram|mg]]/[[Litre|dl]], a [[false positive]] could occur.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

== Enzyme Specific Assay ==

The current ''in vitro'' testing utilizes molecule specific methods of detecting salicylates.<ref>[http://www.cambridgelifesciences.co.uk/downloads/Ifu/Salicylate%20IFU%20K5056%20v04.pdf]</ref>

== Immunoassay ==

Another identification mechanism is through [[immunoassay]].  [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott Labs']] [[Axsym|AxSYM]] is an immunoassay device utilizing Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA) technology that can determine the presence and quantify salicylates.  The introduction of a salicylate specific [[antigen]] labeled with [[fluorescein]] into the sample will mark the sample.  Upon irradiation with 490[[nanometer|nm]] light, some of that light will be reflected back to a detector at 520[[nanometer|nm]].  Polarization allows the machine to detect the difference between [[antibody]] bound, and unbound fluorescein.  It is therefore possible to quantify the [[Blood serum|serum]] salicylate level through the signal strengthâ€”the amount of reflected light received.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}
