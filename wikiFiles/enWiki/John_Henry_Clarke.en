'''John Henry Clarke''' [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] (1853 – November 24, 1931 was a prominent [[England|English]] classical [[homeopath]]. He was also, arguably, the most important anti-Semite in [[Great Britain]]. He led [[The Britons]], an anti-Semitic organisation.

Dr. Clarke was a busy practitioner. As a physician he not only had his own clinic in  [[Piccadilly]], [[London]], but he also was a consultant at the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] and researched into new remedies — [[nosode]]s.

==Politics==

Clarke was a leading advocate of [[anti-Semitism]] and served as president of [[The Britons]] from its formation{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} in 1919 until his death as an associate of [[Henry Hamilton Beamish]]. He wrote several articles on Christianity that have a militant bent. When Beamish became a fugitive and fled England, Clarke became the head of The Britons, and formed with two others a splinter organization, the [[Britons Publishing Society]].

== Works ==

Clarke was keen in his writing and it is even said that he had a desk in his carriage {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. For many years, he was the  editor of ''The Homeopathic World''.  He wrote many books, his best known were ''Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica'' and ''Repertory of Materia Medica'' (i.e., the ''Clinical Repertory''), both of which are recommended by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]'s rules on "Conditions under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed".<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgdrg/cpg400-400.html FDA/ORA CPG 7132.15<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.fda.gov</ref>
