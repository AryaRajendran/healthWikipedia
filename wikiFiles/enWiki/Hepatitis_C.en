'''Hepatitis C''' is an [[infectious disease]] affecting primarily the [[liver]], caused by the [[hepatitis C virus]] (HCV).<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | pages=551–2 | isbn = 0838585299 | editor = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) }}</ref> The infection is often [[asymptomatic]], but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to [[cirrhosis]], which is generally apparent after many years. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will go on to develop [[liver failure]], [[hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] or life-threatening [[esophageal varices|esophageal]] and [[gastric varices]].<ref name=Sherris/>

HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with [[intravenous drug use]], poorly sterilized medical equipment and [[blood transfusions|transfusions]].

The virus persists in the liver in about 85% of those infected. This persistent infection can be treated with medication: the standard therapy is a combination of [[peginterferon]] and [[ribavirin]], with either [[boceprevir]] or [[telaprevir]] added in some cases. Overall, 50–80% of people treated are cured. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a [[liver transplant]]. {{nowrap|Hepatitis C}} is the leading cause of liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation.<ref name=NEJM2011/> No [[vaccine]] against {{nowrap|hepatitis C}} is available.

Liver cirrhosis may lead to [[portal hypertension]], [[ascites]] (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen), [[coagulopathy|easy bruising or bleeding]], varices (enlarged veins, especially in the stomach and esophagus), [[jaundice]], and a syndrome of cognitive impairment known as [[hepatic encephalopathy]].

==Transmission==

Hospital equipment has also been documented as a method of transmission of {{nowrap|hepatitis C}} including: reuse of needles and syringes, multiple-use medication vials, infusion bags, and improperly sterilized surgical equipment, among others.<ref name=World2007/> Limitations in the implementation and enforcement of stringent standard precautions in public and private medical and dental facilities are known to be the primary cause of the spread of HCV in [[Egypt]], the country with highest rate of infection in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.albawaba.com/en/news/highest-rates-hepatitis-c-virus-transmission-found-egypt |title=Highest Rates of Hepatitis C Virus Transmission Found in Egypt |publisher=Al Bawaaba |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>

Testing is not able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections.<ref name=World2007/>

===Serology===
{{nowrap|Hepatitis C}} testing typically begins with [[serology|blood testing]] to detect the presence of antibodies to the HCV using an enzyme immunoassay.<ref name=AFP2010/> If this test is positive, a confirmatory test is then performed to verify the immunoassay and to determine the [[viral load]].<ref name=AFP2010/> A recombinant immunoblot assay is used to verify the immunoassay and the viral load is determined by a HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction.<ref name=AFP2010/> If there are no RNA and the immunoblot is positive it means that the person had a previous infection but cleared it either with treatment or spontaneously; if the immunoblot is negative, it means that the immunoassay was wrong.<ref name=AFP2010/> It takes about 6–8 weeks following infection before the immunoassay will test positive.<ref name=ID2010/> A number of tests are available as [[point of care testing]] which means that results are available within 30&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shivkumar|first=S|coauthors=Peeling, R; Jafari, Y; Joseph, L; Pant Pai, N|title=Accuracy of Rapid and Point-of-Care Screening Tests for Hepatitis C: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2012 Oct 16|volume=157|issue=8|pages=558–66|pmid=23070489}}</ref>

Liver enzymes are variable during the initial part of the infection<ref name=Book2011/> and on average begin to rise at seven weeks after infection.<ref name=ID2010/> Liver enzymes are poorly correlated with disease severity.<ref name=ID2010/>

===Biopsy===
[[Liver biopsy|Liver biopsies]] are used to determine the degree of liver damage present; however, there are risks from the procedure.<ref name=NEJM2011/> The typical changes seen are [[lymphocyte]]s within the parenchyma, [[lymphoid follicles]] in [[portal triad]], and changes to the bile ducts.<ref name=NEJM2011/> There are a number of blood tests available that try to determine the degree of [[hepatic fibrosis]] and alleviate the need for biopsy.<ref name=NEJM2011/>

===Screening===
It is believed only 5–50% of those infected in the United States and Canada become aware of their status.<ref name=Tato2010/> Testing is recommended in those at high risk, which includes those with tattoos.<ref name=Tato2010/> Screening is also recommended in those with elevated liver enzymes as this is frequently the only sign of chronic hepatitis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Senadhi|first=V|title=A paradigm shift in the outpatient approach to liver function tests|journal=Southern Medical Journal|year=2011 |month = July|volume=104|issue=7|pages=521–5|pmid=21886053|doi=10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31821e8ff5}}</ref> Routine screening is not currently recommended in the United States.<ref name=AFP2010 /> However, in 2012, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommended a single screening test for those born between 1945 and 1965.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945-1965 |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=61 |issue=RR-4 |pages=1–32 |year=2012 |month=August |pmid=22895429 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[Image:HCV prevalence 1999.png|thumb|left|Prevalence of hepatitis C worldwide in 1999]]
It is estimated that 130–200&nbsp;million people, or ~3% of the world's population, are living with chronic {{nowrap|hepatitis C}}.<ref name=Gravitz2011/><ref name=WHO2011/> About 3–4&nbsp;million people are infected per year, and more than 350,000 people die yearly from hepatitis C-related diseases.<ref name=WHO2011/> Rates have increased substantially in the 20th century due to a combination of IDU and intravenous medication or poorly sterilized medical equipment.<ref name="World2007"/>

Among those chronically infected, the risk of [[cirrhosis]] after 20 years varies between studies but has been estimated at ~10%-15% for men and ~1-5% for women. The reason for this difference is not known. Once cirrhosis is established, the rate of developing [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] is ~1%-4% per year.<ref name=Yu2009>{{cite journal | author = Yu ML | coauthors = Chuang WL | title = Treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Asia: when East meets West | journal = J.

In the United States, about 2% of people have {{nowrap|hepatitis C}},<ref name=AFP2010/> with about 35,000 to 185,000 new cases a year.

==History==
In the mid-1970s, [[Harvey J. Alter]], Chief of the Infectious Disease Section in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the [[National Institutes of Health]], and his research team demonstrated how most post-[[blood transfusion|transfusion]] hepatitis cases were not due to [[hepatitis A]] or [[Hepatitis B|B]] viruses. Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify the virus, initially called ''non-A, non-B hepatitis'' (NANBH), failed for the next decade. In 1987, Michael Houghton, Qui-Lim Choo, and George Kuo at [[Chiron Corporation]], collaborating with Dr. D.W. Bradley at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], used a novel [[molecular cloning]] approach to identify the unknown organism and develop a diagnostic test.<ref name = Boyer>{{cite book | isbn = 9780792387602 | last = Boyer | first = JL | title = Liver cirrhosis and its development: proceedings of the Falk Symposium 115 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=n5P696E7T0wC&pg=PA344#v=onepage&q&f=false 344] | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year = 2001 }}</ref> In 1988, the virus was confirmed by Alter by verifying its presence in a panel of NANBH specimens.
