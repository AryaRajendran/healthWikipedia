'''Hepatotoxicity''' (from ''hepatic toxicity'') implies chemical-driven [[liver]] damage.

The liver plays a central role in transforming and clearing chemicals and is susceptible to the toxicity from these agents. Certain medicinal agents, when taken in overdoses and sometimes even when introduced within [[Therapeutic index|therapeutic ranges]], may injure the organ. Other chemical agents, such as those used in laboratories and industries, natural chemicals (e.g., [[microcystin]]s) and [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] can also induce hepatotoxicity. Chemicals that cause liver injury are called [[hepatotoxin]]s.

More than 900 drugs have been implicated in causing liver injury<ref name="isbn0-8385-1551-7">{{cite book |author=Friedman, Scott E.; Grendell, James H.; McQuaid, Kenneth R. |title=Current diagnosis & treatment in gastroenterology |publisher=Lang Medical Books/McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2003 |pages=664–679 |isbn=0-8385-1551-7 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> and it is the most common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market. Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury also account for a substantial number of compound failures, highlighting the need for drug screening assays, such as [[stem cell]]-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug development process.<ref name="stem2012">{{cite journal |author= Greenhough S, Hay DC. |title=Stem Cell-Based Toxicity Screening: Recent Advances in Hepatocyte Generation |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26020/Stem_Cell_Based_Toxicity_Screening__Recent.2.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=85–89 |year=2012}}</ref> Chemicals often cause [[subclinical]] injury to liver which manifests only as abnormal [[Liver function tests|liver enzyme tests]].

== Drug metabolism in liver ==
[[Image:Hepatic drug metabolism.svg|thumb|left|Drug metabolism in liver: transferases are : glutathione, sulfate, acetate, glucoronic acid. P-450 is cytochrome P-450 enzymes. 3 different pathways are depicted for Drugs A, B and C.]]
The human body identifies almost all drugs as foreign substances (i.e. [[xenobiotics]]) and subjects them to various chemical processes (i.e. [[metabolism]]) to make them suitable for elimination. This involves chemical transformations to (a) reduce fat solubility and (b) to change biological activity. Although almost all tissues in the body have some ability to metabolize chemicals, [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] in the liver is the principal "metabolic clearing house" for both [[endogenous]] chemicals (e.g., [[cholesterol]], steroid hormones,  [[fatty acids]], [[proteins]]) and [[exogenous]] substances (e.g., drugs, alcohol).<ref>{{cite book |author=Donald Blumenthal; Laurence Brunton; Keith Parker; Lazo, John S.; Iain Buxton |title=Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Digital Edition |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year= 2006|pages= |isbn=0-07-146804-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> The central role played by liver in the clearance and transformation of chemicals makes it susceptible to drug-induced injury.

[[Drug metabolism]] is usually divided into two phases: ''phase 1'' and ''phase 2''. Phase 1 reaction is thought to prepare a drug for phase 2. However many compounds can be metabolized by phase 2 directly. Phase 1 reaction involves [[oxidation]], [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]], [[hydrolysis]], [[hydration reaction|hydration]] and many other rare chemical reactions. These processes tend to increase water solubility of the drug and can generate metabolites which are more chemically active and potentially toxic. Most of phase 2 reactions take place in [[cytosol]] and involve conjugation with endogenous compounds via [[transferase]] enzymes. Chemically active phase 1 products are rendered relatively inert and suitable for elimination by this step.

A group of [[enzyme]]s located in the endoplasmic reticulum, known as [[cytochrome P-450]], is the most important family of metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Cytochrome P-450 is the terminal [[oxidase]] component of an [[electron transport chain]]. It is not a single enzyme, but rather consists of a closely related family of 50 [[isoform]]s; six of them metabolize 90% of drugs.<ref name="isbn0-7487-6011-3">{{cite book |author=Skett, Paul; Gibson, G.

Three important characteristics of the P450 system have roles in drug-induced toxicity:
:'''1. Genetic diversity:'''
Each of the P-450 proteins is unique and accounts (to some extent) for the variation in drug metabolism between individuals. Genetic variations ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) in P-450 metabolism should be considered when patients exhibit unusual sensitivity or resistance to drug effects at normal doses. Such polymorphism is also responsible for variable drug response among patients of differing ethnic backgrounds.

:'''2. Change in enzyme activity:'''
Many substances can influence the P-450 enzyme mechanism. Drugs interact with the enzyme family in several ways.<ref name="pmid9469685">{{cite journal |author=Michalets EL |title=Update: clinically significant cytochrome P-450 drug interactions |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=84–112 |year=1998 |pmid=9469685 |doi=}}</ref> Drugs that modify cytochrome P-450 enzyme are referred to as either inhibitors or inducers. Enzyme inhibitors block the metabolic activity of one or several P-450 enzymes. This effect usually occurs immediately. On the other hand, inducers increase P-450 activity by increasing its synthesis. Depending on the inducing drug's half life, there is usually a delay before enzyme activity increases.<ref name="pmid17708140"/>

:'''3. Competitive inhibition:'''
Some drugs may share the same P-450 specificity and thus competitively block their bio transformation. This may lead to accumulation of drugs metabolized by the enzyme. This type of drug interaction may also reduce the rate of generation of toxic substrate.

Drugs continue to be taken off the market due to late discovery of hepatotoxicity. Due to its unique metabolism and close relationship with the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the liver is susceptible to injury from drugs and other substances. 75% of blood coming to the liver arrives directly from gastrointestinal organs and then spleen via [[Hepatic portal vein|portal vein]]s which bring drugs and xenobiotics in near-undiluted form. Several mechanisms are responsible for either inducing hepatic injury or worsening the damage process.
Many chemicals damage [[mitochondria]], an intracellular organelle that produce energy. Its dysfunction releases excessive amount of oxidants which, in turn, injure hepatic cells. Activation of some enzymes in the cytochrome P-450 system such as [[CYP2E1]] also lead to oxidative stress.<ref name="pmid11812920">{{cite journal |author=Jaeschke H, Gores GJ, Cederbaum AI, Hinson JA, Pessayre D, Lemasters JJ |title=Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity |journal=Toxicol.

== Adverse drug reactions ==
[[Image:Drug-induced hepatitis low mag.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Drug-induced hepatitis with [[granulomata]]. Other causes were excluded with extensive investigations. [[Liver]] [[biopsy]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
[[Adverse drug reaction]]s are classified as type A (intrinsic or pharmacological) or type B (idiosyncratic).<ref>{{cite book |author=Davies, D. |title=Textbook of adverse drug reactions |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1985 |pages= 18–45|isbn=0-19-261479-7 |oclc=12558288 |doi=}}</ref> Type A drug reaction accounts for 80% of all toxicities.<ref name="pmid9554902">{{cite journal |author=Pirmohamed M, Breckenridge AM, Kitteringham NR, Park BK |title=Adverse drug reactions |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7140 |pages=1295–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9554902 |doi= |pmc=1113033}}</ref>

[[Drugs]] or toxins that have a '''pharmacological''' (type A) hepatotoxicity are those that have ''predictable'' [[dose-response curve]]s (higher concentrations cause more liver damage) and well characterized mechanisms of toxicity, such as directly damaging liver tissue or blocking a metabolic process. As in the case of [[acetaminophen]] overdose, this type of injury occurs shortly after some threshold for toxicity is reached.

'''[[Idiosyncratic drug reaction|Idiosyncratic]]''' (type B) injury occurs without warning, when agents cause ''non-predictable'' hepatotoxicity in susceptible individuals which is not related to dose and has a variable latency period.<ref name="pmid352664">{{cite journal |author=Zimmerman HJ |title=Drug-induced liver disease |journal=Drugs |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=25–45 |year=1978 |pmid=352664|doi=10.2165/00003495-197816010-00002}}</ref> This type of injury does not have a clear dose-response nor temporal relationship, and most often does not have predictive models. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has led to the withdrawal of several drugs from market even after rigorous clinical testing as part of the FDA approval process; [[Troglitazone]] (Rezulin) and [[trovafloxacin]] (Trovan) are two prime examples of idiosyncratic hepatotoxins pulled from market.

When used orally, ketoconazole has been associated with hepatic toxicity, including some fatalities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ketoconazole Tablets|url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/ketoconazole-tablets.html}}</ref>

Chemicals produce a wide variety of clinical and [[pathological]] hepatic injury. Biochemical markers (e.g. [[alanine transferase]], [[alkaline phosphatase]] and [[bilirubin]]) are often used to indicate liver damage. Liver injury is defined as a rise in either (a) [[alanine transferase|ALT]] level more than three times of upper limit of normal (ULN), (b) [[alkaline phosphatase|ALP]] level more than twice ULN, or (c) total bilirubin level more than twice ULN when associated with increased ALT or ALP.<ref name="pmid16710915"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bénichou C |title=Criteria of drug-induced liver disorders. Report of an international consensus meeting |journal=J.

However they are not mutually exclusive and mixed types of injuries are often encountered.

Specific [[Morphology (biology)|histo-pathological]] patterns of liver injury from drug-induced damage are discussed below.

'''Zonal Necrosis'''

This is the most common type of drug-induced liver cell [[necrosis]] where the injury is largely confined to a particular zone of the [[liver lobule]]. It may manifest as a very high level of [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and severe disturbance of liver function leading to [[acute liver failure]].
:Causes include:
:[[Paracetamol]], [[carbon tetrachloride]]

'''[[Hepatitis]]'''

In this pattern, hepatocellular necrosis is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug-induced hepatitis. (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. (B) in focal or non-specific hepatitis, scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany [[lymphocyte|lymphocytic]] infiltration. (C) chronic hepatitis is very similar to [[autoimmune hepatitis]] clinically, serologically, and histologically.
:Causes:
:(a) Viral hepatitis: [[Halothane]], [[isoniazid]], [[phenytoin]]
:(b) Focal hepatitis: [[Aspirin]]
:(c) Chronic hepatitis: [[Methyldopa]], [[diclofenac]]
'''[[Cholestasis]]'''

Liver injury leads to impairment of bile flow and cases are predominated by itching and jaundice. Histology may show inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis) or it can be bland (without any [[parenchymal]] inflammation). On rare occasions, it can produce features similar to primary biliary cirrhosis due to progressive destruction of small bile ducts ([[Vanishing Bile Duct Syndrome|Vanishing duct syndrome]]).
:Causes:
:(a) Bland: [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Oral contraceptive pills]], [[anabolic steroid]], [[androgens]]
:(b) Inflammatory: [[Allopurinol]], [[co-amoxiclav]], [[carbamazepine]]
:(c) Ductal: [[Chlorpromazine]], [[flucloxacillin]]

'''[[Steatosis]]'''

Hepatotoxicity may manifest as triglyceride accumulation which leads to either small droplet (microvesicular) or large droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of steatosis where phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e.g. [[Tay-Sachs disease]])
:Causes:
:(a) Microvesicular: [[Aspirin]] ([[Reye's syndrome]]), [[ketoprofen]], [[tetracycline]] (especially if expired)
:(b) Macrovesicular: [[Acetamenophen]], [[methotrexate]]
:(c) Phospholipidosis: [[Amiodarone]], [[total parenteral nutrition]]

'''[[Granuloma]]'''

Drug-induced hepatic granulomas are usually associated with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic vasculitis and hypersensitivity. More than 50 drugs have been implicated.
: Causes:
:[[Allopurinol]], [[phenytoin]], [[isoniazid]], [[quinine]], [[penicillin]], [[quinidine]]

'''Vascular lesions'''

These result from injury to the vascular endothelium.
:Causes:
:[[Venoocclusive disease]]: Chemotherapeutic agents, bush tea
:[[Peliosis hepatis]]: Anabolic steroids
:[[Budd-Chiari syndrome|Hepatic vein thrombosis]]: Oral contraceptives

'''[[Neoplasm]]'''

Neoplasms have been described with prolonged exposure to some medications or toxins. Hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma, and liver adenomas are the ones usually reported.
:Causes:
:[[Vinyl chloride]], [[combined oral contraceptive pill]], [[anabolic steroid]], [[arsenic]], [[thorotrast]]

== Clinical assessment ==
[[Image:Aseessement of hepatotoxicity.svg|thumb|left|Algorithm for suspected drug induced hepatic toxicity]]
This remains a  challenge in clinical practice due to a lack of reliable markers.<ref name="pmid17230599">{{cite journal |author=Andrade RJ, Robles M, Fernández-Castañer A, López-Ortega S, López-Vega MC, Lucena MI |title=Assessment of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in clinical practice: a challenge for gastroenterologists |journal=World J.

To diagnose hepatotoxicity, a causal relationship between the use of the toxin or drug and subsequent liver damage has to be established, but might be difficult, especially when idiosyncratic reaction is suspected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arundel C, Lewis JH |title=Drug-induced liver disease in 2006 |journal=Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=244–54 |year=2007 |pmid=17414839 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e3280b17dfb}}</ref> Simultaneous use of multiple drugs may add to the complexity. As in acetaminophen toxicity, well established, dose-dependent, pharmacological hepatotoxicity is easier to spot. Several clinical scales such as [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences|CIOMS]]/RUCAM scale and Maria and Victorino criteria have been proposed to establish causal relationship between offending drug and liver damage. [[CIOMS/RUCAM scale]] involves a scoring system which categorizes the suspicion into "definite or highly probable" (score > 8), “probable” (score 6-8), “possible” (score 3-5), “unlikely” (score 1-2) and “excluded” (score ≤ 0). In clinical practice, physicians put more emphasis on the presence or absence of similarity between the biochemical profile of the patient and known biochemical profile of the suspected toxicity (e.g., cholestatic damage in [[Co-amoxiclav|amoxycillin-clauvonic acid]] ).<ref name="pmid17230599"/>

== Treatment and prognosis ==
In most cases, liver function will return to normal if the offending drug is stopped early. Additionally, the patient may require supportive treatment. In [[acetaminophen toxicity]], however, the initial insult can be fatal. Fulminant hepatic failure from drug-induced hepatotoxicity may require liver transplantation. In the past, glucocorticoids in allergic features and ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestatic cases had been used, but there is no good evidence to support their effectiveness.

An elevation in serum bilirubin level of more than 2 times ULN with associated transaminase rise is an ominous sign. This indicates severe hepatotoxicity and is likely to lead to mortality in 10% to 15% of patients, especially if the offending drug is not stopped ([[Hy's Law]]).<ref name="pmid14768020">{{cite journal |author=Reuben A |title=Hy's law |journal=Hepatology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=574–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14768020 |doi=10.1002/hep.20081}}</ref><ref name="pmid16618822">{{cite journal |author=Arora N, Goldhaber SZ |title=Anticoagulants and transaminase elevation |journal=Circulation |volume=113 |issue=15 |pages=e698–702 |year=2006 |pmid=16618822 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.603100}}</ref> This is because it requires significant damage to the liver to impair bilirubin excretion, hence minor impairment (in the absence of biliary obstruction or [[Gilbert syndrome]]) would not lead to jaundice.

== Drugs withdrawn for hepatotoxicity ==
The following therapeutic drugs were withdrawn from the market primarily because of hepatotoxicity: [[Troglitazone]], [[bromfenac]], [[trovafloxacin]], [[ebrotidine]], [[nimesulide]], [[nefazodone]], [[ximelagatran]] and [[pemoline]].<ref name="pmid17230599"/><ref name="pmid10687025">{{cite journal |author=Shah RR |title=Drug-induced hepatotoxicity: pharmacokinetic perspectives and strategies for risk reduction |journal=Adverse drug reactions and toxicological reviews |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=181–233 |year=1999 |pmid=10687025 |doi=}}</ref><ref>Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/169814-overview</ref>

== Specific drug or toxin==

===Acetaminophen===
{{Main|Acetaminophen toxicity}}

[[Image:Paracetamol-rod-povray.png|thumb|Acetaminophen (3D structure) overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver disease]]
[[Acetaminophen]] (paracetamol, also known by the brand name Tylenol and Panadol) is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose, but overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver disease and [[acute liver failure]] worldwide.<ref name="isbn0-443-06633-7"/>  Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (''N''-acetyl-''p''-benzoquinone imine NAPQI, or NABQI) which is produced by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver.<ref name="pmid15345657">{{cite journal |author=Wallace JL |title=Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity: NO to the rescue |journal=Br.

In an overdose, a large amount of NAPQI is generated which overwhelms the detoxification process and leads to liver cell damage. [[Nitric oxide]] also plays a role in inducing toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=James LP, Mayeux PR, Hinson JA |title=Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity |journal=Drug Metab.

Administration of [[Acetylcysteine]], a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. Those who develop [[acute liver failure]] can still recover spontaneously,  but may require transplantation if poor [[prognostic]] signs such as [[encephalopathy]] or [[coagulopathy]] is present (see [[King's College Criteria]]).

=== Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ===
Although individual analgesics rarely induce liver damage due to their widespread use, NSAIDs have emerged as a major group of drugs exhibiting hepatotoxicity. Both dose-dependent and idiosyncratic reactions have been documented.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Manov I, Motanis H, Frumin I, Iancu TC |title=Hepatotoxicity of anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs: ultrastructural aspects |journal=Acta Pharmacol.
