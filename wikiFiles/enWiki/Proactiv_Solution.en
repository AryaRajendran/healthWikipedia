==Indications and possible side effects==
Proactiv Solution was created to treat mild to moderate cases of acne. However, it is not guaranteed that the user will ever see results. Like most [[antibacterial]]s for treating acne, Proactiv Solution uses [[benzoyl peroxide]] as the [[active ingredient]]. Reportedly, benzoyl peroxide may cause dryness and peeling of the skin; approximately 5 percent of the population is allergic to it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marmur|first=Ellen|title=Simple Skin Beauty: Every Woman's Guide to a Lifetime of Healthy, Gorgeous Skin|year=2009|publisher=Atria Books|isbn=1416586962|pages=200|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9jRtBUaliKwC&pg=PA200&dq=%22Proactiv+Solution%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rRa2UJ6GOI-t0AGZ1YD4DQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&q=%22Proactiv%20Solution%22&f=false}}</ref> Reported reactions include redness, itching, [[Urticaria|hives]], swelling and a burning sensation after topical application. Benzoyl peroxide may also cause increased sensitivity to sunlight and induce color-specific discoloration of clothes. For those who may be sensitive or allergic to it, Proactiv Solution has marketed the Gentle Formula kit, containing [[salicylic acid]] instead, although it is unclear whether or not salicylic acid can also cause these side effects.
