'''Circadian rhythm sleep disorders''' are a family of [[sleep disorders]] affecting, among other things, the timing of sleep. People with circadian rhythm sleep disorders are unable to sleep and wake at the times required for normal work, school, and social needs. They are generally able to get enough sleep if allowed to sleep and wake at the times dictated by their body clocks. Unless they also have another sleep disorder, their sleep is of normal quality.

Humans, like most animals and plants, have biological rhythms, known as [[circadian rhythm]]s, which are controlled by a [[Circadian_rhythm#Biological_clock_in_mammals|biological clock]] and work on a daily time scale. These affect [[body temperature]], [[alertness]], [[appetite]], [[hormone]] secretion etc. as well as sleep timing. Due to the circadian clock, sleepiness does not continuously increase as time passes. A person's desire and ability to fall asleep is influenced by both the length of time since the person woke from an adequate sleep, and by internal circadian rhythms. Thus, the body is ready for sleep and for wakefulness at different times of the day.

Sleep researcher Yaron Dagan states that "[t]hese disorders can lead to harmful psychological and functional difficulties and are often misdiagnosed and incorrectly treated due to the fact that doctors are unaware of their existence."<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Dagan | first = Yaron | year = 2002 | month = February | title = Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–54 | publisher = Elsevier | issn = | pmid = 12531141| doi = 10.1053/smrv.2001.0190 | url = http://www.smrv-journal.com/article/S1087-0792(01)90190-X/abstract | format = Abstract | accessdate = 2010-10-13 | quote =  }}</ref>

==Types of circadian rhythm sleep disorders==
===Extrinsic type===
Two of these disorders are [[extrinsic]] (from Latin ''extrinsecus'', from without, on the outside) or circumstantial:
* [[Jet lag]], which affects people who travel across several time zones.
* [[Shift work sleep disorder]], which affects people who work nights or rotating shifts.

===Intrinsic type=== 
Four of them are [[intrinsic]] (from Latin ''intrinsecus'', on the inside, inwardly), "built-in":
* [[Delayed sleep phase disorder]] (DSPD), aka delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), characterized by a much later than normal timing of sleep onset and offset and a period of peak alertness in the middle of the night.
* [[Advanced sleep phase syndrome]] (ASPS), characterized by difficulty staying awake in the evening and difficulty staying asleep in the morning.
* [[Non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome]] (Non-24), in which the affected individual's sleep occurs later and later each day, with the period of peak alertness also continuously moving around the clock from day to day.
* [[Irregular sleep-wake rhythm]], which presents as sleeping at very irregular times, and usually more than twice per day (waking frequently during the night and taking naps during the day) but with total time asleep typical for the person's age.

==Normal circadian rhythms==
[[File:Biological clock human.svg|thumb|right|400px|Typical features of a normal cicadian rhythm, including a [[bedtime]] of 22:00.]]
Among people with healthy circadian clocks, there is a continuum of [[chronotype]]s from "[[lark (person)|larks]]", "morning people", who prefer to sleep and wake early, to "[[night owl (person)|owls]]", "evening people" or "night people", who prefer to sleep and wake at late times. Whether they are larks or owls, people with normal circadian systems: 
* can wake in time for what they need to do in the morning, and fall asleep at night in time to get enough sleep before having to get up.
* can sleep and wake up at the same time every day, if they want to.
* will, after starting a new routine that requires their getting up earlier than usual, start to fall asleep at night earlier within a few days. For example, someone used to sleeping at 1 a.m. and waking up at 9 a.m. begins a new job on a Monday, and must get up at 6 a.m. to get ready for work. By the following Friday, the person has begun to fall asleep at around 10 p.m., and can wake up at 6 a.m. feeling well-rested. This adaptation to earlier sleep/wake times is known as "advancing the sleep phase." Healthy people can advance their sleep phase by about one hour each day.

Researchers have placed volunteers in caves or special apartments for several weeks without clocks or other time cues. Without time cues, the volunteers tended to go to bed an hour later and to get up about an hour later each day. These experiments appeared to demonstrate that the "free-running" circadian rhythm in humans was about 25 hours long. However, these volunteers were allowed to control artificial lighting and the light in the evening caused a phase delay. More recent research shows that adults of all ages free-run at an average of 24 hours and 11 minutes. To maintain a 24-hour day/night cycle, the biological clock needs regular environmental time cues or ''[[Zeitgeber]]s'', e.g., sunrise, sunset, and daily routine. Time cues keep the normal human circadian clock aligned with the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih3/sleep/guide/info-sleep.htm |title=Sleep - Information about Sleep |author=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

==Circadian rhythm abnormalities==
Non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome and other persistent circadian rhythm sleep disorders are believed to be caused by an inadequate ability to reset the sleep/wake cycle in response to environmental time cues. These individuals' circadian clocks might have an unusually long cycle, and/or might not be sensitive enough to time cues. People with DSPS (Delayed sleep phase disorder), more common than Non-24, do entrain to nature's 24 hours, but are unable to sleep and awaken at socially preferred times, sleeping instead, for example, from 4 a.m. to noon. According to doctors Cataletto and Hertz at [[WebMD]], "Altered or disrupted sensitivity to [[zeitgeber]]s is probably the most common cause of circadian rhythm disorder."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/TOPIC655.HTM |title=Sleeplessness and Circadian Rhythm Disorder |accessdate=2008-07-20 |last=Cataletto |first=Mary E. |coauthors=Hertz, Gila |date= Updated 2005-09-07 |format=Free registration required |publisher=eMedicine from WebMD}}</ref>  

Circadian rhythm abnormalities are also extremely common in [[ADHD]], especially in the form of [[Delayed sleep phase disorder|delayed sleep]] (sleep initiation insomnia). It has been genetically linked by findings of [[polymorphism]] in [[gene]]s in common between those apparently involved in ADHD and those involved in the [[circadian rhythm]]<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajmg.b.30602/abstract;jsessionid=9FBF4FE52EEBA9CCE864B1B050C0D005.d01t01 A polymorphism at the 3′-untranslated region of the CLOCK gene is associated with adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]: American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B: Neuropsychiatric Genetics, Volume 147B, Issue 3, pages 333–338, 5 April 2008</ref><ref>“Adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with alterations in circadian rhythms at the behavioural, endocrine and molecular levels” - Molecular Psychiatry , (22 November 2011) | doi:10.1038/mp.2011.149 (PubMed ID: 22105622 pre pub)</ref> and a high proportion of DSPD among those with ADHD,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Van der Heijden KB, Smits MG, Van Someren EJ, Gunning WB |title=Idiopathic chronic sleep onset insomnia in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a circadian rhythm sleep disorder |journal=Chronobiology International |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=559–70 |year=2005 |pmid=16076654 |doi=10.1081/CBI-200062410}}</ref><ref>http://addsherpa.com/2011/12/trouble-sleeping-your-not-alone - ''“About three-fourths of all adults with ADHD report inability to ‘shut off my mind so I can fall asleep at night’.”''</ref> however no specific or further cause-effect relationship has been proven.

As of October 1, 2005, the diagnostic codes for circadian rhythm sleep disorders were changed from the 307-group to the 327-group in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition, Text Revision'' (DSM-IV-TR). The DSM updated to agree with the ''[[International Classification of Diseases]]'' (ICD-9). The new codes reflect the moving of these disorders from the Mental Disorders section to the Neurological section in the ICD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psych.org/MainMenu/Research/DSMIV/DSMIVTR/CodingUpdates/NewDiagnosticCodesforSleepDisordersEffectiveOctober12005.aspx |title=New Diagnostic Codes for Sleep Disorders |accessdate=2008-08-08 |last=First |first=Michael B. |year=2005 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}</ref>

==Treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders==
Possible treatments for circadian rhythm sleep disorders include:
* [[Behavior therapy]] or advice about [[sleep hygiene]] where the patient is told to avoid naps, caffeine, and other stimulants. They are also told to not be in bed for anything besides sleep and sex.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.sleepoz.org.au/files/fact_sheets/AT09%20-%20Sleep%20Hygiene.pdf |title= Sleep Hygiene |accessdate= 2011-12-09  |year= 2006 |publisher= Sleep Disorders Australia |pages= 1 |quote= }}</ref>
* Bright [[light therapy]] is used to advance or delay sleep, depending on how the circadian rhythm is shifted. Patients are exposed to high-intensity light (up to 10,000 lux) for a duration of 30–60 minutes at a time, the time of day depending on whether an advance or a delay is required.
* Blue blocking glasses therapy is used to block blue wavelength light from reaching the eye during evening hours so that melatonin production is increased.
* Medications such as [[melatonin]] and [[modafinil]] (Provigil), or other short term sleep aids or wake-promoting agents can be beneficial; the former is a natural [[neurohormone]] responsible partly and in tiny amounts for the human [[body clock]]. [[Tasimelteon]] has been proven effective in Phase III trials.
* [[Sleep phase chronotherapy]] progressively advances or delays the sleep time by 1–2 hours per day.<ref>http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Sleep_Disorders_Center/Circadian_Rhythm.pdf The Cleveland Clinic Guide to Sleep Disorders by Nancy Foldvary-Schaefer, DO</ref>
