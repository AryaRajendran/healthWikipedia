'''[[Autoimmunity|Autoimmune]] [[heart]] [[disease]]s''' are the effects of the body's own [[Immunity (medical)|immune]] defense system mistaking cardiac [[antigens]] as foreign and attacking them leading to [[inflammation]] of the heart as a whole, or in parts. The commonest form of autoimmune heart disease is rheumatic heart disease or [[rheumatic fever]].

==Mechanism and aetiology==
These are the typical mechanisms of [[autoimmunity]]. [[Autoantibody|Autoantibodies]] or auto-toxic [[T-cell|T-lymphocyte]] mediated tissue destruction. The process is aided by [[neutrophil]]s, the [[complement system]], [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]], etc.

Aetiologically, these are most commonly seen in children with a history of [[sore throat]] caused by a [[streptococcus|streptococcal infection]]. This is similar to the post-streptococcal [[glomerulonephritis]]. Here, the anti-bacterial [[antibodies]] cross react with the heart antigens causing inflammation.

Inflammatory damage leads to the following:
*[[Pericarditis]]: Here the [[pericardium]] gets inflamed. Acutely, it can cause pericardial [[effusion]] leading to [[cardiac tamponade]] and death. After healing, there may be [[fibrosis]] and [[adhesion]] of the pericardium with the heart leading to constriction of the heart and reduced cardiac function.
*[[Myocarditis]]: Here the muscle bulk of the heart gets inflamed. Inflamed muscles have reduced functional capacity. This may be fatal, if left untreated as is in a case of [[pancarditis]]. On healing, there will be fibrosis and reduced functional capacity.
*[[Endocarditis]]: Here the inner lining of the heart is inflamed, including the [[heart valves]]. This may cause a [[Valvular heart disease|valve prolapse]], adhesion of the adjacent cusps of these valves and occlusion of the flow tracts of blood through the [[heart]] causing diseases called [[Valvular heart disease|valve stenosis]].

==Specific clinical manifestations==
These depend on the amount of [[inflammation]]. These are covered in their relevant articles.
*Acute: [[Heart failure]]; pericardial effusion; etc.
*Chronic: Valve diseases as noted above; Reduced [[cardiac output]]; Exercise intolerance.

==Therapy==
Intensive cardiac care and immunosuppressives including corticosteroids are helpful in the acute stage of the disease. Chronic phase has, mainly debility control and supportive care options.
