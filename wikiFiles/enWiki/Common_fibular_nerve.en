The '''common fibular nerve''' ('''common peroneal nerve'''; '''external popliteal nerve'''; '''peroneal nerve'''; '''lateral popliteal nerve'''), about one-half the size of the [[tibial nerve]], is derived from the dorsal branches of the fourth and fifth [[lumbar nerve|lumbar]] and the first and second [[sacral nerve]]s. 

It descends obliquely along the lateral side of the [[popliteal fossa]] to the head of the [[fibula]], close to the medial margin of the [[biceps femoris muscle]]. Where the common peroneal nerve winds round the head of the fibula, it is palpable.<ref name='LL-nerves-website'>{{cite web|url=http://download.videohelp.com/vitualis/med/lowrnn.htm |title=Nerves of the Lower Limb |accessdate=2010-05-08 |last=Tam |first=Michael |date=2006-03-30 |work=Medical student's retreat - Michael Tam's anatomy notes for medical students |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071213025348/http://download.videohelp.com/vitualis/med/lowrnn.htm#Common_peroneal_nerve |archivedate=2007-12-13 }}</ref>

It lies between the tendon of the biceps femoris and lateral head of the [[gastrocnemius muscle]], winds around the neck of the fibula, between the [[peronæus longus]] and the bone, and divides beneath the muscle into the [[superficial fibular nerve]] (superficial peroneal nerve) and [[deep fibular nerve]] (deep peroneal nerve). 

It innervates the [[peroneus longus]], [[peroneus brevis]], and the short head of the [[biceps femoris]] muscles.

==Branches==
Previous to its division it gives off ''articular'' and ''lateral sural cutaneous'' nerves.

* The '''articular branches''' (''rami articulares'') are three in number:
** Two of these accompany the superior and inferior lateral genicular arteries to the knee; the upper one occasionally arises from the trunk of the sciatic nerve.
** The third (recurrent) articular nerve is given off at the point of division of the common fibular nerve; it ascends with the anterior recurrent tibial artery through the [[tibialis anterior]] to the front of the [[knee]].

* The '''[[lateral sural cutaneous nerve]]''' (''n. cutaneus suræ lateralis''; lateral cutaneous branch) supplies the skin on the posterior and lateral surfaces of the leg.
* The motor branches:
** As the common fibular nerve exits the popliteal fossa, it courses around the lateral aspect of the leg just below the head of the fibula. Here it is apposed with fibula and gives off two branches, the superficial fibular (peroneal) branch and deep fibular (peroneal) branch.
** The superficial peroneal nerve supplies the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg namely: peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. These two muscle help in eversion and plantar flexion of the foot.
** The deep peroneal nerve innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg which are: tibialis anterior, [[extensor hallucis longus]], [[extensor digitorum longus]], and the fibularis (peroneus) tertius. Together these muscles are responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot and extension of the toes.

==Clinical significance==
Chronic '''peroneal neuropathy''' can result from, among other conditions, bed rest of long duration, hyperflexion of the knee, peripheral neuropathy, pressure in obstetric stirrups, and conditioning in ballet dancers. The most common cause is habitual leg crossing that compresses the common fibular nerve as it crosses around the head of fibula.<ref>{{cite book

Damage to this nerve typically results in [[foot drop]], where [[dorsiflexion]] of the foot is compromised and the foot drags (the toe points) during walking; and in sensory loss to the dorsal surface of the foot and portions of the anterior, lower-lateral leg. A common [[yoga]] kneeling exercise, the [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Varjrasana]] has, under the name "yoga foot drop," been linked to foot drop.<ref name=JAMA8971>{{cite journal|title=Yoga Foot Drop|journal=JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=August 9, 1971|volume=271|issue=6|pages=827–828|doi=10.1001/jama.1971.03190060065025|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=338611|accessdate=November 19, 2012|author=Joseph Chusid}}</ref><ref name=NTYM01512>{{cite news|title=How Yoga Can Wreck Your Body|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/magazine/how-yoga-can-wreck-your-body.html|accessdate=August 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times Magazine|date=January 5, 2012|author=William J.

==Surgical procedures==

* '''Peroneal nerve decompression:'''
** In the surgical treatment of fibular nerve compression, an incision is made over the neck of the fibula. Fascia surrounding the nerves to the lateral side of the leg is released.<ref name="dellonipns">[http://www.dellonipns.com/peroneal_nerve_surgery.php Dellon Institutes Peroneal Nerve Compression Surgical Treatment]</ref>

* '''Deep peroneal nerve decompression:'''
** In the surgical treatment of deep fibular nerve entrapment in the foot, a ligament from the extensor digitorum brevis muscle that crosses over the deep peroneal nerve, putting pressure on it and causing pain, is released.<ref name="dellonipns" />
