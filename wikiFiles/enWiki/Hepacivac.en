HEPACIVAC stands for “New preventative and therapeutic [[Hepatitis C]] [[vaccines]]: from pre-clinical to phase 1”. HEPACIVAC is a project of the EU [[sixth Framework Programme|6th Framework Programme]].

== Summary ==

The aim of the HEPACIVAC project is to develop efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic [[vaccines]] to [[Hepatitis C virus]] (HCV).  For this purpose, two vaccine companies in Europe, Okairos (a Biotech company created as a spin-off from [[Merck & Co.|Merck Inc.]]) and Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics are joining their efforts with several European groups and one institution from [[Egypt]] (listed in the [[FP6]] INCO list).  To increase the probability of success, the ‘ideal HCV vaccine’ should be capable of eliciting both arms of the [[immune system]], [[antibody]] and cellular responses. 
Okairos, in collaboration with Ceinge, has been working on a promising gene based HCV vaccine candidate using adenoviral vectors for delivery. This vaccine is based on the 2000 amino acid long HCV Non Structural region, elicits potent [[CD4+]] and CD8+ [[T cell]] responses and works by eliminating infected cells, thus preventing [[chronic hepatitis]]. 
A second vaccine candidate, previously developed by Novartis, consists of recombinant HCV [[glycoproteins]], gpE1 and gpE2, associated to resemble a pre-virion envelope structure which is capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies. Both vaccine candidates have the potential to protect humans from a large number of HCV strains. 
The goal of the HEPACIVAC project is to develop HCV vaccines both at the pre-clinical level by testing safety, [[tolerability]] and [[immunogenicity]], and at the clinical level by testing in healthy volunteers for safety and dose optimization and in chronically infected patients with and without the gold standard therapy.

== Partners ==

HEPACIVAC represents a unique consortium including cutting edge industrial and academic and research groups. 
A key feature of HEPACIVAC project is that this large consortium, which includes two [[vaccine]] companies, several academic and research groups with expertise in clinical vaccine development, human [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] and [[animal models]], focuses the skills of the individual participants towards the development of new preventative and therapeutic strategies against [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] infection. The consortium integrates different approaches and disciplines and provides the necessary critical mass to test and compare different scientific ideas with the aim of delivering an efficacious [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] vaccine.

== Expected results ==

The HEPACIVAC project will be '''an important step forward towards the development of a [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] vaccine''' that will defeat an important cause of global [[morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]], and that will be cost-effective when used by the general population even in countries with low incidence of infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Krahn et al.|year=2005}}</ref> In particular the development of a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C would be one of the first demonstrations (after the treatment of [[herpes zoster]] infections<ref>{{cite journal|last=Oxman et al.|year=2005}}</ref> ) of successful immuno-therapeutic intervention in chronic [[viral infections]]. 
Furthermore, this project will contribute to '''European competitiveness''' in the strategic field of [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] vaccine development by combining the expertise of groups coming from several countries within [[Europe]] and one from the [[Mediterranean area]]. Each group has recognised expertise within its field and a coherent and large-scale collaboration on a single project is a guarantee for its success. 
The purpose of this project is to put together excellent European scientists to analyse 2 [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] vaccines targeting different components of the [[immune system]]. This study will be performed with a strong commitment to translate the results into effective approaches for prevention and therapy of [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]]. For the first time this analysis will be performed combining the 2 vaccines in pre-clinical and [[clinical studies]]. This represents the '''originality and uniqueness of the proposed project'''. "In fact this is expected to generate a global vision of the effects of the cellular and humoral [[immune responses]] on [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] infection giving to the European academic and industrial scientific community an extraordinary tool to compete at high level in developing new effective strategies for [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] preventative and therapeutic vaccines.'' 
HEPACIVAC has the ambition of becoming a '''benchmark work'''  for any other future [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] [[vaccine trial]], using a comprehensive approach to standardise the pre-clinical and [[clinical trial]] procedures while taking further the development of two promising [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] vaccines.

== Main achievements ==
=== Prophylactic clinical trials ===
The trial with Okairos vaccine candidate started on October 2008 and was completed on 31 January 2011. The primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and the [[immunogenicity]] of the heterologous prime-boost of vaccine candidate.  The vaccine showed excellent safety and immunogenicity. In the last year of the project the vaccine will be tested in healthy individuals for safety and dose optimization and in chronically infected patients (therapeutic trial).

=== Therapeutic clinical trials ===
The trial with Okairos vaccine candidate on naïve patients is in progress. The study started in November 2009. To date 23 patients have been enrolled. The primary objective of the trial is to test the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the heterologous prime-boost [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] vaccine candidate, when administered alone or in combination with the SOC therapy (pegylated-[[interferon]] and [[ribavirin]] – PEG-IFN/RBV). Preliminary results on safety indicate that all adverse events were scored mild to moderate and were of short duration. No serious adverse events related to vaccination were recorded.
