The '''Burzynski Clinic''' is a clinic in [[Texas]], [[United States]] founded in 1976 and offering unproven [[cancer treatment]]. The clinic is best known for its "antineoplaston therapy", a controversial pharmacological treatment using compounds it calls ''antineoplastons'', devised by the clinic's founder Stanislaw Burzynski in the 1970s.

The clinic has been the focus of much criticism due to the way its unproven antineoplaston therapy is promoted, the costs for cancer sufferers participating in "trials" of antineoplastons, significant problems with the way these trials are run, legal cases brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without board approval, and for other causes.

There is a [[scientific consensus]] that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and of little promise in treating cancer. Clinical trials initiated in 1993 and sponsored by the [[National Cancer Institute]] were closed due to inability to recruit qualifying patients, and a [[Mayo Clinic]] study found no benefit from antineoplaston treatment.<ref name = MSKCC>[http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/antineoplastons Antineoplastons], [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]]</ref> Some sixty phase 2 [[clinical trial]]s and one Phase 3 trial have been registered by Burzynski since the mid-1990s, but no results have been published. The [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] has stated: "Bottom Line: There is no clear evidence to support the anticancer effects of antineoplastons in humans."<ref name = MSKCC />

==Stanislaw Burzynski==
Stanislaw Rajmund Burzynski is founder,  president and chairman of the controversial Burzynski Research Institute Inc. ({{OTCBB|BZYR}}), based in [[Houston]] and [[Stafford, Texas]].

He was born on January 23, 1943 in [[Lublin]], [[Poland]]. On graduating at age 24, from the [[Medical University of Lublin|Medical Academy in Lublin]], he had reportedly already published fourteen papers.<ref name="Smith1992">{{cite journal

Burzynski immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1970 working at [[Baylor College of Medicine|Baylor College]] until 1977, when he and established the Burzynski Research Laboratory, where he administered antineoplaston therapy, initially to 21 patients then more widely as "experimental" treatment, immediately opening himself up to "charges of unethical conduct and to the suspicion he had become a merchant of false hope".<ref name=<"Smithp138">Smith, p.&nbsp;138.</ref>

Effectively having exiled himself from mainstream medicine, Burzynski pursued a course of promoting his offerings using publicity, and "aggressively [seeking] out ... terminally ill cancer patients", leading to several instances of media controversy.<ref name="Smithp138">Smith, p. 138.</ref>

== Antineoplaston therapy ==
''Antineoplaston'' is a name coined by Stanislaw Burzynski for a group of [[peptides]], peptide derivatives, and mixtures that he uses as an [[alternative cancer treatment]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Block |first1=Keith I. |title=Antineoplastons and the Challenges of Research in Integrative Care |journal=Integrative Cancer Therapies |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15035867 |doi=10.1177/1534735404263274}}</ref> The word is derived from ''[[neoplasm]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Shannon |last1=Brownlee |first2=Gary |last2=Cohen |title=Trials of a Cancer Doc: Experimental drugs and a 20-year fight with the FDA |journal=US News & World Report |pmid=10186429 |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/981005/archive_004873.htm |year=1998 |volume=125 |issue=13 |pages=28–30, 32, 35}}</ref>

Antineoplaston therapy has been offered in the US since 1984 but is not approved for general use due to lack of clinical evidence.

Burzynski stated that he began investigating the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered significant differences in peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burzynski |first1=SR |title=Antineoplastons: history of the research (I) |journal=Drugs under experimental and clinical research |volume=12 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=1–9 |year=1986 |pmid=3527634}}</ref> Burzynski first identified antineoplastons from human blood.

The first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston A-10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione).  From A-10, antineoplaston AS2-1, a 4:1 mixture of [[phenylacetic acid]] and [[phenylacetylglutamine]], was derived.<ref>NCI Drug Dictionary, [http://cancer.gov/Templates/drugdictionary.aspx?searchTxt=antineoplaston Definitions of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1]</ref> The website of the Burzynski clinic states that the active ingredient of antineoplaston A10-I is [[phenylacetylglutamine]].<ref name="pmid16484713" />

=== Publications ===
Burzynski has published a few trials claiming effectiveness for antineoplastons, although reviewers have criticized these trials as being "of a rather unclear design,"<ref name="vickers"/> and the [[National Cancer Institute]] reports that no randomized, controlled trials showing the effectiveness of antineoplastons have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.<ref name="Natcancer">{{cite web | url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/antineoplastons/patient/page2 | title=Questions and Answers About Antineoplastons | publisher=National Cancer Institute | accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> Independent researchers have failed to [[reproducibility|reproduce]] the benefits reported by Burzynski.

===Phase II trials===
{{For|definitions of clinical trial phases|clinical trial}}

A Phase II trial in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme was conducted under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute.<ref name="mayo">{{cite journal |pages=137–45 |title=Phase II study of antineoplastons A10 (NSC 648539) and AS2-1 (NSC 620261) in patients with recurrent glioma |year=1999 |last1=Buckner |first1=J C |last2=Malkin |first2=M G |last3=Reed |first3=E |last4=Cascino |first4=T L |last5=Reid |first5=J M |last6=Ames |first6=M M |last7=Tong |first7=W P |last8=Lim |first8=S |last9=Figg |first9=W D |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=74 |issue=2 |pmid=10069350|doi=10.4065/74.2.137}}</ref> Due to recruitment criteria imposed by Burzynski, over the period of two years only nine patients were accrued, six of whom were evaluated for response. All six evaluable patients showed evidence of tumor progression after treatment durations of between 16 to 66 days, and five of the six suffered neurologic side effects caused by the antineoplastons.<ref name=vickers/><ref name="mayo" /> All nine patients died, eight due to tumor progression.<ref name="vickers"/><ref name="mayo" /> The study authors concluded: "The efficacy of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 remains uncertain. We were unable to document efficacy in any of six assessable patients."<ref name="mayo" />

Since Burzynski was forced to administer the treatment only as part of a registered trial, some sixty Phase II trials have been registered with [[clinicaltrials.gov]]. No results of any of these trials have been published.

===Phase III trial===
In December 2010, a planned Phase III trial was registered but it subsequently did not open for patient recruitment.<ref name=Phase3>{{cite web|title=A Randomized Study of Antineoplaston Therapy vs. Temozolomide in Subjects With Recurrent and/or Progressive Optic Pathway Glioma (ID:NCT01260103)|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01260103?term=antineoplaston&phase=2&rank=1|publisher=[[Clinicaltrials.gov]]|accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref>

===Efficacy===
The consensus among the professional community, as represented by the [[American Cancer Society]]<ref name=ACS1 /> and [[Cancer Research UK]]<ref name="cancer-uk" /> among others, is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven, the Burzynski clinic is expensive, and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. At the same time, while the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy, it is in fact a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects.<ref name=SBM1>[http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/stanislaw-burzynskis-personalized-gene-targeted-cancer-therapy/ Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's "personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy": Can he do what he claims for cancer?], David Gorski, Science Based Medicine</ref>

The clinical [[efficacy]] of antineoplaston combinations for various diseases has been the subject of many such trials by Burzynski and his associates, but these have not produced any clear evidence of efficacy.  There is no convincing evidence from [[randomized controlled trial]]s in the [[scientific literature]] that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has not approved these products for the treatment of any disease.<ref name=ACS>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/antineoplastons/Patient/page2 Antineoplastons] ''National Cancer Institute''</ref> The [[American Cancer Society]] has stated since 1983 that there is no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects in cancer and recommended that people do not buy these products since there could be serious health consequences to patients who use this therapy.<ref name=Antineoplastic1983>{{cite journal |title=Antineoplastons |journal=CA |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=57–9 |year=1983 |pmid=6401577 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.33.1.57 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.33.1.57/pdf}}</ref><ref name=ACS1>{{cite web

In 1998, three prominent [[oncology|oncologists]] were enlisted by the weekly Washington newsletter The Cancer Letter to conduct independent reviews of Burzynski's clinical trial research on antineoplastons. They concluded that the studies were poorly designed, not interpretable, and "so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works". One of them characterized the research as "scientific nonsense".<ref name="langford1998">{{cite news |first=Terri |last=Langford |date=October 1, 1998 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19476029.html |title=Oncologists criticize methods of controversial cancer treatment |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> In addition to questioning Burzynski's research methods, the oncologists found significant and possibly life-threatening toxicity in some patients treated with antineoplastons.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Antineoplaston Anomaly: How a Drug Was Used for Decades in Thousands of Patients, With No Safety, Efficacy Data|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/burzynski2.html|accessdate=26 August 2012|newspaper=The Cancer Letter|date=September 25, 1998}}</ref>

The marketing of antineoplaston therapy as "personalized gene-targeted therapy" is also controversial as the treatment is not related to actual [[gene therapy]].<ref name=SBM1 />

== Legal issues ==

===FDA warnings===
Burzynski's use and advertising of antineoplastons as an unapproved cancer therapy were deemed to be unlawful by the U.S. FDA and the Texas [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]],<ref name=opinion>[http://www.3rdcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/HTMLopinion.asp?OpinionID=847 Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, Appellant v. Stanislaw R. Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., Appellee] Court judgement</ref><ref name="openjurist1987">[http://openjurist.org/819/f2d/1301/united-states-v-burzynski-cancer-research-institute-r 819 F.2d 1301] 1987 judgment</ref> and limits on the sale and advertising of the treatment were imposed as a result.

In 2009, the [[FDA Warning Letter|FDA issued a warning letter]] to the Burzynski Research Institute, stating that an investigation had determined the Burzynski [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) "did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and FDA regulations governing the [[Human subject research|protection of human subjects]]." It identified a number of specific findings, among them that the IRB had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized, had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation, and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies, among others.  The Institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations.<ref>{{cite web | title = 2009 Burzynski Research Institute Warning Letter | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration| url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2009/ucm192711.htm | accessdate = 2011-11-22}}</ref>

Another warning issued in October 2012 notes that the Burzynski Clinic is advertising investigational drugs as being "safe and effective", noting: {{quotation|Promotion of an investigational new drug is prohibited under FDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.7(a), which states, "A sponsor or investigator, or any person acting on behalf of a 1 sponsor or investigator, shall not represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug. This provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the drug, including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media. Rather, its intent is to restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution."<br /><br />The websites, including the posted press releases and embedded videos, contain claims such as the following that promote Antineoplastons as safe and/or effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated or otherwise promote the drugs. [...] Since Antineoplastons are investigational new drugs, the products' indication(s), warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, and dosage and administration have not been established and are unknown at this time. Promoting Antineoplastons as safe and effective for the purposes for which they are under investigation, by making representations such as those noted above, is in violation of 21 CFR 312.7(a).|FDA enforcement letter|[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM326631.pdf Original]}}

The letter requires cessation of noncompliant promotional activities, including use of testimonials and promotional interviews with Burzynski himself.<ref>[http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2012/11/07/stanislaw-burzynski-slapped-down-by-the-fda-once-again/ Respectful Insolence], ScienceBlogs, November 7, 2012</ref>

===Lawsuits===
In 1994, a court found against Burzynski in a case of [[insurance fraud]]. According to the SMU Law Review, Burzynski was found to have defrauded an [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act|ERISA]] health insurance fund by billing it for unapproved "treatment" with antineoplastons, in violation of the terms of the health plan it covered.<ref>{{cite journal

In 2010, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners filed a multi-count complaint against Burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards.<ref name=TexasMedBoard/> An appeal against the advertising restrictions on the grounds of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|free speech]] was denied on the basis that this was commercial speech promoting an unlawful activity.

Following the publicity fallout resulting from the legal threats made by Stephens against the bloggers, the Burzynski Clinic issued a press release on November 29, 2011 confirming that the Clinic had hired Stephens "to provide [[Search engine optimization|web optimization]] services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning Dr. Burzynski and the Clinic",<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0BzijOpjuex1bMjE4N2JjOGItZGFlOS00NDE0LTk2YzktMThkYjFiOTU2YjNl&hl=en_US|publisher=Burzynski Clinic|accessdate=November 29, 2011}}</ref> apologizing for comments made by Stephens to bloggers and for the posting of personal information (e.g. a satellite image of Morgan's home), and announcing that Stephens "no longer has a professional relationship with the Burzynski Clinic."

The story, including the threats against the bloggers, was covered by the ''[[BMJ]]'' (formerly the ''British Medical Journal''). The chief clinician at [[Cancer Research UK]] expressed his concern at the treatment offered, and Andy Lewis of Quackometer and science writer [[Simon Singh]], who had previously been sued by the [[British Chiropractic Association]], said that [[English defamation law|English libel law]] harms public discussion of science and medicine, and thus public health.<ref>{{cite Journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.d7865|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7865|title=Texan clinic threatens UK bloggers with legal action over criticisms of its treatments|year=2011|last1=McCartney|first1=M.|journal=BMJ|volume=343|pages=d7865|pmid=22138837}}</ref>

=== 2010 film, ''Burzynski – Cancer is Serious Business'' ===

The 2010 film, ''Burzynski, Cancer is Serious Business'', directed, written, edited, and narrated by Eric Merola, an [[art director]] of television commercials, describes Burzynski's use of antineoplastons and his legal clashes with government agencies and regulators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/movies/04burzynski.html|title=A Texas Doctor With a Possible Cancer Cure|date=2010-06-04|publisher=New York Times}} {{IMDb title|1632703|Burzynski}}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' commented that the movie "violates every basic rule of ethical filmmaking" and that by interviewing only Burzynski's supporters, the film's producer "is either unusually credulous, or doesn't understand the difference between a documentary and an advertisement".<ref>{{cite web|author=Ella Taylor |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-01/film/quack-quack-goes-burzynski/ |title=QUACK-QUACK Goes Burzynski - Page 1 - Movies - New York |publisher=Village Voice |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as having the qualities of a "paranoid [[conspiracy theory]]" and likened it to the ''[[National Enquirer]]'', adding that the film's explanatory diagrams are "simplistic to the point of idiocy". The review concluded that "despite its infotainment look, ''Burzynski'' ultimately proves convincing."<ref>{{cite web|last=Scheib |first=Ronnie |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942914?refcatid=31 |title=Variety Reviews - Burzynski - Film Reviews - New U.S. Release - Review by Ronnie Scheib |publisher=Variety.com |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> Prior to the debut of "''Burzynski''", ''[[Houston Press]]'' correspondent Craig Malisow mocked the film's lack of objectivity, characterizing it as "a puff-piece paean that cherrypicks facts and ignores any criticism", and criticized the project for presenting only Burzynski's side of the story.<ref>{{cite web|last=Malisow |first=Craig |url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2010/06/burzynski_movie.php |title=Stanlislaw Burzynski: New Movie Proves He's A Cancer-Fighting Giant - Houston News - Hair Balls |publisher=Blogs.houstonpress.com |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref>

A follow-up movie to ''Cancer is Serious Business'' is being planned for release in 2013.<ref name=sequel>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/burzynski-movie-spawns-a-sequel/ |title=Now that Burzynski has gotten off in 2012, Burzynski The Movie will spawn a sequel in 2013 |author=David Gorski, MD, PhD |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>  Based on analysis of pre-release trailers, and comments made by filmmaker Eric Merola on a video blog, [[David Gorski]], MD, PhD, [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons|FACS]]&nbsp;&ndash; Associate Professor of Surgery at the [[Wayne State University School of Medicine]], and surgical oncologist at the [[Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute]] <ref name=Gorski1>{{cite web |url=http://www.med.wayne.edu/surgery/faculty/DGorski.html |title=Department of Surgery, Faculty Info: David Gorski |publisher=Wayne State University |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=Gorski2>{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceinmedicine.org/fellows/GorskiD.html |title=Institute for Science in Medicine, ISM Fellows |publisher=Institute for Science in Medicine |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>&nbsp;&ndash; has opined that the new film will focus on "[t]estimonials (or anecdotes)...of 'success stories'"; "'conversion stories' of oncologists who have become Burzynski believers"; attacks on critics and skeptics of Burzynski; attempting to justify Burzynski's "enormous bills for his antineoplaston therapy and criticism that he's making clinical trial subjects pay" to be in such trials; and "vindication", through an as-yet unpublished clinical trial claimed by Dr. Hideaki Tsuda, an [[anesthesiologist]] at [[Kurume University|Kurume University Hospital]] in Japan, who asserts efficacy of antineoplastons in metastatic colorectal cancer.<ref name=Tsuda-trial>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/stanislaw-burzynskis-cancer-success-stories/ |title=Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski’s cancer "success" stories |author=David Gorski, MD, PhD |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>

A showing of Burzynski by [[CPT12]] generated a large number of complaints to the PBS Obmudsman, who concurred with earlier reviewers of the film that the movie displays a serious lack of objectivity. Some CPT staffers were also criticized for failing to ask Eric Merola any of the hard questions.<ref name="PBSobmudsman">{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/ombudsman/index.html | title=Cancer Is ‘Serious Business.’ Is the ‘Documentary’? | date=March 22, 2013 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Getler, Michael}}</ref>
