==Cell death and repair==
The [[hematopoietic cell]]s are most sensitive to [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] and are the first to die after reduction or removal of the blood supply, usually within 12 hours.<ref name=nawazkhan/> Experimental evidence suggests that [[bone cell]]s ([[osteocytes]], [[osteoclasts]], [[osteoblasts]] etc.) die within 12–48 hours, and that [[bone marrow fat cell]]s die within 5 days.<ref name=nawazkhan/>

Upon [[reperfusion]], repair of [[ischemic]] bone occurs in 2 phases; First, there is [[angiogenesis]] and movement of undifferentiated [[mesenchymal cell]]s from adjacent living bone tissue grow into the dead marrow spaces, as well as entry of [[macrophage]]s that degrade dead cellular and fat debris.<ref name=nawazkhan/> Second, there is [[cellular differentiation]] of mesenchymal cells into [[osteoblast]]s or [[fibroblast]]s.<ref name=nawazkhan/> Under favorable conditions, the remaining inorganic mineral volume forms a framework for establishment of new, fully functional bone tissue.<ref name=nawazkhan/>

==Presentation==
While it can affect any bone, and half of cases show multiple sites of damage, avascular necrosis primarily affects the joints at the [[shoulder]], [[knee]], and [[hip]]. The classical sites are: head of femur, neck of talus and waist of scaphoid.

Clinical avascular necrosis most commonly affects the ends ([[epiphysis]]) of long bones such as the [[femur]] (the bone extending from the knee joint to the hip joint). Other common sites include the [[humerus]] (the bone of the upper arm),<ref name=chapman>{{cite journal |pmid=15525936 |year=2004 |month=Nov |author=Chapman, C; Mattern, C; Levine, Wn |title=Arthroscopically assisted core decompression of the proximal humerus for avascular necrosis |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=1003–1006 |issn=0749-8063 |doi=10.1016/j.arthro.2004.07.003 |journal=Arthroscopy}}</ref><ref name=mansat>{{cite journal |pmid=15789002 |year=2005 |month=Mar |author=Mansat, P; Huser, L; Mansat, M; Bellumore, Y; Rongières, M; Bonnevialle, P |title=Shoulder arthroplasty for atraumatic avascular necrosis of the humeral head: nineteen shoulders followed up for a mean of seven years |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=114–120 |issn=1058-2746 |doi=10.1016/j.jse.2004.06.019 |journal=Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery}}</ref> knees,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2768301 |year=1989 |month=Aug |author=Jacobs, Ma; Loeb, Pe; Hungerford, Ds |title=Core decompression of the distal femur for avascular necrosis of the knee |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=583–7 |issn=0301-620X |journal=The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Orthopaedic doctors most often diagnose the disease except when it affects the [[osteonecrosis of the jaw|jaws]], when it is usually diagnosed and treated by dental and [[maxillofacial]] surgeons.

In the early stages, [[bone scintigraphy]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9259251 |year=1997 |month=Jun |author=Maillefert, Jf; Toubeau, M; Piroth, C; Piroth, L; Brunotte, F; Tavernier, C |title=Bone scintigraphy equipped with a pinhole collimator for diagnosis of avascular necrosis of the femoral head |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=372–377 |issn=0770-3198 |journal=Clinical rheumatology |doi=10.1007/BF02242454}}</ref> and [[MRI]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8870181 |year=1996 |month=Aug |author=Bluemke, Da; Zerhouni, Ea |title=MRI of avascular necrosis of bone |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=231–46 |issn=0899-3459 |journal=Topics in magnetic resonance imaging : TMRI |doi=10.1097/00002142-199608000-00003}}</ref> are the diagnostic modalities of choice.

X-ray images of avascular necrosis in the early stages usually appear normal. In later stages it appears relatively more radio-opaque due to the nearby living bone becoming resorbed secondary to reactive hyperemia.<ref name=nawazkhan/> The necrotic bone itself does not show increased radiographic opacity, as dead bone cannot undergo [[bone resorption]] which is carried out by living [[osteoclast]]s.<ref name=nawazkhan/> Late radiographic signs also include a radiolucency area following the collapse of [[subchondral bone]] ([[crescent sign]]) and ringed regions of radiodensity resulting from saponification and calcification of marrow fat following medullary infarcts.

==Treatment==
Avascular necrosis is especially common in the hip joint. A variety of methods are now used to treat avascular necrosis,<ref name=nih06-4857/> the most common being the [[total hip replacement]], or THR. However, THRs have a number of downsides including long recovery times and short life spans. THRs are an effective means of treatment in the geriatric population; however, doctors shy away from using them in younger patients due to the reasons above. A new, more promising treatment is [[hip resurfacing]] or metal on metal (MOM) resurfacing. It is a form of a THR, however in this procedure, only the head of the femur is removed as opposed to a THR in which the entire neck is removed. MOM resurfacing is still experimental in America but has been endorsed in Great Britain as an excellent alternative to a THR. A MOM Resurfacing may not be suitable in all cases of Avascular Necrosis, its suitability depends on how much damage has occurred to the femoral head of the patient, bone is always undergoing change or remodelling.<ref name=Hall>Hall, B., The Osteoblast and Osteocyte. Vol. 1. 1990: The Telford Press. 494.</ref> The bone is broken down by osteoclasts and rebuilt by osteoblasts.<ref name=Hall/> Some doctors also prescribe [[bisphosphonates]] (e.g. [[alendronate]]) which reduces the rate of bone breakdown by osteoclasts, thus preventing collapse (specifically of the hip) due to AVN.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15572396 |year=2005 |month=Mar |author=Agarwala, S; Jain, D; Joshi, Vr; Sule, A |title=Efficacy of alendronate, a bisphosphonate, in the treatment of AVN of the hip.

Other treatments include core decompression, where internal bone pressure is relieved by drilling a hole into the bone, and a living bone chip and an electrical device to stimulate new vascular growth are implanted; and the free vascular fibular graft (FVFG), in which a portion of the fibula, along with its blood supply, is removed and transplanted into the femoral head.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11347824 |year=2001 |month=May |author=Judet, H; Gilbert, A |title=Long-term results of free vascularized fibular grafting for femoral head necrosis |volume= 386|issue=386 |pages=114–9 |issn=0009-921X |journal=Clinical orthopaedics and related research |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0009-921X&volume=386&spage=114 |format=Free full text |doi=10.1097/00003086-200105000-00015}}</ref>

Progression of the disease could possibly be halted by transplanting nucleated cells from bone marrow into avascular necrosis lesions after core decompression, although much further research is needed to establish this technique.<ref name="pmid15743852">{{cite journal |author=Gangji V, Hauzeur JP |title=Treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head with implantation of autologous bone-marrow cells. Surgical technique |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=87 Suppl 1 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=106–112 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15743852 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.D.02662 |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/content/full/87/1_suppl_1/106}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The amount of disability that results from avascular necrosis depends on what part of the bone is affected, how large an area is involved, and how effectively the bone rebuilds itself. The process of bone rebuilding takes place after an injury as well as during normal growth.<ref name=Hall/> Normally, bone continuously breaks down and rebuilds—old bone is reabsorbed and replaced with new bone. The process keeps the skeleton strong and helps it to maintain a balance of minerals.<ref name=Hall/> In the course of avascular necrosis, however, the healing process is usually ineffective and the bone tissues break down faster than the body can repair them. If left untreated, the disease progresses, the bone collapses,<ref name=DiGiovanni/> and the joint surface breaks down,<ref name=day/> leading to pain and arthritis.<ref name=day/>

==Notable cases==
Avascular necrosis cut short the [[National Football League|football]] and [[Major League Baseball|baseball]] careers of star athlete [[Bo Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016045.html |title=ESPN.com: Bo knows stardom and disappointment |accessdate=2007-09-09 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070909234500/http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016045.html| archivedate= 9 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Ron Wolf]], assistant to the general manager of the New York Jets, had intended to take [[Brett Favre]] in the 1991 NFL draft but Favre was taken by the Falcons on the previous pick.  Wolf was hired by the Green Bay Packers and traded for Favre. After the trade, Favre was diagnosed with avascular necrosis of the hip, and doctors recommended his physical be failed, which would nullify the trade. Wolf overruled them.  Favre's accomplishments are well documented.

[[Ray Emery]], NHL goaltender suffered form AV and returned to play after surgery and lengthy rehabilitation.

[[Mike Napoli]], the starting first baseman for the Boston Red Sox, was diagnosed with AVN in winter 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Napoli Reveals Hip Condition|url=http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/8869798/mike-napoli-officially-signs-boston-red-sox-designate-chris-carpenter-assignment}}</ref>
