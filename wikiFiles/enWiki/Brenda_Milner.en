==Biography==
Dr. Brenda Milner started her career at the [[University of Cambridge]] where she received her bachelor's degree in experimental psychology in 1939.<ref name="medical news">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/226617.php</ref> Shortly after starting work on her master's degree, WWII broke out. This lead Milner to joined a team interested in distinguishing fighter pilots from bomber pilots using aptitude tests.<ref name="medical news"/> In 1944, she moved to Canada for an academic position at the Institute of Psychology at the University of Montreal.<ref name="medical news"/> Milner joined [[Wilder Penfield]] at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] in 1950 and published landmark papers with Penfield and [[William Beecher Scoville]] in 1957 and 1958.<ref name="loss of memory"/> She was the Dorothy J. Killam Professor of Psychology at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] and had an appointment at the Department of Neurology & Neurosurgery at [[McGill University]].<ref name="loss of memory"/>

===Early Life and Education===
Brenda Milner (formerly Langford) was born on July 15, 1918, in Manchester, England.<ref name=Distinguished>Brenda Milner: Distinguished scientific contribution awards for 1973. (1974). American Psychologist, 29(1), 36-38.</ref> Milner’s father was a musical critic, journalist, and teacher and her mother was a singing student.<ref name="Great">The Great Canadian Psychologist Website. (2008). Retrieved from http://www.psych.ualberta.ca/GCPWS/index.html</ref> Though she was a daughter to two musically talented parents she had no interest in music. Thus she was tutored by her father in mathematics and the arts.”<ref name="Great"/> She attended Withington Girls’ School which lead her to attend Newnham College, Cambridge, to read mathematics; however, after completing the first part of the Mathematical Tripos in 1937 Milner changed field.(<ref name=Distinguished/>  In 1939, Milner graduated with a BA degree in experimental psychology, which at that time was classified as the moral sciences.<ref name=Distinguished/> 

Her supervisor at Cambridge was [[Oliver Zangwill]] and to him she owes her first interest in human brain function.<ref name=Distinguished/>  Oliver Zangwill was a Cambridge graduate with First Class Honors with Special Distinction.<ref name=Collins>Collins, A. F. (2006). An intimate connection: Oliver zangwill and the emergence of neuropsychology in Britain. History of Psychology, 9(2), 89-112.</ref>  “He immediately began postgraduate research with [[Frederic Bartlett]], who was by then Cambridge’s first Professor of Experimental Psychology.”<ref name=Collins/> Zangwill’s career with Bartlett won him an honorable reputation.  “Working with Bartlett was of significance for Zangwill’s career as Bartlett had an extraordinarily powerful effect on the shape of British academic psychology.”<ref name=Collins/> 

Milner was awarded a Sarah Smithson Research Studentship by Newnham College after her graduation near the time of World War II, which allowed her to attended Newnham for the following two years.<ref name=Distinguished/> As a result of World War II the work of the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, under Bartlett’s leadership, was diverted almost overnight to applied research in the selection of aircrew.<ref name=Distinguished/>  Milner's position in this was to devise perceptual tasks for future use in selecting aircrew.<ref name=Distinguished/>  “Later in the war, from 1941 to 1944, she worked in Malvern as an Experimental Officer for the Ministry of Supply, investigating different methods of display and control to be used by radar operators.”<ref name=Distinguished/> 

Following Milner’s move to Canada she was a PhD candidate in psychophysiology at McGill University, under the direction of the distinguished Dr. [[Donald Olding Hebb]].<ref name="Milner 2012"/> Hebb gave her an opportunity to study alongside Dr. [[Wilder Penfield]]  with one of his patients at the Montreal Neurological Institute in 1950,<ref name=Distinguished/> and in 1952 Milner received her PhD in experimental psychology under Hebb.<ref name="Great"/> “She also had the chance to work alongside Dr. Wilder Penfield, with whom she studied the behavior of epileptic patients treated with focal ablation of brain tissue.” <ref name="Milner 2012">Brenda Milner. (2012). Retrieved from http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://www.ordre-national.gouv.qc.ca/membres/membre.asp?id=126</ref>  Dr. Wilder Penfield went to medical school at Oxford for two years and then he attended Johns Hopkins Medical School where he received his M.D. in 1918.<ref>Leitch, A.

===Marriage===
Prior to Milner’s master’s degree she met her husband, Peter Milner. He was an electrical engineer who had also been recruited for the war effort.<ref name="Great"/>  In 1944 they married and left England for Canada.<ref name=Distinguished/>  “Peter was invited to Canada to work with physicists on atomic research.”<ref name="Great"/>  Their move to Canada brought Milner to new opportunities for her and neuropsychology.

===Life Achievements===
Milner published an article in the McGill University Psychological Bulletin in 1954 entitled “Intellectual Function of the Temporal Lobes”; within this publication she brought to light that temporal lobe damage can cause emotional and intellectual changes in humans and lower primates.<ref>“Intellectual Function of the Temporal Lobes.”  The Psychological Bulletin. Vol. 51. No. 1, 1954</ref> In this work, Milner reviewed animal studies of neural function and compared it to human neuroscience work.  Her publication discouraged many neurosurgeons from completing surgeries on human beings that could negatively impact their lives. “Milner’s early work on the temporal lobes was influenced by the results of ablation work with lower primates, and particularly by Mishkin and Pribram’s discovery of the role of the inferotemporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning.” <ref name="Milner 2012"/>

Milner was a pioneer in the field of neuropsychology and in the study of [[memory]] and other [[cognition|cognitive]] functions in humankind. She studied the effects of damage to the [[medial temporal lobe]] on memory and systematically described the deficits in the most famous patient in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[Henry Molaison]], formerly known as patient H.M. Though he was not able to remember new events he was able to learn new [[motor skills]].<ref name="chrcrm"/> Milner was invited to Hartford to study H.M., “who had undergone a bilateral temporal lobectomy that included removal of major portions of the hippocampus.”<ref name=Turner>Turner, M. S. (2010). Tracing Permanent Memories. The DANA Foundation , Retrieved from http://www.dana.org/news/features/detail.aspx?id=25322</ref> 

In the early stages of her work with H.M., Milner wanted to completely understand his memory impairments. Dr. Milner showed that the medial temporal lobe [[amnesia|amnestic]] syndrome is characterized by an inability to acquire new memories and an inability to recall established memories from a few years immediately before damage, while memories from the more remote past and other cognitive abilities, including [[language]], [[perception]] and [[reasoning]] were intact.<ref name="mcgill">http://www.mcgill.ca/about/history/mcgill-pioneers/milner</ref> For example, Milner spent three days with H.M. as he learned a new perceptual-motor task in order to determine what type of learning and memory were intact in him. This task involved reproducing a drawing of a star by looking at it in a mirror.<ref name=Turner/> His performance improved over those three days. However, he retained absolutely no memory of any events that took place during those three days.<ref name=Turner/> This led Milner to speculate that there are different types of learning and memory, each dependent on a separate system of the brain .<ref name=Xia>Xia, C. (2006). Understanding the Human Brain: A lifetime of Dedicated Pursuit. Interview with Dr. Brenda Milner. McGill Journal of Medicine, 9(2), 165–172. Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323518/</ref> She was able to demonstrate two different memory systems- [[episodic memory]] and [[procedural memory]].<ref name="chrcrm"/>

Milner discovered from H.M. and other case studies that "bilateral medial temporal-lobe resection in man results in a persistent impairment of recent memory whenever the removal is carried far enough posteriorly to damage portions of the anterior hippocampus and hippocampal gyrus." <ref name="loss of memory">BEECHER SCOVIILLE, W., & Milner, B. (1957). Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiat.,, 20(11), 11-21. Retrieved from http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/20/1/11.short</ref> She showed that in patients with this syndrome the ability to learn certain [[motor skill]]s remained normal.<ref name="loss of memory"/> This finding introduced the concept of multiple memory systems within the brain and stimulated an enormous body of research.  Milner stated in an interview with the McGill Journal of Medicine, “To see that HM had learned the task perfectly but with absolutely no awareness that he had done it before was an amazing dissociation. If you want to know what was an exciting moment of my life, that was one."<ref name=Xia/> 

She has made major contributions to the understanding of the role of the [[frontal lobe]]s in memory processing, in the area of organizing information. "Dr. Milner's seminal research has provided many landmark discoveries in the study of human memory and the brain's temporal lobes, which play a key role in emotional responses, [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[memory]] and [[speech]]." <ref name="loss of memory"/> 

She demonstrated the critical role of the dorsolateral frontal cortex for the temporal organization of memory and her work showed that there is partial separability of the neural circuits subserving recognition memory from those mediating memory for temporal order. She described the inflexibility in [[problem solving]] that is now widely recognized as a common consequence of frontal-lobe injury. These refinements in the understanding of memory and exposition of the relevant brain regions revealed the diffuse nature of complex cognitive functions in the brain. 

Milner helped describe the [[lateralization]] of function in the human brain and has shown how the representation of language in the cerebral hemispheres can vary in left-handed, right-handed and ambidextrous individuals (see [[handedness]]). These studies of the relationship between hand preference and [[Speech communication|speech]] lateralization led to an understanding of the effects of early unilateral brain lesions on the pattern of cerebral organization at maturity. Her studies were among the first to demonstrate convincingly that damage to the brain can lead to dramatic functional reorganization.

==Awards/Honours==
Milner has received numerous awards for her contributions to neuroscience and psychology including memberships in the [[Royal Society of London]], the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="chrcrm"/> 

Early on, Milner was awarded a Sarah Smithson Research Studentship by Newnham College, Cambridge after her graduation, which allowed her to attended Newnham.<ref name="Distinguished"/> In 1984 Milner was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] and was promoted to Companion in 2004. She was also awarded the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] Award in the Neurosciences in 2004 for her seminal investigations of the role of the temporal lobes and other brain regions in learning, memory, and language.<ref>Nas Award in the Neurosciences. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/neurosciences.html</ref>   In 1985, she was made an Officer of the [[National Order of Quebec]] and was promoted to Grand Officer in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ordre-national.gouv.qc.ca/membres/membre.asp?id=126|title=National Order of Quebec citation|language=French}}</ref> She was awarded the Balzan Prize for her contributions to Cognitive Neurosciences in a ceremony held in the Swiss Parliament in December 2009.<ref name= "Milner Wins"/>

==Current Life/Research==

Currently in her nineties, Milner is still teaching and researching. She is the Dorothy J. Killam Professor at the Montreal Neurological Institute, and a professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University.<ref name="chrcrm"/> One of Milner's current collaborators is Denise Klein, an assistant professor in the Neurology/Cognitive Neuroscience unit at McGill.<ref name="Great"/> Their research on bilingualism entails investigating the difference in neural pathways used to acquire new and native languages.<ref name="Great"/> nr

Recently, she expanded her research to the study of brain activity in normal subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).<ref name="chrcrm">http://www.chrcrm.org/en/rotm/dr-brenda-milner</ref>  These studies focus on the identification of brain regions associated with [[spatial memory]] and language, including the neural substrates of unilingual and [[bilingualism|bilingual]] speech processing.<ref name="chrcrm"/>
