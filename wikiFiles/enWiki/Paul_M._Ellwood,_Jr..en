'''Paul M. Ellwood, Jr.''' (born 16 July 1926) is a prominent figure in [[Health care in the United States|American health care]]. Often referred to as the "[[father of]] the [[health maintenance organization]],"<ref>See, for instance, [http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/business/hillary-clinton-s-potent-brain-trust-on-health-reform.html Robin Toner, "Hillary Clinton’s Potent Brain Trust on Health Reform," The New York Times, February 28, 1993, section 3, p. 1]; and Michael Booth, "The Latest from the Father of the HMO," Corporate Report Minnesota, Cover Story, October 1991.</ref><ref>In [http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/9711/9711.qnaellwood.html "New Optimism from the Father of the HMO, An Interview with Paul Ellwood Jr., MD," Managed Care (November 1997)], Ellwood reports he coined the term in May 1970 for the Nixon Administration.</ref> he not only coined the term, he also played a role in bringing about structural changes to the [[American health care system]] to simultaneously control cost and promote health by replacing [[fee-for-service]] with prepaid, comprehensive care.<ref>{{cite book |last=Starr |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Starr |url=http://books.google.com/?id=FK4pBXGvQzoC&vq=%22The+Social+Transformation+Of+American+Medicine%22+Basic+Books |title=[[The Social Transformation of American Medicine]] |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=1982 |page=395 |isbn=0-465-07935-0}}</ref> The term "HMO" was coined by Dr. Paul M.

Ellwood began his career as a [[pediatrics|pediatric]] [[neurologist]], specializing in [[polio]] at the height of the [[History of poliomyelitis|international polio epidemic]] in the early 1950s. The epidemic subsided with the introduction of the [[polio vaccine]] by [[Jonas Salk]]. The [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Institute]], which Ellwood directed, then filled its vacant beds with children suffering from [[learning disabilities]]. According to Ellwood, one evening while doing rounds amid crying children, it struck him that they were making decisions for economic reasons (the need to fill hospital beds) that were not in the best interests of patients. His growing conviction that this calculus &ndash; putting the interests of health care providers over patient well-being &ndash; characterized the American medical system in general, led him to conceive of and advocate for alternative approaches.<ref name="aha"/>

He served as the founder and president of the Jackson Hole Group from 1971 to 2002.

==Health Maintenance Organizations and managed competition==
{{main|Health maintenance organization}}
In 1970<ref name="who"/> Ellwood was invited to consult with President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon's]] staff to reshape national health policy, where he advanced the idea of giving consumers a choice among health plans that would compete on price and quality. He coined the term Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, to describe groups of physicians who were pre-paid on a per-patient basis ([[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation]]) instead of a [[fee-for-service]] arrangement. While the term "HMO" was Ellwood’s, this institutional model already existed in the form of the non-profit [[Kaiser Permanente|Kaiser health plan]] in California. Ellwood argued that creating a system of many competing HMOs would give health providers an incentive to keep patients well while driving down health care costs. Doctors would promote [[preventive medicine]] and would be less inclined to order costly procedures that had not been proven to improve health outcomes. Ellwood’s work with the [[Nixon administration]] culminated in the passage of the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]].<ref name="Q&A"/> The result was a dramatic change to the landscape of health care in the United States: the proliferation of HMOs, [[Preferred Provider Organization]]s (PPOs), and [[Managed Care#Independent Practice Association|Independent Provider Associations]] (IPAs) alongside traditional [[fee-for-service]] arrangements.

In 1971, Ellwood founded the Jackson Hole Group, a "loosely organized but highly regarded" group of politicians, providers, and policymakers who came together in the town of [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] to discuss ideas for changing the health care incentive structure.<ref name="Q&A"/> A key member of the group was [[Alain Enthoven]], a [[Stanford]] [[economist]] who was instrumental in shaping the concept of "managed competition" in health care. By influencing policy, as well as the decision-making of some in the [[Health care industry|health care]] and [[insurance]] industries, he and his colleagues would have a major impact on the changing shape of health care for decades.<ref>See for instance "Jackson Hole Revisited: How a Group of Health Policy Thinkers Transformed the Nation’s Healthcare System" Health Leaders, June 2001; [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3257/is_n11_v48/ai_16443634/ Richard L. Clarke, "Paul M. Ellwood, MD: Reforming Health Care from Jackson Hole," Healthcare Financial Management, November 1994];  and [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2002/06/10/gvsa0610.htm Amy Snow Landa, amednews staff, "''Jackson Hole Group Hopes to Spark a Revival''"], American Medical Association, amednews.com, June 10, 2002.</ref>

==Controversy over HMOs==
Subsequently, when the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration was grappling with [[health care reform]], the Jackson Hole Group, according to the [[New York Times]], was "one of the most important influences in the shaping of the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton plan]]."<ref name="Toner1993-02-28NYTimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/business/hillary-clinton-s-potent-brain-trust-on-health-reform.html|title=Hillary Clinton’s Potent Brain Trust on Health Reform|last=Toner|first=Robin|date=1993-02-28|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|pages=section 3, page 1|accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> The plan was called managed competition, and two of its most prominent advocates from the Jackson Hole Group were Ellwood and [[Alain Enthoven]].  In essence, the concept was that groups of [[health care provider]]s and [[insurance|insurers]] would compete with each other to get the business of large [[cooperative]]s seeking [[insurance]]. In the end the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton reform plan]] collapsed.  By then, the Jackson Hole Group had distanced itself due to disagreement about the degree of regulation the plan sought to impose, and Ellwood had become a pioneer in outcomes management.<ref>See Emling. Also [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2002/06/10/gvsa0610.htm Amy Snow Landa, amednews staff, "''Jackson Hole Group Hopes to Spark a Revival''"], American Medical Association, amednews.com, June 10, 2002.  For Ellwood’s critique of the Clinton plan, see Paul M. Ellwood, "Balance the Health Budget," [[The New York Times]] editorial, December 6, 1993, p. 10.</ref>

The spread of HMOs and other pre-paid health plans has spawned significant debate about the impact on quality of care.  From the beginning, critics argued that pre-paid competitive plans like HMOs provided incentives for doctors and hospitals to "skimp" on care.<ref>"Health Care: the Cost Crisis is Over – But What about Quality?" [[Business Week]], October 21, 1985.</ref> Many have complained that the plans restrict providers’ autonomy and patients’ choice of doctors. On the left, advocates of a [[Health care in Canada|Canadian style government health plan]] have argued that the Managed Competition approach enriches the insurance industry at patient and taxpayer expense and relies naively on free market forces.<ref>Erik Eckholm, "On ‘Managed Competition’: Primer on Health-Care Idea," [[The New York Times]], May 1, 1993, provides a discussion over managed competition, including critiques from both the left and right.</ref> Many proponents of the managed competition approach, including Ellwood, argue that regulations built into the legislation have undermined the market competition that was meant to enable patients and providers to choose among plans based on quality and cost.<ref>{{cite journal|last=[[Paul Starr|Starr, Paul]]|date=Winter 1976|title=The Undelivered Health System|journal=[[The Public Interest]]|issue=42|url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/the-undelivered-health-system |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref><ref name="pmid3710412">{{Cite pmid|3710412}}</ref> Ellwood has repeatedly expressed disappointment with the way his concepts played out. "What went wrong?" he reflected in 2011. "Political expediency in the initial plan designed to promote HMO growth led to the inclusion of three mistakes: for-profit plans, independent practice associations, and the failure to include outcome accountability."<ref>American Hospital Association interview, p. 16.</ref> Ellwood was particularly adamant about the last.  Without measures of health outcomes, which he had advocated from the beginning, there was no way to really know how the changes in health care organization were affecting patients. More important, there was no way to ensure that patients and providers were making good decisions. And there was no way to hold health providers accountable, to ensure that they were not reducing costs in ways that hurt patients.<ref>For a discussion of the debates over HMOs and the evolution of Ellwood’s thinking, see [http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/magazine/but-what-about-quality.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm Lisa Belkin, "But What About Quality?"] [[The New York Times Magazine]], December 8, 1996.</ref>

==Outcomes management==
Ellwood’s concern about the importance of measuring health outcomes that would hold health providers accountable for quality dated to the mid-1960s. In 1968, as an adviser to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] administration, he devised the plans for the establishment of U.S. [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ). He would become increasingly vocal about the need for evidence-based medicine and outcomes accountability.

In 1988, he was invited by the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]], which publishes the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], to deliver their annual Shattuck Lecture. He called for "a national data base containing information and analysis on clinical, financial, and health outcomes that estimates as best we can the relation between medical interventions and health outcomes, as well as the relation between health outcomes and money."<ref name="pmid3367968">{{Cite pmid|3367968}}</ref> He envisioned a sort of health plan "report card" that would allow patients to make informed choices among health plans based on health outcomes for specific conditions and patients’ reports of their satisfaction.  He argues that there is extraordinary variation in the quality-performance of different doctors and health institutions, yet patients, insurers, policymakers and even other doctors have few tools for assessing quality. Similarly, doctors and patients often choose medical interventions with only limited information about the effectiveness of various treatments and how they impact patients’ quality of life; a health outcomes data base would vastly improve the information available when making such decisions. Finally, a health outcomes data-base would guide policymakers and large providers in the overall design of health systems. The [[Mayo Clinic]] and some health providers have begun to experiment with outcomes management.<ref name="pmid7988991">{{Cite pmid|7988991}}</ref>

==Family==
Ellwood and his former wife, Elizabeth Ann Schwenk,<ref name="who"/> have three children: Deborah Ellwood, who directs a national consortium of community foundations; Cynthia Ellwood, a regional superintendent in the [[Milwaukee Public Schools|Milwaukee school system]]; and [[David T. Ellwood|David Ellwood]], Dean of the [[Kennedy School]] at [[Harvard]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/magazine/but-what-about-quality.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=But What About Quality? |last=Belkin |first=Lisa |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 December 1996 |accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref> On December 8, 1996, The [[New York Times Magazine]] ran back-to-back stories about Paul Ellwood and David Ellwood under the cover banner, "What Have the Ellwoods Done to America?" &ndash; a reference to Paul Ellwood’s role in reshaping American health care and his son’s role in reshaping the [[Social programs in the United States|American welfare system]].<ref>The cover subheading read, "The visionary father transformed the American way of health.  The visionary son redefined the American way of welfare.  Now both are struggling to rescue their reforms."  Lisa Belkin, "[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/magazine/but-what-about-quality.html But What About Quality?]" (on Paul Ellwood), and Jason DeParle, "Mugged by Reality" (on David Ellwood), [[The New York Times Magazine]], December 8, 1996.</ref>

==Quotations about Paul Ellwood==
* "But those who judge Ellwood’s dreams by whether they can be realized are missing the point. The power of Ellwood’s journeys lies less in their completion than in the landscape they change along the way." &ndash; Lisa Belkin, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' cover story, December 8, 1996
* "Ellwood is to the national health care industry as Sony is to the world of electronics.  Every few years, he offers up a concept that changes things so radically that no one can remember what things were like before." &ndash; Michael Booth, Corporate Report Minnesota, October, 1991
* "More than anyone else, he has ceaselessly nudged the bloated leviathan of American medical care to get it moving toward the white waters of competition." &ndash; Edmund Faltermayer, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', 1978
* "Paul Ellwood has been called one of the most important figures in American healthcare in the last half century.  The title is a well-earned product of more than two decades of persuasion and advocacy, blended with disciplined research and a courageous spirit of innovation." &ndash; from the citation given to Paul Ellwood when the [[American College of Healthcare Executives]] invited him to becomes an honorary fellow, 1987
* "Ellwood serves us, and the health care system, by clearly describing the key elements and benefits of this vision.  The challenge for all of us is to follow Ellwood’s lead and to help explain this vision to the public and to the policymakers so that it can be fully considered as an option in reforming our health care system" &ndash; Charles R. Buck, Jr., Sc.D., General Electric, forward to "Managed Care:  Strategic Model or Bandage?  A Conversation with Paul M. Ellwood, M.D.," an interview by J. Zabludoff, Decisions in ''Imaging Economics'', fall 1992
* "Dr. Ellwood has earned the reputation as one of the health care field’s most accurate futurists. Whether through his discernment of coming change or his creation of it, Dr. Ellwood has frequently demonstrated a visionary ability to understand what health care will become." &ndash; ''Who’s Who in Managed Health Care'', HealthQuest Publishers, 1994
