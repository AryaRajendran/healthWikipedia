'''''Uinyeo''''' (literally "medicine women"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lCIwY3i_XBwC&pg=PA10&dq=uinyo |title=Women Struggling for a New Life: The Role of Religion in the Cultural Passage from Korea to America |author=Kim, Ai Ra |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=10 |isbn=0-7914-2737-4|year=1996}}</ref>) were female [[physician]]s who specialized in the treatment of women during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392 &ndash; 1910) of [[Korea]].<ref name="Han, Hee-sook">{{cite journal|url=http://khistory.korea.ac.kr/bbs/table/koreanhistory/upload/2217_005.pdf |publisher=International Journal of Korean History |title=Women’s Life during the Chosŏn Dynasty |author=Han, Hee-sook |date=December 2004 |volume=6 |pages=31&ndash;34}}</ref>  The uinyeo were established as a solution to social taboos against women receiving treatment from male physicians.  The ''uinyeo'' system first appeared in 1406 after [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]] ordered its establishment within the ''[[Jesaengwon]]'' (濟生院 health care centers for commoners).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=11281&page=1&c_code=&search_field=all&keyword=uinyeo&order=g_korean&kanada= |title=의녀(醫女), uinyeo |publisher=[[The Academy of Korean Studies]] |language=Korean/English}}</ref>

== Establishment ==
The proposal for establishing Uinyeo originated with [[Heo Do]] (許道), a government officer who held the title of ''Jijesaengwonsa'' (知濟生院事).  He suggested to the king that a number of intelligent young women should receive medical training to treat women. Although the uinyeo system started to practise medicine, it was deeply related to a Korean traditional custom at the time. The Joseon Dynasty was a strict [[Confucian]] state that strengthened the distinction between the sexes which was called ''[[naeoe]]'' (內外; [[sex segregation]]). Therefore there were many cases in which female patients died without receiving  proper treatment because they felt ashamed of being examined by a male doctor.<ref name="Han, Hee-sook" /> On the other hand, ''[[jungin]]'' (middle-class people) and ''[[sangmin]]'' (commoners) did not want to become a ''uinyeo'' for the custom, so young girls who belonged to stores and offices in the palace as slaves were trained in medicine for this purpose.<ref name="EncyKorea">{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=258370&v=44 |title=의녀 (醫女) |publisher=[[Empas]] / [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean}}</ref><ref name="Britannica">{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=178714&v=44 |title=의녀 (醫女) |publisher=[[Empas]] / [[Britannica]] |language=Korean}}</ref>

== Medical training and practice ==
The ''Jesaengwon'' chose ''uinyeo'' and taught [[Maijing]] (脈經; Pulse Classic<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nricm.edu.tw/web/WORD?keyword=&groupId=0&command=home&keywordtype=0&scly=&pageNo=9 |title=中文詞彙|publisher=National Research Institute Of Chinese Medicine |language=Chinese}}</ref>) and the practice of [[acupuncture]] and [[moxibustion]].<ref name="EncyKorea" /><ref name="Britannica" />

In July 1434, the 16th year of [[Sejong the Great]]'s reign, the government gave ''uninyeo'' of ''Jesaengwon'' a stipend of rice twice a year as an incentive, based upon precedents of payments to female slaves. In February 1498, the 9th year of the [[Seongjong of Joseon|King Seongjong]], [[Yejo]] (Ministry of Rites<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=4622&page=1&c_code=&search_field=all&keyword=%E6%9B%B9&order=g_korean&kanada= |title=예조(禮曹), Yejo  |publisher=The Academy of Korean Studies|language=Korean/English}}</ref>) revised six clauses of law to codify a system that divided ''uinyeo'' into the three grades: ''naeuinyeo'' (inner uineyo), ''ganbyeong uinyeo'' (nursing uinyeo) and ''chohak uinyeo'' (beginner uinyeo) according to their educational grade.<ref name="EncyKorea" />

According to records of the ''[[Sokdaejeon]]'' (續大典, "Supplement to the [[Gyeongguk daejeon|Nation code]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=3934&page=1&c_code=&search_field=g_korean&keyword=%EC%86%8D%EB%8C%80%EC%A0%84&order=g_korean&kanada= |title=속대전(續大典), Sok-daejeon  |publisher=[[The Academy of Korean Studies]] |language=Korean/English}}</ref>) ''uinyeo'' were generally divided into two types; ''naeguk yeoui'' (內局女醫, female physicians at ''naeuiwon'') or called ''naeuinyeo'' and ''hyeminseo yeoui'' (惠民署女醫, female physicians at ''[[hyeminseo]]''). The distinction was made to encourage ''uinyeo'' since [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]]'s reign and had lasted until the end of the Joseon Dynasty. While ''naeuinyeo'' worked within the palace, the other group of ''uinyeo'' worked for ''hyeminseo'', the state-sponsored health clinics located in certain areas of the country.<ref name="Han, Hee-sook" /><ref name="EncyKorea" />

== Mobilization as entertainers ==
In the end of [[Seongjong of Joseon|King Seongjong]]'s reign, while ''uinyeo'' were sent to attend parties and feasts held for official and private occasions, they were not invited along with ''[[gisaeng]]'' (female entertainers).  [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|King Yeonsangun]], however, was a tyrant ruler known for enjoying parties changed this practice. In June 1502, the king's 8th year, ''uinyeo'' were sent to families who were holding a wedding to investigate marriage presents on the day that the family sent the dowry. The rationale for the investigation was that the rich people at that time wasted money for too luxurious wedding items. From that time onward, whenever a feast was held, ''uinyeo'' participated openly together with ''gisaeng'', sitting on stone steps to the present of the king. They also began to learn music in addition to medicine.<ref name="Han, Hee-sook" /><ref name="EncyKorea" /> 

When the successor, [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] ascended to the throne, ''uinyeo'' still served as ''uigi'' (medical entertainer) at court officers' parties. After 1510, the fifth year of the King's reign, the government prohibited ''uinyeo'' from attending parties by law several times, and forced them to go back to their original mission in medicine. In spite of this effort, the once strict morality was not rectified, and ''uinyeo'' still attended parties. At feasts, ''uinyeo'' who worked at ''[[naeuiwon]]'' (royal health clinic) wore a ''garima'' (a kind of crown) made with a black silk, while ''gisaeng'' wore a black ''po'' on their head. As ''uinyeo'' who belonged to ''[[hyeminseo]]'' (clinics for the public) were called ''"yakbang gisaeng"'' (entertainers of the medicine room) and regarded the first rated entertainers over other female official entertainers assigned to government offices.<ref name="EncyKorea" />

Due to their lowborn origin, ''uinyeo'' did not gain the same social status as male doctors and barely retained their existence as a group of the lowest class of society.<ref name="EncyKorea" />
