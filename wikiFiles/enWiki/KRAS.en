'''GTPase KRas''' also known as '''V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog''' and '''KRAS''', is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''KRAS'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid6308466">{{cite journal | author = McGrath JP, Capon DJ, Smith DH, Chen EY, Seeburg PH, Goeddel DV, Levinson AD | title = Structure and organization of the human Ki-ras proto-oncogene and a related processed pseudogene | journal = Nature | volume = 304 | issue = 5926 | pages = 501–6 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6308466 | doi = 10.1038/304501a0| url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid3856955">{{cite journal | author = Popescu NC, Amsbaugh SC, DiPaolo JA, Tronick SR, Aaronson SA, Swan DC | title = Chromosomal localization of three human ras genes by in situ molecular hybridization | journal = Somat.

The protein product of the normal KRAS gene performs an essential function in normal tissue signaling, and the mutation of a KRAS gene is an essential step in the development of many [[cancer]]s.<ref name="pmid16269215">{{cite journal | author = Kranenburg O | title = The KRAS oncogene: past, present, and future | journal = Biochim.

KRAS is usually tethered to [[cell membranes]] because of the presence of an [[isoprenyl]] group on its [[C-terminus]].

==Function==

KRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch. Once it is turned on, it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of [[growth factor]] and other receptors' signal such as [[c-Raf]] and [[PI 3-kinase]].  KRAS binds to [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] in the active state and possesses an intrinsic enzymatic activity which cleaves the terminal phosphate of the nucleotide converting it to [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]]. Upon conversion of GTP to GDP, KRAS is turned off.  The rate of conversion is usually slow but can be sped up dramatically by an accessory protein of the [[GTPase-activating protein]] (GAP) class, for example [[RasGAP]].  In turn KRAS can bind to proteins of the [[Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor]] (GEF) class, for example [[SOS1]], which forces the release of bound nucleotide.  Subsequently,  KRAS binds GTP  present in the [[cytosol]] and the GEF is released from  ras-GTP.

Other members of the Ras family include: [[HRAS]] and [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRAS]].  These proteins all are regulated in the same manner and appear to differ largely in their sites of action within the cell.

==Clinical significance==

This [[proto-oncogene]] is a Kirsten ras [[oncogene]] homolog from the mammalian ras gene family. A single amino acid substitution, and in particular a single nucleotide substitution, is responsible for an activating mutation. The transforming protein that results is implicated in various malignancies, including [[lung adenocarcinoma]], [[mucinous adenoma]], [[ductal carcinoma]] of the [[pancreas]] and [[colorectal carcinoma]].

Several [[germline]] KRAS mutations have been found to be associated with [[Noonan syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schubbert S, Zenker M, Rowe SL, ''et al.'' |title=Germline KRAS mutations cause Noonan syndrome |journal=Nat.

[[Somatic]] KRAS mutations are found at high rates in [[leukemia]]s, [[colon cancer]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burmer GC, Loeb LA |title=Mutations in the KRAS2 oncogene during progressive stages of human colon carcinoma |journal=Proc.

===Colorectal cancer===
The chronological order of mutations is important in the impact of KRAS mutations in regard to [[colorectal cancer]], with a primary KRAS mutation generally leading to a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion, but if occurring after a previous [[APC mutation]] it often progresses to cancer.<ref>{{cite pmid|15286780}}</ref>

KRAS mutation is predictive of a very poor response to [[panitumumab]] (Vectibix®) and [[cetuximab]] (Erbitux®) therapy in colorectal cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lièvre A, Bachet JB, Le Corre D, ''et al.'' |title=KRAS mutation status is predictive of response to cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=3992–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16618717 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0191}}</ref>
Currently, the most reliable way to predict whether a colorectal cancer patient will respond to one of the [[EGFR inhibitor|EGFR-inhibiting drug]]s is to test for certain “activating” mutations in the gene that encodes KRAS, which occur in 40% of colorectal cancers. Studies show patients whose tumors express the mutated version of the KRAS gene will not respond to cetuximab or panitumumab.<ref>{{cite news |first=Heather|last=L. van Epps, PhD |title= Bittersweet Gene: A gene called KRAS can predict  which colorectal cancers will respond to a certain type of treatment—and which will not. |date=Winter, 2008 |publisher=CURE (Cancer Updates, Research and Education) |url=http://www.curetoday.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/article.show/id/2/article_id/943}}</ref>

Although presence of the wild-type (or normal) KRAS gene does not guarantee that these drugs will work, a number of large studies<ref name="pmid19114683">{{cite journal | author = Bokemeyer C, Bondarenko I, Makhson A, Hartmann JT, Aparicio J, de Braud F, Donea S, Ludwig H, Schuch G, Stroh C, Loos AH, Zubel A, Koralewski P | title = Fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin with and without cetuximab in the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer | journal = J.

=== Lung cancer ===

Whether a patient is positive or negative for a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) will predict how patients will respond to certain EGFR drugs such as erlotinib (Tarceva). EGFR positive patients have an impressive 60% response rate to erlotinib.  However, KRAS positivity and EGFR positivity are generally mutually exclusive.<ref name="pmid20108024">{{cite journal | author = Suda K, Tomizawa K, Mitsudomi T | title = Biological and clinical significance of KRAS mutations in lung cancer: an oncogenic driver that contrasts with EGFR mutation | journal = Cancer Metastasis Rev. | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–60 | year = 2010 | month = March | pmid = 20108024 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-010-9209-4 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid19349489">{{cite journal | author = Riely GJ, Marks J, Pao W | title = KRAS mutations in non-small cell lung cancer | journal = Proc Am Thorac Soc | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–5 | year = 2009 | month = April | pmid = 19349489 | doi = 10.1513/pats.200809-107LC | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid15696205">{{cite journal | author = Pao W, Wang TY, Riely GJ, Miller VA, Pan Q, Ladanyi M, Zakowski MF, Heelan RT, Kris MG, Varmus HE | title = KRAS mutations and primary resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to gefitinib or erlotinib | journal = PLoS Med. | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = e17 | year = 2005 | month = January | pmid = 15696205 | pmc = 545207 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020017 | url =  }}</ref> Lung cancer patients who are KRAS positive have a low response rate to Tarceva estimated at 5% or less.<ref name="pmid20108024"/>

==KRAS Testing==
