==Background==

Before the 1992 implementation of the [[Medicare fee schedule]], physician payments were made under the "[[usual, customary and reasonable]]" payment model (a "charge-based" payment system). Physician services were largely considered to be misvalued under this system, with evaluation and management services being undervalued and procedures overvalued.<ref name="MPP">{{cite web |title=Report to the Congress: Medicare Payment Policy |url=http://www.medpac.gov/documents/Mar06_EntireReport.pdf |work=[[Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]] |page=137 |date=March 2006 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref> Third-party payers (public and private health insurance) advocated an improved model to replace the UCR fees, which had been associated with stark examples of [[Specialty (medicine)|specialist]]s making significantly higher sums of money than [[primary care physician]]s.<ref name="Better">{{cite book |title=Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance |last=Gawande |first=Atul |authorlink=Atul Gawande |year=2007 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |isbn=0-312-42765-4 |page=115 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-EUba-LKZ04C&pg=PT83&dq=in+the+mid-eighties,+doctors+who+spent+an+hour+making+a+complex+and+lifesaving+diagnosis+were+paid+forty+dollars&hl=en&ei=M047TsqOF-fk0QHzxo2zCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=in%20the%20mid-eighties%2C%20doctors%20who%20spent%20an%20hour%20making%20a%20complex%20and%20lifesaving%20diagnosis%20were%20paid%20forty%20dollars&f=false}}</ref>

However, RBRVS was never fully implemented, partially due to RUC.<ref name="Reflections">{{Cite journal | author=[[Steven A.

==Workings==

RUC was established in 1991 by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[medical specialist]] groups.<ref name="PrescribesFees">{{cite news |title=Physician Panel Prescribes the Fees Paid by Medicare |author=Anna Wilde Mathews and Tom McGinty |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 26, 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704657304575540440173772102.html |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> The AMA sponsors RUC "both as an exercise of 'its First Amendment rights to petition the Federal Government' and for 'monitoring economic trends ... related to the CPT [Current Procedures and Terminology] development process".<ref name="Unintended"/> 

RUC is highly influential because it ''de facto'' sets Medicare valuations of physician work [[relative value units]] (RVUs)<ref name="LittleKnown"/> of [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT) codes.<ref name="Every">{{cite journal| author=Moore KJ, Felger TA, Larimore WL, Mills TL| title=What every physician should know about the RUC | journal=[[Fam Pract Manag]] |month=February | year= 2008 | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 36–9 | pmid=18303653 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0200/p36.html}}</ref> (The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) is the ''de jure'' work RVU determining body.)

In 2002, a RUC update of values raised concerns that the process, which was initatied by medical speciality groups, unfairly cut [[primary care physician]] pay.<ref name="Rapidly">{{cite journal| author=Ginsburg PB| title=Rapidly evolving physician-payment policy — more than the SGR | journal=[[N Engl J Med]] | year= 2011 | volume= 364 | issue= 2 | pages= 172–6 | pmid=21142529 | doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr1004028 | url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMhpr1004028}}</ref> 

In a 2010 ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]'' publication written before the major health care reform legislation passed Congress—the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA)—Federman ''et al''. wrote:
{{quotation|Physician dissatisfaction with Medicare reimbursements and concerns about equity of reimbursements suggest that the role of the RUC in advising Medicare should be carefully evaluated.

Critics have pointed out that many RUC members may have significant conflicts of interest because of their financial relationships.<ref>[http://careandcost.com/2011/04/28/conflicts-of-interests-among-the-rucs-members/ Conflicts of Interests Among The RUC’s Members]</ref> 

The [[Independent Payment Advisory Board]] passed in the PPACA.
