'''Sir Prescott Gardner Hewett, 1st Baronet''', [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]] (3 July 1812 â€“ 19 June 1891) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[surgery|surgeon]], and the son of a [[Yorkshire]] country gentleman.

==Life==
Hewett lived for some years in early life in [[Paris]], and started on a career as an artist, but abandoned it for surgery. He entered [[St George's Hospital|Saint George's Hospital]], [[London]] (where his half-brother, Dr Cornwallis Hewett, was a physician from 1825 to 1833), becoming demonstrator of [[anatomy]] and curator of the museum. He was the pupil and intimate friend of [[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet|Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie]], and helped the latter in much of his work.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Eventually he rose to be anatomical lecturer, assistant-surgeon and surgeon to the hospital. In 1873 he was elected President of the [[Clinical Society of London]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.archive.org/stream/transactionscli21londgoog/transactionscli21londgoog_djvu.txt|title = Transactions of the Clinical Society of London Volume 18 1886]]|publisher= Clinical Society|accessdate = 2012-10-23}} archive.org</ref>  In 1876, he was president of the College of Surgeons, and in 1877, he was made serjeant-surgeon extraordinary to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], in 1884 serjeant-surgeon, and in 1883 he was created a [[baronet]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
In June 1874 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] <ref>{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=1&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27hewett%27%29 |title= Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher= Royal Society | accessdate = 18 November 2010}}</ref>

Hewett was a very good lecturer, but shrank from authorship; his lectures on ''Surgical Affections of the Head'' were, however, embodied in his treatise on the subject in [[Timothy Holmes|Holmes]]'s ''System of Surgery''. As a surgeon, he was always extremely conservative, but hesitated at no operation, no matter how severe, when convinced of its expediency. He was a perfect operator, and one of the most trustworthy of counsellors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Hewett died in 1891 and is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London. He had married on 13 September 1849 Sarah Elizabeth, daughter of Rev Joseph Cowell.
