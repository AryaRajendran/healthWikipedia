He is famous as the most eminent practical physician of his time in Germany and as the author of numerous works displaying extensive reading and a cultivated critical faculty.

==Biography==
Hufeland was born at [[Langensalza]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] (now [[Thuringia]]) and educated at [[Weimar]], where his father held the office of court physician to the grand duchess. In 1780 he entered the [[University of Jena]], and in the following year went on to [[university of Göttingen|Göttingen]], where in 1783 he graduated in [[medicine]]. 

After assisting his father for some years at Weimar, he was called in 1793 to the chair of medicine at Jena, receiving at the same time the positions of court physician and professor of [[Pathology]] at Weimar.  In 1798 [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] granted him the position director of the medical college and generally of state medical affairs at the [[Charité]], in [[Berlin]]. He filled the chair of [[pathology]] and therapeutics in the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], founded in 1809, and in 1810 became councillor of state. In 1823, he was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In time he became as famous as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Friedrich Schiller| Schiller]], and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] in his homeland.

Hufeland was the inventor of the term [[macrobiotic]], was Physician Royal to the King of [[Prussia]], as well as giving medical attention to the following illustrious patients: "[[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] (1749-1832), [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] (1744-1803), [[Schiller]] (1739-1805), and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] (1732-1813)."<ref>[http://macrobiotics.co.uk/macrocounselors.htm Macrobiotics UK]</ref> He was also a close friend of [[Samuel Hahnemann]] and published many of his original writings in his Journal. He also "joined the [[Illuminati]] order at this time, having been introduced to freemasonry in Göttingen in 1783."<ref>[http://www.manchester.edu/kant/Bio/FullBio/HufelandCWF.html Christoph Wilhelm Friedrich Hufeland (1762-1836)]</ref> He also seems to have professed an interest in [[China|Chinese]] [[Alchemy]] and methods of extending [[longevity]].<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1NllD8F_dfcC&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=hufeland+alchemy&source=bl&ots=PqMf8jXheF&sig=a6ro_2CRAAVABhpSnZgivji89t4&hl=en&ei=e_0kStGzF5WUjAelqYnlBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9 G J Gruman, ''A History of Ideas about Prolongation of Life,'' Springer Publishing, 2005, p.158]</ref>

The most widely known of his many writings is the treatise entitled ''[[Macrobiotic diet|Makrobiotik]] oder Die Kunst, das menschliche Leben zu verlängern'' (1796), which was translated into many languages, including in Serbian by Dr. Jovan Stejić in Vienna in 1828. Of his practical works, the ''System of Practical Medicine'' (''System der praktischen Heilkunde'', 1818-1828) is the most elaborate. From 1795 to 1835 he published a ''Journal der praktischen Arznei und Wundarzneikunde''. His [[autobiography]] was published in 1863.
