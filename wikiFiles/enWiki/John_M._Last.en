'''John Murray Last''', [[public health]] educator, is an [[Emeritus Professor]] at the [[University of Ottawa]].

== Education ==
Born in Australia in 1926, John Last obtained his [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB BS]] in 1949 and his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] (by thesis) in 1968, from the [[University of Adelaide]]. In the interim he undertook 5 years of hospital-based training, 5 years in general practice, and served as a [[ship's surgeon]]. In 1960 he obtained a [[DPH]] from the [[University of Sydney]], and was then appointed [[Visiting Fellow]], [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] Social Medicine Research Unit, [[London]], England (1961–62).  He earned specialty recognition in Australasia ([[Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians|FRACP]] 1973; [[FRACPHM]] 1990), the United States ([[American College of Preventive Medicine|FACPM]] 1980; [[American College of Epidemiology|FACE]] 1981), the United Kingdom ([[Faculty of Public Health|FFCM]] 1982), and Canada ([[FRCPC]] 1987).

== Career ==
Last has made major contributions to the advancement of methods for public health research and practice, and to clarifying related ethical issues. A prolific writer, he has held academic posts at the Universities of Sydney, [[University of Vermont|Vermont]], and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], and has been professor of [[epidemiology]] and community medicine at the University of Ottawa since 1969.
  
Perhaps his most enduring early contribution was a description of the “iceberg”: a common phenomenon where only a relatively small proportion of cases of a given disease, “the tip of the iceberg”, comes to the attention of the health care system. The “submerged part” goes undiagnosed and unreported. The proportion of missed cases varies with the disease and its severity.<ref>Last JM. The Iceberg: completing the clinical picture in general practice. Lancet. 1963;2:28–31.</ref>   

Last led the [[International Epidemiological Association]] initiative to develop guidelines on ethical conduct of epidemiological research, practice, and teaching (1987–93); he was a member of the Working Group of the [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences]] that drafted International Guidelines for Ethical Review of Epidemiological Studies (1991).

His greatest contribution is to the public health reference literature. He edited four editions of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (1980, 1986, 1991, 1998), eponymously known as "Maxcy-Rosenau-Last" and is editor-emeritus of the 15th edition in 2008.<ref>Maxcy-Rosenau-Last.
