The '''World Health Organization''' ('''WHO''') is a specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] (UN) that is concerned with international [[public health]]. It was established on 7 April 1948, with headquarters in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, and is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]]. Its predecessor, the [[League of Nations Health Organization|Health Organization]], was an agency of the [[League of Nations]].

The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries of the [[United Nations]] by 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finishing on 24 July 1948. It incorporated the ''Office International d'Hygiène Publique'' and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its creation, WHO has been responsible for playing a leading role in the [[eradication of smallpox]]. Its current priorities include [[communicable diseases]], in particular, [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]]; the mitigation of the effects of non-communicable diseases; sexual and reproductive health, development, and aging; nutrition, food security and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and drive the development of reporting, publications, and networking. WHO is responsible for the ''[[World Health Report]]'', a leading international publication on health,  the worldwide World Health Survey, and [[World Health Day]] (7th-April of every Year).

Its links with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and distribution of [[contraception]] have both proved controversial, as have guidelines on healthy eating and the [[2009 flu pandemic]].

===Establishment===
{{main|Establishment of the World Health Organization}}
The [[League of Nations Health Organization]] was established following the First World War inside the [[League of Nations]] framework. According to the League's Covenant, it was to "endeavour to take steps in matters of international concern for the prevention and control of disease, even in cases of dire human hardship".<ref>{{cite web |title=League of Nations Health Organization |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/health_org_1931.pdf |year=1931 |format=pdf |publisher=League of Nations Information Section, Geneva (digitised by WHO) |accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> Its efforts were hampered by the Second World War, during which [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] also played a role in international health initiatives.<ref name="bmj1948"/> During the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]], references to health had been incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] and it passed a declaration that an international health body would be set up.<ref name="shimkin">{{cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |jstor=1674843}}</ref>

===Operational history===
[[Image:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]
WHO established an epidemiological information service via [[telex]] in 1947, and by 1950 a mass [[tuberculosis]] inoculation drive (using the [[BCG vaccine]]) was under way. In 1955, the malaria eradication programme was launched, although it was later altered in objective. 1965 saw the first report on [[diabetes mellitus]] and the creation of the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]. WHO moved into its headquarters building in 1966. The [[Expanded Programme on Immunization]] was started in 1974, as was the control programme into [[onchocerciasis]] – an important partnership between the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and [[World Bank]]. In the following year, the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases was also launched. In 1976, the World Health Assembly voted to enact a resolution on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation, with a focus on community-driven care. The first list of [[essential medicines]] was drawn up in 1977, and a year later the ambitious goal of "health for all" was declared. In 1986, WHO started it global programme on the growing problem of [[HIV/AIDS]], followed two years later by additional attention on preventing discrimination against sufferers and [[UNAIDS]] was formed in 1996. The [[Poliomyelitis eradication|Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] was established in 1988.<ref name="at60">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf |title=WHO at 60 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>

In 1958, [[Viktor Zhdanov]], Deputy Minister of Health for the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], called on the [[World Health Assembly]] to undertake a global initiative to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54.<ref name= Fenner2>{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank|title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva|year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf|pages=366–418 |isbn=92-4-156110-6 }}</ref> At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year. In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4 million annually to the effort and adopted a new [[disease surveillance]] method.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf |title=Karel Raška and Smallpox |format=PDF |publisher=Central European Journal of Public Health |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf |title=Karel Raška — The Development of Modern Epidemiology.

In 1998, WHO's Director General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, raised life expectancy and reduced rates of "scourges" such as smallpox and [[polio]] on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. He, did, however, accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and that progress in this area had been slow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHD_98.1-13.pdf |title=World Health Day: Safe Motherhood |date=7 April 1998 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> [[Cholera]] and [[malaria]] have remained problems since WHO's founding, although in decline for a large part of that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medical-colleges.net/worldhealth.htm |title=World Health Organization |publisher=Medical Schools and Nursing Colleges |year=2003 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> In the twenty-first century, the [[Stop TB Partnership]] was created in 2000, along with the UN's formulation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

In 2002, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] was drawn up to improve the resources available.<ref name="at60"/> In 2006, the organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for a global prevention, treatment and support plan to fight the [[AIDS pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/04/content_5167991.htm |title=Zimbabwe launches world's 1st AIDS training package |publisher=chinaview.cn |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}</ref>

==Current projects==

===Overall focus===
The WHO's constitution states that its objective "is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the World Health Organization |accessdate=11 February 2008}}</ref>

WHO identifies its role as one of six main objectives:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/role/en/index.html |title=The role of WHO in public health |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>
* providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping the research agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge;
* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options;
* providing technical support, catalyzing change, and building sustainable institutional capacity; and
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.

The 2012–2013 budget further identified thirteen areas among which funding was distributed.<ref name="20123budget">{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>

===Communicable diseases===
Two of those thirteen areas related to [[communicable diseases]]: the first, to reduce the "health, social and economic burden" of communicable diseases in general; the second to combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] in particular.<ref name="20123budget"/>

In terms of HIV/AIDS, WHO works within the [[UNAIDS]] network and considers it important that it works in alignment with UNAIDS objectives and strategies. It also strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of the disease.<ref>{{cite document |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |publisher=WHO  |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |year=2011 |page=5}}</ref> In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task  between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.<ref>{{cite document |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |publisher=WHO |year=2011 |page=7}}</ref>

Although WHO dropped its commitment to a  global malaria eradication campaign in the 1970s as too ambitious, it retains a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. WHO is to report, likely in 2015, as to whether [[RTS,S|RTS,S/AS01]], currently in research, is a viable [[malaria vaccine]]. For the time being, [[insecticide]]-treated [[mosquito nets]] and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are [[antimalarial drugs]] – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html |title=Malaria Fact Sheet |publisher=WHO |work=WHO Media Centre |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>

WHO's help has contributed to a 40% fall in the number of deaths from [[tuberculosis]] between 1990 and 2010, and since 2005, it claims that over 46 million people have been treated and an estimated 7 million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and impact of tuberculosis and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognised the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html |title=Tuberculosis Fact Sheet |publisher=WHO |work=WHO Media Centre |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>

WHO aims to eradicate [[polio]]. It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988, which partnered WHO with [[Rotary International]], the [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and the [[United Nations Children’s Fund]] (UNICEF), as well as smaller organizations. It works to immunize young children and prevent the re-emergence of cases in countries declared "polio-free".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/ |title=Poliomyelitis Fact Sheet |publisher=WHO |work=WHO Media Centre |date=October 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}</ref>

===Non-communicable diseases===
Another of the thirteen areas is aimed at the prevention and reduction of "disease, disability and premature from chronic [[noncommunicable disease]]s, [[mental disorder]]s, [[violence]] and [[injury prevention|injuries]] and [[visual impairment]]".<ref name="20123budget"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/en/ |title=WHO Violence and Injury Prevention |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>

===Life and lifestyle===
WHO also works to "reduce [[morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]] and improve health during key stages of life, including [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], the [[Infant|neonatal period]], [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]], and improve [[Sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]] and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals".<ref name="20123budget"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |title=Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>

It also tries to prevent or reduce risk factors for"health conditions associated with use of [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], [[drugs]] and other psychoactive substances, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and [[unsafe sex]]".<ref name="20123budget"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/tobacco/en/ |title=Tobacco |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/en/ |title=Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health |publisher=WHO}}</ref>

WHO works  to improve [[nutrition]], [[food safety]] and [[food security]] and to ensure this has a positive effect on [[public health]] and [[sustainable development]].<ref name="20123budget"/>

===Emergency work===
When any sort of disaster or emergency occurs, it is WHO's stated objective to reduce any consequences it may have on world health and its social and economic implications.<ref name="20123budget"/>

===Health policy===
WHO also addresses government health policy with two aims: firstly, "to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, genderresponsive, and human rights-based approaches" and secondly "to promote a healthier environment, intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health".<ref name="20123budget"/>

In terms of health services, WHO looks to improve "governance, financing, staffing and management" and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy making. It also strives to "ensure improved access, quality and use of medical products and technologies".<ref name="20123budget"/>

===Governance and support===
The remaining two of WHO's thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself: firstly, "to provide leadership, strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries, the [[United Nations]] system, and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda" and secondly "to develop and sustain WHO as a flexible, learning organization, enabling it to carry out its mandate more efficiently and effectively".<ref name="20123budget"/>

===Other work===
The WHO and the [[World Bank]] constitute the core team responsible for administering the  [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+). The IHP+ is a group of partner governments, development agencies, civil society and others committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. Partners work together to put international principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development cooperation into practice in the health sector.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/ |title=International Health Partnership |publisher=IHP+ |accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref>

In addition, the WHO has also promoted road safety.<ref>WHO. [http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/ Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020]</ref> Each year, the organization marks [[World Health Day]] focusing on a specific [[health promotion]] topic, timed to match the anniversary of WHO's founding.

WHO Member States appoint delegations to the [[World Health Assembly]], WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN Member States are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO web site, "other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly".<ref name="countries"/>

In addition, the UN observer organizations [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] have entered into "official relations" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the [[World Health Assembly]] they are seated along the other NGOs.<ref name="observerWHO"/>

===Assembly and Executive Board===
[[File:World Health Organisation building south face 2.jpg|thumb|WHO Headquarters in Geneva]]
The World Health Assembly is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints the Director-General every five years, and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in the field of health, to the Executive Board for three-year terms. The main functions of the Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and to facilitate its work.<ref name="governance">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/index.html |title=Governance |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>

]]

The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHA to "establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area". Many decisions are made at regional level, including importance discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.<ref name="burci53">Burci, Vignes (2004). pp. 53–57.</ref>

Each region has a Regional Committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not fully recognised. For example, [[Palestine]] attends meetings of the [[Eastern Mediterranean Regional office of World Health Organization|Eastern Mediterranean Regional office]]. Each region also has a regional office.<ref name="burci53"/> Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The Board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never overruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small.<ref name="burci53"/> Since 1999, Regional Directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |title=A year of change: Reports of the Executive Board on its 102nd and 103rd sessions |accessdate=11 February 2012}}</ref>

Each Regional Committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]]. The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.

The Regional Director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her Region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centers. The RD is also the direct supervising authority—concomitantly with the WHO Director-General—of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the Region.

The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). {{As of|2010}}, the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] ("Libya"); all other staff were international. Those in the Region for the Americas, they are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives.

The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff.<ref name="peopleandoffices"/> The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/where-we-work/member-states/hungary/who-country-office |title=WHO Country Office (Hungary) |publisher=WHO EURO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>

===Financing and partnerships===
The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. {{As of|2012}}, the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110&nbsp;million), Japan ($58&nbsp;million), Germany ($37&nbsp;million), United Kingdom ($31&nbsp;million) and France ($31&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf |title=Assessed Contributions payable by Member States and Associate Members – 2012–2013 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> The combined 2012–2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3,959&nbsp;million, of which $944&nbsp;million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for $3,015&nbsp;million (76%), of which $800&nbsp;million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012 |pages=10, 15–16}}</ref>

==Controversies==

=== IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 ===
[[File:Devant OMS 5.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Demonstration on [[Chernobyl disaster]] day near WHO in [[Geneva]]]]
In 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). The agreement states that the WHO recognises the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health. However, the following paragraph adds: "whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement".<ref>{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Agreements with Other Intergovernmental Organizations|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/agreements-with-other-inter-en.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> The nature of this statement has led some pressure groups and activists (including [[Women in Europe for a Common Future]]) to believe that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the [[Acute radiation syndrome|effects on human health of radiation]] caused by the use of [[nuclear power]] and the continuing effects of [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents|nuclear disasters]] in [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]].

===Roman Catholic Church and AIDS===
{{Main|Roman Catholic Church and AIDS}}
In 2003, the WHO denounced the [[Roman Curia]]'s health department's opposition to the use of [[condom]]s, saying: "These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20&nbsp;million people, and currently affects at least 42&nbsp;million."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/oct/09/aids |title=Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids |publisher=The Guardian |date=9 October 2003}}</ref> {{As of|2009}}, the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids |title=Pope claims condoms could make African Aids crisis worse |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> At the time, the World Health Assembly President, [[Guyana]]'s Health Minister [[Leslie Ramsammy]], condemned [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict's]] opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to "create confusion" and "impede" proven strategies in the battle against the disease.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsk4RI5cPLSsvXTY9ZEyWSMrVElg |title=World Health Assembly: Pope Benedict "wrong" |work=Google News|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>

===Intermittent preventive therapy===
The aggressive support of the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] for [[intermittent preventive therapy]] of [[malaria]] which included the commissioning of a report from the [[Institute of Medicine]] triggered a memo from the former WHO malaria chief Akira Kochi.<ref>{{cite web|last=McNeil |first=Donald G. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html |title=Gates Foundation’s Influence Criticized |work=The New York Times |date=16 February 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>

===Diet and sugar intake===
Some of the research undertaken or supported by WHO to determine how people's lifestyles and environments are influencing whether they live in better or worse health can be controversial, as illustrated by a 2003 joint WHO/FAO report on nutrition and the prevention of chronic [[non-communicable disease]],<ref>Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation. ''Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases''. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series 916).</ref> which recommended that sugar should form no more than 10% of a [[healthy diet]]. This report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report the statement "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial", but also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf |format=pdf |title=Sugar revisited – again |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |year=2003 |volume=81 |number=8}}</ref>

===2009 influenza pandemic===
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic}}
In 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic [[influenza vaccine]] development through [[clinical trial]]s in collaboration with many experts. A pandemic involving the [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|H1N1 influenza virus]] was declared by Director-General [[Margaret Chan]] in April 2009.

By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading "fear and confusion" rather than "immediate information".<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36421914/ ''WHO admits errors in handling flu pandemic: Agency accused of overplaying danger of the virus as it swept the globe.''] Posted by msnbc.com</ref> Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to "unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken in during the last decade".<ref>Abelina A et al. [http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf "Lessons from pandemic influenza A(H1N1): The research-based vaccine industry’s perspective."] ''Vaccine'' 29 (2011) 1135–1138.</ref>
