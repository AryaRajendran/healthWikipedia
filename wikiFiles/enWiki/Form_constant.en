A '''form constant''' is one of several [[Pattern|geometric pattern]]s which are recurringly observed during [[hallucination]]s and [[altered states of consciousness]].

==History==
In [[1926 in science|1926]], [[Heinrich Klüver]] systematically studied the effects of [[mescaline]] ([[peyote]]) on the [[subjective experience]]s of its users. In addition to producing hallucinations characterized by bright, "highly [[Saturation (color theory)|saturated]]" colors and vivid imagery, Klüver noticed that mescaline produced recurring [[geometric pattern]]s in different users. He called these patterns 'form constants' and categorized four types: [[lattice (group)|lattices]] (including [[Hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]]s, [[checkerboard]]s, and [[triangle]]s), [[Spider web|cobweb]]s, tunnels, and [[spiral]]s.<ref name="Bressloff2002">{{cite journal

In 1988 [[David Lewis-Williams]] and T.A. Dowson incorporated the form constant into their Three Stages of Trance model, the geometric shapes comprising the visuals observed in the model's first stage.

==Precipitants==

Klüver's form constants have appeared in other drug-induced and naturally-occurring hallucinations, suggesting a similar physiological process underlying hallucinations with different triggers. Klüver's form constants also appear in [[near-death experience]]s and sensory experiences of those with [[synesthesia]]. Other triggers include [[psychological stress]], [[hypnagogia |threshold consciousness (hypnagogia)]], [[insulin hypoglycemia]], the delirium of [[fever]], [[epilepsy]], [[psychosis|psychotic episodes]], advanced [[syphilis]], [[sensory deprivation]], [[photostimulation]], [[electrical stimulation]], [[crystal gazing]], migraine headaches, [[dizziness]] and a variety of [[drug]]-induced [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]]s.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} These shapes may appear on their own or with eyes shut in the form of [[phosphene]]s, especially when exerting pressure against the closed eyelid.

It is believed that the reason why these form constants appear has to do with the way the visual system is organized, and in particular in the mapping between patterns on the retina and the columnar organization of primary visual cortex. Concentric circles in the retina are mapped into parallel lines in visual cortex. Spirals, tunnels, lattices and cobwebs map into lines in different directions. This means that if activation spreads in straight lines within the visual cortex, the experience is equivalent to looking at actual form constants.<ref name="Bressloff2002" />

Author [[Michael Moorcock]] once observed in print that the shapes he had seen during his [[migraine headache]]s resembled exactly the form of [[fractal]]s. The diversity of conditions that provoke such patterns suggests that form constants reflect some fundamental property of [[visual perception]].

==Cultural significance==
The practice of the ancient art of [[divination]] may suggest a deliberate practice of cultivating form constant imagery and using [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and/or imagination to derive some meaning from transient visual phenomena.

[[Psychedelic art]], inspired at least in part by psychedelic substances, frequently includes repetitive abstract forms and patterns such as [[tessellation]], [[Moiré pattern]]s or patterns similar to those created by [[paper marbling]], and, in later years, [[fractal]]s. The [[op art]] genre of visual art created art using bold imagery very like that of form constants.
