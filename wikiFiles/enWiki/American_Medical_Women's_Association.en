The '''American Medical Women's Association''' (AMWA) is a professional advocacy and educational organization of women [[physician]]s and medical students. Founded in 1915 by [[Bertha VanHoosen]], the AMWA works to advance women in medicine and to serve as a voice for women's health. The association used to publish the ''Journal of the American Medical Women's Association''; the ''[[Journal of Women's Health]]'' is now the official journal of the AMWA.

==Honors==
The AMWA honors women physicians each year with four awards.
*The Elizabeth Blackwell Medal, named for [[Elizabeth Blackwell]], the first woman awarded an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from an American [[medical school]], is granted to "a woman physician who has made the most outstanding contributions to the cause of women in the field of medicine."
*The [[Bertha VanHoosen]] Award, named in honor of the Founder and first President of AMWA, honors "a woman physician who has demonstrated exceptional leadership and service to AMWA."
*The Lila A. Wallis Award, named for one of AMWA’s Past Presidents, is given to an individual whose lifetime achievements and values reflect those of Dr. Wallis.
*The Woman in Science Award is given to a woman physician who "has made exceptional contributions to medical science, especially in women’s health."

The AMWA also established [[The International Women in Medicine Hall of Fame]] to recognize contributions made by women in the medical profession.  The more than two dozen inductees include the first woman physician, [[Elizabeth Blackwell]]; and two former Surgeon Generals of the United States [[Antonia Novello]] and [[Joycelyn Elders]].  In 2010, the inductees were [[Linda A. Randolph]], president and CEO of the Developing Families Center, an innovative model for healthcare delivery to poor families; and [[Diana Zuckerman]], a health policy expert who is president of the National Research Center for Women & Families.  The latter is the first non-physician inducted.

==Publications==
The AMWA has published a number of books, primarily in the field of women's health.
