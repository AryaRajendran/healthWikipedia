Leishmaniasis is a [[disease]] caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s of the ''[[Leishmania]]'' genus. This disease is the second-largest parasitic killer in the world (after [[malaria]]), responsible for an estimated 500,000 infections each year worldwide.<ref name="Desjeux2001">{{cite journal | author = Desjeux P. | date =  | year = 2001 | month =  | title = The increase of risk factors for leishmaniasis worldwide | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–43 | doi = 10.1016/S0035-9203(01)90223-8 |  pmid = 11490989 }}</ref> The parasite migrates to the internal organs such as [[liver]], [[spleen]] (hence '[[Viscus|''visceral'']]'), and [[bone marrow]], and, if left untreated, will almost always result in the death of the host. Signs and symptoms include [[fever]], [[Cachexia|weight loss]], [[mucosal ulcers]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[anemia]], and substantial swelling of the liver and spleen. Of particular concern, according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), is the emerging problem of [[HIV]]/VL co-infection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/hiv_coinfection/burden_hiv_coinfection/en/index.html |title= Leishmaniasis and HIV co-infection |work=WHO |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Species that give rise to VL==
Two species of ''Leishmania'' are known to give rise to the visceral form of the disease. The  species commonly found in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent is ''[[Leishmania donovani|L. donovani]]'' and the species found in Europe, North Africa, and Latin America is ''[[Leishmania infantum|L. infantum]]'', also known as ''L. chagasi''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Chappuis F. ''et al.'' | year = | title = Visceral leishmaniasis: what are the needs for diagnosis, treatment and control? | url = http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/documents/VL_NMR_1107_ok.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 873 }}</ref>

==Life-cycle of the parasite==
Visceral leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) is spread through an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], the [[Phlebotominae|sandfly]] of the ''Phlebotomus'' [[genus]] in the Old World and the ''Lutzomyia'' genus in the New World. Sandflies are tiny creatures, 3–6 millimeters long by 1.5–3 millimeters in diameter, and are found in tropical or temperate regions throughout the world. Sandfly larvae grow in warm, moist organic matter (such as old trees, house walls, or waste) making them hard to eradicate.

The adult female sand fly is a bloodsucker, usually feeding at night on sleeping prey. When the fly bites an animal infected with ''L. donovani'', the pathogen is ingested along with the prey's blood. At this point the [[protozoan]] is in the smaller of its two forms, called an [[amastigote]]—round, non-motile, and only three to seven micrometers in diameter.

Taken into the stomach of the sandfly, the ''amastigotes'' quickly transform into a second ''L. donovani'' form, called the ''[[promastigote]]''. This form is spindle-shaped, triple the size of the amastigote, and has a single [[flagellum]] that allows for mobility. The promastigotes live extracellularly in the sandfly's alimentary canal, reproducing asexually, then migrate to the proximal end of the gut where they become poised for a regurgitational transmission. This is their means of transmission back into a mammalian host, as the fly injects its saliva into prey when it bites. The promastigotes are introduced locally at the bite site along with the fly’s saliva. 

Once inside the new host, promastigotes invade [[macrophages]]. Once inside, they transform back into the smaller amastigote form. As an amastigote, ''L. donovani'' can only reproduce intracellularly—and the amastigotes replicate in the most hostile part of the macrophage cell, inside the [[phagolysosome]], whose normal defensive response they are able to prevent. After they have reproduced to a certain extent, the ''L. donovani'' [[lysis|lyse]] their host cell by sheer pressure of mass, but there is some recent speculation that they are able to leave the cell by triggering the [[exocytosis]] response of the macrophage. The daughter cell protozoans then migrate through the bloodstream to find new macrophage hosts. In time, ''L. donovani'' becomes a systemic infection, spreading to all the host's organs, particularly the spleen and liver.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Disease progression==
In human hosts, response to infection by ''L. donovani'' varies a great deal, not only by the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral leishmaniasis show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having visceral leishmaniasis have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity.<ref name=carvalho>{{cite journal | author = Carvalho E, Badaro R, Reed S, Jones T, Johnson W | year = 1985 | title = Absence of Gamma Interferon and Interleukin 2 Production During Active Visceral Leishmaniasis | url = | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 76 | issue = 6| pages = 2066–2069 | pmid = 3935667 | doi=10.1172/JCI112209 | pmc=424308}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 8421174 | volume=167 | issue=2 | title=Correlates of Leishmania-specific immunity in the clinical spectrum of infection with Leishmania chagasi | year=1993 | month=February | author=Holaday BJ, Pompeu MM, Evans T, ''et al.'' | journal=J.

When a human patient does develop visceral leishmaniasis, the most typical symptoms are [[fever]] and the enlargement of the spleen, or [[splenomegaly]], with enlargement of the liver—[[hepatomegaly]]—sometimes being seen as well. The blackening of the skin that gave the disease its common name in India does not appear in most strains of the disease, and the other symptoms are very easy to mistake for those of [[malaria]]. Misdiagnosis is dangerous, as without proper treatment the mortality rate for kala-azar is close to 100%. ''L. donovani'' itself is not usually the direct cause of death in kala-azar sufferers, however. [[Pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[dysentery]] are omnipresent in the depressed regions where leishmaniasis thrives, and, as with [[AIDS]], it is these [[opportunistic infection]]s that are more likely to kill, flaring up in a host whose immune system has been weakened by the ''L. donovani'' infection. Progress of the disease is extremely variable, taking anywhere from one to twenty weeks, but a typical duration for the Sudanese strain of the disease is narrower, between twelve and sixteen weeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Even with recovery, kala-azar does not always leave its hosts unmarked. Some time after successful treatment—generally a few months with African kala-azar, or as much as several years with the Indian strain—a secondary form of the disease may set in, called [[post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis]], or PKDL. This condition manifests first as small, measle-like skin lesions on the face, which gradually increase in size and spread over the body. Eventually the lesions may coalesce to form disfiguring, swollen structures resembling [[leprosy]], and occasionally causing blindness if they spread to the eyes. (This disease is not the same as [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]], a milder disease caused by another protozoan of the Leishmania genus which also causes skin lesions.){{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Diagnosis==
The gold standard for diagnosis is visualization of the [[amastigotes]] in [[splenic aspirate]] or [[Bone marrow aspiration|bone marrow aspirate]]. This is a technically challenging procedure that is frequently unavailable in areas of the world where visceral leishmaniasis is endemic.

[[Serology|Serological]] testing is much more frequently used in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic. The '''K39''' dipstick test is easy to perform, and village health workers can be easily trained to use it. The kit may be stored at ambient temperature and no additional equipment needs to be carried to remote areas. The [[Direct agglutination test|DAT]] anti-leishmania antigen test is standard within [[Médecins Sans Frontières|MSF]] is much more cumbersome to use and appears not to have any advantages over the K39 test.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chappuis F, Rijal S, Soto A, Menten J, Boelaert M | title=A meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of the direct agglutination test and rK39 dipstick for visceral leishmaniasis | journal=Brit Med J | volume=333 | issue=7571 | pages=723–6 | doi=10.1136/bmj.38917.503056.7C | year=2006 | pmid=16882683 | pmc=1592383 }}</ref>

There are a number of problems with serological testing: in highly endemic areas, not everyone who becomes infected will actually develop clinical disease or require treatment. Indeed, up to 32% of the healthy population may test positive, but not require treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sundar S, Singh RK, Maurya R, ''et al.'' |title=Serological diagnosis of Indian visceral leishmaniasis: direct agglutination test versus rK39 strip test |journal=Trans.

==Treatments==
As with many diseases in developing nations, (including [[trypanosomiasis]] and [[malaria]]) effective and affordable [[chemotherapy]] is sorely lacking and parasites or insect vectors are becoming increasingly resistant to existing anti-parasite drugs. Possibly due to the lack of financial return, new drugs are slow to emerge and much of the basic research into potential drug targets takes place in universities, funded by charitable organizations. This may change as a result of infection of members of the armed forces from the developed nations that currently occupy nations such as [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], where ''Leishmania'' is commonplace.

The traditional treatment is with [[pentavalent antimonial]]s such as [[sodium stibogluconate]] and [[meglumine antimoniate]]. Resistance is now common in India, and rates of resistance have been shown to be as high as 60% in parts of Bihar, India.<ref name="Sundar2000">{{cite journal |author=Sundar S, More DK, Singh MK, ''et al.'' |title=Failure of pentavalent antimony in visceral leishmaniasis in India: report from the center of the Indian epidemic |journal=Clin.

A low dose (0.5&ndash;1&nbsp;mg/kg) is given on the first day, increasing to 1&ndash;2&nbsp;mg/kg on the second day, followed by 1.5&ndash;3&nbsp;mg/kg on the third and subsequent days.

[[Miltefosine]] Impavido is the first oral treatment for this disease. The cure rate of miltefosine in Phase III clinical trials is 95%; Studies in Ethiopia show that is also effective in Africa. In HIV immunosuppressed people which are coinfected with leishmaniasis it has shown that even in resistant cases 2/3 of the people responded to this new treatment.
Miltefosine has received approval by the Indian regulatory authorities in 2002 and in Germany in 2004.It is now registered in many countries.

The drug is generally better tolerated than other drugs. Main side effects are gastrointetinal disturbance in the first or second day of treatment (a course of treatment is 28 days) which does not affect the efficiency. Because it is available as an oral formulation, the expense and inconvenience of hospitalization is avoided, and outpatient distribution of the drug becomes an option, making Miltefosine a drug of choice.

The nonprofit [[Institute for OneWorld Health]] has adopted the broad spectrum antibiotic [[paromomycin]] for use in treating VL; its antileishmanial properties were first identified in the 1980s.  A treatment with paromomycin costs about $15 USD. The drug had originally been identified in the 1960s.<ref name="nytimes.com">[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/health/31charity.html A Small Charity Takes the Reins in Fighting a Neglected Disease], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 31, 2006.</ref> The Indian government approved paromomycin for sale and use in August 2006.<ref>[http://www.oneworldhealth.org/media/details.php?prID=154 NEW CURE FOR DEADLY VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS (KALA-AZAR) APPROVED BY GOVERNMENT OF INDIA], ''[[Institute for OneWorld Health Press Release]]'', Sept 8, 2006.</ref>

In 2009, the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] Kuvin Center for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, in a collaborative effort with [[Addis Ababa University]], was awarded a grant by the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] for research into visceral leishmaniasis in [[Ethiopia]]. The project will gather data to be analyzed to identify the weak links in the transmission cycle and devise methods for control of the disease.<ref>[http://www.israel21c.org/briefs/5-m-for-disease-control-in-ethiopia $5m for disease control in Ethiopia] in [http://www.israel21c.org/ Israel 21c Innovation News Service] Retrieved 2009-12-30</ref>

Combination drug therapies are currently under investigation, particularly by the [[Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative]] (DNDi).  Combination therapies allow for the use of existing drugs in combination, each in lower doses, which helps to decrease the incidence of severe side effects and drug toxicity, as well as the risk for development of resistance against the drugs; they have been shown to be cost-effective strategies strategies.<ref name="Olliaro2009">{{cite journal |author=Olliaro, P., Darley, S., Laxminarayan, R., ''et al.'' |title=Cost-effectiveness projections of single and combination therapies for visceral leishmaniasis in Bihar, India |journal=Trop Med Int Health |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=918–925 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02306.x |pmid=19563434}}</ref>

==Prevention==
There is no vaccine for this disease as of 2012.  

On February 2012, the nonprofit [[Infectious Disease Research Institute]] launched the world’s first [[clinical trial]] of the visceral leishmaniasis vaccine.  The vaccine is a recombinant form of two fused Leishmania parasite proteins with an [[adjuvant]].  Two phase 1 clinical trials with healthy volunteers are to be conducted.  The first one takes place in [[Washington (state)]] and is followed by a trial in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/worlds-first-kala-azar-vaccine-enters-clinic/2012-02-23|title=World’s first kala azar vaccine enters the clinic|author=Elvidge, Suzanne|publisher=FierceVaccines.com|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}</ref>

The use of lipid complexed amphotericin b to treat visceral leishmaniasis was pioneered by Henry Murray, MD, who recognized that infected macrophages would engulf the lipid complexes, liberating amphotericin at the point of infection while minimizing untoward systemic side effects, e.g. renal distal tubule damage. Doctor Murray's work resulted in a paradigm shift in the treatment of and control of this parasitic disease in India.

Kala-azar first came to the attention of Western doctors in 1824 in [[Jessore]], India (now [[Bangladesh]]), where it was initially thought to be a form of [[malaria]]. [[Assam]] gave kala-azar one of its common names, ''Assam fever''.<ref name="Medical Encyclopedia">{{cite web | author = "Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. © 2009, Elsevier." | url = http://www.medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/kala-azar | title = kala-azar | accessdate = 2010-01-21 }}</ref> Another common name, ''kala-azar'' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]: काला आज़ार <small>([[Devanagari]])</small> کالا آزار <small>([[Nastaleeq]])</small> {{Unicode|''kālā āzār''}}), is derived from ''kala'' which means black in [[Sanskrit]], as well is the [[Indo-Aryan languages|languages descended]] from it, including [[Assamese language|Assamese]],<ref name="Collins English Dictionary" /> [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]];<ref name="MWKA">{{cite web | author = Merriam-Webster's online dictionary | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kala-azar | title = kala-azar | accessdate = 2010-01-21 }}</ref> the word ''azar'' means disease in Persian and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]];<ref name="Collins English Dictionary">{{cite web | author = "HarperCollins Publishers, 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003." | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/kala-azar | title = kala-azar | accessdate = 2010-01-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Framework for Industrialization in Africa|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I7JNoIcUycQC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=hindustani+azar+fever&source=bl&ots=IfP4OtY9Gs&sig=cS_tTS94M64NnGnax0UjP_8YKnw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GOYEUKqfGJPwrAGK_a3jCA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hindustani%20azar%20fever&f=false|author=Thomas A. Taku|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=77|quote=Locally, the disease was called kala-azar or black fever, which is the meaning in the Hindustani language.}}</ref> as such the disease is named for the darkening of the skin on the extremities and abdomen that is a symptom of the Indian form of the disease. The agent of the disease was also first isolated in India by Scottish doctor [[William Leishman]] and Irish physician [[Charles Donovan]], working independently of each other. As they published their discovery almost simultaneously, the species was named for both of them—''Leishmania donovani''.
 
Today, the name kala-azar is used interchangeably with the scientific name visceral leishmaniasis for the most acute form of the disease caused by ''L. donovani''. The disease is endemic in [[West Bengal]], where it was first discovered, but is seen at its most deadly in north and east Africa. It can also be found throughout the [[Arab]] world and southern Europe (where the causative organism is ''L. infantum''), and a slightly different strain of the pathogen, ''L. chagasi'', is responsible for leishmaniasis in the new world. Several species of [[Canidae|canines]] serve as reservoir hosts of ''L. infantum (chagasi)''.

But, while the disease's geographical range is broad, it is not continuous. The disease clusters around areas of drought, famine, and high population density. In Africa, this has meant a knot of infection centers mostly in [[Sudan]], [[Kenya]], and [[Somalia]]. Living conditions here have changed very little in the past century, and the people are not normally very mobile. Parts of the Sudan, in particular the [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]] region, are almost totally cut off from the rest of the country, and the people are as tied to the place of their birth as any peasant of Europe’s Dark Ages.<ref name="Jean1995">{{cite journal | author= Jean, Francois  | year=1995 | journal= Life, Death and Aid: the Médecins Sans Frontières Report on World Crisis Intervention | title= Sudan: Speak no Evil, Do no Good}}</ref>

Contemporary life has made itself felt even here, however—not as "progress" but in the form of the many small wars of Africa's post-colonial era. In the [[Sudan]], where civil war has been continuous since 1983, the violence has been concentrated in the more populated south, and kala-azar was concentrated there too. But the wars have driven a steady stream of [[refugees]] out of the region, and these traveled either across the southern border or into the remoter western part of the country called the Upper Nile, where both war and the disease that went with it had not yet penetrated.<ref name="Jean1995"/>

These refugees, moving at foot-speed, carried the disease with them, and when it arrived it hit the Upper Nile with a force comparable to [[smallpox]] hitting the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. The isolated people of the Upper Nile had no access to medicine or education about the new disease among them. Worse, their [[immune system]]s were defenseless against this new pathogen, foreign to them though it came only from another part of their own country. One village at the center of the epidemic, [[Duar]], was left with four survivors out of a population of a thousand, and from the late eighties to the mid-nineties a total of 100,000 succumbed to the sickness in that region alone. In the words of [[Jill Seaman]], the doctor who led relief efforts in the Upper Nile for the French organization [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], "Where else in the world could 50% of a population die without anyone knowing?"<ref name="Dowell1997">{{cite journal | author= Dowell, William  | year=1997 | journal=Time| title= Rescue in Sudan}}</ref>

North [[Bihar]], India (including [[Araria]], [[Purnea]], and [[Kishanganj]]) is the endemic zone of this disease.
