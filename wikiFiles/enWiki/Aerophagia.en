'''Aerophagia''' (var. '''aerophagy''') is a condition that occurs when a person swallows too much air, which goes to the [[stomach]]. It causes abdominal [[bloating]] and frequent [[belching]] and may cause [[pain]].

==Causes==
Aerophagia is associated with [[chewing gum]], [[smoking]], drinking [[carbonated drinks]], eating too fast, [[Positive airway pressure|CPAP]] air pressure (if it is too high) and wearing loose [[dentures]]. In people with cervical spinal blockages, inhaling can cause air to enter the esophagus and stomach.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krasiuk MM, Kratinov VP|title=The characteristics of aerophagy and its treatment |journal=[[Likars'ka sprava]] |volume=7 |pages=114–6

Aerophagia is a dangerous side effect of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), commonly used in treatments of respiratory problems and cardiovascular critical care or in surgery when a general anaesthetic is required. In the case of aerophagia during NIV, it is normally diagnosed by experienced medical specialists who check on patients intermittently during NIV use. The diagnosis is based on the sound heard by listening through a [[stethoscope]] placed outside the abdominal cavity. Using this approach, the problem is sometimes detected later than when it develops, possibly also later than necessary. Belated detection of aerophagia may lead to gastric distension, which in turn could inflate the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] or cause aspiration of the stomach contents into the lungs<ref name="pmid14494855">{{cite journal |author=RUBEN H, KNUDSEN EJ, CARUGATI G |title=Gastric inflation in relation to airway pressure |journal=Acta Anaesthesiol Scand |volume=5 |issue= 3|pages=107–14 |year=1961 |pmid=14494855 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.1961.tb00089.x}}</ref> or pneumatic rupture of the [[oesophagus]] due to extreme gastric insufflation.<ref name="pmid3186323">{{cite journal |author=Meyerovitch J, Ben Ami T, Rozenman J, Barzilay Z |title=Pneumatic rupture of the esophagus caused by carbonated drinks |journal=Pediatr Radiol |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=468–70 |year=1988 |pmid=3186323 |doi=10.1007/BF00974081}}</ref>

Aerophagia may also refer to an unusual condition where the primary symptom is excessive flatus, belching is not present, and the actual mechanism by which air enters the gut is obscure.<ref name="pmid9820415">{{cite journal |author= Levitt MD, Furne J, Aeolus MR, Suarez FL |title=Evaluation of an extremely flatulent patient: case report and proposed diagnostic and therapeutic approach |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |volume=93 |issue=11 |pages=2276–81 |year=1998 |pmid=9820415 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.00635.x}}</ref>
