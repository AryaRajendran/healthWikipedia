In [[human anatomy]], '''superior epigastric artery''' refers to a [[blood vessel]] that carries oxygenated [[blood]] and arises from the [[internal thoracic artery]] (referred to as the internal mammary artery in the accompanying diagram).  It [[anastomoses]] with the [[inferior epigastric artery]] at the [[Navel|umbilicus]] and supplies the anterior part of the [[abdominal wall]] and some of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]].  

Along its course, it is accompanied by a similarly named vein, the [[superior epigastric vein]].

==Collateralization in vascular disease and aortic coarctation==
The superior epigastric arteries, [[inferior epigastric artery|inferior epigastric arteries]], [[internal thoracic artery|internal thoracic arteries]] and left [[subclavian artery]] and right subclavian artery / [[Brachiocephalic artery|brachiocephalic]] are [[collateral vessel]]s to the [[thoracic aorta]] and [[abdominal aorta]].  

If the abdominal aorta develops a significant [[stenosis]] and/or blockage (as may be caused by [[atherosclerosis]]), this collateral pathway may develop sufficiently, over time, to supply blood to the [[lower limb]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yurdakul M, Tola M, Ozdemir E, Bayazit M, Cumhur T |title=Internal thoracic artery-inferior epigastric artery as a collateral pathway in aortoiliac occlusive disease |journal=J. Vasc. Surg. |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=707–13 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16616225 |doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2005.12.042 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0741-5214(05)02138-5}}</ref>  

A congenitally narrowed aorta, due to coarctation, is often associated with a significant enlargement of the internal thoracic and epigastric arteries.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Huhmann W, Kunitsch G, Dalichau H | title = [Coarctation of the aorta on the plain chest x-ray (author's transl)] | journal = Dtsch Med Wochenschr | volume = 101 | issue = 41 | pages = 1477–81 | year = 1976 | pmid = 964150 | doi = 10.1055/s-0028-1104294}}</ref>
