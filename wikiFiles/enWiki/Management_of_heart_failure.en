Management of [[heart failure]] requires a multimodal approach. It involves a combination of lifestyle modifications, medications, and possibly the use of devices or surgery.

==Diet and lifestyle measures==
Patients with CHF are educated to undertake various non-[[pharmacological]] measures to improve symptoms and prognosis. Such measures include:<ref name=Smith>Smith A, Aylward P, Campbell T, et al. Therapeutic Guidelines: Cardiovascular, 4th edition. North Melbourne: Therapeutic Guidelines; 2003. ISSN 1327-9513</ref>
* Moderate physical activity, when symptoms are mild or moderate; or [[bed rest]] when symptoms are severe.
* If [[sleep apnea]] is identified, treat with CPAP, BiPAP, dental appliances or surgery. Sleep apnea is an under recognized risk factor for heart failure
* Weight reduction – through physical activity and dietary modification, as [[obesity]] is a risk factor for heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy.
* Monitor weight - this is a parameter that can easily be measured at home. Rapid weight increase is generally due to fluid retention. Weight gain of more than 2 pounds is associated with admission to the hospital for heart failure<ref name="pmidpending">{{cite journal|author=Chaudhry SI et al. |title=Patterns of Weight Change Preceding Hospitalization for Heart Failure |journal=Circulation |volume= 116|issue=  14|pages=1549–54|year=2007 |pmid= 17846286|pmc=2892745|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.690768}}</ref>
* [[Sodium restriction]] – excessive sodium intake may precipitate or exacerbate heart failure, thus a "no added salt" diet (60–100 [[mmol]] total daily intake) is recommended for patients with CHF. More severe restrictions may be required in severe CHF.

===Fluid restriction===
According to a [[scientific review|review]] in 2009, there is apparently no evidence of benefit of fluid restriction in patients with clinically stable heart failure otherwise receiving optimal pharmacological treatment.<ref name=tai2009>{{cite journal |author=Tai MK |title=[Evidence-based practice of fluid restriction in patients with heart failure] |language=Chinese |journal=Hu Li Za Zhi |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=23–9 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19760574 |doi= |url=}}</ref> The same review suggested that clinicians still choosing to restrict fluid intake for patients with HF should consider an individualized fluid prescription, potentially based on patient body weight, sodium intake, and likelihood of adherence.<ref name=tai2009/>

Theoretically, patients with CHF have a diminished ability to [[excrete]] [[free water]] load. Hyponatremia frequently develops in decompensated heart failure due to the effects of excess circulating neuroendocrine hormones. While the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis due to decreased renal perfusion promotes both sodium and water retention, the activation of atrial natriuretic peptide due to atrial stretch favors sodium excretion, and the activation of antidiuretic hormone due to peripheral baroreceptors that sense hypotension as well as due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system favors water retention alone, leading to disproportionately more water retention than sodium retention. The severity of the hyponatremia during an episode of decompensated heart failure can be predictive of mortality. Generally water intake should be limited to 1.5 L daily or less in patients with [[hyponatremia]], though fluid restriction may be beneficial regardless in symptomatic reduction.'''

==Pharmacological management==
There is a significant evidence–practice gap in the treatment of CHF; particularly the underuse of [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[beta-blocker|β-blockers]] and aldosterone antagonists which have been shown to provide mortality benefit.<ref>Jackson S, Bereznicki L, Peterson G. Under-use of ACE-inhibitor and β-blocker therapies in congestive cardiac failure. Australian Pharmacist 2005;24(12):936.</ref> Treatment of CHF aims to relieve symptoms, to maintain a [[euvolemia|euvolemic]] state (normal fluid level in the circulatory system), and to improve [[prognosis]] by delaying progression of heart failure and reducing cardiovascular risk. Drugs used include: [[diuretic]] agents, [[vasodilator]] agents, positive [[inotrope]]s, [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[beta blocker]]s, and [[aldosterone antagonist]]s (e.g.[[spironolactone]]). Some drugs which increase heart function, such as the positive inotrope [[Milrinone]], lead to increased mortality, and are contraindicated.<ref name="Packer-1989">{{cite journal |author=Packer M |title=Effect of phosphodiesterase inhibitors on survival of patients with chronic congestive heart failure |journal=Am.

===Angiotensin-modulating agents===
Unless contraindicated or not tolerated, [[ACE inhibitor]] (ACE) therapy is recommended for all patients with systolic heart failure, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure.<ref name="Hunt-2005">{{cite journal |author=Hunt SA, Abraham WT, Chin MH, ''et al.'' |title=ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult |journal=Circulation |volume=112 |issue=12 |pages=e154–235 |year=2005 |pmid=16160202 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.167586 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/112/12/e154.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="Krum-2001">{{cite journal | author=Krum H, National Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia & New Zealand Chronic Heart Failure Clinical Practice Guidelines Writing Panel. | title=Guidelines for management of patients with chronic heart failure in Australia | journal= Med J Aust | year= 2001 | volume= 174 | issue= 9 | pages= 459–66 |pmid=11386592}}</ref><ref name=NICECG5>National Institute for Clinical Excellence.

It is also believed that angiotensin directly affects cardiac remodeling, and blocking its activity can thereby slow the deterioration of cardiac function.

A number of studies have been done to investigate whether ACEi plus ARB is better than an ACEi treatment alone in reducing death, disability or hospital admission in CHF with systolic dysfunction. The two largest studies were CHARM-Added and Val-HeFT. <ref name="McMurray-2003">{{cite journal | author=McMurray JJ, Ostergren J, Swedberg K, Granger CB, Michelson EL, Olofssun B, Yusuf S, Pfeffer, MA; CHARM Investigators and Committees. | title=Effects of candesartan on mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure: the CHARM-Added trial | journal=Lancet | year=2003 | volume=362 | issue=9386 | pages=767-771 | pmid=13678869 |10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14283-3}}</ref>

Combined therapy did reduce HF-related hospital admissions with an absolute risk reduction of 4.4% but also increased discontinuation of medication due to adverse effects with an absolute risk increase of 3.7%.<ref name="Heran-2012">{{cite journal | author=Heran BS, Musini VM, Bassett K, Taylor RS, Wright JM. | title=Angiotensin receptor blockers for heart failure.| journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews| year=2012 | issue=23| pmid=22513909 | CD003040 |10.1002/14651858.CD003040.pub2}}</ref> In plain English, 23 people would need to be treated to reduce one hospitalisation for HF while treating 27 people would harm one person with adverse effects. Thus, combined therapy does not improve mortality and may slightly increase morbidity.

===Diuretics===
[[Diuretic]] therapy is indicated for relief of congestive symptoms. Several classes are used, with combinations reserved for severe heart failure:<ref name=Smith/>
* [[Loop diuretic]]s (e.g. [[furosemide]], [[bumetanide]]) – most commonly used class in CHF, usually for moderate CHF.
* [[Thiazide diuretic]]s (e.g. [[hydrochlorothiazide]], [[chlorthalidone]], [[chlorthiazide]]) – may be useful for mild CHF, but typically used in severe CHF in combination with loop diuretics, resulting in a synergistic effect.
* [[Potassium-sparing diuretic]]s (e.g. [[amiloride]]) – used first-line use to correct [[hypokalaemia]].
** [[Spironolactone]] is used as add-on therapy to ACEI plus loop diuretic in severe CHF.
** [[Eplerenone]] is specifically indicated for post-MI reduction of cardiovascular risk.

If a heart failure patient exhibits a resistance to or poor response to diuretic therapy, ultrafiltration or [[aquapheresis]] may be needed to achieve adequate control of fluid retention and congestion. The use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits in patients with diuretic-resistant heart failure and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of diuretics.<sup>9</sup>

Newly emerging evidence showed that glucocorticoids could be used in the treatment of decompensated heart failure to potentiate renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large dose of loop diuretics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=RADO|first=JP|coauthors=BLUMENFELD, G; HAMMER, S|title=The effect of prednisone and 6-methylprednisolone on mercurial diuresis in patients with refractory cardiac edema.|journal=The American journal of the medical sciences|date=1959 Nov|volume=238|pages=542-51|pmid=14435747}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=RIEMER|first=AD|title=Application of the newer corticosteroids to augment diuresis in congestive heart failure.|journal=The American journal of cardiology|date=1958 Apr|volume=1|issue=4|pages=488-96|pmid=13520608}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=NEWMAN|first=DA|title=Reversal of intractable cardiac edema with prednisone.|journal=New York state journal of medicine|date=1959 Feb 15|volume=59|issue=4|pages=625-33|pmid=13632954}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=H|coauthors=Liu, C; Ji, Z; Liu, G; Zhao, Q; Ao, YG; Wang, L; Deng, B; Zhen, Y; Tian, L; Ji, L; Liu, K|title=Prednisone adding to usual care treatment for refractory decompensated congestive heart failure.|journal=International heart journal|date=2008 Sep|volume=49|issue=5|pages=587-95|pmid=18971570}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|coauthors=Liu, G; Zhou, C; Ji, Z; Zhen, Y; Liu, K|title=Potent diuretic effects of prednisone in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance.|journal=The Canadian journal of cardiology|date=2007 Sep|volume=23|issue=11|pages=865-8|pmid=17876376}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|coauthors=Chen, H; Zhou, C; Ji, Z; Liu, G; Gao, Y; Tian, L; Yao, L; Zheng, Y; Zhao, Q; Liu, K|title=Potent potentiating diuretic effects of prednisone in congestive heart failure.|journal=Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology|date=2006 Oct|volume=48|issue=4|pages=173-6|pmid=17086096}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Massari|first=F|coauthors=Mastropasqua, F; Iacoviello, M; Nuzzolese, V; Torres, D; Parrinello, G|title=The glucocorticoid in acute decompensated heart failure: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?|journal=The American journal of emergency medicine|date=2012 Mar|volume=30|issue=3|pages=517.e5-10|pmid=21406321}}</ref> Glucocorticoids induce a potent diuresis in [[heart failure]] because they could improve renal responsiveness to [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] by upregulating natriuretic peptide receptor A [[NPR-A]] expression in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, inducing a potent diuresis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|coauthors=Chen, Y; Kang, Y; Ni, Z; Xiu, H; Guan, J; Liu, K|title=Glucocorticoids improve renal responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide by up-regulating natriuretic peptide receptor-A expression in the renal inner medullary collecting duct in decompensated heart failure.|journal=The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics|date=2011 Oct|volume=339|issue=1|pages=203-9|pmid=21737535}}</ref>

===Beta blockers===
Until recently (within the last 20 years), β-blockers were contraindicated in CHF, owing to their negative inotropic effect and ability to produce [[bradycardia]] – effects which worsen heart failure. However, current guidelines recommend β-blocker therapy for patients with systolic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction after stabilization with diuretic and ACEI therapy, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure.<ref name=NICECG5/> As with ACEI therapy, the addition of a β-blocker can decrease mortality and improve left ventricular function. Several β-blockers are specifically indicated for CHF including: [[bisoprolol]], [[carvedilol]], [[nebivolol]] and extended-release [[metoprolol]]. The antagonism of β<sub>1</sub> inotropic and chronotropic effects decreases the amount of work the heart must perform. It is also thought that catecholamines and other sympathomimetics have an effect on cardiac remodeling, and blocking their activity can slow the deterioration of cardiac function.

===Positive inotropes===
[[Digoxin]] (a mildly positive inotrope and negative chronotrope), once used as first-line therapy, is now reserved for control of ventricular rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation; or where adequate control is not achieved with an ACEI, a beta blocker and a loop diuretic.<ref name=NICECG5/> There is no evidence that digoxin reduces mortality in CHF, although some studies suggest a decreased rate in hospital admissions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haji SA, Movahed A |title=Update on digoxin therapy in congestive heart failure |journal=American Family Physician |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=409–16 |year=2000 |pmid=10929703 |doi=}}</ref> It is contraindicated in cardiac tamponade and restrictive cardiomyopathy.

The inotropic agent [[dobutamine]] is advised only in the short-term use of acutely decompensated heart failure, and has no other uses.<ref name=NICECG5/>

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as [[milrinone]] are sometimes utilized in severe cardiomyopathy. The mechanism of action is through inhibiting the breakdown and thereby increasing the concentration of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] similar to beta adrenoreceptor agonism, resulting in inotropic effects and modest diuretic effects.

===Alternative vasodilators===
The combination of [[isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine]] is the only vasodilator regimen, other than ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, with proven survival benefits. This combination appears to be particularly beneficial in CHF patients with an African American background, who respond less effectively to ACEI therapy.<ref name="Exner-2001">{{cite journal | author=Exner DV, Dries DL, Domanski MJ, Cohn JN | title=Lesser response to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy in black as compared with white patients with left ventricular dysfunction | journal=N Engl J Med. | year=2001 | volume=344 | issue=18 | pages=1351–7 | pmid=11333991 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200105033441802}}</ref><ref name="Taylor-2004">{{cite journal | author=Taylor AL, Ziesche S, Yancy C, Carson P, D'Agostino R Jr, Ferdinand K, Taylor M, Adams K, Sabolinski M, Worcel M, Cohn JN; African-American Heart Failure Trial Investigators. | title= Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2004 | volume=351 | issue=20 |pages=2049–57 | pmid=15533851 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa042934}}</ref>

===Aldosterone receptor antagonists===
The RALES trial<ref name="Pitt-1999">{{cite journal | author=Pitt B, Zannad F, Remme W, Cody R, Castaigne A, Perez A, Palensky J, Wittes J |title=The Effect of Spironolactone on Morbidity and Mortality in Patients with Severe Heart Failure | journal=N Engl J Med. | year=1999 |volume=341 | issue=10 | pages=709–717 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199909023411001 | pmid=10471456}}</ref> showed that the addition of spironolactone can improve mortality, particularly in severe cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction less than 25%.) The related drug [[eplerenone]] was shown in the EPHESUS trial<ref name="Pitt-2001">{{cite journal | author=Pitt B, Williams G, Remme W, Martinez F, Lopez-Sendon J, Zannad F, Neaton J, Roniker B, Hurley S, Burns D, Bittman R, Kleiman J. | title=The EPHESUS trial: eplerenone in patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction complicating acute myocardial infarction.

While the antagonism of aldosterone will decrease the effects of sodium and water retention, it is thought that the main mechanism of action is by antagonizing the deleterious effects of aldosterone on cardiac remodeling.

===Recombinant neuroendocrine hormones===
[[Nesiritide]], a recombinant form of B-natriuretic peptide, is indicated for use in patients with acute decompensated heart failure who have dyspnea at rest. Nesiritide promotes diuresis and natriuresis, thereby ameliorating volume overload. It is thought that, while BNP is elevated in heart failure, the peptide that is produced is actually dysfunctional or non-functional and thereby ineffective.

===Vasopressin receptor antagonists===
[[Tolvaptan]] and [[conivaptan]] antagonize the effects of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), thereby promoting the specific excretion of free water, directly ameliorating the volume overloaded state, and counteracting the hyponatremia that occurs due to the release of neuroendocrine hormones in an attempt to counteract the effects of heart failure. The EVEREST trial, which utilized tolvaptan, showed that when used in combination with conventional therapy, many symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure were significantly improved compared to conventional therapy alone<ref name="Gheorghiade-2007">{{cite journal | author=Gheorghiade M, Konstam MA, Burnett JC Jr, Grinfeld L, Maggioni AP, Swedberg K, Udelson JE, Zannad F, Cook T, Ouyang J, Zimmer C, Orlandi C; Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan (EVEREST) Investigators. | title=Short-term clinical effects of tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin antagonist, in patients hospitalized for heart failure: the EVEREST Clinical Status Trials | journal=JAMA | year=2007 | volume=297 | issue=12 | pages=1332–1343 |pmid=17384438 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.12.1332}}</ref> although they found no difference in mortality and morbidity when compared to conventional therapy.<ref name="Konstam-2007">{{cite journal | author=Konstam MA, Gheorghiade M, Burnett JC Jr, Grinfeld L, Maggioni AP, Swedberg K, Udelson JE, Zannad F, Cook T, Ouyang J, Zimmer C, Orlandi C; Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan (EVEREST) Investigators. | title=Effects of oral tolvaptan in patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure: the EVEREST Outcome Trial | journal=JAMA | year=2007 | volume=297 | issue=12 | pages=1319–1331 | pmid=17384437 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.12.1319}}</ref>

==Devices==
Patients with NYHA class III or IV, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less and a QRS interval of 120 [[millisecond|ms]] or more may benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT; pacing both the [[left ventricle|left]] and [[right ventricle]]s), through implantation of a [[artificial pacemaker|bi-ventricular pacemaker]], or surgical remodeling of the heart.  These treatment modalities may make the patient symptomatically better, improving quality of life and in some trials have been proven to reduce mortality.

Patients with NYHA class II, III or IV, and LVEF of 35% (without a QRS requirement) may also benefit from an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] (ICD), a device that is proven to reduce all cause mortality by 23% compared to placebo in patients who were already optimally managed on drug therapy.<ref name="Bardy-2005">{{cite journal | author=Bardy GH, Lee KL, Mark DB, Poole JE, Packer DL, Boineau R, Domanski M, Troutman C, Anderson J, Johnson G, McNulty SE, Clapp-Channing N, Davidson-Ray LD, Fraulo ES, Fishbein DP, Luceri RM, Ip JH; Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) Investigators. | title=Amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for congestive heart failure | journal=N Engl J Med | volume=352 | issue=3 | pages=225–237 | year=2005 | pmid=15659722 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa043399}}</ref><ref name="pmid11907286">{{cite journal |author=Moss AJ, Zareba W, Hall WJ, ''et al.'' |title=Prophylactic implantation of a defibrillator in patients with myocardial infarction and reduced ejection fraction |journal=N.

Another current treatment involves the use of left [[ventricular assist device]]s (LVADs). LVADs are battery-operated mechanical pump-type devices that are surgically implanted on the upper part of the abdomen. They take blood from the left ventricle and pump it through the aorta. LVADs are becoming more common and are often used by patients who have to wait for heart transplants.

==Surgery==
The final option, if other measures have failed, is [[heart transplantation]] or (temporary or prolonged) implantation of an [[artificial heart]]. These remain the recommended surgical treatment options. However, the limited number of hearts available for transplantation in a growing group of candidates, has led to the development of alternative surgical approaches to heart failure. These commonly involve [[surgical left ventricular remodeling]]. The aim of the procedures is to reduce the ventricle diameter (targeting [[Laplace's law]] and the disease mechanism of heart failure), improve its shape and/or remove non-viable tissue.<ref name="pmid16087128">{{cite journal |author=Tønnessen T, Knudsen CW |title=Surgical left ventricular remodeling in heart failure |journal=Eur.

If heart failure ensues after a myocardial infarction due to scarring and aneurysm formation, reconstructive surgery may be an option. These aneurysms bulge with every contraction, making it inefficient. Cooley and coworkers reported the first surgical treatment of a left ventricular aneurysm in 1958.<ref name="pmid13538738">{{cite journal |author=Cooley DA, Collins HA, Morris GC, Chapman DW |title=Ventricular aneurysm after myocardial infarction; surgical excision with use of temporary cardiopulmonary bypass |journal=J Am Med Assoc |volume=167|issue=5 |pages=557–60 |year=1958 |month=May |pmid=13538738 |doi= |url=}}</ref> They used a linear closure after their excision.

The [[Batista procedure]] was invented by Brazilian surgeon [[Randas Batista]] in 1994 for use in patients with non-ischemic [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]. It involves removal of a portion of viable tissue from the left ventricle to reduce its size (partial left ventriculectomy), with or without repair or replacement of the mitral valve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/heart/pioneers.html|title=Pioneers of heart surgery |accessdate=2007-11-07 |work=NOVA Online: Cut to the heart}}</ref> Although several studies showed benefits from this surgery, studies at the [[Cleveland Clinic]] concluded that this procedure was associated with a high early and late failure rate.

Newer procedures under examination are based on the observation that the spherical configuration of the dilated heart reduces ejection fraction compared to the elliptical form. Mesh-like constraint devices such as the [[Acorn CorCap]] aim to improve contraction efficacy and prevent further remodeling.
