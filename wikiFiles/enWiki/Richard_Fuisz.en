He has also run a modeling agency for Russian women and worked briefly in the White House under Lyndon Johnson.

Later Fuisz was commissioned as a Lt. Commander in the [[United States Navy]].  His Naval work included a White House posting. Fuisz then founded Medcom, a publicly traded medical training company.<ref name=bradley/>

Fuisz established the Seline Modeling Agency together with [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]].

Fuisz, who owned a company that did joint ventures in Moscow, was approached by the then-Soviet ambassador to Washington, Yuri V. Dubinin, to set up a modeling agency to prepare the first waves of Soviet beauties for American commerce (which often meant substantial dental work) and protect them from "adverse influences" and bad publicity like magazine "spreads about their teeth," Fuisz says ... Sukhanova was the first of ten girls he would oversee. But first, he had to free her from the Soviet Union. He did it with the help of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, now one of Russia's oil billionaires but then the head of the Komsomol, or Young Communist League, and beginning his business career in a computer venture with Fuisz.  |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date= |accessdate=2009-02-20 }}</ref>  Seline was acquired by the Click Agency.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Mr. Jacobson questioned the authenticity of the memo, copies of which were sent to Baxter directors and to The Wall Street Journal by Dr. Richard Fuisz, a Washington-area businessman and former chief executive of Baxter's Middle Eastern Medcom subsidiary. Mr. Fuisz sued Baxter in 1985 on charges of wrongful termination and defamation after he was ousted from his job and demoted, Mr. Jacobson said.
