'''Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome''' ('''IFIS''') is a complication that may occur during [[cataract extraction]] in certain patients. This syndrome is characterized by a flaccid [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] which billows in response to ordinary [[aqueous humor|intraocular fluid]] currents, a propensity for this floppy iris to prolapse towards the area of cataract extraction during surgery, and progressive intraoperative [[pupil]] constriction despite standard procedures to prevent this.<ref>

IFIS has been associated with Flomax ([[tamsulosin]]), a medication widely prescribed for urinary symptoms associated with [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]]. Tamsulosin is a selective [[alpha blocker]] that works by relaxing the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] and prostatic smooth muscle. As such, it also relaxes the [[iris dilator muscle]] by binding to its postsynaptic nerve endings. Even if a patient has only taken tamsulosin once in their life, that dose is enough to cause IFIS during cataract extraction indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite pmid|16950249}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|16936084}}</ref>

IFIS is also associated with [[finasteride]], a medication typically used as first line therapy for [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] and [[androgenic alopecia]]. The medication is also associated with [[cataract]] formation.<ref>{{Cite pmid|21555201 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|18053919}}</ref>

IFIS may also be associated with other causes of small pupil like [[Synechia (eye)|synechiae]], [[pseudoexfoliation]] and other medications (used for conditions such as [[glaucoma]], [[diabetes]] and [[high blood pressure]]). IFIS does not usually cause significant changes in postoperative outcomes. Patients may experience more pain, a longer recovery period, and less improvement in visual acuity than a patient with an uncomplicated cataract removal.

The severity of the condition is not linked to the duration of tamsulosin intake.<ref>{{Cite journal
