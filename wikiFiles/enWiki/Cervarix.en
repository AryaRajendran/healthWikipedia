'''Cervarix''' is a [[vaccine]] against certain types of cancer-causing [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).

Cervarix is designed to prevent infection from HPV types 16 and 18, that cause about 70% of [[cervical cancer]] cases.<ref name =pmid_20508593>{{cite pmid|20508593}}</ref> These types also cause most HPV-induced genital and   [[Head and neck cancer|head and neck]] cancers. Additionally, some cross-reactive protection against virus strains 45 and 31 were shown in clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web

Cervarix is manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. An alternative product, from [[Merck & Co.]], is known as [[Gardasil]].<ref name =pmid_20508593/>

==History==
The vaccine was developed, in parallel, by researchers at [[Georgetown University]] Medical Center, the [[University of Rochester]], the [[University of Queensland]] in Australia, and the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]].<ref>{{Cite journal

===Clinical Trials===
Phase III trials have been conducted, including over 18,000 women from 14 countries in [[Pacific Asia]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]] and [[North America]].<ref name="pmid19586656">{{cite journal

}}</ref> Subsequent studies showed Cervarix generated higher [[antibodies|antibody]] levels than Gardasil, the other commercally available HPV vaccine, upon testing seven months later, with twice the level for HPV type 16 and six times for HPV type 18.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}<!-- no clear what ref for this was--> In addition Cervarix induced twice as many [[memory B cells]] as Gardasil for both these HPV strains.

==Indications==
HPV is a virus, usually transmitted sexually, which can cause cervical cancer in a small percentage of those women genital infected. Cervarix is a preventative HPV vaccine, not therapeutic. HPV immunity is type-specific, so a successful series of Cervarix shots will not block infection from cervical cancer-causing HPV types other than HPV types 16 and 18 and some related types, so experts continue to recommend routine cervical [[pap test|Pap smear]]s even for women who have been vaccinated. Vaccination alone, without continued screening, would prevent fewer cervical cancers than regular screening alone.<ref name="harperreview">{{cite doi|10.1097/GCO.0b013e328332c910}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Cervarix is indicated for the prevention of the following diseases caused by oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18: cervical cancer, [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] (CIN) grade 2 or worse and adenocarcinoma in situ, and CIN grade 1. Cervarix is approved for use in females 10 through 25 years of age.<ref name="Highlights">{{cite web
| url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM186981.pdf
| title=Cervarix Prescribing Information
| accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>

===Administration===
Immunization with Cervarix consists of 3 doses of 0.5-mL each, by intramuscular injection according to the following schedule: 0, 1, and 6 months.<ref name =pmid_20508593/> The preferred site of administration is the deltoid region of the upper arm.<ref name =pmid_20508593/> Cervarix is available in 0.5-mL single-dose vials and prefilled TIP-LOK syringes.<ref name="Highlights"/>

===Limitations of effectiveness===
Cervarix does not provide protection against disease due to all HPV types, nor against disease if a woman has previously been exposed through sexual activity and protection may not be obtained by all recipients.<ref name="Highlights"/> It is therefore recommended that women continue to adhere to cervical cancer screening procedures.

==Adverse effects==
* The most common local adverse reactions in ≥20% of patients were pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site.
* The most common general adverse events in ≥20% of subjects were fatigue, headache, muscle pain ([[myalgia]]), gastrointestinal symptoms, and joint pain ([[arthralgia]]).<ref name="Highlights"/>

In common with some other prefilled syringe vaccination products, the tip cap and the rubber plunger of the needleless prefilled syringes contain dry natural latex rubber that may cause [[latex allergy|allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals]].<ref>{{cite web

==Ingredients==

The active components of the vaccine are:<ref name="Highlights"/><ref>http://emc.medicines.org.uk/medicine/20207/PIL/Cervarix/ Patient Information Leaflet</ref>
*Human Papillomavirus type 16 L1 protein 20 micrograms
*Human Papillomavirus type 18 L1 protein 20 micrograms
*[[AS04]] adjuvant, containing: 3-O-desacyl-4'- monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) 50 micrograms adsorbed on [[aluminium hydroxide]], hydrated (Al(OH)3) 0.5 milligrams Al 3+ in total

===Biotechnology===
Cervarix is created using the L1 protein of the viral [[capsid]]. L1 protein is in the form of non-infectious [[virus-like particle]]s (VLPs) produced by recombinant DNA technology using a Baculovirus expression system which uses Hi-5 Rix4446 cells derived from the insect [[Trichoplusia ni]].<ref name="Highlights"/> The vaccine contains no live virus and no DNA, so it cannot infect the patient.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Efficacy==
{{As of|2009|9}}, Cervarix was shown to be effective 7.3 years after vaccination.<ref>{{cite pmid|20024678}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] it is included in the national vaccination programme for teenage and pre-teenage girls aged 12–13 and 17–18. This caused some controversy since Cervarix was chosen over [[Gardasil]], even though Gardasil protects against additional HPV types 6 and 11 (which cause [[genital warts]]). However, the efficacy of Cervarix is higher<ref>{{cite news
