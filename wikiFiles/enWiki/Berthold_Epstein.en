'''Berthold Epstein''' (born 1 April 1897 in [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]; died 1962) was a [[pediatrician]], professor, and [[scientist]] and was conscripted as a doctor in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] during World War II.

==Early life==
He was born into a [[Jews in Czechoslovakia|Jewish]] family. He rose to become professor and director at a Kinderklinik ("Children's Clinic") affiliated with the German Hospital in Prague prior to [[World War II]]. He was married to Ottilie née Eckstein.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.arkivverket.no/URN:db_read/db/33975/167?size=medium&mode=0|title= Spørreskjema for jøder i Norge, Berthold Epstein |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 1942-03-04 |month= |year= |work= |publisher= Riksarkivet |location= Oslo |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= Questionnaire for Jews in Norway |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref>

He travelled to [[Norway]] on March 15, 1940 and was accepted on the recommendation of the Norwegian pediatric association, one of the few physician refugees who was licensed to practice medicine in Norway. As it turned out, he arrived just before the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion]] on April 9, 1940. He was encouraged to apply for the position as the head of the pediatric clinic at [[Rikshospitalet]], but the [[Shoah in Norway|Nazi persecution of Jews]] put an end to such ambitions.<ref name="tidsskriftet.no">{{cite web |url= http://www.tidsskriftet.no/pls/lts/pa_lt.visSeksjon?vp_SEKS_ID=466298 |title= Jødiske pediatere på flukt |accessdate= 2008-01-17 |author= Erlend Hem |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Tidsskriften for den norsle Lægeforening |pages= |language= Norwegian |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Instead, Dr. Epstein conducted research on [[tuberculosis]] until he was arrested on October 27, 1942 and [[Jewish deportees from Norway during World War II|deported]] on the [[SS Donau (1929)|SS ''Donau'']] on November 26 the same year.

==In Auschwitz==
Epstein's family died at Auschwitz whilst he was assigned as a camp physician.<ref name="tidsskriftet.no"/> Several efforts were made—among others by [[Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland|Prince Carl]] of Sweden—to liberate him from the camp, but he was not allowed to leave.

Dr. Epstein was assigned to the [[Jewish]] Camp in Auschwitz. There, he was assigned to assist [[Josef Mengele]], who conducted experiments on human beings, mostly Jewish children, concerning a possible treatment of [[Noma (disease)|noma]], a deadly and disfiguring form of malnutrition-induced [[gangrene]]. About 3000 people died due to the research, which included infecting healthy test persons deliberately with the disease.<ref>{{cite book |last= Koren |first= Yehuda |authorlink= Eilat Negev |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title= In Our Hearts We Were Giants: The Remarkable Story of the Lilliput Troupe-A Dwarf Family's Survival of the Holocaust |origdate= |year= 2004 |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn=0-7867-1365-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 92 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Lifton |first= Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title= THE NAZI DOCTORS: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide |origdate= |year= 1986 |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= 978-0465049042 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 296–297 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>

==Post war==
