'''Ogilvie syndrome''' is the acute [[Intestinal pseudoobstruction|pseudoobstruction]] and dilation of the colon in the absence of any [[Bowel obstruction|mechanical obstruction]] in severely ill patients.<ref name="NEJM">{{cite journal |author=Ponec RJ, Saunders MD, Kimmey MB |title=Neostigmine for the treatment of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction |journal=N.

Colonic pseudo-obstruction is characterized by massive dilatation of the [[Cecum#Cecum|cecum]] (diameter > 10&nbsp;cm) and right colon on abdominal X-ray.<ref name="Sleisenger">{{cite book |last1= Feldman |first1=Mark |first2=Lawrence S. |last2=Friedman |first3=Marvin H. |last3=Sleisenger |title= Sleisenger & Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease |edition=7th   |url= http://intl.elsevierhealth.com/catalogue/title.cfm?ISBN=0721689736 |publisher= Elsevier |year= 2002 |month= July |isbn= 978-0-7216-8973-9}}</ref><ref name="RCCM">{{cite journal |author=Pratt DS, Epstein SK |title=Recent advances in critical care gastroenterology |journal=Am.

The condition carries the name of the British surgeon Sir [[William Heneage Ogilvie]] (1887–1971), who first reported it in 1948.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ogilvie H | title=Large-intestine Colic due to Sympathetic Deprivation | journal=Br Med J | year=1948 | volume=2 | pages=671–673 | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4579.671 | pmid=18886657 | issue=4579 | pmc=2091708}} Reproduced in: {{cite journal |author=Ogilvie WH |title=William Heneage Ogilvie 1887-1971.

==Etiology==
Ogilvie's syndrome may occur after surgery, especially following [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] and [[total joint replacement]].<ref name="AoS">{{cite journal |author=Tenofsky PL, Beamer L, Smith RS |title=Ogilvie syndrome as a postoperative complication |journal=Arch Surg |volume=135 |issue=6 |pages=682–6; discussion 686–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10843364 |doi= 10.1001/archsurg.135.6.682|url=http://archsurg.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/135/6/682}}</ref> It is also seen with neurologic disorders, serious infections, cardiorespiratory insufficiency, and metabolic disturbances. Drugs that disturb colonic motility (e.g., [[anticholinergic]]s or [[opioid]] [[analgesic]]s) contribute to the development of this condition.<ref name="Sleisenger"/><ref name="IrwinRippe">{{cite book |last= Irwin |first= Richard S. |coauthors= Rippe, James M. |title= Intensive Care Medicine  |url= http://www.lww.com/product/?0-7817-3548-3 |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia & London |year= 2003 |month= January |isbn= 0-7817-3548-3}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Ogilvie ct coronal.jpg|thumbnail|right|CT-Scan showing a coronal section of the abdomen of an elderly woman with Ogilvie syndrome]]
The exact mechanism behind the acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is not known. The probable explanation is imbalance in the regulation of colonic motor activity by the autonomic nervous system.<ref name="NEJM"/>

Acute megacolon develops because of abnormal intestinal motility. Normal colonic motility requires integration of myogenic, neural, and hormonal influences. The enteric nervous system is independent but is connected to the central nervous system by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The targets of the enteric neurons are muscle cells, secretory cells, endocrine cells, microvasculature, and inflammatory cells. The neurons in the enteric plexuses are stimulated by a food bolus, which both distends the gut and stimulates the mucosal surface, leading to the release of factors that stimulate interneurons. The stimulated interneurons transmit excitatory signals proximally, which cause contraction and inhibitory signals distally, and these in turn cause relaxation. These signals are transmitted by the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and serotonin, among others.<ref name="NEJM_2">{{cite journal |author=Alam HB, Fricchione GL, Guimaraes AS, Zukerberg LR |title=Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Case 31-2009. A 26-year-old man with abdominal distention and shock |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=361 |issue=15 |pages=1487–96 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19812406 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcpc0900643 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMcpc0900643?url_ver=Z39.88-2003}}</ref>

Acute megacolon can also lead to ischemic necrosis in massively dilated intestinal segments. This is explained by [[Pascal's law]] and [[Young–Laplace equation|Laplaces's law]]. Pascal's principle states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid at rest is transmitted undiminished to all points in the fluid; the pressure across all parts of the lumen is equal. Laplace's law states that T=p x r / (2 x t), where T=wall tension, p=pressure, r=radius, t=wall thickness; the wall tension is proportionate to the radius. Therefore, a dilated intestinal segment has a greater wall tension than a nondilated segment; if the dilatation and tension are sufficiently great, blood flow may be obstructed and ischemia of the bowel will occur.<ref name="NEJM_2"/> Ogilivies syndrome may precipitate Volvulus.

==Signs and symptoms==
Usually the patient has [[abdominal distention]], pain and altered [[bowel movements]].<ref name="Sleisenger"/><ref name="IrwinRippe"/> There may also be nausea and vomiting.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Skeik N Jabr FI |title= Ogilvie Syndrome |journal=Consultant |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=2009 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/photoclinic/article/10162/1376818}}</ref>

==Treatment==
It usually resolves with conservative therapy stopping oral ingestions, i.e. [[nil per os]] and a [[Feeding tube|nasogastric tube]],<ref name="Sleisenger"/> but may require [[colonoscopy|colonoscopic]] decompression which is successful in 70% of the cases. A study published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] showed that [[neostigmine]] is a potent pharmacological way of decompressing the colon.<ref name="NEJM"/> According to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), it should be considered prior to colonoscopic decompression. The use of neostigmine is not without risk since it can induce bradyarrhythmia and bronchospasms.<ref name="IrwinRippe"/> Therefore atropine should be within immediate reach when this therapy is used.<ref name="NEJM"/><ref name="Sleisenger"/><ref name="RCCM"/>

==Prognosis==
It is a serious medical disorder and the mortality rate can be as high as 30%.<ref name="IrwinRippe"/> The high mortality rate is likely a measure that this syndrome is seen in critically ill patients, rather than this syndrome being in itself lethal, although it can also present in otherwise healthy individuals (especially if the disorder was induced by pharmocologic agents). Drug induced megacolon (i.e. from Clozapine) has been associated with mortality as high as 27.5%.<ref name="NEJM_2"/>
