'''Uveitis''' is broadly defined as inflammation of the [[uvea]]. The uvea consists of the middle, pigmented, vascular structures of the eye and includes the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], [[ciliary body]], and [[choroid]]. 

Uveitis requires an urgent referral and thorough examination by an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] along with urgent treatment to control the inflammation.

==Classification==
Uveitis may be classified anatomically into anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitic forms, based on which part of the eye is primarily affected by the inflammation.<ref>Jabs DA, Nussenblatt RB, Rosenbaum JT. Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group. Standardization of uveitis nomenclature for reporting clinical data. Results of the First International Workshop. Am J Ophthalmol 2005;140:509-516.</ref>

* '''Anterior uveitis''' , also known as iridocyclitis and iritis, is the inflammation of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[anterior chamber]]. Anywhere from two-thirds to 90% of uveitis cases are anterior in location. This condition can occur as a single episode and subside with proper treatment or may take on a recurrent or chronic nature.
* '''Intermediate uveitis''', also known as pars planitis, consists of vitritis which is the presence of inflammatory cells in the [[vitreous humour|vitreous cavity]], sometimes with ''snowbanking'', or deposition of inflammatory material on the [[pars plana]]. 
* '''Posterior uveitis''' or [[chorioretinitis]] is the inflammation of the [[retina]] and [[choroid]].
* '''Pan-uveitis''' is the inflammation of all the layers of the uvea.

==Symptoms and signs==
[[File:Anterior-uveitis.jpg|thumb|Anterior uveitis]]
[[File:Ciliary-flush.jpg|thumb|Ciliary flush]]
===Anterior uveitis===
* Redness of the eye
* [[Blurred vision]]
* Photophobia or sensitivity to light
* Eye pain
* [[Floaters]] which are dark, floating spots along the visual field
* Headaches
* Signs of anterior uveitis include dilated [[Ciliary body|ciliary vessel]]s, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and [[keratic precipitate]]s ("KP") on the posterior surface of the [[cornea]]. In severe inflammation there may be evidence of a [[hypopyon]]. Old episodes of uveitis can be identified by pigment deposits on lens, KP's, and festooned pupil on dilation of pupil.

===Intermediate uveitis===
Most common:
* Floaters
* Blurred vision
Intermediate uveitis normally only affects one eye. Less common is the presence of pain and photophobia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Babu|first=BM|coauthors=Rathinam, SR|title=Intermediate uveitis.|journal=Indian journal of ophthalmology|date=2010 Jan-Feb|volume=58|issue=1|pages=21–7|pmid=20029143|doi=10.4103/0301-4738.58469|pmc=2841370}}</ref>

===Posterior uveitis===
Inflammation in the back of the eye is commonly characterized by:
* Floaters
* Blurred Vision
* Photopsia or seeing flashing lights

==Causes==
Although uveitis is usually an isolated illness myriad conditions can be associated with it, including diseases with major involvement of other body parts, as well as syndromes confined to the eye. 

In anterior uveitis, no associated condition or syndrome is found in approximately one-half of cases. However, anterior uveitis is often one of the syndromes associated with [[HLA-B27]]. Presence this type of [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] allele has a [[relative risk]] of evolving this disease by approximately 15%.<ref name=Kumar5-7>Table 5-7 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>

The most common form of uveitis is acute anterior uveitis (AAU). It is most commonly associated with HLA-B27 which has important features: HLA-B27 AAU can be associated with ocular inflammation alone or in association with systemic disease. HLA-B27 AAU has characteristic clinical features including male preponderance, unilateral alternating acute onset, a non-granulomatous appearance, and frequent recurrences whereas HLA-B27 negative AAU has an equivalent male to female onset, bilateral chronic course, and more frequent granulomatous appearance.<ref name=larson /> 
===Noninfectious or autoimmune causes===
* [[Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis]]
* HLA-B27 Related uveitis
* Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome
 
===Infectious causes===
Uveitis may be an immune response to fight an infection inside the eye. While representing the minority of patients with uveitis, such possible infections include:
*[[Brucellosis]]
*[[Leptospirosis]]
*[[Lyme disease]]
*[[Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome]]
*[[Syphilis]]
*[[Toxocariasis]]
*[[Toxoplasmic chorioretinitis]]
*[[Tuberculosis]]

===White Dot syndromes===
Occasionally, uveitis is not associated with a systemic condition: the inflammation is confined to the eye and has unknown etiology. In some of these cases, the presentation in the eye is characteristic of a described syndrome, which are called [[white dot syndromes]], and include the following diagnoses:

*[[Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy]]
*[[Birdshot chorioretinopathy]]
*[[Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis]]
*[[Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome]]
*[[Punctate inner choroiditis]]
*[[Serpiginous choroiditis]]
*[[Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy ]]

===Masquerade syndromes===
Masquerade syndromes are those conditions that include the presence of intraocular cells but are not due to immune-mediated uveitis entities. These may be divided into neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.
*Non-neoplastic:
:*Intraocular foreign body
:*[[Juvenile xanthogranuloma]]
:*[[Retinal detachment]]
:*[[Retinitis pigmentosa]]
*Neoplastic:
:*[[Leukemia]]
:*[[Malignant melanoma]]
:*[[Retinoblastoma]]
:*[[Lymphoma]]
:*[[Malignant melanoma]]
:*[[Reticulum cell sarcoma]]



==Pathophysiology==
===<small>Immunologic factors</small>===
Onset of Uveitis can broadly be described as a failure of the [[Ocular immune system]] and the disease results from [[inflammation]] and tissue destruction. Uveitis is driven by the [[Th17]] T cell sub-population that bear [[T-cell receptor]]s specific for proteins found in the eye.<ref name=nian /> These are often not deleted centrally whether due to ocular antigen not being presented in the [[thymus]] (therefore not negatively selected) or a state of anergy is induced to prevent self targeting.<ref name=lamb /> <ref name=avi /> 

Autoreactive T cells must normally be held in check by the suppressive environment produced by [[Microglia]] and [[dendritic cells]] in the eye.<ref name=forr /> These cells produce large amounts of [[TGF beta]] and other suppressive [[cytokine]]s, including [[Interleukin-10|IL-10]], to prevent damage to the eye by reducing inflammation and causing T cells to differentiate to inducible T reg cells. Innate immune stimulation by bacteria and cellular stress is normally suppressed by myeloid suppression while inducible [[Treg]] cells prevent activation and clonal expansion of the autoreactive [[Th1]] and [[Th17]] cells that possess potential to cause damage to the eye.

Whether through infection or other causes, this balance can be upset and autoreactive T cells allowed to proliferate and migrate to the eye. Upon entry to the eye, these cells may be returned to an inducible Treg state by the presence of IL-10 and TGF-beta from microglia. Failure of this mechanism will lead to [[neutrophil]] and other [[leukocyte]] recruitment from the peripheral blood through [[Interleukin 17|IL-17]] secretion. Tissue destruction is mediated by non-specific macrophage activation and the resulting cytokine cascades.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Khera|first=TK|coauthors=Copland, DA; Boldison, J; Lait, PJ; Szymkowski, DE; Dick, AD; Nicholson, LB|title=Tumour necrosis factor-mediated macrophage activation in the target organ is critical for clinical manifestation of uveitis.|journal=Clinical and experimental immunology|date=2012 May|volume=168|issue=2|pages=165–77|pmid=22471277|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2012.04567.x}}</ref> Serum [[TNF-alpha|TNF-α]] is significantly elevated in cases while [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] and [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]] are present in significantly higher quantities in the[[Aqueous humour]] in patients with both quiescent and active uveitis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Valentincic|first=NV|coauthors=de Groot-Mijnes, JD; Kraut, A; Korosec, P; Hawlina, M; Rothova, A|title=Intraocular and serum cytokine profiles in patients with intermediate uveitis.|journal=Molecular vision|year=2011|volume=17|pages=2003–10|pmid=21850175|pmc=3154134}}</ref> These are inflammatory markers that non-specifically activate local macrophages causing tissue damage.

===<small>Genetic factors</small>===
The cause of non-infectious uveitis is unknown but there are some strong genetic factors that predispose disease onset including HLA-B27<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wakefield|first=D|coauthors=Chang, JH; Amjadi, S; Maconochie, Z; Abu El-Asrar, A; McCluskey, P|title=What is new HLA-B27 acute anterior uveitis?|journal=Ocular immunology and inflammation|date=2011 Apr|volume=19|issue=2|pages=139–44|pmid=21428757|doi=10.3109/09273948.2010.542269}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Caspi|first=Rachel R.|title=A look at autoimmunity and inflammation in the eye|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=NaN undefined NaN|volume=120|issue=9|pages=3073–3083|doi=10.1172/JCI42440}}</ref> and the PTPN22 genotype.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burn|first=Garth L.|coauthors=Svensson, Lena; Sanchez-Blanco, Cristina; Saini, Manoj; Cope, Andrew P.|title=Why is PTPN22 a good candidate susceptibility gene for autoimmune disease?|journal=FEBS Letters|date=1 December 2011|volume=585|issue=23|pages=3689–3698|doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2011.04.032}}</ref>
===<small>Infectious agents</small>===
Recent evidence has pointed to reactivation of [[Herpes simplex]], [[Varicella zoster virus|varicella zoster]] and other viruses as important causes of developing what was previously described as idiopathic anterior uveitis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jap|first=A|coauthors=Chee, SP|title=Viral anterior uveitis.|journal=Current opinion in ophthalmology|date=2011 Nov|volume=22|issue=6|pages=483–8|pmid=21918442|doi=10.1097/ICU.0b013e32834be021}}</ref> Bacterial infection is another significant contributing factor in developing uveitis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dick|first=Andrew D.|title=Road to Fulfilment: Taming the Immune Response to Restore Vision|journal=Ophthalmic Research|date=1 January 2012|volume=48|issue=1|pages=43–49|doi=10.1159/000335982}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Keratic-precipitates.jpg|thumb|Keratic precipitates]]
Diagnosis is includes [[dilated fundus examination]] to rule out Posterior Uveitis which presents with white spots across the retina along with [[retinitis]] and [[vasculitis]].

Laboratory tests is usually used to diagnose specific underlying disease such as rheumatologic tests (Antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) and serology for infectious diseases (Syphilis, Toxoplasmosis, Tuberculosis).

[[Major histocompatibility complex|Major histocompatibility antigen]] testing may be performed to investigate genetic susceptibility to uveitis. The most common antigens include HLA-B27, HLA-A29 (in birdshot chorioretinopathy) and HLA-B51(in Behcet disease). 

Radiology X-Ray may be used to show coexisting arthritis and chest X-Ray may be helpful in sarcoidosis.

==Treatment==
Uveitis is typically treated with [[glucocorticoid]] [[steroid]]s, either as topical eye drops (prednisolone acetate) or as oral therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pato|first=E|coauthors=Muñoz-Fernández, S; Francisco, F; Abad, MA; Maese, J; Ortiz, A; Carmona, L; Uveitis Working Group from Spanish Society of, Rheumatology|title=Systematic review on the effectiveness of immunosuppressants and biological therapies in the treatment of autoimmune posterior uveitis.|journal=Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism|date=2011 Feb|volume=40|issue=4|pages=314–23|pmid=20656330|doi=10.1016/j.semarthrit.2010.05.008}}</ref> Prior to the administration of corticosteroids, [[corneal ulcer]]s must be ruled out. This is typically done using a fluoresence dye test.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fluorescein eye stain|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003845.htm|publisher=NIH|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> In addition to corticosteroids, topical [[cycloplegic]]s, such as [[atropine]] or [[homatropine]], may be used. Successful treatment of active uveitis will see an increase in [[T-regulatory cell]]s in the eye which is likely to contribute to disease regression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ruggieri|first=S|coauthors=Frassanito, MA; Dammacco, R; Guerriero, S|title=Treg Lymphocytes in Autoimmune Uveitis.|journal=Ocular immunology and inflammation|date=2012-05-07|pmid=22564107|doi=10.3109/09273948.2012.681830}}</ref>
In some cases an injection of posterior [[Tenon's capsule|subtenon]] [[triamcinolone]] acetate may also be given to reduce the swelling of the eye.

[[Antimetabolite]] medications, such as [[methotrexate]] are often used for recalcitrant or more aggressive cases of uveitis.  Experimental treatments with [[Infliximab]] or other anti-TNF infusions may prove helpful.

Anti-diabetic drug [[Metformin]] is reported to inhibit the process that causes the inflammation in uveitis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/81923/diabetes-drug-could-treat-leading-cause-of-blindness |title=Diabetes drug could treat leading cause of blindness |date=May 8, 2012}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is generally good for those who receive prompt diagnosis and treatment, but serious complication including [[cataracts]], [[glaucoma]], [[band keratopathy]], [[macular edema]] and permanent vision loss may result if left untreated. The type of uveitis, as well as its severity, duration, and responsiveness to treatment or any associated illnesses, all factor in to the outlook.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uveitis from intelihealth|url=http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/EMIHC000/9339/10942.html}}</ref>



==Epidemiology==
Uveitis affects approximately 1 in 4500 people and is most common between the ages 20 to 60 with men and women affected equally. 

In western countries, anterior uveitis accounts for between 50% and 90% of uveitis cases while in Asian countries the proportion drops to be between 28% and 50%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=JH|coauthors=Wakefield, D|title=Uveitis: a global perspective.|journal=Ocular immunology and inflammation|date=2002 Dec|volume=10|issue=4|pages=263–79|pmid=12854035}}</ref>

Uveitis is estimated to be responsible for approximately 10%-20% of the blindness in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gritz|first=D|title=Incidence and prevalence of uveitis in Northern California The Northern California Epidemiology of Uveitis Study|journal=Ophthalmology|date=1 March 2004|volume=111|issue=3|pages=491–500|doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2003.06.014}}</ref>
