'''Alveolar osteitis''' is inflammation of the alveolar bone (i.e. the [[alveolar process]] of the [[maxilla]] or [[mandible]]). Classically this occurs as a postoperative [[Complication (medicine)|complication]] of [[tooth extraction]]. This usually occurs where the [[blood clot]] fails to form or is lost from the socket (the defect left in the [[gingiva|gum]] when a tooth is taken out). This leaves an empty socket where bone is exposed to the [[oral cavity]], and causes a localized alveolar osteitis limited to the [[lamina dura]] (the bone which lines the socket). This specific type of alveolar osteitis is also known as '''dry socket''' or less commonly fibrinolytic alveolitis and is associated with increased pain and delayed healing time.<ref name="Neville 2002">{{cite book|first=Neville BW, Damm DD, Allen CM, Bouquot JE|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0721690033|page=133|edition=2. ed.}}</ref>

==Classification==
The term is derived as follows: Alveolar refers to the [[alveolus]], the alveolar processes of the [[mandible]] or [[maxilla]]. Osteitis is derived from ''oste-'', from Greek, ''osteon'' meaning "bone", and ''-itis'' meaning a disease characterized by inflammation. Osteitis generally refers to localized inflamamtion of bone with no progression through marrow spaces (compare with [[osteomyelitis]]).<ref name="Soames 1999" /> Often the term alveolar osteitis is considered synonymous with "dry socket", but some specify that dry socket is a focal or localized alveolar osteitis.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> An example of another type of osteitis is focal sclerosing/[[condensing osteitis]].<ref name="Soames 1999" /> The name dry socket is used because the socket has a dry appearance once the blood clot is lost and debris is washed away. Since dry socket occurs exclusively following a dental extraction, it could be considered an [[iatrogenic]] condition, but this does not take into account both the reason why the tooth required extraction (i.e. extraction may have been unavoidable due to significant pain and infection) and also the fact that many dry sockets are the result of poor compliance with postoperative instructions, notably refraining from smoking in the days immediately after the procedure.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Alveolar osteitis labeled dry socket.jpg|thumbnail|right|The most common location of dry socket: in the socket of an extracted mandibular third molar (wisdom tooth). ]]
Since alveolar osteitis is not primarily an infection, there is not usually any [[pyrexia]] (fever) and [[lymphadenitis]] (swollen glands in the neck), and only minimal [[edema]] (swelling) and [[erythema]] (redness) is present in the soft tissues surrounding the socket.

Signs may include:
* An empty socket, which is partially or totally devoid of blood clot.<ref name="Daly 2012" /> Exposed bone may be visible or the clot may be filled with food debris which reveals the exposed bone once it is removed.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> The exposed bone is extremely painful and sensitive to touch.<ref name="Coulthard 2008">{{cite book|last=Coulthard|first=P|title=Master dentistry. volume 1: Oral and maxillofacial surgery, radiology, pathology and oral medicine.|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068966|page=90|edition=2nd ed.|coauthors=Horner K; Sloan P; Theaker E}}</ref> Surrounding inflamed soft tissues may overlie the socket and hide the dry socket from casual examination.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> 
* [[Denuded#Medical use|Denuded]] bone walls.<ref name="Fragiskos 2007" /> 

Symptoms may include:
* Dull, aching, throbbing pain in the area of the socket, which is moderate to severe and may radiate to other parts of the head such as the ear, temple and neck.<ref name="Fragiskos 2007" /><ref name="Tucker 2008" /><ref name="Wray 2003" /><ref name="Daly 2012" /> The pain normally starts on the second to fourth day after the extraction,<ref name="Tucker 2008">{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|page=198|edition=5th ed.|coauthors=Hupp JR; Ellis E}}</ref><ref name="Daly 2012" /> and may last 10-40 days.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> The pain may be so strong that even strong analgesics do not relieve it.<ref name="Daly 2012" /> 
* Intraoral [[halitosis]] (oral malodor).<ref name="Fragiskos 2007" />
* Bad taste in the mouth.<ref name="Fragiskos 2007" />

==Causes==
The cause(s) of dry socket are not completely understood.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is [[extravasation|extravasated]] into the socket, and a blood clot ([[thrombus]]) forms.<ref name="Soames 1999">{{cite book|first=Soames JV, Southam JC|title=Oral pathology|year=1999|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0192628941|pages=296-298|edition=3. ed., [Nachdr.].|coauthors=Southam, J.C.}}</ref> This blood clot is replaced with [[granulation tissue]] which consists of proliferating [[fibroblast]]s and [[endothelial cell]]s derived from remnants of the [[periodontal ligament|periodontal membrane]], surrounding alveolar bone and gingival mucosa.<ref name="Soames 1999" /> In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, [[Fibril|fibrillar]] bone and finally by mature, [[woven bone]].<ref name="Neville 2002" /> The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g. secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerotic]] bone to form).<ref name="Fragiskos 2007" /> The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to fibrinolysis.<ref name="Soames 1999" /> Finrinolysis is the degeneration of the clot and may be caused by the conversion of [[plasminogen]] to [[plasmin]] and formation of [[kinin]]s.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> Factors which promote fibrinolysis include local trauma, [[estrogen]]s, and [[pyrogen (fever)|pyrogen]]s from bacteria.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> Bacteria may secondarily colonize the socket, and lead to further dissolution of the clot.<ref name="Daly 2012" /> Bacterial breakdown and fibrinolysis are widely accepted as a major contributing factors to the loss of the clot.<ref name="Daly 2012" /> Bone tissue is exposed to the oral environment, and a localized inflammatory reaction takes place in the adjacent marrow spaces.<ref name="Soames 1999" /> This localizes the inflammation to the walls of the socket, which become [[necrotic|necrosis]].<ref name="Fragiskos 2007">{{cite book|last=Fragiskos|first=FD|title=Oral surgery|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=3-540-25184-7|page=199}}</ref> The necrotic bone in the socket walls is slowly separated by [[osteoclast]]s and fragmentary [[sequestrum|sequestra]] may form.<ref name="Soames 1999" /> The bones of the jaws seem to have some evolutionary resistance to this process. When bone is exposed at other sites in the human body, this is a much more serious condition. In a dry socket, healing is retarded because tissue must grow from the surrounding gingival mucosa, which takes longer than the normal organisation of a blood clot. Some patients may develop short term halitosis,<ref name="Daly 2012" /> which is the result of food debris stagnating in the socket and the subsequent action of halitogenic bacteria.<ref name="Odell 2010">{{cite book|last=Odell|first=edited by Edward W.|title=Clinical problem solving in dentistry|year=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443067846|pages=67-69|edition=3rd ed.}}</ref> The main factors involved in the development of dry socket are discussed below. Other possible risk factors include [[periodontal disease]], [[acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis]], local bone disease, [[Paget's disease of bone]], [[osteopetrosis]], [[cemento-osseous dysplasia]], a history of previously developing a dry socket with past extractions and inadequate [[oral hygiene]].<ref name="Odell 2010" /><ref name="Soames 1999" /><ref name="Daly 2012" /> Other factors in the postoperative period that may lead to loss of the blood clot include forceful spitting, sucking through a straw, and coughing or sneezing.<ref name="Daly 2012" />   

===Extraction site===
Dry sockets more commonly occur in the mandible than the maxilla, due to the relatively poor blood supply of the mandible and also because food debris tends to gather in lower sockets more readily than upper ones.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> It more commonly occurs in [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] sockets ([[molar teeth]]) than [[anterior]] sockets ([[premolar]]s and [[incisor]]s),<ref name="Soames 1999" /> possibly because the size of the created surgical defect is relatively larger, and because the blood supply is relatively poorer at these sites. Dry socket is especially associated with extraction of lower [[wisdom teeth]].<ref name="Soames 1999" /> Inadequate irrigation (washing) of the socket has been associated with increased likelihood of dry socket.<ref name="Neville 2002" />

===Infection===
Dry socket is more likely to occur where there is a pre-existing infection in the mouth,<ref name="Neville 2002" /> such as [[necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis]] or [[chronic periodontitis]]. Wisdom teeth not associated with [[pericoronitis]] are less likely to cause a dry socket when extracted.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> The oral [[microbiota]] has been demonstrated to have fibrinolytic action in some individuals, and these persons may be predisposed to developing dry sockets after tooth extraction.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> Infection of the socket following tooth extraction is different from dry socket, although in dry socket secondary infection may occur in addition.

===Smoking===
Smoking and tobacco use of any kind are associated with increased risk of dry socket.<ref name="Wray 2003" />  This may be partially due to the [[vasoconstrictor|vasoconstrictive]] action of [[nicotine]] on small [[blood vessel]]s.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> Abstaining from smoking in the days immediately following a dental extraction reduces the risk of a dry socket occurring.

===Surgical trauma===
Dry socket is more likely to occur following a difficult tooth extraction.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> It is thought that excessive force applied to the tooth, or excessive movement of the tooth burnishes the bony walls of the socket and crushes blood vessels, impairing the repair process.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> It has also been shown that dry socket is more likely to occur when an inexperienced surgeon performed the extraction,<ref name="Neville 2002" /> possibly because excessive force or excessive tooth movements are used.

===Vasoconstrictors===
[[Vasoconstrictor]]s are present in most [[local anesthetic]]s, and are intended to increase the length of analgesia by reducing blood supply to the region which reduces the amount of local anesthetic solution that is absorbed into the circulation and carried from the local tissues. Hence, use of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors is associated with an increased risk of dry socket occurring.<ref name="Wray 2003">{{cite book|last=Wray|first=D|title=Textbook of general and oral surgery|year=2003|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh [etc.]|isbn=0443070830|pages=216-217|coauthors=Stenhouse D; Lee D; Clark AJE}}</ref> However, frequently use of local anesthetic without vasoconstrictors would not provide sufficient analgesia, especially in the presence of acute pain and infection, meaning that the total dose of local anesthetic may need to be increased. Adequate pain control during the extraction is balanced against an increased risk of dry socket.

===Oral contraceptives===
Oral contraceptive use is associated with an increased risk.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> 

===Radiotherapy===
Radiotherapy directed at the bones of the jaws causes several changes to the tissue, resulting in decreased blood supply.<ref name="Soames 1999" /> 

==Diagnosis==
Dry socket typically causes pain on the second to fourth day following a dental extraction. Other causes of post extraction pain usually occur immediately after the [[anesthesia]]/[[analgesia]] has worn off, (e.g. normal pain from surgical [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or [[mandibular fracture]]) or has a more delayed onset (e.g. [[osteomyelitis]], which typically causes pain several weeks following an extraction).<ref name="Odell 2010" /> Examination typically involves gentle irrigation with warm [[saline (medicine)|saline]] and probing of the socket to establish the diagnosis.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> Sometimes part of the root of the tooth or a piece of bone fractures off and is retained in the socket. This can be another cause of pain in a socket, and causes delayed healing. A [[dental radiography|dental radiograph]] (x-ray) may be indicated to demonstrate such a suspected fragment.<ref name="Odell 2010" />

==Prevention==
A [[systematic review]] reported that there is some evidence that rinsing with [[chlorhexidine]] (0.12% or 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth reduces the frequency of dry socket.<ref name="Daly 2012" /> Another systematic review concluded that there is evidence that [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] [[antibiotic]]s reduce the risk of dry socket (and infection and pain) following third molar extractions of wisdom teeth, however their use is associated with an increase in mild and transient adverse effects.<ref name="Lodi 2012" /> The authors questioned whether treating 12 patients with antibiotics to prevent one infection would do more harm overall than good.<ref name="Lodi 2012">{{cite journal|last=Lodi|first=G|coauthors=Figini, L; Sardella, A; Carrassi, A; Del Fabbro, M; Furness, S|title=Antibiotics to prevent complications following tooth extractions.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Nov 14|volume=11|pages=CD003811|pmid=23152221}}</ref> Nevertheless, there is evidence that in individuals who are at clear risk may benefit from antibiotics.<ref name="Lodi 2012" /> There is also evidence that antifibrinolytic agents applied to the socket after the extraction may reduce the risk of dry socket.<ref name="Daly 2012" /> 

Some [[dentist]]s and [[oral surgeon]]s routinely [[debridement|debride]] the bony walls of the socket to encourage [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding) in the belief that this reduces the incidence of dry socket, but there is no evidence to support this practice. It has been suggested that dental extractions in females taking oral contraceptives be scheduled on days without estrogen supplementation (typically days 23-28 of the [[menstrual cycle]]).<ref name="Neville 2002" /> It has also been suggested that teeth to be extracted be [[Scaling and root planing|scaled]] prior to the procedure.<ref name="Wray 2003" />  

==Treatment==

Treatment is usually symptomatic,<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> (i.e. analgesic medications) and also the removal of debris from the socket by irrigation with saline or local anesthetic.<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> Medicated dressings are also commonly placed in the socket,<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> although these will act as a foreign body and prolong healing, they are usually needed due to the severe pain. Hence, the dressings are usually stopped once the pain is lessened. Examples of medicated dressings include antibacterials,<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> topical anesthetics<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> and obtundants,<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> or combinations of all three,<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> e.g. [[zinc oxide]] and [[eugenol]] impregnated cotton pellets,<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> alvogyl ([[eugenol]], [[iodoform]] and butamen),<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> dentalone, [[bismuth]] subnitrate and iodoform paste (BIPP) on ribbon gauze<!-- <ref name="Daly 2012" />  --> and [[metronidazole]] and [[lidocaine]] ointment.<ref name="Daly 2012">{{cite journal|last=Daly|first=B|coauthors=Sharif, MO; Newton, T; Jones, K; Worthington, HV|title=Local interventions for the management of alveolar osteitis (dry socket).|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Dec 12|volume=12|pages=CD006968|pmid=23235637}}</ref> A systematic review of the efficacy of treatments for dry socket concluded that there was no evidence to support any of the interventions.<ref name="Daly 2012" /> People who develop a dry socket typically seek medical/dental advice several times after the dental extraction, where the old dressing is removed, the socket irrigated and a new dressing placed.

==Prognosis==
If a dry socket occurs, the total healing time is increased. Post operative pain is also worse than the normal discomfort which accompanies healing following any minor surgical procedure. The pain may last for seven to forty days.<ref name="Wray 2003" /><ref name="Neville 2002" />

==Epidemiology==
Overall, the incidence of dry socket is about 0.5-5% for routine dental extractions,<ref name="Wray 2003" /><ref name="Soames 1999" /><ref name="Daly 2012" />  and about 25-30% for [[tooth impaction|impacted]] [[wisdom teeth|mandibular third molars]] (wisdom teeth which are buried in the bone).<ref name="Neville 2002" /> Females are more frequently affected than males, but this appears to be related to oral contraceptive use rather than any underlying gender predilection.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> The majority of dry sockets occur in individuals aged between 20 and 40 which is when most dental extractions occur, although for any given individual it is more likely to occur in with increasing age.<ref name="Neville 2002" />
