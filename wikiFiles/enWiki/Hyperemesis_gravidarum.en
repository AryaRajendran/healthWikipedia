'''Hyperemesis gravidarum''' ('''HG''') is a condition of pregnancy characterized by intractable [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[dehydration]] and is estimated to affect 0.5-2.0% of pregnant women.<ref name="Emergency">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22876404|last1=Summers|first1=A|title=Emergency management of hyperemesis gravidarum.|journal=Emergency nurse |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=24–28 |year=2012|month=July|pmid=22876404| doi=}}</ref><ref name=Goodwin2008>{{cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=TM|title=Hyperemesis gravidarum.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America|year=2008|month= September|volume=35|issue=3|pages=401–17, viii|pmid=18760227}}</ref> [[Malnutrition]] and other serious [[complication (medicine)|complications]] such as fluid or [[electrolyte imbalance]]s may result. Hyperemesis is considered a rare complication of [[pregnancy]] but, because nausea and vomiting during pregnancy exist on a spectrum, it is often difficult to distinguish this condition from the more common form of nausea and vomiting experienced during pregnancy known as [[morning sickness]].

==Signs and symptoms==
When hyperemesis gravidarum is severe and/or inadequately treated, it may result in:<ref name="Emergency"/>
*Loss of 5% or more of pre-pregnancy [[body weight]]
*[[Dehydration]], causing [[ketosis]], and [[constipation]]
*[[Nutrition disorder|Nutritional disorders]] such as [[Vitamin B1 deficiency|Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency]], [[Vitamin B6 deficiency]] or [[Vitamin B12 deficiency]]
*[[Metabolism|Metabolic]] imbalances such as  metabolic ketoacidosis<ref name="Emergency"/> or [[thyrotoxicosis]]<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21570635|last1=Matthews|first1=DC|last2=Syed|first2=AA |title=The role of TSH receptor antibodies in the management of Graves' disease.|journal=European journal of internal medicine |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=213–216 |year=2011|month=June|pmid=21570635| doi=10.1016/j.ejim.2011.02.006}}</ref>
*Physical and emotional [[stress (biology)|stress]] of pregnancy on the body
*Difficulty with [[activities of daily living]]

Symptoms can be aggravated by [[hunger]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[prenatal vitamins]] (especially those containing [[iron]]), and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].<ref name="Guide to Women's Health">{{cite book|last=Carlson, Karen J., MD; Eisenstat, Stephanie J., MD; Ziporyn, Terra, PhD |title=The New Harvard Guide to Women's Health|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-01343-3 |pages=392–3}}</ref>  Some women with hyperemesis gravidarum lose as much as 10% of their body weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpher.org/PressCenter/presskit/poster-extreme-weightloss.pdf |format=pdf|title=Extreme Weight Loss and Extended Duration of Symptoms Common in Hyperemesis Gravidarum |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> Many sufferers of HG are extremely sensitive to [[odor]]s in their environment; certain smells may exacerbate symptoms. This is known as [[olfaction|hyperolfaction]]. [[Drooling|Ptyalism]], or hypersalivation, is another symptom experienced by some women suffering from HG.

Hyperemesis gravidarum tends to begin somewhat earlier in the pregnancy and last significantly longer than morning sickness. While most women will experience near-complete relief of morning sickness symptoms near the beginning of their [[second trimester]], some sufferers of HG will experience severe symptoms until they give birth to their baby, and sometimes even after giving birth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Do I Have Morning Sickness or HG?|url=http://www.helpher.org/mothers/hyperemesis-or-morning-sickness/index.php|publisher=H.E.R. Foundation|accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>

==Causes==
While there are numerous theories regarding the cause of HG, the cause remains controversial. It is thought that HG is due to a combination of factors which may vary between women and include: [[genetics]],<ref name="Emergency"/> body chemistry, and overall health.<ref>{{cite web|title=HG Theories & Research|url=http://www.helpher.org/hyperemesis-gravidarum/theories-research/index.php|work=helpher.org|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>

One factor is an [[adverse effect|adverse reaction]] to the hormonal changes of pregnancy, in particular, elevated levels of beta [[human chorionic gonadotropin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2936313/|last1=Cole|first1=LA|title=Biological functions of hCG and hCG-related molecules. |journal=Reproductive biology and endocrinology |volume=8 |issue=102 |pages=|year=2010 |month=August|pmid=20735820 |doi=10.1186/1477-7827-8-102}}</ref><ref name="pmid15157839">{{cite journal|author=Hershman JM |title=Physiological and pathological aspects of the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin on the thyroid |journal=Best Pract.

Another postulated cause of HG is an increase in maternal levels of [[estrogen]]s (decreasing intestinal motility and gastric emptying leading to nausea/vomiting).<ref name="Emergency"/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Morning sickness.svg|thumb|275px|Morning sickness]]
Although the pathophysiology of HG is poorly understood, the most commonly accepted theory suggests that levels of [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] are associated with it.<ref name="Australia"/> [[Leptin]] may also play a role.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aka N, Atalay S, Sayharman S, Kiliç D, Köse G, Küçüközkan T |title=Leptin and leptin receptor levels in pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum |journal=The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology |volume=46|issue=4 |pages=274–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16866785 |doi=10.1111/j.1479-828X.2006.00590.x}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Hyperemesis gravidarum is considered an [[diagnosis of exclusion|exclusion]].<ref name="Emergency"/> HG can be associated with serious maternal and fetal morbidity, such as [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]], [[coagulopathy]], [[peripheral neuropathy]],<ref name="Australia">{{cite journal|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afpbackissues/2007/200709/200709sheenan.pdf|last1=Sheehan|first1=P|title=Hyperemesis gravidarum--assessment and management| journal= Australian Family Physician|volume=36|issue=9|pages=698–701|year=2007|month=September|pmid=17885701|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> [[Intrauterine growth restriction|fetal growth restriction]], and even maternal and fetal death.

Women experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum often are dehydrated and lose weight despite efforts to eat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/healthy_living/pregnancy/hic_hyperemesis_gravidarum_severe_nausea_and_vomiting_during_pregnancy.aspx |title=Hyperemesis Gravidarum (Severe Nausea and Vomiting During Pregnancy) |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Cleveland Clinic |accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="Medline">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001499.htm |title=Hyperemesis gravidarum |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref> The onset of the nausea and vomiting in hyperemesis gravidarum is typically before the twenty second week of pregnancy.<ref name="Emergency"/>

===Investigations===
Common investigations include [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN) and electrolytes, [[liver function tests]], [[urinalysis]],<ref name="Medline"/> and [[thyroid function tests]]. Hematological investigations include [[hematocrit]] levels, which are usually raised in HG.<ref name="Medline"/>  An [[ultrasound scan]] may be needed to know gestational status and to exclude molar or partial molar pregnancy.<ref name=manual7>{{cite book|first=[edited by] Arthur T. Evans|title=Manual of obstetrics|year=2007|publisher=Wolters Kluwer / Lippincott Wiliams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780781796965|pages=265–268|edition=7th ed.}}</ref>

==Management==
Because of the potential for severe dehydration and other complications, HG is treated as an emergency. Treatment may include [[antiemetic]]s and intravenous [[rehydration]]. If insufficient, nutritional support may be required. In case of failure of all modalities of treatment, termination of pregnancy may be necessary to preserve health of women.<ref name=handbook /> In those who require admission to the hospital, [[thromboprophylaxis]] such as [[Compression stockings|thromboembolic stockings]] or [[Low molecular weight heparin|low-molecular-weight heparin]] may be recommended.<ref name=handbook />

===Intravenous fluids===
IV hydration often includes supplementation of [[electrolyte]]s as persistent vomiting frequently leads to a deficiency. Likewise, supplementation for lost [[thiamine]] (Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) must be considered to reduce the risk of [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]].<ref name="BNF">{{cite book | author=British National Formulary | authorlink=British National Formulary | title=BNF | edition=45 | year=2003 | month=March | chapter=4.6 Drugs used in nausea and vertigo – Vomiting of pregnancy}}</ref> A and B vitamins are depleted within two weeks, so extended malnutrition indicates a need for evaluation and supplementation. In addition, mineral levels should be monitored and supplemented; of particular concern are [[sodium]] and [[potassium]].

After IV rehydration is completed, patients in general progress to frequent small liquid or bland meals. After rehydration, treatment focuses on managing symptoms to allow normal intake of food. However, cycles of hydration and dehydration can occur, making continuing care necessary. Home care is available in the form of a [[PICC line]] for hydration and nutrition (called [[total parenteral nutrition]]).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844957/|last1=Tuot|first1=D|last2=Gibson|first2=S|last3=Caughey|first3=AB|last4=Frassetto|first4=LA|title=Intradialytic hyperalimentation as adjuvant support in pregnant hemodialysis patients: case report and review of the literature|journal=International urology and nephrology|year=2010|month=March|volume=42|issue=1|pages=233–237|pmid=19911296|doi=10.1007/s11255-009-9671-5}}</ref>  Home treatment is often less expensive than long-term and/or repeated hospital stays.

===Medications===
A number of [[antiemetic]]s are effective and safe in pregnancy including: [[pyridoxine/doxylamine]], [[antihistamines]] (such as [[diphenhydramine]]), and [[phenothiazines]] (such as [[promethazine]]).<ref name=BMJ2011>{{cite journal|last1=Jarvis|first1=S|last2=Nelson-Piercy|first2= C|title=Management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|year=2011|month= June|volume=342|pages=d3606|pmid=21685438}}</ref> With respect to effectiveness, it is unknown if one is superior to another.<ref name=BMJ2011/> 

While pyridoxine/doxylamine, a combination of [[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] and [[doxylamine]], is effective in [[nausea and vomiting of pregnancy]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=PC|last2=Omar|first2=SZ|title=Contemporary approaches to hyperemesis during pregnancy.|journal=Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology|year=2011 |month=April|volume=23|issue=2|pages=87–93|pmid=21297474}}</ref> some have questioned its effectiveness in HG.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tamay|first1=AG|last2=Kuşçu|first2= NK|title=Hyperemesis gravidarum: current aspect.|journal=Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|year=2011 |month=November|volume=31|issue=8|pages=708–12|pmid=22085059}}</ref>

[[Ondansetron]] may be beneficial, however, there are some concerns regarding an association with [[cleft palate]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koren|first=G|title=Motherisk update.

===Nutritional support===
Women not responding to IV rehydration and medication may require nutritional support. Patients might receive [[parenteral nutrition]] (intravenous feeding via a PICC line) or enteral nutrition (via a [[nasogastric tube]] or a nasojejunum tube). [[Vitamin B6]] has been shown to improve outcome.<ref name=matthews>{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=A|last2=Dowswell|first2=T|last3=Haas|first3= DM|last4=Doyle|first4=M|last5=O'Mathúna|first5=DP|title=Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|year=2010|month= September|issue=9|pages=CD007575|pmid=20824863|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> [[Hyperalimentation]] may be necessary in certain cases to help maintain volume requirements and allow weight gain.<ref name=manual7 />  A physician might also prescribe [[Vitamin B1]] (to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy) and [[folic acid]] supplementation.<ref name=handbook />

===Alternative medicine===
Acupuncture has been found to be ineffective.<ref name=matthews />  Evidence supporting the use of ginger to provide symptomatic relief of HG is currently inconclusive due to a lack of study.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/evidence/intervention/1405/0/sr-1405-i13.html |title=Ginger for treating hyperemesis gravidarum |author= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=BMJ Evidence Centre|accessdate=31 January 2013}}</ref>

==Complications==

===Pregnant woman===
If HG is treated inadequately, [[anemia]],<ref name="Emergency"/> [[hyponatremia]],<ref name="Emergency"/> [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]],<ref name="Emergency"/> [[renal failure]], [[central pontine myelinolysis]], [[coagulopathy]], [[atrophy]], [[Mallory–Weiss syndrome|Mallory-Weiss tear]]s,<ref name="Emergency"/> [[hypoglycemia]], [[jaundice]], [[malnutrition]], [[pneumomediastinum]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[deconditioning]], [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolism]], splenic avulsion, and [[vasospasm]]s of [[cerebral arteries]] are possible consequences. [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is a common secondary [[complication (medicine)|complication]] of HG and emotional support can be of benefit.<ref name="Emergency"/>

===Infant===
The effects of HG on the fetus are mainly due to electrolyte imbalances caused by HG in mother.<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|first=edited by Thomas H. Bourne, George Condous|title=Handbook of early pregnancy care|year=2006|publisher=Informa Healthcare|location=London|isbn=9781842143230|pages=149–154}}</ref>  Infants of women with severe hyperemesis who gain less than 7&nbsp;kg (15.4&nbsp;lb) during pregnancy tend to be of lower [[birth weight]], [[small for gestational age]], and born before 37 weeks gestation. In contrast, infants of women with hyperemesis who have a pregnancy weight gain of more than 7&nbsp;kg appear similar to infants from uncomplicated pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dodds L, Fell DB, Joseph KS, Allen VM, Butler B. |title=Outcomes of pregnancies complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum. |journal=Obstet Gynecol. |volume=107 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=285–92 |year=2006| pmid=16449113 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000195060.22832.cd}}</ref> There is no significant difference in the neonatal death rate in infants born to mothers with HG compared to infants born to mothers who do not have HG.<ref name="Emergency"/>

==Epidemiology==
Vomiting is a common condition affecting about 50% of pregnant women, with another 25% suffering from nausea.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1003896 | last1 = Niebyl | first1 = Jennifer R. | year = 2010| title = Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 16| pages = 1544–1550 | pmid = 20942670 }}</ref> However, the incidence of HG is only 0.3—1.5%.<ref name="Australia"/> After preterm labor, hyperemesis gravidarum is the second most common reason for hospital admission during the first half of pregnancy.<ref name="Emergency"/> Factors such as infection with [[Helicobacter Pylori]], a rise in thyroid hormone production, low age, low body mass index prior to pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, [[Hydatidiform mole|molar pregnancies]], and a past history of hyperemesis gravidarum have been associated with the development of HG.<ref name="Emergency"/>

==History==
[[Thalidomide]] was prescribed for treatment of HG in Europe until it was recognized that thalidomide is teratogenic and is a cause of [[phocomelia]] in neonates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=(Ed.) Wayne R.|title=Cherry and Merkatz's complications of pregnancy.|year=2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780683016734|pages=124|edition=5th ed.}}</ref>

===Etymology===
Hyperemesis gravidarum is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''hyper-'', meaning excessive, and ''emesis'', meaning [[vomiting]], and the [[Latin]] ''gravidarum'', the feminine genitive plural form of an adjective, here used as a noun, meaning "pregnant [woman]". Therefore, hyperemesis gravidarum means "excessive vomiting of pregnant women".

==Notable cases==
Author [[Charlotte Brontë]] is often thought to have suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum. She died in 1855 while four months pregnant, having been afflicted by intractable nausea and vomiting throughout her pregnancy, and was unable to tolerate food or even water.<ref>{{cite news|last=McSweeny|first=Linda|title=What is acute morning sickness?|url=http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/what-is-acute-morning-sickness-20100602-wzuy.html|accessdate=2012-12-04|newspaper=The Age|date=2010-06-03}}</ref>
