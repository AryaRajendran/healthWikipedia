'''Maximum inspiratory pressure''' ('''M<sub>IP</sub>''') is the value representing the highest level of negative pressure a person can generate on their own during an inhalation.<ref name="pmid2287259">{{cite journal| author=Coast JR, Clifford PS, Henrich TW, Stray-Gundersen J, Johnson RL| title=Maximal inspiratory pressure following maximal exercise in trained and untrained subjects. | journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc | year= 1990 | volume= 22 | issue= 6 | pages= 811–5 | pmid=2287259 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref> Represented by centimeters of water pressure (cmH2O) and measured with a [[manometer]].

Typical maximum inspiratory pressures in adult males can be estimated from the equation, M<sub>IP</sub> = 142 - (1.03 x Age) cmH<sub>2</sub>O, where age is in years.<ref>[http://thorax.bmj.com/content/39/7/535.full.pdf] "Predicted normal values for maximal respiratory pressures in caucasian adults and children", SH Wilson, NT Cooke, RHT Edwards, SG Spiro</ref>
