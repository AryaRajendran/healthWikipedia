'''Caloric restriction''' (CR), or '''calorie restriction''', is a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary regimen]] that is based on low calorie intake.  "Low" can be defined relative to the subject's previous intake before intentionally restricting calories, or relative to an average person of similar body type.  CR without malnutrition has been shown to work in a variety of species, among them yeast, fish, rodents and dogs to decelerate the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], resulting in longer maintenance of youthful health and an increase in both [[median]] and maximum lifespan.<ref name="Anderson09"/>

No clinical trial has been performed involving humans.  Two trials have been performed involving primates, but have not demonstrated increases in median lifespan.  A study of [[rhesus monkey]]s begun in 1987 by the [[National Institute on Aging]] published results in August 2012 that found evidence of health benefits, but did not demonstrate increased median lifespan.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=Severe Diet Doesn’t Prolong Life, at Least in Monkeys|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date=2012-09-29|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/science/low-calorie-diet-doesnt-prolong-life-study-of-monkeys-finds.html}}</ref> A study by the University of Wisconsin beginning in 1989 is still ongoing.<ref name="Anderson09"/><ref name="pmid19264119"/><ref name = "Colman2009">{{cite journal | author = Colman RJ, Anderson RM, Johnson SC, ''et al. | title = Caloric restriction delays disease onset and mortality in rhesus monkeys. | journal = Science

Calorie restriction is a feature of several [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary regimens]], including the [[Okinawa diet]]<ref>The Anti-Aging Plan: Strategies and Recipes for Extending Your Healthy Years by Roy Walford (page 26)</ref> and the [[CRON-diet]]. Sometimes calorie restriction is called '''calorie restriction with adequate nutrition''' (or '''CRAN''') to clarify that this is done while still keeping healthy levels of protein, vitamins and minerals while lowering calories.

==Research history==
In 1934, [[Mary Crowell]] and [[Clive McCay]] of [[Cornell University]] observed that laboratory rats fed a severely reduced calorie diet while maintaining [[micronutrient]] levels resulted in life spans of up to twice as long as otherwise expected.  These findings were explored in detail by a series of experiments with mice conducted by [[Roy Walford]] and his student [[Richard Weindruch]]. In 1986, Weindruch reported that restricting the calorie intake of laboratory mice proportionally increased their life span compared to a group of mice with a normal diet. The calorie-restricted mice also maintained youthful appearances and activity levels longer and showed delays in age-related diseases. The results of the many experiments by Walford and Weindruch were summarized in their book ''The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction'' (1988) (ISBN 0-398-05496-7).

The findings have since been accepted and generalized to a range of other animals. Researchers are investigating the possibility of parallel physiological links in humans. In the meantime, many people have independently adopted the practice of calorie restriction in some form.

In 1989, scientists at [[University of Wisconsin]] started a study of 20 adult male rhesus monkeys; 9 of them were put on a normal diet and 11 were subjected to a 30% reduction in dietary intake.<ref name="Anderson09"/><ref name="pmid19264119"/> Results are being periodically published.

A study at [[UCSF]] called "CRONA" was started in December 2010, and studied 28 long-term CR practitioners over a few months.<ref>{{cite web

==Effects on humans==
===Positive effects===
====Cardiovascular risks reduced====
Some research has shown CR to reduce [[atherosclerosis]] risk factors.<ref name="fontana_et_al">{{cite journal |last1=Fontana |first1=L. |title=Long-term calorie restriction is highly effective in reducing the risk for atherosclerosis in humans |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=101 |pages=6659–63 |year=2004 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308291101 |issue=17|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.6659F }}</ref>

A small study of long-term CR practitioners studied the effects of a diet with 10–25% less calorie intake than the average "Western" diet. Mean [[Body mass index]] (BMI) was 19.6 in the CR group; the matched group's mean BMI was 25.9, comparable to the BMI for middle-aged people in the US.<ref name=NBC11Health>Elisa Zied, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20746251/ Some Try Calorie Restriction For Long Life], MSNBC, Oct 5, 2007</ref>

The mean BMI in the CR group dropped from 24 (range of 19.4 to 29.6) to 19.5 (range of 16.5 to 22.8) over periods of 3–15 years. Nearly all the decrease in both BMI and cardiovascular risk factors occurred in the first year. Adjusting for age, the average total [[cholesterol]] and [[LDL]] (bad) cholesterol levels in the CR group were below those seen in all but the lowest 10% of the population. The average [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] (good) [[cholesterol]] levels were in the 85th to 90th percentile range for normal middle-aged US men.<ref name=NBC11Health />

:The calorie-restricted group also fared much better than the control group in terms of average blood pressure (100/60 vs. 130/80 mm Hg), fasting glucose, fasting insulin (65% reduction), body mass index (19.6 ± 1.9 vs. 25.9 ± 3.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), body fat percentage (8.7% ± 7% vs. 24% ± 8%), C-reactive protein, carotid IMT (40% reduction), and platelet-derived growth factor AB.<ref name=medscape>{{cite journal |last1=Fontana |first1=L. |title=Long-term calorie restriction is highly effective in reducing the risk for atherosclerosis in humans |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=101 |pages=6659–63 |year=2004 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308291101 |laysummary=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473866 |issue=17|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.6659F }}</ref>

The CR group had [[triglyceride]] levels as low as the lowest 5% of Americans in their 20s. (The CR group's age range was 35–82.)  [[Systole (medicine)|Systolic]] and [[diastolic]] [[blood pressure]] levels in the CR group were about 100/60, a level more typical of 10-year-olds.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Fasting [[Blood_plasma|plasma]] [[insulin]] concentration was 65% lower. Fasting plasma glucose concentration was also lower.

The principal investigator in this study noted an apparent lower rate of cardiovascular aging, with arteriosclerosis progress indicators particularly slowed.

The comparison group's statistics aligned approximately with the US national average on the dimensions considered.<ref name=WashingtonStLouisStudy>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7586.php Strict diet lowers heart risk.]</ref> Fasting plasma insulin levels<ref name=FPItest>{{cite journal |last1=Weyer |first1=C. |last2=Hanson |first2=R.

====Improved memory====
A 2009 research paper compared results of a group of normal to overweight elderly people who were given no intervention, who were given fish oil, or who were placed on a CR diet: the CR subjects "were instructed to reduce caloric intake aiming at a 30% reduction relative to previous habits, over a period of 3 months".<ref name="Witte">{{cite journal |last1=Witte |first1=A.

Reacting to this study, a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association said that people, particularly for those already at normal or low weight, should be "extremely careful" about attempting such a diet. She said, "There is other evidence that, far from enhancing memory, dieting or removing meals can interfere with memory and brain function.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7847174.stm|title=Cutting calories 'boosts memory'|date=27 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-27 | work=BBC News}}</ref> Another study found that while people who were underweight or of normal weight from midlife onward were at reduced risk of [[dementia]], for people older than 65, those who were underweight had a ''higher'' dementia risk than normal or overweight people.<ref name="Fitzpatrick">{{cite journal |first1=Annette L. |last1=Fitzpatrick |first2=Lewis H. |last2=Kuller |first3=Oscar L. |last3=Lopez |first4=Paula |last4=Diehr |first5=Ellen S. |last5=O'Meara |first6=W.

Beyond using lean tissue as an energy source, the presence of catabolic hormones, such as [[Cortisol#Effects|cortisol]], and the lack of [[anabolic]] ones, such as [[Insulin#Physiological effects|insulin]], disrupts protein synthesis, amino acid uptake, and immune response.

People who lose weight as a result of CR but who are sedentary have a reduced capacity to perform exercise compared with those who lost similar amounts of weight from exercise alone,<ref name="B">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20746251/ |title=Some try extreme calorie restriction for long life |date=|accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> emphasizing the need for strength training in CR practitioners.

A study of long-term CR practitioners "who had been eating a CR diet (approximately 35% less calories than controls) for an average of 6.8 ± 5.2 years (mean age 52.7 ± 10.3 years)" found that they had reduced [[bone mineral density]] at the level of [[hip]] and [[Vertebral column|spine]], in accordance with a previous one-year weight-loss trial,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Dennis T. |last1=Villareal |first2=Luigi |last2=Fontana |first3=Edward P. |last3=Weiss |first4=Susan B. |last4=Racette |first5=Karen |last5=Steger-May |first6=Kenneth B. |last6=Schechtman |first7=Samuel |last7=Klein |first8=John O. |last8=Holloszy |title=Bone mineral density response to caloric restriction-induced weight loss or exercise-induced weight loss: a randomized controlled trial |pmid=17159017 |year=2006 |pages=2502–10 |issue=22 |volume=166 |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |doi=10.1001/archinte.166.22.2502}}</ref> but that after initial weight loss they had achieved a stable, normal level of bone turnover and that the microarchitectural structure of their bones was healthy; the researchers concluded that "These findings suggest that markedly reduced BMD is not associated with significantly reduced bone quality in middle-aged men and women practicing long-term calorie restriction with adequate nutrition."<ref name="Villareal et al, 2011">{{cite journal|last=Villareal|first=Dennis T.|coauthors=Kotyk, John J.; Armamento-Villareal, Reina C.; Kenguva, Venkata; Seaman, Pamela; Shahar, Allon; Wald, Michael J.; Kleerekoper, Michael; Fontana, Luigi|title=Reduced bone mineral density is not associated with significantly reduced bone quality in men and women practicing long-term calorie restriction with adequate nutrition|journal=Aging Cell|year=2011|month=February|volume=10|issue=1|pages=96–102|doi=10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00643.x|pmid=20969721|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00643.x/full|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>  Some specialists say that minor mineral losses can be minimized with regular physical activity and [[vitamin D]] and [[calcium]] supplements.<ref>http://www.turner-white.com/memberfile.php?PubCode=jcom_apr07_calcium.pdf</ref>

====Low BMI, high mortality====
CR diets typically lead to reduced body weight, and in some studies, low body weight has been associated with increased mortality, particularly in late middle-aged or elderly subjects. One of the more famous of such studies linked a [[body mass index]] (BMI) lower than 18 in women with increased mortality from noncancer, non−cardiovascular disease causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Flegal |first1=K.

:"epidemiologists from the ACS ([[American Cancer Society]]), [[American Heart Association]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]], and other organizations raised specific methodologic questions about the recent [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) study and presented analyses of other data sets.

Such epidemiological studies of body weight are not about CR as used in anti-aging studies; they are not about caloric intake to begin with, as body weight is influenced by many factors other than energy intake.

====Not for the young or those seeking to become pregnant====
Long-term calorie restriction at a level sufficient for slowing the aging process is generally not recommended in [[children]], [[adolescents]], and [[youth|young adults]] (under the age of approximately 21), because this type of diet may interfere with natural physical growth, as has been observed in [[laboratory animals]]. In addition, mental development and physical changes to the [[brain]] take place in late adolescence and early adulthood that could be negatively affected by severe calorie restriction.<ref name="D">{{cite web|url=http://www.crsociety.org/Risks |title=Risks |date=|accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> [[Pregnant]] women and women trying to become pregnant are advised not to practice calorie restriction, because low BMI may result in ovulatory dysfunction ([[infertility]]), and underweight mothers are more prone to [[preterm delivery]].<ref name="D"/>

====Miscellaneous concerns====
It has also been noted that people losing weight on such diets risk developing [[cold sensitivity]], [[menstrual irregularities]], and even [[infertility]] and hormonal changes.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2786899/ |title=Cellular mechanisms of cardioprotection by calorie restriction: state of the science and future perspectives |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref>

Moreover, calorie restriction has been reported in mice to hinder their ability to fight [[infection]], and some evidence suggests that in patients with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], calorie restriction accelerates the onset of the disease.<ref name="E">{{cite web|url=http://www.senescence.info/caloric_restriction.html |title=Caloric Restriction |date=|accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>

Excessive calorie restriction may result in [[starvation]].

===Rodents===

Seventy years ago, C. M. McCay et al. discovered that reducing the amount of calories fed to rodents nearly doubled their life spans. The life extension varied for each species, but on average there was a 30–40% increase in life span in both mice and rats.<ref name="Mattson05">{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=Mark P. |title=ENERGY INTAKE, MEAL FREQUENCY, AND HEALTH: A Neurobiological Perspective* |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=25 |pages=237–60 |year=2005 |pmid=16011467 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.25.050304.092526}}</ref> CR preserves a range of structural and functional parameters in aging rodents. For example, studies in female mice have shown that [[estrogen receptor]]-alpha declines in the aging pre-optic [[hypothalamus]]. The female mice that were given a calorically restricted diet during the majority of their lives maintained higher levels of ERα in the pre-[[human eye|optic]] hypothalamus than did their non–calorically restricted counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yaghmaie |first1=F |last2=Saeed |first2=O |last3=Garan |first3=SA |last4=Freitag |first4=W |last5=Timiras |first5=PS |last6=Sternberg |first6=H |title=Caloric restriction reduces cell loss and maintains estrogen receptor-alpha immunoreactivity in the pre-optic hypothalamus of female B6D2F1 mice |journal=Neuro endocrinology letters |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=197–203 |year=2005 |pmid=15990721}}</ref>

Studies in female mice have shown that both the [[Supraoptic nucleus]] (SON) and [[Paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN) lose about one-third of IGF-1R immunoreactivity with normal aging. Old calorically restricted mice lose higher numbers of IGF-1R non-immunoreactive cells while maintaining similar counts of IGF-1R immunoreactive cells in comparison to Old-Al mice.  Consequently, Old-CR mice show a higher percentage of IGF-1R immunoreactive cells, reflecting increased hypothalamic sensitivity to IGF-1, in comparison to normally aging mice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Saeed |first1=O |last2=Yaghmaie |first2=F |last3=Garan |first3=S |last4=Gouw |first4=A |last5=Voelker |first5=M |last6=Sternberg |first6=H |last7=Timiras |first7=P |title=Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor immunoreactive cells are selectively maintained in the paraventricular hypothalamus of calorically restricted mice |journal=International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=23–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17194562 |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2006.11.004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yaghmaie |first1=F |last2=Saeed |first2=O |last3=Garan |first3=S |last4=Voelker |first4=M |last5=Gouw |first5=A |last6=Freitag |first6=W |last7=Sternberg |first7=H |last8=Timiras |first8=P |title=Age-dependent loss of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor immunoreactive cells in the supraoptic hypothalamus is reduced in calorically restricted mice |journal=International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=431–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17034982 |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2006.08.008}}</ref>

===Yeast===
Fungi models are very easy to manipulate, and many crucial steps toward the understanding of aging have been made with them. Many studies were undertaken on budding yeast and fission yeast to analyze the cellular mechanisms behind increased longevity due to calorie restriction. First, calorie restriction is often called dietary restriction because the same effects on life span can be achieved by only changing the nutrient quality without changing the amount of calories. Data from Dr Guarente, Dr Kennedy, Dr Jazwinski, Dr Kaeberlein, Dr Longo, Dr Shadel, Dr Nyström, Dr Piper, and others showed that genetic manipulations in nutrient-signaling pathways could mimic the effects of dietary restriction. In some cases, dietary restriction requires mitochondrial respiration to increase longevity (chronological aging), and in some other cases not (replicative aging). Nutrient sensing in yeast controls stress defense, mitochondrial functions, Sir2, and others. These functions are all known to regulate aging. Genes involved in these mechanisms are TOR, PKA, SCH9, MSN2/4, RIM15, SIR2,...<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kaeberlein |first1=Matt |last2=Burtner |first2=Christopher R. |last3=Kennedy |first3=Brian K. |title=Recent Developments in Yeast Aging |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e84 |year=2007 |pmid=17530929 |pmc=1877880 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030084}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dilova |first1=I. |last2=Easlon |first2=E. |last3=Lin |first3=S. -J. |title=Calorie restriction and the nutrient sensing signaling pathways |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=752–67 |year=2007 |pmid=17260088 |doi=10.1007/s00018-007-6381-y}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=D |last2=Guarente |first2=L |title=SIR2: a potential target for calorie restriction mimetics |journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=64–71 |year=2007 |pmid=17207661 |doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2006.12.004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piper |first1=Peter W. |title=Long-lived yeast as a model for ageing research |journal=Yeast |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=215–26 |year=2006 |pmid=16498698 |doi=10.1002/yea.1354}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Longo |first1=V |title=Linking sirtuins, IGF-I signaling, and starvation |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=44 |issue=1–2 |pages=70–4 |year=2009 |pmid=18638538 |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2008.06.005}}</ref>

===''Caenorhabditis elegans''===
Recent work on ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' has shown that restriction of glucose metabolism extends life span by primarily increasing [[oxidative stress]] to exert an ultimately increased resistance against oxidative stress, a process called [[hormesis|(mito)hormesis]].<ref name="cellmetabolism.org"/>

==Effects of CR on animal behavior==
===Activity level===
Laboratory rodents placed on a CR diet tend to exhibit increased activity levels (particularly when provided with exercise equipment) at feeding time. In one study, animals on a conventional diet "showed little activity" by early middle age, while those on CR "were observed to run around the cage and climb onto and hang from the wire cage tops throughout their life spans. In fact, the longest surviving [CR] mouse was observed hanging from the top of his cage only 3 days before he became moribund."<ref>Means, L. W., Higgins, J. L., & Fernandez, T. J. (1993). Mid-life onset of dietary restriction extends life and prolongs cognitive functioning. Physiology & Behavior, 54, 503–508.</ref> Monkeys undergoing CR also appear more restless immediately before and after meals.<ref name="KV">Vitousek, K. M., Manke, F. P., Gray, J. A., & Vitousek, M. N. (2004). Caloric Restriction for Longevity: II--The Systematic Neglect of Behavioural and Psychological Outcomes in Animal Research. European Eating Disorders Review, 12(6), 338-360.</ref>

===Stereotyped behavior===
Observations in some accounts of animals undergoing CR have noted an increase in stereotyped behaviors.<ref name="KV" /> For example, monkeys on CR have demonstrated an increase in licking, sucking, and rocking behavior.<ref>Weed, J.

===Food-related behavior===
Unlike rodents with normal access to food, rats on CR exhibit longer periods of eating, higher food consumption,<ref>Duffy, P. H., Feuers, R., Leakey, J. E. A., & Hart, R. W. (1991).

===Aggression===
A CR regimen may also lead to increased aggressive behavior in animals.<ref name="KV" /> For example, rats on CR are prone to attack strangers more fiercely and are more likely to kill other rats than are controls,<ref name="Lore, R. 1986"/> while monkeys have been observed to demonstrate threat displays at meal times.<ref name="Ramsey" />

Even though there has been research on CR for over 70 years, the mechanism by which CR works is still not well understood.<ref name="Anderson09">{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=R.

Mattson, Edward J. Calabrese</ref>

===Hormesis===
{{Main|Hormesis}}
Research has pointed toward [[hormesis]] as an explanation. Southam and Ehrlich (1943) reported that a bark extract that was known to inhibit fungal growth actually stimulated growth when given at very low concentrations. They coined the term "[[hormesis]]" to describe such beneficial actions resulting from the response of an organism to a low-intensity biological stressor. The word "hormesis" is derived from the Greek word "hormaein", which means "to excite". The [[hormesis|(mito)hormesis hypothesis of CR]] proposes that the diet imposes a low-intensity biological stress on the organism, which elicits a defensive response that helps protect it against the causes of aging. In other words, CR places the organism in a defensive state so that it can survive adversity, resulting in improved health and longer life. This switch to a defensive state may be controlled by [[longevity genes]] (see below).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=M |title=Dietary Factors, Hormesis and Health |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=43–8 |year=2008 |pmid=17913594 |pmc=2253665 |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.08.004}}</ref>

====Mitochondrial hormesis====
Mitochondrial hormesis was a purely hypothetical concept until late 2007, when work by [[Michael Ristow]]'s group on a small worm named [[Caenorhabditis elegans]] suggested that the restriction of glucose metabolism extends life span primarily by increasing [[oxidative stress]] to stimulate the organism into having an ultimately increased resistance to further oxidative stress.<ref name="cellmetabolism.org">{{cite journal |last1=Schulz |first1=Tim J. |last2=Zarse |first2=Kim |last3=Voigt |first3=Anja |last4=Urban |first4=Nadine |last5=Birringer |first5=Marc |last6=Ristow |first6=Michael |title=Glucose Restriction Extends Caenorhabditis elegans Life Span by Inducing Mitochondrial Respiration and Increasing Oxidative Stress |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=280–293 |year=2007 |pmid=17908557 |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.08.011}}</ref> This is probably the first experimental evidence for [[hormesis]] being the reason for extended life span following CR.

Although aging can be conceptualized as the accumulation of damage, the more recent determination that free radicals participate in intracellular signaling has made the categorical equation of their effects with "damage" more problematic than was commonly appreciated in the past. It was previously proposed on a hypothetical basis that free radicals may induce an endogenous response culminating in more effective adaptations that protect against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tapia |first1=P |title=Sublethal mitochondrial stress with an attendant stoichiometric augmentation of reactive oxygen species may precipitate many of the beneficial alterations in cellular physiology produced by caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary phytonutrients: "Mitohormesis" for health and vitality |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=832–43 |year=2006 |pmid=16242247 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.009}}</ref> Recent experimental evidence strongly suggests that this is indeed the case, and that such induction of endogenous free-radical production extends the [[life expectancy|life span]] of a model organism and mitohormetically exerts life-extending and health-promoting effects.

===Evolution===
It has been recently argued that during years of famine, it may be evolutionarily desirable for an organism to avoid reproduction and to up-regulate protective and repair enzyme mechanisms to try to ensure that it is fit for reproduction in future years. This argument seems to be supported by recent work studying hormones.<ref>[Charlie Rose- Calorie restriction]</ref> A study on male mice found that CR generally feminizes gene expression, and that many of the most significantly changed individual genes are involved in aging, hormone signaling, and p53-associated regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis; it concluded that the life-extending effects of CR may arise partly from a shift toward a gene expression profile more typical of females.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Estep |first1=Preston Wayne |last2=Warner |first2=Jason B. |last3=Bulyk |first3=Martha L. |editor1-last=Orban |editor1-first=Laszlo |title=Short-Term Calorie Restriction in Male Mice Feminizes Gene Expression and Alters Key Regulators of Conserved Aging Regulatory Pathways |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e5242 |year=2009 |pmid=19370158 |pmc=2667255 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005242 |bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.5242E}}</ref> Prolonged severe CR lowers total serum and free testosterone while increasing SHBG concentrations in humans; these effects are independent of adiposity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cangemi |first1=Roberto |last2=Friedmann |first2=Alberto J. |last3=Holloszy |first3=John O. |last4=Fontana |first4=Luigi |title=Long-term effects of calorie restriction on serum sex-hormone concentrations in men |journal=Aging Cell |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=236–42 |year=2010 |pmid=20096034 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00553.x}}</ref> {{See also|Insulin#Physiological effects}}

Two very prominent proposed explanations of aging that have a bearing on calorie restriction are the [[Free-radical theory|free radical theory]] and the [[glycation]] theory. With high amounts of energy available, [[mitochondria]] do not operate very efficiently and generate more [[superoxide]]. With CR, energy is conserved and there is less free radical generation. A CR organism will have less fat and require less energy to support the weight, which also means that there does not need to be as much glucose in the bloodstream.

Less blood glucose means less [[glycation]] of adjacent proteins and less fat to oxidize in the bloodstream to cause sticky blocks resulting in atherosclerosis. Type 2 [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetics]] are people with insulin insensitivity caused by long-term exposure to high blood glucose. Obesity leads to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes and uncontrolled type 1 diabetes are much like "accelerated aging", due to the above effects. There may even be a continuum between CR and the [[metabolic syndrome]].

Caloric restriction with optimal nutrition has not been tested in comparison to caloric excess with optimal nutrition. It may be that with extra calories, nutrition must be similarly increased to ratios comparable to that of calorie restriction in order to provide similar anti-aging benefits. Stated levels of calorie needs may be biased towards sedentary individuals. Calorie restriction may be nothing other than adapting the diet to the body's needs.

==Caloric restriction mimetics==
{{Main|Caloric restriction mimetic}}
Work on the mechanisms of CR has given hope to the synthesizing of future drugs to increase the human life span by simulating the effects of calorie restriction. In particular, the large number of genes and pathways reported to regulate the actions of CR in model organisms represent attractive targets for developing drugs that mimic the benefits of CR without its side effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Minor|first=RK|coauthors=Allard, JS; Younts, CM; Ward, TM; de Cabo, R|title=Dietary interventions to extend life span and health span based on calorie restriction.|journal=The journals of gerontology.

[[Matt Kaeberlein]] and [[Brian K. Kennedy|Brian Kennedy]] at the University of Washington believe that Sinclair's work on resveratrol is an artifact and that the Sir2 gene has no relevance to CR. They have proposed that caloric restriction increases life span by decreasing the activity of the [[Mammalian target of rapamycin|Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kaeberlein |first1=Matt |last2=Kirkland |first2=Kathryn T. |last3=Fields |first3=Stanley |last4=Kennedy |first4=Brian K. |title=Sir2-Independent Life Span Extension by Calorie Restriction in Yeast |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e296 |year=2004 |pmid=15328540 |pmc=514491 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020296}}</ref><ref name="Pp">{{cite journal |last1=Kaeberlein |first1=M |last2=Powersiii |first2=R |title=Sir2 and calorie restriction in yeast: A skeptical perspective |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=128–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17512264 |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.04.001}}</ref>

Gurarente has recently published that behavior associated with caloric restriction did not occur when Sirt1 knockout mice were put on a calorie-restricted diet, the implication being that Sirt1 is necessary for mediating the effects of caloric restriction. However, the same paper also reported that the biochemical parameters thought to mediate the life span–extending effects of calorie restriction (reduced insulin, IGF-1, and fasting glucose) were no different in normal mice and mice lacking Sirt1. Whether the life span–extending effect of CR was still evident in Sirt1 knockout mice was not reported in that study. According to Sinclair's data, Sirtuins (SirT1, Sir2, ...) are behind the putative effect of calorie restriction on longevity,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oberdoerffer |first1=Philipp |last2=Michan |first2=Shaday |last3=McVay |first3=Michael |last4=Mostoslavsky |first4=Raul |last5=Vann |first5=James |last6=Park |first6=Sang-Kyu |last7=Hartlerode |first7=Andrea |last8=Stegmuller |first8=Judith |last9=Hafner |first9=Angela |title=DNA damage-induced alterations in chromatin contribute to genomic integrity and age-related changes in gene expression |journal=Cell |volume=135 |issue=5 |pages=907–18 |year=2008 |pmid=19041753 |pmc=2853975 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.025}}</ref> although some research has cast doubt on this claim.<ref name="Pp" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fabrizio |first1=Paola |last2=Gattazzo |first2=Cristina |last3=Battistella |first3=Luisa |last4=Wei |first4=Min |last5=Cheng |first5=Chao |last6=McGrew |first6=Kristen |last7=Longo |first7=Valter D. |title=Sir2 Blocks Extreme Life-Span Extension |journal=Cell |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=655–67 |year=2005 |pmid=16286010 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.08.042}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Y |last2=Xu |first2=W |last3=McBurney |first3=M |last4=Longo |first4=V |title=SirT1 inhibition reduces IGF-I/IRS-2/Ras/ERK1/2 signaling and protects neurons |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=38–48 |year=2008 |pmid=18590691 |pmc=2822839 |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2008.05.004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pacholec |first1=M. |last2=Bleasdale |first2=J.

CR extends the life span and prevents aging. It has been found that these effects are modulated by SIRT3, a member of the sirtuins, a class of protein deacetylases. SIRT3 is mitochondrial. SIRT3-knockout mice did not live longer when calorically restricted, but wild-type mice did live longer when calorically restricted.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Someya S, Yu W, Hallows WC, Xu J, Vann JM, Leeuwenburgh C, Tanokura M, Denu JM, Prolla TA.

==Objections==
===No benefit to houseflies, overfed model organisms===
One set of experiments shows that CR has no benefits in the [[housefly]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=T. M. |last2=Mockett |first2=RJ |last3=Sohal |first3=BH |last4=Sohal |first4=RS |last5=Orr |first5=WC |title=Effect of caloric restriction on life span of the housefly, ''Musca domestica'' |journal=The FASEB Journal |volume=18 |issue=13 |pages=1591–3 |year=2004|pmid=15319362 |doi=10.1096/fj.03-1464fje}}</ref> The authors hypothesize that the widely purported effects of CR may be because a diet containing more calories can increase [[bacteria]]l proliferation, or because the type of high-calorie diets used in past experiments have a stickiness, general composition, or texture that reduces longevity.

At one time, some researchers suggested that some of the effects of CR are artifacts because the laboratory model organisms are kept on non-physiological high-calorie diets. This would mean that calorie restriction simply means mimicking the energy supply of a natural environment.<ref name="Hayflick, 1994">{{cite book|last=Hayflick|first=Leonard|title=How and Why We Age|year=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780345401557|page=285}}</ref> However, many modern CR studies restrict the control animals by 10–20% below their ad libitum intake in order to avoid confounding by obesity. Additionally, "at least some laboratory mice under a caloric restriction regimen that maximizes longevity have been reported to cease estrous cycling. Because all existing wild mice populations must reproduce or become extinct, presumably they are eating relatively more than restricted laboratory mice during at least part of the year."<ref name="Austad, 2001">{{cite journal|last=Austad|first=Steven N.|title=Does Caloric Restriction in the Laboratory Simply Prevent Overfeeding and Return House Mice to Their Natural Level of Food Intake?|journal=SAGE KE|date=November 2001|volume=2001|issue=6|pages=pe3|doi=10.1126/sageke.2001.6.pe3|pmid=14602968|url=http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/2001/6/pe3|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> A study designed to evaluate the energy intake, expenditure, and balance of mice in the wild, ad libitum–fed laboratory mice, and calorie-restricted mice concluded that "CR experiments do in fact restrict energy consumption beyond that typically experienced by mice in nature.

===Physical activity testing biases===
While some tests of calorie restriction have shown increased muscle tissue in the calorie-restricted test subjects, how this has occurred is unknown.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Muscle tissue grows when stimulated, so it is possible that the calorie-restricted test animals exercised more than their companions on higher calories. The reason behind this may be that animals enter a foraging state during calorie restriction. To control for this variable, tests would need to be monitored to ensure that levels of physical activity are equal between groups.

===Insufficient calories and amino acids for exercise===
Exercise has also been shown to increase health and life span and lower the incidence of several diseases (relative to sedentary and obese controls, but not to energy-restricted sedentary controls of matching body weight).<ref>{{cite web|author=J. O. Holloszy and K. B. Schechtman |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/70/4/1529.short |title=Interaction between exercise and food restriction: effects on longevity of male rats |publisher=Jap.physiology.org |date=1991-04-01 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref> Calorie restriction comes into conflict with the high caloric needs of [[sportsperson|athlete]]s, and may not provide them sufficient energy levels or amino acids for repair, although this is not a criticism of CR per se, since it is certainly possible to be an unhealthy athlete or an athlete destined to die at a young age due to poor diet, stresses, etc. Moreover, in experiments comparing CR to exercise, CR animals lived much longer than exercised animals.<ref>Washington University School of Medicine.

===Does calorie restriction only benefit the young?===
There is some evidence suggesting that the benefit of CR in rats might only be reaped in early years. A study on rats that were gradually introduced to a CR lifestyle at 18 months showed no improvement over the average life span of the [[ad libitum]] group.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lipman |first1=RD |last2=Smith |first2=DE |last3=Bronson |first3=RT |last4=Blumberg |first4=J |title=Is late-life caloric restriction beneficial? |journal=Aging (Milan, Italy) |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=136–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7548264}}</ref> This view, however, is disputed by Spindler, Dhahbi, and colleagues, who showed that in late adulthood, acute CR partially or completely reversed age-related alterations of liver, brain and heart proteins, and that mice placed on CR at 19 months of age showed increases in life span.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spindler |first1=S |title=Rapid and reversible induction of the longevity, anticancer and genomic effects of caloric restriction |journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development |volume=126 |issue=9 |pages=960–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15927235 |doi=10.1016/j.mad.2005.03.016}}</ref> The Wisconsin rhesus monkey study showed increased survival rates and decreased diseases of aging from caloric restriction even though the study started with adult monkeys.<ref name="sciencedaily.com"/>

===Possible contraindications===
Both animal and human research suggest that CR may be contraindicated for people with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS). Research on a [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic]] mouse model of ALS demonstrates that CR may hasten the onset of death in ALS. Hamadeh et al. therefore concluded, "These results suggest that CR diet is not a protective strategy for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hence is contraindicated."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hamadeh |first1=Mazen J. |last2=Rodriguez |first2=M.

However, in the first study, Slowie, Paige, and Antel state, "The reduction in energy intake by ALS patients did not correlate with the proximity of death but rather was a consistent aspect of the illness." They conclude, "ALS patients have a chronically deficient intake of energy and recommended augmentation of energy intake."<ref name="Pmid" />

Previously, Pedersen and Mattson also found that in the ALS mouse model, CR "accelerates the clinical course" of the disease and had no benefits.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(99)01471-7 |last1=Pedersen |first1=WA |last2=Mattson |first2=MP |title=No benefit of dietary restriction on disease onset or progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase mutant mice |journal=Brain Research |volume=833 |issue=1 |pages=117–20 |year=1999 |pmid=10375685}}</ref> Suggesting that a calorically dense diet may slow ALS, a [[ketogenic diet]] in the ALS mouse model has been shown to slow the progress of disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Zhong |last2=Lange |first2=Dale J |last3=Voustianiouk |first3=Andrei |last4=MacGrogan |first4=Donal |last5=Ho |first5=Lap |last6=Suh |first6=Jason |last7=Humala |first7=Nelson |last8=Thiyagarajan |first8=Meenakshisundaram |last9=Wang |first9=Jun |title=A ketogenic diet as a potential novel therapeutic intervention in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis |journal=BMC Neuroscience |volume=7 |page=29 |year=2006 |pmid=16584562 |pmc=1488864 |doi=10.1186/1471-2202-7-29 |laysource=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060417104324.htm}}</ref> More recently, Mattson et al. opine that the death by ALS of [[Roy Walford]], a pioneer in CR research and its antiaging effects, may have been a result of his own practice of CR.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1385/NMM:9:1:17 |last1=Mattson |first1=MP |last2=Cutler |first2=RG |last3=Camandola |first3=S |title=Energy intake and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis |journal=Neuromolecular medicine |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=17–20 |year=2007 |pmid=17114821}}</ref> However, as Mattson et al. acknowledge, Walford's single case is an [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdote]] that by itself is insufficient to establish the proposed cause-effect relation.

===Negligible effect on larger organisms===
Another objection to CR as an advisable lifestyle for humans is the claim that the physiological mechanisms that determine longevity are very complex, and that the effect would be small to negligible in our species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phelan |first1=J |last2=Rose |first2=M |title=Why dietary restriction substantially increases longevity in animal models but won't in humans |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=339–50 |year=2005 |pmid=16046282 |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2005.06.001}}</ref>

Studies by Dr. Mark P. Mattson, chief of the [[National Institute on Aging]]'s (NIA) Laboratory of Neurosciences, and colleagues have found that [[intermittent fasting]] and calorie restriction affect the progression of diseases similar to [[Huntington's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]] in mice (PMID 11119686). In one study, rats and mice ate a low-calorie diet or were deprived of food for 24 hours every other day.<ref name="Anson2003">{{cite journal |last1=Anson |first1=R.

Researchers have long been aware that calorie restriction extends life span, but this study showed that improved glucose metabolism also protects [[neurons]] in experimental models of Parkinson's and [[stroke]]. <!-- The foregoing is unclear. Were the fasting mice on a CR diet too as they lacked 50% of their food, or were they fed double on the eating-days? -->

Another NIA study found that intermittent fasting and calorie restriction delay the onset of Huntington's disease–like symptoms in mice and prolongs their lives.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=W. |last2=Guo |first2=Z |last3=Jiang |first3=H |last4=Ware |first4=M |last5=Li |first5=XJ |last6=Mattson |first6=MP |title=Dietary restriction normalizes glucose metabolism and BDNF levels, slows disease progression, and increases survival in huntingtin mutant mice |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=2911–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12589027 |pmc=151440 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0536856100|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2911D }}</ref> Huntington's disease (HD), a [[genetic disorder]], results from neuronal degeneration in the [[striatum]]. This neurodegeneration results in difficulties with movements that include walking, speaking, eating, and swallowing. People with Huntington's also exhibit an abnormal, diabetes-like metabolism that causes them to lose weight progressively.

This NIA study compared adult HD mice who ate as much as they wanted with HD mice who were kept on an intermittent fasting diet during adulthood. HD mice possess the abnormal human gene huntingtin and exhibit clinical signs of the disease, including abnormal metabolism and neurodegeneration in the striatum. The mice on the fasting program developed clinical signs of the disease about 12 days later and lived 10–15% longer than the free-fed mice. The brains of the fasting mice also showed less degeneration. Those on the fasting program also regulated their glucose levels better and did not lose weight as quickly as the other mice. Researchers found that fasting mice had higher [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) levels. BDNF protects neurons and stimulates their growth. Fasting mice also had high levels of heat-shock protein-70 ([[Hsp70]]), which increases cellular resistance to stress.

Another NIA study compared intermittent fasting with cutting caloric intake. Researchers let a control group of mice eat freely (ad libitum). Another group was fed 60% of the calories that the control group consumed. A third group was fasted for 24 hours, then permitted to free-feed. The fasting mice did not cut total calories at the beginning and end of the observation period, and only slightly cut calories in between. A fourth group was fed the average daily intake of the fasting mice every day. Both the fasting mice and those on a restricted diet had significantly lower blood sugar and insulin levels than the free-fed controls. [[Kainic acid]], a toxin that damages [[neuron]]s, was injected into the dorsal [[hippocampus]] of all mice. Hippocampal damage is associated with Alzheimer's. Interestingly, the scientists found less damage in the brains of the fasting mice than in those on a restricted diet, and most damage in mice with an unrestricted diet. But the control group that ate the average daily intake of the fasting mice (~10% restriction) also showed less damage than the mice on the restricted diet.<ref name="Anson2003" />
