'''Chloroethane''' or '''monochloroethane''', commonly known by its old name '''ethyl chloride''', is a [[chemical compound]] with [[chemical formula]] {{chem|C|2|H|5|Cl}}, once widely used in producing [[tetraethyllead]], a [[gasoline]] additive.  It is a colorless, flammable gas or refrigerated liquid with a faintly sweet odor.

==Production==
Ethyl chloride is produced by [[hydrochlorination]] of [[ethylene]]:
:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + HCl → C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl

At various times in the past, ethyl chloride has also been produced from [[ethanol]] and [[hydrochloric acid]], or from [[ethane]] and [[chlorine]], but these routes are no longer economical.  Some ethyl chloride is generated as a byproduct of [[polyvinyl chloride]] production.  Should demand for ethyl chloride continue to fall to the point where making it for its own sake is not economical, this may become the leading source of the chemical.

==Uses==
Beginning in 1922 and continuing through most of the 20th century, the major use of ethyl chloride was to produce [[tetraethyllead]] (TEL), an [[anti-knock additive]] for [[gasoline]]. TEL has been or is being phased out in most of the industrialized world, and the demand for ethyl chloride has fallen sharply. It also reacts with [[aluminium]] metal to give [[ethylaluminium sesquichloride]], a precursor to polymers and other useful [[organoaluminium compound]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>Krause, M.J., Orlandi, F., Saurage, A.T., Zietz Jr., J.R. Aluminum Compounds. ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''. 2000. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a01_543}}</ref>

Like other chlorinated [[hydrocarbon]]s, ethyl chloride has been used as a [[refrigeration|refrigerant]], an [[aerosol spray#Propellant|aerosol spray propellant]], an [[anesthetic]], and a [[blowing agent]] for foam packaging. For a time it was used as a promoter chemical in the aluminium chloride catalyzed process to produce [[ethylbenzene]], the precursor for [[styrene]] monomer. At present though, it is not widely used in any of these roles.

The only remaining industrially important use of ethyl chloride is in treating [[cellulose]] to make [[ethylcellulose]], a thickening agent and binder in [[paint]]s, [[cosmetics]], and similar products.

Ethyl chloride is supplied as a liquid in a spray bottle propelled by its own vapor pressure. It acts as a mild topical anesthetic by its chilling effect when sprayed on skin, such as when removing splinters in a clinical setting. The heat absorbed by the boiling liquid on tissues produces a deep and rapid chill, but since the boiling point is well above the freezing point of water, it presents no danger of frostbite. The vapor is flammable and narcotic, which requires care.

Ethyl chloride is a recreational inhalant drug, sometimes referred to as "Duster". Similar to [[Nitrite inhalants|poppers]], ethyl chloride is used as an inhalant (huffed) during sexual activity. In [[Brazil]], it is a traditional (though illegal) drug taken during [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnaval]] parades, known as "lança-perfume".<ref >[http://miss-warina.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/326/211549 1904 Brazilian advertisement]</ref>

In dentistry, ethyl chloride is used as one of the means of diagnosing a 'dead tooth', i.e. one in which the pulp has died. A small amount of the substance is placed on the suspect tooth using a cotton wad. Ethyl chloride's low boiling point creates a localised chilling effect. If the tooth is still alive this should be sensed by the patient as mild discomfort that subsides when the wad is removed.

==Safety==
Ethyl chloride is the least toxic of the chloroethanes. Like other chlorinated hydrocarbons, it is a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]], albeit a less potent one than many similar compounds. People breathing its vapors at less than 1% concentration in air usually experience no symptoms. At higher concentrations, victims usually exhibit symptoms similar to those of [[alcohol intoxication]].  Breathing its vapors at 15% or higher is often fatal.

Studies on the effects of chronic ethyl chloride exposure in animals have given inconsistent results, and no data exists for its long-term effects on humans.  Some studies have reported that prolonged exposure can produce [[liver]] or [[kidney]] damage, or [[uterus|uterine]] [[cancer]] in mice, but these data have been difficult to reproduce.

Chloroethane is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).<ref>[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol71/mono71-81.pdf Chloroethane], IARC</ref>

Recent information suggests carcinogenic potential; it has been designated as ACGIH category A3, ''Confirmed Animal Carcinogen with Unknown Relevance to Humans''. As a result, the State of California has incorporated it into [[Proposition 65]] as a known carcinogen. Nonetheless, it is still used in medicine as a [[local anesthetic]].
