'''Intermittent pneumatic compression''' is a therapeutic technique used in medical devices that include an air pump and inflatable auxiliary sleeves, gloves or boots in a system designed to improve venous circulation in the limbs of patients who suffer [[edema]] or the risk of [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gould MK, Garcia DA, Wren SM, Karanicolas PJ, Arcelus JI, Heit JA, Samama CM |year=2012 |title=Prevention of VTE in Nonorthopedic Surgical Patients: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines |journal=Chest |volume=141 |issue=2 suppl |pages=e227S-e277S |doi=10.1378/chest.11-2297 |pmid= 22315263}}</ref>

In use, an inflatable jacket (sleeve, glove or boot) encloses the limb requiring treatment, and pressure lines are connected between the jacket and the air pump. When activated, the pump fills the air chambers of the jacket in order to  pressurize the tissues in the limb, thereby forcing fluids, such as blood and lymph, out of the pressurized area. A short time later, the pressure is reduced, allowing increased blood flow back into the limb. 

The devices can be categorized as either uniform pressure or [[sequential compression device]], depending on how the pressure in the inflatable jacket is modulated.
