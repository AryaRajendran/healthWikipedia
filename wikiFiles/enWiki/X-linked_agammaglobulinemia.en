'''X-linked agammaglobulinaemia''' (also called '''X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia,''' '''XLA''', '''Bruton type agammaglobulinaemia''', Bruton syndrome, or Sex-linked agammaglobulinaemia<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|83}}) is a rare [[X-linked]] genetic disorder discovered in 1952 that affects the body's ability to fight infection. XLA is an [[X-linked]] disorder, and therefore is much more common in males. XLA patients do not generate mature [[B cell]]s,<ref name="titleX-linked Agammaglobulinemia: Immunodeficiency Disorders: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec13/ch164/ch164o.html |title=X-linked Agammaglobulinemia: Immunodeficiency Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |accessdate=2008-03-01 |work=}}</ref> which manifests as a complete lack of antibodies in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (called [[immunoglobulin]]s), which defend the body from infections by sustaining an immunological [[humoral]] antibody response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections. A mutation occurs at the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the pre-B to immature B cell stage) and a reduced [[Immunoglobulin]] (antibody) production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptor [[B cell receptor|BCR]]. Patients typically present in early childhood with recurrent [[infection]]s, in particular with extracellular, encapsulated [[bacteria]].<ref name=IDF/> It occurs in a frequency of about 1 in 100,000<ref>{{cite book|last=Mahmoudi|first=Massoud|title=Allergy and Asthma: Practical Diagnosis and Management|year=2007|isbn=978-0-07-147173-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Iq2Pkubq2A0C&pg=PA267&dq=X-linked+agammaglobulinemia+100,000|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional}}</ref> male newborns, and has no ethnic [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition]]. XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody.  Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of [[B cell]]s, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the [[passive immunity]] granted by the exogenous antibodies.<ref name= IDF>[http://www.immunedisease.com/US/patients/IDF/agamma.html X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia] Patient and Family Handbook for The Primary Immune Diseases.

XLA is caused by a mutation on the [[X chromosome]] of a single [[gene]] identified in 1993 which produces an enzyme known as [[Bruton's tyrosine kinase]], or Btk.<ref name=IDF/> XLA was first characterized by Dr. [[Ogden Bruton]] in a ground-breaking research paper published in 1952 describing a boy unable to develop immunities to common childhood diseases and infections.<ref name= BrutonsPaper>{{cite journal |author=Bruton OC |title=Agammaglobulinemia |journal=Pediatrics |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=722–8 |year=1952 |pmid=14929630 |doi=}}. Reproduced in {{cite journal |author=Buckley CR |title=Agammaglobulinemia, by Col. Ogden C. Bruton, MC, USA, Pediatrics, 1952;9:722-728 |journal=Pediatrics |volume=102 |issue=1 Pt 2 |pages=213–5 |year=1998 |pmid=9651432 |doi=}}</ref> It is the first known [[immune deficiency]], and is classified with other inherited (genetic) defects of the [[immune system]], known as [[primary immunodeficiency]] disorders.

==Genetics==
The Btk enzyme plays an essential role in the maturation of [[B cell]]s in the [[bone marrow]], and when mutated, immature pre-B lymphocytes are unable to develop into mature B cells that leave the bone marrow into the blood stream.  The disorder is X-linked (it is on the [[X chromosome]]), and is almost entirely limited to the sons of [[Symptom#Types|asymptomatic]] female [[Genetic carrier|carrier]]s.<ref name= IDF/>  This is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome, while females have two copies; one normal copy of an X chromosome can compensate for mutations in the other X chromosome, so they are less likely to be symptomatic.  If a carrier female gives birth to a male child, there is a 50% chance that the male will have XLA. A carrier female has a 25% chance overall of giving birth to an affected male child.

An XLA patient will pass on the gene, and all of his daughters will be XLA carriers, meaning that any male grandchildren from an XLA patient's daughters have a 50% chance of inheriting XLA. A female XLA patient can arise only as the child of an XLA patient and a carrier mother. XLA can also rarely result from a spontaneous mutation in the [[fetus]] of a non-carrier mother.

==Diagnosis==
XLA diagnosis usually begins due to a history of recurrent infections, mostly in the [[respiratory tract]], through childhood. The diagnosis is probable when blood tests show the complete lack of circulating B cells (determined by the B cell marker [[CD19]] and/or [[CD20]]), as well as low levels of all [[antibody]] classes, including [[IgG]], [[IgA]], [[IgM]], [[IgE]] and [[IgD]].<ref name= IDF/>

When XLA is suspected, it is possible to do a [[Western Blot]] test to determine whether the Btk protein is being expressed. Results of a genetic blood test confirm the diagnosis and will identify the specific Btk mutation,<ref name= IDF/> however its cost prohibits its use in routine screening for all pregnancies. Women with an XLA patient in their family should seek genetic counseling before pregnancy.

Although the symptoms of a XLA and other primary immune diseases (PID) include repeated and often severe infections, the average time for a diagnosis of a PID can be up to 10 years.

==Treatment==
The most common treatment for XLA is an [[intravenous]] infusion of [[immunoglobulin]] ([[IVIg]], human IgG antibodies) every 3–4 weeks, for life. IVIg is a human product extracted and pooled from thousands of [[blood]] donations. IVIg does not cure XLA but increases the patient's lifespan and quality of life, by generating [[passive immunity]], and boosting the [[immune system]].<ref name= IDF/> With treatment, the number and severity of infections is reduced.  With IVIg, XLA patients may live a relatively healthy life. A patient should attempt reaching a state where his [[IgG]] blood count exceeds 800&nbsp;mg/kg. The dose is based on the patient's weight and IgG blood-count.

Muscle injections of immunoglobulin (IMIg) were common before IVIg was prevalent, but are less effective and much more painful; hence, IMIg is now uncommon.

[[Injection (medicine)|Subcutaneous]] treatment (SCIg) was recently approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which is recommended in cases of severe adverse reactions to the IVIg treatment.

[[Antibiotics]] are another common supplementary treatment. Local antibiotic treatment (drops, lotions) are preferred over systemic treatment (pills) for long-term treatment, if possible.

One of the future prospects of XLA treatment is [[gene therapy]], which could potentially cure XLA. Gene therapy technology is still in its infancy and may cause severe complications such as cancer and even death. Moreover, the long-term success and complications of this treatment are, as yet, unknown.

==Other considerations==
[[Serology]] (detection on antibodies to a specific [[pathogens|pathogen]] or [[antigen]]) is often used to diagnose viral diseases. Because XLA patients lack antibodies, these tests always give a negative result regardless of their real condition. This applies to standard [[HIV]] tests. Special blood tests (such as the [[western blot]] based test) are required for proper viral diagnosis in XLA patients.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

It is not recommended and dangerous for XLA patients to receive live attenuated [[vaccines]] such as live [[polio vaccine|polio]], or the [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]] ([[MMR vaccine]]).<ref name= IDF/> Special emphasis is given to avoiding the oral live attenuated [[Polio#Sabin.27s_.22oral_polio_vaccine.22|SABIN-type polio vaccine]] that has been reported to cause polio to XLA patients. Furthermore, it is not known if active [[vaccines]] in general have any beneficial effect on XLA patients as they lack normal ability to maintain [[immune memory]].

XLA patients are specifically susceptible to viruses of the [[Enterovirus]] family, and mostly to: [[polio virus]], [[coxsackie virus]] (hand, foot, and mouth disease) and  [[Echovirus]]es. These may cause severe [[central nervous system]] conditions as chronic [[encephalitis]], [[meningitis]] and death. An experimental anti-viral agent, [[pleconaril]], is active against [[picornaviruses]]. XLA patients, however, are apparently immune to the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV), as they lack mature [[B cells]] (and so HLA co-receptors) needed for the viral infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Faulkner GC, Burrows SR, Khanna R, Moss DJ, Bird AG, Crawford DH |title=X-Linked agammaglobulinemia patients are not infected with Epstein-Barr virus: implications for the biology of the virus |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=1555–64 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=9882361 |pmc=103980 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

It is not known if XLA patients are able to generate an [[allergic reaction]], as they lack functional [[IgE]] antibodies.

There is no special hazard for XLA patients in dealing with pets or outdoor activities.<ref name= IDF/>

Unlike in other primary [[immunodeficiencies]] XLA patients are at no greater risk for developing [[autoimmune]] illnesses.

Agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is similar to the primary immunodeficiency disorder [[Hypogammaglobulinemia]] ([[CVID]]), and their clinical conditions and treatment are almost identical. However, while XLA is a congenital disorder, with known genetic causes, CVID may occur in adulthood and its causes are not yet understood.
XLA was also historically mistaken as [[Severe Combined Immunodeficiency]] (SCID), a much more severe immune deficiency ("Bubble boys").

A strain of [[laboratory mouse]], XID, is used to study XLA. These mice have a mutated version of the mouse Btk gene, and exhibit a similar, yet milder, immune deficiency as in XLA.
