An '''autoclave''' is a device used to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] equipment and supplies by subjecting them to high pressure saturated steam at 121&nbsp;°C for around  15–20 minutes depending on the size of the load and the contents.<ref>Microbiology, Jacquelyn Black, Prentice Hall,1993 pg 334</ref> It was invented by [[Charles Chamberland]] in 1879,<ref name=Ref1>{{cite web |url=http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/archives/chb0.html |title=Chronological reference marks - Charles Chamberland (1851–1908)  |accessdate=2007-01-19 |last=|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=|month=|work= |publisher=Pasteur Institute |pages= |language= |quote= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061219210855/http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/archives/chb0.html| archivedate= 19 December 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> although a precursor known as the [[steam digester]] was created by [[Denis Papin]] in 1679.<ref name="Hugo 1991">{{cite journal |author=Hugo WB |title=A brief history of heat and chemical preservation and disinfection |journal=J.

== Uses ==
Autoclaves are widely used in [[microbiology]], [[medicine]], [[tattooing]], [[body piercing]], [[veterinary science]], [[mycology]], [[dentistry]], [[chiropody]] and [[prosthetics]] fabrication. They vary in size and function depending on the media to be sterilized. 

Typical loads include laboratory glassware, other equipment and waste, surgical instruments and [[medical waste]].<ref name="Sterilization Cycles">{{cite web |url=http://consteril.com/index.php?pg=41 |title=Sterilization Cycles |publisher=Consolidated Machine Corporation |date= |accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref>

A notable growing application of autoclaves is the pre-disposal treatment and sterilization of waste material, such as pathogenic hospital waste.  Machines in this category largely operate under the same principles as conventional autoclaves in that they are able to neutralize potentially infectious agents by utilizing pressurized steam and superheated water. A new generation of waste converters is capable of achieving the same effect without a pressure vessel to sterilize culture media, rubber material, gowns, dressing, gloves, etc. It is particularly useful for materials which cannot withstand the higher temperature of a hot air oven.<ref name="Block2001">{{cite book|author=Seymour Stanton Block|title=Disinfection, Sterilization, and Preservation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3f-kPJ17_TYC&pg=PA1052|accessdate=19 January 2013|year=2001|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-683-30740-5|pages=}}</ref>

Autoclaves are also widely used to cure composites and in the vulcanization of rubber.<ref name="Simpson2002">{{cite book|author=R. B. Simpson|title=Rubber Basics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sp0UpURKUV8C&pg=PA161|accessdate=19 January 2013|date=28 February 2002|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|isbn=978-1-85957-307-5|pages=161}}</ref> The high heat and pressure that autoclaves allow help to ensure that the best possible physical properties are repeatably attainable. The aerospace industry and sparmakers (for sailboats in particular) have autoclaves well over {{convert|50|ft|m}} long, some over {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Air removal ==
It is very important to ensure that all of the trapped air is removed from the autoclave before activation, as hot air is a very poor medium for achieving sterility. Steam at 134&nbsp;°C can achieve in three minutes the same sterility that hot air at 160&nbsp;°C takes two hours to achieve.<ref>AS NZS 4815-2006 P33&P35</ref> Methods of achieving air removal include:

'''Downward displacement''' (or '''gravity-type'''): As steam enters the chamber, it fills the upper areas first as it is less dense than air. This compresses the air to the bottom, forcing it out through a drain which often contains a temperature-sensing device. Only when air evacuation is complete does the discharge stop. Flow is usually controlled by a steam trap or a [[solenoid]] valve, but bleed holes are sometimes used, often in conjunction with a solenoid valve. As the steam and air mix it is also possible to force out the mixture from locations in the chamber other than the bottom.

'''Steam pulsing''': air dilution by using a series of steam pulses, in which the chamber is alternately pressurized and then depressurized to near atmospheric pressure.

'''Vacuum pumps''': a vacuum pump sucks air or air/steam mixtures from the chamber.

'''Superatmospheric cycles''': achieved with a vacuum pump. It starts with a vacuum followed by a steam pulse followed by a vacuum followed by a steam pulse. The number of pulses depends on the particular autoclave and cycle chosen.

'''Subatmospheric cycles''': similar to the superatmospheric cycles, but chamber pressure never exceeds atmospheric pressure until they pressurize up to the sterilizing temperature.

== Autoclaves in medicine ==
A medical autoclave is a device that uses [[steam]] to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] equipment and other objects. This means that all [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], and [[spore]]s are inactivated. However, [[prion]]s, such as those associated with [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]], may not be destroyed by autoclaving at the typical 134 °C for three minutes or 121 °C for 15 minutes{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. Also, some recently discovered organisms, such as [[Strain 121]] microbes, can survive at temperatures above 121 °C.

Autoclaves are found in many medical settings, laboratories, and other places that need to ensure the sterility of an object. Many procedures today employ single-use items rather than sterilizable, reusable items.  This first happened with [[hypodermic needles]], but today many [[surgical instruments]] (such as [[forceps]], [[hypodermic needle|needle]] holders, and [[scalpel]] handles) are commonly single-use rather than reusable items (see [[waste autoclave]]).

Because [[humidity|damp]] heat is used, [[lability|heat-labile]] products (such as some [[plastics]]) cannot be sterilized this way or they will melt. [[Paper]] and other products that may be damaged by steam must also be sterilized another way. In all autoclaves, items should always be separated to allow the steam to penetrate the load evenly.

Autoclaving is often used to sterilize medical waste prior to disposal in the standard [[municipal solid waste]] stream. This application has become more common as an alternative to [[incineration]] due to environmental and health concerns raised because of the combustion by-products emitted by incinerators, especially from the small units which were commonly operated at individual hospitals. Incineration or a similar thermal oxidation process is still generally mandated for pathological waste and other very toxic and/or infectious medical waste.

==Autoclave quality assurance==
[[Image:Sterilization bag indicator mark.jpg|thumb|[[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] bags often have a "sterilization indicator mark" that typically darkens when the bag and its contents have been adequately processed. Comparing the marks on an unprocessed bag (L) and on a bag that has been properly cycled (R) will reveal an obvious visual difference.]]

There are [[physics|physical]], [[chemistry|chemical]], and [[biology|biological]] [[pH indicator|indicators]] that can be used to ensure that an autoclave reaches the correct [[temperature]] for the correct amount of [[time]].

[[Chemical indicator]]s  on [[medical]] [[packaging]] and [[autoclave tape]] change [[color]] once the correct conditions have been met, indicating that the object inside the package, or under the tape, has been appropriately processed. Biological indicators contain [[spores]] of a heat-resistant bacterium, ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]''. If the autoclave does not reach the right temperature, the spores will [[germination|germinate]] when incubated and their [[metabolism]] will change the color of a [[pH]]-sensitive chemical. Some physical indicators consist of an [[alloy]] designed to melt only after being subjected to a given temperature for the relevant holding time. If the alloy melts, the change will be visible.

Some computer-controlled autoclaves use an F<sub>0</sub> (F-nought) value to control the [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] cycle. F<sub>0</sub> values are set for the number of minutes of sterilization equivalent to {{convert|121|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} above atmospheric pressure for 15 minutes . Since exact temperature control is difficult, the temperature is monitored, and the sterilization time adjusted accordingly.
