'''Tropical diseases''' are [[Infectious disease|disease]]s that are prevalent in or unique to [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions.  The diseases are less prevalent in [[temperate climate]]s, due in part to the occurrence of a cold [[season]], which controls the insect population by forcing hibernation.<ref>"[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]" by Jared Diamond</ref>  Insects such as mosquitoes and flies are by far the most common disease carrier, or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].  These insects may carry a parasite, bacterium or virus that is infectious to humans and animals.  Most often disease is transmitted by an insect "bite", which causes transmission of the infectious agent through subcutaneous blood exchange.  Vaccines are not available for any of the diseases listed here, and many do not have cures.<ref>See the Wikipedia articles for the respective diseases</ref>

Human exploration of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[deforestation]], rising [[immigration]] and increased international air travel and other [[tourism]] to tropical regions has led to an increased incidence of such diseases.<ref name="npr.org">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962 Deforestation Boosts Malaria Rates, Study Finds]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm UK 'faces tropical disease threat'], BBC News</ref>

==Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR)==
In 1975 the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) was established to focus on [[Neglected diseases|neglected infectious diseases]] which disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations in developing regions of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. It was established at the [[World Health Organization]], which is the executing agency, and is co-sponsored by the [http://www.unicef.org United Nations Children's Fund], [[United Nations Development Programme]], the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]].  

TDR's vision is to foster an effective global research effort on infectious diseases of poverty in which disease endemic countries play a pivotal role. It has a dual mission of developing new tools and strategies against these diseases, and to develop the research and leadership capacity in the countries where the diseases occur. The TDR secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, but the work is conducted throughout the world through many partners and funded grants. 

Some examples of work include helping to develop new treatments for diseases, such as ivermectin for onchocerciasis (river blindness); showing how packaging can improve use of artemesinin-combination treatment (ACT) for malaria; demonstrating the effectiveness of bednets to prevent mosquito bites and malaria; and documenting how community-based and community-led programmes increases distribution of multiple treatments.

The current TDR disease portfolio includes the following entries:<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/tdr/diseases/default.htm |title= Disease portfolio |accessdate=2009-08-01 |work= Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases}}</ref>

* [[Chagas disease]]
*: (also called ''American trypanosomiasis'') is a [[parasitic disease]] which occurs in the [[Americas]], particularly in [[South America]]. Its [[pathogen]]ic agent is a [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n named ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', which is [[Vector (epidemiology)|transmitted]] mostly by [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] '''[[assassin bug]]s''', however other methods of transmission are possible, such as ingestion of food contaminated with [[parasite]]s, [[blood transfusion]] and [[fetus|fetal]] transmission. Between 16 and 18 million people are currently infected.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm Chagas Disease After Organ Transplantation --- United States, 2001]</ref>
* [[Dengue]]
* [[Helminths]]
* [[African trypanosomiasis]]
*: or '''sleeping sickness''', is a [[parasitic]] [[disease]], caused by protozoa called trypansomes. The two responsible for African trypanosomiasis are Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.These parasites are transmitted by the '''[[tsetse fly]]'''
* [[Leishmaniasis]]
*: caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s of the genus Leishmania, and transmitted by the bite of certain species of '''[[sand fly]]'''.
* [[Leprosy]]<sup>†</sup>
*: (or '''Hansen's disease''') is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[infectious disease]] caused by [[Mycobacterium leprae]].  Leprosy is primarily a [[granuloma]]tous disease of the [[peripheral nerves]] and [[mucosa]] of the [[upper respiratory tract]]; skin lesions are the primary external symptom.<ref name= Sherris>Kenneth J. Ryan and C. George Ray, Sherris Medical Microbiology Fourth Edition McGraw Hill 2004.</ref> Left untreated, leprosy can be progressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes.  Contrary to popular conception, leprosy does not cause body parts to simply fall off, and it differs from [[tzaraath]], the malady described in the Hebrew scriptures and previously translated into English as ''leprosy''.<ref>Leviticus 13:59, Artscroll Tanakh and Metsudah Chumash translations, 1996 and 1994, respectively.</ref>
* [[Filariasis|Lymphatic filariasis]]
*: is a [[parasite|parasitic]] disease caused by thread-like parasitic filarial worms called [[nematode worm]]s, all transmitted by '''[[mosquito]]es'''.  [[Loa loa]] is another filarial parasite transmitted by the [[deer fly]].  120 million people are infected worldwide.  It is carried by over half the population in the most severe endemic areas.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Aupali T, Ismid IS, Wibowo H, ''et al.'' | title=Estimation of the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis by a pool screen PCR assay using blood spots collected on filter paper | journal=Tran R Soc Trop Med Hyg | year=2006 | volume=100 | issue=8 | pages=753&ndash;9 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.10.005 | pmid=16442578 | month=Aug | last1=Supali | first1=T | last2=Ismid | first2=IS | last3=Wibowo | first3=H | last4=Djuardi | first4=Y | last5=Majawati | first5=E | last6=Ginanjar | first6=P | last7=Fischer | first7=P | issn=0035-9203 }}</ref> The most noticeable symptom is [[elephantiasis]]: a thickening of the skin and underlying tissues. Elephantiasis is caused by chronic infection by filarial worms in the lymph nodes. This clogs the lymph nodes and slows the draining of lymph fluid from a portion of the body.
* [[Malaria]]
*: Caused by a [[Protozoan]] [[parasite]]s transmitted by female ''[[Anopheles]]'' [[mosquito]]es, as they are the blood-feeders. The disease is caused by species of the genus Plasmodium. Malaria infected an estimated 190-311 million people in 2008 and 708,000-1,003,000 died mostly in Sub-Sahara Africa.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/]</ref>
* [[Onchocerciasis]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɒ|ŋ|k|oʊ|s|ɜr|ˈ|s|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɪ|s}})
*: or '''river blindness''' is the world's second leading [[infection|infectious]] cause of [[blindness]]. It is caused by ''Onchocerca volvulus'', a [[parasitic worm]].<ref>http://www.worldbank.org/afr/gper/disease.htm The World Bank | Global Partnership to Eliminate Riverblindness. Accessed November 04, 2007.</ref>  It is transmitted through the bite of a black fly.  The worms spread throughout the body, and when they die, they cause intense itching and a strong immune system response that can destroy nearby tissue, such as the eye.<ref name="titleCauses of river blindness">{{cite web |url=http://www.sightsavers.org/What%20We%20Do/Eye%20Conditions/River%20Blindness/World1629.html |title=Causes of river blindness |accessdate=2008-01-28 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071229011345/http://www.sightsavers.org/What+We+Do/Eye+Conditions/River+Blindness/World1629.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-29}}</ref>  About 18 million people are currently infected with this parasite.

* [[Schistosomiasis]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|ʃ|ɪ|s|t|oʊ|s|ɵ|ˈ|m|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɪ|s}})
*: also known as ''schisto'' or '''snail fever''', is a [[parasitic disease]] caused by several species of '''[[flatworm]]''' in areas with freshwater '''[[snail]]s''', which may carry the parasite.  The most common form of transmission is by wading or swimming in lakes, ponds and other bodies of water containing the [[snail]]s and the parasite. More than 200 million people worldwide are infected by schistosomiasis.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs115/en/index.html WHO | Schistosomiasis]</ref>
* [[Sexually transmitted infections]]
* [[TB/HIV coinfection]]
* [[Tuberculosis]]<sup>†</sup>
*: (abbreviated as '''TB'''), is a bacterial infection of the lungs or other tissues, which is highly prevalent in the world, with mortality over 50% if untreated.  It is a [[communicable disease]], transmitted by [[particulate|aerosol]] expectorant from a cough, sneeze, speak, kiss, or spit. Over one-third of the [[World population|world's population]] has been infected by the TB bacterium.<ref name="WHO2004data">[[World Health Organization]] (WHO).

Some tropical diseases are very rare, but may occur in sudden [[epidemic]]s, such as the [[Ebola]] hemorrhagic fever, [[Lassa fever]] and the [[Marburg virus]].  There are hundreds of different tropical diseases which are less known or rarer, but that, nonetheless, have importance for [[public health]].

==Relation of climate to tropical diseases==
The so-called "exotic" diseases in the tropics have long been noted both by travelers, explorers, etc., as well as by physicians. One obvious reason is that the hot climate present during all the year and the larger volume of [[rain]]s directly affect the formation of breeding grounds, the larger number and variety of [[natural reservoir]]s and animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans ([[zoonosis]]), the largest number of possible [[insect]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of diseases. It is possible also that higher temperatures may favor the replication of pathogenic agents both inside and outside biological organisms. Socio-economic factors may be also in operation, since most of the poorest nations of the world are in the tropics. Tropical countries like [[Brazil]], which have improved their socio-economic situation and invested in [[hygiene]], [[public health]] and the combat of transmissible diseases have achieved dramatic results in relation to the elimination or decrease of many [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] tropical diseases in their territory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} 

[[Climate change]], [[global warming]] caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], and the resulting increase in global [[temperature]]s, are possibly causing tropical diseases and vectors to spread to higher altitudes in mountainous regions, and to higher latitudes that were previously spared, such as the [[Southern United States]], the Mediterranean area, etc.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange Climate change brings malaria back to Italy] ''The Guardian'' 6 January 2007</ref><ref>BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm Climate link to African malaria] 20 March 2006</ref>  For example, in the Monteverde cloud forest of Costa Rica, global warming enabled Chytridiomycosis, a tropical disease, to flourish and thus force into decline amphibian populations of the Monteverde Harlequin frog.<ref>Pounds, J. Alan et al.  "Widespread Amphibian Extinctions from Epidemic Deisease Driven by Global Warming."  Nature 439.12 (2006) 161-67</ref>  Here, global warming raised the heights of orographic cloud formation, and thus produced cloud cover that would facilitate optimum growth conditions for the implicated pathogen, B. dendrobatidis.

==Prevention and treatment of tropical diseases==
Some of the strategies for controlling tropical diseases include: 
* Draining wetlands to reduce populations of [[insect]]s and other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s.
* The application of [[insecticide]]s and/or [[insect repellent]]s) to strategic surfaces such as: clothing, skin, buildings, insect habitats, and [[bed net]]s.
* The use of a [[mosquito net]] over a bed (also known as a "bed net") to reduce nighttime transmission, since certain species of tropical [[mosquito]]es feed mainly at night.
* Use of water [[Water well|well]]s, and/or [[water filtration]], [[water filter]]s, or [[water treatment]] with water tablets to produce drinking water free of parasites.
* [[Sanitation]] to prevent transmission through human waste
* Development and use of [[vaccine]]s to promote disease [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].
* Pharmacologic pre-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease before exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic post-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease after exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic treatment (to treat disease after infection or infestation).
* Assisting with economic development in endemic regions.  For example by providing [[microloan]]s to enable investments in more efficient and productive agriculture.  This in turn can help [[subsistence farming]] to become more profitable, and these profits can be used by local populations for disease prevention and treatment, with the added benefit of reducing the poverty rate.<ref>[[Jeffrey Sachs]]</ref>
