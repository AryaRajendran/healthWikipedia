'''Chronic neutrophilic leukemia''' (CNL) is a rare [[myeloproliferative]] disorder that features a persistent [[neutrophilia]] in peripheral blood, [[myeloid]] [[hyperplasia]] in [[bone marrow]], [[hepatosplenomegaly]], and the absence of the [[Philadelphia chromosome]] or a [[BCR/ABL]] fusion gene.<ref name="who1">{{cite book |author=Elaine Sarkin Jaffe, Nancy Lee Harris, World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Harald Stein, J.W. Vardiman |title=Pathology and genetics of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2001 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumors |volume=3 |isbn=92-832-2411-6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=XSKqcy7TUZUC}}</ref> 

==Epidemiology==
This is a rare disease, with less than 100 cases reported. Of these cases, an equal male:female ratio was observed,<ref name="you1">{{cite journal |author=You W, Weisbrot IM |title=Chronic neutrophilic leukemia. Report of two cases and review of the literature |journal=Am. J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=233–42 |year=1979 |month=August |pmid=289288 }}</ref>
with cases typically seen in older adults.<ref name="zit1">{{cite journal |author=Zittoun R, Réa D, Ngoc LH, Ramond S |title=Chronic neutrophilic leukemia. A study of four cases |journal=Ann.

==Clinical Features==
===Etiology===
The etiology of CNL is currently unknown. An association between CNL and [[multiple myeloma]] has been suggested based on the observation of myeloma in 20% of CNL cases.<ref name="sta1">{{cite journal |author=Standen GR, Steers FJ, Jones L |title=Clonality of chronic neutrophilic leukaemia associated with myeloma: analysis using the X-linked probe M27 beta |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=297–8 |year=1993 |month=April |pmid=8098719 |pmc=501206 |url=http://jcp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8098719 |doi=10.1136/jcp.46.4.297}}</ref>
However, a clonal genetic abnormality has not been detected in these myeloma-associated cases of CNL, raising the possibility that the [[neutrophilia]] is a reaction due to the neoplastic [[myeloma]] cells.<ref name="who1"/> The postulated cell of origin is a limited-potential, marrow-derived stem cell.<ref name="yan1">{{cite journal |author=Yanagisawa K, Ohminami H, Sato M, ''et al.'' |title=Neoplastic involvement of granulocytic lineage, not granulocytic-monocytic, monocytic, or erythrocytic lineage, in a patient with chronic neutrophilic leukemia |journal=Am. J. Hematol. |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=221–4 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9495373 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199803)57:3<221::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-X}}</ref>
 
===Clinical Presentation===
The most common clinical finding is [[hepatosplenomegaly]]. [[Pruritus]], [[gout]], and [[mucocutaneous bleeding]] are occasionally seen.<ref name="you1"/><ref name="zit1"/>

===Laboratory findings===
Peripheral blood [[neutrophilia]] (> 25 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) with [[myeloid]] precursors ([[promyelocyte]]s, [[myelocyte]]s, [[metamyelocyte]]s) comprising less than 5% of [[leukocytes]].<ref name="you1"/> <ref name="zit1"/>

===Sites of Involvement===
Peripheral [[blood]], [[bone marrow]], [[spleen]], and [[liver]] are most common, but any organ or tissue can be infiltrated by [[neutrophils]].<ref name="you1"/> 
<ref name="zit1"/>

==Morphology==
===Bone Marrow Biopsy===
On both the [[bone marrow]] aspirate and the core biopsy, a hypercellular marrow with an increased [[myeloid]]:[[erythroid]] ratio of 20:1 or greater. [[Myelocytes]] and [[neutrophils]] are increased, and [[blasts]] and [[promyelocytes]] are not increased. Due to the [[myeloproliferative]] nature of the disease, an increase in [[megakaryocytes]] and [[erythroid]] precursors may be observed, but [[dyspoiesis]] in not seen in any cell lineage. Also, [[reticulin]] [[fibrosis]] is rare.<ref name="you1"/><ref name="zit1"/> There is a reported association between CNL and [[multiple myeloma]], so the [[bone marrow]] biopsy may show evidence of a [[plasma cell]] [[dyscrasia]] with increased numbers of atypical [[plasma cells]].<ref name="who1"/>   

===Spleen===
[[Splenic]] infiltrates are typically found only in the [[red pulp]].<ref name="you1"/> 
<ref name="zit1"/>

===Liver===
[[Hepatic]] infiltrates can be found in either the [[sinusoids]], [[portal triad]] regions, or both.<ref name="you1"/> 
<ref name="zit1"/> 

==Molecular Findings==
===Immunophenotype===
No distinct immunophenotype abnormality for CNL has been described.<ref name="who1"/> 

===Genetics===
The majority (90%) of cases have not had detectable [[cytogenetic]] abnormalities. Most importantly, the [[Philadelphia chromosome]] and other [[BCR/ABL]] fusion genes are not detected.<ref name="who1"/>
