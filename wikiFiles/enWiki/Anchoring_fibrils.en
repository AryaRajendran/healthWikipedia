'''Anchoring fibrils''' (composed largely of type VII [[collagen]]) extend from the [[basal lamina]] of [[epithelial cells]] and attach to the lamina reticularis (also known as the [[reticular lamina]]) by wrapping around the reticular fiber ([[collagen III]]) bundles.  The basal lamina and lamina reticularis together make up the [[basement membrane]].  Anchoring fibrils are essential to the functional integrity of the dermoepidermal junction.

==Epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica==
[[Epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica]], also known as Dystrophic EB (DEB) is a chronic skin condition caused when anchoring fibrils are abnormal, diminished, or absent.  This causes a weak dermoepidermal junction, where the epidermis easily separates from the dermis causing much pain.  This condition is caused by a genetic defect coding for anchoring fibrils.
