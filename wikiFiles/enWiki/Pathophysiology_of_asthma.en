[[File:Asthma before-after-en.svg|thumb|300px|Inflamed airways and bronchoconstriction in asthma results in airways narrowing and thus [[wheezing]].]]
[[Asthma]] is an airway disease that can be classified [[Physiology|physiologically]] as a variable and partially reversible obstruction to air flow, and [[Pathology|pathologically]] with overdeveloped mucus glands, airway thickening due to scarring and inflammation, and [[bronchoconstriction]], the narrowing of the airways in the [[lung]]s due to the tightening of surrounding [[smooth muscle]]. Bronchial inflammation also causes narrowing due to [[edema]] and swelling caused by an [[immune system|immune response]] to allergens.

==Bronchoconstriction==
[[Image:Asthma .jpg|thumb|Obstruction of the lumen of the bronchiole by mucoid exudate, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial basement membrane thickening and severe inflammation of bronchiole.]]
During an asthma episode, inflamed [[bronchiole|airways]] react to environmental triggers such as smoke, dust, or pollen. The airways narrow and produce excess [[mucus]], making it difficult to breathe.
In essence, asthma is the result of an [[immune system|immune response]] in the [[bronchiole|bronchial]] airways.<ref name=Maddox>{{cite journal |author=Maddox L, Schwartz DA |title=The pathophysiology of asthma |journal=Annu. Rev. Med. |volume=53 |issue= |pages=477–98 |year=2002 |pmid=11818486 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.53.082901.103921}}</ref>

The airways of asthma patients are "[[hypersensitivity|hypersensitive]]" to certain triggers, also known as ''stimuli'' (see below). (It is usually classified as [[type I hypersensitivity]].)<ref name="urlLecture 14: Hypersensitivity">{{cite web |url=http://www-immuno.path.cam.ac.uk/~immuno/part1/lec13/lec13_97.html |title=Lecture 14: Hypersensitivity |work= |accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref><ref name="urlAllergy & Asthma Disease Management Center: Ask the Expert">{{cite web |url=http://www.aaaai.org/aadmc/ate/category.asp?cat=1008 |title=Allergy & Asthma Disease Management Center: Ask the Expert |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref> In response to exposure to these triggers, the [[bronchus|bronchi]] (large airways) contract into [[spasm]] (an "asthma attack"). [[Inflammation]] soon follows, leading to a further narrowing of the airways and excessive [[mucus]] production, which leads to coughing and other breathing difficulties. Bronchospasm may resolve spontaneously in 1–2 hours, or in about 50% of subjects, may become part of a 'late' response, where this initial insult is followed 3–12 hours later with further bronchoconstriction and inflammation.<ref name="Murray">Murray and Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, 4th Ed. Robert J. Mason, John F. Murray, Jay A. Nadel, 2005, Elsevier pp. 334</ref>

The normal caliber of the bronchus is maintained by a balanced functioning of these systems, which both operate reflexively. The [[parasympathetic]] reflex loop consists of afferent nerve endings which originate under the inner lining of the bronchus. Whenever these afferent nerve endings are stimulated (for example, by dust, cold air or fumes) impulses travel to the brain-stem vagal center, then down the vagal efferent pathway to again reach the bronchial small airways. Acetylcholine is released from the efferent nerve endings. This acetylcholine results in the excessive formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in bronchial smooth muscle cells which leads to muscle shortening and this initiates bronchoconstriction.

==Bronchial inflammation==
The mechanisms behind allergic asthma—i.e., asthma resulting from an [[immune system|immune response]] to inhaled [[allergen]]s—are the best understood of the causal factors. In both people with asthma and people who are free of the disease, inhaled allergens that find their way to the inner [[bronchiole|airways]] are [[phagocytosis|ingested]] by a type of cell known as [[antigen-presenting cell]]s, or APCs. APCs then "present" pieces of the allergen to other [[immune system]] cells. In most people, these other immune cells ([[T helper cell|T<sub>H</sub>0 cells]]) "check" and usually ignore the allergen molecules. In asthma patients, however, these cells [[Cellular differentiation|transform]] into a different type of cell (T<sub>H</sub>2), for reasons that are not well understood.

The resultant T<sub>H</sub>2 cells activate an important arm of the immune system, known as the [[humoral immunity|humoral immune system]]. The humoral immune system produces [[antibody|antibodies]] against the inhaled allergen. Later, when a patient inhales the same allergen, these antibodies "recognize" it and activate a [[humoral immunity|humoral response]]. Inflammation results: chemicals are produced that cause the wall of the airway to thicken, cells which produce scarring to proliferate and contribute to further 'airway remodeling', causes mucus producing cells to grow larger and produce more and thicker mucus, and the cell-mediated arm of the immune system is activated. Inflamed airways are more hyper-reactive, and will be more prone to bronchospasm.

The "[[hygiene hypothesis]]" postulates that an imbalance in the regulation of these T<sub>H</sub> cell types in early life leads to a long-term domination of the cells involved in allergic responses over those involved in fighting infection. The suggestion is that for a child being exposed to microbes early in life, taking fewer antibiotics, living in a large family, and growing up in the country stimulate the T<sub>H</sub>1 response and reduce the odds of developing asthma.<ref name="Tippets1">{{cite journal |author=Tippets B, Guilbert TW   |title=Managing Asthma in Children: Part 1: Making the Diagnosis, Assessing Severity |journal=Consultant for Pediatricians|volume=8 |issue=5 |year=2009 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/asthma/article/10162/1414747}}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
The fundamental problem in asthma appears to be [[immunology|immunological]]: young children in the early stages of asthma show signs of excessive inflammation in their airways. [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological findings]] give clues as to the [[pathogenesis]]: the incidence of asthma seems to be increasing worldwide, and asthma is now very much more common in affluent countries.

In 1968 [[Andor Szentivanyi]] first described ''The Beta Adrenergic Theory of Asthma''; in which blockage of the Beta-2 receptors of pulmonary smooth muscle cells causes asthma.<!--

==Asthma and sleep apnea==
It is recognized with increasing frequency that patients who have both [[obstructive sleep apnea]] and asthma often improve tremendously when the sleep apnea is diagnosed and treated.<ref name=sleep_anpea1>{{cite press release/citation | title = Breathing disorders during sleep are common among asthma patients, may help predict severe asthma | publisher = University of Michigan Health System | date = May 25, 2005 | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2005/asthmasleep.htm | accessdate = September 23, 2006 }}</ref> [[Positive airway pressure|CPAP]] is not effective in patients with nocturnal asthma only.<ref name=CPAP_not_an_anti-asthmatic>{{cite web | url = http://www.sleepapnea.org/resources/pubs/asthma-osa.html | title = Asthma and OSA | accessdate = September 23, 2006 | author= Basner RC | date = July 25, 2006 | publisher = American Sleep Apnea Association}}</ref>

==Asthma and gastro-esophageal reflux disease==
If [[gastro-esophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) is present, the patient may have repetitive episodes of acid aspiration. GERD may be common in difficult-to-control asthma, but according to one study, treating it does not seem to affect the asthma.<ref name=Leggett_et_al_2005>{{cite journal |author=Leggett JJ, Johnston BT, Mills M, Gamble J, Heaney LG |title=Prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in difficult asthma: relationship to asthma outcome |journal=Chest |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=1227–31 |year=2005 |pmid=15821199 |doi=10.1378/chest.127.4.1227 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/full/127/4/1227}}</ref>
When there is a clinical suspicion for GERD as the cause of the asthma, an [[Esophageal pH Monitoring]] is required to confirm the diagnosis and establish the relationship between GERD and asthma.
