After completing medical residency, Ofri began writing the stories of her medical training at [[Bellevue Hospital]], the oldest public hospital and one of the busiest urban hospitals in the country.

Ofri returned to [[Bellevue Hospital]] as an attending physician in 1998, where she continues to teach and practice medicine. In 2000, Ofri co-founded the [[Bellevue Literary Review]], the first literary magazine to arise from a hospital, and considered the preeminent journal in its field. She remains Editor-in-Chief.

==Books==

Ofri published her first book, ''[[Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue]]'', in 2001. This book traced the experiences of medical school and residency in an inner-city hospital.
The essay "Merced" from this book was chosen by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] for ''Best American Essays 2002'', and was also awarded the Editor's Prize for Nonfiction by ''The Missouri Review''.<ref name="Previous Contest Winners">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Previous Contest Winners | date=2004-09-21 | publisher= | url =http://www.missourireview.com/tmr-blog/archives/158 | work =The Missouri Review | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-26 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012025324/http://www.missourireview.com/tmr-blog/archives/158 |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}</ref>

Her second book, ''[[Incidental Findings: Lessons from my Patients in the Art of Medicine]]'', was published in 2005. It explores the aspects of teaching medicine to the next generation of physicians, as well as Ofri’s experiences as a “locum tenens” physician in the small towns of America. Ofri also writes about her own experience being a patient.

The essay "Living Will" from ''Incidental Findings'' was selected by Susan Orlean for ''Best American Essays 2005''. The essay "Common Ground" from ''Incidental Findings'' was selected by Oliver Sacks for ''Best American Science Writing 2003'' and given Honorable Mention by Anne Fadiman for ''Best American Essays 2004''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Menand | first = Louis | authorlink = | coauthors = Robert Atwan | title = The Best American Essays 2004 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | date = 2004-10-14 | location = | isbn = 978-0-618-35709-3 }}</ref>

Ofri released her third book, ''[[Medicine in Translation: Journeys with My Patients]]'' in 2010. It discusses immigration and health care—two topics that dominated the public discourse in 2010. Ofri explores the cultural challenges in medicine and chronicles the experiences of immigrants and Americans in the U.S. health care system.

Her fourth book, "What Doctors Feel--How Emotions Affect the Practice of Medicine," is due to be published in the spring of 2013. This book examines the emotional side of medicine–the shame, fear, anger, anxiety, empathy, and even love that impact patient care.
