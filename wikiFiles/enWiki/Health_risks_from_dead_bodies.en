The '''health risks of dead bodies''' are dangers related to the improper preparation and disposal of [[cadavers]].  While normal circumstances allow cadavers to be quickly [[Embalming|embalmed]], [[Cremation|cremated]], or [[Burial|buried]], [[List of disasters|natural and man-made disasters]] can quickly overwhelm and/or interrupt the established protocols for dealing with the dead.  Under such circumstances, the [[decomposition]] and [[putrefaction]] of cadavers goes unchecked, and raises a series of health, logistical, and psychological issues. After [[disaster]]s with extensive loss of life due to [[Physical trauma|trauma]] rather than disease&mdash;earthquakes, storms, human conflict, etc.&mdash;many resources are often expended on burying the dead quickly, and applying [[disinfectant]] to bodies for the specific purpose of preventing [[disease]]. This is an inappropriate<ref name=reliefweb/> use of scarce resources and [[Human resources|manpower]]: the health risks from dead bodies in such cases are minimal.<ref name=reliefweb/>

==False risks==
According to health professionals, the fear of spread of disease by bodies killed by trauma rather than disease is not justified. Among others, Steven Rottman, director of the [[UCLA]] [[UCLA School of Public Health|Center for Public Health and Disasters]], said that no scientific evidence exists that bodies of disaster victims increase the risk of [[epidemics]], adding that [[cadaver]]s posed less risk of [[Infectious disease|contagion]] than living people. In disasters involving trauma where there is competition for resources, they should be going into establishment of water supply, [[sanitation]], shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors, not digging mass graves. Spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower. Indiscriminate burial of corpses demoralises survivors and the lack of death certificates can cause practical problems to survivors.<ref name=reliefweb>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/AllDocsByUNID/0fb1a0c8c4ca2bac49256e0d0006659c Mass burials do more harm than good-experts]</ref>

Other considerations which are very important, but not directly relevant to the topic of health risks, include religious and cultural practices, the stench, and the effect on morale.

===Roots of incorrect notion===
The incorrect notion that ''all'' dead bodies inherently cause [[disease]]s is consistent with:
#The incorrect historical [[miasma theory of disease]], which held that diseases are spread by [[Joseph Bazalgette|foul air]]&mdash;in this case fouled by the stench of decomposing corpses.
#Confusion between normal decay processes and signs of disease; and the incorrect idea that [[microorganisms]] responsible for decomposition are dangerous to living people. "Microorganisms involved in the decay process (putrefaction) are not pathogenic".<ref name=PAHO04/>
#After a major disaster disease among survivors is indeed a problem, but is actually due to living in harsh conditions with poor sanitation. "Survivors present a much more important reservoir for disease [than cadavers]".<ref name=PAHO04/>
#Noting that corpses of those who died from certain '''[[contagious disease]]s''' (for example, in epidemics) do, indeed, spread disease, such as the case with [[smallpox]] and the [[1918 flu]], and incorrectly generalising this to all corpses.

According to the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) "concern that dead bodies are infectious can be considered a 'natural' reaction by persons wanting to protect themselves from disease"  although "the risk that bodies [of those killed in a natural disaster] pose for the public is extremely small".<ref name=PAHO04/>

==Real risks==
Contamination of water supplies by unburied bodies, burial sites, or temporary storage sites may result in the spread of [[gastroenteritis]] from normal intestinal contents.
According to a PAHO article on the Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters:<ref name=PAHO04>[http://publications.paho.org/english/dead_bodies.pdf Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters]</ref> {{cquote|There is little evidence of microbiological contamination of [[groundwater]] from burial. Where dead bodies have contaminated water supplies, gastroenteritis has been the most notable problem, although communities will rarely use a water supply where they know it to be contaminated by dead bodies. Microorganisms involved in the decay process (putrefaction) are not pathogenic.}}

To those in close contact with the dead, such as rescue workers, there is a health risk from chronic infectious diseases which those killed may have been suffering from and which spread by direct contact, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, enteric intestinal pathogens, tuberculosis, cholera and others.<ref name=PAHO04/>

The substances [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]] are produced during the [[decomposition]] of animal (including human) bodies, and both give off a foul odor.<ref>{{cite book | last =Lewis | first =Robert Alan | title =Lewis' Dictionary of Toxicology | publisher =CRC Press | year =1998 | isbn =1-56670-223-2|page=212 }}</ref><!--***Have commented out this reference as it seems irrelevant; there are 2 relevant refs not related to alternative medicine, ornithine, or weight loss. <ref>{{cite book | last =Kamhi | first =Ellen, [[Ph.D.]], [[Registered Nurse|RN]], HNC | title =Alternative Medicine Magazine's Definitive Guide to Weight Loss | publisher =Celestial Arts | date =2007 | isbn = 1-58761-259-3|quote=Ornithine is converted by bowel bacteria into a toxic substance called putrescine, which in turn degrades into polyamines, such as spermadine, spermine, and cadaverine (literally meaning "the essence of dead cadavers"). | page =14}}</ref>***--> They are toxic if massive doses are ingested (2&nbsp;g per kg of body weight of pure putrescine in rats, a larger dose for cadaverine),<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2714745 Acute and subacute toxicity of tyramine, spermidine, spermine, putrescine and cadaverine in rats]</ref> causing adverse effects. If these figures are assumed to apply to humans, a 60&nbsp;kg (132&nbsp;lb) person would be significantly affected by 6/37 times 120&nbsp;g = 20 grams (0.7 &nbsp;oz) of pure putrescine.  (The 6/37 is the allometric conversion for rats to humans based on body surface area.) There would be no effects at all for a tenth of that dose. By way of comparison the similar substance [[spermine]], found in [[semen]], is over 3 times as toxic.
