'''Laxatives''' ('''purgatives''', '''aperients''')  are [[food]]s, [[compound]]s or [[drug]]s taken to loosen the [[Feces|stool]], most often taken to treat [[constipation]]. Certain [[stimulant]], [[lubricant]] and [[saline]] laxatives are used to evacuate the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] for [[rectum|rectal]] and/or bowel examinations, and may be supplemented by [[enema]]s under certain circumstances. Sufficiently high doses of laxatives may cause [[diarrhea]].
Laxatives work to increase the movement of [[feces]] along the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.articlesbase.com/supplements-and-vitamins-articles/what-is-a-laxative-and-do-natural-laxatives-work-404326.html|title=What is a Laxative and Do Natural Laxatives Work?|date=5 May 2008|publisher=Articlesbase|accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>

Some laxatives combine more than one active ingredient.  Laxatives may be [[Oral administration|oral]] or in [[suppository]] form.

== Foods ==
Foods that help with laxation include [[fruit]]s, especially [[banana]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Das|first=JL|title=Medicinal and nutritional values of banana cv.

==Bulk-producing agents==
*Site of action: [[Small intestine|small]] and [[large intestine]]
*Onset of action: 12–72 hours
*Examples: [[Bran]] ([[insoluble fibre]]), Gamkaraya, Sterculia[Normacol], [[psyllium]] husk ([[Metamucil]] ([[soluble fibre]])), methylcellulose ([[Methyl cellulose|Citrucel]]), [[polycarbophil]], [[dietary fibre]], [[apple]]s ([[soluble fibre]]), [[broccoli]], [[prune]]s ([[soluble fibre]]).

A '''bulk-forming agent''' is a substance, such as [[dietary fiber|fiber]] in food, that adds bulk and water to [[human feces|stools]] so that they can pass more easily through the [[intestines]] (lower part of the [[digestive tract]]).<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=489403 Bulk-forming agent] entry in the public domain NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms</ref>

Also known as bulking agents or roughage, these include [[insoluble]] [[dietary fibre]].  Bulk-producing agents cause the stool to be bulkier and to retain more water, as well as forming an [[emollient]] gel, making it easier for [[Peristalsis|peristaltic action]] to move it along. They should be taken with plenty of water. Bulk-producing agents have the gentlest of effects among laxatives and can be taken just for maintaining regular bowel movements.

==Stool softeners==
*Site of action: Small and large intestine
*Onset of action: 12–72 hours
*Examples: [[docusate]] (Colace, Diocto), Gibs-Eze
These enable additional water and fats to be incorporated in the stool, making it easier to move.

==Lubricants or emollient==
*Site of Action: Colon
*Onset of Action: 6–8 hours
These simply make the stool slippery, so that it slides through the intestine more easily. An example is [[mineral oil]], which also retards colonic absorption of water, softening the stool.  Mineral oil may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and some minerals.

==Hydrating agents (osmotics)==<!-- This section is linked from [[Glycerol]] -->
These cause the intestines to hold more water within, softening the stool.  There are two principal types, [[saline]] and [[hyperosmotic]].

===Saline===
*Site of Action: Small and large intestine
*Onset of Action: 0.5–6 hours
* Examples: [[sodium phosphate]] (and variants), [[potassium sodium tartrate]], [[magnesium citrate]], [[magnesium hydroxide]] ([[Milk of magnesia]] or Cream of magnesia), [[magnesium sulfate]] (which is [[Epsom salt]]).

Saline laxatives attract and retain water in the intestinal lumen, increasing intraluminal pressure and thus softening the stool. They also cause the release of [[cholecystokinin]], which stimulates the digestion of fat and protein. Saline laxatives may alter a patient's fluid and electrolyte balance.

===Hyperosmotic agents===
*Site of Action: Colon
*Onset of Action: 0.5–3 hours
*Examples:  [[Glycerin]] [[suppository|suppositories]], [[sorbitol]], [[lactulose]], and [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG).

[[Lactulose]] works by the osmotic effect, which retains water in the colon, lowering the [[pH]] through bacterial fermentation to lactic, formic and acetic acid, and increasing colonic [[peristalsis]]. Lactulose is also indicated in [[Hepatic encephalopathy|Portal-systemic encephalopathy]]. [[Glycerin]] suppositories work mostly by hyperosmotic action, but also the sodium stearate in the preparation causes local irritation to the colon.

Solutions of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes ([[sodium chloride]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[potassium chloride]], and sometimes [[sodium sulfate]]) are used for [[whole bowel irrigation]], a process designed to prepare the bowel for surgery or [[colonoscopy]] and to treat certain types of [[poison]]ing. Brand names for these solutions include GoLytely, GlycoLax, CoLyte, Miralax, NuLytely, SUPREP, Fortrans and others. Solutions of [[sorbitol]] have similar effects as the forementioned. Brand name SoftLax.

====Effectiveness====
For adults, a [[randomized controlled trial]] found [[polyethylene glycol|PEG]] [MiraLax or GlycoLax] 17&nbsp;grams once per day to be superior to [[tegaserod]] at 6&nbsp;mg twice per day.<ref name="pmid17573794">{{cite journal |author=Di Palma JA, Cleveland MV, McGowan J, Herrera JL |title=A randomized, multicenter comparison of polyethylene glycol laxative and tegaserod in treatment of patients with chronic constipation |journal=Am.

For children, [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]] was found to be more effective than [[lactulose]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00901 |title=BestBETs: Is polyethylene glycol safe and effective for chro... |accessdate=2007-09-06 |format= |work=}}</ref>

==Stimulant or irritant==
Stimulant laxatives act on the intestinal [[mucosa]] or [[nerve plexus]], altering water and [[electrolyte]] secretion. They also stimulate [[Peristalsis|peristaltic action]] and can be dangerous under certain circumstances.<ref name=pmid9649012>{{cite journal | author = Joo J, Ehrenpreis E, Gonzalez L, Kaye M, Breno S, Wexner S, Zaitman D, Secrest K | title = Alterations in colonic anatomy induced by chronic stimulant laxatives: the cathartic colon revisited | journal = J Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 283–6 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9649012 | doi = 10.1097/00004836-199806000-00014}}</ref> They are the most powerful among laxatives and should be used with care.

==Serotonin agonist==
These are motility stimulants that work through activation of [[serotonin|5-HT<sub>4</sub>]] receptors of the [[enteric nervous system]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. However, some have been discontinued or restricted due to potentially harmful cardiovascular side-effects.

[[Tegaserod]] (brand name [[Zelnorm]]) was discontinued from marketing in the United States on March 30, 2007.  It is still available to physicians for patients in emergency situations that are life-threatening or require hospitalization.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm103223.htm Tegaserod, FDA Zelnorm (tegaserod maleate) Information]</ref>

[[Cisapride]] (brand name Prepulsid) was voluntarily removed from the U.S. market on July 14, 2000 for the same reason as Tegaserod.  Its use in many other countries is discontinued or restricted.  It is still available for veterinary use as a compound to treat GI tract problems.

[[Prucalopride]] (brand name Resolor) is a current
drug which was approved for use in the EU October 15, 2009<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/001012/WC500053995.pdf European Medicines Agency EPAR summary for the public]</ref> and in Canada (brand name Resotran) on December 7, 2011.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/sbd-smd/drug-med/sbd_smd_2012_resotran_141157-eng.php#a2 Health Canada, Notice of Decision for Resotran]</ref>   It has not been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for use in the United States, but it is in development by [[Shire plc|Shire PLC]].<ref>http://www.shire.com/shireplc/en/rd/pipeline Shire PLC, R and D projects, Resolor</ref>

==Chloride channel activators==
[[Lubiprostone]] (brand name Amitiza) is used in the management of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.  It causes the intestines to produce a chloride-rich fluid secretion which soften the stool, increases motility, and promotes spontaneous bowel movements (SBM).

==Uses==
*Bowel preparation
*Chronic constipation
*Chronic immobility

==Problems with use==

===Laxative abuse===
Laxative abuse is potentially serious since it can lead to [[intestinal paralysis]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS),<ref name=neda>{{cite web | url=http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/nedaDir/files/documents/handouts/Laxative.pdf |format=PDF| title=Laxative Abuse: Some Basic Facts | publisher=[[National Eating Disorders Association]] | year=2005 | accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> [[pancreatitis]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[renal failure]],<ref name=copeland>{{cite journal |author=Copeland P |title=Renal failure associated with laxative abuse |journal=Psychother Psychosom |volume=62 |issue=3–4 |pages=200–2 |year=1994 |pmid=7531354 |doi=10.1159/000098619 |first2=H. |first3=Ch. |first4=R. |first5=A. |first6=L. |first7=J. |first8=J. |first9=I. |last2=Molina |last3=Ohye |last4=MacIas |last5=Alaminos |last6=Alvarez |last7=Teijeiro |last8=Mu&ntilde;oz |last9=Ortega}}</ref><ref name=wright>{{cite journal |author=Wright L, DuVal J |title=Renal injury associated with laxative abuse |journal=South Med J |volume=80 |issue=10 |pages=1304–6 |year=1987 |pmid=3660046 |doi=10.1097/00007611-198710000-00024}}</ref> [[factitious diarrhea]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oster JR, Materson BJ, Rogers AI |title=Laxative abuse syndrome |journal=Am.

===Laxative gut===
Physicians warn against the chronic use of stimulant laxatives due to concern that chronic use causes the colonic tissues to get worn out over time and not be able to expel feces due to long term overstimulation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A common finding in patients who have used stimulant laxatives is a brown pigment deposited in the intestinal tissue, known as [[melanosis coli]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Historical & non-mainstream medical use==
Laxatives, then called '''physicks''' or '''purgatives''', were used extensively in [[history of medicine|pre-modern medicine]] to treat a wide range of conditions for which they are now generally regarded as ineffective in modern [[evidence-based medicine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Similarly, laxatives (often termed [[colon cleanse]]s), continue to be promoted by practitioners of [[complementary medicine]] for a range of conditions, including conditions which are [[pseudoscience|not medically recognized]], e.g. [[mucoid plaque]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
