'''Electron therapy''' or Electron Beam Therapy (EBT) is a kind of [[external beam radiotherapy]] where [[electrons]] are directed to a [[tumor]] site.

==Equipment==
Electron beam therapy is performed using a medical [[linear accelerator]]. The same device can also be used to produce high energy photon beams. When electrons are required, the x-ray target is retracted out of the beam and the electron beam is [[Collimator|collimated]] with a piece of apparatus known as an applicator or an additional collimating insert, constructed from a low melting point alloy.

==Properties==

Electron beams have a finite range, after which dose falls off rapidly. Therefore they spare deeper healthy tissue. The depth of the treatment is selected by the appropriate energy.

==Indications==
Electron beam therapy is used in the treatment of superficial tumors like cancer of skin regions, or total skin (e.g. [[mycosis_fungoides]]), diseases of the limbs (e.g. [[melanoma]] and [[lymphoma]]), nodal irradiation, and it may also be used to boost the radiation dose to the surgical bed after [[mastectomy]] or [[lumpectomy]]. For deeper regions [[IOERT|intraoperative electron radiation therapy]] might be applied.
