'''Mohammed Ahmed Abdallah''' (born c. 1953)<ref name=WP>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111502283.html |title=Physician Honored For Work In Darfur |author=Nora Boustany |date=16 November 2007 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> is a Sudanese physician and human rights activist. 

A member of the [[Fur people]], he is from the [[Marrah Mountains]] in Central [[Darfur]]. As a boy, he walked three days to reach his middle school, and five days to reach his high school.<ref name=WP /> He then attended medical school at the [[University of Khartoum]], graduating in 1976.<ref name=EK>{{cite web |url=http://rfkcenter.org/remarks-by-sen-edward-kennedy-2007-rfk-human-rights-award-ceremony-2 |title=Remarks by Sen. Edward Kennedy: 2007 RFK Human Rights Award Ceremony |author=Edward Kennedy |year=2007 |publisher=Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> The first physician from his area, he later constructed a medical network throughout Darfur to report rapes and other violence.<ref name=WP /> He became a medical professor at Darfur's [[Al Fashir University]] and acted as director of the [[Amel Center for the Treatment & Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture in Darfur]] during the [[War in Darfur]].<ref name=RFK>{{cite web |url=http://rfkcenter.org/mohammed-ahmed-abdallah |title=Mohammed Ahmed Abdallah, Sudan |publisher=Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref>

Abdallah served as a delegate to peace negotiations between 33 Darfur tribes in 1989. At the beginning of the Darfur crisis in 2003, he again served as a peace delegate.<ref name=EK />

In 2007, he was awarded the [[Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award]] for being "steadfast in his efforts to rectify the region's human rights crisis through serving victims of torture and providing leadership in the movement for peace."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rfkcenter.org/darfuri-doctor-and-rights-defender-to-receive-2007-rfk-human-rights-award-3 |title=Darfuri Doctor and Rights Defender to Receive 2007 RFK Human Rights Award |year=2007 |publisher=Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> The award came with a US$35,000 cash prize as well as a five-year partnership with the U.S.-based organization [[Physicians for Human Rights]].<ref name=WP /> In accepting the prize, Abdallah stated his desire to act not only as a physician, but also a [[hakim (title)|hakim]] (the Arabic word for doctor): 
<blockquote>The role of the Hakim is not only to treat the patients but to protect his community... In Darfur, my role is not just that of a doctor, but someone who must work to protect the community, uphold the human rights of the people of Darfur and work towards peace.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rfkcenter.org/remarks-by-dr-mohammed-ahmed-2007-rfk-human-rights-award-ceremony-2 |title=Remarks by Dr. Mohammed Ahmed: 2007 RFK Human Rights Award Ceremony |year=2007 |publisher=Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2009, Abdallah criticized the policy of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] toward Sudan, stating that though the situation in Darfur was worsening, the U.S. government still lacked a "coherent policy" for the region. Ahmad argued that a regional approach including Chad, Egypt, Libya, and the Central African Republic was the only way to find a long-term solution to the ongoing crisis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/worldly_boston/2009/03/activist_says_darfur_crisis_wo.html |title=Activist says Darfur crisis worsening |author=James F.
