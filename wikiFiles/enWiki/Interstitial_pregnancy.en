An '''interstitial pregnancy''' is a uterine but [[ectopic pregnancy]]; the [[pregnancy]] is located outside of the uterine cavity in that part of the [[Fallopian tube]] that penetrates the muscular layer of the [[uterus]].<ref name=ajobg>{{cite journal |last=Moawad |first=N. S. |last2=Mahajan |first2=S. T. |last3=Moniz |first3=M. H. |last4=Taylor |first4=S. E. |last5=Hurd |first5=W.

==Anatomy==
The part of the Fallopian tube that is located in the uterine wall and connects the remainder of the tube to the endometrial cavity is called its "interstitial" part, hence the term "interstitial pregnancy"; it has a lenghth of 1–2&nbsp;cm and a width of 0.7&nbsp;cm.<ref name=ajobg/> Its borders are the opening (ostium) of the tube to the endometrial cavity within the uterus and, laterally, the visible narrow segment of the tube. The area is well supplied by the [[Sampson artery]] which is connected to both, the [[uterine artery|uterine]] and the [[ovarian artery]]. Surrounded by uterine muscle ([[myometrium]]) it can expand significantly when it hosts a pregnancy.

Interstitial pregnancies can be confused with ''angular pregnancies''; the latter, however,  are located within the endometrial cavity in the corner where the tube connects; typically those pregnancies are viable although a high miscarriage has been reported.<ref name=ajobg/> A pregnancy located next to the interstitial section laterally is an isthmic tubal pregnancy.

The definition of an ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy outside of the uterine cavity, not outside of the uterus, as the interstitial pregnancy is still a uterine pregnancy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Page |first=E.

==Frequency==
Interstitial pregnancies account for 2–4% of all tubal pregnancies, or for  1 in 2,500 to 5,000 live births.<ref name=damario>{{cite book |last=Damario |first=M. A. |last2=Rock |first2=J.

==Diagnosis==
Early diagnosis is important and today facilitated by the use of [[transvaginal ultrasonography|sonography]] and the quantitative [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) assay.  As in other cases of ectopic pregnancy, risk factors are previous tubal pregnancy, [[IVF]] therapy,  tubal surgery, and a history of sexual infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tulandi |first=T. |last2=Al-Jaroudi |first2=D. |title=Interstitial pregnancy: results generated from the Society of Reproductive Surgeons Registry |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |year=2004 |volume=103 |issue= |pages=47–50 |pmid=14704243 |doi= }}</ref>
Typical symptoms of an interstitial pregnancy are the classical signs of ectopic pregnancy, namely [[abdominal pain]] and [[vaginal bleeding]]. [[Hemorrhagic shock]] is found in almost a quarter  of patients.;<ref name=soriano>{{cite journal |last=Soriano |first=D. |last2=Vicus |first2=D. |last3=Mashiach |first3=R. |last4=Schiff |first4=E. |last5=Seidman |first5=D. |last6=Goldenberg |first6=M. |title=Laparoscopic treatment of cornual pregnancy: a series of 20 consecutive cases |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=90 |year=2008 |issue=3 |pages=839–843 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.07.1288 |pmid=17936282}}</ref> this explains the relatively high mortality rate. 

In pregnant patients sonography is the primary method to make the diagnosis, even when patients have no symptoms. The paucity of myometrium  around the gestational sac is diagnostic, while, in contrast, the angular pregnancy has at least 5&nbsp;mm of myometrium on all of its sides.<ref>{{cite book  |last=Doubilet |first=P. |last2=Benson |first2=C. B. |title=Atlas of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |isbn=0-7817-3633-1 }}</ref>  Ultrasonic criteria for the diagnosis include an empty uterine cavity, a [[gestational sac]] separate from the uterine cavity, and a myometrial thinning of less than 5&nbsp;mm around the gestational sac; typically the ''interstitial line sign''—an echogenic line from the endometrial cavity to the corner next to the gestational mass—is seen.<ref name=ackerman>{{cite journal |last=Ackerman |first=T. E. |last2=Levi |first2=C. S. |last3=Dashefsky |first3=S. M. |last4=Holt |first4=S. C. |last5=Lindsay |first5=D. J. |title=Interstitial line: sonographic finding in interstitial (cornual) ectopic pregnancy |journal=Radiology |year=1993 |volume=189 |issue=1 |pages=83–87 |doi= |pmid=8372223}}</ref> [[MRI]] can be used particularly when it is important to distinguish between an interstitial and angular pregnancy.

On average the gestational age at presentation is about  7–8 weeks.<ref name=ajobg/> In a 2007 series, 22% of patients  presented with rupture and hemorrhagic shock, while a third of the patients were asymptomatic, the remainder had abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding.<ref name=soriano/>  Cases that  are not diagnosed until surgery show  an asymmetrical bulge  in  the upper corner of the uterus.<ref name=ajobg/>

==Treatment==
Choice of treatment is largely dictated by the clinical situation. A ruptured interstitial pregnancy is a [[medical emergency]] that requires an immediate surgical intervention either by [[laparoscopy]] or [[laparotomy]] to stop the bleeding and remove the pregnancy.<ref name=ajobg/> 

Surgical methods to remove the pregnancy include cornual evacuation,  incision of the cornua with removal of the pregnancy (cornuostomy), resection of the cornual area or a cornual wedge resection, typically combined with an ipsilateral [[salpingectomy]],  and [[hysterectomy]].<ref name=ajobg/> Because of the vascularity of the interstitial region particularly during pregnancy, blood loss during surgery may be substantial. Postoperatively, patients with conservative surgical therapy are at risk for development of a [[persistent ectopic pregnancy]] due to the presence of deeply embedded surviving [[trophoblast]]ic tissue; thus, monitoring of hCG levels is indicated until they become undetectable.

In patients with an asymptomatic interstitial pregnancy [[methotrexate]] has been successfully used, however, this approach may fail and result in cornual rupture of the pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal  |title=The conservative treatment of interstitial pregnancy |last=Jermy |first=K. |last2=Thomas |first2=J. |last3=Doo |first3=A. |last4=Bourne |first4=T. |journal=BJOG |year=2004 |volume=111 |issue= |pages=1283–1288 |doi= |pmid=15521876}}</ref> Selective [[uterine artery embolization]] has been successfully performed to treat interstial pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Deruelle |first=P. |last2=Closset |first2=E. |title=Management of interstitial pregnancy using selective uterine artery embolization |journal=Obstet Gynecol |year=2006 |volume=107 |issue= |pages=427–428 |pmid=16449137}}</ref>

==Subsequent pregnancies==
Patients with an ectopic pregnancy are generally at higher risk for a recurrence, however, there are no specific data for patients with an interstitial pregnancy.  When a new pregnancy is diagnosed it is important to monitor the pregnancy by transvaginal sonography to assure that is it properly located, and that the surgically repaired area remains intact.<ref name=loret>{{cite journal |last=Loret de Mola |first=J.
