'''Lower respiratory tract infection''', while often used as a synonym for [[pneumonia]], can also be applied to other types of infection including [[lung abscess]] and [[acute bronchitis]].  Symptoms include shortness of breath, weakness, high fever, coughing and fatigue.

Lower respiratory tract infections place a considerable strain on the health budget and are generally more serious than upper respiratory infections. Since 1993 there has been a slight reduction in the total number of deaths from lower respiratory tract infection. However in 2002 they were still the leading cause of deaths among all [[Infectious disease#Mortality from infectious diseases|infectious diseases]], and they accounted for 3.9 million deaths worldwide and 6.9% of all deaths that year.<ref name="WHO-2004">{{cite book | authorlink=<!-- http://www.who.int/en/ --> | title=The World Health Report 2004 - Changing History | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | year=2004 | pages=120–4 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/en/report04_en.pdf | isbn= 92-4-156265-X | author=Robert Beaglehole...et al.}}</ref>

There are a number of acute and chronic infections that can affect the lower respiratory tract.  The two most common infections are [[bronchitis]] and pneumonia.<ref name="TGAntibiotic13">Antibiotic Expert Group. Therapeutic guidelines: Antibiotic. 13th ed. North Melbourne: Therapeutic Guidelines; 2006.</ref>  [[Influenza]] affects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.  Antibiotics are often thought to be the first line treatment in lower respiratory tract infections; however, these are not indicated in viral infections. It is important to use appropriate antibiotic selection based on the infecting organism and to ensure this therapy changes with the evolving nature of these infections and the emerging resistance to conventional therapies.<ref name="pmid11742937">{{cite journal |author=Guthrie R |title=Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections: etiology and treatment |journal=[[Chest (journal)|Chest]] |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=2021–34 |year=2001 |pmid=11742937 |doi= 10.1378/chest.120.6.2021|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11742937}}</ref> ''H. influenzae'' and ''M. catarrhalis'' are of increasing importance in both community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) while the importance of ''S. pneumoniae'' is declining.

==Classification==
=== Bronchitis ===
{{main|Bronchitis}}
[[Bronchitis]] can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis can be defined as acute bacterial or viral infection of the larger airways in healthy patients with no history of recurrent disease.<ref name="TGAntibiotic13" /> It affects over 40 adults per 1000 each year and consists of transient inflammation of the major bronchi and trachea.<ref name="oldRef6">BJM Clinical evidence: London, United Kingdom: BMJ, 1999-2007 : Accessed 29/3/7 at : http://0-www.clinicalevidence.com.library.newcastle.edu.au/ceweb/index.jsp.</ref> Most often it is caused by viral infection and hence antibiotic therapy is not indicated in immunocompetent individuals.<ref name="oldRef7">Therapeutic guidelines : respiratory. 2nd ed ed: North Melbourne : Therapeutic Guidelines Limited, 2000.</ref><ref name="oldRef9" /> There are no effective therapies for viral bronchitis.<ref name="oldRef9" /><ref name="oldRef10" /> Treatment of acute bronchitis with antibiotics is common but controversial as their use has only moderate benefit weighted against potential side effects (nausea and vomiting), increased resistance, and cost of treatment in a self-limiting condition.<ref name="oldRef6" /><ref name="oldRef11">Fahey T SJ, Becker L, Glazier R. . Antibiotics for acute bronchitis. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2004, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD000245. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD000245.pub2}}.
</ref> Beta2 agonists are sometimes used to relieve the cough associated with acute bronchitis. In a recent systematic review it was found there was no evidence to support their use.<ref name="oldRef9">{{cite journal |author=Becker LA, Hom J, Villasis-Keever M, van der Wouden JC |title=Beta2-agonists for acute bronchitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=7 |pages=CD001726 |year=2011 |pmid=21735384 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001726.pub4}}</ref> 

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis (AECB) are frequently due to non-infective causes along with viral ones. 50% of patients are colonised with ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' or ''Moraxella catarrhalis''.<ref name="TGAntibiotic13" /> Antibiotics have only been shown to be effective if all three of the following symptoms are present:- increased [[dyspnoea]], increased [[sputum]] volume and [[purulence]]. In these cases 500&nbsp;mg of Amoxycillin orally, every 8 hours for 5 days or 100&nbsp;mg doxycycline orally for 5 days should be used.<ref name="TGAntibiotic13" />

=== Pneumonia ===
{{main|Pneumonia}}
[[Pneumonia]] occurs in a variety of situations and treatment must vary according to the situation.<ref name="oldRef10">Integrated pharmacology / Clive Page ... [et al.]. 2nd ed ed: Edinburgh : Mosby, 2002.</ref> It is classified as either community or hospital acquired depending on where the patient contracted the infection. It is life-threatening in the elderly or those who are immunocompromised.<ref name="oldRef12" /><ref name="oldRef13" /> The most common treatment is antibiotics and these vary in their adverse effects and their effectiveness.<ref name="oldRef12">{{cite journal |author=Bjerre LM, Verheij TJ, Kochen MM |title=Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002109 |year=2009 |pmid=19821292 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002109.pub3}}</ref> Pneumonia is also the leading cause of death in children less than five years of age.<ref name="oldRef14">{{cite journal |author=Kabra SK, Lodha R, Pandey RM |title=Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD004874 |year=2010 |pmid=20238334 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004874.pub3}}</ref> The most common cause of pneumonia is pneumococcal bacteria, ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' accounts for 2/3 of bacteremic pneumonias.<ref name="oldRef15">The Merck manual of diagnosis and therapy. 17th ed / Mark H.

For optimal management of a pneumonia patient the following must be assessed;- pneumonia severity (including where to treat e.g. Home, hospital or intensive care), identification of causative organism, analgesia of chest pain, the need for supplemental oxygen, physiotherapy, Hydration, bronchodilators and possible complications of emphysema or lung abscess.<ref name="oldRef16">eTG complete [electronic resource] {{cite web |url=http://0-www.etg.hcn.net.au.library.newcastle.edu.au/ |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
