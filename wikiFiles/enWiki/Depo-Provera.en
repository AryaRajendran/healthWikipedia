[[File:Prikpil.JPG|thumb|Depo Provera]]
'''Depo-Provera''' is a branded [[progestogen]]-only contraceptive, '''depot medroxyprogesterone acetate''' ('''DMPA''') [[long acting reversible contraceptive|long acting reversible]] [[hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptive]] [[birth control]] drug that is injected every 3 months. It is an aqueous [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] for [[Injection (medicine)#Depot injection|depot injection]] of the [[pregnanes|pregnane]] [[17-Hydroxyprogesterone|17α-hydroxyprogesterone]]-derivative [[progestin]] ''[[medroxyprogesterone acetate]]''.

==Commercial products==

Depo-Provera is the brand name for a 150&nbsp;mg aqueous injection of DMPA ''depot medroxyprogesterone acetate''. It is applied in the form of an [[Injection (medicine)#Intramuscular injection|intramuscular injection]]. The shot must be injected into the thigh or buttocks or deltoid four times a year (every 11 to 13 weeks) and provides pregnancy protection instantaneously after the first injection.<ref name="Depo Provera: The Birth Control Shot">Stacey, Dawn. [http://contraception.about.com/od/prescriptionoptions/a/depoprovera.htm ''Depo Provera: The Birth Control Shot''] Accessed October 13, 2009</ref> It was approved in the [[United States]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for contraceptive use on 29 October 1992,<ref name=Leary1992 /> and for management of [[endometriosis]]-related pain on 25 March 2005. ''Depo-subQ Provera 104'', also manufactured by [[Pfizer]], is a variation of the original Depo Shot that is instead a 104&nbsp;mg subcutaneous injection. It contains 69 percent of progestin found in the original Depo-Provera shot. This can be injected using a smaller injection needle inserting the hormone just below the skin, instead of into the muscle, in either the abdomen or thigh. This subcutaneous injection claims to reduce the side effects of the progestin while still maintaining all the same benefits of the original Depo shot.

==Mechanism of action==

The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the progestogen activity and dose. High-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as injectable DMPA, inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent [[ovulation]] as their primary mechanism of action.<!--

The progestogen decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen [[negative feedback]] and the lack of [[estrogen]] [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.<!--

A secondary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration by changes in the [[cervical mucus]].<!--

Inhibition of ovarian function during DMPA use causes the [[endometrium]] to become thin and atrophic. These changes in the endometrium could, theoretically, prevent implantation. However, because DMPA is highly effective in inhibiting ovulation and sperm penetration, the possibility of [[human fertilization|fertilization]] is negligible. No available data support prevention of implantation as a mechanism of action of DMPA.<!--

Trussell did not use 1995 NSFG failure rates as ''typical use'' failure rates for the other two then newly available long-acting contraceptives, the [[Norplant]] implant (2.3%) and the ParaGard copper T 380A [[Intrauterine device|IUD]] (3.7%), which were (as with Depo-Provera) an order of magnitude higher than in clinical trials. Since Norplant and ParaGard allow no scope for user error, their much higher 1995 NSFG failure rates were attributed by Trussell to contraceptive overreporting at the time of a conception leading to a live birth.<!--

There have been no studies that consider lack of sex in the effectiveness of this birth control method. Many women experience drastic negative side effects such as abnormal uterine bleeding which can interfere with the normal intimacy habits of the patient.

==Pregnancy and breastfeeding==

Depo-Provera may be used by breast-feeding mothers. Heavy bleeding is possible if given in the immediate [[postpartum]] time and is best delayed until six weeks after birth. It may be used within five days if not breast feeding. While a study showed "no significant difference in birth weights or incidence of birth defects" and "no significant alternation of immunity to infectious disease caused by breast milk containing DMPA", a subgroup of babies whose mothers started Depo-Provera at 2 days postpartum had a 75% higher incidence of doctor visits for infectious diseases during their first year of life.<!--

A larger study with longer follow-up concluded that "use of DMPA during pregnancy or breastfeeding does not adversely affect the long-term growth and development of children". This study also noted that "children with DMPA exposure during pregnancy and lactation had an increased risk of suboptimal growth in height," but that "after adjustment for socioeconomic factors by multiple logistic regression, there was no increased risk of impaired growth among the DMPA-exposed children." The study also noted that effects of DMPA exposure on puberty require further study, as so few children over the age of 10 were observed.<!--

Conditions where the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using Depo-Provera:
* Multiple risk factors for [[arterial]] [[cardiovascular disease]]
* Current [[deep vein thrombosis|deep vein thrombosis (DVT)]] or [[pulmonary embolus|pulmonary embolus (PE)]]
* [[Migraine headache]] with [[Aura (symptom)|aura]] while using Depo-Provera
* Before evaluation of unexplained [[vaginal bleeding]] suspected of being a serious condition
* Past history of [[breast cancer]] and no evidence of current disease for 5 years
* Active [[liver disease]]: (acute [[viral hepatitis]], severe decompensated [[cirrhosis]], [[hepatic Adenoma|benign]] or [[hepatocellular carcinoma|malignant]] [[liver tumour]]s)
* Conditions of concern for hypo-estrogenic effects and reduced [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] levels theoretically increasing cardiovascular risk:
** [[Hypertension]] with [[vascular disease]]
** Current and history of [[ischemic heart disease]]
** History of [[stroke]]
** [[Diabetes]] for over 20 years or with [[diabetic nephropathy|nephropathy]]/[[diabetic retinopathy|retinopathy]]/[[diabetic neuropathy|neuropathy]] or [[vascular disease]]

Conditions which represent an unacceptable health risk if Depo-Provera is used:
* Current or recent [[breast cancer]] (a hormonally sensitive tumour)

Conditions where use of Depo-Provera is not indicated and should not be initiated:
* [[Pregnancy]]

== Disadvantages and side effects ==
===Warnings and precautions===

*Takes one week to take effect if given after the first five days of the period cycle. Effective immediately if given during the first five days of the period cycle.
*Offers no protection against [[Sexually transmitted disease|Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)]].
*Depo-Provera can alter menstrual bleeding. After a year of use, 55% of women experience [[amenorrhoea]]; after 2 years, the rate rises to 68%. Heavy abnormal uterine bleeding can occur and disruptions in the menstrual cycle can last long after an injection. In the first months of use "irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, heavy or continuous bleeding" was reported.<!--

*Long-term studies of users of Depo-Provera have found slight or no increased overall risk of breast cancer. However, the study population did show a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (Depo use in the last four years) under age 35, similar to that seen with the use of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s.<!--

==== Black box warning ====
While it has long been known that Depo-Provera causes [[osteoporosis|bone loss]], it has recently been discovered that the osteoporotic effects of the injection grow worse the longer Depo-Provera is administered, may remain long after the injections are stopped, and may be irreversible.  For these reasons, on November 17, 2004 the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] and [[Pfizer]] agreed to put a [[black box warning]] on Depo-Provera's label.<!--

==Controversy over approval of Depo-Provera in the United States==
There was a long, controversial history regarding the approval of Depo-Provera by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]. The original manufacturer, [[Upjohn]], applied repeatedly for approval. FDA advisory committees unanimously recommended approval in 1973, 1975 and 1992, as did the FDA's professional medical staff, but the FDA repeatedly denied approval. Ultimately, on October 29, 1992, the FDA approved Depo-Provera, which had by then been used by over 30 million women since 1969 and was approved and being used by nearly 9 million women in more than 90 countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Thailand]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Indonesia]].<!--
  --><ref name=Leary1992>{{cite journal |author=Leary, Warren E. |date=October 30, 1992 |title=U.S. Approves Injectable Drug As Birth Control |journal=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9E0CE1DD123BF933A05753C1A964958260 |pmid=11646958 | pages=A.1}}</ref>  Points in the controversy included:

*Animal testing for [[carcinogenicity]]. Depo-Provera caused breast cancer tumors in dogs. Critics of the study claimed that dogs are more sensitive to artificial progesterone, and that the doses were too high to extrapolate to humans. The FDA pointed out that all substances carcinogenic to humans are carcinogenic to animals as well, and that if a substance is not carcinogenic it does not register as a carcinogen at high doses. Levels of Depo-Provera which caused malignant mammary tumors in dogs were equivalent to 25 times the amount of the normal [[luteal phase]] progesterone level for dogs. This is lower than the pregnancy level of progesterone for dogs, and is species-specific.<!--

*Atlanta/Grady Study. Upjohn studied the effect of Depo for 11 years in Atlanta, mostly on black women who were receiving public assistance, but did not file any of the required follow-up reports with the FDA. Investigators who eventually visited noted that the studies were disorganized. "They found that data collection was questionable, consent forms and protocol were absent; that those women whose consent had been obtained at all were not told of possible side effects. Women whose known medical conditions indicated that use of Depo would endanger their health were given the shot. Several of the women in the study died; some of cancer, but some for other reasons, such as suicide due to depression. Over half the 13,000 women in the study were lost to followup due to sloppy record keeping." Consequently, no data from this study was usable.<ref name="albion"/>
*WHO Review. In 1992, the WHO presented a review of Depo in four developing countries to the FDA. The [[National Women's Health Network]] and other women's organizations testified at the hearing that the WHO was not objective, as the WHO had already distributed Depo-Provera in developing countries. Depo was approved for use in US on the basis of the WHO review of previously submitted evidence from countries such as Thailand, evidence which the FDA had  deemed insufficient and too poorly designed for assessment of cancer risk at a prior hearing.<!--
