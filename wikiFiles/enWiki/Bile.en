'''Bile''' or '''gall''' is a bitter-tasting, dark green to yellowish brown fluid, produced by the [[liver]] of most [[vertebrate]]s, that aids the process of [[digestion]] of [[lipid]]s in the [[small intestine]]. In many species, bile is stored in the [[gallbladder]]  and upon eating is discharged into the [[duodenum]]. Bile is a composition of the following materials: water (85%), [[Bile acid|bile salts]] (10%), mucus and pigments (3%), fats (1%), inorganic salts (0.7%).
==Historical Tradition==
In medical theories prevalent in the West from [[Classical Antiquity]] up to the [[Middle Ages]], the body's health depended on the equilibrium between [[Four humors|four "humors"]] or vital fluids:  [[blood]], [[phlegm]], "'''yellow bile'''" (or [[choler]]) and "'''black bile'''". Excesses of the last two humors were thought to produce aggression and depression, respectively; and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] names for them gave rise to the English words "[[cholera]]" and "[[melancholia]]".  Those same theories explain the derivation of the English word "bilious" from "bile", and the meaning of "gall" in English as "exasperation" or "impudence". These theories derived from the four element theory. Underlying this is the idea that the organs of the body are connected to the soul, specifically the astral body, and reflect the emotional state of the soul. Thus excess anger for example would give rise to liver derangement and imbalances in the humours. This is similar to the Chinese medical system. In the course of history, the metaphysical nature of this process was lost, and the theory fell from use.

== Physiological functions ==
Bile acts to some extent as a [[surfactant]], helping to [[emulsification|emulsify]] the fats in food.  Bile salt [[anion]]s are [[hydrophilic]] on one side and [[hydrophobic]] on the other side; consequently, they tend to aggregate around droplets of fat ([[triglycerides]] and [[phospholipid]]s) to form [[micelle]]s, with the hydrophobic sides towards the fat and hydrophilic sides facing outwards. The hydrophilic sides are negatively charged, and this charge prevents fat droplets coated with bile from re-aggregating into larger fat particles. Ordinarily, the micelles in the duodenum have a diameter of around 14-33&nbsp;μm.  

The dispersion of food fat into micelles thus provides a greatly increased surface area for the action of the enzyme [[pancreatic lipase]], which actually digests the triglycerides, and is able to reach the fatty core through gaps between the bile salts. A triglyceride is broken down into two fatty acids and a [[monoglyceride]], which are absorbed by the [[Intestinal_villus|villi]] on the intestine walls. After being transferred across the intestinal membrane, the fatty acids reform into triglycerides, before being absorbed into the lymphatic system through [[lacteal]]s.  Without bile salts, most of the lipids in food would be excreted in feces, undigested.

Since bile increases the absorption of fats, it is an important part of the absorption of the fat-soluble substances, such as the [[vitamin]]s [[vitamin D|D]], [[Tocopherol|E]], [[vitamin K|K]] and [[vitamin A|A]].

Besides its digestive function, bile serves also as the route of excretion for [[bilirubin]], a byproduct of [[erythrocyte|red blood cells]] recycled by the liver. Bilirubin derives from [[hemoglobin]] by [[glucuronidation]].

Bile is alkaline and also has the function of neutralizing any excess stomach acid before it enters the [[duodenum]], the first section of the small intestine. Bile salts also act as [[bactericide]]s, destroying many of the microbes that may be present in the food.

== Bile soap ==
Bile from slaughtered mammals can be mixed with [[soap]]. This mixture, called bile soap,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The invention of certain improvements in the manufacture of soap, which will be particularly applicable to the felting of woollen cloths.|journal=The London Journal Of Arts And Sciences; And Repertory Of Patent Inventions|year=1837|first=W. |last=Newton|coauthors=|volume=IX|issue=|pages=289 |url=http://www.google.co.uk/books?vid=0MfyvmoTsdK02ZeP86W&id=GhMAAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA19-PA291&lpg=RA19-PA291&dq=bile+soap&as_brr=1|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> can be applied to textiles a few hours before washing and is a traditional and rather effective method for removing various kinds of tough stains.

== Abnormal conditions associated with bile ==
* The [[cholesterol]] contained in bile will occasionally accrete into lumps in the gallbladder, forming [[Cholelithiasis|gallstones]].  Cholesterol gallstones are generally treated through surgical removal of the gallbladder.  However, they can sometimes be dissolved by increasing the concentration of certain naturally occurring bile acids, such as [[chenodeoxycholic acid]] and [[ursodeoxycholic acid]].

* On an empty stomach – after repeated [[vomiting]], for example – a person's vomit may be green or dark yellow, and very bitter.  The bitter and greenish component may be bile or normal digestive juices originating in the stomach{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The color of bile is often likened to "fresh-cut grass" {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, unlike components in the stomach that look greenish yellow or dark yellow. Bile may be forced into the stomach secondary to a weakened valve, the presence of certain drugs including alcohol, or powerful muscular contractions and duodenal spasms.
* In the absence of bile, fats become indigestible and are instead excreted in [[feces]], a condition called [[steatorrhea]].  Feces lack their characteristic brown color and instead are white or gray, and greasy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barabote RD, Tamang DG, Abeywardena SN, ''et al.'' |title=Extra domains in secondary transport carriers and channel proteins |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1758 |issue=10 |pages=1557–79 |year=2006 |pmid=16905115 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.06.018}}</ref>  Steatorrhea can lead to deficiencies in [[essential fatty acid]]s and [[fat-soluble vitamins]].  In addition, past the [[small intestine]] (which is normally responsible for absorbing fat from food) the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[gut flora]] are not adapted to processing fats, leading to problems in the large intestine.
