'''John Arderne''' (1307–1392) was an [[England|English]] [[surgeon]],<ref Name="South">{{cite book  | last = South  | first = John Flint  | title = Memorials of the Craft of Surgery in England   | publisher = Cassell & Co.

Arderne's help was given to both the rich, and the poor. His view on fees was that rich men should be charged as much as possible, but poor men should be remedied free of charge. His remedies for illness are considered substantial for his time. Arderne recommended [[opium]] as a [[soporific]] and as an external [[anesthetic]] that the patient ‘schal slepe so that he schal fele no kuttyng.'<ref>Louise Foxcroft, The Making of Addiction: The ‘Use and Abuse’ of Opium in Nineteenth-Century Britain (Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2007), 9.  http://books.google.com/books?id=mKgsr7whohoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=louise+foxcroft#PPP7,M1</ref>  In his document about [[Fistula in ano]], John of Arderne sets out not only his operative procedures but also his code of conduct for the ideal medical practitioner.

In his early life, he resided in [[Newark-on-Trent]]. It is also believed he could have lived in [[Nottingham]]. He was in London by 1370 when he is thought to have been admitted as a member of the [[Guild of Surgeons]]. He saw active military service in the [[Hundred Years' War (1337–1360)|Hundred Years' War]] in the army of [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry of Grosmont]], [[Duke of Lancaster]], and [[John of Gaunt]]. He fought also at the [[Siege of Algeciras (1342-1344)]], one of the first European battles in which gunpowder was used; the injuries he saw there informed his medical writings for three decades.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Jack Edward |last=McCallum |title=Military medicine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5BXB9QtUfFQC&pg=PA174&dq=%22john+of+arderne%22 |page=174 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2008 |isbn=1-85109-693-0 }}</ref> Near the end of his long life he achieved the title of [[Master Surgeon]].

He developed several treatments for [[knight]]s, most notably for an infliction called "[[Fistula]] In Ano," a condition where a large, painful lump appears between the base of the [[vertebral column|spine]] and the [[anus]]. He could successfully cut this lump out, and described how to do so in a historical document which still remains. In technical terms, The Fistula in Ano, without any regard to the strict definition of the word, is understood to be an Abscess, running upon, or into the [[Intestinum Rectum]]; though an abscess in this part, when once ruptured, does generally, if neglected, grow callous in its cavity and edges, and become at last, what is properly called a ''Fistula;'' this condition is now diagnosed as a [[sacrococcygeal fistula]], more commonly known as a [[pilonidal cyst]] (This developed due to long amounts of time sitting on a [[horse]].)  He also created an [[ointment]] for arrow wounds and [[clyster]]s made out of [[conium|hemlock]], [[opium]] and [[henbane]] in 1376.

He died without a male heir.(?)
