'''Ectodermal dysplasia''' is not a single disorder, but a group of syndromes all deriving from abnormalities of the [[ectoderm]]al structures.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|570}} More than 150 different [[syndrome]]s have been identified.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pinheiro M, Freire-Maia N |title=Ectodermal dysplasias: a clinical classification and a causal review |journal=Am. J. Med. Genet. |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=153–62 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7856640 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320530207 |url=}}</ref> 

Despite some of the syndromes having different genetic causes the symptoms are sometimes very similar. Diagnosis is usually by clinical observation often with the assistance of family medical histories so that it can be determined whether transmission is autosomal dominant or recessive. 

Worldwide around 7,000 people have been diagnosed with an ectodermal dysplasia condition. Some ED conditions are only present in single family units and derive from very recent mutations. Ectodermal dysplasias can occur in any race but are much more prevalent in [[Caucasian race|caucasians]] than any other group and especially in fair caucasians. 

Ectodermal dysplasias are described as "heritable conditions in which there are abnormalities of two or more ectodermal structures such as the [[hair]], [[teeth]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[sweat glands]], cranial-facial structure, digits and other parts of the body."<ref>[http://www.ectodermaldysplasia.org]</ref>

== Presentation ==
=== Hair === 
Individuals affected by an ED syndrome frequently have abnormalities of the hair follicles. Scalp and body hair may be thin, sparse, and very light in color, even though beard growth in affected males may be normal. The hair may grow very slowly or sporadically and it may be excessively fragile, curly, or even twisted.

=== Nails ===
Fingernails and toenails may be thick, abnormally shaped, discolored, ridged, slow-growing, or brittle. The cuticles may be prone to infections.

===Skin ===
The skin may be lightly pigmented. Skin sustaining injury may grow back permanently hypo-pigmented. In some cases, red or brown pigmentation may be present. Skin can be prone to rashes or infections and can be thick over the palms and soles. Care must be taken to prevent cracking, bleeding, and infection.

=== Sweat glands ===
Individuals affected by certain ED syndromes cannot [[Perspiration|perspire]]. Their sweat glands may function abnormally or may not have developed at all because of inactive proteins in the sweat glands. Without normal sweat production, the body cannot regulate temperature properly. Therefore, overheating is a common problem, especially during hot weather. Access to cool environments is important.<ref>{{cite web| last = U.S. National Library of Medicine| title = Ectodermal dysplasia| work = MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia| accessdate = 02 January 2013| url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001469.htm}}</ref>

=== Teeth ===
In the development of tooth buds frequently result in congenitally absent teeth (in many cases a lack of a permanent set) and/or in the growth of teeth that are peg-shaped or pointed. The enamel may also be defective. Cosmetic dental treatment is almost always necessary and children may need dentures as early as two years of age. Multiple denture replacements are often needed as the child grows, and dental implants may be an option in adolescence, once the jaw is fully grown. Nowadays the option of extracting the teeth and substituting them with dental implants is quite common. In other cases, teeth can be crowned. Orthodontic treatment also may be necessary. Because dental treatment is complex, a multi-disciplinary approach is best.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Shahrokhi Rad A, Siadat H, Monzavi A, Mangoli A |title= Full Mouth Rehabilitation of a Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia Patient with Dental Implants: A Clinical Report.|journal=.

=== Other features ===
People with ED often have certain cranial-facial features which can be distinctive, [[skull bossing|frontal bossing]] is common, longer or more pronounced chins are frequent, broader noses are also very common. In some types of ED, abnormal development of parts of the eye can result in dryness of the eye, cataracts, and vision defects. Professional eye care can help minimize the effects of ED on vision. Similarly, abnormalities in the development of the ear may cause hearing problems. Respiratory infections can be more common because the normal protective secretions of the mouth and nose are not present. Precautions must be taken to limit infections.<ref>[http://www.nfed.org/FAQ.htm FAQs / General Description<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pinheiro M, Freire-Maia N, Gollop TR |title=Odontoonychodysplasia with alopecia: a new pure ectodermal dysplasia with probable autosomal recessive inheritance |journal=Am.

== Genetics ==
ED can be classified by inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked) or by which structures are involved (hair, teeth, nails, and/or sweat glands).

There are several different types with distinct genetic causes:

* [[Hay-Wells syndrome]], [[Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome]] and [[EEC syndrome]] are all associated with [[TP63]].<ref name="urlEctodermal Dysplasia: eMedicine Dermatology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1110595-overview |title=Ectodermal Dysplasia: eMedicine Dermatology |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
* [[Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia]] can be associated with ''[[EDA (gene)|EDA]]'', ''[[EDAR]]'', and ''[[EDARADD]]''
* [[Margarita Island ectodermal dysplasia]] is associated with ''[[PVRL1]]''
* [[Ectodermal dysplasia with skin fragility]] is associated with ''[[PKP1]]''
* [[Clouston's hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia]] is associated with ''[[GJB6]]''
* [[Naegeli syndrome]]/[[Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis]]s is associated with ''[[KRT14]]''
* [[Pachyonychia congenita]] is caused by multiple keratins
* [[Focal dermal hypoplasia]] is associated with ''[[PORCN]]''
* [[Ellis–van Creveld syndrome]] is associated with ''[[EVC (gene)|EVC]]''
* [[Palmoplantar ectodermal dysplasia]] refers to several different conditions selectively affecting the hands and feet

== Notable cases ==
One well-known person with ectodermal dysplasia is actor [[Michael Berryman]].

Another is famous skateboarder and artist [[Levi Hawken]], who is well known for his '[[Nek Minnit]]' videos on [[YouTube]].
