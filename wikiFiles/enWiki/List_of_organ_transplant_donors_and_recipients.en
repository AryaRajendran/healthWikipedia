This '''list of notable organ transplant donors and recipients''' includes people who were the first to undergo certain organ transplant procedures or were people who made significant contributions to their chosen field and who have either donated or received an [[organ transplant]] at some point in their lives, as confirmed by public information.

==Survival statistics==
Survival statistics depend greatly on the age of donor, age of recipient, skill of the transplant center, compliance of the recipient, whether the organ came from a living or cadaveric donor and overall health of the recipient. Median survival rates can be quite misleading, especially for the relatively small sample that is available for these organs. Survival rates improve almost yearly, due to improved techniques and medications. This example is from the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS), the USA umbrella organization for transplant centers. Up-to-date data can be obtained from the UNOS website.

|'''[[Robert Altman]]'''
|(1925–2006)
|Film Director. Announced the transplant at the [[78th Academy Awards]] in 2005 while accepting his Lifetime Achievement Oscar. Altman said, "I'm here under false pretenses … Eleven years ago I had a heart transplant, a total heart transplant. I got the heart of, I think, a young woman who was in about in her late thirties. By that kind of calculation you may be giving this award too early because I think I've got about 40 years left."

|'''[[Robert P. Casey]]'''
|(1932–2000)
|41st [[Governor of Pennsylvania]]. Announced that he needed a rare heart/liver transplant due to a rare genetic condition in which proteins invade and destroy major bodily organs.

The short time between the announcement and the operation lead to accusations that Casey was secretly placed on the top of the waiting list, along with sparking an [[urban legend]] that the donor was "killed" by the [[Pennsylvania State Police]] in order to "harvest" the organs.

On August 17, he announced that his body was free of the viral infection and that he was ready to find a new transplant. He then received a second kidney transplant, which was donated by his mother.
