'''Brachytherapy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word βραχυς ''brachys'', meaning "short-distance"), also known as '''internal radiotherapy''', '''sealed source radiotherapy''', '''curietherapy''' or '''endocurietherapy''', is a form of [[radiotherapy]] where a [[radiation|radiation source]] is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment.  Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for [[cervical cancer|cervical]], [[Prostate cancer|prostate]], [[Breast cancer|breast]], and [[skin cancer]] and can also be used to treat tumours in many other body sites.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO">

Brachytherapy can be used alone or in combination with other therapies such as surgery, [[external beam radiotherapy|External Beam Radiotherapy]] (EBRT) and [[chemotherapy]].

Brachytherapy contrasts with [[unsealed source radiotherapy]] in which a therapeutic radioisotope is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue which requires destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like [[cobalt-60]]) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue, but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}}<ref name="Stewart 2007">

A key feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation only affects a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT - the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}}<ref name="Stewart 2007" />

A course of brachytherapy can be completed in less time than other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose.<ref name="Stewart 2007" /> Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and the treatment is often performed on an outpatient basis. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients.<ref name="BMJGroup-2009" /><ref name="Kelley 2007">

==History==

Brachytherapy dates back to 1901 (shortly after the discovery of radioactivity by [[Henri Becquerel]] in 1896) when [[Pierre Curie]] suggested to [[Henri-Alexandre Danlos]] that a radioactive source could be inserted into a tumour.<ref name="Gupta-1995">

It was found that the radiation caused the tumour to shrink.<ref name="Nag 2009" /> Independently, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] also suggested the use of radiation in this way.<ref name="Nag 2009"/> In the early twentieth century, techniques for the application of brachytherapy were pioneered at the Curie institute in Paris by Danlos and at St Luke's and Memorial Hospital in New York by [[Robert Abbe]].<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}}<ref name="Nag 2009" />

Interstitial radium therapy was common in the 1930s.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}} Gold seeds filled with [[radon]] were used as early as 1942<ref>{{cite pmid|1137421}}</ref> until at least 1958.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Winston|first=P.|title=Carcinoma of the Trachea Treated by Radon Seed Implantation|journal=The Journal of Laryngology & Otology|year=1958|month=June|volume=72|issue=06|pages=496–499|doi=10.1017/S0022215100054232}}</ref> [[Gold]] shells were selected by Gino Failla around 1920 to shield [[beta ray]]s while passing [[gamma ray]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oak Ridge Associated Universitie|title=Seeds (ca. 1940s - 1960s)|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/brachytherapy/seeds.htm|work=Health Physics Historical Instrumentation Collection|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> [[Cobalt]] needles were also used briefly after world war II.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}} Radon and cobalt were replaced by radioactive [[tantalum]] and gold, before [[iridium]] rose in prominence.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}} First used in 1958, iridium is the most commonly used artificial source for brachytherapy today.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}}

Following initial interest in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use declined in the middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources.<ref name="Nag 2009" /><ref name="Aronowitz-2008">
{{Cite pmid|18299114}}</ref> However, the development of [[brachytherapy#Treatment_delivery|remote afterloading systems]], which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients.<ref name="Gupta-1995" /> This, together with more recent advancements in three dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}}

==Types==
Different types of brachytherapy can be defined according to (1) the [[Brachytherapy#Source placement|placement of the radiation sources]] in the target treatment area, (2) the [[Brachytherapy#Dose rate|rate or ‘intensity’ of the irradiation dose]] delivered to the tumour, and (3) the [[Brachytherapy#Duration of dose delivery|duration of dose delivery]].

===Source placement===
The two main types of brachytherapy treatment in terms of the placement of the radioactive source are '''interstitial''' and '''contact'''.

* In the case of interstitial brachytherapy, the sources are placed directly in the target tissue of the affected site, such as the prostate or breast.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}}

* Contact brachytherapy involves placement of the radiation source in a space next to the target tissue.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}} This space may be a body cavity ('''intracavitary''' brachytherapy) such as the [[cervix]], [[uterus]] or [[vagina]]; a body lumen ('''intraluminal''' brachytherapy) such as the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] or [[oesophagus]]; or externally ('''surface''' brachytherapy) such as the [[skin]].<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}} A radiation source can also be placed in blood vessels ('''intravascular''' brachytherapy) for the treatment of [[Coronary stent#Restenosis|coronary in-stent restenosis]].<ref name="Giap 2007">

===Dose rate===
The dose rate of brachytherapy refers to the level or ‘intensity’ with which the radiation is delivered to the surrounding medium and is expressed in [[Gray (unit)|Grays]] per hour (Gy/h).

* '''Pulsed-dose rate (PDR)''' brachytherapy involves short pulses of radiation, typically once an hour, to simulate the overall rate and effectiveness of LDR treatment. Typical tumour sites treated by PDR brachytherapy are gynaecological<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 14}} and head and neck cancers.<ref name="Mazaron-2009" />

===Duration of dose delivery===
[[File:Brachytherapy.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Permanent brachytherapy is often performed for prostate cancer using "seeds" - small radioactive rods implanted directly into the tumour.]]
The placement of radiation sources in the target area can be temporary or permanent.

* Temporary brachytherapy involves placement of radiation sources for a set duration (usually a number of minutes or hours) before being withdrawn.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}} The specific treatment duration will depend on many different factors, including the required rate of dose delivery and the type, size and location of the cancer. In LDR and PDR brachytherapy, the source typically stays in place up to 24 hours before being removed, while in HDR brachytherapy this time is typically a few minutes.<ref name="Flynn 2005">{{Cite book

* Permanent brachytherapy, also known as seed implantation, involves placing small LDR radioactive seeds or pellets (about the size of a grain of rice) in the tumour or treatment site and leaving them there permanently to gradually decay. Over a period of weeks or months, the level of radiation emitted by the sources will decline to almost zero. The inactive seeds then remain in the treatment site with no lasting effect.<ref name="Moule-2009">

==Clinical applications==
[[File:Clinical applications of brachytherapy.jpg|thumb|500px|right|'''Body sites in which brachytherapy can be used to treat cancer''']]
Brachytherapy is commonly used to treat cancers of the [[cervix]], [[prostate]], [[breast]], and [[skin]].<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />

Brachytherapy can also be used in the treatment of tumours of the [[Human brain|brain]], [[Human eye|eye]], head and neck region (lip, [[floor of mouth]], tongue, [[nasopharynx]] and [[oropharynx]]),<ref name="Mazaron-2009" /> respiratory tract ([[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[bronchi]]), digestive tract ([[oesophagus]], [[gall bladder]], [[bile duct|bile-ducts]], [[rectum]], [[anus]]),<ref name="Dvorák-2002">{{Cite pmid|12143240}}</ref> urinary tract ([[bladder]], [[urethra]], [[penis]]), female reproductive tract ([[uterus]], [[vagina]], [[vulva]]), and soft tissues.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />

As the radiation sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high dose of radiation to be applied to a small area. Furthermore, because the radiation sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour,<ref name="Nag-2004" /> thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.

The use of HDR brachytherapy enables overall treatment times to be reduced compared with EBRT.<ref name="Joseph-2008">

Many brachytherapy procedures are performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience may be particularly relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, to ensure that they have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans.

Brachytherapy can be used with the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally advanced tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread to other parts of the body). In appropriately selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.<ref name="Guedea-2009">
{{Cite pmid|19574206}}</ref><ref name="Litwin-2007">
{{Cite pmid|17455209}}</ref>
However, in locally advanced tumours, surgery may not routinely provide the best chance of cure and is often not technically feasible to perform. In these cases radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, offers the only chance of cure.<ref name="Pistis -2009">
{{Cite pmid|19734106}}</ref><ref name="Lertsanguansinchai-2004">
{{Cite pmid|15275728}}</ref>
In more advanced disease stages, brachytherapy can be used as palliative treatment for symptom relief from pain and bleeding.

In cases where the tumour is not easily accessible or is too large to ensure an optimal distribution of irradiation to the treatment area, brachytherapy can be combined with other treatments, such as EBRT and/or surgery.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 1}} Combination therapy of brachytherapy exclusively with chemotherapy is rare.<ref name="Roddiger-2006">

Permanent seed implantation is often a less invasive treatment option compared to the surgical removal of the prostate.<ref name="BMJGroup-2009" />

Temporary HDR brachytherapy is a newer approach to treating prostate cancer, but is currently less common than seed implantation. It is predominately used as to provide an extra dose in addition to EBRT (known as ‘”boost” therapy) as it offers an alternative method to deliver a high dose of radiation therapy that conforms to the shape of the tumour within the prostate, while sparing radiation exposure to surrounding tissues.<ref name="Galalae-2004" /><ref name="Hoskin-2007" /><ref name="Pieters -2009" /><ref name="Hsu-ABS" /><ref name="Ash 2005" /><ref name="Pisansky-2008">

The main benefit of breast brachytherapy compared to EBRT is that a high dose of radiation can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs.<ref name="Hoskin 2005" /> APBI can typically be completed over the course of a week.<ref name="Nelson-2009" /> The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with EBRT (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).<ref name="Kelley 2007" /> Brachytherapy has demonstrated excellent local control of breast cancer at follow-up of up to 6 years post treatment.<ref name="Nelson-2009" /><ref name="King-2000">

There are two methods that can be used to deliver breast brachytherapy:
* '''Interstitial breast brachytherapy''' using multiple catheters
* '''Intracavitary breast brachytherapy''' using a balloon catheter

Interstitial breast brachytherapy involves the temporary placement of several flexible plastic catheters in the breast tissue. These are carefully positioned to allow optimal targeting of radiation to the treatment area while sparing the surrounding breast tissue.<ref name="Kelley 2007" /> The catheters are connected to an [[#Procedure|afterloader]], which delivers the planned radiation dose to the treatment area. Interstitial breast brachytherapy can be used as “boost” after EBRT, or as APBI.<ref name="Polgár-2009" />

Intracavitary breast brachytherapy (also known as “balloon brachytherapy”) involves the placement of a single catheter into the breast cavity left after the removal of the tumour (lumpectomy).<ref name="Kelley 2007" /> The catheter can be placed at the time of the lumpectomy or postoperatively.<ref name="Kelley 2007" /> Via the catheter, a balloon is then inflated in the cavity. The catheter is then connected to an [[#Procedure|afterloader]], which delivers the radiation dose through the catheter and into the balloon. Currently, intracavitary breast brachytherapy is only routinely used for APBI.<ref name="Shah-2010">{{Cite pmid|19836283}}</ref>

There are also devices that combine the features of interstitial and intracavitary breast brachytherapy (e.g. SAVI). These devices use multiple catheters but are inserted through a single-entry point in the breast. Studies suggest the use of multiple catheters enables physicians to target the radiation more precisely.<ref>Scanderbeg, D; Yashar, C; White, G; Rice, R; Pawlicki, T (2010). “Evaluation of Three APBI Techniques under NSABP B-39 Guidelines.” ''Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics'' 11 (1): 274-280.</ref><ref>Yashar, C; Blair, S; Wallace, A; Scanderbeg, D (2009). “Initial Clinical Experience with the Strut-Adjusted Volume Implant Brachytherapy Applicator for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation.” ''Brachytherapy'' 8: 367-372.</ref>

===Skin cancer===
HDR brachytherapy for nonmelanomatous [[skin cancer]], such as [[basal cell carcinoma]] and [[squamous cell carcinoma]], provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 28}} Various applicators can be used to ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of the skin and help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 28}}

Brachytherapy for skin cancer provides good cosmetic results and clinical efficacy; studies with up to 5 years follow-up have shown that brachytherapy is highly effective in terms local control, and is comparable to EBRT.<ref name="Guix-2000">

It has been suggested that brachytherapy may become a standard of treatment for skin cancer in the near future.<ref name="Musmacher-2006" />

===Coronary/Vascular===
Brachytherapy can be used in the treatment of [[Coronary stent#Restenosis|coronary in-stent restenosis]], in which a catheter is placed inside blood vessels, through which sources are inserted and removed.<ref name="ESC-2005">
{{Cite pmid|15769784}}</ref>
In treating In-stent restenosis (ISR) Drug Eluting stents (DES)have been found to be superior to Intracoronary Brachytherapy (ICBT).<!--<ref name="Clinical Cardiology 5/10/11>-->
However, there is continued interest in vascular brachytherapy for persistent restenosis in failed stents and vein grafts.
The therapy has also been investigated for use in the treatment of [[peripheral vascular disease|peripheral vasculature stenosis]]<ref name="Sidawy-2002">
{{Cite pmid|12021726}}</ref> and considered for the treatment of [[atrial fibrillation]].<ref name="Pérez-Castellano-2006">
{{Cite pmid|16836719}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The likelihood and nature of potential acute, sub-acute or long-term side-effects associated with brachytherapy depends on the location of the tumour being treated and the type of brachytherapy being used.

===Acute===
Acute side effects associated with brachytherapy include localised bruising, swelling, bleeding, discharge or discomfort within the implanted region. These usually resolve within a few days following completion of treatment.<ref name="Macmillan-brachytherapy">

Patients may also feel fatigued for a short period following treatment.<ref name="Macmillan-brachytherapy" /><ref name="Fieler-1997">
{{Cite pmid|9127366}}</ref>

Brachytherapy treatment for cervical or prostate cancer can cause acute and transient urinary symptoms such as urinary retention, urinary incontinence or painful urination (dysuria).<ref name="Frank-2007" /><ref name="Doust-2004">
{{Cite pmid|15301172}}</ref><ref name="Magné-2009">
{{Cite pmid|18954913}}</ref>
Transient increased bowel frequency, diarrhoea, constipation or minor rectal bleeding, may also occur.<ref name="Frank-2007" /><ref name="Doust-2004" /><ref name="Magné-2009" /> Acute and subacute side effects usually resolve over a matter of days or a few weeks. In the case of permanent (seed) brachytherapy for prostate cancer, there is a small chance that some seeds may migrate out of the treatment region into the bladder or urethra and be passed in the urine.

Brachytherapy for skin cancer may result in a shedding of the outer layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 28}} If the cancer is located on the lip, ulceration may occur as a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.<ref name="Casino-2006">

Most of the acute side effects associated with brachytherapy can be treated with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once the treatment is completed. The acute side effects of HDR brachytherapy are broadly similar to EBRT.<ref name="Fieler-1997" />

===Long-term===
In a small number of people, brachytherapy may cause long-term side effects due to damage or disruption of adjacent tissues or organs. Long-term side effects are usually mild or moderate in nature. For example, urinary and digestive problems may persist as a result of brachytherapy for cervical or prostate cancer, and may require ongoing management.<ref name="Frank-2007" /><ref name="Doust-2004" /><ref name="Magné-2009" />

Brachytherapy for prostate cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 20}}<ref name="Moule-2009" /> However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, the majority of cases can successfully be treated with drugs such as [[Viagra]].<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 20}} Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after [[radical prostatectomy]].<ref name="Guedea-2009" /><ref name="Doust-2004" />

Brachytherapy for breast or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the treatment area. In the case of breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur as a result of fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.<ref name="Vicini-2009">

==Safety around others==
Patients often ask if they need to have special safety precautions around family and friends after receiving brachytherapy. If temporary brachytherapy is used, no radioactive sources remain in the body after treatment. Therefore, there is no radiation risk to friends or family from being in close proximity with them.<ref name=rtanswers.com>{{Cite web
 |url= http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/brachytherapy.aspx

If permanent brachytherapy is used, low dose radioactive sources (seeds) are left in the body after treatment - the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women for a short time after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.<ref name=rtanswers.com />

==Procedure==
[[File:Brachytherapy procedure flow.jpg|thumb|right|455px|'''Typical stages of a brachytherapy procedure.''']]

===Initial planning===
In order to accurately plan the brachytherapy procedure, a thorough clinical examination is performed to understand the characteristics of the tumour. In addition, a range of imaging modalities can be used to visualise the shape and size of the tumour and its relation to surrounding tissues and organs. These include x-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT or CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 5}} The data from many of these sources can be used to create a 3D visualisation of the tumour and the surrounding tissues.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 5}}

Using this information, a plan of the optimal distribution of the radiation sources can be developed. This includes consideration of how the source carriers (applicators), which are used to deliver the radiation to the treatment site, should be placed and positioned.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 5}} Applicators are non-radioactive and are typically needles or plastic catheters. The specific type of applicator used will depend on the type of cancer being treated and the characteristics of the target tumour.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 5}}

This initial planning helps to ensure that ‘cold spots’ (too little irradiation) and ‘hot spots’ (too much irradiation) are avoided during treatment, as these can respectively result in treatment failure and side-effects.<ref name="Pötter-2008" />

===Insertion and imaging of the applicator(s)===
Before radioactive sources can be delivered to the tumour site, the applicators have to be inserted and correctly positioned in line with the initial planning.

Imaging techniques, such as x-ray, fluoroscopy and ultrasound are typically used to help guide the placement of the applicators to their correct positions and to further refine the treatment plan.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 5}} CAT scans and MRI can also be used.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 5}} Once the applicators are inserted, they are held in place against the skin using sutures or adhesive tape to prevent them from moving. Once the applicators are confirmed as being in the correct position, further imaging can be performed to guide detailed treatment planning.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 5}}

[[File:Brachytherapy virtual patient.jpg|thumb|left|250px|'''Creation of the ‘virtual’ patient to plan the delivery of brachytherapy.''']]

===Creation of a virtual patient===
The images of the patient with the applicators in situ are imported into treatment planning software and the patient is brought into a dedicated shielded room for treatment. The treatment planning software enables multiple 2D images of the treatment site to be translated into a 3D ‘virtual patient’, within which the position of the applicators can be defined.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO" />{{rp|Ch. 5}} The spatial relationships between the applicators, the treatment site and the surrounding healthy tissues within this ‘virtual patient’ are a copy of the relationships in the actual patient.
{{-}}

===Optimizing the irradiation plan===
[[File:Brachytherapy treatment planning.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Refinement of the treatment plan during the brachytherapy procedure.''']]
To identify the optimal spatial and temporal distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation of the distribution of the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins.<ref name="GYNOpt-2009">

 }}</ref> This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.

===Treatment delivery===
The radiation sources used for brachytherapy are always enclosed within a non-radioactive capsule. The sources can be delivered manually, but are more commonly delivered through a technique known as ‘afterloading’.

Manual delivery of brachytherapy is limited to a few LDR applications, due to risk of radiation exposure to clinical staff.<ref name="Flynn 2005" />

In contrast, afterloading involves the accurate positioning of non-radioactive applicators in the treatment site, which are subsequently loaded with the radiation sources. In manual afterloading, the source is delivered into the applicator by the operator.

Remote afterloading systems provide protection from radiation exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned in the patient, they are connected to an ‘afterloader’ machine (containing the radioactive sources) through a series of connecting guide tubes. The treatment plan is sent to the afterloader, which then controls the delivery of the sources along the guide tubes into the pre-specified positions within the applicator. This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the treatment room. The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along the tubes to the afterloader.

On completion of delivery of the radioactive sources, the applicators are carefully removed from the body. Patients typically recover quickly from the brachytherapy procedure, enabling it to often be performed on an outpatient basis.<ref name="Nag-2004" />

==Environmental hazard==
Due to the small size of brachytherapy sources and low control in early decades, there is a risk that some of these have escaped into the environment to become [[orphaned source]]s.
