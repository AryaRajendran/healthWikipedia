[[Developed country|Industrialized]] and [[developing country|developing countries]] have distinctly different rates of [[teenage pregnancy]]. 
In developed regions, such as [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]], teen [[parent]]s tend to be [[marriage|unmarried]] and [[Adolescence|adolescent]] pregnancy is seen as a [[social issue]].

By contrast, teenage parents in developing countries are often married, and their [[pregnancy]] may be welcomed by [[family]] and [[society]]. However, in these societies, early pregnancy may combine with [[malnutrition]] and poor [[health care]] to cause medical problems. A report by [[Save the Children]] found that, annually, 13 million children are born to women under age 20 worldwide. More than 90% of these births occur to women living in developing countries. [[Complications of pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] are the leading cause of [[death|mortality]] among women between the ages of 15 and 19 in such areas, as they are the leading cause of mortality among older women. 

The age of the mother is determined by the easily verified date when the pregnancy ''ends'', not by the estimated date of ''[[Fertilisation|conception]]''.<ref name=Kost>{{cite journal

Consequently, actual numbers of pregnancies that occurred among teenagers are higher than those reported here, because most of the women who conceived at age 19 had their births or abortions after they turned 20 and, thus, were not counted as teenagers.}}</ref>  Consequently, the statistics do not include women who first became pregnant before their 20th birthdays, if those pregnancies did not end until on or after their 20th birthdays.<ref name=Kost />

==Rates by continent==
===Africa===
The highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world — 143 per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 years — is in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref name="ncbi">Treffers, P.E. (November 22, 2003).

In [[Nigeria]], according to the Health and Demographic Survey in 1992, 47% of women aged 20–24 were married before 15 and 87% before 18. 53% of those surveyed also had given birth to a child before the age of 18.<ref name="subsahara">Locoh, Therese.

A [[Save the Children]] report identified 10 countries where motherhood carried the most risks for young women and their [[baby|babies]]. Of these, 9 were in sub-Saharan Africa, and Niger, [[Liberia]], and [[Mali]] were the nations where girls were the most at-risk. In the 10 highest-risk nations, more than one in six teenage girls between the ages of 15 to 19 gave birth annually, and nearly one in seven babies born to these teenagers [[infant mortality|died before the age of one year]].<ref name="savethechildren">[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/328/7449/1152-a Pregnancy and childbirth are leading causes of death in teenage girls in developing countries]
</ref>

===Asia===
In the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[premarital sex]] is uncommon, but early [[marriage]] sometimes means adolescent pregnancy. The rate of early marriage is higher in [[rural]] regions than it is in [[urbanization|urbanized]] areas. [[Total Fertility Rate|Fertility rate]]s in South Asia range from 71 to 119 births per 1000 women aged 15–19. 30% of all Indian [[abortion|induced abortion]]s are performed on women who are under 20.

Other parts of Asia have shown a trend towards increasing age at marriage for both [[sex]]es. In [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]], marriage before age 20 has all but disappeared, and, although the occurrence of [[sexual intercourse]] before marriage has risen, rates of adolescent childbearing are low at 4 to 8 per 1000. The rate of early marriage and pregnancy has decreased sharply in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]; however, it remains high in comparison to the rest of [[Asia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Surveys from [[Thailand]] have found that a significant minority of unmarried adolescents are [[Human sexual behavior|sexually active]]. Although premarital sex is considered [[Normal (behavior)|normal behavior]] for males, particularly with [[prostitute]]s, it is not always regarded as such for females. Most Thai youth reported that their first sexual experience, whether within or outside of marriage, was without contraception. The adolescent fertility rate in Thailand is relatively high at 60 per 1000. 25% of women admitted to [[hospital]]s in Thailand for complications of induced abortion are [[student]]s. The [[Politics of Thailand|Thai government]] has undertaken measures to inform the nation's youth about the prevention of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s and unplanned [[pregnancy]].

According to the [[World Health Organization]], in several Asian countries including [[Bangladesh]] and Indonesia, a large proportion (26-37%) of [[death]]s among female adolescents can be attributed to [[Maternal death|maternal causes]].<ref name="escap">Mehta, Suman, Groenen, Riet, & Roque, Francisco.

Retrieved July 7, 2006.</ref>

===Europe===
The overall trend in [[Europe]] since 1970 has been a decrease in the [[total fertility rate]], an increase in the age at which women experience their first birth, and a decrease in the number of births among teenagers. However, in the past, teenage mothers in Europe tended to be [[marriage|married]], and therefore were less likely to be perceived as a [[social issue]]. Some countries, such as [[Greece]] and [[Poland]], retain a [[traditional]] model of births to married mothers in their late teens.

The rates of teenage pregnancy may vary widely within a country. For instance, in the [[United Kingdom]], the rate of adolescent pregnancy in 2002 was as high as 100.4 per 1000 among young women living in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], and as low as 20.2 per 1000 among residents in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] [[Local government|local authority]] area of [[Rutland]]. In [[Italy]], the teenage birth rate in [[Central Italy|central regions]] is only 3.3 per 1,000, but, in the [[Mezzogiorno]] it is 10.0 per 1000.

Teenage birth is often associated with economic and social issues: such as alcohol and drug misuse and, across 13 nations in the [[European Union]], women who gave birth as teenagers were twice as likely to be living in [[poverty]], compared to those who first gave birth when they were over 20.<ref name="oecd">UNICEF. (2001). {{PDFlink|[http://www.unicef-icdc.org/publications/pdf/repcard3e.pdf A League Table of Teenage Births in Rich Nations]|888&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 909407 bytes -->}}. Retrieved July 7, 2006.</ref>

====Netherlands====
The [[Netherlands]] has a low rate of births and abortions among teenagers (5 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002<ref name="globalis"/>). Compared to countries with higher teenage birth rates, the Dutch have a higher average age at first intercourse and increased levels of contraceptive use (including the "double Dutch" method of using both a [[hormonal contraception]] method and a [[condom]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}).

====Mediterranean countries====
In some countries, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the low rate of adolescent pregnancy (6 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002 in both countries)<ref name="globalis"/> may be attributed to [[traditional values]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and [[social stigma]]tization.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} These two countries also have low abortion rates (lower than [[Sweden]] and the other [[Nordic countries]])<ref name="UNICEF-2001"/> and their teenage pregnancy rates are among the lowest in Europe. [[Portugal]], however, has a relatively high percentage of teenage pregnancy (17 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002).<ref name="globalis"/>

====Nordic countries====
[[Nordic countries]], such as [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], also have low rates of teenage birth (both have 7 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002<ref name="globalis"/>). However, [[Norway]]'s birth rate is slightly higher (11 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2002<ref name="globalis"/>) and [[Iceland]] has a birth rate of 19 per 1,000 women aged 15–19 <ref name="globalis"/> (nearly the same as the [[UK]]). These countries have higher abortion rates than the [[Netherlands]].

====United Kingdom====
{{Main|Teenage pregnancy and sexual health in the United Kingdom}}
The [[U.K.]] has one of the highest teenage birth rates in Europe with a rate of 26.4 teenage births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 in 2006, down from 27.9 births in 2001.<ref>Social Trends 38 Chapter 2 pp 23</ref> The [[U.K.]] also has a higher rate of [[abortion]] than most European countries. Of young Britans reported engaging in [[sexual intercourse]] whilst in their teens, 80% said they did not use a form of [[contraception]], although a half of those under 16, and one-third of those between 16 to 19, said they did not use a form of [[contraception]] during their first encounter. 10% of British teen mothers are married.<ref>"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=7522&More=Y Census 2001 People aged 16-29]" ''Office For National Statistics''</ref> Adolescent pregnancy is viewed as a matter of concern by both the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British government]] and the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British press]].

====Eastern Europe====
Romania and Bulgaria have some of the highest teenage birth rates in Europe with a rate of 39.3 and 46.7 teenage births per 1,000 women respectively.<ref name=UNICEF-2001/> Both countries also have very large [[Romani people|Romani]] populations, who have an occurrence of teenage pregnancies well above the local average.<ref>[http://mdgr.undp.sk/DOCUMENTS/MDG_Slovenia_GB_6.pdf ]</ref><ref>[http://www.tol.org/client/article/21599-silence-makes-babies.html Silence Makes Babies - Transitions Online]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=9EGllb7aoGoC&pg=PA34 The Politics of Gender: A Survey] By Yoke-Lian Lee</ref>

===North America===
====Canada====
The [[Canada|Canadian]] teenage birth rate in 2002 was 16 per 1000 <ref name="globalis"/> and the teenage pregnancy rate was 33.9. According to data from [[Statistics Canada]], the Canadian teenage pregnancy rate has trended towards a steady decline for both younger (15-17) and older (18-19) teens in the period between 1992-2002.<ref name="teenpregna">Dryburgh, H.

[[Alberta]] and [[Quebec]] have high teen pregnancy rates as well.

====United States====

However, the trend is decreasing: in 1990, the birth rate was 61.8, and the pregnancy rate 116.9 per thousand. This decline has manifested across all [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial group]]s, although teenagers of [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] [[Kinship and descent|descent]] retain a higher rate, in comparison to that of [[European-American]]s and [[Asian-American]]s. The [[Guttmacher Institute]] attributed about 25% of the decline to [[Sexual abstinence|abstinence]] and 75% to the effective use of [[contraception|contraceptives]].<ref name="guttermacher">Wind, Rebecca. The Guttmacher Institute. (February 19, 2004). "[http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2004/02/19/index.html U.S. Teenage Pregnancy Rate Drops For 10th Straight Year]." Retrieved July 7, 2006.</ref>

Within the United States teen pregnancy is often brought up in political discourse. The goal to limit teen pregnancy is shared by Republicans and Democrats, though avenues of reduction are usually different. Many Democrats cite teen pregnancy as proof of the continuing need for access to birth control and sexual education, while Republicans often cite a need for returning to conservative values, often including abstinence.

An inverse correlation has been noted between teen pregnancy rates and the quality of education in a state. A positive correlation, albeit weak, appears between a city's teen pregnancy rate and its average summer night temperature, especially in the Southern U.S. (Savageau, compiler, 1993–1995).
