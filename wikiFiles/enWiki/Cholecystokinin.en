'''Cholecystokinin''' ('''CCK''' or '''CCK-PZ'''; from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chole'', "bile"; ''cysto'', "sac"; ''kinin'', "move"; hence, ''move the bile-sac ([[gallbladder]])'') is a [[peptide hormone]] of the [[gastrointestinal system]] responsible for stimulating the [[digestion]] of [[fat]] and [[protein]]. Cholecystokinin, previously called '''''pancreozymin''''', is synthesized by I-cells in the mucosal epithelium of the small intestine and secreted in the [[duodenum]], the first segment of the [[small intestine]], and causes the release of digestive [[enzyme]]s and [[bile]] from the [[pancreas]] and [[gallbladder]], respectively. It also acts as a [[appetite suppressant|hunger suppressant]]. Recent evidence has suggested that it also plays a major role in inducing drug [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to [[opioids]] like [[morphine]] and heroin, and is partly implicated in experiences of pain hypersensitivity during opioid [[withdrawal]].<ref name="pmid10866896">{{cite journal | author=Kissin I, Bright CA, Bradley EL | title = Acute tolerance to continuously infused alfentanil: the role of cholecystokinin and N-methyl-D-aspartate-nitric oxide systems | journal=Anesth.

==Structure==
CCK is composed of varying numbers of [[amino acid]]s depending on [[post-translational modification]] of the ''CCK'' gene product, preprocholecystokinin. Thus CCK is actually a family of hormones identified by number of amino acids, e.g., CCK58, CCK33, and CCK8. CCK58 assumes a [[helix-turn-helix]] configuration.<ref name="pmid8967499">{{cite journal | author=Reeve JR Jr, Eysselein VE, Rosenquist G, Zeeh J, Regner U, Ho FJ, Chew P, Davis MT, Lee TD, Shively JE, Brazer SR, Liddle RA | title = Evidence that CCK-58 has structure that influences its biological activity | journal=Am. J. Physiol. | volume = 270 | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = G860-8 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8967499 }}</ref> Its existence was first suggested in 1905 by the British physiologist Joy Simcha Cohen. CCK is very similar in structure to [[gastrin]], another of the [[gastrointestinal hormone]]s. CCK and gastrin share the same five amino acids at their C-termini.

==Functions==
CCK mediates a number of [[physiology|physiological]] processes, including digestion and satiety. It is released by I cells located in the mucosal epithelium of the small intestine (mostly in the duodenum and jejunum), neurons of the enteric nervous system and neurons in the brain.  Release of CCK is stimulated by monitor peptide released by pancreatic acinar cells as well as CCK-releasing protein, a paracrine factor secreted by enterocytes in the gastrointestinal mucosa.  In addition, release of acetylcholine by the parasympathetic nerve fibers of the vagus nerve also stimulate its secretion.  The presence of fatty acids and/or certain amino acids in the [[chyme]] entering the [[duodenum]] is the greatest stimulator of CCK release. 

CCK mediates digestion in the small intestine by inhibiting gastric emptying and [[gastric acid]] secretion.  It stimulates the [[acinar cells]] of the [[pancreas]] to release digestive enzymes and stimulates the secretion of a juice rich in pancreatic [[digestive enzymes]], hence the old name ''pancreozymin''. Together these  enzymes catalyze the digestion of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Thus, as the levels of the substances that stimulated the release of CCK drop, the concentration of the hormone drops as well. The release of CCK is also inhibited by [[somatostatin]]. Trypsin, a protease released by pancreatic acinar cells hydrolyzes CCK-releasing peptide and monitor peptide effectively turning off the additional signals to secrete CCK.

CCK also causes the increased production of hepatic bile, and stimulates the contraction of the [[gall bladder]] and the relaxation of the [[Sphincter of Oddi]] (Glisson's sphincter), resulting in the delivery of [[bile]] into the duodenal part of the small intestine. [[Bile salt]]s form [[Amphipathic lipids|amphipathic]] [[micelle]]s that [[emulsification|emulsify]] fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption.

===Neurobiology===
As a [[neuropeptide]], CCK mediates satiety by acting on the [[CCK receptor]]s distributed widely throughout the [[central nervous system]]. In humans, it has been suggested that CCK administration causes [[nausea]] and [[anxiety]], and induces a satiating effect.  CCK-4 is routinely used to induce anxiety in humans though certainly different forms of CCK are being shown to have highly variable effects.<ref name="pmid9855480">{{cite journal | author=Greenough A, Cole G, Lewis J, Lockton A, Blundell J | title = Untangling the effects of hunger, anxiety, and nausea on energy intake during intravenous cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) infusion | journal=Physiol.

The effects of CCK vary between individuals. For example, in [[rat]]s, CCK administration significantly reduces hunger in young males, but is slightly less effective in older subjects, and even slightly less effective in females. The hunger-suppressive effects of CCK also are reduced in obese rats.<ref name="pmid9835394">{{cite journal | author=Fink H, Rex A, Voits M, Voigt JP | title = Major biological actions of CCK—a critical evaluation of research findings | journal=Exp Brain Res | volume = 123 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 77–83 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9835394 | doi = 10.1007/s002210050546 }}</ref>

==Interactions==
Cholecystokinin has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with the Cholecystokinin A receptor located mainly on pancreatic acinar cells and [[Cholecystokinin B receptor]] mostly in the brain and stomach.

CCK has also been shown to interact with [[calcineurin]] in the pancreas.  Calcineurin will go on to activate the transcription factors [[NFAT]] 1–3, which will stimulate [[hypertrophy]] and growth of the pancreas.  CCK can be stimulated by a diet high in protein, or by [[protease inhibitors]].<ref name="pmid17978097">{{cite journal | author = Gurda GT, Guo L, Lee SH, Molkentin JD, Williams JA | title = Cholecystokinin activates pancreatic calcineurin-NFAT signaling in vitro and in vivo | journal = Mol.

Cholecystokinin in the body cannot cross the [[blood brain barrier]], but certain parts of the [[hypothalamus]] and brainstem aren't protected by the barrier.

In the hypothalamus, CCK8 injection excites CRF neurosecretory neurons in par ventricular nucleus that is different cell responsive to pain stimulation:They show slow a 1 sec-hyperpolarizaiton with subsequent long (30min) depolarization to CCK8 injection (psychological stress), whereas tail pinch (physical stress), transient excitation. Consistently, in the cerebellum, Golgi cells express c-fos mRNA to CCK8 injection, whereas granule cells express junD mRNA to capsaicin injection to the limb skin. Thus, psychological and physical stress excite different neural path.
