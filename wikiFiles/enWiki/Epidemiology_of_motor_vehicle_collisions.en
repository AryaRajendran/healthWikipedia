Modern accident statistics often focus on reportable injury accidents (which include deaths) rather than reporting on deaths alone. It is believed that serious accidents are often significantly under-reported, under-recorded and misclassified<ref name =trl173>{{cite book | title = Comparison of hospital and police casualty data: a national study | edition = TRL Report 173 | publisher = [[Transport Research Laboratory]] | last = Simpson | first = H F | quote = there may be 2.76 times as many seriously injured casualties than are recorded in the national casualty figures and 1.70 slight casualties }}</ref> and that the completeness of reporting may vary over time and between sources.<ref name=bmj>{{ cite web | publisher = [[British medical Journal]] | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7558/73 | date = 2006-06-23 | title = Changes in safety on England's roads: analysis of hospital statistics | last = Gill, Goldacre, & Yeates}}</ref>

Road toll figures in developed nations show that car collision fatalities have declined since 1980. Japan is an extreme [[List of motor vehicle deaths in Japan by year|example]], with road deaths decreasing to 5,115 in 2008, which is 25% of the 1970 rate per capita and 17% of the 1970 rate per vehicle distance travelled. In 2008, for the first time, more pedestrians than vehicle occupants were killed in Japan by cars.<ref>[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/pedestrians-become-chief-victims-of-road-accident-deaths-in-2008 Pedestrians become chief victims of road accident deaths in 2008]</ref> Besides improving general road conditions like lighting and separated walkways, Japan has been installing [[intelligent transportation system]] technology such as stalled-car monitors to avoid crashes.

In developing nations, statistics may be grossly inaccurate or hard to get. Some nations have not significantly reduced the total death rate, which stands at 12,000 in Thailand in 2007, for example.<ref>[http://en.thaihealth.or.th/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=133&Itemid=1 365 Days for Stopping Accident Deaths]</ref>

In the United States, twenty-eight states had reductions in the number of automobile accident fatalities between 2005 and 2006.<ref>[http://www.autoaccidentattorneys.net/injuries/auto-death-state.html People Killed in Motor Vehicle Crashes, by State, 2005-2006]</ref> 55% of vehicle occupants 16 years or older in 2006 were not using [[seat belts]] when they crashed.<ref>{{cite book | title = NCSA Research Note (DOT-HS-810-948) | publisher = US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |month=May | year=2008}}</ref>

Road fatality trends tend to follow [[Smeed's law]],<ref name=smeed>{{cite web | url = http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/smeed%27s%20law.pdf | format = PDF | first = John | last = Adams | publisher = [[University College London]] | title = Smeed's Law : some further thoughts }}</ref> an empirical schema that correlates increased fatality rates per capita with traffic congestion.

== Proportion of deaths by type of impact ==
[[File:Escort wreck 006.jpg|thumb|A [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]] that was involved in a head-on collision]]
Crashes are categorized by what is struck and the direction of impact, or impacts. These are some common crash types, based on the total number that occurred in the U.S.A. in 2005, the percentage of total crashes, and the percentage of fatal crashes:<ref>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Traffic Safety Facts 2005, 2007, P. 54. http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/TSF2006.PDF</ref>{{dead link|date=October 2010}}

* [[Rear-end collision|Rear impacts]] (1,824,000 crashes, 29.6% of all US crashes, 5.4% of US fatal crashes)

* [[Side collision|Angle or side impacts]] (1,779,000 crashes, 28.9% of all US crashes, 20.7% of US fatal crashes)

* [[Run-off-road collision]]s (992,000 crashes, 16.1% of US crashes, 31.7% of US fatal crashes)

* Collisions with animals (275,000 crashes, 4.5% of US crashes, 0.4% of fatal crashes)

* [[Rollover]]s (141,000 crashes, 2.3% of all US crashes, 10.9% of US fatal crashes)

* [[Head-on collision]] (123,000 crashes, only 2.0% of all US crashes, but 10.1% of US fatal crashes)

* Collisions with pedestrians and bicyclists (114,000 crashes, only 1.8% of US crashes, but 13.5% of US fatal crashes)

* [[Back-up collision]]s killed 221 people in the US in 2007, and injured about 14,400. This is one of the most common types of non-traffic auto collision in which road workers and children 15 and younger are killed.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/automobiles/12VIEW.html?ref=automobiles ''The Risk of Reverse'']. [[New York Times]] 10 April 2009.</ref><ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.cdc.gov/Niosh/pdfs/01-128.pdf Building Safer Highway Work Zones: Measures to Prevent Worker Injuries From Vehicles and Equipment]}} [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]], April 2001.</ref>

Rollover, head-on, pedestrian, and bicyclist crashes combined are only 6.1% of all crashes, but cause 34.5% of traffic-related fatalities.

Sometimes the vehicles in the collision can suffer more than one type of impact, such as during a shunt or high-speed spin. This is called a "second harmful event," such as when a vehicle is redirected by the first crash into another vehicle or fixed object.
