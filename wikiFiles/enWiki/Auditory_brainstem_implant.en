An '''auditory brainstem implant''' (ABI) is a surgically implanted electronic device that provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf, due to [[sensorineural hearing impairment]] (due to illness or injury damaging the [[cochlea]] or [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|auditory nerve]], and so precluding the use of a [[cochlear implant]]).

The auditory brain stem implant uses similar technology as the [[cochlear implant]], but instead of electrical stimulation being used to stimulate the cochlea, it is instead used to stimulate the brain stem of the recipient.

Only about a thousand recipients have been implanted with an auditory brain stem implant, due to the nature of the surgery required to implant the device (as it requires [[Neurosurgery|brain surgery]] to implant the device) and the reduced effectiveness of the implant (most auditory brain stem implant recipients only have an awareness of sound - recipients won't be able to hear musical melodies, only the beat).<ref>[http://news.google.co.in/newspapers?id=u1slAAAAIBAJ&sjid=raIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4329,3959014&dq=auditory+brainstem+implant+cochlear+similar&hl=en] [[Reading Eagle]], Feb 25, 1993</ref> 

In the United States ABIs are only approved for adults (18 & over) and only for patients with [[neurofibromatosis type II]] (NF2).
In Europe, ABIs have been used in children and adults, and in patients with NF2 as well as other auditory complications, such as auditory nerve aplasia and cochlea ossification.<ref name = "Colletti 2004">Colletti et al. 2004, Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI): New frontiers in adults and Children,''Otolarangol head neck surg''</ref> Speech perception in non-NF2 patients on average has been reported to be higher than that of NF2 patients.<ref name = "Colletti 2005">Colletti and Shannon 2005, Open Set Speech Perception with Auditory Brainstem Implant?

==Implant history==
The auditory brainstem was first implanted in humans in 1979 at the House Ear Institute, CA, USA.<ref name="Edgerton 1982">Edgerton et al. 1982, Hearing by cochlear nucleus stimulation in humans, ''Ann Otol Rhinol''</ref><ref name="House 2001">House and Hitselberger 2001, Twenty year report of the first auditory brain stem nucleus implant, ''Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol''</ref> This original ABI consisted of two ball electrodes which were implanted near the surface of the cochlear nucleus. A change from a percutaneous connection to a wireless transcutaneous connection, and from ball electrodes to flat electrodes were the only changes to the implant until 1991, where 25 people had received the ABI.<ref name = "Brackmann 1993">Brackmann et al. 1993, Auditory brainstem implant: I. Issues in surgical implantation, ''Otol Head Neck Surg''</ref>

In the US in 1992 an eight electrode implant developed by Cochlear Limited, the House Ear Institute and Huntington Medical Research Institute.<ref name = "Otto 1998">Otto et al. 1998, The Multichannel Auditory Brainstem Implant: Performance in Twenty Patients, ''Otol Head Neck Surg''</ref> An electrode array with 21 electrodes developed by Cochlear Limited was developed for the European market at the same time.<ref name = "Laszig 1991">Laszig et al. 1991, The Hanover Auditory Brainstem Implant: A Multiple-electrode prosthesis, ''European Arch Otol Rhinol Laryngol''</ref> The processor for both the eight and 20 electrode implants used Nucleus 22 ABI (Cochlear Limited) external speech processors. Since 1999 a 21 electrode array implant has been used with the Nucleus 24 ABI (Cochlear Limited) speech processor.

A 12 electrode array implant with a speech processor based on the C40+ cochlear implant (Med-El)<ref name = "Jackson et al. 2002">Jackson et al. 2002, An auditory Brainstem Implant System, ''Am J Audiol''</ref> and a 16 electrode array implant with the Clarion-1.2 cochlear implant (Advanced Bionics)<ref name = "Lenartz 2001">Lenarz et al. 2001, Auditory Brainstem Implant: Part 1. Performance and its Evolution Over Time, ''Otol Neurotol''</ref> have also been developed.
