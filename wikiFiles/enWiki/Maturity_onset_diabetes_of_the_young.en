MODY is often referred to as "'''monogenic diabetes'''" to distinguish it from the more common types of diabetes (especially [[type 1 diabetes mellitus|type 1]] and [[type 2 diabetes mellitus|type 2]]), which involve more complex combinations of causes involving multiple genes (i.e., "polygenic") and environmental factors. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most common forms. "Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is  a rare autosomal dominant form of type 2 DM affecting young people with a positive family history."<ref>This page has previously claimed that MODY is equivalent to type 1 DM; however, the [[Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine]] states the above.</ref> MODY should not be confused with latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) &mdash; a form of type 1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence in later life.

==History of the concept and treatment of MODY==
The term MODY dates back to 1964, when diabetes mellitus was considered to have two main forms: juvenile-onset and maturity-onset, which roughly corresponded to what we now call type 1 and type 2. MODY was originally applied to any child or young adult who had persistent, asymptomatic [[hyperglycemia]] without progression to [[diabetic ketosis]] or [[diabetic ketoacidosis|ketoacidosis]]. In retrospect we can now recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of hyperglycemia (e.g., [[mitochondrial diabetes]] or [[mutant insulin]]). Many of these patients were treated with [[sulfonylurea]]s with varying degrees of success. 

The current usage of the term MODY dates from a case report published in 1974.<ref name=Tattersall1974>{{cite journal | author = Tattersall RB | year = 1974 | title = Mild familial diabetes with dominant inheritance | url = | journal = Q J Med | volume = 43 | issue = 170| pages = 339–357 }}</ref> This milder form of diabetes had been recognised in the pre-insulin period. This was forgotten possibly because of [[Elliott P. Joslin]]'s dictum that all young people with diabetes should be treated with insulin. With the introduction of sulphonylureas in the 1950s it was found that [[tolbutamide]] could improve or normalize carbohydrate tolerance in some young non-obese mildly diabetic patients. The genetic basis was overlooked because it was thought that diabetes was a homogeneous disease with young and old patients forming part of the same continuum. In 1973 Fajans{{who?|date=July 2012}} had shown that the carbohydrate intolerance of 45 patients diagnosed under age 25 had not progressed after up to 16 years on sulphonylureas and that 43 out of 45 of these subjects had a first-degree relative with diabetes. In the same year Lestradet{{who?|date=July 2012}} described a non-insulin-dependent form of childhood diabetes which was later established to be dominantly inherited. In 1974 Tattersall{{who?|date=July 2012}} described three families in which diabetes, although diagnosed in adolescence, could be treated with sulphonylureas over 40 years later and was dominantly inherited. Also in 1974 Tattersall and Fajans coined the acronym MODY which was defined as 'fasting hyperglycaemia diagnosed under age 25 which could be treated without insulin for more than two years'.

By the 1990s, as the understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes has improved, the concept and usage of MODY have become refined and narrower. It is now used as a synonym for dominantly inherited, monogenic defects of insulin secretion occurring at any age, and no longer includes any forms of type 2 diabetes.

==Signs, symptoms and differential diagnosis==

Currently,{{When|date=May 2012}} MODY is the final diagnosis in 1%&ndash;2% of people initially diagnosed with diabetes. The prevalence is 70–110 per million population. 50% of first-degree relatives will inherit the same mutation, giving them a greater than 95% lifetime risk of developing MODY themselves. For this reason, correct diagnosis of this condition is important. Typically patients present with a strong family history of diabetes (any type) and the onset of symptoms is in the second to fifth decade. 

There are two general types of clinical presentation. 

* Some forms of MODY produce significant [[hyperglycemia]] and the typical signs and [http://diabetesdirectory.org/symptoms-of-diabetes/ symptoms of diabetes]: increased thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria).
* In contrast, many people with MODY have no signs or symptoms and are diagnosed either by accident, when a high glucose is discovered during testing for other reasons, or [[medical screening|screening]] of relatives of a person discovered to have diabetes. Discovery of mild hyperglycemia during a routine [[glucose tolerance test]] for [[pregnancy]] is particularly characteristic.

MODY cases may make up as many as 5% of presumed type 1 and type 2 diabetes cases in a large clinic population. While the goals of diabetes management are the same no matter what type, there are two primary advantages of confirming a diagnosis of MODY. 
* Insulin may not be necessary and it may be possible to switch a person from insulin injections to oral agents without loss of [[Diabetes management#Glycemic control|glycemic control]].
* It may prompt screening of relatives and so help identify other cases in family members.

As it occurs infrequently, many cases of MODY are initially assumed to be more common forms of diabetes: type 1 if the patient is young and not overweight, type 2 if the patient is overweight, or [[gestational diabetes]] if the patient is pregnant. Standard diabetes treatments (insulin for type 1 and gestational diabetes, and [[oral hypoglycemic agent]]s for type 2) are often initiated before the doctor suspects a more unusual form of diabetes.

===Treatment===

In some forms of MODY, standard treatment is appropriate, though exceptions occur:

* In MODY2, oral agents are relatively ineffective and insulin is unnecessary.
* In MODY1 and MODY3, insulin may be more effective than drugs to increase insulin sensitivity.
* [[Sulfonylurea]]s are effective in the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel forms of neonatal-onset diabetes.

===Presentation===
The following characteristics suggest the possibility of a diagnosis of MODY in hyperglycemic and diabetic patients:
* Mild to moderate hyperglycemia (typically 130–250&nbsp;mg/dl, or 7–14&nbsp;mmol/l) discovered before 30 years of age. However, anyone under 50 can develop MODY.<ref>{{cite report|title=MODY|url=http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14047009.php | accessdate=Jan 25, 2010 }}</ref>
* A first-degree relative with a similar degree of diabetes.
* Absence of positive antibodies or other [[autoimmunity]] (e.g., [[thyroiditis]]) in patient and family.
* Persistence of a low insulin requirement (e.g., less than 0.5 u/kg/day) past the usual "[[Honeymoon period (diabetes)|honeymoon]]" period.
* Absence of obesity (although overweight or obese people can get MODY) or other problems associated with type 2 diabetes or [[metabolic syndrome]] (e.g., [[hypertension]], [[hyperlipidemia]], [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]).<ref>{{cite study|title=Maturity Onset Diabetes|publisher=SparkPeople|url=http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/health_a-z_detail.asp?AZ=595 | accessdate=Jan 21 2010 }}</ref>
* [[Insulin resistance]] very rarely happens.<ref>{{cite report|title=MODY|publisher=Harvard|url=http://harvardatoz.demo.staywellsolutionsonline.com/71,AZ_d0523 | accessdate=January 23, 2010 }}</ref>
* Cystic [[kidney]] disease in patient or close relatives.
* Non-transient [[neonatal diabetes]], or apparent [[type 1 diabetes mellitus|type 1 diabetes]] with onset before six months of age.
* Liver adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma in MODY type 3<ref>{{cite report|title=A missense TCF1 mutation in a patient with MODY-3 and liver adenomatosis|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2972616/ | accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> 
* Renal cysts, rudimentary or bicornuate uterus, vaginal aplasia, absence of the vas deferens, epidymal cysts in MODY type 5<ref>{{cite report|title=Renal Cysts and Diabetes Syndrome|url=http://www.omim.org/clinicalSynopsis/137920?search=(number:(137920%20189907)) | accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>

The diagnosis of MODY is confirmed by specific [[gene]] testing available through commercial laboratories.

==Pathophysiology==
The recognised forms of MODY are all due to ineffective insulin production or release by [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[beta cell]]s. Several of the defects are [[mutation]]s of [[transcription factor]] [[gene]]s. One form is due to mutations of the [[glucokinase]] gene. For each form of MODY, multiple specific mutations involving different [[amino acid]] substitutions have been discovered. In some cases, there are significant differences in the activity of the mutant gene product that contribute to variations in the clinical features of the diabetes (such as degree of insulin deficiency or age of onset).

==Genetics==
Some sources make a distinction between two forms of monogenetic diabetes: MODY and neonatal diabetes.<ref name="Poretsky2008">{{cite book|author=Leonid Poretsky |title=Principles of Diabetes Mellitus|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ffyJZLp4l9gC&pg=PA221|accessdate=12 June 2010|date=December 2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-09840-1|pages=221–}}</ref> However, they have much in common and are often studied together.

===Heterozygous===
MODY is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion, and most patients therefore have other members of the family with diabetes; [[penetrance]] differs between the types (from 40% to 90%).

===Homozygous===
By definition, the forms of MODY are autosomal dominant, requiring only one abnormal gene to produce the disease; the severity of the disease is moderated by the presence of a second, normal allele which presumably functions normally. However, conditions involving people carrying two abnormal alleles have been identified.<ref name="KumarWeatherall2008">{{cite book|author1=Dhavendra Kumar|author2=D. J. Weatherall|title=Genomics and clinical medicine|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BbeWA-gbiiwC&pg=PA184|accessdate=12 June 2010|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-518813-4|pages=184–}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, combined (homozygous) defects of these genes are much rarer and much more severe in their effects.

*MODY2: Homozygous glucokinase deficiency causes severe congenital insulin deficiency resulting in persistent [[neonatal diabetes mellitus]]. About 6 cases have been reported worldwide. All have required insulin treatment from shortly after birth. The condition does not seem to improve with age.
*MODY4: Homozygous IPF1 results in failure of the pancreas to form. Congenital absence of the pancreas, termed [[pancreatic agenesis]], involves deficiency of both endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas.

Homozygous mutations in the other forms have not yet been described. Those mutations for which a homozygous form has not been described may be extremely rare, may result in clinical problems not yet recognized as connected to the monogenic disorder, or may be lethal for a fetus and not result in a viable child.

==Management==
Unfortunately, chronic hyperglycemia of any cause can eventually cause blood vessel damage and the [[microvascular complications of diabetes]]. The principal treatment goals for people with MODY &mdash; keeping the blood sugars as close to normal as possible ("good [[Diabetes management#Glycemic control|glycemic control]]"), while minimizing other vascular risk factors &mdash; are the same for all known forms of diabetes.

Tools for management are those for all forms of diabetes: blood testing, changes in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], physical [[exercise]], [[oral hypoglycemic agent]]s, and insulin injections. In many cases these goals can be achieved more easily with MODY than with ordinary types 1 and 2 diabetes. Some people with MODY may require insulin injections to achieve the same [[Diabetes management#Glycemic control|glycemic control]] that another person may attain with careful eating or an oral medication. 

When oral hypoglycemic agents are used in MODY, the sulfonylureas remain the oral medication of first resort. When compared to patients with type 2 diabetes, MODY patients are often more sensitive to sulphonylureas, such that a lower dose should be used to initiate treatment to avoid hypoglycaemia. Patients with MODY less often suffer from obesity and [[insulin resistance]] than those with ordinary type 2 diabetes (for whom insulin sensitizers like [[metformin]] or the [[thiazolidinedione]]s are often preferred over the sulfonylureas).

==Incidence==
According to data from Saxony, Germany, MODY was responsible for 2.4% of diabetes incidence in children younger than 15 years.<ref name="urlIncidence of Childhood Diabetes in Children Aged Less than 15 Years and Its Clinical and Metabolic Characteristics at the Time of Diagnosis: Data from the Childhood Diabetes Registry of Saxony, Germany">{{cite web |url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?doi=10.1159/000303141 |title=Incidence of Childhood Diabetes in Children Aged Less than 15 Years and Its Clinical and Metabolic Characteristics at the Time of Diagnosis: Data from the Childhood Diabetes Registry of Saxony, Germany |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref>
