'''Visual agnosia''' is an impairment in recognition of visually presented objects. It is not due to a deficit in vision (acuity, visual field, and scanning), language, memory, or low intellect.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Delvenne, J. F., Seron, X., Coyette, F., & Rossion | year = 2004 | title = Evidence for Perceptual Deficits in Associative Visual (Prosop)agnosia: A Single-case Study | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 597–612 | doi =  }}</ref> There are two types of visual agnosia: apperceptive agnosia and associative agnosia.

Recognition of visual objects occurs at two primary levels. At apperceptive level, the features of the visual information from the retina is put together to form a perceptual representation of an object. At associative level, the meaning of an object is attached to the perceptual representation and the object is identified.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Riddoch, M. J., Humphreys, G. W. | year = 1987 | title = A Case of Integrative Visual Agnosia | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 110 | issue = | pages = 1431–1462 | doi =  }}</ref> If a person is unable to recognize objects because he cannot perceive correct forms of the objects, although their knowledge of the objects is intact, it is apperceptive agnosia. If a person correctly perceives the forms and has knowledge of the objects, but cannot identify the objects, it is associative agnosia.

Visual agnosia is often due to bilateral damage in the posterior [[occipital lobe|occipital]] and/or [[temporal lobe]](s) in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Karnath H. O., Rüter J., Mandler A., Himmelbach M. | year = 2009 | title = The anatomy of object recognition—Visual form agnosia caused by medial occipitotemporal stroke | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 18| pages = 5854–5862 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5192-08.2009 }}</ref>

== Classification ==

The two major types of visual [[agnosia]] are apperceptive and associative visual agnosia.

Apperceptive agnosia is failure of object recognition even when the basic visual functions (acuity, color, motion) are normal.<ref name="Kolb, B. 2009">Kolb, B. & Whishaw, I. Q. (2009). "Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology 6th ed.'' New York, NY., [[Worth Publishers]]. ISBN 978-0-7167-9586-5.</ref> The brain must correctly integrate such features as lines, brightness, and color of visual information to form a whole percept of an object. If a failure occurs during this process, a percept of an object is not fully formed and thus it cannot be recognized.<ref name="Heilman, K. M. 2002">Heilman, K. M. (2002). "Matter of Mind.'' New York, NY., [[Oxford University Press]]. ISBN 978-0-19-514490-1.</ref> Tasks requiring copying or matching simple figures can distinguish the individuals with apperceptive agnosia because they have impaired abilities and cannot perform such tasks.

Associative agnosia is an inability to identify objects even with apparent perception and knowledge of them. It involves a higher level of processing than apperceptive agnosia.<ref name="Kolb, B. 2009"/> Individuals with associative agnosia can copy or match simple figures, indicating that they can perceive objects correctly. They also display the knowledge of objects when tested with tactile or verbal information. However, when tested visually, they cannot name or describe common objects.<ref name="Heilman, K. M. 2002"/> This means that there is an impairment in associating the perception of objects with the stored knowledge of them.

Known clinical variants of visual agnosia include prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces), pure word blindness (inability to recognize  words), agnosias for colors (inability to differentiate colors), agnosias for the environment (inability to recognize landmarks etc.) and simultanagosia (inability to sort out multiple objects in a visual scene).<ref>Biran I. and Coslett H.B. (2003). Visual Agnosia.Current neurology and neuroscience reports, 3(6):508 - 512. ISSN 1528-4042. {{doi|10.1007/s11910-003-0055-4}}</ref>

===  Categories and subtypes of visual agnosia ===

The two main categories of visual agnosia are:

*[[Apperceptive agnosia|Apperceptive visual agnosia]], impaired object recognition. Individuals with apperceptive visual agnosia cannot form a whole percept of visual information.<ref name="Ferreira,1998">{{cite journal |author=Ferreira CT, Ceccaldi M, Giusiano B, Poncet M |title=Separate visual pathways for perception of actions and objects: evidence from a case of apperceptive visual agnosia |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=382–5 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9728957 |pmc=2170224 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.65.3.382 |url=}}</ref>
*[[Associative visual agnosia]], impaired object identification. Individuals with associative agnosia cannot give a meaning to a formed percept. The percept is created, but it would have no meaning for individuals who have an associative agnosia.<ref name="Ferreira,1998"/>

:;Subtypes of Associative Visual Agnosia:
:*[[Achromatopsia]], an inability to distinguish different colors.[[color]].<ref name="Kolb, B. 2009"/>
:*[[Prosopagnosia]], an inability recognize of human faces.<ref>Wolfe, Jeremy (2012). "Sensation & Perception" 3rd ed.'' pp. 507 ISBN 978-0-87893-876-6.</ref> Individuals with prosopagnosia know that they are looking at faces, but cannot recognize who they are, even whom they know well.<ref name="Carlson, 2010"/>
:*Orientation Agnosia: an inability to judge or determine orientation of objects.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harris, I. M., Harris, J. A., Caine, D. | year = 2001 | title = Object Orientation Agnosia: A Failure to Find the Axis? | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 800–812 | doi = 10.1162/08989290152541467 }}</ref>
:*Pantomime Agnosia: an inability to understand pantomimes (gestures). It appears that the inferior cortical visual cortex is critical in recognizing pantomimes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rothi LJ, Mack L, Heilman KM |title=Pantomime agnosia |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=451–4 |year=1986 |month=April |pmid=3701356 |pmc=1028777 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.4.451 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/49/4/451.full.pdf}}</ref>

== Symptoms==

While most cases of visual agnosia are seen in older adults who have had extensive brain damage, there are also cases of young children with less brain damage during developmental years acquiring the symptoms.<ref name=Funnel>{{cite journal|last=Funnel|first=Elaine|coauthors=John Wilding|title=Development of a vocabulary of object shapes in a child  with a very-early-acquired visual agnosia: A unique case|journal=The Quarterly Journal Of Experimental Psychology|year=2011|volume=64|series=2|pages=261–282|doi=10.1080/17470218.2010.498922}}</ref> Commonly, visual agnosia presents as an inability to recognize an object by its shape, in the absence of other explanations, such as vision problems. This is most easily seen in prosopagnosia, where the individual can clearly see the faces of those people nearby, but is unable to draw the mental connections and recognize the person. Another common manifestation of visual agnosia is a difficulty to identify objects that look similar in shape, difficulty with line drawings that lack much detail, and recognizing objects that are shown from less common views.<ref name=Funnel />

Visual agnosia occurs after damage to the visual association cortex.<ref name="Carlson, 2010">{{cite book |author=Carlson, Neil R. |title=Physiology of behavior |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston, Mass |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-205-66627-2 |oclc=263605380 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  This occurs even when no damage has been done to the eyes or optic tract that leads visual information into the brain.  Visual agnosia is caused by damage to parts of the ventral stream of vision.<ref name="Carlson, 2010"/>  The ventral stream is also known as the "what pathway of vision" because this pathway allows the individual to identify they objects they see.  The other stream is the dorsal stream or "where/how" pathway; and this pathway remains undisturbed, allowing individuals with visual agnosia to show relatively normal visually guided behavior.<ref name=Goodale1991>{{cite journal |author=Goodale MA, Milner AD, Jakobson LS, Carey DP |title=A neurological dissociation between perceiving objects and grasping them |journal=Nature |volume=349 |issue=6305 |pages=154–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1986306 |doi=10.1038/349154a0}}</ref><ref name=Goodale1992>{{cite journal |author=Goodale MA, Milner AD |title=Separate visual pathways for perception and action |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=20–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1374953 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(92)90344-8}}</ref>  Damage to specific areas of the ventral stream impair the ability to recognize certain categories of visual information.<ref name="Carlson, 2010"/>

==Pathophysiology==
Visual agnosia occurs due to damage in the association areas of the visual cortex.  The lateral occipital complex appears to respond to many different types of objects.<ref name="Carlson, 2010"/>  Prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces) is due to damage of the fusiform face area (FFA). Studies with functional imaging show that there is a certain area specialized for facial recognition, known as the fusiform face area, in the fusiform gyrus of the temporal lobe.<ref name="Carlson, 2010"/>  However, this area is not exclusive to faces; recognition of other objects of expertise are also processed in this area.  The extrastriate body cortex (EBA) was found to be activated by photographs, silhouettes, or stick drawings of human bodies.<ref name="Carlson, 2010"/>  The parahippocampal place area (PPA) of the limbic cortex has been found to be activated by the sight of scenes and backgrounds.<ref name="Carlson, 2010"/>  Cerebral achromatopsia (the inability to discriminate between different hues) is caused by damage to the V8 area of the visual association cortex.<ref name="Carlson, 2010"/>
The left hemisphere seems to play a critical role in recognizing the meaning of common objects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCarthy RA, Warrington EK |title=Visual associative agnosia: a clinico-anatomical study of a single case |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=49 |issue=11 |pages=1233–40 |year=1986 |month=November |pmid=3794729 |pmc=1029070 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.11.1233 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/49/11/1233.full.pdf}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==

* The murder suspect in the ''[[Picket Fences]]'' episode "Strangers" supposedly suffered from agnosia.
* The patient in the ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' episode "[[Adverse Events]]" suffered from agnosia.
* Val Kilmer's character suffers from visual agnosia in the film ''[[At First Sight]]''.
* A peculiar type of visual agnosia resulting from experimental brain surgery drives the plot of the 6th volume of [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]'' series.
* In ''[[Saya no Uta]]'', the protagonist undergoes drastic emergency brain surgery to save his life from a fatal traffic accident that kills his parents. As a side effect of this life-saving surgery, the protagonist is left with a bizarre form of visual agnosia that makes the world appear to him as "warped", where non-organic objects resemble organic structures of putrid flesh and people appear to be monsters to him.
*In the comic book series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', a one eyed waitress named Lori has visual agnosia.
