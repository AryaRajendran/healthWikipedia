'''Metallo-beta-lactamase-1''' ('''NDM-1''')<ref name=Kumarasamy/> is an [[enzyme]] that makes [[bacteria]] [[Antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to a broad range of [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s. These include the antibiotics of the [[carbapenem]] family, which are a mainstay for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. The gene for NDM-1 is one member of a large [[gene family]] that encodes [[beta-lactamase]] [[enzyme]]s called [[Beta-lactamase#Carbapenemases|carbapenemases]]. Bacteria that produce carbapenemases are often referred to in the news media as "[[Antibiotic resistance|superbugs]]" because infections caused by them are difficult to treat. Such bacteria are usually susceptible only to [[polymyxin]]s and [[tigecycline]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2009/news2609.htm#ndm1 |title=Health Protection Report |publisher=Health Protection Agency |date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=}}</ref>

NDM-1 was first detected in a ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' isolate from a [[Sweden|Swedish]] patient of [[India]]n origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], <ref>{{cite news

The most common bacteria that make this enzyme are [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', but the gene for NDM-1 can spread from one strain of bacteria to another by [[horizontal gene transfer]].

==Enzyme function==

[[Image:Carbapenem.svg|thumb|200px|Structure of the carbapenem backbone.]]
[[Carbapenem]]s are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that are capable of killing most bacteria by inhibiting the synthesis of one of their [[cell wall]] layers. The carbapenems were developed to overcome antibiotic resistance mediated by bacterial [[beta-lactamase]] enzymes. However, the ''bla''<sub>NDM-1</sub> gene produces NDM-1, which is a [[carbapenemase]] beta-lactamase - an [[enzyme]] that [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] and inactivates these carbapenem antibiotics.

Carbapenemases are particularly dangerous resistance mechanisms, since they can inactivate a wide range of different antibiotics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Queenan AM, Bush K |title=Carbapenemases: the versatile beta-lactamases |journal=Clin.

The resistance conferred by this gene (bla<sub>NDM-1</sub>), therefore, aids the expansion of bacteria that carry it throughout a human host, since they will face less [[Interspecific competition|opposition/competition]] from populations of antibiotic-sensitive bacteria, which will be diminished by the original antibacterial treatment.

== Origin and spread ==

The NDM-1 enzyme was named after [[New Delhi]], the capital city of [[India]], as it was first described by Yong et al. in December 2009 in a Swedish national who fell ill with an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection that he acquired in India.<ref name=Yong>{{cite journal

The authors concluded that the new resistance mechanism "clearly arose in India, but there are few data arising from India to suggest how widespread it is".<ref name=Yong/> Its exact geographical origin, however, has not been conclusively verified. In March 2010, a study in a hospital in [[Mumbai]] found that most carbapenem-resistant bacteria isolated from patients carried the ''bla''<sub>NDM-1</sub> gene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deshpande Payal, Rodrigues Camilla, Shetty Anjali, Kapadia Farhad, Hedge Ashit, Soman Rajeev |title= Metallo-β lactamase (NDM-1) in Enterobacteriaceae: Treatment options with Carbapenems Compromised |journal=Journal of Association of Physicians of India |volume=58 |pages=147–150 |year=2010 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.japi.org/march_2010/article_02.html}}</ref>

In May 2010, a case of infection with ''E. coli'' expressing NDM-1 was reported in [[Coventry]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Muir A, Weinbren MJ |title= metallo-beta-lactamase: a cautionary tale |journal=J.

{{As of|2010|06}}, there were three reported cases of [[Enterobacteriaceae]] isolates bearing this newly described resistance mechanism in the US, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) stated that "All three U.S. isolates were from patients having received recent medical care in India."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5924a5.htm |title=Detection of Enterobacteriaceae Isolates Carrying Metallo-Beta-Lactamase --- United States, 2010 |work=MMWR |publisher=Centers for Disease Control}}</ref> However, US experts stated that it is unclear as to whether this strain is any more dangerous than existing antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]], which are already common in the USA.<ref>{{cite news | first=Donald G. | last=McNeil Jr. | title=Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Moving From South Asia to U.S. | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/world/asia/12bug.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=11 August 2010 | accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>

In July 2010, a team in New Delhi reported a cluster of three cases of ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' bearing ''bla''<sub>NDM-1</sub> that were found in the intensive care unit of a hospital in [[Chennai]], India, in April 2010. As previously, the bacteria were fully resistant to all the aminoglycoside β-lactam and quinolone antibiotics, but were susceptible to tigecycline and colistin. This particularly broad spectrum of antibiotic resistance was heightened by the strain's expressing several different resistance genes in addition to ''bla''<sub>NDM-1</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karthikeyan K, Thirunarayan MA, Krishnan P |title=Coexistence of blaOXA-23 with blaNDM-1 and armA in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii from India |journal=J Antimicrob Chemother |volume= 65|issue= 10|pages= 2253–2254|year=2010 |month=July |pmid=20650909 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkq273 }}</ref>

A study by a multi-national team was published in the August 2010 issue of the journal ''[[The Lancet Infectious Diseases]]''. This examined the emergence and spread of bacteria carrying the ''bla''<sub>NDM-1</sub> gene.

On 6 September 2010, Japan detected its first ever case of the NDM-1 enzyme. In May 2009, a Japanese man in his 50s who had recently returned from vacation in India was struck with a fever and hospitalized, later making a full recovery.

==Phenotypic detection of NDM-1==
Detection of NDM-1 gene depends upon the phenotypic determination of the enzyme activity. These enzymes are zinc dependent and therefore termed as [[metallo beta lactamase]]. Indian studies have been done which demonstrate their dependency on zinc and the ability of zinc chelating agents like [[EDTA]] to decrease their activity. The [[Modified Hodge Test]] and a newly developed [[Re-Modified Hodge Test]] were developed for detection on a routine basis in resource limited laboratories,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rai|first=S|coauthors=Manchanda, V, Singh, NP, Kaur, IR|title=Zinc-dependent carbapenemases in clinical isolates of family Enterobacteriaceae.|journal=Indian journal of medical microbiology|date=2011 Jul-Sep|volume=29|issue=3|pages=275–9|pmid=21860109}}</ref>

==Indian response==
The [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Indian health ministry]] has disputed the conclusion of the August 2010 ''Lancet'' study that the gene originated in India, describing this conclusion as "unfair" and stating that Indian hospitals are perfectly safe for treatment.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news | first=Geeta | last=Pandey | title=India rejects UK scientists' 'superbug' claim | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10954890 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=12 August 2010 | accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7945894/Indian-Government-angry-over-claims-its-hospitals-are-fuelling-global-superbug.html Telegraph.co.uk: Indian Government angry over claims its hospitals are fuelling global superbug]</ref> Indian politicians have described linking this new drug resistance gene to India as "malicious propaganda" and blamed [[multinational corporation]]s for what they describe as selective malignancy.<ref name=BBC /><ref>{{cite news | title=Linking India to superbug unfair and wrong, says India | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Linking-India-to-superbug-unfair-and-wrong-says-India/Article1-585840.aspx | work=[[Hindustan Times]] | date=12 August 2010 | accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> A [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] politician has instead argued that the journal article is bogus and represented an attempt to scare medical tourists away from India.<ref>[http://expressbuzz.com/nation/superbug-an-mnc-conspiracy-bjp-leader/197607.html 'Superbug' an MNC conspiracy: BJP leader | SS Ahluwalia | superbug | Indian Express<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Indian Ministry of Health released a statement "strongly refut[ing]" naming the enzyme "New Delhi".<ref>{{cite news | first=Sanchita | last=Sharma | title='Don't blame superbug on India, it's everywhere' | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Don-t-blame-superbug-on-India-it-s-everywhere/Article1-585926.aspx | work=[[Hindustan Times]] | date=13 August 2010 | accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> A co-author of the 2010 ''Lancet'' study, who is based in the [[University of Madras]], has stated that he does not agree with the part of the article that advises people to avoid elective surgeries in India.<ref name=TOI>{{cite news | first=Pushpa | last=Narayan | title=Indian author says superbug report is fudged | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Indian-author-says-superbug-report-is-fudged/articleshow/6302479.cms | work=[[The Times of India]] | date=13 August 2010 | accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>

In contrast, an editorial in the March 2010 issue of the ''Journal of Association of Physicians of India'' blamed the emergence of this gene on the widespread misuse of antibiotics in the Indian healthcare system, stating that Indian doctors have "not yet taken the issue of antibiotic resistance seriously" and noting little control over the prescription of antibiotics by doctors and even pharmacists.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abdul Ghafur K |title=An obituary- On the Death of antibiotics! |journal=Journal of Association of Physicians of India |volume=58 |pages= |year=2010 |month=March |url=http://www.japi.org/march_2010/article_01.html}}</ref> The ''Times of India'' states that there is general agreement among experts that India needs both an improved policy to control the use of antibiotics and a central registry of antibiotic-resistant infections.<ref name=TOI/>

==''The Lancet'' apology and aftermath==
The British Journal 'The Lancet' refused to publish rebuttal from Indian National Centre for Disease Control, claiming lack of space and that editors' decision was that it was better placed elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article1692537.ece Lancet won't publish India's rebuttal], NEW DELHI, Special Correspondent, April 13 2011, thehindu.com</ref>

On 12 January 2011, the editor of ''The Lancet'', [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]], apologized and acknowledged that naming a superbug after New Delhi was an “error”.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Lancet-says-sorry-for-Delhi-bug-/articleshow/7261135.cms | title = Lancet says sorry for 'Delhi bug' | accessdate = 2011-01-12 | work = The Times Of India | date=12 January 2011}}</ref> Following this, [[Ajai R.

He proposed changing NDM-1 to PCM Plasmid-encoding Carbapenem-resistant Metallo-beta-Lactamase.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2011;volume=9;issue=1;spage=294;epage=319;aulast=Singh | title = Science, names giving and names calling: Change NDM-1 to PCM | accessdate = 2011-03-11 | work = Mens Sana Monographs}}</ref>

==First death==
In August 2010, the first reported death due to bacteria expressing the NDM-1 enzyme was recorded after a [[Belgium|Belgian]] man, who had become infected while being treated in a hospital in [[Pakistan]], died despite being administered [[colistin]]. A doctor involved in his treatment said: "He was involved in a car accident during a trip to Pakistan. He was hospitalised with a major leg injury and then repatriated to Belgium, but he was already infected".<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g2UVNIO5tUQAqbWeE7l2PjSW34cg AFP: Belgian man dies of South Asian superbug]</ref>
