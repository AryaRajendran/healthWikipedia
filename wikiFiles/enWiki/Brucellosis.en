'''Brucellosis''', also called '''Bang's disease''', '''Crimean fever''', '''Gibraltar fever''', '''Malta fever''', '''Maltese fever''', '''Mediterranean fever''', '''rock fever''', or '''undulant fever''',<ref>[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/brucellosis "Brucellosis" in the American Heritage Dictionary]</ref><ref>[http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/medical/maltese_fever.htm Maltese Fever] ''by wrongdiagnosis.com, last Update: 25 February 2009 (12:01)'', retrieved 2009-02-26</ref> is a highly contagious [[zoonosis]] caused by ingestion of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|unsterilized]] [[milk]] or [[meat]] from infected animals or close contact with their secretions. Transmission from human to human, through [[Human sexual activity|sexual contact]] or from mother to child, is rare but possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/brucellosis-pathway.pdf |title=Diagnosis and Management of Acute Brucellosis in Primary Care |year=2004 |month=August |publisher=Brucella Subgroup of the Northern Ireland Regional Zoonoses Group}}</ref> 

''[[Brucella]]'' spp. are small, [[Gram-negative]], non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod shaped ([[Coccobacillus|coccobacilli]]) bacteria. They function as [[Parasitic plant|facultative]] intracellular parasites causing chronic disease, which usually persists for life. Symptoms include profuse sweating and joint and muscle pain. Brucellosis has been recognized in animals including humans since the 20th century.

==History and nomenclature==
Under the name '''''Malta fever''''', the disease now called brucellosis first came to the attention of [[United Kingdom|British]] medical officers in the 1850s in Malta during the [[Crimean War]]. The causal relationship between organism and disease was first established in 1887 by Dr. [[David Bruce (microbiologist)|David Bruce]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Wilkinson, Lise| chapter= "Brucellosis" |editor=Kiple, Kenneth F. (ed.) |title=The Cambridge World History of Human Disease |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]])| year = 1993}}</ref><ref>{{WhoNamedIt2|synd|819|Brucellosis}} named after {{WhoNamedIt|doctor|871|Sir David Bruce}}</ref>

In 1897, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[veterinarian]] [[Bernhard Lauritz Frederik Bang|Bernhard Bang]] isolated ''[[Brucella abortus]]'' as the agent; and the additional name '''Bang's disease''' was assigned. 

[[Maltese people|Maltese]] doctor and archaeologist Sir [[Themistocles Zammit]] earned a [[knighthood]] for identifying [[Pasteurization|unpasteurized]] milk as the major source of the pathogen in 1905, and it has since become known as Malta Fever. In cattle, this disease is also known as '''contagious abortion''' and '''infectious abortion'''.

The popular name '''undulant fever''' originates from the characteristic undulance (or "wave-like" nature) of the fever, which rises and falls over weeks in untreated patients. In the 20th century, this name, along with ''brucellosis'' (after ''[[Brucella]]'', named for Dr. Bruce), gradually replaced the 19th century names '''Mediterranean fever''' and ''Malta fever''.

In 1989, [[neurologists]] in Saudi Arabia discovered '''neurobrucellosis''', a neurological involvement in brucellosis.<ref name=Ravi>{{cite journal |author=Malhotra, Ravi |year=2004 |title=Saudi Arabia| journal=Practical Neurology |volume=4 |pages=184–185 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-7766.2004.03-225.x |issue=3}}</ref><ref name="pmid15037461">{{cite journal |author=Al-Sous MW, Bohlega S, Al-Kawi MZ, Alwatban J, McLean DR |title=Neurobrucellosis: clinical and neuroimaging correlation |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=395–401 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15037461 |doi= |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15037461}}</ref>

==Brucellosis in animals==
Species infecting domestic livestock are ''B. melitensis'' (goats and sheep, see [[Brucella melitensis]]), ''B. suis'' (pigs, see [[Swine brucellosis]]), ''B. abortus'' (cattle and bison), ''[[Brucella ovis|B. ovis]]'' (sheep), and ''B. canis'' (dogs).  ''B. abortus'' also infects bison and elk in North America and ''B. suis'' is endemic in caribou.  ''Brucella'' species have also been isolated from several marine mammal species (pinnipeds and cetaceans).

===Brucellosis in cattle===
The bacterium ''[[Brucella abortus]]'' is the principal cause of brucellosis in cattle. The bacteria are shed from an infected animal at or around the time of calving or [[Spontaneous abortion|abortion]]. Once exposed, the likelihood of an animal becoming infected is variable, depending on age, pregnancy status, and other intrinsic factors of the animal, as well as the amount of bacteria to which the animal was exposed.<ref>Radostits, O.M., C.C. Gay, D.C. Blood, and K.W. Hinchcliff. 2000. Veterinary Medicine, A textbook of the Diseases of Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Goats and Horses. Harcourt Publishers Limited, London, pp. 867–882.</ref> The most common clinical signs of cattle infected with ''Brucella abortus'' are high incidences of abortions, arthritic joints and retained [[placenta|after-birth]]. 

There are two main causes for spontaneous abortion in animals.  The first is due to [[erythritol]], which can promote infections in the fetus and placenta.  The second is due to the lack of anti-Brucella activity in the amniotic fluid.  Males can also harbor the bacteria in their reproductive tracts, namely [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[ampulla of ductus deferens|ampullae]], [[testicle]]s, and [[Epididymis|epididymes]].

===Brucellosis in dogs===
The causative agent of brucellosis in [[dog]]s is ''[[Brucella canis]]''. It is transmitted to other dogs through breeding and contact with aborted fetuses. Brucellosis can occur in humans that come in contact with infected aborted tissue or semen. The bacteria in dogs normally infect the genitals and [[lymphatic system]], but can also spread to the [[Human eye|eye]], [[kidney]], and [[intervertebral disc]] (causing [[discospondylitis]]). Symptoms of brucellosis in dogs include abortion in female dogs and [[scrotum|scrotal]] inflammation and [[orchitis]] (inflammation of the testicles) in males. Fever is uncommon. Infection of the eye can cause [[uveitis]], and infection of the intervertebral disc can cause pain or weakness. Blood testing of the dogs prior to breeding can prevent the spread of this disease. It is treated with antibiotics, as with humans, but it is difficult to cure.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J; Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-4679-4 }}</ref>

==Brucellosis in humans==
[[Image:Brucella granuloma.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Granuloma]] and [[necrosis]] in the liver of a guinea pig infected with ''Brucella suis''.]]
Brucellosis in humans is usually associated with the consumption of unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses made from the milk of infected animals, primarily goats, infected with ''Brucella melitensis'' and with occupational exposure of laboratory workers, veterinarians, and slaughterhouse workers.  Some vaccines used in livestock, most notably ''B. abortus'' strain 19, also cause disease in humans if accidentally injected.  Brucellosis induces inconstant [[fever]]s, [[abortion]], sweating, weakness, [[anaemia]], [[headache]]s, [[clinical depression|depression]], and muscular and bodily pain.

===Symptoms===
The symptoms are like those associated with many other [[fever|febrile]] diseases, but with emphasis on muscular pain and sweating. The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years. In the first stage of the disease, [[septicaemia]] occurs and leads to the classic triad of undulant fevers, sweating (often with characteristic smell, likened to wet hay), and migratory [[arthralgia]] and [[myalgia]]. Blood tests characteristically reveal [[leukopenia]] and [[anemia]], show some elevation of AST and ALT, and demonstrate positive Bengal Rose and Huddleston reactions. 

This complex is, at least in Portugal, known as Malta fever. During episodes of Malta fever, melitococcemia (presence of brucellae in blood) can usually be demonstrated by means of blood culture in tryptose medium or Albini medium. If untreated, the disease can give origin to focalizations or become chronic. The focalizations of brucellosis occur usually in bones and joints and [[spondylodiscitis]] of lumbar spine accompanied by [[sacroiliitis]] is very characteristic of this disease. [[Orchitis]] is also frequent in men.

Diagnosis of brucellosis relies on:
# Demonstration of the agent: blood cultures in tryptose broth, bone marrow cultures. The growth of brucellae is extremely slow (they can take until 2 months to grow) and the culture poses a risk to laboratory personnel due to high infectivity of brucellae.
# Demonstration of antibodies against the agent either with the classic Huddleson, Wright and/or Bengal Rose reactions, either with ELISA or the 2-mercaptoethanol assay for IgM antibodies associated with chronic disease
# Histologic evidence of granulomatous hepatitis (hepatic biopsy)
# Radiologic alterations in infected vertebrae: the Pedro Pons sign (preferential erosion of antero-superior corner of lumbar vertebrae) and marked osteophytosis are suspicious of brucellic spondylitis.

The disease's [[wiktionary:sequela|sequelae]] are highly variable and may include [[hepatitis|granulomatous hepatitis]], [[arthritis]], [[spondylitis]], [[anaemia]], [[leukopenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[meningitis]], [[uveitis]], [[optic neuritis]], [[endocarditis]], and various neurological disorders collectively known as neurobrucellosis.

===Treatment and prevention===
[[Antibiotic]]s like [[tetracycline]]s, [[rifampicin]], and the [[aminoglycoside]]s [[streptomycin]] and [[gentamicin]] are effective against ''Brucella'' bacteria. However, the use of more than one antibiotic is needed for several weeks, because the bacteria incubate within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.

The gold standard treatment for adults is daily [[intramuscular injection]]s of [[streptomycin]] 1 g for 14 days and oral [[doxycycline]] 100&nbsp;mg twice daily for 45&nbsp;days (concurrently). [[Gentamicin]] 5&nbsp;mg/kg by [[intramuscular injection]] once daily for seven days is an acceptable substitute when streptomycin is not available or difficult to obtain.<ref name="pmid16575723">{{cite journal |author=Hasanjani Roushan MR, Mohraz M, Hajiahmadi M, Ramzani A, Valayati A A |title=Efficacy of gentamicin plus doxycycline versus streptomycin plus doxycycline in the treatment of brucellosis in humans |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=1075–1080 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16575723 |doi=10.1086/501359 |url=}}</ref> Another widely used regimen is doxycycline plus rifampin twice daily for at least six weeks. This regimen has the advantage of oral administration. A triple therapy of doxycycline, with rifampin and cotrimoxazole, has been used successfully to treat neurobrucellosis.<ref name="pmid1420670">{{cite journal |author=McLean DR, Russell N, Khan MY |title=Neurobrucellosis: clinical and therapeutic features |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=582–90 |year=1992 |month=October |pmid=1420670 |doi= 10.1093/clind/15.4.582|url=}}</ref> 

Doxycycline is able to cross the blood–brain barrier, but requires the addition of two other drugs to prevent relapse. Ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole therapy is associated with an unacceptably high rate of relapse. In brucellic endocarditis, surgery is required for an optimal outcome. Even with optimal antibrucellic therapy, relapses still occur in 5–10&nbsp;percent of patients with Malta fever. 

The main way of preventing brucellosis is by using fastidious hygiene in producing raw milk products, or by [[pasteurization|pasteurizing]] all milk that is to be ingested by human beings, either in its unaltered form or as a derivate, such as [[cheese]]. Experiments have shown that cotrimoxazol and [[rifampin]] are both safe drugs to use in treatment of pregnant women who have brucellosis.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Prognosis===
With combination drug therapy, most individuals recover in 2 to 3 weeks. Even widespread infections may be cured. Untreated, however, the infection may progress and increase in severity and also affect new tissues. Although brucellosis can take a chronic form, with periods of illness alternating with periods of no symptoms, persistent illness lasting longer than 2 months may be due to a previously unsuspected underlying disease or a complication of the brucellosis.

Approximately 10% of individuals may have a relapse, even after treatment is completed. In these cases, treatment should be repeated.

This disease has a low mortality rate (lower than 2%); the most likely cause of death is [[endocarditis]] caused by [[Brucella melitensis]].

===Biological warfare===
In 1954, ''B. suis'' became the first agent [[biological warfare|weaponized]] by the United States at its [[Pine Bluff Arsenal]] in Arkansas. ''Brucella'' species survive well in aerosols and resist drying. ''Brucella'' and all other remaining biological weapons in the U.S. arsenal were destroyed in 1971–72 when the U.S. offensive biological weapons (BW) program was discontinued.<ref>{{cite book|author=Woods, Lt Col Jon B. (ed.)|title=USAMRIID’s Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook |url=http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf |format=PDF |edition=6th |publisher=[[USAMRIID|U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases]] |location=Fort Detrick, Maryland|month=April |year=2005 |page=53}}</ref>

The United States BW program focused on three agents of the ''Brucella'' group:
* Porcine Brucellosis (Agent US)
* Bovine Brucellosis (Agent AB)
* Caprine Brucellosis (Agent AM)

Agent US was in advanced development by the end of [[World War II]].  When the [[U.S. Air Force]] (USAF) wanted a biological warfare capability, the Chemical Corps offered Agent US in the [[M114 bomblet]], based after the 4-pound bursting bomblet developed for [[anthrax]] in World War II.  Though the capability was developed, operational testing indicated that the weapon was less than desirable, and the USAF termed it an interim capability until replaced by a more effective biological weapon.  

The main drawbacks of the M114 with Agent US was that it was incapacitating (the USAF wanted "killer" agents), the storage stability was too low to allow for storing at forward air bases, and the logistical requirements to neutralize a target were far higher than originally anticipated, requiring unreasonable logistical air support.

Agents US and AB had a median infective dose of 500 org/person, and AM was 300 org/person.  The rate-of-action was believed to be 2 weeks, with a duration of action of several months.  The lethality estimate was based on epidemiological information at 1–2%.  AM was always believed to be a more virulent disease, and a 3% fatality rate was expected.

==Control and eradication efforts==
===United States===
Dairy herds in the USA are tested at least once a year with the Brucella Milk Ring Test (BRT).<ref name="pmid15405523">{{cite journal |author=Hamilton AV, Hardy AV |title=The brucella ring test; its potential value in the control of brucellosis |journal=Am J Public Health Nations Health |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=321–323 |year=1950 |month=March |pmid=15405523 |pmc=1528431 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.40.3.321|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/40/3/321.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Cows that are confirmed to be infected are often killed. In the United States, [[veterinarian]]s are required to [[Vaccination|vaccinate]] all young stock, thereby further reducing the chance of [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] transmission.  This vaccination is usually referred to as a "calfhood" vaccination.  Most cattle receive a tattoo in their ear serving as proof of their vaccination status.  This tattoo also includes the last digit of the year they were born.<ref name="vermont">{{cite journal |author=Vermont Beef Producers |title=How important is calfhood vaccination? |url=http://www.vermontbeefproducers.org/NewFiles/AsktheVet/Fall%2002.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

The first state–federal cooperative efforts towards eradication of brucellosis caused by ''Brucella abortus'' in the U.S. began in 1934.

====Greater Yellowstone area====
Wild [[bison]] and [[elk]] in the Greater [[Yellowstone]] Area (GYA) are the last remaining reservoir of ''Brucella abortus'' in the U.S. The recent transmission of brucellosis from elk to cattle in Idaho and Wyoming illustrates how the GYA is the last remaining reservoir in the United States, adversely affecting the livestock industry. Eliminating brucellosis from this area is a challenge, as there are many viewpoints on how to manage diseased wildlife.

===Canada===
[[Canada]] declared their cattle herd brucellosis-free on September 19, 1985.  Brucellosis ring testing of milk and cream, as well as testing of slaughter cattle, ended April 1, 1999.  Monitoring continues through auction market testing, standard disease reporting mechanisms, and testing of cattle being qualified for export to countries other than the USA.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/heasan/man/avmmva/avmmva_mod8e.shtml |title= Reportable Diseases |accessdate= 2007-03-18 |work= Accredited Veterinarian’s Manual |publisher= Canadian Food Inspection Agency }}</ref>

====Malta====
Until the early 20th century the disease was [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in Malta to the point of it being referred to as "the Maltese fever". The link between the illness and [[pasteurised|unpasteurised milk]] was established by [[Temi Zammit]]. Today thanks to a strict regime of certification of milk animals and widespread use of pasteurisation the illness has been eradicated from Malta.<ref>{{cite book|title=Brucellosis, The Malta Experience|last= Rizzo Naudi|first= John |year= 2005| publisher= Publishers Enterprises group (PEG) Ltd.|location=Malta|isbn=99909-0-425-1}}</ref>''

===Oceania===
====Australia====
[[Australia]] is at present free of cattle brucelosis, although it occurred in the past. Brucellosis of sheep or goats has never been reported. Brucellosis of pigs does occur. Feral pigs are the typical source of human infections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://access.health.qld.gov.au/hid/InfectionsandParasites/BacterialInfections/brucellosis_fs.asp |title=Queensland Health: Brucellosis |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |publisher=State of Queensland (Queensland Health)}}</ref>
