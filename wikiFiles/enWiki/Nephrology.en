'''Nephrology''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:νεφρός|νεφρός]] – nephros'', "[[kidney]]", combined with the suffix ''-logy'', "the study of") is a [[Specialty (medicine)|specialty]] of [[medicine]] and [[pediatrics]] that concerns itself with the study of normal kidney function, kidney problems, the treatment of kidney problems and [[renal replacement therapy]] ([[dialysis]] and [[kidney transplantation]]). Systemic conditions that affect the kidneys (such as [[diabetes]] and [[autoimmune disease]]) and systemic problems that occur as a result of kidney problems (such as [[renal osteodystrophy]] and [[hypertension]]) are also studied in nephrology. 
A physician who has undertaken additional training to become an [[expert]] in nephrology may call themselves a '''nephrologist''' or '''renal physician'''.

==Scope==
Nephrology concerns the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases, including [[electrolyte disturbance]]s and [[hypertension]], and the care of those requiring [[renal replacement therapy]], including [[dialysis]] and [[renal transplant]] patients. Many diseases affecting the kidney are systemic disorders not limited to the organ itself, and may require special treatment. Examples include acquired conditions such as systemic vasculitides (e.g. ANCA vasculitis) and [[autoimmune diseases]] (e.g., [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]]), as well as congenital or genetic conditions such as polycystic kidney disease.

Patients are referred to nephrology specialists for various reasons, such as [[acute renal failure]], [[chronic kidney disease]], [[hematuria]], [[proteinuria]], [[kidney stone]]s, [[hypertension]], and disorders of acid/base or [[electrolyte]]s.

==Nephrologist==
A nephrologist is a physician who has undertaken additional training to become an [[expert]] in nephrology. Additionally, due to their unique skills, nephrologists may provide care to people without kidney problems and may work in [[general medicine|general/internal medicine]], [[organ transplant|transplant medicine]], [[immunosuppression|immunosuppression management]], [[intensive care|intensive care medicine]], [[clinical pharmacology]] and [[perioperative medicine]].

Nephrologists may further sub-specialise in [[dialysis]], [[Organ transplant|kidney transplantation]], [[chronic kidney disease]], procedural nephrology or other non-nephrology areas as described above.

Procedures a nephrologist may perform include native kidney and transplant [[renal biopsy|kidney biopsy]], [[dialysis]] access insertion (temporary vascular access lines, tunnelled vascular access lines, peritoneal dialysis access lines), [[fistula]] management ([[angiogram|angiographic]] or surgical fistulogram and plasty) and [[bone biopsy]].

===Training===

====Australia and New Zealand====
Nephrology training in Australia and New Zealand typically includes completion of a medical degree ([[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]]: 4–6 years), [[Internship (medicine)|internship]] (1 year), Basic Physician Training (3 years minimum), successful completion of the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] written and clinical examinations, and Advanced Physician Training in Nephrology (2–3 years). The training pathway is overseen and accredited by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Increasingly, nephrologists may additionally complete of a post-graduate degree (usually a [[PhD]]) in a nephrology research interest (3–4 years). Finally, all Australian and New Zealand nephrologists participate in career-long professional and personal development through the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] and other bodies such as the [[Australian and New Zealand Society of Nephrology]] and the [[Transplant Society of Australia and New Zealand]].

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, nephrology (or often renal medicine) is a subspecialty of general medicine. A nephrologist has completed medical school, foundation year posts (FY1 and FY2) and [[core medical training]] (CMT) and passed the [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]] (MRCP) exam before competing for a National Training Number (NTN) in renal medicine. The typical subspecialty training is five years and leads to a [[Certificate of Completion of Training]] (CCT) in both renal medicine and general (internal) medicine. Subspecialty trainees often interrupt their clinical training to obtain research degrees (MD/PhD).

====United States====
In the [[United States]], after [[medical school]] nephrologists complete a three year [[residency (medicine)|residency]] in internal medicine followed by a two year (or longer) [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in nephrology. Once training is satisfactorily completed, the physician is eligible to take the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] (ABIM) or [[American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine]] (AOBIM) nephrology examination. Nephrologists must be approved by one of these boards. To be approved, the physician must fulfill the requirements for education and training in nephrology in order to qualify to take the board's examination. If a physician passes the examination, then he or she can become a nephrology specialist. Typically, nephrologists also need two to three years of training in an [[ACGME]] or [[American Osteopathic Association|AOA]] accredited fellowship in nephrology. Nearly all programs train nephrologists in [[Hemofiltration|continuous renal replacement therapy]]; fewer than half in the United States train in the provision of [[plasmapheresis]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Berns JS, O'Neill WC|title=Performance of procedures by nephrologists and nephrology fellows at U.S. nephrology training programs|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|volume=3|issue=4|pages=941–7|year=2008|pmid=18417748|doi=10.2215/CJN.00490108|pmc=2440278}}</ref> Only pediatric trained physicians are able to train in pediatric nephrology, and internal medicine (adult) trained physicians may enter general (adult) nephrology fellowships.

==Diagnosis==
[[History]] and [[physical examination]] are central to the diagnostic workup in nephrology. This may include inquires regarding family history, general medical history, diet, medication use, drug use and occupation. Examination typically includes an assessment of volume state, blood pressure, skin, joints, abdomen and [[flank]].

Examination of the urine ([[urinalysis]]) allows a direct assessment for possible kidney problems, which may be suggested by appearance of blood in the urine ([[haematuria]]), protein in the urine ([[proteinuria]]), pus cells in the urine ([[pyuria]]) or cancer cells in the urine. A [[24 hour urine collection]] can be used to [[quantify]] daily protein loss (see [[Proteinuria]]), urine output, [[creatinine clearance]] or electrolyte handling by the [[renal tubules]]. 

Basic blood tests can be used to check the concentration of [[haemoglobin]], [[platelets]], sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, [[urea]], [[creatinine]], calcium, magnesium or phosphate in the blood. All of these may be affected by kidney problems. The serum creatinine concentration can be used to estimate the function of the kidney, called the [[creatinine clearance]] or estimated [[glomerular filtration rate]]. More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain [[systemic disease]]s to kidney failure such as infections ([[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]]), autoimmune conditions ([[Lupus nephritis|systemic lupus erythematosis]], [[ANCA-associated vasculitides|ANCA vasculitis]]), [[paraproteinemias]] ([[amyloidosis]], [[multiple myeloma]]) and metabolic diseases ([[diabetes]], [[cystinosis]]).

Structural abnormalities of the kidneys are identified with imaging tests. These may include [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], [[Computed axial tomography|computed axial tomography (CT)]], [[scintigraphy]] ([[nuclear medicine]]), [[angiography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]].

In certain circumstances, less invasive testing may not provide a certain diagnosis. Where definitive diagnosis is required, a [[biopsy]] of the kidney ([[renal biopsy]]) may be performed. This typically involves the insertion, under [[local anaesthetic]] and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound guidance]], of a [[core biopsy]] needle into the kidney to obtain a small slither of kidney tissue. The kidney tissue is then examined under a microscope, allowing direct visualization of the changes occurring within the kidney. Additionally, the pathology may also [[staging (pathology)|stage]] a problem affecting the kidney, allowing some degree of [[prognostication]]. In some circumstances, kidney biopsy will also be used to monitor response to treatment and identify early [[relapse]].

==Treatment==
Treatments in nephrology can include [[medications]], [[blood products]], surgical interventions ([[urology]], [[vascular surgery|vascular]] or [[general surgery|surgical]] procedures), [[renal replacement therapy]] ([[dialysis]] or [[kidney transplantation]]) and [[plasma exchange]]. Kidney problems can have significant impact on quality and length of life, and so psychological support, health education and advanced care planning play key roles in nephrology.

[[Chronic kidney disease]] is typically managed with treatment of causative conditions (such as [[diabetes]]), avoidance of substances toxic to the kidneys ([[nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxins]] like [[contrast medium|radiologic contrast]] and [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]), [[antihypertensives]], diet and weight modification and planning for [[end-stage renal failure]]. Impaired kidney function has systemic effects on the body. An [[erythropoetin|erythropoetin stimulating agent]] may be required to ensure adequate production of [[red blood cells]], [[calcitriol|activated vitamin D]] supplements and [[phosphate binders]] may be required to counteract the effects of kidney failure on [[renal osteodystrophy|bone metabolism]], and blood volume and [[electrolyte disturbance]] may need correction.

[[Auto-immune]] and [[inflammatory]] kidney disease, such as [[vasculitis]] or [[transplant rejection]], may be treated with [[immunosuppression]]. Commonly used agents are [[prednisolone]], [[mycophenolate]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[cyclosporin]], [[tacrolimus]], [[everolimus]], [[thymoglobulin]] and [[sirolimus]]. Newer, so-called "[[biologic medical product|biologic drugs]]" or [[monoclonal antibodies]], are also used in these conditions and include [[rituximab]], [[basiliximab]] and [[eculizumab]]. Blood products including [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] and a process known as [[plasma exchange]] can also be employed.

When the kidneys are no longer able to sustain the demands of the body, [[end-stage renal failure]] is said to have occurred. Without [[renal replacement therapy]], death from [[renal failure]] will eventually result. [[Dialysis]] is an artificial method of replacing some kidney function to prolong life. [[Renal transplantation]] replaces kidney function by inserting into the body a healthier kidney from an [[organ donor]] and inducing [[immunologic tolerance]] of that organ with [[immunosuppression]]. At present, [[renal transplantation]] is the most effective treatment for [[end-stage renal failure]] although its world-wide availability is limited by lack of availability of donor organs.

Most kidney conditions are [[chronic condition]]s and so long term followup with a nephrologist is usually necessary.

==Organizations==
The [[International Society of Nephrology]] is the largest global society representing medical professionals engaged in advancing kidney care worldwide. In the USA, the [[National Kidney Foundation]] is a national organization representing patients and professionals who treat kidney diseases. Founded in 1966, the [[American Society of Nephrology]] (ASN) is the world’s largest professional society devoted to the study of kidney disease. In the United Kingdom, the [[National Kidney Federation]] represents patients, and the [[Renal Association]] represents renal physicians and works closely with the [[National Service Framework]] for kidney disease. The [[Renal Support Network]] (RSN) is a nonprofit, patient-focused, patient-run organization that provides non-medical services to those affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD). The [[American Association of Kidney Patients]] (AAKP) is a non-profit, patient-centric group focused on improving the health and well-being of CKD and [[dialysis]] patients. The [[American Kidney Fund]] directly provides financial support to patients in need, as well as participating in health education and prevention efforts.ASDIN ( American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology) is the main organization of interventional nephrologists. Other organizations include CIDA, VASA etc. which deal with dialysis vascular access.
