'''Endocrine disruptors''' are chemicals that interfere with the [[endocrine]] (or hormone system) in animals, including humans.  These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders.  Any system in the body controlled by hormones, can be derailed by hormone disruptors. Specifically, they are known to cause [[learning disabilities]], severe [[attention deficit disorder]], [[cognitive]] and brain development problems; deformations of the body (including limbs); breast cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid and other cancers;  sexual development problems such as [[feminization (biology)|feminizing]] of males or masculine effects on females, etc.   The critical period of development for most organisms is between the transition from a fertilized egg, into a fully formed infant.  As the cells begin to grow and differentiate, there are critical balances of hormones and protein changes that must occur.  Therefore, a dose of disrupting chemicals can do substantial damage to a developing fetus (baby).  The same dose may not significantly affect adult mothers—for a more scientific explanation, see below.

Found in many household and industrial products, endocrine disruptors are substances that "interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural [[hormone]]s in the body that are responsible for development, behavior, fertility, and maintenance of homeostasis (normal cell metabolism)."<ref name="pmid9539004">{{cite journal | author = Crisp TM, Clegg ED, Cooper RL, Wood WP, Anderson DG, Baetcke KP, Hoffmann JL, Morrow MS, Rodier DJ, Schaeffer JE, Touart LW, Zeeman MG, Patel YM | title =  Environmental endocrine disruption: An effects assessment and analysis | journal = Environ.

The term ''endocrine disruptor'' is often used as synonym for [[xenohormone]] although the latter can mean any naturally occurring or artificially produced compound showing hormone-like properties (usually binding to certain hormonal receptors).  EDCs in the environment may also be related to reproductive and infertility problems in wildlife and bans and restrictions on their use has been associated with a reduction in health problems and the recovery of some wildlife populations.

==History of the field of endocrine disruption==
The term ''endocrine disruptor'' was coined at the Wingspread Conference Centre in Wisconsin, in 1991. One of the early papers on the phenomenon was by [[Theo Colborn]] in 1993.<ref name="pmid8080506">{{cite journal | author = Colborn T, vom Saal FS, Soto AM | title = Developmental effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in wildlife and humans | journal = Environ.

Endocrine disrupting compounds encompass a variety of chemical classes, including drugs, pesticides, compounds used in the plastics industry and in consumer products, industrial by-products and pollutants, and even some naturally produced botanical chemicals. Some are pervasive and widely dispersed in the environment and may bio-accumulate. Some are [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POP's), and can be transported long distances across national boundaries and have been found in virtually all regions of the world, and may even concentrate near the North Pole, due to weather patterns and cold conditions.<ref name="Cold, Clear, and Deadly">{{cite web | url = http://coldclearanddeadly.com/ | title = Cold, Clear, and Deadly | author = Visser MJ | date = | work = | publisher = | quote = | accessdate = 2012-04-14 }}</ref> Others are rapidly degraded in the environment or human body or may be present for only short periods of time.<ref name="urlREPIDISCA-Global assessment of the state-of-the-science of endocrine disruptors">{{cite web | url = http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&src=google&base=REPIDISCA&lang=p&nextAction=lnk&exprSearch=7600&indexSearch=ID | title = REPIDISCA-Global assessment of the state-of-the-science of endocrine disruptors | author = Damstra T, Barlow S Bergman A, Kavlock R, Van der Kraak G | year = 2002 | format = | work = International programme on chemical safety, World Health Organization| publisher = | pages =  | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref> Health effects attributed to endocrine disrupting compounds include a range of reproductive problems (reduced fertility, male and female [[reproductive tract]] abnormalities, and skewed male/female [[sex ratio]]s, loss of fetus, menstrual problems<ref name="urlwww.cranfield.ac.uk">{{cite web | url = http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/health/researchareas/environmenthealth/ieh/ieh%20publications/a1.pdf | title = Environmental oestrogens: consequences to human health and wildlife | author = Harrison PTC, Humfrey CDN, Litchfield M, Peakall D, Shuker LK | year = 1995 | format = | work = IEH assessment | publisher = Medical Research Council, Institute for Environment and Health | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref>); changes in hormone levels; early puberty; brain and behavior problems; impaired immune functions; and various cancers.<ref name="urle.hormone | EDC Human Effects">{{cite web | url = http://e.hormone.tulane.edu/learning/human-effects.html | title = EDC Human Effects | author = | date = | work = e.hormone | publisher = Center for Bioenvironmental Research at Tulane and Xavier Universities | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref>

One example of the consequences of the exposure of developing animals, including humans, to hormonally active agents is the case of the drug [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), a non-steroidal estrogen and not an environmental pollutant. Prior to its ban in the early 1970s, doctors prescribed DES to as many as five million pregnant women to block spontaneous abortion, an [[off-label use]] of this medication prior to 1947. It was discovered after the children went through puberty that DES affected the development of the reproductive system and caused [[vaginal cancer]].  The relevance of the DES saga to the risks of exposure to endocrine disruptors is questionable, as the doses involved are much higher in these individuals than in those due to environmental exposures.<ref name="pmid9557209">{{cite journal | author = Golden RJ, Noller KL, Titus-Ernstoff L, Kaufman RH, Mittendorf R, Stillman R, Reese EA | title = Environmental endocrine modulators and human health: an assessment of the biological evidence | journal = Crit.

In 2013 the [[WHO]] and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] released a study, the most comprehensive report on EDCs to date,  calling for more research to fully understand the associations between EDCs and the risks to health of human and animal life.  The team  pointed to wide gaps in knowledge and called for more research  to obtain a fuller picture of the health and environmental impacts of endocrine disruptors.  To improve global knowledge the team has recommended:

* ''Testing: known EDCs are only the 'tip of the iceberg' and more comprehensive testing methods are required to identify other possible endocrine disruptors, their sources, and routes of exposure.
* ''Research: more scientific evidence is needed to identify the effects of mixtures of EDCs on humans and wildlife (mainly from industrial by-products) to which humans and wildlife are increasingly exposed.
* ''Reporting: many sources of EDCs are not known because of insufficient reporting and information on chemicals in products, materials and goods.
* ''Collaboration: more data sharing between scientists and between countries can fill gaps in data, primarily in developing countries and emerging economies.''<ref>[http://www.who.int/ceh/publications/endocrine/en/index.html WHO | State of the science of endocrine disrupting chemicals - 2012<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Endocrine system ==
{{Main|Endocrine system}}
Endocrine systems are found in most varieties of [[animal]]s. The endocrine system consists of [[gland]]s that secrete [[hormone]]s, and [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] that detect and react to the hormones.

Hormones travel throughout the body and act as chemical messengers. Hormones interface with cells that contain matching receptors in or on their surfaces. The hormone binds with the receptor, much like a key would fit into a lock. The endocrine system regulates adjustments through slower internal processes, using hormones as messengers. The endocrine system secretes hormones in response to environmental stimuli and to orchestrate developmental and reproductive changes. The adjustments brought on by the endocrine system are biochemical, changing the cell's internal and external chemistry to bring about a long term change in the body. These systems work together to maintain the proper functioning of the body through its entire life cycle. [[Sex steroids]] such as [[estrogens]] and [[androgens]], as well as [[thyroid]] hormones, are subject to [[feedback]] regulation, which tends to limit the sensitivity of these glands.

Hormones work at very small doses (part per billion ranges).  Endocrine disruption can thereby also occur from low-dose exposure to exogenous hormones or hormonally active chemicals that can interfere with receptors for other hormonally mediated processes.<ref>Bis-phenol A California Environment www.environmentcalifornia.org/environmental-health/stop-toxic-toys/bisphenol-a-overview</ref> Furthermore, since [[endogenous]] hormones are already present in the body in biologically active concentrations, additional exposure to relatively small amounts of [[exogenous]] hormonally active substances can disrupt the proper functioning of the body's endocrine system. Thus, an endocrine disruptor can elicit adverse effects at much lower doses than a toxicity, acting through a different mechanism.

The timing of exposure is also critical.  Most critical stages of development occur in utero, where the fertilized egg divides, rapidly developing every structure of a fully formed baby, including much of the wiring in the brain.  Interfering with the hormonal communication in utero can have profound effects both structurally and toward brain development. Depending on the stage of reproductive development, interference with hormonal signaling can result in irreversible effects not seen in adults exposed to the same dose for the same length of time.<ref name="Guo_1995">{{cite journal | author = Guo YL, Lambert GH, Hsu CC | title = Growth abnormalities in the population exposed in utero and early postnatally to polychlorinated biphenyls and dibenzofurans | journal = Environ.

There are studies of cell cultures, laboratory animals, wildlife, and accidentally exposed humans that show that environmental chemicals cause a wide range of reproductive, developmental, growth, and behavior effects, and so while "endocrine disruption in humans by pollutant chemicals remains largely undemonstrated, the underlying science is sound and the potential for such effects is real."<ref name="pmid12837917">{{cite journal | author = Rogan WJ, Ragan NB | title = Evidence of effects of environmental chemicals on the endocrine system in children | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 112 | issue = 1 Pt 2 | pages = 247–52 | year = 2003 | month = July | pmid = 12837917 | url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/Supplement_1/247.full | doi=10.1542/peds.112.1.S1.247}}</ref> While compounds that produce estrogenic, androgenic, antiandrogenic, and antithyroid actions have been studied, less is known about interactions with other hormones.

The interrelationship between exposures to chemicals and health effects are rather complex. It is hard to definitively link a particular chemical with a specific health effect, and exposed adults may not show any ill effects.

==Dose-response controversy==
One major objection to the theory of endocrine disruptors is the dosage effect. There is a large gap between high exposures seen in a laboratory experiment versus the relatively low levels found in the environment.<ref name="pmid9071972">{{cite journal | author = Cooper RL, Kavlock RJ | title = Endocrine disruptors and reproductive development: a weight-of-evidence overview | journal = J.

A consensus statement by the Learning and Development Disabilities Initiative rebuts this criticism arguing that "The very low-dose effects of endocrine disruptors can not be predicted from high-dose studies, which contradicts the standard 'dose makes the poison' rule of toxicology. Nontraditional dose-response curves are referred to as nonmonotonic dose response curves."<ref name='urlwww.iceh.org'/> Furthermore, endocrine disrupting effects have been noted in animals exposed to environmentally relevant levels of some chemicals. For example, researchers have found that a common [[flame retardant]], [[PBDE]]-47, affects the reproductive system and thyroid gland of female rats in doses of the order of those to which humans are exposed.<ref name="pmid18335096">{{cite journal | author = Talsness CE, Kuriyama SN, Sterner-Kock A, Schnitker P, Grande SW, Shakibaei M, Andrade A, Grote K, Chahoud I | title = In utero and lactational exposures to low doses of polybrominated diphenyl ether-47 alter the reproductive system and thyroid gland of female rat offspring | journal = Environ.

The conventional relationship (more exposure equals higher risk) has been challenged by some studying endocrine disruptors.  For example, it has been claimed that [[Tamoxifen]] and some [[phthalates]] have fundamentally different (and harmful) effects on the body at low doses than at high doses.<ref>[http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=09-P13-00036&segmentID=3 Low Dose Makes the Poison].

==Routes of exposure==
Food is a major mechanism by which people are exposed to pollutants. Diet is thought to account for up to 90% of a person's [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] and [[DDT]] body burden.<ref name="Fürst_2006">{{cite journal | author = Fürst P | title = Dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls and other organohalogen compounds in human milk.

Consumer goods are another potential source of exposure to endocrine disruptors. An analysis of the composition of 42 household cleaning and personal care products versus 43 "chemical free" products has been performed. The products contained 55 different chemical compounds: 50 were found in the 42 conventional samples representing 170 product types, while 41 were detected in 43 "chemical free" samples representing 39 product types. [[Parabens]], a class of chemicals that has been associated with reproductive-tract issues, were detected in seven of the "chemical free" products, including three sunscreens that did not list parabens on the label. Vinyl products such as shower curtains were found to contain more than 10% by weight of the compound [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|DEHP]], which when present in dust has been associated with asthma and wheezing in children. The risk of exposure to chemical compounds increases as products, both conventional and "chemical free," are used in combination. "If a consumer used the alternative surface cleaner, tub and tile cleaner, laundry detergent, bar soap, shampoo and conditioner, facial cleanser and lotion, and toothpaste [he or she] would potentially be exposed to at least 19 compounds: 2 parabens, 3 [[phthalate]]s, [[Cysteamine|MEA]], [[Ethanolamine|DEA]], 5 [[alkylphenol]]s, and 7 fragrances."<ref name="pmid22398195">{{cite journal | author = Dodson RE, Nishioka M, Standley LJ, Perovich LJ, Brody JG, Rudel RA | title = Endocrine Disruptors and Asthma-Associated Chemicals in Consumer Products | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2012 | month = March | pmid = 22398195 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.1104052 | laysummary = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/chemicals-consumer-products | laysource = Journalist's Resource }}</ref>

An analysis of the endocrine disrupting chemicals in [[Old Order Mennonite]] women in mid-pregnancy determined that they have much lower levels in their systems than the general population.  Mennonites eat mostly fresh, unprocessed foods, farm without pesticides, and use few or no cosmetics or personal care products. One woman who had reported using hairspray and perfume had high levels of monoethyl phthalate, while the  other women all had levels  below detection.  Three women who reported being in a car or truck within 48 hours of providing a urine sample had higher levels of diethylhexyl phthalate which is found in polyvinyl chloride, and is used in car interiors.<ref name="pmid22739065">{{cite journal | author = Martina CA, Weiss B, Swan SH | title = Lifestyle behaviors associated with exposures to endocrine disruptors | journal = Neurotoxicology | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2012 | month = June | pmid = 22739065 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuro.2012.05.016 | laysummary = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120626092546.htm | laysource = Science Daily }}</ref>

==Types of endocrine disruptors==
All people are exposed to chemicals with estrogenic effects in their everyday life, because endocrine disrupting chemicals are found in low doses in thousands of products. Chemicals commonly detected in people include [[DDT]], [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCB's), [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[polybrominated diphenyl ethers]] (PBDE's), and a variety of [[phthalate]]s.<ref name="urlCDC - National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals | CDC">{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/ | title = National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals | author = | date = | format = | work = | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref> In fact, almost all plastic products, including those advertised as "BPA free", have been found to leach endocrine-disrupting chemicals.  In a 2011, study it was found that some "BPA-free" products released more endocrine active chemicals than the BPA-containing products.<ref>http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2011/03/bpa-free-plastic-products-estrogen/1#.UTJ2tVKwD8Q</ref><ref>http://healthland.time.com/2011/03/08/study-even-bpa-free-plastics-leach-endrocrine-disrupting-chemicals/</ref>

There is some dispute in the scientific community surrounding the claim that these chemicals actually disrupt the endocrine system. Many believe that there is little evidence that the degree of exposure in humans is enough to warrant concern,<ref name="pmid12837917"/><ref name="pmid10856020" /> while many others believe there is evidence that these chemicals pose some risk to human health.<ref name="pmid11192656">{{cite journal | author = Solomon GM, Schettler T | title = Environment and health: 6.

Some researchers are investigating the health risks to children of endocrine disrupting chemicals. Bisphenol A, until 2010 a common component in the plastic used to manufacture plastic baby bottles, has been banned in most countries. In 2010, despite strong industry opposition, Canada was the first to ban BPA's use in baby bottles.  Australia and the European Union followed in 2011. Several states in the United States had banned its use by 2011, and in 2012 a nation-wide ban was put in place.

'''Xenoestrogens''' are a type of [[xenohormone]] that imitates [[estrogen]]. Synthetic xenoestrogens include widely used industrial compounds, such as [[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCBs]], [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] and [[phthalates]], which have estrogenic effects on a living organism.

==Uses of long-chain alkylphenols==
The long-chain alkylphenols are used extensively as precursors to the detergents, as additives for fuels and lubricants, polymers, and as components in [[phenolic resin]]s.  These compounds are also used as building block chemicals that are also used in making fragrances, thermoplastic elastomers, antioxidants, oil field chemicals and fire retardant materials.  Through the downstream use in making alkylphenolic resins, alkylphenols are also found in tires, adhesives, coatings, carbonless copypaper and high performance rubber products.  They have been used in industry for over 40 years.

Certain alkylphenols are degradation products from nonionic [[detergents]]. Nonylphenol is considered to be a low-level endocrine disruptor owing to its tendency to mimic estrogen.<ref name="pmid18282600">{{cite journal | author = Soares A, Guieysse B, Jefferson B, Cartmell E, Lester JN | title = Nonylphenol in the environment: a critical review on occurrence, fate, toxicity and treatment in wastewaters | journal = Environ Int | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 1033–49 | year = 2008 | month = October | pmid = 18282600 | doi = 10.1016/j.envint.2008.01.004 }}</ref><ref name="urlwww.pca.state.mn.us">{{cite web | url = http://www.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,10280 | title = Statewide Endocrine Disrupting Compound Monitoring Study, 2007 - 2008 | author = | date = | work = | publisher = Minnesota Pollution Control Agency | accessdate = }}</ref>

=== DDT ===

{{Main|DDT}}
[[File:DDT.svg|thumb|right|DDT Chemical structure]]

Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) was first used as a pesticide against [[Colorado potato beetle]]s on crops beginning in 1936.<ref name="Davis_1971">{{cite journal | author = Davis KS | title = The deadly dust: the unhappy history of DDT | journal = American Heritage Magazine | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = | year = 1971 | month = | pmc = | doi = | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1971/2/1971_2_44.shtml | issn = }}</ref> An increase in the incidence of [[malaria]], epidemic [[typhus]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhoid fever]] led to its use against the mosquitoes, lice, and houseflies that carried these diseases. Before World War II, [[pyrethrum]], an extract of a flower from Japan, had been used to control these insects and the diseases they can spread. During World War II, Japan stopped exporting pyrethrum, forcing the search for an alternative. Fearing an epidemic outbreak of typhus, every British and American soldier was issued DDT, who used it to routinely dust beds, tents, and barracks all over the world.

DDT was approved for general, non-military use after the war ended.<ref name="Davis_1971"/> It became used worldwide to increase [[monoculture]] crop yields that were threatened by pest infestation, and to reduce the spread of malaria which had a high mortality rate in many parts of the world. Its use for agricultural purposes has since been prohibited by national legislation of most countries, while its use as a control against malaria vectors is permitted, as specifically stated by the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/tabid/54/language/en-US/Default.aspx#convtext/

PCBs in the environment may also be related to reproductive and infertility problems in wildlife.  In Alaska it is thought that they  may contribute to reproductive defects, infertility and antler malformation in some deer populations. Declines in the populations of otters and sea lions may also be partially due to their exposure to PCBs, the insecticide DDT, other persistent organic pollutants. Bans and restrictions on the use of EDCs have been associated with a reduction in health problems and the recovery of some wildlife populations.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130219115501.htm Effects of human exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals examined in landmark United Nations report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

They are of potential health concern because they are known to disrupt the endocrine system of animals, and some research has implicated them in the rise of birth defects of the male reproductive system.<ref name="Swan_2005"/><ref name="Fisher">{{cite journal | author = Fisher JS | title = Environmental anti-androgens and male reproductive health: focus on phthalates and testicular dysgenesis syndrome | journal = Reproduction | volume = 127 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–15 | year = 2004 | month = March | pmid = 15016950 | doi = 10.1530/rep.1.00025 }}</ref><ref name=Barrett2005>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1289/ehp.113-a542a | last = Barrett | first =  JR | year = 2005 | title = Phthalates and Baby Boys: Potential Disruption of Human Genital Development | journal = Environmental Health Perspective| pages = 542–542 | volume = 113 | issue = 8 | publisher = Brogan &#38 | jstor = 3436340}}</ref>

=== Perfluorooctanoic acid ===

[[PFOA]] exerts hormonal effects including alteration of thyroid hormone levels.  Blood serum levels of PFOA were associated with an increased time to pregnancy — or "infertility" — in a 2009 study.  PFOA exposure is associated with decreased semen quality.  PFOA appeared to act as an endocrine disruptor by a potential mechanism on breast maturation in young girls. A C8 Science Panel status report noted an association between exposure in girls and a later onset of puberty.

=== Other suspected endocrine disruptors ===

Some other examples of putative EDCs are [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins]] (PCDDs) and [[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans|-furan]]s (PCDFs),  [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), [[phenols|phenol derivatives]] and a number of [[pesticides]] (most prominent being [[organochlorine]] insecticides like [[endosulfan]], [[Kepone|Kepone(chlordecone)]] and [[DDT]] and its derivatives, the herbicide [[atrazine]], and the fungicide [[vinclozolin]]), the contraceptive 17-alpha [[ethinylestradiol]], as well as naturally occurring  [[phytoestrogens]] such as [[genistein]] and [[mycoestrogens]] such as [[zearalenone]].

The molting in crustaceans is an endocrine-controlled process.  In the marine penaeid shrimp ''[[whiteleg shrimp|Litopenaeus vannamei]]'', exposure to [[endosulfan]] resulted increased susceptibility to acute toxicity and increased mortalities in the postmolt stage of the shrimp.<ref name="pmid22119282">{{cite journal | author = Tumburu L, Shepard EF, Strand AE, Browdy CL | title = Effects of endosulfan exposure and Taura Syndrome Virus infection on the survival and molting of the marine penaeid shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 86| issue = 9| pages = 912–8| year = 2011 | month = November | pmid = 22119282 | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.10.057 }}</ref>

==Legal approach==
The multitude of possible endocrine disruptors are technically regulated in the United States by many laws, including: the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]], the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]], the [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]], and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].

The [[Congress of the United States]] has improved the evaluation and regulation process of drugs and other chemicals. The [[Food Quality Protection Act]] of 1996 and the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] of 1996 simultaneously provided the first legislative direction requiring the EPA to address endocrine disruption through establishment of a program for screening and testing of chemical substances.

In 1998 the EPA announced the [[Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program]] by establishment of a framework for priority setting, screening and testing more than 85,000 chemicals in commerce.  The basic concept behind the program is that prioritization will be based on existing information about chemical uses, production volume, structure-activity and toxicity.  Screening is done by use of ''in vitro'' test systems (by examining, for instance, if an agent interacts with the [[estrogen receptor]] or the [[androgen receptor]]) and via the use of in animal models, such as development of tadpoles and uterine growth in prepubertal rodents.  Full scale testing will examine effects not only in mammals (rats) but also in a number of other species (frogs, fish, birds and invertebrates).  Since the theory involves the effects of these substances on a functioning system, animal testing is essential for scientific validity, but has been opposed by [[animal rights]] groups.  Similarly, proof that these effects occur in humans would require human testing, and such testing also has opposition.

After failing to meet several deadlines to begin testing, the EPA finally announced that they were ready to begin the process of testing dozens of chemical entities that are suspected endocrine disruptors early in 2007, eleven years after the program was announced. When the final structure of the tests was announced there was objection to their design. Critics have charged that the entire process has been compromised by chemical company interference.<ref name="urlScientists criticize EPA chemical screening program | News for Dallas, Texas | Dallas Morning News | Science and Medicine | Health">{{cite web | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/healthscience/stories/052707dnentendocrine.3a08215.html# | title = Scientists criticize EPA chemical screening program | author = Ambrose SG | date =  2007-05-27 | format = | work = | publisher = Dallas Morning News | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref> In 2005, the EPA appointed a panel of experts to conduct an open peer-review of the program and its orientation. Their results found that "the long-term goals and science questions in the EDC program are appropriate",<ref name="pmid16882539">{{cite journal | author = Harding AK, Daston GP, Boyd GR, Lucier GW, Safe SH, Stewart J, Tillitt DE, Van Der Kraak G | title = Endocrine disrupting chemicals research program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: summary of a peer-review report | journal = Environ.

== Environmental and human body cleanup ==
There is evidence that once a pollutant is no longer in use, or once its use is heavily restricted, the human [[body burden]] of that pollutant declines. Through the efforts of several large-scale monitoring programs,<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/ | title = National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals | author = | date = | format = | work = | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref><ref name="urlCalifornia Biomonitoring Program, ">{{cite web | url = http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Biomonitoring/Pages/default.aspx | title = California Biomonitoring Program | author = | date = | format = | work = | publisher = State of California | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref> the most prevalent pollutants in the human population are fairly well known. The first step in reducing the body burden of these pollutants is eliminating or phasing out their production.

The second step toward lowering human body burden is awareness of and potentially labeling foods that are likely to contain high amounts of pollutants. This strategy has worked in the past - pregnant and nursing women are cautioned against eating seafood that is known to accumulate high levels of mercury. Ideally,{{Says who|date=October 2011}} a certification process should be in place to routinely test animal products for POP concentrations. This would help the consumer identify which foods have the highest levels of pollutants.

The most challenging aspect{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} of this problem is discovering how to eliminate these compounds from the environment and where to focus remediation efforts. Even pollutants no longer in production persist in the environment, and bio-accumulate in the food chain. An understanding of how these chemicals, once in the environment, move through ecosystems, is essential to designing ways to isolate and remove them. Working backwards through the food chain may help to identify areas to prioritize for remediation efforts. This may be extremely challenging for contaminated fish and marine mammals that have a large habitat and who consume fish from many different areas throughout their lives.

Many persistent organic compounds, PCB, DDT and PBDE included, accumulate in river and marine sediments. Several processes are currently being used by the EPA to clean up heavily polluted areas, as outlined in their Green Remediation program.<ref name="urlCLU-IN.ORG | Green Remediation | Overview">{{cite web | url = http://www.clu-in.org/greenremediation | title = Green Remediation | author = | date = | format = | work = | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref>

One of the most interesting ways is the utilization of naturally occurring microbes that degrade PCB congeners to remediate contaminated areas.<ref name="Field_2008">{{cite journal | author = Field JA, Sierra-Alvarez R | title = Microbial transformation and degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls | journal = Environ.

There are many success stories of cleanup efforts of large heavily contaminated Superfund sites. A {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} landfill in Austin, Texas contaminated with illegally dumped [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]] was restored in a year to a wetland and educational park.<ref name="urlCLU-IN.ORG | Green Remediation | Profiles of Green Strategies | Rhizome Collective Inc.
