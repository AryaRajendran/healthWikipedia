Iprindole is unique compared to most other TCAs in that it is a relatively weak [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] and instead acts predominantly as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s, hence its classification as 'second-generation'.<ref name="pmid475543">{{cite journal | author = Zis AP, Goodwin FK | title = Novel antidepressants and the biogenic amine hypothesis of depression.

It is discontinued in the whole world.

== Chemistry ==

On a [[chemical structure|structural]] level, iprindole differs from other TCAs in that it contains an [[indole]] nucleus, similarly to the [[heterocyclic]] [[antipsychotic]] [[oxypertine]], and has an [[Heterocyclic_compound#8-Membered_rings|eight-membered]] and [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] third [[functional group|ring]].<ref name="urlProgress in medicinal chemistry - Google Books"/><ref name="pmid4308422">{{cite journal | author = Baxter BL, Gluckman MI | title = Iprindole: an antidepressant which does not block REM sleep | journal = Nature | volume = 223 | issue = 5207 | pages = 750–2 | year = 1969 | month = August | pmid = 4308422 | doi = 10.1038/223750a0| url = |bibcode = 1969Natur.223..750B }}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

Iprindole acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] (or [[inverse agonist]]) at the following [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s:

== Interactions ==

Iprindole has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the [[aromatic]] [[hydroxylation]] and/or [[dealkylation|''N''-dealkylation]]-mediated [[metabolism]] of many substances including, but not limited to [[octopamine]], [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], [[fenfluramine]], [[phenelzine]], [[tranylcypromine]], [[trimipramine]], and [[fluoxetine]], likely via inactivating [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]]s.<ref name="pmid10379419"/><ref name="pmid3939325">{{cite journal | author = Sedlock ML, Ravitch J, Edwards DJ | title = The effects of imipramine and iprindole on the metabolism of octopamine in the rat | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 705–8 | year = 1985 | month = August | pmid = 3939325 | doi = 10.1016/0028-3908(85)90002-4| url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid2049371">{{cite journal | author = Hegadoren KM, Baker GB, Coutts RT, Dewhurst WG | title = Interactions of iprindole with fenfluramine metabolism in rat brain and liver | journal = Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience : JPN | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–11 | year = 1991 | month = March | pmid = 2049371 | pmc = 1188281 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid6506759">{{cite journal | author = Yamamoto T, Takano R, Egashira T, Yamanaka Y | title = Metabolism of methamphetamine, amphetamine and p-hydroxymethamphetamine by rat-liver microsomal preparations in vitro | journal = Xenobiotica | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 867–75 | year = 1984 | month = November | pmid = 6506759 | doi = 10.3109/00498258409151485 | url = http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00498258409151485}}</ref><ref name="pmid1797102">{{cite journal | author = Coutts RT, Hussain MS, Baker GB | title = Effect of iprindole on the metabolism of trimipramine in the rat | journal = Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience : JPN | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 272–5 | year = 1991 | month = December | pmid = 1797102 | pmc = 1188365 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid8204417">{{cite journal | author = Aspeslet LJ, Baker GB, Coutts RT, Torok-Both GA | title = The effects of desipramine and iprindole on levels of enantiomers of fluoxetine in rat brain and urine | journal = Chirality | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–90 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8204417 | doi = 10.1002/chir.530060208 | url = }}</ref> It also inhibits its own degradation.<ref name="pmid1797102"/>

On account of these interactions, caution should be used when combining iprindole with other drugs.<ref name="pmid10379419"/> As an example, when administered with amphetamine or methamphetamine, iprindole increases their brain [[concentration]]s and prolongs their [[half-life|half-live]]s by 2- to 3-fold, strongly augmenting both their physiological effects and [[neurotoxicity]] in the process.<ref name="pmid839428">{{cite journal | author = Fuller RW, Baker JC, Molloy BB | title = Biological disposition of rigid analogs of amphetamine | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–2 | year = 1977 | month = February | pmid = 839428 | doi = 10.1002/jps.2600660235| url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid7384808">{{cite journal | author = Fuller RW, Hemrick-Luecke S | title = Long-lasting depletion of striatal dopamine by a single injection of amphetamine in iprindole-treated rats | journal = Science | volume = 209 | issue = 4453 | pages = 305–7 | year = 1980 | month = July | pmid = 7384808 | doi = 10.1126/science.7384808| url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7384808 | bibcode = 1980Sci...209..305F}}</ref><ref name="pmid6187915">{{cite journal | author = Peat MA, Warren PF, Gibb JW | title = Effects of a single dose of methamphetamine and iprindole on the serotonergic and dopaminergic system of the rat brain | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 225 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–31 | year = 1983 | month = April | pmid = 6187915 | doi = | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6187915}}</ref>

== Overdose ==

In [[overdose]], iprindole is much less [[toxic]] than most other TCAs and is considered relatively benign.<ref name="pmid3690249">{{cite journal | author = Cassidy S, Henry J | title = Fatal toxicity of antidepressant drugs in overdose | journal = British Medical Journal (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 295 | issue = 6605 | pages = 1021–4 | year = 1987 | month = October | pmid = 3690249 | pmc = 1248068 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.295.6605.1021| url = }}</ref> For instance, between 1974 and 1985, only two deaths associated with iprindole were recorded in the United Kingdom, whereas 278 were reported for imipramine.<ref name="pmid3690249"/> However, it should be noted that imipramine is prescribed much more often than iprindole, and for that reason this comparison is likely not entirely representative of iprindole's true capacity for fatality in overdose.
