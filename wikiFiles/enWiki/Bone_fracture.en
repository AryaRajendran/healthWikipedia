A '''bone fracture'''  (sometimes abbreviated '''FRX''' or '''Fx''', '''F<sub>x</sub>''', or '''#''') is a medical condition in which there is a break in the continuity of the [[bone]]. A bone fracture can be the result of high force [[Impact force|impact]] or [[Stress fracture|stress]], or trivial injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as [[osteoporosis]], [[bone cancer]], or [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], where the fracture is then properly termed a [[pathologic fracture]]. 

Although '''broken bone''' and '''bone break''' are common colloquialisms for a bone fracture, ''break'' is not a formal [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic]] term.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Xraymachine.JPG|thumb|[[Radiography]] to identify eventual fractures after a knee injury.]]
Although bone tissue itself contains no [[nociceptors]], bone fracture is painful for several reasons:<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/fracture/article.htm MedicineNet - Fracture] Medical Author: Benjamin C. Wedro, MD, FAAEM.</ref>

* Breaking in the continuity of the [[periosteum]], with or without similar discontinuity in [[endosteum]], as both contain multiple [[nociceptors]].

* [[Edema]] of nearby [[soft tissues]] caused by bleeding of torn periosteal blood vessels evokes pressure pain.

* [[Muscle spasms]] trying to hold bone fragments in place

Damage to adjacent structures such as nerves or vessels, spinal cord and nerve roots (for spine fractures), or cranial contents (for skull fractures) can cause other specific signs and symptoms.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Bone healing}}
The natural process of healing a fracture starts when the injured bone and surrounding tissues bleed, forming a fracture hematoma. The [[clotting|blood coagulates]] to form a blood [[clot]] situated between the broken fragments. Within a few days [[angiogenesis|blood vessels grow]] into the jelly-like matrix of the blood clot. The new blood vessels bring [[white blood cell|phagocyte]]s to the area, which gradually remove the non-viable material. The blood vessels also bring [[fibroblast]]s in the walls of the vessels and these multiply and produce [[collagen]] fibres. In this way the blood clot is replaced by a matrix of collagen. Collagen's rubbery consistency allows bone fragments to move only a small amount unless severe or persistent force is applied.

At this stage, some of the fibroblasts begin to lay down [[bone matrix]] in the form of collagen monomers. These monomers spontaneously assemble to form the bone matrix, for which bone crystals ([[calcium hydroxyapatite]]) are deposited in amongst, in the form of insoluble [[crystal]]s. This mineralization of the collagen matrix stiffens it and transforms it into bone. In fact, bone ''is'' a mineralized collagen matrix; if the mineral is dissolved out of bone, it becomes rubbery. Healing bone [[Fibrocartilage callus|callus]] is on average sufficiently mineralized to show up on [[X-ray]] within 6 weeks in adults and less in children. This initial "woven" bone does not have the strong mechanical properties of mature bone. By a process of remodeling, the woven bone is replaced by mature "lamellar" bone. The whole process can take up to 18 months, but in adults the strength of the healing bone is usually 80% of normal by 3 months after the injury.

Several factors can help or hinder the [[bone healing]] process. For example, any form of [[nicotine]] hinders the process of bone healing, and adequate nutrition (including [[calcium]] intake) will help the bone healing process. Weight-bearing stress on bone, after the bone has healed sufficiently to bear the weight, also builds bone strength.
Although there are theoretical concerns about [[NSAIDs]] slowing the rate of healing, there is not enough evidence to warrant withholding the use of this type analgesic in simple fractures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=162 |title=BestBets: Do non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause a delay in fracture healing? |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Effects of smoking===
Smokers generally have lower bone density than non-smokers, so have a much higher risk of fractures. There is also evidence that smoking delays bone healing. Some research indicates, for example, that it delays tibial shaft fracture healing from a median healing time of 136 to a median healing time of 269 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/painpag/wisdom/NSAIbone.html |title=Do NSAIDs inhibit bone healing? |publisher=Medicine.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> This means that the fracture healing time was approximately doubled in smokers. Although some other studies show less extreme effects, it is still shown that smoking delays fracture healing.

==Diagnosis==
A bone fracture can be diagnosed clinically based on the history given and the physical examination performed.  Imaging by X-ray is often performed to view the bone suspected of being fractured. In situations where [[x-ray]] alone is insufficient, a [[computed tomograph (CT scan)]] or MRI may be performed.

===Classification===
==== By cause ====
# Traumatic fracture - This is a fracture due to sustained trauma. e.g.- Fractures caused by a fall, road traffic accident, fight etc.
# Pathological fracture - A fracture through a bone which has been made weak by some underlying disease is called pathological fracture. e.g.- a fracture through a bone weakened by metastasis. Osteoporosis is the most common cause of pathological fracture.

====Orthopedic====
[[File:Offene Luxation.jpg|thumb|Open ankle fracture with luxation]]
In [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic]] [[medicine]], fractures are classified in various ways. Historically they are named after the doctor who first described the fracture conditions. However, there are more systematic classifications in place currently.

All fractures can be broadly described as:
* Closed (simple) fractures: are those in which the skin is intact
* Open (compound) fractures: involve wounds that communicate with the fracture, or where fracture [[hematoma]] is exposed, and may thus expose bone to [[contamination]]. Open injuries carry a higher risk of [[infection]].

Other considerations in fracture care are displacement (fracture gap) and angulation. If angulation or [[Displacement (orthopedic surgery)|displacement]] is large, ''reduction'' (manipulation) of the bone may be required and, in adults, frequently requires surgical care. These injuries may take longer to [[Healing|heal]] than injuries without [[Displacement (orthopedic surgery)|displacement]] or angulation.

* [[Compression fracture]]s: usually occurs in the vertebrae, for example when the front portion of a [[vertebra]] in the spine collapses due to [[osteoporosis]] (a medical condition which causes bones to become brittle and susceptible to fracture, with or without trauma).

Other types of fracture are:

* [[Complete fracture]]: A fracture in which bone fragments separate completely.
* Incomplete fracture: A fracture in which the bone fragments are still partially joined. In such cases, there is a crack in the osseous tissue that does not completely traverse the width of the bone.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/incomplete+fracture TheFreeDictionary > incomplete fracture] Citying: Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. Â© 2009</ref>
* Linear fracture: A fracture that is parallel to the bone's long axis.
* Transverse fracture: A fracture that is at a right angle to the bone's long axis.
* Oblique fracture: A fracture that is diagonal to a bone's long axis.
* [[Spiral fracture]]: A fracture where at least one part of the bone has been twisted.
* {{Visible anchor|Comminuted fracture}}: A fracture in which the bone has broken into several pieces.
* Impacted fracture: A fracture caused when bone fragments are driven into each other.
* [[Avulsion fracture]]: A fracture where a fragment of bone is separated from the main mass.

====Anatomical location====
An anatomical classification may begin with specifying the involved body part, such as the head or arm, followed with more specific localization. Fractures that have additional definition criteria than merely localization can often be classified as subtypes of fractures that merely are, such as a [[Holstein-Lewis fracture]] being a subtype of a [[humerus fracture]]. However, most typical examples in an orthopedic classification given in previous section cannot appropriately be classified into any specific part of an anatomical classification, as they may apply to multiple anatomical fracture sites.

* [[Bone]]: The OTA classification of a fracture starts by coding for the bone involved:
(1) [[Humerus fracture]], (2) [[Radius fracture]]/[[Ulnar fracture]], (3) [[Femoral fracture]], (4) [[Tibial fracture]]/[[Fibular fracture]], (5) [[Spinal fracture]], (6) [[Pelvic fracture]], (24) [[Carpal fracture]], (25) [[Metacarpal fracture]], (26) [[Phalanx fracture]] of the hand, (72) [[Talus fracture]], (73) [[Calcaneus fracture]], (74) [[Navicular fracture]], (75) [[Cuneiform bone fracture]], (76) [[Cuboid bone fracture]], (80) [[LisFranc fracture]], (81) [[Metatarsal fracture]], (82) [[Phalanx fracture]] of the foot, (45) [[Patella fracture]], (06) [[Clavicular fracture]], (09) [[Scapular fracture]]
* Location: a code for the part of the bone involved (e.g. shaft of the femur): [[proximal]]=1, [[Diaphysis|diaphyseal]]=2, [[distal]]=3 (at the ankle the [[malleolar region]] is considered separately due to the pre-existing [[Weber classification]] and coded as 4<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aofoundation.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hng7BARydDRwML1yBXAyMvYz8zEwNPQwN3A6B8JJK8gUWAm4GRk6m_oUlwgBFIHr9uP4_83FT9gtyIcgCExWfz/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfQzBWUUFCMUEwR0dSNTAySkowOFVIRzIwVDQ!/?segment=Proximal&bone=Radius&soloState=true&popupStyle=diagnosis&contentUrl=srg/popup/further_reading/PFxM2/15_Fx_Class.jsp|title=Proximal forearm - AO Surgery Reference}}</ref>). Except at the proximal femur the distal and proximal regions of the bone are defined by a square that is as wide as the as the distance between the [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]]s. The diaphysis is considered to be the rest of the bone between these two squares.
* Type: It is important to note whether the fracture is simple or multifragmentary and whether it is closed or open: A=simple fracture, B=wedge fracture, C=complex fracture
* Group: The geometry of the fracture is also described by terms such as transverse, oblique, [[spiral fracture|spiral]], or segmental.
* {{visible anchor|Subgroup}}: Other features of the fracture are described in terms of displacement (versus apposition, which is the degree at which the parts are in contact with each other), rotation, angulation and shortening. A stable fracture is one which is likely to stay in a good (functional) position while it heals; an unstable one is likely to get displaced, rotated, angulated or shortened before healing and lead to poor function in the long term.

==Treatment==
[[Image:K-Knie-z2.jpg|thumb|X-ray showing the proximal portion of a fractured [[tibia]] with an [[intramedullary rod|intramedullary nail]].]]
[[Image:Proximal femur nail.jpg|thumb|upright|Proximal femur nail with locking and stabilisation screws for treatment of femur fractures of left thigh.]]
Treatment of bone fractures are broadly classified as surgical or conservative, the latter basically referring to any non-surgical procedure, such as pain management, immobilization or other non-surgical stabilization. A similar classification is ''open'' versus ''closed treatment'', in which ''open treatment'' refers to any treatment in which the fracture site is surgically opened, regardless of whether the fracture itself is an [[#Classification|open]] or [[#Classification|closed fracture]].

===Pain management===
In arm fractures in children, [[ibuprofen]] has been found to be equally effective as the combination of [[acetaminophen]] and [[codeine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drendel AL, Gorelick MH, Weisman SJ, Lyon R, Brousseau DC, Kim MK |title=A randomized clinical trial of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen with codeine for acute pediatric arm fracture pain |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=553â60 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19692147 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.06.005 |url=}}</ref>

===Immobilization===
Since [[bone healing]] is a natural process which will most often occur, fracture treatment aims to ensure the best possible ''function'' of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures are typically treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called [[reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]], in good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray is all that is needed. This process is extremely painful without [[anesthesia]], about as painful as breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb is usually immobilized with a [[plaster]] or [[glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]] [[Cast (orthopedic)|cast]] or splint which holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. When the initial post-fracture edema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or [[orthosis]]. If being treated with surgery, [[intramedullary rod|surgical nails]], screws, plates and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the [[Ilizarov apparatus|Ilizarov method]] which is a form of external fixator.

Occasionally smaller bones, such as phalanges of the [[toes]] and [[finger]]s, may be treated without the cast, by [[buddy wrapping]] them, which serves a similar function to making a cast. By allowing only limited movement, fixation helps preserve anatomical alignment while enabling [[Fibrocartilage callus|callus]] formation, towards the target of achieving union.

Splinting results in the same outcome as casting in children who have a distal radius fracture with little shifting.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boutis K, Willan A, Babyn P, Goeree R, Howard A |title=Cast versus splint in children with minimally angulated fractures of the distal radius: a randomized controlled trial |journal=CMAJ |volume=182 |issue=14 |pages=1507â12 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20823169 |pmc=2950182 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.100119 |url=}}</ref>

===Surgery===
[[Surgery|Surgical]] methods of treating fractures have their own risks and benefits, but usually surgery is done only if conservative treatment has failed, is very likely to fail, or likely to result in a poor functional outcome. With some fractures such as [[hip fracture]]s (usually caused by [[osteoporosis]]), surgery is offered routinely because non-operative treatment results in prolonged immobilisation, which commonly results in complications including chest infections, pressure sores, deconditioning, [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) and [[pulmonary embolism]], which are more dangerous than surgery. When a joint surface is damaged by a [[fracture]], surgery is also commonly recommended to make an accurate anatomical reduction and restore the smoothness of the joint.

[[Infection]] is especially dangerous in bones, due to the recrudescent nature of bone infections. Bone tissue is predominantly [[extracellular matrix]], rather than living cells, and the few [[blood vessels]] needed to support this low metabolism are only able to bring a limited number of [[immune cell]]s to an injury to fight infection. For this reason, [[open fracture]]s and [[Osteotomy|osteotomies]] call for very careful [[antiseptic]] procedures and [[prophylactic]] antibiotics. 

Occasionally [[bone grafting]] is used to treat a fracture.

Sometimes bones are reinforced with metal. These [[implant (medicine)|implant]]s must be designed and installed with care. ''[[Stress shielding]]'' occurs when plates or screws carry too large of a portion of the bone's load, causing [[atrophy]]. This problem is reduced, but not eliminated, by the use of low-[[Young's modulus|modulus]] materials, including [[titanium]] and its alloys. The heat generated by the friction of installing hardware can easily accumulate and damage [[bone tissue]], reducing the strength of the connections. If dissimilar metals are installed in contact with one another (i.e., a titanium plate with [[cobalt]]-[[chromium]] alloy or [[stainless steel]] screws), galvanic [[corrosion]] will result. The metal [[ion]]s produced can damage the [[bone]] locally and may cause systemic effects as well.

[[Electrotherapy#Electrical bone growth stimulation|Electrical bone growth stimulation]] or [[osteostimulation]] has been attempted to speed or improve bone healing. Results however do not support its effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mollon B, da Silva V, Busse JW, Einhorn TA, Bhandari M |title=Electrical stimulation for long-bone fracture-healing: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=2322â30 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18978400 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.H.00111 |url=}}</ref>

===Complications===
[[Image:Nonunion2010.JPG|thumb|An old fracture with nonunion of the fracture fragments.]]
Some fractures can lead to serious complications including a condition known as [[compartment syndrome]]. If not treated, compartment syndrome can result in [[amputation]] of the affected limb. Other complications may include non-union, where the fractured bone fails to heal or mal-union, where the fractured bone heals in a deformed manner.

Complications of fractures can be classified into three broad groups depending upon their time of occurrence. These are as follows - 
# ''Immediate'' complications - occurs at the time of the fracture.
# ''Early'' complications - occurring in the initial few days after the fracture.
# ''Late'' complications - occurring a long time after the fracture.

==In children==
{{Main|Child bone fracture}}
In children, whose bones are still developing, there are risks of either a growth plate injury or a [[greenstick fracture]].
* A greenstick fracture occurs due to mechanical failure on the tension side. That is, since the bone is not as brittle as it would be in an adult, it does not completely fracture, but rather exhibits bowing without complete disruption of the bone's [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] in the surface opposite the applied force.
* Growth plate injuries, as in [[Salter-Harris fractures]], require careful treatment and accurate reduction to make sure that the bone continues to grow normally.
* [[Plasticity (physics)|Plastic deformation]] of the bone, in which the bone permanently bends but does not break, is also possible in children. These injuries may require an [[osteotomy]] (bone cut) to realign the bone if it is fixed and cannot be realigned by closed  methods.
*Certain fractures are known to occur mainly in the pediatric age group, such as fracture of the [[clavicle]] & supracondylar fracture of the [[humerus]].
