* to help patients and their relatives with the problems arising from Parkinson's
* to collect and disseminate information on Parkinson's
* to encourage and provide funds for research into Parkinson's

==Research==
Parkinson's UK is the largest charitable funder of Parkinson's research in the UK and have so far invested more than £50million in research. The charity aims to 'find a cure and improve life for everyone affected by Parkinson's'.

In 2009 the charity produced 'Four decades of discovery' - a booklet describing the key research achievements of the charity since 1969 which included the development of new drugs, an improved understanding of Parkinson's, and better diagnosis and care for people with the condition.<ref>[http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/research/research_achievements.aspx Parkinson's UK research achievements]</ref>

In 2010 the charity spent £4.6 million on new Parkinson's research projects<ref>[http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/research/current-research.aspx Parkinson's UK current research]</ref> and launched a new 5 year research strategy called 'Our plan to cure Parkinson's'.<ref>[http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/advice/publications/about_us/our_impact_2010.aspx Parkinson's UK impact in 2010]</ref> The new strategy focuses on four central challenges:

* Understanding why nerve cells die in Parkinson's
* Developing new animal models of Parkinson's
* Faster, better drug screening
* Finding 'biomarkers' for earlier diagnosis

These priorities reflect the charity's focus on basic laboratory research to understand what causes Parkinson's, how it develops, and translational research to develop new treatments that slow, stop or reverse the condition. The charity also funds research to help better understand Parkinson's to improve treatment and care for people currently living with the condition.<ref>[http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/research/our_plan_to_cure_parkinsons.aspx Parkinson's UK's plan to cure Parkinson's]</ref>
