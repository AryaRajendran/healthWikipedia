The '''Flynn effect''' is the substantial and long-sustained increase in intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from roughly 1930 to the present day. When [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) tests are initially [[Standard score#Standardizing in mathematical statistics|standardized]] using a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their [[standard deviation]] is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100. However, when the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.

Test score increases have been continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to the present. For the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] test, subjects born over a 100 year period were compared in [[Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], and separately in [[Dumfries]], Scotland. Improvements were remarkably consistent across the whole period, in both countries.<ref name=R2000>Raven, John (2000). The Raven’s Progressive Matrices: Change and Stability over Culture and Time.

There are numerous proposed explanations of the Flynn effect, as well as some skepticism about its implications. Similar improvements have been reported for other cognitions such as [[semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]].<ref name="Rönnlund">{{cite journal |author=Rönnlund M, Nilsson LG |title=Flynn effects on sub-factors of episodic and semantic memory: parallel gains over time and the same set of determining factors |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=2174–80 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19056409 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.11.007 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0028-3932(08)00442-9}}</ref> Recent research suggests that the Flynn effect may have ended in at least a few developed nations, possibly allowing [[Nations and intelligence|national differences in IQ scores]]<ref name="IQGI">Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen (2006).

==Etymology==
The Flynn effect is named for [[James R. Flynn]], who did much to document it and promote awareness of its implications. The term itself was coined by [[Richard Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (author)|Charles Murray]], authors of ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.<ref name=Flynn>{{Cite book|author=Flynn, James R. |title=What Is Intelligence: Beyond the Flynn Effect |edition=expanded paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-74147-7 |year=2009 |laysummary=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/flynn-beyond/ |laydate=July 18, 2010 |pages=1–2 |quote=The 'Flynn effect' is the name that has become attached to an exciting development, namely, that the twentieth century saw massive IQ gains from one generation to another.

==Rise in IQ==
IQ tests are updated periodically. For example, the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC), originally developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, in 1991, and again in 2003. The revised versions are [[standardized]] to 100 using new standardization samples. In ordinary use IQ tests are scored with respect to those standardization samples. The only way to compare the difficulty of two versions of a test is to conduct a study in which the same subjects take both versions. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the U.S. on tests such as the WISC. The increasing raw scores appear on every major test, in every age range and in every modern industrialized country although not necessarily at the same rate as in the U.S. using the WISC. The increase has been continuous and roughly linear from the earliest days of testing to the present.<ref name="Neisser97">{{cite journal |author=Neisser U |title=Rising Scores on Intelligence Tests |journal=American Scientist |volume=85 |pages=440–7 |year=1997 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/rising-scores-on-intelligence-tests/1}}</ref> Though the effect is most associated with IQ increases, a similar effect has been found with increases of [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]].<ref name="Rönnlund"/>

[[Ulric Neisser]] estimates that using the IQ values of today the average IQ of the U.S. in 1932, according to the first [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales]] standardization sample, was 80. Neisser states that "Hardly any of them would have scored 'very superior,' but nearly one-quarter would have appeared to be 'deficient.'" He also writes that "Test scores are certainly going up all over the world, but whether intelligence itself has risen remains controversial."<ref name="Neisser97"/>

Raven (2000) found that, as Flynn suggested, data interpreted as showing a decrease in many abilities with increasing age must be re-interpreted as showing that there has been a dramatic increase of these abilities with date of birth. On many tests this occurs at all levels of ability.<ref name=R2000 />

Some studies have found the gains of the Flynn effect to be particularly concentrated at the lower end of the distribution. Teasdale and Owen (1989), for example, found the effect primarily reduced the number of low-end scores, resulting in an increased number of moderately high scores, with no increase in very high scores.<ref name=TO1987>{{cite doi|10.1016/0160-2896(89)90021-4}}</ref> In another study, two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30-year gap. Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that the mean IQ-scores on the test had increased by 9.7 points (the Flynn effect), the gains were concentrated in the lower half of the distribution and negligible in the top half, and the gains gradually decreased as the IQ of the individuals increased.<ref name="Colom2005">{{cite journal | url=http://synapse.princeton.edu/~brained/chapter15/colom_andres-pueyo05_intelligence_Spanish-schoolchildren-nutrition-hypothesis.pdf | title=The generational intelligence gains are caused by decreasing variance in the lower half of the distribution: Supporting evidence for the nutrition hypothesis | author=Colom, R., Lluis-Font, J.M., and Andrés-Pueyo, A. | journal=Intelligence | year=2005 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=83–91 | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.07.010}}</ref> Some studies have found a reverse Flynn effect with declining scores for those with high IQ.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>

Flynn originally took the extreme position that the very large increase indicates that IQ tests do not measure intelligence but only a minor sort of "abstract problem-solving ability" with little practical significance. He argued that if IQ gains do reflect intelligence increases, there would have been consequent changes of our society that have not been observed (a presumed non-occurrence of a "cultural renaissance").<ref name="Neisser97"/> Flynn has later changed his arguments as noted in the next section.

===Intelligence===
{{See also|g factor (psychometrics)|Fluid and crystallized intelligence}}

There is debate about whether the rise in IQ scores also corresponds to a rise in intelligence, or a rise in skills related to taking IQ tests. Because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as [[vocabulary]], [[arithmetic]] or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. The greatest Flynn effects occur instead for tests that measure latent factors. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.<ref name="Neisser97"/> But this rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence. Studies have shown that while test scores have improved over time, the improvement is not fully correlated with latent factors related to intelligence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Must O, Must A and Raudik V | year = 2003 | title = The secular rise in IQs: In Estonia, the Flynn effect is not a Jensen effect | journal = Intelligence | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 461–471 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(03)00013-8 | url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/Must2003.pdf}}</ref> [[J.

==Proposed explanations==
{{See also|Health and intelligence}}

Attempted explanations have included improved nutrition, a trend toward smaller families, better education, greater environmental complexity, and [[heterosis]] (the occurrence of genetically superior offspring from mixing the genes of its parents).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mingroni, M.A. | title=The secular rise in IQ: Giving heterosis a closer look | journal=Intelligence | year=2004 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=65–83 | doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(03)00058-8}}</ref> Another proposition is the gradual spread of test-taking skills.<ref name="Neisser97"/> The Flynn effect has been too rapid for genetic selection to be the cause.<ref name = "BlairGamsonThorneBaker2005">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.07.008 |author=Blair C, Gamson D, Thorne S, Baker D |title=Rising mean IQ: Cognitive demand of mathematics education for young children, population exposure to formal schooling, and the neurobiology of the prefrontal cortex |journal=Intelligence |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=93–106 |year=2005 |url=http://language.la.psu.edu/~thorne/Intelligence2005.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

===Schooling and test familiarity===
Duration of average schooling has increased steadily. One problem with this explanation is that if in the US comparing older and more recent subjects with similar educational levels, then the IQ gains appear almost undiminished in each such group considered individually.<ref name="Neisser97"/> 

Many studies find that children who do not attend school score lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers. During the 1960s, when some [[Virginia]] counties [[Massive resistance|closed their public schools to avoid racial integration]], compensatory private schooling was available only for Caucasian children. On average, the scores of African-American children who did not receive formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six IQ points per year.<ref name="Neisser97"/>

Another explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing. For example, children who take the very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and other related to the schooling is, as noted above, that in the US those subsets one would expect to be affected the most show the least increases.<ref name="Neisser97"/>

[[Early intervention]] programs have shown mixed results. Some preschool (ages 3–4) intervention programs like "[[Head Start Program|Head Start]]" do not produce lasting changes of IQ, although they may confer other benefits. The "[[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]]", an all-day program that provided various forms of [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]] to children from infancy onward, showed IQ gains that did not diminish over time. The IQ difference between the groups, although only five points, was still present at age 12. Not all such projects have been successful.<ref name="Neisser97"/> Also, such IQ gains can diminish until age 18.<ref>{{cite book |author=Plomin R., DeFries J.C., Craig I.W., McGuffin P. |title=Behavioral genetics in the postgenomic era |year=2003 |edition=4th }}</ref> 

Citing a high correlation between rising literacy rates and gains in IQ, [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] has argued that the Flynn effect is caused by changes in literacy rates.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2466/pr0.106.3.643-664 |author=David F Marks|title=IQ variations across time, race, and nationality:an artifact of differences in literacy skills|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=106 |issue=3|pages=643–664|year=2010 |pmid=20712152}}</ref>

===Generally more stimulating environment===
Still another theory is that the general environment today is much more complex and stimulating. One of the most striking 20th century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of [[visual media]]. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why tests like the Raven's have shown the greatest increases—they depend on such analysis. This explanation may imply that IQ tests do not necessarily measure a general intelligence factor, especially not Raven's as often argued, but instead may measure different types of intelligence that are developed by different experiences (this argument is against the notion of an underlying general intelligence, or g factor). An increase only of particular form(s) of intelligence would explain why the Flynn effect has not caused a "cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked."<ref name="Neisser97"/>

In 2001, Dickens and Flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure "[[heritability]]" includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in [[gene environment correlation]]. The direct effect could initially have been very small but [[feedback]] can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.<ref name=Dickens01>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346 |author=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346–369 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

Flynn in his 2007 book ''[[What Is Intelligence?]]'' further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization&nbsp;— such as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology and smaller families&nbsp;— have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question 'What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?' A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or ''a priori'' answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words 'dog' and 'rabbit' ), whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or ''a posteriori'' answer, which depended on what happened to be the case at that time).

===Nutrition===
Improved nutrition is another possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain.<ref name="Neisser97"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Jantz |first=R. |last2=Meadows Jantz |first2=L. |year=2000 |title=Secular change in craniofacial morphology |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=12 |issue= |pages=327–338 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200005/06)12:3<327::AID-AJHB3>3.0.CO;2-1 |pmid=11534023}}</ref> This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs. However, data now show that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have ''larger'' brains and higher IQs than average whites.<ref name=Lynn>Lynn, Richard (2006). Race Differences in Intelligence. An Evolutionary Analysis. Washington Summit Publishers, Augusta, GA, USA.</ref>

A 2005 study presented data supporting the nutrition hypothesis, which predicts that gains will occur predominantly at the low end of the IQ distribution, where nutritional deprivation is probably most severe.<ref name="Colom2005"/> An alternative interpretation of [[skewed]] IQ gains could be that improved education has been particularly important for this group.<ref name=TO1987/> [[Richard Lynn]] makes the case for nutrition, arguing that cultural factors cannot typically explain the Flynn effect because its gains are observed even at infant and preschool levels, with rates of IQ test score increase about equal to those of school students and adults. Lynn states that "This rules out improvements in education, greater test sophistication, etc. and most of the other factors that have been proposed to explain the Flynn effect. He proposes that the most probable factor has been improvements in pre-natal and early post-natal nutrition."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lynn, Richard |title=What has caused the Flynn effect?

[[Image:Phenotypic plasticity diagram.svg|thumb|300px|Changes in an environmental variable (e.g. human nutrition) may cause different genes to be [[gene expression|expressed]] during childhood.]]
A century ago, [[micronutrient|nutritional]] deficiencies may have limited body and organ functionality, including skull volume. The first two years of life is a critical time for nutrition. The consequences of malnutrition can be irreversible and may include poor cognitive development, educability, and future economic productivity.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition |year=2008 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-and-child-undernutrition}}</ref> On the other hand, Flynn has pointed to 20-point gains on Dutch military ([[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's]] type) IQ tests between 1952, 1962, 1972, and 1982. He observes that the Dutch 18-year-olds of 1962 had a major nutritional handicap. They were either in the womb, or were recently born, during the great [[Dutch famine of 1944]]&nbsp;– when German troops monopolized food and 18,000 people died of starvation.<ref>C. Banning (1946).

Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science Vol. 245, The Netherlands during German Occupation (May, 1946), pp. 93-110</ref> Yet, concludes Flynn, "they do not show up even as a blip in the pattern of Dutch IQ gains.

===Infectious diseases===
Eppig, Fincher, and Thornhill (2009) argue that "From an energetics standpoint, a developing human will have difficulty building a brain and fighting off [[infectious disease]]s at the same time, as both are very metabolically costly tasks" and that "the Flynn effect may be caused in part by the decrease in the intensity of infectious diseases as nations develop." They suggest that improvements in [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), education, literacy, and nutrition may have an effect on IQ mainly through reducing the intensity of infectious diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eppig C, Fincher CL, Thornhill R |title=Parasite prevalence and the worldwide distribution of cognitive ability |journal=Proc.

Eppig, Fincher, and Thornhill (2011) in a similar study instead looking at different US states found that in states with higher prevalence of infectious diseases had lower average IQ. The effect remained after controlling for the effects of wealth and educational variation.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.intell.2011.02.008}}</ref>

Atheendar Venkataramani (2010) studied the effect of [[malaria]] on IQ in a sample of Mexicans. Exposure during the birth year to malaria eradication was associated with increases in IQ. It also increased the probability of employment in a skilled occupation. The author suggests that this may be one explanation for the Flynn effect and that this may be an important explanation for the link between national malaria burden and economic development.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Venkataramani, Atheendar |title=Early Life Exposure to Malaria and Cognition and Skills in Adulthood: Evidence from Mexico |date=September 18, 2010 |ssrn=1679164}}</ref> A literature review of 44 papers states that cognitive abilities and school performance were shown to be impaired in sub-groups of patients (with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria) when compared with healthy controls.

===Heterosis===
[[Heterosis]], or hybrid vigor associated with historical reductions of the levels of inbreeding, has been proposed by Michael Mingroni as an alternative explanation of the Flynn effect. However, according to other researchers, the possible increase in IQ brought about by heterosis is too small to be a complete explanation. James Flynn has argued that even if everyone married his brother or sister in 1900, this would not be a sufficient explanation of the IQ gains.<ref>Mackintosh, N.J. (2011). ''IQ and Human Intelligence''. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, p. 291.</ref>

==Adjustments==
IQ tests need to be adjusted to account for the Flynn effect. Using an old test can lead to too high scores, preventing people with a lower intellectual ability to be recognized as such and get the accommodations they are entitled to. For instance, in the United States a diagnosis of [[mental retardation]] prevents execution.<ref name=Kaufman2009>IQ Testing 101, Alan S.

Jon Martin Sundet and colleagues (2004) examined scores on intelligence tests given to [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[conscripts]] between the 1950s and 2002. They found that the increase of scores of general intelligence stopped after the mid-1990s and declined in numerical reasoning sub-tests.<ref name="doi10.1016/j.intell.2004.06.004"/>

Teasdale and Owen (2005) examined the results of IQ tests given to [[Denmark|Danish]] male conscripts. Between 1959 and 1979 the gains were 3 points per decade. Between 1979 and 1989 the increase approached 2 IQ points. Between 1989 and 1998 the gain was about 1.3 points. Between 1998 and 2004 IQ declined by about the same amount as it gained between 1989 and 1998. They speculate that "a contributing factor in this recent fall could be a simultaneous decline in proportions of students entering 3-year advanced-level school programs for 16–18 year olds."<ref name="Teasdale2005">{{cite journal|author=Teasdale TW & Owen DR|year=2005|title=A long-term rise and recent decline in intelligence test performance: The Flynn Effect in reverse|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=39|issue=4|pages=837–843|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.01.029}}</ref> The same authors in a more comprehensive 2008 study, again on Danish male conscripts, found that there was a 1.5 points increase between 1988 and 1998, but a 1.5 points decrease between 1998 and 2003/2004. A possible contributing factor to the recent decline may be changes in the Danish educational system. Another may be the rising proportion of immigrants or their immediate descendants in Denmark. This is supported by data on Danish draftees where first or second generation immigrants with Danish nationality score below average.<ref name = "reversal" />

In Australia, 6–11 year olds IQ, as measured by the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Colored Progressive Matrices]], has shown no increase from 1975–2003.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Cotton | first1= S.

In the United Kingdom, a study by Flynn (2009) found that tests carried out in 1980 and again in 2008 show that the IQ score of an average 14-year-old dropped by more than two points over the period. For the upper half of the results the performance was even worse. Average IQ scores declined by six points. However, children aged between five and 10 saw their IQs increase by up to half a point a year over the three decades. Flynn argues that the abnormal drop in British teenage IQ could be due to youth culture having "stagnated" or even dumbed down. He also states that the youth culture is more oriented towards computer games than towards reading and holding conversations. Researcher Richard Gray, commenting on the study, also mentions the computer culture diminishing reading books as well as a tendency towards [[teaching to the test]].<ref>{{cite news |title=British teenagers have lower IQs than their counterparts did 30 years ago |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4548943/British-teenagers-have-lower-IQs-than-their-counterparts-did-30-years-ago.html |publisher=The Telegraph |date=February 7, 2009 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Gray}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ehb.2009.01.009}}</ref>

Lynn and Harvey have argued that the causes of the above are difficult to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is a limit to how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between [[fertility and intelligence]]. They estimate that there has been a [[dysgenic]] decline in the world's [[genotypic]] IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the [[phenotype]]) of 0.86 IQ points for the years 1950–2000. A further decline of 1.28 IQ points in the world's genotypic IQ is projected for the years 2000–2050.<ref name=LH2008>>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.intell.2007.03.004}}</ref> Similarly, but looking at phenotypic IQ, Meisenberg has argued that both higher GDP and IQ independently reduce [[fertility]]. The study argues that "at present rates of fertility and mortality and in the absence of changes within countries, the average IQ of the young world population would decline by 1.34 points per decade and the average per capita income would decline by 0.79% per year."<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/S0021932009003344}}</ref>

If there have been declines in national IQs this may have causes other than those proposed above. In an essay published online in The Lancet, two researchers have warned that exposure to industrial chemicals may be responsible for a "silent pandemic" of brain development disorders.<ref name="ASilentPandemicOfBrainDisorders">{{cite news

==IQ group differences==
{{main|Nations and intelligence|Race and intelligence}}
If the Flynn effect has ended in developed nations, then this may possibly allow [[Nations and intelligence|national differences in IQ scores]] to diminish if the Flynn effect continues in nations with lower average national IQs.<ref name = "reversal" />

Also, if the Flynn effect has ended for the majority in developed nations, it may still continue for minorities, especially for groups like immigrants where many may have received poor nutrition during early childhood or have had other disadvantages. A study in the [[Netherlands]] found that children of non-Western immigrants had improvements for ''g'', educational achievements, and work proficiency compared to their parents, although there were still remaining differences compared to ethnic Dutch.<ref name=Nijenhuis04/>

There is a controversy as to whether the [[Race and intelligence|US racial gap in IQ scores]] is diminishing. If that is the case then this may or may not be related to the Flynn effect. Rushton and Jensen argue against expecting the Flynn Effect to narrow the US black-white IQ gap, since they see that gap as mostly genetic in origin, and there is evidence from mathematical analyses that what causes the Flynn effect is different from what causes the black-white gap.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.intell.2009.12.002}}</ref> Flynn has replied that he never claimed that the Flynn effect has the same causes as the black-white gap, but that it shows that environmental factors can create IQ differences of a magnitude similar to the gap.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.intell.2010.05.001}}</ref>

The Flynn effect has also been part of the discussions regarding [[Spearman's hypothesis]], which states that differences in the [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] are the major source of differences between blacks and whites observed in many studies of race and intelligence.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/0003-066X.54.1.5}}</ref>
