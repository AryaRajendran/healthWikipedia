==Canada (April 2007, August 2008)==
[[Dalhousie University]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Dalhousie University was struck with an outbreak of the mumps confirmed in many students with suspected cases in dozens of others. The main causes of the large outbreak include students being unaware of being infected, and other students who knowingly ignored quarantine restrictions. The outbreak began after [[St. Patrick's Day]], and has spread beyond the university community, with confirmed cases reaching 350 cases of mumps since February, including about 24 new cases that have surfaced during the week ending June 9, 2007.  The end of the university year in May meant that many students travelled to their homes across the country carrying the infection, leading to a large scale spread, the extent of which is still not clear, although the prevalence of the disease lay in people aged 17 to 24.  Roughly 50 personnel of the Halifax-based navy ship HMCS ''Glace Bay'' were sent home as a precaution.  Reported outbreaks have begun in [[New Brunswick]] (Approximately 100 cases), [[Prince Edward Island]] (2 cases), [[Ontario]] (3 cases confirmed, 5 suspected), West Coast of Newfoundland (2 cases),<ref name="vocm.com_news">{{cite web|url=http://www.vocm.com/news-info.asp?id=21158|title=West Coast Woman Diagnosed With Mumps|date="06 June 2007"|publisher="vocm.com"}}</ref> and [[Toronto]] (3 cases).

A catch-up programme of immunisation of under twenty-five-year-olds, particularly in university towns such as [[Exeter]] was implemented.

===Iowa (2005–2006)===
In early 2006, for reasons still not fully understood, the state of [[Iowa]] experienced a large surge in the number of reported mumps infections.<ref name=MMWR_2006a>{{cite journal |author= CDC |title=Exposure to mumps during air travel—United States, April 2006 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |year=2006 |pages=401–2 |volume=55 |issue=14 |pmid=16617290 }}</ref> [http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5513a3.htm] According to the [[New York Times]], college students accounted for about a quarter of the 245 cases [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/us/01mumps.html?ex=1301544000&en=1c014c388ceee9ae&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss], while about half of the cases are people aged seventeen to twenty five.
Doctors are attributing the rise in mumps case frequency to low vaccination rates in Iowa's youth, coupled with the close quarters in dormitories, classrooms and cafeterias.
{{cquote|When you expect five and you get 245, this is pretty serious... We're trying to get ahead of it and get it stopped... It could be that on some of these college campuses, they were not as well vaccinated as we'd like them to be, [but] our law does not allow us to identify entities associated with outbreaks.|Patricia Quinlisk|state epidemiologist at the Iowa department of public health}}
