'''''Naegleria fowleri''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|n|ə|ˈ|ɡ|l|ɪər|i|ə}}) is a free-living [[excavate]] form of [[protist]] typically found in warm bodies of fresh water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and hot springs. It is also found in soil, near warm-water discharges of [[Manufacturing plant|industrial plants]], and unchlorinated or poorly chlorinated [[swimming pools]] in an [[amoeboid]] or temporary [[flagellate]] stage.  There is no evidence of this organism living in salt water. It is an [[Amoeboid|amoeba]] belonging to the groups [[Percolozoa]] or Heterolobosea.

''N. fowleri'' can invade and attack the human nervous system. Although this occurs rarely,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html |title=The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Parasitic Diseases - Naegleria FAQs |accessdate=2012-01-14 }}</ref> such an infection nearly always results in the death of the victim.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=6 die from brain-eating amoeba after swimming |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21034344/ |publisher=MSNBC |date=September 28, 2007}}</ref> The [[case fatality rate]] is estimated at 98%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/parasites/ParaSites2010/Katherine_Fero/FeroNaegleriafowleri.htm |title=Naegleria fowleri |publisher=Stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Onset symptoms of infection start about five days (range is from one to seven days) after exposure. The initial symptoms include, but are not limited to, changes in taste and smell, headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and stiff neck. Secondary symptoms include confusion, hallucinations, lack of attention, [[ataxia]], and seizures. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly over three to seven days, with death occurring from seven to 14 days after exposure.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html#symptoms</ref>

==Cause==
[[File:Free-living amebic infections.png|thumb|Life cycle of ''N. fowleri'' and other free-living Amoebae. Click to enlarge and view caption.]]
In humans, ''N. fowleri'' can invade the [[central nervous system]] via the nose (specifically through the [[olfactory mucosa]] and [[cribriform plate]] of the nasal tissues). The penetration initially results in significant [[necrosis]] of and [[hemorrhaging]] in the [[olfactory bulb]]s. From there, the amoeba climbs along [[nerve]] fibers through the floor of the cranium via the [[cribriform plate]] and into the brain. The organism begins to consume cells of the brain piecemeal by means of a unique sucking apparatus extended from its cell surface.<ref name="Cytopathogenicity">{{cite journal|pmid=6852919 |pmc=348179 |year=1983 |last1=Marciano-Cabral |first1=F |last2=John |first2=DT |title=Cytopathogenicity of Naegleria fowleri for rat neuroblastoma cell cultures: scanning electron microscopy study |volume=40 |issue=3|pages=1214–7 |journal=Infection and immunity}}</ref>  It then becomes [[pathogenic]], causing [[primary amoebic meningoencephalitis]] (PAM or PAME).

While [[miltefosine]] had therapeutic effects during an ''[[in vivo]]'' study in mice, [[chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine) showed to be the most effective substance - the authors concluded: "Chlorpromazine had the best therapeutic activity against ''N. fowleri in vitro'' and ''in vivo''. Therefore, it may be a more useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of PAME than amphotericin B."<ref>{{cite journal |pages=4010–6 |doi=10.1128/AAC.00197-08 |title=Effect of Therapeutic Chemical Agents In Vitro and on Experimental Meningoencephalitis Due to Naegleria fowleri |year=2008 |last1=Kim|first1=J.-H. |last2=Jung |first2=S.-Y. |last3=Lee |first3=Y.-J. |last4=Song |first4=K.-J. |last5=Kwon |first5=D.|last6=Kim |first6=K. |last7=Park |first7=S. |last8=Im |first8=K.-I. |last9=Shin |first9=H.-J. |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=52 |issue=11 |pmid=18765686 |pmc=2573150}}</ref>

Untimely diagnoses remain a very significant impediment to the successful treatment of infection, as most cases have only been discovered ''post mortem''. Infection killed 121 people in the United States from 1937 through 2007.

===Life cycle===
[[File:Naegleria fowleri lifecycle stages.JPG|thumb|right|Biotic phases: cyst, flagellate, trophozoite]]
''Naegleria fowleri'' occurs in three forms: a cyst, a trophozoite (ameboid) and a flagellate.

;Cyst stage
Trophozoites encyst due to unfavorable conditions. Factors that induce [[Microbial cyst|cyst]] formation can include food deprivation, crowding, desiccation, accumulation of waste products, and cold temperatures.<ref name="M1988"/> ''N. fowleri'' has been found to encyst at temperatures below 10°C.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=637538 |pmc=242840 |year=1978 |last1=Chang |first1=SL |title=Resistance of pathogenic Naegleria to some common physical and chemical agents |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=368–75 |journal=Applied and environmental microbiology}}</ref>

;Trophozoite stage
This reproductive stage of the protozoan organism, which transforms near 25°C and grows fastest at around 42°C, proliferates by [[binary fission]]. The trophozoites are characterized by a nucleus and a surrounding halo. They travel by [[pseudopod]]ia, temporary round processes which fill with granular cytoplasm. The pseudopodia form at different points along the cell, thus allowing the trophozoite to change directions. In their free-living state, trophozoites feed on bacteria. In tissues, they [[Phagocytosis|phagocytize]] red blood cells and white blood cells and destroy tissue.<ref name="M1988"/>

;Flagellate stage
This biflagellate form occurs when trophozites are exposed to a change in ionic concentration, such as placement in distilled water. The transformation of trophozoites to [[flagellum|flagellate]] form occurs within a few minutes.<ref name="M1988">{{cite journal |pmid=3280964 |pmc=372708 |year=1988 |last1=Marciano-Cabral |first1=F |title=Biology of Naegleria spp |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=114–33 |journal=Microbiological reviews}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
''N. fowleri'' can be grown in several kinds of liquid [[axenic]] media or on non-nutrient [[agar]] plates coated with bacteria. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' can be used to overlay the non-nutrient agar plate and a drop of cerebrospinal fluid sediment is added to it. Plates are then incubated at 37°C and checked daily for clearing of the agar in thin tracks, which indicate the trophozoites have fed on the bacteria.<ref>{{cite book |author=Donald C. Lehman; Mahon, Connie; Manuselis, George |title=Textbook of Diagnostic Microbiology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |isbn=1-4160-2581-2 |edition=3rd}}{{Page needed|date=August 2011}}</ref> Detection in water is performed by [[centrifuge|centrifuging]] a water sample with ''E. coli'' added, then applying the pellet to a non-nutrient agar plate. After several days, the plate is microscopically inspected and ''Naegleria'' cysts are identified by their morphology. Final confirmation of the species' identity can be performed by various molecular or biochemical methods.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=3102–7 |doi=10.1128/AEM.68.6.3102-3107.2002 |pmc=123984 |title=Rapid Detection and Enumeration of Naegleria fowleri in Surface Waters by Solid-Phase Cytometry |year=2002 |last1=Pougnard |first1=C. |last2=Catala |first2=P. |last3=Drocourt |first3=J.-L. |last4=Legastelois |first4=S. |last5=Pernin |first5=P. |last6=Pringuez |first6=E. |last7=Lebaron |first7=P. |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=68 |issue=6 |pmid=12039772}}</ref>
Confirmation of ''Naegleria'' presence can be done by a so-called flagellation test, where the organism is exposed to a hypotonic environment ([[distilled water]]). ''Naegleria'', in contrast to other amoebae, differentiates within two hours into the flagellate state.
Pathogenicity can be further confirmed by exposure to high temperature (42°C): ''Naegleria fowleri'' is able to grow at this temperature, but the nonpathogenic ''Naegleria gruberi'' is not.

==History==
Physicians M. Fowler and R. F. Carter first described human disease caused by amebo-flagellates in Australia in 1965.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=5825411 |pmc=1846173 |year=1965 |last1=Fowler |first1=M |last2=Carter |first2=RF|title=Acute pyogenic meningitis probably due to Acanthamoeba sp.: a preliminary report |volume=2 |issue=5464 |pages=740–2|journal=British Medical Journal}}</ref> Their work on amebo-flagellates has provided an example of how a protozoan can effectively live both freely in the environment, and in a human host.  Since 1965, more than 144 cases have been confirmed in a variety of countries. In 1966, Fowler termed the infection resulting from ''N. fowleri'' primary amoebic[[meningoencephalitis]] (PAM) to distinguish this central nervous system (CNS) invasion from other secondary invasions caused by other true amoebas such as ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1473–6|doi=10.1056/NEJM196606302742605 |title=Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis |year=1966 |last1=Butt |first1=Cecil G.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=274 |issue=26 |pmid=5939846}}</ref> A retrospective study determined the first documented case of PAM possibly occurred in Britain in 1909.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=5354833 |pmc=1630535|year=1969 |last1=Symmers |first1=WC |title=Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in Britain |volume=4 |issue=5681|pages=449–54 |journal=British Medical Journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.4.5681.449}}</ref>
==Society and culture==
''N. fowleri'' was featured in the second season of ''[[House (TV series)|House M.D.]]'' in the two-part episode "[[Euphoria (Part 1)]]" and "[[Euphoria (Part 2)]]". The amoeba was determined to be living in the water supply the deceased patient used to irrigate his [[marijuana]] garden. <!-- not this species A case of amoebic meningitis (the precise causative organism was not specified) from water inhaled from a [[neti pot]] (an increasingly common source of infection) was determined to be the diagnosis in the eighth season ''House M.D.'' episode "[[We Need the Eggs]]".-->

The X-Files Season 1. Episode 20 "Darkness Falls" makes mention of "N. Fowleri".

In August 2009, ''N. fowleri'' was featured in the Animal Planet television series called ''[[Monsters Inside Me]]'' on the sixth episode entitled "Hijackers". The episode documented the story of how 11-year-old Will Sellars got infected with it by wakeboarding on a lake in Orlando, Florida, in July 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animal.discovery.com/invertebrates/monsters-inside-me/brain-eating-amoeba-naegleria/ |title='The Brain-Eating Amoeba, aka Naegleria fowleri' |publisher='Discovery Communications, LLC' |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>

On November 30, 2012, ''[[Monsters Inside Me]]'' (Season 3 Episode 9) featured Kyle Lewis's story.
==Research==
===Diagnostics===
Current research is focused on development of real time [[PCR]] diagnostic methods. One method being developed involves monitoring the amplification process in real time with [[hybridization]] of fluorescent-labeled probes targeting the [[MpC15]] sequence – which is unique to ''N. fowleri''.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=37–41 |doi=10.1016/j.exppara.2009.11.001 |title=A real-time PCR diagnostic method for detection of Naegleria fowleri |year=2010 |last1=Maďarová |first1=Lucia |last2=Trnková |first2=Katarína |last3=Feiková |first3=Soňa |last4=Klement |first4=Cyril |last5=Obernauerová |first5=Margita |journal=Experimental Parasitology |volume=126 |pmid=19919836 |issue=1}}</ref>  Another group has multiplexed three real-time PCR reactions as a diagnostic for ''N. fowleri'', as well as ''Acanthamoeba'' spp. and  ''Balamuthia mandrillaris''.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=3589–95 |pmc=1594764 |doi=10.1128/JCM.00875-06 |title=Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assay for Simultaneous Detection of Acanthamoeba spp., Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Naegleria fowleri |year=2006 |last1=Qvarnstrom |first1=Y. |last2=Visvesvara |first2=G.

===Pathogenicity factors===
As no effective treatment for PAM has been found, the development of a therapeutic is an area of great research interest. Currently, much work is being done to determine what factor specific to ''N. fowleri'' makes it pathogenic and if these virulence factors can be targeted by drugs. One potential factor in motility of the "amoeba" is the protein coded by ''Nfa1''. When the ''Nfa1'' gene is expressed in nonpathogenic ''N. gruberi'' and the amoebae are cocultivated with target tissue cells, the protein was found to be located on the food cup which is responsible for ingestion of cells during feeding.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=115–20 |doi=10.1016/j.exppara.2005.10.004 |title=Naegleria fowleri: Functional expression of the Nfa1 protein in transfected Naegleria gruberi by promoter modification |year=2006 |last1=Song |first1=K |last2=Jeong |first2=S |last3=Park |first3=S |last4=Kim |first4=K |last5=Kwon |first5=M |last6=Im |first6=K |last7=Pak |first7=J |last8=Shin |first8=H |journal=Experimental Parasitology |volume=112 |issue=2 |pmid=16321386}}</ref>  Following up that research, ''Nfa1'' gene expression knockdown experiments were performed using [[RNA interference]].  In this experiment, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting the ''Nfa1'' sequence was introduced and subsequently expression levels of the gene product dramatically decreased.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=208–13 |doi=10.1016/j.exppara.2007.08.008 |title=Naegleria fowleri: nfa1 gene knock-down by double-stranded RNAs |year=2008 |last1=Jung |first1=S |last2=Kim |first2=J |last3=Lee |first3=Y |last4=Song |first4=K |last5=Kim |first5=K |last6=Park |first6=S |last7=Im |first7=K |last8=Shin |first8=H |journal=Experimental Parasitology |volume=118 |issue=2 |pmid=17904122}}</ref> This method could potentially be a technique applicable for knockdown of expression of pathogenicity factors in ''N. fowleri'' trophozoites.

=== Vaccine research ===
There is no licensed vaccine in the U.S. to protect against ''N. fowleri'' infection. However, because of the fatality of the ensuing meningoencephalitis, there are some efforts in vaccine research. Current research shows intranasal administration of [[Cry1Ac]] protoxin alone or in combination with amoebic [[lysates]] increases protection against Naegleria fowleri meningoencephalitis in mice.  Studies are ongoing investigating whether the [[STAT6]]-induced [[Th2]] immune response is essential for the resistance to N. fowleri infection, conferred by immunization with amoebic lysates plus Cry1Ac. Protected STAT6+/+-immunized mice elicited a Th-2 type inclined immune response that produced predominantly humoral immunity; unprotected STAT6-/- mice exhibited a polarized Th1-type cellular response. These findings suggest that the STAT6-signalling pathway is critical for defence against N. fowleri infection.
Immunization with [[Nfa1]] protein on experimental murine PAM because of N. fowleri, BALB/c mice were intra-peritoneally or intranasally immunized with a recombinant Nfa1 protein. The mean survival time of mice immunized intra-peritoneally with rNfa1 protein was prolonged compared with controls (25.0 and 15.5 days, respectively).
