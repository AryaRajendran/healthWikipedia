'''Vaginally administered estrogens''' are [[estrogen]]s that are delivered by [[intravaginal administration]], thereby exerting their effects mainly in the nearby tissue, with more limited [[systemic effect]]s compared to [[orally administered]] estrogens.<ref name=mayo2011>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR602127 Estrogen (Vaginal Route)] from Mayo Clinic / Thomson Healthcare Inc.

==For menopausal hormone replacement therapy==
When used for [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|menopausal hormone replacement therapy]], vaginally administered estrogens are intended to decrease the uncomfortable effects on the vagina, [[vulva]] and [[urethra]] that are caused by the decrease in estrogen production in the body after menopause, such as:
*[[Atrophic vaginitis]], with presentations such as dryness and soreness in the vagina and [[dyspareunia]] (pain during sexual intercourse)<ref name=mayo2011/>
*Itching, redness, or soreness of the vulva<ref name=mayo2011/>
*[[Urinary urgency]] (feeling an urge to urinate more often than is needed), or [[dysuria]] (experiencing pain while urinating)<ref name=mayo2011/>

===Examples===
*'''Vaginal tablets''', including '''Vagifem''' which contains [[estradiol]]<ref>[http://www.vagifem.com/ Vagifem - Manufacturer's website]</ref>
*'''Vaginal cream''', including [[Premarin]] which is a compound cream<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/Safety-RelatedDrugLabelingChanges/ucm121062.htm Premarin (conjugated estrogens) Vaginal Cream - Detailed View: Safety Labeling Changes Approved By FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) -- November 2008]</ref> consisting primarily of conjugated [[estrogen]]s isolated from [[horse|mare's]] [[urine]].
