A '''pelvic digit''', '''pelvic finger''', or '''pelvic rib''' is a rare [[congenital abnormality]] in humans, in which [[Osseous tissue|bone tissue]] develops in the [[soft tissue]] near the [[human pelvis|pelvis]], resembling a [[rib]] or [[finger]] and often divided into one or more segments with [[Articulation (anatomy)|pseudo-articulations]]. Pelvic digits are typically [[benign tumor|benign]] and asymptomatic, and are usually discovered accidentally. Approximately 41 cases have been reported.<ref name="breu">{{cite journal

</ref> Pelvic digits may be located at any level of the pelvis, the lower ribs, or even the anterior abdominal wall. It is theorized that pelvic digit anomalies arise during the [[mesenchymal]] stage of bone growth, within the first six weeks of [[embryogenesis]]. Their formation may result from a failure of the [[primordium]] of the [[coccyx]] to fuse to the [[vertebral column]], leading to the independent development of a proto-rib structure.<ref name="breu"/>
