[[File:Seldinger Set.jpg|thumb|A set of equipment to perform the Seldinger technique]]
The '''Seldinger technique''' is a [[medical procedure]] to obtain safe access to [[blood vessel]]s and other hollow [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s. It is [[eponym|named after]] Dr. [[Sven-Ivar Seldinger]] (1921-1998), a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[radiology|radiologist]] from [[Mora Municipality, Sweden|Mora]], [[Dalarna County]], who introduced the procedure in 1953.<ref name=Seldinger>{{cite journal |author=Seldinger SI |title=Catheter replacement of the needle in percutaneous arteriography; a new technique |journal=Acta radiologica |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=368–76 |year=1953 |pmid=13057644 |doi=10.3109/00016925309136722}}</ref>

==Description==
The desired vessel or cavity is punctured with a sharp hollow needle called a [[trocar]], with [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] guidance if necessary. A round-tipped guidewire is then advanced through the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the trocar, and the trocar is withdrawn. A "[[sheath]]" or blunt cannula can now be passed over the guidewire into the cavity or vessel. Alternatively, drainage tubes are passed over the guidewire (as in chest drains or [[nephrostomy|nephrostomies]]). After passing a sheath or tube, the guidewire is withdrawn.<ref name=Seldinger/>

A sheath can be used to introduce [[catheter]]s or other devices to perform endoluminal (inside the hollow organ) procedures, such as [[angioplasty]]. [[Fluoroscopy]] may be used to confirm the position of the catheter and to manoeuvre it to the desired location. Injection of [[radiocontrast]] may be used to visualize organs. Interventional procedures, such as [[catheter ablation|thermoablation]], angioplasty, embolisation or [[biopsy]], may be performed.

Upon completion of the desired procedure, the sheath is withdrawn. In certain settings, a sealing device may be used to close the hole made by the procedure.

==Uses==

The Seldinger technique is used for [[angiography]], insertion of [[chest drain]]s and [[central venous catheters]], insertion of [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy|PEG]] tubes using the push technique, insertion of the leads for an [[artificial pacemaker]] or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]], and numerous other interventional medical procedures.

==Complications==

The initial puncture is with a sharp instrument, and this may lead to [[hemorrhage]] or [[perforation]] of the organ in question. [[Infection]] is a possible complication, and hence [[asepsis]] is practiced during most Seldinger procedures.

Loss of the guidewire into the cavity or blood vessel is a significant and generally preventable complication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schummer W, Schummer C, Gaser E, Bartunek R |title=Loss of the guide wire: mishap or blunder? |journal=British journal of anaesthesia |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=144–6 |year=2002 |pmid=11881872 |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/88/1/144 |doi=10.1093/bja/88.1.144}}</ref>

==History and impact==

Prior to the description of the Seldinger technique, sharp trocars were used to create lumens through which devices could be passed. This had a high rate of complications.<ref name=Higgs>{{cite journal |author=Higgs ZC, Macafee DA, Braithwaite BD, Maxwell-Armstrong CA |title=The Seldinger technique: 50 years on |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9494 |pages=1407–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16226619 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66878-X}}</ref> However, with the introduction of the Seldinger technique, [[angiography]] became a relatively risk-free procedure, and the field of [[interventional radiology]] blossomed.

Building on the work of Seldinger, [[Charles Dotter]] and [[Andreas Gruentzig]] developed [[angioplasty]].
