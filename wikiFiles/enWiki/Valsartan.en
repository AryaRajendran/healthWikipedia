'''Valsartan''' (Angiotan or Diovan) is an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]] (more commonly called an "ARB", or angiotensin receptor blocker), with particularly high [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[Angiotensin II receptor type 1|type I (AT<sub>1</sub>) angiotensin receptor]]. By blocking the action of angiotensin, valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure.<ref name="Marks2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/valsartan/article.htm |title=Valsartan, Diovan |accessdate=2010-03-04 |author=Marks JW |date=2007-02-15 |publisher=MedicineNet }}</ref> In the U.S., valsartan is indicated for treatment of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF), or post-[[myocardial infarction]] (MI).<ref>{{cite web

Indeed, as a consequence of AT1 blockade, ARBs increase [[Angiotensin]] II levels several-fold above baseline by uncoupling a [[negative-feedback]] loop. Increased levels of circulating Angiotensin II result in unopposed stimulation of the AT2 receptors, which are, in addition upregulated. Unfortunately, recent data suggest that AT2 receptor stimulation may be less beneficial than previously proposed and may even be harmful under certain circumstances through mediation of growth promotion, fibrosis, and hypertrophy, as well as proatherogenic and proinflammatory effects.<ref name="AJH1">
