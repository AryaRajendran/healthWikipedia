'''Otto Fritz Meyerhof''' [[ForMemRS]]<ref name="frs"/> (April 12, 1884 – October 6, 1951) was a German-born [[physician]] and [[biochemist]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(51)91682-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1922/meyerhof-bio.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1922 |accessdate=2011-01-11 |quote=Otto Fritz Meyerhof was born on April 12, 1884, in Hannover. He was the son of Felix Meyerhof, a merchant of that city and his wife Bettina May. Soon after his birth his family moved to Berlin, where he went to the Wilhelms Gymnasium (classical secondary school). Leaving school at the age of 14, he was attacked, at the age of 16, by kidney trouble and had to spend a long time in bed. During this period of enforced inactivity he was much influenced by his mother's constant companionship. He read much, wrote poetry, and went through a period of much artistic and mental development. After he had matriculated, he studied medicine at Freiburg, Berlin, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. |publisher=[[Nobel Prize]] }}</ref>

==Biography==
Meyerhof was born in [[Hildesheim]],<ref name=con>"Conversation with daughter, Bettina Meyerhof"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alenasites.com/meyerhof/meyerhof.html |title=Otto Fritz Meyerhof |publisher=Alenasites.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-kiel.de/ps/cgi-bin/fo-bio.php?nid=meyerhof&lang=e |title=Uni Kiel – Otto Fritz Meyerhof |publisher=Uni-kiel.de |date=1951-10-06 |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref> the son of wealthy [[Jew]]ish parents. Because Hildesheim is a smaller city, about half an hour south of Hannover, a number of biographies mistakenly list his birthplace as Hannover. He spent most of his childhood in Berlin, where he started his study of [[medicine]]. He continued these studies in [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], from which he graduated in 1909, with a work titled "Contributions to the Psychological Theory of Mental Illness". In Heidelberg, he met Hedwig Schallenberg, who later became his wife. They had a daughter, Bettina Meyerhof and two sons, Gottfried (who referred to himself as Geoffrey) and Walter.<ref name=con/>

In 1912, he moved to the [[University of Kiel]], where he became professor in 1918. In 1922, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]], with [[Archibald Vivian Hill]], for his work on muscle metabolism, including [[glycolysis]].<ref>{{cite pmid|15665335}}</ref> In 1929 he became one of the directors of the [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research]], a position he held until 1938.  Fleeing the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime, he moved to Paris in 1938.<ref>Jean-Marc Chouraqui, Gilles Dorival, Colette Zytnicki, ''Enjeux d'Histoire, Jeux de Mémoire: les Usages du Passé Juif'', Maisonneuve & Larose, 2006, p. 548 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NJ25I02Q9OUC&pg=PA548&dq=%22Fritz+Brugel%22&lr=]</ref> He then moved to the United States in 1940, where he became a guest professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia.<ref name=con/>
