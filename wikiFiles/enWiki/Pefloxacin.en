'''Pefloxacin''' is a synthetic chemotherapeutic agent used to treat severe and life-threatening bacterial infections. Pefloxacin is commonly referred to as a [[fluoroquinolone]] (or [[quinolone]]) drug and is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterials. It is an analog of [[norfloxacin]]. It is a synthetic fluoroquinolone, belonging to the 3rd generation of quinolones.  Pefloxacin is extensively prescribed in France.<ref>	New Milestones Achieved in Fluoroquinolone Safety
Glenn S. Tillotson, M.Sc., FRSM, Public Health Research Institute, New York University, New York, New York; and Michael J. Rybak, Pharm.D., FCCP, Department of Pharmacy Services, The Anti-Infective Research Laboratory, and Detroit Receiving Hospital, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan
http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/409689</ref>  Pefloxacin has not been approved for use in the United States. 

There are no licensed uses for Pefloxacin in the United States, as the FDA has not approved this drug.  The licensed use varies in other countries and is quite limited as Pefloxacin is to be considered a drug of last resort when all other antibiotics have failed. There appears to be eight common uses in the adult population and no approved uses in the pediatric population, as well as a variety of veterinary uses (as documented within the package inserts). Pefloxacin interacts with a number of other drugs, a number of herbal and natural supplements, and certain thyroid medications.

==History==

Pefloxacin was developed in 1979 (German Patent Roger Bellon/Dainippon). It was approved in France for human use in 1985.<ref>	http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2008/2413.html</ref>

==Licensed uses==

Oral and I.V. fluoroquinolones are not licensed for use in children due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system. At least ten cases of [[arthropathy]] occurred in pediatric patients receiving fluoroquinolones; seven of these cases involved pefloxacin.<ref name=Burkhardt97>{{cite journal |author=Burkhardt JE, Walterspiel JN, Schaad UB |title=Quinolone arthropathy in animals versus children |journal=Clin.

However, the fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK. Prescribing a fluoroquinolone to treat an unapproved use within the pediatric (as well as the adult population) exposes the treating physician to the risk of being sued for malpractice should the treating physician fail to both warn the patient of this fact, as well as the risks of any adverse drug reactions the patient may experience.<ref>{{cite book |author=Loren G.

==Mode of action==

Pefloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that is active against both
[[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.  It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase IV,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |date=1 September 1997|pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187 }}</ref> which is an enzyme necessary to separate, replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.

*Mechanism of action:
The bactericidal action of pefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited.<ref name=Package112>http://www.oubari.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=My_eGallery&file=index&do=showpic&pid=112</ref>

The fluoroquinolones interfere with DNA replication by inhibiting an enzyme complex called DNA gyrase. This can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some congeners of this drug family display high activity not only against bacterial topoisomerases, but also against eukaryotic topoisomerases and are toxic to cultured mammalian cells and in vivo tumor models. Although the quinolone is highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture, its mechanism of cytotoxic action is not known. Quinolone induced DNA damage was first reported in 1986 (Hussy et al.) <ref>{{cite journal |author=Hussy P, Maass G, Tümmler B, Grosse F, Schomburg U |title=Effect of 4-quinolones and novobiocin on calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha primase complex, topoisomerases I and II, and growth of mammalian lymphoblasts |journal=Antimicrob.

==Contraindications==

*Hypersensitivity (allergy) to pefloxacin or to one of its components or to another member of the quinolones.

*Known deficiency in glucose-6 phosphate dehydogenase (a blood red cells enzyme).

*Due to growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance to the fluoroquinolones in Southeast Asia, the use of pefloxacin in patients who have been to Southeast Asia is increasingly being contraindicated.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Fluoroquinolone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae—Colorado and Washington, 1995 |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=44 |issue=41 |pages=761–4 |year=1995 |month=October |pmid=7565558 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00039305.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>

*Pefloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population (due to the risk of arthropathies), pregnancy, nursing mothers, and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders.

*Precautions:

:Coadministration of Pefloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by [[CYP1A2]] results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the coadministered drug.

:Patients should be warned to avoid exposure to direct sunlight or UV light during treatment and until 36 hours after the discontinuation of treatment, because of the risk of phototoxicity reactions (allergic skin rashes).

:Tendinitis (inflammation of tendon) may occur and can lead to tendon rupture, particularly in the Achilles tendon and more frequently in elderly patients.  Age, past history of tendinitis, vigorous physical exercise and long-term corticoid treatment may predispose a patient to tendinitis and tendon rupture. Therefore, as soon as the treatment with pefloxacin is initiated, it is recommended to look for pain or edema at the level of Achilles tendon, particularly in patients at risk. If such signs are identified therapy should be discontinued immediately.

:In patients with a past history of convulsions or with risk factors of convulsions pefloxacin should be used with caution.

:In case of myasthenia pefloxacin should be used with caution in these patients.

*Pregnancy
The fluoroquinolones rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and are extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. For this reason the Fluroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The Flouroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother’s milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering from this syndrome as well, even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shin HC, Kim JC, Chung MK, ''et al.'' |title=Fetal and maternal tissue distribution of the new fluoroquinolone DW-116 in pregnant rats |journal=Comp.

*Pediatric population
Fluoroquinolones are not licensed for use in children due to the risk of fatalities<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karande SC, Kshirsagar NA |title=Adverse drug reaction monitoring of ciprofloxacin in pediatric practice |journal=Indian Pediatr |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=181–8 |year=1992 |month=February |pmid=1592498 }}</ref>  as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. Ciprofloxacin is being licensed in the United States for the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli and Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure) and Levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure). However, the Fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK.

Pefloxacin is well known to be associated with high incidence of arthropathy in humans because the drug affects articular cartilage and the epiphyseal growth plate. The importance of this toxicity is that it is irreversible and manifest later after the drug is discontinued.<ref>Flouroquinolones - A Review

Some groups refer to these adverse events as "fluoroquinolone toxicity". These groups of people claim to have suffered serious long-term harm to their health from using fluoroquinolones.

==Interactions==

Pefloxacin absorption is influenced by antacid containing aluminium or magnesium hydroxide.
Fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, and to a lesser extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline and caffeine.<ref name=Janknegt90/>

===Significant drug interactions===
	
Given concomitantly, Pefloxacin with theophylline may increase theophylline plasma concentrations. It is recommended to monitor theophylline plasma levels, if necessary, the dose of theophylline should be reduced.<ref name=mimsw/>

Cimetidine reduces the metabolic clearance of pefloxacin.
<ref name=Janknegt90>{{cite journal |author=Janknegt R |title=Drug interactions with quinolones |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=26 Suppl D |issue= |pages=7–29 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2286594 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2286594}}</ref>

==Overdose==

In the event of acute overdosage, the patient should be kept under close medical supervision and given supportive treatment. Hemodialysis is not effective.

==Pharmacology==

*Chemical name:
1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid
Formula:
C17H20FN3O3
Pharmacology:
Pefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Flouroquinolones such as pefloxacin possess excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E.coli and Neisseria gonorrhoea as well as gram-positive bacteria including S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. They also possess effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.
Half life:
8.6 hours  Unchanged pefloxacin and its metabolites may be identified in the urine 84 hours after the intake of the product.  In elderly, in comparison with younger patients, the plasma clearance and the apparent volume of distribution are decreased approximately by 50%<ref name=Package112/>

*Elimination half life is 11–12 hours mainly through metabolites
*Pefloxacin is metabolized in the liver (85%-90%)
*Major route of elimination is renal – 9-16% of the drugs is eliminated unchanged.  Limited excretion via bile
*Major metabolites constitute up to 84% of drugs recovered in urine

==Pharmacokinetics==

*Biotransformation:
Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) 
Hepatic metabolism is considerable. The main metabolites are demethylated pefloxacin, norfloxacin and pefloxacin N-oxide.<ref name=Package112/>
*There are marked changes in pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment.  Careful monitoring of plasma levels together with appropriate dosage adjustment will be necessary.

==Dosing==
Pefloxacin should ''only'' be administered as described within the Dosage Guidelines table found within the most current package insert. The status of the patient’s renal function and hepatic function must also be taken into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose. Pefloxacin is eliminated partially through renal excretion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frydman AM, Le Roux Y, Lefebvre MA, Djebbar F, Fourtillan JB, Gaillot J |title=Pharmacokinetics of pefloxacin after repeated intravenous and oral administration (400 mg bid) in young healthy volunteers |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=17 |issue=Suppl B |pages=65–79 |year=1986 |month=April |pmid=3458699 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3458699}}</ref>
However, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver and the intestine. Modification of the dosage is recommended using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function. (Particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction.) However, since the drug is known to be partially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. 

Recommended Dosage:
400&nbsp;mg p.o. BID or QD
Injectable; Injection; Pefloxacin Mesylate Dihydrate 400&nbsp;mg / 5 ml Tablet, Film-Coated; Oral; Pefloxacin Mesylate Dihydrate 400&nbsp;mg
Oral Tablets: 400&nbsp;mg Twice daily
Injection: Administer by slow I.V. at a dosage of 400&nbsp;mg diluted in 100 or 250 ml of 5% isotonic solution (Over a period of 1 hr) Twice daily.<ref>http://www.mims.co.id/Page.aspx?menuid=mng&name=pefloxacin&h=pefloxacin</ref>

==Current litigation==
There are a significant number of cases currently pending before the United States District Court, District of Minnesota, involving one of the drugs found within the fluoroquinolone class; Levaquin (levofloxacin). On June 13, 2008 a Judicial Panel On Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) granted the Plaintiffs’ motion to centralize individual and class action lawsuits involving Levaquin in the District of Minnesota over objection of defendants, Johnson and Johnson / Ortho McNeil.<ref name="mnd.uscourts.gov"/>
As a result of this order, product liability attorneys are currently aggressively seeking additional plaintiffs who may have been damaged by this class.  Several class action lawsuits had been filed in regards to the adverse reactions suffered by those exposed to ciprofloxacin, another fluoroquinolone drug, during the Anthrax scare of 2001<ref>http://www.sheller.com/NewsDetails.asp?NewsID=72</ref><ref>http://www.lunewsviews.com/legal_briefs_archives.htm#cipro</ref> as well as most recently, a class action lawsuit involving a third fluoroquinolone; Tequin (gatifloxacin).<ref>http://injury.findlaw.com/tequin/tequin-news.html</ref> Currently there does not appear to be any class action lawsuits pending that involve pefloxacin, but there are a significant number of law firms aggressively seeking to represent patients who have suffered a spontaneous tendon rupture, or liver injury, following fluoroquinolone therapy.

==Regulatory history==
Pefloxacin has not been approved for use in the United States, hence there is no FDA regulator history to refer to.  However pefloxacin is categorized under the following by the FDA: Anti-Infectives; ATC:J01MA03.  In 2008 the FDA mandated a Black Box Warning be added to all fluoroquinolone drugs in reference to the potential for severe adverse reactions resulting in spontaneous tendon ruptures.

In 2008 the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau, Ministry of Health Malaysia required the addition of stronger warnings concerning the tendon issues. The DCA had decided that all drugs found within the fluoroquinolone class ''must'' have the following statement in the section “Special Warnings and Precautions for Use” of the package inserts:

Musculo-skeletal system:
“''The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendonitis and tendon rupture is further increased in people older than 60, in those taking corticosteroid drugs, and in kidney, heart, and lung transplant
recipients. Patients experiencing pain, swelling, inflammation of a tendon or tendon rupture should be advised to stop taking their fluoroquinolone medication (to specify the active ingredient) and to contact their healthcare professional promptly about changing their antimicrobial therapy. Patients should also avoid exercise and using the affected area at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation''”<ref>http://www.cornerstone-msc.net/bpfk/aeimages//File/ADR_newsletter/200812.pdf  See page 6 of this newsletter</ref>

===History of the Black Box Warnings===

By August 1996, the FDA had not taken action, and the consumer advocacy group [[Public Citizen]] filed a petition with the FDA prompting the agency to act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Petition to Require a Warning on All Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics (HRG Publication #1399) |date=August 1, 1996 |publisher=[[Public Citizen]] |url=http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=6595}} Retrieved on December 27, 2008.</ref> Two months later, the FDA published an alert in the ''FDA Medical Bulletin'' and requested that fluoroquinolone package inserts be amended to include information on this risk.<ref>{{cite journal

Review of the FDA website indicates that the generic versions of the fluoroquinolones have ''not'' been updated to include this Black Box Warning as of April 2009. And there are numerous reports that this information has not been dessiminated to the pharmacist, the products continue to contain the previous labels that are absent of this warning, and the Medication Guide has not been made available to the pharmicist or physician for distribution.

==Antibiotic misuse and bacterial resistance==
{{See also|Antibiotic misuse|Antibiotic resistance}}
[[antibiotic resistance|Resistance]] to pefloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous [[pathogen]]s, including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[enterococci]], and ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' now exhibit resistance worldwide.<ref>M Jacobs, Worldwide Overview of Antimicrobial Resistance. International Symposium on Antimicrobial Agents and Resistance 2005.</ref> Widespread veterinary usage of the fluoroquinolones, in particular over in Europe, has been implicated.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/cvm/CVM_Updates/71696update.html</ref>
The ever increasing bacterial resistance to pefloxacin, (which is a major concern) together with an unacceptable safety profile, may very well threaten its future viability to treat serious and life threatening bacterial infections.  Years ago the FDA had added warnings regarding the proper use of the fluoroquinolones drugs within the package inserts to combat such scripting abuse.  Advising physicians that fluoroquinolones: "''...should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria...''"(See the monographs for this class)

Normally pefloxacin should ''only'' be used in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy. Reserved for the use in patients who are seriously ill and may soon require immediate hospitalization.<ref>Jim Hoover, for Bayer Corporation, Alaska Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee March 19, 2004</ref> Though considered to be a very important and necessary drug required to treat severe and life threatening bacterial infections, the associated scripting abuse of pefloxacin remains unchecked, which has contributed to the problem of bacterial resistance. The [[overuse of antibiotic]]s such as happens with children suffering from otitis media has given rise to a breed of super bacteria which are resistant to antibiotics entirely.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Froom J, Culpepper L, Jacobs M, ''et al.'' |title=Antimicrobials for acute otitis media?

For example the use of the fuoroquinolones had increased threefold in an emergency room environment in the United States between 1995 and 2002, while the use of safer alternatives such as macrolides declined significantly.<ref name=MacDougall05>{{cite journal |author=MacDougall C, Guglielmo BJ, Maselli J, Gonzales R |title=Antimicrobial drug prescribing for pneumonia in ambulatory care |journal=Emerging Infect.

Within a recent study concerning the proper use of this class in the emergency room it was revealed that 99% of these prescriptions were in error.  Out of the one hundred total patients studied, eighty one received a fluoroquinolone for an inappropriate indication. Out of these cases, forty three (53%) were judged to be inappropriate because another agent was considered first line, twenty seven (33%) because there was no evidence of a bacterial infection to begin with (based on the documented evaluation), and eleven (14%) because of the need for such therapy was questionable. Out of the nineteen patients who received a fluoroquinolone for an appropriate indication, only ''one patient'' out of one hundred received both the correct dose and duration of therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lautenbach E, Larosa LA, Kasbekar N, Peng HP, Maniglia RJ, Fishman NO |title=Fluoroquinolone utilization in the emergency departments of academic medical centers: prevalence of, and risk factors for, inappropriate use |journal=Arch.

Fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the regulatory agencies, such as acute bronchitis, otitis media, and acute upper respiratory tract infection, according to a study that was supported in part by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.<ref name=Linder05/><ref>K08 HS14563 and HS11313</ref>  Additionally they are commonly prescribed for medical conditions that are not even bacterial to begin, with such as viral infections, or those to which no proven benefit exist.

There are three known mechanisms of resistance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC |title=The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=629–40 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17008172 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473-3099(06)70599-0}}</ref>  Some types of [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] pumps can act to decrease intracellular quinolone concentration.  In gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to [[DNA gyrase]], protecting it from the action of quinolones.  Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[Topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.

==Social and economic impact==

Any number of adverse drug reaction forums related to pefloxacin, as well as the fluoroquinolone class, may be found on the Internet. The various manufacturers and the members of the medical community’s reaction to these forums have been one of disbelief and denial. Claiming that “Some of the personal stories {of these members} on the Internet are truly wacky...” <ref>http://www.em-news.com/pt/re/emmednews/pdfhandler.00132981-200810000-00023.pdf;jsessionid=JNJGnJrSnxkP9r3mcySnGQJGZ5qDNRJv18N8bJvkhJ41877mWQM2!1321082991!181195629!8091!-1</ref> 
 
Increased hospitalizations attributed to adverse drug reactions alone account for billions of dollars each year within the US healthcare system. Severe reactions do occur with the fluoroquinolone class and can add significantly to the cost of care. Antibacterial adverse effects account for nearly 25% of all adverse drug reactions amongst hospitalized patients. “Indirect costs as a result of reduced quality of life or loss of productivity are certainly not reflected in the acquisition costs of antimicrobials.”<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beringer PM, Wong-Beringer A, Rho JP |title=Economic aspects of antibacterial adverse effects |journal=PharmacoEconomics |volume=13 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=35–49 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=10175984 |doi=10.2165/00019053-199813010-00004 }}</ref>

*Economic impact: adverse reactions:

The adverse drug reaction profile of levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone drugs has spawned a grass root movement of those so affected to lobby for Black Box Warnings and Dear Doctor Letters as well as the petitioning of the FDA for the removal of some fluoroquinolone drugs from clinical practice.<ref>In The United States District Court

These companies manufacture and distribute fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the United States in a manner that fails to warn of serious adverse event risks, and downplays and fails to warn physicians of the serious risks associated with fluoroquinolone therapy.</ref>

A number of class action lawsuits as well as malpractice litigation has been spawned by this unacceptable safety profile. The various manufacturers have countered these allegations stating that they believe that these drugs are both safe and effective antibiotics, well tolerated with a minimum of side effects, such reactions are “rare” (contrary to the literature) and the benefits of such therapy outweigh the perceived risks.
