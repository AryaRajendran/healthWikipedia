'''Neurology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|νεῦρον}}, ''neuron'', "nerve" + the suffix
{{lang|grc|-λογία}}, '[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]', "study of") is a [[medical specialty]] dealing with [[neurological disorder|disorders of the nervous system]]. To be specific, neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of disease involving the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] nervous system; or equivalently, the [[autonomic nervous system]]s and the [[somatic nervous system]]s, including their coverings, blood vessels, and all effector tissue, such as muscle.<ref>[http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/downloads/RRC_progReq/180neurology07012007.pdf Acgme.org]</ref>  

A [[neurologist]] is a [[physician]] specializing in neurology and trained to investigate, or diagnose and treat neurological disorders.<ref name=WorkWYourDoc>{{cite web|title=Working with Your Doctor|url=http://patients.aan.com/go/workingwithyourdoctor|publisher=American Academy of Neurology|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> Neurologists may also be involved in [[clinical research]], and [[clinical trials]], as well as [[basic research]] and [[translational research]]. While neurology is a non-surgical specialty, its corresponding [[surgical]] specialty is [[neurosurgery]].<ref name=WorkWYourDoc /> Neurology, being a branch of medicine, differs from [[neuroscience]], which is the scientific study of the nervous system in all its aspects.

==Field of work==
A [[List of neurological disorders|large number]] of [[neurological disorders]] have been described. These can affect the [[central nervous system]] ([[Human brain|brain]] and [[spinal cord]]), the [[peripheral nervous system]], or the [[autonomic nervous system]].

==Qualifications==
[[File:Charcot1893.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jean-Martin Charcot]] is considered one of the fathers of neurology.<ref>"[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3064755/ Jean-Martin Charcot: The Father of Neurology]". [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]].</ref>]]
In the United States and Canada, [[neurologists]] are [[physicians]] who have completed postgraduate training in neurology after graduation from [[medical school]]. Neurologists complete, on average, at least 10–13 years of college education and clinical training. This training includes obtaining a four-year undergraduate degree, a medical degree ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] or [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]), which comprises an additional four years of study, and then completing a three or four-year residency in neurology. The four-year residency consists of one year of [[internal medicine]] training followed by three years of training in neurology.  Some neurologists complete a one or two-year fellowship after completing a neurology residency.  Sub-specialties include: brain injury medicine, clinical neurophysiology, [[epilepsy]], [[hospice and palliative medicine]], neurodevelopmental disabilities, [[neuromuscular medicine]], [[pain medicine]] and [[sleep medicine]], and vascular medicine.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABMS Guide to Medical Specialties|url=http://www.abmsdirectory.com/pdf/Resources_guide_physicians.pdf|publisher=American Board of Medical Specialties.|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> 

Many neurologists also have additional subspecialty training (fellowships) after completing their residency in one area of neurology such as stroke or vascular neurology, [[interventional neurology]], epilepsy, neuromuscular, neurorehabilitation, behavioral neurology, [[sleep medicine]], pain management, neuroimmunology, clinical neurophysiology, or movement disorders.

In Germany, a compulsory year of psychiatry must be done to complete a residency of neurology.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, neurology is a subspecialty of general (internal) medicine. After five to nine years of medical school and a year as a pre-registration house officer (or two years on the Foundation Programme), a neurologist must pass the examination for [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]] (or the Irish equivalent) before completing two years of core medical training and then entering specialist training in neurology. A generation ago, some neurologists would have also spent a couple of years working in psychiatric units and obtain a Diploma in Psychological Medicine.  However, this requirement has become uncommon, and, now that a basic psychiatric qualification takes three years to obtain, the requirement is no longer practical. A period of research is essential, and obtaining a higher degree aids career progression: Many found it was eased after an attachment to the Institute of Neurology at Queen Square in London. Some neurologists enter the field of rehabilitation medicine (known as [[physiatry]] in the US) to specialise in neurological rehabilitation, which may include stroke medicine as well as brain injuries.

==Physical examination==
During a neurological examination, the neurologist reviews the patient's health history with special attention to the current condition. The patient then takes a neurological exam. Typically, the exam tests mental status, function of the [[cranial nerves]] (including vision), strength, coordination, reflexes, and sensation. This information helps the neurologist determine whether the problem exists in the nervous system and the clinical localization. Localization of the pathology is the key process by which neurologists develop their differential diagnosis. Further tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis and ultimately guide therapy and appropriate management.

==Clinical tasks==
===General caseload===
Neurologists are responsible for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of all the conditions mentioned above. When surgical intervention is required, the neurologist may refer the patient to a [[neurosurgeon]]. In some countries, additional legal responsibilities of a neurologist may include making a finding of [[brain death]] when it is suspected that a [[patient]] is [[deceased]]. Neurologists frequently care for people with hereditary ([[gene]]tic) diseases when the major manifestations are neurological, as is frequently the case. [[Lumbar puncture]]s are frequently performed by [[neurologists]]. Some neurologists may develop an interest in particular subfields, such as [[dementia]], [[movement disorders]], [[headache]]s, [[epilepsy]], [[sleep disorders]], chronic [[pain]] management, [[multiple sclerosis]], or [[neuromuscular]] diseases.

===Overlapping areas===
There is some overlap with other specialties, varying from country to country and even within a local geographic area. Acute [[traumatic brain injury|head trauma]] is most often treated by [[neurosurgeon]]s, whereas [[sequelae]] of head trauma may be treated by neurologists or [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|specialists in rehabilitation medicine]]. Although stroke cases have been traditionally managed by internal medicine or hospitalists, the emergence of vascular neurology and [[interventional neurology|interventional neurologists]] has created a demand for stroke specialists. The establishment of [[JCAHO]] certified stroke centers has increased the role of neurologists in stroke care in many primary as well as tertiary hospitals.   Some cases of nervous system [[infectious disease]]s are treated by infectious disease specialists. Most cases of [[headache]] are diagnosed and treated primarily by [[general practitioner]]s, at least the less severe cases. Likewise, most cases of [[sciatica]] and other mechanical radiculopathies are treated by general practitioners, though they may be referred to neurologists or a surgeon (neurosurgeons or [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeons]]). [[Sleep disorders]] are also treated by [[Pulmonology|pulmonologists]] and [[psychiatrists]]. [[Cerebral palsy]] is initially treated by [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]], but care may be transferred to an adult neurologist after the patient reaches a certain age. In the United Kingdom and other countries, many of the conditions encountered by older patients such as movement disorders including Parkinson's Disease, stroke, dementia or gait disorders are managed predominantly by specialists in [[geriatric medicine]].

[[Clinical neuropsychology|Clinical neuropsychologists]] are often called upon to [[Neuropsychological assessment|evaluate]] [[Human brain|brain]]-[[Human behavior|behavior]] relationships for the purpose of assisting with [[differential diagnosis]], planning [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] strategies, documenting [[cognitive]] strengths and weaknesses, and measuring change over time (e.g., for identifying abnormal [[aging]] or tracking the progression of a [[dementia]]).

===Relationship to clinical neurophysiology===
In some countries, e.g. USA and Germany, [[neurologists]] may specialize in [[clinical neurophysiology]], the field responsible for [[electroencephalography|EEG]], [[nerve conduction study|nerve conduction studies]], [[electromyography|EMG]] and [[evoked potentials]]. In other countries, this is an [[autonomous]] [[specialty]] (e.g., United Kingdom, Sweden).

===Overlap with psychiatry===
{{Further|Psychoneuroimmunology|Neuropsychiatry}}

Although [[mental illness]]es are believed by some to be neurological disorders affecting the [[central nervous system]], traditionally they are classified separately, and treated by [[psychiatrists]]. In a 2002 review article in the [[American Journal of Psychiatry]], Professor Joseph B. Martin, Dean of [[Harvard Medical School]] and a neurologist by training, wrote that "the separation of the two categories is arbitrary, often influenced by beliefs rather than proven scientific observations. And the fact that the brain and mind are one makes the separation artificial anyway".<ref name="pmid11986119">{{cite journal

[[Neurological]] [[diseases]] often have [[psychiatric]] manifestations, such as post-[[stroke]] [[clinical depression|depression]], depression and [[dementia]] associated with [[Parkinson's disease]], mood and cognitive dysfunctions in [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Huntington disease]], to name a few. Hence, there is not always a sharp distinction between neurology and [[psychiatry]] on a biological basis. The dominance of [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory]] in the first three quarters of the 20th century has since then been largely replaced by a focus on pharmacology. Despite the shift to a [[medical]] [[Conceptual model|model]], brain science has not advanced to the point where [[scientists]] or [[clinicians]] can point to readily discernible pathologic lesions or genetic abnormalities that in and of themselves serve as reliable or predictive biomarkers of a given mental disorder.

==Cosmetic neurology==
The emerging field of cosmetic neurology highlights the potential of therapies to improve such things as workplace efficacy, attention in school, and overall happiness in personal lives.<ref>Hamilton, Roy. Looking at things in a different perspective created the idea of ethics of neural enhancement using noninvasive brain stimulation. Neurology January 10, 2011 vol. 76 no. 2 187-193. {{doi|10.1212/WNL.0b013e318205d50d}}</ref> However, this field has also given rise to questions about [[neuroethics]] and the [[psychopharmacology]] of [[lifestyle drugs]].
