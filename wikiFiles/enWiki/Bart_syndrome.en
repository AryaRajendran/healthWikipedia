'''Bart syndrome''' is a [[genetic disorder]] characterized by the association of congenital localized absence of [[skin]], [[epidermolysis bullosa]], lesions of the mouth [[mucosa]], and [[onychodystrophy|dystrophic nails]].<ref name="Bart syndrome">

==Genetics==
The disease is inherited by [[autosomal dominant]] transmission with complete [[penetrance]] but variable [[Expressivity|expression]]. This means that children of an affected parent that carries the gene have a 50% chance of developing the disorder, although the extent to which they are affected is variable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Bart syndrome is caused by [[ultrastructural]] abnormalities in the [[anchoring fibrils]]. Genetic linkage of the inheritance of the disease points to the region of [[chromosome 3]] near the [[collagen, type VII, alpha 1]] gene ([[COL7A1]]).<ref name="Genetics of Bart syndrome">
