Azar, wrote, "She was for most of us the first and only woman-teacher or woman-in-authority we knew until then, and she was dazzlingly brilliant. Ours seemed, on the surface, a male-dominated world. . . she undoubtedly was a pioneer in a daring and noble form of feminism."<ref name=Azar>{{cite journal|last=Azar|first=Henry, A.|title=Edith E.
