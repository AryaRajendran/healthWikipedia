{{Distinguish|Royal Society of Medicine}}

The '''Royal Medical Society''' ('''RMS''') is the oldest medical society in the [[United Kingdom]] (although this claim is also made by the earlier London-based [[Society of Apothecaries]] (1617) which is permitted to award medical degrees).{{fact|date=June 2011}} Known originally as 'the Medical Society' when it was established in 1737, it was granted a Royal Charter in 1778. The RMS is a [[professional society]] engaged in the advancement of [[medical]] knowledge and provision of assistance to medical students and professionals. It is based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], and has members throughout the world.

It is not to be confused with the younger [[Royal Society of Medicine]] of [[London]].

==The society today==
Although [[cadaver]]s are no longer kept, the Society still encourages medical learning.  The RMS hosts talks for students from physicians and surgeons from all fields each Tuesday.  This year Neurology, Cardiovascular medicine and a series of talks covering Emergency medicine are just a few of the topics that will be presented to the Society.  After each lecture, members hold a private business meeting and is an opportunity for students to present their research to their peers.

Also on offer are practical tutorials (plastering, venepuncture) and the student-led exam tutorials at the end of semesters.

There are also many other events throughout the year: Freshers’ Week events (including the infamous White Coat Pub Crawl); Hallowe’en parties; a Burns Supper and the Presidents' Annual Dinner — this year{{when|date=June 2011}} taking place in the Playfair Library in the University’s Old College.
