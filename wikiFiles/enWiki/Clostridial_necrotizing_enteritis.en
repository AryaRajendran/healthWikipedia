'''Clostridial necrotizing enteritis''' (CNE)  --  also called '''enteritis necroticans''' and '''pigbel'''  --   is an often fatal type of [[food poisoning]] caused by a [[β-toxin]] of ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'',<ref name="urlClostridial Necrotizing Enteritis: Anaerobic Bacteria: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec14/ch178/ch178f.html |title=Clostridial Necrotizing Enteritis: Anaerobic Bacteria: Merck Manual Professional |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> Type C.  It occurs in some [[developing countries]], but was also documented in [[Germany]] following [[World War II]]. The toxin is normally inactivated by certain [[proteolytic enzyme]]s and by normal cooking, but when these protections are impeded, the disease emerges.

==Etiology==
All the factors collectively causing CNE are generally only present in the hinterlands of [[New Guinea]] and parts of [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], and [[Asia]]. These factors include [[Malnutrition|protein deprivation]] (causing inadequate synthesis of trypsin protease (an enzyme), to which the toxin is very sensitive), poor food hygiene, episodic meat feasting, staple diets containing [[trypsin]] inhibitors ([[sweet potatoes]]), and infection by ''[[Ascaris]]'' parasites which secrete a trypsin inhibitor. In New Guinea (origin of the term “pigbel”), the disease is usually spread through contaminated meat (especially pork) and perhaps by peanuts. (CNE was also diagnosed in post WWII Germany, where it was known as ''Darmbrand'' or "fire bowels").

==Clinical aspects==
CNE is a necrotizing inflammation of the small bowel (especially the jejunum but also the ileum). Clinical results may vary from mild diarrhea to a life-threatening sequence of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody stool, ulceration of the small intestine with leakage (perforation) into the [[peritoneal cavity]] and possible death within a single day due to [[peritonitis]]. Many patients exhibit [[meteorism]]. Treatment involves suppressing the toxin-producing organisms with antibiotics such as [[penicillin G]] or [[metronidazole]]. About half of seriously ill patients require surgery for perforation, persistent intestinal obstruction, or failure to respond to the antibiotics. An investigational toxoid vaccine has been used successfully in some developing countries but is not available outside of research.

==Other Clostridial toxemias==
*[[Leukemia]] patients, cancer [[chemotherapy]] recipients and others suffering from suppressed [[white blood cells]] ([[neutropenia]]) can be afflicted by a similar syndrome, [[neutropenic enterocolitis]], in which the [[cecum]] is targeted by ''[[Clostridium septicum]]'' in much the same way. 

*In neonatal [[intensive-care unit]]s, the syndrome of  [[neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis]] may be caused in a similar way by ''[[Clostridium perfringens|C. perfringens]]'', ''[[Clostridium butyricum|C. butyricum]]'', and ''[[Clostridium difficile|C. difficile]]'', but this has not been proved.
