'''Fanconi syndrome''' (also known as '''Fanconi's syndrome''') is a disease of the [[proximal renal tubule]]s<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952604|Fanconi syndrome}}</ref> of the [[kidney]] in which [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, [[uric acid]], [[phosphate]] and [[bicarbonate]] are passed into the urine, instead of being reabsorbed. Fanconi syndrome affects the [[Nephron#Proximal_tubule|proximal tubule]], which is the first part of the tubule to process fluid after it is filtered through the glomerulus. It may be inherited, or caused by drugs or heavy metals.<ref>[http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/kidney_and_urinary_tract_disorders/tubular_and_cystic_kidney_disorders/fanconi_syndrome.html Fanconi Syndrome] at Merck Manual Home Health Handbook</ref>

Different forms of Fanconi syndrome can affect different functions of the proximal tubule, and result in different complications. The loss of [[bicarbonate]] results in type 2 or proximal [[renal tubular acidosis]].  The loss of phosphate results in the bone disease [[rickets]] (even with adequate vitamin D and calcium), because phosphate is necessary for bone development.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Magen D, Berger L, Coady MJ, ''et al.'' |title=A loss-of-function mutation in NaPi-IIa and renal Fanconi's syndrome |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=362 |issue=12 |pages=1102–9 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20335586 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0905647 }}</ref>

==Eponym==
It is named after [[Guido Fanconi]], a [[Swiss]] [[pediatrician]]; this may be a misnomer, since Fanconi himself never identified it as a syndrome; though, as in the case of [[Goodpasture's syndrome]], it is customary to name a syndrome after the first person to note a constellation of symptoms as occurring together.

It should not be confused with [[Fanconi anemia]], a separate disease.

==Clinical features==
{{Main|renal tubular acidosis}}
The clinical features of proximal renal tubular acidosis are:
* [[Polyuria]], [[polydipsia]] and [[dehydration]]
* Hypophosphatemic [[rickets]] (in children) and [[osteomalacia]] (in adults)
* [[Growth failure]]
* [[Acidosis]]
* [[Hypokalemia]]
* [[Hyperchloremia]]

Other features of the generalized proximal tubular dysfunction of the Fanconi syndrome are:
* [[Hypophosphatemia]]/[[phosphaturia]]
* [[Glycosuria]]
* [[Proteinuria]]/aminoaciduria
* [[Hyperuricosuria]]

==Causes==
In contrast to [[Hartnup disease]] and related tubular conditions, Fanconi syndrome affects the transport of many different substances, so is not considered to be a defect in a specific channel, but a more general defect in the function of the proximal tubules.<ref name="urlFanconi Syndrome: eMedicine Pediatrics: General Medicine">{{EMedicine|article|981774|Fanconi Syndrome}}</ref>

Different diseases underly Fanconi syndrome; they can be [[inheritance|inherited]], [[congenital]], or acquired.

===Inherited===
[[Cystinosis]] is the most common cause of Fanconi syndrome in children. 

Other recognised causes are [[Wilson's disease]] (a genetically inherited condition of copper metabolism), [[Lowe syndrome]], [[tyrosinemia]] (type I),<ref name="pmid19156444">{{cite journal |author=Cochat P |title=Nephrolithiasis related to inborn metabolic diseases |journal=Pediatr.

===Acquired===
It is possible to acquire this disease later in life.

Causes include ingesting expired [[tetracyclines]], and as a side effect of [[tenofovir]] in cases of pre-existing renal impairment.<ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of children with Fanconi syndrome mainly consists of replacement of substances lost in the [[urine]] (mainly fluid and bicarbonate).
