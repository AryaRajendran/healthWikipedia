'''Starvation''' is a severe deficiency in caloric [[food energy|energy]], [[nutrient]], and [[vitamin]] intake. It is the most extreme form of [[malnutrition]]. In humans, prolonged starvation can cause permanent [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] damage<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Ro8IaMhVvtAC&pg=PA115&dq=starvation+organ+failure&hl=en&ei=CeQ8TZLfII2WsgP988G0Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=starvation%20organ%20failure&f=false Disease-Related Malnutrition: An Evidence-Based Approach to Treatment] "When [food] intake is poor or absent for a long time (weeks), weight loss is associated with organ failure and death."</ref> and eventually, [[death]]. The term '''''inanition''''' refers to the symptoms and effects of starvation.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[hunger]] is the single gravest threat to the world's public health.<ref name=economist>[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10566634 Malnutrition] The Starvelings</ref> The [[WHO]] also states that malnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to [[child mortality]], present in half of all cases.<ref name=economist/> Undernutrition is a contributory factor in the death of 2.6 million children every year.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats | work=World Food Programme | title=Hunger Stats }}</ref> Figures on actual starvation are difficult to come by, but according to the [[FAO]], the less severe condition of undernourishment currently affects about 925 million people, or about 13.5% of the [[world population]].<ref>FAO: [http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/ The State of Food Insecurity in the World]</ref>

The bloated stomach, as seen in the picture to the right, represents a form of malnutrition called [[kwashiorkor]] which is caused by insufficient protein despite a sufficient caloric intake.<ref name="bettermedicine">http://www.bettermedicine.com/article/kwashiorkor</ref> Children are more vulnerable to kwashiorkor whose  advanced symptoms include  weight loss and [[muscle]] wasting.<ref name="bettermedicine" />

==Common causes==
[[File:Starved Vietnamese man, 1966.JPEG|thumb|upright|Starved [[Vietnam]]ese man, who was deprived of food in a [[Viet Cong]] prison camp.]]
The basic cause of starvation is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In other words, the body expends more energy than it takes in as something. This imbalance can arise from one or more medical conditions and/or circumstantial situations, which can include:

'''Medical reasons'''
*[[Anorexia nervosa]]
*[[Bulimia nervosa]]
*[[EDNOS]]
*[[Coeliac Disease]]
*[[Coma]]
*[[Major depressive disorder]]
*[[Diabetes mellitus]]
*[[Digestive disease]]
*Constant [[vomiting]]

'''Circumstantial causes'''

*[[Famine]]{{spaced ndash}}for any reason, such as political strife and war.
*[[Fasting]]{{spaced ndash}}done without proper medical supervision.
*[[Poverty]]
The main causes of starvation are as follows:
#The most common cause of starvation is the economy; poor people sometimes cannot buy enough foodstuffs and thereby fail to fulfill the caloric demands of the body.
#Starvation may be due to food scarcity in the society. This causes decreased supply of food to the whole of the population, and thus mass starvation may occur.
#Starvation may be due to diseases that can cause rapid weight loss either due to the nature of the disease or the inability of the person to either eat or eat enough due to symptoms including, but not limited to: fatigue, nausea, or vomiting. The person may also be the host to a parasite such as an intestinal worm which may take a significant amount of the calories ingested by its host. This effect is exacerbated if the human host is already ingesting far less food than is required to meet their daily caloric intake needs.
#There are some clinical conditions such as recovering from surgery or burns etc., in which the person may be too fatigued or incapacitated to eat enough during their period of convalescence.

==Signs and symptoms==
Individuals experiencing starvation lose substantial [[fat]] [[Adipose tissue|(adipose)]] and muscle mass as the body breaks down these tissues for energy. ''[[Catabolysis]]'' is the process of a body breaking down its own muscles and other tissues in order to keep vital systems such as the [[nervous system]] and heart muscle [[Cardiac muscle|(myocardium)]] functioning. [[Vitamin deficiency]] is a common result of starvation, often leading to [[anemia]], [[beriberi]], [[pellagra]], and [[scurvy]]. These diseases collectively can also cause [[diarrhea]], [[skin rashes]], [[edema]], and [[heart failure]]. Individuals are often irritable and lethargic as a result.

Early symptoms include impulsivity, irritability, hyperactivity, and other symptoms.  
[[Atrophy]] (wasting away) of the stomach weakens the perception of hunger, since the perception is controlled by the percentage of the stomach that is empty. Victims of starvation are often too weak to sense thirst, and therefore become [[dehydrated]].
[[File:Girl affected by famine in Buguruslan, Russia - 1921.jpg|thumb|180px|Starving Russian girl during the [[Russian famine of 1921]]]]
All movements become painful due to muscle atrophy and dry, cracked skin that is caused by severe dehydration. With a weakened body, diseases are commonplace. Fungi, for example, often grow under the [[esophagus]], making swallowing unbearably painful.

The energy deficiency inherent in starvation causes [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and renders the victim more [[apathetic]] over time. As the starving person becomes too weak to move or even eat, their interaction with the surrounding world diminishes.

There is also an inability to fight diseases, and in females, irregular menstruation can occur.

==Biochemistry==
When food intake ceases, the body enters the [[starvation response]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Initially, the body's [[glycogen]] stores are used up in about 24 hours.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The level of [[insulin]] in circulation is low and the level of [[glucagon]] is very high. The main means of energy production is [[lipolysis]]. [[Gluconeogenesis]] converts [[glycerol]] into glucose and the [[Cori cycle]] converts lactate into usable glucose.  Two systems of energy enter the gluconeogenesis: [[proteolysis]] provides [[alanine]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]] produced from [[pyruvate]], while acetyl CoA produces dissolved nutrients ([[Ketone bodies]]), which can be detected in [[urine]] and are used by the brain as a source of energy.

In terms of insulin resistance, starvation conditions make more glucose available to the brain.

==Efforts==

===Treatment===
Starving patients can be treated, but this must be done cautiously to avoid [[refeeding syndrome]].<ref name="pmid18583681">{{cite journal |author=Mehanna HM, Moledina J, Travis J |title=Refeeding syndrome: what it is, and how to prevent and treat it |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1495–8 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18583681 |pmc=2440847 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a301 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18583681}}</ref> Rest and warmth must be provided and maintained. Small sips of water mixed with [[glucose]] should be given in regular intervals. Fruit juices can also be given. Later, food can be given gradually in small quantities. The quantity of food can be increased over time. Proteins may be administered intravenously to raise the level of [[serum (blood)|serum]] proteins.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Physiology and Treatment of Starvation|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2181967/|publisher=US national library of medicine|accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>

===Prevention===

{{See also|Food security}}
For the individual, prevention consists of ensuring they eat plenty of food, varied enough to provide a nutritionally complete diet.  Short of sitting in front of a potentially starving person and offering him or her food, addressing societal mechanisms by which people are denied access to food is a more complicated matter.

Supporting [[farmer]]s in areas of food insecurity through such measures as free or subsidized [[fertilizer]]s and [[seed]]s increases food harvest and reduces food prices.<ref name=newyorktimes>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts]</ref>

===Organizations===
{{Main|Famine relief}}
Many organizations have been highly effective at reducing starvation in different regions. Aid agencies give direct assistance to individuals, while political organizations pressure political leaders to enact more macro-scale policies that will reduce famine and provide aid.

==Starvation statistics==
{{Main|Malnutrition|Hunger}}
According to estimates by the [[FAO]] there were 925 million under- or malnourished people in the world in 2010.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/ FAO:Hunger]</ref> This was a decrease from an estimate of 1023 million malnourished people in 2009.<ref name=state2010>[http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/ The State of Food Insecurity in the World, 2010: Addressing Food Insecurity in Protracted Crises]</ref> In 2007, 923 million people were reported as being undernourished, an increase of 80 million since 1990-92.<ref>[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] Economic and Social Development Department. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/011/i0291e/i0291e00.htm “The State of Food Insecurity in the World, 2008 : High food prices and food security - threats and opportunities”]. [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]], 2008, p. 2. “FAO’s most recent estimates put the number of hungry people at 923 million in 2007, an increase of more than 80 million since the 1990–92 base period.”.</ref> It has also been recorded that the world already produces enough food to support the world's population.

As the definitions of starving and malnourished people are different, the number of starving people is different from that of malnourished. Generally, far fewer people are starving, than are malnourished. The numbers here may provide some indication, but should not be quoted as a number of starving people.

The share of malnourished and of starving people in the world has been more or less continually decreasing for at least several centuries.<ref>Fogel, RW (2004). [http://www.google.com/books?hl=sv&lr=&id=qY-1Bto2yNcC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&ots=5GWawlnqZz&sig=Ek6p3ixTkZuPVACi2FCOBcAfZxE ''The escape from hunger and premature death, 1700-2100: Europe, America, and the Third World.''] Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> This is due to an increasing supply of [[food]] and to overall gains in [[economic efficiency]]. In 40 years, the share of malnourished people in the developing world has been more than halved. The share of starving people has decreased even faster.

Historically, starvation has been used as a [[death sentence]]. From the beginning of civilization to the [[Middle Ages]], people were [[immurement|immured]], or walled in, and would die for want of food.

In ancient Greco-Roman societies, starvation was sometimes used to dispose of guilty upper class citizens, especially erring female members of patrician families. For instance, in the year 31, [[Livilla]], the niece and daughter-in-law of [[Tiberius]], was discreetly starved to death by her mother for her adulterous relationship with [[Sejanus]] and for her complicity in the murder of her own husband, [[Drusus the Younger]].

Another daughter-in-law of Tiberius, named [[Agrippina the Elder]] (a granddaughter of [[Augustus]] and the mother of [[Caligula]]), also died of starvation, in 33 AD. (However, it is not clear whether or not her starvation was self-inflicted.)

A son and daughter of Agrippina were also executed by starvation for political reasons; [[Drusus Caesar]], her second son, was put in prison in 33 AD, and starved to death by orders of Tiberius (he managed to stay alive for nine days by chewing the stuffing of his bed); Agrippina's youngest daughter, [[Julia Livilla]], was exiled on an island in 41 by her uncle, Emperor [[Claudius]], and not much later, her death by starvation was arranged by the empress [[Messalina]].

It is also possible that [[Vestal Virgin]]s were starved when found guilty of breaking their vows of [[celibacy]].

[[Ugolino della Gherardesca]], his sons and other members of his family were immured in the [[Muda (tower)|Muda]], a tower of [[Pisa]], and starved to death in the thirteenth century. [[Dante]], his contemporary, wrote about Gherardesca in his masterpiece ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.

In [[Sweden]] in 1317, King [[Birger, King of Sweden|Birger of Sweden]] imprisoned his two brothers for a coup they had staged several years earlier ([[Nyköping Banquet]]). A few weeks later, they died of starvation.

In the [[England|English]] county of [[Cornwall]] in 1671, [[John Trehenban]] from [[St Columb Major]] was condemned to be starved to death in a cage at [[Castle An Dinas]] for the murder of two girls.

Saint [[Maximilian Kolbe]], a martyred Polish friar, offered his life to save another inmate who had a family that had been sentenced to death in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] along with nine other prisoners because a prisoner had escaped. He was starved, along with another nine inmates. After two weeks of starvation, only Kolbe and three other inmates were still alive, and they were then executed with injections of [[phenol]].
