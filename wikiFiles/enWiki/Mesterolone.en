'''Mesterolone''' is an orally applicable [[androgen]], and [[Dihydrotestosterone|DHT]] derivative. It is sold under the brand name '''Proviron''' (as '''Provironum''' in [[Asia-Pacific]] region), by [[Bayer Schering Pharma]] (earlier by [[Schering]]). In the late 70's and early 80's it was used with some success in controlled studies of men suffering from various forms of depression. Mesterolone is a relatively weak androgen and rarely used for replacement therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nieschlag E, Behre HM, Bouchard P, ''et al.'' |title=Testosterone replacement therapy: current trends and future directions |journal=Hum. Reprod. Update |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=409–19 |year=2004 |pmid=15297434 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh035 |url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/10/5/409}}</ref>

==Trials==
In one randomized, double-blind 4-week trial, 38 dysthymic men were administered 75&nbsp;mg daily. Itil & Colleagues reported  an improvement of symptoms which included anxiety, lack of drive and desire. 
Next, they administered a high dose (450&nbsp;mg/day) or placebo in a 6-week randomized trial of 52 men with a mean age of 40 years, suffering from [[dysthymia]], [[unipolar depression|unipolar]] and [[bipolar depression]]. Both the mesterolone and placebo groups improved significantly and there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. In this series of studies mesterolone lead to a significant decrease in [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[testosterone]] levels. This is probably as a result of the extremely high dose used.
In another, 100&nbsp;mg mesterolone cipionate was administered twice monthly. With regards to plasma T levels, there was no difference between the treated vs untreated group, and baseline [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] levels were minimally affected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kövary PM, Lenau H, Niermann H, Zierden E, Wagner H |title=Testosterone levels and gonadotrophins in Klinefelter's patients treated with injections of mesterolone cipionate |journal=Arch Dermatol Res |volume=258 |issue=3 |pages=289–94 |year=1977 |month=May |pmid=883846 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4374818w9337427}}</ref>

==Bodybuilding==
Mesterolone had seen widespread use in [[bodybuilding]] primarily for [[antiestrogen]]ic activity in [[anabolic steroid]] stacks  but such use has declined after introduction of [[aromatase inhibitors]] and [[Selective estrogen-receptor modulator|SERMs]]. Most significant benefits of current Mesterolone use are considered to be maintaining [[libido]] off-cycle and also relatively and temporarily improving [[vascularity]].<ref>[http://thinksteroids.com/steroid-profiles/proviron/ Meso-RX Steroid Profiles - Proviron (Mesterolone)]</ref>
