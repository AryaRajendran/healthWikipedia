A '''plague doctor''' (Italian: ''medico della peste'', Dutch: ''pestmeester'', German: ''Pestarzt'') was a special medical physician who saw those who had [[Black Death|the plague]].<ref name="Cipolla, p. 65">Cipolla, p. 65</ref> They were specifically hired by towns that had many plague victims in times of plague [[epidemic]]s. Since the city was paying their salary, they treated everyone: both the rich and the poor.<ref>Cipolla, p. 68 3/4 down page</ref> They were not normally professionally trained experienced physicians or surgeons, and often were second-rate doctors not able to otherwise run a successful medical business or young physicians trying to establish themselves.<ref name="Cipolla, p. 65"/> 

Plague doctors by [[plague doctor contract|their covenant]] treated plague patients and were known as municipal or "community plague doctors", whereas "general practitioners" were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time.<ref name="Cipolla, p. 65"/><ref name="Ellis202">Ellis, p. 202</ref><ref name="Byrne169">Byrne (Daily), p. 169</ref><ref name="Simon3">Simon, p. 3</ref> In France and the Netherlands plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as "empirics". In one case a plague doctor had been a fruit-seller before his employment as a physician.<ref name="Byrne170">Byrne, 170</ref>

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, some doctors wore a beak-like mask which was filled with aromatic items. The masks were designed to protect them from putrid air, which (according to the [[miasmatic]] theory of disease) was seen as the cause of infection.<ref>Irvine Loudon, ''Western Medicine: An Illustrated History'' (Oxford, 2001), pp. 184, 189</ref> Being a plague doctor was unpleasant, dangerous and difficult. Their chances of survival in times of a plague epidemic were low.<ref>Cipolla, pp. 65-69</ref><ref>Robert S. Gottfried, ''The Black Death: natural and human disaster in medieval Europe'' (Simon & Schuster, 1983), p. 49.</ref>

==History==
[[Pope Clement VI]] hired several extra plague doctors during the [[Black Death]] plague. They were to attend to the sick people of Avignon. Of eighteen doctors in Venice, only one was left by 1348: five had died of the plague, and twelve were missing and may have fled.<ref>Byrne, 168</ref>

The first epidemic of bubonic plague dates back to the mid 500s, known as the [[Plague of Justinian]].<ref>Gordon, p. 471</ref> The largest epidemic was the [[Black Death]] of Europe in the fourteenth century. In medieval times the large loss of people due to the bubonic plague in a town created an economic disaster. Community plague doctors were quite valuable and were given special privileges. For example, plague doctors were freely allowed to perform [[autopsies]], which were otherwise generally forbidden in Medieval Europe, to research a cure for the plague. The city of [[Orvieto]] hired Matteo fu Angelo in 1348 for 4 times the normal rate of a doctor of 50-florin per year.<ref name="Byrne169">Byrne (Daily), p. 169</ref>

So valuable were plague doctors that, when [[Barcelona]] dispatched two to [[Tortosa]] in 1650, outlaws captured them ''en route'' and demanded a ransom. The city of Barcelona paid for their release.<ref name="Byrne169"/>

==Costume==
{{Main|Plague doctor costume}}
Some plague doctors wore a [[Plague doctor costume|special costume]], although graphic sources show that plague doctors wore a variety of garments. The garments were invented by [[Charles de L'Orme]] in 1619; they were first used in Paris, but later spread to be used throughout Europe.<ref>Christine M. Boeckl, ''Images of plague and pestilence: iconography and iconology'' (Truman State University Press, 2000), pp. 15, 27.</ref> The protective suit consisted of a heavy fabric overcoat that was waxed, a mask with glass eye openings and a cone nose shaped like a [[beak]] to hold scented substances and straw.<ref>Byrne (Encyclopedia), p. 505</ref> 

Some of the scented materials were [[ambergris]], balm-mint leaves, [[camphor]], [[cloves]], [[laudanum]], [[myrrh]], rose petals, [[storax]].<ref name="Byrne170"/> This was thought to protect the doctor from [[Miasma theory of disease|miasmatic bad air]].<ref name="Loudon">Irvine Loudon, ''Western Medicine: An Illustrated History'' (Oxford, 2001), p. 189.</ref> The straw provided a filter for the "bad air". A wooden cane pointer was used to help examine the patient without having to touch them, it was also used as a means of repenting sins, many believed that the plague was a punishment and would asked to be whipped to repent their sins.<ref>Pommerville, p. 9</ref><ref>O'Donnell, p. 143</ref>

== Public servants ==
Plague doctors served as public servants during times of epidemics starting with the [[Black Death]] of Europe in the fourteenth century. Their principal task, besides taking care of plague victims, was to record in public records the deaths due to the plague.<ref name="Byrne170"/>

In certain European cities like Florence and Perugia plague doctors were requested to do [[autopsies]] to help determine the cause of death and how the plague played a role.<ref>Wray, p. 172</ref> Plague doctors became [[testator]]s and witnesses to numerous wills during times of plague epidemics.<ref>Wray, p. 173</ref> Plague doctors also gave advice to their patients about their conduct before death.<ref name="jhmasextract276">{{cite web|url=http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/content/XX/3/276.extract |title=The Plague Doctor |publisher=Jhmas.oxfordjournals.org |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> This advice varied depending on the patient, and after the Middle Ages the nature of the relationship between doctor and patient was governed by an increasingly complex ethical code.<ref>Robert S. Gottfried, ''The Black Death: natural and human disaster in medieval Europe'' (Simon & Schuster, 1983), pp. 126-28.</ref>

== Methods ==
Plague doctors practiced [[bloodletting]] and other remedies such as putting frogs on the [[Bubo|buboes]] to "rebalance [[Humorism|the humors]]" as a normal routine.<ref>Byfield, p. 37</ref> Plague doctors could not generally interact with the general public because of the nature of their business and the possibility of spreading the disease; they could also be subject to quarantine.<ref>Robert S. Gottfried, ''The Black Death: natural and human disaster in medieval Europe'' (Simon & Schuster, 1983), p. 126.</ref>

== Notable medieval plague doctors ==
A famous plague doctor who gave medical advice about preventive measures which could be taken against the plague was [[Nostradamus]].<ref>Hogue, p. 1844</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ADri5RCWu-UC&pg=PT21&dq=Nostradamus+was+a+plague+doctor&hl=en&ei=peL5TY2rAsXbgQeQt-nmBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Nostradamus%20was%20a%20plague%20doctor&f=false |title=The essential Nostradamus: literal translation, historical commentary, and ... By Richard Smoley |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> Nostradamus' advice was the removal of infected corpses, getting fresh air, drinking clean water, and drinking a juice preparation of "rose hips".<ref>Pickover, p. 279</ref><ref name="Traité">{{cite web|url=http://www.propheties.it/bibliotheque/1539-1567/1555-003%20Nostradamus,%20Excellent%20&%20moult%20utile/index.html |title=Excellent et moult utile opuscule à tous/ nécessaire qui désirent avoir connoissan/ ce de plusieurs exquises receptes divisé/ en deux parties./ La première traicte de diverses façons/ de fardemens et senteurs pour illustrer et/ embelir la face./ La seconde nous montre la façon et/ manière de faire confitures de plusieurs/ sortes...

The Italian city of [[Pavia]], in 1479, contracted [[Giovanni de Ventura]] as a community plague doctor.<ref name="Byrne169"/><ref>King, p. 339</ref> The [[Irish people|Irish]] [[physician]], [[Niall Ó Glacáin]] (c.1563?-1653) earned deep respect in [[Spain]], [[France]] and [[Italy]] for his bravery in treating numerous victims of the plague.<ref>Stephen, p. 927</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2385830/pdf/ulstermedj00097-0038.pdf |title=THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE IN IRELAND; by J.
