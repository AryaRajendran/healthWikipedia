Erythema toxicum is characterized by blotchy red spots on the skin<ref name=pubmed>{{cite web| title=Erythema toxicum|publisher=Pubmed Health|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002429/|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> with overlying white or yellow papules or pustules.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000036724|erythema toxicum}}</ref> These lesions may be few or numerous. The eruption typically resolves within first two weeks of life, and frequently individual lesions will appear and disappear within minutes or hours. It is a benign condition thought to cause no discomfort to the baby.<ref name=pubmed/>

==Cause==
The cause of erythema toxicum is thought to be an activation of the immune system. Some neonates are more sensitive than others and develops erythematous spots all over the body. Another theory is [[Hypersensitivity]] to detergents in bedsheets and clothing is sometimes suspected, but the connection remains unproven.

It is thought to be a benign condition that causes no discomfort to the infant. The rash will generally disappear spontaneously in about 2 weeks.

==Presentation==
The rash is composed of small papular lesions, each on a separate reddened base.

==Diagnosis==
Whilst usually a straightforward diagnosis at times the appearance can raise concern that the rash could be due to [[herpes simplex]]; however, the latter generally has a more clustered and [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicular]] appearance.  

In uncertain cases, a scraping of a lesion can be taken and the fluid examined under the microscope.  Herpes lesions will have a positive [[direct fluorescent antibody]] test.  The fluid from erythema toxicum lesions will show many [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]]. If blood samples are taken they may show a high level of circulating eosinophils, however this is not usually required. 

Differential diagnosis may include [[Herpes simplex virus]], [[Impetigo]], Neonatal sepsis, [[Listeria]] and [[Varicella]] (chicken pox).

==Treatment==
Because the eruption is transient and self-limiting, no treatment is indicated.
