'''Vardenafil''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[PDE5 inhibitor]] used for treating [[erectile dysfunction]] that is sold under the trade names '''Levitra''' ([[Bayer|Bayer AG]], [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]], and [[Schering Plough|SP]]) and '''Staxyn'''.

==History==

Vardenafil was co-marketed by [[Bayer|Bayer Pharmaceuticals]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], and [[Schering-Plough]] under the trade name ''Levitra''. As of 2005, the co-promotion rights of GSK on ''Levitra'' have been returned to Bayer in many markets outside the U.S. In Italy, Bayer sells vardenafil as ''Levitra'' and GSK sells it as '''Vivanza'''.  Thus, because of [[European Union]] trade rules, [[parallel import]]s might result in ''Vivanza'' sold next to ''Levitra'' in the EU.

An orally disintegrating form, marketed as ''Staxyn'', has been gaining approvals in countries such as the United States<ref>http://www.pharmpro.com/News/Feeds/2010/06/pharmaceutical-companies-bayer-new-erectile-dysfunction-treatment-staxyn-approve/</ref> and Canada.<ref>http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/832217/staxyn-new-innovation-in-erectile-dysfunction-helps-younger-men-rise-to-the-occasion</ref>

==Clinical use==
{{main|PDE5 inhibitor}}

Vardenafil's indications and contra-indications are the same as with other PDE5 inhibitors; it is closely related in function to [[sildenafil]] citrate (Viagra) and [[tadalafil]] (Cialis). The difference between the vardenafil molecule and sildenafil citrate is a [[nitrogen]] atom's position and the change of sildenafil's [[piperazine]] ring [[methyl group]] to an [[ethyl group]]. Tadalafil is structurally different from both sildenafil and vardenafil. Vardenafil's relatively short effective time is comparable to but somewhat longer than sildenafil's.

Beyond its indications for erectile dysfunction, vardenafil may be effective in the treatment of [[premature ejaculation]], where it may significantly increase the time from vaginal penetration to ejaculation.<ref name="IJIR Premature Ejaculation">{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v21/n4/abs/ijir200921a.html|title=Effects of vardenafil administration on intravaginal ejaculatory latency time in men with lifelong premature ejaculation|author=A Aversa et al.|accessdate=2010-12-14}}</ref>

===Adverse drug reactions===

The common, adverse drug reactions (side-effects) are the same as with other PDE5 inhibitors. The frequent vardenafil-specific side-effect is nausea; the infrequent side-effects are abdominal pain, back pain, [[photosensitivity]], abnormal vision, eye pain, facial [[edema]], [[hypotension]], palpitation, [[tachycardia]], [[arthralgia]], [[myalgia]], rash, itch, and [[priapism]].

One possibly serious, but rare, side-effect with vardenafil is heart attack.  Also, in rare cases, vardenafil use may cause [[priapism]], a very painful emergency condition that can cause impotence if left untreated.<ref name="MedScape PDE5">{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/549253_6|title=Counseling Patients About Sexual Issues: Drug-Induced Priapism|author= Schools of Pharmacy (Glen L. Stimmel, Pharm.D., and Mary A. Gutierrez, Pharm.D.) and Medicine (Glen L. Stimmel, Pharm.D.), University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.|accessdate=2010-12-06|publisher=Medscape}}</ref>

On 18 October 2007, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced that a warning about possible deafness ([[Deafness|sudden hearing loss]]) would be added to the drug labels of Vardenafil, and other PDE5 inhibitors.<ref name="FDA PDE5">{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm| title= FDA Announces Revisions to Labels for Cialis, Levitra and Viagra| author= | date= 2007-10-18| publisher= [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate=2009-08-06 }}</ref>

===Drug interactions===

Vardenafil, as with all PDE5 inhibitors, should not be used by men taking [[nitrate]] medications, because combining them with vardenafil might provoke potentially life-threatening [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure).

Further, Vardenafil causing lengthening of the [[QT interval]]. Therefore it should not be taken by men taking other medications at affect the QT interval (such as amiodarone).

===Dose forms===
[[File:000805lg Levitra.jpg|right|thumb|Levitra 20mg Oral Tablet]]
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Levitratablet.jpg|thumb|Levitra Tablet]] -->
It is available in 2.5&nbsp;mg, 5&nbsp;mg, 10&nbsp;mg, and 20&nbsp;mg doses in round orange tablets.  The normal starting dose is 10&nbsp;mg (roughly equivalent to 50&nbsp;mg of sildenafil). Vardenafil should be taken 1 to 2 hours prior to [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], with a maximum dose frequency of once per day. In some territories, such as the UK, only certain doses may be available. 

Vardenafil is also available under the name Staxyn as a tablet which dissolves on the tongue rather than being swallowed in the form of a pill.
