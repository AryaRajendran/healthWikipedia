The '''inferior cervical ganglion''' is situated between the base of the transverse process of the last [[cervical vertebra]] and the neck of the [[first rib]], on the medial side of the [[costocervical artery]]. 

Its form is irregular; it is larger in size than the [[middle cervical ganglion]], and is frequently fused with the first [[thoracic ganglion]], under which circumstances it is then called the "[[stellate ganglion]]." 

==Path==
It is probably formed by the coalescence of two ganglia which correspond to the seventh and eighth cervical nerves. 

It is connected to the middle cervical ganglion by two or more cords, one of which forms a loop around the [[subclavian artery]] and supplies offsets to it. This loop is named the [[subclavian loop|''ansa subclavia'']] (Vieussenii).

The ganglion sends [[gray rami communicantes]] to the seventh and eighth cervical nerves.

==Branches==
It gives off the ''inferior cardiac nerve'', and ''offsets to blood vessels''.

===Offsets to bloodvessels===
The ''offsets to bloodvessels'' form plexuses on the subclavian artery and its branches. 

The plexus on the [[vertebral artery]] is continued on to the [[basilar]], [[posterior cerebral]], and [[cerebellar arteries]]. 

The plexus on the [[inferior thyroid artery]] accompanies the artery to the [[thyroid gland]], and communicates with the [[recurrent]] and [[external laryngeal nerves]], with the [[superior cardiac nerve]], and with the plexus on the [[common carotid artery]].
