Stopped blood circulation has historically proven irreversible in most cases. Prior to the invention of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR), [[defibrillation]], [[epinephrine]] injection, and other treatments in the 20th century, the absence of blood circulation (and vital functions related to blood circulation) was historically considered to be the official definition of [[death]]. With the advent of these strategies, cardiac arrest came to be called "clinical death" rather than simply "death" to reflect the possibility of post-arrest resuscitation; for medical purposes, it is considered to be the final physical state before permanent death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Limits of reversal==

When the heartbeat stops, a person is suffering clinical death - by definition. But consciousness is not lost until 15-20 seconds later. Up to this point, a person doesn't feel anything about the critical situation.

Most tissues and organs of the body can survive clinical death for considerable periods. Blood circulation can be stopped in the entire body below the heart for at least 30 minutes, with injury to the spinal cord being a limiting factor.<ref>{{cite journal

In 1990, the laboratory of resuscitation pioneer [[Peter Safar]] discovered that reducing body temperature by three degrees Celsius after restarting blood circulation could double the time window of recovery from clinical death without brain damage from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.

==Hypothermia during clinical death==
Reduced body temperature, or [[therapeutic hypothermia]], during clinical death slows the rate of injury accumulation, and extends the time period during which clinical death can be survived.  The decrease in the rate of injury can be approximated by the [[Q10 (temperature coefficient) | Q<sub>10</sub>]] rule, which states that the rate of biochemical reactions decreases by a factor of two for every 10°C reduction in temperature. As a result, humans can sometimes survive periods of clinical death exceeding one hour at temperatures below −20°C.<ref>{{cite journal

Patients supported by methods that certainly maintain enough blood circulation and oxygenation for sustaining life during stopped heartbeat and breathing, such as [[cardiopulmonary bypass]], are not customarily considered to be clinically dead. All parts of the body except the heart and lungs continue to function normally. Clinical death occurs only if machines providing sole circulatory support are turned off.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Controlled clinical death==
Certain surgeries for [[cerebral aneurysm]]s or [[aortic arch]] defects require that blood circulation be stopped while repairs are performed.  This deliberate temporary induction of clinical death is called [[standstill operation|circulatory arrest]].  It is typically performed by lowering body temperature to 18°C (64 °F) – 20°C (68 °F) and stopping the heart and lungs. This state is called [[deep hypothermic circulatory arrest]]. At such low temperatures most patients can tolerate the clinically dead state for up to 30 minutes without incurring significant brain injury.<ref>{{cite journal

==Clinical death and the determination of death==
Death was historically believed to be an event that coincided with the onset of clinical death. It is now understood that death is a series of physical events, not a single one, and determination of permanent death is dependent on other factors beyond simple cessation of breathing and heartbeat.<ref name="Crippen"/>

If clinical death occurs unexpectedly, it will be treated as a medical emergency. [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] will be initiated. In a United States hospital, a [[hospital emergency codes|Code Blue]] will be declared and [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] procedures used to attempt to restart a normal heartbeat. This effort will continue until either the heart is restarted, or a physician determines that continued efforts are useless and recovery is impossible. If this determination is made, the physician will pronounce [[legal death]] and resuscitation efforts will stop.

If clinical death is expected due to terminal illness or withdrawal of supportive care, often a [[Do Not Resuscitate]] (DNR) or "no code" order will be in place. This means that no resuscitation efforts will be made, and a physician or nurse may pronounce [[legal death]] at the onset of clinical death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A patient with working heart and lungs who is determined to be [[brain death|brain dead]] can be pronounced [[legal death|legally dead]] without clinical death occurring.  However, some courts have been reluctant to impose such a determination over the religious objections of family members, such as in the [[Jesse Koochin]] case.<ref>Appel, JM. Defining Death:  When Physicians and Families Differ” ''Journal of Medical Ethics'' Fall 2005</ref>  Similar issues were also raised by the case of [[Mordechai Dov Brody]], but the child died before a court could resolve the matter.<ref>
