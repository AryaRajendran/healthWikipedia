The '''National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians''' is a [[United States of America|US]] certification agency covering prehospital medical providers.

== History ==
NREMT was established in 1970 in response to President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s Committee on Highway Traffic Safety recommended a national certifying agency for [[Emergency Medical Technician]]s in order to establish and standardize training requirements.<ref name=NREMT-history>[http://www.nremt.org/about/nremt_history.asp NREMT History]</ref>

== Standards ==
Most states use or require NREMT testing for some level of state certification.<ref name=NREMT-history/><ref name=USBLS>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos101.htm Emergency Medical Technician from US Bureau of Labor Statistics]</ref><ref name=UMSL>[http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/ooh9899/196.htm "Emergency Medical Technicians" from University of Missouri, St. Louis]</ref> NREMT recognizes three levels of EMT: [[EMT Basic|Basic]], [[EMT Intermediate|Intermediate]] (two types/levels), and [[Paramedic]] (some states may have additional certifications).<ref name=USBLS/> NREMT certification at an [[EMT Intermediate]] level may or may not be sufficient for some state [[EMT Intermediate|EMT-I]] requirements.<ref name=CO>[http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/em/CertificationEducation/nremt.html Colorado EMT requirement overview]</ref> While NREMT certification may be mandatory for new state certification, it is not necessarily required for renewals.<ref name=CO/> These procedures and requirements vary from state to state. In 1986, military emergency rooms were required to certify all medical technicians through NREMT.<ref name=DTIC>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA179841 "National Registry of EMT Certification of Air Force Emergency Room Technicians" from the Defense Technical Information Center]</ref>

==Levels of certification==
===National Registry Paramedic (NRP)===
Highest level of [[certification]] through the NREMT.  This represents the pinnacle of the EMS ladder. [[Paramedics]] are considered [[Advanced Life Support]] (ALS) and can administer a range of [[medication]], as well as perform advanced electrical and invasive [[surgical]] interventions (please see [[Paramedics]] for a full list of skills.)

===National Registry Advanced Emergency Medical Technician (NRAEMT)===
1999 EMT-Intermediate National Standard Curriculum as defined by the [[Department of Transportation]] - [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA)<ref name=DOT>[http://www.wvochs.org/shared/content/ems/education/curriculum/emti/overview/overview.pdf DOT Standards for EMT-I]</ref>

===National Registry Emergency Medical Technician (NREMT)===
This level of certification provides [[Basic Life Support]] (BLS). (please see [[Emergency medical technician]] for a full list of skills)

===National Registry Emergency Medical Responder (NREMR)===
Formerly called "first responder." This is the entry level into [[emergency medical services]] (EMS).  They are trained in [[CPR]], basic [[first aid]] and patient assessment.  Most police and fire services require their employees to be emergency medical responders at a minimum. This course is usually 40-60 hours in length.

==Controversy==
The NREMT has been criticized for failing to prevent cheating during some exams. The Washington, D.C. Fire Department<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcfd.com |title=District of Columbia Fire Department - "The Real Deal" |publisher=DCFD.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> was investigated for cheating on the NREMT certification exam;<ref>{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/23/AR2009042304902.html |title=City Investigates Alleged Cheating on EMT Test |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2009-04-24|accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> however, an extensive investigation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jems.com/article/news/investigative-outcome-reported |title=Investigative Outcome of a Reported Compromise on the National EMS Certification Examination - News - at |publisher=Jems.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> by the NREMT, [[Pearson VUE]] (the test administrator), with assistance from the DC Fire and EMS department<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fems.dc.gov/DC/FEMS |title=FEMS |publisher=Fems.dc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> and the DC police, revealed no evidence of cheating at Pearson VUE’s LaPlata, MD testing center.

The NREMT works with the EMS community to implement the National EMS System including the EMS Agenda for the Future,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/ems/agenda/index.html |title=EMS Agenda for the Future Implementation Guide |publisher=Nhtsa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> EMS Education Agenda: A Systems Approach,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/ems/EdAgenda/final/index.html |title=EMS Education Agenda for the Future: A Systems Approach |publisher=Nhtsa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> and National Scope of Practice Model.<ref>http://www.nasemsd.org/documents/FINALEMSSept2006_PMS314.pdf</ref>
