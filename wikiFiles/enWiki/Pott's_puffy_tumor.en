'''Pott's puffy tumor''', first described by Sir [[Percivall Pott]] in 1760, is a rare clinical entity characterized by subperiosteal abscess associated with osteomyelitis. It is characterized by an [[osteomyelitis]] of the frontal bone, either direct or through haematogenic spread. This results in a swelling on the forehead, hence the name. The infection can also spread inwards, leading to an intracranial [[abscess]]. Pott's Puffy tumor can be associated with cortical vein thrombosis, epidural abscess, subdural empyema, and brain abscess. The cause of vein thrombosis is explained by venous derange of the frontal sinus, which occurs through diplopic veins, which communicate with the dural venous plexus; septic thrombi can potentially evolve from foci within the frontal sinus and propagate through this venous system. This type of chronic osteomyelitis of the frontal bone is confused with acute sub-periosteal abscess of the frontal bone, which presents as a discrete collection over the frontal sinus.

Although it can affect all ages, it is mostly found among teenagers and [[adolescent]]s. It is usually seen as a complication of frontal [[sinusitis]] or trauma, predominantly in the adolescent age group.  

== Etiology ==
* Frontal sinusitis, acute or chronic.
* Frontal trauma, usually blunt.
* Some cases have been seen in a context of intranasal substance abuse (cocaine, methamphetamine).
* Post-surgical: after frontal sinus reconstruction<ref>{{cite journal
