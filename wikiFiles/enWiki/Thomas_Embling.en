'''Thomas Embling''' (26 August 1814 &ndash; 17 January 1893) was a doctor from the [[United Kingdom]] who took an interest in the humane treatment of inmates in [[insane asylums|asylum]]s before emigrating to Melbourne, Australia where he set about reforming the [[Yarra Bend Asylum]].  Later on Thomas Embling took up the cause of the gold miners in [[Eureka Stockade|Eureka]] and had a successful career in the early parliament of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

== Yarra Bend Asylum ==
{{main|Yarra Bend Asylum}}
Embling's first appointment in Australia was to be as an assistant to the Colonial Surgeon of Victoria.  However parliament members [[James Johnston (Australian businessman)|James Johnston]] and [[Charles Ebden]] put forward the proposition that Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum required a Resident Medical Officer and Embling was highly suitable.<ref name="Brothers" /> Although not a psychiatrist, Embling had a pioneering interest in the 'moral treatment' of mental illness<ref name=VIFMH/><ref>"moral treatment" was supposed to be the foundation of treatment at Yarra Bend, as specified in the "Regulations for the Guidance of Officers, Attendants and Servants of the Lunatic Asylum at Port Phillip" (later known as Yarra Bend), published in the Government Gazette of 1849.(Brothers, p.19)</ref>
[[File:Yarrabend4.jpg|thumb|200px|Wood engraving published in The Illustrated Melbourne Post]]
Embling's early days at Yarra Bend were not easy.  Superintendent George Watson was not pleased with the appointment of a Resident Medical Officer.  With the assistance of displaced Visiting Medical Officer Dr Cussen,<ref name="Bonwick" /> Watson attempted to thwart Embling's efforts to become involved in the care of inmates.  He was refused a pass key and denied access to many of the asylum buildings, including the accommodation that he was to have been provided on the asylum grounds.  Efforts to hinder Embling however, only served to strengthen his resolve to become actively involved in the clinical management of his patients.<ref name=VIFMH/>  What he saw at Yarra Bend shocked him, his first impressions ''"were those of great astonishment not unmixed with pain … I saw much that was incomprehensible, and much disreputable."''<ref name=adb /> 

Despite the obstacles he encountered, Embling implemented significant reforms in a short space of time.  He ordered the removal of [[Handcuffs|manacles]], [[Straitjacket|camisoles]] and restraining gloves and rejected the then popular psychiatric practice of punitive "treatment".<ref name=VIFMH/>  These reforms were not popular with the Superintendent, nor with the colonial surgeon.<ref name=adb />  He was subsequently charged and brought before a disciplinary hearing, on the grounds that he was "too heroic to be a medical officer".<ref name=VIFMH/>

=== Parliamentary enquiry ===
Aware that his accusers were highly regarded by the government, Embling briefed supportive parliamentarian James Johnston on the activities and corruption he had witnessed at Yarra Bend.<ref name="Brothers_a">Brothers, p.22</ref> The story was picked up by the press, and in April 1852, only four months after Embling's appointment, [[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]] newspaper called for a reorganisation of the asylum.  Public support for an enquiry grew,<ref name=VIFMH /> and following a motion put by Johnston in July 1852, a Select Committee was appointed "To Enquire into the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum and to take Evidence".<ref name="Brothers_a" /> 

The committee sat from August to December 1852,<ref name=VIFMH /> with the final report<ref>{{cite book

The Committee found that patients had been severely maltreated and that the Superintendent was "grossly negligent as well as highly culpable".  Praise was heaped upon Embling by the Committee, declaring "it is with extreme regret we observe the efforts of this gentleman to promote the efficiency of a valuable institution, and to check the abuses that so seriously affected its usefulness…"<ref>Bonwick, p.33</ref>  

[[Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Charles La Trobe]] dismissed the entire staff of Yarra Bend, including Embling.  Superintendent Watson was given another post which lead to [[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]] launching a bitter attack on La Trobe, stating that Embling had been "turned adrift".<ref name="Brothers_b">Brothers, p.26</ref>  Despite the outcry against Embling's dismissal, Dr Robert Bowie was appointed as the first Medical Superintendent at Yarra Bend<ref>Brothers, p.27</ref> and Embling set up a private practice in Gore Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne.<ref name=adb /><ref>Australian Electoral Rolls 1856, Victoria</ref>

== Politician ==
[[File:8hoursday banner 1856.jpg|thumb|200px|Eight-hour day banner, Melbourne, 1856]]
Embling publicly supported the popular movement at the [[Eureka Stockade]] near [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] in December 1854 and took over the chair at a public meeting which passed resolutions in favour of the gold miner's cause.<ref name=adb/>  In 1855, he supported the [[Australian labour movement|eight-hours labour movement]] and is credited with coining the slogan, 'Eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest'.<ref name=adb/> 
 
Embling stood in the [[Parliament of Victoria]] as a [[Victorian Legislative Council|Member of the Legislative Council]] in [[County of Bourke, Victoria|North Bourke]] from September 1855 and until March 1856.<ref name=rememberdb/>  It was during this time that Embling was able to use his experience in the workings of lunatic asylums as he sat on an Asylum Board of Enquiry.<ref name="Brothers_b" />  Embling later was elected as a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] in the seat of [[Electoral district of Collingwood|Collingwood]] in November 1856, becoming a founding member of the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]]. He served in the seat until July 1861 and again February 1866 – December 1867.<ref name=rememberdb /> Following disagreements with his fellow politicians<ref name=adb /> and poor health<ref name=VIFMH /> Embling withdrew from politics in 1869 and resumed his general medical practice.

==Zoological Society and the acclimatisation of animals==
Embling was a strong advocate of the introduction of exotic animals into [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. In 1856 he lobbied [[Parliament of Victoria|parliament]] for the introduction of [[alpacas]]. In 1858 he proposed importing [[camel]]s for use in desert exploration and he spoke at length in Parliament and in the Melbourne press on the subject. He supported the establishment of the Zoological Society and proposed that [[George James Landells]] be sent to [[India]] to purchase camels.<ref name="Bonyhady">{{Cite book |last=Bonyhady |first=Tim |title=Burke and Wills: From Melbourne to Myth|publisher=David Ell Press|year=1991 |isbn=0-908197-91-8}}</ref> The camels Landells returned with were used on the [[Burke and Wills expedition]] in 1860.<ref>{{cite web
