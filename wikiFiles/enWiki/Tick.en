'''Ticks''' are small [[arachnid]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Ixodida'''. Along with [[mite]]s, they constitute the subclass [[Acarina]]. Ticks are [[ectoparasite]]s (external [[parasite]]s), living by [[hematophagy]] on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. Ticks are [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of a number of diseases, including [[Lyme disease]], [[Q fever]] (rare; more commonly transmitted by infected excreta),<ref>{{cite web |title=Q fever| url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control]] |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> [[Colorado tick fever]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[African tick bite fever]], [[tularemia]], tick-borne [[relapsing fever]], [[babesiosis]], [[ehrlichiosis]], [[Tick paralysis]] and [[tick-borne meningoencephalitis]], as well as bovine [[anaplasmosis]].

==Taxonomy==
Of the three [[family (biology)|families]] of ticks, one – [[Nuttalliellidae]] – comprises a single species, ''Nuttalliella namaqua''. The remaining two families contain the hard ticks ([[Ixodidae]]) and the soft ticks ([[Argasidae]]).<ref name="list">[[#Guglielmone|Guglielmone ''et al.'' (2010)]]</ref><ref>[[#Goddard|Goddard (2008)]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=f-huycwyEvwC&pg=PA80 p. 80]</ref>

'''[[Ixodidae]]''' (>700 species) are distinguished from the Argasidae by the presence of a scutum or hard shield. In Ixodidae nymphs and adults, a prominent capitulum (head) projects forwards from the body; in the Argasidae, conversely, the capitulum is concealed beneath the body.<ref name="Molyneux">[[#Molyneux|Molyneux (1993)]] [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jj18axV3TTAC&pg=PA6 p. 6]</ref>

The '''[[Argasidae]]''' contain 193 species, although the composition of the genera is less certain, and more study is needed before the genera can become stable.<ref name="list"/> The currently accepted genera are ''[[Antricola]]'', ''[[Argas]]'', ''[[Nothaspis]]'', ''[[Ornithodoros]]'', and ''[[Otobius]]''.<ref name="list"/> Though common in North America, they feed rapidly, primarily on birds, and are very rarely found to parasitize land animals or humans.<ref name="SamuelPybus2001">[[#Allan|Allan (2001)]]</ref>

The family '''[[Nuttalliellidae]]''' contains only a single species, ''Nuttalliella namaqua'', a tick found in southern [[Africa]] from [[Tanzania]] to [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]],.<ref name="list"/><ref>[[#Keirans|Keirans ''et al.'' (1976)]]</ref> It can be distinguished from [[Ixodidae|ixodid ticks]] and [[Argasidae|argasid ticks]] by a combination of characters, including the position of the stigmata, lack of setae, strongly corrugated integument, and form of the fenestrated plates.<ref>[[#Roshdy|Roshdy ''et al.'' (1983)]]</ref>

'''Fossilized ticks''' are common. Recent hypotheses based on total-evidence approach analysis place the origin of ticks in the [[Cretaceous]] ({{Ma|65|146}}), with most of the evolution and dispersal occurring during the [[Tertiary]] ({{Ma|5|65}}).<ref>[[#Fuente|de la Fuente (2003)]]</ref> The oldest example is an argasid (bird) tick from Cretaceous [[New Jersey]] [[amber]]. The younger [[Baltic amber|Baltic]] and [[Dominican amber]]s have also yielded examples, all of which can be placed in living genera.

==Range and habitat==
Tick species are widely distributed around the world,<ref>[[#Magnarelli|Magnarelli (2009)]]</ref> but they tend to flourish more in countries with warm, humid climates, because they require a certain amount of moisture in the air to undergo [[metamorphosis]], and because low temperatures inhibit their development from egg to larva.<ref name="London1905">[[#Nuttall|Nuttall (1905)]]</ref> [[Ticks of domestic animals]] are especially common and varied in tropical countries, where they cause considerable harm to livestock by transmission of many species of pathogens and also causing direct parasitic damage.

For an ecosystem to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host species in the area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated.<ref name="Wall-55">[[#Wall|Wall & Shearer (2001)]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=AMljlwB0ej0C&pg=PA55 p. 55]</ref> Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly ''I.&nbsp;scapularis'', have been studied using geographic information systems ([[Geographic information system|GIS]]), to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, and the presence of deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.<ref name="SamuelPybus2001"/>

==Anatomy and physiology==
Ticks, like mites, have bodies which are divided into two primary sections: the anterior ''capitulum'' (or ''gnathosoma''), which contains the head and mouthparts; and the posterior ''idiosoma'' which contains the legs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs.<ref name="Wall-55" />

===Diet and feeding behaviors===
[[File:Ticks on the end of a twig.jpg|thumb|right|Ticks, such as these ''[[Ixodes scapularis]]'', climb to the ends of leaves or branches and attach to hosts that brush against them.]]
Ticks satisfy all of their nutritional requirements on a diet of [[blood]], a practice known as [[hematophagy]]. They extract the blood by cutting a hole in the host's [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]], into which they insert their [[hypostome]], likely keeping the blood from clotting by excreting an [[anticoagulant]].<ref>[[#Goddard|Goddard (2008)]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=f-huycwyEvwC&pg=PA82 p. 82]</ref>

===Legs===
[[File:Ixodes scapularis.jpg|thumb|right|Ticks have eight legs.]]Like all arachnids, ticks have eight legs. The legs of Ixodidae and Argasidae are similar in structure. Each leg is composed of six segments: the coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, and tarsus. Each of these segments is connected by muscles which allow for [[flexion]] and [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]], but the coxae have limited lateral movement. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.<ref name="Sonenshine-2005-p14">[[#Sonenshine|Sonenshine (2005)]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=dKlUARLKT9IC&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref><ref name="nicholson-486">[[#Nicholson|Nicholson ''et al.'' (2009)]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=6R1v9o-uaI4C&pg=PA486 p. 486]</ref>

In addition to being used for [[locomotion]], the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory organ, the [[Haller's organ]], which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents.<ref name="Sonenshine-2005-p14" /><ref name="nicholson-486" /><ref>For Haller's organ, see also: [[#Mehlhorn|Mehlhorn (2008)]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=Jpg1ysgVn-AC&pg=PA582 p. 582].</ref>

==Life cycle and reproduction==

===Ixodidae===

Both ixodid and argasid ticks undergo three primary stages of development: larval, nymphal, and adult.<ref>[[#Dennis|Dennis & Piesman (2005)]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=dKlUARLKT9IC&pg=PA5 p. 5]</ref> Ixodid ticks require three hosts, and their life cycle takes at least one year to complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When larvae emerge, they feed primarily on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger hosts and molt to adults. Female adults attach to larger hosts, feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.<ref name="SamuelPybus2001"/>

===Argasidae===
Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may go through several nymphal stages, requiring a meal of blood each time.<ref name="Aeschlimann-182">[[#Aeschlimann|Aeschlimann & Freyvogel, 1995]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=YwJF6qzhrbkC&pg=PA177 p. 182]</ref> Their lifecycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs over the course of her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt to nymphs. Nymphs may go through as many as seven [[instar]]s, each requiring a blood meal. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.<ref name="SamuelPybus2001"/>

==Medical issues==

===Tick-borne disease===
{{Main|Tick-borne disease}}
Tick-borne illnesses are caused by infection with a variety of [[pathogen]]s, including ''[[Rickettsia]]'' and other types of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and [[protozoa]]. Because ticks can harbor more than one disease-causing agent, patients can be infected with more than one pathogen at the same time, compounding the difficulty in diagnosis and treatment. Major tick-borne diseases include [[Lyme disease]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[relapsing fever]], [[tularemia]], [[tick-borne meningoencephalitis]], [[Colorado tick fever]], [[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]], [[babesiosis]], and [[cytauxzoonosis]]. A recent find is ''Candidatus neoehrlichia mikurensis'', a bacterium which causes blood clots; present in 9% of [[rodent]]s, it mainly affects persons with lowered immune defense, and can be cured with antibiotics.<ref name=cdneo>[[#Andersson|Andersson & Råberg (2011)]]</ref>

Tick bites may also induce a delayed allergy to [[red meat]], involving the [[oligosaccharide]], galactose alpha-1,3-galactose: the food-induced [[allergic reaction|reactions]], including [[anaphylaxis]], characteristically present several hours after eating in subjects who have experienced a large local reaction to tick bites up to six months earlier.<ref name=theaustralian>{{cite news |author=Bianca Nogrady |date=May 10, 2008 |title=One tick red meat can do without |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/one-tick-red-meat-can-do-without/story-e6frg8y6-1111116286444 |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name=saleh2012>[[#Saleh|Saleh ''et al.'' (2012)]]</ref>

Eggs can be infected with pathogens inside the [[ovary|ovaries]], meaning the larval ticks can be infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host.<ref name="Aeschlimann-182" />

===First aid===
[[File:Tick engorged with thumb.jpg|thumb|upright=0.87|Engorged tick attached to back of [[toddler]]'s head. Adult thumb shown for scale.]]
In general, the best way to remove an adult tick is mechanically. To facilitate prompt removal, fine-tipped [[tweezers]] can be used to grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and detach it by applying a steady upward force without crushing, jerking or twisting, in such a way as to avoid leaving behind mouthparts or provoking regurgitation of infective fluids into the wound.<ref name=bada>{{cite web |url=http://www.bada-uk.org/defence/removal/indextickremoval.php |title=Correct tick removal |publisher=Borreliosis and Associated Diseases Awareness UK |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref><ref name=lda>{{cite web |url=http://www.lymediseaseaction.org.uk/about-ticks/tick-removal/ |title=Tick removal |publisher=LDA |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref><ref name=cdc>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html |title=Tick removal |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref> Proprietary tick removal tools are also available.<ref name=bada/><ref name=lda/> It is important to disinfect the bite area thoroughly after removal of the tick.<ref name=cdc/> The tick can be stored and, in case of signs or symptoms of a subsequent infection, shown to a clinician for identification purposes together with details of where and when the bite occurred.<ref name=bada/> If the tick's head and mouthparts are no longer attached to its body after removal, a [[punch biopsy]] may be  necessary to remove any parts left inside the patient.<ref>[[#Zuber|Zuber & Mayeaux (2003)]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=_lmEDeRGHHMC&pg=PA63 p. 63]</ref>

===Population control measures===
With the possible exception of widespread [[DDT]] use in the [[Soviet Union]], attempts to limit the population or distribution of disease-causing ticks have been very unsuccessful.<ref name="Dennis-3">[[#Dennis|Dennis & Piesman, 2005]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=dKlUARLKT9IC&pg=PA3 p. 3]</ref>

The parasitoid [[chalcid wasp]] ''[[Ixodiphagus hookeri]]'' has long been investigated for its potential to control tick populations. It lays its eggs into ticks; the hatching wasps kill their hosts.

Another natural form of control for ticks is the [[guineafowl]], a bird species which consumes mass quantities of ticks.<ref>[[#Duffy|Duffy ''et al.'' (1992)]]</ref> Just two birds can clear {{convert|2|acre|m2}} in a single year.

Topical (drops/dust) flea/tick medicines may be toxic to animals and humans. [[Phenothrin]] (85.7%) in combination with [[methoprene]] was a popular topical flea/tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult fleas and ticks. Methoprene is an insect growth regulator that interrupts the insect's lifecycle by killing the eggs. However, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] required at least one manufacturer of these products to withdraw some products and include strong cautionary statements on others, warning of adverse reactions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/flea-tick-drops.htm |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] |title=Hartz flea and tick drops for cats and kittens to be phased out |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100111070012/http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/flea-tick-drops.htm}}</ref>

====Deer ticks====
[[File:Tick-in-a-dog.jpg|thumb|upright|An adult tick found on a German shepherd dog, ballpoint pen is shown for scale]]
The black-legged or deer tick (''[[Ixodes scapularis]]'') is dependent on the [[white-tailed deer]] for reproduction. Larval and nymphal stages (immature ticks  that cannot reproduce) of the deer tick feed on birds and small mammals. The adult female tick needs a large three-day blood meal from the deer before she can reproduce and lay her 2000 or more eggs. Deer are the primary hosts for the adult deer ticks, and are key to their reproductive success.<ref name="Stafford">[[#Stafford|Stafford (2007)]]</ref>

Numerous studies have shown the abundance and distribution of deer ticks are correlated with deer densities.<ref name="Stafford"/><ref>[[#Rand|Rand ''et al.'' (2004)]]</ref><ref>[[#Walter|Walter ''et al.'' (2002)]]</ref><ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson ''et al.'' (1990)]]</ref>

When the deer population was reduced by 74% at a 248-acre (100-ha) study site in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], for example, the number of nymphal ticks collected at the site decreased by 92%.<ref name="Stafford"/> The relationship between deer abundance, tick abundance, and human cases of Lyme disease was well documented in the Mumford Cove Community in [[Groton, Connecticut]], from 1996 to 2004. The deer population in Mumford Cove was reduced from about 77 to about 10 deer per square mile (four deer per square kilometer) after two years of controlled hunting. After the initial reduction, the deer population was maintained at low levels. Reducing deer densities to 10 deer per square mile was adequate to reduce by more than 90% the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease in Mumford Cove.<ref>[[#Kilpatrick|Kilpatrick & LaBonte (2007)]]</ref>

A 2006 study by [[Penn State]]'s Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics indicated reducing the deer population in small areas (but not large areas) may lead to higher tick densities, resulting in more tick-borne infections in rodents, leading to a high prevalence of tick-borne [[encephalitis]] and creating a tick hot-spot.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060830214714.htm |title=Deer-free areas may be haven for ticks, disease |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |date=September 4, 2006}}</ref>
