A recent classification recommends blood pressure criteria for defining normal blood pressure, [[prehypertension]], hypertension (stages I and II), and [[isolated systolic hypertension]], which is a common occurrence among the elderly. These readings are based on the average of seated blood pressure readings that were properly measured during 2 or more office visits. In individuals older than 50 years, hypertension is considered to be present when a person's blood pressure is consistently at least 140&nbsp;mmHg systolic or 90&nbsp;mmHg diastolic. Patients with blood pressures over 130/80&nbsp;mmHg along with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1]] or [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2]] [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], or [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] require further treatment.<ref name="jnc7">{{cite journal | author=Chobanian AV, Bakris GL, Black HR, ''et al.'' |title=Seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure |journal=Hypertension |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=1206–52 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14656957 | doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000107251.49515.c2 |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/42/6/1206}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
Hypertension is one of the most common complex disorders. The etiology of hypertension differs widely amongst individuals within a large population.<ref name="pmid16754793">{{cite journal |author=Dickson ME, Sigmund CD |title=Genetic basis of hypertension: revisiting angiotensinogen |journal=Hypertension |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=14–20 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16754793 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000227932.13687.60 |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/48/1/14}}</ref> And by definition, essential hypertension has no identifiable cause. However, several [[risk factor]]s have been identified. 

Hypertension may be secondary to other diseases but over 95% of patients have
essential hypertension which is of unknown origin. It is observed though that:
* Having a personal family history of hypertension increases the likelihood that an individual develops HPT.<ref name="isbn0-07-147691-1">{{cite book |author=Loscalzo, Joseph; Fauci, Anthony S.; Braunwald, Eugene; Dennis L.

More than 50 genes have been examined in association studies with hypertension, and the number is constantly growing. One of these genes is the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, studied extensively by Kim et al. They showed that increasing the number of AGT increases the blood pressure and hence this may cause hypertension.<ref name="pmid16754793"/> Twins have been included in studies measuring ambulatory blood pressure; from these studies it has been suggested that essential hypertension contains a large genetic influence.<ref name="pmid16754793"/> Supporting data has emerged from animal studies as well as clinical studies in human populations. The majority of these studies support the concept that the inheritance is probably multifactorial or that a number of different genetic defects each has an elevated blood pressure as one of its [[phenotypic]] expressions. However, the genetic influence upon hypertension is not fully understood at the moment. It is believed that linking hypertension-related phenotypes with specific variations of the genome may yield definitive evidence of heritability.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kotchen TA, Kotchen JM, Grim CE, ''et al.'' |title=Genetic determinants of hypertension: identification of candidate phenotypes |journal=Hypertension |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |year=2000 |month=July |pmid=10904005 |doi= |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10904005}}</ref> Another view is that hypertension can be caused by mutations in single genes, inherited on a Mendelian basis.<ref name=amn>{{cite web | author=Williams B et al.; British Hypertension Society; Michael Sutters, MD | title = Hypertension Etiology & Classification - Secondary Hypertension | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work = | url=http://www.health.am/hypertension/secondary-hypertension/ | year = 2006 | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref>

Hypertension can also be age related, and if this is the case, it is likely to be multifactorial. One possible mechanism involves a reduction in vascular compliance due to the stiffening of the arteries. This can build up due to isolated systolic hypertension with a widened pulse pressure. A decrease in glomerular filtration rate is related to aging and this results in decreasing efficiency of sodium excretion. The developing of certain diseases such as renal microvascular disease and capillary rarefaction may relate to this decrease in efficiency of sodium excretion. There is experimental evidence that suggests that renal microvascular disease is an important mechanism for inducing salt-sensitive hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kosugi T, Nakagawa T, Kamath D, Johnson RJ |title=Uric acid and hypertension: an age-related relationship? |journal=J Hum Hypertens |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=75–6 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=18754017 |doi=10.1038/jhh.2008.110 |url=}}</ref>

[[Obesity]] can increase the risk of hypertension to fivefold as compared with normal weight, and up to two-thirds of hypertension cases can be attributed to excess weight.<ref name=HaslamJames>{{cite journal |author=Haslam DW, James WP |title=Obesity |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9492 |pages=1197–209 |year=2005 |pmid=16198769 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67483-1}}</ref> More than 85% of cases occur in those with a [[Body mass index]] greater than 25.<ref name=HaslamJames/> A definitive link between obesity and hypertension has been found using animal and clinical studies; from these it has been realized that many mechanisms are potential causes of obesity-induced hypertension. These mechanisms include the activation of the sympathetic nervous system as well as the activation of the renin–angiotensin-aldosterone system.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rahmouni K, Correia ML, Haynes WG, Mark AL |title=Obesity-associated hypertension: new insights into mechanisms |journal=Hypertension |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15583075 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000151325.83008.b4 |url=}}</ref> 

Another risk factor is [[Salt#Health effects|salt (sodium) sensitivity]] which is an environmental factor that has received the greatest attention. Approximately one third of the essential hypertensive population is responsive to sodium intake.<ref>http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jphs/100/5/370/_pdf A Missing Link Between a High Salt Intake and Blood Pressure Increase: Makoto Katori and Masataka Majima,
Department of Pharmacology, Kitasato University School of Medicine,
Kitasato, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan February 8, 2006</ref> When sodium intake exceeds the capacity of the body to excrete it through the kidneys, vascular volume expands secondary to movement of fluids into the intra-vascular compartment. This causes the arterial pressure to rise as the cardiac output increases. Local autoregulatory mechanisms counteract this by increasing vascular resistance to maintain normotension in local vascular beds. As arterial pressure increases in response to high [[sodium chloride]] intake, urinary sodium excretion increases and the excretion of salt is maintained at expense of increased vascular pressures.<ref name="isbn0-07-147691-1"/> The increased sodium ion concentration stimulates [[Vasopressin|ADH]] and thirst mechanisms, leading to increased reabsorption of water in the kidneys, concentrated [[urine]], and thirst with higher intake of water. Also, the water movement between cells and the interstitium plays a minor role compared to this.
The relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure is controversial. Reducing sodium intake does reduce blood pressure, but the magnitude of the effect is insufficient to recommend a general reduction in salt intake.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jürgens G, Graudal NA |title=Effects of low sodium diet versus high sodium diet on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterols, and triglyceride |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004022 |year=2004 |pmid=14974053 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004022.pub2 |editor1-last=Graudal |editor1-first=Niels Albert }}</ref>

[[Renin]] elevation is another risk factor. Renin is an [[enzyme]] secreted by the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] of the kidney and linked with [[aldosterone]] in a negative feedback loop. In consequence, some hypertensive patients have been defined as having low-renin and others as having essential hypertension. Low-renin hypertension is more common in [[African American]]s than [[white American]]s, and may explain why African Americans tend to respond better to diuretic therapy than drugs that interfere with the [[Renin-angiotensin system]].
High renin levels predispose to hypertension by causing sodium retention through the following mechanism: Increased renin → Increased [[angiotensin II]] → Increased [[vasoconstriction]], thirst/[[vasopressin|ADH]] and [[aldosterone]] → Increased [[sodium]] reabsorption in the [[kidney]]s (DCT and CD) → Increased blood pressure.

Hypertension can also be caused by [[Insulin resistance]] and/or [[hyperinsulinemia]], which are components of [[metabolic syndrome|syndrome X]], or the [[metabolic syndrome]]. [[Insulin]] is a polypeptide [[hormone]] secreted by cells in the [[islets of Langerhans]], which are contained throughout the [[pancreas]]. Its main purpose is to regulate the levels of [[glucose]] in the body [[Receptor antagonist|antagonistically]] with [[glucagon]] through [[negative feedback]] loops. Insulin also exhibits vasodilatory properties. In normotensive individuals, insulin may stimulate sympathetic activity without elevating mean arterial pressure. However, in more extreme conditions such as that of the [[metabolic syndrome]], the increased sympathetic neural activity may over-ride the vasodilatory effects of insulin.

It has been suggested that [[hypovitaminosis D|vitamin D deficiency]] is associated with cardiovascular risk factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee JH, O'Keefe JH, Bell D, Hensrud DD, Holick MF |title=Vitamin D deficiency an important, common, and easily treatable cardiovascular risk factor? |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=52 |issue=24 |pages=1949–56 |year=2008  |pmid=19055985 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2008.08.050 }}</ref> It has been observed that individuals with a vitamin D deficiency have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures than average. Vitamin D inhibits renin secretion and its activity, it therefore acts as a "negative endocrine regulator of the renin-angiotensin system". Hence a deficiency in vitamin D leads to an increase in renin secretion. This is one possible mechanism of explaining the observed link between hypertension and vitamin D levels in the [[blood plasma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Forman JP, Giovannucci E, Holmes MD, ''et al.'' |title=Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and risk of incident hypertension |journal=Hypertension |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=1063–9 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17372031 |doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.087288 }}</ref>

Also, some authorities claim that potassium might both prevent and treat hypertension.<ref>{{cite book | title=Fifth Edition Annotated Instructor's Edition Nutrition Concepts & Controversies | author=Eva May Nunnelley Hamilton, M.S., Eleanor Noss Whitney, Ph.d, R.D., Frances Sienkiewicz Sizer, M.S., R.D. |publisher=West Publishing Company |year=1991 |isbn=0-314-81092-7 | oclc=22451334}}</ref>

Recent studies claims that obesity is a risk factor for hypertension because of activation of the [[renin-angiotensin system]] (RAS) in [[adipose tissue]],<ref name="pmid17903324">{{cite journal |author=Segura J, Ruilope LM |title=Obesity, essential hypertension and renin-angiotensin system |journal=[[Public Health Nutrition]] |volume=10 |issue=10A |pages=1151–5 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17903324 |doi=10.1017/S136898000700064X |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S136898000700064X|accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref><ref name="pmid19348224">{{cite journal |author=Hasegawa H, Komuro I |title=[The progress of the study of RAAS] |language=Japanese |journal=[[Nippon Rinsho.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of hypertension}}
[[Image:Arterial pressure diagram.png|thumb|right|500px|A diagram explaining factors affecting [[arterial pressure]]]]
[[Cardiac output]] and [[Total peripheral resistance|peripheral resistance]] are the two determinants of [[arterial pressure]]. and so [[blood pressure]] is normally dependent on the balance between
cardiac output and peripheral resistance.<ref name = KlabundeMAP2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Pressure/BP006.htm |title=Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts - Mean Arterial Pressure |accessdate=2008-09-29 |last=Klabunde |first=Richard E. |year=2007 }}</ref> Cardiac output is determined by [[stroke volume]] and [[heart rate]]; stroke volume is related to [[Contractility|myocardial contractility]] and to the size of the [[Blood vessel|vascular compartment]]. Peripheral resistance is determined by functional and anatomic changes in small [[arteries]] and [[arterioles]].
The pathophysiology of essential hypertension is an area of research, and until now remains not well understood, but many theories have been proposed to explain this.

What is known is that [[cardiac output]] is raised early in the disease course, with [[total peripheral resistance]] (TPR) normal; over time cardiac output drops to normal levels but TPR is increased. Three theories have been proposed to explain this:
* An overactive [[Renin-angiotensin system]] leads to [[vasoconstriction]] and retention of sodium and water. The increase in blood volume leads to hypertension.
* An overactive [[sympathetic nervous system]], leading to increased stress responses.
It is also known that hypertension is highly heritable and [[polygenic]] (caused by more than one gene) and a few candidate [[genes]] have been postulated in the etiology of this condition.<ref name="polymorphism">{{cite journal |author= Sagnella GA, Swift PA |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |title=The Renal Epithelial Sodium Channel: Genetic Heterogeneity and Implications for the Treatment of High Blood Pressure |year = 2006 |month = June |volume = 12 |issue = 14 |pages = 2221–2234 |pmid = 16787251 | doi = 10.2174/138161206777585157}}</ref><ref name="polymorphism2">{{cite journal |author= Johnson JA, Turner ST |journal=Current Opinion in Molecular Therapy |title=Hypertension pharmacogenomics: current status and future directions |year = 2005 |month = June |volume = 7 |issue = 3 |pages = 218–225 |pmid = 15977418}}</ref><ref name="polymorphism3">{{cite journal|author= Hideo Izawa; Yoshiji Yamada et al. |journal=Hypertension |title=Prediction of Genetic Risk for Hypertension |year = 2003 |month = May |volume = 41 |issue = 5 |pages = 1035–1040 |pmid = 12654703 | url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/short/01.HYP.0000065618.56368.24v1 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000065618.56368.24}}</ref>
