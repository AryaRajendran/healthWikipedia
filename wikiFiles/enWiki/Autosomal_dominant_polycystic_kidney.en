'''Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease''' ("ADPKD", "autosomal dominant PKD" or "Adult-onset PKD") is an inherited systemic disorder that predominantly affects the kidneys, but may affect other organs including the liver, pancreas, brain, and arterial blood vessels.  Approximately 50% of people with this disease will develop [[End stage renal disease|end stage kidney disease]] and require [[dialysis]] or [[kidney transplantation]].  Progression to end stage kidney disease usually happens in the 4th to 6th decades of life.<ref name=grantham>{{cite journal | title=Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease | first=Jared  | last=Grantham| journal=New England Journal of Medicine  | date=Oct 2 2008 | volume= 359 | pages=1477–1485 | url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcp0804458 | pmid = | doi=10.1056/NEJMcp0804458}}</ref> Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease occurs worldwide and affects about 1 in 400 to 1 in 1000 people.<ref name=torres>{{cite journal | title=Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: the last 3 years | first=Vicente| last=Torres | journal=Kidney International  | date=20 May 2009 | volume= 76 | pages=149–168 | url=http://www.nature.com/ki/journal/v76/n2/full/ki2009128a.html | pmid = |doi = 10.1038/ki.2009.128|10.1038/ki.2009.128 | issue=2}}</ref><ref name="Dalgaard_1957">{{cite journal |author=DALGAARD OZ |title=Bilateral polycystic disease of the kidneys; a follow-up of two hundred and eighty-four patients and their families |journal=Acta Med.

Defects in two genes are thought to be responsible for ADPKD. In 85% of patients, ADPKD is caused by [[mutation]]s in the [[gene]]  ''[[PKD1]]'' on chromosome 16 (TRPP1); in 15% of patients mutations in ''[[PKD2]]'' (TRPP2) are causative.<ref name=grantham/>

==Pathophysiology==

Recent studies in fundamental cell biology of [[cilia]] and [[flagella]] using experimental [[model organisms]] such as the round worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and the mouse ''[[Mus musculus]]'' have shed light on how PKD develops in human patients.<ref name="calvet">{{cite journal | title=Cilia in PKD—Letting It All Hang Out | first=James P. | last=Calvet | journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology  | date=Oct 2002 | volume=13 | pages=2614–16 | url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/content/full/13/10/2614 | pmid = 12239253 | issue=10}}</ref> 

All [[cilia]] and [[flagella]] are constructed and maintained by the process of [[intraflagellar transport]], a cellular function that is also essential for the insertion of proteins at specific sites along cilia and flagella membranes. These inserted membrane proteins can initiate environmental sensing and intracellular signaling pathways. They play a special role in the cilia of renal epithelial cells, and are thought to be critical for normal renal cell development and function and are sorted out and localized to the cilia of renal epithelial cells by the aforementioned [[intraflagellar transport]] mechanism. Ciliated epithelial cells line the lumen of the urinary collecting ducts and sense the flow of urine. Failure in flow-sensing signaling results in programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) of these renal epithelial cells, producing the characteristic multiple cysts of PKD. PKD may result from mutations of signaling and environmental sensing proteins, or failure in [[intraflagellar transport]].<ref name="yoder">{{cite journal | title=The Polycystic Kidney Disease Proteins, Polycystin-1, Polycystin-2, Polaris, and Cystin, Are Co-Localized in Renal Cilia  | author=Yoder BK, Hou X, Guay-Woodford LM | journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology  | date=Oct 2002 | volume=13 | pages=2508–2516 | url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/content/full/13/10/2508?ijkey=e0e1998129b978c2097e67e9eb70fc0f87fb5810 | doi=10.1097/01.ASN.0000029587.47950.25 | pmid=12239239 | issue=10}}</ref>

[[Image:PKD1PKD2 en.png|thumb|Illustration of PKD1 and PKD2 proteins at the cell membrane.]]

Two PKD genes, ''PKD1'' and ''PKD2'', encode membrane proteins that localize to a non-motile cilium on the renal tube cell. [[Polycystin-2]] encoded by ''PKD2'' gene is a calcium channel that allows extracellular calcium ions to enter the cell. [[Polycystin-1]], encoded by ''PKD1'' gene, is thought to be associated with polycystin-2 protein and regulates polycystin-2's channel activity. The calcium ions are important cellular messengers, which trigger complicated biochemical pathways that lead to quiescence and differentiation. Malfunctions of polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 proteins, defects in the assembly of the cilium on the renal tube cell, failures in targeting these two proteins to the cilium, and deregulations of calcium signaling all likely cause the occurrence of PKD.

==Genetics==

As stated above, defects in two genes are thought to be responsible for ADPKD. In 85% of patients, ADPKD is caused by [[mutation]]s in the [[gene]]  ''[[PKD1]]'' on chromosome 16 (TRPP1); in 15% of patients mutations in ''[[PKD2]]'' (TRPP2) are causative.<ref name=grantham/><ref>First Aid for the USMLE. 2011, pg. 472</ref>

===PKD and the "two hit" hypothesis===

The two hit hypothesis (aka [[Knudson hypothesis]] ) is often used to explain the manifestation of polycystic kidney disease later in life even though the mutation is present at birth.   This term is borrowed from cancer research stating that both copies of the gene present in the genome have to be "silenced" before cancer manifests itself (in Knudson's case the silenced gene was ''Rb1'').  In ADPKD the original "hit" is congenital (in either the ''PKD1'' or ''PKD2'' genes) and the subsequent "hit" occurs later in life as the cells grow and divide.  The two hit hypothesis as it relates to PKD was originally proposed by Reeders in 1992.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reeders ST |title=Multilocus polycystic disease |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=235–7 |year=1992 |pmid=1338768 |doi=10.1038/ng0792-235}}</ref>  Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that ARPKD patients develop disease at birth, and [[Mutation|somatic mutations]] in the "normal" copy of ''PKD1'' or ''PKD2'' have been found in cyst-lining [[epithelia]]

=== Relation to other rare genetic disorders ===

Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related, may be, in fact, highly related in the [[genotype|genetypical]] root cause of the widely-varying, [[phenotype|phenotypically]]-observed [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]].  Thus, PKD is a [[ciliopathy]].  Other known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alstrom syndrome]], [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]], and some forms of [[Retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal

==Diagnosis==
[[File:CT scan autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.jpg|thumb|Abdominal [[CT scan]] of an adult with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Extensive cyst formation is seen over both kidneys, with a few cysts in the liver as well. [[Coronal plane]].]]
A definite diagnosis of ADPKD relies on imaging or molecular [[genetic testing]]. The sensitivity of testing is nearly 100% for all patients with ADPKD who are age 30 years or older and for younger patients with [[PKD1|PKD1 mutations]]; these criteria are only 67% sensitive for patients with [[PKD2|PKD2 mutations]] who are younger than age 30 years. Large [[Radioopaque|echogenic]] kidneys without distinct macroscopic cysts in an infant/child at 50% risk for ADPKD are diagnostic. In the absence of a family history of ADPKD, the presence of bilateral renal enlargement and cysts, with or without the presence of [[hepatic]] cysts, and the absence of other manifestations suggestive of a different renal cystic disease provide presumptive, but not definite, evidence for the diagnosis. 

Molecular [[genetic testing]] by [[linkage analysis]] or direct mutation screening is available clinically; however, genetic heterogeneity is a significant complication to molecular [[genetic testing]]. Sometimes a relatively large number of affected family members need to be tested in order to establish which one of the two possible genes is responsible within each family. The large size and complexity of [[PKD1]] and [[PKD2]] [[gene]]s, as well as marked [[allelic heterogeneity]], present obstacles to molecular testing by direct [[DNA analysis]]. In the research setting, [[mutation]] detection rates of 50-75% have been obtained for [[PKD1]] and ~75% for [[PKD2]]. Clinical testing of the  [[PKD1]] and  [[PKD2]] genes by direct [[sequence analysis]] is now available, with a detection rate for disease-causing mutations of 50-70%.

[[Genetic counseling]] may be helpful for families at risk for polycystic kidney disease.

==Treatment==
Although a cure for PKD is not available, treatment can ease the symptoms and prolong life.

* [[Pain]]: Over-the-counter pain medications, such as [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) can relieve pain. For most but not all cases of severe pain, surgery to shrink cysts can relieve pain in the back and flanks. However, surgery provides only temporary relief and usually does not slow the disease's progression toward [[kidney failure]].

* [[Urinary tract infection]]s: Patients with PKD tend to have frequent urinary tract infections, which can be treated with [[antibiotic]]s. Early treatment is important, because infection can spread from the urinary tract to the cysts in the kidneys. Cyst infections are difficult to treat because many antibiotics do not penetrate into the cysts. However, some antibiotics are effective.

* [[High blood pressure]]: Keeping blood pressure under control can slow the effects of PKD. Lifestyle changes including low salt diet and various medications especially ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can lower high blood pressure. Recommended target BP in these patients is 130/80&nbsp;mm Hg or lower.

*[[Chronic Kidney Disease Progression]]: A very exciting new development in ADPKD treatment involves the use of Tolvaptan, a selective vasopressin antagonist, and research shows that this compound may limit cyst growth, reduce symptoms and most importantly, delay the progression of chronic kidney disease.<ref>[http://ukidney.com/blog/general-nephrology/tolvaptan-in-polycystic-kidney-disease-adpkd-the-most-exciting-nephrology-development-in-years UKidney - Internet School of Nephrology: Tolvaptan]</ref>

* [[End-stage renal disease]]: There are two options for replacing kidney functions: [[dialysis]] or [[Kidney transplant|transplantation]]. Healthy (non-PKD) kidneys transplanted into PKD patients do not develop cysts.<ref>http://transplant.surgery.ucsf.edu/conditions--procedures/polycystic-kidney-disease.aspx</ref>

==Prognosis==
Despite significant research, prognosis of this disease has changed little over time. It is suggested that avoidance of [[caffeine]] may prevent cyst formation. Although not well-proven, treatment of hypertension and a low protein diet may slow progression of the disease.

Between PKD1 and PKD2, the former has the worse prognosis.
