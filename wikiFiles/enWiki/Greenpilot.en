The online portal '''Greenpilot''' is a service provided by the German National Library of Medicine, ZB MED.

The project is funded by the German Research Foundation ([[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]) and gets its technical support from  Averbis Ltd. The portal first went online May 29, 2009 and currently runs in the updated beta version. In the context of the 'Germany - Land of Ideas' (Deutschland - Land der Ideen) initiative under the patronage of the [[President of Germany]] [[Horst Köhler]] the ZB MED was awarded the distinction 'Selected Landmark 2009' (Ausgewählter Ort 2009).<ref>[http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news315583 Pressemitteilung im Informationsdienst Wissenschaft vom 15. Mai 2009 ]</ref>

==Objective==
The Greenpilot portal is a [[digital library]] specialised in the fields of Nutritional, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. It aims to provide researchers in the three fields with a collection of scientific literature which is easy to access and of high quality. Especially the [[gray literature]] is often difficult to find and retrieve for the average user so Greenpilot also aims to make access to these sources easier. The service addresses itself not only to scientists and students but also to the broadly interested public. Greenpilot has been modelled after the corresponding digital library for Medicine, Medpilot,<ref>[http://www.medpilot.de/ Medpilot portal]</ref> also a project of the German National Library of Medicine. The ZB MED has chosen the slogan 'Greenpilot - all about life and science' as a motto. In Greenpilot scientifically relevant databases, library catalogues and websites can be searched by entering a search term and the results are presented in a standardised web interface.

==Technical Background==
Greenpilot is a search engine based on intuitive search engine technology. The portal's software was developed in the programming language [[Perl]]. The search engine technology is based upon the 'Averbis Search Platform' software developed by the Averbis Ltd. and uses the [[open source]] software [[Lucene]]. Functionally this is an expert search engine which centres around the intelligent semantic connection of search terms by means of a standardised vocabulary. This is made possible by Averbis's MSI software which provides:

* semantic search optimised for the fields of Medicine and Life Sciences
* a contextual analysis of texts taking synonyms and compounds into account
* multilingual and cross-language search
* linking of lay and expert vocabulary
The search results are generated from a search index.

Additionally a [[metasearch]] can be conducted in order to search other databases not contained in the index. This search is based upon individual results from the specific database searched.

==Contents==
The Greenpilot portal integrates various scientifically relevant information resources under a uniform search interface. These resources are diverse and encompass national and international expert databases, library catalogues of national libraries with a focus on specific topics, full text documents from [[open access (publishing)|open access]] journals as well as information contained on about one thousand scientifically relevant websites selected for Greenpilot.
