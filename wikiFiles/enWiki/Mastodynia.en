'''Mastodynia''', '''mastalgia''' (from the Greek ''masto-'', breast and ''algos'', pain) or '''mammalgia''' is the medical symptom of breast [[pain]].

Pain can range from minor discomfort to severely incapacitating pain. Many women are more worried about a possible cancer risk than about the pain{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. 

Breast pain during lactation or after weaning is not included into this definition but usually classified as [[breast engorgement]] or [[puerperal mastitis|mastitis]].

==Types==
It can be classified into 2 main clinical patterns:
* '''cyclical''' when the pain intensity is changing during the [[menstrual cycle]].
* '''non-cyclical''' when the pain remains essentially unchanged during the menstrual cycle. This type  is less frequent.

==Causes==
'''Cyclical breast pain''' (cyclical mastalgia) is very often associated with [[fibrocystic breast changes]] or [[duct ectasia]] and believed to be caused by aberrations in dynamic hormonal changes mainly involving prolactin response to [[thyrotropin]].<ref>{{cite pmid|3922866}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|2696218}}</ref> Some degree of cyclical breast tenderness is normal in the menstrual cycle, and is usually associated with [[menstruation]] and/or [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS).<ref name=medlineplus>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003152.htm medlineplus > Breast pain] By the U.S. National Library of Medicine, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health. Page last updated: 25 January 2011</ref>

'''Noncyclical breast pain''' has various causes and is harder to diagnose. Noncyclical pain has frequently its root cause outside the breast. Some degree of non-cyclical breast tenderness can normally be present due to hormonal changes in [[puberty]] (both in girls and boys), in [[menopause]] and during [[pregnancy]].<ref name=medlineplus/> After pregnancy, breast pain can be caused by [[breastfeeding]].<ref name=medlineplus/> Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include [[alcoholism]] with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), [[mastitis]] and medications such as [[digitalis]], [[methyldopa]] (an [[antihypertensive]]), [[spironolactone]], certain [[diuretic]]s, [[oxymetholone]] (an [[anabolic steroid]]), and [[chlorpromazine]] (a [[typical antipsychotic]]).<ref name=medlineplus/> Also, [[shingles]] can cause a painful blistering rash on the skin of the breasts.<ref name=medlineplus/>

==Treatments for cyclical breast pain==
While in many cases it would possible to predict which treatment will be most effective with a series of endocrinological investigations involving [[thyroid]] and complicated pituitary hormone testing,<ref name=Rea_1997>{{cite pmid|9433398}}</ref> this is rarely done in practice.

Treatments which demonstrated some effectiveness:
* [[Vitex agnus-castus]] extract: there is convincing evidence that Vitex agnus castus is safe and efficient in the treatment of cyclical mastalgia. It is assumed, that like bromocriptine it works by reducing prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland.<ref name="Carmichael_2008">{{cite pmid|18830450}}</ref>
* Topical and systemic [[NSAID]]s, [[analgesic]]s
* [[Progestin]] based birth control pills or topical [[progesterone]] application. This method is effective only in a minority of women but is often tried because of its well known safety profile. Cyclic progestin on days 14-25 did show promising results.<ref>{{cite pmid|12227885}}</ref>
* [[Dopamine agonist]]s, best results with a better side effect profile than bromocriptine can be achieved with [[Dostinex]]. The older [[bromocriptine]] has been found very efficient with relatively good safety, is however associated with many unpleasant adverse side effects.<ref name="Mansel_1990">{{cite pmid|1967667}}</ref> There is very little although promising data on [[lisuride]]<ref name="Kaleli_2001">{{cite pmid|11287025}}</ref> and [[quinagolide]].<ref name=Mouzaka_1999>{{cite pmid|10376428}}</ref>
* 
* [[Iodine]]: supplementation with supraphysiologic levels of iodine has been shown effective in the treatment of breast pain. Not yet widely recommended until the long term effects of supraphysiologic doses of iodine on [[thyroid]] health are better understood.<ref>{{cite pmid|15239792}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid| 18590348}}</ref>
* [[Danazol]]: very low dose danazol treatment has been found very efficient with modest side effects. The lowest dose tested in one trial produced the most favorable long term results and was associated with least adverse effects.<ref name="Mossa_1989">{{cite pmid|2622587}}</ref>
* Thyroid hormone supplementation, especially when [[hypothyroidism]] or subclinical hypothyroidism has been diagnosed. However even [[levothyroxin]] supplementation in normal patients has been shown effective.<ref>{{cite pmid|7316045}}</ref>
* [[Tamoxifen]] has been shown effective but is very rarely used because of serious concerns about safety in premenopausal women.
* [[Ormeloxifene]], a [[SERM]] showed some effectivity in treatment of [[mastalgia]] and [[fibroadenoma]].<ref name=Dhar_2007>{{cite pmid|17431715}}</ref>
* [[Anthocyanins]] from [[bilberry]].<ref>{{cite pmid|8139788}}</ref>

==Treatments for non-cyclical breast pain==

Determining the appropriate treatment for noncyclical breast pain is more difficult, not only because it is hard to pinpoint where the pain is coming from, but also because the pain may not have hormonal causes and very often does not respond to hormonal treatment.

==Breast cancer risk==

The great majority of [[breast cancer]] cases do not present with symptoms of pain. Some epidemiological investigations suggest that women with symptoms of breast pain may have an increased risk of subsequently developing breast cancer and risk increases with duration of symptoms.<ref>{{cite pmid|16775187}}</ref> This is consistent with the observation that a few special subtypes of [[fibrocystic breast changes]] exhibit increased breast cancer risk â€“ see [[fibrocystic breast changes#Breast cancer risk|breast cancer risk of fibrocystic breast changes]].
