[[File:Safesmokes.jpg|300px|thumb|Electronic cigarette resembling a tobacco cigarette.]]

An '''electronic cigarette''', also known as an '''e-cigarette''', '''personal vaporizer''' or '''PV''', is an [[Electronics|electronic]] inhaler that vaporizes a liquid solution into an [[aerosol]] mist, simulating the act of [[tobacco smoking]]. Electronic cigarettes are no longer marketed as [[smoking cessation]] aids or tobacco replacement in most countries. There may be similarities between conventional and some electronic cigarettes in the physical design and the [[nicotine]] release, which may approximate the same amount of nicotine as a conventional cigarette. There are many electronic cigarettes which do not resemble conventional cigarettes at all. The amount of nicotine contained can be chosen by the user, with some choosing no nicotine at all.

The  benefits and risks of electronic cigarette use are uncertain among health organizations and researchers. Limited [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled studies]] are available due to its recent invention. Laws vary widely concerning the use and sale of electronic cigarettes and accompanying liquid solutions, with pending [[legislation]] and ongoing debate.

==History==

The earliest electronic cigarette can be traced to Herbert A. Gilbert,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=RjlUAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4&source=gbs_overview_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Smokeless non-tobacco cigarette |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> who in 1963 patented a device described as "a smokeless non-tobacco cigarette" that involved "replacing burning tobacco and paper with heated, moist, flavored air." This device heated the nicotine solution and produced steam. In 1967, Gilbert was approached by several companies interested in manufacturing it, but it was never commercialized and disappeared from the public record after 1967.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Waterloo Daily Courier - Waterloo, Iowa|date=24 August 1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Titusville Herald - Titusville, Pennsylvania|date=29 July 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=New Castle News -New Castle, Pennsylvania|date=28 July 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Simpson's Leader-Times  - Kittanning, Pennsylvania|date=28 July 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Altoona Mirror - Altoona, Pennsylvania|date=28 July 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Progress, The, Clearfield, Pennsylvania|date=31 July 1967}}</ref>

Hon Lik, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] pharmacist, is widely credited<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/25/world/fg-china-cigarettes25 A high-tech approach to getting a nicotine fix], Los Angeles Times</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111578997  E-Cigarettes: The New Frontier In War On Smoking], NPR</ref><ref>[http://www.whoinventedit.net/who-invented-the-electronic-cigarette.html Who Invented the Electronic Cigarette?], Whoinventedit.net</ref> with the invention of the first generation electronic cigarette.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hon Lik – 2010 Kcancer Hero Nominee|url=http://www.prlog.org/10588774-hon-lik-2010-kcancer-hero-nominee.html}}</ref> In 2000, he came up with the idea of using a [[piezoelectric]] [[ultrasound]]-emitting element to vaporize a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a [[propylene glycol]] solution.<ref name=wiki>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikipatents.com/CA-Patent-2518174/a-non-smokable-electronic-spray-cigarette|title=CA Patent 2518174 - A NON-SMOKABLE ELECTRONIC SPRAY CIGARETTE|publisher=WikiPatents|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> This design produces a smoke-like vapor that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece. These inventions are the basis of the present-day electronic cigarettes.  

The device was first introduced to the Chinese domestic market in May 2004 as an aid for smoking cessation and replacement. The company that Hon Lik worked for, Golden Dragon Holdings, changed its name to [[Ruyan]] (如烟, literally "Resembling smoking"), and started exporting its products in 2005–2006<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/25/world/fg-china-cigarettes25 A high-tech approach to getting a nicotine fix], 25 April 2009, ''Los Angeles Times''</ref> before receiving its first international patent in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&NR=2007267031&KC=&FT=E&locale=en_EP |title=Electronic Atomizer Cigarette European patent |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |date=22 November 2007 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

The second generation electronic cigarette, or modern electronic cigarette, was invented and introduced to market in 2008 by Dr. Yunqiang Xiu before receiving its international patents in 2009 & UK patent in 2011.<ref>Electronic simulated cigarette and atomizing liquid thereof, smoking set for electronic simulated cigarette and smoking liquid capsule thereof;</ref> The modern electronic cigarette featured the "tankomizer" (or sealed tank system and sealed atomizer technology). This is more useful for pharmaceutical and medical devices industries.

Core technology covering integrated vaporization, more commonly known as "cartomizer technology", was invented and bought to market by British entrepeneurs, Tariq and Umer Sheikh in 2008. Their technology is used in the Gamucci brand, and their UK patent was granted in February 2013.<ref> Gamucci UK Patent http://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2465247</ref>

==Components==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
[[File:Components of a MiniCiggy e-cigarette.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A disassembled cigarette-styled electronic cigarette.<br />A. [[LED]] light cover<br />B. [[battery (electricity)|battery]] (also houses circuitry)<br />C. atomizer (heating element)<br />D. cartridge (mouthpiece)]]

An electronic cigarette contains three essential components: a plastic cartridge that serves as a mouthpiece and a reservoir for liquid, an "atomizer" that vaporizes the liquid, and a battery.

===Cartridge===

The cartridge, a small plastic container with openings at each end, serves as both a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece. It allows the passage of liquid into the atomizer, and vapor from the atomizer to the user's mouth, without any leakage of liquid into the mouth.

Most models utilise a plastic sponge to keep the liquid in place, but it is common to find a refillable tank that holds the liquid, with a separate tunnel connecting to the atomizer. When the liquid is depleted, users can refill it or replace with another pre-filled cartridge. Some users forgo liquid reservoirs and drip liquid directly onto the atomizer in a method known as "dripping".

A single cartridge can be the equivalent of 20 cigarettes.
<ref name=wiki />

===Atomizer===
[[File:Ecig usb charger.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A battery connected to a USB charger]]

The atomizer contains a small heating coil that vaporizes the liquid, and generally consists of a simple filament and [[wicking]] metal mesh or silica wick to draw the liquid in. It is positioned in the center of the three components that make up the entire electronic cigarette cylinder: the cartridge attaches to one end, and the power unit to the other. The atomizer's filament will lose efficiency over time due to a build-up of sediment, or it "burns out" entirely, requiring replacement. In some models, the cartridge and atomizer component are integrated into what is known as a ''cartomizer''.

===Cartomizer===
The term ''cartomizer'' describes the combination of atomizer and cartridge in the same unit.  A cartomizer consists of a heating element surrounded by a poly-foam soaked in the liquid.  This combination is mainly used in the devices that are manufactured to look like cigarettes, and is covered by Gamucci's patent. <ref>Gamucci UK Patent http://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2465247</ref>

===Battery===
Most portable power units contain a [[lithium-ion]] [[rechargeable battery]] which makes up the largest component of an electronic cigarette. The battery may contain an electronic airflow sensor: activation is triggered simply by drawing breath through the device. Other models come with a power switch, which must be held during operation. A [[light-emitting diode|LED]] to announce activation may also be equipped in the front of the power unit casing.

How long a battery lasts will depend on its current capacity (in mAh), which ranges from 100 mAh for smaller batteries, to over 1000 mAh for larger ones. E-cigarette performance also depends on the battery's voltage, which typically ranges from 3.2V to 4.2V.  Some variable voltage devices will offer voltages as high as 7V<ref name="Electronic Cigarette or Personal Vaporizer?">E-Cigarette-Review.net, viewed 17 April 2013 [http://e-cigarette-review.net/electronic-cigarette-or-personal-vaporizer/ Electronic Cigarettes and Personal Vaporizers] www.e-cigarette-review.net</ref>. USB e-cigarettes do not run on a battery and instead supply a constant voltage of 5V using a computer USB port as the power source.

E-cigarette batteries can have different threading that make them compatible only with cartridges of the same threading. The most common types of threading are: KR808D-1 (E8), KR808D-2 (E9), 510, DSE103 and L88B.<ref name="E-Cigarette Compatibility Chart">E-Cig-Review.net, viewed 12 March 2013 [http://e-cig-review.net/e-cigarette-compatibility-chart/ Electronic Cigarette Compatibility Chart] www.e-cig-review.net</ref>

Batteries are usually charged via an AC outlet, car charger socket or USB. Some manufacturers also offer a cigarette pack-like portable charging case (PCC), which contains a larger battery to charge smaller batteries of individual e-cigarettes.

===Liquid===
Liquid for producing vapor in electronic cigarettes, known as e-juice or e-liquid, is a solution of [[propylene glycol]] (PG) and/or vegetable [[glycerin]] (VG) and/or [[PEG 400|polyethylene glycol 400]] (PEG400) mixed with concentrated flavors, and optionally, a variable percentage of a liquid nicotine concentrate.

The solution is often sold in a bottle or contained in pre-filled disposable cartridges. Many manufacturers offer dozens of flavors which resemble the taste of regular tobacco, [[menthol cigarette|menthol]], [[vanilla]], [[coffee]], [[cola]] and various [[fruit]]s, but nicotine concentrations vary by manufacturer. The standard notation "mg/ml" is often used in labelling, sometimes shortened to a simple "mg" (milligram).<ref name="Health New Zealand">{{cite web |url=http://www.healthnz.co.nz/Ruyan_ecigarette.htm |author=Health New Zealand|title=The Ruyan e-cigarette; Technical Information Sheet]|publisher=Health New Zealand|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=31 March 2008}}</ref> Nicotine-free solutions are also common.

Some electronic cigarette users prefer to make their own e-juice in a form known as "[[DIY]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=E-cigarette forum|url=http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/diy-e-liquid/|accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref>

===Kits===
There are dozens of e-cigarette models which are sold online and in stores, all under hundreds of different brand names. Most electronic cigarette users initially purchase starter kits that contain a battery, USB charger and a selection of cartomizers (cartridges). Some kits also include a portable charging case (PCC).

===Mods===
The advanced techology in the mod batteries allows the user to experiment with different voltages and/or wattages. Changing the volts/watts of a battery to increase its power output causes the flavour to burn at a hotter rate, which in turn can help with the overall taste. Mod batteries are not for the beginner; they require some background knowledge in [[Ohm's_law|Ohm's law]]. Once understood, the mod battery opens up a whole new area of vaping.  Popular mod batteries include the ProVari and the Vamo. Both come with built-in safety features that prevent the battery from shorting out.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vaping Cobra Electronic Cigarettes|url=http://vapingcobra.com.au/electronic-cigarettes/|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>

==Health concerns==
Proponents of electronic cigarettes often claim that electronic cigarettes deliver the experience of smoking while eliminating the smell and health risks associated with tobacco smoke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutelyecigs.com/blog/e-cigarette-excellent-subsitute-tobacco-cigarettes/|title=E-Cigarette – An Excellent Subsitute to Tobacco Cigarettes|date=25 January 2012|publisher=AbsolutelyeCigs.com|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Smoking and cancer: What's in a cigarette?|url=http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/healthyliving/smokingandtobacco/whatsinacigarette/smoking-and-cancer-whats-in-a-cigarette|publisher=Cancer Research UK|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> The base liquids - which include [[propylene glycol]] (PG), [[Glycerol|vegetable glycerin]] (VG), and sometimes polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) - have been widely used as a food additive, as a base solution for personal care products such as toothpaste, and in medical devices such as [[asthma inhaler]]s. However, the health effects of inhaling nicotine vapor into lungs are a subject of uncertainty.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The fact that e-cigarettes may resemble real tobacco cigarettes has been noted by both supporters and detractors. While e-cigarettes may give nicotine addicts more or less the same amount of nicotine as a conventional cigarette, they do not produce the same toxic smoke that can cause lung disease and cancer when inhaled over time. Since there are no products of combustion to be inhaled, no tobacco toxins are inhaled besides nicotine.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Deadly Crusade Against E-cigarettes|url=http://www.american.com/archive/2012/november/the-deadly-crusade-against-e-cigarettes|publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]]|accessdate=18 November 2012|author=Gilbert Ross, M.D.|date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

===World Health Organization===

The [[World Health Organization]] stated in September 2008 that no rigorous, peer-reviewed studies have been conducted showing that the electronic cigarette is a safe and effective [[nicotine replacement therapy]]. WHO does not discount the possibility that the electronic cigarette could be useful as a smoking cessation aid, but insisted that claims that electronic cigarettes can help smokers quit need to be backed up by clinical studies and toxicity analyses and operate within the proper regulatory framework.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2008/pr34/en/index.html WHO | Marketers of electronic cigarettes should halt unproved therapy claims].

=== Food and Drug Administration===

In May 2009, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (USFDA) Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis tested 19 varieties of electronic cigarette cartridges produced by two vendors NJOY and Smoking Everywhere.<ref name="Zezima">{{Cite news|last=Zezima|first=Katie|title= Analysis Finds Toxic Substances in Electronic Cigarettes|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/health/policy/23fda.html |accessdate=04 26 2010 | work=The New York Times | date=23 July 2009}}</ref> [[Diethylene glycol]], a poisonous and [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] liquid, was detected in one of the cartridges manufactured by Smoking Everywhere .<ref name="Zezima"/> [[Tobacco-specific nitrosamines]] (TSNAs), known cancer-causing agents, were detected in all of the cartridges from one brand and two of the cartridges from the other brand.

In July 2009, the FDA publicly discouraged the use of electronic cigarettes and raised concerns that electronic cigarettes may be marketed to young people and lack appropriate health warnings.<ref name="FDA warning">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm173222.htm|author=FDA|title=FDA and Public Health Experts Warn About Electronic Cigarettes|publisher=Food and Drug Administration (US)|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> 

The Electronic Cigarette Association criticized the FDA testing as too "narrow to reach any valid and reliable conclusions."<ref name="Zezima"/> [[Exponent (consulting firm)|Exponent, Inc.]], commissioned by NJOY to review the FDA's study in July 2009, objected to the FDA analysis of electronic cigarettes lacking comparisons to other FDA-approved [[nicotine replacement therapy]] products where similar levels of TSNA were detected.

Furthermore, FDA methods "have been lambasted in journals" by some medical and health research experts who noted that potentially harmful chemicals were measured at "about one million times lower concentrations than are conceivably related to human health."<ref name="Tool to Quit Smoking">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/science/e-cigarettes-help-smokers-quit-but-they-have-some-unlikely-critics.html|author=John Tierney|title=A Tool to Quit Smoking Has Some Unlikely Critics|work=[[New York Times]]|date=7 November 2011|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref>

Additionally, The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee of the FDA is alleged to have several members who maintain consulting relationships with various pharmaceutical companies who manufacture smoking cessation products. If these allegations are true, this might represent a potential conflict of interest.<ref>http://cei.org/op-eds-articles/alleged-conflict-interest-fda-tobacco-panel</ref>

===American Association of Public Health Physicians===

As of April 2010, The [[American Association of Public Health Physicians]] (AAPHP) supports electronic cigarettes sales to adults "because the possibility exists to save the lives of four million of the eight million current adult American smokers who will otherwise die of a tobacco-related illness over the next twenty years." However, the AAPHP is against sales to minors.<ref>[http://www.aaphp.org/Resources/Documents/20100402AAPHPEcigLegisStatemnt.pdf AAPHP Statement re State Regulation of E-cigarettes] Retrieved 3 December 2011.</ref> The AAPHP recommends that the FDA reclassify the electronic cigarette as a tobacco product (as opposed to a drug/device combination).<ref>[http://www.aaphp.org/Resources/Documents/20100207FDAPetitionSummary.pdf AAPHP E-cigarette Petitions to FDA –Actions Requested and Justification.] Retrieved 3 December 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.aaphp.org/Resources/Documents/20100207FDAPetition2.pdf "Tobacco Control Task Force"] AAPHP (7 February 2009).

===Boston University School of Public Health study===

A study by researchers at the [[Boston University School of Public Health]] in 2010 concluded that electronic cigarettes were safer than real cigarettes and may aid in breaking the habit of smoking. Researchers said that while further studies on electronic cigarettes were needed, "few, if any, chemicals at levels detected in electronic cigarettes raise serious health concerns." Electronic cigarettes were found to be "much safer" than traditional tobacco ones, and had a level of toxicity similar to existing nicotine replacements.<ref name="physorg1">{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-evidence-e-cigs-safer-cigarettes.html |title=Evidence suggests ecigs safer than cigarettes, researcher claims |publisher=Physorg.com |date= |accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/news/e-ciggies-much-safer-than-real-ones-study-news-health-kmrmajgggbi.html |title=E- ciggies much safer than real ones: Study |publisher=Sify.com |date= |accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref><ref name= Siegel>{{cite web

According to this report, the level of carcinogens in electronic cigarettes is up to 1,000 times lower than regular cigarettes, and early evidence shows that electronic cigarettes may help people to stop smoking by simulating a tobacco cigarette.<ref name="physorg1"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Health Canada===

On 27 March 2009, [[Health Canada]] issued an advisory against electronic cigarettes. The advisory stated, "Although these electronic smoking products may be marketed as a safer alternative to conventional tobacco products and, in some cases, as an aid to quitting smoking, electronic smoking products may pose risks such as [[nicotine poisoning]] and [[addiction]]."<ref name="Health Canada" /> Canadian Customs now confiscate any parcel containing e-cigarettes with nicotine and notify the receiving party via a mail letter. The parcel is returned to the sender only at the request of the receiving party or otherwise destroyed.<ref name="Electronic Cigarettes Containing Nicotine in Canada">E-Cigarette-Review.net, viewed 12 March 2013 [http://e-cigarette-review.net/what-happens-when-you-order-a-e-cigarette-with-nicotine-in-canada/ What happens when you order a e-cigarette with nicotine in Canada] www.e-cigarette-review.net</ref>

===Health New Zealand===

In 2008, Dr. Murray Laugesen of Health New Zealand Ltd. published a report on the safety of Ruyan electronic cigarette cartridges. His study was funded by e-cigarette manufacturer Ruyan, but Laugesen claims that his research is independent.<ref name="Thomson">{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Helen|authorlink=Helen Thomson|title=iSmoke|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/drugs-society-tobacco/15096182-1.html|date=14 February 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref> The presence of trace amounts of [[Tobacco-specific nitrosamines|TSNAs]] in the cartridge solution was documented in the analysis.

===Other reports===
Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos of the [[Alexander S. Onassis Foundation|Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center]] in Athens reported to the annual meeting of the [[European Society of Cardiology]] that a small short-term trial had shown significantly better cardiac performance of ecigarette smokers in comparison to tobacco smokers. Farsalinos warned that larger studies were required to measure the long-term health impact of ecigarettes, but expressed some optimism: "Considering the extreme hazards associated with cigarette smoking, currently available data suggest that electronic cigarettes are far less harmful and substituting tobacco with electronic cigarettes may be beneficial to health." Another small study, also in Greece, reported earlier in 2012 the devices had little short-term impact on lung function.<ref name="Reuters - Greek study finds e-cigarettes no threat to heart">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/25/us-heart-ecigarettes-idUSBRE87O05Y20120825|author=Ben Hirschler|publisher=Reuters|title=Greek study finds e-cigarettes no threat to heart|date=24 August 2012|location=Munich}}</ref>

While electronic cigarettes may deliver nicotine to the user in a manner similar to that of a nicotine inhaler, no electronic cigarette has yet been approved as a medicinal [[nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT) product or subjected to the necessary clinical testing for such approval. Doubts have even been raised as to whether electronic cigarettes actually deliver any substantial amount of nicotine.<ref name="CNN: E-Cigarettes Don't Deliver">{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/08/e.cigarette/index.html|author=Paul Courson|publisher=CNN|title=E-Cigarettes Don't Deliver|date=9 February 2010}}</ref>

Research carried out at the [[University of East London]] on the effects of using an electronic cigarette to reduce cravings in regular tobacco smokers showed that there was no significant reported difference between smokers who inhaled vapour containing nicotine and those who inhaled a placebo vapour containing no nicotine. The report concluded that although electronic cigarettes can be effective in reducing nicotine-related withdrawal symptoms, the nicotine content does not appear to be of central importance, and other smoking related cues (such as taste or vapour resembling smoke) may account for the reduction in discomfort associated with tobacco abstinence in the short term.<ref name="The Electronic Cigarette: Acute Effects on Mood and Craving">{{Cite web | url=http://www.theelectroniccigarette.co.uk/images/pictures/pdf-reports/ecig_poster.pdf | author=Dawkins L, Kent T, Turner J | title=The Electronic Cigarette: Acute Effects on Mood and Craving | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Trace amounts of '[[volatile organic compound]]s', namely [[formaldehyde]], as well as traces of [[ketone]]s, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and tetramethylpyrazine, have been found in electronic cigarette vapour, but the quantities are significantly smaller than the quantities found in tobacco smoke and do not pose a significant health risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tobaccoanalysis.blogspot.co.uk |title=Tobacco analysis}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthnz.co.nz/ElectronicCigsDarwinOct09.pdf |title=E cigarette toxicants}}</ref>

==Usage==

In the United States as of 2011 about one in five adults who smoke have tried electronic cigarettes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0228_electronic_cigarettes.html|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=CDC Newsroom|date=28 February 2013}}</ref>

==Legal history==

Because of the relative novelty of the technology and the possible relationship to tobacco laws and medical drug policies, electronic cigarette legislation and public health investigations are currently pending in many countries. As flavored tobacco cigarettes (except menthol) have been banned in the US, and roll-your-own (RYO) products are seeing massive increases in taxes (e.g., Iowa), electronic cigarettes remain a viable alternative to tobacco for many Americans.

===European Union===

The EU Directive 2001/95/EC(6) on general product safety, applies in so far as there are no specific provisions with the same objective in other EU law. This directive provides for restrictive or preventive measures to be taken if the product is found to be dangerous to the health and safety of consumers.

Whether electronic cigarettes could be regarded as falling under Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices depends on the claimed intended use and whether this intended use has a medical purpose. "It is for each national authority to decide, account being taken of all the characteristics of the product, whether it falls within the definition of a medicinal product by its function or presentation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_determinants/life_style/Tobacco/Documents/orientation_0508_en.pdf |title=Orientation Note: Electronic Cigarettes and the EC Legislation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref>

Because of this vague EU position, member countries in the [[European Economic Area]] currently have varying rules.

===United States===

Individual states have differing legal treatment of electronic cigarettes. 

On 22 September 2009, under the authorization of the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]], the FDA banned flavored tobacco (with the notable exception of menthol cigarettes) due to its potential appeal to children.<ref name="U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2010">{{cite web| last=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |first= |title= Flavored Tobacco| date=15 January 2010| url=http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/ProtectingKidsfromTobacco/FlavoredTobacco/default.htm}}</ref> Wagner says that the use of flavorings, such as chocolate, could encourage childhood use and serve as a [[gateway drug theory|gateway]] to cigarette smoking.<ref name="U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2010"/>

The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) classified electronic cigarettes as drug delivery devices and subject to regulation under the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FDCA) prior to importation to and sale in the United States. The classification was challenged in court, and overruled in January 2010 by Federal District Court Judge [[Richard J. Leon]], citing that "the devices should be regulated as tobacco products rather than drug or medical products."<ref name="AAPF NEWS NOW">{{Cite news|url=http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news-now/health-of-the-public/20100302e-cig-fda.html|title=FDA Fighting for Authority to Regulate Electronic Cigarette|date=2 March 2010}}</ref>  Judge Leon ordered the FDA to stop blocking the importation of electronic cigarettes from China and indicated that the devices should be regulated as tobacco products rather than drug or medical devices.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/business/15smoke.html | work=The New York Times | first=Duff | last=Wilson | title=Judge Orders F.D.A. to Stop Blocking Imports of E-Cigarettes From China | date=15 January 2010}}</ref> 

In March 2010, a US Court of Appeal [[stay of execution|stayed]] the injunction pending an appeal, during which the FDA argued the right to regulate electronic cigarettes based on their previous ability to regulate [[nicotine]] replacement therapies such as [[nicotine gum]] or patches. Further, the agency argued that tobacco legislation enacted the previous year "expressly excludes from the definition of 'tobacco product' any article that is a drug, device or combination product under the FDCA, and provides that such articles shall be subject to regulation under the pre-existing FDCA provisions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news/news-now/health-of-the-public/20100302e-cig-fda.html |title=AAFP.org |publisher=AAFP.org |date= |accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref> On 7 December 2010, the appeals court ruled against the FDA in a 3–0 unanimous decision, ruling the FDA can only regulate electronic cigarettes as tobacco products, and thus cannot block their import.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2010/12/08/fda-block-e-cigarette-imports-court/|title=FDA Cannot Block E-Cigarette Imports: Court|date=8 December 2010 | work=Fox News}}</ref> The judges ruled that such devices would only be subject to drug legislation if they are marketed for therapeutic use – E-cigarette manufacturers had successfully proven that their products were targeted at smokers and not at those seeking to quit. The District of Columbia Circuit appeals court declined to review the decision blocking the products from FDA regulation as medical devices on 24 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2011/02/14/gvsb0214.htm|author=FDA|title=FDA regulation of e-cigarettes rebuffed again|work=American Medical News|date=14 February 2011|accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref>

Concerns about [[public safety]] have been raised. However, some former smokers say they have been helped by e-cigarettes, and scientists at the University of California, Berkeley said that e-cigarettes had great potential for reducing the [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] related to smoking.<ref>Claire Bates (26 January 2011).

=== The European Economic Area ===

* In [[Austria]] nicotine-containing cartridges are classified as medicinal products and e-cigarettes for nicotine inhalation as medical devices.<ref name="Austrian decision">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927004603/http://www.ages.at/web/ages/content.nsf/73b5f92ac245b957c1256a9a004e1676/01c733ea28c3c964c12572bf0051dc7e/$FILE/070427_BASG_Nikotininhalatoren_Information.pdf|title=Abgrenzungsbeirat gemäß § 49a AMG BMGFJ-Information betreffend elektrisch betriebene Nikotininhalatoren, insbesondere RUYAN|publisher= Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety|date= 18 April 2007|accessdate =  21 September 2011|format=PDF 29 KB}}</ref>
* In the [[Czech Republic]], the use, sale and advertising of electronic cigarettes is legal.
* In [[Denmark]], the Danish Medicines Agency classifies electronic cigarettes containing nicotine as medicinal products. Thus, authorization is required before the product may be marketed and sold, and no such authorization has currently been given. The agency has clarified, however, that electronic cigarettes that do not administer nicotine to the user, and are not otherwise used for the prevention or treatment of disease, are not considered medicinal devices.<ref name="Danish Medicines Agency">{{cite web |url= http://www.dkma.dk/1024/visUKLSArtikel.asp?artikelID=14819&print=true |author=Danish Medicines Agency|title=Classification of electronic cigarettes|work=Danish Medicines Agency|date=9 March 2009|accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> The use of electronic cigarettes has not been prohibited in Copenhagen Airport, but at least one airline ([[Scandinavian Airlines]]) has decided to ban their use on board flights.<ref name="Danish smoking law">{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/tjek/sundhedogmotion/fritid/ECE705810/elsmoeger-smyger-sig-uden-om-rygeloven-/|author=Jakob Kjær|

* In [[Estonia]], It is legal to buy nicotine containing e-liquids for personal use from another citizen or from outside the country as long as the package is sent as a private citizen and contains no more than 100ml of e-liquid per month (up to 500ml at a time). The nicotine amount within the e-liquid is unregulated. Commercial sale of nicotine containing e-liquid is illegal, commercial sale of electronic cigarette hardware and non nicotine e-liquids is legal.
* In [[Finland]], the National Supervisory Authority of Welfare and Health ([[Valvira]]) declared that the new tobacco marketing ban (effective 1 January 2012) will also cover electronic cigarettes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valvira.fi/valvira/ajankohtaista/tupakan_esillapitokielto_voimaan_-_sahkotupakan_mainonta_lainvastaista |title=Tupakan esilläpitokielto voimaan - Sähkötupakan mainonta lainvastaista |publisher=Valvira.fi |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> resulting in that Finnish stores or webstores can't advertise e-cigarettes because they might look like regular cigarettes. In theory, e-cigarettes with nicotine-free cartridges may still be sold, as long as their images and prices are not visible. Ordering from abroad remains allowed. Sale of nicotine cartridges is currently prohibited, as nicotine is considered a prescription drug requiring an authorization that such cartridges do not yet have. However, the Finnish authorities have decided that nicotine cartridges containing less than 10&nbsp;mg nicotine, and e-liquid containing less than 0,42 g nicotine per bottle, may be legally brought in from other countries for private use. If the nicotine content is higher, a prescription from a Finnish physician is required. From a country within the [[European Economic Area]] a maximum of one year's supply may be brought in for private use when returning to Finland, while three months' supply may be brought in from outside the EEA. Mail order deliveries from EEA countries, for a maximum of three months' supply, are also allowed.<ref name="Finnish ban">[http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/S%C3%A4hk%C3%B6tupakan%20myynti%20kiellettiin%20Suomessa/1135238177925 Helsingin Sanomat: "Sähkötupakan myynti kiellettiin Suomessa"] Retrieved 6 March 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.tulli.fi/sv/tiedotteet_sv/lehdistotiedotteet_sv/2010/tiedote_20101129/index.html Press release] Finnish Customs, 26 November 2010.
