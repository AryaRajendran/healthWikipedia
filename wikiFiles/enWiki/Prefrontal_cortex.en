The '''prefrontal cortex''' ('''PFC''') is the [[anterior]] part of the [[frontal lobes]] of the [[brain]], lying in front of the [[primary motor cortex|motor]] and [[premotor cortex|premotor]] areas.

This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior.<ref name="pmid19833485">{{cite journal |author=Yang Y, Raine A |title=Prefrontal structural and functional brain imaging findings in antisocial, violent, and psychopathic individuals: a meta-analysis |journal=Psychiatry Res |volume=174 |issue=2 |pages=81–8 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19833485 |pmc=2784035 |doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.03.012 |url=}}</ref> The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.<ref name="pmid12217179">{{cite journal |author=Miller EK, Freedman DJ, Wallis JD |title=The prefrontal cortex: categories, concepts and cognition |journal=Philos.

The most typical [[psychology|psychological]] term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is [[executive system|executive function]].  Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social "control" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes).

Many authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.<ref>{{cite journal | author = DeYoung C. G., Hirsh J. B., Shane M.

==Definition==

There are three possible ways to define the prefrontal cortex:
* as the granular frontal cortex
* as the projection zone of the [[mediodorsal nucleus]] of the thalamus
* as that part of the frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not evoke movements

The prefrontal cortex has been defined based on [[cytoarchitectonics]] by the presence of a [[Cerebral cortex|cortical granular layer IV]]. It is not entirely clear who first used this criterion. Many of the early cytoarchitectonic researchers restricted the use of the term prefrontal to a much smaller region of cortex including the [[gyrus rectus]] and the [[gyrus]] [[rostralis]] ([[Alfred Walter Campbell|Campbell]], 1905; [[Grafton Elliot Smith|G. E. Smith]], 1907; [[Korbinian Brodmann|Brodmann]], 1909; [[Constantin von Economo|von Economo]] and [[Georg N. Koskinas|Koskinas]], 1925). In 1935, however, [[Carlyle F. Jacobsen|Jacobsen]] used the term prefrontal to distinguish granular prefrontal areas from agranular motor and premotor areas.<ref name="isbn0-19-514694-8">{{cite book |author=Finger, Stanley |title=Origins of neuroscience: a history of explorations into brain function |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-19-514694-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> In terms of Brodmann areas, the prefrontal cortex traditionally includes areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 44, 45, 46, and 47 (to complicate matters, not all of these areas are strictly granular—44 is dysgranular, caudal 11 and orbital 47 are agranular<ref name="preuss95">{{cite journal |author=Preuss TM |title=Do rats have prefrontal cortex? The Rose-Woolsey-Akert program reconsidered. |journal=The Journal of Cogntive Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |year=1995 |doi=10.1162/jocn.1995.7.1.1 }}</ref>). The main problem with this definition is that it works well only in primates but not in nonprimates, as the latter lack a granular layer IV.<ref name="pmid14643455">{{cite journal |author=Uylings HB, Groenewegen HJ, Kolb B |title=Do rats have a prefrontal cortex? |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=146 |issue=1–2 |pages=3–17 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14643455 |doi= 10.1016/j.bbr.2003.09.028|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166432803003346}}</ref>

To define the prefrontal cortex as the projection zone of the [[Medial dorsal nucleus|mediodorsal nucleus]] of the [[thalamus]] builds on the work of Rose and Woolsey<ref name="pmid18106857">{{cite journal |author=Rose JE, Woolsey CN |title=The orbitofrontal cortex and its connections with the mediodorsal nucleus in rabbit, sheep and cat |journal=Research Publications - Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=27 (1 vol.) |issue= |pages=210–32 |year=1948 |pmid=18106857 |doi= |url=}}</ref> who showed that this nucleus projects to anterior and ventral parts of the brain in nonprimates. Rose and Woolsey however termed this projection zone "orbitofrontal." It seems to have been Akert, who in 1964 for the first time explicitly suggested that this criterion could be used to define homologues of the prefrontal cortex in primates and nonprimates.<ref name="pmid1939732">{{cite journal |author=Preuss TM, Goldman-Rakic PS |title=Myelo- and cytoarchitecture of the granular frontal cortex and surrounding regions in the strepsirhine primate Galago and the anthropoid primate Macaca |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=310 |issue=4 |pages=429–74 |year=1991 |month=August |pmid=1939732 |doi=10.1002/cne.903100402 |url=}}</ref> This allowed the establishment of homologies despite the lack of a granular frontal cortex in nonprimates.
The projection zone definition is still widely accepted today (e.g. [[Joaquin Fuster|Fuster]]<ref name="isbn0-12-373644-7">{{cite book |author=Fuster, Joaquin M. |title=The Prefrontal Cortex, Fourth Edition |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-12-373644-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>), although its usefulness has been questioned.<ref name="preuss95" /><ref name="marko79">{{cite journal| authorlink1=Hans Markowitsch |author1=Markowitsch HJ |author2=Pritzel, M |title=The prefrontal cortex: Projection area of the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus? |journal=Physiological Psychology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=1979 | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1980-29827-001 | accessdate=2 April 2011 }}</ref> Modern tract tracing studies have shown that projections of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus are not restricted to the granular frontal cortex in primates. As a result, it was suggested to define the prefrontal cortex as the region of cortex that has stronger reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus than with any other thalamic nucleus.<ref name="pmid14643455" /> Uylings et al.<ref name="pmid14643455" /> acknowledge, however, that even with the application of this criterion it might be rather difficult to unequivocally define the prefrontal cortex.

A third definition of the prefrontal cortex is the area of frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not lead to observable movements. For example, in 1890 [[David Ferrier]]<ref name="ferrier90">{{cite journal |author=Ferrier D |title=The Croonian lectures on cerebral localisation. Lecture II |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=1537 |pages=1349–1355 |year=1890 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.1537.1349 |pmc=2207859 |pmid=20753055}}</ref> used the term in this sense. One complication with this definition is that the electrically "silent" frontal cortex includes both granular and non-granular areas.<ref name="preuss95" />

==Etymology==

The term "prefrontal" as describing a part of the brain appears to have been introduced by Richard Owen in 1868.<ref name="isbn0-19-514694-8" /> For him, the prefrontal area was restricted to the anterior-most part of the frontal lobe (approximately corresponding to the frontal pole). It has been hypothesized that his choice of the term was based on the [[prefrontal bone]] present in most amphibians and reptiles.<ref name="isbn0-19-514694-8" />

==Subdivisions==

The table below shows different ways to subdivide the prefrontal cortex starting from Brodmann areas. Note that the term "dorsolateral" has been used to denote areas 8, 9, and 46 as well as areas 8, 9, 44, 45, 46, and lateral 47{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and several terms are given to areas 47, 11 and 10.

The medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the generation of [[slow-wave sleep]] (SWS), and prefrontal [[atrophy]] has been linked to decreases in SWS.<ref name="Mander 2013">{{cite doi|10.1038/nn.3324}}</ref> Prefrontal atrophy occurs naturally as individuals age, and it has been demonstrated that older adults experience impairments in [[memory consolidation]] as their medial prefrontal cortices degrade.<ref name="Mander 2013"/> In older adults, instead of being transferred and stored in the [[neocortex]] during SWS, memories start to remain in the [[hippocampus]] where they were [[encoding (memory)|encoded]], as evidenced by increased hippocampal activation compared to younger adults during [[recall (memory)|recall]] tasks when subjects learned word associations, slept, and then were asked to recall the learned words.<ref name="Mander 2013"/>




==Studies==
Perhaps the seminal case in prefrontal cortex function is that of [[Phineas Gage]], whose left frontal lobe was destroyed when a large iron rod was driven through his head in an 1848 accident.  The standard presentation (e.g.<ref>[[Antonio Damasio]], ''[[Descartes' Error]]''. [[Penguin Putman Pub.]], 1994</ref>) is that, although Gage retained normal memory, speech and motor skills, his personality changed radically: He became irritable, quick-tempered, and impatient—characteristics he did not previously display — so that friends described him as "no longer Gage"; and, whereas he had previously been a capable and efficient worker, afterward he was unable to complete tasks.  However, careful analysis of primary evidence shows that descriptions of Gage's psychological changes are usually exaggerated when held against the description given by Gage's doctor, the most striking feature being that changes described years after Gage's death are far more dramatic than anything reported while he was alive.<ref>Malcolm Macmillan, ''An Odd Kind of Fame: Stories of Phineas Gage'' (MIT Press, 2000), pp.116-119, 307-333, esp. pp.11,333.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Macmillan, M. |year=2008|url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_21-editionID_164-ArticleID_1399-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist%5C0908look.pdf|format=PDF|title=Phineas Gage – Unravelling the myth |journal = The Psychologist |publisher=[[British Psychological Society]] | volume= 21 |issue=9 |pages= 828–831 }}</ref>

Subsequent studies on patients with prefrontal injuries have shown that the patients verbalized what the most appropriate social responses would be under certain circumstances. Yet, when actually performing, they instead pursued behavior aimed at immediate gratification, despite knowing the longer-term results would be self-defeating.  

The interpretation of this data indicates that not only are skills of comparison and understanding of eventual outcomes harbored in the prefrontal cortex but the prefrontal cortex (when functioning correctly) controls the mental option to delay immediate gratification for a better or more rewarding longer-term gratification result.  This ability to wait for a reward is one of the key pieces that define optimal executive function of the human brain.

There is much current research devoted to understanding the role of the prefrontal cortex in neurological disorders. Many disorders, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], and [[ADHD]], have been related to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, and thus this area of the brain offers the potential for new treatments of these conditions.{{fact|date=March 2012}} Clinical trials have begun on certain drugs that have been shown to improve prefrontal cortex function, including [[guanfacine]], which acts through the [[alpha-2A adrenergic receptor]]. A downstream target of this drug, the [[HCN channel]], is one of the most recent areas of exploration in prefrontal cortex pharmacology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang, M. et al. |title=Alpha2A-adrenoceptors strengthen working memory networks by inhibiting cAMP-HCN channel signaling in prefrontal cortex |journal=Cell |volume=129 |issue=2 |pages=397–410 |year=2007 |pmid=17448997 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.015}}</ref>

[[Interference theory]] can be broken into three kinds: proactive, retroactive, and output. 

;Proactive

==Executive functions==

The original studies of [[Joaquin Fuster| Fuster]] and of [[Patricia Goldman-Rakic|Goldman-Rakic]] emphasized the fundamental ability of the prefrontal cortex to represent information not currently in the environment, and the central role of this function in creating the "mental sketch pad". Goldman-Rakic spoke of how this representational knowledge was used to intelligently guide thought, action, and emotion, including the inhibition of inappropriate thoughts, distractions, actions, and feelings.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goldman-Rakic PS| year = 1996| title = The prefrontal landscape: implications of functional architecture for understanding human mentation and the central executive | url = | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 351 |issue=1346| pages = 1445–53 |pmid=8941956 | jstor=3069191 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1996.0129 | last2 = Cools | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Srivastava | first3 = K. }}</ref> In this way, working memory can be seen as fundamental to attention and behavioral inhibition. Fuster speaks of how this prefrontal ability allows the wedding of past to future, allowing both cross-temporal and cross-modal associations in the creation of goal-directed, perception-action cycles.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/35012613 | author = Fuster JM, Bodner M, Kroger JK | year = 2000 | title = Cross-modal and cross-temporal association in neurons of frontal cortex | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 405 | issue = 6784| pages = 347–51 | pmid = 10830963 }}</ref> This ability to represent underlies all other higher executive functions.

Shimamura proposed Dynamic Filtering Theory to describe the role of the prefrontal cortex in [[executive functions]]. The prefrontal cortex is presumed to act as a high-level gating or filtering mechanism that enhances goal-directed activations and inhibits irrelevant activations. This filtering mechanism enables executive control at various levels of processing, including selecting, maintaining, updating, and rerouting activations. It has also been used to explain emotional regulation.<ref name="Shimamura">{{cite journal |author=Shimamura, A. P. |title=The role of the prefrontal cortex in dynamic filtering |journal= Psychobiology |volume=28 |pages=207–218 |year=2000 | url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~shimlab/2000_Shimamura_DynFilter.pdf | format=PDF | issn=0889-6313}}</ref> 

Miller and Cohen proposed an Integrative Theory of Prefrontal Cortex Function, that arises from the original work of Goldman-Rakic and Fuster. The two theorize that “cognitive control stems from the active maintenance of patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex that represents goals and means to achieve them. They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task”.<ref name="MillerCohen">{{cite journal |author=Miller EK, Cohen JD |title=An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=24 |issue= |pages=167–202 |year=2001 |pmid=11283309 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.167}}</ref> In essence, the two theorize that the prefrontal cortex guides the inputs and connections, which allows for cognitive control of our actions.

The prefrontal cortex is of significant importance when top-down processing is needed. Top-down processing by definition is when behavior is guided by internal states or intentions. According to the two, “The PFC is critical in situations when the mappings between sensory inputs, thoughts, and actions either are weakly established relative to other existing ones or are rapidly changing”.<ref name="MillerCohen" /> An example of this can be portrayed in the [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test|Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)]]. Subjects engaging in this task are instructed to sort cards according to the shape, color, or number of symbols appearing on them. The thought is that any given card can be associated with a number of actions and no single stimulus-response mapping will work. Human subjects with PFC damage are able to sort the card in the initial simple tasks, but unable to do so as the rules of classification change. 
 
Miller and Cohen conclude that the implications of their theory can explain how much of a role the PFC has in guiding control of cognitive actions. In the researchers' own words, they claim that, “depending on their target of influence, representations in the PFC can function variously as attentional templates, rules, or goals by providing top-down bias signals to other parts of the brain that guide the flow of activity along the pathways needed to perform a task”.<ref name="MillerCohen" />

Experimental data indicate a role for the prefrontal cortex in mediating normal sleep physiology, dreaming and sleep-deprivation phenomena.<ref>Muzur, A.; Pace-Schott, E. F.; Hobson, J. A. (2002). The prefrontal cortex in sleep. ‘’Trends in Cognitive Sciences’’, 6(11), 475-481.</ref>

When analyzing and thinking about attributes of other individuals, the medial prefrontal cortex is activated. However, it is not activated when contemplating about the characteristics of inanimate objects.<ref>Mitchell, J.P, Heatherton, T.G., &Macrae, C.N. (2002). Distinct neural systems have subserve person and object knowledge. "proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 99, 15238-15243.</ref> 
As of recent, researchers have used neuroimaging techniques to find that along with the basal ganglia, the prefrontal cortex is involved with learning exemplars, which is part of the ''exemplar theory'', one of the three main ways our mind categorizes things. The exemplar theory states that we categorize judgements by comparing it to a similar past experience within our stored memories. <ref>Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel Todd Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner.

In the last few decades, [[neuroimaging|brain imaging]] systems have been used to determine brain region volumes and nerve linkages.
