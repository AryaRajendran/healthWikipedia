'''Pulmonary embolism''' ('''PE''') is a blockage of the [[pulmonary artery|main artery of the lung]] or one of its branches by a substance that has travelled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream ([[embolism]]). PE most commonly results from [[deep vein thrombosis]] (a blood clot in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis) that breaks off and migrates to the lung, a process termed ''[[venous thromboembolism]]'' (VTE). A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of [[air embolism|air]], [[fat embolism|fat]], talc in drugs of intravenous drug abusers or [[amniotic fluid embolism|amniotic fluid]]. The obstruction of the blood flow through the [[lung]]s and the resultant pressure on the [[right ventricle]] of the heart lead to the symptoms and signs of PE. The risk of PE is increased in various situations, such as [[cancer]] or prolonged [[bed rest]].<ref name=Goldhaber>{{cite book |author=Goldhaber SZ |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1561–65 |chapter=Pulmonary thromboembolism}}</ref>

Symptoms of pulmonary embolism include [[dyspnea|difficulty breathing]], [[pleuritic chest pain|chest pain on inspiration]], and [[palpitation]]s. [[Clinical sign]]s include low blood [[oxygen saturation]] and [[cyanosis]], [[tachypnea|rapid breathing]], and [[tachycardia|a rapid heart rate]]. Severe cases of PE can lead to [[Collapse (medical)|collapse]], [[shock (circulatory)|abnormally low blood pressure]], and [[cardiac arrest|sudden death]].<ref name=Goldhaber/>

Diagnosis is based on these clinical findings in combination with laboratory tests (such as the [[D-dimer]] test) and imaging studies, usually [[CT pulmonary angiography]]. Treatment is typically with [[anticoagulant]] medication, including [[heparin]] and [[warfarin]]. Severe cases may require [[thrombolysis]] with drugs such as [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (tPA) or may require surgical intervention via [[pulmonary thrombectomy]].<ref name=Goldhaber/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of PE are typically sudden in onset and include [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), [[tachypnea]] (rapid breathing), [[chest pain]] of a "pleuritic" nature (worsened by breathing), [[cough]] and [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up blood). More severe cases can include signs such as [[cyanosis]] (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), [[Collapse (medical)|collapse]], and [[shock (circulatory)|circulatory instability]] due to decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the heart. About 15% of all cases of [[Sudden cardiac death|sudden death]] are attributable to PE.<ref name=Goldhaber/>

On physical examination, the lungs are usually normal. Occasionally, a [[pleural friction rub]] may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct). A [[pleural effusion]] is sometimes present that is transudative, detectable by decreased percussion note, audible breath sounds and vocal resonance. Strain on the right ventricle may be detected as a left parasternal heave, a loud [[heart sounds|pulmonary component of the second heart sound]], and raised [[jugular venous pressure]].<ref name=Goldhaber/> A low-grade [[fever]] may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein PD, Sostman HD, Hull RD, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism in the Coronary Care Unit |journal=Am. J. Cardiol. |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=881–6 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19268750 |pmc=2717714 |doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.11.040}}</ref>

More rarely, inability of the right ventricle to remove fluid from the tissues leads to fluid accumulation in the legs (peripheral edema), congestion of the liver with mild [[jaundice]] and tenderness, and [[ascites]] (fluid in the abdominal cavity).{{citation needed | date=November 2010}}

==Risk factors==
[[File:DVT2010.JPG|thumb|A deep vein thrombosis as seen in the right leg is a risk factor for PE]]
The most common sources of embolism are [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] leg [[deep venous thrombosis]] (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses. Any risk factor for DVT also increases the risk that the venous clot will dislodge and migrate to the lung circulation, which may happen in as many as 15% of all DVTs.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The conditions are generally regarded as a continuum termed ''[[venous thromboembolism]]'' (VTE).

The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named [[Virchow's triad]] (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall and factors affecting the properties of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present.
* ''Alterations in blood flow'': immobilization (after surgery, [[Physical trauma|injury]], [[pregnancy]] (also procoagulant), [[obesity]] (also procoagulant), [[cancer]] (also procoagulant)
* ''Factors in the vessel wall'': of limited direct relevance in VTE
* ''Factors affecting the properties of the blood'' (procoagulant state):
** [[Estrogen]]-containing [[hormonal contraception]]
** Genetic thrombophilia ([[factor V Leiden]], [[prothrombin mutation G20210A]], [[protein C deficiency]], [[protein S deficiency]], [[antithrombin]] deficiency, [[hyperhomocysteinemia]] and [[plasminogen]]/[[fibrinolysis]] disorders)
** Acquired thrombophilia ([[antiphospholipid syndrome]], [[nephrotic syndrome]], [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]])
** [[Cancer]] (due to secretion of pro-coagulants)

==Diagnosis==

To diagnose pulmonary embolism, medical societies recommend a review of clinical criteria to determine the need for testing, followed by testing to determine a likelihood of being able to confirm a diagnosis by imaging, followed by imaging if other tests have shown that there is a likelihood of a PE diagnosis.<ref name="ACRfive">{{Citation |author1 = American College of Radiology |author1-link = American College of Radiology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American College of Radiology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Radiology.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name="PIOPEDrecommend">{{cite doi|10.1148/radiol.2421060971}}</ref><ref name="embolismguidelines">{{cite doi|10.1093/eurheartj/ehn310}}</ref>

The diagnosis of PE is based primarily on validated clinical criteria combined with selective testing because the typical clinical presentation ([[shortness of breath]], [[chest pain]]) cannot be definitively differentiated from other causes of chest pain and shortness of breath. The decision to do medical imaging is usually based on clinical grounds, i.e. the [[medical history]], symptoms and findings on [[physical examination]], followed by an assessment of clinical probability.<ref name=Goldhaber/>

The most commonly used method to predict clinical probability, the Wells score, is a [[clinical prediction rule]], whose use is complicated by multiple versions being available. In 1995, Wells ''et al.'' initially developed a prediction rule (based on a literature search) to predict the likelihood of PE, based on clinical criteria.<ref name=pmid7752753>{{cite journal |author=Wells PS, Hirsh J, Anderson DR, Lensing AW, Foster G, Kearon C, Weitz J, D'Ovidio R, Cogo A, Prandoni P |title=Accuracy of clinical assessment of deep-vein thrombosis |journal=Lancet |volume=345 |issue=8961 |pages=1326–30 |year=1995 |pmid=7752753 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(95)92535-X}}</ref> The prediction rule was revised in 1998<ref name=pmid9867786>{{cite journal |author=Wells PS, Ginsberg JS, Anderson DR, Kearon C, Gent M, Turpie AG, Bormanis J, Weitz J, Chamberlain M, Bowie D, Barnes D, Hirsh J |title=Use of a clinical model for safe management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=129 |issue=12 |pages=997–1005 |year=1998 |pmid=9867786 |last12=Hirsh |first12=J}}</ref> This prediction rule was further revised when simplified during a validation by Wells ''et al.'' in 2000.<ref name=pmid10744147>{{cite journal | author = Wells P, Anderson D, Rodger M, Ginsberg J, Kearon C, Gent M, Turpie A, Bormanis J, Weitz J, Chamberlain M, Bowie D, Barnes D, Hirsh J | title = Derivation of a simple clinical model to categorize patients probability of pulmonary embolism: increasing the models utility with the SimpliRED D-dimer | journal = Thromb Haemost | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 416–20 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10744147 | last12 = Barnes | first12 = D | last13 = Hirsh | first13 = J}}</ref> In the 2000 publication, Wells proposed two different scoring systems using cutoffs of 2 or 4 with the same prediction rule.<ref name=pmid10744147/> In 2001, Wells published results using the more conservative cutoff of 2 to create three categories.<ref name=pmid11453709>{{cite journal |author=Wells PS, Anderson DR, Rodger M, Stiell I, Dreyer JF, Barnes D, Forgie M, Kovacs G, Ward J, Kovacs MJ |title=Excluding pulmonary embolism at the bedside without diagnostic imaging: management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism presenting to the emergency department by using a simple clinical model and d-dimer |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=98–107 |year=2001 |pmid=11453709 | url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/135/2/98}}</ref> An additional version, the "modified extended version", using the more recent cutoff of 2 but including findings from Wells's initial studies<ref name=pmid7752753/><ref name=pmid9867786/> were proposed.<ref name=pmid10739372>{{cite journal |author=Sanson BJ, Lijmer JG, Mac Gillavry MR, Turkstra F, Prins MH, Büller HR |title=Comparison of a clinical probability estimate and two clinical models in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

===Blood tests===
Early primary research has shown that in low/moderate suspicion of PE, a normal [[D-dimer]] level (shown in a [[blood test]]) is enough to exclude the possibility of thrombotic PE.<ref name=pmid8165626>{{cite journal |author=Bounameaux H, de Moerloose P, Perrier A, Reber G |title=Plasma measurement of D-dimer as diagnostic aid in suspected venous thromboembolism: an overview |journal=Thromb. Haemost. |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=1994 |pmid=8165626 |doi=}}</ref> This has been corroborated by a recent [[systematic review]] of studies of patients with low [[clinical utility of diagnostic tests|pre-test probability]] (PTP) of PE and negative [[D-dimer]] results that found the three month risk of thromboembolic events in patients excluded in this manner was 0.14%, with [[confidence interval|95% confidence intervals]] from 0.05 to 0.41%, though this review was limited by its use of only one [[randomized controlled trial|randomized-controlled clinical trial]], the remainder of studies being [[prospective cohort study|prospective cohorts]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carrier M, Righini M, Djurabi RK, ''et al.'' |title=VIDAS D-dimer in combination with clinical pre-test probability to rule out pulmonary embolism.

In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of certainty, an indication of absence of a PE.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schrecengost JE, LeGallo RD, Boyd JC, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of diagnostic accuracies in outpatients and hospitalized patients of D-dimer testing for the evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism |journal=Clin.

When a PE is being suspected, a number of [[blood test]]s are done, in order to exclude important secondary causes of PE. This includes a [[full blood count]], [[coagulation|clotting status]] ([[prothrombin time|PT]], [[aPTT]], [[thrombin time|TT]]), and some screening tests ([[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], [[renal function]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[electrolyte]]s). If one of these is abnormal, further investigations might be warranted.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In typical patients who are not known to be at high risk of PE, imaging is helpful to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of PE after simpler first-line tests are used.<ref name="ACRfive"/><ref name="PIOPEDrecommend"/><ref name="embolismguidelines"/> Medical societies recommend tests such as the [[D-dimer]] to first provide supporting evidence for the need for imaging, and imaging would be done if other tests confirmed a moderate or high probability of finding evidence to support a diagnosis of PE.<ref name="PIOPEDrecommend"/><ref name="embolismguidelines"/>

The [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) is [[pulmonary angiography]]. Pulmonary angiography is used less often due to wider acceptance of CT scans, which are non-invasive. CT pulmonary angiography is the recommended first line diagnostic imaging test in most people.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

;Non-invasive imaging
[[CT pulmonary angiogram|CT pulmonary angiography]] (CTPA) is a [[pulmonary angiogram]] obtained using [[computed tomography]] (CT) with [[radiocontrast]] rather than right heart catheterization. Its advantages are clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to people, and the possibility of identifying other lung disorders from the [[differential diagnosis]] in case there is no pulmonary embolism. Assessing the accuracy of CT pulmonary angiography is hindered by the rapid changes in the number of rows of detectors available in multidetector CT (MDCT) machines.<ref name=pmid16479644>{{cite journal |author=Schaefer-Prokop C, Prokop M |title=MDCT for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism |journal=European radiology |volume=15 |issue=Suppl 4 |pages=D37–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16479644 |doi=10.1007/s10406-005-0144-3}}</ref> According to a [[cohort study]], single-slice [[spiral CT]] may help diagnose detection among people with suspected pulmonary embolism.<ref name="pmid15634261">{{cite journal|title=Accuracy of single-detector spiral CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a prospective multicenter cohort study of consecutive patients with abnormal perfusion scintigraphy|year=2005|journal=Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH |pmid=15634261|doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.01064.x| last1=Van Strijen| first1=MJ| last2=De Monye| first2=W| last3=Kieft| first3=GJ| last4=Pattynama| first4=PM| last5=Prins| first5=MH| last6=Huisman| first6=MV| volume=3| issue=1| pages=17–25}}</ref> In this study, the [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] was 69% and [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] was 84%.

However, this study's results may be biased due to possible incorporation bias, since the CT scan was the final diagnostic tool in people with pulmonary embolism. The authors noted that a negative single slice CT scan is insufficient to rule out pulmonary embolism on its own. A separate study with a mixture of 4 slice and 16 slice scanners reported a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 83% and a [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 96%. This study noted that additional testing is necessary when the clinical probability is inconsistent with the imaging results.<ref name=pmid16738268>{{cite journal |author=Stein PD, Fowler SE, Goodman LR, ''et al.'' |title=Multidetector computed tomography for acute pulmonary embolism |journal=N.

Tests that are frequently done that are not [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] for PE, but can be diagnostic.

Chest X-rays in PE are rarely normal,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Worsley D, Alavi A, Aronchick J, Chen J, Greenspan R, Ravin C | title = Chest radiographic findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: observations from the PIOPED Study | journal = Radiology | volume = 189 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–6 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8372182}}</ref> but usually lack [[radiologic sign|sign]]s that suggest the diagnosis of PE (e.g. [[Westermark sign]], [[Hampton's hump]]).
*[[medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] of the legs, also known as leg doppler, in search of [[deep venous thrombosis]] (DVT). The presence of DVT, as shown on [[ultrasonography]] of the legs, is in itself enough to warrant anticoagulation, without requiring the V/Q or spiral CT scans (because of the strong association between DVT and PE). This may be valid approach in [[pregnancy]], in which the other modalities would increase the risk of birth defects in the unborn child. However, a negative scan does not rule out PE, and low-radiation dose scanning may be required if the mother is deemed at high risk of having pulmonary embolism. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Electrocardiogram===
[[File:Pulmonary embolism ECG.jpg|thumb|Electrocardiogram of a patient with pulmonary embolism showing [[sinus tachycardia]] of approximately 150 beats per minute and [[right bundle branch block]].]]
An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) is routinely done on patients with chest pain to quickly diagnose [[myocardial infarction]]s (heart attacks).

The primary use of the ECG is to rule out other causes of chest pain.<ref name=Hogg2005>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=G|coauthors=Hogg, K|title=Best evidence topic report.

In massive and submassive PE, dysfunction of the right side of the heart may be seen on [[echocardiography]], an indication that the [[pulmonary artery]] is severely obstructed and the [[right ventricle]], a low pressure pump, is unable to match the pressure. Some studies (see below) suggest that this finding may be an indication for [[thrombolysis]]. Not every person with a (suspected) pulmonary embolism requires an echocardiogram, but elevations in [[troponin|cardiac troponins]] or [[brain natriuretic peptide]] may indicate heart strain and warrant an echocardiogram,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kucher N, Goldhaber SZ |title=Cardiac biomarkers for risk stratification of patients with acute pulmonary embolism |journal=Circulation |volume=108 |issue=18 |pages=2191–4 |year=2003 |pmid=14597581 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000100687.99687.CE}}</ref> and be important in prognosis.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Predictive value of the high-sensitivity troponin T assay and the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a prospective validation study | author=Lankeit M, Jiménez D, Kostrubiec M, Dellas C, Hasenfuss G, Pruszczyk P, Konstantinides S | date=2011 Dec | journal=Circulation | volume=124(24) | pages=2716-24 | pmid=22082681 }}</ref>

The specific appearance of the right ventricle on echocardiography is referred to as the ''McConnell's sign''. This is the finding of akinesia of the mid-free wall but normal motion of the apex. This phenomenon has a 77% sensitivity and a 94% specificity for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in the setting of right ventricular dysfunction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McConnell MV, Solomon SD, Rayan ME, Come PC, Goldhaber SZ, Lee RT |title=Regional right ventricular dysfunction detected by echocardiography in acute pulmonary embolism |journal=Am. J. Cardiol. |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=469–73 |year=1996 |pmid=8752195 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(96)00339-6}}</ref>

===Algorithms===
Recent recommendations for a [[Medical algorithm|diagnostic algorithm]] have been published by the PIOPED investigators; however, these recommendations do not reflect research using 64 slice MDCT.<ref name=pmid17185658/> These investigators recommended:
* Low clinical probability. If negative D-dimer, PE is excluded. If positive D-dimer, obtain MDCT and based treatment on results.
* Moderate clinical probability. If negative D-dimer, PE is excluded. ''However'', the authors were not concerned that a negative MDCT with negative D-dimer in this setting has an 5% probability of being false. Presumably, the 5% error rate will fall as 64 slice MDCT is more commonly used. If positive D-dimer, obtain MDCT and based treatment on results.
* High clinical probability. Proceed to MDCT. If positive, treat, if negative, additional tests are needed to exclude PE.

;Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria
The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria, or PERC rule, helps assess people in whom pulmonary embolism is suspected, but unlikely. Unlike the Wells Score and Geneva score, which are clinical prediction rules intended to risk stratify patients with suspected PE, the PERC rule is designed to rule out risk of PE in patients when the physician has already stratified them into a low-risk category.

Patients in this low risk category without any of these criteria may undergo no further diagnostic testing for PE: Hypoxia — [[Oxygenation (medical)#Oxygen_saturation|Sa<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>]] <95%, unilateral leg swelling, hemoptysis, prior DVT or PE, recent surgery or trauma, age >50, hormone use, tachycardia. The rationale behind this decision is that further testing (specifically CT angiogram of the chest) may cause more harm (from radiation exposure and contrast dye) than the risk of PE.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kline | first =  Jeffrey A | year = 2004 | title = Clinical criteria to prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = 1247–55 | doi = 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.00790.x | url = http://piedmontfayetteed.org/PERC%20rule.pdf |format=PDF | pmid = 15304025 | last1 = Kline | first1 = JA | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = AM | last3 = Kabrhel | first3 = C | last4 = Richman | first4 = PB | last5 = Courtney | first5 = DM}}</ref> The PERC rule has a sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 21.9% with a false negative rate of 1.0% (16/1666).<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kline | first =  Jeffrey A | year = 2008 | title = Prospective multicenter evaluation of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 772–780 | doi = 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.02944.x | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/jth/2008/00000006/00000005/art00010 | pmid = 18318689 | last1 = Kline | first1 = JA | last2 = Courtney | first2 = DM | last3 = Kabrhel | first3 = C | last4 = Moore | first4 = CL | last5 = Smithline | first5 = HA | last6 = Plewa | first6 = MC | last7 = Richman | first7 = PB | last8 = O'Neil | first8 = BJ | last9 = Nordenholz | first9 = K}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Anticoagulant therapy]] is typically the mainstay of treatment. Acutely, supportive treatments, such as [[oxygen therapy|oxygen]] or [[analgesia]], may be required. People are often admitted to hospital in the early stages of treatment, and tend to remain under inpatient care until the INR has reached therapeutic levels. Increasingly, however low-risk cases are managed at home in a fashion already common in the treatment of DVT.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vinson|first=DR|coauthors=Zehtabchi, S; Yealy, DM|title=Can selected patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism be safely treated without hospitalization? A systematic review.|journal=Annals of emergency medicine|date=2012 Nov|volume=60|issue=5|pages=651-662.e4|pmid=22944455}}</ref>

===Anticoagulation===
In most cases, anticoagulant therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Unfractionated [[heparin]], [[low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH), or [[fondaparinux]] is administered initially, while [[warfarin]], [[acenocoumarol]], or [[phenprocoumon]] therapy is commenced (this may take several days, usually while the patient is in the hospital). LMWH may reduce bleeding among patients with pulmonary embolism as compared to heparin according to a [[systematic review]] of [[randomized controlled trial]]s by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]].<ref name="pmid15495007">{{cite journal |author=Erkens PM, Prins MH |title=Fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins versus adjusted dose unfractionated heparin for venous thromboembolism |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=9 |pages=CD001100 |year=2010 |pmid=20824828 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001100.pub3 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001100.pub3/abstract |editor1-last=Prins |editor1-first=Martin H}} [http://pubmed.gov/15862070 ACPJC Review]</ref> The [[relative risk reduction]] was 40%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (2.0% had bleeding when not treated with low molecular weight heparin), this leads to an [[absolute risk reduction]] of 0.8%. 125 patients [[number needed to treat|must be treated for one to benefit]].

Warfarin therapy often requires frequent dose adjustment and monitoring of the [[international normalized ratio]] (INR). In PE, INRs between 2.0 and 3.0 are generally considered ideal. If another episode of PE occurs under warfarin treatment, the INR window may be increased to e.g. 2.5–3.5 (unless there are contraindications) or anticoagulation may be changed to a different anticoagulant e.g. LMWH. In patients with an underlying malignancy, therapy with a course of LMWH may be favored over warfarin based on the results of the CLOT trial.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lee AY, Levine MN, Baker RI, Bowden C, [[Ajay Kakkar, Baron Kakkar|Kakkar AK]], Prins M, Rickles FR, Julian JA, Haley S, Kovacs MJ, Gent M | title=Low-molecular-weight heparin versus a coumarin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2003 | pages=146–53 | volume=349 | issue=2  | pmid=12853587 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa025313 | last12=Randomized Comparison Of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin Versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy For The Prevention Of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism In Patients With Cancer (Clot) | first12=Investigators}}</ref>

Similarly, pregnant women are often maintained on low molecular weight heparin until at least 6 weeks after delivery to avoid the known [[teratogenic]] effects of warfarin, especially in the early stages of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Benson|first=MD|title=Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy. Consensus and controversies.|journal=Minerva ginecologica|date=2012 Oct|volume=64|issue=5|pages=387-98|pmid=23018478}}</ref>

Warfarin therapy is usually continued for 3–6 months, or "lifelong" if there have been previous DVTs or PEs, or none of the usual risk factors is present. An abnormal [[D-dimer]] level at the end of treatment might signal the need for continued treatment among patients with a first unprovoked pulmonary embolus.<ref name=pmid17065639>{{cite journal |author=Palareti G, Cosmi B, Legnani C, ''et al.'' |title=D-dimer testing to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy |journal=N.

===Thrombolysis===
Massive PE causing hemodynamic instability (shock and/or hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or a pressure drop of 40 mmHg for >15 min if not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolemia or sepsis) is an indication for [[thrombolysis]], the enzymatic destruction of the clot with medication. It is the best available medical treatment in this situation and is supported by clinical guidelines.<ref>{{cite journal |title=British Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of suspected acute pulmonary embolism |journal=Thorax |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=470–83 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12775856 |pmc=1746692 |doi=10.1136/thorax.58.6.470 |url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/58/6/470 |last1= British Thoracic Society Standards Of Care Committee Pulmonary Embolism Guideline Development |first1= Group}}</ref><ref name=ESC>{{cite journal |author=Torbicki A, Perrier A, Konstantinides S, ''et al.'' |title=Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism: the Task Force for the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) |journal=Eur.

The use of thrombolysis in non-massive PEs is still debated. The aim of the therapy is to dissolve the clot, but there is an attendant risk of bleeding or [[cerebrovascular accident|stroke]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dong B, Jirong Y, Liu G, Wang Q, Wu T |title=Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=2 |pages=CD004437 |year=2006 |pmid=16625603 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004437.pub2 |editor1-last=Dong |editor1-first=Bi Rong }}</ref> The main indication for thrombolysis is in submassive PE where right ventricular dysfunction can be demonstrated on [[echocardiography]], and the presence of visible thrombus in the atrium.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Goldhaber SZ | title=Pulmonary embolism |journal=Lancet | year=2004 | volume=363 | pages=1295–305 | pmid=15094276 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16004-2 | issue=9417}}</ref>

===Inferior vena cava filter===
[[File:Inferior vena cava filter.jpg|thumb|right|Used inferior vena cava filter.]]
If anticoagulant therapy is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] and/or ineffective, or to prevent new emboli from entering the pulmonary artery and combining with an existing blockage, an [[inferior vena cava filter]] may be implanted.<ref name=pmid9459643>{{cite journal |author=Decousus H, Leizorovicz A, Parent F, Page Y, Tardy B, Girard P, Laporte S, Faivre R, Charbonnier B, Barral F, Huet Y, Simonneau G |title=A clinical trial of vena caval filters in the prevention of pulmonary embolism in patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis.

===Surgery===
Surgical management of acute pulmonary embolism ([[pulmonary thrombectomy]]) is uncommon and has largely been abandoned because of poor long-term outcomes. However, recently, it has gone through a resurgence with the revision of the surgical technique and is thought to benefit certain people.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Augustinos P, Ouriel K | title=Invasive approaches to treatment of venous thromboembolism | journal=Circulation | year=2004 | volume=110 | issue=9 Suppl 1 |pages=I27–34 | pmid=15339878  | doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000140900.64198.f4}}</ref> Chronic pulmonary embolism leading to [[pulmonary hypertension]] (known as ''chronic thromboembolic hypertension'') is treated with a surgical procedure known as a [[pulmonary thromboendarterectomy]].

==Prognosis==
[[File:Saddle thromboembolus.jpg|thumb|Large saddle embolus seen in the pulmonary artery.]]
[[Mortality rate|Mortality]] from untreated PE is said to be 26%. This figure comes from a trial published in 1960 by Barrit and Jordan,<ref name=Barritt>{{cite journal|author=Barritt DW, Jordan SC | title=Anticoagulant drugs in the treatment of pulmonary embolism: a controlled trial | journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] | year=1960 | volume=1 | pages=1309–12 | pmid=13797091 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(60)92299-6|issue=7138 }}</ref> which compared anticoagulation against placebo for the management of PE. Barritt and Jordan performed their study in the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]] in 1957. This study is the only placebo controlled trial ever to examine the place of anticoagulants in the treatment of PE, the results of which were so convincing that the trial has never been repeated as to do so would be considered unethical. That said, the reported mortality rate of 26% in the placebo group is probably an overstatement, given that the technology of the day may have detected only severe PEs.

Prognosis depends on the amount of lung that is affected and on the co-existence of other medical conditions; chronic embolisation to the lung can lead to [[pulmonary hypertension]]. After a massive PE, the embolus must be resolved somehow if the patient is to survive. In thrombotic PE, the blood clot may be broken down by [[fibrinolysis]], or it may be organized and recanalized so that a new channel forms through the clot. Blood flow is restored most rapidly in the first day or two after a PE.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = British Medical Journal | date=17 October 1970| volume = 4 | pages = 135–9 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.4.5728.135 | title = Resolution of Pulmonary Embolism | first1 = R.

Once anticoagulation is stopped, the risk of a fatal pulmonary embolism is 0.5% per year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White RH |title=Risk of fatal pulmonary embolism was 0.49 per 100 person-years after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism |journal=Evid Based Med |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=154 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18836122 |doi=10.1136/ebm.13.5.154 |url=}}</ref>

===Predicting mortality===
The PESI and [[Geneva_score|Geneva prediction rules]] can estimate mortality and so may guide selection of patients who can be considered for outpatient therapy.<ref name=pmid17625081>{{cite journal |author=Jiménez D, Yusen RD, Otero R, ''et al.'' |title=Prognostic models for selecting patients with acute pulmonary embolism for initial outpatient therapy |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=1 |pages=24–30 |year=2007 |pmid=17625081 |doi=10.1378/chest.06-2921}}</ref>

===Underlying causes===
After a first PE, the search for secondary causes is usually brief. Only when a second PE occurs, and especially when this happens while still under [[anticoagulant]] therapy, a further search for underlying conditions is undertaken. This will include testing ("thrombophilia screen") for [[Factor V Leiden mutation]], antiphospholipid antibodies, [[protein C]] and [[Protein S|S]] and [[antithrombin]] levels, and later prothrombin mutation, [[Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase|MTHFR]] mutation, [[Factor VIII]] concentration and rarer inherited [[coagulation]] abnormalities. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
