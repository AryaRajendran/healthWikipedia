The '''National Vaccine Information Center''' (NVIC) is a private [[non-profit]] [[501(c)(3)]] [[advocacy group]] which questions the safety and efficacy of commonly used [[vaccine]]s.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Swine Flu Shots Revive a Debate About Vaccines | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | date = October 15, 2009 | accessdate = April 17, 2010 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/health/16vaccine.html}}</ref> The group was founded in 1982 by parents who blamed routine vaccination for the illness or death of a child. [[Michael Specter]] has described the NVIC as "the most powerful anti-vaccine organization in America, and its relationship with the U.S. government consists almost entirely of opposing federal efforts aimed at vaccinating children."<ref name=specter/>

==Background==

The National Vaccine Information Center was co-founded in 1982 by Jeff Schwartz, Barbara Loe Fisher (aka Barbara Loe Arthur),<ref name=Arthur>[http://dockets.justia.com/docket/virginia/vaedce/1:2009cv01398/249527/ Arthur v. Offit et al]. Barbara Loe Fisher used the name "Barbara Loe Arthur" in this lawsuit against [[Paul Offit]]. The case was dismissed.</ref> and Kathi Williams, each of whom had children who, they claim, regressed after severe reactions to the [[DPT vaccine]] and were [[Acquired brain injury|brain injured]] as a result. In 1985, Fisher co-authored with Harris Coulter a critique of the mass vaccination system, ''DPT: A Shot in the Dark'', which presented a view of an [[correlation does not imply causation|association]] between whole cell [[pertussis]] (whooping cough) vaccine in the DPT shot and  brain and [[immune system]] damage, including [[autism]]. 

In the early 1980s, NVIC co-founders worked with Congress on the [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]] of 1986{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}, which created a federal [[vaccine injury]] compensation program, mandated that doctors give parents vaccine benefit and risk information, and required the recording and reporting of vaccine injuries and deaths (see [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]]).  Since then, NVIC has monitored vaccine research, development, regulation, policymaking, and legislation and has criticized mandatory [[vaccination]] policies for lacking informed consent protections for individuals.<ref>Fisher, B, [http://www.nvic.org/informed-consent.aspx ''The Moral Right to Conscientious, Philosophical and Personal Belief Exemption to Vaccination''], ''NVIC'', 1997</ref>

==Criticism==

[[Michael Specter]] has described the NVIC as:

: "... an organization that, based on its name, certainly sounds like a federal agency. Actually, it's just the opposite: the NVIC is the most powerful anti-vaccine organization in America, and its relationship with the U.S. government consists almost entirely of opposing federal efforts aimed at vaccinating children."<ref name=specter>{{Cite book | first = Michael | last = Specter | authorlink = Michael Specter | title = Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives | page = 7 | quote = | year = 2009 | publisher = [[The Penguin Press]] | isbn = 978-1-59420-230-8}}</ref>

The NVIC argues that there has been inadequate research into the link between the rise in the number of children diagnosed with autism and mass-vaccination programs. There have, however, been a number of peer-reviewed studies and meta-analyses which have shown no correlation between vaccine administration and autism diagnosis.<ref>[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476 Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses.

The NVIC received criticism in April 2011 for ads that it placed on a [[jumbotron]] in [[Times Square]].<ref>[http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2011/04/25/vaccine_ad_times_sqaure_poprx The ad that could help fuel a health crisis], [[Salon.com]], April 25, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/apr/18/anti-vaccine-advertisement-times-square Doctors demand the removal of anti-vaccine ad from Times Square], ''The Guardian''</ref>  The ads criticized childhood immunization and promoted an alternative medicine website.  In a letter to CBS, the owner of the jumbotron, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] stated, "By providing advertising space to an organization like the NVIC . . . you are putting thousands of lives of children at risk."<ref>[http://www.ncahf.org/digest11/11-10.html Consumer Health Digest #11-10], National Council Against Health Fraud, April 28, 2011</ref>

Another controversial ad produced by NVIC and aired on some of the flights on [[Delta Air Lines]] regarding preventive measures for influenza prompted the president of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] to write a letter to the CEO of Delta on Nov 4, 2011 and urged Delta to 'remove these harmful messages'.<ref name=Herper>Herper, Matthew [http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/11/07/pediatricians-group-slams-delta-airlines-for-running-video-made-by-vaccine-skeptics/''Pediatrician Group Slams Delta Airlines For Running Video Made By Vaccine Skeptics''], ''Forbes'', Nov. 7, 2011</ref><ref name=Khan>Khan, Amina [http://www.latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-vaccine-delta-nvic-change-petition-autism-20111115,0,7909757.story''Pediatricians decry in-flight vaccine-questioning ad on Delta''], ''Los Angeles Times'', Nov 16, 2011</ref>  An online petition is also set up to urge Delta to remove the ads.<ref name=Herper/><ref name=Khan/>

The refusal of Delta Air Lines to immediately stop showing the ad prompted the ''Institute for Science in Medicine'' to protest, calling the decision:

: "...indefensible from a public health perspective,..." and "The NVIC ad is, as one commentator aptly observed, a Trojan Horse. Delta passengers in November are being directed to the website of a prominent anti-vaccination organization, one that has tried to thwart national vaccine campaigns for three decades. Moreover, NVIC has the sort of name that sounds like a federal agency, one that passengers might mistake as a source of reliable information."<ref name=ISM>[http://scienceinmedicine.org/news/delta.html Delta’s Decision Doesn’t Fly with Us. Airline Continues to Show Anti-Vaccinationists’ Ad.] ''Institute for Science in Medicine'', Nov. 2011</ref>

While vaccines do occasionally cause mild adverse reactions (and rarely cause serious reactions), the infrequency of these reactions does little to offset the enormous benefits to public health that vaccines provide.<ref>[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/97vol23/23s4/23s4p_e.html Publication by the Canadian Government citing advice from the World Bank]</ref>
