'''''Trypanosoma''''' is a [[genus]] of [[kinetoplastid]]s (class Kinetoplastida), a [[monophyletic]]<ref name="Hamilton04">{{cite journal |author=Hamilton PB, Stevens JR, Gaunt MW, Gidley J, Gibson WC |title=Trypanosomes are monophyletic: evidence from genes for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and small subunit ribosomal RNA |journal=Int.

The name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''trypano'' (borer) and ''soma'' (body) because of their corkscrew-like motion. All trypanosomes are heteroxenous (requiring more than one obligatory host to complete life cycle) and most are transmitted via a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. The majority of species are transmitted by blood-feeding [[invertebrates]], but there are different mechanisms among the varying species. In an invertebrate host they are generally found in the [[intestine]], but normally occupy the [[bloodstream]] or an [[intracellular]] environment in the mammalian host.

Trypanosomes infect a variety of hosts and cause various diseases, including the fatal human diseases [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], caused by ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'', and [[Chagas disease]], caused by ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''.

The mitochondrial genome of the ''Trypanosoma'', as well as of other kinetoplastids, known as the [[kinetoplast]], is made up of a highly complex series of catenated circles and minicircles and requires a cohort of [[protein]]s for organisation during [[cell division]].

==History==

The first species of ''Trypanosoma'' identified was in a trout by [[Gabriel Valentin|Valentin]] in 1841. They were identified in mammals 50–80 years later.

==Selected species==

==Hosts, life cycle and morphologies==
{{See also|Trypanosomatid}}
[[File:TrypanosomatidMorphologies PlainSVG.svg|thumb|right|The six main morphologies of trypanosomatids.]]

Two different types of trypanosomes exist, and their life cycles are different, the salivarian species and the stercorarian species.

Stercorarian trypanosomes infect the insect, most often the [[Triatoma|triatomid kissing bug]], develop in its posterior gut and infective organisms are released in the feces and deposited on the skin of the host. The organism then penetrates and can disseminate throughout the body. Insects become infected when taking a blood meal.

Salivarian trypanosomes develop in the anterior gut of insects, most importantly the [[Tsetse fly]], and infective organisms are inoculated into the host by the insect bite before it feeds.

As trypanosomes progress through their life cycle they undergo a series of morphological changes as is typical of [[trypanosomatid]]s. The life cycle often consists of the [[trypomastigote]] form in the vertebrate host and the trypomastigote or [[promastigote]] form in the gut of the invertebrate host. Intracellular lifecycle stages are normally found in the [[amastigote]] form. The trypomastigote morphology is unique to species in the genus ''Trypanosoma''.
