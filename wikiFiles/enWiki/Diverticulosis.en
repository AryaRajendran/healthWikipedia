'''Diverticulosis''', also known as "'''diverticular disease'''", is the condition of having [[diverticulum|diverticula]] in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], which are outpocketings of the colonic [[mucosa]] and submucosa through weaknesses of [[muscle]] layers in the colon wall. These are more common in the [[sigmoid colon]], which is a common place for increased pressure. This is uncommon before the age of 40, and increases in incidence after that age.<ref name="pmid17468551">{{cite journal |author=Comparato G, Pilotto A, Franzè A, Franceschi M, Di Mario F |title=Diverticular disease in the elderly |journal=Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland) |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=151–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17468551 |doi=10.1159/000099480}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

Cramps and tenderness in the affected areas.

Most people with colonic diverticulosis are unaware of this structural change. When symptoms do appear in a person over 40 years of age it is important to obtain medical advice and exclude more dangerous conditions such as cancer of the colon or rectum.<ref>Shepherd NA (1992) Diverticular disease.

The clinical forms of colonic diverticulosis are:

===Uncomplicated diverticulosis===
Some patients with diverticulosis complain of symptoms such as cramping, bloating, flatulence, and irregular defecation. However, it is unclear if these symptoms are attributable to the underlying diverticulosis or to coexistent irritable bowel syndrome.
<ref name=Uptodate>{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-colonic-diverticular-disease?source=search_result&search=diverticulosis&selectedTitle=1~69|title=Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of colonic diverticular disease|work=Literature review}}</ref>

===Complicated colonic diverticulosis===
This is very uncommon but highly dangerous. The diverticula may bleed, either rapidly (causing bleeding through the rectum) or slowly (causing anemia). The diverticula can become infected and develop abscesses, or even perforate. These are serious complications and medical care is needed. Infected diverticula and development of abscesses merits the term [[diverticulitis]].  
First time bleeding from the rectum, especially in individuals aged  over age 40, could be due to colon cancer, colonic polyps and inflammatory bowel disease rather than  diverticulosis and requires clinical investigation.<ref>Eastwood MA (1987) Diverticular disease.

The exact [[etiology]] of colonic diverticulosis has yet to be fully clarified and many of the claims are only anecdotal.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.3748/wjg.15.2479 | last1 = Commane | first1 = DM | last2 = Arasaradnam | first2 = RP | last3 = Mills | first3 = S | last4 = Mathers | first4 = JC | last5 = Bradburn | first5 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Diet, ageing and genetic factors in the pathogenesis of diverticular disease | url = | journal = World J Gastroenterol | volume = 15 | issue = 20| pages = 2479–88 | pmid = 19468998 | pmc = 2686906 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181865f18 | last1 = Raskin | first1 = M | last2 = Raskin | year = 2008 | first2 = JB | title = History, incidence, and epidemiology of diverticulosis | url = | journal = J Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 42 | issue = 10| pages = 1125–7 | pmid = 18936648 }}</ref>
The modern emphasis on the value of fiber in the diet began with Cleave.<ref>Cleave TL 1974 The Saccharine disease Wright Bristol</ref> A strong case was made by Neil Painter<ref>Painter NS (1975) Diverticular disease of the colon. Heinemann Medical Books</ref> and Adam Smith<ref>Smith AN (1991) Diverticular disease of the colon in The Large Intestine ed Philllips SF, Pemberton JH and Shorter RG Raven Press pp549-578</ref> that a deficiency of dietary fiber is the cause of diverticular disease. They argued that the colonic muscles needed to contract strongly in order to transmit and expel the small stool associated with a fiber deficient diet.  The increased pressure within the segmented section of bowel  over years gave rise to herniation at  the vulnerable point where blood vessels enter the colonic wall.

However, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) considers the fiber theory "unproven."<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/magazine/issues/winter10/articles/winter10pg20-21.html Understanding Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis - NIH MedicinePlus]</ref> Furthermore, a February, 2012, study in the journal ''Gastroenterology'' found that "''A high-fiber diet and increased frequency of bowel movements are associated with greater, rather than lower, prevalence of diverticulosis.''"<ref name="Peery"> </ref> The study involved 2,104 participants, 30–80 years old, who underwent outpatient colonoscopies from 1998 to 2010 and were interviewed regarding diet and physical activity. 

[[Denis Burkitt]] suggested that the mechanical properties of the colon may be different in the African and the European subjects. He theorized that because Africans eat a diet containing more fiber than Europeans and [[Human defecation postures|use the natural squatting position for defecation]], they pass bulky stools without straining, and hence rarely if ever develop colonic diverticulosis.<ref>Burkitt DP & Trowell HC, editors (1975)  Refined Carbohydrate Foods and Disease. Some Implications of Dietary Fibre. London: Academic Press</ref>

Change in the  strength of the colonic wall with age may be an aetiological factor.<ref>Eastwood MA (1998) Structure and function of the colon. In Encyclopedia of Human Nutrition, pp. 945-953 [MJ Sadler, JJ Strain and B Caballero, editors). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.</ref> [[Connective tissue]] is a significant contributor to the strength of the colonic wall. The mechanical properties of connective tissue depend on a wide variety of factors, the type of tissue and its age, the nature of the intramolecular and intermolecular covalent cross links and the quantity of the glycosaminoglycans associated with the [[collagen]] fibrils. The submucosa of the colon is composed almost entirely of collagen, both type I and type III.  Several layers of collagen fibres make up the submucosa of the human colon.  The collagen fibril diameters and fibril counts are different between the left and right colon and  change with  age and  in colonic diverticulosis,.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = HG | last2 = Busuttil | first2 = A | last3 = Eastwood | first3 = MA | last4 = Smith | first4 = AN | last5 = Elton | first5 = RA | year = 1987 | title = Submucosal collagen changes in the normal colon and in diverticular disease | url = | journal = International Journal of Colorectal Disease | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 208–213 |pmid = 3694019|doi=10.1007/BF01649507 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1978.0107 |pages=305–321 |issue=1152 |volume=203 |last1=Parry |year=1978 |pmid=33395 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The strength of the colon decreases with age in all parts of the colon, except the ascending colon. The fall in tensile strength with age is  due to a decrease in the integrity of connective tissue.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/gut.26.4.384 | last1 = Watter | first1 = D.A.K. | last2 = Smith | first2 = A.N. | last3 = Eastwood | first3 = M.A. | last4 = Anderson | first4 = K.C. | last5 = Elton | first5 = R.A. | last6 = Mugerwa | first6 = J.W. | year = 1985 | title = Mechanical properties of the colon:  comparison of the features of the African and European colon in vitro | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 384–392 | pmid = 3920126 | pmc = 1432523 }}</ref>   Cross linkage of collagen is increased in colonic diverticulosis. The mucosal layer is possibly more elastic and it is likely that the stiffer external layers break and allow the elastic mucosa to herniate through forming a diverticulum. Collagen has intermolecular and intramolecular cross links which stabilise and give strength to the tissue in which it is located.  Accumulation of covalently linked sugar molecules and related increasing cross linking products are found in a variety of tissues with ageing, skin, vascular tissue, the cordae tendinae of heart valves and the colon.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/gut.37.1.91 | last1 = Wess | first1 = L | last2 = Eastwood | first2 = MA | last3 = Wess | first3 = TJ | last4 = Busuttil | first4 = A | last5 = Miller | first5 = A | year = 1995 | title = Cross linkage of collagen is increased in colonic diverticulosis | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 91–94 | pmid = 7672689 | pmc = 1382775 }}</ref> This reduces the strength and pliability of the collagen.

Colonic diverticulosis is in general a benign condition of the bowel which uncommonly becomes symptomatic and even less commonly becomes a truly clinical complicated problem.

==Diagnosis==
In cases of asymptomatic diverticulosis, the diagnosis is usually made as an incidental finding on other investigations.

While a good history is often sufficient to form a diagnosis of diverticulosis or diverticulitis, it is important to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathology (notably colorectal cancer) and complications.

'''Investigations'''
* Plain Abdominal X-ray may show signs of a thickened wall, ileus, constipation, small bowel obstruction or free air in the case of perforation. Plain X-rays are insufficient to diagnose diverticular disease.
* Contrast CT is the investigation of choice in acute episodes of diverticulitis and where complications exist.
* Colonoscopy will show the diverticulum and rule out malignancy. A colonoscopy should be performed 4–6 weeks after an acute episode.
* Barium enema is inferior to colonoscopy in terms of image quality and is usually only performed if the patient has strictures or an excessively tortuous sigmoid colon where colonoscopy is difficult or dangerous.
* MRI provides a clear picture of the soft tissue of the abdomen, however its expense often outweighs the benefits when compared to contrast CT or colonoscopy.
* There is no blood test for diverticulosis.

It is important to note that both barium enema and colonoscopy are contraindicated during acute episodes of diverticulitis, as the barium may leak out into the abdominal cavity, and colonoscopy can cause perforations of the bowel wall.

==Management==
 
Many patients with diverticulosis have minimal to no symptoms, and do not require any specific treatment. A high-fiber diet and fiber supplements are advisable to prevent constipation .<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aldoori | first1 = WH | last2 = Giovannucci | first2 = EL | last3 = Rimm | first3 = EB | last4 = Wing | first4 = AL | last5 = Trichopoulos | first5 = DV | last6 = Willett | first6 = WC | title = A prospective study of diet and the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease in men | url = http://www.ajcn.orgicgilreprint!60/5/757 | journal = The American journal of clinical nutrition | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 757–64 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7942584 }}</ref>

Ispaghula is also effective at  1-2&nbsp;grams a day.  Colonic stimulants should be avoided. 
The [http://www.niddk.nih.gov National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases] (NIDDK) says foods such as nuts, popcorn hulls, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, caraway seeds, and sesame seeds have traditionally been labeled as problem foods for people with this condition; however, no scientific data exists to prove this hypothesis. The seeds in tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers, strawberries, raspberries, and poppy seeds, are not considered harmful by the NIDDK. Treatments, like some colon cleansers, that cause hard stools, constipation, and straining, are not recommended. 
Some doctors also recommend avoidance of fried foods, nuts, corn, and seeds to prevent complications of diverticulosis. Whether these diet restrictions are beneficial is uncertain; recent studies have stated that nuts and popcorn do not contribute positively or negatively to patients with diverticulosis or diverticular complications.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.300.8.907 | last1 = Strate | first1 = LL | last2 = Liu | first2 = YL | last3 = Syngal | first3 = S | last4 = Aldoori | first4 = WH | last5 = Giovannucci | first5 = EL | year = 2008 | title = Nut, Corn, and Popcorn Consumption and the Incidence of Diverticular Disease | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 300 | issue = 8| pages = 907–914 | pmid = 18728264 | pmc = 2643269 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Eating Nuts, Popcorn Not Linked With Higher Risk of Diverticulosis |work=Newswise |accessdate= 26 August 2008 | url = http://www.newswise.com/articles/eating-nuts-popcorn-not-linked-with-higher-risk-of-diverticulosis | date= 21 August 2008 }}</ref> When the spasm pain is troublesome the use of peppermint oil (1 drop in 50 ml water), or peppermint tablets (e.g., colpermin), can be helpful.<ref>citation need</ref>
'''Complicated diverticulosis''' requires treatment of the complication. These complications are often grouped under a single diagnosis of [[diverticulitis]] and require skilled medical care of the infection, bleeding and perforation which may include intensive antibiotic treatment, intravenous fluids and surgery.  Complications are more common in patients who are taking NSAIDS or aspirin.  As diverticulosis occurs in an older population such complications are serious events.

==Complications==
Infection of a diverticulum can result in [[diverticulitis]]. This occurs in 10%-25% of people with diverticulosis (NIDDK website). Tears in the colon leading to bleeding or perforations may occur; intestinal obstruction may occur (constipation or diarrhea does not rule this possibility out); and [[peritonitis]], [[abscess]] formation, [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] [[fibrosis]], [[sepsis]], and [[fistula]] formation are also possible occurrences.  Rarely, an [[enterolith]] may form. 

Low fiber, high fat diet, constipation and use of stimulant laxatives increase the risk of bleeding, also history of diverticulitis increases the chance to bleed.

Infection of a diverticulum often occurs as a result of stool collecting in a diverticulum.

More than 10% of the U.S. population over the age of 40 and 50% over the age of 60 has diverticulosis. This disease is common in the U.S., Britain, Australia, Canada, and is uncommon in Asia and Africa.<ref name="pmid17468551" /><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/gut.26.6.544 | last1 = Manousos | first1 = O | last2 = Day | first2 = NE | last3 = Tzonou | first3 = A | last4 = Papadimitriou | first4 = C | last5 = Kapetanakis | first5 = A | last6 = Polychronopoulou-Trichopoulou | first6 = A | last7 = Trichopoulos | first7 = D | title = Diet and other factors in the aetiology of diverticulosis: an epidemiological study in Greece | journal = Gut | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 544–9 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3924745 | pmc = 1432747 }}</ref> Large-mouth diverticula are associated with [[scleroderma]].
