==Political career==
[[File:Lord-darzi 681165e.jpg|thumb|left|168px|Lord Darzi speaking at the Labour Party Conference in 2008]]

On 29 June 2007 Darzi was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the [[House of Lords]] at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Gordon Brown]]. He was duly raised to the peerage on 12 July 2007 as '''Baron Darzi of Denham''', of Gerrards Cross in the County of [[Buckinghamshire]]. His appointment was part of Gordon Brown's "Government of all talents."<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brown-completes-government-of-all-talents-with-team-of-outsiders-455341.html</ref>

Prior to his appointment in the House of Lords, in December 2006 NHS London asked Darzi to "develop a strategy to meet Londoners' health needs over the next five to ten years". The report Healthcare for London: A Framework for Action was published on 11 July 2007.<ref name="Httpwwwhealthcareforlondonnhsukframeworkforaction">http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/a-framework-for-action-2/</ref>  Recommendations included the development of academic health science centres and the introduction of polyclinics.

As Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Health, Darzi was charged with leading a Review to determine the course of the NHS over the decade ahead, reporting back to the Prime Minister, Chancellor, and Secretary of State for Health in June 2008. The process was described as the “NHS Next Stage Review”.<ref>[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085937 NHS Next Stage Review: Our vision for primary and community care : Department of Health - Publications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Darzi was quoted in The Times Newspaper as saying that “...his Review should be both {{Sic|?|hide=y|clinically|-}}led and evidence-based”.  The final report of the Review, High Quality Care for All, was published in June 2008 to considerable public and academic acclaim. The Financial Times noted that it was “the world’s most ambitious attempt to raise the quality and effectiveness of an entire nation’s healthcare”.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f88f09a-4707-11dd-876a-0000779fd2ac.html NHS plans to raise quality of care - FT.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Lancet acknowledged that:

"Darzi has wisely thrown out regulation as the organising principle of the NHS. He has replaced it with quality...This cultural shift is a radical re-visioning of purpose for the NHS—away from the political command and control of processes and towards professional responsibility for clinical outcomes."<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T1B-4SWYBM2-4&_user=217827&_coverDate=07%2F11%2F2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1297416763&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000011279&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=217827&md5=8e9c50278dde4d1a58651b3e24f21ac0 ScienceDirect.com - The Lancet - The Darzi vision: quality, engagement, and professionalism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Through his report, academics have suggested that Darzi has updated traditional notions of professionalism and described a new accountability in clinical practice. Following publication, Darzi remained in his ministerial post. At that time a Department for Health spokesperson was quoted as saying that his revised role would “...ensure the successful implementation of the Review’s conclusions. Notably, frontline clinical staff will be given more control over budgets, and his proposals will mean that every provider of NHS services will be required to publish Quality Accounts from April 2010”.

[[File:Darzi1-1-.jpg|thumb|right|168px|Lord Darzi Operating]]

As a government minister, Darzi found himself responsible for leading the passage of health-related legislation through the House of Lords.

Darzi’s leadership as a health minister was the culmination of many years of involvement in health policy. Immediately prior to joining the government, Darzi led a review of health services in London, identifying the opportunities to raise clinical quality across the capital.<ref name="Httpwwwhealthcareforlondonnhsukframeworkforaction" /> He was also National Advisor in Surgery to the Department of Health. Darzi’s report in this role ‘Saws and Scalpels to Lasers and Robots: Clinical case for change’ (April 2007), argued for a change to the way surgery is organised in order to maximise patient benefits.<ref>[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_073904 Saws and scalpels to lasers and robots advances in surgery : Department of Health - Publications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In June 2009 Darzi was appointed as a member of Her Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Council.<ref>http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page76.asp#d</ref>

In July 2009, Darzi relinquished his post as Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Department of Health. The Prime Minister praised his “outstanding contribution”.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/gordon-brown/5829189/Lord-Darzi-resigns-full-text-of-letters-exchanged-with-Gordon-Brown.html Lord Darzi resigns: full text of letters exchanged with Gordon Brown - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the Guardian noted that:

"Instead of waging war on the medics, as his Blairite predecessors had done, Darzi invited them to take a hand in designing their own targets and bound them into reform. He stressed the quality of care after Labour's decade-long obsession with quantity. And while the drive for private involvement continued, it took a less dogmatic turn. The NHS's morale improved, as did its public standing."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/16/ara-darzi In praise of ... Ara Darzi | Editorial | Comment is free | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Following his resignation from Government, Darzi returned to his clinical and academic work and has expanded his involvement in global health issues. In June 2010 he was appointed Chairman of the Institute for Global Health Innovation at Imperial College, a body dedicated to improving healthcare around the world and reducing health inequalities in developed and developing countries.<ref>[http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/secretariat/collegeinfo/collegenotices%200708/09-10/instituteofglobalhealthinnovation Error<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In November 2010 he was appointed as a Business Ambassador for the UK by Prime Minister David Cameron.<ref>[http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/press-notices/2010/11/pm-announces-new-business-ambassadors-56764 PM announces new Business Ambassadors Number 10<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
