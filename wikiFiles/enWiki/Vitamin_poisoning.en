'''Hypervitaminosis''' refers to a condition of high storage levels of [[vitamin]]s, which can lead to [[toxicity|toxic]] [[symptom]]s.  The medical names of the different conditions are derived from the vitamin involved: an excess of vitamin A, for example, is called [[hypervitaminosis A]].

Generally, toxic levels of vitamins are achieved through high supplement intake and not from dietary sources. Toxicities of fat-soluble vitamins can also be caused by a large intake of highly [[Food fortification|fortified]] foods, but foods rarely deliver dangerous levels of fat-soluble vitamins.<ref name="candc"/>

The [[Dietary Reference Intake]] recommendations from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] define  a "tolerable upper intake level" for most vitamins.

High dosage [[vitamin A]]; high dosage, slow release [[Vitamin B3|vitamin B<sub>3</sub>]]; and very high dosage [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] alone (i.e.  without vitamin B complex) are sometimes associated with vitamin side effects that usually rapidly cease with supplement reduction or cessation.

==Fat soluble==
With few exceptions, like some vitamins from B complex, hypervitaminosis usually occurs more with fat-soluble vitamins, which are stored in the liver and fatty tissues of the body.  These vitamins build up and remain for a longer time in the body than water soluble vitamins.<ref name="candc">{{cite book|last=Sizer|first=Frances Sienkiewicz|coauthors=Ellie Whitney|title=Nutrition: Concepts and Controversies|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=United States of America|year=2008|edition=11|pages=221, 235|isbn=0-495-39065-8}}</ref>

Conditions include:
* [[Hypervitaminosis A]]
* [[Hypervitaminosis D]]
* [[Hypervitaminosis E]]
* [[Hypervitaminosis K]]{{cn|date=October 2012}}

==Minerals==
High doses of mineral supplements can also lead to side effects and toxicity.  Mineral-supplement poisoning does occur occasionally, most often due to excessive intake of iron-containing supplements.

== Comparative safety statistics ==
In the United States, overdose exposure to all formulations of "vitamins" was reported by 62,562 individuals in 2004 (nearly 80%(~78%, n=48,989) of these exposures were in children under the age of 6), leading to 53 "major" life-threatening outcomes and 3 deaths(2 from Vitamins - D and E; 1 from polyvitaminic type formula, with iron and no fluoride).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.poison.org/prevent/documents/TESS%20Annual%20Report%202004.pdf | title = Annual Report | publisher = [[American Association of Poison Control Centers]] | author = Toxic Exposure Surveillance System | format = pdf | year = 2004 }}</ref> This may be compared to the 19,250 people who died of unintentional poisoning of all kinds in the U.S. in the same year (2004).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/acc-inj.htm | title = National Center for Health Statistics}}</ref>  In 2010, 71,000 exposures to various vitamins and multivitamin-mineral formulations were reported to poison control centers, which resulted in 15 major reactions but no deaths.<ref>{{cite pmid | 22165864}}</ref> 

Before 1998, several deaths per year were  associated with pharmaceutical iron-containing supplements, especially brightly colored, [[sugar]]-coated, high-potency [[iron]] supplements, and most deaths were [[child]]ren.<ref name=Tenenbein>{{cite journal |author=Tenenbein M |title=Unit-dose packaging of iron supplements and reduction of iron poisoning in young children |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=159 |issue=6 |pages=557–60 |year=2005 |pmid=15939855 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.159.6.557 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/159/6/557}}</ref> Unit packaging restrictions on supplements with more than 30&nbsp;mg of iron have since reduced deaths to 0 or 1 per year.<ref name=Tenenbein/> These statistics compare with 59 confirmed deaths due to [[aspirin]] poisoning in 2003 <ref name=aapcc>{{cite journal |author=Watson WA, Litovitz TL, Klein-Schwartz W, ''et al.'' |title=2003 annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=335–404 |year=2004 |pmid=15490384 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2004.06.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S073567570400141X}}</ref> and 147 deaths known to be associated with [[acetaminophen]]-containing products in 2003.<ref name=aapcc/>
