The '''buccinator''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|k|s|ɪ|n|eɪ|t|ər}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buccinator Entry "buccinator"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>
) is a thin quadrilateral muscle, occupying the interval between the [[maxilla]] and the [[Human mandible|mandible]] at the side of the face.  

==Action==
Its purpose is to pull back the angle of the mouth and to flatten the cheek area, which aids in holding the cheek to the teeth during chewing.

It aids [[whistling]] and [[smiling]], and in [[neonates]] it is used to [[Breastfeeding|suckle]].

==Origin and insertion==
It arises from the outer surfaces of the [[alveolar processes]] of the maxilla and [[Human mandible|mandible]], corresponding to the three pairs of [[molar teeth]]; and behind, from the anterior border of the [[pterygomandibular raphé]] which separates it from the [[constrictor pharyngis superior]]. 

The fibers converge toward the angle of the mouth, where the central fibers intersect each other, those from below being continuous with the upper segment of the [[orbicularis oris]], and those from above with the lower segment; the upper and lower fibers are continued forward into the corresponding [[lip]] without decussation.

==Innervation==
Motor innervation is from the buccal branch of the [[facial nerve]] (cranial nerve VII).
