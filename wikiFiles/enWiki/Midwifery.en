'''Midwifery''' is a [[health care]] profession in which providers offer care to childbearing women during pregnancy, labour and birth, and during the postpartum period. They also help care for the newborn and assist the mother with breastfeeding.

A practitioner of midwifery is known as a '''midwife''', a term used in reference to both women and men, although the majority of midwives are female.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/midwife "Midwife"]. ''Dictionary.com''.</ref> In addition to providing care to women during pregnancy and birth, many midwives also provide [[primary care]] to women, well-woman care related to reproductive health, annual [[gynecology|gynecological]] exams, [[family planning]], and [[menopausal]] care.

In the term ''midwife'', the [[morpheme]] ''-wife'' is pronounced as expected ({{IPAc-en|icon|w|aɪ|f}}), but ''midwifery'' is normally pronounced {{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|d|ˈ|w|ɪ|f|ᵊ|r|i}} ({{Respell|mid|WIF|(ə)ree}}).<ref>Webster's New World Dictionary, Fourth Edition, p. 912.  Compare ''divine'' and ''divinity''.</ref> 

Midwives are specialists in low-risk pregnancy, [[childbirth]], and [[postpartum]], although they are trained to recognize and deal with deviations from the norm as well as certain high risk situations. [[Obstetricians]], in contrast, are specialists in illness related to [[childbearing]] and in [[surgery]].<ref name="business-being-born">{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/movies/09born.html|title=The Business of Being Born (film)|last=Epstein|first=Abby|accessdate=2009-10-30 | work=The New York Times | date=January 9, 2008}}</ref> The two professions can be complementary, but may be at odds in some countries, where obstetricians are taught to "actively manage" labor, while midwives are taught not to intervene unless necessary.  Most midwives are familiar with the process of physiological management and the use of gravity in aiding the process of labor.<ref>Wagner, Marsden.

Accessed 3-27-07.</ref>

Midwives refer women to [[general practitioners]] or [[obstetricians]] when a pregnant woman requires care beyond the midwives' area of expertise. In many parts of the world, these professions work together to provide care to childbearing women. In others, only the midwife is available to provide care. Midwives are trained to handle certain more difficult deliveries, including [[breech birth]]s, [[twin birth]]s and births where the baby is in a [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] position, using non-invasive techniques.

For low risk births, compared with obstetricians, midwives offer lower maternity care cost, lower intervention rates, reduced mortality and morbidity as a result of fewer interventions, and fewer recovery complications.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schlenzka|first=P|title=Safety of Alternative Approaches to Childbirth|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University}}</ref>

==Definition==
[[File:Eucharius Rößlin Rosgarten Childbirth.jpg|thumb|right|A woman giving birth on a birth chair, from a work by [[Eucharius Rößlin]].]]

According to the [[International Confederation of Midwives]] (a definition that has also been adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]]):
{{quote|A midwife is a person who, having been regularly admitted to a midwifery educational program that is duly recognized in the country in which it is located, has successfully completed the prescribed course of studies in midwifery and has acquired the requisite qualifications to be registered and/or legally licensed to practice midwifery.}}

The midwife is recognized as a responsible and accountable professional who works in partnership with women to give the necessary support, care and advice during pregnancy, labor and the postpartum period, to conduct births on the midwife's own responsibility and to provide care for the infant. This care includes preventive measures, the promotion of normal birth, the detection of complications in mother and child, accessing of medical or other appropriate assistance and the carrying out of emergency measures.

The midwife has an important task in health counseling and education, not only for the woman, but also within the family and community. This work should involve antenatal education and preparation for parenthood and may extend to women's health, sexual or reproductive health and childcare, and to gain the knowledge to counteract the lack of pain relievers and antiseptics.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

A midwife may practice in any setting including in the home, the community, hospitals, clinics or health units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalknowledgeinstitute.com/files/ICM%20Definition%20of%20the%20Midwife%202005.pdf |title=Definition of the Midwife}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/lives/lives_newsletter_2006_2_english.pdf |title=The Newsletter of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health |Volume=2 |date=January 2006|ISSN=1815-9184}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The term ''midwife'' is derived from,{{lang-enm|midwyf}} literally "with-woman", i.e. "the woman with (the mother at birth), the woman assisting"<ref>Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition, p. 912.</ref> (in [[Middle English]] and [[Old English]], ''mid'' = "with", ''wīf'' = "woman").

In this context, the word ''wife'' means ''woman'' rather than ''married woman''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=midwife&searchmode=none |accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref> This usage stems from Old English wif (woman) and is akin to the German weib, also meaning "woman". This sense of the word is still used in Modern English in constructions such as [[fishwife]] and [[old wives' tale]].

==Early historical perspective==
{{See also|Midwifery in the Middle Ages}}
Midwives are mentioned in the Old Testament: Exodus, Chapter 1.  The Bible describes how the children of Israel (Hebrews) were enslaved in Egypt and they multiplied greatly.  The Egyptians became fearful of the potential power of so many Hebrews.  Pharaoh, therefore, commanded the Hebrew midwives (named Shiphrah and Puah) to kill all male babies delivered to the Hebrew women.  The midwives, however, "feared God" and disobeyed Pharaoh by allowing the male babies to live.  When Pharaoh asked the midwives why they had disobeyed his orders, the midwives told him the Hebrew women had easier labors than Egyptian women and delivered their babies before the midwife arrived.  "And God dealt well with the midwives" (Exodus, Chap. 1, verse 20).

In [[ancient Egypt]], midwifery was a recognized female occupation, as attested by the [[Ebers papyrus]] which dates from 1900 to 1550 BCE. Five columns of this papyrus deal with [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics and gynecology]], especially concerning the acceleration of parturition and the birth prognosis of the newborn. The [[Westcar Papyrus|Westcar papyrus]], dated to 1700 BCE, includes instructions for calculating the expected date of confinement and describes different styles of birth chairs. Bas reliefs in the royal birth rooms at Luxor and other temples also attest to the heavy presence of midwifery in this culture.<ref name="TowlerBramall-9">Jean Towler and Joan Bramall, ''Midwives in History and Society'' (London: Croom Helm, 1986), p. 9</ref>

Midwifery in [[Greco-Roman]] antiquity covered a wide range of women, including old women who continued folk medical traditions in the villages of [[Roman Empire|the Roman Empire]], trained midwives who garnered their knowledge from a variety of sources, and highly trained women who were considered female physicians.<ref name="Flemming-359">Rebecca Flemming, ''Medicine and the Making of Roman Women'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000), p. 359</ref> However, there were certain characteristics desired in a “good” midwife, as described by the physician [[Soranus of Ephesus]] in the 2nd century. He states in his work, ''Gynecology'', that “a suitable person will be literate, with her wits about her, possessed of a good memory, loving work, respectable and generally not unduly handicapped as regards her senses [i.e., sight, smell, hearing], sound of limb, robust, and, according to some people, endowed with long slim fingers and short nails at her fingertips.” Soranus also recommends that the midwife be of sympathetic disposition (although she need not have borne a child herself) and that she keep her hands soft for the comfort of both mother and child.<ref name="French-69-84">Valerie French, “Midwives and Maternity Care in the Roman World” (Helios, New Series 12(2), 1986), pp. 69-84</ref> Pliny, another physician from this time, valued nobility and a quiet and inconspicuous disposition in a midwife.<ref name="Jackson-97">Ralph Jackson, ''Doctors and Diseases in the Roman Empire'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1988), p. 97</ref> A woman who possessed this combination of physique, virtue, skill, and education must have been difficult to find in antiquity. Consequently, there appears to have been three “grades” of midwives present in [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. The first was technically proficient; the second may have read some of the texts on obstetrics and gynecology; but the third was highly trained and reasonably considered a [[medical specialist]] with a concentration in midwifery.<ref name="Jackson-97" />

[[Agnodice]] or Agnodike (Gr. Ἀγνοδίκη) was the earliest historical, and likely apocryphal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/antiqua/women.cfm |title=Women in Medicine |publisher=www.hsl.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> midwife mentioned among the ancient Greeks.{{Cite book  | last = Greenhill  | first = William Alexander  | author-link =   | contribution = Agnodice  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | page = 74  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0083.html  | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>  

Midwives were known by many different titles in antiquity, ranging from ''iatrinē'' (Gr. [[nurse]]), ''maia'' (Gr., midwife), ''obstetrix'' (Lat., [[obstetrician]]), and ''medica'' (Lat., [[physician|doctor]]).<ref name="Flemming-421-424">Rebecca Flemming, Medicine and the Making of Roman Women (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 421-424</ref> It appears as though midwifery was treated differently in the Eastern end of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]] as opposed to the West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of midwife (''maia'') to that of gynaecologist (''iatros gynaikeios'', translated as ''women's doctor''), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman legal provisions strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors.<ref name="French-69-84" /> One example of such a midwife is [[Salpe of Lemnos]], who wrote on women’s diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.<ref name="Jackson-97" />

However, in the Roman West, our knowledge of practicing midwives comes mainly from funerary epitaphs. Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at a small sample of these epitaphs. The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin. Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom. It is not known from these epitaphs how certain slave women were selected for training as midwives. [[Slave]] girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.<ref name="French-69-84" />

The actual duties of the midwife in antiquity consisted mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the midwife would call for the assistance of a physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the midwife brought along two or three assistants.<ref name="Towler-Bramall-12">Towler and Bramall, p.12</ref> In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her.<ref name="French-69-84" /> The midwife sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards on the top of the mother's abdomen.

Finally, the midwife received the infant, placed it in pieces of cloth, cut the [[umbilical cord]], and cleansed the baby.<ref name="Jackson-97" /> The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put [[olive oil]] in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call on whether or not an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformities]] and testing its cry to hear whether or not it was robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.<ref name="French-69-84" />

A 2nd-century terracotta relief from the Ostian tomb of Scribonia Attice, wife of physician-surgeon M. Ulpius Amerimnus, details a childbirth scene. Scribonia was a midwife and the relief shows her in the midst of a delivery. A patient sits in the [[birth chair]], gripping the handles and the midwife’s assistant stands behind her providing support. Scribonia sits on a low stool in front of the woman, modestly looking away while also assisting the delivery by dilating and massaging the vagina, as encouraged by Soranus.<ref name="Jackson-97" />

The services of a midwife were not inexpensive; this fact that suggests poorer women who could not afford the services of a professional midwife often had to make do with female relatives. Many wealthier families had their own midwives. However, the vast majority of women in the Greco-Roman world very likely received their maternity care from hired midwives. They may have been highly trained or only possessed a rudimentary knowledge of obstetrics. Also, many families had a choice of whether or not they wanted to employ a midwife who practiced the traditional [[folk medicine]] or the newer methods of professional parturition.<ref name="French-69-84" /> Like a lot of other factors in antiquity, quality gynecological care often depended heavily on the socioeconomic status of the patient.

==Later historical perspective==
In the early 20th century, a conflict between [[surgeon]]s and midwives arose, as medical men began to assert that their modern scientific techniques were better for mothers and infants than the [[folk medicine]] practiced by midwives.<ref name=Ehrenreich>{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Witches, Midwives and Nurses: A History of Women Healers|year=2010|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=0-912670-13-4|pages=85–87|edition=2nd|coauthors=Deirdre English}}</ref> As doctors and medical associations pushed for a legal monopoly on obstetrical care, midwifery became outlawed or heavily regulated throughout the United States and Canada.<ref name=Ehrenreich/><ref name=Rooks1997>{{cite book|last=Rooks|first=Judith Pence|title=Midwifery and childbirth in America|year=1997|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1-56639-711-1|page=422}}</ref> Despite accusations that midwives were "incompetent and ignorant",<ref>{{cite book|last=Varney|first=Helen|title=Varney's midwifery|year=2004|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=0-7637-1856-4|edition=4th|page=7}}</ref> some argued that poorly trained surgeons were far more of a danger to pregnant women.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=J. Whitridge|title=The Midwife Problem and Medical Education in the United States|journal=American Association for Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality: Transactions of the Second Annual Meeting|year=1912|pages=165–194}}</ref>

German [[Social sciences|social scientists]] [[Gunnar Heinsohn]] and {{Ill|de|Otto Steiger|Otto Steiger (Wirtschaftswissenschaftler)}} theorize that midwifery became a target of persecution and repression by public authorities because midwives not only possessed highly specialized knowledge and skills regarding assisting birth, but also regarding contraception and abortion.<ref>Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: "Witchcraft, Population Catastrophe and Economic Crisis in Renaissance Europe: An Alternative Macroeconomic Explanation.", [[University of Bremen]] 2004 [http://www.scribd.com/doc/54474527 (download)]; {{cite journal |first=Gunnar |last=Heinsohn |first2=Otto |last2=Steiger |title=The Elimination of Medieval Birth Control and the [[Witch trial|Witch Trials]] of Modern Times |journal=International Journal of Women's Studies |volume=3 |month=May |year=1982 |issue= |pages=193–214 |doi= }} {{cite journal |first=Gunnar |last=Heinsohn |first2=Otto |last2=Steiger |title=Birth Control: The Political-Economic Rationale Behind Jean Bodin's 'Démonomanie' |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=423–448 |doi=10.1215/00182702-31-3-423 |pmid=21275210}}</ref> According to Heinsohn and Steiger's theory, the state persecuted the midwives as [[witches]] in an effort to repopulate the European continent which had suffered severe loss of manpower as a result of [[Bubonic plague|the bubonic plague]] which had swept over the continent in waves, starting in 1348.

==United States==
{{Main|Midwifery in the United States}}

There are two main divisions of modern [[midwifery in the United States]]: nurse-midwives and direct-entry midwives.

===Nurse-midwives===
[[File:Midwives with Amy and Austin.jpg|thumb|Two Certified Nurse Midwives from Colorado pose with new mother and her son, born at Presbyterian-St. Lukes Medical Center in Denver.]]

Nurse-midwives were introduced in the [[United States]] in 1925 by [[Mary Carson Breckinridge|Mary Breckinridge]] for use in the [[Frontier Nursing Service]] (FNS). Breckinridge chose the nurse-midwifery model used in [[England]] and [[Scotland]] because she expected these nurse-midwives on horseback to serve the health care needs of the families living in the remote hills of eastern [[Kentucky]]. This combination of nurse and midwife was very successful. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company studied the first seven years of the service and reported a substantially lower maternal and [[infant mortality]] rate than for the rest of the country. The report concluded that if this type of care was available to other women in America, thousands of lives would be saved, and suggested nurse-midwife training should be made available in the United States. The Maternity Center Association and the Lobenstine Clinic opened the first nurse-midwifery school in the United States, which later closed.<ref name="mymidwife.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.mymidwife.org/A-Brief-History-of-Nurse-Midwifery-in-the-U-S |title=A Brief History of Nurse-Midwifery in the U.S |publisher=Mymidwife.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> Breckinridge founded the [[Frontier Nursing University]] in 1939, the second nurse-midwifery education program in the United States, which is still open today.<ref name="mymidwife.org"/>

The Frontier School is still educating nurse-midwives and has added distance learning to its methodology. In 1989 the program became the first distance option for nurses to become nurse-midwives without leaving their home communities. The students do their academic work on-line with the Frontier Nursing University faculty members and they do their clinical practice with a nurse-midwife in their community who is credentialed by Frontier as a clinical faculty member. This community based model has graduated over 1500 nurse-midwives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontier.edu |title=Frontier Nursing University - Distance Education from the Birthplace of Nurse-Midwifery and Family Nursing in America |publisher=Frontier.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>

In the United States, [[Nurse midwife|nurse-midwives]] are variably licensed depending on the state as advanced practice [[nurse]]s, midwives or nurse-midwives. Certified Nurse-Midwives are educated in both nursing and midwifery and provide gynecological and midwifery care of relatively healthy women. In addition to licensing, many nurse-midwives have a master's degree in nursing, [[public health]], or midwifery. Nurse-midwives practice in [[hospital]]s, [[medical clinic]]s and private offices and may deliver babies in hospitals, birth centers and at home. They are able to prescribe medications in all 50 states. Nurse-midwives provide care to women from [[puberty]] through [[menopause]]. Nurse-midwives may work closely with obstetricians, who provide consultation and assistance to patients who develop complications. Often, women with high risk [[Pregnancy|pregnancies]] can receive the benefits of midwifery care from a nurse-midwife in collaboration with a physician. Currently, 2% of nurse-midwives are men. The [[American College of Nurse-Midwives]] accredits nurse-midwifery/midwifery education programs and serves as the national [[professional society]] for the nation's certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives. Upon graduation from these programs, graduates sit for a certification exam administered by the [[American Midwifery Certification Board]].{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Direct-entry midwives=== <!--[[CPM]] links here-->
A direct-entry midwife is educated in the discipline of midwifery in a program or path that does not require prior education as a nurse. Direct-entry midwives learn midwifery through [[Autodidacticism|self-study]], apprenticeship, a private midwifery school, or a college- or university-based program distinct from the discipline of nursing. A direct-entry midwife is trained to provide the Midwives Model of Care<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfmidwifery.org/mmoc/define.aspx |title=Midwives Model of Care}}</ref> to healthy women and newborns throughout the childbearing cycle primarily in out-of-hospital settings.

Under the umbrella of "direct-entry midwife" are several types of midwives:

A '''Certified Professional Midwife''' (CPM) is a professional independent midwifery practitioner who has met the standards for certification set by the North American Registry of Midwives<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.narm.org/ |title=North American Registry of Midwives}}</ref> (NARM) and is qualified to provide the midwives model of care. The CPM is the only US credential that requires knowledge about and experience in out-of-hospital settings. As of November 2010, there are approximately 1800 CPMs practicing in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://narm.org/certification/current-status/ |title=Current Status |publisher=NARM |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>

A '''Licensed Midwife''' is a midwife who is licensed to practice in a particular state. Currently, licensure for direct-entry midwives is available in 27 states as of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mana.org/statechart.html |title=Direct-Entry Midwifery State-by-State Legal Status |publisher=Mana.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>

The term '''"Lay Midwife"''' has been used to designate an uncertified or unlicensed traditional midwife who was educated through informal routes such as self-study or apprenticeship rather than through a formal program. This term does not necessarily mean a low level of education, just that the midwife either chose not to become certified or licensed, or there was no certification available for her type of education (as was the fact before the Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) credential was available).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mana.org/definitions.html#LayMidwife |title=Midwives Alliance of North America |publisher=Mana.org |date=2005-07-19 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>

The [[American College of Nurse-Midwives]] (ACNM) also provides accreditation to non-nurse midwife programs, as well as colleges that graduate nurse-midwives. This credential, called the '''Certified Midwife''', is currently recognized in only three states ([[New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Rhode Island]]). All CMs must pass the same certifying exam administered by the American Midwifery Certification Board for CNMs.

The North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) is a certification agency whose mission is to establish and administer certification for the credential "Certified Professional Midwife" (CPM). The CPM certification process validates entry-level knowledge, skills, and experience vital to responsible midwifery practice. This certification process encompasses multiple educational routes of entry including apprenticeship, self-study, private midwifery schools, college- and university-based midwifery programs, and nurse-midwifery. Created in 1987 by the [[Midwives Alliance of North America]], NARM is committed to identifying standards and practices that reflect the excellence and diversity of the independent midwifery community in order to set the standard for North American midwifery.

===Practice===
Midwives work with women and their families in many different settings. While the vast majority of nurse-midwives work in hospitals,{{Who|date=November 2009}} some nurse-midwives and virtually all direct-entry midwives{{Who|date=November 2009}} work within the community or [[home birth|home]]. In many states, midwives form [[birthing center]]s where a group of midwives may work individually or together<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birthcenters.org/open-abc/bc-regs.php |title=Birth Center Regulations &#124; American Association of Birth Centers |publisher=Birthcenters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> and provide additional clinical opportunities to student midwives. Midwives generally support and encourage [[natural childbirth]] in all practice settings. Laws regarding who can practice midwifery and in what circumstances vary from state to state.

==United Kingdom==
Midwives are practitioners in their own right in the [[United Kingdom]], and take responsibility for the [[antenatal]], [[intrapartum]] and [[postnatal]] care of women, up until 28 days after the birth, or as required thereafter. Midwives are the lead [[Health profession|health care professional]] attending the majority of births, whether at home or in a hospital (although most births in the UK occur in a hospital). There are two routes to qualifying as a midwife. Most midwives now qualify via a direct entry course, which refers to a three- or four-year course undertaken at university that leads to a degree in midwifery (diploma courses in midwifery have been discontinued) and entitles them to apply for admission to the register. Following completion of nurse training, a nurse may become a registered midwife by completing an eighteen-month post-registration course (leading to a degree qualification); however, this route is only available to adult branch nurses, and any child, [[mental health]], or [[learning disability]] branch nurse must complete the full three-year course to qualify as a midwife. Midwifery students do not pay tuition fees and are eligible for financial support for additional while training. Funding varies depending on which country within the UK the student is located, students are eligible for NHS bursaries in addition to a £1000 grant per year, neither are repaid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/Typesoffinance/DG_171537 |title=Student finance, loans and universities - GOV.UK |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>. Shortened course students, those who are already registered adult nurses, have different funding arrangements, and are employed by the local NHS Trust, via the Strategic Health Authority (SHA), and are paid a salary. This varies between universities and SHAs, with some students being paid their pre-training salary, others employed as a Band 5, and others paid a proportion of a Band 5 salary. Although most practising midwives within the [[United Kingdom]] are female, men are able to train but represent less than 0.5% of the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|NMC]] workforce register.<ref>http://www.nmc-uk.org/Documents/Statistical%20analysis%20of%20the%20register/NMC-Statistical-analysis-of-the-register-202006-202007.pdf</ref>

All practising midwives must be registered with the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] and also must have a Supervisor of Midwives through their local supervising authority. Most midwives work within the [[National Health Service]], providing both hospital and community care, but a significant proportion work independently, providing total care for their clients within a community setting. However, recent government proposals to require insurance for all health professionals is threatening independent midwifery in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6435279.stm |title=Threat to Independent Midwifery |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-10 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>

Midwives are at all times responsible for the woman for whom they are caring, to know when to refer complications to medical staff, to act as the woman's advocate, and to ensure the mother retains choice and control over her [[childbirth]] experience.

'''Professional association/college:'''
* The Royal College of Midwives<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcm.org.uk/ |title=rcm.org.uk |publisher=rcm.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>
The Nursing and Midwifery Council <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/ |publisher= NMC|date= |accessdate=14/14/2013}}</ref> is the regulatory body for nurses, midwives and health visitors in the UK.

===Midwifery training===
Most midwives undergo a 36 month direct entry degree program, or an 18 month [[nurse]] conversion course (on top of the 36 month nurse training course). Thus midwives potentially could have had up to 5 years of total training.  Midwifery training consists of classroom based learning provided by select universities<ref>[http://www.studentmidwife.net/universities.php Midwifery Universities in the UK]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> in conjunction with hospital and community based training placements at [[NHS Trusts]].

There has been talk for many yearsa bout doing away with shortened courses for registered adult nurses, although this has not come to fruition and these courses are still being run.

Midwives may train to be community [[Health Visitor]]s (as may [[Nurse]]s).

===Community midwives===
Many midwives also work in the community. The role of community midwives include the initial appointments with pregnant women, managing [[clinic]]s, postnatal care in the home, and attending [[home birth]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcm.org.uk/college/your-career/students/student-life-e-newsletter/student-life-october-2010/career-profile-community-midwife/?locale=en |title=Career profile: Community midwife - Royal College of Midwives |publisher=Rcm.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>  A community midwife would typically have a pager and be responsible for a particular area, contacted by ambulance control when needed.  Sometimes they are paged to help out in the hospital when there are insufficient midwives available.

'''History & Development of Maternal & Child Health Services in India''' 
These were started with the help of voluntary organizations. Modern Maternal & Child health work was begin in India by the foreign missionaries with effort to train dais. The historical facts are as follows
1885 	: An association for medical aid by the women t the women of India was established by the  Countess of Dufferin 
1918	: Lady reading Health School was started in Delhi offering helath visitors course. This was another stepping stone in MCH Services
1921	: Lady Chelmsford League was formed in India for developing Maternity & Child welfare services
1931	: The Indian Redcross society established MCH Bureau in association with the Lady Chelmsford League & Victories memorial Scholarship Fund & Co-ordinated the MCH work throughout the country. 
* Madras was the first state then to set up a separate section for maternal & child welfare in the public health department under the charge of an Asst. Director of Public Health. It was again Madras state which first attempted to replace by the better qualified personnel such as midwives & nurse midwives
1938	: Indian Research Fund Association was established which formed a committee that undertook the investigation into the incidence & cause of Maternal & infant morbidity & mortslity. Sir A. Mudaliar was the key person of this committee.

Investigation thus carried out in certain cities of the country revealed that
•	Institutional Midwifery services were limited
•	Maternal & Child welfare centre were poorly equipped & staffed
•	Untrained dais mostly handled deliveries

This situation continued for some more time. In 1946 the 5th health survey & development committee (Bhore committee) stated in its report that India was facing the problem of high maternal & infant death. It recommended empathetically that the measures for the reduction of sickness & mortality of mothers & children should have the highest priority in the health development programme of India. It was also mentioned that these deaths were preventable with the help of organized health services.

==Canada==
Midwifery was reintroduced as a regulated profession in most of [[Canada's]] ten provinces in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schroff |first=F. |year=1997 |title=The New Midwifery |location=Toronto |publisher=Women's Press |isbn=0-88961-224-2 }}</ref> After several decades of intensive political [[lobbying]] by midwives and consumers, fully integrated, regulated and publicly funded midwifery is now part of the health system in the provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], and [[Nova Scotia]], and in the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]].  Midwifery legislation has recently been proclaimed in [[New Brunswick]] where the government is in the process of integrating midwifery services there. Only [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Yukon]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] do not have legislation in place for the practice of midwifery.

Midwives in Canada come from a variety of backgrounds including: Aboriginal, post [[Nursing board certification|nursing certification]], direct-entry and "lay" or traditional midwifery. However, after a process of assessment by the provincial regulatory bodies, registrants are all simply known as 'midwives',  'registered midwives' or by the French-language equivalent, 'sage femme', regardless of their route of training. From the original 'alternative' style of midwifery in the 1960s and 1970s, midwifery practice is offered in a variety of ways within regulated provinces: midwives offer continuity of care within small group practices, choice of birthplace, and a focus on the woman as the primary decision-maker in her maternity care. When women or their newborns experience complications, midwives will work in consultation with an appropriate specialist. Registered midwives have access to appropriate diagnostics like blood tests and ultrasounds and can prescribe some medications. Founding principles of the Canadian model of midwifery include informed choice, choice of birthplace, continuity of care from a small group of midwives and respect for the woman as the primary decision maker. Midwives typically have hospital privileges and support women's right to choose where she will have her baby.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Five provinces offer four year university [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degrees in midwifery. In British Columbia, the program is offered at the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref>www.midwifery.ubc.ca</ref> Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta offers a Bachelor of Midwifery program. In Ontario, the Midwifery Education Program (MEP)is offered by a consortium of [[McMaster University]], [[Ryerson University]] and [[Laurentian University]]. In Manitoba the program is offered by [[University College of the North]]. In [[Quebec]], the program is offered at the [[Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières]]. In northern Quebec and Nunavut, Inuit women are being educated to be midwives in their own communities. A Bridging program for internationally educated midwives is in place in Ontario at [[Ryerson University]]. A federally funded pilot project called the Multi-jurisdictional Midwifery Bridging Program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midwiferybridging.ca |title=midwiferybridging.ca |publisher=midwiferybridging.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> has been offered in [[Western Canada]]. 

The legal recognition of midwifery has brought midwives into the mainstream of [[health care in Canada|health care]] with universal funding for services, hospital privileges, rights to prescribe medications commonly needed during pregnancy, birth and postpartum, and rights to order blood work and ultrasounds for their own clients and full consultation access to physicians. To protect the tenets of midwifery and support midwives to provide woman-centered care, the regulatory bodies and [[Professional body|professional associations]] have legislation and standards in place to provide protection, particularly for choice of birth [[home birth|place]], informed choice and continuity of care. All regulated midwives have malpractice insurance. Any unregulated person who provides care with 'restricted acts' in regulated provinces or territories is practicing midwifery without a license and is subject to investigation and prosecution.

Prior to legislative changes, very few Canadian women had access to midwifery care, in part because it was not funded by the [[health care system]]. Legalizing midwifery has made midwifery services available to a wide and diverse population of women and in many communities the number of available midwives does not meet the growing demand for services. Midwifery services are free to women living in provinces with regulated midwifery.

===British Columbia===
The BC government announced on March 16, 1995 the approval of regulations governing midwifery and establishing the College of Midwives of BC. In 1996, the Health Professional Council released a draft of Bylaws for the College of Midwives of BC which received Cabinet approval on April 13, 1997. In 1998, midwives were officially registered with the College of Midwives of BC.<ref name="cmbc.bc.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmbc.bc.ca |title=cmbc.bc.ca |publisher=cmbc.bc.ca |date=1998-01-01 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>

In BC Midwives are primary care providers for women in all stages of pregnancy, from prenatal to six weeks postpartum. Midwives also care for newborns. To see the approximate proportion of women whose primary birth attendant was a midwife in British Columbia see, "What Mothers Say: The Canadian Maternity Experiences Survey. Public Health Agency of Canada. Ottawa, 2009, p.&nbsp;115.<ref>http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/rhs-ssg/pdf/survey-eng.pdf</ref>

In BC midwives deliver natural births in hospitals or homes and if a complication arises in a pregnancy, labour, birth or postpartum, a midwife will consult with a specialist such as an obstetrician or paediatrician.  

Core competencies and restricted activities are included in the BC Health Professions Act Midwives Regulation.

As of April 2009, the scope of practice for midwives allows them to prescribe certain prescription drugs, use acupuncture for pain relief, assist a surgeon in a Caesarean section delivery and to perform a vacuum extraction delivery. These specialized practices require additional education and certification.

'''Current supply:'''
As of August, 2011, the College of Midwives of BC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmbc.bc.ca/pdf.shtml?List-of-Registrants%20 |title=College of Midwives of British Columbia |publisher=Cmbc.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> reported  182 General, 3 Temporary, 1 Conditional, 32 Non-practicing Registrant midwives.

There were 2 midwives per 100,000 people in BC in 2006.<ref>Canadian Institute for Health Information document titled, Number of Health Personnel in Selected Professions by Registration Status, 2006. This data has the following proviso, “Due to the variation in regulatory requirements, interprofessional comparison should be interpreted with caution.”</ref>

A midwife must be registered with the College of Midwives of BC in order to practice.

To continue licensure midwives must maintain regular recertification in neonatal resuscitation and management of maternal emergencies, maintain the minimum volume of clinical care (40 women), participate in peer case reviews and continuing education activities.<ref name="cmbc.bc.ca"/>

'''Midwives education in BC:'''
The University of British Columbia (UBC) has a four year Bachelors of Midwifery program.<ref>http://www.midwifery.ubc.ca/midwifery.htm</ref> The UBC midwifery program is poised to double in size thanks to an increase in government funding. Graduation of students will increase to 20 per year.

==Midwifery as a Western Social Movement==

Midwifery is currently growing in popularity in the West, and is strongly linked to the larger social movement toward women’s empowerment (MacDonald 2007:29).  Anthropologist research in the field reveals that even seemingly natural biological processes, such as childbirth, are constructed and shaped by the cultural and social contexts in which they appear (Romalis 1981:5). In today’s largely male-dominated culture, midwifery becomes one of the expressions of the feminist movement in which women are fighting the asymmetry in power between themselves and mostly male medical practitioners (Romalis 1981:63). Midwifery as movement a movement is therefore built upon a fundamental assumption that “birth is a route to the personal and collective empowerment of women” (MacDonald 2007:116)

Midwifery is also a part of a movement back to a more natural way of life, and asserts itself as an alternative to the medicalization of birth and the body (MacDonald 2007:69). It opposes treating pregnant women as medically ill patients, and sees the monitoring and admission of pregnant women to hospitals as unnecessary and even demeaning, and challenge these ideas by performing birth in the home (Romalis 1981:85). In this way, women are reclaiming childbirth as a deeply personal and intimate, non-medical experience, which appeals to more and more women (Romalis 1981:63-66).  By rejecting hospitalized childbirth, midwives, expectant women, and everybody else in favor of homebirth, are increasingly questioning women’s role in the childbirth process. Midwifery encourages reproductive choice, more egalitarian power relationship between the mothers and birth attendants, and more control of women during the birth process (MacDonald 2007:76).

On top of the pressures from the medical discourse, women’s right to reproductive choices are further restricted by the available knowledge on different childbirth options and alternatives (Craven 2007:pp). Furthermore, government policies limit these options by restricting the financial support, or even imposing a risk of legal repercussions due to the strict regulations surrounding midwifery. That way, governments are asserting the dominant model of hospitalization as women’s only choice (Craven 2007:pp).

However the contemporary context of neo-liberalism provides fertile ground for midwives to advocate for the rights of reproduction and the choice of homebirth to be legitimized and just as accepted and accessible in our society as hospitalized birth. “A consumer, believe it or not, is a role with more dignity, more power, than that of ‘patient’ in a capitalist system in which a fully consumerist world has adverse consequences for motherhood” (<ref>Craven 2007:702</ref>). Midwifery as a social movement, thus aims to create the appropriate space for reproductive choices in a free marketplace by giving women the independence and the opportunity to make choices and reclaim the power over their own bodies (MacDonald 2007:47).

It is therefore important that midwifery become legalized, legitimized and available for women who are capable and responsible for making the right choices for their bodies. Women who feel that hospital interventions are uncomfortable, not necessary and can be avoided should be given a choice to choose just as safe childbirth at home with the professional midwife (Ford and van Wagner 2004:259).

Opposite to professional medical doctors who tend to be distanced, economical in terms of time and money, and oriented to the instrumental efficiency (Romalis 1981:7), midwifes have the ability to establish both a professional partnership with women, as well as an individual and culturally sensitive approach. Consequently, women have an opportunity to choose a midwife who fits their personal wants or specific needs in order to give birth in a safe and comfortable environment. This way, women have resist becoming the “objects of medical intervention” and reclaim their bodies and childbirth processes, that way, preserving their dignity (Ford and van Wagner 2004:247).

==New Zealand==
Midwifery regained its status as an autonomous profession in [[New Zealand]] in 1990. The ''Nurses Amendment Act'' restored the professional and legal separation of midwifery from nursing, and established midwifery and nursing as separate and distinct professions. Nearly all midwives gaining registration now are direct entry midwives who have not undertaken any nursing training. Midwives are required to undertake a 4 year equivalent undergraduate degree to become registered. That is followed by a year of one on one mentored practice and professional development support.<ref name="New Zealand College of Midwives">{{cite web|url=http://www.midwife.org.nz|title=New Zealand College of Midwives}}</ref> 

Women must choose one of a midwife, a [[General practitioner|General Practitioner]] or an Obstetrician to provide their maternity care. About 78 percent choose a midwife (8 percent GP, 8 percent Obstetrician, 6 percent unknown).<ref>New Zealand Health Information Service: "Report on Maternity - Maternal and Newborn Information 2003."</ref> Midwives provide maternity care from early pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum. The midwifery scope of practise covers normal pregnancy and birth. The midwife will either consult or transfer care where there is a departure from a normal pregnancy. Antenatal care is normally provided in clinics, and postnatal care is initially provided in the woman’s home. Birth can be in the home, a primary birthing unit, or a hospital. Midwifery care is fully funded by the Government.  (GP care may be fully funded. Private obstetric care will incur a fee in addition to the government funding.)

==Ireland==
Midwives are trained either as nurses obtaining a higher diploma in midwifery which lasts 18 months, or the direct entry  who study and practice for 4 years, internship is done on the last year. In 2009 the first male midwife joined the midwifery programme.

==Netherlands==
Midwives are called '''vroedvrouw''' (''knowledge woman'', female midwives), '''vroedmeester''' (''knowledge master'', male midwives), or '''verloskundige''' (''deliverance experts'', general) in Dutch. Midwives are independent specialists in physiologic birth. In the Netherlands, home birth is still a common practice, although rates have been declining during the past decades. Between 2005-2008, 29% of babies were delivered at home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/gezondheid-welzijn/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2009/2009-2696-wm.htm?Languageswitch=on|publisher=CVZ,Central Bureau of Statistics |title=Fewer women give birth at home}}</ref> This figure fell to 23% delivered at home between 2007-2010 according to Midwifery in the Netherlands, a 2012 pamphlet by The Royal Dutch Organization for Midwives.<ref name="The Royal Dutch Organization of Midwives">{{cite web|title=Midwifery in the Netherlands|url=http://www.knov.nl/docs/uploads/Midwifery_in_The__Netherlands__20120730__groot.pdf|publisher=(KNOV)|accessdate=2012}}</ref> 
Midwives are generally organized as private practices, some of those are hospital-based. In-hospital outpatient childbirth is available in most hospitals. In this case, a woman's own midwife delivers the baby at the delivery room of a hospital, without intervention of an obstetrician.In all settings, midwives will transfer care to an obstetrician in case of a complicated childbirth or need for emergency intervention.

Apart from childbirth and immediate postpartum care, midwives are the first line of care in pregnancy control and education of mothers-to-be. Typical information that is given to mothers includes information about food, alcohol, life style, travel, hobbies, sex, etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.verloskundigestadspraktijk.nl/ |language=Dutch |publisher= |title=Obstetric Practice in the City of Groningen}}</ref> Some midwifery practices give additional care in the form of preconceptional care and help with fertility problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchmidwife.com/voor-zwangeren/zwanger-worden/kinderwensspreekuur/|language=Dutch |title=Preconceptional care}}</ref>

Education in midwifery is direct entry, i.e. no previous education as a nurse is needed. A 4-year education program can be followed at four colleges, in Groningen, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Maastricht.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.verloskundige.info/|language=Dutch |publisher=SOV Kennispoort Obstetrics|title=Cooperative Education Obstetrics}}</ref>

All care by midwives is legal and it is totally reimbursed by all insurance companies. This includes prenatal care, childbirth (by midwives or obstetricians, at home or in the hospital), as well as postpartum/postnatal care for mother and baby at home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expatarrivals.com/article/having-a-baby-in-the-netherlands |title=Having a baby in the Netherlands}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cvz.nl/zorgpakket  |publisher=CVZ, College for Healthcare Insurances |title=Care package}}</ref>

==Japan==
In [[Japan]], midwifery was first regulated in 1868. Today midwives in Japan are regulated under the Act on Public Health Nurse, Midwife and Nurse (No. 203) established in 1948. 

Japanese midwives must pass a national certification exam. Up until March 1, 2003 only women could be midwives.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.midwife.or.jp/general/what.html |title=Japanese Midwives Association|language=Japanese}}</ref>

==Balochistan (Tribal Pakistan)==
In [[Balochistan]], midwives are the third most powerful leaders in the community, and the most powerful among women. People say that they give life to a child as the majority of tribal areas have no doctors. Midwives also solve problems between women. If there is a conflict between a man and a woman, the man has more power, and he will go to the tribal chief instead.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/svt-on-impact/archive/2010/10/29/social-entrepreneur-understand-thy-customer|title=Socialedge.org blog "SVT on Impact"| from 7/10 interview and subsequent correspondence with Khalida Brohi, founder of Participatory Development Initiatives.}}</ref>

==Mozambique==
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-157-11.jpg|thumb|Village midwife weighing an infant and giving advice to the mother.]]
When a 16-year-long civil war ended in 1992, Mozambique's health care system was devastated and one in ten women were dying in childbirth. There were only 18 obstetricians for a population of 19 million. In 2004, Mozambique introduced a new health care initiative to train midwives in emergency obstetric care in an attempt to guarantee access to quality medical care during pregnancy and childbirth. These midwives now perform major surgeries including Cesareans and hysterectomies. As the figures now stand, Mozambique is one of the few countries on track to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goal ([[MDG]]) of reducing the maternal death rate by 75 percent by 2015.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/birth-of-a-surgeon/introduction/747/ PBS documentary ''Birth of a Surgeon'']</ref>

==Traditional, non-Western societies==

===Karbis of Goria Ghuli===
The village of Goria Ghuli is an example of a rural and traditional village. The village has no electricity, and they have no access to a telephone. The primary health facility is in Sonapur, which is about 7&nbsp;km from the village. This health facility has 3 doctors, 2 lady health visitors, 6 auxiliary nurse midwives, 3 microscopists, and 2 pharmacists. The Karbis believe that good health “is the outcome of a pious life and illness is the punishment meted out by spirits”<ref name="Das, I. 2003">{{cite journal |last=Das |first=I. |year=2003 |title=Ethnomedical practices among the karbis of goria ghuli of sonapur, assam, with special reference to the female health problems |journal=Journal of Human Ecology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=119–124 |doi= |url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JHE/JHE-14-0-000-000-2003-Web/JHE-14-2-077-03-Abst-PDF/JHE-14-2-119-03-Das-I/JHE-14-2-119-124-03-Das-I-Tt.pdf }}</ref> The Karbis have specialists or healers who are not alike; midwives, or ethnogynacologists are one of these specialists. The village has two different categories of midwives. The first is known as the ‘traditional’ midwife, who is also an herbalist. The second is the ‘nurse’ midwife; these are the ‘government’ midwives.<ref name="Das, I. 2003"/> Traditional midwives are favored in the village. They receive some informal training that is used to help with before, during, and after pregnancy care of villagers. This information is transferred from generation to generation. In the village there are 3 ethnogynacologist, which can be approached at any time for assistance at the time of delivery. She, and usually another elderly woman in the village help during and after the delivery. If for any reason there are complications, the village midwife will forward the ‘patient’ to the ‘nurse’, and if she is unable to help then they are forwarded to the Primary Health Center. These midwives do not take on the traditional role of a midwife that we may see in the United States, for example. Rather, a huge role of the midwife is as an herbalist for the village.

===Maya of Guatemala===
This study was specifically in San Pedro. The midwives of San Pedro have many roles in the society, and are respected highly for them. The shamans of San Pedro are rapidly declining which has caused an increase in the number of midwives, in order to care for the people. They call the midwife, "iyom". The Maya believe that being pregnant is to be "yawa", meaning ill.<ref name="Paul1975">{{cite journal |last=Paul |first=B.

She provides prenatal care, massage, attends delivery, and takes care "takes charge of" mother and child after birth. Midwives in this society are similar to shamans, in that her calling is divine. She is the connection between the spiritual and real world, and in order to protect her 'patients' she performs rituals to keep them safe. The load of work for these midwives is huge. There are not many, and they serve most women in the village.<ref name="Paul1975" /> (This case study was done in 1975, and the community has changed since. A recent book documents cultural change and continuity in San Pedro and in local midwifery practices as related to the life and work of a renowned local iyom).<ref name="Rogoff2011">{{cite book |last=Rogoff |first=B. |year=2011 |title=Developing destinies: A Mayan midwife and town |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19531-990-7 }}</ref>
