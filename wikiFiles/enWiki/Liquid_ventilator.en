A '''liquid ventilator''' is similar to a [[medical ventilator]] except that it should be able to ensure reliable total [[liquid ventilation]] with a [[breatheable liquid]] (a [[perfluorocarbon]])<ref name="Wolfson2005"/>{{,}}.<ref name="Kaisers2003"/> Liquid ventilators are prototypes that may have been used for [[animal experimentation]]s but experts recommend continued development of a liquid ventilator toward clinical applications.<ref name="Costantino2009"/>

==Function and technology==

===Driving liquid===
In total [[liquid ventilation]] (TLV), the lungs are completely filled with a [[perfluorocarbon]] (PFC) liquid while the liquid ventilator renews the tidal volume of PFC. The liquid ventilator operates in mandatory mode: it must force the PFC in and out of the lungs with a pumping system.
* During the inspiratory phase, the pump generates a positive driving pressure in the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to ensure the PFC insertion of the tidal volume.
* During the expiratory phase, the pump generates a negative driving pressure in the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to ensure PFC withdrawal of the tidal volume.
The pumping system is either a [[peristaltic pump]] (in the simplest liquid ventilators) or two [[piston pump]]s (in the most advanced liquid ventilators).

Because of the PFC [[viscosity]], the [[head loss]] in the airways requires a low negative driving pressure during the expiration phase that can collapse the airways. This is the choked flow phenomenon in TLV<ref name="Baba2004"/>{{,}}<ref name="Bull2005"/> which compromises the minute ventilation and consequently the gas exchanges.<ref name="Corno2004"/> To address this limitation, liquid ventilator integrates a control of the pumping system.<ref name="Micheau2011"/>

===Controlling liquid ventilator===
The introduction of computers in liquid ventilators to control the pumping system provides different control modes, monitoring and valuable data for decision making<ref name="Sekins1999"/>{{,}}.<ref name="Heckman1999"/>

The liquid ventilator is always '''volume-controlled''' because the specified [[tidal volume]] of PFC must be accurately delivered and retrieved. It is also '''pressure-limited''' because it must stop the expiratory or inspiratory phase when a too low, or a too large, driving pressure is detected.<ref name="Larrabe2001"/>

However, during the expiratory phase, the expiratory flow can be commanded by an [[open-loop controller]] or a [[closed-loop controller]]:
* when the expiratory flow is open-loop controlled, it is fast initially and slowing down progressively after to minimize the risk of collapse generation.<ref name="Robert2009"/>{{,}}<ref name="Tredici2004"/>
* when the expiratory flow is closed-loop controlled, it is commanded in real-time to maintain a specified driving pressure. This is a '''pressure-regulated''' mode. Such approach automatically avoids collapse generation.<ref name="Robert2009b"/>

Also, during the inspiratory phase, the volume-controlled mode is realized by open-loop or closed loop control of the PFC flow.

===Oxygenating and heating liquid===
The liquid ventilator removes [[Carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the PFC by saturating it with [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and medical [[air]]. This procedure can be performed with either a membrane oxygenator (a technology used in [[extracorporeal]] oxygenators) or a bubble oxygenator.<ref name="Robert2006"/>

The liquid ventilator heats the PFC to body temperature. This is performed with an [[heat exchanger]] connected to the oxygenator or with dedicated heaters integrated in the oxygenator.<ref name="Robert2006"/>

The oxygenator and the heater produce PFC vapor which is recuperated with a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] in order to limit the evaporation loss (the PFC is a [[greenhouse gas]]).

==Example==
[[Image:AnimInolivent.gif|thumb| Example of the pumping cycle in a liquid ventilator (Inolivent-4, research group Inolivent, [[Université de Sherbrooke]])]]

An example of a liquid ventilator is the Inolivent-4. It is composed of 2 independent piston pumps and integrated unit allowing for oxygenation of PFC, temperature control, and recovery of evaporated PFC.<ref name="Robert2006"/> This liquid ventilator also includes volume and pressure control strategies to optimize the ventilatory cycle: it performs a ''pressure-regulated volume-controlled'' ventilation mode.<ref name="Robert2009b"/> It is designed for experimental research on animal models weighing between 0.5&nbsp;kg to 9&nbsp;kg.

A typical cycle is composed of 4 steps :
# Inspiratory pump inserts a volume of PFC in the lungs (valve 1 open, valve 2 closed), and the expiratory pump pushes PFC in the oxygenator via the filter (valve 3 closed, valve 4 open).
# During the inspiratory pause (all valves are closed), the lung volume is at its maximal value. The measured pressure is the Positive End-Inspiratory Pressure (PEIP).
# Expiratory pump retrieves a volume of PFC in the lungs (valve 3 open, valve 4 closed), and the inspiratory pump draws PFC from the reservoir (valve 1 closed, valve 2 open).
# During the expiratory pause (all valves are closed), the lung volume is at its minimal value. The measured pressure is the Positive End-expiratory Pressure (PEEP).

==Potential applications==
Studies have shown both the efficacy and safety of liquid ventilation in normal, mature and immature newborn lungs. Overall, liquid ventilation improves gas exchange and lung [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] and prevents the lungs against ventilation-induced lung injury.<ref name="Wolfson2005"/>

===Respiratory support===
Studies suggest clear benefits of liquid ventilation in [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).<ref name="Wolfson2008"/> For example, total liquid ventilation could be used for [[newborns]] with severe neonatal [[respiratory distress syndrome]]<ref name="Hirschl1995"/> in which conventional treatment has failed. Typical cases are late [[preterm]] newborns who have an increased risk of [[intracranial hemorrhage]] and for whom their small vessel size poses technical limitations for [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO).

===Therapeutic lung lavage===
Liquid ventilator can perform therapeutic [[lung lavage]], the washout of endogenous and exogenous debris from the lungs, without suspension of ventilation support (without [[apnea]]). For example, literature data suggest a radical change in the treatment of [[meconium aspiration syndrome]] (MAS) by considering the use of a liquid ventilator. The demonstration of its efficacy was performed in the neonatal lamb.<ref name="Foust1996"/>{{,}}.<ref name="Avoine2011"/>

===Therapeutic hypothermia with rapid cooling===
The liquid ventilator with advanced control temperature of PFC allows the rapid cooling of the body. Consequently, [[therapeutic hypothermia]] is an expected clinical application. For example, studies present that rapid cooling instituted by TLV can improve cardiac and mitochondrial function <ref name="Tissier2009"/> or can induce favorable neurological and cardiac outcomes after cardiac arrest in rabbits.<ref name="Chenoune2011"/>
