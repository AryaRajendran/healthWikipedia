{{main|University of Szeged}}
'''Albert Szent-Györgyi Medical University''' was originally established in [[Kolozsvár]], then in [[Austria-Hungary]], later [[Romania]], in 1872. After [[World War I]], it was moved to [[Szeged]]. Since 1921 great advances have been made in the development of the University. Most of the University buildings have preserved their original, harmonized style, providing a true University atmosphere of tradition.

== Setting and architecture ==
Preclinical departments of the Faculty of [[Medicine]] are situated around [[Cathedral]] (''Dóm'') Square. The University [[Hospitals]], housing the clinical departments, occupy the land between the Cathedral and River [[Tisza]], which is a calm, peaceful area of the old town. Some of the preclinical departments are accommodated in other buildings; however, even off-campus departments of the Medical University (such as [[Anatomy]] and [[Forensic]] Medicine) are within easy access from the city center (10 minutes by tram).
