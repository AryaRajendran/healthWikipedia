'''Asphyxia''' or '''asphyxiation''' (from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''α-'' "without" and σφύξις ''sphyxis'', "heartbeat") is a condition of severely deficient supply of [[oxygen]] to the [[body]] that arises from being unable to [[breathing|breathe]] normally. An example of asphyxia is [[choking]]. Asphyxia causes [[generalized hypoxia]], which primarily affects the tissues and organs. There are many circumstances that can induce asphyxia, all of which are characterized by an inability of an individual to acquire sufficient oxygen through breathing for an extended period of time. These circumstances can include but are not limited to: the constriction or obstruction of airways, such as from [[asthma]], [[laryngospasm]], or simple blockage from the presence of foreign materials; from being in environments where oxygen is not readily accessible: such as underwater, in a low oxygen atmosphere, or in a vacuum; environments where sufficiently oxygenated air is present, but cannot be adequately breathed because of air contamination such as excessive smoke. Asphyxia can cause coma or death.

==Oxygen deficiency==
The body creates the need to breathe from the excess [[carbon dioxide]] in the blood. The body has chemosensors to detect oxygen levels in the blood, but these don't typically control respiratory rate. Many gases, though non-[[toxicity|toxic]], are classified as simple [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]]s in their pure or inpure form or in high concentrations for this very reason.

One form of asphyxiation is from entering a low oxygen atmosphere or an [[inert]] atmosphere, such as in a food oil tank that has a covering blanket of [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] to shield the oil from atmospheric oxygen. Without sufficient oxygen to sustain life, people will act normally at first but will then abruptly feel dizzy and black out in a matter of seconds {{fact|date=November 2012}} as the remaining oxygen in the blood stream is consumed. Oxygen deficient atmospheres are the basis for many occurrences of single and multiple deaths; the deceased will be found lying prone on the bottom of a tank, and then the observer will rush in to rescue them, and succumb to the same effect, hence the need to vent or purge the inert gases from all tanks before entry.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Other causes of oxygen deficiency include:

* Carbon monoxide inhalation, such as from a car exhaust: carbon monoxide has a higher affinity than oxygen to the [[hemoglobin]] in the blood's red blood corpuscles, bonding with it tenaciously, and, in the process, displacing oxygen and preventing the blood from transporting oxygen around the body
* Contact with certain chemicals, including [[pulmonary agent]]s (such as [[phosgene]]) and [[blood agent]]s (such as [[hydrogen cyanide]])
* Self-induced [[hypocapnia]] by [[hyperventilation]], as in [[shallow water blackout|shallow water]] or [[deep water blackout]] and the [[choking game]]
* A [[seizure]] which stops breathing activity
* [[Sleep apnea]]
* [[Drug overdose]]
* [[Ondine's curse]], central alveolar [[hypoventilation]] syndrome, or primary alveolar hypoventilation, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system in which a patient must consciously breathe; although it is often said that persons with this disease will die if they fall asleep, this is not usually the case
* [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome]].
* Exposure to extreme low pressure or [[vacuum]] to the pattern
* [[Hanging]]
* Respiratory diseases
* [[Drowning]]
* Possibly [[crucifixion]]

==Smothering==
{{Redirect|Smother|the 2008 film|Smother (film)}}
'''Smothering''' is the mechanical obstruction of the flow of air from the environment into the mouth and/or nostrils, for instance, by covering the mouth and nose with a hand, pillow, or a plastic bag.<ref name=Ferris>Ferris, J.A.J. [http://www.pathology.ubc.ca/path425/Others/MedicolegalInvestigationOfDeathAndForensic/AsphixiaDrJAJFerris.doc Asphyxia]. ''www.pathology.ubc.ca''. URL's last accessed March 1, 2006 (DOC format)</ref> Smothering can be either partial or complete, where partial indicates that the person being smothered is able to inhale some air, although less than required. In a normal situation, smothering requires at least partial obstruction of both the nasal cavities and the mouth to lead to asphyxia. Smothering with the hands or chest is used in some [[combat sport]]s to distract the opponent, and create openings for [[transition (grappling)|transitions]], as the opponent is forced to react to the smothering.

In some cases, when performing certain routines, smothering is combined with simultaneous compressive asphyxia. One example is '''overlay''', in which an adult accidentally rolls over an infant during [[co-sleeping]], an accident that often goes unnoticed and is mistakenly thought to be [[sudden infant death syndrome]].<ref name=Ferris/> Other accidents involving a similar mechanism are [[cave-in]]s or when an individual is buried in sand or grain.

In [[homicide|homicidal]] cases, the term '''burking''' is often ascribed to a killing method that involves simultaneous smothering and compression of the torso.<ref name=dimaio>DiMaio, Vincent; DiMaio, Dominick (2001). ''Forensic Pathology, Second Edition''. [http://www.charlydmiller.com/LIB/forensicpathasphyxia.html Selected Pages from CHAPTER 8] and from [http://www.datenschlag.org/howto/atem/english/DiM89.html Deaths Occurring Following the Application of Choke or Carotid Holds]. ''www.charlydmiller.com''. URL last accessed March 2, 2006.</ref> The term "burking" comes from the method [[William Burke]] and [[William Hare (murderer)|William Hare]] used to kill their victims during the [[Burke and Hare murders|West Port murders]]. They killed the usually-intoxicated victims by sitting on their chests and suffocating them by putting a hand over their nose and mouth, while using the other hand to push the victim's jaw up. The corpses had no visible injuries, and were supplied to medical schools for money.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

==Compressive asphyxia==
[[Image:Image943-knee mount.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[knee-on-belly position]] compresses the chest, making it difficult for the person on the bottom to [[breath]]e.]]
'''Compressive asphyxia''' (also called '''chest compression''') is mechanically limiting expansion of the lungs by compressing the torso, hence interfering with breathing. Compressive asphyxia occurs when the chest or abdomen is compressed [[anatomical terms of location#Usage in human anatomy|posteriorly]].<ref name=jones>Jones, Richard. [http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/strangulation.htm Strangulation]. ''www.forensicmed.co.uk''. URL last accessed February 26, 2006.</ref> In accidents, the term [[traumatic asphyxia]] or '''crush asphyxia''' usually refers to compressive asphyxia resulting from being crushed or pinned under a large weight or force. An example of traumatic asphyxia includes cases where an individual has been using a [[jack (mechanical)|car-jack]] to repair a car from below, and is crushed under the weight of the vehicle.<ref name=dimaio/> [[Pythonidae|Pythons]], [[anacondas]], and other constrictor snakes kill through compressive asphyxia. In cases of co-sleeping ("overlay"), the weight of an adult or large child may compress an infant's chest, preventing proper expansion of the chest. Risk factors include large or obese adults, parental fatigue or impairment (sedation by drugs or alcohol) of the co-sleeping adult and a small shared sleeping space (for example, both adult and infant sharing a couch).

In [[Stampede#Human stampedes|fatal crowd disasters]], compressive asphyxia from being crushed against the crowd causes the large part of the deaths, rather than [[blunt trauma]] from trampling. This is what occurred at the [[1971 Ibrox disaster|Ibrox disaster]] in 1971, where 66 [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] fans died; the [[1979 The Who concert disaster]] where 11 died; the [[Luzhniki disaster]] in 1982, when 66 [[FC Spartak Moscow]] fans died; and at the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989, when 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans were crushed to death in an overcrowded terrace. In confined spaces, people push and lean against each other; evidence from bent steel railings in several fatal crowd accidents have shown horizontal forces over 4500 N (equivalent to a weight of approximately 450&nbsp;kg, or 1014&nbsp;lbs). In cases where people have stacked up on each other forming a human pile, estimations have been made of around 380&nbsp;kg (838&nbsp;lbs) of compressive weight in the lowest layer.<ref>Fruin, John. [http://www.crowddynamics.com/Main/Fruin%20-%20causes.htm The Causes and Prevention of Crowd Disasters]. ''www.crowddynamics.com''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.</ref>

The cause of death of police prisoners who have been restrained and left prone, for example in police vehicles, and cannot move into safer positions, has been referred to as "positional asphyxia". Restraint asphyxia is death or lost consciousness (to die later in a coma from anoxic brain damage), while being restrained in positions that cause asphyxia by facial compression, neck compression, or chest compression. This mostly occurs during law enforcement or psychiatric restraint situations. It may be that the positional asphyxia deaths of prisoners are actually active chest compression deaths caused by the weight of restrainers holding uncooperative prisoners down in a prone position during the process of being handcuffed and otherwise secured. Thus, the passive deaths following custody restraint presumed to be due to positional asphyxia after being secured by mechanical restraints may actually be examples of active restraint asphyxia occurring during the process of placing restraints.

Chest compression is also featured in various [[grappling]] combat sports, where it is sometimes called '''wringing'''. Such techniques are used either to tire the opponent or as complementary or distractive moves in combination with [[grappling hold#Pinning hold|pinning holds]],<ref name=ohlenkamp>Ohlenkamp, Neil [http://judoinfo.com/chokes.htm Principles of Judo Choking Techniques]. ''judoinfo.com''. URL last accessed on March 3, 2006</ref> or sometimes even as [[grappling hold#Submission hold|submission holds]]. Examples of chest compression include the [[knee-on-stomach position]], or techniques such as '''leg scissors''' (also referred to as '''body scissors''' and in [[budō]] referred to as ''do-jime'',<ref>Do-jime is a prohibited technique in [[Judo]], (The Kodokan Judo Institute. [http://www.kodokan.org/e_waza/index.html Kodokan.Org classification of techniques]. ''www.kodokan.org''. URL last accessed March 4, 2006.) and is considered a 'slight infringement' according to IJF rules, Section 27: Prohibited acts and penalties, article 21. It should not be confused with ''[[do-osae]]'', which is a colloquial term for the [[guard (grappling)|guard position]].</ref> 胴絞, "trunk strangle" or "body triangle")<ref name=ijf>International Judo Federation.

==Perinatal asphyxia==
{{Main|Perinatal asphyxia}}'''Perinatal asphyxia''' is the medical condition resulting from deprivation of [[oxygen]] ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]) to a newborn infant long enough to cause apparent harm. It results most commonly from a drop in maternal [[blood pressure]] or interference during [[childbirth|delivery]] with blood flow to the infant's [[brain]]. This can occur as a result of inadequate [[circulatory system|circulation]] or [[perfusion]], impaired respiratory effort, or inadequate [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]].{{cn|date=August 2012}}

==Nitrogen asphyxiation==
{{Main|Nitrogen asphyxiation}}
'''Nitrogen asphyxiation''' is an occasional cause of [[accidental death]] and a theoretical method of capital punishment.
After just two or three breaths of pure nitrogen, the oxygen concentration in the lungs would be low enough for some oxygen already in the bloodstream to exchange back to the lungs and be eliminated by exhalation.
