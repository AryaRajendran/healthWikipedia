:''For his son, the diplomat, see [[Hugh S. Cumming, Jr.]]''
'''Hugh Smith Cumming''' (17 August 1869&nbsp;– 20 December 1948) was an American physician, and soldier. He was appointed the fifth [[Surgeon General of the United States]] from 1920 to 1936.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Cumming was born in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. He received his [[undergraduate]] education at [[Baltimore City College]] and then obtained medical degrees from the [[University of Virginia]] Department of Medicine in 1893, where he was a member of the [[Chi Phi Fraternity]], and the [[University College of Medicine]] (in [[Richmond, Virginia]]) in 1894 (the latter while serving as house doctor at St. Luke's Hospital in Richmond). In 1894, he obtained a commission as an Assistant Surgeon in the Marine Hospital Service, which was to become the [[Public Health Service]] and [[Marine Hospital Service]] in 1902 and then the Public Health Service in 1912.

=== Career ===
Cumming was assigned to a variety of posts during his early career in the Service, especially [[quarantine]] stations in the [[U.S. Southern states|South]] and on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. He also served on immigration duty at Ellis Island, New York. For 3 years, from February 1906 to February 1909, Cumming was detailed to the office of the [[United States Consul General]] in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]], where he was concerned with [[immigration]] and quarantinable [[disease]]s. From 1913 to 1919, he was assigned to the [[Hygienic Laboratory]] (forerunner of the [[National Institutes of Health]]) in [[Washington, DC]]. There he was placed in charge of an investigation of the [[pollution]] of tidal waters of [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. One of his concerns was the [[shellfish]] industry, and the potential threat to human health from consuming [[oyster]]s grown in waters polluted with [[sewage]].

During [[World War I]], Cumming was assigned to the [[United States Navy]] as a sanitary advisor. He was later ordered to [[Europe]] to study the [[sanitation|sanitary]] conditions of the ports from which troops would embark and to confer with military authorities to take the necessary action to prevent the introduction of disease into the United States by returning troops. He was also a member of the [[Typhus Fever Commission]] to [[Poland]].

=== Surgeon General ===
On 3 March 1920, Cumming was appointed [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] of the [[United States Public Health Service]]. The Public Health Service (PHS) had been given the task in 1919 of providing health care for [[veteran]]s, and the Service was still expanding and adjusting to this new responsibility when Cumming took office. In 1922, however, Congress created the [[Veterans' Bureau]], and the responsibility for the health care of veterans was transferred from the PHS to the new Bureau. Another event of Cumming's early tenure was the creation of a national [[leprosy]] hospital in [[Carville, Louisiana]] in 1921 when the PHS took control of what had been the [[Louisiana Leper Home]]. The facility at Carville became a major center for leprosy treatment and research.

In 1925, Cumming inaugurated a plan for the medical inspection of [[immigrant]]s abroad in the principal countries of origin. This plan reduced the number of immigrants who were turned back for medical reasons after making the trip to the United States. In the 1920s, the PHS also completed the development of a national maritime quarantine system by acquiring the last two quarantine stations operated by States.

A 1929 law authorized the PHS to establish a [[Division of Narcotics]] (the name was later changed to [[Division of Mental Hygiene]]) and to construct two hospitals for the treatment of drug addicts. Cumming also expanded the research activities of the [[Hygienic Laboratory]], which in 1930 became the [[National Institute of Health]]. Under Cumming, the [[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] was also authorized to admit dentists, pharmacists, and sanitary engineers, the first expansion of the Regular Corps beyond physicians.

In 1930, the PHS was given the responsibility of providing medical and psychiatric care to Federal prisoners. Under the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935, the PHS was authorized to provide grants-in-aid to the States for the development of public health work.

Cumming served as President of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States in 1924 and as President of the [[American Public Health Association]] in 1931.  In 1931 Cumming initiated the [[Tuskegee syphilis study|"The Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the negro male"]]—begun in 1932, continued under Cumming's successors, ended in 1972.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16809865 | doi=10.1353/bhm.2006.0066 | volume=80 | issue=2 | title=Eugenics, medical education, and the Public Health Service: Another perspective on the Tuskegee syphilis experiment | year=2006 | journal=Bull Hist Med | pages=291–316| author=Lombardo PA & Dorr GM}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=9422551 | volume=40 | issue=1 | title=The study of untreated syphilis in the negro male | year=1998 | month=January | journal=Int.

=== Personal life ===
