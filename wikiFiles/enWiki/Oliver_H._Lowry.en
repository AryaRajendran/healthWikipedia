'''Oliver Howe Lowry''' (July 18, 1910 – June 29, 1996) was an American biochemist. He is best remembered for devising the [[Lowry protein assay]].

Lowry was the youngest of a family of five children. His father was a teacher and later an administrator in the [[Chicago]] public school system. His three brothers and sister all earned graduate degrees in various fields, and Lowry was inspired to emulate his siblings. He attended [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Illinois]], for his undergraduate studies, having intended to major in chemical engineering. However, upon the advice of a fellow student, he ended up shifting his focus towards biochemistry.<ref name="self-pub">{{cite pmid|2197974}}</ref> After graduating from Northwestern in 1932, he enrolled at the [[University of Chicago]], where he sought to study "physiological chemistry".<ref name="Kresge_2005">{{cite journal | authors = Kresge N, Simoni RD, Hill RL | title = The Most Highly Cited Paper in Publishing History: Protein Determination by Oliver H.

Despite the fact that he been granted the title of "Doctor of Medicine", Lowry never practiced medicine.<ref name="Kresge_2005" />

After graduating from the University of Chicago with his two doctoral degrees, Lowry failed in his attempt to secure a postdoctoral fellowship. He left Chicago to work at [[Harvard University]] under A. Baird Hastings. While at Harvard, Hastings was able to arrange for Lowry to work for five months at the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], where he worked with [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang]]. By 1942, [[Otto Bessey]] persuaded his friend Lowry to join him at the newly established [[Public Health Research Institute]] in [[New York City]], where Lowry would work until 1947.<ref name="self-pub" />

In 1947, [[Washington University in St. Louis]] invited Lowry to head its Department of Pharmacology despite the fact that Lowry had never taken a course in pharmacology and his research was only tangentially related to that field. Nevertheless, Lowry served as the department head for the next twenty-nine years. He also served as dean of the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] from 1955 to 1958.<ref name="Kresge_2005" /> He was eventually succeeded as department head by [[Philip Needleman]], but Lowry continued to work at Washington University until his retirement.<ref name="self-pub" /> Lowry was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1957 and to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1964. He died of [[Alzheimer's disease]], at the age of 85, on June 29, 1996.<ref name="nyt obit">{{cite news| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/04/us/oliver-h-lowry-85-an-expert-in-precise-biological-measuring.html | title = Oliver H.

Among all his numerous contributions to biochemistry, Lowry is best known for his development of the [[Lowry protein assay]], used in the determination of protein concentrations. As of 2010, his 1951 paper in the ''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]'' describing the protein assay was still the most-highly cited paper of all time, although Lowry later stated it was not the most important paper he had ever written.<ref name="Kresge_2005" /><ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s00423-010-0623-4}}</ref>
