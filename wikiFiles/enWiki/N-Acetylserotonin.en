'''''N''-Acetylserotonin''' ('''NAS'''), also known as '''normelatonin''', is a [[natural product|naturally occurring]] [[chemical compound|chemical]] [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]] in the [[endogenous]] production of [[melatonin]] from [[serotonin]].<ref name="pmid13795316">{{cite journal | author = AXELROD J, WEISSBACH H | title = Enzymatic O-methylation of N-acetylserotonin to melatonin | journal = Science | volume = 131 | issue = 3409| page = 1312 | year = 1960 | month = April | pmid = 13795316 | doi = 10.1126/science.131.3409.1312| url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13795316}}</ref><ref name="pmid13784117">{{cite journal | author = WEISSBACH H, REDFIELD BG, AXELROD J | title = Biosynthesis of melatonin: enzymic conversion of serotonin to N-acetylserotonin | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 352–3 | year = 1960 | month = September | pmid = 13784117 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3002(60)90453-4| url = }}</ref> It is produced from serotonin by the [[enzyme]] [[aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase|aralkylamine ''N''-acetyltransferase]] (AANAT) and is converted to melatonin by [[Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase|acetylserotonin ''O''-methyltransferase]] (ASMT). Like melatonin, NAS is an [[agonist]] at the [[melatonin receptor]]s [[MT1 receptor|MT<sub>1</sub>]], [[MT2 receptor|MT<sub>2</sub>]], and [[MT3 receptor|MT<sub>3</sub>]], and may be considered to be a [[neurotransmitter]].<ref name="pmid20133677">{{cite journal | author = Jang SW, Liu X, Pradoldej S, ''et al.'' | title = N-acetylserotonin activates TrkB receptor in a circadian rhythm | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107| issue = 8| pages = 3876| year = 2010 | month = February | pmid = 20133677 | pmc = 2840510 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912531107 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=20133677}}</ref><ref name="pmid11261588">{{cite journal | author = Zhao H, Poon AM, Pang SF | title = Pharmacological characterization, molecular subtyping, and autoradiographic localization of putative melatonin receptors in uterine endometrium of estrous rats | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 66 | issue = 17 | pages = 1581–91 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 11261588 | doi = 10.1016/S0024-3205(00)00478-1| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0024320500004781}}</ref><ref name="pmid10455277">{{cite journal | author = Nonno R, Pannacci M, Lucini V, Angeloni D, Fraschini F, Stankov BM | title = Ligand efficacy and potency at recombinant human MT2 melatonin receptors: evidence for agonist activity of some mt1-antagonists | journal = [[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 127 | issue = 5 | pages = 1288–94 | year = 1999 | month = July | pmid = 10455277 | pmc = 1566130 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0702658 }}</ref><ref name="pmid10381796">{{cite journal | author = Paul P, Lahaye C, Delagrange P, Nicolas JP, Canet E, Boutin JA | title = Characterization of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites in Syrian hamster peripheral organs | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 290 | issue = 1 | pages = 334–40 | year = 1999 | month = July | pmid = 10381796 | doi = | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10381796}}</ref> In addition, NAS is distributed in some areas of the [[brain]] where serotonin and melatonin are not, suggesting that it may have unique central duties of its own instead of merely functioning as a [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]] in the [[synthesis (chemical)|synthesis]] of melatonin.<ref name="pmid20133677" />

Recently, NAS has been shown to act as a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[TrkB receptor]] agonist, while serotonin and melatonin are not.<ref name="pmid20133677" /> It produces robust [[antidepressant]], [[neuroprotective]], and [[neurotrophic]] effects that are TrkB-mediated.<ref name="pmid20133677" /> In addition, AANAT [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] which lack NAS display significantly greater immobility times versus control mice in assays of [[major depressive disorder|depression]] like the [[forced swim test]].<ref name="pmid20133677" />

NAS may also play a major role in the antidepressant effects of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs).<ref name="pmid20133677" /> The SSRI [[fluoxetine]] and the [[MAO-A]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] [[clorgyline]] [[upregulation|upregulate]] AANAT indirectly through [[serotonergic]] mechanisms and thereby increase NAS levels after chronic administration, and this correlates with the onset of their antidepressant effects.<ref name="pmid20133677" /><ref name="pmid10591054">{{cite journal | author = Oxenkrug GF | title = Antidepressive and antihypertensive effects of MAO-A inhibition: role of N-acetylserotonin.

Through a currently unidentified mechanism, NAS may be the cause of the [[orthostatic hypotension]] seen with clinical treatment of MAOIs.<ref name="pmid9503569">{{cite journal | author = Oxenkrug GF | title = [N-acetylserotonin and hypotensive effect of MAO-A inhibitors] | language = Russian | journal = Voprosy Meditsinskoi Khimii | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 522–6 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9503569 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid10591054" /> It reduces [[blood pressure]] in rodents, and [[pinealectomy]] (the [[pineal gland]] being a major site of NAS and melatonin synthesis) abolishes the [[hypotensive]] effects of [[clorgyline]].<ref name="pmid9503569" /><ref name="pmid10591054" /> Why orthostatic hypotension is commonly seen with MAOIs but not SSRIs (both of which increase NAS levels) however, is unknown.
