'''Methyldopa''' (<small>L</small>-α-'''Methyl'''-3,4-'''d'''ihydr'''o'''xy'''p'''henyl'''a'''lanine; '''Aldomet''', '''Aldoril''', '''Dopamet''', '''Dopegyt''', etc.) is an [[alpha-adrenergic agonist]] (selective for α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) [[psychoactive drug]] used as a [[sympatholytic]] or [[antihypertensive]]. Its use is now mostly deprecated following the introduction of alternative safer classes of agents. However, it continues to have a role in otherwise difficult to treat [[hypertension]] and [[gestational hypertension]] (also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)).

== Indications ==

Methyldopa is used in the [[clinical treatment]] of the following [[medical disorder|disorder]]s:
* (M-D-P-A) stimulant drugs) 
* [[Hypertension]] (or high blood pressure)
* [[Gestational hypertension]] (or pregnancy-induced hypertension) and [[pre-eclampsia]]

== Pharmacology ==

Methyldopa has a [[functional selectivity|dual]] [[mechanism of action]]:

* It is a competitive inhibitor of the [[enzyme]] [[DOPA decarboxylase]], also known as [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|aromatic <small>L</small>-amino acid decarboxylase]], which converts [[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]] into [[dopamine]]. Dopamine is a precursor for [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and subsequently [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline). This inhibition results in reduced [[dopaminergic]] and [[adrenergic]] [[neurotransmission]] in the [[peripheral nervous system]].  This effect may lower blood pressure and cause [[central nervous system]] effects such as [[clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[apathy]], [[anhedonia]], and [[parkinsonism]].

* It is converted to [[α-methylnorepinephrine]] by [[dopamine beta-hydroxylase]] (DBH). α-methylnorepinephrine is an [[agonist]] of presynaptic central nervous system α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]. Activation of these receptors in the brainstem appears to inhibit [[sympathetic nervous system]] output and lower blood pressure. This is also the mechanism of action of [[clonidine]].

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Methyldopa exhibits variable [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. It is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]] and [[intestine]]s and is [[excretion|excreted]] in [[urine]].

== History ==

When methyldopa was first introduced, it was the mainstay of antihypertensive [[therapy|treatment]], but its use has declined on account of relatively severe adverse side effects, with increased use of other safer and more tolerable agents such as [[alpha blocker]]s, [[beta blocker]]s, and [[calcium channel blocker]]s. Nonetheless, one of methyldopa's still current indications is in the management of [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] (PIH), as it is relatively safe in [[pregnancy]] compared to many other antihypertensives which may affect the [[fetus]].

== Side effects ==

Methyldopa is capable of inducing a number of adverse side effects, which range from mild to severe. Nevertheless, they are generally mild when the dose is less than 1&nbsp;gram per day.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[British National Formulary]] 56 |date=September 2008 |pages=95–96 |isbn = 978-0-85369-778-7}}</ref> Side effects may include:
