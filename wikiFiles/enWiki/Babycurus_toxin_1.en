Babycurus-toxin 1 ('''BcTx1''') is a component of the venom of the east African scorpion ''Babycurus centrurimorphus''. This toxin modifies both the activation and the inactivation properties of insect [[sodium channel]]s.

== Source ==
This toxin is a component of the venom secreted by the east African scorpion ''Babycurus centrurimorphus'' of the scorpion family [[Buthidae]], and is more specific in envenoming insects, for example the cockroach, than in human envenoming.<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TCS-3RH6D2X-8&_user=10&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F1997&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=1d307d58420b543a7d4bb925613d7b03&searchtype=a Action of babycurus-toxin 1 from the east African scorpion Babycurus centrurimorphus on the isolated cockroach giant axon].;  Ben Khalifa R.

== Chemistry ==
The molecular weight of BcTx1 is 3248. It belongs to the long (4 C-C) scorpion toxin superfamily and can be classified as a Î²-toxin.<ref>http://protchem.hunnu.edu.cn/toxin/Browse/SingleProtein.jsp?Type=SingleProtein&Filter=ToxinID&QS=AT0000059&Page=0</ref> Only the first 30 amino acids of the BcTx1 protein have yet been sequenced.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> 

The toxin shares similarities in [[protein structure]] with other toxins found in scorpions in North Africa and the Middle East, including the genera ''[[Buthus]]''<!-- C. R. Biologies 330 (2007) 80 --> and ''[[Centruroides]]''.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

== Target ==
The toxin acts affects sodium channel properties. The toxin can bind to many different sodium channels, including mammalian channels,<ref>http://protchem.hunnu.edu.cn/toxin/Interaction/InteractionDetail.jsp?ID=AT0000059</ref> although the effects on non-insect sodium channels have not yet been tested.

== Mode of action ==

BcTx1 acts on insect axonal sodium channels by lowering their activation threshold (by 5-10 mV), resulting in an increase of Na+ conductances.  It also shifts the steady-state inactivation curve in the negative direction (by ~15 mV). In addition, BcTx1 slows down the activation of sodium channels. As a result of its action on the sodium channels, neurons depolarize and can no longer fire action potentials, leading to a flaccid paralysis.
