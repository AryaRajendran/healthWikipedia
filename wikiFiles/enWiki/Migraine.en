'''Migraine''' is a chronic [[neurological disorder]] characterized by recurrent moderate to severe [[headache]]s often in association with a number of [[autonomic nervous system]] symptoms. The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἡμικρανία (''hemikrania''), "pain on one side of the head",<ref>{{cite web |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=ἡμικρανία |date= |work=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher= |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dh%28mikrani%2Fa}} on Perseus</ref> from ἡμι- (''hemi-''), "half", and κρανίον (''kranion''), "skull".<ref>{{cite book |first1=Kenneth |last1=Anderson |first2=Lois E. |last2=Anderson |first3=Walter D. |last3=Glanze |title=Mosby's Medical, Nursing, and Allied Health Dictionary |year=1994 |publisher=Mosby |isbn=978-0-8151-6111-0 |page=998 |edition=4th}}</ref>

<!--Signs and symptoms  -->
Typically the headache is unilateral (affecting one half of the head) and pulsating in nature, lasting from 2 to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[photophobia]] (increased sensitivity to light), [[hyperacusis|phonophobia]] (increased sensitivity to sound) and the pain is generally aggravated by physical activity.<ref name=ICHD2004>{{Cite journal|title=The International Classification of Headache Disorders: 2nd edition |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=24 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=9–160 |year=2004 |pmid=14979299 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2004.00653.x |author1= Headache Classification Subcommittee of the International Headache Society}} [http://www.i-h-s.org/upload/ct_clas/ihc_II_main_no_print.pdf as PDF]</ref> Up to one-third of people with migraine headaches perceive an [[Aura (symptom)|aura]]: a transient visual, sensory, language, or motor disturbance which signals that the headache will soon occur.<ref name=ICHD2004/> Occasionally an aura can occur with little or no headache following it.

<!--Management and epidemiology -->
Initial recommended management is with simple [[analgesics]] such as [[ibuprofen]] and [[acetaminophen]] (also known as paracetamol) for the headache, an [[antiemetic]] for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggers. Specific agents such as [[triptans]] or [[ergotamines]] may be used by those for whom simple analgesics are not effective. Globally, approximately 15% of the population is affected by migraines at some point in life.

==Signs and symptoms==
Migraines typically present with self-limited, recurrent severe [[headache]] associated with [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] symptoms.<ref name=Bart10/><ref name=Prognosis2008/> About 15-30% of people with migraines experience migraines with an [[aura (symptom)|aura]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Sharon A.|title=Quick reference neuroscience for rehabilitation professionals : the essential neurologic principles underlying rehabilitation practice|year=2008|publisher=SLACK|location=Thorofare, NJ|isbn=9781556428005|pages=231|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Ea0czzNxpkQC&pg=PA231|edition=2nd}}</ref><ref name=Gilmore2011/> and those who have migraines with aura also frequently have migraines without aura.<ref name=HA24/> The severity of the pain, duration of the headache, and frequency of attacks is variable.<ref name=Bart10/> A migraine lasting longer than 72 hours is termed [[status migrainosus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=ed.

===Aura phase===

An [[aura (symptom)|aura]] is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache.<ref name=Amin2009/> They appear gradually over a number of minutes and generally last fewer than 60&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=Tint2010/> Symptoms can be visual, sensory or motor in nature and many people experience more than one.<ref name=HA44/> Visual effects occur most frequently; they occur in up to 99% of cases and in more than 50% of cases are not accompanied by sensory or motor effects.<ref name=HA44/> Vision disturbances often consist of a [[scintillating scotoma]] (an area of partial alteration in the [[field of vision]] which flickers and may interfere with a person's ability to read or drive.)<ref name=Amin2009/> These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle.<ref name=HA44/> Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines.<ref name=HA44/> Some people lose part of their field of vision known as [[hemianopsia]] while others experience blurring.<ref name=HA44/>

Sensory aurae are the second most common type; they occur in 30-40% of people with auras.<ref name=HA44/> Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose-mouth area on the same side.<ref name=HA44/> Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of [[proprioceptive|position sense]].<ref name=HA44/> Other symptoms of the aura phase can include: speech or language disturbances, [[vertigo|world spinning]], and less commonly motor problems.<ref name=HA44/> Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine, and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras.<ref name=HA44/> 

An aura rarely occurs without a subsequent headache,<ref name=HA44>The Headaches Pg.407-419</ref> known as a [[silent migraine]]. However, it is difficult to assess the frequency of such cases, because patients who do not experience symptoms severe enough to drive them to seek treatment, may not realise that anything special is happening to them, and pass it off without reporting anything.

===Pain phase===
Classically the headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe in intensity.<ref name=Tint2010>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli)) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=1116–1117 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi=|accessdate=}}</ref> It usually comes on gradually<ref name=Tint2010/> and is aggravated by physical activity.<ref name=ICHD2004/> In more than 40% of cases however the pain may be bilateral, and neck pain is commonly associated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tepper|first=edited by Stewart J.

===Postdrome===
The effects of migraine may persist for some days after the main headache has ended; this is called the migraine [[postdrome]]. Many report a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed. The patient may feel tired or "hung over" and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness.<ref name="pmid16426278">{{Cite journal|author=Kelman L |title=The postdrome of the acute migraine attack |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=214–20 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16426278 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2005.01026.x}}</ref> According to one summary, "Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and [[malaise]]."<ref>{{cite book |author=Halpern, Audrey L.; Silberstein, Stephen D. |chapter=Ch. 9: The Migraine Attack—A Clinical Description |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7326/ |editor=Kaplan PW, Fisher RS |title=Imitators of Epilepsy |publisher=Demos Medical |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=1-888799-83-8 |pages= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7321/ |edition=2nd |id=NBK7326}}</ref>

===Genetics===
Studies of twins indicate a 34 to 51% genetic influence of likelihood to develop migraine headaches.<ref name=Lulli2007/> This genetic relationship is stronger for migraines with aura than for migraines without aura.<ref name=HA24/> A number of specific variants of genes increase the risk by a small to moderate amount.<ref name=Schurk2012/>

===Triggers===
Migraines may be induced by triggers, with some reporting it as an influence in a minority of cases<ref name=Bart10/> and others the majority.<ref name=Trigger09/> Many things have been labeled as triggers, however the strength and significance of these relationships are uncertain.<ref name=Trigger09>{{cite journal |author=Levy D, Strassman AM, Burstein R |title=A critical view on the role of migraine triggers in the genesis of migraine pain |journal=Headache |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=953–7 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19545256 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2009.01444.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin PR |title=Behavioral management of migraine headache triggers: learning to cope with triggers |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=221–7 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20425190 |doi=10.1007/s11916-010-0112-z }}</ref>  A trigger may be encountered up to 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms.<ref name=Bart10/>

===Aura===
[[Cortical spreading depression]] or spreading depression of [[Aristides Leão|Leão]] is bursts of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity, which is seen in those with migraines with an aura.<ref name=HA28>The Headaches, Chp. 28, pg 269-272</ref> There are a number of explanations for its occurrence including activation of [[NMDA receptor]]s leading to calcium entering the cell.<ref name=HA28/> After the burst of activity the blood flow to the [[cerebral cortex]] in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours.<ref name=HA28/> It is believed that when depolarization travels down the underside of the brain, nerves that sense pain in the head and neck are triggered.<ref name=HA28/>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of a migraine is based on signs and symptoms.<ref name=Bart10/> [[Neuroimaging|Imaging]] test are occasionally performed to exclude other causes of headaches.<ref name=Bart10/> It is believed that a substantial number of people with the condition have not been diagnosed.<ref name=Bart10/>

The diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the [[International Headache Society]], can be made according to the following criteria, the "5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria":<ref name=ICHD2004/>

*Five or more attacks—for migraine ''with'' aura, two attacks are sufficient for diagnosis.
*Four hours to three days in duration
*Two or more of the following:
**Unilateral (affecting half the head);
**Pulsating;
**"Moderate or severe pain intensity";
**"Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity"
*One or more of the following:
**Nausea and/or vomiting;
**Sensitivity to both light ([[photophobia]]) and sound ([[phonophobia]])

If someone experiences two of the following: photophobia, nausea, or inability to work / study for a day the diagnosis is more likely.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cousins|first=G|coauthors=Hijazze, S; Van de Laar, FA; Fahey, T|title=Diagnostic accuracy of the ID Migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Headache|date=2011 Jul-Aug|volume=51|issue=7|pages=1140–8|pmid=21649653|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2011.01916.x}}</ref> In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person's life, the probability that this is a migraine is 92%.<ref name=Gilmore2011/> In those with less than three of these symptoms the probability is 17%.<ref name=Gilmore2011/>

===Classification===
{{Main|ICHD classification and diagnosis of migraine}}
Migraines were first comprehensively classified in 1988.<ref name=HA24>The Headaches, Pg 232-233</ref> The [[International Headache Society]] most recently updated their classification of headaches in 2004.<ref name=ICHD2004/> According to this classification migraines are primary headaches along with [[tension-type headache]]s and [[cluster headache]]s, among others.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nappi|first=G|title=Introduction to the new International Classification of Headache Disorders.|journal=The journal of headache and pain|date=2005 Sep|volume=6|issue=4|pages=203–4|pmid=16362664|doi=10.1007/s10194-005-0185-y}}</ref> 

Migraines are divided into seven subclasses (some of which include further subdivisions):
*Migraine without aura, or "common migraine", involves migraine headaches that are not accompanied by an aura
*Migraine with aura, or "classic migraine", usually involves migraine headaches accompanied by an aura. Less commonly, an aura can occur without a headache, or with a nonmigraine headache. Two other varieties are [[familial hemiplegic migraine]] and [[sporadic hemiplegic migraine]], in which a person has migraines with aura and with accompanying motor weakness. If a close relative has had the same condition, it is called "familial", otherwise it is called "sporadic". Another variety is basilar-type migraine, where a headache and aura are accompanied by [[dysarthria|difficulty speaking]], [[Vertigo (medical)|world spinning]], [[tinnitus|ringing in ears]], or a number of other brainstem-related symptoms, but not motor weakness. This type was initially believed to be due to spasms of the [[basilar artery]], the artery that supplies the brainstem.<ref name=Basil2009/>
*Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine include [[cyclical vomiting syndrome|cyclical vomiting]] (occasional intense periods of vomiting), [[abdominal migraine]] (abdominal pain, usually accompanied by nausea), and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (occasional attacks of vertigo).
*[[Retinal migraine]] involves migraine headaches accompanied by visual disturbances or even temporary blindness in one eye.
*Complications of migraine describe migraine headaches and/or auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent, or associated with a seizure or brain lesion.
*Probable migraine describes conditions that have some characteristics of migraines, but where there is not enough evidence to diagnose it as a migraine with certainty (in the presence of concurrent medication overuse).
*Chronic migraine is a complication of migraines, and is a headache that fulfills diagnostic criteria for ''migraine headache'' and occurs for a greater time interval.  Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for longer than 3 months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Negro|first=A|coauthors=Rocchietti-March, M; Fiorillo, M; Martelletti, P|title=Chronic migraine: current concepts and ongoing treatments.|journal=European review for medical and pharmacological sciences|date=2011 Dec|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1401–20|pmid=22288302}}</ref>

===Abdominal migraine===
The diagnosis of [[abdominal migraine]]s is controversial.<ref name=Abdo2002>{{cite book|last=Davidoff|first=Robert A.|title=Migraine : manifestations, pathogenesis, and management|year=2002|publisher=Oxford Univ.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to a migraine headache include: [[temporal arteritis]], [[cluster headache]]s, [[acute glaucoma]], [[meningitis]] and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].<ref name=Gilmore2011/> Temporal arteritis typically occurs in people over 50 years old and presents with tenderness over the [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]], cluster headaches presents with one-sided nose stuffiness, tears and severe pain around the [[orbits]], acute glaucoma is associated with vision problems, meningitis with [[fever]]s, and subaracchnoid hemorrhage with a very fast onset.<ref name=Gilmore2011/> [[Tension headaches]] typically occur on both sides, are not pounding, and are less disabling.<ref name=Gilmore2011/>

==Prevention==
{{Main|Prevention of migraines}}
Preventive treatments of migraines include: medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery. Prevention is recommended in those who have headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate the medications used to treat acute attacks, or those with severe attacks that are not easily controlled.<ref name=Gilmore2011/>

The goal is to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or duration of migraines, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy.<ref name="AFP0601">{{Cite journal|author=Modi S, Lowder DM |title=Medications for migraine prophylaxis |journal=American Family Physician |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=72–8 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16417067 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=16417067}}</ref> Another reason for prevention is to avoid [[medication overuse headache]].

===Devices and surgery===
Medical devices, such as [[biofeedback]] and [[neurostimulator]]s, have some advantages in migraine prevention, mainly when common anti-migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse. Biofeedback helps people be conscious of some physiological parameters so as to control them and try to relax and may be efficient for migraine treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=111–27 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2006.09.007 |title=Efficacy of biofeedback for migraine: A meta-analysis |year=2007 |last1=Nestoriuc |first1=Yvonne |last2=Martin |first2=Alexandra |journal=Pain |volume=128 |pmid=17084028 |issue=1–2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18726688 |year=2008 |last1=Nestoriuc |first1=Y |last2=Martin |first2=A |last3=Rief |first3=W |last4=Andrasik |first4=F |title=Biofeedback treatment for headache disorders: A comprehensive efficacy review |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=125–40 |doi=10.1007/s10484-008-9060-3 |journal=Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback}}</ref> Neurostimulation uses implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraines with encouraging results for severe cases.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20816443 |year=2010 |last1=Schoenen |first1=J|last2=Allena |first2=M |last3=Magis |first3=D |title=Neurostimulation therapy in intractable headaches |volume=97|pages=443–50 |doi=10.1016/S0072-9752(10)97037-1 |journal=Handbook of clinical neurology / edited by P.J.
