'''Polycystic kidney disease''' ('''PKD''' or '''PCKD''', also known as polycystic kidney syndrome) is a [[cystic]] [[genetic disorder]] of the [[kidney]]s.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000955960|polycystic kidney disease}}</ref>  There are two types of PKD: [[autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease]] (ADPKD) and the less-common [[autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease]] (ARPKD).

It occurs in humans and some other animals. PKD is characterized by the presence of multiple [[cyst]]s (hence, "polycystic") typically in both [[kidney]]s; however 17% of cases initially present with observable disease in one kidney, with most cases progressing to bilateral disease in adulthood.<ref name="Bisceglia2006">{{cite journal|last=Bisceglia|first=M|coauthors=et al|title=Renal cystic diseases: a review|journal=Advanced Anatomic Pathology|year=2006|issue=13|pages=26–56}}</ref> The cysts are numerous and are fluid-filled, resulting in massive enlargement of the kidneys.  The disease can also damage the [[liver]], [[pancreas]] and, in some rare cases, the [[heart]] and [[brain]]. The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by their patterns of inheritance.

Polycystic kidney disease is one of the most common life-threatening genetic diseases, affecting an estimated 12.5 million people worldwide.<ref>Wilson PD. Polycystic kidney disease. N Engl J Med 2004;350:151-164</ref> 

==Types==
===Autosomal dominant===
[[File:Adpkd.jpg|thumb|CT scan showing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease]]
[[Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease]] (ADPKD) is the most common of all the hereditary cystic kidney diseases<ref name="Bisceglia2006" /><ref name="Torres2007">{{cite journal|last=Torres|first=WE|coauthors=Harris PC, Pirson Y|title=Autosomal dominant polycystic urology|journal=Lancet|year=2007|volume=369|issue=9569|pages=1287–301|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60601-1 }}</ref><ref name="Simons2006">{{cite journal|last=Simons|first=M|coauthors=Walz G|title=Polycystic kidney disease: cell division with a c(l)ue?|journal=Kidney International|year=2006|issue=70|pages=854–864}}</ref> with an incidence of 1 to 2:1,000  live births.<ref name="Bisceglia2006" /><ref name="Simons2006" /> Studies show that 10% of  [[end-stage renal disease]] ([[ESRD]]) patients being treated with hemodialysis in Europe and the U.S. were initially diagnosed and treated for ADPKD.<ref name="Bisceglia2006" /> ADPKD does not appear to demonstrate a preference for any particular ethnicity.  

ADPKD is characterized by progressive cyst development and bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts. There are three [[genetics|genetic]] mutations in the [[PKD1|PKD-1]], [[PKD2|PKD-2]], and PKD3 [[gene]] with similar phenotypical presentations. Gene [[PKD1|PKD-1]] is located on chromosome 16 and codes for a protein involved in regulation of cell cycle and intracellular calcium transport in epithelial cells, and is responsible for 85% of the cases of ADPKD. A group of voltage-linked calcium channels are coded for by [[PKD2|PKD-2]] on chromosome 4. PKD3 recently appeared in research papers as a postulated 3rd gene. At this time, PKD3 has not been proven.<ref name="Bisceglia2006" /><ref name="Torres2007" /> Fewer than 10% of cases of ADPKD appear in non-ADPKD families. 

Cyst formation begins [[in utero]] from any point along the [[nephron]], although  fewer than 5% of nephrons are thought to be involved. As the cysts accumulate fluid, they enlarge, separate entirely from the nephron, compress the neighboring renal [[parenchyma]], and progressively compromise [[renal function]].

Under the function of gene defect, [[epithelial cells]] of [[renal tubule]] turn into epithelial cells of cyst wall after [[phenotype change]], and begin to have the function of secreting cyst fluid, which leads to continuous cysts enlargement.<ref>梅长林，常染色体显性多囊肾病，肾脏病学，第三版，人民卫生出版社|year=2008,9|pages=1746</ref>

===Autosomal recessive===
Studies show that the incidence of [[autosomal recessive polycystic kidney]] disease (ARPKD) (OMIM #263200) is 1:20,000 live births and is typically identified in the first few weeks after birth. Unfortunately, resulting hypoplasia results in a 30% death rate in neonates with ARPKD.<ref name="Bisceglia2006" /> In ARPKD kidneys retain their shape but are larger than the normal anatomical range with dilated collecting ducts from the medulla to the cortex.

==Extrarenal manifestations==
The major extrarenal complications of ADPKD include cerebral aneurysms, hepatic cysts, pancreatic cysts, cardiac valve disease (especially mitral valve prolapse), colonic diverticula, and aortic root dilatation.

==Clinical trials and possible future treatments==
It is known that a certain molecule known as cAMP is involved in the enlargement of kidney cysts in PKD kidneys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/11/7/1179.abstract |title=cAMP Regulates Cell Proliferation and Cyst Formation in Autosomal Polycystic Kidney Disease Cells |publisher=Jasn.asnjournals.org |date=2000-07-01 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>  Various studies on rodents have shown that a molecule, called [[vasopressin]], increases levels of cAMP in the body.  When mice with PKD were given a chemical that blocks vasopressin, there was an impressive decrease in kidney size and some preservation of kidney function.  Similarly, when studied mice consumed excessive amounts of water (which decreases levels of vasopressin), a similar result was seen.  It has therefore been suggested that consuming large amounts of water may possibly assist in the treatment of early stage PKD.<ref>http://www.pkdcharity.co.uk/PKD%20Charity%20Newsletter%20Spring%202008.pdf</ref><ref>http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/4/6/1140.full.pdf</ref>

As humans do not always mimic rodents in clinical trials, it is currently not yet certain whether vasopressin inhibitors, such as water, will have corresponding results in humans, or what negative effects excessive water intake may have on the kidneys of individuals with PKD.  [[Clinical trials]] are currently underway in this field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00784030 |title=High Water Intake to Slow Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease - Full Text View |publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>

It has also been suggested that treatment with medications inhibiting vasopressin may assist in the management of PKD and reduce the speed at which kidney cysts form and grow, delaying the onset of end stage renal failure.  Clinical trials are currently underway in the testing of [[Tolvaptan]], a U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved medication which has not yet been approved for use in the treatment of PKD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/38392.php |title=Otsuka Maryland Research Institute, Inc. Granted Fast Track Designation For Tolvaptan In PKD |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>
