'''Gilda's Club''' (named in tribute to comic actress [[Gilda Radner]], who died of [[ovarian cancer]] in 1989), is a community organization for people living with cancer, their families and friends. Local chapters provide meeting places where men, women and children living with cancer and their families and friends join with others to build emotional and social support as a supplement to medical care. Free of charge and nonprofit, Gilda's Club chapters offer support and networking groups, lectures, workshops and social events in a nonresidential, homelike setting.  It is now known as the '''Cancer Support Community'''.

==History==
Gilda's Club was founded by Joanna Bull, Radner's cancer [[psychotherapist]] during the time she had cancer; Radner's husband, [[Gene Wilder]]; and broadcaster [[Joel Siegel]]. Radner's story can be read in her book, ''It's Always Something''.

The organization took its former name from Radner's comment that cancer gave her "membership to an elite club I'd rather not belong to".<ref>{{cite web| title = Gilda's Club Twin Cities: Who We Are| work = Website| publisher = Gilda's Club| url = http://www.gildasclubtwincities.org/whoweare/faqs/| accessdate = 2012-11-28}}</ref>

In July 2009, Gilda’s Club Worldwide merged with [[The Wellness Community]], another established cancer support organization to create the Cancer Support Community (CSC).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2009/04100/Wellness_Community___Gilda_s_Club_May_Merge.5.aspx| title=Wellness Community & Gilda's Club May Merge | work=Oncology Times | date=10 April 2009 - Volume 31, Issue 7, pp 8-10 | accessdate=November 28, 2012}} Retrieved on November 28, 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.curetoday.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/blog.showIndex/susanmcclure/2009/12/14/Gildas-Club-and-The-Wellness-Community-Join-Forces | title=Gilda's Club and The Wellness Community Join Forces | work=Cure | first=Susan | last=McClure | date=December 14, 2009 | accessdate=November 28, 2012}} Retrieved on November 28, 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/merging-to-increase-mission-impact-3966 | title=Merging to Increase Mission Impact | work=The NonProfit Times | accessdate=November 28, 2012}} Retrieved on November 28, 2012</ref> As of 2012, there were over 20 active local affiliates of Gilda’s Club.
