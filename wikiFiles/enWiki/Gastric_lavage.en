'''Gastric [[lavage]]''', also commonly called '''stomach pumping''' or '''gastric irrigation''', is the process of cleaning out the contents of the [[stomach]]. It has been used for over 200 years as a means of eliminating poisons from the stomach. Such devices are normally used on a person who has ingested a [[poison]] or [[drug overdose|overdosed]] on a [[psychoactive drug|drug]] such as [[alcohol]]. They may also be used before [[surgery]], to clear the contents of the [[digestive tract]] before it is opened. 

Apart from toxicology, gastric lavage (or nasogastric lavage) is sometimes used to confirm levels of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="FleisherLudwig2002">{{cite book|author1=Gary R.

==Technique==
Gastric lavage involves the passage of a tube (such as an ''Ewald tube'') via the mouth or nose down into the stomach followed by sequential administration and removal of small volumes of liquid. The placement of the tube in the stomach must be confirmed either by air insufflation while listening to the stomach, by pH testing a small amount of aspirated stomach contents, or x-ray. This is to ensure the tube is not in the lungs. In adults, small amounts of warm water or saline are administered and, via a siphoning action, removed again. In children, normal saline is used, as children are more at risk of developing [[hyponatremia]] if lavaged with water. Because of the possibility of vomiting, a suction device is always on hand in case of pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents. Lavage is repeated until the returning fluid shows no further gastric contents. If the patient is unconscious or cannot protect their airway then the patient should be [[Intubation|intubated]] before performing lavage. The person must be put to sleep for a period of time during the operation due to its high risk of shock and hyponatremia.

===Indications===

Gastric lavage is used infrequently in modern poisonings and some authorities have suggested that it not be used routinely, if ever, in poisoning situations.<ref name="jtoxclintox2004-vale">{{cite journal | author=Vale JA, Kulig K; American Academy of Clinical Toxicology; European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists. | title=Position paper: gastric lavage | journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | year=2004 | pages=933–43 | volume=42 | issue=7 | pmid=15641639 | doi=10.1081/CLT-200045006}}</ref> Lavage should only be considered if the amount of poison ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=975 |title=BestBets: Method of gut decontamination |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Lavage is also the initial treatment for [[duodenal atresia]] in newborns, a condition where the small intestine is closed distal to the stomach, causing food and fluid to accumulate in the stomach.

===Contraindications===

Lavage is [[contraindicated]] when patients have a compromised, unprotected airway and in patients at risk of gastrointestinal [[hemorrhage]] or perforation. Relative contraindications include when the poisoning is due to a corrosive substance ({{ICD10|T|54||t|51}}), hydrocarbons ({{ICD10|T|53||t|51}}), or for poisons that have an effective [[antidote]].

===Alternatives===
An alternative for gastric lavage is the oral administration of [[activated carbon]], a form of carbon with a large surface area for binding poisons, preventing absorption by the [[gastrointestinal tract]].

==Complications==

Many complications have been reported, although it appears serious complications are uncommon. The most dangerous risk is [[aspiration pneumonia]], which is more likely to occur if hydrocarbons are ingested or in patients without a protected airway. Other complications include [[laryngospasm]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[bradycardia]], [[epistaxis]], [[hyponatremia]], [[hypochloremia]], [[water intoxication]], or mechanical injury to the stomach.
