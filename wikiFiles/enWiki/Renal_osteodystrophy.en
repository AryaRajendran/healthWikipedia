'''Renal osteodystrophy''' or '''chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)'''<ref name="pmid19222724">{{cite journal |author=Svára F |title=Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD): a new term for a complex approach |journal=J Ren Care |volume=35 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=3–6 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19222724 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-6686.2009.00067.x |url=}}</ref> is a [[bone]] [[pathology]], characterized by bone mineralization deficiency, that is a direct result of the [[electrolyte]] and [[endocrine]] derangements that accompany [[chronic kidney disease]]. Renal osteodystrophy can be further divided into metabolic states associated with either high or low bone turnover.  

==Signs and symptoms==
Renal osteodystrophy may exhibit no symptoms; if it does show symptoms, they include:
*[[Bone pain]]
*[[Arthralgia|Joint pain]]
*Bone deformation
*[[Bone fracture]]

==Diagnosis==
Renal osteodystrophy is usually diagnosed after treatment for [[Chronic kidney disease|end-stage renal disease]] begins.  Blood tests will indicate decreased [[calcium]] and [[calcitriol]] (vitamin D) and increased [[phosphate]] and [[parathyroid hormone]].  X-rays will also show bone features of renal osteodystropy ([[chondrocalcinosis]] at the knees and [[pubic symphysis]], [[osteopenia]] and bone fractures) but may be difficult to differentiate from other conditions.

==Pathogenesis==
Renal osteodystrophy is thought to be the result of [[hyperparathyroidism]] secondary to [[hyperphosphatemia]] combined with [[hypocalcaemia]], both of which are due to decreased excretion of phosphate by the damaged kidney. Low activated [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] levels are a result of the damaged kidneys' inability to convert vitamin D<sub>3</sub> into its active form, [[calcitriol]], and result in further [[hypocalcaemia]].

==Differential diagnosis==
To confirm diagnosis, renal osteodystrophy must be distinguished from:
*[[osteoporosis]] (Alk Phos and PO<sub>4</sub> usually normal)
*[[osteopenia]] 
*[[osteomalacia]]
*[[hyperparathyroidism]]
*[[multiple myeloma]]
*[[soft tissue calcification]]
*[[chondrocalcinosis]]
*[[hypervitaminosis]]

==Treatment==
Treatment for renal osteodystrophy includes:
*calcium and [[vitamin D]] supplementation 
*restriction of dietary phosphate 
*[[phosphate binders]] such as [[calcium carbonate]], [[calcium acetate]], [[sevelamer]] hydrochloride, or [[lanthanum carbonate]] 
*[[cinacalcet]]
*[[renal transplantation]]
*[[hemodialysis]] five times a week is thought to be of benefit<ref name=bonomini>{{cite journal |author=Bonomini V, Mioli V, Albertazzi A, Scolari P |title=Daily-dialysis programme: indications and results |journal=Nephrol.

==Prognosis==
Recovery from renal osteodystrophy has been observed post renal transplantation.  Renal osteodystrophy is a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition with a conventional hemodialysis schedule.<ref name=bonomini/>
