The '''University of Tirana''' (UT) ({{lang-sq|Universiteti i Tiranës}}) is a [[public university]] located in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]].

==History==
UT was founded in 1957 as the '''State University of Tirana''' (''Universiteti Shtetëror i Tiranës'') through the merging of five existing [[institute]]s of [[higher education]], the most important of which was the Institute of Sciences, founded in 1947. Between April 13, 1985 and 1992 (during the [[communist regime]]), UT was called the '''Enver Hoxha University of Tirana''' (''Universiteti i Tiranës "Enver Hoxha"'') after the Albanian dictator [[Enver Hoxha]], who died on April 11, 1985.

==Academics and Size==
UT is the largest and highest [[university ranking|ranking]] [[university]] in [[Albania]].<ref>[http://www.webometrics.info/rank_by_country.asp?country=al&zoom_highlight=university+of+tirana Ranking Web of World Universities]</ref> It includes eight [[college]]s, 50 [[academic department]]s, and 41 [[study program]]s or [[major]]s. Most programs are offered in [[Tirana]]; a few smaller [[affiliated campus]]es are located in other [[Albanian cities]], including [[Saranda]] in the South and [[Kukës]] in the North. 

UT offers three-year [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]], one or two year [[Master's degree|Master]], and three to five year [[Doctorate]] degree programs, in accordance with the [[Bologna system]]. 

More than 14,000 [[student]]s attend UT. UT employs more that 600 [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] members.
