{{Distinguish|Erb's point (cardiology)}}
In [[neurology]], '''Erb's point''' or  the '''punctum nervosum'''<ref>[http://lf1ep.wetpaint.com/page/Anatomy+Dissections Anatomy Dissections - LF1 English Parallel]</ref> is a site at the lateral root of the [[brachial plexus]] located 2â€“3 cm above the [[clavicle]]. 
It is named for [[Wilhelm Heinrich Erb]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|942}}</ref> Taken together, there are six types of nerves that meet at this point.

==Convergence of nerves==
Erb's point is formed by the union of the [[Lateral pectoral nerve|C5]] and [[Lateral pectoral nerve|C6]] nerve roots, which later converge. At the nerve trunk, branches of [[suprascapular nerves]] and the [[nerve to the subclavius]] also merge. The merged nerve divides into the [[anterior]] and [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] division of C5 and C6.

==Clinical significance==
Injury to Erb's point is commonly sustained at birth or from a fall onto the [[shoulder]]. The nerve roots normally involved are C5 and partly C6. Symptoms include paralysis of the [[biceps]], [[brachialis]], and [[coracobrachialis]] (through the [[musculocutaneous nerve]]); the [[brachioradialis]] (through the [[radial nerve]]); and the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]] (through the [[axillary nerve]]). The effect is called "[[Erb's palsy]]". Typically, an affected person's arm hangs at the side with the hand rotated medially, like a [[Porter (doorkeeper)|porter]] waiting for a tip; hence the colloquial name "porter's tip hand".<ref>Moore, Keith L.
