In medicine, '''wasting''', also known as '''wasting syndrome''', refers to the process by which a debilitating [[disease]] causes [[muscle]] and [[fat]] [[biological tissue|tissue]] to "waste" away. Wasting is sometimes referred to as "acute malnutrition" because it is believed that episodes of wasting have a short duration, in contrast to [[stunted growth|stunting]], which is regarded as chronic malnutrition. According to the latest UN estimates, an estimated 52 million children under 5 years of age, or 8%, were wasted in 2011. The vast majority, about 70%, of the world's wasted children live in Asia, most in South-Central Asia.<ref>United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund, World Health Organization, The World Bank. UNICEFWHO- World Bank Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates. (UNICEF, New York; WHO, Geneva; The World Bank, Washington, DC; 2012)</ref>

==Causes==
Wasting can be caused by an extremely low energy intake (e.g., caused by [[famine]]), nutrient losses due to [[infection]], or a combination of low intake and high loss. Infections and conditions associated with wasting include [[tuberculosis]], chronic [[diarrhea]], [[AIDS]], and [[superior mesenteric artery syndrome]]. The mechanism may involve [[cachectin]] - also called tumor necrosis factor, a [[macrophage]]-secreted [[cytokine]]. Caretakers and health providers can sometimes contribute to wasting if the patient is placed on an improper diet. Voluntary weight loss and [[eating disorder]]s are excluded as causes of wasting.

==Classification==
*Children: Weight-for-height (WFH). In infants under 24 months, recumbent (supine) length is used. WFH as % of median reference value is calculated this way:

:<math>\mathrm{WFH} = \frac{\mbox{weight of a given child}}{\mbox{median weight for a given child of that height}} \times 100</math>

Cutoff points may vary, but <80% (close to -2 [[Z-score]]) is often used.

*Adults: 
**[[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) is the quotient between weight and height squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). An individual with a BMI < 18.5 is regarded as a case of wasting.
**Percent of body weight lost (At Tufts, an unintentional loss of 6% or more in 6 months is regarded as wasting)
