'''Percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling''' (PUBS), also called '''cordocentesis''', is a diagnostic [[genetic testing|genetic test]] that examines blood from the [[fetus|fetal]] [[umbilical cord]]<ref name="urlHuman Reproduction, Lectures: Clinical Genetics">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/kw/human_reprod/lectures/clinical_genetics/ |title=Human Reproduction, Lectures: Clinical Genetics |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-02-11}}</ref> to detect fetal abnormalities. PUBS provides a means of rapid chromosome analysis and is useful when information cannot be obtained through [[amniocentesis]], [[chorionic villus sampling|CVS]], or [[ultrasound]] (or if the results of these tests were inconclusive). This test carries a significant risk of complication and is typically reserved for [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] determined to be at high risk for [[genetic defect]].

==Procedure==
PUBS is similar to amniocentesis, but instead of sampling the [[amniotic fluid]] which surrounds the fetus, PUBS examines fetal blood. An advanced imaging ultrasound determines the location for needle insertion into the placenta, and the needle is guided through the mother's abdomen and [[uterus|uterine wall]] into the fetal vein of the umbilical cord, where a fetal blood sample is removed. The sample can then be sent for chromosomal analysis. The entire process lasts 45 minutes to an hour. Because the fetal vein is fragile early in pregnancy, PUBS is performed no earlier than 17 weeks into pregnancy.

PUBS testing has a turnaround time of about 72 hours and can detect chromosomal abnormalities, blood disorder, some metabolic disorders, infections, and some causes of structural problems.<ref name="urlPenn Pregnancy Health Center: Percutaneous Umbilical Cord Blood Sampling (PUBS)">{{cite web |url=http://pennhealth.com/health_info/pregnancy/000229.htm |title=Penn Pregnancy Health Center: Percutaneous Umbilical Cord Blood Sampling (PUBS) |work= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> PUBS has largely replaced [[fetoscopy]], which has a much higher rate of [[miscarriage]].

It has been used with mothers with [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]].<ref name="pmid9949634">{{cite journal |author=Vianelli N, Baravelli S, Milano V, Rizzo N, Catani L, Tura S |title=Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling in the management of immune thrombocytopenic purpura during pregnancy |journal=Haematologica |volume=83 |issue=12 |pages=1127â€“8 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9949634 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Risks==
Miscarriage is the primary risk associated with PUBS and occurs in 1-2% of procedures. Additional possible complications are similar to those for amniocentesis and include [[bleeding|blood loss]] at the puncture site, [[infection]], and premature rupture of membranes. During the procedure, the mother may feel discomfort similar to a [[menstrual cramp]].
