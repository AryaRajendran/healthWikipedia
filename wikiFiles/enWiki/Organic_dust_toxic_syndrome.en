'''Organic dust toxic syndrome''' (ODTS) is a potentially severe [[flu-like]] syndrome originally described in farmers, mushroom workers, bird breeders and other persons occupationally exposed to dusty conditions.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms arise 4–12 hours after exposure to an organic dust, and generally last from one to five days. Common generalised symptoms include [[fever]] over 38 °C, chills, [[myalgia]] and [[malaise]]. The most frequent respiratory symptoms are [[dyspnea]] and a [[dry cough]], while a wheeze may be present less commonly. [[Headache]], [[rhinitis]], [[conjunctivitis]] and [[keratitis]] can also be present, and skin [[irritation]] may occur in those handling grain.<ref name=Seifert03/>

Respiratory function may worsen to the point where [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] occurs, and damage to the airways may lead to non-cardiogenic [[pulmonary edema]] one to three days post exposure.<ref name=Seifert03/>

Laboratory investigations may show a raised [[white blood cell|white cell]] (and specifically [[neutrophil]]) count, while a chest X-ray is often normal or shows minimal [[Infiltration (medical)|interstitial infiltration]].<ref name=Seifert03/>

==Causes==
An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reaction of the airways and [[alveoli]], the mechanism of organic dust toxic syndrome is thought to be toxic rather than [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] in origin.<ref name=linaker03>{{cite journal |author=Linaker C, Smedley J |title=Respiratory illness in agricultural workers |journal=Occup Med (Lond) |volume=52 |issue=8 |pages=451–59 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12488515 |url= http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/8/451.long}}</ref> The airways are exposed to high concentrations of organic dust created by some form of disturbance or mechanical process. They can be such materials such as grain kernel fragments, bits of insects, bacteria, fungal spores, molds or chemical residues, the individual particles 0.1 to 50&nbsp;microns in size.<ref name=Seifert03/> A common scenario is exposure to moldy grain, hay or woodchips, with farmers and pig workers the most common occupations affected. Those who work with grain, poultry and mushrooms also frequently report symptoms.<ref name=Seifert03/>

==Course and treatment==
The illness is generally [[Self-limiting (biology)|self-limiting]]. Management on the whole is preventative, by limiting exposure to mouldy environments with ventilation, or by wearing respiratory protection such as facemasks.<ref name=Seifert03/>

==History==
It was recognised as a distinct clinical syndrome in the 1980s. Previously, cases had been reported and given various names such as pulmonary mycotoxicosis, silo unloader’s syndrome, grain fever, toxin fever, humidiﬁer fever, mill fever, toxic alveolitis or allergic alveolitis.<ref name=Seifert03>{{cite journal |author=Seifert SA, Von Essen S, Jacobitz K, Crouch R, Lintner CP |title=Organic dust toxic syndrome: a review |journal=J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=185–93 |year=2003 |pmid=12733858}}</ref> In 1994, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] published case reports and highlighted the urgency for study of the syndrome.<ref name="NIOSH94">{{cite journal|last=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)|date=April 1994|title=Request for Assistance in Preventing Organic Dust Toxic Syndrome|journal=DHHS (NIOSH) Publication Number|issue=94–102|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/94-102/}}</ref>

Research and data collection in the agricultural industry is difficult, as many workers are casual.<ref name=linaker03/>
