===New Orleans Intervention program===
In 1998, Zeanah, together with J.A. Larrieu, devised the [[Attachment-based therapy (children)#New Orleans Intervention/Tulane Infant Team|New Orleans Intervention]], a treatment and prevention program aimed at developmental and health needs of children under the age of five who have been maltreated and placed in [[foster care]], with particular reference to their attachment status and needs. This program is currently in the process of being evaluated.<ref name="Larrieu & Zeanah">{{cite journal | last1 = Larrieu | first1 = JA | last2 = Zeanah | first2 = CH | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1998 | title = Intensive intervention for maltreated infants and toddlers in foster care | url = | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 357–371 | pmid = 9894069 }}</ref><ref name="Larrieu & Zeanah (2004)">Larrieu JA, Zeanah CH (2004).

===Practice parameters for attachment disorders===
In a series of papers from 1996 onwards, Zeanah and N. Boris, building on the earlier work of A.F. Lieberman,{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} proposed new practice parameters for the categorization of attachment disorders, currently categorized as [[reactive attachment disorder]] and [[disinhibited attachment disorder]] in DSM-IV-TR, the revised fourth edition of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), and the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10). The first new category is ''disorder of attachment,'' in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver, parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second is ''secure base distortion'', where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. The third is ''disrupted attachment''. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed.<ref name="Boris &amp; Zeanah (1999)">{{cite journal |author=Boris NW, Zeanah CH |year=1999 |title= Disturbance and disorders of attachment in infancy: An overview|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal |volume=20|pages=1–9 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199921)20:1<1::AID-IMHJ1>3.0.CO;2-V }}</ref> This form of categorization may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM and ICD classifications, but further research is required.<ref name="Zeanah 2000">Zeanah CH (2000).
