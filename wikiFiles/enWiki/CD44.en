The '''CD44 antigen''' is a [[cell (biology)|cell]]-surface [[glycoprotein]] involved in cell–cell interactions, cell adhesion and migration. In humans, the CD44 antigen is encoded by the ''CD44'' [[gene]] on Chromosome 11.<ref name="pmid2454887">{{cite journal | author = Spring FA, Dalchau R, Daniels GL, Mallinson G, Judson PA, Parsons SF, Fabre JW, Anstee DJ | title = The Ina and Inb blood group antigens are located on a glycoprotein of 80,000 MW (the CDw44 glycoprotein) whose expression is influenced by the In(Lu) gene | journal = Immunology | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–43 | year = 1988 | month = May | pmid = 2454887 | pmc = 1385183 | doi = | url =  }}</ref>

== Tissue distribution and isoforms ==

CD44 is expressed in a large number of mammalian cell types.  The standard [[protein isoform|isoform]], designated CD44s, comprising [[exon]]s 1–5 and 16–20 is expressed in most cell types.   CD44 splice variants containing variable exons are designated CD44v.  Some [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] also express a larger isoform (CD44E), which includes exons v8–10.<ref name="pmid10694938">{{cite journal | author = Goodison S, Urquidi V, Tarin D | title = CD44 cell adhesion molecules | journal = MP, Mol.

== Function ==

CD44 is a receptor for [[hyaluronic acid]] and can also interact with other [[ligand]]s, such as [[osteopontin]], [[collagen]]s, and [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s (MMPs).  CD44 function is controlled by its posttranslational modifications.  One critical modification involves discrete sialofucosylations rendering the selectin-binding glycoform of CD44 called HCELL (for Hematopoietic Cell E-selectin/L-selectin Ligand).  The HCELL glycoform was originally discovered on human hematopoietic stem cells and leukemic blasts,<ref name="pmid7524735">{{cite journal | author = Oxley SM, Sackstein R | title = Detection of an L-selectin ligand on a hematopoietic progenitor cell line | journal = Blood | volume = 84 | issue = 10 | pages = 3299–306 | year = 1994 | month = November | pmid = 7524735 | doi = | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid11023510">{{cite journal | author = Sackstein R, Dimitroff CJ | title = A hematopoietic cell L-selectin ligand that is distinct from PSGL-1 and displays N-glycan-dependent binding activity | journal = Blood | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 2765–74 | year = 2000 | month = October | pmid = 11023510 | doi = | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid18193058">{{cite journal | author = Sackstein R, Merzaban JS, Cain DW, Dagia NM, Spencer JA, Lin CP, Wohlgemuth R | title = Ex vivo glycan engineering of CD44 programs human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell trafficking to bone | journal = Nat.

This protein participates in a wide variety of cellular functions including [[lymphocyte]] activation,  recirculation and homing, [[hematopoiesis]], and [[tumor]] [[metastasis]]. Transcripts for this [[gene]] undergo complex [[alternative splicing]] that results in many functionally distinct [[isoform]]s; however, the full length nature of some of these variants has not been determined. Alternative splicing is the basis for the structural and functional diversity of this protein, and may be related to tumor metastasis.  Splice variants of CD44 on colon cancer cells display sialofucosylated HCELL glycoforms that serve as P-, L-, and E-selectin ligands and fibrin, but not fibrinogen, receptors under hemodynamic flow conditions pertinent to the process of cancer metastasis.  CD44 gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] is at least in part activated by [[beta-catenin]] and [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt signalling]] (also linked to tumour development).

== Clinical significance ==

The protein is a determinant for the [[Indian blood group system]].

* CD44, along with [[CD25]], is used to track early [[T cell]] development in the [[thymus]].

* CD44 expression is an indicative marker for effector-memory T-cells. Memory cell proliferation (activation) can also be assayed ''in vitro'' with [[Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester|CFSE]] chemical tagging.

In addition, variations in CD44 are reported as cell surface markers for some breast and prostate [[cancer stem cells]].In breast cancer research CD44+/CD24- expression is commonly used as a marker for breast CSCs and is used to sort breast cancer cells into a population enriched in cells with stem-like characteristics.  <ref name="pmid17179981">{{cite journal | author = Li F, Tiede B, Massagué J, Kang Y | title = Beyond tumorigenesis: cancer stem cells in metastasis | journal = Cell Res. | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–14 | year = 2007 | month = January | pmid = 17179981 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cr.7310118 | url =  }}</ref> and has been seen as an indicator of increased survival time in [[epithelial]] [[ovarian cancer]] patients.<ref name="pmid14614016">{{cite journal | author = Sillanpää S, Anttila MA, Voutilainen K, Tammi RH, Tammi MI, Saarikoski SV, Kosma VM | title = CD44 expression indicates favorable prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer | journal = Clin.

==CD44 in Cancer==

CD44 is a multistructural and multifunctional [[Cell adhesion molecule|cell surface molecule]] involved in [[Cell growth|cell proliferation]], [[Cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]], [[Cell migration|cell migration]], [[Angiogenesis|angiogenesis]], presentation of [[Cytokines|cytokines]], [[Chemokines|chemokynes]], and growth factors to the corresponding [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], and docking of [[Protease|proteases]] at the [[Cell membrane|cell membrane]], as well as in signaling for [[Apoptosis|cell survival]]. All these biological properties are essential to the physiological activities of normal cells, but they are also associated with the pathologic activities of [[Cancer cell|cancer cells]]. Experiments in animals have shown that targeting of CD44 by [[Antibody|antibodies]], [[Antisense therapy|antisense]],and CD44-soluble proteins markedly reduces the malignant activities of various [[Neoplasm|neoplasms]], stressing the therapeutic potential of anti-CD44 agents. Furthermore, because [[Alternative splicing|alternative splicing]] and [[Posttranslational modification|posttranslational modifications]] generate many different CD44 sequences, including, perhaps, tumor-specific sequences, the production of anti-CD44 tumor-specific agents may be a realistic therapeutic approach. However, in many cancers ([[Renal cell carcinoma|renal cancer]] and [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma|non-Hodgkin's lymphomas]] are exceptions), a high level of CD44 expression is not always associated with an unfavorable outcome. On the contrary, in some neoplams CD44 [[Downregulation and upregulation|upregulation]] is associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, in many cases different research groups analyzing the same neoplastic disease reached contradictory conclusions regarding the correlation between CD44 expression and disease prognosis, possibly due to differences in methodology. These problems must be resolved before applying anti-CD44 therapy to human cancers. <ref> {{cite journal|last=Naor, David et al. |title=CD44 in cancer.|journal=Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences 39.6 (2002): 527-579}}</ref>

In 2013 an international team of researchers led by Dr Thomas Kipps from the [[University of California, San Diego]], has identified a humanized [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] specific for CD44 that targets and directly kills chronic  [[Lymphoid leukemia| lymphocytic leukemia]] cells.<ref> {{cite journal|last=Zhang et al. |title=Targeting chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for CD44|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2013)|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/03/22/1221841110.abstract}}</ref>
Their research, published in the Proceedings of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in Mar, 2013, represents a potential new therapy for treating at least some patients with chronic [[Lymphoid leukemia|lymphocytic leukemia]] cells. <ref>{{cite journal|title=Scientists Identify Antibody that Kills Leukemia Cells, Sci-news, Mar 26, 2013|url=http://www.sci-news.com/medicine/article00959.html }}</ref>
