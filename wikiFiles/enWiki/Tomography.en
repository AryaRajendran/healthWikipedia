'''Tomography''' refers to imaging by sections or sectioning, through the use of any kind of penetrating [[wave]]. A device used in tomography is called a '''tomograph''', while the image produced is a '''tomogram'''. Tomography as the computed tomographic (CT) scanner was invented by [[Godfrey Hounsfield|Sir Godfrey Hounsfield]], and thereby made an exceptional contribution to medicine. The method is used in [[radiology]], [[archaeology]], [[biology]], [[geophysics]], [[oceanography]], [[materials science]], [[astrophysics]], [[quantum Information]], and other sciences. In most cases it is based on the mathematical procedure called [[tomographic reconstruction]].

==Etymology==
The word ''tomography'' is derived from the Greek ''tomē'' ("cut") or  ''tomos'' ("part" or "section") and ''graphein'' ("to write").

==Description==
In conventional medical [[X-ray]] tomography, clinical staff make a sectional image through a body by moving an X-ray source and the film in opposite directions during the exposure. Consequently, structures in the focal plane appear sharper, while structures in other planes appear blurred.<ref>{{MeshName|Tomography}}</ref> By modifying the direction and extent of the movement, operators can select different focal planes which contain the structures of interest. Before the advent of more modern computer-assisted techniques, this technique, developed in the 1930s by the radiologist [[Alessandro Vallebona]], proved useful in reducing the problem of superimposition of structures in [[projection screen|projectional]] (shadow) [[radiography]].

In a 1953 article in the medical journal [[Chest (journal)|''Chest'']], B. Pollak of the [[Fort William Sanatorium]] described the use of planography, another term for tomography.<ref>{{cite journal

==Modern tomography==
More modern variations of tomography involve gathering projection data from multiple directions and feeding the data into a [[tomographic reconstruction]] [[software]] [[algorithm]] processed by a computer.<ref name="ref1">

Some recent advances rely on using simultaneously integrated physical phenomena, e.g. X-rays for both [[computed tomography|CT]] and [[angiography]], combined [[computed tomography|CT]]/[[MRI]] and combined [[computed tomography|CT]]/[[Positron Emission Tomography|PET]].

The term ''volume imaging'' might describe these technologies more accurately than the term ''tomography''. However, in the majority of cases in clinical routine, staff request output from these procedures as 2-D slice images. As more and more clinical decisions come to depend on more advanced volume visualization techniques, the terms ''tomography/tomogram'' may go out of fashion.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Many different [[reconstruction algorithm]]s exist. Most algorithms fall into one of two categories: [[filtered back projection]] (FBP) and [[iterative reconstruction]] (IR). These procedures give inexact results: they represent a compromise between accuracy and computation time required. FBP demands fewer computational resources, while IR generally produces fewer artifacts (errors in the reconstruction) at a higher computing cost.<ref name="ref1">Herman, G. T., Fundamentals of computerized tomography: Image reconstruction from projection, 2nd edition, Springer, 2009</ref>

Although  [[MRI]] and  [[ultrasound]] make cross sectional images they don't acquire data from different directions. In MRI spatial information is obtained by using magnetic fields. In ultrasound, spatial information is obtained simply by focusing and aiming a pulsed ultrasound beam.

==Synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy==
Recently a new technique called [[synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy]] (SRXTM) allows for detailed three dimensional scanning of fossils.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Discrete tomography]] and [[Geometric tomography]], on the other hand, are research areas{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that deal with the reconstruction of objects that are discrete (such as crystals) or homogeneous. They are concerned with reconstruction methods, and as such they are not restricted to any of the particular (experimental) tomography methods listed above.
