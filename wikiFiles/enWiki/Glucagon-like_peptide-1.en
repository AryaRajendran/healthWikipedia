'''Glucagon-like peptide-1''' (GLP-1) is derived from the transcription product of the [[proglucagon]] gene. The major source of GLP-1 in the body is the [[intestine|intestinal]] [[L cell]] that secretes GLP-1 as a [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] [[hormone]]. The biologically active forms of GLP-1 are: GLP-1-(7-37) and GLP-1-(7-36)NH2. Those peptides result from selective cleavage of the [[proglucagon]] molecule. 

GLP-1 secretion by ileal L cells is dependent on the presence of nutrients in the lumen of the small intestine.  The [[secretagogue]]s (agents that cause or stimulate secretion) of this hormone include major nutrients like [[carbohydrate]], [[protein]] and [[lipid]]. Once in the circulation, GLP-1 has a half-life of less than 2 minutes, due to rapid degradation by the enzyme [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]].
It is a potent antihyperglycemic hormone, inducing glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion  while suppressing glucagon secretion. Such glucose-dependent action is particularly attractive because, when the plasma glucose concentration is in the normal fasting range, GLP-1 no longer stimulates insulin to cause hypoglycemia. GLP-1 appears to restore the glucose sensitivity of pancreatic β-cells, with the mechanism possibly involving the increased expression of [[GLUT2]] and [[glucokinase]]. GLP-1 is also known to inhibit pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of insulin-secreting β-cells. In addition, GLP-1 inhibits gastric secretion and motility. This delays and protracts carbohydrate absorption and contributes to a satiating effect.

==Physiological functions==
GLP-1 possesses several physiological properties that make it (and its [[GLP-1 analog|analog]]s) a subject of intensive investigation as a potential treatment of [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewprogram/3418_pnt "Diabetes and Intestinal Incretin Hormones: A New Therapeutic Paradigm" at medscape.com (slide 36)]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Toft-Nielsen M, Madsbad S, Holst J | title=Determinants of the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 in type 2 diabetes | journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume=86 | issue=8 | pages=3853–60 | year=2001 | pmid=11502823 | doi=10.1210/jc.86.8.3853}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Meier J, Weyhe D, Michaely M, Senkal M, Zumtobel V, Nauck M, Holst J, Schmidt W, Gallwitz B | title=Intravenous glucagon-like peptide 1 normalizes blood glucose after major surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes | journal=Crit Care Med | volume=32 | issue=3 | pages=848–51 | year=2004 | pmid=15090972 | doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000114811.60629.B5}}</ref> The known physiological functions of GLP-1 include:
* increases [[insulin]] secretion from the [[pancreas]] in a [[glucose]]-dependent manner.
* decreases [[glucagon]] secretion from the [[pancreas]] by engagement of a specific [[G protein-coupled receptor]].
* increases insulin-sensitivity in both [[alpha cell|alpha cells]] and [[beta cell|beta cells]]
* increases [[beta cells]] mass and insulin gene expression, post-translational processing and incretion.
* inhibits acid secretion and gastric emptying in the [[stomach]].
* decreases food intake by increasing [[satiety]] in brain.
* promotes insulin sensitivity.

As evidence of the physiological role of GLP-1 in post-prandial insulin secretion, it has been shown that an oral dose of glucose triggers a much higher peak in plasma insulin concentration compared to an intravenous dose.
