'''Julius Althaus''' (31 March 1833{{spaced ndash}}11 June 1900) was a German-English physician.  He conducted early electrical treatment of patients at [[King's College Hospital]] and he was mainly instrumental in creating the [[Maida Vale Hospital for Nervous Diseases]].<ref name=bladin/>

==Biography==
Born in [[Lippe-Detmold]], Germany, on 31 March 1833, Althaus was the fourth and youngest son of Friedrich Althaus and Julie Draescke.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Althaus, Julius}}</ref> His father was general superintendent of Lippe-Detmold, a Protestant dignity equal to the Anglican rural dean; his mother was a daughter of the last Protestant bishop of [[Magdeburg]]. He received his classical education at the [[University of Bonn]], and began his medical studies at [[Göttingen]] in 1851 continuing in [[Heidelberg]] and graduated M.D. at [[Berlin]] in 1855, with a thesis ''de Pneumothorace''. He then visited Sicily with Professor [[Johannes Peter Müller]] to study zoology.<ref name=power>D'A. Power, "Althaus, Julius (1833–1900)", rev. Caroline Overy, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/430, accessed 16 Feb 2013]</ref> He worked under Professor [[Jean Martin Charcot]] in Paris.<ref name="DNB"/>

Althaus moved to London, where as an assistant to [[Robert Bentley Todd]] he carried out the treatment of patients at [[King's College Hospital]] using electricity. In 1866, he was largely responsible for creating the [[Hospital for Epilepsy and Paralysis]].<ref name="DNB"/> This facility in [[Regent's Park]] later became the [[Maida Vale Hospital for Nervous Diseases]] and it is now part of [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]]. In 1877, Althaus unsuccessfully tried to rename the disease [[multiple sclerosis]] "Charcot's disease" after the disease's first descriptor, [[Jean-Martin Charcot]]. He gave two lectures on spinal cord sclerosis in 1884 and noted that the meaning of the term "sclerosis" varied from country to country.<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=T.

Althaus was the physician at the ''Hospital for Epilepsy and Paralysis'' until 1894, when he was appointed to the honorary office of consulting physician.<ref name=tap>{{cite journal |author=Lancet |journal=The American practitioner and news |page=159 |year=1900 |volume=29-30}}</ref> Althaus married Anna Wilhelmina Pelzer in June 1859, and had two sons and a daughter, of whom the latter survived him.<ref name=power/> He was admitted a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] of London in 1860.<ref name="DNB"/> At the time of his death he was a corresponding fellow of the [[New York Academy of Medicine]], and he was awarded the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]]. He died in London on 11 June 1900 as the result of damaging his knee in Switzerland on holiday the year before which was complicated by gout,<ref name=tap/> followed by [[gastroenteritis]] and [[peritonitis]].<ref name="Obituary"/>

Althaus and his wife were the centre of a social circle and they were both musically talented. Althaus has been called a ''cultural polymath'' and he was a talented linguist which allowed him to understand the latest developments in neurology on an international basis.<ref name=bladin>{{cite journal |last=Bladin |first=PF |title=Julius Althaus (1833--1900).
