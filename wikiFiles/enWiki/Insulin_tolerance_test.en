An '''insulin tolerance test''' ('''ITT''') is a medical diagnostic procedure during which [[insulin]] is injected into a patient's vein to assess [[pituitary]] function, [[adrenal]] function, and sometimes for other purposes. An ITT is usually ordered and interpreted by [[endocrinologist]]s. 

Insulin injections are intended to induce [[hypoglycemia]]. In response, [[ACTH|Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and [[Growth Hormone]] (GH) are released as a part of the stress mechanism. [[ACTH]] elevation causes the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[cortisol]]. Normally, both cortisol and GH serve as [[Counterregulatory hormone]]s, opposing the action of insulin, i.e. acting against the hypoglycemia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Greenwood FC, Landon J, Stamp TCB |title=The plasma sugar, free fatty acid, cortisol, and growth hormone response to insulin. I. In control subjects |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=45 |pages=429– |year=1965 |doi=10.1172/JCI105357 |pmid=5937021 |issue=4 |pmc=292717 }}</ref>   

Thus ITT is considered to be a [[gold standard (test)|Gold standard]] for assessing the integrity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sometimes ITT is performed to assess the peak adrenal capacity, e.g. before [[surgery]]. It is assumed that the ability to respond to insulin induced hypoglycemia translates into appropriate cortisol rise in the stressful event of acute illness or major surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Plumpton FS, Besser GM. |title=The adrenocortical response to surgery and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in corticosteroid-treated and normal subjects |journal=Br J Surg |volume=56 |pages=216–219 |year=1969 |doi=10.1002/bjs.1800560315 |pmid=5776687 |issue=3 }}</ref>

This test is potentially very dangerous and must be undertaken with great care. '''A health professional must attend it at all times.'''

==Side Effects==
Side effects include sweating, palpitations, loss of consciousness and rarely convulsions due to severe hypoglycemia which may cause coma. If extreme symptoms are present, glucose should be given [[intravenous]]ly. In subjects with no adrenal reserve an [[Addisonian crisis]] may occur.  For cortisol stimulation, the [[ACTH stimulation test]] has much less risk

==Contraindications==
* This test should not be performed on children outside a specialist [[pediatric]] endocrine unit
* [[Ischemic heart disease]]
* [[Epilepsy]]
* Severe [[panhypopituitarism]], [[hypoadrenalism]]
* [[Hypothyroidism]] impairs the GH and cortisol response. Patients should have corticosteroid replacement commenced prior to thyroxine as the latter has been reported to precipitate an Addisonian crisis with dual deficiency. If adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, the need for a repeat ITT may need to be reconsidered after 3 months thyroxine therapy.

==Interpretation==

The test cannot be interpreted unless hypoglycaemia (< 2.2&nbsp;mmol/L (or) < 40&nbsp;mg/dl) is achieved.

===Hypopituitarism===
An adequate cortisol response is defined as a rise to greater than 550 nmol/L. Patients with impaired cortisol responses (less than 550 but greater than 400 nmol/L) may only need steroid cover for major illnesses or stresses. An adequate GH response occurs with an absolute response exceeding 20 mU/L.

===Cushing's syndrome===
There will be a rise of less than 170 nmol/L above the fluctuations of basal levels of cortisol.
