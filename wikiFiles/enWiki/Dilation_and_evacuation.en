'''Dilation and evacuation''' (also sometimes called '''dilation and extraction''') literally refers to the dilation of the [[cervix]] and surgical evacuation of the contents of the [[uterus]]. It is a  method of [[abortion]] as well as a therapeutic procedure used after [[miscarriage]] to prevent infection by ensuring that the uterus is fully evacuated.<ref name="ebsco">{{cite web | title = Miscarriage | work = EBSCO Publishing Health Library | publisher = Brigham and Women's Hospital | month = January | year = 2007 | url = http://healthgate.partners.org/browsing/browseContent.asp?fileName=11672.xml&title=Miscarriage | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}</ref><ref name="webmd">{{cite web | title = Dilation and evacuation (D&E) for abortion | work = Healthwise | publisher = WebMD | date = 2004-10-07 | url = http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/Dilation-and-evacuation-DE-for-abortion | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}</ref>

In various health care centers it may be called by different names:
* D&E (Dilation and evacuation)
* ERPOC (Evacuation of Retained [[Products of Conception]])
* TOP or STOP ((Surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy)

D&E normally refers to a specific second trimester procedure.<ref name="webmd" /> However, some sources use the term D&E to refer more generally to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and evacuation, which includes the first trimester procedures of manual and electric [[vacuum aspiration]].<ref name="ebsco" />

==Usage==
Approximately 11% of induced abortions are performed in the second trimester. In 2002, there were an estimated 142,000 second-trimester abortions in the United States.<ref>Guttmacher Institute: [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html "Facts On Induced Abortion in the United States"], May 2006. Accessed May 2006.</ref> The second trimester of pregnancy begins at 13 weeks gestation. For first-trimester and early second-trimester abortions, the pregnancy may be ended by [[vacuum aspiration]] alone. Sometime in the second trimester, however, it becomes necessary to use instruments to help remove the fetus. This instrumental procedure is normally what is meant when the term ''dilation and evacuation'' is used.

==Description==
The first step in a D&E is to [[Cervical dilation|dilate]] the [[cervix]].  This is often begun about a day before the surgical procedure, and often involves the insertion of multiple [[laminaria]] sticks into the cervix. Enlarging the opening of the cervix enables surgical instruments such as a [[curette]] or [[forceps]] to be inserted into the [[uterus]].<ref name="webmd" />

The second step is to remove the [[fetus]].  Either a [[Local anesthesia|local anesthetic]] or [[general anesthesia]] is given to the woman. A [[cannula]] is passed into the uterus. The cannula is attached by tubing to a bottle and a pump that provides a vacuum to remove tissue from the uterus. [[Forceps]] are inserted into the uterus through the vagina and used to extract any remaining tissue. This is more likely in pregnancies of 16 weeks or more. A [[curette]] is used to scrape the lining of the uterus and remove tissue in the uterus. Lastly, the vacuum is used to ensure no fetal tissue remains in the uterus (such tissue can cause serious infections in the woman).  The pieces are also examined to ensure that the entire fetus was removed.<ref name="webmd" />

===Variations===
[[Feticide]] may be performed prior to the surgical procedure via an injection to stop the heartbeat.  The tissues of the dead fetus will soften, making dismemberment easier.  The standard D&E procedure is difficult after 20 weeks [[gestational age]] due to the toughness of the fetal tissues.<ref name="presentation">{{cite conference | first = Martin | last = Haskell | title = Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion | booktitle = National Abortion Federation Risk Management Seminar | date = 1992-09-13 | location = Dallas, Texas | url = http://www.vanderbilt.edu/SFL/partial-birth_abortion.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-05 }}</ref>

If the fetus is removed intact, the procedure is referred to as [[intact dilation and extraction]] by the [[American Medical Association]],<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/apps/pf_new/pf_online?f_n=resultLink&doc=policyfiles/HnE/H-5.982.HTM&s_t=abortion&catg=AMA/HnE&&nth=1&&st_p=0&nth=2& Health and Ethics Policies of the AMA] ''American Medical Association''. H-5.982 Retrieved April 24, 2007.</ref> and referred to as "intact dilation and evacuation" by the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG).<ref>[http://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/press_releases/nr04-18-07.cfm ACOG Statement on the US Supreme Court Decision Upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003] (April 18, 2007).  Retrieved 2007-04-22.</ref> When this intact evacuation is done with a live fetus which dies midway through, it has also been termed a [[partial birth abortion]].
