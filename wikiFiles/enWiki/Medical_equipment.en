'''Medical equipment''' (also known as '''armamentarium''') is designed to aid in the [[diagnosis]], monitoring or treatment of [[medical condition]]s.

==Types==
There are several basic types:
* [[medical diagnosis|Diagnostic]] equipment includes [[medical imaging]] machines, used to aid in diagnosis. Examples are [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] and [[MRI]] machines, [[positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[computed tomography|CT]] scanners, and [[x-ray machine]]s.
* Therapeutic equipment includes [[infusion pump]]s, medical [[laser]]s and [[LASIK]] surgical machines.
* [[Life support]] equipment is used to ''maintain'' a patient's bodily function.  This includes [[medical ventilator]]s, [[anaesthetic machine]]s, [[heart-lung machines]], [[ECMO]], and [[dialysis machine]]s.
* [[Medical monitors]] allow medical staff to measure a patient's medical state. Monitors may measure patient vital signs and other parameters including [[ECG]], [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], [[blood pressure]], and [[blood gas monitor|dissolved gas]]es in the blood.
* Medical laboratory equipment automates or helps analyze [[blood]], [[urine]] and [[gene]]s.
* Diagnostic Medical Equipment may also be used in the home for certain purposes, e.g. for the control of [[diabetes]] mellitus

A [[biomedical equipment technician]] ([[BMET]]) is a vital component of the healthcare delivery system. Employed primarily by hospitals, BMETs are the people responsible for maintaining a facility's medical equipment.
