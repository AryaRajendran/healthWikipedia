'''Spinal cord compression''' develops when the [[spinal cord]] is compressed by bone fragments from a vertebral fracture, a [[tumor]], [[abscess]], ruptured [[intervertebral disc]] or other lesion. It is regarded as a [[medical emergency]] independent of its cause, and requires swift [[diagnosis]] and treatment to prevent long-term disability due to irreversible [[spinal cord injury]].

==Symptoms==
Symptoms suggestive of cord compression are [[back pain]], a [[dermatome]] of increased sensation, [[paralysis]] of limbs below the level of compression, decreased sensation below the level of compression, [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]] and/or [[urinary retention]]. [[Lhermitte's sign]] (intermittent shooting electrical sensation) and [[hyperreflexia]] may be present.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by [[X-ray]]s but preferably [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the whole spine.<ref name="FauciBraunwald2009">{{cite book|author1=Anthony S. Fauci|author2=Eugene Braunwald|author3=Dennis L. Kasper|coauthors=Stephen L. Hauser, Dan L. Longo, J. Larry Jameson, Joseph Loscalzo|title=Harrison's Manual of Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/?id=66XKIuh8P-AC&pg=PA94|accessdate=17 April 2010|date=19 March 2009|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-147743-7|pages=94–}}</ref> The most common causes of cord compression are tumors, but [[abscess]]es and [[granuloma]]s (e.g. in [[tuberculosis]]) are equally capable of producing the syndrome. Tumors that commonly cause cord compression are [[lung cancer]] (non-small cell type), [[breast cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[renal cell carcinoma]], [[thyroid cancer]], [[lymphoma]] and [[multiple myeloma]].

==Treatment and prognosis==
[[Dexamethasone]] (a potent [[glucocorticoid]]) in doses of 16 mg/day may reduce [[edema]] around the lesion and protect the cord from injury. It may be given [[mouth|orally]] or [[intravenous]]ly for this indication.

[[Surgery]] is indicated in localised compression as long as there is some hope of regaining function. It is also occasionally indicated in patients with little hope of regaining function but with uncontrolled pain. Postoperative radiation is delivered within 2-3 weeks of surgical decompression.  Emergency [[radiation therapy]] (usually 20 Gray in 5 fractions, 30 Gray in 10 fractions or 8 Gray in 1 fraction) is the mainstay of treatment for malignant spinal cord compression. It is very effective as pain control and local disease control. Some tumours are highly sensitive to chemotherapy (e.g. lymphomas, small-cell lung cancer) and may be treated with chemotherapy alone.

Once complete paralysis has been present for more than about 24 hours before treatment, the chances of useful recovery are greatly diminished, although slow recovery, sometimes months after radiotherapy, is well recognised.

The median survival of patients with metastatic spinal cord compression is about 12 weeks, reflecting the generally advanced nature of the underlying malignant disease.
