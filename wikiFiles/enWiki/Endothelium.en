The '''endothelium''' is the thin layer of [[cell (biology)|cells]] that lines the interior surface of [[blood vessel]]s and [[lymphatic vessels]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000035470|Endothelium}}</ref> forming an interface between circulating [[blood]] or [[lymph]] in the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] and the rest of the vessel wall. The cells that form the endothelium are called '''endothelial cells'''.  Endothelial cells in direct contact with blood are called vascular endothelial cells, whereas those in direct contact with lymph are known as lymphatic endothelial cells.

Vascular endothelial cells line the entire [[circulatory system]], from the [[heart]] to the smallest [[capillaries]]. These cells have very distinct and unique functions that are paramount to vascular biology. These functions include [[ultrafiltration|fluid filtration]], such as in the [[glomeruli]] of the kidney, [[muscle tone|blood vessel tone]], [[hemostasis]], [[neutrophil]] recruitment, and [[hormone trafficking]]. Endothelium of the interior surfaces of the heart chambers are called [[endocardium]].

== Terminology ==
The foundational model of anatomy makes a distinction between endothelial cells and epithelial cells on the basis of which tissues they develop from, and states that the presence of [[vimentin]] rather than [[keratin]] filaments separate these from epithelial cells.<ref name="urlFMA">{{cite web |url=http://bioportal.bioontology.org/visualize/4513/Endothelial_cell |title=FMA |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref> Many considered the endothelium a specialized [[epithelial]] tissue. 

Both blood and lymphatic capillaries are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells called a monolayer.

== Function ==

Endothelial cells are involved in many aspects of vascular biology, including:
* Barrier function - the endothelium acts as a semi-selective barrier between the vessel lumen and surrounding tissue, controlling the passage of materials and the transit of [[white blood cell]]s into and out of the bloodstream. Excessive or prolonged increases in permeability of the endothelial monolayer, as in cases of chronic inflammation, may lead to tissue [[edema]]/swelling.
* [[Coagulation|Blood clotting]] ([[thrombosis]] & [[fibrinolysis]]). The endothelium normally provides a non-thrombogenic surface because it contains, for example, [[heparan sulfate]] which acts as a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for activating [[antithrombin]], a protease that inactivates several factors in the coagulation cascade.
* [[Inflammation]]
* Formation of new blood vessels ([[angiogenesis]])
* [[Vasoconstriction]] and [[vasodilation]], and hence the control of [[blood pressure]]

In some organs, there are highly differentiated endothelial cells to perform specialized 'filtering' functions. Examples of such unique endothelial structures include the [[glomerulus (kidney)|renal glomerulus]] and the [[blood–brain barrier]].

== Pathology ==
{{Main|Endothelial dysfunction}}
[[Endothelial dysfunction]], or the loss of proper endothelial function, is a hallmark for vascular diseases, and is often regarded as a key early event in the development of [[atherosclerosis]]. Impaired endothelial function, causing hypertension and thrombosis, is often seen in patients with [[coronary artery disease]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], as well as in smokers. Endothelial dysfunction has also been shown to be predictive of future adverse cardiovascular events, and is also present in inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. One of the main mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction is the diminishing of [[nitric oxide]], often due to high levels of [[asymmetric dimethylarginine]], which interfere with the normal [[Arginine|L-arginine]]-stimulated [[Nitric oxide synthase|nitric oxide synthesis]] and so leads to hypertension. The most prevailing mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is an increase in [[reactive oxygen species]], which can impair nitric oxide production and activity via several mechanisms.<ref name="pmid15643116">{{cite journal | author = Deanfield J, Donald A, Ferri C, Giannattasio C, Halcox J, Halligan S, Lerman A, Mancia G, Oliver JJ, Pessina AC, Rizzoni D, Rossi GP, Salvetti A, Schiffrin EL, Taddei S, Webb DJ | title = Endothelial function and dysfunction.
