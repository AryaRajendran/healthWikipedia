{{italic title}}
'''''Taenia solium''''', also called the '''pork tapeworm''', is a [[cyclophyllid]] [[cestode]] in the family [[Taeniidae]]. It infects [[pig]]s and [[human]]s in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[South America]], parts of [[Southern Europe]] and pockets of [[North America]]. In the larval stage, it causes [[cysticercosis]], which is a major cause of seizures in humans. Like all [[cyclophyllid]] [[cestode]]s, ''T. solium'' has four suckers on its [[Cestoda#Scolex|scolex]] ("head"). ''T. solium'' also has two rows of three hooks.

==Description==

''T. solium '', commonly known as tapeworm, is a triploblastic aceolomate. It is normally 2 to 3 m in length, but can become very large, over 50 m long in some situations.

''T. solium'' has a very similar [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] to ''[[Taenia saginata]]''. [[Cysticercoid|Cysticerci]] have three morphologically distinct types.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rabiela|first1=MT|last2= Rivas|first2= A|last3= Flisser|first3= A|year=1989|month=November|title= Morphological types of ''Taenia solium'' cysticerci|journal=Parasitology Today|volume=5|issue=11|pages=357–359|doi=10.1016/0169-4758(89)90111-7|pmid=15463154}}</ref> The common one is the ordinary "[[cellulose]]" [[cysticercoid|cysticercus]], which has a fluid-filled [[bladder]] 0.5&nbsp;cm to 1.5&nbsp;cm in length and an invaginated [[scolex]].  The intermediate form has a scolex, while the "racemose" has no evident [[scolex]] but is believed to be larger and much more dangerous. They are 20&nbsp;cm in length and have 60&nbsp;ml of fluid, and 13% of patients might have all three types in the brain. Humans are usually infected through eating infected pork, fostering adult [[tapeworm]]s in the intestine, and passing eggs through [[feces]], but [[autoinfection]] is also possible. In that case, a cysticercus (a [[larva]] sometimes called a "bladder worm") develops in the human, who acts as an [[intermediate host]]. This happens if eggs get to the [[stomach]], usually as a result of contaminated hands, but also due to [[retroperistalsis]]. [[cysticercoid|Cysticerci]] often occur in the [[central nervous system]], which can cause major neurological problems, such as [[hydrocephalus]], [[paraplegy]], [[meningitis]], [[convulsion]]s and even death. The condition of having cysticerci in one's body is called [[cysticercosis]].

Eggs can be diagnosed only to the [[family (biology)|family]] level, but if a [[proglottid]]'s [[uterus]] is stained with [[India ink]], the number of visible uterine branches can help identify the species; unlike the ''[[Taenia saginata]]'' uteri, ''T. solium'' uteri have only five to 10 uterine branches on each side.

Infection with ''T. solium'' adults is treated with [[niclosamide]], which is one of the most popular drugs for adult tapeworm infections, as well as for [[trematode|fluke]] infections. As cysticercosis is a major risk, it is important to wash one's hands before eating and to suppress vomiting if a patient may be infected with ''T. solium''. If [[neurocysticercosis]] occurs, the drug of choice is either [[albendazole]] or [[praziquantel]]. These drugs damage the parasites' skin internally, causing it to disintegrate and is then removed by the host's [[immune system]].

Infection may be prevented with proper disposal of human feces around pigs, cooking meat thoroughly and/or freezing the meat at −10°C for 5 days. Most cases occur because infected food handlers contaminate the food.

==Life cycle==
[[File:Cysticercosis by Taenia solium PHIL 3387 lores.jpg|thumb|left|Life cycle of ''T. solium'']]
This infection is caused by ingestion of eggs shed in the feces of a human tapeworm carrier. Pigs and humans become infected by ingesting eggs or [[gravid proglottid]]s. Humans are infected either by ingestion of food contaminated with feces containing eggs, or by autoinfection. In the latter case, a human infected with adult ''T. solium'' can ingest eggs produced by that tapeworm, either through fecal contamination or, possibly, from [[proglottid]]s carried into the stomach by reverse [[peristalsis]]. Once eggs are ingested, oncospheres hatch in the intestine, invade the intestinal wall, and migrate to striated muscles, as well as the brain, liver, and other tissues, where they develop into [[cysticercoid|cysticerci]]. In humans, cysts can cause serious [[sequelae]] if they localize in the [[brain]], resulting in [[neurocysticercosis]]. The parasite life cycle is completed, resulting in human tapeworm infection, when humans ingest undercooked pork containing cysticerci. Cysts evaginate and attach to the small intestine by their [[scolex|scolices]]. Adult tapeworms develop, (up to 2 to 7 m in length and produce less than 1000 [[proglottid]]s, each with approximately 50,000 eggs) and reside in the [[small intestine]] for years.

==Pathogenesis==
Ingestion of ''T. solium'' eggs or [[proglottid]] rupture within the host intestine can cause [[larva]]e to migrate into host tissue and cause [[cysticercosis]]. This is the most frequent and severe disease caused by ''T. solium''. In symptomatic cases, a wide spectrum of symptoms may be expressed, including headaches, dizziness and occasional seizures. In more severe cases, dementia or [[hypertension]] can occur due to perturbation of the normal circulation of cerebrospinal fluid. (Any increase in intracranial pressure will result in a corresponding increase in arterial blood pressure, as the body seeks to maintain circulation to the brain.) The severity of cysticercosis depends on location, size and number of parasite larvae in tissues, as well as the host immune response. Other symptoms include sensory deficits, involuntary movements, and brain system dysfunction. In children, [[human eye|ocular]] location of cysts is more common than cystation in other locations of the body. Heavy infection with ''T. solium'' can lead to [[neurocysticercosis]], which can lead to [[epilepsy]], [[seizures]], [[lesions]] in the brain, [[blindness]], [[tumor]]-like growths, and low [[eosinophil]] levels.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Taenia solium.jpg|thumb|150px|''Taenia solium'' adult]]
Diagnosis requires biopsy of the infected tissue and examination of feces. ''T. solium'' eggs and proglottids found in feces diagnoses [[taeniasis]] and not [[cysticercosis]]. Cysticercosis is diagnosed primarily on confirming the presence of hooks on the scolex of ''T. solium''. Radiological tests, such as X-ray, [[CT scan]]s which demonstrate "ring-enhancing brain lesions", and [[MRI]]s, can also be used to detect diseases. X-rays are used to identify calcified larvae in the subcutaneous and muscle tissues, and CT scans and MRIs are used to find lesions in the brain.

==Treatment==
[[Praziquantel]] (PZQ) is the drug of choice for the treatment of ''T. solium'' infection. Some consider [[niclosamide]] to be the drug of choice for all types of tapeworms.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002366/</ref> For cysticercosis,treatment with [[albendazole]] combined with [[steroid]]s reduces the [[inflammation]]. Surgical intervention may be necessary to treat central nervous system lesions. [[Albendazole]] appears to be more effective and a safe drug for neurocysticercosis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa031294 |author=Garcia HH, Pretell EJ, Gilman RH, Martinez SM, Moulton LH, Del Brutto OH, Herrera G, Evans CA, Gonzalez AE, Cysticercosis Working Group in Peru. |title=A trial of antiparasitic treatment to reduce the rate of seizures due to cerebral cysticercosis |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=350 |issue=3 |pages=249–258 |year=2004 |pmid=14724304 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/350/3/249}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000194 |author=Matthaiou DK, Panos G, Adamidi ES, Falagas ME. |title=Albendazole versus Praziquantel in the Treatment of Neurocysticercosis: A Meta-analysis of Comparative Trials |journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=e194 |year=2008 |pmid=18335068 |pmc=2265431 |editor1-last=Carabin |editor1-first=Hélène}}</ref>

==Prevention and control==
The best way to avoid getting tapeworms is to not eat undercooked pork. Moreover, a high level of personal hygiene and prevention of fecal contamination of pig foods also plays a major role in prevention.

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Taenia solium-detailed morphology.jpg|thumb|right|Stained ''T. solium'' proglottid]]
''T. solium'' is found worldwide, but is more common in cosmopolitan areas. Because [[pigs]] are [[intermediate host]]s of the parasite, completion of the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] occurs in regions where humans live in close contact with pigs and eat undercooked pork. Cysticercosis is often seen in areas where poor hygiene allows for contamination of food, soil or water supplies.  Prevalence rates in the [[USA|United States]] have shown immigrants from [[Mexico]], Central and South [[Americas|America]] and [[Southeast Asia]] account for most of the domestic cases of cysticercosis.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Flisser A.|year =1988|month = May|title= Neurocysticercosis in Mexico|journal =Parasitology  Today|volume=4|issue=5|pages= 131–137|pmid=15463066|doi=10.1016/0169-4758(88)90187-1}}</ref> Taeniasis and cysticercosis are very rare in predominantly [[Muslim]] countries, as Islam forbids the consumption of pork. Human cysticercosis is acquired by ingesting ''T. solium'' eggs shed in the [[feces]] of a human tapeworm carrier via gravid proglottids, so can occur in populations that neither eat pork nor share environments with pigs, although the completion of the life cycle can occur only where humans live in close contact with pigs and eat pork.

In 1990 and 1991, four unrelated members of an [[Orthodox Jewish]] community in [[New York City]] developed recurrent seizures and brain lesions, which were found to have been caused by ''T. solium''.  In keeping with their religion, none of the patients ate pork; additionally, none had any history of recent foreign travel.  Several immediate family members of these four patients with seizures were found to have cysticercus antibodies.  The families of the four patients had all employed housekeepers from Latin American countries, and one of the housekeepers tested positive for cysticercus antibodies, leading to the conclusion that the housekeepers were the most likely source of the infections.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=cm5pTOiYEmsC&pg=PA192&lpg=PA192&dq=pork+tapeworm+orthodox+jews#v=onepage&q=pork%20tapeworm%20orthodox%20jews&f=false | title=Outbreak Investigations Around the World: Case Studies in Infectious Disease | author=Dworkin, Mark S. | pages=192–196 | year=2010 | publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers | accessdate=August 9, 2011 | isbn=978-0-7637-5143-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM199209033271004 | journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] | title=Neurocysticercosis in an Orthodox Jewish Community in New York City | author1=Schantz, Peter M. et al. | date=September 3, 1992 | volume=327 | issue=10 | pages=692–695 | accessdate=August 9, 2011 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199209033271004 | last2=Moore | first2=Anne C. | last3=Muñoz | first3=José L. | last4=Hartman | first4=Barry J. | last5=Schaefer | first5=John A. | last6=Aron | first6=Alan M. | last7=Persaud | first7=Deborah | last8=Sarti | first8=Elsa | last9=Wilson | first9=Marianna}}</ref>
