'''Pharmacogenomics''' can be defined as the technology that analyzes how the genetic makeup of an individual affects his/her response to drugs.<ref>Ermak G., Modern Science & Future Medicine (second edition), 164 p., 2013</ref> As the word suggests, it combines the knowledge of [[pharmacology]] and of [[genomics]]. It is the technology that deals with the influence of [[genetics|genetic]] variation on drug response in patients by correlating [[gene expression]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s with a drug's [[efficacy]] or [[toxicity]].<ref name="pmid20836007">{{cite journal | author = Wang L | title = Pharmacogenomics: a systems approach | journal = Wiley Interdiscip Rev Syst Biol Med | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–22 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20836007 | doi = 10.1002/wsbm.42  }}</ref>  By doing so, pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with respect to the patients' [[genotype]], to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]].<ref name="pmid19530963">{{cite journal | author = Becquemont L | title = Pharmacogenomics of adverse drug reactions: practical applications and perspectives | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 961–9 | year = 2009 | month = June | pmid = 19530963 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.09.37  }}</ref>  Such approaches promise the advent of "[[personalized medicine]]"; in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each individual's unique genetic makeup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126957.pdf|format=PDF|title=Guidance for Industry Pharmacogenomic Data Submissions|month=March | year=2005|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref><ref name="pmid20712531">{{cite journal | author = Squassina A, Manchia M, Manolopoulos VG, Artac M, Lappa-Manakou C, Karkabouna S, Mitropoulos K, Del Zompo M, Patrinos GP | title = Realities and expectations of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine: impact of translating genetic knowledge into clinical practice | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1149–67 | year = 2010 | month = August | pmid = 20712531 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.10.97  }}</ref>

== Drug metabolism ==

There are several known genes which are largely responsible for variances in drug metabolism and response.  The most common are the [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) genes, which encode [[enzymes]] that influence the metabolism of more than 80 percent of current prescription drugs.<ref name="pmid18216718">{{cite journal | author = Hart SN, Wang S, Nakamoto K, Wesselman C, Li Y, Zhong XB | title = Genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase influence microsomal P450-catalyzed drug metabolism | journal = Pharmacogenet.

Patient genotypes are usually categorized into predicted phenotypes. For example, if a person receives one *1 allele each from mother and father to code for the CYP2D6 gene, then that person is considered to have an extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype. An extensive metabolizer is considered normal. Other CYP metabolism phenotypes include: intermediate, ultra-rapid, and poor. In theory, each phenotype is based upon the allelic variation within the individual genotype. However, several genetic events can influence a same phenotypic trait, and establishing genotype-to-phenotype relationships can thus be far from consensual with many enzymatic patterns. For instance, the influence of the CYP2D6*1/*4 allelic variant on the clinical outcome in patients treated with Tamoxifen remains debated today. In oncology, genes coding for [[Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency|DPD]], UGT1A1, TPMT, CDA involved in the pharmacokinetics of [[5-FU]]/[[capecitabine]], [[irinotecan]], [[6-mercaptopurine]] and [[gemcitabine]]/[[cytarabine]], respectively, have all been described as being highly polymorphic. A strong body of evidence suggests that patients affected by these genetic polymorphisms will experience severe/lethal toxicities upon drug intake, and that pre-therapeutic screening does help to reduce the risk of treatment-related toxicities through adaptive dosing strategies.<ref name="pmid20818641">{{cite journal | author = Lee SY, McLeod HL | title = Pharmacogenetic tests in cancer chemotherapy: what physicians should know for clinical application. | journal = J Pathol | volume = 223 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–27 | year = 2011 | month = January | pmid = 208186418 | doi = 10.1002/path.2766. | url = }}</ref>

== Applications ==

Pharmacogenomics has applications in illnesses like [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disorders]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[attention deficit disorder]]s, [[HIV]], [[tuberculosis]], [[asthma]], and [[diabetes]].

In [[cancer treatment]], pharmacogenomics tests are used to identify which patients are most likely to respond to certain [[cancer drugs]]. In behavioral health, pharmacogenomic tests provide tools for physicians and care givers to better manage medication selection and side effect amelioration. Pharmacogenomics is also known as companion diagnostics, meaning tests being bundled with drugs. Examples include [[KRAS]] test with [[cetuximab]] and [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]] test with [[gefitinib]]. Beside efficacy, germline pharmacogenetics can help to identify patients likely to undergo severe toxicities when given cytotoxics  showing impaired detoxification in relation with genetic polymorphism, such as canonical 5-FU.<ref name="pmid20920994">{{cite journal | author = Ciccolini J, Gross E, Dahan L, Lacarelle B, Mercier C | title = Routine dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase testing for anticipating 5-fluorouracil-related severe toxicities: hype or hope? | journal = Clin Colorectal Cancer | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 224–8 | year = 2010 | month = October | pmid = 20920994 | doi = 10.3816/CCC.2010.n.033 | url = }}</ref>

In [[cardio vascular disorder]]s, the main concern is response to drugs including [[warfarin]], [[clopidogrel]], [[beta blocker]]s, and [[statin]]s.

Many people take medications called SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for different psychiatric disorders. Many of the medications are metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, including fluoxetine, paroxetine, and citalopram.
