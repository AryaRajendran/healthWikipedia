'''Systemic circulation''' is the part of the [[cardiovascular system]] which carries [[oxygen]]ated [[blood]] away from the heart to the [[body]], and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart. This physiologic theory of [[circulation]] was first described  by [[Amato Lusitano]] (João Rodrigues from Castelo Branco, 1511-1568), a Portuguese doctor working in Italy, in his work  composed by seven volumes ''[http://books.google.com/books/about/Amati_Lusitani_Curationum_medicinalium_c.html?id=RH06MwEACAAJ Curationum Medicinalium Centuriæ Septem]'' 1st. edition in 1551. He was the first to describe venous valves.<ref>[http://www.cryptojews.com/Amatus%20Lusitanus.htm Amatus Lusitanus discovered valves in veins and arteries; by David Hashavit], citation: "There's a reasonable basis to assume that it was Dr. Amatus who first discovered the "Blood circulation" phenomena" </ref>  In 1628 [[William Harvey]] launches his [[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|De motu cordis]].<ref>Harvey, W., Exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis in animalibus, Frankfurt, W.

This term is opposed and contrasted to the term [[pulmonary circulation]] first proposed by [[Ibn al-Nafis]].<ref>{{cite book

==Course==
Systemic circulation refers to the part of the circulatory system in which the blood leaves the heart, services the body's cells,  and then re-enters the heart. Blood leaves through the left ventricle to the aorta, the body's largest artery. The aorta leads to smaller arteries, arterioles, and finally capillaries. Waste and carbon dioxide diffuse out of the cell into the blood, and oxygen in the blood diffuses into the cell. Blood then moves to venious capillaries, and then the venae cavae: the [[lower]] inferior vena cava and the [[upper]] superior vena cava, through which the blood re-enters the heart at the right atrium.

===Arteries===
{{See also|Arterial tree}}
Oxygenated blood enters the systemic circulation when leaving the [[left ventricle]], through the aortic [[semilunar valve]]. The first part of the systemic circulation is the [[aorta]], a massive and thick-walled artery. The aorta arches and branches into major arteries to the upper body before passing through the diaphragm, where it branches further into arteries which supply the lower parts of the body.

===Capillaries===
Blood passes through the capillaries of the lungs to circulate to the right atrium.

===Veins===
After their passage through body tissues, capillaries merge once again into [[venule]]s, which continue to merge into [[veins]]. The venous system finally coalesces into two major veins: the [[superior vena cava]] (roughly speaking draining the areas above the heart) and the [[inferior vena cava]] (roughly speaking from areas below the heart). These two great vessels empty into the [[right atrium]] of the [[heart]].

===Coronary vessels===
{{Main|Coronary circulation}}
The heart itself is supplied with oxygen and nutrients through a small "loop" of the systemic circulation.

===Portal veins===
The general rule is that arteries from the heart branch out into capillaries, which collect into veins leading back to the heart. '''Portal veins''' are a slight exception to this. In humans the only significant example is the [[hepatic portal vein]] which combines from capillaries around the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]] where the blood absorbs the various products of digestion; rather than leading directly back to the heart, the hepatic portal vein branches into a second capillary system in the [[liver]].

==Advantage==
Because the systemic circulation is powered by the left ventricle (which is very muscular), one advantage of this form of circulation - as opposed to [[open circulation]], or the gill system that fish use to breathe - is that there is simultaneous high-pressure oxygenated blood delivered to all parts of the body (except for the inner epithelial lining of the lungs which receive their oxygen during the exchange of the gases themselves).
