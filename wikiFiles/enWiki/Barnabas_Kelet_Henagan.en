'''Barnabas Kelet Henagan''' (June 7, 1798{{spaced ndash}}January 10, 1855) was a [[physician]] and [[South Carolina]] politician who became the [[List of Governors of South Carolina|58th]] [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] due to the death of [[Patrick Noble]] on April 7, 1840.

==Early life and career==
Henagan was born in [[Marlboro County, South Carolina|Marlboro District]] on June 7, 1798 to Darby and Drusilla Henegan. He was educated at the academies in Marlboro County and he went on to study medicine at the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]] in [[Germany]]. Afterwards he returned to South Carolina to practice medicine as a [[physician]] and he also engaged in planting. In 1826, he became the president of the Brownsville Minerva Academy.

==Political career==
Henagan won election to the [[South Carolina Senate]] in 1834 and was elected by the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] to be the 38th [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina]] in 1838. In the final year of his term, Governor [[Patrick Noble]] died on April 7, 1840 and Henagan assumed the governorship. His term as governor lasted less than a year, but Henagan deplored to the Legislature the poor condition of the [[State school|public schools]] in the state and the [[corruption]] of the electoral process. After leaving office in 1840, Henagan was reelected to the state Senate in 1844 and served as the [[South Carolina Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] from 1846 to 1850.
