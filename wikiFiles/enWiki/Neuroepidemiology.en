'''Neuroepidemiology''' is a branch of [[epidemiology]] involving the study of [[neurological disease]] distribution and determinants of frequency in human populations. The term was first introduced by Dr. Len Kurland, Dr. Milton Alter, and Dr. John Kurtzke in 1967.<ref>Dr V Feigin, personal communication with Dr J Kutrzke</ref> Traditionally, neuroepidemiology has been perceived for a long time as a science of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], [[prevalence]], [[risk factor]]s, [[natural history of disease|natural history]] and [[prognosis]] of neurological disorders. However, this is only one part of neuroepidemiology, called non-experimental neuroepidemiology. The other integral, but commonly forgotten, part of neuroepidemiology is experimental neuroepidemiology, which is research based on [[clinical trial]]s of effectiveness or efficacy of various interventions in neurological disorders.

In 1982, [[Karger Publishers|Karger]] set up a new [[scientific journal|journal]] entitled "Neuroepidemiology".<ref>[http://www.karger.com/ned Neuroepidemiology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This periodical is the only international journal devoted to the study of neurological disease distribution and determinants of frequency in human populations. 

Since the time of its inception in 1982, the scope of "Neuroepidemiology" journal has evolved considerably. At present, the journal publishes manuscripts on ''all aspects of epidemiology'' of neurological disorders, ''including'' clinical trials and [[systematic reviews]].<ref>[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ArtikelNr=113298&Ausgabe=234526&ProduktNr=224263&filename=113298.pdf</ref> Its primary focus is on chronic and acute neurological disorders of major importance to clinical medicine, [[public health]], and [[health care delivery]]. The journal also welcomes manuscripts dealing with [[research methodology|methodological]] issues in neuroepidemiological studies.

== Congresses ==
{{update|date=April 2013}}
To reflect modern achievements in our knowledge in non-experimental and experimental (clinical trials) epidemiology of neurological disorders, the First International Congress of Clinical Neuroepidemiology is planned to be held in 2009. This International Congress, for the first time, will bring together scientists and experts in all major fields of experimental and non-experimental neuroepidemiology. Combining scientific sessions in these two interrelated fields of neuroepidemiology with two corresponding half-day teaching courses and a one year-free on-line subscription to the journal of "Neuroepidemiology" for all registered participants are additional unique features of the Congress. 

The main topics of the Congress that will be addressed during plenary, platform and poster sessions include stroke, TIA, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, traumatic brain injury, peripheral neuropathy, neuromuscular disorders, central nervous system infections and tumours, neurological aspects of aging, neuropsychology and neuropsychiatric disorders. The Congress will feature internationally recognized invited speakers, platform lectures, short oral presentations and poster sessions, and will provide an ideal platform for continuing education in all fields of experimental and non-experimental clinical neuroepidemiology.

To reflect modern achievements in our knowledge in non-experimental and experimental (clinical trials) epidemiology of neurological disorders, the First International Congress of Clinical Neuroepidemiology will be held in Munich, Germany on August 27–30, 2009 (www.neuro2009.com).

==Programs and Training in Neuroepidemiology==
Several institutions in the United States offer formal training and research experience in neuroepidemiology, including: 
*A specialization in neuroepidemiology is offered by the Epidemiology Department at the [[University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health]]<ref>[http://www.epidemiology.pitt.edu/courses_aoc.asp#Neuroepidemiology] University of Pittsburg Graduate School of Public Health Epidemiology Department</ref>  
*The  Neuroepidemiology Training Program offered by the [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health]],<ref>[http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/epidemiology/training-programs/neuro-epidemiology] Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health Neuroepidemiology Training Program</ref> and 
*The University of Maryland Neuroepidemiology Training Program.<ref>[http://medschool.umaryland.edu/AgingTraining/neuroepi.asp University of Maryland School of Medicine Neuroepidmeiology Training Program]</ref>
In addition, the Center for Stroke Research in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation at the University of Illinois College of Medicine offers a [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in neuroepidemiology.<ref>[http://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments___programs/departments/neurology/education_and_training/neuroepidemiology_fellowship/ University of Illinois College of Medicine Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Fellowship in Neuroepidemiology]</ref> Michigan State University also offers a neuroepidemiology fellowship as part of the International Neurologic & Psychiatric Epidemiology Program.<ref>[http://neurology.msu.edu/academics/fellowship_neuroepidemiology.shtml Michigan State University International Neurologic & Psychiatric Epidemiology Program Neuroepidemiology Fellowship]</ref> 

As the field of neuroepidemiology continues to expand, research groups have developed at some of the leading medical research institutes across the United States. Currently active research groups can be found at:
*The [[University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health]]'s e-Brain research group has multiple ongoing research projects.<ref>[http://www.epidemiology.pitt.edu/documents/faculty/rosano/summary_of_projects.pdf University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health e-Brain research group]</ref> Their conceptual model highlights the use of [[neuroimaging]] in their research.<ref>[http://www.epidemiology.pitt.edu/documents/faculty/rosano/overall_research_model_to_pitt_web.pdf conceptual model]</ref>
*Harvard University's School of Public Health. At HSPH the Neuroepidemiology Research Group is actively investigation neurological diseases including [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], among others.<ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/neuroepi/ Harvard University School of Public Health Neuroepidemiology Research Group]</ref> 
*The University of California, San Francisco has developed a Neuropidemiology Research Group through the USCF Department of Neurological Surgery.<ref>[http://neurosurgery.ucsf.edu/index.php/research_btrc_neuroepidemiology.html University of California, San Francisco Neuroepidemiology Research Group]</ref>

Other prominent organizations such as the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and Kaiser Permanente have established research programs in neuroepiemiology.<ref>[http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/epi/aging/index.cfm National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]</ref><ref>[http://www.dor.kaiser.org/external/research/topics/Neuroepidemiology/ Kaiser Permanente]</ref>

The [[American Academy of Neurology]] provides additional information on career paths in neuroepidemiology.<ref>[http://www.aan.com/globals/axon/assets/8317.pdf American Academy of Neurology Career Paths in Neuroepidemiology]</ref>
