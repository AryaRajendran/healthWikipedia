'''Glycated hemoglobin''' or '''glycosylated hemoglobin''' (''hemoglobin A1c, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, A1C'', or ''Hb<sub>1c</sub>''; sometimes also '''HbA1c''') is a form of [[hemoglobin]] that is measured primarily to identify the average [[Blood plasma|plasma]] [[glucose]] [[concentration]] over prolonged periods of time. It is formed in a non-enzymatic [[glycation]] pathway by hemoglobin's exposure to plasma glucose. Normal levels of glucose produce a normal amount of glycated hemoglobin. As the average amount of plasma glucose increases, the fraction of glycated hemoglobin increases in a predictable way. This serves as a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous months prior to the measurement. 

In [[diabetes mellitus]], higher amounts of glycated hemoglobin, indicating poorer control of blood glucose levels, have been associated with cardiovascular disease, [[nephropathy]], and [[retinopathy]]. Monitoring HbA<sub>1c</sub> in type 1 diabetic patients may improve outcomes.<ref name="pmid2215560">{{cite journal |author=Larsen ML, Hørder M, Mogensen EF |title=Effect of long-term monitoring of glycosylated haemoglobin levels in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus |journal=N.

==History==
Hemoglobin A1c was first separated from other forms of hemoglobin by Huisman and Meyering in 1958 using a [[chromatography|chromatographic column]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Huisman TH, Martis EA, Dozy A |title=Chromatography of hemoglobin types on carboxymethylcellulose |journal=J.

The use of hemoglobin A1c for monitoring the degree of control of glucose metabolism in diabetic patients was proposed in 1976 by [[Anthony Cerami]], Ronald Koenig and coworkers.<ref name="pmid934240">{{cite journal |author=Koenig RJ, Peterson CM, Jones RL, Saudek C, Lehrman M, Cerami A |title=Correlation of glucose regulation and hemoglobin AIc in diabetes mellitus |journal=N.

==Principle==

Glycation of proteins is a frequent occurrence, but in the case of hemoglobin, a nonenzymatic reaction occurs between glucose and the N-end of the [[beta chain]]. This forms a [[Schiff base]] which is itself converted to 1-deoxyfructose. This rearrangement is known as [[Amadori rearrangement]].

When blood glucose levels are high, glucose molecules attach to the hemoglobin in [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s. The longer hyperglycemia occurs in blood, the more glucose binds to red blood cell and the higher the glycosylated hemoglobin.

Once a hemoglobin molecule is glycated, it remains that way. A buildup of glycated hemoglobin within the red cell, therefore, reflects the average level of glucose to which the cell has been exposed during its [[red blood cell#Life cycle|life-cycle]]. Measuring glycated hemoglobin assesses the effectiveness of therapy by monitoring long-term serum glucose regulation. The HbA<sub>1c</sub> level is proportional to average blood glucose concentration over the previous four weeks to three months. Some researchers state that the major proportion of its value is weighted toward the most recent 2 to 4 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.med.umich.edu/mdrtc/cores/ChemCore/hemoa1c.htm |title=Hemoglobin A1c Fact Sheet |accessdate=2007-12-26 |work=Michigan Diabetes Research & Training Center }}</ref>

==Measuring A1C==
There are a number of techniques used to measure A1C.

Laboratories use:
* [[High-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC): The HbA1c result is calculated as a ratio to total hemoglobin by using a chromatogram.
* [[Immunoassay]]
* [[Enzymatic]]
* Capillary Electrophoresis

Point of care (e.g., doctor's office) devices use:
* Immunoassay
* Boronate affinity chromatography

In the United States, A1C testing laboratories are certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) to standardise them against the results of the 1993 Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).<ref>[http://www.devicelink.com/ivdt/archive/08/07/009.html Developing Point of care HbA1c tests for Diabetes monitoring], Barry Plant, Originally Published IVDT July/August 2008</ref> There is an additional percentage scale, Mono S, that is in use by Japan and Sweden.<ref name=SDA>[http://www.hba1c.nu/HbA1c_Equalis-en.pdf HbA1c in a new way] By the Swedish Diabetes Association.

===Switch to IFCC units===
The American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have agreed that, in the future, HbA<sub>1c</sub> is to be reported in the International

==Interpretation of results==
{{Very long|date=December 2012}}
Laboratory results may differ depending on the analytical technique, the age of the subject, and biological variation among individuals. Two individuals with the same average [[blood sugar]] can have A1C values that differ by as much as 3 percentage points. Results can be unreliable in many circumstances, such as after blood loss, for example, after surgery, blood transfusions, anemia, or high erythrocyte turnover; in the presence of chronic renal or liver disease; after administration of high-dose vitamin C; or erythropoetin treatment.<ref name="pmid18540046">{{cite journal |author=Nathan DM, Kuenen J, Borg R, Zheng H, Schoenfeld D, Heine RJ |title=Translating the A1C assay into estimated average glucose values. |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=31 |number=8 |pages=1473–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18540046 |doi= 10.2337/dc08-0545|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/31/8/1473.full |issue=8 |pmc=2742903}}</ref> In general, the [[reference range]] (that found in healthy persons), is about 20&ndash;40&nbsp;mmol/mol (4%&ndash;5.9%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin_a1c_test/article.htm |title=Hemoglobin A1c Test |accessdate=2007-12-26 |work=MedicineNet.com }}</ref>

Higher levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub> are found in people with persistently elevated blood sugar, as in [[diabetes mellitus]]. While diabetic patient treatment goals vary, many include a target range of HbA<sub>1c</sub> values. A diabetic person with good glucose control has a HbA<sub>1c</sub> level that is close to or within the reference range. The International Diabetes Federation and American College of Endocrinology recommend HbA<sub>1c</sub> values below 48&nbsp;mmol/mol (6.5%), while [[American Diabetes Association]] recommends that the HbA<sub>1c</sub> be below 53&nbsp;mmol/mol (7.0%) for most patients.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Executive Summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes&mdash;2009|journal=Diabetes Care|volume=32|pages=S6&ndash;S12|year=2009|doi=10.2337/dc09-S006}}</ref> Recent results from large trials suggest that a target below 53&nbsp;mmol/mol (7%) may be excessive: Below 53&nbsp;mmol/mol (7%) the health benefits of reduced A1C become smaller, and the intensive glycemic control required to reach this level leads to an increased rate of dangerous hypoglycemic episodes.<ref>{{cite journal

A retrospective study of 47,970 diabetes patients found that patients with an A1C more than 48&nbsp;mmol/mol (6.5%) had an increased mortality rate,<ref>{{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61969-3}}</ref> but a later international study contradicted these findings.<ref>http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/Blog/Tara-Dairman/advance_study_contradicts_accord_findings/</ref><ref>http://www.advance-trial.com/static/html/virtual/contents.asp?P=41</ref>

Practitioners must consider an individual patient's health, his/her risk of hypoglycemia, and his/her specific health risks when setting a target A1C level. For example, patients at high risk of microvascular complications may gain further benefits from reducing A1C below 53&nbsp;mmol/mol (7%). Because patients are responsible for averting or responding to their own hypoglycemic episodes, the patient's input and the doctor's 
assessment of the patient's self-care skills are also important. 

Persistent elevations in blood sugar (and, therefore, HbA<sub>1c</sub>) increase the risk for the long-term vascular complications of diabetes such as coronary disease, heart attack, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, blindness, erectile dysfunction, neuropathy (loss of sensation, especially in the feet), gangrene, and [[gastroparesis]] (slowed emptying of the stomach). Poor blood glucose control also increases the risk of short-term complications of surgery such as poor wound healing. 

Lower-than-expected levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub> can be seen in people with shortened red blood cell lifespan, such as with [[G6PD|glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], [[sickle-cell disease]], or any other condition causing premature red blood cell death. Blood donation will result in rapid replacement of lost RBCs with newly formed red blood cells.  Since these new RBCs will have only existed for a short period of time, their presence will lead HbA1c to underestimate the actual average levels.  There may also be distortions resulting from blood donation which occurred as long as two months before due to an abnormal synchronization of the age of the RBCs, resulting in an older than normal average blood cell life (resulting in an overestimate of actual average blood glucose levels). Conversely, higher-than-expected levels can be seen in people with a longer red blood cell lifespan, such as with [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] or [[folate]] deficiency.<ref name="Kilpatrick 2009">{{cite journal|journal=BMJ|year=2009|volume=339|pages=b4432|pmid=19903702|

The 2010 [[American Diabetes Association]] Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes added the A1c ≥ 48&nbsp;mmol/mol (≥6.5%) as another criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes.<ref name="care.diabetesjournals.org">{{cite journal |author= |title=Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes—2010 |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=33 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=S4–10 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20042774 |pmc=2797389 |doi=10.2337/dc10-S004 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/Supplement_1/S4.extract}}</ref>

==Indications and use==
Glycated hemoglobin testing is recommended for both (a) checking the blood sugar control in people who might be pre-diabetic and (b) monitoring blood sugar control in patients with more elevated levels, termed diabetes mellitus. There is a significant proportion of people who are unaware of their elevated HbA<sub>1c</sub> level before they have blood lab work.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Walid MS, Newman BF, Yelverton JC, Nutter JP, Ajjan M, Robinson JS Jr|title=Prevalence of previously unknown elevation of glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) in spine surgery patients and impact on length of stay and total cost|journal=J Hosp Med|volume=5|issue=1|pages=NA|year=2009|pmid=19753643|doi=10.1002/jhm.541}}</ref>  For a single blood sample, it provides far more revealing information on glycemic behavior than a fasting blood sugar value. However, fasting blood sugar tests are crucial in making treatment decisions. The American Diabetes Association guidelines are similar to others in advising that the glycated hemoglobin test be performed at least two times a year in patients with diabetes that are meeting treatment goals (and that have stable glycemic control) and quarterly in patients with diabetes whose therapy has changed or that are not meeting glycemic goals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=American Diabetes Association|title=Standards of medical care in diabetes--2007 |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=30 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S4–S41 |year=2007 |pmid=17192377 |doi=10.2337/dc07-S004}}</ref> 

Glycated hemoglobin measurement is not appropriate where there has been a change in diet or treatment within 6 weeks. Likewise, the test assumes a normal red blood cell aging process and mix of hemoglobin subtypes (predominantly HbA in normal adults). Hence, people with recent blood loss, [[hemolytic anemia]], or genetic differences in the hemoglobin molecule ([[hemoglobinopathy]]) such as [[sickle-cell disease]] and other conditions, as well as those that have donated blood recently, are not suitable for this test.
  
Due to glycated hemoglobin's variability (as shown in the table above), additional measures should be checked in patients at or near recommended goals.  People with hemoglobin A1C values at 64&nbsp;mmol/mol (8.0%) or less should be provided additional testing to determine whether the HbA<sub>1c</sub> values are due to averaging out high blood glucose ([[hyperglycemia]]) with low blood glucose ([[hypoglycemia]]) or the HbA<sub>1c</sub> is more reflective of an elevated blood glucose that does not vary much throughout the day.  Devices such as continuous [[blood glucose monitoring]] allow people with diabetes to determine their blood glucose levels on a continuous basis, testing every few minutes. Continuous use of blood glucose monitors is becoming more common, and the devices are covered by many health insurance plans but not by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]  in the United States. The supplies tend to be expensive, since the sensors must be changed at least weekly.  Another test that is useful in determining if HbA<sub>1c</sub> values are due to wide variations of blood glucose throughout the day is [[1,5 Anhydroglucitol]], also known as [[GlycoMark]].  GlycoMark reflects only the times that the person experiences [[hyperglycemia]] above 180&nbsp;mg/dL over a two-week period. 

Concentrations of hemoglobin A1 (HbA1) are increased, both in diabetic patients and in patients with renal failure, when measured by ion-exchange chromatography.  The thiobarbituric acid method (a chemical method specific for the detection of glycation) shows that patients with renal failure have values for glycated hemoglobin similar to those observed in normal subjects, suggesting that the high values in these patients are a result of binding of something other than glucose to hemoglobin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/30/3/485.pdf |title=Glycated Hemoglobin in Uremic Patients as Measured by Affinity and Ion-Exchange Chromatography  |accessdate=2009-08-31 |work=clinchem.com }}</ref>

In autoimmune hemolytic anemia, concentrations of hemoglobin A1 (HbA1) is undetectable.  Administration of [[prednisolone]] (PSL) will allow the HbA1 to be detected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://repository.oai.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp/yunoca/A02/A020052000103.pdf |title=Undetectable Glycosolated Hemoglobin in Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia |accessdate=2009-08-31 |work=repository.oai.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp }}</ref>  The alternative [[fructosamine]] test may be used in these circumstances and it also reflects an average of blood glucose levels over the preceding 2 to 3 weeks.

All the major institutions like International Expert Committee Report, drawn from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the European Association for the Study of diabetes (EASD), and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), suggests the A1C level of 48&nbsp;mmol/mol (6.5%) as a diagnostic level.<ref>{{cite journal |author=The International Expert Committee|title=International expert committee report on the role of the A1C assay in the diagnosis of diabetes |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=32|issue=7|pages=1327–1334|year=2009|doi=10.2337/dc09-9033 |pmid=19502545 |pmc=2699715}}</ref>  The Committee Report further states that, when A1C testing cannot be done, the fasting and glucose tolerance tests be done. 

Diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy continues to require fasting and glucose tolerance measurements for [[gestational diabetes]], and not the glycated hemoglobin.

==Modification by exercise training==
A meta-analysis of research done to identify the effect of two different kinds of training programs (combined aerobic and eccentric resistance exercise program and aerobic exercise only) on the glycated hemoglobin levels of individuals with T2DM found that the effect of combining resistance exercise with aerobic exercise improved the glucose control more than just the aerobics alone. The average effect of the training programs included reductions of glycated hemoglobin of 9&nbsp;mmol/mol (0.8 percentage points), which was a result similar to that of long-term diet and drug or insulin therapy (which result in a reduction of 6,5 - 9&nbsp;mmol/mol [or 0.6–0.8 points]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marcus RL, Smith S, Morrell G, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of combined aerobic and high-force eccentric resistance exercise with aerobic exercise only for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus |journal=Phys Ther |volume=88 |issue=11 |pages=1345–54 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18801851 |pmc=2579905 |doi=10.2522/ptj.20080124 |url=http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18801851}}</ref>

==Standardization and traceability==
HbA1c is now standardized & traceable to IFCC methods HPLC-CE & HPLC-MS.
A new unit (mmol/mol) is used as part of this standardization.
