'''Clitoroplasty''' is a term for the surgical creation of a [[clitoris]], in [[Trans woman|transsexual and transgender women]] (as part of [[sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]]), or restoration in the case of procedures reversing the damage caused by [[female genital cutting]].

Women and girls with [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia]] may also undergo this to correct clitoral size in accordance to the female anatomy or complications of the condition.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119580794/abstract Clitoroplasty in Intersex: a New Technique] 1998 British Journal of Urology, 1981 original publication</ref>

Altering the clitoris is rarely performed on purely for cosmetic reasons.

==Clitoroplasty in SRS==
As part of reassignment surgery for trans women, there are several ways to create a clitoris out of existing [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The most common method in practice, is to separate the [[Human penis|penile]] [[Glans penis|glans]] from the paired erectile tissues, and reduce in size to simulate that of a [[cissexual|cis-woman's]].

The success rate for the creation of a [[clitoris]] for trans women greatly varies. The most common cause of failure is the [[necrosis]] of the tissue from lack of blood supply. The greatest non-lethal health risk is damage to the ''[[pudendal nerve]]s'', that greatly reduces the chances and intensity of orgasms when severed.

Most transsexual women's bodies readily accept the relocation of glans penile tissue in the area of a [[cissexual]] woman's clitoris. The glans tissue derived clitoris (using simple dissection techniques), is not a perfect emulation of the clitoris of a [[cissexual]] woman because of the difference in colour, shape, and sexual response. Dr [[Suporn Watanyusakul]] uses a modified technique that preserves some erectile tissue to simulate clitoral engorgement and a small amount of [[foreskin]] to act as a [[clitoral hood]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

An alternate technique, involved the use of urethral spongiform as a clitoral mound. This allowed for better simulation of female [[Sexual arousal|sexual response]] at the cost of the clitoris being not as sensate as one derived from the glans penis. [[Urine]] leakage was a notable complication with this technique.<ref>[http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/1992/04000/A_New_Method_for_Clitoroplasty_in_Male_to_Female.15.aspx A New Method for Clitoroplasty in Male-to-Female Sex Reassignment Surgery] by Fang, Rong-Hwang; Chen, Cheng-Feng; Ma, Shiuh (Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, April 1992 - Volume 89 - Issue 4)</ref>

Older genital reassignment techniques made no attempt at the creation of a clitoris at all. The glans of the penis was sutured in the most distal (inner) area of the [[neovagina]] to simulate a [[cervix]]. The late [[Stanley Biber]] preferred this method.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
