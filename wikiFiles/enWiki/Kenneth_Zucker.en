==Career==

Zucker was born in New York.<ref name="wilkinson2001">Wilkinson, Stephanie (2001). [http://www.brainchildmag.com/essays/fall2001_wilkinson.htm Drop the Barbie!] ''Brain, Child''</ref> Zucker received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Southern Illinois University]], his [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] from [[Roosevelt University]], and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[University of Toronto]] in 1982. He holds a [[College of Psychologists of Ontario|C. Psych.]] certification.

Zucker's graduate work in [[developmental psychology]] resulted in his master's thesis on [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[gender identity]] development in children. While in graduate school, Zucker met his future collaborator [[Susan J. Bradley]], a [[child and adolescent psychiatry|child psychiatrist]] on staff at the Child and Adolescent Service (now the Child and Family Studies Centre) at the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (then, the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry), a public mental health centre and a teaching hospital of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine]].

According to his biography, "Zucker's awe of the imposing Clarke Institute edifice inspired him to meet with the then chief of psychology, Dr. Kingsley Ferguson", who told Zucker of Bradley's new working group to assess children and adolescents with [[gender identity]] problems.<ref name="zucker1995">Zucker, Kenneth J. and Susan J. Bradley (1995). ''Gender Identity Disorder and Psychosexual Problems in Children and Adolescents.'' Guilford Press ISBN 0-89862-266-2</ref> Zucker had read [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]]'s 1974 book ''Sexual Identity Conflict in Children and Adults'' and was convinced to join Bradley's group.

==Therapeutic intervention for gender variance==

Since the mid-1970s Zucker has treated about 500 preadolescent gender-variant children to "help these kids be more content in their biological gender" until they are older and can determine their sexual identity.<ref name="brown2006">Brown, Patricia Leigh (December 2, 2006). [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/02/us/02child.html Supporting Boys or Girls When the Line Isn’t Clear]. ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> For children assigned as males at birth, Zucker asks parents to take away their child's "feminine" toys and instruct the child not to play with or draw pictures of girls.<ref name="spiegel2008">Spiegel, Alix (May 7, 2008). [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90247842 Two families grapple with sons' gender preferences]. ''[[All Things Considered]]'', [[National Public Radio]]</ref> Psychologist Darryl Hill describes Zucker's approach to gender-variant children:

<blockquote>Zucker and Bradley believe that [[conversion therapy|reparative treatments]] (encouraging the child to accept their natal sex and associated gender) can be therapeutic for several reasons. They believe that treatment can reduce social ostracism by helping gender non-conforming children mix more readily with same sex peers and prevent long-term psychopathological development (i.e., it is easier to change a child than a society intolerant of gender diversity). Reparative therapy is believed to reduce the chances of adult GID (i.e., transsexualism) which Zucker and Bradley characterize as undesirable.<ref name="hill2006">Hill D.B., Rozanski C., Carfagnini J., Willoughby B. (2006). Gender Identity Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence: A Critical Inquiry.  pp.  7–34. In Karasic D, Drescher J (Eds.) ''Sexual and Gender Diagnoses of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM): A Reevaluation.'' Haworth Press ISBN 0-7890-3214-7</ref></blockquote>

Zucker is at odds with gay and transgender groups, but distances himself from organizations that share this distinction.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Zucker believes that failing to control a child's gender expression at a young age and seek early counseling for transgendered behavior can be considered "some type of emotional neglect." He claims some parents may have been swayed by an activist transsexual agenda and "cement...in more and more" behaviors that may not result from transsexualism. Instead Zucker advises such children work through their hatred of their bodies before being accepted as transsexuals.  

Zucker supports the early intervention of children with ambiguous genitalia to be assigned and reared as female, or more generally as "the gender that carries the best prognosis for good reproductive function, good sexual function, normal-looking external genitalia and physical appearance, and a stable gender identity."  He published results of two patients who were male by birth but suffered ablatio penis and were shortly thereafter reassigned as females.  At age 26 both denied ever feeling the desire to be male.  Both patients reported more masculine behaviors and bisexuality, about which Zucker suspects that gender role and sexual orientation develop mostly before birth while gender identity development begins shortly after birth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=SJ |first=Bradley |coauthors=Oliver GD, Chernick AB, Zucker KJ |title=Experiment of Nurture: Ablatio Penis at 2 Months, Sex Reassignment at 7 Months, and a Psychosexual Follow-up in Young Adulthood |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=e9 |date=July 1998 |pmid=9651461}}</ref>

Zucker says parents set the goals at his clinic. "We recommend that one goal be to help the child feel more secure about his or her actual gender, another to deal with the child's emotional difficulties, and a third to help with problems in the family. It's helpful to have parents set limits on things like cross-dressing, which many parents have not done before coming to us."<ref name="goleman1994">Goleman, Daniel (March 22, 1994). [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E0DA153CF931A15750C0A962958260 The 'Wrong' Sex: A New Definition Of Childhood Pain]. ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> Zucker's follow-up of 50 treated children found that "about 10 percent are still very unhappy about their gender, still cross-dressing, and thinking about having sex reassignment surgery" as young adults.<ref name="goleman1994"/> Zucker has stated that "the therapist must rely on the 'clinical wisdom' that has accumulated and to utilize largely untested case formulation conceptual models to inform treatment approaches and decisions."<ref name="neuropsychiatrie2008">Zucker K.J. (2008). Children with gender identity disorder: Is there a best practice? ''Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence.'' Volume 56, Issue 6, September 2008, Pages 358-364</ref>

Zucker coauthored a statistical report with [[J. Michael Bailey]] that found gays and lesbians exhibited more cross-gender activity as children.<ref name="bailey1995">Bailey J.M., Zucker K.J. (1995). Childhood Sex-Typed Behavior and Sexual Orientation: A Conceptual Analysis and Quantitative Review. ''[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]]'', v31 n1 p. 43–55 Jan 1995</ref>  Bailey claims Zucker considers [[transsexualism]] a "bad outcome" for these children, specifically citing the risks and hassle of sex change operations.<ref name="bailey2003">Bailey, J. Michael (2003). ''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''. Joseph Henry Press, ISBN 978-0-309-08418-5</ref>

For [[adolescent]] clients expressing gender identity disorder, Zucker's treatment protocol resembles that for adult GID, consisting of [[hormone replacement therapy]] to aid the adolescent in a social transition. Since [[sex reassignment surgery]] is not generally performed on minors in North America, Zucker's clinic does not provide recommendations for it – instead, clients are encouraged to pursue reassignment through the adult Gender Identity Clinic at CAMH, which controls funding for the procedure in [[Ontario]].

==Controversy over reparative therapy for transgender children==
As an editor of Archives of Sexual Behavior, Zucker published a controversial study on gay "reparative therapy" by Dr. Robert Spitzer, which the author later disavowed:
<blockquote>Yet, heavily invested after all the work, [Spitzer] turned to a friend and former collaborator, Dr. Kenneth J. Zucker, psychologist in chief at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto and editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior, another influential journal.
“I knew Bob and the quality of his work, and I agreed to publish it,” Dr. Zucker said in an interview last week. The paper did not go through the usual peer-review process, in which unnamed experts critique a manuscript before publication. “But I told him I would do it only if I also published commentaries” of response from other scientists to accompany the study, Dr. Zucker said.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Benedict|title=Psychiatry Giant Sorry for Backing Gay ‘Cure’|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/health/dr-robert-l-spitzer-noted-psychiatrist-apologizes-for-study-on-gay-cure.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 August 2012|date=18|month=May|year=2012}}</ref></blockquote>
