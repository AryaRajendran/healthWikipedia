'''Acute promyelocytic leukemia''' is a subtype of [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML), a [[cancer]] of the [[blood]] and [[bone marrow]]. It is also known as '''acute progranulocytic leukemia'''; '''APL'''; '''AML with t(15;17)(q24;q21)''', '''PML-RARA''' and variants; '''FAB subtype M3'''<ref name="urlAcute Myeloid Leukemia - Signs and Symptoms">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/cancer/leukemia/conditions/aml/signs.html |title=Acute Myeloid Leukemia - Signs and Symptoms |work=}}</ref> and '''M3 variant'''.

In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature [[granulocytes]] called [[promyelocyte]]s.  The disease is characterized by a [[chromosomal translocation]] involving the [[retinoic acid receptor]] alpha (''RARα'' or ''RARA'') gene and is unique from other forms of AML in its responsiveness to [[ATRA|all ''trans'' retinoic acid]] (ATRA) therapy.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957.<ref name="pmid19074116">{{cite journal |author=Tallman MS, Altman JK |title=Curative strategies in acute promyelocytic leukemia |journal=Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program |volume=2008 |issue= |pages=391–9 |year=2008 |pmid=19074116 |doi=10.1182/asheducation-2008.1.391 |url=http://www.asheducationbook.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19074116}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0954-6820.1957.tb00124.x |author=Hillestad, LK |title= Acute promyelocytic leukemia |journal=Acta Med Scand. |volume=159 |issue=3 |pages=189–94 |year=1957 |month=November |pmid=13508085}}</ref>
From 1950s until the elucidation of its developmental mechanisms in the 1970s, APL had a 100% mortality rate as there was no effective treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==
Normal differentiation of the [[white blood cell]]s in the marrow starts with the multi-potent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Several [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] factors such as PU.1 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, alpha (CEBPA) have been identified to be important in the [[white blood cell]] differentiation process.<ref>Pecorino, 2008, 174</ref> The HSC generates the [[lymphoid]] (B cells and T cells of our [[immune system]]) cell line and the myeloid cell lines. The myeloid cell lines have granules in their [[cytoplasm]] called granulocytes which are important in fighting infections.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell</ref>

The accumulation of promyelocytes in the bone marrow results in a reduction in the production of normal [[red blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s, resulting in [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]]. The bone marrow is unable to produce healthy red blood cells. Either [[leukopenia]] (low white cell count) or [[leukocytosis]] (high white cell count) may be observed in the peripheral blood.

Symptoms include:
*Fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath (from [[anemia]], the decrease of normal [[red blood cell]] production or lack thereof)
*Easy bruising and bleeding (from thrombocytopenia and [[coagulopathy]], which prevents blood clotting)
*Fever and infection (from lack of normal white blood cells)
*Minor abdominal discomfort (from enlargement of the spleen)

In addition, in 85% of cases acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated with bleeding caused by [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/583101 |title=Diagnosing Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia |work=Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing |year=2008}}</ref> It is characterized by rapid increase in the number of immature [[white blood cell]]s, resulting in rapid progression of [[malignant]] cell counts and crowding of the bone marrow. This results in very low [[red blood cell]]s ([[anemia]]) and [[platelet]] counts, which can cause serious bleeding.

==Epidemiology==
Acute promyelocytic leukemia represents 5-8% of AML in adults. The median age is approximately 40 years, which is considerably younger than the other subtypes of AML (70 years). Without proper medicine and treatment, APL is fatal. Incidence is higher among patients of Latin American origin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Douer D, Santillana S, Ramezani L, ''et al.'' |title=Acute promyelocytic leukaemia in patients originating in Latin America and is associated with an increased frequency of the bcr1 subtype of the PML/RARalpha fusion gene |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=563–70 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12899711 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04480.x|url=}}</ref>

APL has a high rate of relapse with conventional [[chemotherapy]]{{clarify|date=December 2012}}.<ref>Rambaldi, ''Leukemia'' The Curtis Center, Philadelphia, PA, 2002, p.531</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
[[File:Faggot cell in AML-M3.jpg|thumb|250px|Faggot cell]]
Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the [[retinoic acid receptor-alpha]] gene on [[chromosome 17]] (''RARα'').  In 95% of cases of APL, retinoic acid receptor-alpha (''RARα'') gene on [[chromosome 17]] is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the [[promyelocytic leukemia gene]] (''PML'') on [[chromosome 15]], a translocation denoted as t(15;17)(q22;q21). The RAR receptor is dependent on [[retinoic acid]] for regulation of transcription.<ref>Pecorino, L. 2008, ''Molecular Biology of Cancer: Mechanisms, Targets and Therapeutics.'' p.53.</ref>

Four other gene rearrangements have been described in APL fusing ''RARα'' to [[promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger]] (''PLZF''),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen Z, Brand NJ, ''et al.'' |title=Fusion between a novel Krüppel-like zinc finger gene and the retinoic acid receptor-alpha locus due to a variant t(11;17) translocation associated with acute promyelocytic leukaemia |journal=EMBO J |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=1161–7 |year=1993 |month=March |pmid=8384553 |pmc=413318}}</ref> [[nucleophosmin]] (''NPM''), [[nuclear matrix associated]] (''NUMA''), or [[signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b]] (''STAT5B'') genes. All of these rearrangements are ATRA-sensitive, except for PLZF/RARα, which is resistant to ATRA.

The fusion of PML and RAR creates a hybrid  protein with altered functions. This fusion protein binds with enhanced affinity to sites on the cell's DNA, blocking transcription and differentiation of granulocytes. It does so by enhancing interaction of nuclear co-repressor (NCOR) molecule and histone deacetylase (HDAC).<ref>Rambali,531</ref> Although the chromosomal translocation involving ''RARα'' is believed to be the initiating event, additional mutations are required for the development of leukemia.

One of the most distinguishable traits in APL is the presence of overt coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation) at diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is due to the enhanced fibrinolytic activity due to annexin II overexpression and expression of tissue factor by abnormal promyelocytes.

The hypergranular form of APL features [[faggot cell]]s. This term is applied to these blast cells because of the presence of numerous [[Auer rods]] in the [[cytoplasm]]. The accumulation of these Auer rods gives the appearance of a bundle of sticks, from which the cells derive their name.

==Diagnosis==
Acute promyelocytic leukemia can be distinguished from other types of AML based on morphologic examination of a [[bone marrow aspirate]] or biopsy as well as finding the characteristic rearrangement. Definitive diagnosis requires testing for the ''PML/RARα'' fusion gene. This may be done by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH), or conventional [[cytogenetics]] of peripheral blood or bone marrow. This mutation involves a translocation of the long arm chromosomes of 15 and 17.

RARα is a member of the nuclear family of receptors; its ligand, [[retinoic acid]] is a form of [[Vitamin A]] and acts as a regulator of DNA transcription at multiple sites.<ref>Pecorino, p.53</ref>

Monitoring for relapse using PCR tests for ''PML/RARα transcript'' allows early re-treatment which is successful in many instances.

==Treatment==

===Initial treatment===
APL is unique among myeloid leukemias due to its sensitivity to [[all-trans retinoic acid|all-''trans'' retinoic acid]] (ATRA), a derivative of [[vitamin A]].  Treatment with ATRA dissociates the NCOR-HDACL complex from RAR and allows DNA transcription and differentiation of the immature leukemic promyelocytes into mature granulocytes by targeting the oncogenic transcription factor and its [[aberrant]] action. Unlike other chemotherapies, ATRA does not directly kill the malignant cells.  ATRA induces the terminal differentiation of the leukemic promyelocytes, after which these differentiated malignant cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis on their own.  ATRA is typically combined with [[anthracycline]] based chemotherapy resulting in a clinical remission in approximately 90% of patients.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} ATRA alone is capable of inducing remission but it is short-lived in the absence of anthracycline. After stable remission is induced, the standard of care is to undergo 2 years of consolidation chemotherapy with [[Methotrexate]], Mercaptopurine, and ATRA. Nearly all patients will relapse without consolidation therapy.

ATRA therapy is associated with the unique side effect of [[retinoic acid syndrome]].<ref name="pmid18945746">{{cite journal |author=Breccia M, Latagliata R, Carmosino I, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical and biological features of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients developing retinoic acid syndrome during induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and idarubicin |journal=Haematologica |volume=93 |issue=12 |pages=1918–20 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18945746 |doi=10.3324/haematol.13510 |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18945746}}</ref> This is associated with the development of [[dyspnea]], fever, weight gain, peripheral [[edema]] and is treated with [[dexamethasone]].  The etiology of retinoic acid syndrome has been attributed to capillary leak syndrome from cytokine release from the differentiating promyelocytes.

Since 1992 [[Differentiation therapy]] of APL has undergone further refinements and results from 2007 show that up-front use of ATRA/ATO (arsenic trioxide) plus induction chemotherapy leads to complete remission rates in excess of 93% with these patients achieving 5-year overall survival rates approaching 100%.<ref name=Petrie2009>{{cite journal |url=http://journals.lww.com/co-hematology/Fulltext/2009/03000/Differentiation_therapy_of_acute_myeloid_leukemia_.6.aspx |title=Differentiation therapy of acute myeloid leukemia: past, present and future |date=March 2009 }}</ref>

===For relapsed or refractory disease===
Allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation are the preferred treatment options for relapsed or refractory disease. [[Arsenic trioxide]] (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is currently being evaluated for treatment of relapsed / refractory disease. Remission with arsenic trioxide has been reported.<ref name="pmid9801394">{{cite journal |author=Soignet SL, Maslak P, Wang ZG, ''et al.'' |title=Complete remission after treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with arsenic trioxide |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=339 |issue=19 |pages=1341–8 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9801394 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199811053391901|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=9801394&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref>
Studies have shown arsenic reorganizes [[nuclear bodies]] and degrades the mutant PML-RAR fusion protein.<ref>Soignet,''Complete Remission After Treatment of APL with Arsenic Trioxide'' 1998, 1346</ref> Arsenic also increases caspase activity which then induces [[apoptosis]].<ref>Soignet, 1998, 1347</ref> It does reduce the relapse rate for high risk patients.<ref>[http://www.cancernetwork.com/leukemia/article/10165/61228?pagerNumber=2 Arsenic Compound Improves Survival in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Patients . Sept 2007]</ref>

===2013===
Actue Promyelocytic Leukemia ia a cancer that effects the blood and bone marrow.Through the research that has been done in the last ten years, it has shown that arsenic trioxide treatments are the best and the fastest treatments available for apl patients. Arsenic trioxide has been used for thousands of years to cure and treat illnesses all over the world. After patients undergo arsenic trioxide more often than not they go into complete remission for the rest of thier lives, able to live complete normal lives.
