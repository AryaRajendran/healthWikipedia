'''Leicester Medical School''' is a [[medical school (United Kingdom)|medical school]] in England established in 1975. It is part of the [[University of Leicester]].

==Courses==
The medical school offers five-year and four-year (graduate entry)<ref>for graduates with degrees in [[Health Sciences]]</ref> courses in medicine, awarding its graduates the [[MBChB]] degree. Some students on the five year course choose to take an intercalated BSc Honours Degree, usually between their third and fourth years of study, and which is awarded following either a year of full time research or completing the final year of a standard degree course (e.g. medical genetics, physiology, French). As of 2010 the medical school admits 175 British students per year includes 20 students from overseas.<ref name="statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmedicalschools.com/index.php?pageid=stats|title=www.ukmedicalschools.com UK Medical School Statistics|publisher=ukmedicalschools.com|accessdate=2008-09-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Leicester was ranked 7th in the top 31 medical schools in the 2010 Guardian University Guide and 7th in the Times ranking table.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--Leicester website is not an independent source-->

==History==
The school was formed following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965-68) (which issued its report, popularly known as the "Todd Report" in 1968).  The Commission estimated that by 1994 the UK would need to train more than 4500 doctors a year, and that this would need to be achieved by both increasing the numbers of medical students at existing medical schools, and by establishing a number of new medical schools.  The report recommended that new medical schools should be immediately established at the Universities of [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]], [[University of Southampton|Southampton]] and Leicester. 

In 2000, Leicester Medical School assisted the [[University of Warwick]] in the foundation of the Leicester-Warwick Medical School, combining Leicester's own school with a new institution based in [[Warwick]].  The project was successful, and in 2006, some time after the Warwick school's first students had graduated, the two institutions separated, creating [[Warwick Medical School]], and recreating Leicester Medical School.  Warwick, along with Swansea University, are currently the only medical schools in the UK which restrict entry to graduate students.
