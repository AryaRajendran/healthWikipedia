'''Congenital nephrotic syndrome''' is an [[inherited disorder]] characterized by [[protein]] in the [[urine]] and swelling of the body.

==Causes==
Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a very rare form of [[nephrotic syndrome]]. It occurs predominantly in families of [[Finland|Finnish]] origin and manifests shortly after birth. It is an inherited disorder. The condition is caused by a defect in the protein [[nephrin]], which is found in the [[kidney]].

[[Protein]]s and [[fat]]s are excreted in the urine, and there is an abnormally high fat level in the blood. Swelling occurs due to [[kidney failure]], combined with the loss of blood protein. This is because proteins in the blood normally keep fluids in the [[blood stream]], and when protein level is low, the fluid can leak into the body tissues.

Some of the proteins lost in the urine are [[immune system]] [[antibody|antibodies]] that fight infections. The disorder commonly results in infection, [[malnutrition]], and [[kidney failure]]. It can often lead to death by 5 years of age.

==Symptoms==
* Low birth weight
* Large [[placenta]]
* Swelling (total body)
* Decreased urine output
* Foamy appearance of urine
* Poor appetite
* Cough

==Diagnosis==
An examination reveals massive fluid retention and generalized [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]]. Abnormal sounds are heard when listening to the [[heart]] and lungs with a [[stethoscope]]. [[Blood pressure]] may be high. The patient may have signs of [[malnutrition]].

A [[urinalysis]] reveals large amounts of protein and the presence of fat in the urine. Total protein in the blood may be low. The disorder can be screened for during [[pregnancy]] by finding elevated levels of [[alpha-fetoprotein]] on a routine sampling of [[amniotic fluid]]. Genetic tests should be used to confirm the diagnosis, if the screening test is positive.

CNF is one of the [[Finnish heritage disease]]s.  By use of positional cloning strategies, Kestila et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kestilä M, Männikkö M, Holmberg C, Tryggvason K, Peltonen L |title=Congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type is not associated with the Pax-2 gene despite the promising transgenic animal model |journal=Genomics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=570–2 |year=1994 |month=February |pmid=8188301 |doi=10.1006/geno.1994.1109 |url=}}</ref> isolated the gene responsible for NPHS1. Mutations in Finnish patients with NPHS1 were found in this gene, which they termed nephrin. The most common Finnish mutation was a deletion of 2 nucleotides in exon 2 (602716.0001), resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein. The predicted nephrin protein belongs to the immunoglobulin family of cell adhesion molecules and is specifically expressed in renal glomeruli.  It was also observed that, in most cases, alleles typically found on CNF chromosomes of Finnish families were also found on CNF chromosomes of non-Finnish families from North America and Europe.<ref>{{OMIM|256300|NEPHROSIS 1, CONGENITAL, FINNISH TYPE; NPHS1}}</ref>

Frequent [[infection]]s may occur over the course of the disease.

==Treatment==
Early and aggressive treatment is required to control the disorder. [[Diuretic]] medications help rid the body of excess fluid. [[ACE inhibitor]] medications (like [[Captopril]] and others) and non-steroidal [[anti-inflammatory drug]]s (like [[indomethacin]]) are used to slow the spilling of [[protein]] in the urine. Antibiotics may be needed to control infections.

Dietary modifications may include the restriction of [[sodium]] and use of [[dietary supplement]]s as appropriate for the nature and extent of [[malnutrition]]. Fluids may be restricted to help control swelling.

Removal of the [[kidney]]s, [[dialysis]], and [[kidney transplant]] may be recommended.

==Prognosis==
Many cases are fatal within the first year. Congenital nephrotic syndrome may be successfully controlled in some cases with early and aggressive treatment, including early [[kidney transplant]]ation.

==Complications==
* Frequent, severe infections
* [[Malnutrition]] and related diseases
* [[Blood clot]]s
* Acute kidney failure
* Chronic kidney failure
* End-stage [[kidney disease]]
