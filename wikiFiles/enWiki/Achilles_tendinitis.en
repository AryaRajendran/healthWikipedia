'''Achilles tendonitis''' (also '''Achilles tenosynovitis''' or '''Achilles tendinopathy''') is [[tendonitis]] of the [[Achilles tendon]], generally caused by overuse of the affected limb and is more common among athletes training under less than ideal conditions. It should not be confused with [[xanthoma]] of the [[tendon]], which is the accumulation of [[cholesterol]] in patients with [[familial hypercholesterolemia]].

==Pathophysiology==
The Achilles tendon does not have good blood supply or cell activity, so this injury can be slow to heal. The tendon receives nutrients from the tendon sheath or paratendon. When an injury occurs to the tendon, cells from surrounding structures migrate into the tendon to assist in repair. Some of these cells come from blood vessels that enter the tendon to provide direct blood flow to increase healing. With the blood vessels come nerve fibers. Researchers including Alfredson and his team in Sweden <ref name="Alfredson-2003">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Alfredson | first1 = H. | last2 = Ohberg | first2 = L. | last3 = Forsgren | first3 = S. | title = Is vasculo-neural ingrowth the cause of pain in chronic Achilles tendinosis?

==Treatment==
Treatment is possible with [[ice]], [[cold compression therapy]], wearing heel pads to reduce the strain on the tendon, and an exercise routine designed to strengthen the tendon (see eccentric strengthening, below). Some people have reported vast improvement after applying light to medium compression around ankles and lower calf by wearing elastic bandages throughout the day. Using these elastic bandages while sleeping can reduce morning stiffness but care must be taken to apply very light compression during sleep. Compression can inhibit healing by hindering circulation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Christopoulos DG, Nicolaides AN, Szendro G, Irvine AT, Bull M, Eastcott HHG |title=Air-plethysmography and the effect of elastic compression on venous hemodynamics of the leg. |journal=J Vasc Surg |volume= 5|issue= 1|pages= 148–59|year=1987 |doi= |pmid=3795381}}</ref> Seeing a professional for treatment as soon as possible is important, because this injury can lead to an [[Achilles tendon rupture]] with continued overuse. Other treatments may include [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, such as ibuprofen, ultrasound therapy, [[manual therapy]] techniques, a [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] program, and in rare cases, application of a [[Orthopedic cast|plaster cast]]. [[Steroid]] injection is sometimes used, but must be done after very careful, expert consideration because it can increase the risk of tendon rupture.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.emedicinehealth.com/achilles_tendon_rupture/article_em.htm#Achilles%20Tendon%20Rupture%20Causes |title=Achilles Tendon Rupture |first= |last=Christopher C Nannini, MD |work=emedicinehealth.com |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref> There have recently been some interest in the use of autologous blood injections, however the results have not been highly encouraging and there is little evidence for its use.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jbjs.org/article.aspx?articleid=35811 |title=JBJS &#124; Limited Evidence Supports the Effectiveness of Autologous Blood Injections for Chronic Tendinopathies |work=jbjs.org |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/content/95/1/63.full |title=Autologous growth factor injections in chronic tendinopathy: a systematic review |first= |last=    R.

More specialised therapies include prolotherapy (sclerosant injection into the neovascularity) and extracorporeal shockwave therapy may have some additional benefit.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maffulli|first=N|coauthors=Longo, UG, Denaro, V|title=Novel approaches for the management of tendinopathy.|journal=The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

==Prevention==
Prevention of recurrence includes following appropriate exercise habits and wearing low-heeled shoes. Preventive exercises are aimed at strengthening the [[gastrocnemius]] and [[soleus]] muscles, typically by eccentric strengthening exercises.<ref>G T Allison, C Purdam. Eccentric loading for Achilles tendinopathy — strengthening or stretching? Br J Sports Med 2009;43:276-279</ref> These involve repetitions of slowly raising and lowering the body while standing on the affected leg, using the opposite arm to assist balance and support if necessary, and starting with the heel in a hyperextended position. (Hyperextension is typically achieved by balancing the forefoot on the edge of a step, a thick book, or a barbell weight. so that the point of the heel is a couple of inches below the forefoot.) A [[physical therapist]] or [[athletic trainer]] can prescribe safe exercise methods.
