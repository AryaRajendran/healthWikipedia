'''Adrenocortical carcinoma''', also '''adrenal cortical carcinoma''' (ACC) and '''adrenal cortex cancer''', is an aggressive [[cancer]] originating in the [[Adrenal cortex|cortex]] ([[steroid hormone]]-producing tissue) of the [[adrenal gland]]. Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare tumor, with incidence of 1-2 per million population annually.<ref name="DeVita">{{cite book |author=edited by Vincent T. DeVita, Samuel Hellman, Steven A.

Adrenocortical carcinoma has often invaded nearby tissues or [[metastasis|metastasized]] to distant organs at the time of diagnosis, and the overall 5-year survival rate is only 20-35%.<ref name="DeVita"/>

== Signs and Symptoms ==
Adrenocortical carcinoma may present differently in children and adults. Most tumors in children are functional, and [[virilization]] is by far the most common presenting symptom, followed by [[Cushing's syndrome]] and [[precocious puberty]].<ref name="DeVita"/> Among adults presenting with hormonal syndromes, Cushing's syndrome alone is most common, followed by mixed Cushing's and virilization ([[glucocorticoid]] and [[androgen]] overproduction). [[Feminization]] and [[Conn syndrome]] ([[mineralocorticoid]] excess) occur in less than 10% of cases. Rarely, [[pheochromocytoma]]-like hypersecretion of [[catecholamine]]s has been reported in adrenocortical cancers.<ref name="Weidner's">{{cite book |author=Richard Cote, Saul Suster, Lawrence Weiss, Noel Weidner (Editor) |title=Modern Surgical Pathology (2 Volume Set) |publisher=W B Saunders |location=London |year= 2002|pages= |isbn=0-7216-7253-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> Non-functional tumors (about 40%, authorities vary) usually present with abdominal or flank pain, or they may be asymptomatic and detected incidentally.<ref name="UTDACC"/>

All patients with suspected adrenocortical carcinoma should be carefully evaluated for signs and symptoms of hormonal syndromes. For Cushing's syndrome ([[glucocorticoid]] excess) these include [[weight gain]], [[muscle wasting]], purple lines on the abdomen, a fatty "[[Lipodystrophy|buffalo hump]]" on the neck, a [[moon face|"moonlike" face]], and thinning,fragile skin. Virilism ([[androgen]] excess) is most obvious in women, and may produce [[hirsutism|excess facial and body hair]], [[acne]], enlargement of the [[clitoris]], deepening of the voice, coarsening of facial features, [[amenorrhea|cessation of menstruation]]. [[Conn syndrome]] ([[mineralcorticoid]] excess) is marked by [[high blood pressure]] which can result in [[headache]] and [[hypokalemia]] (low serum potassium, which can in turn produce muscle weakness, confusion, and [[palpitations]]) low plasma [[renin]] activity, and high serum [[aldosterone]]. [[Feminization]] ([[estrogen]] excess) is most readily noted in men, and includes [[gynecomastia|breast enlargement]], decreased [[libido]] and [[impotence]].<ref name="DeVita"/><ref name="UTDACC"/><ref>Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL.

==Pathobiology==
The main etiologic factor of adrenocortical cancer is unknown. Families with [[Li-Fraumeni syndrome]] have increased risk. The [[p53]], [[retinoblastoma protein]] (RB) [[tumor suppressor gene]]s located on chromosomes 17p, 13q respectively,  may be changed. The genes h19, insulin-like growth factor II ([[IGF-II]]), p57<sup>kip2</sup> are important for fetal growth and development. They are located on chromosome 11p. Expression of the h19 gene is markedly reduced in both nonfunctioning and functioning adrenal cortical carcinomas, especially in tumors producing [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]]. There is also a loss of activity of the p57<small>kip2</small> gene product in [[virilizing]] adenomas and adrenal cortical carcinomas. In contrast, IGF-II gene expression has been shown to be high in adrenal cortical carcinomas. Finally, c-myc gene expression is relatively high in neoplasms, and it is often linked to poor prognosis.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kufe D |editor=Benedict RC, Holland JF |title=Cancer medicine |publisher=B.C. Decker |location=Hamilton, Ont |year=2000 |edition=5th |isbn=1-55009-113-1 |oclc=156944448 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
===Laboratory findings===
Hormonal syndromes should be confirmed with laboratory testing. Laboratory findings in Cushing syndrome include increased [[serum glucose]] (blood sugar) and increased urine [[cortisol]]. Adrenal virilism is confirmed by the finding of an excess of serum [[androstenedione]] and [[dehydroepiandrosterone]]. Findings in [[Conn syndrome]] include [[hypokalemia|low serum potassium]], low plasma [[renin]] activity, and high serum [[aldosterone]]. Feminization is confirmed with the finding of excess serum [[estrogen]]

===Radiology===
Radiological studies of the [[abdomen]], such as [[CT scan]]s and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] are useful for identifying the site of the tumor, differentiating it from other diseases, such as [[adrenocortical adenoma]], and determining the extent of invasion of the tumor into surrounding organs and tissues. CT scans of the [[chest]] and [[bone scan]]s are routinely performed to look for [[metastasis|metastases]] to the [[lung]]s and [[bone]]s respectively. These studies are critical in determining whether or not the tumor can be [[surgery|surgically]] removed, the only potential [[cure]] at this time.<ref name="UTDACC"/>

===Pathology===
[[Image:Adrenal cortical carcinoma.JPG|thumb|right|[[gross pathology|Gross]] of a large adrenal cortical carcinoma.]]
[[File:Adrenal cortical carcinoma.jpg|thumb|Cell block preparation from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a large ACC shows tumor cells with compact, eosinophilic cytoplasm and a mild degree of nuclear pleomorphism.]]
Adrenal tumors are often not biopsied prior to surgery, so diagnosis is confirmed on examination of the surgical specimen by a [[anatomical pathology|pathologist]]. Grossly, adrenocortical carcinomas are often large, with a tan-yellow cut surface, and areas of [[hemorrhage]] and [[necrosis]]. On [[histopathology|microscopic examination]], the tumor usually displays sheets of atypical cells with some resemblance to the cells of the normal [[adrenal cortex]]. The presence of [[invasion]] and [[mitosis|mitotic activity]] help differentiate small cancers from [[adrenocortical adenoma]]s.<ref name="Weidner's"/>
There are several relatively rare variants of adrenal cortical carcinoma: '''Oncocytic adrenal cortical carcinoma''', '''Myxoid adrenal cortical carcinoma''', '''Carcinosarcoma''', '''Adenosquamous adrenocortical carcinoma''', '''Clear cell adrenal cortical carcinoma'''.

Differential diagnosis includes:
[[Adrenocortical adenoma]],
[[Renal cell carcinoma]],
[[Adrenal medullary tumors]],
[[Hepatocellular carcinoma]].

==Treatment==
The only curative treatment is complete [[surgery|surgical]] excision of the tumor, which can be performed even in the case of invasion into large blood vessels, such as the [[renal vein]] or [[inferior vena cava]]. The 5-year survival rate after successful surgery is 50-60%, but unfortunately, a large percentage of patients are not surgical candidates. [[Radiation therapy]] and [[radiofrequency ablation]] may be used for [[palliative care|palliation]] in patients who are not surgical candidates.<ref name="DeVita"/>
 
[[Chemotherapy]] regimens typically include the drug [[mitotane]], an inhibitor of [[steroid]] synthesis which is toxic to cells of the [[adrenal cortex]],<ref name="G&G">{{cite book |author=Laurence L. Brunton, editor-in-chief; John S. Lazo and Keith L. Parker, Associate Editors |title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th Edition |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. |location=United States of America |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-07-142280-3 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref> as well as standard cytotoxic drugs. A retrospective analysis showed a survival benefit for mitotane in addition to surgery when compared to surgery alone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Terzolo M |title=Adjuvant mitotane treatment for adrenocortical carcinoma |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=356 |issue=23 |pages=2372–80 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17554118 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa063360 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Angeli A |author3=Fassnacht M |display-authors=3 |last4=Daffara |first4=Fulvia |last5=Tauchmanova |first5=Libuse |last6=Conton |first6=Pier Antonio |last7=Rossetto |first7=Ruth |last8=Buci |first8=Lisa |last9=Sperone |first9=Paola}}</ref> 

The two most common regimens are [[cisplatin]], [[doxorubicin]], [[etoposide]] + [[mitotane]] and [[streptozotocin]] + [[mitotane]]. It is unknown which regimen is better. Researchers at [[Uppsala University Hospital]] initiated a collaboration between adrenocortical cancer specialists in Europe, USA and Australia, to conduct the first ever randomized controlled trial in adrenocortical cancer ([[FIRM-ACT study]]<ref>http://www.firm-act.org</ref>), comparing these two regimens.

==Prognosis==
ACC, generally, carries a poor prognosis<ref name=allolio>{{cite journal | author = Allolio B, Fassnacht M | title = Clinical review: Adrenocortical carcinoma: clinical update | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 91 | issue = 6 | pages = 2027–37 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16551738 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2005-2639}} [http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/91/6/2027 Free Full Text].</ref>
and is unlike most tumours of the adrenal cortex, which are [[benign]] ([[adenoma]]s) and only occasionally cause [[Cushing's syndrome]].  Five-year disease-free survival for a complete resection of a [[Cancer staging|stage]] I-III ACC is approximately 30%.<ref name=allolio/>
The most important prognostic factors are '''age''' of the patient and '''stage''' of the tumor.
Poor prognostic factors: mitotic activity, venous invasion, weight of 50g+; diameter of 6.5&nbsp;cm+, Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index of 4%+, p53+.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
Research Fellow Sachin H. Jain, Professor [[Michael Porter|Michael E.
