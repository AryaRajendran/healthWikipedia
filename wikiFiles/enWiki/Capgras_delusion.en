The '''Capgras delusion''' (or '''Capgras syndrome''') (pron: kăh′grah IPA:/ka·'grɑ:/)<ref>[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=87775 MediLexicon]</ref> is a disorder in which a person holds a [[delusion]] that a friend, spouse, parent, or other close family member has been replaced by an identical-looking [[impostor]]. The Capgras delusion is classified as a [[delusional misidentification syndrome]], a class of delusional beliefs that involves the misidentification of people, places, or objects (usually not in conjunction).<ref name=window>Ellis, H.

==History==
The Capgras delusion is named after [[Joseph Capgras]] (1873–1950), a [[France|French]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who first described the disorder in 1923 in his paper co-authored by Reboul-Lachaux,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capgras |first1=J. |last2=Reboul-Lachaux |first2=J. |title=Illusion des " sosies " dans un délire systématisé chronique |journal=Bulletin de la Société Clinique de Médicine Mentale |volume=2 |pages=6–16 |year=1923 |url=http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/histmed/medica/cote?epo1250}}</ref> on the case of a French woman, "Mme M.," who complained that corresponding "doubles" had taken the places of her husband and other people she knew.<ref name=vs /> Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux first called the syndrome “l’illusion des sosies”, which can be translated literally as "the illusion of 'doubles'..."<ref>[http://psychologie-m-fouchey.psyblogs.net/public/neuropsychoMarlene/l%C3%A9sions%20droites/syndrome_capgras.pdf "Approche clinique du syndrome de Capgras ou « illusion des sosies » illustrée par un cas"], Gaël Le Vacon, 2006; rough translation: "Clinical approach to Capgras sydrome or 'illusion of doubles' illustrated by a case"</ref>

The Capgras syndrome was initially considered a purely psychiatric disorder, the delusion of a double seen as symptomatic of schizophrenia, and purely a female disorder (though we now know this not to be the case<ref name=merrin>Merrin, E. L., & Silberfarb, P. M. (1976). The Capgras phenomenon. Archives of general psychiatry, 33(8), 965.</ref>) often noted as a symptom of hysteria. Most of the proposed explanations initially following that of Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux were psychoanalytical in nature. It was not until the 1980s that attention was turned to the usually co-existing organic brain lesions originally thought to be essentially unrelated or accidental. Today the Capgras syndrome is understood as a neurological disorder, in which the delusion primarily results from organic brain lesions or degeneration.<ref>Draaisma D.

At the time of her admission earlier in the year, she had received the diagnosis of atypical psychosis because of her belief that her husband had been replaced by another unrelated man. She refused to sleep with the impostor, locked her bedroom and door at night, asked her son for a gun, and finally fought with the police when attempts were made to hospitalise her. At times she believed her husband was her long deceased father. She easily recognised other family members and would misidentify her husband only."}}

{{quote|"Diane was a 28-year-old single woman who was seen for an evaluation at a day hospital program in preparation for discharge from a psychiatric hospital. This was her third psychiatric admission in the past five years. Always shy and reclusive, Diane first became psychotic at age 23. Following an examination by her physician, she began to worry that the doctor had damaged her internally and that she might never be able to become pregnant.  The patient’s condition improved with neuroleptic treatment but deteriorated after discharge because she refused medication. When she was admitted eight months later, she presented with delusions that a man was making exact copies of people—“screens”— and that there were two screens of her, one evil and one good. The diagnosis was schizophrenia with Capgras delusion. She was disheveled and had a bald spot on her scalp from self-mutilation."}}

==Causes==
Capgras is such a rare and bizarre syndrome that many theories have come out to try and explain it. One early explanation was the [[Freudian]] view. The theory is that the patient felt a strong sexual attraction to his mother ([[Oedipus Complex]]), and had strong resentment towards his father. These feelings are repressed throughout childhood, and the theory is that the blow to the head can cause the repressed latent sexual impulses to come back to the surface. The patient suddenly finds himself attracted to his mother, and thinks that it can't be his mother because of the sexual attraction, and therefore, that it must be an impostor.<ref name=vs /> However, since the Capgras delusion has been recorded to include multiple different family members, friends and even pets (one patient was convinced that his pet poodle had been replaced with a duplicate),<ref name=vs /> most believe the explanation is not as simple as what Freudian view proposes. Instead it is now generally agreed that the Capgras delusion has a more complex and organic basis, and can be better understood by examining neuroanatomical damage associated with the syndrome.<ref>Young, A. W., Reid, I., Wright, S. I. M. O. N., & Hellawell, D. J. (1993). Face-processing impairments and the Capgras delusion. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 162(5), 695-698.</ref>

Some of the first clues to the possible causes of the Capgras delusion were suggested by the study of brain-injured patients who had developed [[prosopagnosia]]. In this condition, patients are unable to [[face perception|recognize faces consciously]], despite being able to recognize other types of visual objects. However, a 1984 study by Bauer showed that even though conscious face recognition was impaired, patients with the condition showed [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] arousal (measured by a [[galvanic skin response]] measure) to familiar faces,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(84)90040-X |last1=Bauer |first1=R.M. |title=Autonomic recognition of names and faces in prosopagnosia: a neuropsychological application of the Guilty Knowledge Test |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=457–69 |year=1984 |pmid=6483172}}</ref> suggesting that there are two pathways to face recognition—one conscious and one unconscious.

In a 1990 paper published in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'', psychologists Hadyn Ellis and Andy Young hypothesized that patients with Capgras delusion may have a "mirror image" of prosopagnosia, in that their conscious ability to recognize faces was intact, but they might have damage to the system that produces the automatic emotional arousal to familiar faces.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.157.2.239 |last1=Ellis |first1=H.D. |last2=Young |first2=A.W. |title=Accounting for delusional misidentifications |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=157 |pages=239–48 |year=1990 |month=August |pmid=2224375 |issue=2}}</ref> This might lead to the experience of recognizing someone while feeling something was not "quite right" about them. 
In 1997, Hadyn Ellis and his colleagues published a study of five patients with Capgras delusion (all diagnosed with schizophrenia) and confirmed that although they could consciously recognize the faces, they did not show the normal automatic emotional arousal response.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0150  |last1=Ellis |first1=H.D. |last2=Young |first2=A.W. |last3=Quayle |first3=A.H. |last4=De Pauw |first4=K.W. |title=Reduced autonomic responses to faces in Capgras delusion |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences  |volume=264 |pages=1085–92 |year=1997 |issue=1384 }}</ref> The same low level of autonomic response was shown in the presence of strangers. Young (2008) has theorized that this means that patients suffering from the disease experience a "loss" of familiarity, not a "lack" of it.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2008.01.006 |last=Young |first=G. |title=Capgras delusion: An interactionist model |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |volume=17 |pages=863–76 |year=2008 |month=September |issue=3}}</ref> 

[[William Hirstein]] and [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] reported similar findings in a paper published on a single case of a patient with Capgras delusion after brain injury.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0062 |last1=Hirstein |first1=W. |last2=Ramachandran |first2=V.S. |title=Capgras syndrome: a novel probe for understanding the neural representation of the identity and familiarity of persons |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=264 |pages=437–444 |year=1997 |pmid=9107057 |pmc=1688258 |issue=1380}}</ref> Ramachandran portrayed this case in his book ''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramachandran |first=V.S. |authorlink= Vilayanur S. Ramachandran |coauthors= Blakeslee S.|title=Phantoms in the Brain |year=1998 |publisher=Harper Perennial |location=Great Britain |isbn=1-85702-895-3}}</ref> and gave a talk about it at [[TED (conference)|TED]] 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/vilayanur_ramachandran_on_your_mind.html |title=VS Ramachandran: 3 clues to understanding your brain |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |date=March 2007}}</ref> Since the patient was capable of feeling emotions and recognizing faces, but could not feel emotions when recognizing familiar faces, Ramachandran hypothesizes that the origin of Capgras syndrome is a disconnection between the temporal [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], where faces are usually recognized (see [[temporal lobe]]), and the [[limbic system]], involved in [[emotion]]s. More specifically, he emphasizes the disconnection between the [[amygdala]] and the [[inferotemporal cortex]].<ref name=vs /> 

Furthermore, Ramachandran suggests a relationship between the Capgras syndrome and a more general difficulty in linking successive [[episodic memories]] because of the crucial role emotion plays in creating memories. Since the patient could not put together memories and feelings, he believed objects in a photograph were new on every viewing, even though they normally should have evoked feelings (e.g., a person close to him, a familiar object, or even himself).<ref>Hirstein, William  and V.S. Ramachandran. "Capgras syndrome: a novel probe for understanding the neural representation of the identity and familiarity of persons." Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences. Vol 264, No 1380/March 22, 1997.</ref> Others like Merrin and Silberfarb (1976) <ref name=merrin /> have also proposed links between the Capgras syndrome and deficits in aspects of memory. They suggest that an important and familiar person (the usual subject of the delusion) has many layers of visual, auditory, tactile, and experiential memories associated with them, so the Capgras delusion can be understood as a failure of object constancy at a high perceptual level.

Most likely, more than an impairment of the automatic emotional arousal response is necessary to form Capgras delusion, as the same pattern has been reported in patients showing no signs of delusions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.1995.7.4.425 |last1=Tranel |first1=D. |last2=Damasio |first2=H. |last3=Damasio |first3=A. |title=Double dissociation between overt and covert face recognition |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=425–432 |year=1995 |issue=4}}</ref> Ellis and colleagues suggested that a second factor explains why this unusual experience is transformed into a delusional belief; this second factor is thought to be an impairment in reasoning, although no definitive impairment has been found to explain all cases.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/ppp.2001.0007 |last1=Davies |first1=M. |last2=Coltheart |first2=M. |last3=Langdon |first3=R. |last4=Breen |first4=N. |title=Monothematic delusions: Towards a two-factor account |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, and Psychology |volume=8 |pages=133–158 |year=2001 |issue=2}}</ref> Many have argued for the inclusion of the role of patient phenomenology in explanatory models of the Capgras syndrome in order to better understand the mechanisms that enable the creation and maintenance of delusional beliefs.<ref>Young, G. (2008). Restating the role of phenomenal experience in the formation and maintenance of the capgras delusion. Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences, 7(2), 177-189. Retrieved from www.scopus.com</ref><ref>Ratcliffe, M. (2008). The phenomenological role of affect in the Capgras delusion. Continental Philosophy Review, 41(2), 195-216.</ref>  

Capgras syndrome has also been linked to [[reduplicative paramnesia]], another delusional misidentification syndrome.  Since these two syndromes are highly associated, it has been proposed that they affect similar areas of the brain and therefore have similar neurological implications.  Reduplicative paramnesia is understood to affect the frontal lobe and thus it is believed that Capgras syndrome is also associated with the frontal lobe.<ref>Alexander, M. P., Stuss, D. T., & Benson, D. F. (1979). Capgras syndrome A reduplicative phenomenon. Neurology, 29(3), 334-334.</ref> Even if the damage is not directly to the frontal lobe, an interruption of signals between other lobes and the frontal lobe could result in Capgras syndrome.<ref name=Josephs/>

==Treatment==
Individual therapy may be best suited to treat the individuals delusions. Persistence is needed in establishing a therapeutic empathy without validating the patients’s delusional system or overtly confronting the system. Cognitive techniques that include reality testing and reframing can be used. Antipsychotics and other therapeutic drugs have been used with relative success.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.psychnet-uk.com/x_new_site/DSM_IV/capgras_syndrome.html |title=Capgras (Delusion) Syndrome |work=PsychNet-UK}}</ref>
