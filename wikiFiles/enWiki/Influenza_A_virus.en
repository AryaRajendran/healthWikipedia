'''''Influenza A virus''''' causes [[influenza]] in birds and some [[mammal]]s, and is the only [[species]] of influenzavirus A. Influenzavirus A is a [[genus]] of the ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]'' family of viruses. Strains of all subtypes of influenza A virus have been isolated from wild birds, although disease is uncommon. Some [[primary isolate|isolates]] of influenza A virus cause severe disease both in domestic poultry and, rarely, in humans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/ |title=Avian influenza (" bird flu") — Fact sheet |publisher=WHO }}</ref>  Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from wild aquatic birds to domestic poultry, and this may cause an outbreak or give rise to human influenza [[pandemic]]s.<ref name=sobrino6>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |author=Klenk, ''et al.'' |year=2008 |chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range |title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |isbn=978-1-904455-22-6}}</ref><ref name=Kawaoka>{{cite book | editor = Kawaoka Y | title = Influenza Virology: Current Topics | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2006 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu | isbn = 1-904455-06-9}}</ref>

Influenza A viruses are [[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]], single-stranded, segmented [[RNA virus]]es.
The several subtypes are labeled according to an H number (for the type of [[Hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]]) and an N number (for the type of [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]]). There are 17 different H [[antigen]]s (H1 to H17) and nine different N antigens (N1 to N9). The newest H antigen type, identified as H17 by researchers, was isolated from [[fruit bat]]s in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2012/03march/Pages/cdc-finds-h17-bat-influenza.aspx|title=Unique new flu virus found in bats|publisher=NHS Choices|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/nature.2012.10112}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.1116200109}}</ref>

Each virus subtype has [[Mutation|mutate]]d into a variety of strains with differing [[pathogen]]ic profiles; some are pathogenic to one species but not others, some are pathogenic to multiple species.

A filtered and purified influenza A vaccine for humans has been developed, and many countries have stockpiled it to allow a quick administration to the population in the event of an [[avian influenza]] [[pandemic]]. Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu, and colloquially, bird flu. In 2011, researchers reported the discovery of an antibody effective against all types of the influenza A virus.<ref name=bbc110729>{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14324901 | title = 'Super antibody' fights off flu | last = Gallagher | first = James |date = 29 July 2011 |work=BBC News | accessdate =29 July 2011 }}</ref>

==Variants and subtypes==
{{Flu}}

{{H5N1}}

Influenza type A viruses are categorized into subtypes based on the type of two [[proteins]] on the surface of the viral envelope:

:H = [[hemagglutinin]], a protein that causes [[red blood cells]] to [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinate]].
:N = [[neuraminidase]], an enzyme that cleaves the [[glycosidic bond]]s of the [[monosaccharide]], [[neuraminic acid]]

Different influenza viruses encode for different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. For example, the [[influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 virus]] designates an influenza A subtype that has a type 5 hemagglutinin (H) protein and a type 1 neuraminidase (N) protein. There are 17 known types of hemagglutinin and 9 known types of neuraminidase, so, in theory, 153 different combinations of these proteins are possible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/flu-viruses.htm |title=Influenza Viruses |date=18 November 2005 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

Some variants are identified and named according to the isolate they resemble, thus are presumed to share lineage (example [[Fujian flu]] virus-like); according to their typical host (example [[human flu]] virus); according to their subtype (example H3N2); and according to their deadliness (example LP, low pathogenic). So a flu from a virus similar to the isolate A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) is called [[Fujian]] flu, human flu, and H3N2 flu.

Variants are sometimes named according to the species (host) in which the strain is endemic or to which it is adapted. The main variants named using this convention are:
* [[Avian influenza|Bird flu]]
* [[Human flu]]
* [[Swine influenza]]
* [[Equine influenza]]
* [[Canine influenza]]

Variants have also sometimes been named according to their deadliness in poultry, especially chickens:
* Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI)
* Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), also called deadly flu or death flu

Most known strains are extinct strains. For example, the annual flu subtype H3N2 no longer contains the strain that caused the [[Hong Kong flu]].

== Annual flu ==
{{main|Flu season}}

The annual flu (also called "seasonal flu" or "human flu") in the U.S. "results in approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. In addition to this human toll, influenza is annually responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion in the U.S."<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html whitehouse.gov] National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza —  Introduction — "Although remarkable advances have been made in science and medicine during the past century, we are constantly reminded that we live in a universe of microbes – viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi that are forever changing and adapting themselves to the human host and the defenses that humans create. Influenza viruses are notable for their resilience and adaptability. While science has been able to develop highly effective vaccines and treatments for many infectious diseases that threaten public health, acquiring these tools is an ongoing challenge with the influenza virus. Changes in the genetic makeup of the virus require us to develop new vaccines on an annual basis and forecast which strains are likely to predominate. As a result, and despite annual vaccinations, the U.S. faces a burden of influenza that results in approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. In addition to this human toll, influenza is annually responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion in the U.S. A pandemic, or worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus, could dwarf this impact by overwhelming our health and medical capabilities, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of hospitalizations, and hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs. This Strategy will guide our preparedness and response activities to mitigate that impact."</ref>

The annually updated, trivalent [[influenza vaccine]] consists of [[hemagglutinin]] (HA) surface glycoprotein components from influenza [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]], [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]], and [[Influenzavirus B|B influenza]] viruses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Daum LT, Shaw MW, Klimov AI, ''et al.'' |title=Influenza A (H3N2) outbreak, Nepal |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=1186–91 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16102305 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no08/05-0302.htm |doi=10.3201/eid1108.050302 |pmc=3320503}}<br/>"The 2003–2004 influenza season was severe in terms of its impact on illness because of widespread circulation of antigenically distinct influenza A (H3N2) Fujian-like viruses. These viruses first appeared late during the 2002–2003 influenza season and continued to persist as the dominant circulating strain throughout the subsequent 2003–2004 influenza season, replacing the A/Panama/2007/99-like H3N2 viruses (1). Of the 172 H3N2 viruses genetically characterized by the Department of Defense in 2003–2004, only one isolate (from Thailand) belonged to the A/Panama-like lineage. In February 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) changed the H3N2 component for the 2004–2005 influenza vaccine to afford protection against the widespread emergence of Fujian-like viruses (2). The annually updated trivalent vaccine consists of hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein components from influenza H3N2, H1N1, and B viruses."</ref>

Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]] in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.

"Contemporary human H3N2 influenza viruses are now [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in pigs in southern China and can [[reassortment|reassort]] with avian [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]] viruses in this intermediate host."<ref name=Nap_p126>{{harvnb|Mahmoud|2005|p=[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/126.html 126]}}<br/>"H5N1 virus is now endemic in poultry in Asia (Table 2-1) and has gained an entrenched ecological niche from which to present a long-term pandemic threat to humans. At present, these viruses are poorly transmitted from poultry to humans, and there is no conclusive evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, continued, extensive exposure of the human population to H5N1 viruses increases the likelihood that the viruses will acquire the necessary characteristics for efficient human-to-human transmission through genetic mutation or reassortment with a prevailing human influenza A virus. Furthermore, contemporary human H3N2 influenza viruses are now endemic in pigs in southern China (Peiris et al., 2001) and can reassort with avian H5N1 viruses in this 'intermediate host.' Therefore, it is imperative that outbreaks of H5N1 disease in poultry in Asia are rapidly and sustainably controlled. The seasonality of the disease in poultry, together with the control measures already implemented, are likely to reduce temporarily the frequency of H5N1 influenza outbreaks and the probability of human infection."</ref>

===F16 antibody===
[[F16 (antibody)|F16]], an [[antibody]] that targets the hemagglutinin protein, was recently discovered, and is the only known antibody effective against all 16 subtypes of the influenza A virus.<ref name="BBC">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14324901 BBC: 'Super antibody' fights off flu]</ref><ref name="Independent">[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-hail-the-prospect-of-a-universal-vaccine-for-flu-2327993.html Independent: Scientists hail the prospect of a universal vaccine for flu]</ref><ref name="Huffington">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/28/universal-flu-vaccine-antibody_n_912603.html Huffington Post: Universal Flu Vaccine On The Horizon: Researchers Find 'Super Antibody']</ref>

==Structure and genetics==
{{See also|H5N1 genetic structure}}
"The physical structure of all influenza A viruses is similar. The virions or virus particles are enveloped and can be either spherical or filamentous in form. In clinical isolates that have undergone limited passages in eggs or tissue culture, there are more filamentous than spherical particles, whereas passaged laboratory strains consist mainly of spherical virions."<ref>[http://www.clinicalservicesjournal.com/print.asp?id=872 Clinical Services Journal] article ''Avian influenza issues analysed'' published March 2006</ref>

The Influenza A virus genome is contained on eight single (non-paired) RNA strands that code for eleven proteins (HA, NA, NP, M1, [[Influenza virus matrix protein 2|M2]], NS1, NEP, PA, PB1, PB1-F2, PB2). The total genome size is 13,588 bases.<ref>[http://www.microbiologybytes.com/virology/Orthomyxoviruses.html MicrobiologyBytes: Virology: Orthomyxoviruses]</ref>  The segmented nature of the genome allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral [[strain (biology)|strains]] during cellular cohabitation. The  eight RNA segments are:
*HA encodes [[Influenza hemagglutinin|hemagglutinin]] (about 500 molecules of hemagglutinin are needed to make one [[virion]]) "The extent of infection into host organism is determined by HA. Influenza viruses bud from the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells (e.g. bronchial epithelial cells) into lumen of lungs and are therefore usually pneumotropic. The reason is that HA is cleaved by tryptase clara which is restricted to lungs. However HAs of H5 and H7 pantropic avian viruses subtypes can be cleaved by furin and subtilisin-type enzymes, allowing the virus to grow in other organs than lungs."<ref>[http://www.expasy.org/uniprot/P09345 UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry P09345] Complete sequence of a cDNA clone of the hemagglutinin gene of influenza A/Chicken/Scotland/59 (H5N1) virus: comparison with contemporary North American and European strains.</ref>
*NA encodes [[neuraminidase]] (about 100 molecules of neuraminidase are needed to make one virion).
*NP encodes [[nucleoprotein]].
*M encodes two [[matrix protein]]s (the [[M1 protein|M1]] and the [[M2 protein|M2]]) by using different [[reading frame]]s from the same RNA segment (about 3000  matrix protein molecules are needed to make one virion).
*NS encodes two distinct non-structural proteins (NS1 and NEP) by using different reading frames from the same RNA segment.
*PA encodes an [[RNA polymerase]].
*PB1 encodes an RNA polymerase and PB1-F2 protein (induces [[apoptosis]]) by using different reading frames from the same RNA segment.
*PB2 encodes an RNA polymerase.

The genome segments have common terminal sequences, and the ends of the RNA strands are partially [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]], allowing them to bond to each other by [[hydrogen bond]]s. After transcription from negative-sense to [[Sense (molecular biology)|positive-sense RNA]] the +RNA strands get the cellular [[5' cap]] added by cap snatching, which involves the viral protein NS1 binding to the cellular pre-mRNAs. The cap is then cleaved from the cellular pre-mRNA using a second viral protein, PA. The short [[Oligonucleotide|oligo]] cap is then added to the influenza +RNA strands, allowing its processing as [[messenger RNA]] by [[ribosome]]s. The +RNA strands also serve for synthesis of -RNA strands for new virions.

The [[RNA]] synthesis and its assembly with the nucleoprotein takes place in the [[cell nucleus]], the synthesis of proteins takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. The assembled virion cores leave the nucleus and migrate towards the [[cell membrane]], with patches of viral [[transmembrane protein]]s (hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and M2 proteins) and an underlying layer of the M1 protein, and [[budding|bud]] through these patches, releasing finished enveloped viruses into the [[extracellular fluid]].

Evidence has been found for the presence of [[RNA structure]] in Influenza A virus.<ref>[http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/17/6/991.abstract RNA Journal] article ''Identification of potential conserved RNA secondary structure throughout influenza A coding regions'' published May 2011</ref> Structured RNA appears to be favored in the +RNA, and is clustered near regions with functional importance. Two [[pseudoknot]] RNA structures were predicted that include the 3' [[splice site]] in Segments 7 and 8, which are both alternatively spliced to produce the M2 and NEP proteins respectively. Towards the 5' splice sites of these mRNAs, [[hairpin loop]] and [[multibranch loop]] structures were predicted. As well as these structures near splice sites, a [[pseudoknot]] was proposed in Segment 2, which encompasses the [[start codon]] for an internally transcribed [[open reading frame]] for a small polypeptide product (PB1-F2).

==In Non-humans==
:''See [[H5N1]] for the current [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area) of H5N1 influenza''

;Avian influenza
{{main|Avian influenza}}

[[Fowl]] act as natural [[asymptomatic carrier]]s of influenza A viruses. Prior to the current H5N1 epizootic, strains of influenza A virus had been demonstrated to be transmitted from wild fowl to only birds, pigs, horses, [[Pinniped|seal]]s, whales and humans; and only between humans and pigs and between humans and domestic fowl; and not other pathways such as domestic fowl to horse.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahmoud|2005|p=[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/30.html 30]}}</ref>

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a large variety of influenza A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these birds to other species and may then cause devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry or give rise to human influenza pandemics.<ref name="sobrino6"/><ref name="Kawaoka"/>

H5N1 has been shown to be transmitted to tigers, leopards, and domestic cats that were fed uncooked domestic fowl (chickens) with the virus. [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N8|H3N8]] viruses from horses have crossed over and caused outbreaks in dogs. Laboratory mice have been infected successfully with a variety of avian flu genotypes.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahmoud|2005|p=[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/82.html 82]}}<br/> "Interestingly, recombinant influenza viruses containing the 1918 HA and NA and up to three additional genes derived from the 1918 virus (the other genes being derived from the A/WSN/33 virus) were all highly virulent in mice (Tumpey et al., 2004). Furthermore, expression microarray analysis performed on whole lung tissue of mice infected with the 1918 HA/ NA recombinant showed increased upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, tissue injury, and oxidative damage (Kash et al., 2004). These findings were unusual because the viruses with the 1918 genes had not been adapted to mice. The completion of the sequence of the entire genome of the 1918 virus and the reconstruction and characterization of viruses with 1918 genes under appropriate biosafety conditions will shed more light on these findings and should allow a definitive examination of this explanation. Antigenic analysis of recombinant viruses possessing the 1918 HA and NA by hemagglutination inhibition tests using ferret and chicken antisera suggested a close relationship with the A/swine/Iowa/30 virus and H1N1 viruses isolated in the 1930s (Tumpey et al., 2004), further supporting data of Shope from the 1930s (Shope, 1936). Interestingly, when mice were immunized with different H1N1 virus strains, challenge studies using the 1918-like viruses revealed partial protection by this treatment, suggesting that current vaccination strategies are adequate against a 1918-like virus (Tumpey et al., 2004)."</ref>

Influenza A viruses spread in the air and in [[manure]], and survives longer in cold weather.  It can also be transmitted by contaminated feed, water, equipment and clothing; however, there is no evidence the virus can survive in well-cooked meat. Symptoms in animals vary, but virulent strains can cause death within a few days.

"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is on every top ten list available for potential agricultural bioweapon agents".<ref>{{harvnb|Mahmoud|2005|p=[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/285.html 285]}}<br/>"As of October 2001, the potential for use of infectious agents, such as anthrax, as weapons has been firmly established. It has been suggested that attacks on a nation’s agriculture might be a preferred form of terrorism or economic disruption that would not have the attendant stigma of infecting and causing disease in humans. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is on every top ten list available for potential agricultural bioweapon agents, generally following foot and mouth disease virus and Newcastle disease virus at or near the top of the list. Rapid detection techniques for bioweapon agents are a critical need for the first-responder community, on a par with vaccine and antiviral development in preventing spread of disease."</ref>

Avian influenza viruses that the [[OIE]] and others test for to control poultry disease include: [[H5N1]], [[H7N2]], [[H1N7]], [[H7N3]], [[H13N6]], [[H5N9]], H11N6, [[H3N8]], [[H9N2]], [[H5N2]], H4N8, [[H10N7]], [[H2N2]], H8N4, H14N5, H6N5, H12N5 and others.

1979: "More than 400 harbor seals, most of them immature, died along the New England coast between December 1979 and October 1980 of acute pneumonia associated with influenza virus, A/Seal/Mass/1/180 (H7N7)."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Geraci JR, St Aubin DJ, Barker IK, ''et al.'' |title=Mass mortality of harbor seals: pneumonia associated with influenza A virus |journal=Science |volume=215 |issue=4536 |pages=1129–31 |year=1982 |month=February |pmid=7063847 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7063847 |quote=More than 400 harbor seals, most of them immature, died along the New England coast between December 1979 and October 1980 of acute pneumonia associated with influenza virus, A/Seal/Mass/1/180 (H7N7).

Concurrent infection with a previously undescribed mycoplasma or adverse environmental conditions may have triggered the epizootic.

;Swine flu
{{main|Swine influenza}}
:Swine influenza (or "pig influenza") refers to a subset of Orthomyxoviridae that create influenza and are endemic in pigs. The species of Orthomyxoviridae that can cause flu in pigs are influenza A virus and [[Influenzavirus C|influenza C virus]], but not all genotypes of these two species infect pigs. The known subtypes of influenza A virus that create influenza and are endemic in pigs are H1N1, H1N2, [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N1|H3N1]] and H3N2.

;Horse flu
{{main|Equine influenza}}
:Horse flu (or "equine influenza") refers to varieties of influenza A virus that affect horses. Horse flu viruses were only isolated in 1956. The two main types of virus are called equine-1 (H7N7), which commonly affects horse heart muscle, and equine-2 (H3N8), which is usually more severe.

;Dog flu
{{main|Canine influenza}}
:Dog flu (or "canine influenza") refers to varieties of influenza A virus that affect dogs. The equine influenza virus H3N8 was found to infect and kill – with respiratory illness – greyhound race dogs at a Florida racetrack in January 2004.

==Human influenza virus==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:HolidaySnap2008.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese [[commuter]] wearing a face mask]] -->

"Human influenza virus" usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are the only known influenza A virus subtypes currently circulating among humans.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/facts.htm CDC] ''Key Facts About Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) and Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus''</ref>

Genetic factors in distinguishing between "human flu viruses" and "avian influenza viruses" include:
:'''PB2''': (RNA polymerase): [[Amino acid]] (or [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]) position 627 in the PB2 protein encoded by the PB2 RNA gene. Until H5N1, all known avian influenza viruses had a [[Glutamic acid|Glu]] at position 627, while all human influenza viruses had a [[lysine]].
:'''HA''': (hemagglutinin): Avian influenza HA binds alpha 2–3 [[sialic acid]] receptors, while human influenza HA binds alpha 2–6 sialic acid receptors. Swine influenza viruses have the ability to bind both types of sialic acid receptors.
"About 52 key genetic changes distinguish avian influenza strains from those that spread easily among people, according to researchers in Taiwan, who analyzed the genes of more than 400 A type flu viruses."<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=a6S3ZQwqZkS4&refer=latin_america Bloomberg News] article '' Scientists Move Closer to Understanding Flu Virus Evolution'' published 28 August 2006</ref> "How many mutations would make an avian virus capable of infecting humans efficiently, or how many mutations would render an influenza virus a pandemic strain, is difficult to predict. We have examined sequences from the 1918 strain, which is the only pandemic influenza virus that could be entirely derived from avian strains. Of the 52 species-associated positions, 16 have residues typical for human strains; the others remained as avian signatures. The result supports the hypothesis that the 1918 pandemic virus is more closely related to the avian influenza A virus than are other human influenza viruses."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen GW, Chang SC, Mok CK, ''et al.'' |title=Genomic signatures of human versus avian influenza A viruses |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=1353–60 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=17073083 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no09/06-0276.htm |doi=10.3201/eid1209.060276 |pmc=3294750}}</ref>

Human flu symptoms usually include fever, cough, [[sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[conjunctivitis]] and, in severe cases, severe breathing problems and [[pneumonia]] that may be fatal.  The severity of the infection will depend in large part on the state of the infected person's [[immune system]] and if the victim has been exposed to the strain before, and is therefore partially immune.

Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human is far worse, killing 50% of humans that catch it. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced [[diarrhea]] followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Jong MD, Bach VC, Phan TQ, ''et al.'' |title=Fatal avian influenza A (H5N1) in a child presenting with diarrhea followed by coma |journal=N.

The influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:
*[[H1N1]] caused "[[Spanish flu]]" and the [[2009 swine flu outbreak]]
*[[H2N2]] caused "[[Asian flu]]" in the late 1950s
*[[H3N2]] caused "[[Hong Kong flu]]" in the late 1960s
*[[H5N1]] considered a global [[influenza pandemic]] threat through [[Global spread of H5N1|its spread]] in the mid-2000s
*[[H7N7]] has unusual [[zoonotic]] potential
*[[H1N2]] is currently endemic in humans and pigs
*[[H9N2]], [[H7N2]], [[H7N3]], [[H5N2]], and [[H10N7]].

;H1N1
{{main|Influenza A virus subtype H1N1}}
:H1N1 is currently pandemic in both human and pig populations. A variant of H1N1 was responsible for the Spanish flu pandemic that killed some 50 million to 100 million people worldwide over about a year in 1918 and 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahmoud|2005|p=[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/7.html 7]}}</ref> Another variant was named a pandemic threat in the [[2009 flu pandemic]].  Controversy arose in October, 2005, after the H1N1 [[genome]] was published in the journal, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], because of fears that this information could be used for [[bioterrorism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

;H2N2
{{main|Influenza A virus subtype H2N2}}
:The Asian flu, a pandemic outbreak of H2N2 avian influenza, originated in China in 1957, spread worldwide that same year during which a influenza vaccine was developed, lasted until 1958 and caused between one and four million deaths.

;H3N2
{{main|Influenza A virus subtype H3N2}}
:H3N2 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. It evolved from H2N2 by [[antigenic shift]] and caused the Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000.<ref>Detailed chart of its evolution [http://www.eletrica.ufsj.edu.br/~nepomuceno/references/epidemiology/ear_eal02.pdf here] at PDF called ''Ecology and Evolution of the Flu''</ref> "An early-onset, severe form of influenza A H3N2 made headlines when it claimed the lives of several children in the United States in late 2003."<ref>{{harvnb|Mahmoud|2005|p=[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/115.html 115]}}<br/>"There is particular pressure to recognize and heed the lessons of past influenza pandemics in the shadow of the worrisome 2003–2004 flu season. An early-onset, severe form of influenza A H3N2 made headlines when it claimed the lives of several children in the United States in late 2003. As a result, stronger than usual demand for annual flu inactivated vaccine outstripped the vaccine supply, of which 10 to 20 percent typically goes unused. Because statistics on pediatric flu deaths had not been collected previously, it is unknown if the 2003–2004 season witnessed a significant change in mortality patterns."</ref>

:The dominant strain of annual flu in January 2006 was H3N2. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine in H3N2 increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.<ref>[http://www.reason.com/rb/rb101905.shtml Reason] [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/health/15drugs.html New York Times] ''This Season's Flu Virus Is Resistant to 2 Standard Drugs'' By Altman Published: 15 January 2006</ref>

;H5N1
{{main|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1}}
:H5N1 is the world's major influenza pandemic threat.

:"When he compared the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 virus]] with today's human flu viruses, Dr. Taubenberger noticed that it had alterations in just 25 to 30 of the virus's 4,400 amino acids. Those few changes turned a bird virus into a killer that could spread from person to person."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/08/science/08flu.html?pagewanted=2 New York Times] Published: 8 November 2005 — ''Hazard in Hunt for New Flu: Looking for Bugs in All the Wrong Places''</ref>

;H7N7
{{main|Influenza A virus subtype H7N7}}
:H7N7 has unusual zoonotic potential. In 2003 in Netherlands, 89 people were confirmed to have H7N7 influenza virus infection following an outbreak in poultry on several farms. One death was recorded.

;H7N9

;H1N2
{{main|Influenza A virus subtype H1N2}}
:H1N2 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. The new H1N2 strain appears to have resulted from the reassortment of the genes of the currently circulating influenza H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. The hemagglutinin protein of the H1N2 virus is similar to that of the currently circulating H1N1 viruses, and the neuraminidase protein is similar to that of the current H3N2 viruses.

===Evolution===

Taubenberger says:
:"All influenza A pandemics since [the Spanish flu pandemic], and indeed almost all cases of influenza A worldwide (excepting human infections from avian viruses such as H5N1 and H7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918 virus, including "drifted" H1N1 viruses and reassorted H2N2 and H3N2 viruses. The latter are composed of key genes from the 1918 virus, updated by subsequently incorporated avian influenza genes that code for novel surface proteins, making the 1918 virus indeed the "mother" of all pandemics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Taubenberger JK, Morens DM |title=1918 Influenza: the mother of all pandemics |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–22 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16494711 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-0979.htm |pmc=3291398 |doi=10.3201/eid1201.050979}}</ref>

Researchers from the [[National Institutes of Health]] used data from the [[Influenza Genome Sequencing Project]] and concluded that during the ten-year period examined, most of the time the hemagglutinin gene in H3N2 showed no significant excess of mutations in the antigenic regions while an increasing variety of strains accumulated. This resulted in one of the variants eventually achieving higher fitness, becoming dominant, and in a brief interval of rapid [[evolution]], rapidly sweeping through the population and eliminating most other variants.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061026185115.htm Science Daily] article ''New Study Has Important Implications For Flu Surveillance'' published  27 October 2006</ref>

'''Short-term Evolution'''
In the short-term evolution of influenza A virus, a 2006 study found that stochastic, or random, processes are key factors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Martha|coauthors=L. Simonsen, C. Viboud, M. A. Miller, J. Taylor, K. S. George, S. B. Griesemer et al.|title=Stochastic Processes Are Key Determinants of Short-Term Evolution in Influenza A Virus|journal=PLoS Pathogens|year=2006|month=December}}</ref>  Influenza A virus HA antigenic evolution appears to be characterized more by punctuated, sporadic jumps as opposed to a constant rate of antigenic change.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Derek J.|coauthors=A. S. Lapedes, J. C. de Jong, T. M. Bestebroer, G. F. Rimmelzwaan, A. D. M. E. Osterhaus, and R. A. M. Fouchier.|title=Mapping the Antigenic and Genetic Evolution of Influenza Virus|journal=Science|year=2004|month=July|volume=305|pages=371–376|doi=10.1126/science.1097211|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/305/5682/371.short|accessdate=14 November 2011|issue=5682|pmid=15218094}}</ref>  Using phylogenetic analysis of 413 complete genomes of human influenza A viruses that were collected throughout the state of New York, the authors of Nelson et al. 2006 were able to show that genetic diversity, and not antigenic drift, shaped the short-term evolution of influenza A via random migration and reassortment.  The evolution of these viruses is dominated more by the random importation of genetically different viral strains from other geographic locations and less by natural selection.  Within a given season, adaptive evolution is infrequent and had an overall weak effect as evidenced from the data gathered from the 413 genomes.  Phylogenetic analysis revealed the different strains were derived from newly imported genetic material as opposed to isolates that had been circulating in New York in previous seasons.  Therefore, the gene flow in and out of this population, and not natural selection, was more important in the short term.
