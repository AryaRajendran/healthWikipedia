'''Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder''' ('''Non-24''') is a chronic [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]], classified within Chapter VI, ''Diseases of the Nervous System'', in the [[ICD-10]]. It can be defined as "a chronic steady pattern comprising one- to two-hour daily delays in sleep onset and wake times in an individual living in society".<ref name=ICSD/> The pattern of delay persists literally "around the clock", typically taking a few weeks to complete one cycle. This disruption of the body clock causes cyclical bouts of nighttime sleeplessness and excessive daytime fatigue and napping. People with Non-24 "resemble free-running, normal individuals living in a time-isolation facility with no external time cues".<ref name="El-Ad">{{cite web |url=http://www.medlink.com/medlinkcontent.asp |title=Circadian rhythm sleep disorder: free-running type |accessdate=2009-08-08 |last=El-Ad |first=Baruch |date=2009-04-09 |format=Clinical Summary |publisher=MedLink Neurology |quote=(search, upper left, for "non-24")}}</ref>

Non-24 is a neurological sleep disorder. It has been traced to a number of genetic abnormalities that affect specific biologic factors in the brain.  While both sighted and blind people are diagnosed with Non-24, the disorder affects proportionately more totally blind individuals than sighted.

Though often referred to as Non-24, it is also known by the following terms:
* Free running disorder (FRD)
* Hypernychthemeral disorder
* Circadian rhythm sleep disorder – [[free-running sleep|free-running]] type
* Circadian rhythm sleep disorder – nonentrained type
* Non-24-hour circadian rhythm disorder
* Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder

The disorder is an [[invisible disability]] and "is extremely debilitating in that it is incompatible with most social and professional obligations".<ref name="NEJM1992" />

==Characteristics==
In people with this disorder, the body essentially insists that the day is longer than 24 hours and refuses to adjust to the external light/dark cycle. This makes it impossible to sleep at normal times and also causes daily shifts in other aspects of the [[circadian rhythm]]s such as peak time of alertness, body temperature minimum and hormone secretion. Left untreated, non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome causes a person's sleep-wake cycle to change every day, the degree determined by how much over 24 hours the cycle lasts. The cycle progresses around the clock, eventually returning to "normal" for one or two days before "going off" again. This is known as [[free-running sleep]]. 

Most cases that have been reported in the medical literature have occurred in [[blindness|blind]] patients; Non-24 occurs in more than half of all people who are totally blind.<ref name="AASM2008">{{cite web |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/resources/factsheets/crsd.pdf |title=Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder |accessdate=2009-08-08 |year=2008 |format=PDF |publisher=American Academy of Sleep Medicine}}</ref> The disorder can occur at any age, from birth onwards.  It generally follows shortly after loss or removal of a person’s eyes,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Uchimaya, Makoto; Lockley, Steven W. |title=Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Syndrome in Sighted and Blind Patients |journal=Sleep Med Clin |volume=4 |pages=195–211 |year=2009 |url= http://sleep.theclinics.com/article/S1556-407X(09)00016-2/abstract}}</ref> as the [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina are also removed.

In the first detailed study of Non-24 in a blind subject, researchers reported on a 28-year-old male who had a 24.9-hour rhythm in sleep, plasma cortisol, and other parameters. Even while adhering to a typical 24-hour schedule for bedtime, rise time, work, and meals, the man’s body rhythms continued to shift.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miles LE, Raynal DM, Wilson MA |title=Blind man living in normal society has circadian rhythms of 24.9 hours |journal=Science |volume=198 |issue=4315 |pages=421–3 |year=1977 |month=October |pmid=910139 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=910139 |doi=10.1126/science.910139}}</ref>

Without light to the retina, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the hypothalamus, is not cued each day to synchronize the circadian rhythm to the 24-hour social day, resulting in Non-24 for a majority of totally blind individuals.<ref name="AASM2008"/> Non-24 is rare among visually impaired patients who retain at least some light perception. Researchers have found that even minimal light exposure can synchronize the body clock.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zeitzer JM, Dijk DJ, Kronauer R, Brown E, Czeisler C |title=Sensitivity of the human circadian pacemaker to nocturnal light: melatonin phase resetting and suppression |journal=J.

Sighted people with Non-24 do exist, but are much more rare and the etiology of their circadian disorder is less well understood.<ref name="El-Ad"/> As of 2005, there were fewer than 100 cases of sighted people with N24 reported in the scientific literature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journalsleep.org/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=26193 |title=Clinical Analyses of Sighted Patients with Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Syndrome: A Study of 57 Consecutively Diagnosed Cases |accessdate=2009-08-04 |year=2005}}</ref> At least one case of a sighted person developing Non-24 was preceded by head injury;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boivin DB, James FO, Santo JB, Caliyurt O, Chalk C |title=Non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome following a car accident |journal=Neurology |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=1841–3 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12796546 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12796546}}</ref> another patient diagnosed with the disorder was later found to have a "large pituitary adenoma that involved the [[optic chiasma]]".<ref name="ICSD"/> Thus the problem appears to be neurological.

There have been several studies of sighted people with the disorder. McArthur et al. reported treating a sighted patient who "appeared to be subsensitive to bright light".<ref>{{cite journal |author=McArthur AJ, Lewy AJ, Sack RL |title=Non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome in a sighted man: circadian rhythm studies and efficacy of melatonin treatment |journal=Sleep |year=1996 |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=544–53 |pmid=8899933}}</ref> In other words, the brain does not react normally to light (people with the disorder may or may not, however, be [[photophobia|unusually ''subjectively'' sensitive to light]]; one study found that they were more sensitive than the control group.<ref name="Okawa2007" />) In 2002 Uchiyama et al. examined five sighted Non-24 patients who showed, during the study, a sleep-wake cycle averaging 25.12 hours.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Uchiyama M, Shibui K, Hayakawa T, Kamei Y, Ebisawa T, Tagaya H, Okawa M, Takahashi K |title=Larger phase angle between sleep propensity and melatonin rhythms in sighted humans with non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome |journal= Sleep |year=2002 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=83–88 |pmid=11833864}}</ref> That is appreciably longer than the 24.02-hour average shown by the control subjects in that study, which was near the average innate cycle for healthy adults, younger and older, of 24.18 hours.<ref name=hno>{{cite web |title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html |year=1999 |accessdate=2007-12-09 |unused_data=Charles A. Czeisler MD, PhD}}</ref> The literature usually refers to a "one to two hour" delay per 24-hour day (i.e. a 25–26 hour cycle).

Uchiyama et al. had earlier determined that sighted Non-24 patients' minimum core body temperature occurs much earlier in the sleep episode than the normal two hours before awakening. They suggest that the long interval between the temperature trough and awakening makes illumination upon awakening virtually ineffective,<ref>{{cite journal |author= Uchiyama M et al. |title=Altered phase relation between sleep timing and core body temperature rhythm in delayed sleep phase syndrome and non-24-hour sleep–wake syndrome in humans |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=294 |issue=2 |pages=101–104 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3940(00)01551-2 |pmid= 11058797}}</ref> as per the [[phase response curve]] (PRC) for light. 

In their Clinical Review in 2007, Okawa and Uchiyama reported that people with Non-24 have a mean habitual sleep duration of nine to ten hours and that their circadian periods average 24.8 hours.<ref name="Okawa2007">{{cite journal |author=Okawa M, Uchiyama M |title=Circadian rhythm sleep disorders: characteristics and entrainment pathology in delayed sleep phase and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=485–96 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17964201 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2007.08.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1087-0792(07)00102-5}} [http://www.chronobiology.ch/chronobiology.data/Dokumente/PDF/PDF_Chrono_Psychiatry/Okawa_07.pdf as PDF]</ref>

People with the disorder may have an especially hard time adjusting to changes in "regular" sleep-wake cycles, such as vacations, stress, evening activities, time changes like [[daylight saving time]], travel to different time zones, illness, medications (especially stimulants or sedatives), changes in daylight hours in different seasons, and [[growth spurts]], which are typically known to cause fatigue. They also show lowered sleep propensity after total sleep deprivation.<ref name="Okawa2007" />  

Most people with this disorder find that it severely impairs their ability to function socially and occupationally. Typically, they are "partially or totally unable to function in scheduled activities on a daily basis, and most are unable to work at conventional jobs".<ref name=ICSD>[[International Classification of Sleep Disorders]] Diagnostic and Coding Manual</ref> Attempts to keep conventional hours by people with the disorder generally result in [[insomnia]] (which is not a normal feature of the disorder itself) and excessive sleepiness,<ref name=ICSD/> to the point of falling into [[microsleep]]s, as well as myriad effects associated with acute and chronic [[sleep deprivation]].  People with Non-24 who force themselves to live on a normal workday "are not often successful and may develop physical and psychological complaints during waking hours, i.e. sleepiness, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, or depressed mood.  Patients often have difficulty maintaining ordinary social lives, and some of them lose their jobs or fail to attend school."<ref name="Okawa2007" />

The impact of Non-24 on daily life is affected by the extent to which the body clock drifts. For instance, a person with a 25-hour body clock would have a 25-day cycle with two weeks of good sleep and two weeks of poor sleep. But a person with a 24.1-hour circadian rhythm would drift only six minutes per day and take 241 days, or eight months, to go around the clock. They may have four months of good sleep and four months of bad sleep, when the cycle would begin again. 

The first report and description of a case of Non-24, a man living on 26-hour days, was "A man with too long a day" by Ann L. Eliott et al. in November 1970.<ref name="Billiard2003">{{cite book |last=Billiard |first=Michel |coauthors=Angela Kent |title=Sleep: Physiology, Investigations, and Medicine |url=http://books.google.com/?id=IorPrIY6dOYC&pg=PA505&lpg=PA505&dq=hypernychthemeral+syndrome&q=hypernychthemeral%20syndrome |format=Page view, Google books |accessdate=2009-11-08 |year=2003 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=0-306-47406-9 |pages=495–97, 502}}</ref> The related and more common [[delayed sleep phase syndrome|DSPS]] wasn't described until 1981.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms reported by patients forced into a 24-hour schedule are similar to those of [[sleep deprivation]] and can include:

* [[Cognitive dysfunction]]
* [[Confusion]]
* Diarrhea
* Extreme [[nausea]]
* Extreme [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]
* Hair loss
* Headaches
*[[Ideational apraxia]]
* [[Ideomotor apraxia]]
* Impaired [[Balance (ability)|balance]]
* Joint pain
* Kinetic apraxia
* Limb apraxia
* Loss of muscle coordination ([[ataxia]])
* Menstrual irregularities
* Muscle pain
* [[Suicidal thoughts]]
* [[Apraxia of speech|Verbal apraxia]]
* Weight gain

== Prevalence ==

While both sighted and blind people are diagnosed with Non-24, the disorder affects more totally blind individuals than sighted.

The European portal for rare diseases, [[Orphanet]], lists Non-24 as a rare disease by their definition: 1 person per 2,000 or more.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&data_id=11045&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseGroup=non-24&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseType=Pat&Disease(s)%20concerned=Hypernychthemeral-syndrome--Non-24-Hour-Sleep-Wake-syndrome-&title=Hypernychthemeral-syndrome--Non-24-Hour-Sleep-Wake-syndrome-&search=Disease_Search_Simple |title=Hypernychthemeral syndrome |accessdate= 2009-08-08 |author=Orphanet |year=2006 |month=April |publisher=Inserm: Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale }}</ref> There are about 140,000 sufferers of Non-24 in the [[European Union]]; a prevalence of approximately 0.03%, or 3 per 10,000.<ref name="UKMI">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmi.nhs.uk/applications/ndo/record_view_open.asp?newDrugID=5145 |title=New Drugs Online Report for tasimelteon |accessdate=2011-05-17 |publisher = UK Medicines Information, National Health Service}}</ref>

It has been estimated by researchers that of the 1.3 million blind people in the U.S.,<ref>National Federation of the Blind.

==Causes==

The etiology of Non-24 is unknown in sighted individuals.  However, [[chronotherapy]] has been known to cause it in humans.<ref name="NEJM1992">{{cite journal | last = Oren | first = Dan A. | coauthors = Thomas A.

In the blind without any light sensitivity, the brain is not cued to reset the circadian clock to a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.<ref name="AASM2008"/>

==Treatment==
[[Image:Sleep diary.jpg|thumb|225px| A '''sleep diary''' with nighttime in the middle and the weekend in the middle, to better notice trends]]
Common treatments for non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome are similar to those for [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]].<ref name="Okawa2007"/> They include [[light therapy]] with a full spectrum lamp giving—usually—10,000 [[lux]], [[hypnotics]] and/or [[stimulants]] (to promote sleep and wakefulness, respectively) and [[melatonin]] supplements. In any case, a [[sleep diary]] should be kept to aid in evaluation of treatment.

Light therapy has been shown useful in treating DSPS; effects on patients with Non-24 are less clear. Melatonin administration has been shown to be effective for mild cases of Non-24, particularly among the blind. It often takes several treatments before any progress is noticed, and for many the treatments may only be marginally effective or not effective at all. In addition, the treatment is not a cure, and the condition may only be managed.

Bright light therapy combined with the use of melatonin as a [[chronobiotic]] (as per the [[phase response curve|PRC]]) may be the most effective treatment. However the timing of both is tricky and a lot of determination and experimentation is usually required.

Currently, there is no treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Non-24 in blind people without light perception, though clinical studies are underway.

==Clinical research==
There are a number of clinical studies being conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of a new treatment called Tasimeltion, a melatonin agonist, which resets the internal clock in people with circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including Non-24.<ref>U.S. National Institutes of Health, [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=non-24-hour+sleep-wake+disorder Clinical Trials database].
