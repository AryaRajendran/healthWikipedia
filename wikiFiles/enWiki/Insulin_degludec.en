'''Insulin degludec''' is an ultralong-acting basal [[insulin analogue]] being developed by [[Novo Nordisk]] under the brand name '''Tresiba'''.<ref name=CHMP2012/>  It is administered via [[subcutaneous injection]]. It can be given daily or up to three-times a week to help control the [[blood sugar]] level of those with [[diabetes]]. It has a duration of action that lasts up to 40 hours, unlike the 18 to 26 hours provided by current marketed long-acting insulins such as [[insulin glargine]] and [[insulin detemir]].<ref name=dic>{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10023-good-news-for-novos-thrice-weekly-insulin&catid=1&Itemid=8|title=Good News for Novo's Thrice-Weekly Insulin|work=DiabetesInControl.com|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref name=businessweek>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-25/novo-s-degludec-insulin-as-effective-as-lantus-with-fewer-doses.html|title=Novo’s Degludec Insulin as Effective as Lantus With Fewer Doses|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|author=Schwartzkopff, Frances|date=2010-06-25|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

Insulin degludec is a modified insulin that has one single amino acid deleted in comparison to human insulin, and is conjugated to hexadecanedioic acid via gamma-L-glutamyl spacer at the amino acid [[lysine]] at position B29.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Insulin degludec is an ultra-long acting insulin that, unlike [[insulin glargine]], is active at a physiologic pH.  The addition of hexadecanedioic acid to lysine at the B29 position allows for the formation of multi-hexamers in subcutaneous tissues.<ref name="Degludec review">{{cite journal|last=Nasrallah|first=SN|coauthors=Reynolds, LR|title=Insulin Degludec, The New Generation Basal Insulin or Just another Basal Insulin?|journal=Clinical medicine insights.

===Pharmacodynamics===
Insulin degludec has an onset of action of 30-90 minutes (similar to [[insulin glargine]] and [[insulin detemir]]).  There is no peak in activity, due to the slow release into systemic circulation.  The duration of action of insulin degludec is reported as being longer than 24 hours.<ref name="Degludec review" /><ref name=systematicrev>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=F|coauthors=Surh, J; Kaur, M|title=Insulin degludec as an ultralong-acting basal insulin once a day: a systematic review.|journal=Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy|year=2012|volume=5|pages=191–204|pmid=22826637}}</ref> 
==Effectiveness profile==
Studies have shown that patients taking insulin degludec needed to take significantly smaller doses of [[basal rate|basal insulin]] than those taking insulin glargine, while achieving similar blood glucose levels.  Insulin degludec also has the ability to be mixed with other insulins, thereby improving [[glycemic control]]. This cannot be done using current long-acting insulins.<ref name=monograph>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&drugid=20805&drugname=Insulin+Glargine+SubQ&monotype=monograph&secid=3|title=Monograph - Insulin Glargine: Dosage & Administration|work=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref name=reuters>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE65P0DB20100626|work=[[Reuters]]|author=Ringstrom, Anna|title=Novo says degludec has potential to lower blood sugar|accessdate=2010-11-07|date=2010-06-26}}</ref> A physician involved in the trials was quoted as saying,

==Clinical trial data==
===Type 1 diabetes mellitus===
Insulin degludec was studied as an alternative to insulin glargine as part of a basal-bolus regimen in the BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1 trial.  629 patients with [[type 1 diabetes]] were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either insulin degludec (n=472) or insulin glargine (n=157) in addition to mealtime insulin aspart.  Patients in the degludec treatment arm were switched from their basal insulin to insulin degludec in a 1:1 ratio, with a 20-30% dose reduction in patients receiving multiple basal doses per day.  After 52 weeks, patients treated with insulin degludec produced a similar reduction in [[HbA1c]] (0.40% vs. 0.39%) meeting the criteria for noninferiority.  Adverse events were similar in the two treatment arms; however, rates of nocturnal [[hypoglycemia]] (between midnight and 6am) were 27% lower in patients treated with insulin degludec (3.91 vs. 5.22%,p=0.024).  The reduction in the incidence of hypoglycemia was seen as a therapeutic benefit, as hypoglycemia is often a dose limiting toxicity in insulin therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heller|first=S|coauthors=Buse, J; Fisher, M; Garg, S; Marre, M; Merker, L; Renard, E; Russell-Jones, D; Philotheou, A; Francisco, AM; Pei, H; Bode, B; BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1 Trial, Investigators|title=Insulin degludec, an ultra-longacting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal-bolus treatment with mealtime insulin aspart in type 1 diabetes (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1): a phase 3, randomised, open-label, treat-to-target non-inferiority trial.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Apr 21|volume=379|issue=9825|pages=1489–97|pmid=22521071}}</ref>

===Type 2 diabetes mellitus=== 
In the BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 2 trial, insulin degludec was studied as an alternative to insulin glargine in patients with [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]]. 995 patients were randomized to receive either insulin degludec (n=755) or insulin glargine (n=251), in addition to either mealtime insulin aspart, [[metformin]], and/or [[pioglitazone]].  Patients in this trial had an average HbA1c of 8.3-8.4%, and 49-50% were on a regimen consisting of basal-bolus insulin + oral antidiabetic medications.  After 52 weeks, insulin degludec was found to be noninferior to insulin glargine, providing a similar HbA1c lowering effect (-1.10 vs. -1.18%).  Overall rates of hypoglycemia were significantly lower with insulin degludec (11.09 vs. 13.63%/yr, p=0.0359), including cases of nocturnal hypoglycemia (1.39 vs. 1.84%/yr, p=0.0399).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garber|first=AJ|coauthors=King, AB; Del Prato, S; Sreenan, S; Balci, MK; Muñoz-Torres, M; Rosenstock, J; Endahl, LA; Francisco, AM; Hollander, P; NN1250-3582 (BEGIN BB T2D) Trial, Investigators|title=Insulin degludec, an ultra-longacting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal-bolus treatment with mealtime insulin aspart in type 2 diabetes (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 2): a phase 3, randomised, open-label, treat-to-target non-inferiority trial.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Apr 21|volume=379|issue=9825|pages=1498–507|pmid=22521072}}</ref>

==Side effects==
A significant side effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia.  A meta-analysis of clinical trails published in July 2012 found 39-47.9 events of hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose <56mg/dL) per patient year, with higher rates in the more concentrated degludec formulation.  Rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia ranged from 3.7-5.1 events per patient year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=F|coauthors=Surh, J; Kaur, M|title=Insulin degludec as an ultralong-acting basal insulin once a day: a systematic review.|journal=Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy|year=2012|volume=5|pages=191–204|pmid=22826637}}</ref>
