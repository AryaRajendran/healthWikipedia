Modes of mechanical ventilation has only had an established [[nomenclature of mechanical ventilation|nomenclature]] since 2008.<ref name="pmid19399015">{{cite journal| author=Donn SM| title=Neonatal ventilators: how do they differ? | journal=J Perinatol | year= 2009 | volume= 29 Suppl 2 | issue=  | pages= S73-8 | pmid=19399015 | doi=10.1038/jp.2009.23 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=19399015  }}</ref>  It is suggested that the modes categorized under the following sections be referred to as their section header instead of their individual name, which is often a brand name instead of the preferred nomenclature.<ref name="pmid19399015"/>

==Volume controlled continuous mandatory ventilation==
* [[Volume controlled continuous mandatory ventilation]] (VC-CMV - formerly known as assist control)

==Volume controlled intermittent mandatory ventilation==
* [[Synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation]] (SIMV)
* [[Mandatory minute ventilation]] (MMV)

==Pressure controlled continuous mandatory ventilation==
* [[Pressure controlled continuous mandatory ventilation]] (PC-CMV) formerly known as simply pressure control ventilation.

==Pressure controlled intermittent mandatory ventilation==
* [[Airway pressure release ventilation]] (APRV)
* [[Pressure regulated volume control]] (PRVC)
* [[Proportional assist ventilation]] (PAV)
* [[Adaptive support ventilation]] (ASV)

==Continuous spontaneous ventilation==
* [[Continuous positive pressure ventilation]] (CPPV or sometimes C<sub>pap</sub>.)
* [[Bilevel positive pressure ventilation]] (BPAP or sometimes, though unrecommended "BiPap".)

==Strategies of mechanical ventilation==
''Strategies are not [[modes of mechanical ventilation]] but are instead strategies for using modes.''
* [[Inverse ratio ventilation]]
* [[Open lung ventilation]]
