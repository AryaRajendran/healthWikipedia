In the United States, '''copayment''' or '''copay''' is a payment defined in the [[insurance policy]] and paid by the insured person each time a medical service is accessed. It is technically a form of [[coinsurance]], but is defined differently in health insurance where a coinsurance is a percentage payment after the deductible up to a certain limit. It must be paid before any policy benefit is payable by an insurance company. Copayments do not usually contribute towards any policy out-of-pocket maxima whereas coinsurance payments do.<ref>University of Puget Sound. [http://www2.ups.edu/humanresources/2006_benefits/Benefits2006-FAQ.htm#co-payments Benefits update. 2006 medical plan frequently asked questions. What is the difference between co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles?] Retrieved November 10, 2008.</ref> 

[[Insurance]] companies use copayments to share health care costs to prevent [[moral hazard]].  Though the copay is often a small portion of the actual cost of the medical service, it is meant to prevent people from seeking medical care that may not be necessary (e.g.: an infection by the [[common cold]]). The underlying philosophy is that with no copay, people will consume much more care than they otherwise would if they were paying for all or some of it. In health systems with prices below the market-clearing level in which waiting lists act as rationing tools,<ref>Lindsay, Cotton M. and Bernard Feigenbaum (1984) [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1804016 'Rationing by waiting lists'], American Economic Review 74(3): 404-17.</ref> copayment can serve to reduce the welfare cost of such waiting lists.<ref>Diego Varela and Anca Timofte (2011), [http://www.seap.usv.ro/annals/ojs/index.php/annals/article/view/364 'The social cost of hospital waiting lists and the case for copayment: Evidence from Galicia'], The USV Annals of Economics and Public Administration 11(1): 18-26.</ref>

However, a copay may also discourage people from seeking necessary medical care and higher copays may result in non-use of essential medical services and prescriptions, thus rendering someone who is insured effectively uninsured because they are unable to pay higher copays. If the insured cannot afford the copay, they effectively have no insurance (high copays can cause a false sense of security). Thus there is a balance to be achieved: a high enough copay to deter unneeded expenses but low enough to not render the insurance useless.

==Prescription drugs==
Some insurance companies set the copay percentage for non-generic drugs higher than for generic drugs. Occasionally if a non-generic drug is reduced in price insurers will agree to classify it as generic for copayment purposes (as occurred with [[simvastatin#Sales|simvastatin]]).  Pharmaceutical companies have a very long term (frequently 20 years or longer) lock on a drug as a brand name drug which for [[patent]] reasons cannot be produced as a generic drug. 

To cushion the high copay costs of brand name drugs, some pharmaceutical companies offer [[drug coupons]] or temporary subsidized copayment reduction programs lasting from two months to twelve months. Thereafter, if a patient is still taking the brand name medication, the pharmaceutical companies might remove the option and require full payments. If no similar drug is available, the patient is "locked in" to either using the drug with the high copays, or a patient takes no drugs and lives with the consequences of non-treatment.

==Observed effects==
Medication copayments have also been associated with reduced use of necessary and appropriate medications for chronic conditions such as chronic [[heart failure]],<ref>Cole JA, et al.
