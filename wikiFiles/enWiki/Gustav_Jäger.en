'''Gustav Jäger''' (June 23, 1832 – May 13, 1917) was a [[Germany|German]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[hygienist]].

==Biography==
He was born at the historic Pfarrhaus in the village of [[Neuenstadt am Kocher|Bürg, Neuenstadt am Kocher]] in [[Württemberg]]. After studying [[medicine]] at [[Tübingen]], he became a teacher of [[zoology]] at [[Vienna]]. In 1868, he was appointed professor of zoology at the academy of [[Hohenheim]], and subsequently he became teacher of zoology and [[anthropology]] at [[Stuttgart]] polytechnic and professor of physiology at the [[veterinary]] school. In 1884 he abandoned teaching and started practice as a physician in Stuttgart. He wrote various works on biological subjects, including ''Die Darwinsche Theorie und ihre Stellung zu Moral und Religion'' (1869), ''Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Zoologie'' (1871–1878).

In 1876, he suggested a hypothesis in explanation of [[heredity]], resembling the [[germ plasm]] theory subsequently elaborated by [[August Weismann]], to the effect that the germinal [[protoplasm]] retains its specific properties from generation to generation, dividing in each reproduction into an ontogenetic portion, out of which the individual is built up, and a phylogenetic portion, which is reserved to form the reproductive material of the mature offspring.

In ''Die Entdeckung der Seele''<ref>Jäger, Gustav. Die Entdeckung der Seele. Republished as CD-ROM by Grönbeck Verlag, 2007. ISBN 3-9808420-2-9</ref> ("The Discovery of The Soul", 1878) Jäger advanced the first crude version of the [[pheromone]] concept. His postulated skin "anthropines," popularly dubbed "lust compounds," came astoundingly close to reality but the idea was too far ahead of the possibilities of chemistry and the life sciences at this time to be corroborated by experiments.

The system of clothing associated with his name originates from ''Die Normalkleidung als Gesundheitsschutz'' ("Standardized Apparel For Health Protection", 1880), wherein he advocated the wearing of rough fabrics such as wool "close to the skin", objecting especially to the use of any kind of plant fibre. The teachings of Jäger inspired the creation of the [[Jaeger (clothing retailer)|Jaeger clothing brand]].

He also was a very active [[entomologist]] specialising in [[beetles]]  particularly [[Buprestidae]] and [[Scarabaeidae]]. He wrote with [[Carl Gustav Calwer]] ''Käferbuch-Naturgeschichte der Käfer Europas'' (''Beetle Book: Natural History of Europe's Beetles''). This very popular work was successively reprinted until 1916. His beetle collection is in Stuttgart Natural History Museum.<ref>[http://www.naturkundemuseum-bw.de/ Staatliche Museen für Naturkunde Baden-Württemberg<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.naturkundemuseum-bw.de</ref>
