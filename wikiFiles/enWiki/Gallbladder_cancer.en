'''Gallbladder cancer''' is a relatively uncommon [[cancer]].  It has peculiar geographical distribution being common in central and South America, central and eastern Europe, Japan and northern India; it is also common in certain ethnic groups e.g. Native American Indians and Hispanics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kapoor VK, McMichael AJ |title=Gallbladder cancer: an 'Indian' disease |journal=Natl Med J India |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=209–13 |year=2003 |pmid=14606770 }}</ref> If it is diagnosed early enough, it can be cured by removing the [[gallbladder]], part of the liver and associated lymph nodes.  Most often it is found after [[symptoms]] such as [[abdominal]] pain, [[jaundice]] and vomiting occur, and it has spread to other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s such as the [[liver]]. The incidence of gall bladder cancer is alarmingly increasing in China<ref name="cn">{{cite journal |author=Hsing AW, Gao YT, Han TQ, ''et al.'' |title=Gallstones and the risk of biliary tract cancer: a population-based study in China |journal=Br.

According to Reinier DImalanta, it is a rare cancer that is still being studied and thought to be related to gallstones building up, which also can lead to [[calcium|calcification]] of the gallbladder, a condition known as [[Porcelain gallbladder]].  Porcelain gallbladder is also rare. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this. The outlook is poor for recovery if the cancer is found after symptoms have started to occur (being the 5-year survival rate close to 3%)

==Risk factors==
[[Image:Gallbladder adenocarcinoma (2) histopathology.jpg|thumb|right|Gallbladder [[adenocarcinoma]]  [[histopathology]]]]
* Gender: Approx. twice more common in women than men,  mostly between the ages of 50 and 60.
* [[Obesity]] increases the risk for gallbladder cancer.  
* Primary carcinoma is linked to chronic [[cholecystitis]] and [[cholelithiasis]].
* Various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with gallbladder cancer. However, existing genetic studies in GBC susceptibility have so far been insufficient to confirm any association.<ref>Srivastava K, Srivastava A, Sharma KL, Mittal B. Candidate gene studies in gallbladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Mutat Res. 2011 Jul-Oct;728(1-2):67-79. </ref>

==Signs and Symptoms==

*Steady pain in the upper right abdomen
*[[Weakness (medical)|Weakness]]
*[[Loss of appetite]]
*[[Weight loss]]
*[[Jaundice]] and [[vomiting]] due to obstruction

Early symptoms mimic gallbladder inflammation due to gallstones.  Later, the symptoms may be that of [[bile duct|biliary]] and stomach obstruction.

==Epidemiology==
*Rare tumor, the U.S. incidence is 3:100000 / year
*Gallbladder cancer is more common in some countries, including South American countries, Japan and Israel. In Chile gallbladder cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths.
*5th most common gastrointestinal cancer
*Up to 5 times more common in women than men depending on population (e.g 73% female in <ref name="cn"/>)

==Disease Course==
Most tumors are [[adenocarcinoma]]s, with a small percent being [[squamous cell]] carcinomas.  The cancer commonly spreads to the [[liver]], bile duct, [[stomach]], and [[duodenum]].

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Gallbladder adenocarcinoma (1) histopathology.jpg|thumb|right|Incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer ([[adenocarcinoma]]) following a [[cholecystectomy]].  [[H&E stain]].]]
Early diagnosis is not generally possible.  People at high risk, such as women or Native Americans with gallstones, are evaluated closely.  Transabdominal [[ultrasound]], [[CT scan]], endoscopic [[ultrasound]], [[MRI]], and MR cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) can be used for diagnosis. A biopsy is the only certain way to tell whether the tumorous growth is malignant or not.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tests for gallbladder cancer|url=http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/gallbladder-cancer/diagnosis/tests-for-gallbladder-cancer|publisher=Cancer Research UK|accessdate=17 September 2012}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The most common and most effective treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder ([[cholecystectomy]]) with part of liver and [[lymph node]] dissection. However, with gallbladder cancer's extremely poor prognosis, most patients will die by one year following the surgery.  If surgery is not possible, endoscopic stenting of the biliary tree can reduce jaundice and a stent in stomach may relieve vomiting.  [[Chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy|radiation]] may also be used with surgery. If gall bladder cancer is diagnosed after cholecystectomy for stone disease (incidental cancer), reoperation to remove part of liver and lymph nodes is required in most cases. When it is done as early as possible, patients have the best chance of long term survival and even cure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kapoor VK |title=Incidental gallbladder cancer |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=627–9 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11280526 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2001.03597.x }}</ref>
