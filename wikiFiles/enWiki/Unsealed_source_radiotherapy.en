'''Unsealed source radiotherapy''' relates to the use of [[solubility|soluble]] forms of [[radioactivity|radioactive]] substances which are administered to the body by [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] or [[Eating|ingestion]]. Such substances are typically used for their biological properties, which are similar to their non-radioactive parent substance.

Sealed-source therapy, in which the radioisotope remains in a capsule or metal wire during therapy and is never allowed to dissolve in fluids, is usually referred to as [[brachytherapy]]

A review of the subject was published in 1999 by Wynn A. Volkert and Timothy J. Hoffman.<ref>Wynn A. Volkert and Timothy J. Hoffman, ''Therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals'', Chemical Reviews 99(9) (1999); 2269â€“2292</ref>

==Iodine==
For example, [[iodine]] is an element selectively taken up by the [[Thyroid|thyroid gland]] in healthy people. Thyroid disease (both benign conditions like [[thyrotoxicosis]] and malignant conditions like papillary [[thyroid cancer]]) can be treated with [[radioiodine|radioactive iodine]] (iodine-131) which is then concentrated into the thyroid. Iodine-131 produces [[beta particle|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]] radiation. The beta radiation released destroys thyroid tissue, and any thyroid cancer that takes up iodine whilst most of the gamma radiation escapes the patient's body. 

Most of the iodine not taken up by thyroid tissue is [[excretion|excreted]] through the [[kidney]]s into the [[urine]]. After radioactive iodine treatment, the urine will be radioactive or 'hot', and the patients themselves will also emit [[gamma radiation]]. Depending on the amount of radioactivity administered, it can take days to weeks for the radioactivity to reduce to the point where the patient is not a radiation danger to bystanders. There are strict [[radiation protection]] regulations governing the use of these sources.

==Experimental antibody based methods - alpha emitters==

At the ITU work is being done on Alpha-Immunotherapy, this is an experimental method where antibodies bearing [[alpha radiation|alpha]] isotopes are used. [[Bismuth]]-213 is one of the isotopes which has been used. This is made by the alpha decay of Ac-225. The generation of one short-lived isotope from longer lived isotope is a useful method of providing a portable supply of a short-lived isotope. This is similar to the generation of [[technetium]]-99m by a [[technetium cow]]. The [[actinium]]-225 is made by the irradiation of [[radium]]-226 with a [[cyclotron]].
