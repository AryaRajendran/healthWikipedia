'''John E. Fryer''', [[M.D.]] (November 7, 1938 – February 21, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[gay rights]] activist best known for his [[Anonymity|anonymous]] speech at the 1972 [[American Psychiatric Association]] annual conference where he appeared in disguise and under the name '''Dr H. Anonymous'''. This event has been cited as a key factor in the decision to de-list [[homosexuality]] as a [[mental illness]] from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The American Psychiatric Association ''John E. Fryer, M.D., Award'' is named in his honor. <ref name="moran2006">Moran, Mark (November 3, 2006).

== Early life ==
Fryer was born in [[Kentucky]] and completed his medical studies at [[Transylvania College]] and [[Vanderbilt University]]. He joined the medical faculty at [[Temple University]] in 1967 and was made both a [[professor]] of psychiatry, and a professor of family and community medicine. He was involved in setting up Physicians in Transition, Temple's Family Life Development Center, and the Philadelphia AIDS Task Force.

==1972 speech==
[[Image:Gittings Kameny Fryer.jpg|thumb|[[Barbara Gittings]], [[Franklin Kameny]] and John E. Fryer as "Dr. H. Anonymous" at a 1972 dialogue discussing [[psychiatry]] and [[homosexuality]].]]

At a time when homosexuality was still listed as a mental illness, Fryer was the first gay American psychiatrist to speak publicly about his sexuality. A year earlier, at the 1971 convention in Washington, gay activist [[Franklin E. Kameny]] had seized the microphone at the conference as part of a long-standing protest about the diagnosis of homosexuality, initiating the first gay-rights protest at an [[American Psychiatric Association]] conference.

This protest led to a session at the 1972 conference on homosexuality and mental illness entitled 'Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue' with Kameny sitting on the panel. Listed only as Dr H. Anonymous, Fryer appeared on stage wearing a face mask, [[Wig (hair)|wig]], [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]] and spoke through a microphone which distorted his voice.

Dr Fryer's speech started with the words "I am a homosexual. I am a psychiatrist" and continued to describe the lives of the many gay psychiatrists among the [[American Psychiatric Association]] who had to hide their sexuality from their colleagues for fear of discrimination, and from fellow homosexuals owing to the disdain in which the psychiatric profession was held among the gay community. Fryer's speech also suggested ways in which gay psychiatrists could subtly and 'creatively' challenge prejudice in their profession without disclosing their sexuality, and help gay patients adjust to a society that considered their sexual preferences a sign of [[psychopathology]].

Homosexuality was removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] a year later, and Fryer's speech has been cited as a key factor in persuading the psychiatric community to reach this decision.<ref name="scatsa2002">Scasta DL (2002).

== Later life and death ==

Fryer was awarded a Distinguished Service Award from the Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists.

Fryer was being treated for [[diabetes]] and [[pulmonary sarcoidosis]], and eventually died from [[gastrointestinal]] bleeding.<ref name="latobit">Staff report (March 08, 2003).
