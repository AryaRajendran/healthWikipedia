The '''National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act''' (NCVIA) of 1986 (42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa-1 to 300aa-34) was enacted in the [[United States]] to reduce the potential financial liability of [[vaccine]] makers due to [[vaccine injury]] claims.  The legislation was aimed at ensuring a stable market supply, and to provide cost-effective [[arbitration]] for vaccine injury claims.  Under the NCVIA, the [[National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program]] (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] and [[special master]]s.

==NCVIA provisions==
===Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System===
   
The NCVIA also mandates that all health care providers must report certain [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse events]] following vaccination to the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS).

The NCVIA also established a committee from the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) to review the existing literature on vaccine adverse events  occurring after [[immunization]], regardless of whether there was a direct link between events.

===National Vaccine Program Office===

As a result of the NCVIA, the [[National Vaccine Program Office]] (NVPO) was established within the DHHS.  The NVPO is responsible for coordinating immunization-related activities between all DHHS agencies, including the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA).

===Vaccine Information Statements===
   
The NCVIA requires all health care providers who administer vaccines containing [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]], [[polio]], [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[hepatitis B]], [[Haemophilus influenzae]] type b and [[varicella]] must provide a [[Vaccine Information Statement]] (VIS) to the vaccine recipient, their parent or legal guardian prior to each dose.

A VIS must be given with every vaccination, including each dose in a multi-dose series.  Each VIS contains a brief description of the disease, as well as the [[risk]]s and [[Cost-benefit analysis|benefit]]s of the vaccine.  Each VIS is developed by the CDC and distributed to state and local health departments as well as individual providers.
