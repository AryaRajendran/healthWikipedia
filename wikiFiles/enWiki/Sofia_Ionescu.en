==Early life==
Ionescu was born in [[Fălticeni]], [[Suceava]], daughter of Constantin Ogrezeanu and Maria Ogrezeanu. She only weighed 2.2&nbsp;lb at birth, and had unusually long fingers that helped her through her career{{clarify|date=February 2012}}.  Her father wanted her to be young lady and [[housewife]].

Ionescu's interest in medicine began after she met one of her best friends Aurelia Dumitru, and her father Dr. Dumitru.  The death of one of her school friends, who died in [[Paris]] due to an [[infection]] after brain surgery, impelled Ionescu to apply to medical school.

==Education==
Supported by her mother, she applied to medical school in [[Bucharest]] in 1939. In her first internship year, she studied [[ophthalmology]]. Another year, she spent in Suceava at a poorly-equipped clinic during a [[typhus]] [[epidemic]]. In one of the school breaks she volunteered to take care of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] prisoners at Stamate Hospital in Fălticeni, her home-town. She entered the surgical service of the hospital, doing her first surgical operations, mostly [[amputation]]s.

On 15 October 1943, when she became an intern at Hospital Nr. 9 in Bucharest. In the neurological clinic established by Dr. Bagdasar, she would meet Ionel Ionescu, who later became her husband.

==Career==
She was a neurosurgeon for 47 years at Hospital Nr. 9, forming an extraordinary team with Ionel Ionescu, and Constantin Arseni, under the guidance of [[Dimitrie Bagdasar]]. They formed the first neurological team of Romania, later called “The golden team”, which helped develop neurosurgery in Romania. 

In 1970, the favorite wife of the [[Sheikh]] of [[Abu Dhabi]] had become ill. As a man could not enter the harem, they needed to find a female doctor. Ionescu stayed one week at the woman’s side and cured her. As a reward the sheik gave her 2,000 dollars <ref name=interview>{{cite web|title=Interview with Sofia Ionescu-Ogrezeanu|url=http://www.eugeniavoda.ro/ro/emisiuni/medicina/dr-sofia-ionescu|publisher=TVR}}</ref>  and an expensive piece of jewelry. The money she had to give to the state and the jewelry was lost by her daughter.
