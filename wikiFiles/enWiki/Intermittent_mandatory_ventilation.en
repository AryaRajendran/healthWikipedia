'''Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation''' ('''IMV''') refers to any [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] where a regular series of breaths are scheduled but the ventilator senses patient effort and reschedules mandatory breaths based on the calculated need of the patient.  Similar to [[continuous mandatory ventilation]] in parameters set for the patients pressures and volumes but distinct in its ability to support a patient by either supporting their own effort or providing support when patient effort is not sensed.  IMV is frequently paired with additional strategies to improve weaning from ventilator support or to improve cardiovascular stability in patients who may need full [[life support]].

== Synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV) ==
Synchronized Intermittent Mechanical Ventilation is a variation of IMV, in which the ventilator breaths are synchronized with patient inspiratory effort.<ref>Sassoon CS, Del Rosario N, Fei R, et al.

== Mandatory minute ventilation (MMV) ==
Mandatory minute ventilation is a mode which requires the operator to determine what the appropriate minute ventilation for the patient should be, and the ventilator then monitors the patient's ability to generate this volume every 7.5 seconds. If the calculation suggests the volume target will not be met, SIMV breaths are delivered at the targeted volume to achieve the desired minute ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = [[Scott O. Guthrie]], [[Chris Lynn]], [[Bonnie J. Lafleur]], [[Steven M. Donn]] & [[William F. Walsh]]  | title = A crossover analysis of mandatory minute ventilation compared to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation in neonates  | journal = [[Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association]] | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 643–646 | year = 2005 | month = October | doi = 10.1038/sj.jp.7211371 | pmid = 16079905}}</ref>  Allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient’s preset minimum minute volume requirement. If the patient maintains the minute volume settings for VT x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered. If the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved.  The method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) is different per ventilator brand and model, but generally there is a window of time being monitored and a smaller window being checked against that larger window (i.e., in the Dräger Evita® line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured against to make a decision for if a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation).  MMV is the most optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long term complications related to mechanical ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = [[Scott O. Guthrie]], [[Chris Lynn]], [[Bonnie J. Lafleur]], [[Steven M. Donn]] & [[William F.

== Proportional Assist Ventilation (PAV) ==
Proportional assist ventilation is a mode in which the ventilator guarantees the percentage of work regardless of changes in [[pulmonary compliance]] and resistance.<ref>Younes M. Proportional assist ventilation, a new approach to ventilatory support. Theory. Am Rev Respir Dis 1992; 145(1):114-120. 
</ref> The ventilator varies the tidal volume and pressure based on the patients work of breathing, the amount it delivers is proportional to the percentage of assistance it is set to give.

==Adaptive Support Ventilation ==	
Adaptive Support Ventilation is a positive pressure [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] that is closed-loop controlled. In this mode, the frequency and tidal volume of breaths of a patient on the ventilator are automatically adjusted based on the patient’s requirements. The lung mechanics data are used to adjust the depth and rate of breaths to minimize the work rate of breathing. In the ASV mode, every breath is synchronized with patient effort if such an effort exists, and otherwise, full mechanical ventilation is provided to the patient.

ASV is a patented technology originally described as one of the embodiments of US Patent No. 4986268.<ref>Tehrani, Fleur T., “Method and Apparatus for Controlling an Artificial Resirator,” US Patent No. 4986268, issued Jan. 22, 1991.</ref> In this invention, the control algorithm computes the optimal rate of respiration to minimize the work rate of breathing. The rationale is to make the patient's breathing pattern comfortable and natural within safe limits, and thereby stimulate spontaneous breathing and reduce the weaning time.
