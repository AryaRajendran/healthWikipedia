The '''Christian Medical Fellowship''' (CMF), founded in 1949, is an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[interdenominational]] organisation that links together [[Christian]] [[Physician|doctors]] and [[medical student]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK).

CMFs stated aims are "uniting Christian doctors", "supporting Christian medical students", "advancing Christian mission", "publishing Christian literature" and "promoting Christian values". The organisation publishes two [[Magazine|journals]], ''Triple Helix'' (for doctors) and ''Nucleus'' (for students), several smaller publications, and some books. CMF organises [[Meeting|conferences]] on a local and national basis and promotes and supports Christian medical mission overseas.

CMF is linked to similar organisations in many countries through the [[International Christian Medical and Dental Association]] and the [[Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship]] for its [[medical student]]s.

==Medical ethics==
CMF regularly contributes to debate on issues of [[medical ethics]], such as making submissions to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[House of Lords]] enquiry into [[physician-assisted suicide]], and generally promotes the [[Pro-Life]] case in ethical debates, including topics on [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]]. In some of these activities, CMF works together with other faith-based and non-faith-based groups, such as the [[Care Not Killing Alliance]] and the [[Lawyers' Christian Fellowship]].

The position of the Christian Medical Fellowship has been to actively encourage doctors and medical students to use opportunites arising from the [[doctor-patient relationship]] to discuss faith with patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmf.org.uk/literature/content.asp?context=article&id=1296|title=Converting patients|publisher=www.cmf.org.uk}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The Christian Medical Fellowship has been the subject of complaint from several [[Hindu]] leaders to the [[House of Lords]] Select Committee on Religious Offences objecting to a claim that [[Hinduism]] was a 'false religion.'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hvk.org/articles/0703/181.html|title=Hindu leaders seek clarification from Earl of Mar|publisher=www.hvk.org|accessdate= 2009-07-23}}</ref>

In October 2007, the Christian Medical Fellowship was accused by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of attempting to skew the balance of evidence presented at the Parliamentary review of the UK's laws on abortion due to a number of its members presenting evidence at the Parliamentary Select Committee without revealing their membership and seniority within the organisation. The members concerned stated that they were submitting evidence as individuals, not as representatives of CMF, and they declared their affiliation when asked to do so in an unusual step by the Committee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/oct/15/sciencenews.medicineandhealth|title=Abortion inquiry asks scientists to disclose links to faith groups|publisher=www.guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2009-07-23 | location=London | first=James | last=Randerson | date=2007-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/oct/30/health.homeaffairs|title=Experts who testified to MPs failed to reveal abortion links|publisher=www.guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2009-07-23 | location=London | first=James | last=Randerson | date=2007-10-30}}</ref>
