'''Paratubal cysts''' (PTCs) and '''paraovarian cysts''' are [[epithelium]]-lined fluid-filled [[cyst]]s in the [[adnexa of uterus|adnexa]] adjacent to the [[fallopian tube]] and  [[ovary]]. The terms are used interchangeably.<ref name=kiseli>{{cite journal |author=Kiseli M, Caglar GS, Cengiz SD, Karadag D, Yilmaz MB| title=Clinical diagnosis and complications of paratubal cysts: Review of the literature and report of uncommon cases. |journal=Arch Gynecol Obstet 2012; 285:1563-69| doi=| pmid= }}</ref>

==Etiology==
PTCs originate from the [[mesothelium]] and are presumed to be remnants of the [[Mullerian duct]] and [[Wolffian duct]].<ref name=kiseli/>

==Frequency==
PTCs have been reported in all female age groups and seem to be most common in the third to fifth decades of life.<ref name=kiseli/><ref>{{cite journal| author=Damle F, Gomez-Lobo V |title=Giant paraovarian cysts in young adolescants: a report of three cases. |journal=J Reprod Med 2012; 57:65-7|pmid=}}</ref> A study in Italy estimated their incidence to be about 3%,<ref name=kiseli/> while an autopsy study of postmenopausal women detected them in about 4% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dorum A, Blom GP, Ekerhovd E, Granberg S |title=Prevalence and histologic of adnexal cysts in postmenopausal women: an autopsy study |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol 2005; 192:48-54 |pmid=15672002}}</ref>

These cysts  constitute about 10% of adnexal masses.<ref name=barloon>{{cite journal |author=Barloon TJ, Brown BP, Abu-Yousef MM, Warnock NG |title=Paraovarian and paratubal cysts: preoperative diagnosis using transabdominal and transvaginal sonography.|journal=J Clin Ultrasound 1966; 24: 117-22 |doi= |pmid=8838299}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Most cysts are small and asymptomatic.<ref name=kiseli/> Typical sizes reported are 1 to 8 cm in diameter.<ref name=kiseli/> PCTs may be found at surgery or during an imaging examination that is performed for another reason. Larger lesions may reach 20 or more cm in diameter and become symptomatic exerting pressure and pain symptoms in the lower abdomen.<ref name=varras>{{cite journal |author=Varras M, Akrivis C, Polyzos D, Frakala S, Samara C| title=A voluminous twisted paraovarian cyst in a 74-year-old patient: case report and review of the literature |journal= Clin Exp Obstet Gynecol 2003; 30: 253-6| pmid=14664426}}</ref>  Large cysts can lead to [[Ovarian torsion|torsion]] of the adnexae inflicting acute pain.<ref name=varras/><ref>{{cite journal| author=Thakore SS, Chun MJ, Fitzpatrick K |title=Recurrent ovarian torsion due to paratubal cysts in an adolescent female |journal=J Pediatr Adolesc Gynecol 2012 25;e85-7 |doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2011.10.012.| pmid=22840942}}</ref> 

Prior to surgery, PTCs are usually seen on [[ultrasonography]]. However, because of the proximity of the ovary that may display follicle cysts, it may be a challenge to identify a cyst as paratubal or paraovarian.<ref name=barloon/>

==Malignancy==
PTC are generally benign, but may, on rare occasions, give rise to [[borderline tumor]]s and malignancies.<ref name=suzuki>{{cite journal |author=Suzuki S, Furukawa H, Kyozuka H, Watanabe T, Takahashi H, Fujimori K |title=Two cases of paraovarian tumor of borderline malignancy |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Res 2013; 39:437-41 |doi=10.1111/j.1447-0756.2012.01953.x.| pmid=22889349}}</ref>  

==Management==
Smaller lesions can be followed expectantly. Larger lesions, lesions that are growing or symptomatic, and lesions with sonographically suspicious findings (septation, papillations, fluid and solid components) are generally surgically explored and removed.

==Hydatid cysts of Morgagni==
'''Hydatid cysts of Morgagni''', also '''hydatids of Morgagni''' or '''Morgagni's cysts''', are common and appear as pedunculated, often tiny, frequently multiple cysts connected to the fimbriae of the fallopian tubes. They thus appear to be a specific variant of paratubal cysts. They are named after [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]].

While usually asymptomatic, it has been noted that these cysts tend to be more common in women with [[unexplained infertility]] (52.1% versus 25.6% in controls, p<0.001) and suggested that they may play a role in infertility.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rasheed SM, Abdelmonem AM |title=Hydatid of Morgagni: a possible underestimated cause of unexplained infertility |journal=Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol 2011; 158:62-6| pmid=21620555}}</ref> It has been proposed that these cysts interfere with tubal pick-up and function.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Abd-el-Maeboud KH | title=Hydatid cyst of Morgagni: any impact on fertility? | journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Res 1997; 23:427-31|  pmid=9392907}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Cebesoy FB, Kutlar I, Dikensoy E, Yazicioglu C, Lalayci H | title=Morgagni hydatids: a new factor in infertility?|  journal=Arch Gynecol Obstet 2010; 28:1015-7|  pmid=19774388}}</ref>
