'''Stargardt disease''', or '''fundus flavimaculatus''', is an [[Heredity|inherited]] form of juvenile [[macular degeneration]] that causes progressive [[vision loss]] usually to the point of [[legal blindness]].  The progression usually starts between the ages of six and twelve years old and plateaus shortly after rapid reduction in visual acuity.  Several genes are associated with the disorder.  Symptoms typically develop by twenty years of age, and include wavy vision, blind spots, blurriness, impaired color vision, and difficulty adapting to dim lighting.  

==Genetics==
Stargardt disease is associated with several different genes:
* STGD1: The most common form of Stargardt disease is the [[recessive]] form caused by mutations in the [[ABCA4]] gene. It can also be associated with [[CNGB3]].
* STGD3: There is also a rare [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] form of Stargardt disease caused by mutations in the [[ELOVL4]] gene.
* STGD4: Associated with [[PROM1]].

The classification "STGD2" is no longer used.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptom of Stargardt disease is loss of visual acuity, which ranges from 20/50 to 20/200.<ref name=Yanoff/>  Those with Stargardt disease are sensitive to glare; overcast days offer some relief. Vision is most noticeably impaired when the macula (center of retina and focus of vision) is damaged, leaving peripheral vision more intact. Symptoms usually appear before age 20.  Symptoms include wavy vision, blind spots, blurriness, impaired color vision, and difficulty adapting to dim lighting.<ref name=mdsupport/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowvision.org/stargardts.htm |title=Stargardt's |publisher=Lowvision.org |date=1997-03-03 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>

==Treatment==
No treatments are available for Stargardt's disease.<ref name=Yanoff />  Many patients use magnifiers to help them see, and wear sunglasses to slow the development.<ref>[http://www.mdsupport.org/library/stargardt2.html Stargardt's Disease: Information for Patients and Their Families]</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The genetic defect is manifest in the [[visual phototransduction]] cycle. The [[ATP-binding cassette transporter]] is defective and leads to a build up of a toxic metabolite [[lipofuscin]] in the [[retinal pigmented epithelium]]. 

The form of Stargardt's disease that involves a butterfly pattern of [[dystrophy]] is caused by a mutation in a gene that codes a membrane bound protein that is involved in the elongation of [[very long chain fatty acid]]s ([[ELOVL4]]).

==History==
The disease was discovered in 1909 by [[Karl Stargardt]], an [[ophthalmologist]] in [[Berlin]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2306}}</ref><ref>K. B. Stargardt. Über familiäre, progressive Degeneration in der Makulagegend des Auges. Albrecht von Graefes Archiv für Ophthalmologie, 1909, 71: 534-550.</ref>

In 1997, it was discovered that mutations in the {{Gene|ABCA4}} gene cause Stargardt.  The mutations cause the production of a dysfunctional protein that cannot perform energy transport to and from photoreceptor cells in the retina.  The photoreceptor cells then degenerate, causing vision loss.<ref name=mdsupport />

==Epidemiology==
Stargardt disease is the most common form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration.<ref name=mdsupport>[http://www.mdsupport.org/library/stargrdt.html Stargardt Disease]</ref>

==Prognosis==
The long-term prognosis for patients with Stargardt disease is widely variable.<ref name=Yanoff>{{cite book|last1=Yanoff|first1=Myron|last2=Duker|first2=Jay S.|title=Ophthalmology|year=2008|publisher=Mosby|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0323057516|pages=560-562|edition=3rd|ref=harv}}</ref>

==Research==
On November 22, 2010, it was announced that Advanced Cell Technology<ref>{{cite web|title=Advanced Cell Technology Receives FDA Clearance For the First Clinical Trial Using Embryonic Stem Cells to Treat Macular Degeneration|url=http://www.advancedcell.com/news-and-media/press-releases/advanced-cell-technology-receives-fda-clearance-for-the-first-clinical-trial-using-embryonic-stem-cel/|publisher=Advanced Cell Technology}}</ref> received United States Food and Drug Administration clearance to immediately initiate a Phase I/II multicenter clinical trial using retinal cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to treat patients with Stargardt’s Macular Dystrophy.
