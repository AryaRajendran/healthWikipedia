'''Blepharitis''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|l|ɛ|f|ər|ˈ|aɪ|t|ɨ|s}} {{respell|BLEF|ər|EYE|tis}}) is an eye condition characterized by chronic [[inflammation]] of the [[eyelid]], the severity and time course of which can vary. Onset can be acute, resolving without treatment within 2–4 weeks (this can be greatly reduced with lid hygiene), but more generally is a long standing inflammation varying in severity. It may be classified as seborrhoeic, staphylococcal, mixed, posterior or meiobomitis, or parasitic.<ref name=vaughan />

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms that are associated with the chronic inflammation can be:
*Redness of the eyelids.
*Flaking of skin on the lids.
*Crusting at the lid margins, this is generally worse on waking.
*Cysts at the lid margin ([[hordeolum]]).
*Red eye.
*Debris in the tear film, seen under magnification (improved contrast with use of [[fluorescein]] drops).
*Gritty sensation of the eye or foreign-body sensation.
*Reduced vision.
*Eye itching

People who wear [[contact lens]]es usually have more trouble in coping with their symptoms because although they need contact lenses, they cannot wear them. Many such patients complain of being unable to wear their lenses for long periods of time or that the lenses are causing them even more irritation of the eye.

The lids may become red and may have ulcerative, non-healing areas which may actually bleed.<ref name="emedicinehealth">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/eyelid_inflammation_blepharitis/page3_em.htm#Eyelid%20Inflammation%20Symptoms |title=Eyelid Inflammation Symptoms |date= |author=Frank J. Weinstock |publisher=emedicinehealth.com |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref>  Blepharitis does not tend to cause problems with the patient's vision whatsoever, but due to a poor tear film, one may experience [[blurred vision]].

Eye redness and swelling tend to appear in more advanced cases, and they are rarely primary symptoms. The symptoms can slightly vary based on the exact cause of the condition. Blepharitis due to an [[allergy]] can cause dark lids, symptom which is known as "allergic shiner" and which tends to be more frequent in children rather than adults. Infectious blepharitis is accompanied by a yellow- or green-colored discharge which is more abundant in the morning and which leads to stuck lids. Blepharitis may also cause eyelid matting or "gluing" of the lashes.

Other blepharitis symptoms include sensitivity to light, eyelashes that grow abnormally or even loss of eyelashes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blepharitis/ds00633/dsection=symptoms | title=Symptoms |publisher=Mayo clinic |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref> Also, the [[tears]] might seem frothy or bubbly in nature and mild scarring might occur to the eyelids. The symptoms and signs of blepharitis are often erroneously ascribed by the patient as being due to "recurrent conjunctivitis".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/blepharitis/page2.htm#symptoms |title=What are the symptoms and signs of blepharitis? |date= |author=
Andrew A. Dahl |publisher=medicinenet.com |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref>

Blepharitis that localizes in the skin of the eyelids may cause [[stye]]s or [[chalazia]], which appear like red bumps, sometimes with a yellow spot if infection is present. Although pain is not common among blepharitis symptoms, if the condition persists or becomes painful, the individual is recommended to seek medical attention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blepharitistreatment.net/ |title=Blepharitis Treatment |publisher=blepharitistreatment.net |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref>

Chronic blepharitis may result in damage of varying severity which may have a negative effect upon vision and therefore upon the [[eyeglass prescription]].<ref name="emedicinehealth" /> 

Infectious blepharitis can cause hard crusts around the eyelashes which leave small ulcers that may bleed or ooze after cleaning.

As a general rule, blepharitis symptoms which do not improve, despite good hygiene consisting of proper cleaning and care of the eye area, should be referred to a doctor.

===Staphylococcal blepharitis===
Staphylococcal blepharitis is caused by infection of the anterior portion of the eyelid by [[Staphylococcus|Staphylococcal bacteria]]. Patients notice a foreign body sensation, matting of the lashes, and burning. Collarette around eyelashes, a ring-like formation around the lash shaft, can be observed, which is an important sign of this condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1211763-overview |title=Adult Blepharitis |date=Jun 17, 2011 |author= R Scott Lowery |publisher=Medscape |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref> Other symptoms include loss of eyelashes or broken eyelashes.<ref name="Blepharitis: Eyelid and Lacrimal Disorders: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/eye_disorders/eyelid_and_lacrimal_disorders/blepharitis.html?qt=&sc=&alt= |title=Blepharitis |date=August 2012 |author=James Garrity |publisher=The Merck Manual |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref>  The condition can sometimes lead to a [[chalazion]] or a [[stye]].<ref name="Blepharitis, Syte and Chalazion">{{cite web |url=http://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/cms/One.aspx?portalId=506244&pageId=15356063 |title=Blepharitis, Stye and Chalazion |publisher= University of Illinois College of Medicine |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref>

Staphylococcal blepharitis is a condition which may start in childhood and continue through adulthood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclinic.com/blepharitis.htm |title=Blepharitis |publisher=Angeles Vision Clinic |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref> It is commonly recurrent and it requires special medical care. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in the conjunctival sac and on the lid margin varies among countries, probably due to climate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archopht.highwire.org/cgi/reprint/95/5/812.pdf| title=Straphylococcal Blepharitis|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-10}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>

Staphylococcal blepharitis is normally treated with [[antibiotics]] such as Chloramphenicol ointment. Fusidic acid is usually the choice of antibiotics in cases when Chloramphenicol is contraindicated. Antibiotics are given for at least four to six weeks, which may be enough to completely cure the infection. A short course of [[topical steroid]]s are administered to control the inflammation. The infection is only treated effectively if given at the same time with extra cautious eyelid hygiene. This consists of proper cleaning of the eyelid, removing crusts and debris.

===Posterior blepharitis or ''rosacea-associated'' blepharitis===
[[File:Internal hordeolum.jpg|thumb|"Internal hordeolum"]]
Posterior blepharitis is inflammation of the eyelids secondary to dysfunction of the [[meibomian gland]]s. Like anterior blepharitis it is a bilateral chronic condition and manifested by a broad spectrum of symptoms involving the lids including inflammation and plugging of the meibomian orifices and production of abnormal secretion upon pressure over the glands. It may be associated with skin [[rosacea]].<ref name=vaughan />

==Treatment and management==
The single most important treatment principle is a daily routine of lid margin hygiene, as described below. Such a routine needs to be convenient enough to be continued for life to avoid relapses as blepharitis is often a chronic condition. But it can be acute, and one episode does not mean it is  a lifelong condition.

A typical lid margin hygiene routine consists of four steps. The steps are more challenging to perform by visually disabled or frail patients as they require good motor skills:

# Softening of lid margin debris and oils: Apply a warm wet compress to the lids - such as a washcloth with hot water - for about two minutes. Warm wet cloths do not stay warm for long enough but dry compress masks can be conveniently warmed in a micro-wave oven and maintain a comfortable 40C temperature for 10 minutes while the waxy oils blocking the glands are cleared. The humidity created also helps to reduce the evaporation of natural tears which are important in soothing the cornea.<ref name="Restoreyes">{{cite web |url=http://www.restoreyes.ca/product;cat,15;item,39;Blepharitis-Treatment-Blepharitis-Treatment-Kit |title=Blepharitis Treatment Kit |publisher=Restoreyes |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref>
# Mechanical removal of lid margin debris: After warm compresses, wash your face with a wash cloth. Use [[Cleanser|facial soap]] or non-burning baby shampoo (make sure to dilute the soap solution 1/10 with water first). Gently and repeatedly rub along the lid margins while eyes are closed. Too much soap or shampoo may remove the essential oily layer of the eyes' own tear film and create further problems with dry eye discomfort. A moist cotton bud soaked in a cup of water with a drop of baby shampoo may be used to rub along the lid margins while tilting the lid outward with the other hand.
# Antibiotic reduction of lid margin bacteria (at the discretion of a physician): After lid margin cleaning, spread small amount of prescription antibiotic ophthalmic ointment with finger tip along lid fissure while eyes closed. Use prior to bed time as opposed to in the morning to avoid blurry vision.
# Avoid the use of eye make-up until symptoms subside.
    
Often the above is advised together with mild massage to mechanically empty glands located at the lid margin ([[Meibomian glands]], [[glands of Zeis|Zeis glands]], [[glands of Moll|Moll glands]]).

Microbial blepharitis is treated with antibiotics such as [[Sulfacetamide]] eye ointment applied on a cotton applicator once daily to the lid margins. Ophthalmologists may prescribe low-dose oral antibiotics such as [[Doxycycline]] and occasionally weak topical steroids.<ref name=vaughan>{{cite book|last=Emmett T. Cunningham, Paul Riordan-Eva|title=Vaughan & Asbury's general ophthalmology.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|isbn=978-0071634205|edition=18th ed.}}</ref> 

Physicians may consider allergy testing and ocular [[antihistamines]].  Allergic responses to [[dust mite]] feces and other allergens can cause lid inflammation, ocular irritation, and [[dry eyes]].  Prescription ocular antihistamines and over-the-counter ocular antihistamines can bring relief to patients whose lid inflammation is caused by allergies.

Researchers have found Omega-3 supplementation in the form of Fish Oil or Flaxseed to be beneficial in reducing the primary symptoms of Blepharitis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Boerner CF | title = Dry eye successfully treated with oral flaxseed oil. | journal = Ocular Surg News | issue = 15 | pages = 147–8 | year = 2000  |url= |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Ambrosia RJ, Jr, Stelzner SK, Boerner CF, et al. | title = Nutrition and dry eye: the role of lipids. | journal = Rev Refract Surg | issue = 1 | pages = 29–32 | year = 2002  |url= |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Marian S.
