'''Neurogenesis''' (birth of [[neuron]]s) is the process by which neurons are generated from [[Neural stem cell|neural stem and progenitor cells]].  Most active during [[pre-natal development]], neurogenesis is responsible for populating the growing [[brain]] with neurons. Recently neurogenesis was shown to continue in several small parts of the brain of mammals: the [[hippocampus]] and the [[subventricular zone]]. Studies have indicated that hormones, such as testosterone in vertebrates and ecdysone in invertebrates, have an influence on the rate of neurogenesis.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

New neurons are continually born throughout adulthood in predominantly two regions of the brain:
* The '''[[subventricular zone]]''' (SVZ) lining the [[ventricular system|lateral ventricles]], where [[neural stem cell]]s and progenitor generate new neurons (Neuroblast) that migrate to the [[olfactory bulb]] via the [[rostral migratory stream]]
*The '''[[subgranular zone]]''' (SGZ), part of the [[dentate gyrus]] of [[hippocampus]].
Many of the newborn cells die shortly after they are born, but a number of them become functionally integrated into the surrounding brain tissue.
 
Adult neurogenesis is an example of a long-held scientific theory being further studied. Early neuroanatomists, including [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]], considered the nervous system fixed and incapable of regeneration.  The first evidence of adult mammalian neurogenesis in the [[cerebral cortex]] was presented by [[Joseph Altman]] in 1962,<ref>{{cite pmid|13860748}}</ref> followed by a demonstration of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in 1963.<ref>{{cite pmid|14012334}}</ref>  In 1969, Joseph Altman discovered and named the [[rostral migratory stream]] as the source of adult generated granule cell neurons in the olfactory bulb.<ref>{{cite pmid|5361244}}</ref>  Up until the 1980s, the scientific community ignored these findings despite use of the most direct method of demonstrating cell proliferation in the early studies, i. e. 3H-thymidine autoradiography.

Interestingly, under chronic stress conditions, the elevation of newborn neurons by antidepressants improves the hippocampal-dependent control on the stress response; without newborn neurons, antidepressants are unable to restore the regulation of the stress response and recovery becomes impossible.<ref name=surg1>{{cite journal |author=Surget A, Tanti A, Leonardo ED ''et al.'' |title=Antidepressants recruit new neurons to improve stress response regulation. |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=1177–88 |year=2011 |month=December |pmid=21537331 |doi=10.1038/mp.2011.48 |url=http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp201148a.html |volume=16 |pmc=3223314 |pages=1177–88}}</ref>

Some studies have hypothesized that learning and memory are linked to depression, and that neurogenesis may promote [[neuroplasticity]]. One study proposes that mood may be regulated, at a base level, by plasticity, and thus ''not chemistry''. Accordingly, the effects of antidepressant treatment would only be secondary to change in plasticity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Castrén E |title=Is mood chemistry? |journal=Nat Rev Neurosci. |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=241–6 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15738959 |doi=10.1038/nrn1629 |url=}}</ref>

===Effects of sleep reduction===

One study has linked lack of sleep to a reduction in rodent hippocampal neurogenesis. The proposed mechanism for the observed decrease was increased levels of [[glucocorticoids]].  It was shown that two weeks of [[sleep deprivation]] acted as a neurogenesis-inhibitor, which was reversed after return of normal sleep and even shifted to a temporary increase in normal cell proliferation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mirescu C, Peters JD, Noiman L, Gould E |title=Sleep deprivation inhibits adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus by elevating glucocorticoids |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. |volume=103 |issue=50 |pages=19170–5 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17135354 |pmc=1748194 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608644103 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/50/19170?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=neurogenesis+sleep&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10319170M }}</ref> More precisely, when levels of corticosterone are elevated, sleep deprivation inhibits this process. Nonetheless, normal levels of neurogenesis after chronic sleep deprivation return after 2 weeks, with a temporary increase of neurogenesis. (http://www.pnas.org/content/103/50/19170.full)
While this is recognized, overlooked is the blood glucose demand exhibited during temporary diabetic hypoglycemic states.  The American Diabetes Association amongst many documents the pseudosenilia and agitation found during temporary hypoglycemic states.  Much more clinical documentation is needed to competently demonstrate the link between decreased hematologic glucose and neuronal activity and mood.

===Possible use in treating Parkinson's disease===

[[Parkinson's disease]] is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of [[dopaminergic neuron]]s in the nigrostriatal projection.

===Effects of exercise===
Scientists have shown that physical activity in the form of voluntary exercise results in an increase in the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus of aging mice.

While the association between exercise-mediated neurogenesis and enhancement of learning remains unclear, this study could have strong implications in the fields of aging and/or [[Alzheimer's disease]].

===Changes in old age===
Neurogenesis is substantially reduced in the hippocampus of aged animals, raising the possibility that it may be linked to age-related declines in hippocampal function. Given that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, it might be expected that the hippocampus would steadily increase in size during adulthood, and that therefore the number of granule cells would be increased in aged animals. However, this is not the case, indicating that proliferation is balanced by cell death. Thus, it is not the addition of new neurons into the hippocampus that seems to be linked to hippocampal functions, but rather the rate of turnover of granule cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=von Bohlen und Halbach O |title=Involvement of BDNF in age-dependent alterations in the hippocampus |journal=Front Aging Neurosci |volume=2 |year=2010 |pmid=20941325 |pmc=2952461 |doi=10.3389/fnagi.2010.00036}}</ref>

==Regulation==

Many factors may affect the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis.  [[Exercise]] and an [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|enriched environment]] have been shown to promote the survival of neurons and the successful integration of newborn cells into the existing hippocampus.<ref name="pmid15766532">{{cite journal |author=Lazarov O, Robinson J, Tang YP, Hairston IS, Korade-Mirnics Z, Lee VM, Hersh LB, Sapolsky RM, Mirnics K, Sisodia SS |title=Environmental enrichment reduces Abeta levels and amyloid deposition in transgenic mice |journal=Cell |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=701–13 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15766532 |url= |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.015}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16177036}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|10195220}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bjørnebekk A, Mathé AA, Brené S |title=The antidepressant effect of running is associated with increased hippocampal cell proliferation |journal=Int J Neuropsychopharmacol |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=357–68 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=15769301 |doi=10.1017/S1461145705005122 |url=}}</ref> Another factor is [[central nervous system]] injury since neurogenesis occurs after [[cerebral ischemia]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jin K, Wang X, Xie L, ''et al.'' |title=Evidence for stroke-induced neurogenesis in the human brain |journal=Proc.

Circulating factors within the blood may reduce neurogenesis. In healthy aging humans, the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of certain chemokines are elevated. In a mouse model, plasma levels of these chemokines correlate with reduced neurogenesis, suggesting that neurogenesis may be modulated by certain global age-dependent systemic changes. These chemokines include [[CCL11]], [[CCL2]] and [[CCL12]], which are highly localized on mouse and human chromosomes, implicating a genetic locus in aging.<ref name="G. Neves 2008 65–75"/>

==Adult neural stem cells==
{{main|Neural stem cell}}
Neural [[stem cell]]s (NSCs) are the self-renewing, [[multipotency|multipotent]] cells that generate the main [[phenotypes]] of the [[nervous system]].

==Effects of cannabinoids ==
Some studies have shown that the use of [[Cannabinoid|cannabinoids]] results in the growth of new nerve cells in the hippocampus from both embryonic and adult stem cells. In 2005 a clinical study of rats at the University of Saskatchewan showed regeneration of nerve cells in the hippocampus.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/25509 |title=Cannabinoids promote embryonic and adult hippocampus neurogenesis and produce anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects |author=Wen Jiang; Yun Zhang; Lan Xiao; Jamie Van Cleemput; Shao-Ping Ji; Guang Bai; Xia Zhang |journal=[[Journal of Clinical Investigation]] |volume=115 |issue=11 |pages=3104–16 |date=2005-11-01 |doi=10.1172/JCI25509 |pmc=1253627 |accessdate=2011-03-02 |pmid=16224541}}</ref> Studies have shown that a synthetic drug resembling [[tetrahydrocanabinol|THC]], the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, provides some protection against brain inflammation, which might result in better memory at an older age. This is due to receptors in the system that can also influence the production of new neurons.<ref>http://www.osu.edu/news/newsitem2227</ref>
Nonetheless, a study directed at Rutgers University demonstrated how synchronization of action potentials in the hippocampus of rats was altered after THC administration. Lack of synchronization resulted in impaired performance in a standard test of memory.<ref>http://www.physorg.com/news84048508.html</ref>
