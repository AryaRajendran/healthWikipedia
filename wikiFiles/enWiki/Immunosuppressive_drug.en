'''Immunosuppressive drugs''' or '''immunosuppressive agents''' are [[medication|drugs]] that inhibit or prevent activity of the [[immune system]]. They are used in [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive therapy]] to:
* Prevent the [[transplant rejection|rejection]] of [[Organ transplant|transplanted]] organs and tissues (e.g., [[bone marrow]], [[heart]], [[kidney]], [[liver]])
* Treat [[autoimmunity|autoimmune diseases]] or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune origin (e.g., [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[myasthenia gravis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[Behcet's Disease]], [[pemphigus]], and [[ulcerative colitis]]).
* Treat some other non-autoimmune inflammatory diseases (e.g., long term allergic [[asthma]] control).

A common [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]] of many immunosuppressive drugs is [[immunodeficiency]], because the majority of them act non-selectively, resulting in increased susceptibility to [[infection]]s and decreased [[cancer immunosurveillance]]. There are also other side-effects, such as [[arterial hypertension|hypertension]], [[dyslipidemia]], [[hyperglycemia]], [[peptic ulcer]]s, [[lipodystrophy]], [[moon face]], [[Hepatotoxicity|liver]] and [[Nephrotoxicity|kidney injury]]. The immunosuppressive drugs also interact with other medicines and affect their [[metabolism]] and action. Actual or suspected immunosuppressive agents can be evaluated in terms of their effects on [[lymphocyte]] subpopulations in tissues using [[immunohistochemistry]].<ref name="">{{cite journal | author=N A Gillett and C Chan | title=Applications of immunohistochemistry in the evaluation of immunosuppressive agents | journal=Human & Experimental Toxicology | volume=19 | issue=4 | pages=251–254 | year=2000 | doi=10.1191/096032700678815819}}</ref>

Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified into five groups: 
* [[#Glucocorticoids|glucocorticoid]]s
* [[#Cytostatics|cytostatic]]s
* [[#Antibodies|antibodies]]
* [[#Drugs acting on immunophilins|drugs acting on immunophilin]]s
* [[#Other drugs|other drugs]].

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Glucocorticoids==
{{Main|Glucocorticoid}}
In pharmacologic (supraphysiologic) doses, glucocorticoids are used to suppress various [[allergy|allergic]], [[inflammation|inflammatory]], and autoimmune disorders. They are also administered as posttransplantory immunosuppressants to prevent the [[transplant rejection|acute transplant rejection]] and [[graft-versus-host disease]]. Nevertheless, they do not prevent an infection and also inhibit later [[tissue reparation|reparative processes]].

===Immunosuppressive mechanism===
Glucocorticoids suppress the [[cell-mediated immunity]]. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines [[Interleukin 1]] (IL-1), [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]], [[Interleukin 3|IL-3]], [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]], [[Interleukin 5|IL-5]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]], and TNF-γ, the most important of which is IL-2. Smaller [[cytokine]] production reduces the [[T cell]] proliferation.

Glucocorticoids also suppress the [[humoral immunity]], causing [[B cell]]s to express smaller amounts of IL-2 and [[IL-2 receptor]]s. This diminishes both B cell clone expansion and [[antibody]] synthesis.

===Antiinflammatory effects===
Glucocorticoids influence all types of inflammatory events, no matter their cause. They induce the [[lipocortin-1]] (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to [[cell membrane]]s preventing the [[phospholipase A2]] from coming into contact with its [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] [[arachidonic acid]]. This leads to diminished [[eicosanoid]] production. The [[cyclooxygenase]] (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect.

Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the [[leukocyte]] membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[cell adhesion|adhesion]], [[emigration]], [[chemotaxis]], [[phagocytosis]], [[respiratory burst]], and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, [[tissue plasminogen activator]], [[chemokine]]s, etc.) from [[neutrophil]]s, [[macrophage]]s, and [[mastocyte]]s.

==Cytostatics==
{{Main|Chemotherapy}}
[[Cytostatic]]s inhibit [[cell division]]. In immunotherapy, they are used in smaller doses than in the treatment of malignant diseases. They affect the proliferation of both T cells and B cells. Due to their highest effectiveness, [[purine]] analogs are most frequently administered.

===Alkylating agents===

The [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s used in immunotherapy are [[mustard gas|nitrogen mustards]] ([[cyclophosphamide]]), [[nitrosourea]]s, [[platinum]] compounds, and others. Cyclophosphamide (Baxter's Cytoxan) is probably the most potent immunosuppressive compound. In small doses, it is very efficient in the therapy of [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], autoimmune [[hemolytic anemia]]s, [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], and other immune diseases. High doses cause [[pancytopenia]] and hemorrhagic [[cystitis]].

===Antimetabolites===

[[Antimetabolite]]s interfere with the synthesis of nucleic acids. These include:

*[[folic acid]] analogues, such as [[methotrexate]]
*[[purine]] analogues such as [[azathioprine]] and [[mercaptopurine]]
*[[pyrimidine]] analogues
*[[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] inhibitors.

====Methotrexate====

[[Methotrexate]] (Teva's Purinethol) is a [[folic acid]] analogue. It binds [[dihydrofolate reductase]] and prevents synthesis of [[tetrahydrofolate]]. It is used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (for example rheumatoid arthritis or Behcet's Disease) and in transplantations.

====Azathioprine and mercaptopurine====

[[Azathioprine]] (Prometheus' Imuran), is the main immunosuppressive cytotoxic substance. It is extensively used to control transplant rejection reactions. It is nonenzymatically cleaved to [[mercaptopurine]], that acts as a purine analogue and an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Mercaptopurine itself can also be administered directly.

By preventing the clonal expansion of [[lymphocyte]]s in the induction phase of the immune response, it affects both the [[cell immunity|cell]] and the [[humoral immunity]]. It is also efficient in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

====Cytotoxic antibiotics====
Among these, [[dactinomycin]] is the most important. It is used in [[kidney transplantation]]s. Other cytotoxic antibiotics are [[anthracycline]]s, [[mitomycin C]], [[bleomycin]], [[mithramycin]].

==Antibodies==
[[Antibody|Antibodies]] are sometimes used as a quick and potent immunosuppressive therapy to prevent the acute rejection reactions as well as a targeted treatment of lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disorders (e.g., anti-CD20 monoclonals).

===Polyclonal antibodies===
Heterologous [[polyclonal antibodies]] are obtained from the [[blood plasma|serum]] of animals (e.g., [[rabbit]], [[horse]]), and injected with the patient's [[thymocyte]]s or lymphocytes. The antilymphocyte (ALG) and antithymocyte [[antigen]]s (ATG) are being used. They are part of the steroid-resistant acute rejection reaction and grave [[aplastic anemia]] treatment. However, they are added primarily to other immunosuppressives to diminish their dosage and toxicity. They also allow transition to ciclosporin therapy.

Polyclonal antibodies inhibit T lymphocytes and cause their [[lysis]], which is both [[Complement system|complement]]-mediated cytolysis and cell-mediated [[opsonization]] followed by removal of [[reticuloendothelial cell]]s from the [[circulatory system|circulation]] in the [[spleen]] and [[liver]]. In this way, polyclonal antibodies inhibit cell-mediated immune reactions, including graft rejection, [[delayed hypersensitivity]] (i.e., [[tuberculin skin reaction]]), and the [[graft-versus-host disease]] (GVHD), but influence [[thymus-dependent]] antibody production.

As of March 2005, there are two preparations available to the market: [[Atgam]], obtained from horse serum, and [[Thymoglobuline]], obtained from rabbit serum.  Polyclonal antibodies affect all lymphocytes and cause general immunosuppression, possibly leading to [[post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder]]s (PTLD) or serious infections, especially by [[cytomegalovirus]]. To reduce these risks, treatment is provided in a hospital, where adequate isolation from infection is available.  They are usually administered for five days intravenously in the appropriate quantity. Patients stay in the hospital as long as three weeks to give the immune system time to recover to a point where there is no longer a risk of [[serum sickness]].

Because of a high [[immunogenicity]] of polyclonal antibodies, almost all patients have an acute reaction to the treatment. It is characterized by [[fever]], [[rigor]] episodes, and even [[anaphylaxis]]. Later during the treatment, some patients develop serum sickness or [[immune complex glomerulonephritis]]. Serum sickness arises seven to fourteen days after the therapy has begun. The patient suffers from fever, [[joint pain]], and [[erythema]] that can be soothed with the use of steroids and [[analgesic]]s. [[Urticaria]] (hives) can also be present.  It is possible to diminish their toxicity by using highly-purified [[serum fraction]]s and intravenous administration in the combination with other immunosuppressants, for example, [[#Drugs acting on immunophilins|calcineurin inhibitors]], cytostatics and cortisteroids. The most frequent combination is to use antibodies and ciclosporin simultaneously in order to prevent patients from gradually developing a strong immune response to these drugs, reducing or eliminating their effectiveness.

===Monoclonal antibodies===
[[Monoclonal antibodies]] are directed towards exactly defined antigens. Therefore, they cause fewer side-effects. Especially significant are the [[IL-2 receptor]]- (CD25-) and CD3-directed antibodies. They are used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs, but also to track changes in the lymphocyte subpopulations. It is reasonable to expect similar new drugs in the future.

====T-cell receptor directed antibodies====
[[Muromonab-CD3]] is a murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody of the IgG2a type that prevents [[T-cell]] activation and proliferation by binding the T-cell receptor complex present on all differentiated T cells. As such it is one of the most potent immunosuppressive substances and is administered to control the steroid- and/or polyclonal antibodies-resistant acute rejection episodes. As it acts more specifically than polyclonal antibodies it is also used prophylactically in transplantations.

The muromonab's mechanism of action is only partially understood. It is known that the molecule binds TCR/CD3 receptor complex. In the first few administrations this binding non-specifically activates T-cells, leading to a serious syndrome 30 to 60 minutes later. It is characterized by fever, [[myalgia]], headache, and [[arthralgia]]. Sometimes it develops in a life-threatening reaction of the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system, requiring a lengthy therapy. Past this period CD3 blocks the TCR-antigen binding and causes [[conformational change]] or the removal of the entire TCR3/CD3 complex from the T-cell surface. This lowers the number of available T-cells, perhaps by sensitizing them for the uptake by the [[epithelial reticular cell]]s. The cross-binding of CD3 molecules as well activates an intracellular signal causing the T cell anergy or apoptosis, unless the cells receive another signal through a [[co-stimulation|co-stimulatory molecule]]. CD3 antibodies shift the balance from [[Th1 cell|Th1]] to [[Th2 cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The patient may develop [[Neutralizing antibody|neutralizing antibodies]] reducing the effectiveness of muromonab-CD3. 
Muromonab-CD3 can cause excessive immunosuppression. Although CD3 antibodies act more specifically than polyclonal antibodies, they lower the cell-mediated immunity significantly, predisposing the patient to [[opportunistic infection]]s and malignancies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

====IL-2 receptor directed antibodies====
[[Interleukin-2]] is an important immune system regulator necessary for the clone expansion and survival of activated lymphocytes T. Its effects are mediated by the trimer cell surface [[IL-2 receptor|receptor IL-2a]], consisting of the α, β, and γ chains. The IL-2a (CD25, T-cell activation antigen, TAC) is expressed only by the already-activated T lymphocytes. Therefore, it is of special significance to the selective immunosuppressive treatment, and research has been focused on the development of effective and safe anti-IL-2 antibodies. By the use of [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant gene technology]], the mouse anti-Tac antibodies have been modified, leading to the presentation of two chimeric mouse/human anti-Tac antibodies in the year 1998: [[basiliximab]] (Simulect) and [[daclizumab]] (Zenapax). These drugs act by binding the IL-2a receptor's α chain, preventing the IL-2 induced clonal expansion of activated lymphocytes and shortening their survival. They are used in the prophylaxis of the acute organ rejection after bilateral [[kidney transplantation]], both being similarly effective and with only few side-effects.

==Drugs acting on immunophilins==

===Ciclosporin===
{{Main|Ciclosporin}}
<!-- THE INTERNATIONAL NONPROPRIETARY NAME IS CICLOSOPRIN, WITH AN I. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO CYCLOSPORIN. THANK YOU. -->

Like [[tacrolimus]], ciclosporin (Novartis' Sandimmune) is a [[calcineurin]] inhibitor (CNI). It has been in use since 1983 and is one of the most widely used immunosuppressive drugs. It is a cyclic fungal peptide, composed of 11 amino acids.

Ciclosporin is thought to bind to the cytosolic protein [[cyclophilin]] (an [[immunophilin]]) of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially [[T-lymphocytes]]. This complex of ciclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits the phosphatase calcineurin, which under normal circumstances induces the transcription of [[interleukin-2]]. The drug also inhibits [[lymphokine]] production and [[interleukin]] release, leading to a reduced function of effector T-cells.

Ciclosporin is used in the treatment of acute rejection reactions, but has been increasingly substituted with newer, and less [[nephrotoxic]],<ref name="pmid19218475 ">{{cite journal |author=Naesens M, Kuypers DR, Sarwal M |title=Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity |journal=Clin. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=4 |issue= 2 |pages=481–509 |year=2009 |pmid=19218475  |doi=10.2215/CJN.04800908}}</ref> immunosuppressants.

Calcineurin inhibitors and azathioprine have been linked with post-transplant malignancies and [[skin cancer]]s in organ transplant recipients.  Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) after kidney transplantation is common and can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The results of several studies suggest that calcineurin inhibitors have oncogenic properties mainly linked to the production of cytokines that promote tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis.

This drug has been reported to reduce the frequency of [[regulatory T cell]]s (T-Reg) and after converting from a CNI monotherapy to a [[mycophenolate]] monotherapy, patients were found to have increased graft success and T-Reg frequency.<ref>Ahmet Demirkiran et. al, Conversion from calcineurin inhihibitor to mycophenolate mofetil-based immunosuppression changes the frequency and phenotype of CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory t cells, Transplantation, April 2009.</ref>

===Tacrolimus===
{{Main|Tacrolimus}}
Tacrolimus (trade name Prograf) is a product of the bacterium ''[[Streptomyces tsukubaensis]]''. It is a [[macrolide lactone]] and acts by inhibiting [[calcineurin]].

The drug is used primarily in liver and kidney transplantations, although in some clinics it is used in heart, lung, and heart/lung transplantations. It binds to the immunophilin [[FKBP1A]], followed by the binding of the complex to [[calcineurin]] and the inhibition of its [[phosphatase]] activity. In this way, it prevents the cell from transitioning from the G<sub>0</sub> into G<sub>1</sub> phase of the [[cell cycle]]. Tacrolimus is more potent than ciclosporin and has less pronounced side-effects.

===Sirolimus===
{{Main|Sirolimus}}
Sirolimus (rapamycin, trade name Rapamune) is a macrolide lactone, produced by the [[actinomycete]] bacterium ''[[Streptomyces hygroscopicus]]''. It is used to prevent rejection reactions. Although it is a structural analogue of tacrolimus, it acts somewhat differently and has different side-effects.

Contrary to ciclosporin and tacrolimus, drugs that affect the first phase of T lymphocyte activation, sirolimus affects the second phase, namely signal transduction and lymphocyte clonal proliferation. It binds to FKBP1A like tacrolimus, however the complex does not inhibit calcineurin but another protein, [[mTOR]]. Therefore, sirolimus acts synergistically with ciclosporin and, in combination with other immunosuppressants, has few side effects. Also, it indirectly inhibits several T lymphocyte-specific kinases and phosphatases, hence preventing their transition from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase of the cell cycle. In a similar manner, Sirolimus prevents B cell differentiation into plasma cells, reducing production of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies.

It is also active against [[tumor]]s that are PI3K/AKT/mTOR-dependent.

==Other drugs==

===Interferons===
{{Main|Interferon}}
IFN-β suppresses the production of Th1 cytokines and the activation of monocytes. It is used to slow down the progression of [[multiple sclerosis]]. IFN-γ is able to trigger lymphocytic [[apoptosis]].

===Opioids===
Prolonged use of [[opioid]]s may cause immunosuppression of both innate and adaptive immunity.<ref name="royloh">{{cite journal | author=S Roy and HH Loh | title=Effects of opioids on the immune system | journal=Neurochem Res. | volume=21 | issue=11 | pages=1375–1386 | pmid=8947928 | doi=10.1007/BF02532379 | year=1996}}</ref> Decrease in proliferation as well as immune function has been observed in macrophages, as well as lymphocytes. It is thought that these effects are mediated by opioid receptors expressed on the surface of these immune cells.<ref name="royloh"/>

===TNF binding proteins===
A [[TNF-α]] (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) binding protein is a monoclonal antibody or a circulating [[receptor (proteomics)|receptor]] such as [[infliximab]] (Remicade), [[etanercept]] (Enbrel), or [[adalimumab]] (Humira) that binds to TNF-α, preventing it from inducing the synthesis of IL-1 and IL-6 and the adhesion of lymphocyte-activating molecules. They are used in the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], and [[psoriasis]].

TNF or the effects of TNF are also suppressed by various natural compounds, including [[curcumin]] (an ingredient in [[turmeric]]) and catechins (in [[green tea]]). 

These drugs may raise the risk of contracting [[tuberculosis]] or inducing a latent infection to become active. Infliximab and adalimumab have label warnings stating that patients should be evaluated for latent TB infection and treatment should be initiated prior to starting therapy with them.

===Mycophenolate===
[[Mycophenolic acid]] acts as a non-competitive, selective, and reversible inhibitor of [[Inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase]] (IMPDH), which is a key enzyme in the ''de novo'' [[guanosine]] nucleotide synthesis. In contrast to other human cell types, lymphocytes B and T are very dependent on this process. Mycophenolate mofetil is used in combination with ciclosporin or tacrolimus in transplant patients.

===Small biological agents===
[[Fingolimod]] is a new synthetic immunosuppressant, currently in phase 3 of clinical trials. It increases the expression or changes the function of certain adhesion molecules (α4/β7 [[integrin]]) in lymphocytes, so they accumulate in the [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic tissue]] (lymphatic nodes) and their number in the circulation is diminished. In this respect, it differs from all other known immunosuppressants.

[[Myriocin]] has been reported being 10 to 100 times more potent than [[Ciclosporin]].
