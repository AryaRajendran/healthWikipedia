'''Heteroplasmy''' is the presence of a mixture of more than one type of an [[organelle|organellar]] [[genome]] ([[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) or [[plastid]] DNA) within a cell or individual. It is a factor for the severity of [[mitochondrial disease]]s. Since most [[eukaryotic cells]] contain many hundreds of mitochondria with hundreds of copies of mtDNA, it is possible and indeed very frequent for [[mutation]]s to affect only some mitochondria while others are unaffected. Heteroplasmy can be beneficial rather than detrimental insofar as [[centenarian]]s show a higher than average degree of heteroplasmy.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rose G, Passarino G, Scornaienchi V, Romeo G, Dato S, Bellizzi D, Mari V, Feraco E, Maletta R, Bruni A, Franceschi C, De Benedictis G | title=The mitochondrial DNA control region shows genetically correlated levels of heteroplasmy in leukocytes of centenarians and their offspring | journal=BMC GENOMICS  | volume=8 |  year=2007 | pages=293  | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/293 | id=PMID 17727699 }}</ref>

[[Microheteroplasmy]] is normally found as hundreds of independent mutations in one organism, with each mutation usually found in 1–2% of all mitochondrial genomes.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1089/rej.2005.8.172}}</ref> However, the rest of this article primarily focuses on more gross heteroplasmy.

==Severity and time to presentation==
Symptoms of severe heteroplasmic mitochondrial disorders frequently do not appear until adulthood because many cell divisions and a lot of time is required for a cell to receive enough mitochondria containing the mutant alleles to cause symptoms.  An example of this phenomenon is [[Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy|Leber optic atrophy]].  Individuals with this condition often do not experience vision difficulties until they have reached adulthood.  Another example is [[MERRF syndrome]] (or Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers). In [[mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes|MELAS]], heteroplasmy explains the variation in severity of the disease among siblings.

==Screening==
[[Preimplantation genetic screening]] (PGS) can be used to quantitate the risk for a child of being affected by a mitochondrial disease. A muscle mutation level of approximately 18% or less generally confers a 95% or higher chance of being unaffected.<ref name=Hellebrekers2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms008}}</ref>

==Notable cases==
One notable example of an otherwise healthy individual whose heteroplasmy was discovered incidentally is [[Nicholas II of Russia]], whose heteroplasmy (and that of his brother) served to convince [[Russia]]n authorities of the authenticity of his remains.<!--
