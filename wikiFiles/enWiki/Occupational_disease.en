An '''occupational disease''' is any chronic ailment that occurs as a result of work or occupational activity. It is an aspect of [[occupational safety and health]]. An occupational disease is typically identified when it is shown that it is more prevalent in a given body of workers than in the general population, or in other worker populations. The [[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma|first such disease to be recognised]], [[squamous-cell carcinoma]] of the [[scrotum]]  was identified in [[chimney sweep]] boys by [[Percivall Pott|Sir Percival Pott]] in 1775.  Occupational hazards that are of a traumatic nature (such as falls by roofers) are not considered to be occupational diseases.  

Under the law of [[workers' compensation]] in many jurisdictions, there is a presumption that specific disease are caused by the worker being in the work environment and the burden is on the employer or insurer to show that the disease came about from another cause. Diseases compensated by national workers compensation authorities are often termed occupational diseases. However many countries do not offer compensations for certain diseases like musculoskeletal disorders caused by work (e.g. in Norway).Therefore the term work-related diseases is  utilized to describe diseases  of occupational origin. This term however would then include both compensable and non-compensable diseases that have occupational origins.

==Examples==
Some well-known occupational diseases include:

===Lung diseases===

[[Occupational asthma]] has a vast number of [[Occupational_asthma#Occupations_at_risk|occupations at risk]].

Bad [[indoor air quality]] may predispose for diseases in the lungs as well as in other parts of the body.

===Skin diseases===
