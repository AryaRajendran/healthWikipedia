==Personal life==

Faget was born to Jean Baptiste Faget and F. Le Mormand. His parents were refugees from [[Santo Domingo]]. They fled [[Hispaniola]] during the [[Haitian Revolution]] and spent some time in [[Cuba]] before settling in New Orleans in 1809.<ref name="duffy"/> Jean Charles was educated by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]s in New Orleans before furthering is education at [[Collège Rolin]] in [[Paris]] from 1830 to 1837.<ref name="duffy"/> Faget was then admitted the [[University of Paris]]' college of [[internal medicine]] and graduated [[Latin honors|magna cum laude]] in 1845.<ref name="duffy"/> He returned to New Orleans and married Glady Ligeret de Chazey and became the father of thirteen children.  He was the grandfather of [[Guy Henry Faget]], and great-grandfather of [[Maxime Faget]]. 

Faget one was of many well-educated French physicians to practice in New Orleans at the time. They had similar backgrounds to Faget either being the children of refugees from Santo Domingo or the upheavals of the [[French Revolution]] and ensuing rule by [[Napoleon I]]. Faget's education in Paris entered him into an elite circle of physicians known as the [[Société Médicale de la Nouvelle-Orléans]].<ref name ="duffy"/>

==Career==

His medical practice began during an era when [[yellow fever]] was a tremendous problem in New Orleans. The exact cause of yellow fever was not known at the time. Early scientists believed that it was caused by environmental problems like rotting food, weather conditions, and poor sanitation.<ref name="duffy"/> Faget's observations of the disease prompted him to believe that the disease could be attributed to a specific [[microorganism]].<ref name="duffy"/> It is now known that yellow fever is a [[virus]] that is [[vector (epidemiology)|transmitted]] by the bite of female [[mosquito]]es (the yellow fever mosquito, ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'', and other species) and is found in [[Tropics|tropic]]al and [[Subtropics|subtropic]]al areas in [[South America]] and [[Africa]].<ref name="urlCDC Yellow Fever">{{cite web

During Faget's lifetime, yellow fever was deemed one of the most dangerous [[infectious disease]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last = Oldstone |first = Michael B.

Faget worked to recognize the correct diagnosis of yellow fever. The earliest accepted signs of the fever were [[jaundice]] and [[Hematemesis|vomit containing blood]]. Faget was convinced that other fevers had the same symptoms. He sought better ways to distinguish yellow fever from other ailments. Other physicians began to notice that their patients with yellow fever shared a common symptom. Early in their illness they experience an increased [[pulse]] that was followed by a slow pulse. Faget confirmed these observations and came to the conclusion that the pulse change was unique to those with yellow fever.<ref name="duffy"/> Faget also became convinced that yellow fever could be traced to a specific microorganism that came to New Orleans via foreign shipping. He noted that those with the fever began feeling the symptoms in areas near the New Orleans dock. He thought that the small organisms were spawned by a combination of rotting matter in ships' holds and the heat and humidity of the city.<ref name="duffy"/> Faget also noticed a key difference between [[malaria]] and yellow fever. Malaria could be treated with [[quinine]], but quinine had no positive effect on yellow fever.<ref name="duffy"/>

Faget published what became known as Faget's Law. He stated that "the pulse in yellow fever slows as the temperature (of the patient) rises or remains high." [[Faget's sign]] is still an important symptom when doctors diagnose yellow fever.<ref name="duffy"/> His findings were important at the time because they helped other doctors distinguish the differences between malaria and yellow fever.<ref name="duffy"/> He furthered his studies in the 1860s by using a [[medical thermometer]] to gather data on patients with the diseases. He published his findings in French and English journals and stated that yellow fever was distinguished from malaria by the continuous fever that is a symptom as opposed to the fevers and [[Shivering|chills]] of malaria.<ref name="duffy"/> 

Faget also worked in [[obstetrics]] and became an early proponent of using [[anesthesia]] on pregnant women. He published a paper that was a study of [[croup]] and [[diphtheria]]. Faget served his community by holding a position on the New Orleans [[Sanitary Commission]] and as a member of the Louisiana [[Board of Health]]. He went back to Paris for two years after the [[American Civil War]] where he was named a [[Order (honour)|chevalier]], a Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] by [[Napoleon III]] after helping relieve an epidemic in [[France]].<ref name="duffy"/><ref name="faget">{{cite web | url = http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3090.html | title = Jean-Charles Faget | publisher = | accessdate = October 17, 2010}}</ref><ref name="obit">{{cite news | title = Obituary | date = December 9, 1884 | publisher = The New York Times | page = 2 | accessdate = October 17, 2010}}</ref> Faget died in New Orleans on December 7, 1884.<ref name="duffy"/><ref name="obit"/>
