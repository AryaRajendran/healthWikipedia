'''Trichomoniasis''', sometimes referred to as "trich", is a common cause of [[vaginitis]]. It is a [[sexually transmitted disease]], and is caused by the single-celled [[protozoan]] parasite ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' producing mechanical stress on host cells and then ingesting cell fragments after cell death.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0031182009991041 | author = Midlej V., Benchimol M. | year = 2010 | title = Trichomonas vaginalis kills and eats- evidence for phagocytic activity as a cytopathic effect | url = | journal = Parasitology | volume = 137 | issue = 1| pages = 65–76 | pmid = 19723359 }}</ref> Trichomoniasis is primarily an infection of the [[Genitourinary system|urogenital tract]]; the most common site of infection is the [[urethra]] and the [[vagina]] in women.

==Signs and symptoms==
Typically, only women experience symptoms associated with ''Trichomonas'' infection.  Symptoms include inflammation of the cervix ([[cervicitis]]), urethra ([[urethritis]]), and vagina ([[vaginitis]]) which produce an itching or burning sensation. Discomfort may increase during [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] and [[urination]]. There may also be a yellow-green, itchy, frothy, foul-smelling ("fishy" smell) [[Mucopurulent discharge|vaginal discharge]]. In rare cases, lower abdominal pain can occur. Symptoms usually appear in women within 5 to 28 days of exposure.<ref name="Trichomoniasis symptoms">[http://www.cdc.gov/STD/Trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm#symptoms Trichomoniasis symptoms]. cdc.gov</ref> In many cases, men may hold the parasite for some years without any signs (dormant). Some sexual health specialists have stated that the condition can probably be carried in the vagina for years, despite standard tests being negative.<ref name="Trichomoniasis dormancy">[http://www.medhelp.org/posts/STDs/Can-trichomoniasis-be-dormant/show/246057]. Can trichomoniasis be dormant? MedHelp</ref> While symptoms are most common in women, some men may temporarily exhibit symptoms such as an irritation inside the penis, mild discharge or slight burning after urination or ejaculation.<ref name="Trichomoniasis symptoms"/>

==Diagnosis==
Trichomoniasis is diagnosed by visually observing the [[trichomonads]] via a microscope. In women, the examiner collects the specimen during a pelvic examination by inserting a [[Speculum (medical)|speculum]] into the vagina and then using a cotton-tipped applicator to collect the sample. The sample is then placed onto a microscopic slide and sent to a laboratory to be analyzed.

Trichomoniasis has been difficult to diagnose due to the poor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of the tests; in 2011 a study reported a more reliable test.<ref name=Andrea&Chapin2011>{{cite journal| author=Andrea SB, Chapin KC| title=Comparison of Aptima Trichomonas vaginalis Transcription-Mediated Amplification Assay and BD Affirm VPIII for Detection of T. vaginalis in Symptomatic Women: Performance Parameters and Epidemiological Implications. | journal=J Clin Microbiol | year= 2011 | volume= 49 | issue= 3 | pages= 866–9 | pmid=21248097 | doi=10.1128/JCM.02367-10 | pmc= | url= | laysummary = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/l-amd030811.php}}</ref>

==Causes==
[[Image:Trichomoniasis 01.png|thumb|Lifecycle of Trichomonas]]
The human genital tract is the only reservoir for this species. Trichomonas is transmitted through sexual or genital contact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm |title= Trichomoniasis - CDC Fact Sheet
|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>

===Genetic sequence===
A draft sequence of the Trichomonas [[genome]] was published on January 12, 2007 in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' confirming that the genome has at least 26,000 [[genes]], a similar number to the [[human genome]].  An additional ~35,000 unconfirmed genes, including thousands that are part of potential transposable elements, brings the gene content to well over 60,000.  <ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news87825794.html Scientists crack the genome of the parasite causing trichomoniasis]. Physorg.com. Jan. 12, 2007.</ref>

==Prevention==
Use of male [[condom]]s may help prevent the spread of trichomoniasis,<ref>[http://www.ashastd.org/learn/learn_vag_trich.cfm#8 Vaginitis/Trichomoniasis :Reduce your risk], [[American Social Health Association]]. Retrieved March 12, 2008.</ref> although careful studies have never been done that focus on how to prevent this infection. Infection with Trichomoniasis through water is unlikely because ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' dies in water after 45–60 minutes, in thermal water after 30 minutes to 3 hours and in [[:wikt:dilute|dilute]]d  [[urine]] after 5–6 hours.<ref name="gynekologie"/>

==Treatment==
Treatment for both pregnant and non-pregnant patients usually utilizes [[metronidazole]] (Flagyl),<ref>[http://www.ashastd.org/learn/learn_vag_trich_tri.cfm#3 Vaginitis/Trichomoniasis :Treatment for trichomoniasis], [[American Social Health Association]]. Retrieved March 12, 2008.</ref> but with caution especially in early stages of pregnancy<ref name="pmid15489348">{{cite journal |author=Cudmore SL, Delgaty KL, Hayward-McClelland SF, Petrin DP, Garber GE |title=Treatment of infections caused by metronidazole-resistant Trichomonas vaginalis |journal=Clin.

Although both men and women are susceptible to suffer the infection, it is suspected that more than one half of men who are infected will naturally expel the parasite within 14 days,<ref>{{cite book | title =Scientists fighting STD with research, education | url=http://www.uthscsa.edu/mission/spring00/std.htm |author=Heather Feldman}}</ref> while in women it will persist unless treated.

==Complications==
Research has shown a link between trichomoniasis and two serious [[sequelæ]]. Data suggest that:
* Trichomoniasis is associated with increased risk of transmission of [[HIV]].
* Trichomoniasis may cause a woman to deliver a low-birth-weight or [[premature birth|premature]] infant.
* Trichomoniasis is also associated with increased chances of [[cervical cancer]]
* Evidence implies that infection in males potentially raises the risks of [[prostate cancer]] development and spread due to inflammation.<ref>LittleAbout, [http://www.littleabout.com/news/33563,boffins-find-link-common-sexual-infection-prostate-cancer-risk.html Boffins find link between common sexual infection, prostate cancer risk], Retrieved Sept 17 2009.</ref>

Additional research is needed to fully explore these relationships.

==Epidemiology==
Globally trichomoniasis effects approximately 152&nbsp;million people as of 2010 (2.2% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012/> It is more common in women (2.7%) than males (1.4%).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163-96|pmid=23245607}}</ref> The [[American Social Health Association]] estimates trichomoniasis affects 7.4 million previously unaffected Americans each year and is the most frequently presenting new infection of the common sexually transmitted diseases.<ref>Associated Press, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18093769/ Abstinence students still having sex], [[MSNBC]], April 16, 2007.
