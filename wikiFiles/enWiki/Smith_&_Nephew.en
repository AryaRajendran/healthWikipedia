==Operations==
[[Image:Smith and Nephew.jpg|thumb|right|The Smith and Nephew factory in [[Kingston upon Hull]], United Kingdom]]
Smith & Nephew operates in three market segments through separate "[[Strategic business unit|global business units]]" under the Smith & Nephew brand name:
*[[Wound healing|Advanced wound management]]: advanced treatments for difficult [[wound]]s.
*[[Endoscopy]]: products for [[minimally invasive]] surgery, based in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].
*[[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopaedics]]: hip and knee [[Implant (medicine)|implants]] and [[Trauma surgery|trauma]] products, based in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

Smith & Nephew has a track record of bringing innovative new products to market that provide better clinical outcomes for patients and save costs for healthcare providers. This is the primary focus of its fourth business unit, [[biologic medical product|Biologics]].

The company's [[business strategy]] is based on researching, developing, manufacturing and marketing technically innovative and advanced medical devices. In 2008 it invested $152&nbsp;million in its highly regarded research and development activities – a figure that is currently around 4% of sales. The Biologics business unit, headquartered in North Carolina in the US, has strategic responsibility for product innovation and development and serves the needs of the remaining business units. The company's direct contacts with healthcare providers are a vital link in the chain. Clinicians' views of their present and future needs provide essential impetus for Smith & Nephew's research work.

The company has three focus areas of cross-business research: novel bioresorbable polymers, tissue or cell engineering, and non-invasive stimulation. Scientific Review Boards, comprising eminent academic scientists and medical professionals, provide independent assessments of the quality of the science and engineering in Smith & Nephew's business unit programmes and guidance on emerging science as necessary.
