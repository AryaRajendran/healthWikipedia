'''Antonio Vallejo-Nájera''' (1889–1960) was a Spanish psychiatrist.

== Early life ==

Vallejo-Nájera was born in [[Paredes de Nava]] in 1889. He studied medicine at the [[University of Valladolid]] and joined the army’s sanitary corps in 1910, taking part in the [[Rif War]] between 1912 and 1915. During [[World War I]] he was posted to the military department at the Spanish Embassy in [[Berlin]]. There he met well-known figures of German Psychiatry such as Gruhle, Schwalb and [[Kraepelin]]. He also conducted inspections of prisoner of war concentration camps, an activity for which he was awarded medals by Belgium and France after the war. On returning to Spain he worked at the Ciempozuelos Military Psychiatric Clinic. When the Civil War broke out he was a teacher of Psychiatry in the Military Sanitary Academy.<ref>http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm</ref>

Vallejo Nájera promoted in Spain a personal notion of [[eugenics]], intending to reconcile German doctrines of [[racial hygiene]] from authors like Schwalb with the requirements of Catholic moral doctrine, opposed to state-imposed measures of eugenic restriction. He advocated ''eugamia'', a eugenic policy implemented through premarital orientation work based on the biopsychological assessment of a couple’s personality.<ref>http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm</ref>

== Spanish Civil War and Francoist repression.==
During the [[Spanish Civil War]] he supported the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalists]]. In 1938, he set up the ''Gabinete de Investigaciones Psicológicas de la Inspección de Campos de Concentración de Prisioneros de Guerra'' (Psychological Research Bureau of Inspection of Prisoner of War Concentration Camps), a center for psychological investigations. The bureau was established near the San Pedro de Cardeña concentration camp and had fourteen clinics in the nationalist zone. Vallejo Najera carried out experiments on female [[Spanish Republican Army]] and [[International Brigades]] prisoners to establish "the bio-psychic roots of [[Marxism]]" and find the "red gene".<ref>Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish civil war. Reaction, revolution&revenge.'' Harper Perennial. 2006. London. p.310</ref><ref>http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm</ref> For Vallejo Najera, Marxists were genetic retards<ref>Tremlett, Giles. ''Ghosts of Spain.'' Faber and Faber. London. 2006. p.63</ref> and Marxism was a mental illness: "A priori, it seems probable that psychopaths of all types would join the Marxist ranks...Since Marxism goes together with social immorality... we presume those fanatics who fought with arms will show schizoid temperaments.".<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/01/spain.gilestremlett</ref> 

Vallejo’s conclusions were that the only way to prevent the racial dissolution of the Spanish was to take away the ''red'' children from their mothers in places "away from [[Democracy|democratic]] environments and where the exaltation of [[Scientific racism|bio-psychic racial qualities]] is encouraged".<ref>Tremlett, Giles. ''Ghosts of Spain.'' Faber and Faber. London. 2006. p.63</ref> By 1943, 12,043 children had been taken from their mothers and handed over to orphanages or Francoist families,<ref> Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939'' Penguin books. London. 2006. p.407</ref> but the number of children taken away from their parents may be closer to 30,000.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-30000-lost-children-of-the-franco-years-are-set-to-be-saved-from-oblivion-2173996.html</ref> Furthermore, many children evacuated by the Republic to France, England and elsewhere, were forced to return against the will of their parents.<ref>Tremlett, Giles. ''Ghosts of Spain.'' Faber and Faber. London. 2006. p.63</ref> In some cases birth records were destroyed<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/world/europe/01franco.html</ref> and the children's names changed<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5802820.ece</ref> in order to prevent any further contact with their parents.

Vallejo Najera contributed to the justification of the Francoist post-war repression. He said that the ''[[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|reds]]'' should: "suffer the punishment they deserve, with death the easiest of them all. Some will live in permanent [[exile]]...Others will lose their freedom, groaning for years in prisons, purging their crimes with forced work in order to earn their daily bread...".<ref>Tremlett, Giles. ''Ghosts of Spain.'' Faber and Faber. London. 2006. pp.61-62</ref> According to Paul Preston the ''investigations'' of Vallejo-Najera provided the Francoist dictatorship with "scientific" arguments in order to "justify their views on the subhuman nature of their adversaries".<ref>Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish civil war. Reaction, revolution&revenge.'' Harper Perennial. 2006. London. p.310</ref> According to the Spanish psychiatrist Carlos Castillo del Pino: "For Vallejo Nagera, reds were degenerates and if they were allowed to breed they would enfeeble the Spanish race. Therefore, they had to be exterminated."<ref>http://vimeo.com/26232645</ref>

== Later life==
When the Civil War ended, Vallejo was appointed as Professor of Psychiatry at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]. He was one of the founders of the Spanish Psychological Society. He died in 1960.<ref>http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm</ref>
