'''Drowning''' is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid.

'''Near drowning''' is the survival of a drowning event involving unconsciousness or water inhalation and can lead to serious secondary complications, including death, after the event.<ref name="Lunetta & Modell, 2005">Lunetta, P. & Modell, J.H.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], drowning is the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury related deaths (est. 388,000 deaths by drowning in 2004, excluding those due to [[natural disaster]]s), with 96% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries.<ref name="WHO sheet 347">{{cite web|title=Fact sheet N°347, November 2010: "Drowning"|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs347/en/index.html|publisher=[[World Health organization]]|accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> In many countries, drowning is one of the [[leading causes of death]] for children under 12 years old.

This definition does not imply fatality, or even the necessity for medical treatment after removal of the cause, nor that any fluid necessarily enters the lungs. The WHO further recommended "Drowning outcomes should be classified as: [[death]], [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]], and no morbidity. There was also consensus that the terms wet, dry, active, passive, silent, and secondary drowning should no longer be used."<ref name="WHO 2005"/>

== Classification ==
Experts differentiate between distress and drowning. They also divide drowning into passive and secondary:

* '''Distress''' - these are people ''in trouble'', but who still have the ability to keep afloat, signal for help and take actions.

* '''Drowning''' - these are people ''suffocating'' and in ''imminent danger of death within seconds''. Drowning falls into two categories:
:* '''Passive drowning''' - people who suddenly sink or have sunk due to a change in their circumstances. Examples include people who drown in an accident, or due to sudden [[loss of consciousness]] or sudden medical condition.
:* <p>'''Active drowning''' - people such as non-swimmers and the exhausted or [[hypothermia|hypothermic]] at the surface, who are unable to hold their [[mouth]] above water and are suffocating due to lack of [[air]]. Instinctively, people in such cases perform well known behaviors in the last 20 - 60 seconds before being submerged, representing the body's last efforts to obtain air.</p><p>Notably such people are unable to call for help, talk, reach for rescue equipment, or alert swimmers even feet away, and they may drown quickly and silently close to other swimmers or safety.</p>

== Signs and symptoms ==
{{main|Instinctive drowning response}}
Drowning is most often quick and unspectacular. Its media depictions as a loud, violent struggle have much more in common with [[distressed swimmer|distressed non-swimmers]], who may well drown but have not yet begun. In particular, an asphyxiating person is seldom able to call for help.<ref>Mario Vittoine, Francesco Pia: "[http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/On%20Scene/OSFall06.pdf It Doesn’t Look Like They’re Drowning: How To Recognize the Instinctive Drowning Response]", ''On Scene'', Fall 2006, p. 14.</ref> The [[instinctive drowning response]] covers many signs or behaviors associated with drowning or near-drowning:

* Head low in the water, mouth at water level
* Head tilted back with mouth open
* Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus
* Eyes open, with fear evident on the face
* Hyperventilating or gasping
* Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway
* Trying to roll over on the back to float
* Uncontrollable movement of arms and legs, rarely out of the water.

Pia notes that drowning begins at the point a person is unable to keep their mouth above water; inhalation of water takes place at a later stage.<ref name="Fletemeyer">{{cite book|last=Fletemeyer|first=John|title=Drowning: new perspectives on intervention and prevention, Volume 1998|year=1999|pages=234|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Xcnwm8zE24QC&dq=drowning+new+perspectives+on+intervention+and+prevention|coauthors=Pia (Chapter author)|chapter=Chapter 14 ("Reflections on Lifeguard surveillance programs")|isbn=978-1-57444-223-6}}</ref> Most people demonstrating the instinctive drowning response do not show prior evidence of distress.<ref name="Fletemeyer" />

== Cause ==
[[Image:Drowning child warning.jpg|thumb|Children have drowned in buckets and toilets.]]

Approximately 90% of drownings take place in freshwater (rivers, lakes and [[swimming pool]]s) and 10% in [[seawater]]. Drownings in other fluids is rare, and often relates to [[industrial accident]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

People have drowned in as little as 30&nbsp;mm of water lying face down, in one case in a wheel rut.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Children have drowned in baths, buckets and toilets; inebriates or those under the influence of drugs have died in puddles.

Drowning can also happen in ways that are less well known:

* '''[[Deep water blackout]]''' - caused by latent [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] upon ascent from depth, where the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen in the lungs under pressure at the bottom of a deep free-dive is adequate to support consciousness but drops below the blackout threshold as the water pressure decreases on the ascent. It usually strikes upon arriving near the surface as the pressure approaches normal atmospheric pressure.
* '''[[Shallow water blackout]]''' - caused by [[hyperventilation]] prior to swimming or diving. The primary urge to breathe (more precisely: to exhale) is triggered by rising [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels in the bloodstream.<ref name="pmid17274316">{{cite journal |author=Lindholm P, Lundgren CE |title=Alveolar gas composition before and after maximal breath-holds in competitive divers |journal=Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine : Journal of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=463–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17274316 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5053 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> The body detects CO<sub>2</sub> levels very accurately and relies on this to control breathing.<ref name=pmid17274316/> Hyperventilation artificially depletes this, but leaves the diver susceptible to sudden loss of consciousness without warning from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. There is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout, and victims (often capable swimmers swimming under the surface in shallow water) become unconscious and drown quietly without alerting anyone to the fact that there is a problem; they are typically found on the bottom.
{{anchor|Secondary drowning}}
* '''Secondary drowning''' - Inhaled fluid can act as an [[irritation|irritant]] inside the [[lungs]]. Physiological responses to even small quantities include the extrusion of liquid into the lungs ([[pulmonary edema]]) over the following hours, but this reduces the ability to exchange air and can lead to a person "drowning in their own body fluid". Certain poisonous vapors or gases (as for example in [[chemical warfare]]), or vomit can have a similar effect. The reaction can take place up to 72 hours after a near drowning incident, and may lead to a serious condition or death.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
A continued lack of oxygen in the brain, [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], will quickly render a victim unconscious usually around a blood partial pressure of oxygen of 25-30 mmHg. An unconscious victim rescued with an airway still sealed from laryngospasm stands a good chance of a full recovery. [[Artificial respiration]] is also much more effective without water in the lungs. At this point the victim stands a good chance of recovery if attended to within minutes. Latent hypoxia is a special condition leading to unconsciousness where the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs under pressure at the bottom of a deep free-dive is adequate to support consciousness but drops below the blackout threshold as the water pressure decreases on the ascent, usually close to the surface as the pressure approaches normal atmospheric pressure.  A blackout on ascent like this is called a [[deep water blackout]].

The brain cannot survive long without oxygen and the continued lack of oxygen in the blood combined with the cardiac arrest will lead to the deterioration of brain cells causing first [[brain damage]] and eventually [[brain death]] from which recovery is generally considered impossible.

A lack of oxygen or chemical changes in the lungs may cause the heart to stop beating; this [[cardiac arrest]] stops the flow of blood and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain. Cardiac arrest used to be the traditional point of death but at this point there is still a chance of recovery. The brain will die after approximately six minutes without oxygen but special conditions may prolong this (see 'cold water drowning' below).

As well as the direct effect of oxygen deprivation, there are also dangerous effects on blood chemistry if water is taken into the [[lungs]]. The mechanism for this is different for fresh and seawater.

:* Freshwater taken into the lungs will be pulled into the pulmonary circulation by [[osmosis]]. The dilution of blood leads to [[hemolysis]] (bursting of red blood cells). The resulting elevation of [[blood plasma|plasma]] K+ (potassium) level and depression of Na+ (sodium) level alter the electrical activity of the heart often causing [[ventricular fibrillation]]. In animal experiments this effect was shown to be capable of causing cardiac arrest in 2 to 3 minutes. [[Acute renal failure]] can also result from [[hemoglobin]] from the burst blood cells accumulating in the [[kidney]]s, and [[cardiac arrest]] can also result if cold freshwater taken into the bloodstream sufficiently cools the [[heart]].

:* Sea water is [[hypertonic]] to blood (more salty). It poses the opposite danger. Osmosis will instead pull water from the bloodstream into the lungs, thickening the blood. In animal experiments the thicker blood requires more work from the heart leading to cardiac arrest in 8 to 10 minutes.

Autopsies on human drowning victims show no indications of these effects and there appears to be little difference between drownings in salt water and fresh water. After death, [[rigor mortis]] will set in and remains for about two days, depending on many factors including water temperature.

===Body's reaction to submersion===
Submerging the face in water colder than about {{convert|21|°C|°F}} triggers the [[mammalian diving reflex]], found in [[mammal]]s, and especially in [[marine mammal]]s such as [[whale]]s and [[Pinniped|seals]]. This reflex protects the body by putting it into ''energy saving'' mode to maximize the time it can stay under water. The strength of this reflex is greater in colder water and has three principal effects:
*''[[Bradycardia]]'', a slowing of the [[heart rate]] by up to 50% in humans.
*''Peripheral [[vasoconstriction]]'', the restriction of the blood flow to the extremities to increase the blood and oxygen supply to the vital organs, especially the [[brain]].
*''Blood Shift'', the shifting of blood to the [[thoracic cavity]], the region of the chest between the diaphragm and the neck, to avoid the collapse of the lungs under higher pressure during deeper dives.

The reflex action is automatic and allows both a conscious and an unconscious person to survive longer without oxygen under water than in a comparable situation on dry land. The exact mechanism for this effect has been debated and may be a result of brain cooling similar to the protective effects seen in patients treated with deep [[hypothermia]].<ref name=uhms1985>{{cite journal |author=Lundgren, Claus EG; Ferrigno, Massimo (eds). |title=Physiology of Breath-hold Diving. 31st Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society Workshop |volume=UHMS Publication Number 72(WS-BH)4-15-87. |publisher=[[Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society]] |year=1985 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7992 |accessdate=2009-04-24}}</ref><!-- topic debated on page 284, large download --><ref name="pmid19231924">{{cite journal |author=Mackensen GB, McDonagh DL, Warner DS |title=Perioperative hypothermia: use and therapeutic implications |journal=J. Neurotrauma |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=342–58 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19231924 |doi=10.1089/neu.2008.0596}}</ref>

===Oxygen deprivation===
A conscious victim will hold his or her breath (see [[Apnea]]) and will try to access air, often resulting in [[panic]], including rapid body movement.  This uses up more oxygen in the blood stream and reduces the time to unconsciousness.  The victim can voluntarily hold his or her breath for some time, but the breathing reflex will increase until the victim will try to breathe, even when submerged{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

The breathing reflex in the human body is weakly related to the amount of [[oxygen]] in the [[blood]] but strongly related to the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] (see [[Hypercapnia]]). During apnea, the oxygen in the body is used by the [[cell (biology)|cells]], and excreted as carbon dioxide.  Thus, the level of oxygen in the blood decreases, and the level of carbon dioxide increases. Increasing carbon dioxide levels lead to a stronger and stronger breathing reflex, up to the ''breath-hold breakpoint'', at which the victim can no longer voluntarily hold his or her breath. This typically occurs at an arterial  [[partial pressure]] of carbon dioxide of 55&nbsp;mm Hg, but may differ significantly from individual to individual and can be increased through training.

The breath-hold break point can be suppressed or delayed either intentionally or unintentionally.  [[Hyperventilation]] before any dive, deep or shallow, flushes out carbon dioxide in the blood resulting in a dive commencing with an abnormally low carbon dioxide level; a potentially dangerous condition known as [[hypocapnia]].  The level of carbon dioxide in the blood after hyperventilation may then be insufficient to trigger the breathing reflex later in the dive and a blackout may occur without warning and before the diver feels any urgent need to breathe.  This can occur at any depth and is common in distance breath-hold divers [[shallow water blackout|in swimming pools]].  Hyperventilation is often used by both deep and distance free-divers to flush out carbon dioxide from the lungs to suppress the breathing reflex for longer. It is important not to mistake this for an attempt to increase the body's oxygen store.  The body at rest is fully oxygenated  by normal breathing and cannot take on any more.  Breath holding in water should always be supervised by a second person, as by hyperventilating, one increases the risk of shallow water blackout because insufficient carbon dioxide levels in the blood fail to trigger the breathing reflex.

=== Water inhalation ===
If water enters the [[airway]]s of a conscious victim, the victim will try to cough up the water or swallow it, thus inhaling more water involuntarily.  Upon water entering the airways, both conscious and unconscious victims experience [[laryngospasm]], that is the [[larynx]] or the [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] in the throat constrict and seal the [[vertebrate trachea|air tube]].  This prevents water from entering the [[lung]]s. Because of this laryngospasm, water enters the stomach in the initial phase of drowning and very little water enters the lungs. Unfortunately, this can interfere with air entering the lungs, too. In most victims, the laryngospasm relaxes some time after unconsciousness and water can enter the lungs causing a "wet drowning".  However, about 10-15% of victims maintain this seal until [[cardiac arrest]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} This is called "[[dry drowning]]", as no water enters the lungs.  In [[forensic pathology]], water in the lungs indicates that the victim was still alive at the point of submersion. Absence of water in the lungs may be either a dry drowning or indicates a death before submersion{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

==Management==
Rescue involves bringing the person's mouth and nose above the water surface. A drowning person may cling to the rescuer and try to pull himself out of the water, submerging the rescuer in the process. Thus it is advised that the rescuer approach with a [[buoyancy|buoyant]] object, or from behind, twisting the person's arm on the back to restrict movement. If the rescuer does get pushed under water, they should dive downwards to escape the person.

After a successful approach, negatively buoyant objects such as a weight belt are removed. The priority is then to transport the person to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The person is turned on their back with a secure grip used to tow from behind. If the person is cooperative they may be towed in a similar fashion held at the armpits. If the person is unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose are well above the water.

Special care has to be taken for people with suspected spinal injuries, and a back board (spinal board) may be needed for the rescue. In water, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] is ineffective, and the goal should be to bring the person to a stable ground quickly and then to start CPR. Once on ground chest compressions are performed by the A-B-C scheme (Airway openining-Breaths-Compressions).<ref>http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@ecc/documents/downloadable/ucm_317350.pdf</ref>  100% oxygen is neither recommended nor discouraged.<ref>{{cite journal| authorlink = ILCOR| date =  November 29, 2005 |   title = 2005 ILCOR resuscitation guidelines| journal = Circulation| volume = 112| issue = 22 supplement| doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166480| url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/112/22_suppl/III-115.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2008-02-17| quote = There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of oxygen by the first aid provider.| doi_brokendate = 2008-06-28}}</ref> Treatment for [[hypothermia]] may also be necessary.

The [[Heimlich maneuver]] is not recommended;<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000046.htm</ref> the technique may have relevance in situations where airways are obstructed by solids but not fluids. Performing the maneuver on drowning people not only delays ventilation but may induce vomiting, which if [[wikt:aspirated|aspirated]] will place the patient in a far worse situation. Moreover, the use of the Heimlich maneuver in any choking situation involving solids or fluids has become controversial and is generally no longer taught.  For more information on this debate refer to the article [[Henry Heimlich]].

Because of the mammalian diving reflex (see above), person submerged in cold water and apparently drowned may revive after a relatively long period.  Rescuers retrieving an apparently dead person from water significantly below body temperature should not consider the rescued person dead until he or she is warm and dead.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Surveillance===
Many pools and designated bathing areas either have lifeguards, a [[pool safety camera]] system for local or remote monitoring, or computer aided drowning detection.  However, bystanders play an important role in drowning detection and either intervention or the notification of authorities by phone or alarm.

=== RID factors ===
{{main|Lifeguard#Operational management (RID factors)}}
The [[acronym]] ''RID'' was originated by [[Frank Pia]] to summarize important reasons why [[lifeguard]]s may be unaware of a drowning. The term stands for "failure to '''Recognize''' the [victim's] struggle, the '''Intrusion''' of non-lifeguard duties upon lifeguards' primary task-preventive lifeguarding, and the '''Distraction''' from surveillance duties".<ref name="RID">{{cite web | url=pia-enterprises.com/rid.rtf | title=The RID factor as a cause of drowning | accessdate=October 1, 2012 | author=Pia, Frank}} - published June 1984, ''Parks & Recreation''</ref>  In his paper on the RID factors,<ref name="RID" /> Pia makes a number of observations on the role, and the required behavior and training, of lifeguards, as well as the importance of administrators directing lifeguards to this role and avoiding double tasking them (due to the very brief time of 20 – 60 seconds required for drowning to occur). He ended by summarizing the role of lifeguards as guardians of life, and that they should be directed exclusively to this duty and none other, while on surveillance, due to the high value placed on human life.

==Society and culture==
In Europe, drowning was used as capital punishment. In fact, during the Middle Ages, a sentence of death was read using the words "''cum fossa et furca''", or "with drowning-pit and gallows." Furthermore, drowning was used as a way to determine if a woman were a witch. The idea was that witches would float and innocent women would drown. For more details, see [[trial by drowning]]. It is understood that drowning was used as the least brutal form of execution, and was therefore reserved primarily for women, although favored men were executed in this way, as well.

Drowning survived as a method of execution in Europe until the 17th and 18th centuries. England had abolished the practice by 1623, Scotland by 1685, Switzerland in 1652, Austria in 1776, Iceland in 1777, and Russia by the beginning of the 1800s. France revived the practice during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) and was carried out by [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]] at [[Nantes]].<ref>{{cite journal
