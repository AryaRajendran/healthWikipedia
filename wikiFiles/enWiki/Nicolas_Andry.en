'''Nicolas Andry de Bois-Regard''' (1658 – 13 May 1742) was a French physician and writer. He played a significant role in the early history of both [[parasitology]] and [[orthopedics]], the name for which is taken from Andry's book ''Orthopédie''.

==Early life and career==
Andry was born in [[Lyon]], and spent his early life preparing for the priesthood.<ref name="Peltier">{{cite book|last=Peltier|first=Leonard F.|title=Orthopedics: a History and Iconography|publisher=Norman Publishing|location=San Francisco|year=1993|pages=21–23|isbn=978-0-930405-47-2}}</ref> His early studies were widespread, however, and he published a book on the usage of the [[French language]] in 1692.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andry|first=Nicolas|title=Reflexions ou Remarques critiques sur l'usage present de la langue françoise|publisher=Chez Laurent d'Houry|location=Paris|year=1692}}</ref>
In his 30s he studied medicine at [[Reims]] and [[Paris]], receiving his degree in 1697, and in 1701 he was appointed to the faculty of the [[Collège de France]] and the editorial board of the ''[[Journal des sçavans|Journal des savants]]''.<ref name="Peltier"/>

==Worms==
[[File:Title page of Andry Breeding of Worms.jpg|thumb|Title page of the English translation of Andry's ''Breeding of Worms'']]
Andry's early medical work lies within the nascent [[germ theory of disease]]. His first book, ''De la génération des vers dans les corps de l'homme'', was published in 1700, and translated into English in 1701 as ''An Account of the Breeding of Worms in Human Bodies''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andry|first=Nicolas|title=An account of the breeding of worms in human bodies; their nature, and several sorts; their effects, symptoms, and prognostics. With the true means to avoid them, and med'cines to cure them, / by Nicholas Andry ... with letters to the author on this subject from M. Nicholas Hartsoeker at Amsterdam, and M. George Baglivi at Rome|publisher=Printed for H. Rhodes and A. Bell|location=London|year=1701}}</ref> The book was an account of Andry's experiments with the [[microscope]], building on the earlier work of [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], whom Andry cites frequently. Unlike Leeuwenhoek, Andry's purpose is specifically medical, and his experiments with the microscope led him to believe that the microorganisms he called "worms" were responsible for [[smallpox]] and other diseases.<ref>"The History of the Germ Theory," ''The British Medical Journal'' vol. 1 no. 1415 (1888), p.312.</ref>
[[File:Nicolas Andry illustrations of microorganisms.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrations drawn from microscopic observation, from ''Breeding of Worms'']]
The book contains a detailed discussion of [[spermatazoa]], which Andry calls "spermatic worms." He observes: "If you cut up a dog, and after you have taken off one Testicle, by the help of a Microscope examine the Humour that comes out of the [[vas deferens|deferent vessel]], you shall discover in it such a hideous number of little worms, that you shall hardly be able to believe your own Eyes."<ref>''An Account of the Breeding of Worms in Human Bodies,'' London, 1701, p. 279, quoted in R. C. Punnet, "Ovists and Animalculists," ''The American Naturalist'' vol. 62 no. 683 (1928), p. 491.</ref> Andry confirms an argument previously made by Leeuwenhoek, that spermatazoa are "the occasion of the Generation of all Animals."<ref name="Correia">{{cite book|last=Correia|first=Clara Pinto|title=The Ovary of Eve: Egg and Sperm and Preformation|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=1997|pages=74–76|isbn=978-0-226-66952-6}}</ref>Though Andry recognizes the importance of sperm to reproduction, however, he addresses their workings primarily in the context of parasitology, and essentially considers spermatazoa to be a unique species of parasitic worm.<ref>Punnet, 493-94.</ref>

The book seems to address a general audience in addition to a medical one. As medical historian Clara Pinto Correia has observed, one of Andry's principal purposes was to educate the public about the new science that was emerging from under the microscope. He wrote, "We must admit that there are animals a thousand times less than a grain of dust, which we can scarcely see. [...] Our imagination loses itself in this thought, it is amazed at such a strange littleness; but to what purpose should it deny it? Reason convinces us of the existence of that which we cannot conceive."<ref name="Correia"/>

The book was well-received, and became a standard text in the field.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gee|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Gee|title=Jacob's Ladder: The History of the Human Genome|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|year=2004|pages=35–36|isbn=978-0-393-05083-7}}</ref> Andry was appointed Dean of the [[Faculté de Médecine de Paris]] in 1724.<ref name="Peltier"/>

==Orthopaedia==
Andry published his introduction to orthopedics in 1741 under the title ''Orthopédie'', then a [[neologism]]. It was translated into English in 1743 as ''Orthopaedia.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Andry|first=Nicolas|title=Orthopaedia : or, the art of correcting and preventing deformities in children: by such means, as may easily be put in practice by parents themselves, and all such as are employed in educating children. To which is added, a defence of the orthopaedia, by way of supplement / by the author. Translated from the French of M. Andry|publisher=Printed for A. Millar|location=London|year=1743}}</ref> Aimed more at parents than physicians, the book presents a theory of human anatomy, skeletal structure, and growth, along with instructions for correcting deformity. Andry explains in the book that he formed its title "of two Greek Words, viz. Orthos, which signifies streight, free from deformity, and Pais, a Child. Out of these two words I have compounded that of Orthopaedia, to express in one Term the Design I Propose, which is to teach the different Methods of preventing and correction of Deformities of Children."<ref>From ''Orthopaedia'', quoted in F. N. L. Poynter, "Christener of Orthopaedics" (review of a facsimile edition of ''Orthopaedia''), ''The British Medical Journal'', Vol. 2, No. 5248 (1961), p. 360.</ref>
[[File:Andry tree.png|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Orthopaedia'']]
Though the book was read and cited extensively in the period, its main lasting influence in medicine has been its title, which became the name of the field devoted to skeletal and related injuries and ailments (later modified to "orthopaedics" or, in American spelling, "orthopedics").<ref name="Kirkup">J. B. Kirkup, "[http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/reprint/73-B/3/361 Nicolas Andry and 250 years of orthopaedy]," ''The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery'', vol. 73-B, no. 2 (1991), 361–362.</ref> Outside of medicine, the principal impact of the book derives from the engraving on the frontispiece, which shows a straight stake tied to a crooked [[sapling]], a metaphor for the correction of deformities in children. The engraving captured the attention of contemporary readers; it is referred to, for example, in [[George Colman the Younger|George Colman]]'s 1787 comic opera ''[[Inkle and Yarico]]''.<ref>Daniel O'Quinn, "Mercantile Deformities: George Colman's ''Inkle and Yarico'' and the Racialization of Class Relations," ''Theatre Journal'' 54 (2002), 396.</ref>

Andry's frontispiece has played a significant role in the [[cultural studies]] of eighteenth-century medicine. It is included, without comment, as the last in a series of ten eighteenth- and nineteenth-century illustrations in [[Michel Foucault]]'s influential study of the history of correction, ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|coauthors=trans. [[Alan Sheridan]]|title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison|publisher=Vintage|location=New York|year=1977|isbn=978-0-679-75255-4}}</ref> Scholar Paolo Palladino has explained Foucault's use of the image as showing that "practices as disparate as orthopedics and horticulture were increasingly predicated on operative principles that focused on the manipulation of these different life forms' presumed common material substance. Moreover, the image raises questions of agency, since it is unclear who exactly bound the tree: no human or divine form is visible anywhere in the background; the image therefore accorded with Foucault's understanding that the operation of these principles was invisible and pervasive."<ref>Paolo Palladino, "Life ... On Biology, Biography, and Bio-power in the Age of Genetic Engineering," ''Configurations'' 11 (2003), 82.</ref>

A simplified version of Andry's illustration continues to serve as the international symbol for orthopedics, used by a number of different institutions in multiple countries.<ref name="Kirkup"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaos.org/about/about.asp|title=About the AAOS|coauthors=The American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref>

==Modern recognition==
In conjunction with ''[[Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research]]'', the [[Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons]] presents three awards annually including the Nicolas Andry Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abjs.org/awards.asp |title=Awards |author=Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year=2007 |work=http://www.abjs.org/ |publisher=Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons |location=Rosemont, Illinois |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>
