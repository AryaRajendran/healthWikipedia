A '''stapedectomy''' is a surgical procedure of the [[middle ear]] performed to improve hearing.

If the [[stapes]] footplate is fixed in position, rather than being normally mobile, then a [[conductive hearing loss]] results. There are two major causes of stapes fixation. The first is a disease process of abnormal mineralization of the temporal bone called [[otosclerosis]]. The second is a congenital [[malformation of the stapes]].

In both of these situations, it is possible to improve hearing by removing the stapes bone and replacing it with a micro prosthesis - a '''stapedectomy''', or creating a small hole in the fixed stapes footplace and inserting a tiny, piston-like [[prosthesis]] - a '''stapedotomy'''. The results of this surgery are generally most reliable in patients whose stapes has lost mobility because of [[otosclerosis]]. Nine out of ten patients who undergo the procedure will come out with significantly improved hearing while less than 1% will experience worsened hearing ability or [[deafness]]. Successful surgery usually provides an increase in hearing ability of about 20 dB. That is as much difference as having your hands over both ears, or not. However, most of the published results of success fall within the speech frequency of 500&nbsp;Hz, 1000&nbsp;Hz and 2000&nbsp;Hz; poorer results are typically obtained in the high frequencies, but these are normally less hampered by otosclerosis in the first place.<ref>{{citation |last=R|first=Raman|title=Poor High Frequency Results Following Total Stapedectomy Theoretical Considerations |journal=Indian Journal of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery|volume=35 |issue=1 |year=1983 }}</ref>

==Indications==
Indications of stapedectomy:
# Conductive hearing loss (due to fixation of stapes).
# Air bone gap of at least 30 dB.
# Presence of Carhart's notch in the audiogram of a patient with conductive hearing loss (relative)
# Good cochlear reserve as assessed by the presence of good speech discrimination.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications for stapedectomy:
* Poor general condition of the patient.
* Only hearing ear.
* Poor cochlear reserve as shown by poor speech discrimination scores
* Patient with tinnitus and vertigo
* Presence of active otosclerotic foci (otospongiosis) as evidenced by a positive flemmingo sign.
* Conductive deafness due to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)

==Complications==
Complications of stapedectomy:
* Facial palsy
* Vertigo in the immediate post op period
* Vomiting
* Perilymph gush
* Floating foot plate
* Tympanic membrane tear
* Dead labyrinth
* Perilymph fistula
* Labyrinthitis
* Granuloma (Reparative)
* Tinnitus
When a stapedectomy is done in a middle ear with a congenitally fixed footplate, the results may be excellent but the risk of hearing damage is greater than when the stapes bone is removed and replaced (for otosclerosis). This is primarily due to the risk of additional anomalies being present in the congenitally abnormal ear. If high pressure within the fluid compartment that lies just below the stapes footplate exists, then a [[perilymphatic gusher]] may occur when the stapes is removed. Even without immediate complications during surgery, there is always concern of a [[perilymph fistula]] forming postoperatively.  In a landmark article by Glasscock et al.  the overall complication rate for stapedectomy was found to be 45% with a 10% rate of dead ears.

==Stapedotomy==
A modified stapes operation, called a '''stapedotomy''', is thought by many otologic surgeons to be safer and reduce the chances of postoperative complications. In stapedotomy, instead of removing the whole stapes footplace, a tiny hole is made in the footplate - either with a microdrill or with a [[laser]],<ref>{{citation |last=Perkins |first=Rodney C. |title=Laser Stapedotomy for Otosclerosis |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=228–241 |year=1980 |doi=10.1288/00005537-198002000-00007}}</ref> and a [[prosthesis]] is placed to touch this area with movement of the [[tympanic membrane]]. This procedure can be further improved by the use of a tissue graft seal of the fenestra, which is now common practice.<ref name=dSG2004>{{citation |last=de Souza |last2= Glassock |title=Otosclerosis and Stapedectomy |year=2004 |isbn=1-58890-169-6 |publisher=Thieme |location=New York, NY}}</ref>

Laser stapedotomy is a well-established surgical technique for treating conductive hearing loss due to otosclerosis. The procedure creates a tiny opening in the stapes (the smallest bone in the human body) in which to secure a prosthetic. The CO<sub>2</sub> laser allows the surgeon to create very small, precisely placed holes without increasing the temperature of the inner ear fluid by more than one degree, making this an extremely safe surgical solution. The hole diameter can be predetermined according to the prosthesis diameter. Treatment can be completed in a single operation visit using anesthesia, normally followed by one or two nights' hospitalization with subsequent at-home recovery time a matter of days or weeks.

==Stapedectomy vs. stapedotomy==
Comparisons have shown stapedotomy to yield either as good<ref>Sedwick JD, Louden CL & Shelton C, Stapedectomy vs stapedotomy: Do you really need a laser? Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg., 123(2):177-180, 1997.</ref> or better<ref>Motta G, Ruosi M & Motta S, Stapedotomy vs stapedectomy: Comparison of hearing results, Acta Otorhinolaryngologica, 16(2 Suppl 53): 36-41, 1996)</ref> results than stapedectomy (measured by hearing improvement and reduction in the [[pure tone audiometry|air-bone hearing gap]], and especially at higher [[audio frequency|sound frequencies]]), and to be less prone to complications.<ref>Thamjarayakul T, Supiyaphun P & Snidvongs K, Stapes fixation surgery: Stapedectomy versus stapedotomy, Asian Biomedicine, 4(3): 429-434, 2010.</ref> In particular, stapedotomy procedure greatly reduces the chance of a [[perilymph fistula]] (leakage of cochlear fluid).<ref name=dSG2004/>

Stapedotomy, like stapedectomy, can be successful in the presence of sclerotic [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] (tissue growths abnormally linking the bones to the [[tympanic cavity]]), provided the adhesions are removed during surgery. However, the adhesions may recur over time. The stapedotomy method is not applicable in those relatively rare cases that involve scleroris of the entire ossicular chain.

Because it is a simpler and safer procedure, stapedotomy is normally preferred to stapedectomy in the absence of predictable complications. However, the success rate of either surgery depends greatly on the skill and the familiarity with the procedure of the surgeon.<ref name=dSG2004/> Furthermore, a major success factor in both surgeries is correctly determining the length of the prosthesis.<ref>Paum PB, Pollak AM & Fisch U., Utricle, saccule and cochlear duct in relation to stapedotomy: A histologic temporal bone study, Ann Oto Rhinol Laryngol, 12, 1991.</ref><ref>Fisch U, Commentary - stapedotomy versus stapedectomy, Otology & Neurotology, 30(8): 1166-1167, 2009.</ref>

==History==
The world's first stapedectomy is credited to Dr. [[John J. Shea, Jr.|John J.Shea Jr.]] who performed it in May 1956 on a 54-year-old housewife who could no longer hear even with a hearing aid.<ref>{{cite web |title=John J.
