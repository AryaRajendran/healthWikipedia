'''Heinz bodies''' (also referred to as "Heinz-Ehrlich bodies") are inclusions within [[red blood cell]]s composed of denatured [[hemoglobin]].<ref>{{MeshName|Heinz+Bodies}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/65/3/697 "Unstable Hemoglobins: The Role of Heme Loss in Heinz Body Formation"] Jacon, Harry and Winterhalter, Kaspar, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Vol. 64, No3, pp. 697-701, March 1970</ref>  

==History==
They are named after [[Robert Heinz]] (1865-1924), a German physician who in 1890 described these inclusions in connection with cases of [[hemolytic anemia]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|658}}</ref><ref>R. Heinz. Morphologische Veränderungen des roten Blutkörperchens durch Gifte. [Virchows] Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medizin, Berlin, 1890, 122: 112-116.</ref>

==Form and appearance==
[[Image:Heinz bodies cat.jpg|thumb|right|Heinz body stain of feline blood, showing three distinct Heinz bodies.]]Heinz bodies appear as small round inclusions within the red cell body, though they are not visible when stained with [[Romanowsky stain|Romanowsky dye]]s. They appear more clearly when supravitally stained <ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000013613|Heinz bodies,Heinz-Ehrlich bodies}}</ref> (e.g., with [[new methylene blue]] or [[bromocresol green]]).

==Etiology and associated disorders==
Heinz bodies are formed by damage to the [[hemoglobin]] component molecules, usually through oxidant damage, or from an inherited mutation (i.e. change of an internal amino acid residue). As a result, an electron from the hemoglobin is transferred to an oxygen molecule, which creates a [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) that can cause severe cell damage leading to premature cell lysis.<ref>Voet&Voet Biochemistry p340</ref> Damaged cells are cleared by [[macrophage]]s in the [[spleen]], where the precipitate and damaged membrane are removed, leading to characteristic "[[bite cells]]". The denaturing process is irreversible and the continual elimination of damaged cells leads to [[Heinz body anemia]].

There are several pathways leading to the hemoglobin damage. 
* [[NADPH]] deficiency can cause a dysfunction in [[glutathione peroxidase]] which is an enzyme that converts [[hydrogen peroxide]] ([[reactive oxygen species]]) into water.  
* G6PD ([[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]]) deficiency exacerbated by administration of oxidant drugs (e.g., [[primaquine]], [[dapsone]], [[quinidine]]) can also result in Heinz bodies.  G6PD deficient red cells in combination with high levels of oxidants causes a cross-linking of sulfhydryl  groups on globin chains which causes a denaturing and formation of Heinz body precipitates.<ref>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; Aster, Jon (2009-05-28).

* Heinz bodies can also be found in [[chronic liver disease]].<ref name="urlAnemia in Children - October 15, 2001 - American Family Physician">{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20011015/1379.html |title=Anemia in Children - October 15, 2001 - American Family Physician |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
* [[Alpha-thalassemia]].  Normal adult [[hemoglobin]] is composed of two alpha and two beta chains. Alpha thalassemia patients have partial or complete defects in alpha globin production, leading to a relative abundance of beta globin chains in the cell. These excess beta globin chains aggregate to form [[HbH]], which has decreased [[solubility]] and precipitates in the [[red blood cell]] [[cytoplasm]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bunn and Aster|title=Pathophysiology of Blood Disorders|publisher=Lange|isbn=978-0-07-171378-8|pages=92}}</ref> This is not direct damage to hemoglobin per se, but rather a perturbation in the [[quaternary structure]] of hemoglobin.

===Veterinary===
In [[veterinary medicine]], Heinz bodies are associated with the consumption of [[onion]]s by [[cat]]s,<ref>[http://www.monkeyzone.com/anemia.html Anemia caused by onions] Wissman, Margaret A., ''Simian'', date unknown</ref> [[dog]]s, and various [[primate]]s, and a symptom of [[paracetamol]] poisoning in cats. [[Thiosulfate]] compounds in the flesh of onions have been identified as the cause.

[[Propylene glycol]] was once a common ingredient in soft moist cat food. According to the FDA "It was known for some time that [[propylene glycol]] caused Heinz Body formation in the red blood cells of cats (small clumps of proteins seen in the cells when viewed under the microscope), but it could not be shown to cause overt anemia or other clinical effects. However, recent reports in the veterinary literature of scientifically sound studies have shown that propylene glycol reduces the red blood cell survival time, renders red blood cells more susceptible to oxidative damage, and has other adverse effects in cats consuming the substance at levels found in soft-moist food.<ref>[http://www.vet.uga.edu/VPP/CLERK/Tarigo/index.php "Heinz Body Anemia in Cats"] Tarigo-Martinie, Jaime and Krimer, Paula (accessed Sept. 2006)</ref> In light of this new data, CVM amended the regulations to expressly prohibit the use of propylene glycol in cat foods."<ref name="urlPet Food Labels - General">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cvm/petlabel.htm |title=Pet Food Labels - General |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no specific treatment for Heinz bodies; however they are important as a diagnostic indicator for the causative conditions listed above.
