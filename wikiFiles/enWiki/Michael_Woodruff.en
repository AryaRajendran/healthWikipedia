'''Sir Michael Francis Addison Woodruff''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]] (3 April 1911&nbsp;â€“ 10 March 2001) was an English [[surgeon]] and scientist principally remembered for his research into [[organ transplant]]ation. Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees in [[electrical engineering]] and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of [[World War II]], he joined the [[Australian Army Medical Corps]], but was soon captured by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces and imprisoned in the [[Changi Prison|Changi Prison Camp]]. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting [[nutrient]]s from agricultural wastes to prevent [[malnutrition]] among his fellow [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].

At the conclusion of the war, Woodruff returned to England and began a long career as an academic surgeon, mixing [[Clinician|clinical]] work and [[Medical research|research]]. Woodruff principally studied [[transplant rejection]] and [[immunosuppression]].  His work in these areas of transplantation biology, led Woodruff to perform the first [[kidney transplant]] in the United Kingdom, on 30 October 1960. For this and his other scientific contributions, Woodruff was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1968 and made a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1969. Although retiring from surgical work in 1976, he remained an active figure in the scientific community, researching cancer and serving on the boards of various medical and scientific organizations. He died on 10 March 2001, at the age of 89.

== Early life ==
Michael Woodruff was born on 3 April 1911 in [[Mill Hill]], London, England.<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.2005.0030}}</ref> In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a professor of [[veterinary medicine]] at the [[Royal Veterinary College]] in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology.<ref name="frs"/> The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by [[World War I]], which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services. He became an officer in the Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to [[Egypt]].<ref name="frs">Morris, p. 457.</ref> 

The remainder of the Woodruffs returned to London, and the two boys lived with their mother and paternal grandmother in the latter's residence in [[Finchley]]. However, Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their mother, Margaret, died of a [[staphylococcal septicaemia]]. The two then spent a short time under the care of an aunt before being rejoined by their father in 1917.<ref name="frs"/><ref name="NVNW">Woodruff, Michael. ''Nothing Venture Nothing Win''. Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1996. ISBN 0-7073-0737-6.</ref>

In 1919, Harold remarried and his new wife raised the children from his first marriage. The two boys did their early schooling at [[Trinity Grammar School (Victoria)|Trinity Grammar School]] in Melbourne. From then on he spent all of his youth in Australia except for a year in Europe in 1924 when his father went on sabbatical leave at Paris's [[Pasteur Institute]]. During this time, Woodruff and his brother boarded at [[Queen's College, Taunton|Queen's College]] in [[Taunton]], Somerset on the south coast of England. The headmaster at the school derogatorily regarded Australians as "colonials" who were "backward" and put Woodruff in a year level one year lower than appropriate.<ref name=m458/> Upon returning to Australia, Woodruff attended the private Methodist [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]], where he enjoyed mathematics and [[rowing (sport)|rowing]].<ref name=m458>Morris, p. 458.</ref>

He won a government scholarship to the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[Queen's College (University of Melbourne)|Queen's College]], a university residential college.<ref name=m458/> Woodruff studied [[electrical engineering]] and [[mathematics]], receiving some instruction from the influential physicist [[Harrie Massey]], then a tutor.<ref name="frs"/> Despite success in engineering, Woodruff decided that he would have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=o>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-sir-michael-woodruff-728979.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Professor Sir Michael Woodruff | date=31 March 2001 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref> He decided to take up medical studies at the end of his third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class honours.<ref name=m458/>

After graduating in 1933, he entered the medical program at the University of Melbourne. His mentors included Anatomy Professor [[Frederic Wood Jones]]. While at the University, he passed the primary exam for the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1934, one of only four successful candidates who sat the examination in Melbourne that year. He finished the program in 1937 and received an [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MBBS]] with honours as well as two prizes in surgery. After graduation, he studied [[internal medicine]] for one more year, and served as a house surgeon at the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]].<ref name="frs"/> Woodruff then started his surgical training.<ref name=m458/>

== World War II ==
At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Woodruff joined the [[Australian Army Medical Corps]]. He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his [[Master of Surgery]] Degree in 1941. At that time, he was assigned to the Tenth Australian Army General Hospital in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] as a [[captain (OF-2)|captain]] in the Medical Corps. According to Woodruff, his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific was yet to began in earnest. However, after the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] changed the situation and he was posted to a casualty clearing station where he worked as an anaesthetist, before being transferred into the Singapore General Hospital. A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and Woodruff was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British personnel.<ref name=o/><ref name=m459/>

[[Image:Changi chapel at duntroon.jpg|thumb|A chapel built by Australian POWs at the Changi Prison Camp where Woodruff was held during World War II.]]

After being captured, Woodruff was imprisoned in the [[Changi Prison|Changi Prison Camp]]. In the camp, Woodruff realized that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from [[vitamin|vitamin deficiencies]] due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by the Japanese. To help fight this threat, Woodruff asked for permission from the Japanese to allow him to take responsibility for the matter, which was granted.<ref name=m459/> He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass, [[soya bean]]s, [[rice polishing]]s, and agricultural wastes using old machinery that he found at the camp. Woodruff later published an account of his methods through the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] titled "Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps".<ref name="NVNW"/> Woodruff remained a POW for three and a half years and later during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades. As the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred, he had to improvise in his practise.<ref name=m459/> During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that [[skin allograft]]s were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked his interest in doing research on the topic.<ref name=m459>Morris, p. 459.</ref>

At the conclusion of World War II, Woodruff returned to Melbourne to continue his surgical training. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate to [[Albert Coates (surgeon)|Albert Coates]]. This position was unpaid, so Woodruff accepted an appointment was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself.<ref name=m460/> In January 1946, Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from [[Adelaide]]. She made a great impression on Woodruff, and he married her half a year later. The couple were research partners for the rest of their lives.<ref name="frs"/><ref name=m460>Morris, p. 460.</ref>

== Early career ==
Soon after his marriage, Woodruff decided to travel to England in order to take the second half of the [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]] Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with no guarantee of employment, and declined a two-year travelling fellowship to [[Oxford University]] offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return home and work.<ref name=m461>Morris, p. 461.</ref> Before departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the [[University of Sheffield]], and learned en route that they had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passedâ€”a result that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners, Colonel [[Julian Taylor FRCS|Julian Taylor]], had been with him at Changi.<ref name=o/>

=== Sheffield ===
After passing his exam, Woodruff entered his position at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery.<ref name=m461/> Originally, he had planned to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the [[pathology]] laboratory where he studied [[transplant rejection]], a process in which the [[immune system]] of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in [[thyroid]] [[allograft]]s to the [[anterior chamber]] of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection.<ref name=m461/> Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet [[Peter Medawar]], an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed [[organ transplant|transplantation]] and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]].<ref name="frs"/><ref name=m461/>

=== Aberdeen ===
In 1948, shortly after applying for the position in Melbourne,  Woodruff moved from Sheffield to the [[University of Aberdeen]] where he was given a post as a senior lecturer,<ref name=o/> having not known where the Scottish city was beforehand.<ref name=m461/> At Aberdeen, Woodruff was given better laboratory access under Professor Bill Wilson, and was also awarded a grant that allowed his wife to be paid for her services.<ref>Morris, pp. 461â€“462.</ref> He took advantage of this access and his wife's skills as a lab assistant to investigate ''[[in utero]]'' grafts (tissue grafts performed while the recipient was still in the [[womb]]). At the time, the surgical community hypothesized that if a recipient were given ''in utero'' grafts, he would be able to receive tissue from the donor later in life without risk of rejection. Woodruff's experiments with [[brown rat|rats]], however, produced negative results.<ref name=m462/> Woodruff also commenced work on [[antilymphocyte serum]] for [[immunosuppression]], with little initial success.<ref name=m462>Morris, p. 462.</ref>

While in Aberdeen, Woodruff also visited the United States on a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Traveling Fellowship. During the visit, he met many of the leading American surgeons, an experience that increased his own desire to continue his work and research. After returning from the US, Woodruff experimented with the effects of [[cortisone]] and the impact of blood [[antigen]] on rejection. As part of his blood antigen studies, Woodruff found two volunteers with identical blood antigens and arranged for them to exchange [[skin grafting|skin grafts]]. When the grafts were rejected, Woodruff determined that rejection must be controlled by additional factors.<ref name="frs"/><ref name=m462/> In 1951 Woodruff was bestowed a Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his lecture ''The transplantation of homologous tissue and its surgical application''.<ref name=m462/>

=== Dunedin ===
[[Image:Uni of Otago medical school.jpg|thumb|left|The University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, where Woodruff worked from 1953 to 1957.]]

In 1953, Woodruff moved to [[Dunedin]] to take up a position as the Chair of Surgery at the [[University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine]], New Zealand's only [[medical school]] at that time.<ref name=m462/> Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and [[St Andrews University]] in Edinburgh.<ref name=m462/> While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of [[white blood cells]] to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for [[burn (injury)|burn]] treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease ([[graft versus host disease]]).<ref name="frs"/> Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.<ref name=m463>Morris, p. 463.</ref>

== Edinburgh ==
[[Image:Kidtransplant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram illustrating a typical kidney transplant such as those Woodruff performed in Edinburgh.]]

In 1957, Woodruff was appointed to the Chair of Surgical Science at the [[University of Edinburgh]] without requiring an interview.<ref name=m463/> At the university, he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities and his research. He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers who went on to become prominent in their own right, [[Donald Michie]] and [[James Howard]]. As a major part of his research, Woodruff served as the honorary director of a Research Group on Transplantation established by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]].<ref name=m463/>

The research group's principal investigations concerned [[immunological tolerance]] (the body's acceptance of tissues, as opposed to rejection), [[autoimmune haemolytic anaemia]] (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a [[vascular surgery]] program and worked with the use of [[immunotherapy]] as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. However, his most important clinical accomplishments were in [[kidney transplantation]].<ref name="frs"/><ref name=m463/>

Most notably, he performed the first ever kidney transplant in the UK, at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]].<ref name=kidney/> Woodruff had been waiting for the right patient for some time, hoping to find a patient with an [[Twin#Monozygotic twins|identical twin]] to act as the donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The patient that Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year-old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his identical twin brother's kidneys on 30 October 1960.  Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease.<ref name=kidney>[http://renux.dmed.ed.ac.uk/EdREN/Unitbits/historyweb/transplant.html#anchor11506296 "History of Kidney Transplantation in Edinburgh"]. Retrieved 30 November 2008.</ref> Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation.<ref name=m463/> From then until his retirement in 1976, he performed 127 kidney transplants.<ref name=m463/> Also in 1960, Woodruff published ''The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs'', a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote.<ref name="frs"/> He was awarded the 1969 [[Lister Medal]] for his contributions to surgical science.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2387642/?page=1 Lister Medal], Ann R Coll Surg Engl. 1969 August; 45(2): 127.</ref> The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological aspects of individuality'.<ref>{{cite pmid|4393495}}</ref>

The success of Woodruff's clinical transplant programme was recognised and enhanced by funding from the [[Nuffield Foundation]] to construct and open the Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.<ref name=m464>Morris, p. 464.</ref> In 1970 an outbreak of [[hepatitis B]] struck the transplant unit, resulting in the death of several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant
hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed operations.<ref name=m464/> 

Woodruff retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1976 and joined the MRC Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit. He spent the next ten years there, engaged in cancer research with an emphasis on [[tumor immunology]] using [[Corynebacterium parva]]. During that time, Woodruff also published twenty-five papers and two books.<ref name="frs"/> After retiring from his cancer research, Woodruff lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh, traveling occasionally,<ref name="NVNW"/> until his death there on 10 March 2001 at the age of 89.<ref name=o/>

== Legacy ==
Woodruff's contributions to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised a method of implanting a transplanted [[ureter]] in the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that remains one of the world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's contributions to the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with [[Anti-lymphocyte globulin|anti-lymphocyte serum]] has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.<ref name="frs"/>

These important contributions to medicine and biology were first seriously honored in 1968 when Woodruff was elected to be a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. The next year, 1969, Woodruff was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by the Queen, a rare accomplishment for a surgeon. Additionally, numerous medical organizations gave Woodruff honorary membership, including the [[American College of Surgeons]], the American Surgical Association, and the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]]. Woodruff also held office in several scientific organizations, serving as Vice-President of the [[Royal Society]] and President of The Transplantation Society. Finally, Woodruff served for many years as a [[World Health Organization|WHO]] advisor and as a [[visiting professor]] at a number of universities.<ref name=m467>Morris, p. 467.</ref>

Despite his profound influence on transplantation and what [[Peter Morris (surgeon)|Peter Morris]] called "a commanding presence in any gathering",<ref name=m469/> Woodruff was not known for his ability as a lecturer as he had a rather uncertain style of presentation and had a tendency to mumble.<ref name=m469/> Nevertheless Morris said that Woodruff has "a great turn of phrase and a rather wicked sense of humour".<ref name=m469/> Morris concluded that "What is surprising is that he was not successful in producing many surgeons in his own mould, despite the intellectual talent that was entering surgery and especially transplantation in the 1960s. However, his influence in transplantation at all levels was enormous."<ref name=m469/>

=== Publications ===
Woodruff's impact is also apparent in his large volume of publications. In addition to authoring over two hundred scholarly papers, Woodruff wrote seven books during his career, covering numerous aspects of medicine and surgery.

== Personal life ==
The Woodruffs had two sons, followed by a daughter. Their first son completed a medical degree at [[University College London]] and became an ophthalmologist. The two younger children both did their tertiary education at Sheffield University. The second son became a [[civil engineer]] and the daughter completed a science degree in [[botany]].<ref name=m469>Morris, p. 469.</ref>

Woodruff and his wife were avid tennis players and had a  court in their home in Edinburgh.<ref name=m467/> After moving to Edinburgh, Woodruff took up sailing with the Royal Forth Yacht Club, and went on to compete in some races. He owned a boat was known to go sailing on it in the Mediterranean each summer with his wife. During his student years, Woodruff was a keen rower and [[field hockey]] player.<ref name=m469/> 

Woodruff was a lover of classical music, and after taking up the organ at university and learning from A. E Floyd, the organist of [[St Paul's Cathedral]],<ref name=m458/> he became the college organist at Queenâ€™s College in Melbourne; he later learned to play the piano.<ref name=m468/> In his spare time, Woodruff continued to pursue his love of [[pure mathematics]], especially [[number theory]]. He periodically attempted to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], but failed.<ref name=m468>Morris, p. 468.</ref>
