'''Stomatitis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the [[mucous lining]] of any of the structures in the [[mouth]], which may involve the [[cheeks]], [[gums]], [[tongue]], lips, [[throat]], and roof or [[floor of mouth|floor of the mouth]]. The inflammation can be caused by conditions in the mouth itself, such as poor [[oral hygiene]], dietary protein deficiency, poorly fitted [[dentures]], or from mouth burns from hot food or drinks, toxic plants, or by conditions that affect the entire body, such as [[medications]], [[allergic reactions]], radiation therapy, or [[infections]].<ref>{{cite web|year=1969|format=PDF|work=The Reports of the Surgeon General|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/B/L/N/_/nnbbln.pdf|title=Effects of Smoking on Pregnancy|accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

Severe [[iron deficiency anemia]] can lead to stomatitis. Iron is necessary for the upregulation of transcriptional elements for cell replication and repair. Lack of iron can cause the genetic downregulation of these elements, leading to ineffective repair and regeneration of epithelial cells, especially in the mouth and lips. This condition is also prevalent in people who have a deficiency in vitamin B<sub>2</sub> (Riboflavin), B<sub>3</sub> (Niacin), B<sub>6</sub> (Pyridoxine), B<sub>9</sub> (folic acid) or B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamine).

When it also involves an inflammation of the [[gingiva]] (gums), it is called ''[[gingivostomatitis]]''.

It may also be seen in ariboflavinosis (riboflavin deficiency) or [[neutropenia]].

== Angular stomatitis ==

{{main|Angular cheilitis}}

Irritation and [[fissure|fissuring]] in the corners of the lips is termed ''angular stomatitis'' or ''[[angular cheilitis]]''. In children a frequent cause is repeated lip-licking and in adults it may be a sign of underlying [[iron deficiency anemia]], or [[vitamin B]] deficiencies (e.g. B<sub>2</sub>-[[riboflavin]], B<sub>9</sub>-[[folate]] or [[vitamin B12|B<sub>12</sub>]]-[[cobalamin]], which in turn may be evidence of poor diets or malnutrition (e.g. [[celiac disease]]).

Also, angular cheilitis can be caused by a patient's jaws at rest being 'overclosed' due to edentulousness or tooth wear, causing the jaws to come to rest closer together than if the complete/unaffected dentition were present. This causes skin folds around the angle of the mouth which are kept moist by saliva which in turn favours infection; mostly by ''Candida albicans'' or similar species. Treatment usually involves the administration of topical nystatin or similar antifungal agents. Another treatment can be to correct the jaw relationship with dental treatment (e.g. dentures or occlusal adjustment).

==Migratory stomatitis==

{{main|Migratory stomatitis}}

[[Migratory stomatitis]] is a condition in which extensive areas in the [[oral cavity]] [[mucosa]] are affected by annular atrophic red lesions that surrounded by a thin white rim. This is a relatively uncommon form of the [[geographic tongue]] condition that, as opposed to migratory stomatitis, is confined to the dorsal and lateral aspects of the [[tongue]] mucosa only.<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459â€“60 |year=2011 |month=Aug |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0190-9622/PIIS0190962210004883.pdf| format=PDF}}</ref>
