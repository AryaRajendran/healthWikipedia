'''Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)''' is a type of [[immunoprecipitation]] experimental technique used to investigate the interaction between [[protein]]s and [[DNA]] in the cell. It aims to determine whether specific proteins are associated with specific genomic regions, such as [[transcription factor]]s on [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s or other [[DNA binding site]]s, and possibly defining [[cistrome]]s. ChIP also aims to determine the specific location in the genome that various [[histone]] modifications are associated with, indicating the target of the histone modifiers.<ref name="pmid20077036">{{cite journal

Briefly, the method is as follows: protein and associated [[chromatin]] in a [[Cell disruption|cell lysate]] are temporarily bonded, the DNA-protein complexes (chromatin-protein) are then sheared and DNA fragments associated with the protein(s) of interest are selectively immunoprecipitated, and the associated DNA fragments are purified and their sequence is determined. These DNA sequences are supposed to be associated with the protein of interest ''in vivo''.

==Typical ChIP==
There are mainly two types of ChIP, primarily differing in the starting chromatin preparation. The first uses reversibly [[cross-link]]ed chromatin sheared by [[sonication]] called cross-linked ChIP (XChIP). Native ChIP (NChIP) uses native chromatin sheared by [[Micrococcus|micrococcal]] [[nuclease]] digestion.

===Cross-linked ChIP (XChIP)===
Cross-linked ChIP is mainly suited for mapping the DNA target of transcription factors or other chromatin-associated proteins, and uses reversibly cross-linked chromatin as starting material.  The agent for reversible cross-linking could be [[formaldehyde]]<ref name="pmid569554">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  Chromatin fragments of 400 - 500bp have proven to be suitable for ChIP assays as they cover two to three [[nucleosome]]s.

Cell debris in the sheared lysate is then cleared by sedimentation and protein–DNA complexes are selectively immunoprecipitated using specific [[antibodies]] to the protein(s) of interest. The antibodies are commonly coupled to [[agarose]], [[sepharose]] or magnetic beads. The immunoprecipitated complexes (i.e., the bead–antibody–protein–target DNA sequence complex) are then collected and washed to remove non-specifically bound chromatin, the protein–DNA cross-link is reversed and proteins are removed by digestion with [[proteinase K]]. An [[epitope]]-tagged version of the protein of interest, or ''in vivo'' biotinylation <ref>Viens A et al. "Use of protein biotinylation in vivo for chromatin immunoprecipitation" (2004) ''Analytical Biochemistry'' '''325'''(1):68-76 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14715286]</ref> can be used instead of antibodies to the native protein of interest. 

The DNA associated with the complex is then purified and identified by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[microarrays]] ([[ChIP-on-chip]]), molecular cloning and sequencing, or direct high-throughput sequencing ([[Chip-Sequencing|ChIP-Seq]]).

===Native ChIP (NChIP)===
Native ChIP is mainly suited for mapping the DNA target of [[histone]] modifiers. Generally, native chromatin is used as starting chromatin. As histones wrap around DNA to form nucleosomes, they are naturally linked. Then the chromatin is sheared by micrococcal nuclease digestion, which cuts DNA at the length of the linker, leaving nucleosomes intact and providing DNA fragments of one nucleosome (200bp) to five nucleosomes (1000bp) in length.

Thereafter, methods similar to XChIP are used for clearing the cell debris, immunoprecipitating the protein of interest, removing protein from the immunoprecipated complex, and purifying and analyzing the complex-associated DNA.

===Comparison of XChIP and NChIP===
The major advantage for NChIP is [[antibody]] specificity. It is important to note that most antibodies to modified histones are raised against unfixed, synthetic peptide antigens and that the [[epitope]]s they need to recognize in the XChIP may be disrupted or destroyed by formaldehyde cross-linking, particularly as the cross-links are likely to involve [[lysine]] e-amino groups in the N-terminals, disrupting the epitopes. This is likely to explain the consistently low efficiency of XChIP protocols compare to NChIP.

But XChIP and NChIP have different aims and advantages relative to each other. XChIP is for mapping target sites of transcription factors and other chromatin associated proteins; NChIP is for mapping target sites of histone modifiers (see Table 1).

==History and New ChIP methods==
In 1984 [[John T. Lis]] and David Gilmour, at the time a graduate student in the Lis lab, used UV irradiation to covalently cross-link proteins in contact with neighboring DNA in intact living bacterial cells. Following lysis of cross-linked cells and immunoprecipitation of bacterial RNA polymerase, DNA associated with enriched RNA polymerase was hybridized to probes corresponding to different regions of known genes to determine the in vivo distribution and density of RNA polymerase at these genes. A year later they used the same methodology to study distribution of eukaryotic [[RNA polymerase II]] on fruit fly heat shock genes. These reports could perhaps be considered the pioneering work in the field of chromatin immunoprecipitation.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6379641 ]</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3018544 ]</ref> XChIP was further modified and developed by [[Alexander Varshavsky]] and co-workers, who examined distribution of [[histone H4]] on [[heat shock genes]] using formaldehyde cross-linking.<ref name="pmid18708349">{{cite journal

* '''Carrier ChIP''' (CChIP): This approach could use as few as 100 cells by adding ''[[Drosophila]]'' cells as carrier chromatin to reduce loss and facilitate precipitation of the target chromatin. However, it demands highly specific primers for detection of the target cell chromatin from the foreign carrier chromatin background, and it takes two to three days.<ref name="pmid16767102">{{cite journal

==Limitations of ChIP==
* Large Scale assays using ChIP is challenging using intact model organisms. This is because antibodies have to be generated for each TF, or, alternatively, transgenic model organisms expressing epitope-tagged TFs need to be produced.

* Researchers studying Differential gene expression Patterns in Small organisms also faces problems as genes expressed at low levels, in a small number of cells, in narrow time window.

* ChIP experiments cannot discriminate between different TF isoforms([[Protein isoform]]).
