'''Passive-aggressive behavior''' is a general term used in many contexts.

According to some, passive-aggressive behavior can manifest itself as [[learned helplessness]] (in which an organism has learned to be helpless because proactive behavior is useless), [[procrastination]], hostile jokes (though jokes in general are recognized as a method of expressing veiled hostility), stubbornness, resentment, sullenness, or deliberate/repeated failure to accomplish requested tasks for which one is (often explicitly) responsible.{{Sfn | Wetzler | 1992 | pp = 35–37}}

==Concept in different areas==
===In psychology===
In psychology, passive-aggressive behavior is characterised by a habitual pattern of passive resistance to expected work requirements, opposition, stubborness, and negativistic attitudes in response to requirements for normal performance levels expected of others.  It occurs in the workplace or [[interpersonal]] contexts but behavior is not considered passive-aggressive if exhibited during a [[Major Depressive Episode]] or cannot be attributed to [[Dysthymic Disorder]]. Most frequently it occurs in the workplace where resistance is exhibited by such indirect behaviors as [[procrastination]], [[forgetfulness]], and purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by authority figures.<ref name=dsmiv733>{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatic Association|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0890420629|page=733}}</ref>

===In social protest===
Passive-aggressive behavior, although very similar, is not the same as [[passive resistance]] exhibited in groups by social protesters, although the dynamics are similar. The [[nonviolent resistance]]r is working to defeat demands for social behavior required by others as a method of defiance of authority figures. The person characterized by passive-aggressive behavior is not working with others toward a defined social goal. 
===In conflict theory===
In [[conflict theory]] passive resistance is a rational response to demands that may simply be disagreed with.  Passive-aggressive behavior should also not be confused with covert aggression (a behavior better described as [[wiktionary:catty|catty]]), which consists of deliberate, active, but carefully veiled hostile acts and is distinctively different in character from the non-assertive style of passive aggression.<ref>{{Citation|last=Simon|first=George|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People|year=2010|publisher=Parkhurst Brothers|location=Little Rock|isbn=978-1-935166-30-6| pages = 21–22 |url = http://www.pbros.net/}}</ref>

=== In the workplace ===
{{Main|Workplace conflict}}
Passive-aggressive behavior from workers and managers is damaging to team unity and productivity. Warner in the ad for his online ebook says: "The worst case of passive-aggressive behavior involves destructive attitudes such as negativity, sullenness, resentment, procrastination, 'forgetting' to do something, chronic lateness, and intentional inefficiency." He advises that though the temptation for a worker may be to quit the job: "Stay and fight back: Engage in guerrilla tactics to counteract passive aggression and defend your own work".<ref>{{Citation | first = Neil | last = Warner | title = Manage Passive Aggression In The Workplace |publisher=passiveaggressive.com| url = http://passiveaggressiveworkplace.com/}}.</ref>  If this behavior is ignored it could result in decreased office efficiency and frustration among workers.<ref>{{Citation | last = Harms | first = Kimberly A | title = Passive Aggressive Behaviour in the Dental Office | edition = 3 | year = 2012 | month = May-June,}}.</ref> If managers are passive-aggressive in their behavior, it can end up stifling team creativity. De Angelis says "It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes."<ref>{{Citation | last = De Angelis | first = Paula | title = Blindsided: Recognizing and Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Leadership in the Workplace | edition = Kindle | year = 2008 | month = Jun 22}}.</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}}

=== DSM-IV Appendix B ===
{{Personality disorders sidebar}}Passive-aggressive [[personality disorder]] was listed as an [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Multi-axial_system|Axis II]] personality disorder in the [[DSM-III-R]], but was moved in the DSM-IV to Appendix B ("Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study") because of controversy and the need for further research on how to also categorize the behaviors in a future edition. According to DSM-IV, passive-aggressive personality disorder is "often overtly ambivalent, wavering indecisively from one course of action to its opposite. They may follow an erratic path that causes endless wrangles with others and disappointment for themselves." Characteristic of these persons in an "intense conflict dependence on other and the desire for self-assertion." Although exhibiting supperficial bravado, their self confidence is often very poor, and others react to them with hostility and negativity.<ref name=dsmiv734>{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatic Association|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0890420629|page=734}}</ref><ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Passive-aggressive+personality+disorder-diagnostic+criteria Diagnostic criteria at The Free Dictionary]</ref>

=== Millon's subtypes ===
The psychologist [[Theodore Millon]] has proposed four subtypes of 'negativist' ('passive-aggressive').<ref name="millon3">{{Citation | last = Millon | first = Theodore | title = Personality Disorders in Modern Life | year = 2004}}.</ref> Any individual negativist may exhibit none or one of the following:

== Causes ==
Passive-aggressive disorder may stem from a specific childhood stimulus<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Johnson | first1 = JG | last2 = Cohen | first2 = P | last3 = Brown | first3 = J | last4 = Smailes | first4 = EM | last5 = Bernstein | first5 = DP |title=Childhood maltreatment increases risk for personality disorders during early adulthood |journal=Arch.

Psychiatry |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=600–6 |date=July 1999 |pmid= 10401504 |doi= 10.1001/archpsyc.56.7.600}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=April 2013}} (e.g., alcohol/drug addicted parents) in an environment where it was not safe to express frustration or anger.  Families in which the honest expression of feelings is forbidden tend to teach children to repress and deny their feelings and to use [[sublimation (psychology)|other channels]] to express their frustration.

Children who sugarcoat hostility may have difficulties being assertive. Never developing better coping strategies or skills for self-expression, they can become adults who, beneath a "seductive veneer", "harbor vindictive intent", in the words of a US congressman psychologist and a writer/practicing therapist.<ref>{{Citation |first1 =Murphy | last1 = Tim | last2 = Hoff Oberlin | first2 = Loriann |year=2005 |title=Overcoming passive aggression: how to stop hidden anger from spoiling your relationships, career and happiness |publisher=Marlowe & Company |location=New York |isbn=1-56924-361-1 |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=rT9902F91j4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Overcoming+passive+aggression:+how+to+stop+hidden+anger+from+spoiling+your+relationships,+career+and+happiness&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false | page = 48}}</ref> Alternatively individuals may simply have difficulty being as directly aggressive or assertive as others. Martin Kantor suggests three areas that contribute to passive-aggressive anger in individuals: conflicts about dependency, control, and competition.{{Sfn | Kantor | 2002 | pp = xvi–xvii}}  

[[Timothy_F._Murphy|Murphy]] and [[Loriann_Oberlin|Oberlin]] also see passive aggression as part of a larger umbrella of hidden anger stemming from ten traits of the angry child or adult.  These traits include making one's own misery, the inability to analyze problems, blaming others, turning bad feelings into mad ones, attacking people, lacking empathy, using anger to gain power, confusing anger with self-esteem, and indulging in negative self-talk.  Lastly, the authors point out that those who hide their anger can be nice when they wish to be.<ref>Tim, Murphy; Hoff Oberlin, Loriann (2005).</ref>

== Treatment ==
Kantor suggests a treatment approach using [[psychodynamic therapy|psychodynamic]], [[supportive psychotherapy|supportive]], [[cognitive therapy|cognitive]], [[behavioral therapy|behavioral]] and [[interpersonal therapy|interpersonal]] therapeutic methods. These methods apply to both the passive-aggressive person and their target victim, according to Kantor, a retired Staff Psychiatrist for the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in New Jersey.{{Sfn | Kantor | 2002 | p = 115}}

== History ==
Passive-aggressive behavior was first defined clinically by Colonel [[William Menninger]] during [[World War II]] in the context of men's reaction to military compliance.

Menninger described soldiers who were not openly defiant but expressed their aggressiveness “by passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism” due to what Menninger saw as an "immaturity" and a reaction to "routine military stress".<ref name="Lane"/>

According to some psychoanalytic views, noncompliance is not indicative of true passive-aggressive behavior, which may instead be defined as the manifestation of emotions that have been repressed based on a self-imposed need for acceptance.

In the first version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-I .281952.29|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', DSM-I, in 1952, the passive-aggressive was defined in a narrow way, grouped together with the [[dependent personality disorder|passive-dependent]].

The DSM-III-R stated in 1987 that passive-aggressive disorder is typified by, among other things, "fail[ing] to do the laundry or to stock the kitchen with food because of procrastination and dawdling."<ref name="Lane">{{Citation|last = Lane | first=C |title=The Surprising History of Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder|journal=Theory & Psychology|date=1 February 2009|volume=19|issue=1|pages=55–70|doi= 10.1177/0959354308101419| format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.christopherlane.org/documents/Lane.PAPDisorder.pdf}}</ref>

A popular loosening of the definition of the term to include anything that's conveyed in written form has led to popular websites like ''[[Passive-Aggressive Notes]]'' that post and share purportedly passive-aggressive emails and notes.
