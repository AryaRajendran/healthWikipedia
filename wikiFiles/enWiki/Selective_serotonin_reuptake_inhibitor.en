SSRIs are believed to increase the [[extracellular]] level of the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] by [[Reuptake inhibitor|inhibiting]] its [[reuptake]] into the [[presynaptic cell]], increasing the level of [[serotonin]] in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the [[postsynaptic receptor]]. They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other [[monoamine transporter]]s, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the [[norepinephrine transporter|noradrenaline]] and [[dopamine transporter]].

SSRIs are the first class of [[psychotropic drugs]] discovered using the process called  ''[[Drug design#Rational drug discovery|rational drug design]]'', a process that starts with a specific biological target and then creates a molecule designed to affect it.<ref name="PRESCORN2004"/> They are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries.<ref name="PRESCORN2004">{{Cite book|author=Preskorn SH, Ross R, Stanga CY |chapter=Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=sO_hArhCxwMC&pg=PA241 |editor=Sheldon H.

==Medical uses==
The main indication for SSRIs is [[clinical depression]]. SSRIs are frequently prescribed for [[anxiety disorder]]s, such as [[social anxiety]], [[panic disorder]]s, [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[eating disorder]]s, [[chronic pain]] and occasionally, for [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). They are also frequently used to treat [[depersonalization disorder]], although generally with poor results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Medford|first=Nick|title=Understanding and treating depersonalization disorder|url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/2/92.full|publisher=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment (2005)|accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref>

===Depression===
Antidepressants are recommended by the [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) as a first-line treatment of severe depression and for the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression that persists after conservative measures such as cognitive therapy.<ref name=NICE2009>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG%2090%20QRG%20LR%20FINAL.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> They recommend against their routine use in those who have chronic health problems and mild depression.<ref name=NICE2009/> There has been controversy regarding the efficacy of antidepressants in treating depression depending on its severity and duration.  A comprehensive review conducted by NICE concluded that antidepressants have no advantage over placebo in the treatment of short term mild depression, but that the available evidence supported the use of antidepressants in the treatment of dysthymia and other forms of chronic mild depression.<ref>{{cite book |author= |title=Depression: The NICE Guideline on the Treatment and Management of Depression in Adults (Updated Edition) |publisher=RCPsych Publications |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=1-904671-85-3 |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12329/45896/45896.pdf}}</ref> Two meta-analyses of clinical trials published in 2008 and 2011 found that in mild and moderate depression, the effect of SSRIs is small or none compared to placebo, while in very severe depression the effect of SSRIs is between "relatively small " and "substantial".<ref name="JAMA2010"/><ref name="KIRSCH2008"/> Unlike the NICE study, these studies did not discriminate between the acutely and chronically depressed. The 2008 meta-analysis combined 35 clinical trials submitted to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) before licensing of four newer antidepressants (including the SSRIs [[paroxetine]] and [[fluoxetine]], the non-SSRI antidepressant [[nefazodone]], and the SNRI (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) [[venlafaxine]]). The authors attributed the relationship between severity and efficacy to a reduction of the placebo effect in severely depressed patients, rather than an increase in the effect of the medication.<ref name="KIRSCH2008">{{Cite journal|author=Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT |title=Initial Severity and Antidepressant Benefits: A Meta-Analysis of Data Submitted to the Food and Drug Administration |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e45 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18303940 |pmc=2253608 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045}}</ref> Some researchers have questioned the statistical basis of this study suggesting that it underestimates the effect size of antidepressants.<ref name="HORDER2010">{{Cite journal|author=Horder J, Matthews P, Waldmann R |title=Placebo, Prozac and PLoS: significant lessons for psychopharmacology |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20571143 |doi=10.1177/0269881110372544|volume=25|issue=10|pages=1277–88}}</ref><ref name="FOUNTOULAKIS2010">{{Cite journal|author=Fountoulakis KN, Moller H-J |title=Efficacy of antidepressants: a re-analysis and re-interpretation of the Kirsch data |journal=International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=14|issue=3 |pages=1–8 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20800012 |doi=10.1017/S1461145710000957}}</ref> A 2010 review reached similar conclusions: in mild and moderate depression, specifically that the effect of SSRI is very small or none compared to placebo, while it is clinically significant in very severe depression.<ref name="JAMA2010">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1943|author=Jay C.

===Generalized anxiety disorder===
SSRIs are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD) that has failed to respond to conservative measures such as education and self-help activities. GAD is a common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events. Key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues, and difficulty controlling worrisome thoughts that persists for at least 6 months.

Antidepressants provide a modest-to-moderate reduction in anxiety in GAD,<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13314/52599/52599.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> and are superior to placebo in treating GAD.<ref name = Kapczinski>{{cite journal |author=Kapczinski F, Lima MS, Souza JS, Schmitt R |title=Antidepressants for generalized anxiety disorder |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003592 |year=2003 |pmid=12804478 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003592 |url=}}</ref> The efficacy of different antidepressants is similar.<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk"/><ref name = Kapczinski/>

===Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)===
SSRIs are recommended for the second line treatment of adult [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] patients with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment.  In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.<ref>

===Eating disorders===
Anti-depressants are recommended as an alternative or additional first step to self-help programs in the treatment of [[bulimia nervosa]].<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  SSRIs (fluoxetine in particular) are preferred over other anti-depressants due to their acceptability, tolerability, and superior reduction of symptoms in short term trials. Long term efficacy remains poorly characterized. 

Similar recommendations apply to [[binge eating disorder]].<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk" /> SSRIs provide short term reductions in binge eating behavior, but have not been associated with significant weight loss.<ref name="urlNational Guideline Clearinghouse | Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders.">{{cite web |url=http://www.guidelines.gov/content.aspx?id=9318+ |title=National Guideline Clearinghouse &#124; Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Clinical trials have generated mostly negative results for the use of SSRI's in the treatment of [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref name="pmid21414249">{{cite journal |author=Flament MF, Bissada H, Spettigue W |title=Evidence-based pharmacotherapy of eating disorders |journal=Int. J.

Those from the American Psychiatric Association note that SSRIs confer no advantage regarding weight gain, but that they may be used for the treatment of co-existing depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders.<ref name="urlNational Guideline Clearinghouse | Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders."/>

===Stroke recovery===
SSRIs have been used in the treatment of [[stroke]] patients, including those with and without symptoms of depression. A recent meta analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials found a statistically significant effect of SSRIs on dependence, neurological deficit, depression, and anxiety.  There was no statistically significant effect on death, motor deficits, or cognition.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mead GE, Hsieh CF, Lee R, ''et al.'' |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=11 |issue= |pages=CD009286 |year=2012 |pmid=23152272 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009286.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

===Premature ejaculation===
A general disadvantage of SSRIs in treating premature ejaculation is that they require continuous daily treatment to delay ejaculation significantly.<ref name="pmid17983899">{{Cite journal|author=Waldinger MD |title=Premature ejaculation: state of the art |journal=The Urologic Clinics of North America |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=591–9, vii–viii |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17983899 |doi=10.1016/j.ucl.2007.08.011}}</ref> For the occasional "on-demand" treatment, a few hours before coitus, [[clomipramine]] gave better results than paroxetine in one study,<ref name="pmid15363569">{{Cite journal|author=Waldinger MD, Zwinderman AH, Olivier B |title=On-demand treatment of premature ejaculation with clomipramine and paroxetine: a randomized, double-blind fixed-dose study with stopwatch assessment |journal=European Urology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=510–5; discussion 516 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15363569 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2004.05.005}}</ref> while in another study both sertraline and clomipramine were indistinguishable from the pause–squeeze technique and inferior to paroxetine.<ref name="pmid11313839">{{Cite journal|author=Abdel-Hamid IA, El Naggar EA, El Gilany AH |title=Assessment of as needed use of pharmacotherapy and the pause-squeeze technique in premature ejaculation |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=41–5 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11313839 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3900630}}</ref> The most recent research, conducted in 2007, suggests that on-demand treatment with [[sildenafil]] (Viagra) offers a dramatic improvement in ejaculation delay and sexual satisfaction as compared with daily paroxetine,<ref name="pmid17470165">{{Cite journal|author=Wang WF, Wang Y, Minhas S, Ralph DJ |title=Can sildenafil treat primary premature ejaculation?

==Adverse effects==
General side effects are mostly present during the first 1–4 weeks while the body adapts to the drug (with the exception of sexual side effects, which tend to occur later in treatment). In fact, it often takes 6–8 weeks for the drug to begin reaching its full potential (the slow onset is considered a downside to treatment with SSRIs). Almost all SSRIs are known to cause one or more of these symptoms:
*[[nausea]]/vomiting
*drowsiness or [[somnolence]]
*[[headache]] (very common as a short-term side effect)
*[[bruxism]]
*extremely vivid or strange [[dream]]s
*[[dizziness]]
*[[mydriasis]] (pupil dilation)
*changes in appetite
*[[insomnia]] and/or changes in sleep
*excessive [[diarrhea]]
*[[weight loss]]/gain (measured by a change in bodyweight of 7 pounds)
*increased risk of [[bone fracture]]s by 1.7 fold<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wu Q, Bencaz AF, Hentz JG, Crowell MD |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment and risk of fractures: a meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies |journal=Osteoporos Int |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=365–75 |year=2012 |month=January |pmid=21904950 |doi=10.1007/s00198-011-1778-8 |url=}}</ref>
*changes in [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]] (see the next section)
*increased feelings of depression and anxiety (which may sometimes provoke [[panic attack]]s)
*[[mania]]
*[[tremor]]s
*[[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] dysfunction including [[orthostatic hypotension]], increased or reduced [[sweating]]
*[[akathisia]]
*[[suicidal ideation]] (thoughts of [[suicide]])
*[[photosensitivity]]<ref>{{cite web|author=September 23, 2012 |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/ssris_and_depression/page5_em.htm |title=SSRIs and Depression |publisher=Emedicinehealth.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-23}}</ref>
*[[paresthesia]]
*[[cognitive disorders]]
*[[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion]]

Many side effects disappear after the adaptation phase, when the antidepressant effects begin to come to prominence. However, despite being called general, the side effects and their durations are highly individual and drug-specific. Usually the treatment is begun with a small dose to see how the patient's body reacts to the drug, after that either the dose can be adjusted (e.g. Prozac in the UK is begun at a 20&nbsp;mg dose, and then adjusted as necessary to 40&nbsp;mg or 60&nbsp;mg). Should the drug prove ineffective, or the side effects intolerable to the patient, another common route is to switch treatment to either another SSRI, or an [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRI]].<ref>A landmark study in the use of anti-depressants and their role in step-therapy can be found in the STAR*D trial.</ref>

[[Mania]] or [[hypomania]] is a possible side effect. Users with some type of [[bipolar disorder]] are at a much higher risk, however SSRI-induced mania in patients previously diagnosed with unipolar depression can trigger a bipolar episode; however, according to DSM IV-TR, the diagnosis of bipolar disorder requires that the individuals symptoms must not stem from medication side effects, toxins, drug abuse, or another general medical condition.

===Sexual dysfunction===
SSRIs can cause various types of [[sexual dysfunction]] such as [[anorgasmia]], [[erectile dysfunction]], and diminished [[libido]].<ref>{{cite book | last       = Coleman | first      = E. | authorlink = Eli Coleman | editor1-last  = Grant | editor1-first = Jon E. | editor1-link  =  | editor2-last  = Potenza | editor2-first = Marc N. | editor2-link  =  | title         = The Oxford Handbook of Impulse Control Disorders | url           = http://books.google.ru/books?id=WjgPfD-tgEMC&lpg=PA277&hl=ru&pg=PA375#v=onepage&q&f=false | edition   =  | series    =  | year      = 2011 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location  = [[New York]] | page = 385 | pages     =  | nopp      = | at        =  | chapter   = Chapter 28.

This is because release of extracellular concentrations of serotonin in the brain decreases dopamine and norepinephrine leading to erectile and/or sexual dysfunction.

Release of postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors decreases [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] release from the [[substantia nigra]].

As a result, sexual dysfunction caused by SSRIs can sometimes be treated by several different medications including: [[bupropion]], [[ropinirole]] and [[yohimbine]] among others.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{Main|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}
Antidepressants such as SSRIs have some [[Substance dependence|dependence]] producing effects, most notably a [[SSRI discontinuation syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]]. Their dependence producing properties (depending on the antidepressant) may not be as significant as other psychotropic drugs such as [[benzodiazepine]]s; however, withdrawal symptoms nonetheless may be quite severe and even debilitating. SSRIs have little [[drug abuse|abuse]] potential, but discontinuation can produce disturbing withdrawal symptoms that may be indistinguishable from a  reoccurrence of the original illness.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=van Broekhoven F, Kan CC, Zitman FG |title=Dependence potential of antidepressants compared to benzodiazepines |journal=Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=939–43 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12369270 |doi= 10.1016/S0278-5846(02)00209-9|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278-5846(02)00209-9}}</ref> Since [[physical dependence]] is a reality, discontinuation should be discussed with a medical practitioner before beginning treatment with this class of drugs.

When discontinuing an SSRI or SNRI some doctors may switch the patient to fluoxetine due to its much longer [[Biological half-life|half-life]]. This may avoid many of the severe withdrawal symptoms associated with SSRI/SNRI discontinuation. This can be done either by administering a single 20&nbsp;mg dose of [[fluoxetine]] or by beginning on a low dosage of fluoxetine and slowly tapering down. Any SSRI or SNRI may be requested in liquid form, which allows very gradual tapering. Alternatively, a patient wishing to stop taking an SSRI/SNRI may visit a compounding pharmacy where his or her prescription may be re-arranged into progressively smaller dosages. For example the lowest dose of cymbalta that can normally be prescribed is 20&nbsp;mg in gel capsules; a compounding pharmacist may divide this into doses of 20, 15, 10, 5 and 2.5&nbsp;mg so that a proper tapered reduction may take place.

===Suicide risk===

====Children and adolescents====
Several studies have found that SSRI use is related to a higher risk of suicidal behavior in children and adolescents.<ref name =FDA2>{{cite web| url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4272b1-01-FDA.pdf | title =Clinical review: relationship between antidepressant drugs and suicidal behavior in adults| accessdate = 2007-09-22 | author = Stone MB, Jones ML | date = 2006-11-17| format =PDF | work = Overview for December 13 Meeting of Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee (PDAC) | publisher = FDA| pages = 11–74}}</ref><ref name =FDA3>{{cite web| url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4272b1-01-FDA.pdf | title = Statistical Evaluation of Suicidality in Adults Treated with Antidepressants | accessdate = 2007-09-22 | author = Levenson M, Holland C | date = 2006-11-17| format =PDF | work =Overview for December 13 Meeting of Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee (PDAC) | publisher = FDA| pages = 75–140}}</ref><ref name = "Olfson">{{Cite journal|author=Olfson M, Marcus SC, Shaffer D |title=Antidepressant drug therapy and suicide in severely depressed children and adults: A case-control study |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=865–72 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16894062 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.8.865}}</ref> For instance, a 2004 [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) analysis of [[clinical trial]]s on children with [[major depressive disorder]] found statistically significant increases of the risks of "possible [[suicidal ideation]] and suicidal behavior" by about 80%, and of agitation and hostility by about 130%;<ref name =FDA>{{cite web| url = http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/ac/04/briefing/2004-4065b1-10-TAB08-Hammads-Review.pdf | title = Review and evaluation of clinical data.

====Adults====
It is unclear whether or not SSRIs affect the risk of suicidal behavior for adults.
* A 2005 meta-analysis of drug company data found no evidence that SSRIs increased the risk of suicide; however, important protective or hazardous effects could not be excluded.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gunnell D, Saperia J, Ashby D |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicide in adults: meta-analysis of drug company data from placebo controlled, randomised controlled trials submitted to the MHRA's safety review |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7488 |page=385 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15718537 |pmc=549105 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7488.385 |url=}}</ref> Also among high-risk adult patients, antidepressant drug treatment does not seem  related to suicide attempts and death.<ref name = "Olfson" />
* A 2005 review observed that suicide attempts are increased in those who use SSRIs as compared to [[placebo]] and compared to therapeutic interventions other than [[tricyclic antidepressants]]. No difference risk of suicide attempts was detected between SSRIs versus tricyclic antidepressants.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Fergusson D, Doucette S, Glass KC, ''et al.'' |title=Association between suicide attempts and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: systematic review of randomised controlled trials |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7488 |page=396 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15718539 |pmc=549110 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7488.396 |url=}}</ref>
* On the other hand, a 2006 review suggests that the widespread use of antidepressants in the new "SSRI-era" appear to have led to highly significant decline in suicide rates in most countries with traditionally high baseline suicide rates. The decline is particularly striking for women who, compared with men, seek more help for depression. Recent clinical data on large samples in the US too have revealed a protective effect of antidepressant against suicide.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Rihmer Z, Akiskal H |title=Do antidepressants t(h)reat(en) depressives?

*A 2006 meta analysis of random controlled trials suggests that SSRIs increase suicide ideation compared with placebo. However, the observational studies suggests that SSRIs did not increase suicide risk more than older antidepressants. The researchers stated that if SSRIs increase suicide risk in some patients, the number of additional deaths is very small because ecological studies have generally found that suicide mortality has declined (or at least not increased) as SSRI use has increased.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hall WD, Lucke J |title=How have the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants affected suicide mortality? |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=40 |issue=11–12 |pages=941–50 |year=2006 |pmid=17054562 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2006.01917.x |url=}}</ref>
* An additional meta-analysis by the FDA in 2006 found an age-related effect of SSRI's. Among adults younger than 25 years, results indicated that there was a higher risk for suicidal behavior. For adults between 25 and 64, the effect appears neutral on suicidal behavior but possibly protective for suicidal behavior for adults between the ages of 25 and 64. For adults older than 64, SSRI's seem to reduce the risk of both suicidal behavior.<ref name=FDA2>(page 54)</ref>

====Suicide warnings====
The FDA findings resulted in a [[black box warning]] on SSRI and other antidepressant medications regarding the increased risk of suicidal behavior in patients younger than 24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108905.htm |title=FDA Proposes New Warnings About Suicidal Thinking, Behavior in Young Adults Who Take Antidepressant Medications|date=2007-05-02 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] |accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> Similar precautionary notice revisions were implemented by the Japanese Ministry of Health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.mhlw.go.jp/kinkyu/iyaku_j/iyaku_j/anzenseijyouhou/261.pdf  |title=www1.mhlw.go.jp |format=PDF |work=Japanese Ministry of Health |language=Japanese}}</ref> In 2004 the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] in the United Kingdom issued a warning about increases in 'insomnia, agitation, weight loss, headache, tremor, loss of appetite, self-harm and suicidal thoughts' when the medications are used with children and adolescents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-p/documents/websiteresources/con019493.pdf|title=Questions and answers: Advice on SSRIs in children from the Committee on Safety of Medicine|format=PDF|work=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency}}</ref>

The introduction of a warning regarding the association between SSRIs and suicide by the FDA in 2004 led to a dramatic decrease in prescriptions of these medications to young people. Originally, there were concerns that the decrease in prescriptions caused by the warnings could increase the number of teenage suicides in the US.<ref name="pmid17728420">{{Cite journal|author=Gibbons RD, Brown CH, Hur K, ''et al.'' |title=Early evidence on the effects of regulators' suicidality warnings on SSRI prescriptions and suicide in children and adolescents |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=9 |pages=1356–63 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17728420 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07030454}}</ref> However, the most recent data from the US National Center for Health Statistics put these concerns to rest.

The FDA issued a statement on July 19, 2006 stating nursing mothers on SSRIs must discuss treatment with their physicians.

====Neonatal abstinence syndrome====
[[Neonatal abstinence syndrome]] is a [[withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]] in [[Infant|newborn babies]]. It has been documented in SSRI treatment. By November 2003, a total of 93 cases of SSRI use associated with either neonatal convulsions or withdrawal syndrome had been reported. Subsequently, the authors of a [[The Lancet|Lancet]] study concluded that doctors should avoid or cautiously manage the prescribing of these drugs to pregnant women with [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorders]].<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=19631 Medicalnewstoday.com] [[Medical News Today]] - Lancet Press Release.

====Neuropsychological changes due to SSRI use in infancy ====

Since the early 80's scientists  have used a technique called neonatal clomipramine to produce animals used in depression research. If rats are given the tricyclic antidepressant [[clomipramine]] when 8–21 days old, they develop behavioural changes in adulthood that resemble depression in humans.<ref name="pmid2183099">{{Cite journal|author=Vogel G, Neill D, Hagler M, Kors D |title=A new animal model of endogenous depression: a summary of present findings |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=85–91 |year=1990 |pmid=2183099 |doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(05)80164-2}}</ref><ref name="pmid7902983">{{Cite journal|author=Velazquez-Moctezuma J, Aguilar-Garcia A, Diaz-Ruiz O |title=Behavioral effects of neonatal treatment with clomipramine, scopolamine, and idazoxan in male rats |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=215–7 |year=1993 |month=September |pmid=7902983 |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(93)90343-R}}</ref> In 1997 Lundbeck found that treatment with the SSRI [[LU-10-134-C]], which only differs from their product citalopram by two atoms could give similar results as clomipramine.<ref name="pmid9400008">{{Cite journal|author=Hansen HH, Sánchez C, Meier E |title=Neonatal administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Lu 10-134-C increases forced swimming-induced immobility in adult rats: a putative animal model of depression? |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=283 |issue=3 |pages=1333–41 |year=1997 |month=December |pmid=9400008 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9400008}}</ref>  Later it was found that neonatal citalopram and escitalopram makes persistent changes in the serotonergic transmission of the brain resulting in behavioral changes,<ref name="pmid18385313">{{Cite journal|author=Popa D, Léna C, Alexandre C, Adrien J |title=Lasting syndrome of depression produced by reduction in serotonin uptake during postnatal development: evidence from sleep, stress, and behavior |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=3546–54 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18385313 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4006-07.2008}}</ref><ref name="pmid16012532">{{Cite journal|author=Maciag D, Simpson KL, Coppinger D, ''et al.'' |title=Neonatal Antidepressant Exposure has Lasting Effects on Behavior and Serotonin Circuitry |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=47–57 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16012532 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300823|pmc=3118509}}</ref> which are reversed by treatment with antidepressants.<ref name="pmid16483567">{{Cite journal|author=Maciag D, Williams L, Coppinger D, Paul IA |title=Neonatal citalopram exposure produces lasting changes in behavior which are reversed by adult imipramine treatment |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=532 |issue=3 |pages=265–9 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16483567 |pmc=2921633 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.12.081}}</ref>
By treating normal and [[Knockout mouse|knockout mice]] lacking the serotonin transporter with  fluoxetine scientists  showed that normal emotional reactions in adulthood, like a short latency to escape foot shocks and  inclination to explore new environments were dependent on active serotonin transporters during the neonatal period.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Holden C |title=Neuroscience.

But when young mice were treated with the SNRI desimipramine they developed to normal adults, which suggests that serotonin and noradrenaline have different effects in the developing brain. For humans, the  developmental stage sensitive to SSRI:s  corresponds with the last trimester to the first years of life. A study showed that 4-year old children perinatally exposed to SSRIs behave normally. However, the young mice and rats also seem normal until they reach puberty and develop behavioural disturbances.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ansorge MS, Morelli E, Gingrich JA |title=Inhibition of serotonin but not norepinephrine transport during development produces delayed, persistent perturbations of emotional behaviors in mice |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=199–207 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18171937 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3973-07.2008}}</ref><ref name="pmid16741203">{{Cite journal|author=Misri S, Reebye P, Kendrick K, ''et al.'' |title=Internalizing behaviors in 4-year-old children exposed in utero to psychotropic medications |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=6 |pages=1026–32 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16741203 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.6.1026}}</ref>

====Persistent pulmonary hypertension====
Persistent [[pulmonary hypertension]] (PPHN) is a serious and life-threatening, but rare, lung condition that occurs soon after birth of the newborn. [[Infant|Newborn babies]] with PPHN have high pressure in their lung [[blood vessel]]s and are not able to get enough oxygen into their bloodstream. About 1 to 2 babies per 1000 babies born in the U.S. develop PPHN shortly after birth, and often they need intensive [[Health care|medical care]]. One study has found that PPHN is six times more common in babies whose mothers take an SSRI antidepressant after the 20th week of the pregnancy compared to babies whose mothers do not take an antidepressant.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/CDER/DRUG/advisory/SSRI_PPHN200607.htm FDA.gov], FDA Public Health Advisory - Treatment Challenges of Depression in Pregnancy</ref>

A population-based cohort study, which included 1.6 million live births in five Nordic countries, of women with filled SSRI prescriptions later than the 20th week gestation by last menstrual period demonstrated an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) compared to control infants (adjusted RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3). The increased risk of PPHN was of similar magnitude for the SSRI class of drugs (Fluoxetine, Citalopram, Paroxetine, Sertraline, Escitalopram).

===Overdose===
{{See also|Serotonin syndrome}}
SSRIs appear safer in [[overdose]] when compared with traditional antidepressants, such as the tricyclic antidepressants. This relative safety is supported both by case series and studies of deaths per numbers of prescriptions.<ref name="ClinTox2004-isbister">{{Cite journal| author = Isbister G, Bowe S, Dawson A, Whyte I | title = Relative toxicity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in overdose | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–85 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15362595 | doi = 10.1081/CLT-120037428}}</ref> However, case reports of SSRI poisoning have indicated that severe toxicity can occur<ref name="AmJEmergMed1992-Borys">{{Cite journal| author = Borys D, Setzer S, Ling L, Reisdorf J, Day L, Krenzelok E | title = Acute fluoxetine overdose: a report of 234 cases | journal = Am J Emerg Med | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–20 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1586402 | doi = 10.1016/0735-6757(92)90041-U}}</ref> and deaths have been reported following massive single ingestions,<ref name="Lancet1996-Ostrom">{{Cite journal| author = Oström M, Eriksson A, Thorson J, Spigset O | title = Fatal overdose with citalopram | journal = Lancet | volume = 348 | issue = 9023 | pages = 339–40 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8709713 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)64513-8}}</ref> although this is exceedingly uncommon when compared to the tricyclic antidepressants.<ref name="ClinTox2004-isbister"/>

Because of the wide [[therapeutic index]] of the SSRIs, most patients will have mild or no symptoms following moderate overdoses.

Treatment for SSRI overdose is mainly based on symptomatic and supportive care. Medical care may be required for agitation, maintenance of the airways, and treatment for serotonin syndrome. [[ECG]] monitoring is usually indicated to detect any cardiac abnormalities.

==Contraindications and drug interaction==
One major contraindication of SSRIs is the concomitant use of MAOIs ([[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s). This is likely to cause severe [[Serotonin syndrome|serotonin syndrome/toxidrome]].

People taking SSRIs should also avoid taking [[pimozide]] (an [[antipsychotic]] diphenylbutylpiperidine derivative). [[Tramadol]] hydrochloride (or Ultram, Ultracet) can, in rare cases, produce [[seizure]]s when taken in conjunction with an SSRI or [[tricyclic antidepressant]]. [[Liver]] impairment is another contraindication for medications of this type.

SSRIs also directly interfere with ligands of 5-HT receptors, like the [[psychedelic]]s and [[entactogen]]s. SSRIs strongly diminish the effects of [[tryptamine]]s (e.g. [[psilocybin]] and [[LSD]]), and [[phenethylamine]]s (e.g. the [[2C family]]), and almost completely eliminate the serotonergic effects of [[MDxx]] (e.g. [[MDMA]]). The exact mechanism that causes this interaction is still unclear. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} However, [[salvinorin A]] (found in [[Salvia divinorum]]) has no actions at the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, nor is it known to have affinity for any other sites to date.

===Related agents===
SSRIs form a subclass of serotonin uptake inhibitors, which includes other [[non-selective]] inhibitors as well. [[Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s, [[serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s and [[selective serotonin reuptake enhancer]]s are also [[serotonergic]] antidepressants.

==Mechanism of action==
SSRIs are believed to act by inhibiting the reuptake of [[serotonin]] after being released in synapses. How much an individual will respond to this, however, also depends on genetics. In addition, several other mechanisms are suggested for the desired effect, e.g. neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory factors. Taken together, SSRI has several advantages compared with [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCA)s and 5-HT-[[prodrug]]s. However, the latter might be required in addition to SSRIs in certain situations.

===Basic understanding===
{{Further|Chemical synapse}}
In the [[brain]], messages are passed between two [[neuron|nerve cells]] via a [[chemical synapse]], a small gap between the cells. The (presynaptic) cell that sends the information releases neurotransmitters (including serotonin) into that gap. The neurotransmitters are then recognized by [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on the surface of the recipient (postsynaptic) cell, which upon this stimulation, in turn, relays the signal. About 10% of the neurotransmitters are lost in this process; the other 90% are released from the receptors and taken up again by [[monoamine transporter]]s into the sending (presynaptic) cell (a process called ''reuptake'').

To stimulate the recipient cell, SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. As a result, the serotonin stays in the synaptic gap longer than it normally would, and may repeatedly stimulate the receptors of the recipient cell. The current model of SSRIs (the [[Monoamine Hypothesis]]) assumes that a lower homeostatic level of serotonin is primarily responsible for depression. While this holds in cases of major depression, minor to moderate cases are not as clear cut, and may in fact be caused by excess serotonin in specific areas of the brain.

Some current research points to more than just a single type of chemical signaling - the classic synapse model - involving serotonin. [[Astrocytes]] are "helper cells" in the brain that do not participate directly in chemical signaling, but play a part in homeostasis for many chemical levels in the brain. Recent research<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Cheryl et. al.|title=Serotonin Regulation by Astrocytes|journal=The FASEB Journal|url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/23/1_MeetingAbstracts/790.2}}</ref> suggests that serotonin is one of the hormones regulated by astrocytes, and that astrocytes actually uptake, package, and resend serotonin in a way similar to neuronal axons, but do not have corresponding post-synaptic terminals, therefore appearing to function only to control the local levels of serotonin in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Still more research illustrates that the current model for the antidepressant activity of SSRIs may be misdirected, as a drug that works entirely opposite to SSRIs - [[Tianeptine]], a selective serotonin reuptake '''enhancer''' - also exhibits antidepressant activity, especially in patients resistant to SSRI therapy. The effect of an SSRE in comparison to an SSRI requires that the nature of serotonin signaling in the areas of the brain related to mood and cognition needs further elucidation. If serotonin firing is regularly phasic (related to brain waves), or rapid and discrete, then SSRIs simply compress the signal potential at affected receptors (bringing down the maximum potential and bring up the minimum) by causing a constant leftover signal (serotonin left in the synaptic gap) coupled with weaker subsequent signals (due to the decrease in presynaptic serotonin available to send new signals). By this hypothetical model, SSREs increase the signal potential separation (min to max) at affected 5-HT sites by reducing the level of free cerebrospinal serotonin and increasing the amount uptaken into axons to send new signals.

===Pharmacodynamics===
SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) into the presynaptic cell, increasing levels of 5-HT within the [[synaptic cleft]].

However, there is one counteracting effect: high serotonin levels will not only activate the [[postsynaptic]] receptors, but also flood presynaptic [[autoreceptor]]s, which serve as a feedback sensor for the cell. Activation of the autoreceptors (by [[agonist]]s like serotonin) triggers a throttling back of serotonin production. The resulting serotonin deficiency persists for some time, as the transporter inhibition occurs downstream to the cause of the deficiency and therefore, is not able to counterbalance the serotonin deficiency. The body adapts gradually to this situation by lowering ([[downregulation and upregulation|downregulating]]) the sensitivity of the autoreceptors.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gobbi M, Crespi D, Foddi MC, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of chronic treatment with fluoxetine and citalopram on 5-HT uptake, 5-HT1B autoreceptors, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors in rats |journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology |volume=356 |issue=1 |pages=22–8 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9228186 |doi=10.1007/PL00005024}}</ref>

Another adaptive process provoked by SSRIs is the downregulation of postsynaptic [[5-HT2A receptor|serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors]]. After the use of an SSRI, since there is more serotonin available, the response is to decrease the number of postsynaptic receptors over time and in the long run, this modifies the serotonin/receptor ratio. This downregulation of 5-HT2A occurs when the antidepressant effects of SSRIs become apparent. Also, deceased suicidal and otherwise depressed patients have had more 5-HT2A receptors than normal patients. These considerations suggest that 5-HT2A overactivity is involved in the pathogenesis of depression.<ref name=pmid8788498>{{Cite journal|author=Eison AS, Mullins UL |title=Regulation of central 5-HT2A receptors: a review of in vivo studies |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=73 |issue=1–2 |pages=177–81 |year=1996 |pmid=8788498 |doi=10.1016/0166-4328(96)00092-7}}</ref>

Most of the serotonin receptors on the surface of the cell are [[G protein-coupled receptor|coupled to a G-protein]] inside it. These proteins activate or inhibit [[second messenger]]s, which in turn affect [[transcription factor]]s. Transcription factors are proteins that fit to the beginning of a gene and tell the cell to start using it.

These (slowly proceeding) neurophysiological adaptations of the brain tissue are the reason why usually several weeks of continuous SSRI use is necessary for the antidepressant effect to become fully manifested,<ref name=pmid8788498/> and why increased anxiety is a common side effect in the first few days or weeks of use.

===Role in BDNF release===
SSRIs act on signal pathways such as cAMP (Cyclic AMP) on the postsynaptic neuronal cell, which leads to the release of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). BDNF enhances the growth and survival of cortical neurons and synapses.<ref>Kolb, Bryan and Wishaw Ian. An Introduction to Brain and Behavior. New York: Worth Publishers 2006, Print.</ref>

===SSRIs versus TCAs===
SSRIs are described as '[[Functional selectivity|selective]]' because they affect only the reuptake pumps responsible for serotonin, as opposed to earlier antidepressants, which affect other monoamine neurotransmitters as well, and as a result, SSRIs have fewer side effects.

There appears no significant difference in effectiveness between SSRIs and [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, which were the most commonly used class of antidepressants before the development of SSRIs.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Anderson IM |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus tricyclic antidepressants: a meta-analysis of efficacy and tolerability |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=19–36 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10760555 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(99)00092-0}}</ref> However, SSRIs have the important advantage that their [[drug overdose|toxic dose]] is high, and, therefore, they are much more difficult to use as a means to commit [[suicide]]. Further, they have fewer and milder [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]].  Tricyclic antidepressant also have a higher risk of serious cardiovascular side effects, which SSRIs lack.

===SSRIs versus 5-HT-Prodrugs===
{{Further|Prodrugs}}
Serotonin cannot be administered directly because when ingested orally, it will not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], and therefore would have no effect on brain functions. Also, serotonin would activate ''every'' synapse it reaches, whereas SSRIs only ''enhance a signal'' that is already present, but too weak to come through.  The selectivity of the membrane can be reduced for a drug by injecting it in a concentrated sugar solution. The high osmotic pressure of the sugar solution causes the endothelial cells of the capillaries to shrink, which opens gaps between their tight junctions and makes the barrier more permeable.  As a result the drug can enter the brain tissue.

====SSRIs together with 5-HT-Prodrugs====
[[Biosynthesis|Biosynthetic]] serotonin is made from [[tryptophan]], an [[amino acid]]. In 1989, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] made tryptophan available by [[Medical prescription|prescription]] only, in response to an outbreak of [[eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome]] caused by impure L-tryptophan supplements sold [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]]. With current standards, L-tryptophan is again available over the counter in the US as well as supplement [[5-HTP]], which is a direct precursor to serotonin.

==Society and culture==

===Criticism===
{{See also|Biopsychiatry controversy|Biological psychiatry}}
In late 2004 media attention was given to a proposed link between SSRI use and [[teenage suicide|juvenile suicide]].  For this reason, the use of SSRIs in pediatric cases of depression is now recognized by the United States FDA as warranting a cautionary statement to the parents of children who may be prescribed SSRIs by a [[General practitioner|family doctor]].  The FDA's currently required packaging insert for SSRIs includes a warning (known as a "black box warning") that a pooled analysis of placebo [[randomized controlled trial|controlled trials]] of 9 antidepressant drugs (including multiple SSRIs) resulted in a risk of suicidal behavior that was twice that of [[placebo]].  At the same time, in adults SSRIs do not increase the risk of suicide.<ref name="pmid15718537">{{Cite journal|author=Gunnell D, Saperia J, Ashby D |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicide in adults: meta-analysis of drug company data from placebo controlled, randomised controlled trials submitted to the MHRA's safety review |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7488 |page=385 |year=2005 |pmid=15718537 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7488.385 |pmc=549105}}</ref>

Critics of SSRIs claim that the widely disseminated television and print advertising of SSRIs promotes an inaccurate message, oversimplifying what these medications actually do and deceiving the public.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lacasse JR, Leo J |title=Serotonin and Depression: A Disconnect between the Advertisements and the Scientific Literature |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=e392 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16268734 |pmc=1277931 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392}}</ref>

The criticism stems from questions about the validity of claims that SSRIs work by 'correcting' [[chemical imbalance]]s.  Without accurately measuring patients' [[neurotransmitter]] levels to allow for continuous monitoring during treatment, it is impossible to know if one is correctly targeting a deficient neurotransmitter (i.e. correcting an imbalance), reaching a desirable level, or even introducing too much of a particular neurotransmitter.  Thus it has been argued that SSRIs can actually cause chemical imbalances and abnormal brain states, as evidenced by the fact that many report problems of sexual dysfunction, whose effects last long after the medication has been discontinued.  Hence, it is purported that when a patient discontinues an SSRI, they may have a chemical imbalance due to the rapid cessation of the drug that causes the discontinuation syndrome.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Moncrieff J, Cohen D |title=Do Antidepressants Cure or Create Abnormal Brain States? |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e240 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16724872 |pmc=1472553 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030240}}</ref>

One possible mechanism is by inhibition of [[dopamine]]rgic neurotransmission.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Damsa C, Bumb A, Bianchi-Demicheli F, ''et al.'' |title='Dopamine-dependent' side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a clinical review |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1064–8 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15323590 |url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10001001 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v65n0806}}</ref>

Biopsychiatrists believe that, among other factors, the balance of [[neurotransmitter]]s in the [[brain]] is a biological regulator of [[mental health]]. In this theory, emotions within a "normal" spectrum reflect a proper balance of neurochemicals, but abnormally extreme emotions, such as [[clinical depression]], reflect an imbalance. Psychiatrists{{Who|date=January 2010}} claim that medications regulate neurotransmitters, and many if not most psychiatrists also claim they treat abnormal personalities by removing a neurochemical excess or replenishing a deficit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} On the other hand, [[Elliot Valenstein]], a psychologist and neuroscientist, claims that the broad biochemical assertions and assumptions of mainstream psychiatry are not supported by evidence.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Valenstein, Elliot S. |title=Blaming the brain: the truth about drugs and mental health |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-684-84964-X}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

One controversial critic of antidepressants, [[Peter Breggin]], a physician who opposes the overuse of prescription medications to treat patients for mental health issues, predicted [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] issues that SSRIs incur on a significant percentage of patients. Another prominent SSRI critic is [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]].

A widely reported meta-analysis combined 35 clinical trials submitted to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) before licensing of four newer antidepressants (including the SSRIs [[paroxetine]] and [[fluoxetine]], and two non-SSRI antidepressants [[nefazodone]] and [[venlafaxine]]). The authors found that although the antidepressants were [[statistically]] superior to [[placebo]] they did not exceed the [[NICE]] criteria for a 'clinically significant' effect. For more detail, see the section "[[#Efficacy|Efficacy]]".

A study in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] on a possible [[publication bias]] regarding the efficacy of SSRI medications in the treatment of depression suggests that their effectiveness and risk-benefit ratios may be greatly exaggerated.  Of 74 studies registered with the United States [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], 37 with positive results were published in [[academic journal]]s, while 22 studies with negative results were not published and 11 with negative results were published in a way that conveyed a positive outcome (one positive study was not published and three negative studies were published with results that were portrayed as negative). Overall, 94% of studies actually published were positive outcomes; when published and unpublished studies were included for analysis, the percentage of positive outcomes was 51%.<ref name="pmid18199864">{{Cite journal|author=Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R |title=Selective publication of antidepressant trials and its influence on apparent efficacy |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=358 |issue=3 |pages=252–60 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18199864 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa065779}}</ref>

Although controversial, the existence of an SSRI-related withdrawal syndrome mimicking depression may inflate the therapeutic effect size reported in long-term (more than 6 months) placebo controlled trials of SSRI’s, due to a reliance on randomized discontinuation designs. Discontinuation trials are a variant of the classic 2-arm placebo controlled randomized controlled trials used in shorter placebo controlled studies of SSRI’s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Deshauer D, Moher D, Fergusson D, Moher E, Sampson M, Grimshaw J |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for unipolar depression: a systematic review of classic long-term randomized controlled trials |journal=CMAJ |volume=178 |issue=10 |pages=1293–301 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18458261 |pmc=2335186 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.071068}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Geddes JR, Carney SM, Davies C, ''et al.'' |title=Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: a systematic review |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9358 |pages=653–61 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12606176 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8}}</ref>

===Regulation===
All SSRIs are approved in the U.S. for use with [[psychiatric]] disorders as outlined in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM IV).

Approved uses for SSRIs vary by country and are determined by the overseeing branch of government in charge of regulating drugs. In the U.S., the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approves drugs after trial results have been submitted by the [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]]. In Europe, drugs can be approved either by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for human consumption throughout the [[European Union]] or by the regulatory agencies of individual countries for use within those countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. In Canada, the drug approval process is carried out by [[Health Canada]].

===Lawsuits===
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against drug manufacturers seeking compensation for harm attributed to the use of SSRIs. Suits based on [[product liability]], for example, often allege failure to adequately warn users of potential side effects. Manufacturers have defended many suits on the merits and settled many others. In 2005, the U.S. FDA asked manufacturers to include black box warnings on antidepressant drug packaging.<ref>Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ''[http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/antidepressants Antidepressant Use in Children, Adolescents, and Adults]''.
