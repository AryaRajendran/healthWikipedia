[[File:Human Fertilization.png|thumb|300px|Fertilization in humans. The sperm and ovum unite through fertilization, creating a zygote that (over the course of 8-9 days) will implant in the uterine wall, where it will reside over the course of 9 months.]]

In humans (as in all other [[mammal]]s, except for [[monotreme]]s), '''implantation''' is the very early stage of [[pregnancy]] at which the [[embryo]] adheres to the wall of the [[uterus]].<ref>http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/fm2004/November/Walter690.pdf</ref> At this stage of [[prenatal development]], the embryo is a [[blastocyst]]. It is by this adhesion that the fetus receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother to be able to grow.

In humans, implantation of a [[Human fertilization|fertilized]] [[ovum]] is most likely to occur about 9 days after [[ovulation]], ranging between 6 to 12 days.<ref name="wilcox">{{Cite journal| author=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | title=Time of implantation of the Conceptus and loss of pregnancy | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | volume=340 | issue=23 | pages=1796â€“1799 | year=1999 | pmid=10362823 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199906103402304}}</ref>

==Implantation window==
The reception-ready phase of the [[endometrium]] of the uterus is usually termed the "implantation window" and lasts about 4 days. The implantation window follows around 6 days after the peak in [[luteinizing hormone]] levels. With some disparity between sources, it has been stated to occur from 7 days after ovulation until 9 days after ovulation,<ref>{{cite pmid|19361790}}</ref> or days 6-10 postovulation.<ref>Aboubakr M. Elnashar, Gamal I. Aboul-Enein. ''[http://www.bioline.org.br/request?mf04003 Endometrial receptivity]''. Middle East Fertility Society Journal, Vol. 9, No. 1, 2004, pp. 10-24</ref> On average, it occurs during the 20th to the 23rd day after the [[last menstrual period]].<ref>[http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/gnidation/etape02.html 6.2 Implantation stages] from embryology.ch at by the universities of Fribourg, Lausanne and Bern (Switzerland). Retrieved May, 2012</ref> 

The implantation window is characterized by changes to the endometrium cells, which aid in the absorption of the uterine fluid. These changes are collectively known as [[the plasma membrane transformation]] and bring the [[blastocyst]] nearer to the endometrium and immobilize it. During this stage the blastocyst can still be eliminated by being flushed out of the uterus. Scientists have hypothesized that the hormones cause a swelling that fills the flattened out uterine cavity just prior to this stage, which may also help press the blastocyst against the endometrium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Implantation stages|url=http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/gnidation/etape02.html|work=Human Embryology|publisher=Online course in embryology for medicine students developed by the universities of Fribourg, Lausanne and Bern (Switzerland) with the support of the Swiss Virtual Campus|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> The implantation window may also be initiated by other preparations in the endometrium of the uterus, both structurally and in the composition of its secretions.

==Adaptation of uterus==
To enable implantation, the uterus goes through changes in order to be able to receive the embryo.

===Predecidualization===
The endometrium increases thickness, becomes [[Angiogenesis|vascularized]] and its glands grow to be tortuous and boosted in their secretions. These changes reach their maximum about 7 days after [[ovulation]].

Furthermore, the surface of the endometrium produces a kind of rounded cells, which cover the whole area toward the uterine cavity. This happens about 9 to 10 days after ovulation.<ref name=boron>{{Cite book|first=Walter |last=Boron |authorlink=Walter Boron |coauthors=[[Emile Boulpaep]] |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=[[Oxford]] |year=2004 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc=61527528}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> These cells are called [[decidual cell]]s, which emphasises that the whole layer of them is shed off in every [[menstruation]] if no pregnancy occurs, just as leaves of [[deciduous trees]]. The uterine glands, on the other hand, decrease in activity and degenerate already 8 to 9 days<ref name=boron/> after ovulation in absence of pregnancy.

The [[stromal cell]]s originate from the stromal cells that are always present in the endometrium. However, the decidual cells make up a new layer, the [[decidua]]. The rest of the endometrium, in addition, expresses differences between the luminal and the basal sides. The luminal cells form the [[zona compacta]] of the endometrium, in contrast to the basalolateral [[zona spongiosa]], which consists of the rather spongy stromal cells.<ref name=boron/>

===Decidualization===
Decidualization succeeds predecidualization if pregnancy occurs. This is an expansion of it, further developing the uterine glands, the zona compacta and the epithelium of decidual cells lining it. The decidual cells become filled with lipids and glycogen and take the polyhedral shape characteristic for decidual cells.

====Trigger====
It is likely that the blastocyst itself makes the main contribution to this additional growing and sustaining of the decidua. An indication of this is that decidualization occurs at a higher degree in conception cycles than in nonconception cycles.<ref name=boron/> Furthermore, similar changes are observed when giving stimuli mimicking the natural invasion of the embryo.<ref name=boron/>

====Parts of decidua====
The decidua can be organized into separate sections, although they have the same composition.

*Decidua basalis - This is the part of the decidua which is located basalolateral to the embryo after implantation.

*Decidua capsularis - Decidua capsularis grows over the embryo on the luminal side, enclosing it into the endometrium. It surrounds the embryo together with decidua basalis.

*Decidua parietalis - All other decidua on the uterine surface belongs to decidua parietalis.

===Decidua throughout pregnancy===
After implantation the decidua remains, at least through the first trimester.<ref name=boron/> However, its most prominent time is during the early stages of pregnancy, during implantation. Its function as a surrounding tissue is replaced by the definitive [[placenta]]. However, some elements of the decidualization remain throughout pregnancy.<ref name=boron/>

The compacta and spongiosa layers are still observable beneath the decidua in pregnancy. The glands of the spongiosa layer continue to secrete during the first trimester, when they degenerate. However, before that disappearance, some glands secrete unequally much. This phenomenon of hypersecretion is called the [[Arias-Stella phenomenon]],<ref name=boron/> after the pathologist [[Javier Arias-Stella]].

===Pinopodes===
{{Main|Pinopod}}

Pinopodes are small, finger-like protrusions from the endometrium. They appear between day 19 and day 21<ref name=boron/> of [[gestational age]]. This corresponds to a [[fertilization age]] of approximately 5 to 7 days, which corresponds well with the time of implantation. They only persist for 2 to 3 days.<ref name=boron/> The development of them is enhanced by [[progesterone]] but inhibited by [[estrogens]].

====Function in implantation====
Pinopodes endocytose uterine fluid and macromolecules in it. By doing so, the volume of the uterus decreases, taking the walls closer to the embryoblast floating in it. Thus, the period of active pinocytes might also limit the implantation window.<ref name=boron/>

====Function during implantation====
Pinopodes continue to absorb fluid, and removes most of it during the early stages of implantation.

Not only the lining of the uterus transforms, but in addition, the secretion from its epithelial glands changes. This change is induced by increased levels of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. The target of the secretions is the embryoblast, and has several functions on it.

===Nourishment===
The embryoblast spends approximately 72 hours<ref name=boron/> in the uterine cavity before implanting. In that time, it cannot receive nourishment directly from the blood of the mother, and must rely on secreted nutrients into the uterine cavity, e.g. iron<ref name=boron/> and fat-soluble vitamins.<ref name=boron/>

===Growth and implantation===
In addition to nourishment, the endometrium secretes several [[steroid]]-dependent proteins,<ref name=boron/> important for growth and implantation. [[Cholesterol]]<ref name=boron/> and steroids<ref name=boron/> are also secreted. Implantation is further facilitated by synthesis of [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] substances, [[adhesion molecules]] and surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for the matrix substances.

==Mechanism==
Implantation is initiated when the blastocyst comes into contact with the uterine wall.

===Zona hatching===
{{Main|Zona hatching}}
To be able to perform implantation, the blastocyst first needs to get rid of its [[zona pellucida]]. This process can be called "hatching".

====Factors====
Lytic factors in the uterine cavity, as well as factors from the blastocyst itself are essential for this process. Mechanisms in the latter are indicated by that the zona pellucida remains intact if an unfertilized egg is placed in the uterus under the same conditions.<ref name=boron/> A substance probably involved is [[plasmin]]. [[Plasminogen]], the plasmin precursor, is found in the uterine cavity, and blastocyst factors contribute to its conversion to active plasmin. This hypothesis is supported by lytic effects [[in vitro]] by plasmin.<ref name=boron/> Furthermore, plasmin inhibitors also inhibit the entire zona hatching in rat experiments.<ref name=boron/>

===Apposition===
The very first, albeit loose, connection between the blastocyst and the endometrium is called the apposition.<ref name=boron/>

====Location====
On the endometrium, the apposition is usually made where there is a small crypt in it, perhaps because it increases the area of contact with the rather spherical blastocyst.

On the blastocyst, on the other hand, it occurs at a location where there has been enough lysis of the zona pellucida to have created a rupture to enable direct contact between the underlying [[trophoblast]] and the decidua of the endometrium.<ref name=boron/> However, ultimately, the [[inner cell mass]], inside the [[trophoblast]] layer, is aligned closest to the decidua. Nevertheless, the apposition on the blastocyst is not dependent on if it is on the same side of the blastocyst as the inner cell mass. Rather, the inner cell mass rotates inside the trophoblast to align to the apposition.<ref name=boron/> In short, the entire surface of the blastocyst has a potential to form the apposition to the decidua.

===Adhesion===
Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.

The trophoblasts adhere by penetrating the endometrium, with protrusions of trophoblast cells.

====Communication====
There is massive communication between the blastocyst and the endometrium at this stage. The blastocyst signals to the endometrium to adapt further to its presence, e.g. by changes in the [[cytoskeleton]] of decidual cells. This, in turn, dislodges the decidual cells from their connection to the underlying [[basal lamina]], which enables the blastocyst to perform the succeeding invasion.<ref name=boron/>

This communication is conveyed by [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]-[[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-interactions, both integrin-matrix and proteoglycan ones.

=====proteoglycan receptors=====
Another ligand-receptor system involved in adhesion is proteoglycan receptors, found on the surface of the decidua of the uterus. Their counterparts, the proteoglycans, are found around the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst. This ligand-receptor system also is present just at the implantation window.<ref name=boron/>

===Invasion===
Invasion is an even further establishment of the blastocyst in the endometrium.

====Syncytiotrophoblasts====
The protrusions of trophoblast cells that adhere into the endometrium continue to proliferate and penetrate into the endometrium. As these trophoblast cells penetrate, they differentiate to become a new type of cells, [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The prefix syn- refers to the transformation that occurs as the boundaries between these cells disappear to form a single mass of many [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] ([[syncytium|a syncytium]]). The rest of the trophoblasts, surrounding the inner cell mass, are hereafter called [[cytotrophoblast]]s.

Invasion continues with the syncytiotrophoblasts reaching the basal membrane beneath the decidual cells, penetrating it and further invading into the uterine stroma. Finally, the whole embryo is embedded in the endometrium. Eventually, the syncytiotrophoblasts come into contact with maternal blood and form [[chorionic villi]]. This is the initiation of forming the [[placenta]].

====Secretions====
The blastocyst secretes factors for a multitude of purposes during invasion. It secretes several [[autocrine]] factors, targeting itself and stimulating it to further invade the endometrium.<ref name=boron/> Furthermore, secretions loosen decidual cells from each other, prevent the embryo from being rejected by the mother, trigger the final decidualization and prevent menstruation.

=====Autocrine=====
[[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] is an autocrine growth factor for the blastocyst.<ref name=boron/> [[Insulin-like growth factor 2]],<ref name=boron/> on the other hand, stimulates the invasiveness of it.

=====Dislodging=====
The syncytiotrophoblasts dislodges decidual cells in their way, both by degradation of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s linking the decidual cells together as well as degradation of the extracellular matrix between them.

Cell adhesion molecules are degraded by syncytiotrophoblast secretion of [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]]. This inhibits the expression of [[cadherins]] and [[beta-catenin]].<ref name=boron/> Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules, and beta-catenin helps to anchor them to the cell membrane. Inhibited expression of these molecules thus loosens the connection between decidual cells, permitting the syncytotrophoblasts and the whole embryo with them to invade into the endometrium.

The extracellular matrix is degraded by [[serine endopeptidases]] and [[metalloproteinase]]s. Examples of such metalloproteinases are [[collagenases]], [[gelatinases]] and [[stromelysin]]s.<ref name=boron/> These collagenases digest [[Type-I collagen]], [[Type-II collagen]], [[Type-III collagen]], Type-VII collagen and Type-X collagen.<ref name=boron/> The gelatinases exist in two forms; one digesting [[Type-IV collagen]] and one digesting [[gelatin]].<ref name=boron/>

=====Immunosuppressive=====
The embryo differs from the cells of the mother, and would be rejected as a parasite by the [[immune system]] of the mother if it didn't secrete [[immunosuppressive]] agents. Such agents are [[Platelet-activating factor]], [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], [[early pregnancy factor]], [[immunosuppressive factor]], [[Prostaglandin E]]2, [[Interleukin 1]]-alpha, [[Interleukin 6]], [[interferon]]-alpha, [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] and [[Colony-Stimulating Factor]].

=====Decidualization=====
Factors from the blastocyst also trigger the final formation of decidual cells into their proper form. In contrast, some decidual cells in the proximity of the blastocyst degenerate, providing nutrients for it.<ref name=boron/>

=====Prevention of menstruation=====
[[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) not only acts as an immunosuppressive,<ref name=boron/> but also "notifies" the mother's body that she is [[pregnant]], preventing menstruation by sustaining the function of the [[corpus luteum]].

=====Other factors=====
Other factors secreted by the blastocyst are;
*[[ovum factor]]
*Embryo-derived [[histamine-releasing factor]]
*[[Tissue plasminogen activator]] as well as its inhibitors
*[[Estradiol]]
*Î²1-[[integrin]]s
*[[Fibroblast growth factor]]
*[[Transforming growth factor alpha]]
*[[inhibin]]

==Failure==
{{visible anchor|Implantation failure}} has diverse causes, including abnormal [[cytokine]] and hormonal signaling as well as [[epigenetic alteration]]s.<ref name=Cakmak2011/> Recurrent implantation failure is a cause of [[female infertility]]. Therefore, [[pregnancy rate]]s can be improved by optimizing endometrial receptivity for implantation.<ref name=Cakmak2011/> Evaluation of implantation markers may help to predict pregnancy outcome and detect occult implantation deficiency.<ref name=Cakmak2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq037}}</ref>

[[Luteal support]] is the administration of medication, generally [[progestin]]s, for the purpose of increasing the success rate of implantation and early [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], thereby complementing the function of the [[corpus luteum]].
