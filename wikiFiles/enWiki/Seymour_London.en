'''Seymour B. London''' (July 1, 1915 &ndash; July 14, 2010) was an American [[physician]] and inventor who created the first automatic [[sphygmomanometer|blood pressure monitor]].

London was born on July 1, 1915, in [[Detroit]] and moved to [[Miami Beach, Florida]] as a youth together with his family, where he graduated from [[Miami Beach Senior High School]] in 1932. He earned his undergraduate degree at the [[University of Florida]], was awarded a master's degree from the [[University of Michigan]] and received his medical degree from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1940. He did an [[internship (medicine)|internship]] in cardiopulmonary medicine at [[Bellevue Hospital Center]], where he met and married Rose Perrone,a fellow medical student. He returned to Miami Beach after completing his medical training and operated a medical practice for 50 years together with his wife, who died in 2008. They helped found the [[University of Miami Miller School of Medicine]] and the [[Mount Sinai Medical Center & Miami Heart Institute|Miami Heart Institute at Mount Sinai Medical Center]].<ref name=MHObit>Morel, Laura C.

London developed the automated blood pressure machine after having to spend time on multiple occasions fumbling to take a patient's blood pressure by hand. He created the original prototype of his patented device using an old blood pressure cuff, a column of mercury, a pump from a fish tank and a microphone.<ref name=MHObit/> To demonstrate the accuracy of their device, London and his wife conducted a double blind study of 400 physicians at the 1965 annual convention of the [[American Medical Association]]. The study findings, which demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between the results taken automatically and those done by hand, were published in a November 1966 issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''.<ref>London, Rose E.; and London, Seymour B.

Accessed July 15, 2010.</ref> In addition to a United States patent, the device was also patented in [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. After his death, his daughter announced plans to donate the original model of the device to the Medical School of the University of Miami.<ref name=MHObit/>

London died at age 95 on July 14, 2010, at his home in Miami Beach due to [[heart disease]].<ref name=MHObit/>
