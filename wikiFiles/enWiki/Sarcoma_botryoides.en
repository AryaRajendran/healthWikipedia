'''Sarcoma botryoides''' or '''botryoid sarcoma'''<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000094526|botryoid sarcoma}}</ref> or '''botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma''' is a subtype of [[embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma]], that can be observed in the walls of hollow, mucosa lined structures such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, [[urinary bladder]] of infants and young children or the [[vagina]] in females, typically younger than age 8.  The name comes from the gross appearance of "grape bunches" (''botryoid'' in Greek).

==Histology==

Under the [[microscope]] one can see [[rhabdomyoblast]]s that may contain cross-striations. [[Tumor]] cells are crowded in a distinct layer beneath the vaginal [[epithelium]] ( [[cambium layer]]).

==Clinical characteristics==

For botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma of the vagina, the most common clinical finding is vaginal bleeding<ref>Rahaman, J and Cohen, CJ. Gynecologic Sarcomas. in Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine - 6th Ed. Kufe, DW et al. editors. BC Decker Inc, Hamilton, Ontario, 2003.</ref> but vaginal bleeding is not specific for sarcoma botryoides:  other [[vaginal cancer]]s are possible. They may appear as a polypoid mass, somewhat yellow in color and are friable: thus, they (possibly) may break off, leading to vaginal bleeding or infections.

==Epidemiology==

Sarcoma botryoides normally is found in children under 8 years of age.  Onset of [[symptom]]s occurs at age 3 years (38.3 months) on average.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hilgers R |title=Pelvic exenteration for vaginal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma: a review |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=175–80 |year=1975 |pmid=1090863}}</ref> Cases of older women with this condition have also been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reynolds E, Logani S, Moller K, Horowitz I |title=Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the uterus in a postmenopausal woman. Case report and review of the literature |journal=Gynecol Oncol |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=736–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16684558 |doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2006.03.033}}</ref>

==Treatment and prognosis==
The disease used to be uniformly fatal, with a 5-year survival rate between 10 to 35%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Piver M, Rose P |title=Long-term follow-up and complications of infants with vulvovaginal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=71 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=435–7 |year=1988 |pmid=3347430}}</ref> As a result, treatment was [[radical surgery]]. New multidrug [[chemotherapy]] regimens with or without [[radiation therapy]] are now used in combination with less radical surgery with good results, although outcome data are not yet available.<ref>Rotmensch, J and Yamada, SD.
