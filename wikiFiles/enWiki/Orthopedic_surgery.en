Further damage to the joint is visible due to the onset of arthritis - a bone/joint disease.]]'''Orthopedic surgery''' or '''orthopedics''' (also spelled '''orthopaedic surgery''' and '''orthopaedics''') is the branch of [[surgery]] concerned with conditions involving the [[musculoskeletal system]]. Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[Sports injury|sports injuries]], [[degenerative disease]]s, [[infection]]s, [[tumor]]s, and [[congenital disorder]]s.

[[Nicholas Andry]] coined the word "''orthopaedics''" in French as ''orthopédie'', derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''orthos'' ("correct", "straight") and ''paidion'' ("child"), when he published ''Orthopedie'' (translated as ''Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting and Preventing Deformities in Children'') in 1741. The correction of spinal and bony deformities became the cornerstone of orthopedic practice.

In the US the majority of college, university and residency programs, and even the [[American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons]], still use the spelling with the Latinate digraph [[ae (digraph)|ae]]. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are acceptable; ''orthopaedics'' usually prevails in the rest of the British Commonwealth, especially in the UK.

==History==
[[Image:X-ray3.jpg|175px|thumb|Orthopedic implants to repair fractures to the radius and ulna. Note the visible break in the ulna. (right forearm)]]

[[Jean-Andre Venel]] established the first orthopedic institute in 1780, which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities.  He is considered by some to be the father of orthopedics or the first true orthopaedic surgeon in consideration of the establishment of his hospital and for his published methods(7). 

[[Antonius Mathysen]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[military]] [[surgery|surgeon]], invented the [[plaster of Paris]] [[cast (orthopedic)|cast]] in 1851.
Many developments in orthopedic surgery resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the [[Middle Ages]] the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' [[blood]] which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] and [[Splint (medicine)|splinting]] developed during [[World War I]]. The use of [[intramedullary rod]]s to treat fractures of the [[femur]] and [[tibia]] was pioneered by [[Gerhard Küntscher]] of [[Germany]]. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during [[World War II]] and led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of [[bone fracture|fracture]]s in the rest of the world. However, traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late 1970s when the [[Harborview Medical Center]] in Seattle group popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture.  External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the [[Vietnam War]] but a major contribution was made by [[Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov]] in the [[USSR]]. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in [[Siberia]] in the 1950s. With no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, and malaligned fractures. With the help of the local [[bicycle]] shop he devised ring external [[fixator]]s tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment he achieved healing, realignment and [[Distraction osteogenesis|lengthening]] to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His [[Ilizarov apparatus]] is still used today as one of the [[distraction osteogenesis]] methods.

[[Ruth Jackson]] became the first female Board-certified Orthopaedic Surgeon in the U.S in 1937.  Orthopedics continues to be a male-dominated field.  In 2006, 12.4% of orthopedics residents were women.<ref name="JBJS Diversity">Day CS, Lage DE, Ahn CS.  Diversity Based on Race, Ethnicity, and Sex Between Academic Orthopaedic Surgery and Other Specialties: A Comparative Study.  J Bone Joint Surg Am. 2010: 92:2328-2335</ref>

David L. MacIntosh pioneered the first successful surgery for the management of the torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) of the [[knee]]. This common and serious injury in [[skiing|skiers]], field athletes, and [[dance]]rs invariably brought an end to their athletics due to permanent joint instability. Working with injured [[American football|football]] players, Dr MacIntosh devised a way to re-route viable [[ligament]] from adjacent structures to preserve the strong and complex mechanics of the knee joint and restore stability. The subsequent development of ACL reconstruction surgery has allowed numerous athletes to return to the demands of sports at all levels.

Modern orthopedic surgery and musculoskeletal research has sought to make surgery less invasive and to make implanted components better and more durable.

==Training==
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2011}}
In the United States, orthopedic surgeons have typically completed four years of undergraduate education and four years of medical school. Subsequently, these medical school graduates undergo [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] training in orthopedic surgery. The five-year residency consists of one year of general surgery training followed by four years of training in orthopedic surgery.

Selection for residency training in orthopedic surgery is very competitive.  Approximately 700 physicians complete orthopedic residency training per year in the United States.  About 10 percent of current orthopedic surgery residents are women; about 20 percent are members of minority groups. There are approximately 20,400 actively practicing orthopedic surgeons and residents in the United States.<ref>[http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00274 American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery]</ref> According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2011&ndash;2012) published by the [[United States Department of Labor]], between 3&ndash;4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further training, or fellowships, after completing their residency training. Fellowship training in an orthopedic subspecialty is typically one year in duration (sometimes two) and sometimes has a [[research]] component involved with the clinical and operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspecialty training in the United States are:

* Hand surgery
* Shoulder and elbow surgery
* Total joint reconstruction ([[arthroplasty]])
* Pediatric orthopedics
* [[Foot and ankle surgery]]
* Spine surgery
* Musculoskeletal oncology
* Surgical sports medicine
* Orthopedic trauma

These specialty areas of medicine are not exclusive to orthopedic surgery. For example, hand surgery is practiced by some plastic surgeons and spine surgery is practiced by most neurosurgeons. Additionally, foot and ankle surgery is practiced by board-certified Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) in the United States. Some family practice physicians practice sports medicine; however, their scope of practice is non-operative.

After completion of specialty [[Residency (medicine)|residency]]/[[Specialist registrar|registrar]] training, an orthopedic surgeon is then eligible for board certification by the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] or the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]]. Certification by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery]] means that the orthopedic surgeon has met the specified educational, evaluation, and examination requirements of the Board.<ref>[http://www.abos.org/ModDefault.aspx?module=Public&section=PubBoardCert American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aobos.org/mm/files/Candidate-Handbook-Master.pdf |title=AOBOS 2012 Candidate Handbook |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery |accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref>   The process requires successful completion of a standardized written exam followed by an oral exam focused on the surgeon's clinical and surgical performance over a 6-month period.  In Canada, the certifying organization is the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]]; in Australia and New Zealand it is the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]].

In the United States, specialists in hand surgery and orthopedic sports medicine may obtain a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in addition to their board primary certification by successfully completing a separate standardized examination.  There is no additional certification process for the other subspecialties.

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopedic surgeon involves 50–55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties and possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting. According to the AMGA Medical Group compensation and financial Survey, an Orthopedic surgeon's median salary is around $500,672.<ref>[http://www.cejkasearch.com/compensation-data/physician-compensation-data/]</ref>

==Arthroscopy==
The use of arthroscopic techniques has been particularly important for injured patients. [[Arthroscopy]] was pioneered in the early 1950s by Dr. [[Masaki Watanabe]] of Japan to perform minimally invasive cartilage surgery and reconstructions of torn ligaments.  Arthroscopy helped patients recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, 'open' surgery. It is a very popular technique. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today and is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty. The majority of orthopedic procedures are now performed arthroscopically.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Arthroplasty==
The modern total [[hip replacement]] was pioneered by Sir [[John Charnley]] in England in the 1960s.<ref name="Wroblewski2003">{{cite journal

}}</ref> He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by metal or high density [[polyethylene]] implants cemented to the bone with [[methyl methacrylate]] [[bone cement]]. Since Charnley, there have been continuous improvements in the design and technique of [[joint replacement]] (arthroplasty) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant.

Knee replacements using similar technology were started by McIntosh in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients and later by Gunston and Marmor for [[osteoarthritis]] in the 1970s developed by Dr. [[John Insall]] in New York utilizing a fixed bearing system, and by Dr. Frederick Buechel and Dr. Michael Pappas utilizing a mobile bearing system.<ref name="Hamelynck2006">{{cite journal

Uni-compartmental knee replacement, in which only one weight-bearing surface of an arthritic knee is replaced, is an alternative to a total knee replacement in a select patient population.

Joint replacements are available for other joints on a limited basis, most notably shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle, spine, and fingers.

In recent years, surface replacement of joints, in particular the hip joint, have become more popular amongst younger and more active patients. This type of operation delays the need for the more traditional and less bone-conserving total hip replacement, but carries significant risks of early failure from fracture and bone death.

One of the main problems with joint replacements is wear of the bearing surfaces of components.  This can lead to damage to surrounding bone and contribute to eventual failure of the implant.  Use of alternative bearing surfaces has increased in recent years, particularly in younger patients, in an attempt to improve the wear characteristics of joint replacement components.  These include ceramics and all-metal implants (as opposed to the original metal-on-plastic).  The plastic (actually ultra high-molecular-weight polyethylene) can also be altered in ways that may improve wear characteristics.
