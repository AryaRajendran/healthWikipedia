The catheter itself is composed of (a) a tip for insertion into the vein, (b) wings for manual handling and securing the catheter with adhesives, (c) a valve to allow injection of drugs with a syringe, (d) an end which allows connection to an intravenous infusion line, and capping in between uses.<br/>

In [[medicine]], a '''peripheral venous catheter''' ('''PVC''' or ''peripheral venous line'' or ''peripheral venous access catheter'') is a [[catheter]] (small, flexible tube) placed into a [[peripheral vein]] in order to administer medication or [[Intravenous therapy|fluids]]. Upon insertion, the line can be used to [[Venipuncture|draw blood]].

The catheter is introduced into the vein by a needle (similar to blood drawing), which is subsequently removed while the small tube of the cannula remains in place. The catheter is then fixed by taping it to the patient's skin (unless there is allergy to adhesives). Newer catheters have been equipped with additional safety features to avoid [[needlestick injury|needlestick injuries]]. Modern catheters consist of synthetic polymers such as [[teflon]] (hence the often used term 'Venflon' or 'Cathlon' for these venous catheters).

A peripheral venous catheter is the most commonly used vascular access in medicine. It is given to most [[emergency room]] and [[surgery|surgical]] patients, and before some [[radiology|radiological]] imaging techniques using [[radiocontrast]], for example. In the United States, more than 25 million patients get a peripheral venous line each year.<ref name="pmid9508225">{{cite journal |author=Soifer NE, Borzak S, Edlin BR, Weinstein RA |title=Prevention of peripheral venous catheter complications with an intravenous therapy team: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Arch.

A peripheral venous catheter is usually placed in a vein on the hand or arm. It should be distinguished from a [[central venous catheter]] which is inserted in a central vein (usually in the [[internal jugular vein]] of the neck or the [[subclavian vein]] of the chest), or an [[arterial catheter]] which can be placed in a peripheral as well as a central artery. In children, a local [[anaesthetic]] gel (such as [[lidocaine]]) is applied to the insertion site to facilitate placement.

== Complications ==
Infection, [[phlebitis]], [[Extravasation (intravenous)|extravasation]], [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltration]], [[air embolism]], [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding) and formation of a [[hematoma]] (bruise) may occur.

Because of the risk of insertion-site infection the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] advises in their guideline that the catheter needs to be replaced every 96 hours.<ref>{{cite web
