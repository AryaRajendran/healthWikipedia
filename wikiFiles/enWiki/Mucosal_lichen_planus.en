'''Mucosal lichen planus''', or '''oral lichen planus''' (OLP), is [[lichen planus]] (an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[auto-immune]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} [[disease]]) that affects [[oral mucosa]], with or without the involvement of the [[skin]] and other [[mucous membrane]]s.

== Epidemiology ==
OLP affects women more  than men (at a ratio of 3:2), and occurs most often in middle-aged adults. OLP in children is rare.

== Cause ==
The cause of lichen planus is not known. It is not [[Contagious disease|contagious]]<ref>[http://www.hmc.psu.edu/healthinfo/jkl/lichenplanus.htm Penn State College of Medicine - Lichen Planus]</ref> and does not involve any known [[pathogen]].
<br />OLP has been reported as a complication of chronic [[hepatitis C]] virus infection and can be a sign of chronic [[graft-versus-host disease]] of the mucous membrane (and skin).
<br />It has been suggested that OLP may respond to [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], where lesions may present on the mucosa (or skin) during times of stress in those with the disease.

== Clinical presentation ==
OLP may present in one of three forms.
*The '''reticular form''' is the most common presentation and manifests as white lacy streaks on the mucosa (known as [[Wickham's striae]]) or as smaller papules (small raised area).  The lesions tend to be bilateral and are asymptomatic.  The lacy streaks may also be seen on other parts of the mouth, including the gingiva (gums), the tongue, palate and lips.
*The '''bullous form''' presents as fluid-filled vesicles which project from the surface.
*The '''erosive form''' presents with erythematous (red) areas that are ulcerated and uncomfortable.  The erosion of the thin epithelium may occur in multiple areas of the mouth, or in one area, such as the gums, where they resemble [[desquamative gingivitis]].  Wickham's striae may also be seen near these ulcerated areas.  This form may undergo malignant transformation.

Lichen planus may also affect the genital mucosa - vulvovaginal-gingival lichen planus. It can resemble other skin conditions such as [[atopic dermatitis]] and [[psoriasis]].

Rarely, lichen planus shows esophageal involvement, where it can present with erosive esophagitis and stricturing.  It has also been hypothesized that it is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Histo-pathological appearance ==
The microscopic appearance of lichen planus is pathognomonic for the condition
*[[Hyperparakeratosis]] with thickening of the granular cell layer
*Development of a "saw-tooth" appearance of the [[Epidermis (skin)|rete pegs]]
*Degeneration of the [[basal cell layer]]
*Infiltration of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[white blood cell|cells]] into the subepithelial layer of connective tissue
*Max-joseph space is seen .

== Differential Diagnosis ==
The clinical presentation of OLP may also resemble other conditions, including:
*  [[Lichenoid drug reaction]]. This entity is identical to OLP both clinically and histologically. However, lichenoid lesions may be single (in comparison to the usual bilateral appearance of OLP) with proximity to amalgam (metal alloys) dental restoration.
*  Other oral vesiculo-ulcerative conditions such as [[Pemphigus vulgaris]] and [[Benign mucous membrane pemphigoid]]
*  [[Discoid lupus erythematosus]]
*  [[Chronic ulcerative stomatitis]]
*  Frictional [[keratosis]] and [[Morsicatio buccarum]] (chronic [[cheek]] biting)
*  Oral [[leukoplakia]]
*  Chronic [[graft-versus-host-disease]] may manifest as [[lichenoid reaction of graft-versus-host disease|lichenoid reaction]]. This type of lichenoid lesions have a higher risk of [[malignant transformation]] to oral [[squamous cell carcinoma]] in comparison to the classical oral lichen planus. Graft-versus-host-disease-associated [[oral cancer]] may have more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis, when compared to oral cancer in non-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients.<ref name="HSCT">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Zeevi I, ''et al.'' |title=Oral cancer in patients after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: long-term follow-up suggests an increased risk for recurrence |journal=Transplantation |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1243–4 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21119507 |doi=10.1097/TP.0b013e3181f9caaa}}</ref>
A [[biopsy]] is useful in identifying histological features that help differentiate OLP from these conditions, except of the histologically identical lichenoid reaction lesion (including [[lichenoid reaction of graft-versus-host disease]]). Frictional keratosis and morsicatio buccarum can and should be diagnosed clinically without histo-pathlogical examination.

== Treatment ==
Care of OLP is within the scope of [[Oral medicine]] speciality. It is generally accepted that OLP (as well as other mucous membrane lichen planus, such as genital) is more difficult to manage than skin lichen planus.

Currently there is no cure for lichen planus but there are certain types of medicines used to reduce the effects of the inflammation. Lichen planus may go into a dormant state after treatment. There are also reports that lichen planus can flare up years after it is considered cured.

Medicines used to treat lichen planus include:
* [[Wiktionary:oral|Oral]] and [[topical]] [[steroids]].
* Oral [[retinoids]]
* [[immunosuppressant]] medications
* [[hydroxychloroquine]]
* [[tacrolimus]]
* [[dapsone]]
* [[Aloe vera]]<ref name="pmid18093246">{{cite journal |author=Choonhakarn C, Busaracome P, Sripanidkulchai B, Sarakarn P |title=The efficacy of aloe vera gel in the treatment of oral lichen planus: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Br.
