In surgical jargon, to create an '''[[anastomosis]]''' is to join together two hollow organs ([[viscus]]), usually to restore continuity after [[Segmental resection|resection]], or to bypass an unresectable disease process. Historically such procedures were performed with suture material, but increasingly mechanical staplers and [[biological glue]]s are employed. While an anastomosis may be end-to-end, equally it could be performed side-to-side or end-to-side depending on the circumstances of the required reconstruction or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass]]. The term '''reanastomosis''' is also used to describe a surgical reconnection usually reversing a prior surgery to disconnect an anatomical [[anastomosis]], e.g. [[tubal reversal]] after [[tubal ligation]].

Anastomosis are typically performed on:

* '''Blood vessels:''' [[Arteries]] and [[veins]]. Most vascular procedures, including all [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|arterial bypass]] operations (e.g. [[coronary artery bypass]]), [[aneurysmectomy]] of any type, and all solid [[organ transplants]] require vascular anastomoses.  An anastomosis connecting an artery to a vein is also used to create an arteriovenous [[fistula]] as an access for [[hemodialysis]].

* '''Gastrointestinal (GI) tract:''' [[Esophagus]], [[stomach]], [[small bowel]], [[large bowel]], [[bile ducts]], and [[pancreas]]. Virtually all elective resections of gastrointestinal organs are followed by anastomoses to restore continuity; [[pancreaticoduodenectomy]] is considered a massive operation, in part, because it requires three separate anastomoses (stomach, biliary tract and pancreas to small bowel). Bypass operations on the GI tract, once rarely performed, are the cornerstone of [[bariatric surgery]]. The widespread use of mechanical suturing devices (linear and circular staplers) changed the face of gastrointestinal surgery.

* '''Urinary tract:''' [[Ureters]], [[urinary bladder]], [[urethra]]. [[Radical prostatectomy]] and [[radical cystectomy]] both require anastomosis of the bladder to the [[urethra]] in order to restore continuity.

* '''[[Microsurgery]]''': The advent of microsurgical technique allowed anastomoses previously thought impossible, such as so-called "nerve anastomoses" (not strictly an anastomosis according to the above definition), and operations to restore fertility after [[tubal ligation]] or [[vasectomy]].

Fashioning an anastomosis is typically a complex and time-consuming step in a surgical operation, but almost always crucial to the outcome of the procedure.
