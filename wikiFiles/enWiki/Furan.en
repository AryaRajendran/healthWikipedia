'''Furan''' is a [[Heterocyclic compound|heterocyclic]] [[organic compound]], consisting of a five-membered [[aromatic]] ring with four carbon atoms and one oxygen.  The class of compounds containing such rings are also referred to as furans. 

Furan is a colorless, [[flammable]], highly [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid with a [[boiling point]] close to room temperature. It is soluble in common organic solvents, including alcohol, ether and acetone, but is slightly soluble in water.<ref>{{cite book | author = Hans Dieter Jakubke | author2 = Hans Jeschkeit | translator = Mary Eagleson| title = Concise Encyclopedia of Chemistry
| publisher = Walter de Gruyter | ISBN= 0-89925-457-8|  pages = 001-1201| year = 1994
}}</ref> It is [[toxic]] and may be [[carcinogenic]]. Furan is used as a starting point to other [[specialty chemicals]].<ref name =ullmann/>

== History ==

The name ''furan'' comes from the Latin ''furfur'', which means [[bran]].<ref>Alexander Senning. ''Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology''. Elsevier, '''2006'''. ISBN 0-444-52239-5.</ref> The first furan derivative to be described was [[2-furoic acid]], by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] in 1780. Another important derivative, [[furfural]], was reported by [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]] in 1831 and characterised nine years later by [[John Stenhouse]]. Furan itself was first prepared by [[Heinrich Limpricht]] in 1870, although he called it ''tetraphenol''.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Ueber das Tetraphenol C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O | pages = pp.&nbsp;90&ndash;91 | first = H. | last = Limpricht | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | year = 1870 | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | doi =10.1002/cber.18700030129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Ernest Harry | last = Rodd | title = Chemistry of Carbon Compounds: A Modern Comprehensive Treatise | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1971}}</ref>

==Health effects and prevalence in the diet==
Furan at a dose of 2&nbsp;mg/kg body weight (bw) and 4&nbsp;mg/kg bw has been shown to cause bile duct cancer in rats and liver cancer in mice (National Toxicology Program, 1993; Moser et al. 2009). No long term trials on the adverse effects of furan on human health have been conducted. Furan is found in coffee and in canned and jarred food, including baby food (http://voices.yahoo.com/the-carcinogen-furan-found-coffee-baby-food-11230244.html?cat=70).

==Production==
Industrially, furan is manufactured by the palladium-catalyzed decarbonylation of [[furfural]], or by the copper-catalyzed oxidation of [[1,3-butadiene]]:<ref name = ullmann>{{Ullmann | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a12_119.pub2 | title = Furfural and Derivatives | author = H. E. Hoydonckx, W. M. Van Rhijn, W. Van Rhijn, D. E. De Vos, P. A. Jacobs}}</ref>

:[[File:Manufacture of furan.png|500px]]

In the laboratory, furan can be obtained from [[furfural]] by oxidation to furan-2-carboxylic acid, followed by decarboxylation.<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Wilson, W.C. | title =  Furan | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 274 | year = 1941 | prep = cv1p0274}}</ref> It can also be prepared directly by [[thermal decomposition]] of [[pentose]]-containing materials, cellulosic solids especially pine-wood.

===Synthesis of furans===
The [[Feist–Benary synthesis]] is a classic way to synthesize furans, although many syntheses have been developed.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Hou XL, Cheung HY, Hon TY, Kwan PL, Lo TH, Tong SY, Wong HNC| year = 1998 | volume = 54 | pages = 1955–2020 | title = Regioselective syntheses of substituted furans | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4020(97)10303-9 | journal = [[Tetrahedron (journal)|Tetrahedron]]| issue = 10}}</ref> One of the simplest synthesis methods for furans is the reaction of [[ketone|1,4-diketone]]s with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) in the [[Paal–Knorr synthesis]]. The [[thiophene]] formation reaction of 1,4-diketones with [[Lawesson's reagent]] also forms furans as side products. Many routes exist for the synthesis of substituted furans.<ref>Katritzky, A. R.; Hur, D.; Kirichenko, K.; Ji, Y.; Steel, P. J. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/ark/5550190.0005.208/1/--synthesis-of-24-disubstituted-furans-and-46-diaryl?rgn=DLPSTEXTCLASS;view=image;rgn1=author;q1=Katritzky] ARKIVOC, Volume 2004, p. 109 (2004).</ref>

==Chemistry==
Furan is [[aromatic]] because one of the [[lone pair]]s of [[electron]]s on the oxygen atom is [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] into the ring, creating a 4n+2 aromatic system (see [[Hückel's rule]]) similar to [[benzene]].  Because of the aromaticity, the molecule is flat and lacks discrete [[double bond]]s. The other lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom extends in the plane of the flat ring system.  The [[Orbital hybridisation|sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization]] is to allow one of the lone pairs of oxygen to reside in a [[p orbital]] and thus allow it to interact within the pi-system.

Due to its aromaticity, furan's behavior is quite dissimilar to that of the more typical heterocyclic [[ether]]s such as [[tetrahydrofuran]]. 
* It is considerably more reactive than [[benzene]] in [[electrophilic substitution]] reactions, due to the electron-donating effects of the oxygen heteroatom. Examination of the resonance contributors shows the increased electron density of the ring, leading to increased rates of electrophilic substitution.<ref>{{cite book |title=Organic Chemistry |edition=Fifth |last=Bruice |first=Paula Y. |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0-13-196316-3}}</ref>

* Furan serves as a [[diene]] in [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s with electron-deficient [[dienophile]]s such as ethyl (E)-3-nitroacrylate.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The oxanorbornene approach to 3-hydroxy, 3,4-dihydroxy and 3,4,5-trihydroxy derivatives of 2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid | author =  Masesane I, Batsanov A, Howard J, Modal R, Steel P | journal = [[Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry]] | year = 2006 | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | doi = 10.1186/1860-5397-2-9 | pages = 9 | pmid = 16674802 | pmc = 1524792}}</ref> The reaction product is a mixture of isomers with preference for the [[endo isomer]]:

* [[Hydrogenation]] of furans affords sequentially dihydrofurans and [[tetrahydrofuran]]s.
* In the [[Achmatowicz reaction]], furans converted to dihydropyran compounds.
