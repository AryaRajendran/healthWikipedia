[[Image:FoodSourcesOfMagnesium.jpg|thumb|right|A selection of foods consumed by humans. However, the human diet can vary widely.]]

In [[nutrition]], '''diet''' is the sum of food consumed by a person or other [[organism]].<ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/diet_1?view=uk noun, def 1] askoxford.com</ref> '''Dietary habits''' are the habitual decisions an individual or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. The word '''diet''' often implies the use of specific intake of [[nutrition]] for [[#Health|health]] or [[#Diets for weight management|weight-management]] reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are [[omnivores]], each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos. This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy. 

Proper nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|mineral]]s, and [[food energy]] in the form of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, [[vegetable oil]]s, and [[fat]]s. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in the [[quality of life]], [[health]] and [[longevity]]. It can define cultures and play a role in [[religion]].

== Religious and cultural dietary choices ==
Some cultures and religions have restrictions concerning what foods are acceptable in their diet. For example, only [[Kashrut|Kosher foods]] are permitted by [[Judaism]], and [[Halal|Halal foods]] by [[Islam]].  Although [[Buddhist]]s are generally [[Buddhist vegetarianism|vegetarians]], the practice varies and meat-eating may be permitted depending on the sects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soulcurrymagazine.com/sc/buddhism-vegetarianism-non-vegetarianism.html |title=Buddhism & Vegetarianism |publisher=Soul Curry |date=November 1, 2008 }}</ref>  In [[Hinduism]], [[Diet in Hinduism|vegetarianism]] is the ideal, but meat-eating is not banned. [[Jain]] are more or less strictly vegetarian.

== Dietary choices ==
Many people choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees (e.g. [[flexitarianism]], [[vegetarianism]], [[veganism]], [[fruitarianism]]) for health reasons, issues surrounding morality, or to reduce their personal impact on the environment. [[Raw foodism]] is another contemporary trend. These diets may require tuning or supplementation such as vitamins to meet ordinary nutritional needs.

== Weight management ==
{{Main|Dieting|Diet food}}
A particular diet may be chosen to seek weight loss or weight gain. Changing a subject's dietary intake, or "going on a diet", can change the energy balance and increase or decrease the amount of fat stored by the body. Some foods are specifically recommended, or even altered, for conformity to the requirements of a particular diet. These diets are often recommended in conjunction with [[exercise]]. Specific weight loss programs can be harmful to health, while others may be beneficial (and can thus be coined as [[#Health|healthy diets]]). The terms "healthy diet" and "diet for weight management" are often related, as the two promote healthy weight management. Having a healthy diet is a way to prevent health problems, and will provide your body with the right balance of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/tc/healthy-eating-overview |title=Healthy Eating: Benefits of a Helathier Diet |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref>

=== Eating disorders ===
{{Main|Eating disorder}}
An [[eating disorder]] is a mental disorder that interferes with normal food consumption. It is defined by abnormal eating habits that may involve either insufficient or excessive diet.

== Health ==
{{Main|Healthy diet}}
A [[healthy diet]] may improve or maintain optimal [[health]]. In [[developed countries]], affluence enables unconstrained caloric intake and possibly inappropriate food choices.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/health/policy/25vegetables.html "Told to Eat Its Vegetables, America Orders Fries"] article by Kim Severson in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 24, 2010, accessed September 25, 2010</ref>

It is recommended by many authorities that people maintain a normal weight by (limiting consumption of energy-dense foods and sugary drinks), eat plant-based food, limit red and processed meat, and limit alcohol.<ref>{{cite book|title=EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Policy and Action for Cancer Prevention Food, Nutrition, and Physical Activity|year=2010|isbn=978-0-9722-5225-6|pages=1}}</ref> However, there is no total consensus on what constitutes a healthy diet.
