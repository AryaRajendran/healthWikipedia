The '''pinworm''' (in the United States) ([[genus]] '''''Enterobius'''''), also known as '''threadworm''' (in the United Kingdom) or '''seatworm''', is a [[nematode]] (roundworm) and a common [[intestinal parasite]], especially in humans.<ref name="britannica">[[#britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]].</ref> The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as [[enterobiasis]],<ref name="mw_enterobiasis">[[#mw|Merriam-Webster: Enterobiasis]]</ref> or less precisely as ''oxyuriasis'' in reference to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Oxyuridae]].<ref name="mw_oxyuriasis">[[#mw oxyuriasis|Merriam-Webster: Oxyuriasis]]</ref>

Throughout this article the word ''Pinworm'' refers to ''Enterobius''. In British usage, however, ''pinworm'' refers to ''[[Strongyloides]]'' while ''Enterobius'' is called ''threadworm''.<ref>[[#vanderkooi2000|Vanderkooi 2000]], p. B-152 & B-225</ref>

== Classification ==

The pinworm (genus ''Enterobius'') is a type of [[roundworm]] (nematode), and three species of pinworm have been identified with certainty.<ref name="NCBI">[[#ncbi|NCBI taxonomy database 2009]]</ref> Humans are hosts only to ''Enterobius vermicularis'' (formerly ''Oxyuris vermicularis'').<ref name="dpdx">[[#dpdx|dpdx 2009]]</ref> [[Chimpanzee]]s are host to ''Enterobius anthropopitheci'', which is [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinguishable from the human pinworm.<ref name="hasegawa2006">[[#hasegawa2006|Hasegawa et al. 2006]]</ref> Hugot (1983) claims there is another species affecting humans, ''Enterobius gregorii'', which is supposedly a [[sister species]] of ''E. vermicularis'', and has a slightly smaller [[spicule]] (i.e., sexual organ).<ref name="Hugot 1983">[[#hugot1983|Hugot 1983]]</ref> Its existence is controversial however; Totkova et al. (2003) consider there to be insufficient evidence,<ref name="totkova2003">[[#totkova2003|Totkova et al. 2003]]</ref> and Hasagawa et al. (2006) contend that ''E. gregorii'' is a younger stage of ''E. vermicularis''.<ref name="hasegawa1998">[[#hasegawa1998|Hasegawa et al. 1998]]</ref><ref name="hasegawa2006" /> Regardless of its status as a distinct species, ''E. gregorii'' is considered clinically identical to ''E. vermicularis''.<ref name="dpdx"/>

== Morphology ==
[[File:Threadworm.jpg|thumb|left|Two female pinworms next to a ruler. The markings are one millimeter apart.]]
The adult female has a sharply pointed [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] end, is 8 to 13 millimeters long, and 0.5 millimeter thick.<ref name="gutierrez2000p354">[[#gutierrez2000|Gutiérrez 2005]], p. 354.</ref> The adult male is considerably smaller, measuring 2 to 5 millimeters long and 0.2 millimeter thick, and has a curved posterior end.<ref name="gutierrez2000p354" /> The eggs are [[translucent]]<ref name="gutierrez2000p354" /> and have a surface that adheres to environmental objects.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> The eggs measure 50 to 60 [[micrometer]]s by 20 to 30 micrometers, and have a thick shell that is flattened on one side.<ref name="gutierrez2000p354" /> The small size and colourlessness of the eggs make them invisible to the naked eye, except in barely visible clumps of thousands of eggs. Eggs may contain a developing [[embryo]] or a fully developed pinworm [[larva]].<ref name="gutierrez2000p354" />  The larvae grow to 140–150 micrometers in length.<ref name="cook1994p1159">[[#cook1994|Cook 1994]], p. 1159</ref>

==Distribution==
The pinworm has a worldwide distribution,<ref name="gutierrez2000p355">[[#gutierrez2000|Gutiérrez 2005]], p. 355.</ref> and is the most common [[helminth]] (i.e., parasitic worm) infection in the United States and Western Europe.<ref name="burkhart2005p837">[[#burkhart2005|Burkhart & burkhart 2005]], p. 837</ref>  In the United States, a study by the [[Center of Disease Control]] reported an overall [[incidence rate]] of 11.4% among people of all ages.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> Pinworms are particularly common in children, with [[prevalence rate]]s in this age group having been reported as high as 61% in India, 50% in England, 39% in Thailand, 37% in Sweden, and 29% in Denmark.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> [[Finger sucking]] has been shown to increase both incidence and relapse rates,<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> and [[nail biting]] has been similarly associated.<ref name="cook1994p1160">[[#cook1994|Cook 1994]], p. 1160</ref> Because it spreads from host to host through [[contamination]], pinworms are common among people living in close contact, and tends to occur in all people within a household.<ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> The prevalence of pinworms is not associated with gender,<ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> nor with any particular social class, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], or culture.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> Pinworms are an exception to the tenet that intestinal parasites are uncommon in affluent communities.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> The earliest known instance of pinworms is evidenced by pinworm eggs found in [[coprolite]], [[carbon dated]] to 7837 BC at western [[Utah]].<ref name="cook1994p1159" />

==Life cycle==
[[File:Enterobius vermicularis LifeCycle.gif|thumb|Pinworm life cycle.]]
The entire life cycle—from egg to adult—takes place in the [[human gastrointestinal tract]] of a single human host.<ref name="gutierrez2000p354" /><ref name="cook1994p1159"/> Cook et al. (2009) and Burkhart & Burkhart (2005) disagree over the length of this process, with Cook et al. stating two to four weeks,<ref name="cook2009p1516">[[#cook2009|Cook et al. 2009]], p. 1516</ref> while Burkhart & Burkhart states that it takes from four to eight weeks.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" />

The life cycle begins with eggs being [[ingestion|ingested]].<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> The eggs hatch in the [[duodenum]] (i.e., first part of the [[small intestine]]).<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> The emerging pinworm [[larva]]e grow rapidly to a size of 140 to 150 micrometers in size,<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> and migrate through the small intestine towards the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> During this migration they [[moult]] twice and become adults.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /><ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> Females survive for 5 to 13 weeks, and males about 7 weeks.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> The male and female pinworms mate in the [[ileum]] (i.e., last part of the small intestine),<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> whereafter the male pinworms usually die,<ref name="garcia1999p246">[[#garcia1999|Garcia 1999]], p. 246</ref> and are passed out with stool.<ref name="caldwell1982p307">[[#caldwell1982|Caldwell 1982]], p. 307.</ref>  The gravid female pinworms settle in the [[ileum]], [[caecum]] (i.e., beginning of the [[large intestine]]), [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and [[ascending colon]],<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> where they attach themselves to the [[mucosa]]<ref name="burkhart2005p837" />  and ingest colonic contents.<ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> Almost the entire body of a [[gravid]] female becomes filled with eggs.<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> The estimations of the number of eggs in a gravid female pinworm range from about 11,000<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> to 16,000.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> The egg-laying process begins approximately five weeks after initial ingestion of pinworm eggs by the human host.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> The gravid female pinworms migrate through the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] towards the [[rectum]] at a rate of 12 to 14 centimeters per hour.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> They emerge from the [[anus]], and while moving on the skin near the anus, the female pinworms deposit eggs either through (1) contracting and expelling the eggs, (2) dying and then disintegrating, or (3) bodily rupture due to the host scratching the worm.<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> After depositing the eggs, the female becomes [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and dies.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" /> The reason the female emerges from the anus is to obtain the oxygen necessary for the maturation of the eggs.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" />

==Transmission==

Pinworms spread through human-to-human [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], by [[ingesting]] (i.e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs and/or by anal insertion.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="garcia1999p246" /> The eggs are hardy and can remain viable (i.e., infectious) in a moist environment for up to three weeks.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" /><ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> They do not tolerate heat well, but can survive in low temperatures: two-thirds of the eggs are still viable after 18 hours at −8 degrees Celsius (18 °F).<ref name="caldwell1982p307" />

After the eggs have been initially deposited near the anus, they are readily transmitted to other surfaces through [[contamination]].<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> The surface of the eggs is sticky when laid,<ref name="cook1994p1159" /><ref name="caldwell1982p307" /> and the eggs are readily transmitted from their initial deposit near the anus to fingernails, hands, night-clothing and bed linen.<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> From here, eggs are further transmitted to food, water, furniture, toys, bathroom [[plumbing fixture|fixtures]] and other objects.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /><ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="garcia1999p246" /> Household pets often carry the eggs in their fur, while not actually being infected.<ref name="caldwell1982p308">[[#caldwell1982|Caldwell 1982]], p. 308.</ref> Dust containing eggs can become airborne and widely dispersed when dislodged from surfaces, for instance when shaking out bed clothes and linen.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" /><ref name="caldwell1982p308" /><ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> Consequently the eggs can enter the mouth and nose through inhalation, and be swallowed later.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" /><ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="cook2009p1516" /><ref name="garcia1999p246" /> Although pinworms do not strictly multiply inside the body of their human host,<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> some of the pinworm larvae may hatch on the anal [[mucosa]], and migrate up the [[bowel]] and back into the [[gastrointestinal tract]] of the original host.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="cook2009p1516" /> This process is called ''retroinfection''.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" /><ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> According to Burkhart (2005), when this retroinfection occurs, it leads to a heavy [[parasitic]] load and ensures that the pinworm infestation continues.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> This statement is contradictory to a statement by Caldwelli (1982), who contends that retroinfection is rare and not clinically significant.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" /> Despite the limited, 13 week lifespan of individual pinworms,<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> [[autoinfection]] (i.e., infection from the original host to itself), either through the anus-to-mouth route or through retroinfection, causes the pinworms to inhabit the same host indefinitely.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" />

==Effect on host==
{{Main|Enterobiasis}}

In humans, enterobius vermicularis causes the medical condition [[enterobiasis]], whose primary symptom is [[itching]] in the [[Anus|anal]] area.<ref>{{cite web |title= Enterobiasis leads to itching |url= http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Threadworms.htm |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref>
