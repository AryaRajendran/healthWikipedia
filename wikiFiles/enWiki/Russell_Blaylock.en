'''Russell L. Blaylock''' is a retired [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] and author. He is a former clinical assistant professor of neurosurgery at the [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]] and is currently a visiting professor in the biology department at [[Belhaven College]].<ref name="belhaven1">[https://www.belhaven.edu/Academics/Biology/faculty.htm Belhaven College Biology Department Faculty]</ref> He is the author of a number of books and papers, including ''Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills'' (1994), ''Health and Nutrition Secrets That Can Save Your Life'' (2002), and ''Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients'' (2003), and writes a monthly newsletter, the ''Blaylock Wellness Report''.

Blaylock has endorsed views inconsistent with the scientific consensus, including that food additives such as [[aspartame]] and [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) are [[excitotoxic]] in normal doses and that the [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine|H1N1 influenza (swine flu) vaccine]] carries more risk than swine flu itself.<ref name=Aspartame>{{cite journal |author=Magnuson BA, Burdock GA, Doull J, ''et al.'' |title=Aspartame: a safety evaluation based on current use levels, regulations, and toxicological and epidemiological studies |journal=Crit.

Blaylock has also urged avoidance of the swine flu (H1N1) vaccination, which he claims is more dangerous than the infection itself. In various alternative media outlets, Blaylock has given advice on what he feels an individual should do if faced with mandatory vaccination.<ref>[http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/14891 "What to do if you are forced to take swine flu shot"] Blaylock R., Canada Free Press, 19 September 2009.</ref> Current research indicates that an effective vaccine is a vital tool in protecting the public and that the new H1N1 vaccine is both safe and effective.<ref name=H1N1Vaccine/><ref name="Vaccine approval news release">{{cite web | url =  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_89221.html | title = NIH studies  on Swine flu vaccine  | publisher = NIH | accessdate = 2009-10-15}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Advertisements selling the 'Blaylock Wellness Report' at [[newsmax.com]] contain claims of additional health dangers, including [[Opposition to water fluoridation|fluoridated drinking water]], fluoridated toothpaste, [[vaccine controversy|vaccines]], [[dental amalgam controversy|dental amalgam]], [[Statin#Safety|cholesterol drugs]], pesticides, and [[Aluminium poisoning|aluminum cookware]].<ref name=newsmaxcom>The following advertisements for [http://w3.newsmax.com/blaylock/2.cfm The Blaylock Wellness Report] make these claims: [http://w3.newsmax.com/blaylock/26a.cfm Mercury: Save Your Body From Nature's Deadly Poison], [http://w3.newsmax.com/blaylock/11.cfm Autism], [http://w3.newsmax.com/blaylock/4a.cfm Why Fluoride Is Toxic], and [http://w3.newsmax.com/blaylock/40a.cfm Food Additives].

== Views on politics ==
Blaylock wrote that the Medical University of South Carolina (where he did his internship) was "deeply embroiled in a leftist-initiated war on Western Culture". He called the American medical system 'collectivist', and blamed this collectivism for the retirement of his friend [[Miguel Faria]]. Blaylock wrote that it was around this time that he began "exploring for the first time some of the classics of liberty", including [[Frédéric Bastiat]]'s ''[[The Law (1850 book)|The Law]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' and ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]'', and works by [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Murray Rothbard]].<ref> Need we say more?
