The '''death of Savita Halappanavar''' on 28 October 2012, at [[University Hospital Galway]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], led to nationwide protests&mdash;which spilled over into India, England and many other countries&mdash;calling for a review of the [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|abortion laws]] in Ireland. Halappanavar, a [[Hindu]] of [[India]]n origin, was suffering from a [[miscarriage]] when she was some 17 weeks pregnant, and she sought medical attention and treatment at University Hospital Galway. The hospital told them the foetus was not viable, but they could not perform an [[abortion]] under Irish Law as the foetus's heart was still beating. During the next several days, Halappanavar was diagnosed with [[septicemia]] which lead to [[multiple organ failure]] and her death.<ref name="mcdonaldguardiannov14">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/14/ireland-abortion-scrutiny-death|title=Ireland abortion policy under scrutiny after woman's death | World news | The Guardian|first1=Henry|last1=McDonald|first2=Ben|last2=Quinn|date=Wednesday 14 November 2012|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>

==Background==
{{main|Abortion in the Republic of Ireland}}
Under [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]], according to the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], as amended, an unlawful act of abortion is a [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland#Law|criminal offence]] punishable by imprisonment.<ref name="daily12">{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2232676/Savita-Halappanavar-dies-Irish-doctors-refuse-abortion-saying-This-Catholic-country.html|title=Miscarrying mother dies after Irish doctors refuse abortion, saying: 'This is a Catholic country'| work=Daily Mail|date=14 November 2012}}</ref> Following a ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] in 1992&mdash;now known in Ireland as the [[Attorney General v. X|X case]]&mdash;terminations are allowed under certain circumstances, where "a pregnant woman's life was at risk because of pregnancy, including the risk of suicide".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/most-tds-will-back-legislation-on-x-case-3296831.html|title= Most TDs will back legislation on X Case|work=Irish Independent|date=18 November 2012}}</ref>

The court ruling has not been codified into law. Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: "The current situation is like a [[sword of Damocles]] hanging over us. If we do something with a good intention, but it turns out to be illegal, the consequences are extremely serious for medical practitioners."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/world/europe/inquiry-sought-in-death-in-ireland-after-abortion-was-denied.html Inquiry Sought in Death in Ireland After Abortion Was Denied] By DOUGLAS DALBY, New York Times, 22 November 2012</ref>

Halappanavar's death led to protests at [[Galway]], particularly from the local Indian expatriate community.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/16/ireland-abortion-savita-halappanavar-indian-envoy|title=Savita Halappanavar 'would still be alive if she had been treated in India'|work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2012}}</ref> The University Hospital is currently a subject of several investigations.<ref name="mir12">{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/savita-halappanavar-husband-claims-pregnant-1435830|title=Savita Halappanavar: Husband claims pregnant wife would still be alive if doctors hadn't 'refused' her an abortion|work=The Mirror|date=14 November 2012|last=Rudd|first=Andy|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]}}</ref> Halappanavar had been one of the organisers of the annual Galway [[Diwali]] festival, which was cancelled in response to her death.<ref name=cbs/>

Reports about Halappanavar's death began spreading after the ''[[Tonight with Vincent Browne]]'' programme showed front-page stories by ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' newspapers on 13 November 2012.<ref name="it-savita-story-resonates-around-world">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1117/1224326702387.html|title=Savita story resonates around the world|work=The Irish Times|date=17 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|last=Mullally|first=Una|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]}}</ref> The reports were further disseminated on [[Twitter]], including by such journalists as [[Caitlin Moran]] and [[India Knight]], and were covered by publications such as [[BBC News]], the British edition of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspapers.<ref name=it-savita-story-resonates-around-world/>

On 14 November 2012, more than 2,000 people gathered to protest against Ireland's abortion laws outside [[Leinster House]] in Dublin, in Halappanavar's memory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/savita-demonstration-leinster-house-674695-Nov2012/|title=‘Over 2,000′ attend sit-down protest for Halappanavar at Leinster House|publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]]|work=The Journal| date=14 November 2012}}</ref> In addition, a candle-light vigil was held in Cork in Halappanavar's memory.<ref name=bbc1/>

There were calls upon the [[Taoiseach]] to secure an external enquiry into the circumstances surrounding Halappanavar's death.<ref name=bbc1/> There are also calls for a change in the law, as the present legislation is an Act of the British Parliament of 1861&mdash;when Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom&mdash;which declares that it is unlawful to "procure a miscarriage".<ref name=cbs/> On 16 November, the Irish [[Health Service Executive]] established an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Halappanavar's death.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1116/breaking2.html|title=HSE still finalising details of Savita Halappanavar inquiry|work=The Irish Times| date=16 November 2012| accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref>

On Saturday 17 November, the [[Garda Síochána]] (Ireland's national police) estimated that between ten and twelve thousand protesters marched from [[Parnell Square]] to [[Merrion Square]] to demand a change in the law, whilst other rallies were also held across Ireland and in many other countries abroad.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1117/breaking4.html|title=Thousands attend Savita vigils around the country|work=The Irish Times|date=17 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref>

Medical terminations had previously been performed at the University Hospital when complications had arisen in pregnancy, as it is permitted by Irish law to save the life of the mother. In an opinion piece in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Paul Bracchi speculated that an investigation would be carried out into why this did not occur in Halappanavar's case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234271/Savita-Halappanavar-A-pregnant-wifes-death-global-outcry--Was-killed-draconian-abortion-laws.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490|title=A pregnant wife's tragic death, a global outcry and the question: Was she really killed by draconian abortion laws?|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=17 November 2012}}</ref>

On Monday, 19 November, the Catholic Bishops of Ireland met in response to Halappanavar's death and released a statement that the Catholic Church believes in the "equal and inalienable right to life of a mother and her unborn child" and that the Church has never taught that the life of an unborn child takes precedence over the mother.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/1119/x-case-legislation-abortion.html|title=Treatment that risks foetus can be 'ethically permissible' - Catholic bishops|work=RTÉ News}}</ref>

Eilis O'Hanlon stated that in its initial coverage, ''The Irish Times'' had "opted to present what had happened as a simple morality tale" and that "[t]he debate for the rest of the week was coloured entirely by The Irish Times's decision to reduce a complex personal tragedy, about which few facts were still known, to a rallying call."<ref name="metaanalysis">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/eilis-ohanlon-this-government-must-be-the-one-to-face-facts-3296910.html|title=Eilis O'Hanlon: This Government must be the one to face facts|last=Eilis O'Hanlon:|date=18 Nov|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> An analysis in ''The Irish Times'' on 17 November stated: "There is much we do not know about the medical care Savita Halappanavar received" and "even before the full facts are established Ms Halappanavar’s tragedy has generated much national and international coverage" in both traditional and social media of which some has been "careful and sympathetic" but "much&nbsp;... has been intemperate, intolerant and politicised."<ref name="change in debate">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/1117/1224326702600.html|title=Decisive change in the abortion debate|last=Noel Whelan|date=17 November 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>

The staff of University Hospital, as well as members of Ireland's HSE Regional Health Forum, have stated that there is no "Catholic ethos" that is impacting treatment provided.<ref name="humphreys">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1116/1224326668071.html|title=Catholic ethos suggestion dismissed|last=JOE HUMPHREYS|date=16 November 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref>

Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a consultant in [[obstetrics]] and [[gynaecology]] and a [[Trinity College Dublin|university master]] in the [[Rotunda Hospital]], one of the biggest maternity hospitals in Ireland, said: "This case probably does not have a lot to do with abortion laws."<ref name="Rotunda head: No confusion">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/rotunda-head-no-confusion-574300.html|title= Rotunda head: No confusion|work=Irish Examiner|date=15 November 2012}}</ref> He added that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate."<ref name="We absolutely need legislation - Rotunda Master Dr Sam Coulter-Smith">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2012/1116/media-3436430.html|title=We absolutely need legislation - Rotunda Master Dr Sam Coulter-Smith|work=RTÉ|date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

Dr Rhona Mahony, the Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: "[I]t is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" and that women "need to know that they are going to get the appropriate health care that they need" while doctors "need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/maternity-hospital-chief-women-and-doctors-need-protection-574284.html|title=Maternity hospital chief: Women and doctors need protection|date=15 November 2012|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref>

The Minister for Health, [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]], said that the public must not pre-judge the situation and further said that he was awaiting the results of the investigations, adding he had no evidence to suggest a so-called "Catholic ethos" at the University Hospital that prevented Halappanavar's life from being saved by a medical termination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/reilly-no-evidence-catholic-ethos-prevented-savitas-life-from-being-saved-574238.html |title=Reilly: No evidence Catholic ethos prevented Savita's life from being saved |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=14 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> He has also stated that an inquiry into Halappanavar's death must stand up to international scrutiny.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/video-probe-must-stand-up-to-international-scrutiny-reilly-3294919.html|title=Video: Probe must stand up to international scrutiny - Reilly|work=Independent.ie|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref>

[[Brian Walsh (Irish politician)|Brian Walsh]], a [[Fine Gael]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] for [[Galway West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Galway West]], said that Galway University Hospital had carried out terminations in recent years in accordance with the judgement by the Supreme Court in the X case and with the guidelines of the Irish Medical Council. He said that the University Hospital was not run or managed by any [Catholic] religious orders and did not have a so-called "Catholic ethos".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2012/1116/1224326668914.html |title=Too soon to commit on abortion legislation, says Reilly |publisher=The Irish Times |date=16 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref>

[[Fianna Fáil]] leader [[Micheál Martin]] said that Halappanavar's death was tragic and harrowing. Martin said that Ireland had always aimed for a low death rate during pregnancy but that this was "cold comfort" to Halappanavar and her surviving family and relatives. He said that an independent inquiry was needed, with experts from outside the country to establish the full circumstances. He also responded on Saturday 17 November saying that "legislating for the X case would not have stopped [the death of Savita Halappanavar]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/law-on-x-case-would-not-have-saved-savita-says-martin-3294869.html|title=Law on X Case would not have saved Savita, says Martin|work=Herald.ie|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|last=Murphy|first=Cormac}}</ref> On 18 December 2012, after a panel of experts submitted its report to the Parliament recommending, "the government legislate the issue in order to clarify what the current laws actually do and do not permit", Ireland’s [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister of Health]], [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]], made a public statement marking an impending shift in Government policy, "..we will clarify in legislation and regulation what is available by way of treatment to a woman when a pregnancy gives rise to a threat to a woman’s life.."<ref>{{cite web |title=Ireland’s Historic Abortion Shift and the Tragedy That Shadowed It|url=http://world.time.com/2012/12/19/irelands-historic-abortion-shift-and-the-tragedy-that-shadowed-it/?iid=gs-main-lead |date=19 December 2012 |publisher=TIME |accessdate=2012-12-20}}</ref>

Michael Kelly of ''The Catholic World Report'' rejects claims that Ireland's abortion laws led to Halappanavar's death, writing that "medical experts and bioethicists have been quick to express their view that Ireland's ban on abortion had nothing to do with Mrs. Halappanavar’s death.

Father Shenan J. Boquet, president of [[Human Life International]], said that there was no evidence to indicate that "a Catholic ethos" prevented responsible treatment of the mother, and called news reports that that was the case "demonizing the church's position on abortion".

[[Rajeev Chandrasekhar]], an independent member of the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house of the [[Parliament of India]]) said, "The death of Savita Halappanavar should be pursued by family and Govt. of India as a case of human rights violation and murder. Instead of simply protesting, cases should be filed against the Govt. of Ireland and its leadership at the International Court of justice and United Nations Commission for Human Rights UNHCR. This should move beyond protesting to where people are brought to account!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rajeev.in/News/human_rights_violation/Times_of_India.html |title=State take up her cause: CM Shettar Says Humanity Should Precede Legality |publisher=The Times of India |date=17 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref>

In an editorial on 17 November 2012, ''[[The Times of India]]'' said, "There appears to be a tendency to view this issue in terms of India versus Ireland or the Catholic faith against other religions. To fall prey to such tendencies would be a serious mistake and a great disservice to the memory of Savita. ... Adding a nationalist or communal tone to the debate detracts from the merit of argument rather than enhancing it."<ref name="toioped">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-17/other-news/35171888_1_halappanavar-northern-ireland-savita-case|title=Savita's kin being consulted |date=17 November 2012|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

[[Amnesty International]] states that Halappanavar's death "illustrates [the] gap in Irish law" and asked the government of Ireland to change the law on abortion "in line with international human rights laws."<ref name="amnesty">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/Irish-govt-must-clarify-on-abortion-issue-Amnesty/articleshow/17253462.cms|title=Irish Government must clarify on abortion issue: Amnesty|work=The Times of India|date=17 November 2012| accessdate=17 November 2012|last=Press Trust of India|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> The executive director of Amnesty International in Ireland, [[Colm O'Gorman]], said that "successive Irish Governments have failed in their duty to provide necessary clarity on how this right is protected and vindicated, leaving women in Ireland in a very vulnerable position."<ref name=amnesty/>

==Official inquiry==
On 19 November 2012, the [[Health Service Executive]] (HSE) named Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran to head a seven-member panel looking into the case. Arulkumaran is the head of obstetrics and gynaecology at [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] and is president-elect of the [[International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics]].
The panel will seek to uncover all the facts and "to identify any safety issues arising in this case".<ref name="ITnov19">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1119/breaking1.html|title=HSE unveils membership of Halappanavar inquiry team|date=19 November 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|pages=direct quote is from the video, at approx 1 min|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref>

On 20 November 2012, three members of the panel were asked to step down when Praveen Halappanavar indicated that he would not cooperate with the panel due to their connections as consultants to University Hospital. Arulkumaran has requested a meeting with Mr. Halappanavar.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1121/breaking13.html|title=HSE announces Savita inquiry team replacements|date=21 November 2012|work=[[Irish Times]]|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> On 21 November, the ''Irish Independent'' reported that Arulkumaran was being accused of being "pro-abortion" and promoting a "liberal" approach to abortion because of papers that he has published.<ref name="shambles">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/probe-into-savita-shambles-goes-from-bad-to-worse-3301343.html|title=Probe into Savita shambles goes from bad to worse|coauthors=Eilish O'’Regan and Greg Harkin|date=21 November 2012|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>
