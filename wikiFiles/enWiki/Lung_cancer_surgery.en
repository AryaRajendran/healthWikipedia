'''Lung cancer surgery''' describes the use of [[surgery|surgical operations]] in the [[Management of cancer|treatment]] of [[lung cancer]]. It involves the surgical excision of cancer tissue from the lung. It is used mainly in [[non-small cell lung cancer]] with the intention of curing the patient.

==Patient selection==
Not all patients are suitable for operation. The [[cancer staging|stage]], location and cell type are important limiting factors. In addition, patients who are very ill with a poor [[performance status]] or who have inadequate pulmonary reserve would be unlikely to survive. Even with careful selection, the overall operative death rate is about 4.4%.<ref name="Strand">{{cite journal|last=Strand|first=TE|coauthors=Rostad H, Damhuis RA, Norstein J|title=Risk factors for 30-day mortality after resection of lung cancer and prediction of their magnitude|journal=Thorax|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.|date=Jun 2007|pmid=17573442|volume=62|issue=11|pages=991–7|doi=10.1136/thx.2007.079145|pmc=2117132}}</ref>

===Stage===
"[[Cancer staging|Stage]]" refers to the degree of spread of the cancer.

''See [[non-small cell lung cancer staging]]''

In non-small cell lung cancer, stages IA, IB, IIA, and IIB are suitable for surgical resection.<ref name="Mountain">{{cite journal|last=Mountain|first=CF|title=Revisions in the international system for staging lung cancer|journal=Chest|volume=111|pages=1710–1717|publisher=American College of Chest Physicians|year=1997|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/111/6/1710|doi=10.1378/chest.111.6.1710|pmid=9187198|issue=6 }}</ref>

===Pulmonary reserve===
Pulmonary reserve is measured by [[spirometry]]. If there is no evidence of undue shortness of breath or [[diffuse parenchymal lung disease]], and the FEV<sub>1</sub> exceeds 2 litres or 80% of predicted, the patient is fit for [[pneumonectomy]]. If the FEV<sub>1</sub> exceeds 1.5 litres, the patient is fit for lobectomy.<ref name="Colice">{{cite journal|last=Colice|first=GL|coauthors=Shafazand S, Griffin JP et al.|title=Physiologic evaluation of the patient with lung cancer being considered for resectional surgery: ACCP evidenced-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition)|journal=Chest|volume=132|issue=Suppl. 3|pages=161S–177S|month=September|year=2007|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/content/132/3_suppl/161S.full|pmid=17873167|doi=10.1378/chest.07-1359}}</ref>

===Types of surgery===
* [[Lobectomy (lung)|Lobectomy]] (removal of a lobe of the lung)<ref name="Fell">{{cite book|last=Fell|first=SC|coauthors=TJ Kirby|title=General Thoracic Surgery|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2005|edition=sixth|pages=433–457|isbn=0-7817-3889-X}}</ref> [http://oncolex.org/Lung/Procedures/TREATMENT/Surgery/Lobektomi?lg=procedure See a video of a Lobectomy]
* Segmentectomy (removal of an anatomic division of a particular lobe of the lung)
* [[Pneumonectomy]] (removal of an entire lung)
* [[Wedge resection (lung)|Wedge resection]]
* [[Sleeve/bronchoplastic resection]] (removal of an associated tubular section of the associated main bronchial passage during lobectomy with subsequent reconstruction of the bronchial passage)
* [[VATS lobectomy]] (minimally invasive approach to lobectomy that may allow for diminished pain, quicker return to full activity, and diminished hospital costs)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nicastri DG, Wisnivesky JP, Litle VR, ''et al.''|title=Thoracoscopic lobectomy: report on safety, discharge independence, pain, and chemotherapy tolerance|journal=[[J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg]]|volume=135|issue=3|pages=642–7|year=2008|month=March|pmid=18329487|doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.09.014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Casali G, Walker WS|title=Video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy: can we afford it?|journal=[[Eur J Cardiothorac Surg]]|volume=35|issue=3|pages=423–8|year=2009|month=March|pmid=19136272|doi=10.1016/j.ejcts.2008.11.008}}</ref>
