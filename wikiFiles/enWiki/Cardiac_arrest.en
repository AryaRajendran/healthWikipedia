'''Cardiac arrest''', also known as '''cardiopulmonary arrest''' or '''circulatory arrest''', is the cessation of normal [[Circulatory system|circulation]] of the [[blood]] due to failure of the [[heart]] to contract effectively.<ref name="Harrison">{{cite book |author=Jameson, J.

A cardiac arrest is different from (but may be caused by) a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], where blood flow to the muscle of the heart is impaired.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=T | title=Myocardial Infarction | journal=Focus on First Aid | volume= | issue=15 | pages=15 | year=2010 | pmid= | url=http://www.focusonfirstaid.co.uk/Magazine/issue15/index.aspx | accessdate=2010-06-08 | doi= }}</ref>

Arrested blood [[Circulatory system|circulation]] prevents delivery of [[oxygen]] to the body.  Lack of oxygen to the brain causes [[unconsciousness|loss of consciousness]], which then results in [[respiratory arrest|abnormal or absent breathing]]. Brain injury is likely if cardiac arrest goes untreated for more than five minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Safar P |title=Cerebral resuscitation after cardiac arrest: a review |journal=Circulation |volume=74 |issue=6 Pt 2 |pages=IV138–53 |year=1986 |month=December |pmid=3536160 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Holzer M, Behringer W |title=Therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest |journal=Curr Opin Anaesthesiol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=163–8 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=16534333 |doi=10.1097/01.aco.0000162835.33474.a9 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Safar P, Xiao F, Radovsky A, ''et al.'' |title=Improved cerebral resuscitation from cardiac arrest in dogs with mild hypothermia plus blood flow promotion |journal=Stroke |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=105–13 |year=1996 |month=January |pmid=8553385 |doi= 10.1161/01.STR.27.1.105|url=}}</ref> For the best chance of survival and neurological recovery, immediate and decisive treatment is imperative.<ref name="IrwinRippe">{{cite book |author=Rippe, James M.; Irwin, Richard S. |title=Irwin and Rippe's intensive care medicine |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-3548-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Cardiac arrest is a [[medical emergency]] that, in certain situations, is potentially reversible if treated early. Unexpected cardiac arrest can lead to death within minutes; this is called [[sudden cardiac death]] (SCD).<ref name="Harrison"/> The treatment for cardiac arrest is immediate [[defibrillation]] if a "shockable" rhythm is present, while [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) is used to provide circulatory support and/or to induce a "shockable" rhythm.

==Classification==
Clinicians classify cardiac arrest into "shockable" versus "non–shockable", based upon the [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] rhythm.  This refers to whether a particular class of [[cardiac dysrhythmia]] is treatable using [[defibrillation]].<ref name="RCUK2005"/> The two "shockable" rhythms are [[ventricular fibrillation]] and [[pulseless ventricular tachycardia]] while the two "non–shockable" rhythms are [[asystole]] and [[pulseless electrical activity]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Cardiac arrest is an abrupt cessation of pump function in the heart (as evidenced by the absence of a palpable pulse). Prompt intervention can usually reverse a cardiac arrest, but without such intervention it will almost always lead to death.<ref name="Harrison"/> In certain cases, it is an expected outcome to a serious illness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/coronary-artery-disease |title=Mount Sinai - Cardiac arrest |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

However, due to inadequate [[Cerebral circulation|cerebral perfusion]], the patient will be [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] and will have stopped [[breath]]ing. The main diagnostic criterion to diagnose a cardiac arrest (as opposed to [[respiratory arrest]] which shares many of the same features) is lack of [[Circulatory system|circulation]]; however, there are a number of ways of determining this. [[Near death experiences]] are reported by 10-20% of people who survived cardiac arrest.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parnia|first=S|coauthors=Spearpoint, K, Fenwick, PB|title=Near death experiences, cognitive function and psychological outcomes of surviving cardiac arrest.|journal=Resuscitation|date=2007 Aug|volume=74|issue=2|pages=215–21|pmid=17416449|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.01.020}}</ref>

==Causes==
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of sudden cardiac arrest.  Many other cardiac and non-cardiac conditions also increase one's risk.

===Coronary heart disease===
Approximately 60–70% of SCD is related to [[coronary heart disease]].<ref name=Circ01/><ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=State-specific mortality from sudden cardiac death--United States, 1999 |journal=MMWR Morb.

===Non-ischemic heart disease===
A number of other cardiac abnormalities can increase the risk of SCD including: [[cardiomyopathy]], [[cardiac dysrhythmia|cardiac rhythm disturbances]], [[hypertensive heart disease]],<ref name=Circ01/> [[congestive heart failure]].<ref name=AHJ98>{{cite journal |author=Kannel WB, Wilson PW, D'Agostino RB, Cobb J |title=Sudden coronary death in women |journal=Am.

In a group of military recruits aged 18–35, cardiac anomalies accounted for 51% of cases of SCD, while in 35% of cases the cause remained unknown.  Underlying pathology included: [[Coronary artery anomaly|coronary artery abnormalities]] (61%), [[myocarditis]] (20%), and [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (13%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eckart RE, Scoville SL, Campbell CL, ''et al.'' |title=Sudden death in young adults: a 25-year review of autopsies in military recruits |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=141 |issue=11 |pages=829–34 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15583223 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Congestive heart failure increases the risk of SCD by 5 fold.<ref name=AHJ98/>

Many additional conduction abnormalities exist that place one at higher risk for cardiac arrest.  For instance, long QT syndrome, a condition often mentioned in young people's deaths, occurs in 1/5000-1/7000 newborns and is estimated to be responsible 3000 deaths each year compared to the approximately 300000<ref name="AHA">[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4741 Sudden Cardiac Death]
</ref> cardiac arrests seen by emergency services . These conditions are a fraction of the overall deaths related to cardiac arrest, but represent conditions which may be detected prior to arrest, which may be treatable.

===Non-cardiac===
SCDs is unrelated to heart problems in 35% of cases.  The most common non-cardiac causes: [[Physical trauma|trauma]], non-trauma related bleeding (such as [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], [[aortic rupture]], and [[intracranial hemorrhage]]), [[overdose]], [[drowning]] and [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuisma M, Alaspää A |title=Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of non-cardiac origin. Epidemiology and outcome |journal=Eur. Heart J. |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=1122–8 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9243146 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Risk factors===
The risk factors for SCD are similar to those seen with coronary heart disease including: [[smoking]], lack of [[physical exercise]], [[obesity]],  [[diabetes]], and [[family history]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friedlander Y, Siscovick DS, Weinmann S, ''et al.'' |title=Family history as a risk factor for primary cardiac arrest |journal=Circulation |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=155–60 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=9445167 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Cardiac arrest is synonymous with [[clinical death]].

A cardiac arrest is usually diagnosed clinically by the absence of a pulse.  In many cases lack of [[pulse|carotid pulse]] is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for diagnosing cardiac arrest, but lack of a pulse (particularly in the peripheral pulses) may result from other conditions (e.g. [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]), or simply an error on the part of the rescuer. Studies have shown that rescuers often make a mistake when checking the carotid pulse in an emergency, whether they are healthcare professionals<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ochoa FJ, Ramalle-Gómara E, Carpintero JM, García A, Saralegui I |title=Competence of health professionals to check the carotid pulse |journal=Resuscitation |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=173–5 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9715777 |doi= 10.1016/S0300-9572(98)00055-0|url=}}</ref> or lay persons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bahr J, Klingler H, Panzer W, Rode H, Kettler D |title=Skills of lay people in checking the carotid pulse |journal=Resuscitation |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=23–6 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9259056 |doi= 10.1016/S0300-9572(96)01092-1|url=}}</ref>

Owing to the inaccuracy in this method of diagnosis, some bodies such as the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) have de-emphasised its importance. The Resuscitation Council (UK), in line with the ERC's recommendations and those of the American Heart Association,<ref name=AHA05>
{{cite journal |author= |title=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=112 |issue=24 Suppl |pages=IV1–203 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16314375 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166550 |url= |author1= ECC Committee, Subcommittees and Task Forces of the American Heart Association}}</ref>
have suggested that the technique should be used only by healthcare professionals with specific training and expertise, and even then that it should be viewed in conjunction with other indicators such as [[agonal respiration]].<ref name="RCUK2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/guide.htm |title=Resuscitation Council (UK) Guidelines 2005 |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Various other methods for detecting circulation have been proposed. Guidelines following the 2000 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recommendations were for rescuers to look for "signs of circulation", but not specifically the pulse.<ref name=AHA05/> These signs included coughing, gasping, colour, twitching and movement.<ref>{{cite book |author=British Red Cross; St Andrew's Ambulance Association; St John Ambulance |title=First Aid Manual: The Authorised Manual of St. John Ambulance, St. Andrew's Ambulance Association, and the British Red Cross |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishers Ltd |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-4053-1573-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> However, in face of evidence that these guidelines were ineffective, the current recommendation of ILCOR is that cardiac arrest should be diagnosed in all casualties who are unconscious and not breathing normally.<ref name=AHA05/>

==Prevention==
With positive outcomes following cardiac arrest unlikely, an effort has been spent in finding effective strategies to prevent cardiac arrest.  With the prime causes of cardiac arrest being [[ischemic heart disease]], efforts to promote a [[healthy diet]], [[exercise]], and [[smoking cessation]] are important. For people at risk of heart disease, measures such as [[blood pressure]] control, [[cholesterol]] lowering, and other medico-therapeutic interventions are used.{{ref}}

===Code teams===
In medical parlance, cardiac arrest is referred to as a "code" or a "crash". This typically refers to "code blue" on the [[hospital emergency codes]]. A dramatic drop in vital sign measurements is referred to as "coding" or "crashing", though coding is usually used when it results in cardiac arrest, while crashing might not. Treatment for cardiac arrest is sometimes referred to as "calling a code".

Extensive research has shown that patients in general wards often deteriorate for several hours or even days before a cardiac arrest occurs.<ref name="RCUK2005" /><ref name="Kause et al. 2004">{{cite journal |author=Kause J, Smith G, Prytherch D, Parr M, Flabouris A, Hillman K |title=A comparison of antecedents to cardiac arrests, deaths and emergency intensive care admissions in Australia and New Zealand, and the United Kingdom--the ACADEMIA study |journal=Resuscitation |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=275–82 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15325446 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2004.05.016 |url=}}</ref> This has been attributed to a lack of knowledge and skill amongst ward based staff, in particular a failure to carry out measurement of the [[respiratory rate]], which is often the major predictor of a deterioration<ref name="RCUK2005" /> and can often change up to 48 hours prior to a cardiac arrest. In response to this, many hospitals now have increased training for ward based staff. A number of "early warning" systems also exist which aim to quantify the risk which patients are at of deterioration based on their [[vital signs]] and thus provide a guide to staff. In addition, specialist staff are being utilised more effectively in order to augment the work already being done at ward level. These include:
* Crash teams (or code teams) - These are designated staff members who have particular expertise in resuscitation, who are called to the scene of all arrests within the hospital. This usually involves a specialized cart of equipment (including [[defibrillation|defibrillator]]) and drugs called a "[[crash cart]]".
* Medical emergency teams - These teams respond to all emergencies, with the aim of treating the patient in the acute phase of their illness in order to prevent a cardiac arrest.
* Critical care outreach - As well as providing the services of the other two types of team, these teams are also responsible for educating non-specialist staff. In addition, they help to facilitate transfers between [[Intensive care unit|intensive care/high dependency units]] and the general hospital wards. This is particularly important, as many studies have shown that a significant percentage of patients discharged from critical care environments quickly deteriorate and are re-admitted - the outreach team offers support to ward staff to prevent this from happening.

In some medical facilities, the resuscitation team may purposely respond slowly to a patient in cardiac arrest, a practice known as ''[[slow code]]'', or may fake the response altogether for the sake of the patient's family, a practice known as ''show code''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/22/opinion/slow-codes-show-codes-and-death.html|title=Slow Codes, Show Codes and Death|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|date=22 August 1987|accessdate=2013-04-06}}</ref> This is generally done for patients for whom performing CPR will have no medical benefit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpso.on.ca/policies/policies/default.aspx?ID=1582|title=Decision-making for the End of Life|others=Physician Advisory Service|publisher=[[College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario]]|year=2006|month=May|accessdate=2013-04-06}}</ref> Such practices are ethically controversial,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/lnc/journalarticle?Article_ID=437848|title="Slow" Code: Perspectives of a Physician and Critical Care Nurse|last1=DePalma|first1=Judith A.|last2=Miller|first2=Scott|last3=Ozanich|first3=Evelyn|last4=Yancich|first4=Lynne M.|work=Critical Care Nursing Quarterly|volume=22|issue=3|pages=89–99|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams and Wilkins]]|year=1999|month=November|isbn=1550-5111}}</ref> and are banned in some jurisdictions.

===Implantable cardioverter defibrillators===
A technologically based intervention to prevent further cardiac arrest episodes is the use of an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] (ICD). This device is implanted in the patient and acts as an instant defibrillator in the event of arrhythmia. Note that standalone ICDs do not have any pacemaker functions, but they can be combined with a [[pacemaker]], and modern versions also have advanced features such as anti-tachycardic pacing as well as synchronized [[cardioversion]]. A recent study by Birnie et al. at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute has demonstrated that ICDs are underused in both the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/177/1/41|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|title=Use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in Canadian and IS survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|last=Birnie|first=David H|coauthors=Sambell, Christie; Johansen, Helen; Williams, Katherine; Lemery, Robert; Green, Martin S; Gollob, Michael H; Lee, Douglas S; Tang, Anthony SL|accessdate=2007-07-29|month=July | year=2007|volume=177|issue=1|doi=10.1503/cmaj.060730|pages=41–6|pmid=17606938|pmc=1896034}}</ref> An accompanying editorial by Simpson explores some of the economic, geographic, social and political reasons for this.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simpson CS |title=Implantable cardioverter defibrillators work--so why aren't we using them? |journal=CMAJ |volume=177 |issue=1 |pages=49–51 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17606939 |pmc=1896028 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.070470 |url=}}</ref> Patients who are most likely to benefit from the placement of an ICD are those with severe [[ischemic cardiomyopathy]] (with systolic ejection fractions less than 30%) as demonstrated by the MADIT-II trial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moss AJ, Brown MW, Cannom DS, ''et al.'' |title=Multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial-cardiac resynchronization therapy (MADIT-CRT): design and clinical protocol |journal=Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol |volume=10 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=34–43 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16274414 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-474X.2005.00073.x |url=}}</ref>

==Management==
Sudden cardiac arrest may be treated via attempts at [[resuscitation]].  This is usually carried out based upon [[basic life support]] (BLS) / [[advanced cardiac life support]] (ACLS),<ref name="AHA05"/> [[pediatric advanced life support]] (PALS)<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=2005 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular care (ECC) of pediatric and neonatal patients: pediatric advanced life support |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=e1005–28 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16651281 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0346 |url= |last1= American Heart |first1= Association}}</ref> or [[neonatal resuscitation program]] (NRP) guidelines.
Several organisations promote the idea of a "[[chain of survival]]".  The chain consists of the following "links":

* Early recognition - If possible, recognition of illness before the patient develops a cardiac arrest will allow the rescuer to prevent its occurrence. Early recognition that a cardiac arrest has occurred is key to survival - for every minute a patient stays in cardiac arrest, their chances of survival drop by roughly 10%.<ref name="RCUK2005"/>
* Early CPR - improves the flow of blood and of oxygen to vital organs - an essential component of treating a cardiac arrest. In particular, by keeping the brain supplied with oxygenated blood, chances of neurological damage are decreased.
* Early defibrillation - is effective for the management of [[ventricular fibrillation]] and pulseless [[ventricular tachycardia]]<ref name = "RCUK2005"/>  If defibrillation is delayed the rhythm is likely to degenerate into [[asystole]] for which outcomes are worse.
* Early advanced care - Early [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] is the final link in the chain of survival.

If one or more links in the chain are missing or delayed, then the chances of survival drop significantly.

These protocols are often initiated by a [[Code Blue (emergency code)|Code Blue]], which usually denotes impending or acute onset of cardiac arrest or [[respiratory failure]], although in practice, Code Blue is often called in less life-threatening situations that require immediate attention from a physician.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Cardiopulmonary resuscitation===
[[CPR]] is a critical part of the management of cardiac arrest.  It should be started as soon as possible and interrupted as little as possible.  The component of CPR which seems to make the greatest difference is the [[chest compressions]]. [[Tracheal intubation]] has not been found to improve survival rates in cardiac arrest cases.<ref name="Mutchner L 2007 60–9; quiz 69–70">{{cite journal |author=Mutchner L |title=The ABCs of CPR--again |journal=Am J Nurs |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=60–9; quiz 69–70 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17200636 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  A 2009 study has found that [[assisted ventilation]] may worsen outcomes over placement of an [[oral airway]] with passive oxygen delivery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bobrow BJ, Ewy GA, Clark L, ''et al.'' |title=Passive oxygen insufflation is superior to bag-valve-mask ventilation for witnessed ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=656–662.e1 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19660833 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.06.011 |url=}}</ref> Intubation in the prehospital environment has been associated with decreased survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Studnek JR, Thestrup L, Vandeventer S, ''et al.'' |title=The association between prehospital endotracheal intubation attempts and survival to hospital discharge among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=918–25 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=20836771 |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2010.00827.x |url=}}</ref> Correctly performed bystander CPR has been shown to increase survival; it is performed in less than 30% of out of hospital arrests.<ref name="Mutchner L 2007 60–9; quiz 69–70"/>

===Defibrillation===
Shockable and non–shockable causes of cardiac arrest is based on the presence or absence of [[ventricular fibrillation]] or [[pulseless ventricular tachycardia]]. The shockable rhythms are treated with CPR and defibrillation.

In addition, there is increasing use of public access defibrillation. This involves placing [[automated external defibrillator]]s in public places, and training staff in these areas how to use them. This allows defibrillation to take place prior to the arrival of emergency services, and has been shown to lead to increased chances of survival. Some defibrillators even provide feedback on the quality of CPR compressions, encouraging the lay rescuer to press the patient's chest hard enough to circulate blood.<ref>[http://www.lifeassisttraining.com/zollaedplus.html Zoll AED Plus]</ref> In addition, it has been shown that those who suffer arrests in remote locations have worse outcomes following cardiac arrest:<ref name="Lyon ''et al.'' 2004">{{cite journal | author = Lyon R.M, Cobbe S.M., Bradley J.M., Grubb N.R. ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = Surviving out of hospital cardiac arrest at home: a postcode lottery? | url = | journal = Emergency Medical Journal | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 619–624 }}</ref> these areas often have [[first responder]]s, whereby members of the community receive training in resuscitation and are given a defibrillator, and called by the [[emergency medical services]] in the case of a collapse in their local area.

===Medications===
Medications, while included in guidelines, have been shown not to improve survival to hospital discharge post out of hospital cardiac arrest.

===Do not resuscitate===
Some people choose to avoid aggressive measure at the end of life.  A [[do not resuscitate]] (DNR) in the form of an [[advance health care directive]] makes it clear that in the event of cardiac arrest the person does not wish [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loertscher|first=L|coauthors=Reed, DA, Bannon, MP, Mueller, PS|title=Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and do-not-resuscitate orders: a guide for clinicians|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=2010 Jan|volume=123|issue=1|pages=4–9|pmid=20102982|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.05.029}}</ref> Other directive may be made to stipulate the desire for [[intubation]] in the event of [[respiratory failure]] or if comfort measures are all that are desired by stipulating "allow natural death".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knox|first=C|coauthors=Vereb, JA|title=Allow natural death: a more humane approach to discussing end-of-life directives|journal=Journal of emergency nursing: JEN : official publication of the Emergency Department Nurses Association|date=2005 Dec|volume=31|issue=6|pages=560–1|pmid=16308044|doi=10.1016/j.jen.2005.06.020}}</ref>

The [[precordial thump]] may be considered in those with witnessed, monitored, unstable ventricular tachycardia (including pulseless VT) if a defibrillator is not immediately ready for use, but it should not delay CPR and shock delivery or be used in those with unwitnessed out of hospital arrest.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cave|first=DM|coauthors=Gazmuri, RJ, Otto, CW, Nadkarni, VM, Cheng, A, Brooks, SC, Daya, M, Sutton, RM, Branson, R, Hazinski, MF|title=Part 7: CPR techniques and devices: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|date=2010-11-02|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S720-8|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970970|pmid=20956223}}</ref> Resuscitation with [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] devices has been attempted with better results for in-hospiatl cardiac arrest (29% survival) than out of hospital cardiac arrest (4% survival) in populations selected to benefit most.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lehot|first=JJ|coauthors=Long-Him-Nam, N; Bastien, O|title=[Extracorporeal life support for treating cardiac arrest].|journal=Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine|date=2011 Dec|volume=195|issue=9|pages=2025-33; discussion 2033-6|pmid=22930866}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The survival rate of people who receive initial emergency care by ambulance is only 2%, with 15% experiencing [[return of spontaneous circulation]].<ref name=RSCUK>{{cite web|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/compCPRs.htm|title=Resuscitation Council Comment on CPR study|publisher=Resuscitation Council UK|month=April |year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070612203024/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/compCPRs.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> However, with defibrillation within 3–5 minutes, the survival rate increases to 30%.<ref name=AHA6>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4483|title=CPR statistics|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref><ref name=AHA7>[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4483 Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Statistics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Since mortality in case of OHCA is high, programs were developed to improve survival rate. Although mortality in case of ventricular fibrillation is high, rapid intervention with a [[defibrillator]] increases survival rate.<ref name="Eisenberg"/><ref name="Bunch">{{cite journal |author=Bunch TJ, White RD, Gersh BJ, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest after successful early defibrillation |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=348 |issue=26 |pages=2626–33 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12826637 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa023053 |url=}}</ref>

Survival is mostly related to the cause of the arrest (see above). In particular, patients who have suffered [[hypothermia]] have an increased survival rate, possibly because the cold protects the vital organs from the effects of tissue hypoxia. Survival rates following an arrest induced by toxins is very much dependent on identifying the toxin and administering an appropriate antidote. A patient who has suffered a [[myocardial infarction]] due to a [[blood clot]] in the [[left coronary artery]] has a lower chance of survival.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

A study of survival rates from out of hospital cardiac arrest found that 14.6% of those who had received resuscitation by ambulance staff survived as far as admission to hospital. Of these, 59% died during admission, half of these within the first 24 hours, while 46% survived until discharge from hospital. This gives us an overall survival following cardiac arrest of 6.8%. Of these 89% had normal brain function or mild neurological disability, 8.5% had moderate impairment, and 2% suffered major neurological disability. Of those who were discharged from hospital, 70% were still alive 4 years later.<ref name="Cobbe">{{cite journal |author=Cobbe SM, Dalziel K, Ford I, Marsden AK |title=Survival of 1476 patients initially resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest |journal=BMJ |volume=312 |issue=7047 |pages=1633–7 |year=1996 |month=June |pmid=8664715 |pmc=2351362 |doi= |url=}}</ref> 

A specific pattern of the brain damage in cardiac arrest survivors revealed by MRI study has been known as a delayed T1-hyperintensity localized in the striatum, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and/or substantia nigra (Fujioka, M. et al. Stroke. 1994;25:2091-2095.; Fujioka, M. et al. Neuroradiology. 1994;36:605-607.). The MRI volumetric study demonstrated that the human hippocampus showed its selective atrophy in a delayed fashion after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (Fujioka, M. et al. Cerebrovasc Dis. 2000;10:2-7.). 

A review into prognosis following in-hospital cardiac arrest found a survival to discharge of 14% although the range between different studies was 0-28%.<ref name="Ballew">
