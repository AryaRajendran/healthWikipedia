'''Fludarabine''' or '''fludarabine phosphate''' (Fludara) is a [[chemotherapy]] drug used in the treatment of [[hematological malignancy|hematological malignancies]] (cancers of blood cells such as leukemias and lymphomas). It is a purine analog, which interferes with DNA synthesis.

==Indications==
Fludarabine is highly effective in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, producing higher response rates than [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s such as [[chlorambucil]] alone.<ref name=Rai>Rai KR et al. Fludarabine compared with chlorambucil as primary therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. N Engl J Med 2000;343:1750-7. {{DOI|10.1056/NEJM200012143432402}} PMID 11114313</ref>
Fludarabine is used in various combinations with [[cyclophosphamide]], [[mitoxantrone]], [[dexamethasone]] and [[rituximab]] in the treatment of indolent [[lymphoma|non-Hodgkins lymphomas]].  As part of the ''FLAG'' regimen, fludarabine is used together with [[cytarabine]] and [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] in the treatment of [[acute myeloid leukaemia]].  Because of its immunosuppressive effects, fludarabine is also used in some conditioning regimens prior to [[bone marrow transplant|non myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant]].

==Pharmacology==
Fludarabine is a [[purine]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]], and can be given both orally and intravenously.  Fludarabine inhibits [[DNA synthesis]] by interfering with [[ribonucleotide reductase]] and [[DNA polymerase]].  It is active against both dividing and resting cells. Being phosphorylated, fludarabine is ionized at physiologic pH and is effectually trapped in blood. This provides some level of specificity for blood cells, both cancerous and healthy.

==Side effects==
Fludarabine is associated with profound lymphopenia, and as a consequence, increases the risk of [[opportunistic infection]]s significantly. Patients who have been treated with fludarabine will usually be asked to take [[co-trimoxazole]] or to use monthly nebulised [[pentamidine]] to prevent [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia|''Pneumocystis jiroveci'' pneumonia]].  The profound lymphopenia caused by fludarabine renders patients susceptible to [[transfusion-associated graft versus host disease]], a fatal complication of [[blood transfusion]].  For this reason, all patients who have ever received fludarabine should only be given [[irradiation|irradiated]] blood components.

Fludarabine causes anemia, thrombocytopenia and [[neutropenia]], requiring regular blood count monitoring.  Some patients require blood and [[platelet]] transfusion, or [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|G-CSF]] injections to boost [[neutrophil]] counts.

Fludarabine is associated with the development of severe [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] in a proportion of patients.<ref name=Gonzalez>Gonzalez H et al. Severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia in eight patients treated with fludarabine. Hematol Cell Ther. 1998;40:113-8. PMID 9698219</ref>

Difficulties are often encountered when harvesting peripheral blood stem cells from patients previously treated with fludarabine.<ref name=Tournilhac>Tournilhac O et al. Impact of frontline fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combined treatment on peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Blood 2004;103:363-5. PMID 12969985</ref>

==History==
Fludarabine was produced by John Montgomery and Kathleen Hewson of the [[Southern Research Institute]] in 1968.<ref name=Sneader>{{cite book
