The '''Brain & Behavior Research Foundation''' is a nonprofit (501c3) organization that focuses on [[mental health]] research. The Foundation website states, “100% of all donor contributions for research are invested in [[NARSAD Grants]] leading to discoveries in understanding causes and improving treatments of disorders in children and adults, such as [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], and [[anxiety disorders]] like [[obsessive-compulsive]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorders]].” <ref name="bbrfoundation.org">{{cite web|title=About the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation|url=http://www.bbrfoundation.org/about|  accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>

The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation serves a growing population living with or touched by mental illness. An estimated 1 in 4 Americans live with a diagnosable mental illness, including approximately 6 percent whose mental illness is so severe as to interfere with daily activities such as work, school, or family life. “In addition, mental illness is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. and Canada." <ref>{{cite web|title=NIMH: The Numbers Count|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america/|  accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>

==History and Founding==
The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation began with a group of family and friends in 1981 and was originally named the American Schizophrenia Foundation. Three leading national mental health organizations collaborated to create the foundation: the [[National Alliance for the Mentally Ill]] (NAMI), the National Mental Health Association (NMHA), and the [[National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association]] (NDMDA). In 1985, the organization became the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD); in 2011 it rebranded itself as the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, “awarding NARSAD Grants to fund research in every major area of brain and behavior research for all mental illness.”<ref>{{cite web|title=BBRF: About|url=http://bbrfoundation.org/about/our-history|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>  

The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation believes strongly in research and allocates 100% of donations to scientific research. The organization’s fundraising and administrative costs are underwritten by separate grants. All research proposals are reviewed by a Scientific Council, which consists of 138 volunteer mental health leaders including [[Nobel Prize]] winners, members of the National Academy of Sciences and chairs of psychiatric departments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scientific Council|url=http://bbrfoundation.org/scientific-council|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>

== Research ==
The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation focuses its research primarily on eight of the most common mental illnesses in the United States and other developed countries<ref name="Brain & Behavior Research Foundation: Mental Illness ">{{cite web|title=Brain & Behavior Research Foundation: Mental Illness|url= http://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|work=http://bbrfoundation.org|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>—schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, autism, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NARSAD Grants are awarded to researchers in these fields according to four different categories: Basic Research, New Technologies, Diagnostic Tools/Early Intervention, and Next Generation Treatments.<ref name="NARSAD Grants & Prizes">{{cite web|title=NARSAD Grants & Prizes|url= http://bbrfoundation.org/narsad-grants-and-prizes|work=www.bbrfoundation.org|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>

The following are the latest NARSAD Grant statistics as of February 2013 according to the Foundation website:

Total given since 1987 (26th year of grant giving): $289,322,696.27<br />
Total number of grantees: 3,319<br />
Total number of grants given: 4,278<br />
Total number of institutions: 434<br />
Total number of countries (other than the U.S.): 32

The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation Scientific Council, led by [[Herb Pardes]], M.D., Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees of [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]], consists of 138 volunteer mental health leaders who review over one thousand grant applications each year across all major areas of brain and behavior research and make recommendations. This group also advises the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation Board of Directors on policy and program decisions.<ref name="Scientific Council">{{cite web|title=NARSAD Grants & Prizes|url= http://bbrfoundation.org/scientific-council|work=www.bbrfoundation.org|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>
The Foundation also sponsors the [http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/ Schizophrenia Research Forum] website, an online community of scientists collaborating in their search for causes, improved treatments, and better understanding of schizophrenia.
