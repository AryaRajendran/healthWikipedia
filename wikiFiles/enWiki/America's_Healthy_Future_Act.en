==History behind the proposal==
Chairman [[Max Baucus|Baucus]] was known as the head of a [[bipartisan]] group called the '[[Gang of Six]]' in the [[Senate Finance Committee]]. [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Jeff Bingaman]] of [[New Mexico]] and [[Kent Conrad]] of [[North Dakota]] made up the other [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] members of the 'gang', while [[Olympia Snowe]] of [[Maine]], [[Chuck Grassley]] of [[Iowa]], and [[Mike Enzi]] of [[Wyoming]] made up the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] side. They underwent months of negotiations and compromises over the summer of 2009 to achieve a healthcare plan. In the first week of September, Baucus began saying that he would push through a plan even if he could not obtain bipartisan backing. He remarked that "time has come for action, and we will act" on September 9.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|title=What The 'Gang Of Six' Wants From Health Care Bill|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112222617|date=September 9, 2009|author1=Liz Halloran|author2=Audie Cornish|author3=Peter Overby|author4=Julie Rovner|accessdate=October 5, 2009}}</ref>

Before the proposal was made, [[POTUS|President]] [[Barack Obama]] publicly promised that he would not support a plan that would cost more than $900 billion over the next ten years. He also said that a plan could not add to the [[United States public debt|federal deficit]], with every bit of new spending completely offset.<ref name=janet>{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Cook|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-health3-2009oct03,0,7279261.story?track=rss|title=

===Alleged conflicts of interests in its creation===
Senator Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, received over $3 million from the health and insurance industries from 2003 to 2008, more than any other member of Congress.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Fram|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/09/16/the_influence_game_health_interests_fund_senators/|title=THE INFLUENCE GAME: Health interests fund senators|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091003132330/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/09/16/the_influence_game_health_interests_fund_senators/| archivedate= 3 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name=MTS>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Dennison|url=http://www.mtstandard.com/articles/2009/06/14/state/hjjajdifjijigd.txt|accessdate=October 5, 2009|title=Insurance interests total 1/4 of Baucus' fundraising|publisher=''[[The Montana Standard]]''|date=June 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=October 5, 2009|url=http://thinkprogress.org/2009/07/23/max-baucus-health-contributions/|title=Max Baucus receives considerable contributions from health care industry|publisher=[[ThinkProgress.org]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091027190854/http://thinkprogress.org/2009/07/23/max-baucus-health-contributions/| archivedate= 27 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Republican [[Ranking Member]] on the Committee, Sen.

===Economic background===
According to Sen. [[Olympia Snowe]], the cost of the average employer-provided insurance plan will rise to nearly $31,000 in several years if no [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform measures]] are done.<ref name=Snowe-aids/>

==Proposal details==

===Components of the proposal===
The proposal specifies the creation of [[health insurance cooperative]]s, which would be member-controlled, [[non-profit]] forms of health insurance that would [[market competition|compete]] with private insurers. It does not include a [[health insurance public option|public insurance plan]]. The co-operatives would receive $6 billion in federal funding in 2012 to start off, but they would operate independently after that point.<ref name=primer>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1924252,00.html|accessdate=September 26, 2009|publisher=''[[Time Magazine|Time]]''|first=Kate|last=Pickert|title=The Baucus Health Bill: A Primer on What's in It|date=September 16, 2009}}</ref> The introduction of the co-ops is intended to drive health care costs downward.<ref name=victoria/>

The proposal also creates an [[individual mandate]] that requires people to either buy insurance or pay a penalty. Those with incomes below three times the [[Poverty in the United States#Measures_of_poverty|federal poverty level]] would receive [[subsidies]] to purchase their plans. For a family of four, $66,150 would be the dividing line. The penalty would be up to $950 per person or $3,800 per family each year. These measures would come into effect for all American residents in 2013.<ref name=primer/> According to ''[[The Politico]]'':
<blockquote>"Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) received a handwritten note Thursday from Joint Committee on Taxation Chief of Staff Tom Barthold confirming the penalty for failing to pay the up to $1,900 fee for not buying health insurance. Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in jail or a $25,000 penalty, Barthold wrote on JCT letterhead. He signed it 'Sincerely, Thomas A. Barthold'."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[The Politico]]''|url=http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0909/Ensign_receives_handwritten_confirmation_.html?showall|accessdate=September 26, 2009|date=September 25, 2009|title=Ensign receives handwritten confirmation |author=Carrie Budoff Brown| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090927151741/http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0909/Ensign_receives_handwritten_confirmation_.html?showall| archivedate= 27 September 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref></blockquote>

Individuals would be able to buy their insurance from an exchange created in their state, which would be created in 2010. Premiums would be capped at 13% of the buyer's income, with the rest of the costs paid by subsidies. Insurance companies would be required to cover certain services such as [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]], [[maternity care]], [[Neonatology|newborn care]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[Pediatrics|pediatric care]]. Their plans would be presented as either bronze, silver, gold, and platinum options, sorted by the least to the most expensive. Only individuals and firms with fifty or fewer employees would be eligible to use the exchanges until 2017, when states would bring in larger employers. In 2022, they would become open to all. Persons who are not lawfully in the United States would not be permitted to participate in the exchange, either with or without subsidies.<ref name=primer/> According to Baucus: <blockquote>"In order to prevent illegal immigrants from accessing the state exchanges obtaining federal health care tax credits, the Chairman‘s Mark requires verification of the following personal data. Name, social security number, and date of birth will be verified with Social Security Administration (SSA) data. For individuals claiming to be U.S. citizens, if the claim of citizenship is consistent with SSA data then the claim will be considered substantiated."<ref>[http://www.opencongress.org/baucus_bill_health_care.html Max Baucus, "Chairman's Mark: America's Healthy Future Act"]</ref></blockquote>

Although the proposal does not establish an [[employer mandate]], which would have required firms to provide insurance for their workers or pay a penalty, the proposal requires businesses with more than fifty employees to pay fees going towards the aforementioned [[subsidies]]. The maximum possible fee would either be $400 per full-time employee or the average cost of the subsidies a firm's employee's take in multiplied by the number of those receiving them. The proposal forbids insurance companies from restricting coverage based on '[[pre-existing conditions]]'. The insurance premiums can take into account tobacco use, age, family size, and geographic location.<ref name=primer/> Insurance companies would also be forbidden from setting up lifetime or annual caps that specify a maximum amount of care that customers can receive.<ref name=essential/>

The proposal also includes a new [[excise tax]] on so-called '[[Cadillac insurance plan|Cadillac]]' health care plans that are more expensive and comprehensive than the majority of plans. Any plan costing over $8,000 for an individual and $21,000 for a family would be subject to a 35% tax on the amount past those levels.<ref name=cadillac/> The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]], a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal-leaning]] [[think tank]], estimated that about 10% of families have plans that would be subject to the tax.<ref name=cadillac>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/health/policy/21insure.html?hp|title=A Tax on Cadillac Health Plans May Also Hit the Chevys|accessdate=September 26, 2009|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=September 20, 2009|first=Reed|last=Abelson}}</ref> The [[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]] has argued that this tax is beneficial both because it grows fast enough to keep up with new costs and because it can helps to slow health care cost growth. The group has also stated that the tax will cause employers to offer workers higher (taxable) cash wages instead of health benefits, thus generating more government revenue.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]]''|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/understanding-health-insurance-excise-tax|title=Understanding the Health Insurance Excise Tax}}</ref> According to Congress' joint committee on taxation, the proposal would create $215 billion in the next ten years from the tax. Another $93 billion in funds will come from new annual fees imposed on groups such as pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers.<ref name=FAQ/> Additionally, the Senate Finance Committee approved provisions that would lump [[Flexible Spending Accounts]] (FSAs) together with high-cost insurance plans and subject them to the [[excise tax]], which would likely cause many employers to reconsider offering FSAs altogether.<ref>Associated Press [http://savemyflexplan.org/media_news/09-11-01_ap.html Flex Spending Accounts Face Hit in Health Overhaul]</ref>

Other funds come a reduction in future [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] spending, which would be over $400 billion in the next decade. Specifically, payments under the [[Medicare Advantage]] system would be decreased by $113 billion in the next decade. The so-called 'doughnut hole' in prescription drug coverage would be closed. In the long term, the proposal would set up an independent commission that could alter payments further.<ref name=lori/>

Additionally, a small portion of funds would come from a new cap imposed on [[Flexible Spending Accounts]] (FSAs), pre-tax health benefits that enable millions of Americans to manage their out-of-pocket health care costs. Americans Healthy Future Act would impose a $2,500 limit on contributions to FSAs. Unfortunately, 7 million Americans have FSAs above $2,500, and those with the highest out-of-pocket health care costs- the sickest – would be hit the hardest by the restrictions.<ref>USA Today.

===CBO scoring of the bill===
[[File:FordHOB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ford House Office Building, where the CBO is located.]]

The proposal was initially designed to cost $856 billion over the next ten years. However, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) stated on September 16 that it would only cost about $774 billion over that period.<ref name=victoria/> The [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] report stated that enacting the proposal would, on net, end up reducing the [[United States public debt|federal deficit]] by $16 billion in 2019. It also estimated that, by 2019, the number of non-elderly [[Uninsured in the U.S.|uninsured people]] would fall about 29 million, which would leave about 25 million of the non-elderly (about one-third [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]]) still uninsured. Thus, the number of non-elderly legal residents with insurance would rise from about 83% being covered to about 94% being covered.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Congressional Budget Office]]: [http://cboblog.cbo.gov/ Director's Blog]|title=Preliminary Analysis of Specifications for the Chairman’s Mark of the America’s Healthy Future Act|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2009|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=10572}}</ref> A [[Forbes.com]] report has stated that "it's not entirely clear what will happen to health care costs in 2020 and beyond."<ref name=FAQ/>

On September 24, the CBO re-evaluated the proposal, taking into account the changes created by the Senate Committee. The CBO stated that the proposal would bring in $23 billion in the first ten years.<ref name=line/> Specifically, the Committee decreased the penalties for avoiding buying insurance, expanded the subsidies, and lowered the excise tax on high end insurance plans.<ref name=martin/> A CBO report issued on October 7 stated that enacting the proposal would, on net, end up reducing the [[United States public debt|federal deficit]] by $81 billion over the 2010-2019 period.<ref name=CBO-Oct7/> That report prompted praise from [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] and from [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]], Dem. from [[Nevada]], who called the scoring a "landmark occasion". [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]], Rep. from [[Kentucky]], criticized the numbers as misleading given that the Baucus proposal would not come into effect for about another five years.<ref name=set-for>{{cite news|publisher=[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]|title=Health Reform Vote Set for Senate Finance Committee|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec09/health_10-08.html|date=October 8, 2009|accessdate=October 10, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091010030511/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec09/health_10-08.html| archivedate= 10 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Changes to the proposal===
On September 25, the health correspondent for the ''[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]'' reported that the Committee had cut the proposed tax to medical supplies that belong to 'Class A', which includes items such as [[condoms]] and [[Band-Aid|band-aids]] that cost below $100. Only the other classes would be taxed.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]''|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/health/july-dec09/reformwrap_09-25.html|date=September 25, 2009|title=Health Bill Takes Shape in Senate Committee as Debate Continues|accessdate=October 5, 2009}}</ref> On October 14, journalists from the ''[[Financial Times]]'' stated that the 'Cadillac plans' tax would now impose a 40% fee on any plans exceeding $8,000 a year for individuals and $21,000 a year for families. They also described the [[individual mandate]] requirement as "much watered-down", with those earning less than 300% of the federal poverty now subject to a penalty of between $750 and $1,500 a year.<ref name=essential>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4df993ec-b859-11de-8ca9-00144feab49a.html|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|date=October 14, 2009|accessdate=October 14, 2009|title=Essential features of 'Baucus bill'|author1=Edward Luce|author2=Kevin Sieff| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091017040053/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4df993ec-b859-11de-8ca9-00144feab49a.html| archivedate= 17 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Comparisons with other bills==
Both the [[United States House|House]] health care reform bill ([[HR 3200]]) and the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee's]] bill (S 1679) have a [[Health care public option|public plan]]. Baucus' proposal does not.<ref name=line/> The [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee]] is considered to be more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] than the Finance Committee.<ref name=janet/> According to [[Norman Ornstein]] of the [[American Enterprise Institute]], a conservative think tank, the Health Committee's proposal and the House bill will both lead to budget deficits in contrast to the Baucus' plan, which would reduce the debt. [[Norman Ornstein|Ornstein]] has argued that this is an important advantage for the Baucus plan.<ref name=set-for/> [[Howard Dean]] has stated that the majority of Senate Democrats support a more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] plan.<ref name=dean/> If it reaches the Senate floor, Baucus' proposal will have to be amalgamated with the Health Committee's proposal.<ref name=lightman/>

On September 29, the Finance Committee rejected two amendments to add a public plan to Baucus' proposal. Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]]'s  amendment was rejected 15 to 8, with five Democrats (Baucus, [[Kent Conrad]], [[Blanche Lincoln]], [[Tom Carper]], [[Bill Nelson]]) and all Republicans voting no. Senator [[Chuck Schumer]]'s amendment was defeated 13 to 10, with three Democrats (Baucus, Conrad, Lincoln) and all Republicans voting no.<ref name="Pear"/>

===Responses from Finance Committee members===

[[File:MAXWH.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Committee Chairman [[Max Baucus]] (center) pictured with Ranking Committee Member [[Charles Grassley]] (left)]]

According to ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the proposal was "much-anticipated" and it represented the only attempt by a [[Senate committee]] to reach [[bipartisan]] compromise.<ref name=victoria/> [[McClatchy Newspapers]] has also called the proposal "closely watched".<ref name=lightman/> After its release, the proposal divided Congressional Democrats and attracted no support at all from Congressional Republicans according to [[National Public Radio]] health correspondent Julie Rovner.<ref name=set-for/>

All of the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee initially announced opposition to the proposal. Sen. [[Mike Enzi]] of [[Wyoming]] remarked, "[t]his bill does not do enough to lower costs, and in many cases, it will actually increase health-care costs through the new taxes mandated".<ref name=martin>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090922-712038.html|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=September 26, 2009|date=September 22, 2009|author1=Martin Vaughan|author2=Patrick Yoest|title=2nd UPDATE: Revised Baucus Health Plan Eases Insurers' Excise Tax}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Sen.

===Amendments and proposed amendments===
[[File:Charles Schumer official portrait.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Sen. [[Charles Schumer]].]]
The amending process, known officially as the 'mark-up', began on September 22.<ref name=snowe/> The committee members offered 564 possible amendments, which involved a wide variety of issues. Baucus said in his opening statement that "[t]his is our opportunity to make history". The members, collectively, spent over three hours in their opening comments.<ref name=lightman>{{cite news|title=Only 564 amendments offered to Baucus health-care bill|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/politics/story/75856.html|first=David|last=Lightman|publisher=[[McClatchy Newspapers]]|date=September 22, 2009|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref>

Baucus played a key role in facilitating the recent agreement between the [[Obama administration]] and the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] in which the group promised a $80 billion reduction in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] drug prices over ten years. The administration then promised in return not to make any more financial demands on the group in the future. On Sept. 25, Democratic Sen. [[Bill Nelson]] of [[Florida]] created an amendment to reverse the deal. The Committee voted 13-10 to reject the amendment.<ref name=line/>

The Finance Committee also rejected, by 14-9, an amendment removing the [[individual mandate]] from the proposal. Republican Sen. [[Jim Bunning]] of [[Kentucky]] proposed the change, which he said would remove an '[[un-American]]' requirement.

[[Tom Harkin]] of [[Iowa]], who became Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] following the [[Ted_Kennedy#Death|death]] of Sen.

===Responses from the Obama administration===
The day after Baucus made his proposal, [[POTUS|President]] [[Barack Obama]] referred to the plan during a speech at the [[University of Maryland]]. He declined to endorse Baucus's plan directly, but he criticized the opponents of his broader goals in health care reform. The crowd of [[left-wing politics|left-leaning]] [[Higher education in the United States|college students]] booed at the mention of Baucus' proposal and cheered at Obama's other comments.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/59245-baucus-bill-booed-at-healthcare-rally|accessdate=October 15, 2009|publisher=''[[The Hill (paper)|The Hill]]''|title=Baucus bill booed at Obama health rally|first=Sam|last=Youngman|date=September 17, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090918100012/http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/59245-baucus-bill-booed-at-healthcare-rally| archivedate= 18 September 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Obama praised the Senate Finance Committee's vote in support of the Baucus plan on a September 13 address. He described the vote as a "critical milestone" and stated that it "has brought us significantly closer to achieving the core objectives I laid out". The President also said, "We are now closer than ever before to passing health care reform, but we're not there yet... Now's the time to dig in and work even harder to get things done."<ref>{{cite news|first=Stephanie|last=Condon|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=October 17, 2009|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/10/13/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5382669.shtml|title=Obama Praises Senate Panel, Olympia Snowe|date=September 13, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091017073301/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/10/13/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5382669.shtml?| archivedate= 17 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Harold A. Schaitberger, general president of the [[International Association of Fire Fighters]], stated that the proposal "puts a bigger tax on middle-income Americans who are already paying enough". [[James P. Hoffa|Jim Hoffa]], president of the [[Teamsters]] [[labour union|union]], and Sen. [[John D. Rockefeller IV]] also expressed opposition to the health plan tax. [[POTUS|President]] [[Barack Obama]] expressed support for the proposed tax, saying that "I do think that giving a disincentive to insurance companies to offer [[Cadillac insurance plan|Cadillac plans]] that don’t make people healthier is part of the way that we’re going to bring down health care costs for everybody over the long term."<ref name=cadillac/> Republicans in the Finance Committee have called the tax a violation of [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama's campaign promise]] to not raise [[Taxation in the United States|taxes]] on anyone earning less than $250,000 a year.<ref name=janet/>
