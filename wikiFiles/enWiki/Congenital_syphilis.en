'''Congenital syphilis''' is [[syphilis]] present in utero and at birth, and occurs when a child is born to a mother with [[secondary syphilis]]. Untreated syphilis results in a high risk of a poor outcome of pregnancy, including [[mulberry molar]]s in the fetus. Syphilis can cause [[miscarriage]]s, [[premature birth]]s, [[stillbirth]]s, or death of newborn babies. Some infants with congenital syphilis have symptoms at birth, but most develop symptoms later. Untreated babies can have deformities, delays in development, or [[seizures]] along with many other problems such as rash, fever, [[hepatosplenomegaly]], [[anemia]], and [[jaundice]]. Sores on infected babies are infectious. Rarely, the symptoms of syphilis go unseen in infants so that they develop the symptoms of late-stage syphilis, including damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain.<ref>http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/stdsyph.htm accessed 10/17/2006.</ref>

==Classification==
===Early===
[[File:The face of a newborn infant with Congenital Syphilis.tif|thumb|The face of a newborn infant displaying [[pathologic morphology]] indicative of Congenital syphilis]]
This is a subset of cases of congenital syphilis. Newborns may be asymptomatic and are only identified on routine [[prenatal screening]]. If not identified and treated, these newborns develop poor feeding and [[rhinorrhea]]. By definition, early congenital syphilis occurs in children between 0 and 2 years old.<ref>http://www.pitt.edu/~SUPER1/lecture/lec13881/008.htm</ref> After, they can develop [[late congenital syphilis]].

Symptomatic newborns, if not [[stillbirth|stillborn]], are born premature, with [[hepatosplenomegaly]], skeletal abnormalities, [[pneumonia]] and a bullous skin disease known as pemphigus syphiliticus.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2193.htm eMedicine - Syphilis : Article by Muhammad Waseem<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>

===Late===
Late congenital syphilis is a subset of cases of congenital syphilis. By definition, it occurs in children at or greater than 2 years of age who acquired the infection trans-placentally. 

Symptoms include<ref name="pitt">http://www.pitt.edu/~SUPER1/lecture/lec13881/016.htm</ref>
*blunted upper incisor teeth known as [[Hutchinson's teeth]]
*inflammation of the cornea known as interstitial [[keratitis]]
*[[deafness]] from auditory nerve disease
*frontal bossing (prominence of the brow ridge)
*[[saddle nose]] (collapse of the bony part of nose)
*hard [[palate]] defect
*swollen knees
*[[saber shin]]s
*short maxillae
*protruding mandible

A frequently-found group of symptoms is Hutchinson's triad, which consists of Hutchinson's teeth (notched incisors), keratitis and deafness and occurs in 63% of cases.<ref name="pitt"/>

Treatment (with penicillin) before the development of late symptoms is essential.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5106a1.htm#CongSyphilis |title=Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines - 2002 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|List of dental abnormalities associated with cutaneous conditions}}
*abnormal [[x-rays]].
*[[Hutchinson's triad]], a set of symptoms consisting of [[deafness]], [[Hutchinson's teeth]] (centrally notched, widely-spaced peg-shaped upper central [[incisors]]), and interstitial [[keratitis]] (IK), an inflammation of the cornea which can lead to corneal scarring and potentially blindness.
*mulberry [[molars]] (permanent first molars with multiple poorly developed cusps).
*frontal [[bossing]].
*poorly developed [[maxillae]].
*[[enlarged liver]].
*[[enlarged spleen]].
*[[petechiae]].
*other [[skin rash]].
*[[sabre shins]].
*[[anemia]].
*[[lymph node enlargement]].
*[[jaundice]].
*[[pseudoparalysis]].
*[[snuffles]], the name given to [[rhinitis]] in this situation.  When chronic, this can lead to [[saddle nose]] deformity.
*[[rhagades]], linear scars at the angles of the mouth and nose result from bacterial infection of skin lesions.
*[[Higoumenakis sign]], enlargement of the sternal end of clavicle in late congenital syphilis.

Death from congenital syphilis is usually through [[pulmonary hemorrhage]].

==Treatment==
If a pregnant mother is identified as being infected with syphilis, treatment can effectively prevent congenital syphilis from developing in the unborn child, especially if she is treated before the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The child is at greatest risk of contracting syphilis when the mother is in the early stages of infection, but the disease can be passed at any point during pregnancy, even during delivery (if the child had not already contracted it). A woman in the secondary stage of syphilis decreases her child's risk of developing congenital syphilis by 98% if she receives treatment before the last month of pregnancy.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/hw195492.asp?navbar=hw195073 Congenital syphilis<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> An afflicted child can be treated using antibiotics much like an adult; however, any developmental symptoms are likely to be permanent.

Kassowitz’s law is an [[empirical]] [[observation]] used in context of congenital syphilis stating that the greater the duration between the [[infection]] of the mother and [[pregnancy]], the better is the outcome for the [[infant]]. Features of a better outcome include less chance of stillbirth and of developing congenital syphilis.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Singh|first= Ameeta E.|coauthors= Barbara Romanowski|date=1 April 1999|title= Syphilis: Review with Emphasis on Clinical, Epidemiologic, and Some Biologic Features|journal= Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume= 12|issue= 2|pages= 187–209|accessdate=2008-06-26 |pmid= 10194456 |pmc= 88914 }}</ref>
