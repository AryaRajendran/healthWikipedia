'''Appendicitis'''  is a condition characterized by [[inflammation]] of the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]]. It is classified as a [[medical emergency]] and many cases require [[appendectomy|removal of the inflamed appendix]], either by [[laparotomy]] or [[laparoscopy]]. Untreated, mortality is high, mainly because of the risk of rupture leading to infection and inflammation of the intestinal lining ([[peritoneum]]) and eventual [[sepsis]], clinically known as [[peritonitis]] which can lead to circulatory [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref name="hobbler">{{Cite journal|last=Hobler |first=K. |coauthors= |year=1998 |month=Spring |title=Acute and Suppurative Appendicitis: Disease Duration and its Implications for Quality Improvement |journal=Permanente Medical Journal |volume=2}}</ref> [[Reginald Heber Fitz|Reginald Fitz]] first described acute and chronic appendicitis in 1886,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Fitz RH |title=Perforating inflammation of the vermiform appendix with special reference to its early diagnosis and treatment |journal=Am J Med Sci |volume= |issue=92 |pages=321–46 |year=1886}}</ref> and it has been recognized as one of the most common causes of severe [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] abdominal [[pain]] worldwide.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Stomach colon rectum diagram.svg|thumb|Location of the appendix in the [[digestive system]]]]
Pain first, vomiting next and fever last has been described as the classic presentation of acute appendicitis. Since the innervation of the appendix enters the [[spinal cord]] at the same level as the [[navel|umbilicus]] (belly button), the pain begins stomach-high. Later, as the appendix becomes more swollen and irritates the adjoining abdominal wall, it tends to localize over several hours into the right lower quadrant, except in children under three years. This pain can be elicited through various signs and can be severe. Signs include localized findings in the right [[iliac fossa]]. The abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure ([[palpation]]). Also, there is severe pain on sudden release of deep pressure in the lower abdomen ([[rebound tenderness]]). In case of a retrocecal appendix (appendix localized behind the [[cecum]]), however, even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness (silent appendix), the reason being that the [[cecum]], distended with gas, protects the inflamed appendix from the pressure. Similarly, if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis, there is usually complete absence of abdominal rigidity. In such cases, a digital [[rectal examination]] elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch. Coughing causes point tenderness in this area ([[McBurney's point]]) and this is the least painful way to localize the inflamed appendix. If the abdomen on palpation is also involuntarily guarded (rigid), there should be a strong suspicion of [[peritonitis]], requiring urgent surgical intervention.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Lawrence W. Way, Gerard M. Doherty | title = Surgery | location = US | publisher = McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. |isbn =0-8385-1456-1 }}</ref>

==Causes==
On the basis of experimental evidence, acute appendicitis seems to be the end result of a primary obstruction of the appendix [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] (the inside space of a tubular structure).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wangensteen OH, Bowers WF |title=Significance of the obstructive factor in the genesis of acute appendicitis |journal=Arch Surg |volume=34 |issue= 3|pages=496–526 |year=1937|doi=10.1001/archsurg.1937.01190090121006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Pieper R, Kager L, Tidefeldt U |title=Obstruction of appendix vermiformis causing acute appendicitis. On of the most common causes of this is an acute viral infection which causes lymphoid hyperplasia and therefore obstruction. An experimental study in the rabbit |journal=Acta Chir Scand |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=63–72 |year=1982 |pmid=7136413 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Once this obstruction occurs, the appendix subsequently becomes filled with [[mucus]] and swells, increasing pressures within the lumen and the walls of the appendix, resulting in [[thrombosis]] and [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of the small vessels, and stasis of [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic flow]]. Rarely, spontaneous recovery can occur at this point. As the former progresses, the appendix becomes [[Ischemia|ischemic]] and then [[Necrosis|necrotic]]. As [[bacteria]] begin to leak out through the dying walls, [[pus]] forms within and around the appendix (suppuration). The end result of this cascade is appendiceal rupture (a 'burst appendix') causing [[peritonitis]], which may lead to [[sepsis|septicemia]] and eventually [[death]].

The causative agents include foreign bodies, [[physical trauma|trauma]], [[Intestinal parasite|intestinal worms]], [[Lymphadenopathy|lymphadenitis]], and, most commonly, calcified fecal deposits known as appendicoliths or fecaliths<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hollerman J.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on patient history (symptoms) and physical examination backed by an elevation of neutrophilic white blood cells. Histories fall into two categories, typical and atypical.  Typical appendicitis usually includes abdominal pain beginning in the region of the umbilicus for several hours, associated with anorexia, nausea or vomiting.  The pain then "settles" into the right lower quadrant (or the left lower quadrant in patients with [[situs inversus totalis]]), where tenderness develops. The combination of pain, anorexia, leukocytosis, and fever is classic. Atypical histories lack this typical progression and may include pain in the right lower quadrant as an initial symptom. Atypical histories often require imaging with ultrasound and/or CT scanning.<ref name="Hobler">{{Cite journal|last=Hobler |first=K. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |month=Spring |title=Acute and Suppurative Appendicitis: Disease Duration and its Implications for Quality Improvement |journal=Permanente Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= |id= |url=http://xnet.kp.org/permanentejournal/spring98pj/Spring98.pdf#page=7 |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Clinical===

====Aure-Rozanova sign====
Increased pain on palpation with finger in right [[Lumbar triangle|Petit triangle]] (can be a positive Shchetkin-Bloomberg's sign) - typical in retrocecal position of the appendix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://max.1gb.ru/surg/s16_pract.shtml |title=Практические навыки по факультетской хирургии |publisher=Max.1gb.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref>

Also referred as rebound tenderness. Deep palpation of the viscera over the suspected inflamed appendix followed by sudden release of the pressure causes the severe pain on the site indicating positive Blumberg's sign and peritonitis.<ref>[http://offlineclinic.com/blumbergs-sign-rebound-tenderness/142/ "Blumberg's sign - Rebound Tenderness"] | Offline Clinic</ref>

====Bartomier-Michelson's sign====
Increased pain on palpation at the right iliac region as patient lies on his/her left side compared to when patient was on supine position.

====Dunphy's sign====
Increased pain in the right lower quadrant with coughing.<ref>Small V (2008) Surgical emergencies. In ''Dolan B and Holt L (eds) Accident and Emergency: Theory into Practice, 2nd edition''. Elsevier.</ref>

====Kocher's (Kosher's) sign====
From the history given, the appearance of pain in the epigastric region or around the stomach at the beginning of disease with a subsequent shift to the right iliac region.

====Massouh sign====
{{Main|Massouh sign}}
This sign, developed in and popular in southwest England, describes a firm swish of the examiner’s index and middle finger across the patient’s abdomen from xiphoid sternum to first the left and then the right iliac fossa. A positive Massouh sign is a grimace of the patient upon a right sided (and not left) sweep, because initial stage appendicitis usually causes localised irritation of the well-innervated peritoneum.

====Obturator sign====
{{Main|Obturator sign}}
If an inflamed appendix is in contact with the [[obturator internus]], spasm of the muscle (called the [[obturator sign]]) can be demonstrated by flexing and internal rotation of the hip. This maneuver will cause pain in the [[hypogastrium]].

====Psoas sign====
{{Main|Psoas sign}}
Psoas sign or "Obraztsova's sign" is right lower-quadrant pain that is produced with either the passive extension of the patient's right hip (patient lying on left side, with knee in flexion) or by the patient's active flexion of the right hip while supine.  The pain elicited is due to inflammation of the peritoneum overlying the iliopsoas muscles and inflammation of the psoas muscles themselves. Straightening out the leg causes pain because it stretches these muscles, while flexing the hip activates the iliopsoas and therefore also causes pain.

====Rovsing's sign====
{{Main|Rovsing's sign}}
Continuous deep palpation starting from the left [[iliac fossa]] upwards (counterclockwise along the colon) may cause pain in the right iliac fossa, by pushing bowel contents towards the [[ileocaecal valve]] and thus increasing pressure around the appendix.<ref>N. T. Rovsing, "Indirektes Hervorrufen des typischen Schmerzes an McBurney's Punkt. Ein Beitrag zur diagnostik der Appendicitis und Typhlitis". ''Zentralblatt für Chirurgie'', Leipzig, 1907, 34: 1257-1259 {{de icon}}</ref>

====Sitkovskiy (Rosenstein)'s sign====
Increased pain in the right iliac region as patient lies on his/her left side.

===Blood and urine test===
Most people suspected of having appendicitis would be asked to do a blood test. Half of the time, the blood test is normal, so it is not that useful in diagnosing appendicitis.

Two forms of blood tests are commonly done:
Full blood count (FBC), also known as complete blood count (CBC), is an inexpensive and commonly requested blood test. It involves measuring the blood for its richness in red blood cells, as well as the number of the various white blood cell constituents in it. The number of white cells in the blood is usually less than 10,000 cells per cubic millimeter. An abnormal rise in the number of white blood cells in the blood is a crude indicator of infection or inflammation going on in the body. Such a rise is not specific to appendicitis alone. If it is abnormally elevated, with a good history and examination findings pointing towards appendicitis, the likelihood of having the disease is higher. In pregnancy,  elevation of white blood cells may be normal, without any infection present.

[[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) is an acute-phase response protein produced by the liver in response to any infection or inflammatory process in the body. Again, like the FBC, it is not a specific test. It is another crude marker of infection or inflammation. Inflammation at ANY site can lead to a rise in CRP.
A significant rise in CRP, with corresponding signs and symptoms of appendicitis, is a useful indicator in the diagnosis of appendicitis. If the CRP continues to be normal after 72 hours of the onset of pain, the appendicitis likely will resolve on its own without intervention. A worsening CRP with good history is a sure signal of impending perforation or rupture and abscess formation.

A urine test in appendicitis is usually normal. It may, however, show blood if the appendix is rubbing on the bladder, causing irritation.  It is important to rule out an [[ectopic pregnancy]] in women of childbearing age.

===Imaging===
Appendicitis in children is common enough to merit special attention. Because of the health risks of exposing children to radiation, many medical societies recommend that in confirming a diagnosis with children the ultrasound is a preferred first choice with x-rays being a legitimate follow-up when warranted.<ref name="ACRfive">{{Citation |author1 = American College of Radiology |author1-link = American College of Radiology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American College of Radiology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Radiology.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name="effectiveusct">{{cite PMID|21324843}}</ref><ref name="appendicitischildren">{{cite PMID|19098225}}</ref> CT scan is more accurate than ultrasound for the diagnosis of appendicitis in adults and adolescents. CT scan has a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 94%, [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 95%. Ultrasonography had an overall [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 86%, a [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 81%.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Terasawa T, Blackmore CC, Bent S, Kohlwes RJ |title=Systematic review: computed tomography and ultrasonography to detect acute appendicitis in adults and adolescents |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=141 |issue=7|pages=537–46 |year=2004 |pmid=15466771 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

====X–Ray====
In 10% of patients with appendicitis, plain abdominal X-ray may demonstrate hard formed feces in the lumen of the appendix (fecolith). It is agreed that the finding of Fecolith in the appendix on X-ray alone is a reason to operate to remove the appendix, because of the potential to cause worsening symptoms. In this respect, a plain abdominal X-ray may be useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis, though plain abdominal X- ray is no longer requested routinely in suspected cases of appendicitis. An abdominal X-ray may be done with a barium enema contrast to diagnose appendicitis.
Barium enema is whitish fluid that is passed up into the rectum to act as a contrast. It will usually fill the whole of the large bowel. In normal appendix, the lumen will be present and the barium fills it up and is seen when the X-ray film is shot. In appendicitis, the lumen of the appendix will not be visible on the barium film.

====Ultrasound====
[[File:SonoAppendizitis.JPG|thumb|Ultrasound image of an acute appendicitis]]
[[Ultrasonography]] and [[Doppler sonography]] provide useful means to detect appendicitis, especially in children, and shows free fluid collection in the right iliac fossa, along with a visible appendix without blood flow in color Doppler. In some cases (15% approximately), however, ultrasonography of the [[iliac fossa]] does not reveal any abnormalities despite the presence of appendicitis. This is especially true of early appendicitis before the appendix has become significantly distended and in adults where larger amounts of fat and bowel gas make actually seeing the appendix technically difficult. Despite these limitations, sonographic imaging in experienced hands can often distinguish between appendicitis and other diseases with very similar symptoms, such as [[inflammation]] of [[lymph nodes]] near the appendix or pain originating from other pelvic organs such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes.

====Computed tomography====
[[File:Appy4.jpg|thumb|widthpx|A CT scan demonstrating acute appendicitis (note the appendix has a diameter of 17.1mm and there is surrounding fat stranding.)]]
[[File:Appy5.jpg|thumb|A [[fecalith]] marked by the arrow which has resulted in acute appendicitis.]]

Where it is readily available, [[computed tomography|CT scan]] has become frequently used, especially in adults whose diagnosis is not obvious on history and physical examination.  Concerns about radiation, however, tend to limit use of CT in pregnant women and children.  A properly performed CT scan with modern equipment has a detection rate (sensitivity) of over 95%, and a similar [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]]. Signs of appendicitis on CT scan include lack of oral contrast (oral dye) in the appendix, direct visualization of appendiceal enlargement (greater than 6&nbsp;mm in cross-sectional diameter), and appendiceal wall enhancement with IV contrast (IV dye). The inflammation caused by appendicitis in the surrounding peritoneal fat (so called "fat stranding") can also be observed on CT, providing a mechanism to detect early appendicitis and a clue that appendicitis may be present even when the appendix is not well seen. Thus, diagnosis of appendicitis by CT is made more difficult in very thin patients and in children, both of whom tend to lack significant fat within the abdomen. The utility of CT scanning is made clear, however, by the impact it has had on negative [[appendectomy]] rates. For example, use of CT for diagnosis of appendicitis in Boston, MA has decreased the chance of finding a normal appendix at surgery from 20% in the pre-CT era to only 3% according to data from the Massachusetts General Hospital.

===Scoring systems===

====Alvarado score====
{| class="wikitable" style = "float: right; margin-left:15px; text-align:center"
|+ Alvarado score

|}
A number of clinical and laboratory-based scoring systems have been devised to assist diagnosis. The most widely used is [[Alvarado score]].
A score below 5 is strongly against a diagnosis of appendicitis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1671|title=BestBets: The Alvarado Scoring System is an accurate diagnostic tool for appendicitis |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> while a score of 7 or more is strongly predictive of acute appendicitis.  In patients with an equivocal score of 5 or 6, a CT scan is used to further reduce the rate of negative appendicectomy.

====Tzanakis scoring====
Tzanakis scoring: Tzanakis and colleagues, in 2005 published a simplified system, now called the Tzanakis scoring system for appendicitis, to aid the diagnosis of appendicitis. It incorporates the presence of four variables made up of specific signs and symptoms (presence of right lower abdominal tenderness = 4 points and rebound tenderness = 3), laboratory findings (presence of white blood cells greater than 12,000 in the blood = 2), as well as ultrasound findings (presence of positive ultrasound scan findings of appendicitis = 6), to which scores are allocated, in the computing of a scoring to predict the presence of appendicitis.<br />The maximum score is a total score of 15; where a patient scores 8 or more points, there is greater than 96% chance that appendicitis exists.

===Pathology===
[[File:Appendicitis - low mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of appendicitis and periappendicitis. [[H&E stain]].]]
[[File:Appendicitis - very high mag.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Micrograph]] of appendicitis showing neutrophils in the muscularis propria. [[H&E stain]].]]
The definitive diagnosis is based on [[pathology]].  The [[histology|histologic]] findings of appendicits are [[neutrophil]]s in the [[muscularis propria]].

Periappendicits, [[inflammation]] of tissues around the appendix, is often found in conjunction with other abdominal pathology.<ref name=pmid2349982>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fink | first1 = AS. | last2 = Kosakowski | first2 = CA. | last3 = Hiatt | first3 = JR. | last4 = Cochran | first4 = AJ. | title = Periappendicitis is a significant clinical finding | journal = Am J Surg | volume = 159 | issue = 6 | pages = 564–8 | month = Jun | year = 1990 | doi =  10.1016/S0002-9610(06)80067-X| pmid = 2349982 }}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
In children: [[Gastroenteritis]], [[mesenteric adenitis]], [[Meckel's diverticulum|Meckel's diverticulitis]], [[intussusception]], [[Henoch-Schönlein purpura]], lobar [[pneumonia]], [[urinary tract infection]] (abdominal pain in the absence of other symptoms can occur in children with UTI), new-onset [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]], [[pancreatitis]], and abdominal trauma from [[child abuse]]; [[distal intestinal obstruction syndrome]] in children with cystic fibrosis; [[typhlitis]] in children with leukemia;

In women: A pregnancy test is important in all women of child bearing age, as [[Ectopic pregnancy|ectopic pregnancies]] and appendicitis present similar symptoms.
Other causes [[menarche]], dysmenorrhea, [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], [[endometriosis]], [[Mittelschmerz]] (the passing of an egg in the ovaries approximately two weeks before an expected menstruation cycle).

In men: [[testicular torsion]];

In adults: new-onset [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], regional enteritis, [[renal colic]], perforated [[peptic ulcer]], [[pancreatitis]], [[rectus sheath hematoma]];

In elderly: [[diverticulitis]], intestinal obstruction, [[colon cancer|colonic carcinoma]], [[mesenteric ischemia]], leaking [[aortic aneurysm]].

==Management==
Acute appendicitis is typically managed by [[surgery]] however in uncomplicated cases [[antibiotic]]s are both effective and safe.<ref name=Antibiotics2012>{{cite journal|last=Varadhan|first=K. K.|coauthors=Neal, K. R., Lobo, D.

===Pain===
Pain medications (such as [[morphine]]) do not appear to affect the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis and therefore should be given early in the persons care.<ref name=And2008>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=M|coauthors=Collins, E|title=Analgesia for children with acute abdominal pain and diagnostic accuracy.|journal=Archives of disease in childhood|date=2008 Nov|volume=93|issue=11|pages=995–7|pmid=18305071|url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1404}}</ref> Historically there were concerns among some general surgeons that analgesics would affect the clinical exam in children and thus some recommended that they not be given until the surgeon in question was able to examine the person for themselves.<ref name=And2008/>

===Surgery===
{{see also|Appendectomy}}
[[File:Inflamed appendix.jpg|thumb|Inflamed appendix removal by open surgery]]
[[File:Appendix-Entfernung.jpg|thumb|Laparoscopic appendectomy.]]
The [[surgery|surgical]] procedure for the removal of the appendix is called an [[appendicectomy]]. [[Laparoscopic]] removal (via three small incisions with a camera to visualize the area of interest in the abdomen) seem to have some advantages over an open procedures especially in young females and the obese.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sauerland|first=S|coauthors=Jaschinski, T; Neugebauer, EA|title=Laparoscopic versus open surgery for suspected appendicitis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2010 Oct 6|issue=10|pages=CD001546|pmid=20927725}}</ref>

====Laparotomy====
Laparotomy is the traditional type of surgery used for treating appendicitis. This procedure consists in the removal of the infected appendix through a single larger incision in the lower right area of the abdomen.<ref>[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/appendicitis/ Appendicitis procedures explained] National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse. Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref> The incision in a laparotomy is usually {{convert|2|to|3|in}} long. This type of surgery is used also for visualizing and examining structures inside the [[abdominal cavity]] and it is called exploratory laparotomy.

During a traditional appendectomy procedure, the patient is placed under general [[anesthesia]] to keep the muscles completely relaxed and to keep the patient unconscious. The incision is two to three inches (76&nbsp;mm) long and it is made in the right lower abdomen, several inches above the [[hip bone]].<ref>[http://surgery.about.com/od/proceduresaz/ss/LaparotomySurge.htm Laparotomy abdominal surgery] About surgeries online portal. Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref> Once the incision opens the abdomen cavity and the appendix is identified, the [[surgeon]] removes the infected tissue and cuts the appendix from the surrounding tissue. After the surgeon inspects carefully and closely the infected area and there are no signs that surrounding tissues are damaged or infected, he will start closing the incision. This means sewing the muscles and using [[surgical staple]]s or [[surgical suture|stitches]] to close the skin up. In order to prevent infections the incision is covered with a [[Dressing (medical)|sterile bandage]].

The entire procedure does not last longer than an hour if complications do not occur.

====Laparoscopic surgery====
The newer method to treat appendicitis is the [[laparoscopic surgery]]. This surgical procedure consists of making three to four incisions in the abdomen, each {{convert|0.25|to|0.5|in|mm}} long. This type of appendectomy is made by inserting a special surgical tool called laparoscope into one of the incisions. The laparoscope is connected to a monitor outside the patient's body and it is designed to help the surgeon to inspect the infected area in the abdomen. The other two incisions are made for the specific removal of the appendix by using [[surgical instrument]]s.
Laparoscopic surgery also requires [[general anesthesia]] and it can last up to two hours.
The latest methods are [[Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery|NOTES]] appendectomy pioneered in Coimbatore, India where there is no incision on the external skin<ref>28</ref> and SILS (Single incision laparoscopic Surgery) where a single 2.5&nbsp;cm incision is made to perform the surgery.
This finding was very significant to the appendicitis patients and now thousands of people every year survive.

====Pre surgery====
The treatment begins by [[Nil per os|keeping the patient away from eating or drinking]] in preparation for surgery. An intravenous drip is used to hydrate the patient. [[Antibiotic]]s given intravenously such as [[cefuroxime]] and [[metronidazole]] may be administered early to help kill bacteria and thus reduce the spread of infection in the abdomen and postoperative complications in the abdomen or wound. Equivocal cases may become more difficult to assess with antibiotic treatment and benefit from serial examinations. If the stomach is empty (no food in the past six hours) general anaesthesia is usually used. Otherwise, [[spinal anaesthesia]] may be used.

Once the decision to perform an [[appendectomy]] has been made, the preparation procedure takes approximately one to two hours. Meanwhile, the surgeon will explain the surgery procedure and will present the risks that must be considered when performing an appendectomy. With all surgeries there are certain risks that must be evaluated before performing the procedures. However, the risks are different depending on the state of the appendix. If the appendix has not ruptured, the complication rate is only about 3% but if the appendix has ruptured, the complication rate rises to almost 59%.<ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/A-Ce/Appendectomy.html Appendicitis surgery procedures] Encyclopedia of surgery Portal. Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref> The most usual complications that can occur are pneumonia, [[hernia]] of the incision, [[thrombophlebitis]], bleeding or [[adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]].  Recent evidence indicates that a delay in obtaining surgery after admission results in no measurable difference in  patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/09/21/appendectomy-waits.html | work=CBC News |title='Emergency' appendix surgery can wait: MDs |date=2010-09-21}}</ref>

The surgeon will also explain how long the recovery process should take.  Abdomen hair is usually removed in order to avoid complications that may appear regarding the incision.
In most of the cases patients experience nausea or vomiting which requires specific medication before surgery. Antibiotics along with pain medication may also be administrated prior to appendectomies.

====After surgery====

Hospital lengths of stay typically range from a few hours to a few days, but can be a few weeks if complications occur. The recovery process may vary depending on the severity of the condition, if the appendix had ruptured or not before surgery. Appendix surgery recovery is generally a lot faster if the appendix did not rupture.<ref>[http://appendixsurgery.net Appendicitis surgery, removal and recovery] Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref> It is important that patients respect their doctor's advice and limit their physical activity so the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] can heal faster. Recovery after an appendectomy may not require diet changes or a lifestyle change.

After surgery occurs, the patient will be transferred to an [[postanesthesia care unit]] so his or her vital signs can be closely monitored to detect anesthesia- and/or surgery-related complications. Pain medication may also be administered if necessary. After patients are completely awake, they are moved into a hospital room to recover. Most individuals will be offered clear liquids the day after the surgery, then progress to a regular diet when the intestines start to function properly. Patients are recommended to sit up on the edge of the bed and walk short distances for several times a day. Moving is mandatory and pain medication may be given if necessary. Full recovery from appendectomies takes about four to six weeks, but can be prolonged to up to eight weeks if the appendix had ruptured.

==Prognosis==
Most appendicitis patients recover easily with surgical treatment, but complications can occur if treatment is delayed or if [[peritonitis]] occurs. Recovery time depends on age, condition, complications, and other circumstances, including the amount of alcohol consumption, but usually is between 10 and 28 days. For young children (around 10 years old), the recovery takes three weeks.

The real possibility of life-threatening peritonitis is the reason why acute appendicitis warrants speedy evaluation and treatment. The patient may have to undergo a [[medical evacuation]]. Appendectomies have occasionally been performed in emergency conditions (i.e., outside of a proper hospital), when a timely medical evaluation was impossible.

Typical acute appendicitis responds quickly to appendectomy and occasionally will resolve spontaneously. If appendicitis resolves spontaneously, it remains controversial whether an elective interval appendectomy should be performed to prevent a recurrent episode of appendicitis. Atypical appendicitis (associated with suppurative appendicitis) is more difficult to diagnose and is more apt to be complicated even when operated early. In either condition, prompt diagnosis and appendectomy yield the best results with full recovery in two to four weeks usually. Mortality and severe complications are unusual but do occur, especially if peritonitis persists and is untreated.
Another entity known as appendicular lump is talked about quite often. It happens when appendix is not removed early during infection and omentum and intestine get adherent to it forming a palpable lump. During this period, operation is risky unless there is pus formation evident by fever and toxicity or by USG. Medical management treats the condition.

An unusual complication of an appendectomy is "stump appendicitis": inflammation occurs in the remnant appendiceal stump left after a prior incomplete appendectomy.<ref name="pmid16536249">{{Cite journal|author=Liang MK, Lo HG, Marks JL |title=Stump appendicitis: a comprehensive review of literature |journal=The American surgeon |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=162–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16536249 |doi=}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
While appendectomy is a standard surgical procedure, its cost has been found to vary considerably, particularly in the United States. A 2012 study from the [[University of California, San Francisco]] published in the ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]'' analyzed 2009 data from nearly 20,000 adult patients treated for appendicitis in [[California]] hospitals. Researchers examined “only uncomplicated episodes of acute appendicitis” that involved “visits for patients 18 to 59 years old with hospitalization that lasted fewer than four days with routine discharges to home.” The lowest charge for removal of an appendix was $1,529 and the highest $182,955, almost 120 times greater. The median charge was $33,611.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/health-care-market-good-appendicitis-case-study/| title=Health Care as a 'Market Good'?
