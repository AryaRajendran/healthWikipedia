== Function ==

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the [[protein tyrosine phosphatase]] (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP contains an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains, and thus belongs to receptor type PTP. This gene is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. This PTP has been shown to be an essential regulator of T- and B-cell antigen receptor signaling. It functions through either direct interaction with components of the antigen receptor complexes or by activating various Src family kinases required for the antigen receptor signaling. This PTP also suppresses JAK kinases, and, thus, functions as a  negative regulator of cytokine receptor signaling. Four alternatively spliced transcripts variants of this gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported.<ref name="entrez" />

It is a type I [[transmembrane protein]] that is in various forms present on all differentiated [[hematopoietic]] cells except [[erythrocytes]] and [[plasma cells]] that assists in the activation of those cells (a form of [[co-stimulation]]). It is expressed in [[lymphoma]]s, [[B-cell]] [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], [[hairy cell leukemia]], and [[acute nonlymphocytic leukemia]].  A [[monoclonal antibody]] to CD45 is used in routine [[immunohistochemistry]] to differentiate between histological sections from lymphomas and carcinomas.<ref name=Leong>{{cite book|author=Leong, Anthony S-Y|author2=Cooper, Kumarason|author3=Leong, F Joel W-M|year=2003|title=Manual of Diagnostic Cytology|edition=2|publisher=Greenwich Medical Media, Ltd.|pages=121–124|isbn=1-84110-100-1}}</ref>

== Isoforms ==

The CD45 family consists of multiple members that are all products of a single complex gene. This gene contains 34 [[exons]] and three exons of the primary transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate up to eight different mature [[mRNA]]s and after translation eight different protein products. These three exons generate the RA, RB and RC isoforms.

Various isoforms of CD45 exist:
CD45RA, CD45RB, CD45RC, CD45RAB, CD45RAC, CD45RBC, CD45R0, CD45R (ABC).
CD45RA is located on naive T cells and CD45R0 is located on memory T cells. 
CD45 is also highly glycosylated. CD45R is the longest protein and migrates at 200 kDa when isolated from T cells. B cells also express CD45R with heavier glycosylation, bringing the molecular weight to 220 kDa, hence the name B220; B cell isoform of 220 kDa. B220 expression is not restricted to B cells and can also be expressed on activated T cells, on a subset of dendritic cells and other antigen presenting cells. 

Naive T lymphocytes express large CD45 isoforms and are usually positive for CD45RA. Activated and memory T lymphocytes express the shortest CD45 isoform, CD45R0, which lacks RA, RB and RC exons. This shortest isoform facilitates T cell activation.

The cytoplasmic domain of CD45 is one of the largest known and it has an intrinsic phosphatase activity that removes an inhibitory phosphate group on a [[tyrosine kinase]] called [[Lck]] (in T cells) or [[Lyn/Fyn/Lck]] (in B cells) and activates it.

CD45 has been recently shown to interact with the [[HCMV]] UL11 protein. This interaction results in functional paralysis of [[T cell]]s.<ref name="pmid22174689">{{cite journal | author = Gabaev I, Steinbrück L, Pokoyski C, Pich A, Stanton RJ, Schwinzer R, Schulz TF, Jacobs R, Messerle M, Kay-Fedorov PC | title = The human cytomegalovirus UL11 protein interacts with the receptor tyrosine phosphatase CD45, resulting in functional paralysis of T cells | journal = PLoS Pathog. | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = e1002432 | year = 2011 | month = December | pmid = 22174689 | pmc = 3234252 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002432 }}</ref>

==Clinical importance==
Stem cells of several varieties, including [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s and [[hæmatopoietic stem cell]]s are found in the [[bone marrow]]. If a clinician wishes to separate the two, the CD45 marker is used to distinguish the two stem cell types, as CD45 is found on all leukocytes.

==Use as a congenic marker==
There are two identifiable [[alleles]] of CD45 in mice: CD45.1 (Ly5.1) and CD45.2 (Ly5.2).  These two types of CD45 are believed to be functionally identical.  As such, they are routinely used in scientific research to allow identification of cells.  For instance, [[leukocytes]] can be transferred from a CD45.1 donor mouse, into a CD45.2 host mouse, and can be subsequently identified due to their expression of CD45.1.  This technique is also routinely used when generating chimeras.  An alternative system is the used of CD90 (Thy1) alleles.  The CD90.1/CD90.2 system is used in the same manner as the CD45.1/CD45.2 system.
