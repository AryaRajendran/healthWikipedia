==Medical practice==
Lafargue practiced medicine in [[Cheneyville, Louisiana|Cheneyville]], Baldwin, [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]], and, finally, Sulphur, where he located in 1915.<ref name=lahist/> In Baldwin, as the physician for a [[sawmill]], he treated accident victims and often performed operations and amputations with [[whisky]] as the only available [[anesthesia]].<ref name=doctors/> Lafargue opened his office in the Paragon Drug Store in Sulphur. He covered an area of some twenty-five miles by horseback, buggy, and later, a [[Model T Ford]].<ref name=doctors/> 

In [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], Lafargue was the Calcasieu Parish health officer from 1934-1938. He thereafter served as the Sulphur municipal health officer.

==Political and civic matters==
An active [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Lafargue was the mayor of Sulphur from 1926 to 1932, during which time he initiated many municipal improvements.
