==High myopia==
[[Myopia]] is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world.<ref name="Gross">Grossniklaus, H.E. and W.R. Green, Pathologic findings in pathologic myopia. Retina, 1992. 12(2): p. 127-33.</ref><ref name="Bores">Bores, L.D., Scleral Reinforcement, in Refractive Eye Surgery. 2001, Blackwell Science, Inc.: USA. p. 466-491.</ref>   It is caused by both genetic <ref name="Curtin">Curtin, B.J., The nature of pathological myopia, in The Myopias. 1985, Harper & Row: Philadelphia. p. 237-239.</ref> and environmental factors,<ref name="Saw">Saw, S., et al., Myopia: gene-environment interaction. Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore, 2000. 29(3): p. 290.</ref> such as mechanical stretching, excessive eye work and [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]], as well as an elevated [[intraocular pressure]].  It affects both children and adults.  In many cases, myopia will stabilize once the growth process has been completed, but in more severe chronic cases, loss of vision can occur.

Degenerative myopia, also known as malignant, pathological, or progressive myopia, is characterized by posterior [[sclera]] elongation and thinning (at least 25.5&nbsp;mm to 26.5&nbsp;mm) and high [[refractive errors]] of at least -5 to -7.5 diopters with an increase per year.<ref name="Gross" />  There may also be changes in the [[fundus (eye)|fundus]], including  posterior staphyloma, caused by the eye growing posteriorly and losing its spherical shape.<ref name="Bores" />  Since enlargement of the eye does not progress at a uniform rate, abnormal protrusions of uveal tissue may occur through weak points in the eye.  [[Staphyloma]] is marked by a thinning of sclera collagen bundles and decreased number of collagen striations. It correlates with a large posterior temporal bulge.  Curtin described five varieties, based on size, shape, and change in appearance of the [[optic nerve]] and retinal vessels, but the posterior pole type is the most common.<ref name="curtinn">Curtin, B.J., The posterior staphyloma of pathologic myopia. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc, 1977. 75: p. 67-86.</ref>  As the posterior staphyloma enlarges, choroidal tissue becomes thin and [[Bruch's membrane]] begins to break, creating lesions called lacquer cracks.  [[Neovascularization]] may occur, causing blood vessels to protrude through the cracks and leak in the space underneath the [[photoreceptor cell]] layer.  This hemorrhaging can lead to scarring and [[macular degeneration]], causing vision to gradually deteriorate.<ref name="Bores" />  If left untreated, high myopia can cause [[retinal detachment]], [[glaucoma]], and a higher risk of [[cataracts]].

==History==
The condition of posterior staphyloma in high myopia was first described by Scarpa in the 1800s.<ref name="scarpa">Scarpa, A. A. (1818). A Treatise on the Principal Diseases of the Eye. London.</ref> Speculation about reinforcement of the eye began in the 19th century, when Rubin noted that sclera reinforcement “is probably the only one of all the surgical techniques [for myopia] which attempts to correct a cause, rather than an effect”.<ref name="rubin">Rubin, M.L., Surgical procedures available for influencing refractive error., in Refractive Anomalies of the Eye. 1966, US Government Printing Office: Washington.</ref>  Procedures in early literature aimed at shortening the length of the eyeball by resecting a ring of sclera from the equator of the eye.<ref name="Bores" />  Later procedures focused on modifying the axial length of the eye, by preventing elongation and staphyloma progression by placing grafts over the posterior part of the eye.  In 1930, Shevelev proposed the idea of transplantation of [[fascia lata]] for sclera reinforcement.<ref name="shev">Shevelev, M.M., Operation against high myopia and scleralectasia with aid of the transplantation of fascia lata on thinned sclera. Russian Oftalmol J, 1930. 11(1): p. 107-110.</ref>  Curtin promoted the use of donor-sclera grafting for reinforcement.<ref name="ccurtin">Curtin, B.J., Surgical support of the posterior sclera: Part II. Clinical results. Am J Ophthalmol, 1961. 52: p. 253.</ref>  In 1976, Momose first introduced [[Lyodura]], a material derived from processed cadaver dura mater.<ref name="momo">Momose, A., Surgical treatment of myopia.... with special references to posterior scleral support operation and radial keratotomy. Vol. 31. 1983. 759-767.</ref>  At this point, many different surgeons made alterations to existing techniques.  Snyder and Thompson modified reinforcement techniques and had positive outcomes,<ref name="snyder">Snyder, A. and F. Thompson, A simplified technique for surgical treatment of degenerative myopia. American journal of ophthalmology, 1972. 74(2): p. 273.</ref> while others, like Curtin and Whitmore, expressed dissatisfaction with their negative conclusions.<ref name="curt">Curtin, B. and W. Whitmore, Long-term results of scleral reinforcement surgery. American journal of ophthalmology, 1987. 103(4): p. 544.</ref>

==Purpose==
The surgery aims to cover the thinning posterior pole with a supportive material to withstand [[intraocular pressure]] and prevent further progression of the posterior staphyloma.  The strain is reduced, although damage from the pathological process cannot be reversed.  By stopping the progression of the disease, vision may be maintained or improved.

==Methods of surgery==
There are three basic techniques, referred to as X-shaped, Y-shaped, and single strip support.<ref name="momo" />  In X-shaped and Y-shaped, the arms run the risk of the being pulled medially, which would press on the [[optic nerve]] and could result in optic nerve atrophy.  In single strip support, the material covers the posterior pole vertically between the optic nerve and insertion of the inferior oblique muscle.  Often, this method is preferred, since it is the easiest method for placement, provides the widest area of support, and reduces the risk of optic nerve interference.<ref name="Bores" />

==Materials==
Many different materials have been used in the past, including [[fascia lata]],<ref name="shev" /> [[Lyodura]] (lyophilized human dura),<ref name="momo" /> [[Gore-Tex]],<ref name="Bores" /> Zenoderm (porcine skin dermis),<ref name="gerinec">Gerinec, A., & Slezakova, G. (2001). Posterior scleroplasty in children with severe myopia. Bratisl Lek Listy, 102(2), 73-78.</ref> animal tendons, and donor's or cadaver’s sclera.<ref name="ccurtin" /><ref name="bala">Balashova, N., Ghaffariyeh, A., & Honarpisheh, N. (2010). Scleroplasty in progressive myopia. Eye.</ref><ref name="ward">Ward, B., Tarutta, E., & Mayer, M. (2009). The efficacy and safety of posterior pole buckles in the control of progressive high myopia. Eye, 23(12), 2169-2174.</ref> Human sclera is thought to offer the best support, as well as Lyodura, which is biologically compatible with the eyeball and has sufficient tensile strength.  Artificial materials, such as nylon or silicone, are not suggested.<ref name="momo" />  Sclera from cadaver’s or animal tendons run the risk of being rejected.

==Procedure==
While there have been many modifications, Thompson’s procedure has often been used as a basis.<ref name="thompson">Thompson, F., Scleral Reinforcement. Chapter 10., in Myopia Surgery. 1990, Macmillan: New York. p. 267-297.</ref>  First, the [[conjunctiva]] and [[Tenon's capsule]] are incised about 6&nbsp;mm from the [[corneal limbus]].  The [[lateral rectus muscle|lateral]], [[superior rectus muscle|superior]], and [[inferior rectus muscle|inferior]] recti muscles are separated using a [[strabismus hook]].  The connecting tissue is then separated from the posterior pole, as well as the inferior oblique muscle.  The strip of material is passed under the separated muscles, and pushed down deeply towards the posterior pole.  Both ends of the material strip are crossed over the medial rectus muscle and sutured to the sclera on the medial side of the superior and inferior recti muscles.  The conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule are then closed together.

==Complications==
Long-term complication rates are usually low, but short-term complications may include [[chemosis]], choroidal [[edema]] or [[hemorrhage]], damage to the vortex vein, and transient motility problems.<ref name="thompson" />

==Controversy==
Scleral reinforcement surgery is not presently popular in the United States, and there has been a scarcity of published clinical studies.  Donor sclera material is also difficult to acquire and store, and artificial materials are still being tested.  This procedure is much more popular in other countries, such as the former Soviet Union and Japan.<ref name="Bores" />
There is also controversy regarding in what developmental stage this procedure should be performed.<ref name="Bores" />  Some feel efforts should be made as soon as possible to arrest progression in children.  Others feel that the procedure should only be done in cases where high myopia is indicated with macular changes.  Furthermore, different surgeons have particular criteria that must be met by patients in order to receive surgery.
