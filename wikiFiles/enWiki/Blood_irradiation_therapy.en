'''Blood irradiation therapy''' is a procedure in which the blood is exposed to light (often [[laser]] light) for therapeutic reasons.  Most research on blood irradiation therapy has been conducted in Russia and China<ref name = Moshkovska>{{cite pmid | 15998818 }}</ref> and it is rarely used outside of those countries.  Its effectiveness and utility as a treatment has been questioned.  Blood irradiation therapy can be administered through a [[catheter]] in a [[vein]], through the blood vessels inside the nose or applied externally through the skin.  It is not related to the practice of [[Gamma ray|gamma]] irradiation of blood in [[transfusion medicine]].

==History==
Intravenous laser blood irradiation was developed experimentally by the Russian researchers, Meshalkin and
Sergievskiy, and introduced into clinical practice in 1981. Originally the method was applied in the treatment of cardiovascular abnormalities.<ref name = Moshkovska/><ref>Meshalkin E N, Sergievskii V S, Primenenie pryamogo lazernogo izlucheniya v eksperimental'noi i klinicheskoi meditsine (Application of Direct Laser Radiation in Experimental and Clinical Medicine), (Novosibirsk: Nauka), 1981</ref>

Laser blood irradiation therapy was government-certified in Germany in 2005. In the following two years, this method was established in more than 300 centers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Australia.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1078/0415-6412-00282}}</ref>

==Types==
===Intravenous===

[[Intravenous]] or intravascular blood irradiation involves the ''[[in-vivo]]'' illumination of the blood by feeding low level [[laser]] light generated by a 1–3&nbsp;mW [[helium–neon laser]] at a wavelength of 632.8&nbsp;nm into a vascular channel, usually a vein in the forearm, under the assumption that any therapeutic effect will be circulated through the [[circulatory system]].<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Weber | first = MH | coauthors = Fussgänger-May TW | year = 2007 | title = Intravenous laser blood irradiation | journal = German Journal of Acupuncture and related Techniques| volume = 50| issue = 3 | pages = 12–23 | doi=10.1078/0415-6412-00282}}</ref>  The feasibility of intravascular laser irradiation for therapy of cardiocirculatory diseases was first presented in the ''American Heart Journal'' in 1982.<ref>{{cite pmid | 7081024 }}</ref>  The technique was developed primarily in Asia (including Russia) and is not extensively used in other parts of the world.  It is claimed to improve blood flow and its transport activities, but has not been subject to [[randomized controlled trial]]s and is subject to skepticism.  While there have been some calls to increase research on this topic, others have called it "useless".<ref name = Moshkovska/>

Ultraviolet blood irradiation may also be applied, though it involves drawing blood out through a vein and irradiating it outside of the body.  Though promoted as a treatment for cancer, a 1952 review in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''<ref>{{Cite journal| journal = [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]| url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/summary/149/13/1180 | year = 1952 | title = Ultraviolet Irradiation of Blood in Man | last = Schwartz | first = SO | coauthors = Kaplan SR; Stengle J; Stevenson FL | volume = 149 | issue = 13 | pages = 1180–3 | pmid=14938136| doi = 10.1001/jama.1952.02930300006002}}</ref> and another review by the [[American Cancer Society]] in 1970 concluded the treatment was ineffective.<ref>{{cite doi | 10.3322/canjclin.20.4.248}}</ref> [[Stephen Barrett]], writing for [[Quackwatch]], lists ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy as a questionable treatment.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/treatmentindex.html | title = Index of Questionable Treatments | last = Barrett | first = S | authorlink = Stephen Barrett | date = 2010-06-23 | accessdate = 2010-07-23 | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] }}</ref>

===Intranasal===

Intranasal blood irradiation (also commonly known as "intranasal light therapy") involves the non-invasive irradiation of the nasal cavity by inserting a small light diode (usually red color either of low intensity laser or normal red light) to illuminate the nasal cavity walls. The microvascular blood vessel network in the nasal cavity is receptive to external stimulation which is then circulated in the body's circulatory system.{{cn|date=November 2012}}

===Transcutaneous===
Transcutaneous therapy applies laser light on unbroken skin in areas with large numbers of blood vessels (such as the forearm).  Because of the skin acting as a barrier to the blood, the power of the laser is often boosted to compensate.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Harrington, James; Li, Junheng |title=Biomedical optics and lasers: diagnostics and treatment: 16–18 September 1998, Beijing, China |publisher=SPIE |location=Bellingham, Washington |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-8194-3009-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
