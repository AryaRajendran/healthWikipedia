  Caption     = Close up of surgeons' hands in an operating room with a beam of light traveling along fiber optics for photodynamic therapy. Its source is a laser beam which is split at two different stages to create the proper therapeutic wavelength. A patient is given a photosensitive drug that is absorbed by cancer cells. During the surgery, the light beam is positioned at the tumor site, which then activates the drug that kills the cancer cells, thus photodynamic therapy (PDT). |

'''Photodynamic therapy''' ('''PDT''') is a form of [[phototherapy]] using nontoxic light-sensitive compounds that are exposed selectively to light, whereupon they become toxic to targeted malignant and other diseased cells. PDT has proven ability to kill microbial cells including bacteria, fungi and viruses. PDT is popularly used in treating acne. It is used clinically to treat a wide range of medical conditions, including [[macular degeneration#Wet_AMD|wet age-related macular degeneration]] and malignant [[cancers]],<ref name ="intro1">

</ref> and is recognised as a treatment strategy which is both minimally invasive and minimally toxic. 

Most modern PDT applications involve three key components:<ref name ="intro1" /> a [[photosensitizer]], a [[light source]] and tissue [[oxygen]]. The combination of these three components leads to the chemical destruction of any tissues which have either selectively taken up the photosensitizer or have been locally exposed to light. The wavelength of the light source needs to be appropriate for exciting the photosensitizer to produce [[reactive oxygen species]]. These reactive oxygen species generated through PDT are free radicals (Type I PDT) generated through electron abstraction or transfer from a substrate molecule and highly reactive state of oxygen known as [[singlet oxygen]] (Type II PDT). In understanding the mechanism of PDT it is important to distinguish it from other [[Light therapy|light-based and laser therapies]] such as laser wound healing and rejuvenation, or [[intense pulsed light]] hair removal, which do not require a photosensitizer.

==Procedure==
In order to achieve the selective destruction of the target area using PDT while leaving normal tissues untouched, either the photosensitizer can be applied locally to the target area or photosensitive targets can be locally excited with light. For instance, in the treatment of skin conditions, including [[acne]], [[psoriasis]], and also [[skin cancer]]s, the photosensitizer can be applied topically and locally excited by a light source. In the local treatment of internal tissues and cancers, after photosensitizers have been administered intravenously, light can be delivered to the target area using [[endoscopes]] and [[fiber optic]] [[catheters]] (see figure). 

Photosensitizers can also target many viral and microbial species, including [[HIV]] and [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]].<ref name="intro5">

===Photosensitizers===

In air and tissue, molecular oxygen occurs in a [[triplet state]], whereas almost all other molecules are in a singlet state. Reactions between these are [[Forbidden transition|forbidden by quantum mechanics]], thus oxygen is relatively non-reactive at physiological conditions. A photosensitizer is a chemical compound that can be promoted to an [[excited state]] upon absorption light and undergo intersystem crossing with oxygen to produce [[singlet oxygen]]. This species rapidly attacks any organic compounds it encounters, thus being highly [[cytotoxic]]. It is rapidly eliminated: in cells, the average lifetime is 3 µs.<ref>Lifetime and Diffusion of Singlet Oxygen in a Cell. Esben Skovsen, John W. Snyder, John D. C. Lambert, Peter R. Ogilby. The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2005 109 (18), 8570-8573. DOI: 10.1021/jp051163i</ref>

A wide array of photosensitizers for PDT exist. They can be divided into [[porphyrin]]s, [[chlorophyll]]s and [[dye]]s.<ref name=Allinson2004/> Some examples include [[aminolevulinic acid]] (ALA), Silicon Phthalocyanine Pc 4, [[Foscan|m-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin]] ([[mTHPC]]), and mono-L-aspartyl [[chlorin]] e6 ([[NPe6]]).  

Several photosensitizers are commercially available for clinical use, such as [[Allumera]], [[Photofrin]], [[Visudyne]], [[Levulan]], [[Foscan]], [[Metvix]], [[Hexvix]], [[Cysview]], and [[Laserphyrin]], with others in development, e.g. [[Antrin]], [[Photochlor]], [[Photosens]], [[Photrex]], [[Lumacan]], [[Cevira]], [[Visonac]], [[BF-200 ALA]].<ref name=Allinson2004>

The major difference between different types of photosensitizers is in the parts of the cell that they target.  Unlike in [[radiation therapy]], where damage is done by targeting cell DNA, most photosensitizers target other cell structures.  For example, mTHPC has been shown to localize in the nuclear envelope and do its damage there.<ref>

[[PUVA therapy]] is using [[psoralen]] as photosensitiser and UVA [[ultraviolet]] as light source, but this form of therapy is usually classified as a separate form of therapy from photodynamic therapy.<ref>{{cite pmid|16225614}}</ref><ref>[http://www.va.gov/hac/forbeneficiaries/champva/policymanual/champva/chapter2/1c2s30-11.htm Champva Policy Manual, Chapter: 2, Section: 30.11, Title: PDT (Photodynamic Therapy) and PUVA (Photochemotherapy)] at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

===Targeted PDT===
Some photosensitisers naturally accumulate in the [[endothelial cell]]s of [[vascular tissue]] allowing 'vascular targeted' PDT,

</ref> It was John Toth as product manager for Cooper Medical Devices Corp/Cooper Lasersonics with early clinical argon dye lasers ca 1981 who acknowledged the "photodynamic chemical effect" of the therapy and wrote the first "white paper" branding the therapy as "Photodynamic Therapy" (PDT) to support efforts in setting up 10 clinical sites in Japan where the term "radiation" had negative connotations. PDT received even greater interest as result of Thomas Dougherty helping expand clinical trials and forming the International Photodynamic Association, in 1986.

===PDT in ancient medicine===
The earliest recorded treatments that exploited a photosensitizer and a light source, in this case sunlight, for medical effect can be found in ancient Egyptian and Indian sources. Annals over 3000 years old report the use of topically applied vegetable and plant substances to produce photoreactions in skin and cause a repigmentation of depigimented skin lesions, as seen with [[vitiligo]] and [[leukoderma]]. 

The photosensitizing agents used in these ancient therapies have been characterised with modern science as belonging to the [[psoralen]] family of chemicals. Psoralens are still in use today in PDT regimes to treat a variety of skin conditions, including vitiligo, [[psoriasis]], [[neurodermitis]], [[eczema]], [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]] and [[lichen ruber planus]].<ref>

===20th century development of PDT===
The first detailed scientific evidence that agents, photosensitive synthetic dyes, in combination with a light source and oxygen could have potential therapeutic effect was made at the turn of the 20th century in the laboratory of von Tappeiner in Munich, Germany. Historically this was a time when Germany was leading the world in the industrial synthesis of dyes. 

While studying the effects of [[acridine]] on [[paramecia]] cultures, Oscar Raab, a student of von Tappeiner observed a toxic effect. Fortuitously Raab also observed that light was dependent for the killing of paramecia cultures to take place.<ref>

With the discovery of photodynamic effects, von Tappeiner and colleagues went on to perform the first PDT trial in patients with skin carcinoma using the photosensitizer, [[eosin]], Out of 6 patients with a facial basal cell carcinoma, treated with a 1% eosin solution and a long-term exposure either to sunlight or to arc-lamp light, 4 patients showed total tumour resolution and a relapse-free period of 12 months.<ref>

As its name suggests, HpD is a porphyrin species derived from haematoporphyrin, Porphyrins have long been considered as suitable agents for tumour photodiagnosis and tumour PDT because cancerous cells exhibit a significantly greater uptake and affinity for porphyrins compared to normal quiescent tissues. This important observation, which underlies the success of PDT to treat cancers, had been established by a number of scientific researchers prior to the discoveries made by Lipson. In 1924, Policard first revealed the diagnostic capabilities of hematoporphyrin fluorescence when he observed that ultraviolet radiation excited red fluorescence in the sarcomas of laboratory rats.<ref>

</ref> showed on laboratory animals that porphyrins exhibit a preferential affinity to rapidly dividing cells, including malignant, embryonic, and regenerative cells, and because of this, they proposed that porphyrins should be used in the treatment of cancer. Subsequently many scientific authors have repeated the observation that cancerous cells naturally accumulate porphyrins and have characterised a number of mechanisms to explain it.

HpD, under the pharmaceutical name [[Photofrin]], was the first PDT agent approved for clinical use in 1993 to treat a form of bladder cancer in Canada. Over the next decade, both PDT and the use of HpD received wider international attention and grew in their clinical use, and lead to the first PDT treatments to receive U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approval.

===Modern development of PDT in Russia===

Of all the nations beginning to use PDT in the late 20th century, the Russians were the quickest to advance its use clinically and to make many developments.  One early Russian development was a new photosensitizer called Photogem which, like HpD, was derived from haematoporphyrin in 1990 by Professor Andrey F. Mironov and coworkers in Moscow. Photogem was approved by the Ministry of Health of Russia and tested clinically from February 1992 to 1996. A pronounced therapeutic effect was observed in 91 percent of the 1500 patients that underwent PDT using Photogem, with 62 percent having a total tumor resolution. Of the remaining patients, a further 29 percent had a partial tumor resolution, where the tumour at least halved in size. In those patients that had been diagnosed early, 92 percent of the patients showed complete resolution of the tumour.<ref name="magicray">

Around this time, Russian scientists also collaborated with NASA medical scientists who were looking at the use of LEDs as more suitable light sources, compared to lasers, for PDT applications.<ref>

===Modern development of PDT in Asia===
PDT has also seen considerably development in Asia. Since 1990, the Chinese have been developing specialist clinical expertise with PDT using their own domestically produced photosensitizers, derived from Haematoporphyrin, and light sources.<ref>
