'''Pacemaker syndrome''' is a disease that represents the clinical consequences of suboptimal [[Atrioventricular node|atrioventricular]] (AV) [[synchrony]] or [[Ventricular dyssynchrony|AV dyssynchrony]], regardless of the pacing mode, after the [[Artificial pacemaker#Insertion|pacemaker plantation]].<ref name="pmid9164889">{{cite journal |author=Ellenbogen KA, Gilligan DM, Wood MA, Morillo C, Barold SS |title=The pacemaker syndrome -- a matter of definition |journal=Am.

Individuals with a low heart rate prior to pacemaker implantation are more at risk of developing pacemaker syndrome. Normally the first chamber of the heart (atrium) contracts as the second chamber (ventricle) is relaxed, allowing the ventricle to fill before it contracts and pumps blood out of the heart. When the timing between the two chambers goes out of synchronization, less blood is delivered on each beat. Patients who develop pacemaker syndrome may require adjustment of the pacemaker timing, or another lead fitted to regulate the timing of the chambers separately.

==Signs and symptoms==
No specific set of criteria has been developed for [[diagnosis]] of [[pacemaker]] [[syndrome]]. Most of the signs and [[symptoms]] of pacemaker syndrome are nonspecific, and many are prevalent in the elderly population at baseline. In the lab, pacemaker interrogation plays a crucial role in determining if the pacemaker mode had any contribution to symptoms.<ref name="pmid7511223"/><ref name="pmid6184693">{{cite journal |author=Nishimura RA, Gersh BJ, Vlietstra RE, Osborn MJ, [[Duane Ilstrup|Ilstrup DM]], Holmes DR |title=Hemodynamic and symptomatic consequences of ventricular pacing |journal=Pacing Clin Electrophysiol |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=903–10 |year=1982 |month=November |pmid=6184693 }}</ref><ref name="pmid2316455">{{cite journal |author=Santini M, Alexidou G, Ansalone G, Cacciatore G, Cini R, Turitto G |title=Relation of prognosis in sick sinus syndrome to age, conduction defects and modes of permanent cardiac pacing |journal=Am.

==Causes==

The [[etiology]] is poorly understood. However several [[risk factors]] are associated with pacemaker syndrome.<ref name="pmid7511223"/><ref name="pmid2032410"/>

===Risk factors===

*In the [[implant (medicine)|preimplantation]] period, two variables are predicted to predispose to the syndrome. First is low [[sinus node|sinus rate]], and second is a higher programmed lower rate limit. In [[implant (medicine)|postimplantation]], an increased percentage of [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] paced beats is the only variable that significantly predicts development of pacemaker syndrome.<ref name="pmid2032410"/>
*Patients with intact [[VA conduction]] are at greater risk for developing pacemaker syndrome. Around 90% of patients with preserved AV conduction have intact [[VA conduction]], and about 30-40% of patients with complete [[Atrioventricular block|AV block]] have preserved [[VA conduction]]. Intact [[VA conduction]] may not be apparent at the time of pacemaker implantation or even may develop at any time after implantation.<ref name="pmid12555483" /><ref name="pmid7511223"/><ref name="pmid2032410"/><ref name="pmid1704534">{{cite journal |author=Heldman D, Mulvihill D, Nguyen H, ''et al.'' |title=True incidence of pacemaker syndrome |journal=Pacing Clin Electrophysiol |volume=13 |issue=12 Pt 2 |pages=1742–50 |year=1990 |month=December |pmid=1704534 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-8159.1990.tb06883.x }}</ref>
*Patients with noncompliant [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] and [[diastolic]] dysfunction are particularly sensitive to loss of [[atrial]] contribution to ventricular filling, where that highly increase the chance of developing the syndrome. This includes patients with [[cardiomyopathy]] ([[hypertensive cardiomyopathy|hypertensive]], [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|hypertrophic]], [[restrictive cardiomyopathy|restrictive]]) and elderly individuals.<ref name="pmid7511223"/><ref name="pmid2316455"/><ref name="pmid2032410"/><ref name="pmid1442632"/>
*Other factors correlated with development of pacemaker syndrome include decreased [[stroke volume]], decreased [[cardiac output]], and decreased [[left atrium|left atrial]] total emptying fraction associated with [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] pacing.<ref name="pmid7511223"/><ref name="pmid2032410"/>

==Pathophysiology==
The loss of [[physiology|physiologic]] timing of [[atrium (heart)|atrial]] and [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] contractions, or sometimes called AV dyssynchrony, leads to different mechanisms of [[symptom]]s production. This altered ventricular contraction will decrease [[cardiac output]], and in turn will lead to systemic hypotensive reflex response with varying symptoms.<ref name="pmid9164889">{{cite journal |author=Ellenbogen KA, Gilligan DM, Wood MA, Morillo C, Barold SS |title=The pacemaker syndrome—a matter of definition |journal=Am. J. Cardiol. |volume=79 |issue=9 |pages=1226–9 |year=1997 |month=May |pmid=9164889 |doi= 10.1016/S0002-9149(97)00085-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002914997000854}}</ref><ref name="pmid12555483" /><ref name="pmid7821326"/><ref name="pmid7511223"/>

===Loss of atrial contraction===
Inappropriate pacing in patients with decreased [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] compliance, which may be caused by diseases such as [[hypertensive heart disease|hypertensive cardiomyopathy]], [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], [[restrictive cardiomyopathy]], and aging, can result in loss of [[atrium (heart)|atrial]] contraction and significantly reduces [[cardiac output]]. Because in such cases the atrias are required to provide 50% of [[cardiac output]], which normally provides only 15% - 25% of [[cardiac output]].<ref name="pmid1413181">{{cite journal |author=Petersen HH, Videbaek J |title=[The pacemaker syndrome] |language=Danish |journal=Ugeskr. Laeg. |volume=154 |issue=38 |pages=2547–51 |year=1992 |month=September |pmid=1413181 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid1442632">{{cite journal |author=Gross JN, Keltz TN, Cooper JA, Breitbart S, Furman S |title=Profound "pacemaker syndrome" in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy |journal=Am.

===Cannon A waves===
{{main|Cannon A waves}}

[[Atrium (heart)|Atrial]] contraction against a closed [[tricuspid valve]] can cause pulsation in the neck and [[abdomen]], [[headache]], [[cough]], and jaw pain.<ref name="pmid1413181" /><ref name="pmid2032410">{{cite journal |author=Schüller H, Brandt J |title=The pacemaker syndrome: old and new causes |journal=Clin Cardiol |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=336–40 |year=1991 |month=April |pmid=2032410 |doi=10.1002/clc.4960140410 }}</ref>

===Increased atrial pressure===
[[ventricle (heart)|Ventricular]] pacing is associated with elevated [[right atrium|right]] and [[left atrium|left atrial]] pressures, as well as elevated [[pulmonary vein|pulmonary venous]] and [[pulmonary artery|pulmonary arterial]] pressures, which can lead to [[symptom]]atic [[pulmonary edema|pulmonary]] and [[liver|hepatic]] [[wiktionary:congestion|congestion]].<ref name="pmid7511223"/>

===Increased production of natriuretic peptides===
{{main|atrial natriuretic peptide}}

{{main|brain natriuretic peptide}}

Patients with [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] [[syndrome]] exhibit increased plasma levels of [[atrial natriuretic peptide|ANP]]. That's due to increase in [[left atrium|left atrial]] pressure and [[left ventricle|left ventricular]] filling pressure, which is due to decreased [[cardiac output]] caused by dyssynchrony in [[atrium (heart)|atrial]] and [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] contraction. [[atrial natriuretic peptide|ANP]] and [[brain natriuretic peptide|BNP]] are potent [[artery|arterial]] and [[vein|venous]] [[vasodilation|vasodilators]] that can override [[common carotid artery|carotid]] and [[aorta|aortic]] [[baroreflex|baroreceptor reflex]]es attempting to compensate for decreased [[blood pressure]]. Usually patients with [[cannon A waves|cannon a waves]] have higher plasma levels of [[atrial natriuretic peptide|ANP]] than those without [[cannon A waves|cannon a waves]].<ref name="pmid9164889"/><ref name="pmid9036762">{{cite journal |author=Theodorakis GN, Panou F, Markianos M, Fragakis N, Livanis EG, Kremastinos DT |title=Left atrial function and atrial natriuretic factor/cyclic guanosine monophosphate changes in DDD and VVI pacing modes |journal=Am.

===VA conduction===
{{main|VA conduction}}

A major cause of AV dyssynchrony is [[VA conduction]]. VA conduction, sometimes referred to as retrograde conduction, leads to delayed, nonphysiologic timing of [[atrium (heart)|atrial]] contraction in relation to [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] [[muscle contraction|contraction]]. Nevertheless, many conditions other than VA conduction promote AV dyssynchrony.<ref name="pmid9164889"/><ref name="pmid12555483" /><ref name="pmid7821326"/><ref name="pmid1413181" /><ref name="pmid2032410"/>

This will further decrease [[blood pressure]], and secondary increase in [[atrial natriuretic peptide|ANP]] and [[brain natriuretic peptide|BNP]].<ref name="pmid9036762"/><ref name="pmid1334465"/>

==Prevention==

At the time of pacemaker [[Implant (medicine)|implantation]], AV synchrony should be optimized to prevent the occurrence of [[pacemaker]] [[syndrome]]. Where patients with optimized AV synchrony have shown great results of [[Implant (medicine)|implantation]] and very low [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of pacemaker syndrome than those with suboptimal AV synchronization.<ref name="pmid9164889"/><ref name="pmid7821326"/><ref name="pmid7511223"/>

==Treatment==

===Diet===
Diet alone cannot treat pacemaker syndrome, but an appropriate diet to the patient, in addition to the other treatment regimens mentioned, can improve the patient's symptoms. Several cases mentioned below:
 
*For patients with [[heart failure]], [[Low sodium diet|low-salt diet]] is indicated.<ref name="urlPacemaker Syndrome: Treatment & Medication - eMedicine Cardiology">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/159706-treatment |title=Pacemaker Syndrome: Treatment & Medication - eMedicine Cardiology }}</ref>
*For patients with [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] insufficiency, a high-salt [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] may be appropriate.<ref name="urlPacemaker Syndrome: Treatment & Medication - eMedicine Cardiology"/>
*For patients with [[dehydration]], [[oral administration|oral]] [[Fluid replacement|fluid rehydration]] is needed.<ref name="urlPacemaker Syndrome: Treatment & Medication - eMedicine Cardiology"/>

===Medication===
No specific [[drugs]] are used to treat pacemaker syndrome directly because treatment consists of upgrading or reprogramming the pacemaker.<ref name="urlPacemaker Syndrome: Treatment & Medication - eMedicine Cardiology"/>

===Medical Care===
*For some patients who are [[ventricle (heart)|ventricularly]] paced, usually the addition of an [[atrial]] lead and optimizing the AV synchrony usually resolves [[symptoms]].<ref name="pmid9164889"/><ref name="pmid7821326"/><ref name="pmid1413181" /><ref name="pmid2032410"/>
*In patients with other pacing modes, other than ventricular pacing, symptoms usually resolve after adjusting and reprogramming of [[pacemaker]] [[parameters]], such as tuning the AV delay, changing the [[ventricle (heart)|postventricular]] [[atrial]] [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], the sensing level, and pacing [[threshold voltage]]. The [[optimal value]]s of these parameters for each individual differ. So, achieving the [[optimal value]]s is by experimenting with successive reprogramming and measurement of [[wikt:relevant|relevant]] parameters, such as [[blood pressure]], [[cardiac output]], and [[total peripheral resistance]], as well as observations of [[symptoms|symptomatology]].<ref name="pmid9164889"/><ref name="pmid7821326"/><ref name="pmid1413181" /><ref name="pmid2032410"/>
*In rare instances, using [[hysteresis]] to help maintain AV synchrony can help alleviate symptoms in [[ventricle (heart)|ventricularly]] inhibited paced (VVI) patients providing they have intact sinus node function. Hysteresis reduces the amount of time spent in pacing mode, which can relieve [[symptoms]], particularly when the pacing mode is generating AV dyssynchrony.<ref name="pmid7821326"/><ref name="pmid2032410"/>
*If symptoms persist after all these treatment modalities, replacing the [[pacemaker]] itself is sometimes beneficial and can alleviate [[symptoms]].<ref name="pmid9164889"/><ref name="pmid7821326"/><ref name="pmid1413181" />
*[[Medical care]] includes supportive treatment, in case any of the following complications happen, medical team should be ready. Possible complications include [[heart failure]], [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], [[tachypnea]], and [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] deficit.<ref name="pmid9164889"/><ref name="pmid6184693"/><ref name="pmid1413181" />

===Surgical Care===
Sometimes [[surgery|surgical]] intervention is needed. After consulting an [[electrophysiologist]], possibly an additional [[pacemaker]] lead placement is needed, which eventually relieve some of the symptoms.<ref name="pmid9164889"/><ref name="pmid7821326"/>

== Complications ==
Studies have shown that patients with Pacemaker syndrome and/or with [[sick sinus syndrome]] are at higher risk of developing fatal [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] that calls for the patients to be carefully monitored in the [[intensive care unit|ICU]]. Complications include [[atrial fibrillation]], [[thrombo-embolic disease|thrombo-embolic events]], and [[heart failure]].<ref name="pmid2316455"/>

== Epidemiology ==
The reported [[wikt:incidence|incidence]] of pacemaker syndrome has ranged from 2%<ref name="pmid7983951">{{cite journal |author=Andersen HR, Thuesen L, Bagger JP, Vesterlund T, Thomsen PE |title=Prospective randomised trial of atrial versus ventricular pacing in sick-sinus syndrome |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=344 |issue=8936 |pages=1523–8 |year=1994 |month=December |pmid=7983951 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90347-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(94)90347-6 |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> to 83%.<ref name="pmid1704534">{{cite journal |author=Heldman D, Mulvihill D, Nguyen H, ''et al.'' |title=True incidence of pacemaker syndrome |journal=[[Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology : PACE]] |volume=13 |issue=12 Pt 2 |pages=1742–50 |year=1990 |month=December |pmid=1704534 |doi= 10.1111/j.1540-8159.1990.tb06883.x|url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> The wide range of reported incidence is likely attributable to two factors which are the criteria used to define pacemaker syndrome and the therapy used to resolve that diagnosis.<ref name="pmid16943933">{{cite journal |author=Farmer DM, Estes NA, Link MS |title=New concepts in pacemaker syndrome |journal=[[Indian Pacing and Electrophysiology Journal]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=195–200 |year=2004 |pmid=16943933 |pmc=1502063 |doi= |url=http://www.ipej.org/4/195 |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref>
