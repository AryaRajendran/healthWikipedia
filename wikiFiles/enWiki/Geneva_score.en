The '''Geneva score''' is a [[clinical prediction rule]] used in determining the pre-test probability of [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE) based on a patient's risk factors and clinical findings.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wicki J, Perneger TV, Junod AF, Bounameaux H, Perrier A |title=Assessing clinical probability of pulmonary embolism in the emergency ward: a simple score |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=161 |issue=1 |pages=92–7 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11146703 |doi=10.1001/archinte.161.1.92}}</ref> It has been shown to be as accurate as the [[Pulmonary embolism#Diagnosis|Wells Score]], and is less reliant on the experience of the doctor applying the rule.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iles S, Hodges AM, Darley JR, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical experience and pre-test probability scores in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism |journal=QJM |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=211–5 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12615985 |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcg027}}</ref> The Geneva score has been revised and simplified from its original version.

==Original Geneva Score==
The original Geneva score is calculated using 7 risk factors and clinical variables:
{| class=wikitable border=1
!Variable
!Score
|-
!colspan=2|Age
|-
|60–79 years
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
|80+ years
|style="text-align:center"|2
|-
!colspan=2|Previous venous thromboembolism
|-
|Previous DVT or PE
|style="text-align:center"|2
|-
!colspan=2|Previous surgery
|-
|Recent surgery within 4 weeks
|style="text-align:center"|3
|-
!colspan=2|Heart rate
|-
|Heart rate >100 beats per minute
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
!colspan=2|PaCO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in arterial blood)
|-
|<35mmHg
|style="text-align:center"|2
|-
|35-39mmHg
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
!colspan=2|PaO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> in arterial blood)
|-
|<49mmHg
|style="text-align:center"|4
|-
|49-59mmHg
|style="text-align:center"|3
|-
|60-71mmHg
|style="text-align:center"|2
|-
|72-82mmHg
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
!colspan=2|Chest X-ray findings
|-
|Band atelectasis
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
|Elevation of hemidiaphragm
|style="text-align:center"|1
|}
The score obtained relates to the probability of the patient having had a pulmonary embolism (the lower the score, the lower the probability):

* <5 points indicates a low probability of PE

* 5 - 8 points indicates a moderate probability of PE

* >8 points indicates a high probability of PE
==Revised Geneva Score==
More recently, the '''revised Geneva score''' has been introduced.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Le Gal G, Righini M, Roy PM, ''et al.'' |title=Prediction of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department: the revised Geneva score |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=144 |issue=3 |pages=165–71 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16461960}}</ref> This simplifies the scoring process, and has also been shown to be as effective as the Wells score.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Righini M, Le Gal G, Aujesky D, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by multidetector CT alone or combined with venous ultrasonography of the leg: a randomised non-inferiority trial |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9621 |pages=1343–52 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18424324 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60594-2}}</ref>

The revised score uses 8 parameters, but does not include figures which require an [[Arterial blood gas sampling|arterial blood gas sample]] to be performed:
{| class=wikitable border=1
!Variable
!Score
|-
|Age 65 years or over
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
|Previous DVT or PE
|style="text-align:center"|3
|-
|Surgery or fracture within 1 month
|style="text-align:center"|2
|-
|Active malignant condition
|style="text-align:center"|2
|-
|Unilateral lower limb pain
|style="text-align:center"|3
|-
|Haemoptysis
|style="text-align:center"|2
|-
|Heart rate 75 to 94 beats per minute
|style="text-align:center"|3
|-
|Heart rate 95 or more beats per minute
|style="text-align:center"|5
|-
|Pain on deep palpation of lower limb and unilateral oedema
|style="text-align:center"|4
|}
The score obtained relates to probability of PE:

* 0 - 3 points indicates low probability (8%)

* 4 - 10 points indicates intermediate probability (28%)

* 11 points or more indicates high probability (74%)

The probabilities derived from the scoring systems can be used to determine the need for, and nature of, further investigations such as [[D-dimer]], [[ventilation/perfusion scan]]ning and [[CT pulmonary angiogram|CT pulmonary angiography]] to confirm or refute the diagnosis of PE.

==Simplified Geneva Score==
A newer revision referred to as the simplified revised Geneva score has been prospectively studied and reported in the [[Archives of Internal Medicine]] on October 27 of 2008. The simplified scoring system replaced the weighted scores for each parameter with a 1 point score for each parameter present to reduce the likelihood of error when the score is used in a clinical setting. The report noted that the simplified Geneva score does not lead to a decrease in diagnostic utility in evaluating patients for a PE when compared to previous Geneva scores.<ref name="Simplification of the revised Geneva score for assessing clinical probability of pulmonary embolism"/>

The simplified Geneva score:
{| class=wikitable border=1

|Previous DVT or PE
|style="text-align:center"|1

|-
|Active malignancy

|-
|Unilateral lower limb pain
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
|Hemoptysis
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
|Pain on deep vein palpation of lower limb and unilateral edema
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
|Heart rate 75 to 94 bpm
|style="text-align:center"|1
|-
|Heart rate greater than 94 bpm*
|style="text-align:center"|<nowiki>+1</nowiki>
|-
|colspan=2|<nowiki>*</nowiki> <span style="font-size:85%">Heart rates of 75 to 94 bpm receive 1 point, while heart rates higher than 94bpm receive a further point (i.e. 2 points in total)</span>
|}

Patients with a score of 2 or less are considered unlikely to have a current PE. Authors suggest that the likelihood of patients having a PE with a simplified Geneva score less than 2 and a normal D-Dimer is 3 percent.<ref name="Geneva Scoring for Pulmonary Embolism Simplified Further">{{cite web |url=http://firstwatch.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2008/1029/1 |title=Geneva Scoring for Pulmonary Embolism Simplified Further.
