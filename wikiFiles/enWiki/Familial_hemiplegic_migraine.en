{{Migraine}}
'''Familial hemiplegic migraine''' (FHM) is an [[autosomal dominant]] classical [[migraine]] subtype that typically includes [[hemiparesis]] (weakness of half the body) during the [[Aura (symptom)|aura]] phase. It can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as [[ataxia]], [[coma]] and epileptic [[seizure]]s. There is clinical overlap in some FHM patients with [[episodic ataxia]] type 2 and [[spinocerebellar ataxia]] type 6, [[benign familial infantile epilepsy]], and [[alternating hemiplegia of childhood]]. There are 3 known [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] for FHM. FHM1, which accounts for approximately 50% of FHM patients, is caused by mutations in a gene coding for the P/Q-type [[calcium channel]] α subunit, CACNA1A. FHM1 is also associated with cerebellar degeneration. FHM2, which accounts for <25% of FHM cases, is caused by mutations in the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|{{chem|Na|+}}/{{chem|K|+}}-ATPase]] gene ATP1A2. FHM3 is a rare subtype of FHM and is caused by mutations in a [[sodium channel]] α-subunit coding gene, SCNA1. These three subtypes do not account for all cases of FHM, suggesting the existence of at least one other locus (FHM4). Many of the non-familial cases of hemiplegic migraine (sporadic hemiplegic migraine) are also caused by mutations at these loci. A fourth gene that has been associated with this codition is the proline rich transmembrane protein 2 ([[PRRT2]]) - an [[axon]]al protein associated with the [[exocytosis]] complex.<ref name=Ducros2013>{{cite journal|last=Ducros|first=A|title=[Genetics of migraine.]|journal=Revue neurologique|date=2013 Apr 22|pmid=23618705}}</ref>  Afifth gene assocoated with this codition is [[SLC4A4]] which encodes the electrogenic NaHCO3cotransporter NBCe1.<ref name=Suzuki2010>Suzuki M, Van Paesschen W, Stalmans I, Horita S, Yamada H, Bergmans BA, Legius E, Riant F et al. (2010). Defective membrane expression of the Na+-HCO3- cotransporter NBCe1 is associated with familial migraine. Proc Nat Acad Sci 107 (36): 15963–15968. doi:10.1073/pnas.1008705107</ref> 

==Classification==
FHM can be loosely divided into two categories: with and without cerebellar signs. Cerebellar signs refer to [[ataxia]], sometimes episodic and other times progressive, that can accompany FHM1 mutations and is caused by degeneration of the [[cerebellum]]. These cerebellar signs result in a [[phenotype|phenotypic]] overlap between FHM and both [[episodic ataxia]] and [[spinocerebellar ataxia]]. This is unsurprising as subtypes of these disorders (FHM1, EA2 and SCA6) are allelic, i.e., they result from mutations in the same gene. The other forms of FHM seem to be distinguishable only on the basis of their genetic cause.

There are also non-familial cases of hemiplegic migraine, termed sporadic hemiplegic migraine. These cases seem to have the same causes as the familial cases and represent [[de novo mutation]]s. Sporadic cases are also clinically identical to familial cases with the exception of a lack of family history of attacks.

==Signs and symptoms==
FHM signs overlap significantly with those of [[migraine with aura]]. In short, FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with [[hemiparesis]] and, in FHM1, [[cerebellum|cerebellar]] degeneration. This cerebellar degeneration can result in episodic or progressive [[ataxia]]. FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile [[convulsion]]s (BFIC) and [[alternating hemiplegia of childhood]]. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] and [[coma]]. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes. These signs typically first manifest themselves in the first or second decade of life.

==Causes==
''See the equivalent section in the main [[Migraine#Pathophysiology|migraine article]].''

It is believed that FHM mutations lead to migraine susceptibility by lowering the threshold for cortical-spreading-depression generation. The FHM1 and FHM3 mutations occur in [[ion channel]]s expressed in [[neuron]]s. These mutations may lead to both the hyper and hypoexcitable neurons that might underlie cortical-spreading-depression. It is even less clear how the mutations seen in FHM2 patients might lead to FHM symptoms as the gene mutated in FHM2 is expressed primarily in [[astrocyte]]s. One proposal states that the depolarization of astrocytes caused by [[haploinsufficiency]] of the ATP1A2 [[Na+/K+-ATPase|{{chem|Na|+}}/{{chem|K|+}}-ATPase]] causes increased release of compounds such as [[adenosine]] from astrocytes. These compounds then interact with neighboring neurons, altering their excitability and leading to cortical-spreading-depression and migraine.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of FHM is made according to the following criteria:
*Two attacks of each of the following:
:*[[Aura (symptom)|Aura]] with motor weakness accompanied by either reversible visual symptoms (flickering lights, spots, lines, etc.), reversible sensory symptoms (pins and needles, numbness, etc.) or speech symptoms.
:*At least two occurrences of:
::*One or more [[Aura (symptom)|aura]] symptoms that develop over at least 5 minutes
::*These symptoms lasting more than 5 minutes and less than 24 hours
::*Headache beginning within 60 minutes of aura onset. These headaches can last 4–72 hours, occur on only one side of the head, pulsate, be of moderate to severe intensity, and may be aggravated by common physical activities such as walking. These headaches must also be accompanied by [[nausea]]/vomiting, [[phonophobia]] (avoidance of sound due to hypersensitivity) and/or [[photophobia]] (avoidance of light due to hypersensitivity).
*At least one close (first or second degree) relative with FHM
*No other likely cause

Sporadic forms follow the same diagnostic criteria, with the exception of family history.

In all cases, family and patient history is used for diagnosis. [[EEG]] and brain imaging techniques, such as [[MRI]], [[CAT scan]]s and [[SPECT]],<ref name="Arias_2012">{{cite journal | author = Arias-Rivas S, Rodríguez-Yañez M, Cortés J, Pardo-Parrado M, Aguiar P, Leira R, Castillo J, Blanco M | title = Familial hemiplegic migraine with prolonged global aura: follow-up findings of subtraction ictal SPECT co-registered to MRI (SISCOM) | journal = Cephalalgia | volume = 32 | issue = 13 | pages = 1013–1014 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22933508}}</ref> are used to rule out epilepsy and to test for cerebellar degeneration, respectively. With the discovery of causative genes, genetic sequencing can also be used to verify diagnosis (though not all genetic [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] are known).

==Pathophysiology==

===FHM1 (CACNA1A)===
The first discovered FHM [[locus (genetics)|locus]] was the CACNA1A gene (originally named CACNL1A4), which encodes the P/Q-type [[calcium channel]] Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1. There are currently 17 known [[mutation]]s in this channel, see Table 1, and these mutations are distributed throughout the channel. Some of these mutations result in patients with notable cerebellar degeneration or other dysfunction. 15 of these mutants have received at least some further analysis at the [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] level to attempt to determine how they might lead to the FHM1 phenotype. There is increasing contradiction in the literature as to the end result of these mutations on channel kinetics and neuronal excitability.

A good example of this contradiction can be seen in the literature regarding the R192Q mutation.<ref name="Ophoff_1996">{{cite journal | author = Ophoff R, Terwindt G, Vergouwe M, van Eijk R, Oefner P, Hoffman S, Lamerdin J, Mohrenweiser H, Bulman D, Ferrari M, Haan J, Lindhout D, van Ommen G, Hofker M, Ferrari M, Frants R | title = Familial hemiplegic migraine and episodic ataxia type-2 are caused by mutations in the {{chem|Ca|2+}} channel gene CACNL1A4. | journal = Cell | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 543–52 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8898206 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81373-2}}</ref> The first investigation of this mutation, using the [[rabbit]] [[isoform]] of the channel expressed in [[oocyte]]s, found that it did not alter any measured channel properties.<ref name="Kraus_1998">{{cite journal | author = Kraus R, Sinnegger M, Glossmann H, Hering S, Striessnig J | title = Familial hemiplegic migraine mutations change alpha1A {{chem|Ca|2+}} channel kinetics. | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 273 | issue = 10 | pages = 5586–90 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9488686 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.10.5586}}</ref> A subsequent report, using human channels expressed in [[HEK293 Cells]], found a small hyperpolarizing shift in the midpoint for activation, a result common among FHM1 mutants.<ref name="Hans_1999">{{cite journal | author = Hans M, Luvisetto S, Williams M, Spagnolo M, Urrutia A, Tottene A, Brust P, Johnson E, Harpold M, Stauderman K, Pietrobon D | title = Functional consequences of mutations in the human alpha1A calcium channel subunit linked to familial hemiplegic migraine. | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 1610–9 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10024348}}</ref> This shift results in channels that open at more negative potentials and, thus, have a higher open probability than wild-type channels at most potentials. This report also found that the R192Q mutant produced almost twice as much whole-cell current compared to wild-type channels. This is not due to a change in single channel conductance but to an equivalent increase in channel density. A subsequent group noticed that this mutation is in a region important for modulation by [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s (GPCRs).<ref name="Melliti_2003">{{cite journal | author = Melliti K, Grabner M, Seabrook G | title = The familial hemiplegic migraine mutation R192q reduces G-protein-mediated inhibition of p/q-type (Cav2.1) calcium channels expressed in human embryonic kidney cells | journal = J Physiol | volume = 546 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 337–47 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12527722 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2002.026716 | pmc = 2342512}}</ref> GPCR activation leads to inhibition of wild-type Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 currents. R192Q mutant channel currents are also decreased by GPCR activation, but by a smaller amount. A more recent group has confirmed some of these results by creating a R192Q [[knockin mouse|knock-in mouse]].<ref name="Maagdenberg_2004">{{cite journal | author = van den Maagdenberg A, Pietrobon D, Pizzorusso T, Kaja S, Broos L, Cesetti T, van de Ven R, Tottene A, van der Kaa J, Plomp J, Frants R, Ferrari M | title = A Cacna1a knockin migraine mouse model with increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression | journal = Neuron | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 701–10 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15003170 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(04)00085-6}}</ref> They confirmed that the R192Q mutant activates at more negative potentials and that neurons producing these channels have much larger whole-cell current. This resulted in a much larger quantal content (the number of [[neurotransmitter]] packets released per [[action potential]]) and generally enhanced neurotransmitter release in R192Q expressing neurons versus wild-type. Consequently, these mutant mice were more susceptible to cortical-spreading-depression than their wild-type counterparts. The most recent experiments on this mutant, however, have contradicted some of these results.<ref name="Cao_2005">{{cite journal | author = Cao Y, Tsien R | title = Effects of familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mutations on neuronal P/Q-type {{chem|Ca|2+}} channel activity and inhibitory synaptic transmission | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 102 | issue = 7 | pages = 2590–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15699344 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409896102 | pmc = 548328}}</ref> In Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 [[Gene knockout|knockout]] [[neuron]]s transfected with human channels, P/Q-type currents from mutant channels are actually smaller than their wild-type counterpart. They also found a significant decrease in [[calcium]] influx during depolarization, leading to decreased quantal content, in mutant versus wild-type expressing neurons. Neurons expressing mutant channels were also less able to mediate inhibitory input and have smaller [[inhibitory postsynaptic current]]s through P/Q-type channels. Further testing with this and other mutants is required to determine their end affect on human physiology.

===FHM2 (ATP1A2)===
[[Image:ATP1A2 structure with FHM2 mutations.png|right|thumb|The crystal structure of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|{{chem|Na|+}}/{{chem|K|+}}-ATPase]] with FHM2 mutations noted in purple. The N-terminus is colored blue and the C-terminus red. The approximate location of the cell membrane is noted. The original pdb file is available [http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1SU4 here].]]
The second subtype of familial hemiplegic migraine, FHM2, is caused by mutations in the gene ATP1A2 that encodes a [[Na+/K+-ATPase|{{chem|Na|+}}/{{chem|K|+}}-ATPase]]. This {{chem|Na|+}}/{{chem|K|+}}-ATPase is heavily expressed in [[astrocyte]]s and helps to set and maintain their reversal potential. There are 29 known mutations in this gene associated with FHM2, Table 2, many clustering in the large intracellular loop between membrane-spanning segments 4 and 5, Figure 1. 12 of these mutations have been studied by expression in model cells. All but one have shown either complete loss of function or more complex decreases in ATPase activity or potassium sensitivity. Astrocytes expressing these mutant [[Ion transporter|ion pump]]s will have much higher resting potentials and are believed to lead to disease through a poorly understood mechanism.

===FHM3 (SCN1A)===
The final known [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] for FHM is the SCN1A gene, which encodes a [[sodium channel]] α subunit. The only study so far that has found mutations in this gene discovered the same Q1489K mutation in 3 of 20 families (15%) with 11 other kindreds (55%) already having mutations in CACNA1A or ATP1A2. This mutation is located in a highly conserved region of an intracellular loop connecting domains three and four. This mutation results in a greatly hastened (2–4 fold) recovery from inactivation compared to wild-type.<ref name="Dichgans_2005">{{cite journal | author = Dichgans M, Freilinger T, Eckstein G, Babini E, Lorenz-Depiereux B, Biskup S, Ferrari M, Herzog J, van den Maagdenberg A, Pusch M, Strom T | title = Mutation in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel SCN1A in familial hemiplegic migraine | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9483 | pages = 371–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16054936 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66786-4}}</ref> As this channel is important for [[action potential]] generation in [[neuron]]s, it is expected that the Q1489K mutant results in hyperexcitable neurons.

===FHM4 (1q31)===
The final known locus for FHM maps to the q-arm of [[chromosome 1]]. There are a number of attractive candidate genes in this area, though no mutations in them have yet been linked to FHM4.<ref name="Gardner_1997">{{cite journal | author = Gardner K, Barmada M, Ptacek L, Hoffman E | title = A new locus for hemiplegic migraine maps to chromosome 1q31 | journal = Neurology | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 1231–8 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9371899 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.49.5.1231}}</ref>

==Treatment/Management==
''See the equivalent section in the [[Migraine#Treatment|main migraine article]].''

Patients with FHM are encouraged to avoid activities that may trigger their attacks. Minor head trauma is a common attack precipitant, so FHM sufferers should avoid contact sports. [[Acetazolamide]] or standard drugs are often used to treat attacks, though those leading to vasoconstriction should be avoided due to the risk of [[stroke]].

==Prevention/Screening==
Prenatal screening is not typically done for FHM, however it may be performed if requested. As [[penetrance]] is high, individuals found to carry mutations should be expected to develop signs of FHM at some point in life.

==Epidemiology==
Migraine itself is a very common disorder, occurring in 15–20% of the population. Hemiplegic migraine, be it familial or spontaneous, is less prevalent, 0.01% prevalence according to one report.<ref name="Lykke_2002">{{cite journal | author = Lykke Thomsen L, Kirchmann Eriksen M, Faerch Romer S, Andersen I, Ostergaard E, Keiding N, Olesen J, Russell M | title = An epidemiological survey of hemiplegic migraine | journal = Cephalalgia | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 361–75 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12110112 | doi = 10.1046/j.1468-2982.2002.00371.x}}</ref> Women are three times more likely to be affected than males.
