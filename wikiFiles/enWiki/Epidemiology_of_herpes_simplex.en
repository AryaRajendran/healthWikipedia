In many infections, the first symptom a person will have of their own infection is the horizontal transmission to a sexual partner or the vertical transmission of neonatal herpes to a newborn at term. Since most asymptomatic individuals are unaware of their infection, they are considered at high risk for spreading HSV.  Many studies have been performed around the world to estimate the numbers of individuals infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 by determining if they have developed antibodies against either viral species.<ref name="pmid12353183">{{cite journal |author=Smith JS, Robinson NJ |title=Age-specific prevalence of infection with herpes simplex virus types 2 and 1: a global review |journal=J.

==Europe==
Large differences in HSV-1 [[seroprevalence]] are seen in different [[Europe|European countries]]. HSV-1 seroprevalence is high in [[Bulgaria]] (83.9%) and The [[Czech Republic]] (80.6%), and lower in [[Belgium]] (67.4%), The [[Netherlands]] (56.7%), and [[Finland]] (52.4%).<ref name="pmid15170000"/>

The typical age at which HSV-1 infection is acquired ranges from 5 to 9 years in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an countries like Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, to over 25 years of age in [[Northern Europe]]an countries such as Finland, The Netherlands, [[Germany]], and [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Young adults in Northern European countries are less likely to be infected with HSV-1.  European women are more likely to be HSV-1 seropositive than men.<ref name="pmid15170000"/>

HSV-2 seropositivity is widely distributed in Europeans older than 12, although there are large differences in the percentage of the population exposed to HSV-2.  Bulgaria has a high (23.9%) HSV-2 seroprevalence relative to other European countries: Germany (13.9%), Finland (13.4%),
Belgium (11.1%), The Netherlands (8.8%), the Czech Republic (6.0%), and England and Wales (4.2%).<ref name="pmid15170000"/>

Women are more likely to be seropositive than men, and likely acquire the virus at an earlier age.  In each country of Europe, HSV-2 seropositivity becomes more common from adolescence onwards and increases in the population with age, with a decline in the older age groups in some countries.<ref name="pmid15170000"/>

In most African countries, HSV-2 prevalence increases with age. However, age-associated decreases in HSV-2 seroprevalence has been observed for women in [[Uganda]] and [[Zambia]], and in men in [[Ethiopia]], [[Benin]], and Uganda.<ref name="pmid12353183"/>

===Northern Africa===
Genital herpes appears less common in [[North Africa|Northern Africa]] compared to Sub-Saharan Africa.  For example, only 26% of middle-aged women have antibodies for HSV-2 in [[Morocco]].<ref name="pmid18080353"/>  Women are more likely to be infected with HSV-2 once they are over the age of 40.<ref name="pmid18080353"/>

Children in [[Egypt]] with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] are often infected with HSV from a young age—HSV-1 or HSV-2 antibodies are present in an estimated 54% of children under the age of 5, and 77% in children over 10 years of age.<ref name="pmid16883441">{{cite journal

==Central and South America==
Relative to rates in Europe and North America, HSV-2 seroprevalency is high in Central and South America. Infection levels are estimated at 20% to 60%.<ref name="pmid12353183"/><ref name="pmid15115627"/>
During the mid-1980s, HSV-2 prevalence was 33% in 25–29 year old women and 45% in those aged 40 and over in [[Costa Rica]]. In the early 1990s HSV-2 prevalence was approximately 45% among women over 60 in [[Mexico]].<ref name="pmid12353183"/>

The highest HSV-2 prevalence in Central or South America—60%—has been found in [[Colombia]]n middle-aged women, although similar HSV-2 prevalence has been observed in younger women in [[Haiti]] (54%).<ref name="pmid12353183"/> HSV-2 infects about 30% of women over 30 years old in [[Colombia]], Costa Rica, Mexico, and [[Panama]]. HSV-2 antibodies were found in more than 41% of women of childbearing age in [[Brazil]].<ref name="pmid12353183"/>

However, no increase in seroprevalence was associated with age in women over 40 years old in Brazil—HSV-2 prevalence was estimated at 50% among women aged 40–49, 33% among women 50–59, and 42% among women over 60. Women in Brazil are more likely to acquire an HSV-2 infection if their male partners had history of anal sex and had many sexual partners in his lifetime.<ref name="pmid18080353"/>   In [[Peru]], HSV-2 prevalence is also high among women in their 30s but is lower in men.<ref name="pmid12353183"/>

==Asia==
===Eastern and South East Asia===

In South Korea, incidence of HSV-2 infection in those under the age of 20 is low, only 2.7% in men and 3.0% in women.<ref name="pmid18162706"/>  Seroprevalence levels increase in older South Koreans however, such that the population over 20 that has antibodies against HSV-2 is 21.7% of men and 28% of women.<ref name="pmid18162706"/>

===Southern Asia===
In India 33.3% of individuals are seropositive for HSV-1 and 16.6% are seropositive for HSV-2. Those with both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies are estimated at 13.3% of the population. Indian men are more likely to be infected with HSV-2 than women, and increasing seroprevalence of this virus is associated with an increasing age.<ref name="pmid17278662">{{cite journal |author=Kaur R, Gupta N, Baveja UK |title=Seroprevalence of HSV1 and HSV2 infections in family planning clinic attenders |journal=J Commun Dis |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=307–9 |year=2005 |pmid=17278662 |doi=}}</ref>
