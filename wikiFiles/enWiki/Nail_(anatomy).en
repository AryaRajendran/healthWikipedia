A '''nail''' is a horn-like envelope covering the [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] aspect of the terminal [[Phalanx (anatomy)|phalanges]] of fingers and toes in humans, most non-human [[primate]]s, and a few other [[mammal]]s. Nails are similar to [[claw]]s in other animals.
<!--Moved sentence about common usage referring to nail plate only to the place where the plate is talked about-->
Fingernails and toenails are made of a tough [[protein]] called [[keratin]], as are animals' hooves and horns. The mammalian nail, claw, and hoof are all examples of ''unguis'' [plural ''ungues''].

The epidermis is attached to the dermis by tiny longitudinal "grooves"<ref name="HookedonNails" /> called matrix crests (''cristae matricis unguis'').<ref name="Feneis-2000">Feneis 2000, pp 392-395</ref><ref name="FootDoc,Ca" /> In old age, the nail plate becomes thinner so that these grooves become more visible.<ref name="HookedonNails" />

The '''nail sinus''' (''sinus unguis'') is where the nail root is;<ref name="Feneis-2000" /> i.e. the base of the nail underneath the skin. It originates from the actively growing tissue below, the matrix.<ref name="NailSuperstore-Glossary" />

The '''[[nail plate]]''' (''corpus unguis'')<ref name="Feneis-2000" /> is the hard part of the nail, made of translucent [[keratin]] protein. Several layers of dead, compacted cells cause the nail to be strong but flexible.<ref name="HookedonNails" /> Its (transversal) shape is determined by the form of the underlying bone.<ref name="HookedonNails" /> In common usage, the word ''nail'' often refers to this part only.

The '''onychodermal band''' is the seal between the nail plate and the hyponychium. It is just under the free edge, in that portion of the nail where the nail bed ends and can be recognized by its glassy, greyish colour (in fair-skinned people). It is not visible in some individuals while it is highly prominent on others.<ref name="HookedonNails" />

The '''[[eponychium]]''' is the small band of [[epithelium]] that extends from the posterior nail wall onto the base of the nail.<ref name="Feneis-2000" /> Often and erroneously {{Contradict-inline|article=Cuticle #Human anatomy|date=October 2011}} called the "proximal fold" or "[[cuticle]]", the eponychium is ''the end'' of the proximal fold that folds back upon itself to shed an epidermal layer of skin onto the newly formed nail plate. This layer of non-living, almost invisible skin is the cuticle that "rides out" on the surface of the nail plate. Together, the eponychium and the cuticle form a protective seal. The cuticle on the nail plate is dead cells and is often removed during manicure, but the eponychium is living cells and should not be touched.<ref name="SalonGeek" /> The '''perionyx''' is the projecting edge of the eponychium covering the proximal strip of the lunula.<ref name="Feneis-2000" />

The '''nail wall''' (''vallum unguis'') is the cutaneous fold overlapping the sides and proximal end of the nail. The '''lateral margin''' (''margo lateralis'') lies beneath the nail wall on the sides of the nail and the '''nail groove''' or '''fold''' (''sulcus matricis unguis'') are the cutaneous slits into which the lateral margins are embedded.<ref name="Feneis-2000" />

===Function===
A healthy finger nail has the function of protecting the distal phalanx, the fingertip, and the surrounding soft tissues from injuries. It also serves to enhance precise delicate movements of the distal digits through counter-pressure exerted on the pulp of the finger.
<ref name="eMedicine" /> 
The nail then acts as a counterforce when the end of the finger touches an object, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the fingertip,<ref>{{cite web
 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20010515/1961.html
 | title = Fingertip Injuries

 | date = May 2001 | accessdate = March 2010}}
</ref> even though there are no nerve endings in the nail itself. 
Finally, the nail functions as a tool, enabling for instance a so-called "extended precision grip" (e.g. pulling out a splinter in one's finger).

===Growth===

The growing part of the nail is under the skin at the nail's [[proximal]] end under the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], which is the only living part of a nail. 

In mammals, the length and growth rate of nails is related to the length of the terminal [[Phalanx (anatomy)|phalanges]] (outermost finger bones). Thus, in humans, the nail of the index finger grows faster than that of the little finger; and fingernails grow up to four times faster than toenails.

In humans, nails grow at an average rate of {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} a month.<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7740 Toenail Definition - Medicine.net]</ref> Fingernails require three to six months to regrow completely, and toenails require 12 to 18 months. Actual growth rate is dependent upon age, sex, season, exercise level, diet, and [[hereditary]] factors. Nails grow faster in the summer than in any other season.<ref>Hunter, J. A.

[[File:Daumennagel mit Nagelhaut und Niednagel.jpg|thumb|Thumbnail of the right hand with [[cuticle]] (left) and [[hangnail]] (top)]]
[[File:ToeNailInjury.jpg|thumb|Mechanical injury can result in the nail being dropped.]]
Healthcare and pre-hospital-care providers ([[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s or [[paramedic]]s) often use the fingernail beds as a cursory indicator of distal tissue [[perfusion]] of individuals that may be [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] or in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref>[http://www.co.monterey.ca.us/health/EMS/pdfs/EMSManual.pdf Monterey County EMS Manual].

Capillary nail refill test.</ref>

Nail growth record can show the history of recent health and physiological imbalances, and has been used as a [[diagnostic tool]] since ancient times.<ref>[http://www.aad.org/public/Publications/pamphlets/NailHealth.htm American Academy of Dermatology - Nail Health]</ref><!--{{ref|diagnoses}}--> Deep transverse grooves known as [[Beau's lines]] may form across the nails (not along the nail from cuticle to tip) and are usually a natural consequence of aging, though they may result from disease. Discoloration, thinning, thickening, brittleness, splitting, grooves, [[Mees' lines]], [[leukonychia|small white spots]], receded lunula, [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] (convex), flatness, [[spooning]] (concave) can indicate illness in other areas of the body, [[nutrient]] deficiencies, drug reaction or poisoning, or merely local injury. Nails can also become thickened ([[onychogryphosis]]), loosened ([[onycholysis]]), infected with [[fungus]] ([[onychomycosis]]) or [[Degenerative disease|degenerate]] ([[onychodystrophy]]); for further information see [[nail disease]]s.

[[DNA profiling]] is a technique employed by [[forensic scientists]] on hair, fingernails etc.

====Permeability====
The nail is often considered an impermeable barrier, but this is not true. In fact, it is much more permeable than the skin,<ref name=penetration>[http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/72442/1/j.1467-2494.1983.tb00348.x.pdf K. A. WALTERS and G. L. FLYNN, Permeability characteristics of the human nail plate, International Journal of Cosmetic Science 5, 231-246 (1983)]</ref> and the composition of the nail includes 7–12% of water. This permeability has implications for penetration by harmful and medicinal substances; in particular cosmetics applied to the nails can pose a risk. Water can penetrate the nail as can many other substances including [[paraquat]], a fast acting herbicide that is harmful to humans, [[urea]] which is often an ingredient in creams and lotions meant for use on hands and fingers, and several fungicidal agents such as [[salicylic acid]] (aspirin), [[miconazole]] branded Monistat, [[natamycin]]; and [[sodium hypochlorite]] which is the active ingredient in common household bleach (but usually only in 2–3% concentration).<ref name=penetration/>

==== Health and care ====
Bluish or purple fingernail beds may be a symptom of peripheral [[cyanosis]], which indicates oxygen deprivation.

Nails can dry out, just like [[skin]]. They can also peel, break, and be infected. Toe infections, for instance, can be caused or exacerbated by [[dirty]] [[sock]]s, specific types of aggressive [[exercise]]{{which|date=January 2012}}, tight [[footwear]], and walking unprotected in an unclean [[Natural environment|environment]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Nail tools used by different people may transmit infections. [[Nail file]]s, "if ... used on different people, ... may spread nail fungi, staph bacteria or viruses," warns Ted Dischman, a spokesperson for the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology. In fact, over 100 bacterial [[skin]] infections in 2000 were traced to footbaths in nail salons.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} To avoid this, new improved contactless tools can be used, for example, gel and cream cuticle removers instead of cuticle scissors.

Many people also compulsively [[Nail biting|bite their nails]].

[[Inherited accessory nail of the fifth toe]] occurs where the toenail of the smallest toe is separated, forming a smaller, "sixth toenail" in the outer corner of the nail.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Like any other nail, it can be cut using a [[nail clipper]].

==== Effect of nutrition ====
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2012}}
[[Vitamin A]] is an essential micronutrient for vision, reproduction, cell and tissue differentiation, and immune function. [[Vitamin D]] and [[calcium]] work together in cases of maintaining homeostasis, creating muscle contraction, transmission of nerve pulses, blood clotting, and membrane structure. A lack of vitamin A, vitamin D, and calcium can cause dryness and brittleness. Sources of these micronutrients include fortified milk, cereal, and juices, salt-water fish, fish-liver oils, and some vegetables. [[Vitamin B12]] is mainly found in animal sources such as liver and kidney, fish, chicken, and dairy products and therefore can cause intake issues in vegan populations. Not enough B12 vitamin can lead to excessive dryness, darkened nails, and rounded or curved nail ends. Insufficient intake of both vitamin A and B, as previously described, results in fragile nails with horizontal and vertical ridges.<ref>There are some over the counter vitamin supplements that may help in growth of strong nails such as certain [[Multivitamins]] and [[Biotin]], though this is quite subjective as well.

}}</ref> [[Protein]] is a building material for new nails; therefore, low dietary protein intake may cause white nail beds. Dietary sources of this macronutrient include eggs, milk, cheese, meat, beans and legumes. A lack of protein combined with deficiencies in [[folic acid]] and [[vitamin C]] produce [[hangnails]]. [[Essential fatty acids]] play a large role in healthy skin as well as nails. As touched upon previously, essential fatty acids can be obtained through consumption of fish, flaxseed, canola oil, seeds, leafy vegetables, and nuts. Splitting and flaking of nails may be due to a lack of [[linoleic acid]]. Iron-deficiency anemia can lead to a pale color along with a thin, brittle, ridged texture. Iron deficiency in general may cause the nails to become flat or concave, rather than convex. Iron can be found in animal sources, called heme iron, such as meat, fish, and poultry, and can also be found in fruits, vegetables, dried beans, nuts, and grain products, also known as non-heme iron. Heme iron is absorbed fairly easily in comparison to non-heme iron; however, both types provide the necessary bodily functions.<ref>

===Fashion===
{{main|manicure|pedicure}}

Manicures (for the hands) and pedicures (for the feet) are health and cosmetic procedures to groom, trim, and paint the nails and manage [[callus]]es. They require various tools such as cuticle [[scissors]], nail scissors, [[nail clipper]]s, and [[nail file]]s. [[Artificial nails]] can also be fixed onto real nails for cosmetic purposes.

A person whose occupation is to cut, shape and care for nails as well as to apply overlays such as acrylic and UV Gel is sometimes called a [[nail technician]]. The place where a nail technician works may be a [[nail salon]] or nail shop or nail bar.

Painting the nails with coloured [[nail polish]] (also called nail lacquer and nail varnish) to improve the appearance is a common practice dating back to at least 3000 B.C.

===Length records===

[[Guinness World Record]]s began tracking record fingernail lengths in 1955, when an unnamed Chinese priest was listed as having fingernails {{convert|22.75|in|cm}} long. 

The current record-holder for men, according to Guinness, is [[Shridhar Chillal]] of India who set the record in 1998 with a total of {{convert|242.25|in|cm}} of nails on his left hand. His longest nail, on his thumb, was {{convert|4.8|ft|m}} long.

The record-holder for women is [[Lee Redmond]] of the U.S., who set the record in 2001 and as of 2008 had nails with a total length on both hands of {{convert|28|ft|m}}, with the longest nail on her right thumb at {{convert|2|ft|11|in|cm}}.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com">{{Cite news

In contrast to nails, claws are typically curved ventrally (downwards in animals) and compressed sideways. They serve a multitude of functions {{mdash}}including climbing, digging, and fighting{{mdash}} and have undergone numerous adaptive changes in different animal [[Taxon|taxa]]. Claws are pointed at their ends and are composed of two layers: a thick, deep layer and a superficial, hardened layer which serves a protective function. The underlying bone is a virtual mould of the overlying horny structure and therefore has the same shape as the claw or nail. Compared to claws, nails are flat, less curved, and do not extend far beyond the tip of the digits. The ends of the nails usually consist only of the "superficial", hardened layer and are not pointed like claws.<ref name="Ankel-Simons-342" /><!-- ref for para -->

With only a few exceptions, primates retain [[plesiomorphic]] (original, "primitive") hands with five digits, each equipped with either a nail or a claw. For example, all [[prosimian]]s (i.e. "primitive" primates or "proto-primates", see also ''[[Plesiadapiformes]]'') have nails on all digits except the second toe which is equipped with a so-called [[toilet-claw]] (i.e. important for grooming activities). The [[needle-clawed bushbaby]] (''Euoticus'') have keeled nails (the thumb and the first and the second toes have claws) featuring a central ridge that ends in a needle-like tip. In [[tree shrew]]s all digits have claws and, unlike most primates, the digits of their feet are positioned close together, and therefore the thumb cannot be brought into opposition (another [[Primate#Distinguishing features|distinguishing feature of primates]]).<ref name="Ankel-Simons-342" /><!-- ref for para -->

A study of the fingertip morphology of four small-bodied [[New World monkey]] species indicated a correlation between increasing small-branch foraging and
# expanded apical pads (fingertips),
# developed epidermal ridges ([[fingerprint]]s),
# broadened distal parts of [[distal phalanges]] (fingertip bones), and
# reduced flexor and extensor tubercles (attachments areas for finger muscles on bones).
This suggests that whereas claws are useful on large-diameter branches, wide fingertips with nails and epidermal ridges were required for habitual locomotion on small-diameter branches. It also indicates keel-shaped nails of ''[[Callitrichine]]s'' (a family of New World monkeys) is a derived postural adaptation rather than retained ancestral condition.
