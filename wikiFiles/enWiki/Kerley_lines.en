'''Kerley lines''' are a [[radiologic sign|sign]] seen on [[chest radiograph]]s with interstitial [[pulmonary edema]]. They are thin linear pulmonary opacities caused by fluid or cellular infiltration into the interstitium of the lungs. They are named after [[Peter Kerley]].<ref name="urlFaculty of Radiologists .

==Associated conditions==
They are suggestive for the diagnosis of [[congestive heart failure]], but are also seen in various non-cardiac conditions such as [[pulmonary fibrosis]], interstitial deposition of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] particles or [[carcinomatosis]] of the lung.  Chronic Kerley B lines may be caused by fibrosis or [[hemosiderin]] deposition caused by recurrent [[pulmonary oedema]].

==Types==
;Kerley A lines
:These are longer (at least 2cm and up to 6cm) unbranching lines coursing diagonally from the [[hilum of lung|hila]] out to the periphery of the lungs. They are caused by distension of anastomotic channels between peripheral and central lymphatics of the lungs. Kerley A lines are less commonly seen than Kerley B lines. Kerley A lines are never seen without Kerley B or C lines also present.

;Kerley B lines
:These are short parallel lines at the lung periphery. These lines represent interlobular septa, which are usually less than 1 cm in length and parallel to one another at right angles to the [[pleura]]. They are located peripherally in contact with the pleura, but are generally absent along fissural surfaces.  They may be seen in any zone but are most frequently observed at the lung bases at the [[costophrenic angles]] on the PA radiograph, and in the substernal region on lateral radiographs. Kerley B lines are seen in Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD).

;Kerley C lines
:These are the least commonly seen of the Kerley lines. They are short, fine lines throughout the lungs, with a reticular appearance. They may represent thickening of anastomotic lymphatics or superimposition of many Kerley B lines.
