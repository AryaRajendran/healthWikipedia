'''Pseudo gray platelet syndrome''' was described by Cockbill, Burmester, and Heptinstall (1988)<ref name="pmid3143601">{{cite journal |author=Cockbill SR, Burmester HB, Heptinstall S |title=Pseudo grey platelet syndrome--grey platelets due to degranulation in blood collected into EDTA |journal=Eur.

==Presentation==
Bleeding time, activated partial [[thromboplastin]] time, [[prothrombin]] time, and [[euglobulin lysis time]] were within normal limits. There were no [[platelet]] [[antibodies]] detected. The patient's mother and two sisters had histories of easy bruising and heavy menstrual periods. A brother had no reported bleeding tendencies. Platelets from the mother, sisters, and a daughter were normal in number and appearance under the light microscope. Platelets in blood collected into [[EDTA]] tubes appeared gray and agranular compared with platelets from blood in [[citrate]] or [[heparin]]. The key finding is under [[electron microscopy]], EDTA-exposed platelets showed extensive activation, with loss of storage granule contents and pseudopod formation. Platelet aggregation studies were normal. 

The abnormal platelet reaction following EDTA exposure is thought to be caused by a [[plasma factor]], although not an [[immunoglobulin]]. The mechanism by which platelet activation occurs remains unknown. Few cases have been reported in the literature. 

==Comparison to gray platelet syndrome==
Pseudo-gray platelet syndrome differs from [[gray platelet syndrome]] (GPS), one of the [[giant platelet syndrome]]s.<ref name="pmid7957801">{{cite journal |author=Jantunen E |title=Inherited giant platelet disorders |journal=Eur.

Patients with the GPS are affected by mild to moderate bleeding tendencies.
