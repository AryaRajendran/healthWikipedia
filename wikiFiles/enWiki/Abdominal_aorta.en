The '''abdominal aorta''' is the largest artery in the [[abdominal cavity]].  As part of the [[aorta]], it is a direct continuation of the [[descending aorta]] (of the thorax).

==Path==
It begins at the level of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], crossing it via the [[aortic hiatus]], technically behind the diaphragm, at the vertebral level of T12. It travels down the posterior wall of the abdomen, anterior to the vertebral column.  It thus follows the curvature of the lumbar vertebrae, that is, convex anteriorly.  The peak of this convexity is at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3).

It runs parallel to the [[inferior vena cava]], which is located just to the right of the abdominal aorta, and becomes smaller in diameter as it gives off branches. This is thought to be due to the large size of its principal branches. At the 11th rib, the diameter is 122mm long and 55mm wide and this is because of the constant pressure

==Branches==

The abdominal aorta supplies blood to much of the abdominal cavity. It begins at T12, and usually has the following branches:

{| class="wikitable" class="sortable wikitable" 
| '''Branch''' || '''Vertebra''' || '''Type''' || '''Paired?''' || '''A/P'''  || '''Description''' 
 |- 
 | [[inferior phrenic artery|inferior phrenic]] || T12  || Parietal   || yes || post. || originates just below the diaphragm, supplying it from below

 |- 
 | [[renal artery|renal]] || In between L1 and L2  || Visceral   || yes || post. || large artery, each arising from the side of the aorta; supplies corresponding kidney; arises in the [[transpyloric plane]]
 |-

 |-

 |- 
 | [[median sacral artery|median sacral]] || L4  || Parietal   || no || post. || artery arising from the middle of the aorta at its lowest part
 |- 
 | [[common iliac artery|common iliac]] || L4 || Terminal   || yes || post. || branches (bifurcates) to supply blood to the [[lower limb]]s and the pelvis, ending the abdominal aorta
|}

Note that the bifurcation (union) of the [[inferior vena cava]] is at L5 and therefore below that of the bifurcation of the aorta.

==Relations==
The abdominal aorta lies slightly to the left of the midline of the body.  It is covered, anteriorly, by the [[lesser omentum]] and [[stomach]], behind which are the branches of the celiac artery and the celiac plexus; below these, by the [[lienal vein]](splenic vein), the [[pancreas]], the left [[renal vein]], the inferior part of the [[duodenum]], the [[mesentery]], and [[aortic plexus]]. 

Posteriorly, it is separated from the lumbar vertebræ and intervertebral fibrocartilages by the [[anterior longitudinal ligament]] and left lumbar veins. 

On the right side it is in relation above with the [[azygos vein]], [[cisterna chyli]], [[thoracic duct]], and the right crus of the diaphragm—the last separating it from the upper part of the [[inferior vena cava]], and from the right celiac ganglion; the inferior vena cava is in contact with the aorta below. 

On the left side are the left crus of the diaphragm, the left celiac ganglion, the ascending part of the duodenum, and some coils of the [[small intestine]].

===Relationship with inferior vena cava===
The abominal aorta's venous counterpart, the [[inferior vena cava]] (IVC), travels parallel to it on its right side.
* Above the level of the [[Navel|umbilicus]], the aorta is somewhat posterior to the IVC, sending the [[right renal artery]] travelling behind it.  The IVC likewise sends its opposite side counterpart, the [[left renal vein]], crossing in front of the aorta.
* Below the level of the umbilicus, the situation is generally reversed, with the aorta sending its right [[common iliac artery]] to cross its opposite side counterpart (the left [[common iliac vein]]) anteriorly.

==Collateral circulation==
The collateral circulation would be carried on by the anastomoses between the [[internal thoracic artery]] and the [[inferior epigastric artery]]; by the free communication between the superior and inferior mesenterics, if the ligature were placed between these vessels; or by the anastomosis between the [[inferior mesenteric artery]] and the [[internal pudendal artery]], when (as is more common) the point of ligature is below the origin of the [[inferior mesenteric artery]]; and possibly by the anastomoses of the [[lumbar arteries]] with the branches of the [[internal iliac artery]].
