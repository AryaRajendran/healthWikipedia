The '''modified Rankin Scale''' (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the [[activities of daily living|daily activities]] of people who have suffered a [[stroke]] or other causes of neurological disability, and it has become the most widely used [[clinical endpoint|clinical outcome measure]] for stroke [[clinical trial]]s. It was originally introduced in 1957 by Dr. John Rankin of Stobhill Hospital Glasgow, Scotland,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rankin J |title=Cerebral vascular accidents in patients over the age of 60.  II.  Prognosis |journal=Scott Med J |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=200–15 |year=1957 |month=May |pmid=13432835}}</ref> and first modified to its currently accepted form by Prof. C. Warlow's group at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh for use in the UK-TIA study in the late 1980s.<ref name=Warlow>{{cite journal | doi=10.1136/jnnp.54.12.1044 | author=Farrell B, Godwin J, Richards S, Warlow C, ''et al.'' | title=The United Kingdom transient ischaemic attack (UK-TIA) aspirin trial: final results. | journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | year=1991 | volume=54 | pages=1044–1054 |pmid=1783914 | issue=12 | pmc=1014676}}</ref> The first publication of the current modified Rankin Scale was in 1988 by van Swieten, ''et al.'', who also published the first interobserver agreement analysis of the modified Rankin Scale.<ref name=vanSwieten>{{cite journal | author=van Swieten J, Koudstaal P, Visser M, Schouten H, ''et al.'' | title=Interobserver agreement for the assessment of handicap in stroke patients. | journal=Stroke | year=1988 | volume=19 | pages=604–607 | pmid=3363593 | issue=5}}</ref> 

Interobserver reliability of the mRS can be improved by using a structured questionnaire during the interview process<ref name=Wilson>{{cite journal | doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000027437.22450.BD | author=Wilson JL, Hareendran A, Grant M, ''et al.'' | title=Improving the Assessment of Outcomes in Stroke: Use of a Structured Interview to Assign Grades on the Modified Rankin Scale. | journal=Stroke | year=2002 | volume=33 | pages=2243–2246 | pmid=12215594 | issue=9}}</ref><ref name=Hareendran>{{cite journal | author=Wilson JL, Hareendran A, Hendry A, ''et al.'' | title=Reliability of the Modified Rankin Scale Across Multiple Raters: Benefits of a Structured Interview. | journal=Stroke | year=2005 | volume=36 | pages=777–781 | pmid=15718510 | issue=4 | doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000157596.13234.95 }}</ref> and by having raters undergo a multimedia training process.<ref name=Quinn>{{cite journal | author=Quinn TJ, Lees KR, Hardemark HG, ''et al.'' | title=Initial experience of a digital training resource for modified Rankin scale assessment in clinical trials. | journal=Stroke | year=2007 | volume=38 | pages=2257–2261 | pmid=17600236 | issue=8 | doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.106.480723 }}</ref> The multimedia mRS training system developed by Prof. K. Lees' group at the [[University of Glasgow]] is [http://www.rankinscale.org/ available online].  More recently, several tools have been developed to more systematically determine the mRS, including the mRS-SI,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bruno A, Shah N, Lin C, "et al." |title=Improving modified Rankin Scale assessment with a simplified questionnaire |journal=Stroke |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=1048–50 |year=2010 |pmid= 20224060}}</ref> the RFA,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Saver JL, Filip B, Hamilton S, "et al." |title=Improving the reliability of stroke disability grading in clinical trials and clinical practice: the Rankin Focused Assessment (RFA) |journal=Stroke |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=992–95 |year=2010 |pmid=20360551 }}</ref> and the mRS-9Q.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patel N, Rao VA, Heilman-Espinoza ER, Lai R, Quesada RA, Flint AC |title=Simple and reliable determination of the modified Rankin Scale in neurosurgical and neurological patients: The mRS-9Q |journal=Neurosurgery |year=2012 |month=July |pmid= 22843133 }}</ref> The mRS-9Q is in the [[public domain]] and a free web calculator is available at [http://www.modifiedrankin.com/ www.modifiedrankin.com]. 

==The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)==
The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to [[death]].
* 0 - No symptoms.
* 1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
* 2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
* 3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
* 4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
* 5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
* 6 - Dead.
