'''Dementia with Lewy bodies''' (DLB), also known under a variety of other names including '''Lewy body dementia''', '''diffuse Lewy body disease''', '''cortical Lewy body disease''', and '''senile dementia of Lewy type''', is a type of [[dementia]] closely associated with both [[Alzheimer's]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]s. It is characterized anatomically by the presence of [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]], clumps of  [[alpha-synuclein]] and [[ubiquitin]] protein in [[neuron]]s, detectable in ''post mortem'' brain histology.<ref name=Van2007>{{Citation

Lewy body dementia affects 1.3 million individuals in the United States alone.

==Classification==
Dementia with Lewy bodies overlaps clinically with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], but is more associated with the latter.<ref name="Van2007"/>  In DLB, loss of cholinergic ([[acetylcholine]]-producing) [[neuron]]s is thought to account for degeneration of cognitive function (similar to Alzheimer's), while the death of dopaminergic ([[dopamine]]-producing) neurons appears to be responsible for degeneration of motor control (similar to Parkinson's) &ndash; in some ways, therefore, it resembles both diseases. The overlap of neuropathologies and presenting symptoms (cognitive, emotional, and motor) can make an accurate differential diagnosis difficult. In fact, it is often confused in its early stages with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia ([[multi-infarct dementia]]), although, where Alzheimer’s disease usually begins quite gradually, DLB often has a rapid or acute onset, with especially rapid decline in the first few months. DLB tends to progress more quickly than Alzheimer’s disease.<ref name=Scotland>{{Citation

 | url = http://www.alzscot.org/pages/info/lewybody.htm
}}</ref>  Despite the difficulty, a prompt diagnosis of DLB is important because of the risks of sensitivity to [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptic]] drugs and because appropriate treatment of symptoms can improve life for both the person with DLB and their caregivers.<ref name="Scotland"/>

DLB is distinguished from the dementia that sometimes occurs in Parkinson's disease by the time frame in which dementia symptoms appear relative to Parkinson symptoms.<ref name=Weintraub2007>{{citation

==Signs and symptoms==
While the specific symptoms in a person with DLB will vary, core features of DLB are: fluctuating cognition with great variations in attention and alertness from day to day and hour to hour, recurrent visual [[hallucination]]s (observed in 75% of people with DLB), and motor features of Parkinson's. Suggestive symptoms are [[rapid eye movement behavior disorder|rapid eye movement(REM)-sleep behavior disorder]] and abnormalities detected in [[positron emission tomography|PET]] or [[SPECT scan]]s.<ref name=Association2007>{{citation

Parkinson's features could include shuffling gait, reduced arm-swing during walking, blank expression (reduced range of facial expression), stiffness of movements, ratchet-like [[cogwheeling]] movements; low speech volume, [[sialorrhea]] and difficulty swallowing.

Some commonly used drugs which should be used with great caution, if at all, for people with DLB are [[chlorpromazine]], [[haloperidol]], or [[thioridazine]].<ref name="Scotland" />

Visual hallucinations in people with DLB most commonly involve perception of people or animals that are not there. Delusions may include [[reduplicative paramnesia]] and other elaborate misperceptions or misinterpretations.<ref name=Ferman2007>{{Citation

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Lewy bodies (alpha synuclein inclusions).svg|300px|right|thumb|Photomicrographs of regions of substantia nigra in a patient showing Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in various magnifications]]
Pathologically, DLB is characterized by the development of abnormal proteinaceous ([[alpha-synuclein]]) cytoplasmic inclusions, called [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]], throughout the brain.  These inclusions have similar structural features to "classical" Lewy bodies seen subcortically in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, a loss of [[dopamine]]-producing neurons (in the [[substantia nigra]]) occurs, similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease, and a loss of [[acetylcholine]]-producing neurons (in the [[Basal nucleus of meynert|basal nucleus of Meynert]] and elsewhere) similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease.  Cerebral atrophy (or shrinkage) also occurs as the [[cerebral cortex]] degenerates.  Autopsy series have revealed the pathology of DLB is often concomitant with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.  That is, when Lewy body inclusions are found in the cortex, they often co-occur with Alzheimer's disease pathology found primarily in the [[hippocampus]], including senile plaques (deposited [[amyloid|beta-amyloid protein]]), and granulovacuolar degeneration (grainy deposits within and a clear zone around hippocampal neurons). [[Neurofibrillary tangles]] (abnormally phosphorylated [[tau protein]]) are less common in DLB, although they are known to occur, and astrocyte abnormalities are also known to occur.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Hishikawa N, Hashizume Y, Yoshida M, Niwa J, Tanaka F, Sobue G.|title=Tuft-shaped astrocytes in Lewy body disease.|journal=Acta Neuropathol.|year=2005|month=Apr|volume=109|issue=4|pages=373–80|pmid=15668789}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Dementia with Lewy bodies from the perspective of tauopathy|journal=Acta Neuropathol.|year=2003|month=March|volume=105|issue=3|pages=265–70|pmid=12557014|author=Iseki E, Togo T, Suzuki K, Katsuse O, Marui W, de Silva R, Lees A, Yamamoto T, Kosaka K.|doi=10.1007/s00401-002-0644-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=56|issue=2|year=1999|month=February|url=[http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/56/2/203 Neurofibrillary Pathology in Alzheimer Disease With Lewy Bodies]|author=Marla Gearing, PhD; Michael Lynn, MS; Suzanne S.

==Management==
Although no cure for DLB is available, treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit, but remain [[palliative care|palliative]] in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical and caregiving.

===Pharmaceutical===
Pharmaceutical management, as with Parkinson's disease, involves striking a balance between treating the motor and emotive/cognitive symptoms.Motor symptoms appear to respond somewhat to the drugs used to treat [[Parkinson's disease]](.e.g. [[levodopa]].) while cognitive issues may improve with drugs for Alzheimer's disease such as ([[Aricept]]). Drugs used in the treatment of [[Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]](.e.g. [[Ritalin]]) might improve cognition, or,daytime sleepiness.However,both drugs for [[Parkinson's disease]] & [[ADHD]] increase the chemical dopamine in the brain and so the risk of hallucinations increases with those classes of pharmaceuticals.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8555378</ref><ref name="en.wikipedia.org">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis</ref>   

Treatment of the movement & cognitive  portions of the disease can worsen hallucinations and psychosis, while treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with [[Anti-psychotics]] can worsen parkinsonian or ADHD like symptoms in DLB such as tremor or rigidity &  lack of concentration or impulse control.<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000759.htm</ref><ref>http://www.healthy.net/scr/News.aspx?Id=8976</ref> Doctors may find the use of [[cholinesterase inhibitor]]s represents the treatment of choice for cognitive problems and [[donepezil]] (Aricept), [[rivastigmine]] (Exelon) and [[galantamine]] (Reminyl) may be recommended as a means to help with these problems and to slow or prevent the decline of cognitive function.<ref name="Scotland"/> Reports indicate Lewy body dementia may be more responsive to donepezil than Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=Neef>{{Citation|last1= Neef|first1= Doug|last2= Walling|first2= Anne D|title= Dementia with Lewy Bodies: an Emerging Disease|date= 2006-04-01|journal= American Family Physician|volume= 73|issue= 7|pages= 1223–1229|url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0401/p1223.html |accessdate= 2010-01-29|pmid = 16623209|postscript= .}}</ref> [[Memantine]] may also be useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aarsland|first1=D|last2=Ballard|first2=C|last3=Walker|first3=Z|last4=Bostrom|first4=F|last5=Alves|first5=G|last6=Kossakowski|first6=K|last7=Leroi|first7=I|last8=Pozo-Rodriguez|first8=F|last9=Minthon|first9=L|title=Memantine in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial.|journal=Lancet neurology|volume=8|issue=7|pages=613–8|year=2009|pmid=19520613|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70146-2}}</ref> [[Sinemet]] may help with movement problems, but in some cases, like dopamine agonists, may tend to aggravate psychosis in people with DLB. [[Clonazepam]] may help with [[rapid eye movement behavior disorder]]; table salt or [[antihypotensive medication]]s may help with fainting and other problems associated with orthostatic hypotension. [[Botulinum toxin]] injections in the [[parotid glands]] may help with [[sialorrhea]]. Other medications,stimulants such as the [[ADHD]] drug [[methylphenidate]] A.K.A [[Ritalin]] and [[modafinil]], may improve daytime alertness.But again, as with the anti-parkinsonian drug [[Sinemet]],anti-hyperkinetics like [[Ritalin]] increase the risk of psychosis.<ref name="Van2007"/><ref name="en.wikipedia.org"/> Experts advise extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. When these medications must be used, [[atypical antipsychotics]] are preferred to [[typical antipsychotics]]; a very low dose should be tried initially and escalated only slowly, and patients should be carefully monitored for bad reactions to the drugs.

Due to hypersensitivity to [[neuroleptic]]s, prevention of DLB patients taking these drugs is of great importance. People with DLB are at risk for [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], a life-threatening illness, because of their sensitivity to these medications, especially the older typical antipsychotics, such as [[haloperidol]]. Other medications, including drugs for urinary incontinence and the antihistamine medication [[Benadryl]] can also exacerbate dementia.

=== Caregiving ===
Because DLB has no cure, it gradually renders people incapable of tending to their own needs. Caregiving is thus very important and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease. Caring for people with DLB involves adapting the home environment, schedule, activities, and communications to accommodate declining cognitive skills and parkinsonian symptoms.<ref name="Ferman2007"/>

People with DLB may swing dramatically between good days—high alertness and few cognitive or movement problems—and bad days, and the level of care they need may thus vary widely and unpredictably. Sharp changes in behavior may be due to the day-to-day variability of DLB, but they may also be triggered by changes in the schedule or home environment, or by physical problems, such as constipation, dehydration, bladder infection, injuries from falls, and other problems the person with DLB may not be able to convey to caregivers. Potential physical problems should always be checked out when a person with DLB becomes agitated.

Especially when hallucinations and delusions are not dangerous or troubling to the person with DLB, it may be best for caregivers not to disabuse patients of them. Often the best approach may be benign neglect—acknowledging, but not encouraging or agreeing. Trying to talk the DLB patient out of his delusion may be frustrating to caregivers and discouraging to patients, sometimes provoking anger or dejection. When misperceptions,  hallucinations, and the behaviors stemming from these become troublesome, caregivers should try to identify and eliminate environmental triggers, and perhaps offer cues or "therapeutic white lies" to steer patients out of trouble. Doctors may prescribe low doses of atypical antipsychotics, such as [[quetiapine]], for psychosis and agitation in DLB. A small clinical trial found about half of DLB patients treated with low doses of quetiapine experienced significant reduction in these symptoms. Unfortunately, several participants in the study had to discontinue treatment because of side effects—excessive daytime sleepiness or [[orthostatic hypotension]].<ref name="Weintraub2007"/>

Changes in the schedule or environment, delusions, hallucinations, misperceptions, and sleep problems may also trigger behavior changes. It can help people with DLB to encourage exercise, simplify the visual environment, stick to a routine, and avoid asking too much (or too little) of them. Speaking slowly and sticking to essential information improves communication. The potential for visual misperception and hallucinations, in addition to the risk of abrupt and dramatic swings in cognition and motor impairment, should put families on alert to the dangers of driving with DLB.<ref name="Crystal2008" />

==Epidemiology==
Currently, an estimated 60 to 75% of diagnosed dementias are of the Alzheimer's and mixed (Alzheimer's and vascular dementia) type, 10 to 15% are Lewy body type, with the remaining types being of an entire spectrum of dementias, including [[frontotemporal lobar degeneration]], [[Korsakoff's syndrome|alcoholic dementia]], pure [[vascular dementia]], etc. It is slightly more prevalent in men than women.<ref name="Crystal2008"/>

==History==
[[Frederic Lewy]] (1885–1950) was first to discover the abnormal protein deposits ("Lewy body inclusions") in the early 1900s.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2499|Lewy body dementia}}</ref> Dementia with Lewy bodies only started to be diagnosed in the mid-1990s after the discovery of [[alpha-synuclein]] staining first highlighted Lewy bodies in the cortex of ''post mortem'' brains of a subset of dementia patients.<ref name="Stewart2007"/> Because it was only recently discovered, DLB is not a recognized diagnosis in [[DSM-IV]], which was published in 1994.  It is, however, briefly mentioned in the DSM-IV-TR (published in 2000) under "Dementia Due to Other General Medical Conditions".  In 1996, a consortium of scientists initially proposed and later revised diagnostic guidelines.

Attention was drawn to DLB following the 2008 death of actress [[Estelle Getty]], who had previously been diagnosed with both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases before her true condition was discovered. Fellow Golden Girls cast members noted, years earlier, Getty had severe trouble remembering her lines during the filming of the show. Another victim of DLB was [[William Stiles Bennet II]], 1934-2009, a grandson and a son of US Congressmen who represented the area that includes [[Orange County, NY]]. Known as "Billo" to his friends, the younger Bennet was a successful businessman, and was one of the original developers of the [[Yoplait]] yogurt line.
