{{external links|date=April 2013}}
'''Low-density lipoprotein''' ('''LDL''') is one of the five major groups of [[lipoprotein]]s, which in order of size, largest to smallest, are [[chylomicron]]s, [[Very low-density lipoprotein|VLDL]], [[Intermediate-density lipoprotein|IDL]], '''LDL''', and [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]], that enable transport of multiple different fat molecules, including [[cholesterol]], within the water around cells and within the water-based [[blood]]stream.  Studies have shown that higher levels of type-B LDL particles (as opposed to type-A LDL particles) are associated with health problems, including [[cardiovascular disease]]. LDL is often informally called ''bad cholesterol,'' (as opposed to [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL]] particles, which are frequently referred to as ''good cholesterol'' or ''healthy cholesterol'').<ref>[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=180 LDL and HDL Cholesterol: What's Bad and What's Good?]</ref>

==Testing==
[[Blood tests]] typically report LDL-C, the amount of cholesterol contained in LDL.  In clinical context, mathematically calculated estimates of LDL-C are commonly used to estimate how much low density lipoproteins are driving progression of [[atherosclerosis]].

Direct LDL measurements are also available and better reveal individual issues but are less often promoted or done due to slightly higher costs and being available from only a [[Vertical auto profile|couple of laboratories]] in the United States. In 2008, the [[American Diabetes Association|ADA]] and [[American College of Cardiology|ACC]] recognized direct LDL particle measurement by [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] as superior for assessing individual risk of cardiovascular events.<ref>John D.

==Biochemistry==

===Structure===
Each native LDL particle contains a single [[apolipoprotein]] B-100 molecule ([[apolipoprotein B-100|Apo B-100]], a protein that has 4536 [[amino acid]] residues and a mass of 514 [[kDa]]), which circulates the fatty acids, keeping them soluble in the aqueous environment.{{Citation needed|reason=not common knowledge|date=January 2012}} In addition, LDL has a highly hydrophobic core consisting of polyunsaturated fatty acid known as ''[[Linoleic acid|linoleate]]'' and about 1500 esterified cholesterol molecules.{{Citation needed|reason=Unable to find anything that confirms this|date=January 2012}} This core is surrounded by a shell of phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol, as well as the single copy of Apo B-100. LDL particles are approximately 22&nbsp;nm (0.00000087&nbsp;in.) in diameter and have a mass of about 3 million [[atomic mass unit|daltons]], but since LDL particles contain a changing number of fatty acids, they actually have a distribution of mass and size.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Segrest JP, Jones MK, De Loof H, Dashti N |title=Structure of apolipoprotein B-100 in low density lipoproteins |journal=Journal of Lipid Research |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=1346–67 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11518754 |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11518754}}</ref> Determining the structure of LDL has been a tough task because of its heterogeneous structure. First structure of LDL at human body temperature in native condition has been recently found using cryo-electron microscopy and it has resolution of 16 Angstrom.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kumar V, Butcher SJ, Katrina O,Engelhardt P,Heikkonen J, Kaski K, Ala-Korpela M, Kovanen PT. |title=Three-Dimensional cryoEM Reconstruction of Native LDL Particles to 16Å Resolution at Physiological Body Temperature |journal=PLoS ONE |year=2011 |month=May|pmid=21573056 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0018841 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018841 |pmc=3090388 |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=e18841}}</ref>

===LDL subtype patterns===
LDL particles vary in size and density, and studies have shown that a pattern that has more small dense LDL particles, called ''Pattern B'', equates to a higher risk factor for [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD) than does a pattern with more of the larger and less-dense LDL particles (''Pattern A'').  This is thought to be because the smaller particles are more easily able to penetrate the [[endothelium]]. ''Pattern I'', for ''intermediate'', indicates that most LDL particles are very close in size to the normal gaps in the endothelium (26&nbsp;nm). According to one study, sizes 19.0–20.5&nbsp;nm were designated as pattern B and LDL sizes 20.6–22&nbsp;nm were designated as pattern A.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clc.4960280510/pdf</ref>

Some in the medical community have suggested the correspondence between Pattern B and CHD is stronger than the correspondence between the LDL number measured in the standard lipid profile test.  Tests to measure these LDL subtype patterns have been more expensive and not widely available, so the common lipid profile test is used more often.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35058896/ns/health-heart_health/t/bad-cholesterol-its-not-what-you-think/#.T4Gkub_Owrg</ref>

There has also been noted a correspondence between higher triglyceride levels and higher levels of smaller, denser LDL particles and alternately lower triglyceride levels and higher levels of the larger, less dense LDL.<ref name="pmid12417832">{{Cite journal|author=Superko HR, Nejedly M, Garrett B |title=Small LDL and its clinical importance as a new CAD risk factor: a female case study |journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Nursing |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=167–73 |year=2002 |pmid=12417832 |doi=10.1111/j.0889-7204.2002.01453.x}}</ref><ref name="Warnick"/>

===Transport into the cell===
When a cell requires cholesterol, it synthesizes the necessary [[LDL receptors]], and inserts them into the plasma membrane. The LDL receptors diffuse freely until they associate with [[clathrin]]-[[Caveolae|coated pits]]. LDL particles in the bloodstream bind to these extracellular LDL receptors. The clathrin-coated pits then form vesicles that are endocytosed into the cell.

After the clathrin coat is shed, the vesicles deliver the LDL and their receptors to early [[endosomes]], onto late endosomes to lysosomes. Here the cholesterol esters in the LDL are hydrolysed. The LDL receptors are recycled back to the plasma membrane.

==Medical relevance==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
Because LDL particles can also transport cholesterol into the [[artery]] wall, retained there by arterial [[proteoglycan]]s and attract [[macrophages]] that engulf the LDL particles and start the formation of [[Atheroma|plaque]]s, increased levels are associated with [[atherosclerosis]]. Over time [[vulnerable plaque]]s rupture, activate blood clotting and produce arterial [[stenosis]], which if severe enough results in [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[cerebrovascular accident|stroke]], and [[peripheral artery occlusive disease|peripheral vascular disease]] symptoms and major debilitating events.

Increasing evidence has revealed that the concentration and size of the LDL particles more powerfully relates to the degree of atherosclerosis progression than the concentration of cholesterol contained within all the LDL particles.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15886898 Not All Calories Are Created Equal, Author Says]. Talk of the Nation discussion of the book ''[[Good Calories, Bad Calories]]'', by Gary Taubes. National Public Radio, 2 November 2007.</ref> The healthiest pattern A, though relatively rare, is to have small numbers of large LDL particles and no small particles. Having small LDL particles, though common, is an unhealthy pattern B; high concentrations of small LDL particles (even though potentially carrying the same total cholesterol content as a low concentration of large particles) correlates with much faster growth of [[atheroma]], progression of [[atherosclerosis]] and earlier and more severe cardiovascular disease events and death.  This video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0Y5hss1tZQ], examining autopsy specimens from an actual heart attack resulting in sudden death, shows the seqence. These videos, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLLBlBiboJI&NR=1] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8wXdtoW-HQ&feature=related], illustrate the sequence of events and why, though the underlying process develops over decades, the symptoms are often of sudden onset.

LDL particles are formed as [[VLDL]] lipoproteins lose triglyceride through the action of [[lipoprotein lipase]] (LPL) and they become smaller and denser (i.e. fewer fat molecules with same protein transport shell), containing a higher proportion of cholesterol esters [http://www.rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb2/part1/lipoprot.htm].

A hereditary form of high LDL is [[familial hypercholesterolemia]] (FH). Increased LDL is termed [[hyperlipoproteinemia type II]] (after the dated [[Fredrickson classification]]).

LDL particles pose a risk for [[cardiovascular disease]] when they invade the [[endothelium]] and become [[oxidize]]d, since the oxidized forms are more easily retained by the proteoglycans. A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL particles, chiefly stimulated by presence of necrotic cell debries [http://www.rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb2/part1/lipoprot.htm] and [[free radicals]] in the endothelium.

===Role in the innate immune system===
[[LDL]] lipoproteins interfere with the [[quorum sensing]] system that upregulates genes required for invasive [[Staphylococcus aureus]] infection. The mechanism of antagonism entails binding [[Apolipoprotein B]], to a S. aureus [[autoinducer]] pheromone, preventing signaling through its receptor. Mice deficient in apolipoprotein B are more susceptible to invasive  bacterial infection.<ref name="Apolipoprotein B Is an innate barrier against invasive Staphylococcus aureus infection">{{Cite journal|author=Peterson MM, Mack JL, Hall PR, ''et al.'' |title=Apolipoprotein B Is an innate barrier against invasive Staphylococcus aureus infection |journal=Cell Host & Microbe |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=555–66 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19064256 |doi=10.1016/j.chom.2008.10.001 |pmc=2639768}}</ref>

The [[mevalonate pathway]] serves as the basis for the biosynthesis of many molecules, including cholesterol. The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase ([[HMG CoA reductase]]) is an essential component in the pathway.

====Pharmaceutical====
*[[Statin]]s reduce high levels of LDL particles by inhibiting the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]] in cells, the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of hepatic [[LDL receptor]]s is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the blood.

*[[Ezetimibe]] reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thus can powerfully reduce LDL particle concentrations when combined with statins.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm079524.htm]</ref>

*[[Niacin]] (B<sub>3</sub>), lowers LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacyglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing [[triglyceride]] synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Meyers CD, Kamanna VS, Kashyap ML |title=Niacin therapy in atherosclerosis |journal=Current Opinion in Lipidology |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=659–65 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15529025 |doi=10.1097/00041433-200412000-00006}}</ref> and HM74A or GPR109A.<ref name=pmid17238156>{{Cite journal|author=Soudijn W, van Wijngaarden I, Ijzerman AP |title=Nicotinic acid receptor subtypes and their ligands |journal=Medicinal Research Reviews |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=417–33 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17238156 |doi=10.1002/med.20102}}</ref>

*Some [[Tocotrienol]]s, especially delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, are being promoted as statin alternative non-prescription agents to treat high cholesterol, having been shown in vitro to have an effect. In particular, gamma-tocotrienol appears to be another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, and can reduce cholesterol production.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Song |first= B.L. |coauthors= DeBose-Boyd, R.A.|year=2006 |title=Insig-Dependent Ubiquitination and Degradation of 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Stimulated by Delta- and Gamma-Tocotrienols |journal=J.

====Dietary====
*Eating a varied diet rich in [[vegetarian cuisine|plant foods]] and low in animal-derived foods such as meats, eggs and dairy products has been shown to significantly lower LDL levels in all patients, as plants naturally contain no [[cholesterol]].

*The most effective approach has been minimizing fat stores located inside the [[abdominal cavity]] (visceral body fat) in addition to minimizing total body fat.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} [[Visceral fat]], which is more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat, has been found to produce many enzymatic signals, e.g. [[insulin resistance|resistin]], which increase [[insulin resistance]] and circulating VLDL particle concentrations, thus both increasing LDL particle concentrations and accelerating the development of [[Diabetes Mellitus]].

*[[Phytosterols]] are widely recognized as having a proven LDL cholesterol lowering efficacy.<ref>{{cite web | author = European Food Safety Authority, Journal | url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1813.htm | title = Scientific opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to plant sterols and plant stanols and maintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations | year = 2010}}</ref> Current supplemental guidelines recommend doses of phytosterols in the 1.6-3.0&nbsp;grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III,FDA) with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating an 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.15&nbsp;gram per day.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Demonty|first=I|coauthors=Ras, RT, van der Knaap, HC, Duchateau, GS, Meijer, L, Zock, PL, Geleijnse, JM, Trautwein, EA|title=Continuous dose-response relationship of the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of phytosterol intake.|journal=The Journal of nutrition|date=2009 Feb|volume=139|issue=2|pages=271–84|pmid=19091798|doi=10.3945/jn.108.095125}}</ref>

In non-diabetics, glucagon levels are very low when insulin levels are high; however, those who have become diabetic no longer suppress glucagon output after eating.

*A [[ketogenic diet]] may have similar response to taking [[niacin]] (lowered LDL and increased HDL) through beta-hydroxybutyrate, a [[ketone]] body, coupling the niacin receptor (HM74A).<ref name=pmid17238156/>

*Lowering the blood lipid concentration of [[triglycerides]] helps lower the concentration of small LDL particles, because fat rich VLDL particles convert in the bloodstream into Small LDL particles.{{Vague|reason=Readers may not know triglycerides are part of VLDL, let alone how reducing former necessarily reduces latter|date=December 2009}}

==Estimation of LDL particles via cholesterol content==
Chemical measures of lipid concentration have long been the most-used clinical measurement, not because they have the best correlation with individual outcome, but because these lab methods are less expensive and more widely available.

The lipid profile does not measure LDL particles directly but instead estimates them using the Friedewald equation<ref name="Warnick">{{Cite journal|author=Warnick GR, Knopp RH, Fitzpatrick V, Branson L |title=Estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the Friedewald equation is adequate for classifying patients on the basis of nationally recommended cutpoints |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=15–9 |year=1990 |month=January |pmid=2297909 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2297909}}</ref><ref name="pmid4337382">{{Cite journal|author=Friedewald WT, Levy RI, Fredrickson DS |title=Estimation of the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma, without use of the preparative ultracentrifuge |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=499–502 |year=1972 |month=June |pmid=4337382 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4337382}}</ref>
by subtracting the amount of cholesterol associated with other particles, such as [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] and [[Very low-density lipoprotein|VLDL]], assuming a prolonged fasting state, etc.:
:<math>L \approx C - H - kT</math>
:where ''H'' is HDL cholesterol, ''L'' is LDL cholesterol, ''C'' is total cholesterol, ''T'' are triglycerides, and k is 0.20 if the quantities are measured in mg/dl and 0.45 if in mmol/l.

There are limitations to this method, most notably that samples must be obtained after a 12 to 14 h fast and that LDL-C cannot be calculated if plasma triglyceride is >4.52&nbsp;mmol/L (400&nbsp;mg/dL). Even at triglyceride levels 2.5 to 4.5&nbsp;mmol/L, this formula is considered inaccurate.<ref name="Sniderman">{{Cite journal|author=Sniderman AD, Blank D, Zakarian R, Bergeron J, Frohlich J |title=Triglycerides and small dense LDL: the twin Achilles heels of the Friedewald formula |journal=Clinical Biochemistry |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=499–504 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14563441 |doi=10.1016/S0009-9120(03)00117-6}}</ref>  If both total cholesterol and triglyceride levels are elevated then a modified formula, with quantities in mg/dl, may be used
:<math>L = C - H - 0.16T</math>

This formula provides an approximation with fair accuracy for most people, assuming the blood was drawn after fasting for about 14 hours or longer.

However, the concentration of LDL particles, and to a lesser extent their size, has a slightly stronger correlation with individual clinical outcome than the amount of cholesterol within LDL particles, even if the LDL-C estimation is approximately correct. There is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more targeted and accurate measurements of LDL particles. Specifically, LDL particle number (concentration), and to a lesser extent size, have shown slightly stronger correlations with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than obtained using chemical measures of the amount of cholesterol carried by the LDL particles [http://www.liposcience.com/userfiles/content/files/weightofevidence.pdf]. It is possible that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high. Correspondingly, it is possible that LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low. If LDL particle concentration is used to predict cardiovascular events, many other correlates of these clinical outcomes, such as [[diabetes mellitus]], obesity and smoking, lose much of their predictive power.

===Normal ranges===
In the USA, the [[American Heart Association]], [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]], and [[National Cholesterol Education Program|NCEP]] provide a set of guidelines for fasting LDL-Cholesterol levels, estimated or measured, and risk for [[Coronary heart disease|heart disease]]. As of about 2005, these guidelines were:<ref>

Over time, with more clinical research, these recommended levels keep being reduced because LDL reduction, including to abnormally low levels, was the most effective strategy for reducing cardiovascular death rates in one large [[double blind]], randomized clinical trial of men with hypercholesterolemia;<ref name="pmid7566020 ">{{Cite journal|author=Shepherd J, Cobbe SM, Ford I, ''et al.'' |title=Prevention of coronary heart disease with pravastatin in men with hypercholesterolemia.

For instance, for people with known atherosclerosis diseases, the 2004 updated [[American Heart Association]], NIH and NCEP recommendations are for LDL levels to be lowered to less than 70&nbsp;mg/dL, unspecified how much lower. This low level of less than 70&nbsp;mg/dL was recommended for primary prevention of 'very-high risk patients' and in secondary prevention as a 'reasonable further reduction'. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the [[Annals of internal medicine]].<ref>[http://www.annals.org/content/145/7/520.full Narrative Review: Lack of Evidence for Recommended Low-Density Lipoprotein Treatment Targets: A Solvable Problem]</ref> It should also be noted that statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have [[Pleiotropy (drugs)|numerous physiological effects]] beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels.

It has been estimated from the results of multiple human pharmacologic LDL lowering trials{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} that LDL should be lowered to about 50 to reduce cardiovascular event rates to near zero. For reference, from longitudinal population studies following progression of atherosclerosis-related behaviors from early childhood into adulthood,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} it has been discovered that the usual LDL in childhood, before the development of [[fatty streaks]], is about 35&nbsp;mg/dL. However, all the above values refer to chemical measures of lipid/cholesterol concentration within LDL, not LDLipoprotein concentrations, probably not the better approach.

The feasibility of these figures has been questioned by sceptics, claiming that many members of the AHA and NIH are heavily associated with pharmaceutical companies giving them bias towards lowering cholesterol levels and such guidelines giving rise to increased use of cholesterol lowering medicine such as statins.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A study was conducted measuring the effects of guideline changes on LDL cholesterol reporting and control for diabetes visits in the US from 1995 to 2004. It was found that although LDL cholesterol reporting and control for diabetes and coronary heart disease visits improved continuously between 1995 and 2004, neither the 1998 ADA guidelines nor the 2001 ATP III guidelines increased [http://www.cholesterolverlagen.nu/bloedcholesterol-verlagen/ldl-bloedcholesterol-verlagen.php LDL cholesterol] control for diabetes relative to coronary heart disease.<ref name=wang>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Y Richard|coauthors=G Caleb Alexander and David O Meltzer|title=Lack of Effect of Guideline Changes on LDL Cholesterol Reporting and Control for Diabetes Visits in the U.S., 1995–2004|journal=Diabetes Care|year=2005|month=December|volume=28|issue=12|pages=2942–2944|pmid=16306559|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16306559|accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref> 

Moreover, there are publications<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18000291 Low serum LDL cholesterol levels and the risk of fever, sepsis, and malignancy.]</ref> regarding the risks of low-LDL cholesterol too.

==Direct measurement of LDL concentration==
There are several competing methods for measurement of lipoprotein particle size although the evidence in favor of their superiority to existing methods is weak, even by the statements of proponents.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20531184 | doi=10.1097/MOL.0b013e32833b7756 | volume=21 | issue=4 | title=Lipoprotein subfractions and cardiovascular disease risk | year=2010 | month=August | author=Krauss RM | journal=Curr. Opin. Lipidol. | pages=305–11}}</ref> Direct LDL particle measurement by [[NMR]] was mentioned by the [[American Diabetes Association|ADA]] and [[American College of Cardiology|ACC]], in a 28 March 2008 joint consensus statement,<ref>[http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/full/j.jacc.2008.02.034#BIB25]</ref> as having advantages for predicting individual risk of atherosclerosis disease events, but the statement noted that the test is not widely available and is more expensive (about $98.00 US without insurance coverage) than existing tests. Furthermore the authors also said it is "...unclear whether LDL particle size measurements add value to measurement of LDL particle concentration." Since the later 1990s, because of the development of NMR measurements, it has been possible to clinically measure lipoprotein particles at lower cost [under $100 US (including shipping) versus the previous costs of >$400 to >$5,000] and high accuracy. There are also other (less expensive) homogeneous assays for LDL, however most only estimate LDL.

Using NMR, as pioneered by researcher [[Jim Otvos]] and the North Carolina State University academic research spinoff company [http://www.liposcience.com LipoScience], the total LDL particle concentrations, in nmol/L plasma, are typically subdivided by percentiles referenced to the 5,382 men and women, not on any lipid medications, who participated in the MESA trial.<ref>[http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/]</ref>

===Optimal ranges===
The LDL particle concentrations are typically categorized by percentiles, <20%, 20–50%, 50th–80th%, 80th–95% and >95% groups of the people participating and being tracked in the MESA trial, a medical research study sponsored by the United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

The lowest incidence of atherosclerotic events over time occurs within the <20% group, with increased rates for the higher groups. Multiple other measures, including particle sizes, small LDL particle concentrations, total and large [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] particle concentrations, along with estimations of [[insulin resistance]] pattern and standard cholesterol lipid measurements (for comparison of the plasma data with the estimation methods discussed above) are also routinely provided.
