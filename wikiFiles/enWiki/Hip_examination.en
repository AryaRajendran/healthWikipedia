In [[medicine]], [[physiotherapy]], and chiropractic, the '''hip examination''', or '''hip exam''', is undertaken when a patient has a complaint of [[hip pain]] and/or [[sign (medicine)|signs]] and/or [[symptom]]s suggestive of [[hip joint]] [[pathology]].  It is a [[physical examination]] maneuver.

The hip examination, like all examinations of the joints, is typically divided into the following sections:
*Position/lighting/draping
*Inspection
*Palpation
*Motion
*Special maneuvers

The middle three steps are often remembered with the saying ''look, feel, move''.

==Position/lighting/draping==
Position - for most of the exam the patient should be [[supine]] and the bed or examination table should be flat. The patient's hands should remain at their sides with the head resting on a pillow. The knees and hips should be in the [[anatomical position]] (knee [[Extension (kinesiology)|extended]], hip neither flexed nor extended).

Lighting - adjusted so that it is ideal.

Draping - both of the patient's hips should be exposed so that the [[quadriceps muscle]]s and [[greater trochanter]] can be assessed.

==Inspection==
===Inspection done while the patient is standing===
The hip should be examined for:
*Abnormal gait - i.e. [[antalgic gait]]

===Inspection done while supine===
The hip should be examined for:
*Masses
*Scars
*Lesions
*Signs of trauma/previous surgery
*Bony alignment (rotation, leg length)
*Muscle bulk and symmetry at the hip and knee

====Measures====
*True leg length - Greater Trochanter of the [[femur]] or Anterior Superior Iliac Spine of pelvis to [[medial malleolus]] of ipsilateral leg.
*Apparent leg length - [[Navel|umbilicus]] or [[xiphisternum]] (noting which is used) to the [[medial malleolus]] of ipsilateral leg.

In hip fractures the affected leg is often shortened and externally rotated.

==Palpation==
The [[hip joint]] lies deep inside the body and cannot normally be directly palpated.

To assess for pelvic fracture one should palpate the:
*[[Iliac spine]]s
*[[superior pubic ramus|Superior]] and [[Inferior pubic ramus|inferior pubic rami]]

==Movement==
*Internal rotation - with knee and hip both flexed at 90 degrees the ankle is abducted.
*External rotation - with knee and hip both flexed at 90 degrees the ankle is adducted. (also done with the [[Patrick's test]] / [[FABER test]])
*Flexion (also known as the [[Gaenslen's test]])
*Extension - done with the patient on their side.  Alignment should be assessed by palpation of the ASIS, [[posterior superior iliac spine|PSIS]] and [[greater trochanter]].
*Abduction - assessed whilst palpating the contralateral [[anterior superior iliac spine|ASIS]].
*Adduction - assessed whilst palpating the ipsilateral ASIS.

*Assessment for a hidden [[flexion contracture]] of the hip - hip flexion contractures may be occult, due to compensation by the back.  They are assessed by:
*# Placing a hand behind the lumbar region of back 
*# Getting the patient to fully flex the contralateral hip.  
*# The hand in the lumbar region is used to confirm the back is straightened (flexed relative to the [[anatomic position]]).  If there is a flexion contracture in the ipsilateral hip it should be evident, as the hip will appear flexed.  

===Normal range of motion===
*Internal rotation - 35°
*External rotation - 45°
*Flexion - 135°
*Extension - 10-15°
*Abduction - 45°
*Adduction - 30°

==Special maneuvers==
*[[Trendelenburg's sign|Trendelenburg's test]]: This test is performed with the patient standing. The patient is asked to raise one leg; the test is positive if the hip on the raised side drops. A positive test suggests weakness of the abductors of the other hip.

*[[Ober's test]] for tight ITB

*[[Thomas test]] for tight hip flexors




==Other tests==
A [[knee examination]] should be undertaken in the ipsilateral knee to rule-out knee pathology.
