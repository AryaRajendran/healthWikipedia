'''Ectrodactyly''' involves the deficiency or absence of one or more central digits of the hand or foot and is also known as split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moerman|first= P.|last2=Fryns |first2=J.P.|title=Ectodermal dysplasia, Rapp-Hodgkin type in a mother and severe ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome (EEC) in her child|journal=[[American Journal of Medical Genetics]] Part A.| volume=63 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=479–81|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19960614)63:3<479::AID-AJMG12>3.0.CO;2-J |pmid=8737656}}</ref> The hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as "claw-like" and may include only the thumb and one finger (usually either the little finger, ring finger, or a [[syndactyly]] of the two) with similar abnormalities of the feet.<ref>{{cite book| last=Peterson-Falzone|first=Sally J.|last2=Hardin-Jones |first2=Mary A.| last3=Karnell| first3=Michael P.| last4=McWilliams |first4=Betty Jane |year=2001 |title=Cleft Palate Speech|publisher=Mosby |isbn=978-0-8151-3153-3}}</ref>

== Genetics ==
A large number of human gene defects can cause ectrodactyly.  The most common mode of inheritance is [[autosomal dominant]] with reduced penetrance, while [[autosomal recessive]] and X-linked forms occur more rarely.<ref name="Pascal">{{cite journal| last=Pascal |first= H.G. et al.| title=Pathogenesis of split-hand/split-foot malformation| journal=[[Human Molecular Genetics]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=R51–R60 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddg090 |url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/suppl_1/R51.full}}</ref>  Ectrodactyly can also be caused by deletions, translocations, and inversions in chromosome 7 (7q).<ref name="Wieland">{{cite journal| last=Wieland |first=I., et al. |title=Refinement of the deletion in 7q21.3 associated with split hand/foot malformation type 1 and Mondini dysplasia |journal=[[Journal of Medical Genetics]]| year=2004 |volume=41 |issue=5|pages=e54| doi=10.1136/jmg.2003.010587 | pmid=15121782| last2=Muschke| first2=P| last3=Jakubiczka| first3=S| last4=Volleth| first4=M| last5=Freigang| first5=B| last6=Wieacker| first6=PF| pmc=1735762}}</ref>  The deletions in 7q can result in a contiguous gene syndrome that includes growth impairment, [[microcephaly]], craniofacial manifestations, hernias, hearing loss, and mental retardation.<ref name="Wieland" />  Translocations in 7q do not have as many abnormalities but are generally associated with most hearing loss cases.<ref name="Wieland" />  This is why most cases of ectrodactyly are generally accompanied by another abnormality or linked to another syndrome (ex. EEC, LMS, ECP).<ref name="Winter">{{Cite journal| last=Winter |first=R.M. |last2=Baraitser |first2=M. |date=August 1987|title=The London Dysmorphology Database |journal=[[Journal of Medical Genetics]] |volume=24 |pages=509–510| doi=10.1136/jmg.24.8.509| issue=8 }}</ref>  Detailed studies of a number of mouse models for ectrodactyly have also revealed that a failure to maintain median [[apical ectodermal ridge]] (AER) signalling can be the main pathogenic mechanism in triggering this abnormality.<ref name="Pascal" />
	A number of factors make the identification of the genetic defects underlying human ectrodactyly a complicated process: the limited number of families linked to each split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) locus, the large number of morphogens involved in limb development, the complex interactions between these morphogens, the involvement of modifier genes, and the presumed involvement of multiple gene or long-range regulatory elements in some cases of ectrodactyly.<ref name="Pascal" />  In the clinical setting these genetic characteristics can become problematic and making predictions of carrier status and severity of the disease impossible to predict.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Scherer| first=Stephen, et al.| title=Human Chromosome 7: DNA Sequence and Biology| journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=300 |issue=5620 |year=2003 |pages=767–772 |doi=10.1126/science.1083423| pmid=12690205| last2=Cheung| first2=J| last3=MacDonald| first3=JR| last4=Osborne| first4=LR| last5=Nakabayashi| first5=K| last6=Herbrick| first6=JA| last7=Carson| first7=AR| last8=Parker-Katiraee| first8=L| last9=Skaug| first9=J| pmc=2882961}}</ref>

In 2011, a novel mutation in [[DLX5]] was found to be involved in SHFM.<ref>{{cite journal

== Hearing loss ==
As mentioned in the Genetics section, ectrodactyly can be caused by various changes to 7q.  When 7q is altered by a deletion or a translocation ectrodactyly can sometimes be associated with hearing loss.<ref name="Wieland" />  Ectrodactyly, or Split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM) type 1 is the only form of split hand/ malformation associated with sensorineural hearing loss.<ref name="Wieland" />

== Functionality ==
The functional utility of the malformed limbs is discussed in issue 2481 of ''The British Medical Journal''.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Lewis |first=Thomas | title=The Inheritance of Deformities |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] | volume=2 |issue=2481 |year=1908 |pages=166–173| doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2481.166}}</ref> The affected persons can perform work that requires skillful manipulation, regardless of their handicap.  The article says, “The needlework of some of the females is good; the handwriting of most is excellent.  One individual is a boot maker, two others drive cabs, none finding difficulty in clothing themselves, and most do so with extraordinary rapidity, even to the lacing of boots....It is said of one that he is able in this way to lift pins from the floor with his feet.”
	Those with ectrodactyly are contributing members of society with their own jobs and careers;<ref name="Medical">{{cite web|title=Medical Mystery: Ectrodactyly |publisher= ABC News| date=January 27, 2007|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2832319}}</ref> many choose to have families and raise children.<ref name="Medical" />  In most daily tasks the health condition appears to have a small effect on their functionality. In 2006, the London [[Tate]] exhibition ''Single Shot'' featured a video of [[Lee Hee-ah]] skillfully playing the piano with only four fingers.<ref>http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/singleshot/videos.shtm#kwon</ref><ref>http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/h/hee-ah-lee.htm</ref>

== Ectrodactyly in species other than humans ==

Ectrodactyly is not only a genetic characteristic in humans, but can also occur in frogs and toads,<ref name="Eaton">{{cite journal| last=Eaton |first=Brian R., et al.|title=Deformity Levels in Wild Populations of the Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) in Three Ecoregions of Western Canada | journal=[[Journal of Herpetology]] |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=283–287 |doi=10.1670/95-03N| last2=Eaves| first2=Sara| last3=Stevens| first3=Cameron| last4=Puchniak| first4=Allison| last5=Paszkowski| first5=Cynthia A.}}</ref> mice,<ref>{{cite journal| last=Manson |first=Jeanne |last2=Dourson |first2=Michael L. |last3=Smith |first3=Carl C. |title=Effects of Cytosine Arabinoside on In vivo and In vitro Mouse limb Development |journal=[[In Vitro]] |volume=13 |issue=7 |year=1977 |pages=434–442| doi=10.1007/BF02615104}}</ref>  salamanders,<ref name="Williams">{{cite journal| last=Williams |first=Rod |last2=Bos |first2=David |last3=Gopurenko |first3=David |last4=DeWoody |first4=Andrew |title=Amphibian malformations and inbreeding |journal=[[Biology Letters]] | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0233 |url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~dewoody/documents/Williamsetal.Malformations_BiolLetters.pdf| pmid=18593670| year=2008| volume=4| issue=5| pages=549–52| pmc=2610075}}</ref> cows,<ref name="Pascal" /> chickens,<ref name="Pascal" /> rabbits,<ref name="Pascal" /> marmosets,<ref name="Pascal" /> cats and dogs,<ref>{{cite book| first=P.F. |last=Jezyk |title=Constitutional Disorders of the Skeleton in Dogs and Cats: Textbook of Small Animal Orthopedics |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=International Veterinary Information Service |year=1985}}</ref> and even West Indian manatees.<ref name="Pascal" />  The following examples are studies showing the natural occurrence of ectrodactyly in animals, without the disease being reproduced and tested in a laboratory.  In all three examples we see how rare the actual occurrence of ectrodactyly is.

===Wood Frog===
The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta performed a study to estimate deformity levels in Wood Frogs in areas of relatively low disturbance.<ref name="Eaton" />  After roughly 22,733 individuals were examined during field studies, it was found that only 49 Wood Frogs had the ectrodactyly deformity.<ref name="Eaton" />

=== Salamanders ===
In a study performed by the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University, approximately 2000 [[salamanders]] (687 adults and 1259 larvae) were captured from a large wetland complex and evaluated for malformations.<ref name="Williams" />  Among the 687 adults, 54 (7.9%) were malformed.  Of these 54 adults, 46 (85%) had missing (ectrodactyly), extra (polyphalangy) or dwarfed digits (brachydactyly).<ref name="Williams" />  Among the 1259 larvae, 102 were malformed, with 94 (92%) of the malformations involving ectrodactyly, polyphalangy, and brachydactyly.<ref name="Williams" />  Results showed few differences in the frequency of malformations among life-history changes, suggesting that malformed larvae do not suffer substantially higher mortality than their adult conspecifics.<ref name="Williams" />

=== Cats and dogs ===
In a “''Journal of Heredity''” published by the Oxford Journals a study was performed to test allele frequencies in domestic cats.  Among the 265 cats observed, there were 101 males and 164 females.  Only one cat was recorded to have the ectrodactyly abnormality,<ref>{{cite journal| last=Davis |first=Brian |first2=Barry |last2=Davis |title=Allele frequencies in a cat population in Budapest |journal=[[Journal of Heredity]] |volume=68 |year=1977 |pages=31–34}}</ref> illustrating this rare disease.
	According to M.P. Ferreira, a case of ectrodactyly was found in a two month old male mixed [[Terrier]] dog.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Ferreira |first= M.P. et al. |title=Ectrodactilia em cão: relato de caso |journal=[[Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=910–913| doi=10.1590/S0102-09352007000400015| last2=Alievi| first2=M.M.| last3=Beck| first3=C.A.C.| last4=Voll| first4=J.| last5=Muccillo| first5=M.S.| last6=Gomes| first6=C.}}</ref>  In another study, Carrig and co-workers also reported a series of 14 dogs<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Carrig |first=CB |last2= Wortman |first2=JA |last3= Morris |first3=EL et al |title=Ectrodactyly (split-hand deformity) in the dog |journal=[[Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound]]| volume=22 |issue=3 |date=19 May 2005|doi=10.1111/j.1740-8261.1981.tb01363.x| pages=123–144| last4=Blevins| first4=Williame.| last5=Root| first5=Charlesr.| last6=Hanlon| first6=Griseldaf.| last7=Suter| first7=Peterf.| unused_data=pages123-144 }}</ref> with this abnormality proving that although ectrodactyly is an uncommon occurrence for dogs, it is not entirely unheard of.

== Human genetic disorders ==
Ectrodactyly is frequently seen with other congenital anomalies, or other birth defects.<ref name="Pascal" />  Syndromes in which ectrodactyly is associated with other abnormalities can occur when two or more genes are affected by a chromosomal rearrangement.<ref name="Pascal" />  Disorders associated with ectrodactyly include [[Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Clefting (EEC) syndrome]], which is closely correlated to the ADULT syndrome and Limb-mammary (LMS) syndrome, Ectrodactyly-Cleft Palate (ECP) syndrome, [[Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Macular Dystrophy (EEM) syndrome|Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Macular Dystrophy syndrome]], Ectrodactyly-Fibular Aplasia/Hypoplasia (EFA) syndrome, and Ectrodactyly-Polydactyly. More than 50 syndromes and associations involving ectrodactyly are distinguished in the London Dysmorphology Database.<ref name="Winter" />
