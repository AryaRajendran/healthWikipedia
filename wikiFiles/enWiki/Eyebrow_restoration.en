'''Eyebrow restoration''' is a surgical procedure intended to permanently restore and/or customize the appearance of your eyebrows. Originally intended for burn victims and patients of terminal illnesses preventing hair from growing in the eyebrow region. Eyebrow restoration surgeries have since evolved into a cosmetic procedure favored by people wishing to have perfect eyebrows.

Most traditional [[hair restoration]] surgeons offer eyebrow restorations as well. Both procedures should be performed by certified surgeons who specialize in hair and eyebrow transplantation.

The most popular hair and eyebrow restoration surgery technique is [[follicular unit transplantation]], which involves the removal of donor follicles from the back of the patients head (where hair tends to be more permanent). Once removed, the "donor area" is then stitched back up with no visible scaring. Next, the donor follicles are transplanted into the "problem areas" of the patientâ€™s balding scalp.

==Eyebrow transplant==
Transplantation to the eyebrows is a procedure designed to restore growing hair to eyebrows that are overly thin, scarred, or completely missing. The absence of hair can be due to genetics, prior electrolysis or laser hair removal, overplucking, thyroid or other hormonal abnormalities, or trauma due to surgery, burns or other types of accidents.
The donor hairs come from the scalp which, when transplanted into the eyebrows, continue to grow for a lifetime and therefore need to be trimmed typically once a month. To provide a natural appearance, the hairs are transplanted primarily one and occasionally two at a time, the natural way eyebrow hairs grow. This is a very delicate procedure, requiring perfect placement of these hairs into tiny (half-millimeter) incisions that are angled at just the right direction and positioned to mimic natural growth. The use of all-microscopically dissected [grafts] allows their placement into the smallest possible incisions so as to minimize scarring and damage to already existing hairs.

A procedure typically involves the placement of 50 to as many as 325 hairs into each eyebrow, depending upon the existing amount of hair and the desired size and density. Performed usually under a mild oral sedative, the 2 hour procedure is essentially painless, as is the recovery period. For the first 2 to 4 days after the procedure, tiny crusts are around each transplanted hair. By 3 to 5 days, other than some occasional mild pinkness which fades out by the first week, patients are able to return to normal activities without any sign of having had a procedure. Sutures that are placed in the donor area are removed at 1 week. The transplanted hairs fall out at around 2 weeks, then start to regrow at 3 months, where they will continue to grow for a lifetime.<ref>http://www.foundhair.com/media/eyebrowtransplantation.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Plastic Surgery; Its Principles and Practice|author=John Staige Davis|publisher=Blakiston|year=1919|page=384|chapter=Goyanes' operation|location=Philadelphia}}</ref>
