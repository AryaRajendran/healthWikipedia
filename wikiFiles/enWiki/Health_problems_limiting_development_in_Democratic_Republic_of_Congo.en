Health problems have been a long standing issue limiting development in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DR Congo). These health problems include [[HIV/Aids]], [[Malaria]], outbreaks of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[cholera]], [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]], [[yellow fever]], the [[Ebola virus]], and [[Viral hemorrhagic fever|hemorrhagic fever]]. [[Tuberculosis]] is an increasingly serious health concern in the DR Congo. Many insect-borne illnesses<ref name="Category:Insect-borne diseases">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Insect-borne_diseases&oldid=517235832|title=Insect-borne diseases|date=11 October 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> are present as well. 
 
Medical facilities are severely limited, and medical materials are in short supply. An adequate supply of [[Prescription drug|prescription]] or [[over-the-counter drug]]s in local stores or [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]] is also generally not available. Payment for any medical services is expected in [[cash]] in the DR Congo, in advance of treatment.

HIV/Aids is the most serious health problem in the DR Congo due to the incurable nature of this disease. By the end of 2003, [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] estimated that 1.1 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, for an overall adult HIV prevalence of 4.2%. [[Life expectancy]] in the DR Congo dropped 9% in the 1990s as a result of HIV/AIDS.

According to UNAIDS, several factors fuel the spread of HIV in the DR Congo, including the movement of large numbers of [[refugee]]s and [[soldier]]s, scarcity and high cost of safe [[blood transfusion]]s in rural areas, a lack of [[Counseling psychology|counseling]], few [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing sites]], high levels of untreated [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] among [[sex worker]]s and their clients, and low availability of [[condoms]] outside [[Kinshasa]] and one or two provincial capitals. With an eventual end of hostilities and a government in transition, population movements associated with increased stability and economic revitalization will exacerbate the spread of HIV, which is now localized in areas most directly affected by the presence of troops and war-displaced populations. [[History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Consecutive wars]] have made it nearly impossible to conduct effective and sustainable [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS prevention]] activities. 

The consequence of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|this widespread illness in Africa]] is lower [[Workforce productivity|labor productivity]] caused by detrimental health conditions. Hence, there is a lack of healthy population to engage in production of goods and services, resulting in a slow [[economic growth]]. Therefore, the lack of education about HIV has allowed the further spread of this fatal illness which makes one so ill that he/she cannot participate in the labor market fully as an individual. The lack of full access to HIV knowledge sparks a vicious [[Negative feedback|negative cycle]] that takes its form when those infected cannot engage in productive employment due to poor health, leading to chronic poverty, and being unable to gain access to knowledge about HIV. This cycle goes on and on, creating an increasing number of infections over time.
