==History==

At the age of twenty, [[Murray Koffler]] inherited two '''Koffler's Drugs''' pharmacies in suburban Toronto (one in the [[Don Mills Centre]] shopping mall).  By 1962, Koffler's had grown to a chain of 17 pharmacies, which he renamed "Shoppers Drug Mart" in the 1970s.

Koffler revamped the concept of the 20th century “drug store” in Canada by removing the [[soda fountain]] and emphasizing the dispensary, requiring his pharmacists to wear starched white coats as a symbol of their professionalism.  In the mid-1950s, he began acquiring other drug stores and organized them around a then-novel franchising concept: pharmacist “associates” would own and operate their own stores within the system and share in the profits. In 1968, Shoppers Drug Mart grew to 52 stores in Ontario by merging with 33 Plaza Drugstores. In 1970, Shoppers Drug Mart purchased 100 Cunningham Drug Stores in British Columbia and Alberta. 1972 marked the grand opening of the first Pharmaprix store in Québec. In 1974, Lord’s Supervalue Pharmacies 26 stores in Atlantic Canada joined the Shoppers Drug Mart family. In 1986 Shoppers Drug Mart bought Super X Drugstores, an Ontario-area chain of 72 stores. In 1992, the company bought up the Western Canadian chain Pinder's Drugs, and followed this in 1995 with a chain of 24 Bi-Rite Drug Stores based in western Canada. Also in 1995, Shoppers Drug Mart acquired 135 Big V Drugstores. In 1996, the first Shoppers Home Health Care store opens.

When Koffler retired in 1983, he sold the chain to [[Imasco]]. That same year, David Bloom, a former Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacist, was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Bloom would lead the organization until retiring in 2001, having devoted a total of 35 years of service to the Company. During David Bloom's tenure, Shoppers doubled its number of stores, quadrupled its sales and increased profit ten-fold. David Bloom also launched the Shoppers Optimum loyalty program in 2000 which quickly became the largest and most successful loyalty programs in Canada. The Optimum program currently boasts over 10 million members in Canada.

In 2000, after Imperial Tobacco had been taken over by BAT Industries (formerly [[British American Tobacco]]), Shoppers was sold to a consortium of institutional investors including [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] & Co. (KKR), [[Bain Capital]], Inc., [[DLJ Merchant Banking Partners]], [[Charlesbank Capital Partners]], [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]], [[CIBC Capital Partners]], and Shoppers Drug Mart's senior management and pharmacist/owners. 

In 2001, Glenn Murphy was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In November of that same year, Shoppers Drug Mart Corporation was publicly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

In 2002, Shoppers Drug Mart introduced its first large format stores, with more space, a sleek and modern look, and a stronger focus on cosmetic products. Typically the cosmetics section faces the entrance, with the pharmacy counter at the back and a  convenience food section, called Food Essentials, near the front cash. In most suburban areas, this new format takes the form of new or relocated store, typically stand-alone "[[big-box]]" locations as opposed to smaller mall or strip-mall locations. 

In 2003, Shoppers Drug Mart introduced its first BeautyBoutique, setting a new standard for the industry with its open-sell display and unbiased approach to customer service in prestige cosmetic retailing. Today, there are more than 305 BeautyBoutiques across the country.

On April 26, 2007, Shoppers Drug Mart #1000 opened in Toronto, Ontario.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shoppersdrugmart.ca/english/corporate_information/investor_relations/press_releases/articles/april_26_2007.html |title=Shoppers Drug Mart opens its 1,000th drug store in Canada |date=April 26, 2007 |publisher=Shoppers Drug Mart Corporation |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref>

==Shoppers Optimum==
The Shoppers Optimum Card is a loyalty card program that is exclusive to Shoppers Drug Mart/Pharmaprix stores. Members collect Shoppers Optimum points that may be redeemed on purchases within the store. Shoppers Optimum members receive 10 points for every dollar spent at the store. This excludes the purchase of lottery, tobacco products, transit tickets and passes, prescription items, any products containing [[codeine]], [[Canada Post]] products and gift cards (except Shoppers gift cards). Sometimes, Shoppers Drug Mart organizes special point events where customers receive 20 times the regular points when they spend a certain amount. In 2006, the Company introduced Secret Point Events. Optimum Card holders receive in the mail a flyer announcing the secret event prior to the announced date. They bring that flyer in on the secret day to obtain 20 times the regular points. Only online registered card holders receive the flyer.
