'''Chordoma''' is a rare slow-growing [[neoplasm]] thought to arise from cellular remnants of the [[notochord]]. The evidence for this is the location of the tumors (along the [[neuraxis]]), the similar immunohistochemical staining patterns, and the demonstration that notochordal cells are preferentially left behind in the [[clivus (anatomy)|clivus]] and [[Sacrococcygeal symphysis|sacrococcygeal]] regions when the remainder of the [[notochord]] regresses during [[fetal]] life.

Chordomas can arise from bone in the skull base and anywhere along the spine. The two most common locations are [[cranially]] at the [[clivus (anatomy)|clivus]] and in the [[sacrum]] at the bottom of the spine.<ref name="urlPrimary Malignant Bone Tumors: Tumors of Bones and Joints: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec04/ch044/ch044c.html#sec04-ch044-ch044c-1188 |title=Primary Malignant Bone Tumors: Tumors of Bones and Joints: Merck Manual Professional |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>

==Genetics==
A small number of families have been reported in which multiple relatives have been affected by chordoma. In four of these families duplication of the [[brachyury]] gene was found to be responsible for causing chordoma.<ref name=Walcott2012>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22300861 |title=Chordoma: current concepts, management, and future directions. |year=2012}}</ref> 

A possible association with [[tuberous sclerosis complex]] ([[TSC1]] or [[TSC2]]) has been suggested.<ref name="pmid15236319">{{cite journal |author=Lee-Jones L, Aligianis I, Davies PA, ''et al.'' |title=Sacrococcygeal chordomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex show somatic loss of TSC1 or TSC2 |journal=Genes Chromosomes Cancer |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=80–5 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15236319 |doi=10.1002/gcc.20052}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
In the [[United States]], the annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of chordoma is approximately 1 in one million (300 new patients each year).<ref name="titleCollege student fights his own cancer - Yahoo!

There are currently no known genetic or environmental risk factors for chordoma.

While most people with chordoma have no other family members with the disease, rare occurrences of multiple cases within families have been documented. This suggests that some people may be genetically predisposed to develop chordoma. Because genetic or hereditary risk factors for chordoma may exist, scientists at the National Cancer Institute are conducting a Familial Chordoma Study to search for genes involved in the development of this tumor.<ref name="NCI Familial Chordoma Study">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/ft-NCI-78-C-0039 |title=Familial Chordoma Study |accessdate=2009-02-03 |format= |work=}}</ref>

==Classification==
[[File:Chordoma - high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing a chordoma. [[HPS stain]].]]
There are three [[histological]] variants of chordoma: classical (or "conventional"),<ref name="pmid18055855">{{cite journal |author=Chugh R, Tawbi H, Lucas DR, Biermann JS, Schuetze SM, Baker LH |title=Chordoma: the nonsarcoma primary bone tumor |journal=Oncologist |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=1344–50 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18055855 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.12-11-1344 |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18055855}}</ref> chondroid and dedifferentiated. 

* The histological appearance of classical chordoma is of a lobulated [[tumor]] composed of groups of cells separated by fibrous septa. The cells have small round nuclei and abundant vacuolated [[cytoplasm]], sometimes described as physaliferous (having bubbles or [[vacuoles]]). 
* Chondroid chordomas histologically show features of both chordoma and [[chondrosarcoma]].

==Tumor Biology==

* [[mTOR]] signaling is hyperactive in sporadic sacral chordomas: in one study 10 out of 10 sacral chordomas exhibited phosphorylation of [[Ribosomal protein s6]] and [[EIF4EBP1]] by immunohistochemistry<ref name="pmid19276265">{{cite journal |author=Han S, Polizzano C, Nielsen GP, Hornicek FJ, Rosenberg AE, Ramesh V |title=Aberrant Hyperactivation of Akt and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Signaling in Sporadic Chordomas |journal=Clinical Cancer Research |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19276265 |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=1940–6 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2364 |pmc=2701205 }}</ref>

* Partial or complete [[PTEN (gene)]] deficiency is observed in nearly all sacral chordomas<ref name="pmid19276265"/>

* In a study of 49 chordomas [[Akt]], [[TSC2]], and [[EIF4EBP1]] were phosphorylated in 92%, 96% and 98% of cases, respectively.<ref name="pmid19401700">{{cite journal |author= Presneau N, Shalaby A, Idowu B, Gikas P, Cannon SR, Gout I, Diss T, Tirabosco R, Flanagan AM |title=Potential therapeutic targets for chordoma: PI3K/AKT/TSC1/TSC2/mTOR pathway |journal= British Journal of Cancer |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19401700 |volume= 100 |issue= 9 |pages= 1406–14 |doi= 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605019 |pmc= 2694420 }}</ref>

* In a tissue microarray containing 21 chordomas [[Platelet-derived growth factor receptor]]-beta (PDGFR-b), [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), KIT ([[CD117]]) and [[HER2]] were detected in 100%, 67%, 33% and 0% of cases, respectively.<ref name="pmid17973908">{{cite journal |author=Fasig JH, Dupont WD, LaFleur BJ, Olson SJ, Cates JM |title=Immunohistochemical analysis of receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction activity in chordoma. |journal=Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=17973908 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=95–104 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.2007.00873.x }}</ref>

* The [[CDKN2A]] (p16) and [[CDKN2B]] (p15) loci on chromosome 9p21 are frequently deleted in chordomas<ref name="pmid18071362">{{cite journal |author=Hallor KH, Staaf J, Jönsson G, Heidenblad M, Vult von Steyern F, Bauer HC, Ijszenga M, Hogendoorn PC, Mandahl N, Szuhai K, Mertens F. |title=Frequent deletion of the CDKN2A locus in chordoma: analysis of chromosomal imbalances using array comparative genomic hybridisation. |journal=British Journal of Cancer |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18071362 |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=434–42 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6604130 |pmc=2361468 }}</ref> Another study found CDKN2A immunoreactivity in just 4% of cases.<ref name="pmid19401700"/>

* 62% of chordomas express the High Molecular Weight Melanoma Associated Antigen, also known as Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 ([[CSPG4]]) which has been the target of immune therapy.<ref name="pmid18641983">{{cite journal |author=Schwab JH, Boland PJ, Agaram NP, Socci ND, Guo T, O'Toole GC, Wang X, Ostroumov E, Hunter CJ, Block JA, Doty S, Ferrone S, Healey JH, Antonescu CR. |title=Chordoma and chondrosarcoma gene profile: implications for immunotherapy. |journal=Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=18641983 |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=339–49 |doi=10.1007/s00262-008-0557-7 }}</ref>

* Recently, scientists have discovered that an inherited Gene duplication is responsible for the familial form of this disorder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2009/nci-04.htm |title=Gene Duplication Identified in an Uncommon Form of Bone Cancer |year=2009 }}</ref>

==Prognosis and treatment==
In one study, the 10-year [[tumor]] free survival rate for sacral chordoma was 46%.<ref name="pmid16203885">{{cite journal |author=Fuchs B, Dickey ID, Yaszemski MJ, Inwards CY, Sim FH |title=Operative management of sacral chordoma |journal=The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume |volume=87 |issue=10 |pages=2211–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16203885 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.D.02693}}</ref> Chondroid chordomas appear to have a more indolent clinical course.

In most cases, complete surgical [[Segmental resection|resection]] followed by [[radiation therapy]] offers the best chance of long-term control.<ref name="pmid16757128">{{cite journal |author=Park L, Delaney TF, Liebsch NJ, Hornicek FJ, Goldberg S, Mankin H, Rosenberg AE, Rosenthal DI, Suit HD |title=Sacral chordomas: Impact of high-dose proton/photon-beam radiation therapy combined with or without surgery for primary versus recurrent tumor.}}</ref> Incomplete resection of the primary tumor makes controlling the disease more difficult and increases the odds of recurrence.

Chordomas are relatively radioresistant, requiring high doses of radiation to be controlled. The proximity of chordomas to vital neurological structures such as the brain stem and nerves limits the dose of radiation that can safely be delivered. Therefore, highly focused radiation such as [[proton therapy]] and carbon ion therapy are more effective than conventional x-ray radiation.<ref name="pmid19095372">{{cite journal |author=Delaney TF, Liebsch NJ, Pedlow FX, Adams J, Dean S, Yeap BY, McManus P, Rosenberg AE, Nielsen GP, Harmon DC, Spiro IJ, Raskin KA, Suit HD, Yoon SS, Hornicek FJ. |title=Sacral chordomas: Phase II Study of High-Dose Photon/Proton Radiotherapy in the Management of Spine Sarcomas.}}</ref> 

There are no drugs currently approved to treat chordoma, however a clinical trial conducted in Italy using the [[PDGFR]] inhibitor [[Imatinib]] demonstrated a modest response in some chordoma patients.<ref name="pmid15372471">{{cite journal |author=Casali PG, Messina A, Stacchiotti S, ''et al.'' |title=Imatinib mesylate in chordoma |journal=Cancer |volume=101 |issue=9 |pages=2086–97 |year=2004 |pmid=15372471 |doi=10.1002/cncr.20618}}</ref> The same group in Italy found that the combination of imatinib and [[sirolimus]] caused a response in several patients whose tumors progressed on imatinib alone.

==Notable cases==
Former NFL player [[Craig Heyward]] was treated for a chordoma in 1998.  While initially thought to be successfully removed, the tumor returned in 2005, and caused Heyward's death in May 2006.

Josh Sommer, a student researcher at [[Duke University]], created the Chordoma Foundation with his mother, Simone Sommer, after his diagnosis.<ref name="titleCollege student fights his own cancer - Yahoo! News"/>  The Chordoma Foundation has hosted three International Chordoma Research Workshops which together assembled over 100 leading scientists and physicians, many of whom were new to the field of chordoma research. The Foundation has also collected and distributed chordoma cell lines for research into the cancer's molecular cause and possible treatments.<ref name="titleThe Chordoma Foundation | History and Accomplishments">{{cite web |url=http://www.chordomafoundation.org/about/history.aspx |title=The Chordoma Foundation History and Accomplishments |accessdate=2008-02-20 |format= |work=}}</ref>

Pro skateboarder Ray Underhill, a member of the Powell-Peralta [[Bones Brigade]], battled chordoma for two years before succumbing to his disease in August 2008.

[[Cary Tennis]], the popular advice columnist for [[Salon.com]], announced in his column of November 19, 2009, that he had been diagnosed with a chordoma.
