Approximately 98% of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]], or tumors derived from transformed cells of [[epithelial]] lineage.<ref name='TravisTravis'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, Travis LB, Devesa SS |title=Lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=191–202 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=8000996 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y}}</ref> Currently, nearly four dozen different histopathological variants of lung carcinoma are recognized.<ref name="who2004"/> For clinical and treatment purposes, however, most [[oncologists]] tend to classify lung carcinomas into two major groups, namely [[small cell carcinoma]] (SCLC) and [[non-small cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC). This is done because of differing responses to treatment — NSCLC is comparatively less sensitive to chemotherapy and/or radiation, so surgery is the treatment of choice in these tumors. SCLC, in contrast, usually initially responds well to chemotherapy and/or radiation, but has usually [[metastasized]] widely by the time it is discovered, making surgery ineffective.

In a 2010 study of patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer, "early [[palliative care]] led to significant improvements in both quality of life and mood.  As compared with patients receiving standard care, patients receiving early palliative care had less aggressive care at the end of life but longer survival" which was increased by approximately 3 months.<ref name="PMID 20818875"/>

==Surgery==

In most cases, the goal of lung cancer surgery is to remove the entire tumor, including a small amount of normal tissue (about 2&nbsp;cm) at the margin. The general name for surgery that enters the chest is [[thoracotomy]], and specific named types of surgical interventions may be performed as part of the thoracotomy, such as [[wedge resection]], [[segmentectomy]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Kling, Jim |title=Lung-Sparing Surgery Effective for Early-Stage Lung Cancer |date=5 November 2010 |publisher=Medscape Medical News |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/732023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Gale, Karla |title=Lung Cancer Outcomes Similar With Anatomic Segmentectomy and Lobectomy |date=2 November 2010 |publisher=Reuters Health Information |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731801}}</ref> "sleeve resection", [[lobectomy]], or [[pneumonectomy]], depending on the tumor and patient characteristics.

Surgery is very rarely used in cases of stage 3b or stage 4 non-small cell lung carcinoma.<ref name="emedicine.medscape.com">{{EMedicine|article|279960|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment & Management|treatment}}</ref>

==Chemotherapy==
In patients with stage 3 lung cancer that cannot be removed, treatment with combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy improves survival significantly.<ref name="emedicine.medscape.com"/>

=== Targeted therapy ===
{{Main|Targeted therapy of lung cancer}}
In recent years, various [[molecularly targeted therapy|molecular targeted therapies]] have been developed for the treatment of advanced lung cancer. [[Gefitinib]] (Iressa; withdrawn from the U.S. market) is one such drug, which targets the [[tyrosine kinase]] domain of the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), expressed in many cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma. It was not shown to increase survival, although females, Asians, nonsmokers, and those with [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]] appear to derive the most benefit from gefitinib.<ref name="Raz">{{Cite journal | last=Raz | first=DJ | coauthors=He B, Rosell R, Jablons DM | title=Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: a review | journal=Clinical Lung Cancer | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=313–322 | month=March | year=2006 | pmid=16640802 | doi=10.3816/CLC.2006.n.012 }}</ref><ref name="Bencardino">{{Cite journal | last=Bencardino | first=K | coauthors=Manzoni M, Delfanti S et al. | title=Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer: results and open issues | journal=Internal and Emergency Medicine | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=3–12 | month=March | year=2007 | pmid=17551677 | doi=10.1007/s11739-007-0002-5 | pmc=2780603 }}</ref>
