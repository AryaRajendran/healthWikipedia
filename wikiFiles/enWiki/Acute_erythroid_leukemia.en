'''Acute erythroid leukemia''' (or "acute Di Guglielmo syndrome") is a rare form of [[acute myeloid leukemia]] where the [[myeloproliferation]] is of [[erythroblast]]ic precursors.

It is defined at type "M6" under the [[Acute myelogenous leukemia#French-American-British .28FAB.29 classification|FAB classification]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/cancer/leukemia/conditions/aml/signs.html |title=Acute Myeloid Leukemia – Signs and Symptoms }}</ref>

==Types==
Acute erythroid leukemias can be classified as follows:
* M6a; Erythroleukemia: Both Erythroid/Myeloid neoplastic proliferation

* M6b; Pure erythroid leukemia

==Criteria for diagnosis of M6==
=== M6a (Erythroleukemia) ===

50% or more of all nucleated bone marrow cells are erythroblasts, Dyserythropoiesis is prominent and 20% or more of the remaining cells (non- erythroid) are myeloblasts.

=== M6b (Pure erythroid leukemia) ===

In rare cases the erythroid lineage is the only obvious component of an acute [[leukemia]]; a [[myeloblast]] component is not apparent. The erythroid component consists predominantly or exclusively of proerythroblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts. These cells may constitute 90% or more of the marrow elements. Despite this lack of myeloblasts, these cases should be considered acute leukemias. In a WHO proposal the blastic leukemias that are limited to the erythroid series are designated pure erythroid malignancies.

=== M6c (Erythroleukemia and Pure erythroid leukemia) ===

Myeloblast- and proerythroblast-rich mixed variant.

==Treatment==
Treatment for erythroleukemia consists of [[chemotherapy]], frequently consisting of
[[cytarabine]], [[daunorubicin]], and [[idarubicin]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|199965|Erythroleukemia |treatment}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Acute erythroid leukemia (M6) has a relatively poor prognosis, with median survival for erythroleukemia patients of 36 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Santos FP, Faderl S, Garcia-Manero G, ''et al.'' |title=Adult acute erythroleukemia: an analysis of 91 patients treated at a single institution |journal=Leukemia |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=2275–80 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19741728 |doi=10.1038/leu.2009.181 |url=http://www.nature.com/leu/journal/v23/n12/abs/leu2009181a.html}}</ref> The 36 week prognosis is due to the rareness of M6b. 

When looked at separately, prognosis comes back a little differently (survival, mean ± sd) : M6B (3 ± 3.6 months) versus M6A (25 ± 28 months), and M6C (10 ± 13 months).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kowal-Vern A, Mazzella FM, Cotelingam JD, Shrit MA, Rector JT, Schumacher HR |title=Diagnosis and characterization of acute erythroleukemia subsets by determining the percentages of myeloblasts and proerythroblasts in 69 cases |journal=Am.

==In pregnancy==
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.<ref name=Shapira />  How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia.  Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of [[pregnancy loss]] and [[birth defect]]s, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive [[first trimester]].<ref name=Shapira>{{cite journal
