'''Abdominal pain''' (or '''stomach ache''') is a common [[symptom]] associated with transient disorders or serious disease. Diagnosing the cause of abdominal pain can be difficult, because many diseases can cause this symptom. Most frequently the cause is benign and/or self-limiting, but more serious causes may require urgent intervention.

**[[irritable bowel syndrome]] (affecting up to 20% of the population, IBS is the most common cause of recurrent, intermittent abdominal pain)

===Acute abdominal pain===
[[Acute abdomen]] can be defined as severe, persistent abdominal pain of sudden onset that is likely to require [[surgery|surgical intervention]] to treat its cause. The pain may frequently be associated with [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[abdominal distention]], [[fever]] and signs of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. One of the most common conditions associated with acute abdominal pain is acute [[appendicitis]].

'''Selected causes of acute abdomen'''

*Traumatic : [[Blunt trauma|blunt]] or perforating [[physical trauma|trauma]] to the [[stomach]], [[bowel]], [[spleen]], [[liver]], or [[kidney]]
*Inflammatory :
** Infections such as [[appendicitis]], [[cholecystitis]], [[pancreatitis]], [[pyelonephritis]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], [[hepatitis]], [[mesenteric adenitis]], or a subdiaphragmatic [[abscess]]
** [[Gastrointestinal perforation|Perforation]] of a [[peptic ulcer]], a [[diverticulitis|diverticulum]], or the [[caecum]]
** Complications of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] such as [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]]
*Mechanical :
**[[Small bowel]] [[bowel obstruction|obstruction]] secondary to adhesions caused by previous surgeries, [[intussusception]], [[hernia]]s, benign or malignant [[neoplasia|neoplasm]]s
**[[Large bowel]] [[bowel obstruction|obstruction]] caused by [[colorectal cancer]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[volvulus]], [[fecal impaction]] or [[hernia]]
*Vascular : occlusive [[ischemic colitis|intestinal ischemia]], usually caused by [[thromboembolism]] of the [[superior mesenteric artery]]

==Diagnostic approach==
When a physician assesses a patient to determine the etiology and subsequent treatment for abdominal pain the patient's history of the presenting complaint and physical examination should derive a diagnosis in over 90% of cases.

It is important also for a physician to remember that abdominal pain can be caused by problems outside the abdomen, especially [[heart attacks]] and [[pneumonia]]s which can occasionally present as abdominal pain.

Investigations that would aid diagnosis include
*Blood tests including full blood count, [[electrolytes]], [[urea]], [[creatinine]], liver function tests, [[pregnancy test]], [[amylase]] and [[lipase]].
*[[Urinalysis]]
*Imaging including erect chest [[X-ray]] and plain films of the abdomen
*An [[electrocardiograph]] to rule out a heart attack which can occasionally present as abdominal pain

If diagnosis remains unclear after history, examination and basic investigations as above then more advanced investigations may reveal a diagnosis.  These as such would include
*[[Computed Tomography]] of the abdomen/pelvis
*Abdominal or pelvic [[ultrasound]]
*[[Endoscopy]] and [[colonoscopy]] (not used for diagnosing acute pain)

==Management==
[[Butylscopolamine]] (Buscopan) is used to treat cramping abdominal pain with some success.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tytgat GN |title=Hyoscine butylbromide: a review of its use in the treatment of abdominal cramping and pain |journal=Drugs |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=1343–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17547475 |doi= 10.2165/00003495-200767090-00007|url=}}</ref>
