'''Substance dependence''', commonly called '''[[drug]] [[addiction]]''', is a user's [[compulsive behavior|compulsive]] need to use [[drug]]s in order to function normally. When such substances are unobtainable, the user suffers from [[withdrawal]].<ref>[[National Institutes of Health]] website: "Drug dependence means that a person needs a drug to function normally. Abruptly stopping the drug leads to withdrawal symptoms. Drug addiction is the compulsive use of a substance, despite its negative or dangerous effects." http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002490/</ref>

The section about substance dependence in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (more specifically, the 2000 [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV-TR (2000)|"text revision", the DSM-IV-TR]]) does not use the word ''addiction'' at all. It explains:
<blockquote>When an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, substance dependence may be diagnosed. Compulsive and repetitive use may result in tolerance to the effect of the drug and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped. This, along with [[Substance abuse]] are considered [[Substance Use Disorders]]....<ref name="DSM4"/></blockquote>
This is far from the only way of defining the relevant terms, however (see "Defining terms" section below).

==Brief overview==
[[File:OCD handwash.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Discussions about drug addiction involve much discussion about [[Obsessive compulsive disorder|compulsive behaviors and disorders]].]]
Doug Sellman at the National Addiction Center offers what he calls "The 10 most important things to know about addiction".<ref name=Sellman>{{cite journal |author=Sellman D |title=The 10 most important things known about addiction |journal=Addiction |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=6–13 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=19712126 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02673.x }}</ref> He offers the following points, before explaining them in more detail (although even his full paper does not presume to be able to discuss all the important facts about addiction). First, Sellman says that the most important thing to know about addiction may be that addiction is "fundamentally about [[compulsive behavior]]".<ref name=Sellman/> Second of all, such habits originate outside of [[consciousness]] (i.e. from the [[unconscious mind]]). The compulsive sequence of behaviors are so practiced that they can be extremely difficult to avoid initiating, and even harder to interrupt. Sellman maintains, thirdly, that addiction is 50% [[heritable]]. In other words, family background and [[genetics]] play a large role (see also [[Nature versus Nurture]]).

The fourth most important thing is that people with addictions often have other psychiatric problems (e.g. [[psychiatric disorders]]), which can complicate matters. Next, fifth, Sellman explains that addiction is characterized by frequent [[relapse]], and that one should not expect to overcome addiction on the first try. The sixth point he makes is that the different forms of [[psychotherapy]] all produce similar results that may be based on what is common between them (i.e. a strong bond with a trusted friend). Sellman's seventh most important thing about addiction is that ‘come back when you're motivated’ is an inappropriate approach to addiction.<ref name=Sellman/> Individuals have very specific problems, and so it is important to find ways to engage the addicted individual (Sellman describes how [[empathy]] is crucial, for example). His next, eighth point expands on this idea: Sellman says that doctors should apply as broad an approach to the individual as possible. This means combining various rejuvenating approaches, including [[prescription drugs]], family therapy, social and legal support, providing accommodations, and more. The ninth important thing about addiction is that [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanies]] are rare - even though they are the most popular kind of story to spread.

The tenth, and final important thing that Sellman explains is that change takes time (months or years of failing and trying again). He advocates for the importance of patience and persistence in practicing new behaviors over long periods of time. He concludes by appealing to all professionals involved in combating addiction; he asks that they all work together - because the combined knowledge of all fields is what is required.<ref name=Sellman/>

==Defining terms==
According to the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV), substance dependence is defined as:
<blockquote>When an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, substance dependence may be diagnosed. Compulsive and repetitive use may result in tolerance to the effect of the drug and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped. This, along with [[Substance abuse|Substance Abuse]] are considered Substance Use Disorders....<ref name="DSM4">[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/subdep.htm DSM-IV & DSM-IV-TR:Substance Dependence]</ref></blockquote>
Substance dependence can be diagnosed with [[Physical dependence|physiological dependence]], evidence of tolerance or withdrawal, or without physiological dependence.

By the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] definition, drug addiction differs from [[drug dependence]] and [[drug tolerance]].<ref name=painmed>[http://www.painmed.org/pdf/definition.pdf 2001 "Definitions Related to the Use of Opioids for the Treatment of Pain,"], the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Pain Society, and the American Society of Addiction Medicine</ref>  It is, both among scientists and other writers, quite usual to allow the concept of drug addiction to include persons who are not drug abusers according to the definition of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. The term drug addiction is then used as a category which may include the same persons who, under the [[DSM-IV]], can be given the diagnosis of substance dependence or [[substance abuse]]. (See also [[DSM-IV Codes]])

The terms ''abuse'' and ''addiction'' have been defined and re-defined over the years. The 1957 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Expert Committee on Addiction-Producing Drugs defined addiction and habituation as components of [[drug abuse]]:
<blockquote>'''Drug addiction''' is a state of periodic or chronic intoxication produced by the repeated consumption of a drug (natural or synthetic). Its characteristics include: (i) an overpowering desire or need (compulsion) to continue taking the drug and to obtain it by any means; (ii) a tendency to increase the dose; (iii) a psychic (psychological) and generally a [[physical dependence]] on the effects of the drug; and (iv) detrimental effects on the individual and on society.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Drug habituation (habit) is a condition resulting from the repeated consumption of a drug. Its characteristics include (i) a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being which it engenders; (ii) little or no tendency to increase the dose; (iii) some degree of psychic dependence on the effect of the drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an abstinence syndrome [withdrawal], and (iv) detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual.
</blockquote>

In 1964, a new WHO committee found these definitions to be inadequate, and suggested using the blanket term "drug dependence":
<blockquote>The definition of addiction gained some acceptance, but confusion in the use of the terms addiction and habituation and misuse of the former continued. Further, the list of drugs abused increased in number and diversity. These difficulties have become increasingly apparent and various attempts have been made to find a term that could be applied to drug abuse generally. The component in common appears to be dependence, whether psychic or physical or both. Hence, use of the term "drug dependence", with a modifying phase linking it to a particular drug type in order to differentiate one class of drugs from another, had been given most careful consideration. The Expert Committee recommends substitution of the term "drug dependence" for the terms "drug addiction" and "drug habituation".</blockquote>

The committee did not clearly define dependence, but did go on to clarify that there was a distinction between physical and psychological ("psychic") dependence. It said that drug abuse was "a state of psychic dependence or physical dependence, or both, on a drug, arising in a person following administration of that drug on a periodic or continued basis." Psychic dependence was defined as a state in which "there is a feeling of satisfaction and psychic drive that requires periodic or continuous administration of the drug to produce pleasure or to avoid discomfort" and all drugs were said to be capable of producing this state:
<blockquote>There is scarcely any agent which can be taken into the body to which some individuals will not get a reaction satisfactory or pleasurable to them, persuading them to continue its use even to the point of abuse – that is, to excessive or persistent use beyond medical need.</blockquote>

The 1957 and 1964 definitions of addiction, dependence and abuse persist to the present day in medical literature. It should be noted that at this time (2006) the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) now spells out specific criteria for defining abuse and dependence. (DSM-IV-TR) uses the term substance dependence instead of ''addiction''; a maladaptive pattern of substance abuse, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three (or more) specified criteria, occurring at any time in the same 12-month period. This definition is also applicable on drugs with smaller or nonexistent physical signs of withdrawal, e.g., cannabis.

In 2001, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the [[American Pain Society]], and the American Society of Addiction Medicine jointly issued "Definitions Related to the Use of Opioids for the Treatment of Pain", which defined the following terms:<ref name=painmed/>

<blockquote>'''Addiction''' is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[[Physical dependence]] is a state of being that is manifested by a drug class specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] is the body's physical adaptation to a drug: greater amounts of the drug are required over time to achieve the initial effect as the body "gets used to" and adapts to the intake.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'''Pseudo addiction''' is a term which has been used to describe patient behaviors that may occur when pain is undertreated. Patients with unrelieved pain may become focused on obtaining medications, may "clock watch," and may otherwise seem inappropriately "drug seeking." Even such behaviors as illicit drug use and deception can occur in the patient's efforts to obtain relief. Pseudoaddiction can be distinguished from true addiction in that the behaviors resolve when pain is effectively treated.</blockquote>

A definition of ''addiction'' proposed by professor [[Nils Bejerot]]:
<blockquote>An emotional fixation (sentiment) acquired through learning, which intermittently or continually expresses itself in purposeful, stereotyped behavior with the character and force of a natural drive, aiming at a specific pleasure or the avoidance of a specific discomfort.<ref name="NIDA">[http://www.nida.nih.gov/pdf/monographs/30.pdf Nils Bejerot in Theories of Drug abuse, Selected contemporary perspectives], page 246-255, [[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]], 1980</ref></blockquote>

==Causes==
Drugs known to cause addiction include both legal and illegal drugs as well as [[prescription drug|prescription]] or [[over-the-counter drug]]s, according to the definition of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

* [[Stimulant]]s (psychical addiction, moderate to severe; withdrawal is purely psychological and psychosomatic):
** [[Amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]]
** [[Cocaine]]
** [[Caffeine]]
** [[Nicotine]]
* [[Sedative]]s and [[hypnotic]]s (psychical addiction, mild to severe, and physiological addiction, severe; abrupt withdrawal may be fatal):
** [[Alcohol]]
** [[Barbiturate]]s
** [[Benzodiazepines]], particularly [[alprazolam]], [[flunitrazepam]], [[triazolam]], [[temazepam]], and [[nimetazepam]] [[Z-drug]]s like [[Zimovane]] have a similar effect in the body to Benzodiazepines.
** [[Methaqualone]] and the related [[quinazolinone]] sedative-hypnotics
* [[Opiate]] and [[opioid]] [[analgesics]] (psychical addiction, mild to severe, physiological addiction, mild to severe; abrupt withdrawal is unlikely to be fatal):
** [[Morphine]] and [[codeine]], the two naturally occurring opiate analgesics
** Semi-synthetic opiates, such as [[heroin]] (diacetylmorphine; morphine diacetate), [[oxycodone]], [[buprenorphine]], and [[hydromorphone]]
** Fully synthetic opioids, such as [[fentanyl]], [[meperidine]]/pethidine, and [[methadone]]
Addictive drugs also include a large number of substrates that are currently considered to have no medical value and are not available over the counter or by prescription.

Several theories of drug addiction exist, some of the main ones being genetic predisposition, the self-medication theory, and factors involved with social/economic development. There are strong associations between poverty and addiction.<ref>Galea, S., Nandi, A., & Vlahov, D. (2004). The social epidemiology of substance use. Epidemiologic Reviews, 26, 36–52.</ref> It has long been established that genetic factors along with social and psychological factors are contributors to addiction. A common theory along these lines is the self-medication hypotheses. Epidemiological studies estimate that genetic factors account for 40–60% of the risk factors for alcoholism. Similar rates of heritability for other types of drug addiction have been indicated by other studies.<ref name=Kendler94/> Knestler hypothesized in 1964 that a gene or group of genes might contribute to predisposition to addiction in several ways. For example, altered levels of a normal protein due to environmental factors could then change the structure or functioning of specific brain circuits during development. These altered brain circuits could change the susceptibility of an individual to an initial drug use experience. In support of this hypothesis, animal studies have shown that environmental factors such as stress can affect an animal's genotype.<ref name=Kendler94>{{cite journal |author=Kendler KS, Neale MC, Heath AC, Kessler RC, Eaves LJ |title=A twin-family study of alcoholism in women |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=5 |pages=707–15 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=8166312 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=151&page=707}}</ref>

===Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS/PBWS)===
Some individuals, for various unknown genetic reasons, may perhaps experience a post acute withdrawal syndrome.    This involves a persistent set of physical and psychological symptoms that can be quite painful to deal with on a persistent and consistent basis.   Symptoms vary and are often unique to each individual.  Alcohol and many recreational or prescribed medications (controlled substances) can lead to this phenomenon.   One of the worst syndromes, as described in "The Ashton Manual" by Dr. Ashton and also by Malcolm Lader, MD, PhD, is protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome (PBWS).   Symptoms, painful albeit, can persist for some individuals for years (sometimes longer than six years) after drug cessation.  Currently, there is no treatment available for PBWS, except time.   Although, Lader and Borg conducted studies on the use of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil for those past the acute phase of withdrawal (suffering chronically from PBWS).   Their conclusions determined that further studies are needed.   Dr. Lader stated that it is often harder to get a patient off a benzodiazepine than it is for heroin.   Additionally, tranquilizer withdrawal (benzodiazepine withdrawal) can indeed be deadly.   That said, cold turkey benzodiazepine cessation is not encouraged and proper education surrounding sobriety needs to be understood before attempting sobriety form a benzodiazepine.

===Iatrogenic Versus Recreational Dependence===
Often, with [[benzodiazepine]]s, malprescribing regimens (malpractice albeit) are involved with benzodiazepine chemical dependency.   Not uncommonly, patients are placed on benzodiazepines for too long or for 'off label' reasons only to find themselves severely chemically dependent on their prescribed medications (iatrogenic dependence).    Controversy surrounding the notion that a patient's withdrawal symptoms are indeed that when tolerance happens or withdrawal begins, versus a return of perhaps the symptoms they originally had, which led to their prescribing regimen.  Clearly, enough evidence exists today to demonstrate that malprescribing regimens of benzodiazepines often causes more harm than good.   

===Addictive potential===
The addictive potential of a drug varies from substance to substance, and from individual to individual. Dose, frequency, pharmacokinetics of a particular substance, route of administration, and time are critical factors for developing a drug addiction.

An article in ''[[The Lancet]]'' compared the harm and addiction of 20 drugs, using a scale from 0 to 3 for physical addiction, psychological addiction, and pleasure to create a mean score for addiction. A [[caffeine]] control was not included in the study. Selected results can be seen in the chart below.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nutt King, Saulsbury , Blakemore  | year = 2007 | title = Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9566| pages = 1047–53 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4 | pmid = 17382831 }}</ref>

The use of ecstasy can become very addictive and cause severe addiction. "The serotonin system, which is compromised by MDMA, is fundamental to the brain's integration of information and emotion," says Dr. Alan I. Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health, which funded the research. "At the very least, people who take MDMA, even just a few times, are risking long-term, perhaps permanent, problems with learning and memory." The researchers found that the nerve cells (neurons) damaged by MDMA are those that use the chemical serotonin to communicate with other neurons.<ref>http://www.narconon.org/drug-information/ecstasy-addiction.html</ref> MDMA effectively blocks the re-uptake of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, increasing their levels in the [[synapse|synaptic gap]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Canadian Institute of Health Research |title=How Drugs Affect Neurotransmitters |url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/i/i_03/i_03_m/i_03_m_par/i_03_m_par_ecstasy.html |publisher=McGill U}}</ref> Through prolonged use, like many other drugs, the brain may recognize the higher levels and start producing less of its own, building a tolerance and possibly addiction. MDMA has also been linked to [[serotonin syndrome]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Self-medication hypotheses===
Espoused by both psychoanalysts and biological researchers, self-medication hypotheses predict that certain individuals abuse drugs in an attempt to self-medicate their unique and seemingly intolerable states of mind.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khantzian EJ |title=The self-medication hypothesis of addictive disorders: focus on heroin and cocaine dependence |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=11 |pages=1259–64 |year=1985 |month=November |pmid=3904487 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=142&page=1259}}</ref> The self-medication theory has a long history. Freud in 1884, first raised this concept in noting the anti-depressing properties of cocaine. Stress has long been recognized as a major contributor for drug cravings and relapse and is therefore supportive of the self-medication theory. In line with this theory, a person's use of a particular drug of choice is not an accident, but rather it is chosen for its pharmacological effect in relieving stressful symptoms or unwanted feelings. Research has shown that people who survive disasters are prone to stress-related disorders such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and depression. People who experience major trauma in their life may self-medicate with alcohol or other drugs to relieve the symptoms of PTSD and depression.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vlahov D, Galea S, Resnick H, ''et al.'' |title=Increased use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana among Manhattan, New York, residents after the September 11th terrorist attacks |journal=Am. J. Epidemiol. |volume=155 |issue=11 |pages=988–96 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12034577 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12034577}}</ref>

===Social development===
Social development  and adjustment factors also play a role in drug abuse and addiction. An assumption of the developmental  perspective, as mentioned by Thornberry 1987, is that the course of one's life is a process in which life circumstances change, milestones are met or missed and new social roles are created while old ones are abandoned. There are well known and widely accepted norms about when certain developmental events should happen in a person's life. Studies of the social factors involved in drug use have mostly focused either on adolescence or young adulthood, but surprisingly a significant amount of cocaine users may not initiate use until middle adulthood. The majority of people enter into adult social roles on schedule. However, some people enter these roles earlier or later than their same-age peers. The developmental perspective predicts that this will lead to less than satisfactory adjustment and possibly negative consequences including drug and alcohol dependence.<ref>Neugarten & Datan, (1973); Elder, (1975).

==Pathophysiology==
Researchers have conducted numerous investigations using animal models and functional brain imaging on humans in order to define the mechanisms underlying drug addiction in the brain. Changes to several areas of the brain are thought to be involved.

===Acute effects===
Acute (or [[recreational drug use|recreational]]) use of most psychoactive drugs causes the release and prolonged action of [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] within the reward circuit. Different types of drugs produce these effects by different methods. [[Dopamine]] (DA) appears to harbor the largest effect and its action is characterized. DA binds to the [[D1 receptor]], triggering a signaling cascade within the cell. [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]] (PKA) phosphorylates [[cAMP response element binding protein]] (CREB), a transcription factor, which induces the transcription of certain genes including [[C-Fos]].<ref name="Kalivas and Volkow">{{cite journal |author=Kalivas PW, Volkow ND |title=The neural basis of addiction: a pathology of motivation and choice |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=8 |pages=1403–13 |year=2005 |pmid=16055761 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.8.1403}}</ref>

===Reward circuit===
When examining the biological basis of drug addiction, one must first understand the pathways in which drugs act and how drugs can alter those pathways. The [[reward system|reward circuit]], also referred to as the [[mesolimbic system]], is characterized by the interaction of several areas of the brain.
* The [[ventral tegmentum|ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) consists of [[dopaminergic]] [[neurons]] which respond to [[glutamate]]. These cells respond when stimuli indicative of a reward are present. The VTA supports learning and sensitization development and releases [[dopamine]] (DA) into the [[forebrain]].<ref name="Jones and Bonci">{{cite journal |author=Jones S, Bonci A |title=Synaptic plasticity and drug addiction |journal=Curr Opin Pharmacol |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=20–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15661621 |doi=10.1016/j.coph.2004.08.011}}</ref> These neurons also project and release DA into the nucleus accumbens,<ref name="Eisch and Harburg">{{cite journal |author=Eisch AJ, Harburg GC |title=Opiates, psychostimulants, and adult hippocampal neurogenesis: Insights for addiction and stem cell biology |journal=Hippocampus |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=271–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16411230 |doi=10.1002/hipo.20161}}</ref> through the [[mesolimbic pathway]]. Virtually all drugs causing drug addiction increase the dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway,<ref name=Rang>{{cite book |author=Rang, H. P. |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |pages=596 |isbn=0-443-07145-4}}</ref> in addition to their specific effects.
*The [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAcc) consists mainly of medium-spiny projection neurons (MSNs), which are [[GABA]] neurons.<ref name="Kourrich">{{cite journal |author=Kourrich S, Rothwell PE, Klug JR, Thomas MJ |title=Cocaine experience controls bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens |journal=J.

* The [[prefrontal cortex]], more specifically the [[anterior cingulate]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]] cortices,<ref name="Kalivas and Volkow"/> is important for the integration of information which contributes to whether a behavior will be elicited. It appears to be the area in which motivation originates and the salience of stimuli are determined.<ref name="Floresco">{{cite journal |author=Floresco SB, Ghods-Sharifi S |title=Amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuitry regulates effort-based decision making |journal=Cereb.

* The [[basolateral amygdala]] projects into the NAcc and is thought to be important for motivation as well.<ref name="Floresco"/>
* More evidence is pointing towards the role of the [[hippocampus]] in drug addiction because of its importance in learning and memory. Much of this evidence stems from investigations manipulating cells in the hippocampus alters dopamine levels in NAcc and firing rates of VTA dopaminergic cells.<ref name="Eisch and Harburg"/>

===Role of dopamine===
Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter of the reward circuit in the brain. It regulates movement, emotion, cognition, motivation, and feelings of pleasure.<ref name=arch>{{cite web|url=http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=794743|title=Dopamine in Drug Abuse and Addiction: Results of Imaging Studies and Treatment Implications}}</ref> Natural rewards, like eating, as well as recreational drug use cause a release of dopamine, and are associated with the reinforcing nature of these stimuli.<ref name=arch/><ref name=drugs-brain>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/science-addiction/drugs-brain|title=Drugs, Brains, and Behavior: The Science of Addiction}}</ref> Nearly all addictive drugs, directly or indirectly, act upon the brain’s reward system by flooding the circuit with dopamine.<ref name=addict>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/understand.html|title=Understanding Drug Abuse and Addiction}}</ref> When addictive drugs are abused, dopamine release can be two to ten-fold over what is released under "normal" conditions.<ref name=drugs-brain/> Since addictive drugs are perceived by the brain as being very rewarding, this can lead to repetitive behavior.

Individuals vulnerable to addiction (due to genetics, developmental or environmental factors) tend to use long-term.  Long-term abuse of drugs results in repeated release of high amounts of dopamine, which in turn affects the reward circuit in multiple ways.  Abnormally high levels of dopamine can block subsequent dopamine from binding and eave excess amounts of dopamine in the synapse.<ref name=drugs-brain/> In turn, the bombardment of the receptors by dopamine results in a down regulation of the receptors.  This is confirmed in PET imaging studies, which have found that drug addicts have reduced levels of dopamine receptors.  The down regulation of receptors results in a decrease in the sensitivity to natural reinforcers.<ref name=arch/> This is why individuals who are substance dependent lose interest in normal activities; these activities are no longer perceived as pleasurable.  Long-term drug use also results in the individual feeling normal rather than high.<ref name=arch/> In turn, drug abusers have to continuously increase the amount of drug they are using if they want to continue to feel normal or rewarded; this is referred to as [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]].

Another affect of long-term use is the loss of control, and their ability to make sound decisions.<ref name=arch/> Dopamine is also involved in the prediction of reward and may play a role in triggering cravings even to non-drug-related environmental stimuli.<ref name=arch/> Overall, continued use leads to dopamine [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]], which alters the circuitry of the brain and the reward system leading to altered behavior.  This can potentially lead to severely compromised long-term health and functioning of the person's brain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abovetheinfluence.com/facts/science-behind-addiction.aspx#|title=The Science Behind Drug Use and Addiction}}</ref>

Inherent differences in the dopamine system between individuals may also increase the vulnerability of some to become and addict.  Using PET imaging, it has been determined that individuals who already possess a reduced number of dopamine receptors are more likely to describe drug use as pleasurable than those who have more receptors.<ref name=arch/> So a high number of dopamine receptors may result in a natural aversion to drug use.<ref name=arch/>

===Stress response===
{{See also|Stress response}}
In addition to the reward circuit, it is hypothesized that stress mechanisms also play a role in addiction. Koob and Kreek have hypothesized that during drug use, the [[corticotropin-releasing hormone|corticotropin-releasing factor]] (CRF) activates the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) and other stress systems in the extended [[amygdala]]. This activation influences the dysregulated emotional state associated with drug addiction. They have found that as drug use escalates, so does the presence of CRF in human [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). In rat models, the separate use of CRF antagonists and CRF receptor antagonists both decreased self-administration of the drug of study. Other studies in this review showed a dysregulation in other hormones associated with the HPA axis, including [[enkephalin]] which is an endogenous [[opioid peptide]] that regulates pain. It also appears that the [[mu Opioid receptor|µ-opioid receptor]] system, which enkephalin acts on, is influential in the reward system and can regulate the expression of [[stress hormones]].<ref name="Koob and Kreek">{{cite journal |author=Boob G, Kreek MJ |title=Stress, Dysregulation of Drug Reward Pathways, and the Transition to Drug Dependence |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=8 |pages=1149–59 |year=2007 |pmid=17671276 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.05030503 |pmc=2837343}}</ref>

===Behavior===
Understanding how [[learning]] and [[behavior]] work in the [[reward circuit]] can help understand the action of addictive drugs. Drug addiction is characterized by strong, drug seeking behaviors in which the addict persistently craves and seeks out drugs, despite the knowledge of harmful consequences.<ref name="Kalivas and Volkow"/><ref name="Koob and Kreek"/> Addictive drugs produce a reward, which is the euphoric feeling resulting from sustained dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft of neurons in the brain. [[Operant conditioning]] is exhibited in drug addicts as well as laboratory mice, rats, and primates; they are able to associate an action or behavior, in this case seeking out the drug, with a reward, which is the effect of the drug.<ref name="Jones and Bonci"/> Evidence shows that this behavior is most likely a result of the synaptic changes which have occurred due to repeated drug exposure.<ref name="Kalivas and Volkow"/><ref name="Jones and Bonci"/><ref name="Koob and Kreek"/> The drug seeking behavior is induced by glutamatergic projections from the prefrontal cortex to the NAc. This idea is supported with data from experiments showing the drug seeking behavior can be prevented following the inhibition of [[AMPA]] glutamate receptors and glutamate release in the NAc.<ref name="Kalivas and Volkow"/>

===Allostasis===
[[Allostasis]] is the process of achieving stability through changes in behavior as well as physiological features. As a person progresses into drug addiction, he or she appears to enter a new allostatic state, defined as divergence from normal levels of change which persist in a chronic state. Addiction to drugs can cause damage to a brain and body as an organism enters the pathological state; the cost stemming from damage is known as allostatic load. The dysregulation of allostasis gradually occurs as the reward from the drug decreases and the ability to overcome the depressed state following drug use begins to decrease as well. The resulting allostatic load creates a constant state of depression relative to normal allostatic changes. What pushes this decrease is the propensity of drug users to take the drug before the brain and body have returned to original allostatic levels, producing a constant state of stress. Therefore, the presence of environmental stressors may induce stronger drug seeking behaviors.<ref name="Koob and Kreek"/>

===Neuroplasticity===
[[Neuroplasticity]] is the putative mechanism behind learning and memory. It involves physical changes in the synapses between two communicating neurons, characterized by increased gene expression, altered cell signaling, and the formation of new synapses between the communicating neurons. When addictive drugs are present in the system, they appear to hijack this mechanism in the reward system so that motivation is geared towards procuring the drug rather than natural rewards.<ref name="Jones and Bonci"/> Depending on the history of drug use, excitatory synapses in the [[nucleus accumbens]](NAcc) experience two types of neuroplasticity: [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) and [[long-term depression]] (LTD). Using mice as a model, Kourrich et al. showed that chronic exposure to cocaine increases the strength of synapses in NAc after a 10-14 day withdrawal period, while strengthened synapses did not appear within a 24 hour withdrawal period after repeated cocaine exposure. A single dose of cocaine did not elicit any attributes of a strengthened synapse. When drug-experienced mice were challenged with one dose of cocaine, synaptic depression occurred. Therefore, it seems the history of cocaine exposure along with withdrawal times affects the direction of glutamatergic plasticity in the NAc.<ref name="Kourrich"/>

Once a person has transitioned from drug use to addiction, behavior becomes completely geared towards seeking the drug, even though addicts report the euphoria is not as intense as it once was. Despite the differing actions of drugs during acute use, the final pathway of addiction is the same. Another aspect of drug addiction is a decreased response to normal biological stimuli, such as food, sex, and social interaction. Through functional brain imaging of patients addicted to cocaine, scientists have been able to visualize increased metabolic activity in the [[anterior cingulate]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (areas of the prefrontal cortex) in the brain of these subjects. The hyperactivity of these areas of the brain in addicted subjects is involved in the more intense motivation to find the drug rather than seeking natural rewards, as well as an addict's decreased ability to overcome this urge. Brain imaging has also shown cocaine-addicted subjects to have decreased activity, as compared to non-addicts, in their prefrontal cortex when presented with stimuli associated with natural rewards. The transition from recreational drug use to addiction occurs in gradual stages and is produced by the effect of the drug of choice on the neuroplasticity of the neurons found in the reward circuit. During events preceding addiction, cravings are produced by the release of dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex. As a person transitions from drug use to addiction, the release of DA in the NAcc becomes unnecessary to produce cravings; rather, DA transmission decreases while increased metabolic activity in the orbitofrontal cortex contributes to cravings. At this time a person may experience the signs of depression if cocaine is not used.<ref>AJ Giannini. Drug abuse and depression: Catecholamine depletion suggested as biological tie between cocaine withdrawal and depression. National Institute of Drug Abuse Notes. 2(2)5, 1987.</ref> Before a person becomes addicted and exhibits drug-seeking behavior, there is a time period in which the neuroplasticity is reversible. Addiction occurs when drug-seeking behavior is exhibited and the vulnerability to relapse persists, despite prolonged withdrawal; these behavioral attributes are the result of neuroplastic changes which are brought about by repeated exposure to drugs and are relatively permanent.<ref name="Kalivas and Volkow"/>

The exact mechanism behind a drug molecule's effect on synaptic plasticity is still unclear. However, neuroplasticity in glutamatergic projections seems to be a major result of repeated drug exposure. This type of synaptic plasticity results in LTP, which strengthens connections between two neurons; onset of this occurs quickly and the result is constant. In addition to glutamatergic neurons, dopaminergic neurons present in the VTA respond to glutamate and may be recruited earliest during neural adaptations caused by repeated drug exposure. As shown by Kourrich, et al., history of drug exposure and the time of withdrawal from last exposure appear to play an important role in the direction of plasticity in the neurons of the reward system.<ref name="Jones and Bonci"/>

An aspect of neuron development that may also play a part in drug-induced neuroplasticity is the presence of axon guidance molecules such as semaphorins and ephrins. After repeated cocaine treatment, altered expression (increase or decrease dependent on the type of molecule) of mRNA coding for axon guidance molecules occurred in rats. This may contribute to the alterations in the reward circuit characteristic of drug addiction.<ref name="Bahi and Dreyer">{{cite journal |author=Bahi A, Dreyer JL |title=Cocaine-induced expression changes of axon guidance molecules in the adult rat brain |journal=Mol. Cell. Neurosci. |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=275–91 |year=2005 |pmid=15691709 |doi=10.1016/j.mcn.2004.09.011}}</ref>

===Neurogenesis===
Drug addiction also raises the issue of potential harmful effects on the development of new neurons in adults. Eisch and Harburg raise three new concepts they have extrapolated from the numerous recent studies on drug addiction. First, [[neurogenesis]] decreases as a result of repeated exposure to addictive drugs. A list of studies show that chronic use of [[opiate]]s, [[psychostimulant]]s, nicotine, and alcohol decrease neurogenesis in mice and rats. Second, this apparent decrease in neurogenesis seems to be independent of HPA axis activation. Environmental factors other than drug exposure such as age, stress and exercise, can also have an effect on neurogenesis by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Mounting evidence suggests this for 3 reasons: small doses of opiates and psychostimulants increase corticosterone concentration in serum but with no effect of neurogenesis; although decreased neurogenesis is similar between self-administered and forced drug intake, activation of HPA axis is greater in self-administration subjects; and even after the inhibition of opiate induced increase of corticosterone, a decrease in neurogenesis occurred. These, of course, need to be investigated further. Last, addictive drugs appear to only affect proliferation in the [[neurogenesis|subgranular zone]] (SGZ), rather than other areas associated with neurogenesis. The studies of drug use and neurogenesis may have implications on stem cell biology.<ref name="Eisch and Harburg"/>

===Psychological drug tolerance===<!--Psychological drug tolerance redirects here-->
The reward system is partly responsible for the [[psychological]] part of [[drug tolerance]].

The [[CREB]] protein, a [[transcription factor]] activated by [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) immediately after a high, triggers [[gene]]s that produce proteins such as [[dynorphin]], which cuts off dopamine release and temporarily inhibits the reward circuit. In chronic drug users, a sustained activation of CREB thus forces a larger dose to be taken to reach the same effect. In addition it leaves the user feeling generally depressed and dissatisfied, and unable to find pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, often leading to a return to the drug for an additional "fix".<ref>AJ Giannini, RQ Quinones, DM Martin. Role of beta-endorphin and cAMP in addiction and mania. Society for Neuroscience Abstracts. 15:149, 1998.</ref>

A similar mechanism, interfering also with the dopamine system, but relying on a different transcription factor, [[CEBPB]], has also been proposed. In this case dopamine release onto the nucleus accumbens neurons would trigger the increased synthesis of [[substance P]] which, in turn, would increase the dopamine synthesis in the VTA. The effect of this positive feedback is suggested to be dampened by repeated substance abuse.<ref name="pmid16771829">{{cite journal | author = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Magistretti PJ, Halfon O, Cardinaux JR| title = C/EBPbeta couples dopamine signalling to substance P precursor gene expression in striatal neurones | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 1390–9 | year = 2006 | month = September | pmid = 16771829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03957.x | url =  }}</ref>

===Sensitization===<!--"Drug sensitization" redirects here, do not change without correcting the redirect-->
Sensitization is the increase in sensitivity to a drug after prolonged use. The proteins [[delta FosB]] and regulator of G-protein Signaling 9-2 ([[RGS9]]-2) are thought to be involved:

A transcription factor, known as delta FosB, is thought to activate genes that, counter to the effects of [[CREB]], actually increase the user's sensitivity to the effects of the substance. Delta FosB slowly builds up with each exposure to the drug and remains activated for weeks after the last exposure—long after the effects of CREB have faded. The hypersensitivity that it causes is thought to be responsible for the intense cravings associated with drug addiction, and is often extended to even the peripheral cues of drug use, such as related behaviors or the sight of drug paraphernalia. There is some evidence that delta FosB even causes structural changes within the [[nucleus accumbens]], which presumably helps to perpetuate the cravings, and may be responsible for the high incidence of relapses that occur in treated drug addicts.<ref name="pmid11572966">{{cite journal |author=Nestler EJ, Barrot M, Self DW |title=ΔFosB: A sustained molecular switch for addiction |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=98 |issue=20 |pages=11042–6 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11572966 |pmc=58680 |doi=10.1073/pnas.191352698}}</ref><ref name="pmid14746512">{{cite journal |author=Chao J, Nestler EJ |title=Molecular neurobiology of drug addiction |journal=Annual Review of Medicine |volume=55 |pages=113–32 |year=2004 |pmid=14746512 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.55.091902.103730}}</ref><ref name="pmid18552739">{{cite journal |author=Nestler EJ |title=The Neurobiology of Cocaine Addiction |journal=Science & Practice Perspectives / a Publication of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=4–10 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=18552739 |pmc=2851032}}</ref><ref name="pmid18184321">{{cite journal |author=Conversi D, Bonito-Oliva A, Orsini C, Colelli V, Cabib S |title=DeltaFosB accumulation in ventro-medial caudate underlies the induction but not the expression of behavioral sensitization by both repeated amphetamine and stress |journal=The European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=191–201 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18184321 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.06003.x}}</ref><ref name="pmid18293355">{{cite journal |author=Perrotti LI, Weaver RR, Robison B, Renthal W, Maze I, Yazdani S, Elmore RG, Knapp DJ, Selley DE, Martin BR, Sim-Selley L, Bachtell RK, Self DW, Nestler EJ |title=Distinct Patterns of ΔFosB Induction in Brain by Drugs of Abuse |journal= Synapse |volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=358–69 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18293355 |pmc=2667282 |doi=10.1002/syn.20500}}</ref><ref name="pmid18445218">{{cite journal |author=Nikulina EM, Arrillaga-Romany I, Miczek KA, Hammer RP |title=Long-lasting alteration in mesocorticolimbic structures after repeated social defeat stress in rats: time course of μ-opioid receptor mRNA and FosB/ΔFosB immunoreactivity |journal=The European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=2272–84 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18445218 |pmc=2442756 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06176.x}}</ref><ref name="pmid18842886">{{cite journal |author=Wallace DL, Vialou V, Rios L, Carle-Florence TL, Chakravarty S, Kumar A, Graham DL, Green TA, Kirk A, Iñiguez SD, Perrotti LI, Barrot M, DiLeone RJ, Nestler EJ, Bolaños-Guzmán CA |title=The influence of ΔFOSB in the Nucleus Accumbens on natural reward-related behavior |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=41 |pages=10272–7 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid= 18842886 |pmc=2653197 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1531-08.2008}}</ref><ref name="pmid18640924">{{cite journal |author=Nestler EJ |title=Transcriptional mechanisms of addiction: role of ΔFosB |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Regulator of G-protein Signaling 9-2 (RGS9-2) has recently been the subject of several animal knockout studies. Animals lacking RGS9-2 appear to have increased sensitivity to dopamine receptor agonists such as cocaine and amphetamines; over-expression of RGS9-2 causes a lack of responsiveness to these same agonists. RGS9-2 is believed to catalyze inactivation of the G-protein coupled D2 receptor by enhancing the rate of GTP hydrolysis of the G alpha subunit which transmits signals into the interior of the cell.<ref name= "pmid15632124">{{cite journal |author=Garzón J, Rodríguez-Muñoz M, López-Fando A, Sánchez-Blázquez P |title=Activation of mu-opioid receptors transfers control of Galpha subunits to the regulator of G-protein signaling RGS9-2: role in receptor desensitization |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=280 |issue=10 |pages=8951–60 |year=2005 |month= March |pmid=15632124 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M407005200}}</ref><ref name="pmid15728856">{{cite journal |author=Kovoor A, Seyffarth P, Ebert J, Barghshoon S, Chen CK, Schwarz S, Axelrod JD, Cheyette BN, Simon MI, Lester HA, Schwarz J |title=D2 dopamine receptors colocalize regulator of G-protein signaling 9-2 (RGS9-2) via the RGS9 DEP domain, and RGS9 knock-out mice develop dyskinesias associated with dopamine pathways |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=2157–65 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15728856 |doi= 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2840-04.2005}}</ref><ref name="pmid15829256">{{cite journal |author=Garzón J, Rodríguez-Muñoz M, Sánchez-Blázquez P |title=Morphine alters the selective association between mu-opioid receptors and specific RGS proteins in mouse periaqueductal gray matter |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=853–68 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid= 15829256 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2005.01.004}}</ref><ref name="pmid16510730">{{cite journal |author=Bouhamdan M, Yan HD, Yan XH, Bannon MJ, Andrade R |title=Brain-specific regulator of G-protein signaling 9-2 selectively interacts with alpha-actinin-2 to regulate calcium-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=2522–30 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16510730 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4083-05.2006}}</ref><ref name= "pmid17493623">{{cite journal |author=Silverman JL, Koenig JI |title=Evidence for Involvement of ERβ and RGS9-2 in 17-β Estradiol Enhancement of Amphetamine-Induced Place Preference Behavior |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=146–55 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17493623 |pmc=2096711 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.017}}</ref><ref name="pmid17880927">{{cite journal |author=Hooks SB, Martemyanov K, Zachariou V |title=A role of RGS proteins in drug addiction |journal=[[Biochemical Pharmacology]] |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=76–84 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17880927 |doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2007.07.045}}</ref><ref name="pmid19098104">{{cite journal |author=Martemyanov KA, Krispel CM, Lishko PV, Burns ME, Arshavsky VY |title=Functional comparison of RGS9 splice isoforms in a living cell |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=52 |pages=20988–93 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19098104 |pmc=2634932 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0808941106}}</ref><ref name="pmid19211160">{{cite journal |author= Traynor JR, Terzi D, Caldarone BJ, Zachariou V |title=RGS9-2: probing an intracellular modulator of behavior as a drug target |journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=105–11 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19211160 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2008.11.006}}</ref>

===Individual mechanisms of effect===
The basic mechanisms by which different substances activate the [[reward system]] are as described above, but vary slightly among drug classes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller NS, Giannini AJ |title=The disease model of addiction: a biopsychiatrist's view |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=83–5 |year=1990 |pmid=2324867}}</ref>

;Depressants
[[Depressant]]s such as [[alcohol]], [[barbiturate]]s, and [[benzodiazepine]]s work by increasing the affinity of the GABA receptor for its ligand; GABA. [[Narcotic]]s such as [[morphine]] and [[heroin]] work by mimicking [[endorphin]]s—chemicals produced naturally by the body which have effects similar to dopamine—or by disabling the [[neuron]]s that normally inhibit the release of dopamine in the reward system. These substances (sometimes called "downers") typically facilitate relaxation and pain relief.

;Stimulants
[[Stimulant]]s such as [[amphetamine]]s, [[nicotine]], and [[cocaine]] increase dopamine signaling in the reward system either by directly stimulating its release, or by blocking its absorption (see "[[Reuptake]]"). These substances (sometimes called "uppers") typically cause heightened alertness and energy. They cause a pleasant feeling in the body and euphoria, known as a high. Once this high wears off, the user may feel depressed. This  makes them want another dose of the drug, and can worsen the addiction.

==Management==
{{Weasel|date=June 2011}}
Addiction is a complex but treatable disease. It is characterized by compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use that persists even if the user is aware of severe adverse consequences. For some people, addiction becomes chronic, having periodic relapses even after long periods of abstinence. As a chronic, relapsing disease, addiction may require continued treatments to increase the intervals between relapses and diminish their intensity. While some with substance issues recover and lead fulfilling lives, others require ongoing additional support. The ultimate goal of addiction treatment is to enable an individual to manage their substance misuse; for some this may mean abstinence. Immediate goals are often to reduce substance abuse, improve the patient's ability to function, and minimize the medical and social complications of substance abuse and their addiction this is called Harm Reduction.

Treatments for addiction vary widely according to the types of drugs involved, amount of drugs used, duration of the drug addiction, medical complications and the social needs of the individual. Determining the best type of recovery program for an addicted person depends on a number of factors, including: personality, drug(s) of choice, concept of spirituality or religion, mental or physical illness, and local availability and affordability of programs.

Many different ideas circulate regarding what is considered a "successful" outcome in the recovery from addiction. Programs that emphasize controlled drinking exist for alcohol addiction. Opiate replacement therapy has been a medical standard of treatment for opioid addiction for many years.

Treatments and attitudes toward addiction vary widely among different countries. In the USA and developing countries, the goal of commissioners of treatment for drug dependence is generally total abstinence from all drugs. Other countries, particularly in Europe, argue the aims of treatment for drug dependence are more complex, with treatment aims including reduction in use to the point that drug use no longer interferes with normal activities such as work and family commitments; shifting the addict away from more dangerous routes of drug administration such as injecting to safer routes such as oral administration; reduction in crime committed by drug addicts; and treatment of other comorbid conditions such as [[AIDS]], [[hepatitis]] and [[mental health disorder]]s. These kinds of outcomes can be achieved without eliminating drug use completely. Drug treatment programs in Europe often report more favourable outcomes than those in the USA because the criteria for measuring success are functional rather than abstinence-based.<ref name="Ball and van de Wijngaart">{{cite journal |author=Ball JC, van de Wijngaart GF |title=A Dutch addict's view of methadone maintenance—an American and a Dutch appraisal |journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=799–802; discussion 803–14 |year=1994 |pmid=8081178 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1994.tb00974.x}}</ref><ref name="Reynolds">{{cite journal |author=Reynolds M, Mezey G, Chapman M, Wheeler M, Drummond C, Baldacchino A |title=Co-morbid post-traumatic stress disorder in a substance misusing clinical population |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=251–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15734225 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.08.017}}</ref><ref name="Moggi">{{cite journal |author=Moggi F, Giovanoli A, Strik W, Moos BS, Moos RH |title=Substance use disorder treatment programs in Switzerland and the USA: Program characteristics and 1-year outcomes |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=75–83 |year=2007 |pmid=16782286 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.05.017}}</ref> The supporters of programs with total abstinence from drugs as a goal believe that enabling further drug use just means prolonged drug use and risks an increase in addiction and complications from addiction.<ref name="Nils Bejerot">[http://www.rns.se/swedish-addiction.asp Nils Bejerot: Swedish addiction epidemic in an international perspective, 1988]</ref>

It is occasionally sometimes difficult to convince people with substance dependencies to engage in any form of treatment.  Family Interventions have been highly successful in helping these people accept help they need.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Residential===
Residential drug treatment can be broadly divided into two camps: 12 step programs or Therapeutic Communities. 12 step programs have the advantage of coming with an instant social support network, though some find the spiritual context not to their taste. In the UK drug treatment is generally moving towards a more integrated approach with rehabs offering a variety of approaches. These other programs may use a [[Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy]] approach, such as [[SMART Recovery]], that looks at the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviors, recognizing that a change in any of these areas can affect the whole. CBT sees addiction as a behavior rather than a disease and subsequently curable, or rather, unlearnable. CBT programs recognize that for some individuals controlled use is a more realistic possibility.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Alexithymia, affective disorders and substance abuse: possible cross-relationships |journal=Psychol Rep |volume=78 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=1389–90 |year=1996 |month=June |pmid=8816054 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1996.78.3c.1389}}</ref>

One of many recovery methods is the [[Twelve-step program|12 step recovery program]], with prominent examples including [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], [[Narcotics Anonymous]], Drug Addicts Anonymous<ref>[http://www.drugaddictsanonymous.org.uk/ DAA/UK]</ref> and [[Pills Anonymous]]. They are commonly known and used for a variety of addictions for the individual addicted and the family of the individual. [[Substance-abuse rehabilitation]] (or "rehab") centers offer a residential treatment program for some of more seriously addicted in order to isolate the patient from drugs and interactions with other users and dealers. Outpatient clinics usually offer a combination of individual [[counseling]] and group counseling. Frequently a physician or psychiatrist will assist, with [[pharmacology|prescriptions]], the side effects of the addiction. Medications can help immensely with anxiety and insomnia, can treat underlying mental disorders (cf. Self-medication hypothesis, Khantzian 1997) such as (manic-)depression, and can help reduce or eliminate withdrawal symptomology when withdrawing from physiologically addictive drugs. Some examples are using [[benzodiazepines]] for alcohol detoxification, which prevents [[delirium tremens]] and complications; using a slow taper of [[benzodiazepines]] or a taper of [[phenobarbital]], sometimes including another [[antiepileptic]] agent such as [[gabapentin]], [[pregabalin]], or [[valproate]], for withdrawal from barbiturates or benzodiazepines; using drugs such as [[baclofen]] to reduce cravings and propensity for relapse amongst addicts to any drug, especially effective in stimulant users, and alcoholics (in which it is nearly as effective as benzodiazepines in preventing complications); using [[clonidine]], a [[benzodiazepine]], and [[loperamide]] for opioid detoxification, for first-time users or those who wish to attempt an abstinence-based recovery (90% of opioid users relapse to active addiction within 8 months and/or are "multiple relapse patients"); or replacing an opioid that is interfering with or destructive to a user's life, such as illicitly-obtained [[heroin]], [[Dilaudid]], or [[oxycodone]], with an opioid that can be administered legally, reduces or eliminates drug cravings, and does not produce a high, such as [[methadone]] or [[buprenorphine]] - [[opiate replacement therapy|opioid replacement therapy]] - which is the gold standard for treatment of opioid dependence in developed countries, reducing the risk and cost to both user and society more effectively than any other treatment modality (for opioid dependence), and shows the best short-term and long-term gains for the user, with the greatest longevity, least risk of fatality, greatest quality of life, and lowest risk of relapse and/or legal issues including arrest and incarceration.

Substitute drugs for other forms of drug dependence have historically been less successful than opioid substitute treatment, but some limited success has been seen with drugs such as [[dextroamphetamine]] to treat stimulant addiction,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mattick RP, Darke S |title=Drug replacement treatments: is amphetamine substitution a horse of a different colour? |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=389–94 |year=1995 |pmid=16203339 |doi=10.1080/09595239500185531}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=White R |title=Dexamphetamine substitution in the treatment of amphetamine abuse: an initial investigation |journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=229–38 |year=2000 |pmid=10723851 |doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.2000.9522299.x}}</ref> and [[clomethiazole]] to treat alcohol addiction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Majumdar SK |title= Chlormethiazole: current status in the treatment of the acute ethanol withdrawal syndrome |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=201–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1884662 |doi=10.1016/0376-8716(91)90001-F}}</ref> [[Bromocriptine]] and [[desipramine]] have been reported to be effective for  treatment of cocaine but not amphetamine addiction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ, Billett W |title=Bromocriptine-desipramine protocol in treatment of cocaine addiction |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=549–54 |year=1987 |month=August |pmid=3308977}}</ref>

Other pharmacological treatments for alcohol addiction include drugs like [[naltrexone]], [[disulfiram]], [[acamprosate]] and [[topiramate]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soyka M, Roesner S |title=New pharmacological approaches for the treatment of alcoholism |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=7 |issue=17 |pages=2341–53 |year=2006 |pmid=17109610 |doi= 10.1517/14656566.7.17.2341}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pettinati HM, Rabinowitz AR |title=Choosing the right medication for the treatment of alcoholism |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=383–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16968619|doi=10.1007/s11920-006-0040-0}}</ref> but rather than substituting for alcohol, these drugs are intended to reduce the desire to drink, either by directly reducing cravings as with acamprosate and topiramate, or by producing unpleasant effects when alcohol is consumed, as with disulfiram.

Opioid antagonists such as [[naltrexone]] and [[nalmefene]] have also been used successfully in the treatment of alcohol addiction,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Srisurapanont M, Jarusuraisin N |title=Opioid antagonists for alcohol dependence |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD001867 |year=2005 |pmid=15674887 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD001867.pub2 |editor1-last=Srisurapanont |editor1-first=Manit}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Karhuvaara S, Simojoki K, Virta A, et al. |title=Targeted nalmefene with simple medical management in the treatment of heavy drinkers: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study |journal=Alcohol.

Some have also attempted to use these drugs for maintenance treatment of former opiate addicts with little success. They cannot be started until the patient has been abstinent for an extended period - unlikely with opioid addicts who are not on maintenance with a full or partial mu-opioid agonist - or they will trigger acute opioid withdrawal symptoms. No study has found them to be efficacious treatments in preventing relapse. They do nothing to block craving, and block endorphin and enkephalin, two natural neurotransmitters that regulate one's sense of well-being.

Treatment of [[stimulant]] addiction can often be difficult, with substitute drugs often being ineffective, although newer drugs such as [[nocaine]], [[vanoxerine]] and [[modafinil]] may have more promise in this area, as well as the GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist [[baclofen]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ling W, Rawson R, Shoptaw S, Ling W |title=Management of methamphetamine abuse and dependence |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=345–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16968614 |doi=10.1007/s11920-006-0035-x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Preti A |title=New developments in the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse |journal=Addict Biol |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=133–51 |year=2007 |pmid=17508985 |doi= 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2007.00061.x}}</ref> Another strategy that has recently been successfully trialled used a combination of the [[benzodiazepine]] antagonist [[flumazenil]] with [[hydroxyzine]] and [[gabapentin]] for the treatment of [[methamphetamine]] addiction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Urschel HC, Hanselka LL, Gromov I, White L, Baron M |title= Open-label study of a proprietary treatment program targeting type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor dysregulation in methamphetamine dependence |journal=Mayo Clin.

Another area in which drug treatment has been widely used is in the treatment of [[nicotine]] addiction. Various drugs have been used for this purpose such as [[bupropion]], [[mecamylamine]] and the more recently developed [[varenicline]]. The cannaboinoid antagonist [[rimonabant]] has also been trialled for treatment of nicotine addiction but has not been widely adopted for this purpose.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garwood CL, Potts LA |title=Emerging pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume= 64 |issue=16 |pages=1693–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17687057 |doi=10.2146/ajhp060427}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Frishman WH |title=Smoking cessation pharmacotherapy—nicotine and non-nicotine preparations |journal=Prev Cardiol |volume=10 |issue=2 Suppl 1 |pages=10–22 |year=2007 |pmid=17396063|doi=10.1111/j.1520-037X.2007.05963.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Siu EC, Tyndale RF |title=Non-nicotinic therapies for smoking cessation |journal=Annu.

[[Ibogaine]] is a hallucinogen (psychotomimetic) that some claim interrupts addiction and reduces or eliminates withdrawal syndromes, specifically in regards to opioids.<ref name="ibogaine">{{cite journal |author=K.R.

Research is complicated by the fact that ibogaine is [[Prohibition (drugs)|illegal]] in many developed countries, and a Schedule I substance in the US, and as a result no controlled human trials have ever been performed. A semi-synthetic analogue of ibogaine, [[18-methoxycoronaridine]] was developed, in an attempt to reduce the toxic (ibogaine is significantly cardiotoxic, and several deaths have been reported from its use; because of its illegal, underground nature, it is impossible to know how toxic the drug is) and psychotomimetic effects of the drug.

===Behavioral programming===
Behavioral programming is considered critical to helping those with addictions achieve abstinence. From the [[applied behavior analysis]] literature and the [[behavioral psychology]] literature several evidenced based intervention programs have emerged (1) [[Integrative behavioral couples therapy|behavioral marital therapy]]; (2) [[Community reinforcement and family training|community reinforcement approach]]; (3) cue exposure therapy; and (4) [[contingency management]] strategies.<ref>{{cite journal | last = O'Donohue| first = W | coauthors = K.E.

===Alternative therapies===
Alternative therapies, such as [[acupuncture]], are used by some practitioners to alleviate the symptoms of drug addiction. In 1997, the American Medical Association (AMA) adopted as policy the following statement after a report on a number of alternative therapies including acupuncture:
<blockquote>There is little evidence to confirm the safety or efficacy of most alternative therapies. Much of the information currently known about these therapies makes it clear that many have not been shown to be efficacious. Well-designed, stringently controlled research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of alternative therapies.<ref>http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/21/omss-handbook-final.pdf</ref></blockquote>

Acupuncture has been shown to be no more effective than control treatments in the treatment of opiate dependence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jordan JB |title=Acupuncture treatment for opiate addiction: a systematic review |journal=J Subst Abuse Treat |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=309–14 |year=2006 |pmid=16716845 |doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2006.02.005}}</ref> Acupuncture, [[acupressure]], [[laser therapy]] and [[electrostimulation]]{{dn|date=January 2013}} have no demonstrated efficacy for smoking cessation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White AR, Rampes H, Campbell JL |title=Acupuncture and related interventions for smoking cessation |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD000009 |year=2006 |pmid=16437420 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD000009.pub2 |editor1-last=White |editor1-first=Adrian R}}</ref>

Important phases in treating substance dependence include establishing coping mechanisms to deal with the hardships of withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, precautions should be established with the patient to avoid relapse by designing a treatment plan around the patients lifestyle. With the correct approaches, the patient can live a healthier life.<ref>[http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/treatment-approaches-drug-addiction "Treatment Approaches for Drug Addiction"], ''National Institute of Drug Abuse'', 09/12/12</ref>

Online websites have been a resource to aid in helping people to overcome addictions. These websites act as ways for struggling addicts, family members of addicts, and people who are in the recovery stage to confide in each other (anonymously if they so choose). They provide an alternative way for these people to seek help, support and information. Sites typically include chat rooms, forums, and blogs for members to interact.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The most common drug addictions are to legal substances such as:
* [[Nicotine]] in the form of [[tobacco]], particularly [[cigarette]]s
* [[Alcohol]]
* [[Caffeine]]

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
The [[phenomenon]] of drug addiction has occurred to some degree throughout recorded [[history]] (see "[[Opium]]").<ref name=LowinsonEtAl2005>{{Cite book |year=2005 |author=Lowinson, Joyce H |author2=Ruiz, Pedro |author3=Millman, Robert B |authorlink3=Robert Millman |author4=Langrod, John G (eds) |title=Substance Abuse: A Comprehensive Textbook |edition=4th |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=0-7817-3474-6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Society and culture==

===Legislation===
Depending on the [[jurisdiction]], addictive drugs may be legal, legal only as part of a government sponsored study, illegal to use for any purpose, illegal to sell, or even illegal to merely possess.

Most countries have legislation which brings various drugs and drug-like [[chemical substance|substances]] under the control of licensing systems. Typically this legislation covers any or all of the opiates, amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, anesthetics, hallucinogenics, derivatives and a variety of more modern synthetic drugs. Unlicensed production, supply or possession is a [[criminal offence]].

Usually, however, drug classification under such legislation is not related simply to addictiveness. The substances covered often have very different addictive properties. Some are highly prone to cause physical dependency, while others rarely cause any form of compulsive need whatsoever. Also, under legislation specifically about drugs, [[alcohol]], [[caffeine]] and [[nicotine]] are not usually included.

Although the legislation may be justifiable on moral or public health grounds, it can make addiction or dependency a much more serious issue for the individual: reliable supplies of a drug become difficult to secure, and the individual becomes vulnerable to both criminal abuse and legal punishment.

It is unclear whether laws against illegal drug use do anything to stem usage and dependency. In jurisdictions where addictive drugs are illegal, they are generally supplied by [[drug dealer]]s, who are often involved with [[organized crime]]. Even though the cost of producing most illegal addictive substances is very low, their illegality combined with the addict's need permits the seller to command a premium price, often hundreds of times the production cost. As a result, addicts sometimes turn to crime to support their habit.
