'''Thymic stromal lymphopoietin''' ('''TSLP''') is a protein belonging to the [[cytokine]] family. It is known to play an important role in the maturation of [[T cell]] populations through activation of [[Antigen-presenting cell|antigen presenting cells]].

TSLP is produced mainly by non-[[Haematopoiesis|hematopoietic]] cells such as [[fibroblasts]], [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] and different types of [[stromal cell|stromal]] or stromal-like cells.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} These cells are located in regions where TSLP activity is required.

== Gene ontology ==

TSLP production has been observed in various species, including humans and mice.  In humans TSLP is encoded by the ''TSLP'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid11480573">{{cite journal | author = Quentmeier H, Drexler HG, Fleckenstein D, Zaborski M, Armstrong A, Sims JE, Lyman SD | title = Cloning of human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and signaling mechanisms leading to proliferation | journal = Leukemia | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1286–92 | year = 2001 | month = Aug | pmid = 11480573 | pmc =  | doi =  10.1038/sj.leu.2402175}}</ref><ref name="entrez"/> [[Alternative splicing]] of this gene results in two transcript variants.<ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: TSLP thymic stromal lymphopoietin| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=85480| accessdate = }}</ref>

== Function ==

It mainly impacts myeloid cells and induces the release of [[T cell]]-attracting chemokines from [[monocyte]]s {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and enhances the maturation of [[myeloid dendritic cells|myeloid]] (CD11c+) dendritic cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reche PA, Soumelis V, Gorman DM, ''et al.'' |title=Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin preferentially stimulates myeloid cells |journal=J.

=== Signalling ===

TSLP signals through a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor and the [[Interleukin-7 receptor-α|IL-7R alpha]] chain. After binding [[STAT5]] phosphorylation is induced resulting in the expression of downstream [[transcription factors]].<ref name="pmid10570284">{{cite journal | author = Isaksen DE, Baumann H, Trobridge PA, Farr AG, Levin SD, Ziegler SF | title = Requirement for stat5 in thymic stromal lymphopoietin-mediated signal transduction | journal = J.

=== Asthma ===
Expression of TSLP is enhanced under [[asthma]]-like conditions (aka [[bronchial hyperresponsiveness|Airway HyperResponsiveness]] or AHR model in the mouse), conditioning [[antigen-presenting cells|APCs]] in order to orientate the differentiation of T cells coming into the lungs towards a [[T helper cell|TH2]] profile (T helper 2 pathway).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The TH2 cells then release factors promoting an inflammatory reaction following the repeated contact with a specific antigen in the airways {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

=== Inflammatory arthritis ===

=== Atopic Dermatitis ===
