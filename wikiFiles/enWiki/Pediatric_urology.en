'''Pediatric urology''' is a surgical subspecialty of medicine dealing with the disorders of children's genitourinary systems. Pediatric urologists provide care for both boys and girls ranging from birth to early adult age. The most common problems are those involving disorders of urination and testes. 

Some of the problems they deal with are:
*[[Urinary bladder|Bladder]] control problems such as [[bedwetting]] and daytime [[urinary incontinence]]
*Undescended testes ([[cryptorchidism]])
*[[Hypospadias]]
*[[Urolithiasis]] (bladder and kidney stones)
*[[Chordee]] and other minor malformations of the [[penis]]
*[[Phimosis]]
*[[Urinary obstruction]] and [[vesicoureteral reflux]]
*[[Neurogenic bladder]] (e.g., associated with [[spina bifida]])
*Tumors and cancers of the kidneys
*Repair of genitourinary [[physical trauma|trauma]]
*Genitourinary malformations and birth defects
**[[Prune belly syndrome]]
**[[Cloacal exstrophy]], [[bladder exstrophy]], and [[epispadias]]
**[[Ambiguous genitalia]] and [[intersex]] conditions

In North America, most pediatric urologists are associated with [[children's hospital]]s. Training for [[board certification]] in pediatric urology typically consists of a surgery internship as part of a urology [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] followed by subspecialty training in pediatric urology at a major children's hospital.
