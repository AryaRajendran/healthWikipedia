What was previously known as [[melancholia]] and is now known as ''clinical depression'', ''major depression'', or simply ''depression'' and commonly referred to as [[major depressive disorder]] by many health care professionals, has a long history, with similar conditions being described at least as far back as classical times.

==Prehistory to medieval periods==

In Ancient Greece, disease was thought due to an imbalance in the four basic bodily fluids, or ''[[humorism|humors]]''. Personality types were similarly thought to be determined by the dominant humor in a particular person.

[[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] later noted that  were "dull or stern; dejected or unreasonably torpid, without any manifest cause". The humoral theory fell out of favor but was revived in Rome by [[Galen]]. Melancholia was a far broader concept than today's depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.<ref name="Radden2003">{{cite journal |last=Radden |first=J |year=2003 |month=March |title=Is this dame melancholy?

[[File:The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton frontispiece 1638 edition.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of the 1638 edition of ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'']]

The seminal scholarly work of the 17th century was English scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton's]] book, ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', drawing on numerous theories and the author's own experiences. Burton suggested that melancholy could be combated with a healthy diet, sufficient sleep, music, and "meaningful work", along with talking about the problem with a friend.<!--This reference is from a pop history book --><ref name=Kent55>{{Harvnb |Kent|2003| p=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10800/10800-8.txt|title=The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton|work=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1 April 2004}}</ref> 

During the 18th century, the humoral theory of melancholia was increasingly challenged by mechanical and electrical explanations; references to dark and gloomy states gave way to ideas of slowed circulation and depleted energy.<ref name="Jackson83">{{cite journal |author=Jackson SW |title=Melancholia and mechanical explanation in eighteenth-century medicine |journal=Journal of the History of Medical and Allied Sciences |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=298–319 |year=1983 |month=July |pmid=6350428 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/38.3.298}}</ref>
German physician [[Johann Christian August Heinroth|Johann Christian Heinroth]], however, argued melancholia was a disturbance of the soul due to moral conflict within the patient. 

Eventually, various authors proposed up to 30 different subtypes of melancholia, and alternative terms were suggested and discarded. [[Hypochondria]] came to be seen as a separate disorder. ''Melancholia'' and ''Melancholy'' had been used interchangeably until the 19th century, but the former came to refer to a pathological condition and the latter to a temperament.<ref name="Radden2003"/>

The term ''depression'' was derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''deprimere'', "to press down".<ref>depress. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved June 30, 2008, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress Dictionary.com]</ref> From the 14th&nbsp;century, "to depress" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author [[Richard Baker (chronicler)|Richard Baker's]] ''Chronicle'' to refer to someone having "a great depression of spirit", and by English author [[Samuel Johnson]] in a similar sense in 1753.<ref>{{cite news |author= Wolpert, L |title=Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> The term also came in to use in [[depression (physiology)|physiology]] and [[depression (economics)|economics]]. 

An early usage referring to a psychiatric symptom was by French psychiatrist [[Louis Delasiauve]] in 1856, and by the 1860s it was appearing in medical dictionaries to refer to a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function.<ref name="pmid3074848">{{cite journal |author=Berrios GE |title=Melancholia and depression during the 19th&nbsp;century: A conceptual history |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=298–304 |year=1988 |month=September |pmid=3074848 |doi=10.1192/bjp.153.3.298}}</ref> Since [[Aristotle]], melancholia had been associated with men of learning and intellectual brilliance, a hazard of contemplation and creativity.

Although ''melancholia'' remained the dominant diagnostic term, ''depression'' gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as ''depressive states''.<ref name="Davison2006">{{cite journal |last=Davison |first=K|year=2006|title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–18 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1476179306700246 |doi=10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115}}</ref> English psychiatrist [[Henry Maudsley]] proposed an overarching category of ''affective disorder''.<ref name="Lewis1934">{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=AJ| year=1934|title=Melancholia: A historical review |journal=Journal of Mental Science |volume=80 |issue=328 |pages=1–42|doi= 10.1192/bjp.80.328.1 |url= }}</ref>

== 20th and 21st centuries ==
The influential system put forward by Kraepelin unified nearly all types of mood disorder into ''manic–depressive insanity''. Kraepelin worked from an assumption of underlying brain pathology, but also promoted a distinction between [[endogenous]] (internally caused) and [[exogenous]] (externally caused) types.<ref name="Davison2006"/> 

German psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] coined the terms ''endogenous depression'' and ''reactive depression'' in 1920,<ref name=Schneider>{{cite journal |last=Schneider |first=K |authorlink=Kurt Schneider |year=1920|title=Zeitschrift für die gesante |journal=Neurol Psychiatr |volume=59|pages=281–86}}</ref> the latter referring to reactivity in mood and not ''reaction'' to outside events, and therefore frequently misinterpreted. The division was challenged in 1926 by Edward Mapother who found no clear distinction between the types.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mapother |first=E |year=1926|title=Discussion of manic-depressive psychosis |journal=[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]] |volume=2 |issue=3436 |pages=872–79|issn=0959-8138 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3436.872 |jstor=25326273}}</ref> 

The unitarian view became more popular in the United Kingdom, while the binary view held sway in the US, influenced by the work of Swiss psychiatrist [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] and before him [[Sigmund Freud]], the father of psychoanalysis.<ref>{{Harvnb |Parker|1996| p=11}}</ref>

[[File:Sigmund freud um 1905.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Sigmund Freud]] argued that depression, or melancholia, could result from loss and is more severe than mourning.]]
Freud had likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper ''Mourning and Melancholia''. He theorized that [[object (philosophy)|objective]] loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[narcissism|narcissistic]] process called the ''libidinal [[cathexis]]'' of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]. 

Such loss results in severe melancholic symptoms more profound than mourning; not only is the outside world viewed negatively, but the ego itself is compromised.<ref name="Carhart-Harris08">{{cite journal |author=Carhart-Harris RL, Mayberg HS, Malizia AL, Nutt D |title=Mourning and melancholia revisited: Correspondences between principles of Freudian metapsychology and empirical findings in neuropsychiatry |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=1|pages=9 |year=2008 |pmid=18652673 |pmc=2515304 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-7-9}}</ref> The patient's decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Richards A ''(ed.)'' |last=Freud|first= S|title=11.On Metapsychology: The Theory of Psycholoanalysis |chapter=Mourning and Melancholia|pages=245–69 |publisher=Pelican |location=Aylesbury, Bucks |year=1984 |isbn=0-14-021740-1}}</ref> He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor.<ref name="Radden2003"/> 

Meyer put forward a mixed social and biological framework emphasizing ''reactions'' in the context of an individual's life, and argued that the term ''depression'' should be used instead of ''melancholia''.<ref name="Lewis1934"/> 

The DSM-I (1952) contained ''depressive reaction'' and the DSM-II (1968) ''depressive neurosis'', defined as an excessive reaction to internal conflict or an identifiable event, and also included a depressive type of manic-depressive psychosis within Major affective disorders.<ref name="DSMII">{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-II |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=1968 |chapter=Schizophrenia |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/DSMPDF/dsm-ii.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-03 |pages= 36–37, 40}}</ref> 

In the mid-20th century, other psychodynamic theories were proposed.

American existential psychologist [[Rollo May]] hypothesized that "depression is the inability to construct a future".<ref>{{cite web |author=Geppert CMA | year=2006 |month=May |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/51281 |title=Damage control |work=Psychiatric Times |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref><!-- See epigraph. --> In general, May wrote, "depression ... occur[s] more in the dimension of time than in space,"<ref name="May">{{Harvnb |May|1994| p=133}}</ref> and the depressed individual fails to look ahead in time properly.

In the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a [[chemical imbalance theory|chemical imbalance]] in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of [[reserpine]] and [[isoniazid]] in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Schildkraut | first = JJ|year=1965|title = The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: A review of supporting evidence |journal = American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=122 |issue=5| pages = 509–22|pmid=5319766 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.122.5.509}}</ref> During the 1960s and 70s, manic-depression came to refer to just one type of mood disorder (now most commonly known as [[bipolar disorder]]) which was distinguished from (unipolar) depression.
