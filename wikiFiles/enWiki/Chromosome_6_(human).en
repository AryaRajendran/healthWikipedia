'''Chromosome 6 ''' is one of the 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in [[human]]s. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 6 spans more than 170 million [[base pair]]s (the building material of [[DNA]]) and represents between 5.5 and 6% of the total DNA in [[cell (biology)|cells]].  It contains the [[Major Histocompatibility Complex]], which contains over 100 genes related to the [[immune response]], and plays a vital role in [[organ transplantation]].

Identifying [[gene]]s on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 6 likely contains between 2,000 and 2,057 genes.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/mapview/maps.cgi?TAXID=9606&CHR=6&MAPS=ideogr,genes[17536196.70%3A34647703.30]&QSTR=HFE&QUERY=uid%28-2100351222,-2100349927,-2100345356,-2100345070,-2100338650,-2100244354,-2100240158,-2100219598,-2100214747,-2100214240,-2100204836,-2100181489,-2100141136,-2100135106,-2100113614,-2100021268,-2100017302,-2099931215,-2099823018,-2099778923%29&amp;ZOOM=100</ref>
