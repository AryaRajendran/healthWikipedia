'''CLIP''' or '''Class II-associated invariant chain peptide''' is the part of the [[invariant chain]] (li) that binds [[MHC class II]] groove and remains there until the [[MHC]] receptor is fully assembled. The purpose of CLIP is to prevent the binding of self-peptide fragments prior to MHC II localization within the endo/[[lysosome]].

During MHC II assembly, invariant chain complexes with the MHC II complex. In a special endosome called the MHC II compartment, [[cathepsin S]] cleaves the invariant chain, leaving CLIP bound to the MHC II complex.  In presence of antigen peptide fragments, [[HLA-DM]] then binds to the MHC II molecule, releasing CLIP and allowing peptides to bind. MHC II with bound antigen is then transported to the cell membrane for presentation. [[ HLA- DO]] can inhibit the reaction catalysed by [[HLA-DM]].The peptide - class II complexes are then transported to the plasma membrane.
