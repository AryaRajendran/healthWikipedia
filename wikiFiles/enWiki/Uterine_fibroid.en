A '''uterine fibroid''' is a [[leiomyoma]] ([[benign]] (non-cancerous) [[tumor]] from smooth muscle tissue) that originates from the smooth muscle layer ([[myometrium]]) of the [[uterus]]. Fibroids are often multiple and if the uterus contains too many leiomyomata to count, it is referred to as ''diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis''. The malignant version of a fibroid is extremely uncommon and termed a [[leiomyosarcoma]].

Other common names are '''uterine leiomyoma''',<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000954200|uterine leiomyoma}}</ref> '''myoma''', '''fibromyoma''', '''fibroleiomyoma'''.

Fibroids are the most common benign tumors in females and typically found during the middle and later reproductive years. While most fibroids are asymptomatic, they can grow and cause heavy and painful menstruation, painful sexual intercourse, and urinary frequency and urgency. Some fibroids may interfere with pregnancy although this appears to be very rare.<ref name=pregnancy_2006/>

In the [[United States]], symptoms caused by uterine fibroids are a very frequent indication for [[hysterectomy]].<ref name=wallach>{{cite journal |author=Wallach EE, Vlahos NF |title=Uterine myomas: an overview of development, clinical features, and management |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=393–406 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15292018 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000136079.62513.39 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Fibroids, particularly when small, may be entirely asymptomatic. Symptoms depend on the location of the lesion and its size. Important symptoms include abnormal [[gynecologic hemorrhage]], heavy or painful periods, abdominal discomfort or bloating, painful defecation, back ache, urinary frequency or retention, and in some cases, [[infertility]].<ref>[http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/fibroidtumors/a/fibroidtumors.htm Fibroid Tumors<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There may also be pain during intercourse, depending on the location of the fibroid. During [[pregnancy]] they may be the cause of [[miscarriage]], bleeding, [[premature labor]], or interference with the position of the fetus.

While fibroids are common, they are not a typical cause for [[infertility]] accounting for about 3% of reasons why a woman may not have a child.<ref name=asrm>[http://www.asrm.org/Patients/patientbooklets/uterine_fibroids.pdf American Society of Reproductive Medicine Patient Booklet: ''Uterine Fibroids'', 2003]</ref> Typically in such cases a fibroid is located in a submucosal position and it is thought that this location may interfere with the function of the lining and the ability of the embryo to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]].<ref name=asrm/> Also larger fibroids may distort or block the fallopian tubes.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:leiomyoma.jpg|thumb|An enucleated uterine leiomyoma – external surface on left, cut surface on right.]]
Leiomyomata grossly appear as round, well circumscribed (but not encapsulated), solid nodules that are white or tan, and show whorled appearance on histological section. The size varies, from microscopic to lesions of considerable size. Typically lesions the size of a grapefruit or bigger are felt by the patient herself through the abdominal wall.

[[File:Lipoleiomyoma2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a lipoleiomyoma, a type of leiomyoma. [[H&E stain]].]]
Microscopically, tumor cells resemble normal cells (elongated, spindle-shaped, with a cigar-shaped nucleus) and form bundles with different directions (whorled). These cells are uniform in size and shape, with scarce mitoses. There are three benign variants: bizarre (atypical); cellular; and [[Mitosis|mitotically]] active.

The appearance of prominent nucleoli with perinucleolar halos should alert the pathologist to investigate the possibility of the extremely rare [[hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer]] syndrome.<ref name=Garg_2011>{{cite pmid|21753700}}</ref>

===Location and classification===
[[File:Uterine fibroids.png|thumb|Schematic drawing of various types of uterine fibroids: a=subserosal fibroids, b=intramural fibroids, c=submucosal fibroid, d=pedunculated submucosal fibroid, e=fibroid in statu nascendi, f=fibroid of the broad ligament]]
Growth and location are the main factors that determine if a fibroid leads to symptoms and problems.<ref name=wallach/> A small lesion can be symptomatic if located within the uterine cavity while a large lesion on the outside of the uterus may go unnoticed. Different locations are classified as follows:
* Intramural fibroids are located within the wall of the uterus and are the most common type; unless large, they may be asymptomatic. Intramural fibroids begin as small nodules in the muscular wall of the uterus.  With time, intramural fibroids may expand inwards, causing distortion and elongation of the uterine cavity.
* Subserosal fibroids are located underneath the mucosal (peritoneal) surface of the uterus and can become very large. They can also grow out in a papillary manner to become pedunculated fibroids. These pedunculated growths can actually detach from the uterus to become a parasitic leiomyoma.
* Submucosal fibroids are located in the muscle beneath the endometrium of the uterus and distort the uterine cavity; even small lesion in this location may lead to bleeding and [[infertility]]. A pedunculated lesion within the cavity is termed an intracavitary fibroid and can be passed through the cervix.
* Cervical fibroids are located in the wall of the cervix (neck of the uterus). Rarely fibroids are found in the supporting structures ([[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]], [[broad ligament]], or [[uterosacral ligament]]) of the uterus that also contain smooth muscle tissue.

Fibroids may be single or multiple. Most fibroids start in an intramural location, that is the layer of the muscle of the uterus. With further growth, some lesions may develop towards the outside of the uterus or towards the internal cavity. Secondary changes that may develop within fibroids are hemorrhage, necrosis, calcification, and cystic changes.

====Extrauterine fibroids of uterine origin, metastatic fibroids====
Fibroids of uterine origin located in other parts of the body, sometimes also called parasitic myomas have been historically extremely rare, but are now diagnosed with increasing frequency. They may be related or identical to metastasizing [[leiomyoma]].

They are in most cases still hormone dependent but may cause life threatening complications when they appear in distant organs. Some sources suggest that a substantial share of the cases may be late complications of surgeries such as myomectomy or hysterectomy. Particularly laparoscopic myomectomy using a morcellator has been associated with a substantially increased risk of this complication.<ref name=Cucinella_2011>{{cite pmid|21719004}}</ref><ref name=Netzhat_2010>{{cite pmid|20580324}}</ref><ref>Kumar_2008{{cite pmid|18193441}}</ref>    <ref name=Galvin_2010>{{cite pmid|20103256}}</ref><ref name=Mikami_1998>{{cite pmid|9750447}}</ref>

===Pathogenesis===
[[File:Myom.jpg|thumb|large subserosal fibroid]]
Fibroids are [[monoclonal]] tumors and approximately 40 to 50% show [[karyotype|karyotypically]] detectable [[chromosome abnormalities|chromosomal abnormalities]]. When multiple fibroids are present they frequently have unrelated genetic defects. Specific mutations of the [[MED12]] protein have been noted  in 70 percent of fibroids.<ref name="Mäkinen_2011">{{cite pmid|21868628}}</ref> 

Exact aetiology is not clearly understood, but the current working hypothesis is that genetic predispositions, prenatal hormone exposure and the effects of hormones, growth factors and [[xenoestrogens]] cause fibroid growth. Known risk factors are African descent, [[nulliparity]], [[obesity]], [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], [[diabetes]] and [[hypertension]].<ref name=Okolo_2008>{{cite pmid|18534913}}</ref>

Fibroid growth is strongly dependent on [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]]. Although both estrogen and progesterone are usually regarded as growth-promoting they will also cause growth restriction in some circumstances. Paradoxically, fibroids rarely grow during pregnancy despite very high steroid hormone levels and pregnancy appears to exert a certain protective effect.<ref name=pregnancy_2006>{{cite pmid|17039693}}</ref> This protective effect might be partially mediated by an interaction between estrogen and the [[oxytocin receptor]].<ref name=oytocin_2003>{{cite pmid|12517588 }}</ref>

It is believed that estrogen and progesterone have a [[mitogenic]] effect on leiomyoma cells and also act by influencing (directly and indirectly) a large number of [[growth factor]]s, [[cytokine]]s and apoptotic factors as well as other hormones. Furthermore, the actions of estrogen and progesterone are modulated by the cross-talk between estrogen, progesterone and [[prolactin]] signalling which controls the expression of the respective nuclear receptors. It is believed that estrogen promotes growth by up-regulating [[IGF-1]], [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]], [[TGF-beta| TGF-beta1]], TGF-beta3 and [[PDGF]], and promotes aberrant survival of leiomyoma cells by down-regulating [[p53]], increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic factor [[PCP4]] and antagonizing [[PPAR-gamma]] signalling. Progesterone is thought to promote the growth of leiomyoma through up-regulating [[Epidermal growth factor|EGF]], TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, and promotes survival through up-regulating [[Bcl-2]] expression and down-regulating [[TNF-alpha]]. Progesterone is believed to counteract growth by downregulating IGF-1.<ref>{{cite pmid|11035984}}</ref><ref name="Wei_2007">{{cite pmid|15140868}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17407572}}</ref> Expression of [[transforming growth interacting factor]] (TGIF) is increased in leiomyoma compared with myometrium.<ref name=Yen-Ping>{{cite journal |author=Yen-Ping Ho J, Man WC, Wen Y, Polan ML, Shih-Chu Ho E, Chen B |title=Transforming growth interacting factor expression in leiomyoma compared with myometrium |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 94|issue= 3|pages= 1078–83|year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19524896 |pmc=2888713 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.05.001 }}</ref> TGIF is a potential repressor of [[TGF-β]] pathways in myometrial cells.<ref name=Yen-Ping/>

Whereas in premenopausal fibroids the [[ER-beta]], [[ER-alpha]] and [[progesterone receptor]]s are found overexpressed, in the rare postmenopausal fibroids only ER-beta was found significantly overexpressed.<ref>{{cite pmid|17646097}}</ref> Most studies found that polymorphisms in ER and PR gene encodings  are not correlated with incidence of fibroids in Caucasian populations<ref>{{cite pmid|12552233}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19639498}}</ref> however a special ER-alpha genotype was found correlated with incidence and size of fibroids. The higher prevalence of this genotype in black women may also explain the high incidence of fibroids in this group.<ref>{{cite pmid|16860797}}</ref>

Uterine leiomyoma was more sensitive than normal myometrium to [[PPAR-gamma]] receptor activation resulting in reduced survival and apoptosis of leiomyoma cells. The mechanism is thought to involve negative cross-talk between ER and PPAR signaling pathways. Several PPAR-gamma ligands were considered  as potential treatment.<ref name=Nam_2007>{{cite pmid| 17893092}}</ref> PPAR-gamma agonists may also counteract leiomyoma growth by several other mechanisms of action such as TGF-beta3 expression inhibition.<ref name=Zhang_2008>{{cite pmid| 18272045}}</ref>

[[Hypertension]] is significantly correlated with fibroids. Although a causal relationships is not at all clear the hypothesis has been formulated that atherosclerotic injury to uterine blood vessels and the resulting inflammatory state may play a role. Furthermore endocrine factors related to blood pressure such as [[angiotensin II]] are suspected to cause fibroid proliferation via angiotensin II type 1 receptor.<ref name=Boynton_2005>{{cite pmid|15781952}}</ref><ref name=Isobe_2007>{{cite pmid|17993476}}</ref>

Aromatase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are aberrantly expressed in fibroids, indicating that fibroids can convert circulating androstenedione into estradiol.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15083381}}</ref> Similar mechanism of action has been elucidated in [[endometriosis]] and other endometrial diseases.<ref>{{cite pmid|11850203}}</ref> Aromatase inhibotors are currently considered for treatment, at
certain doses they would completely inhibit estrogen production in the fibroid while not largely affecting ovarian production of estrogen (and thus systemic levels of it). <!--merge that part with treatment section later--> Aromatase overexpression is particularly pronounced in Afro-American women<ref>{{cite pmid| 19240151}}</ref>

Genetic and hereditary causes are being considered and several epidemiologic findings indicate considerable genetic influence especially for early onset cases. First degree relatives have a 2.5-fold risk, and nearly 6-fold risk when considering early onset cases. [[Monozygotic twins]] have double concordance rate for hysterectomy compared to [[dizygotic twins]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|17613550}}</ref>

Like [[keloid]]s, fibroids have disregulated production of [[extracellular matrix]]. Recent studies suggest that this production may represent an abnormal response to ischemic and mechanical tissue stress.<ref>{{cite journal|  author=Payson M, Malik M, Siti-Nur Morris S, Segars JH, Chason R, Catherino WH.|  title=Activating transcription factor 3 gene expression suggests that tissue stress plays a role in leiomyoma development. | journal=Fertil Steril. |  volume=92|  issue=2|  pages=748–55|  year=2009 | pmid=18692824|  doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.06.030}}</ref> Several factors indicate significant involvement of [[extracellular signal-regulated kinases|extracellular signaling pathways]] such as [[ERK1]] and [[ERK2]], which in fibroids are prominently influenced by hormones.<ref>{{cite pmid|19179429}}</ref> Paradoxically and unlike most other conditions involving significant fibrosis the [[Cyr61]] gene has been found downregulated in fibroids.<ref name="Weston_2003">{{cite pmid| 12900513}}</ref>

Cyr61 is also known for its role as tumor suppressing factor and in [[angiogenesis]]. Hence fibroids are one of the very few tumors with reduced vascular density.<ref name=Weston_2003/>

==Diagnosis==
While a bimanual examination typically can identify the presence of larger fibroids, [[gynecologic ultrasonography]] (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also magnetic resonance imaging ([[MRI]]) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.

Imaging modalities cannot clearly distinguish between the benign uterine leiomyoma and the malignant uterine leiomyosarcoma, however, the latter is quite rare. Fast growth or unexpected growth, such as enlargement of a lesion after menopause, raise the level of suspicion that the lesion might be a sarcoma. Also, with advanced malignant lesions there may be evidence of local invasion. A more recent study has suggested that diagnostic capabilities using MRI have improved the ability to detect sarcomatous lesions.<ref name="pmid12144683">{{cite journal |author=Goto A, Takeuchi S, Sugimura K, Maruo T |title=Usefulness of Gd-DTPA contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI and serum determination of LDH and its isozymes in the differential diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma from degenerated leiomyoma of the uterus |journal=Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=354–61 |year=2002 |pmid=12144683 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1438.2002.01086.x}}</ref> Biopsy is rarely performed and if performed, is rarely diagnostic.  Should there be an uncertain diagnosis after ultrasounds and MRI imaging, surgery is generally indicated.

Other imaging techniques that may be helpful specifically in the evaluation of lesions that affect the uterine cavity are [[hysterosalpingography]] or [[sonohysterography]].

===Coexisting disorders===
Fibroids that lead to heavy vaginal bleeding lead to [[anemia]] and [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]]. Due to pressure effects gastrointestinal problems are possible such as [[constipation]] and bloatedness. Compression of the ureter may lead to [[hydronephrosis]]. Fibroids may also present alongside [[endometriosis]], which itself may cause infertility. [[Adenomyosis]] may be mistaken for or coexist with fibroids.

In very rare cases, malignant (cancerous) growths, [[leiomyosarcoma]], of the myometrium can develop.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Fibroids/Pages/Introduction.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx Fibroids – What is it? – Introduction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In extremely rare cases uterine fibroids may present as part or early symptom of the [[hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer]] syndrome.

==Treatment==
Most fibroids do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. After menopause fibroids shrink and it is unusual for fibroids to cause problems.

Symptomatic uterine fibroids can be treated by:
* medication to control symptoms
* medication aimed at shrinking tumours
* ultrasound fibroid destruction
* myomectomy or radio frequency ablation
* hysterectomy
* [[uterine artery embolization]]

===Medication===
A number of  medications are in use to control symptoms caused by fibroids. [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s can be used to reduce painful menses. Oral contraceptive pills are prescribed to reduce uterine bleeding and cramps.<ref name=asrm/> Anemia may have to be treated with iron supplementation.

[[IUD with progestogen|Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices]] are highly effective in limiting menstrual blood flow and improving other symptoms. Side effects are typically very moderate because the [[levonorgestrel]] (a [[progestin]]) is released in low concentration locally. There is now substantial evidence that Levongestrel-IUDs provide good symptomatic relief for women with fibroids.<ref name=Zapata_2010>{{cite pmid|20682142}}</ref> While most Levongestrel-IUD studies concentrated on treatment of women without fibroids a few reported very good results specifically for women with fibroids including a substantial regression of fibroids.<ref>{{Cite pmid|17726816}}</ref><ref name=Sankaran_2008 /><ref>{{Cite pmid|19920976}}</ref>

[[Danazol]] is an effective treatment to shrink fibroids and control symptoms. Its use is limited by unpleasant side effects. Mechanism of action is thought to be antiestrogenic effects. Recent experience indicates that safety and side effect profile can be improved by more cautious dosing.<ref name=Sankaran_2008 />

[[Dostinex]] in a moderate and well tolerated dosis has been shown in 2 studies to shrink fibroids effectively. Mechanism of action is unclear.<ref name=Sankaran_2008 /><ref>{{cite pmid|19668882}}</ref>

[[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog]]s cause temporary regression of fibroids by decreasing  estrogen levels. Because of the limitations and side effects of this medication it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink the size of the fibroids and uterus before surgery. It is typically used for a maximum of 6 months or less because after longer use they could cause [[osteoporosis]] and other typically postmenopausal complications. The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back regimes are possible, [[tibolone]], [[raloxifene]], [[progestogens]] alone, [[estrogen]] alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens.<ref name=Sankaran_2008>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2008.03.001}} http://www.britishfibroidtrust.org.uk/journals/bft_Sankaran.pdf</ref>

[[Ulipristal acetate]] is a synthetic [[selective progesterone receptor modulator]] which has been tested in small radomized trials with good results for the treatment of fibroids.<ref name="pmid21055739">{{cite pmid|21055739}}</ref> Similar to other selective progesterone receptor modulators and antagonists benign histologic endometrial changes were reported and long term safety outside of clinical studies has not been established yet.<ref name="pmid21055739"/><ref>{{cite pmid|18448745}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ulipristal Acetate versus Placebo for Fibroid Treatment before Surgery|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1103182|publisher=New England Journal of Medicine|author=Jacques Donnez|coauthors=Tetyana F.

[[Progesterone]] antagonists such as [[Mifepristone]] have been tested, there is evidence that it relieves some symptoms and improves quality of life but because of adverse histological changes that have been observed in several trials it can not be currently recommended outside of research setting.<ref name=Tristan_2012>{{cite pmid|22895965}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Mifepristone for Treatment of Uterine Leiomyoma.

The [[selective progesterone receptor modulator]] [[Asoprisnil]] is currently tested with very promising results as a possible use as a treatment for fibroids - the hope is that it will provide the advantages of progesterone antangonitst without their adverse effects.<ref name=Sankaran_2008 />

The long term safety of progesterone antagonists as well as selective progesterone receptor modulators has yet to be established.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19176543}}</ref><ref>http://www.apmhealtheurope.com/story.php?include_profilDepsPage=197&numero=283&profil=94&ctx=6a15602f32780ba0e6037b5e94f2b272</ref>

[[Aromatase inhibitor]]s have been used experimentally to reduce fibroids. The effect is believed to be due partially by lowering systemic estrogen levels and partially by inhibiting locally overexpressed aromatase in fibroids.<ref name=Sankaran_2008 /> Experience from experimental aromatase inhibitor treatment of [[endometriosis]] indicates that aromatase inhibitors might be particularly useful in combination with a progestogenic ovulation inhibitor.

===Uterine artery embolization===
[[Uterine artery embolization]] (UAE): Using [[interventional radiology]] techniques, the interventional radiologist occludes both uterine arteries, thus reducing blood supply to the fibroid.<ref>[http://femisa.org.uk/what's_involved.htm The Embolisation Process: What's Involved<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This intervention is not usually recommended when fertility should be preserved although subsequent pregnancies are usually possible. A small catheter (1&nbsp;mm in diameter) is inserted into the femoral artery at the level of the groin under [[local anesthesia]]. Under imaging guidance, the interventional radiologist will enter selectively into both uterine arteries and inject small (500&nbsp;µm) particles that will block the blood supply to the fibroids. A patient will usually recover from the procedure within a few days. The UAE procedure should result in limited blood supply to the fibroids which should prevent them from further growth, heavy bleeding and possibly shrink them.

A retrospective cohort study showed that UAE has much fewer serious adverse effects than hysterectomy ([[odds ratio]] 0.25) and similar rates of satisfaction. In this study, 86% of women treated with UAE would recommend the treatment to a friend compared to 70% of those treated by hysterectomy.<ref>{{Cite pmid|18331704}}</ref>

===Uterine artery ligation===
Uterine artery ligation, sometimes also laparoscopic occlusion of uterine arteries are minimally invasive methods to limit blood supply of the uterus by a small surgery that can be performed transvaginally or laparoscopically. The principal mechanism of action may be similar like in UAE but is easier to perform and fewer side effects are expected.<ref>{{Cite pmid|11172850}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|19178748}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|16168993}}</ref> UAE currently appears much more effective than this method in direct comparison.<ref name=Hald_2009>{{cite pmid|19713130}}</ref>

===Radio frequency ablation===
[[Radiofrequency ablation]] is one of the newest minimally invasive treatments for fibroids.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704541004575010933671115028.html#video%3D4EEED67A-43A5-40DA-A45D-76FCC1279956%26articleTabs%3Darticle | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=A New Treatment to Help Women Avoid Hysterectomy | date=2010-01-20 | first=Melinda | last=Beck}}</ref> In this technique the fibroid is shrunk by inserting a needle-like device into the fibroid through the abdomen and heating it with radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy to cause [[necrosis]] of cells. The treatment is a potential option for women who have fibroids, have completed child-bearing and want to avoid a hysterectomy.

===Myomectomy===
[[File:Myoma.jpg|thumb|submucosal fibroid in [[hysteroscopy]]]]
[[File:Myomenukleation.jpg|thumb|Treatment of an intramural fibroid by [[laparoscopic surgery]]]][[File:Myomenukleation1.jpg|thumb|After treatment of an intramural fibroid by [[laparoscopic surgery]]]]

Myomectomy is  a surgery to remove one or more fibroids. It is usually recommended when more conservative treatment options fail for women who want fertility preserving surgery or who want to retain the uterus.<ref name=Metwally_2012> {{cite pmid|23152222}}</ref>
 
There are three types of myomectomy:
* In a ''[[hysteroscopy|hysteroscopic]]'' myomectomy, the fibroid can be removed by either the use of a resectoscope, an [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] instrument inserted through the vagina and cervix that can use high-frequency electrical energy to cut tissue, or a similar device.
* A ''[[laparoscopy|laparoscopic]]'' myomectomy is done through a small incision near the navel.  The physician uses a laparoscope and surgical instruments to remove the fibroids.  Studies have suggested that laparoscopic myomectomy leads to lower [[morbidity]] rates and faster recovery than does laparotomic myomectomy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Agdi M, Tulandi T |title=Endoscopic management of uterine fibroids |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=707–16 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18325839 |doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2008.01.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1521-6934(08)00024-2}}</ref> 
* A ''[[laparotomy|laparotomic]]'' myomectomy (also known as an ''open'' or ''abdominal'' myomectomy) is the most invasive surgical procedure to remove fibroids.  The physician makes an incision in the abdominal wall and removes the fibroids from the uterus.

===Hysterectomy===
[[Hysterectomy]] was the classical method of treating fibroids. Although it is now recommended only as last option, fibroids are still the leading cause of hysterectomies in the US.

===Endometrial ablation===
[[Endometrial ablation]] can be used if the fibroids are only within the uterus and not intramural and relatively small. High failure and recurrence rates are expected in the presence of larger or intramural fibroids.

===Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound===
[[Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound]], is a non-invasive intervention (requiring no incision) that uses high intensity focused [[ultrasound]] waves to destroy tissue in combination with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), which guides and monitors the treatment.

==Epidemiology==
Globally approximately 235&nbsp;million people are effected with uterine fibroids as of 2010 (6.6% of females).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163-96|pmid=23245607}}</ref> About 20–40% of women will be diagnosed with leiomyoma at some point in their life but only a fraction of those will cause problems or require treatment.<ref name=wallach/>

Leiomyomata are more common in obese women.<ref name=MM18/>
Fibroids are dependent on estrogen and progesterone to grow and therefore relevant only during the reproductive years, they are expected to shrink after menopause.

===Genetic associations===

An association with [[fatty acid synthase]] has been reported.<ref name=Eggert2012>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.08.009}}</ref>

===Familial leiomyomata===

A syndrome (Reed’s syndrome) of cutaneous and uterine leiomyomata and [[renal cell cancer]] has been reported.<ref name=Tolvanen2012>Tolvanen J, Uimari O, Ryynänen M, Aaltonen LA, Vahteristo P (2012) Strong family history of uterine leiomyomatosis warrants fumarate hydratase mutation screening.

This syndrome is described in greater detail on the page [[Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer]].

===In African Americans===
Eighty percent of African American women will develop benign uterine fibroid tumors by their late 40s, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helping Black Women Recognize, Treat Fibroids|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89344394|work=NPR|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref>    African American women are two to three times more likely to get fibroids than Caucasian women.<ref name=MM18>{{MerckManual|18|248|a||Uterine Fibroids}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=African American Women and Fibroids|url=http://www.blackwomenshealthproject.org/aafibroids.htm|work=Philadelphia Black Women's Health Project|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wise LA, Palmer JR, Stewart EA, Rosenberg L |title=Age-specific incidence rates for self-reported uterine leiomyomata in the Black Women's Health Study |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=563–8 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15738025 |pmc=1847590 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000154161.03418.e3 }}</ref> Also, in African-American women, fibroids also seem to occur at a younger age, grow more quickly, and are more likely to cause symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minority Women's Health|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/minority/africanamerican/uterine-fibroids.cfm|publisher=Women's Health.gov}}</ref>   This leads to higher rates of surgery for African Americans, both myomectomy and hysterectomy.<ref name=BWHP10>{{cite news|title=Black Women and High Prevalence of Fibroids|url=http://www.fibroids.com/news-blog/2010/11/black-women-fibroids/|accessdate=30 March 2011|newspaper=Fibroid Treatment Collective|date=November 29, 2010}}</ref>   Furthermore, increased risk of fibroids in African- Americans causes them to fare worse in in-vitro fertility treatments and raises their risk of premature births and delivery by Cesarean section.<ref name=BWHP10/>

Research has not proven why fibroids are more common in African American women but there are some speculations. Some studies suggest that black women who are obese and who have high blood pressure are more likely to have fibroids.<ref name=BWHP10/>   Additionally, national surveys show that black women consume fewer servings of dairy than white women and have lower intake of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus.<ref name=Dairy09/>   Boston University School of Medicine researchers found that increased dairy intake in African American women decreases their risk of fibroids.<ref name=Dairy09>{{cite news|title=Increased Dairy Intake Reduces Risk of Uterine Fibroids in Black Women, Study Suggests|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091204092459.htm|accessdate=30 March 2011|newspaper=Science Daily|date=December 4, 2009}}</ref> Additionally, research evidence has demonstrated that women with a family history of fibroids are twice more likely to develop fibroids than women with no family history — thus perpetuating the cycle of fibroid prevalence in African Americans.<ref name=BWHP10/>   However, although there is much speculation much more research must be done to determine why fibroid prevalence is higher in African American women.

==Prognosis==
About 1 out of 1000 lesions<ref name=asrm/> are or become malignant, typically as a [[leiomyosarcoma]] on histology. A sign that a lesion may be malignant is growth after [[menopause]].<ref name=asrm/>  There is no consensus among pathologists regarding the transformation of [[leiomyoma]] into a sarcoma. Most pathologists believe that a Leiomyosarcoma is a ''[[Mutation|de novo]]'' disease{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

===Metastasis===
There are a number of rare conditions in which fibroids metastasize. They still grow in a benign fashion, but can be dangerous depending on their location.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fletcher's Diagnostic Histopathology of Tumors |pages=692–4 |edition=3rd }}</ref>
*In leiomyoma with vascular invasion, an ordinary-appearing fibroid invades into a vessel but there is no risk of recurrence.
*In [[Intravenous leiomyomatosis]], leiomyomata grow in veins with uterine fibroids as their source. Cardiac involvement can be fatal.
*In benign metastasizing leiomyoma, leiomyomata grow in more distant sites such as the lungs and lymph nodes. The source is not entirely clear. Pulmonary involvement can be fatal.
*In disseminated intraperitoneal leiomyomatosis, leiomyomata grow diffusely on the peritoneal and omental surfaces, with uterine fibroids as their source. This can simulate a malignant tumor but behaves benignly.

==Society and culture==
The Center for Uterine Fibroids which is associated with Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston MA ([http://www.fibroids.net/index.html]) is currently recruiting volunteers for an investigation of all aspects of the  aetiology, pathology of fibroids and development of treatment options.
This institution also has a lot of clinical trials focused on African American women. The focus of one study is the search for a specific gene associated with the development of fibroids. Since one risk factor for uterine fibroids is having a family history of fibroids, the results of this study will provide some answers on the heredity of the illness. Some women may interact with the healthcare system by getting an ultrasound to diagnose symptoms if they’ve had a mother, sister or grandmother who has previously suffered with these benign tumors.

===United States law===
The 2005 S.1289 bill was read twice and referred to the committee on Health, Labor and Pensions but never passed for a Senate or House vote. The proposed Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2005 mentioned that $5 billion dollars is spent annually on hysterectomy surgeries each year, which affect 22% of African Americans and 7% of Caucasian women. The bill also called for more funding for research and educational purposes. It also states that of the $28 billion issued to NIH,<ref>http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/pdfs/FY11/Approp.%20History%20by%20IC%20(FINAL).pdf</ref> $5 million was allocated for uterine fibroids in 2004.

==In other animals==
Uterine fibroids are rare in other mammals, although they have been observed in certain dogs and [[Baltic gray seals]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bäcklin BM, Eriksson L, Olovsson M |title=Histology of uterine leiomyoma and occurrence in relation to reproductive activity in the Baltic gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) |journal=Vet.
