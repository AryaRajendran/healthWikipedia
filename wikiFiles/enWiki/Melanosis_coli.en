'''Melanosis coli''', also '''pseudomelanosis coli''', is a disorder of pigmentation of the wall of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], often identified at the time of [[colonoscopy]].  It is benign, and may have no significant correlation with disease.  The brown pigment is [[lipofuscin]] in [[macrophage]]s, not [[melanin]].

==Etiology==
{{See|Factitious diarrhea}}
The most common cause of melanosis coli is the extended use of [[laxative]]s, and commonly [[anthraquinone]] containing laxatives such as Senna and other plant glycosides.<ref name=pmid8234421>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Müller-Lissner | first1 = SA. | title = Adverse effects of laxatives: fact and fiction. | journal = Pharmacology | volume = 47 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 138–45 | month = Oct | year = 1993 | doi =  10.1159/000139853| pmid = 8234421 }}</ref> However, other causes are identified, including an increase in colonic epithelial [[apoptosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Byers|first1= R.J.|last2= Marsh|first2=P. |last3=Parkinson|first3=D. |last4=Haboubi|first4=N.Y | title = Melanosis coli is associated with an increase in colonic epithelial apoptosis and not with laxative use | journal = Histopathology | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–164 | month = October | year = 2003 | doi =  10.1046/j.1365-2559.1997.d01-574.x| PMID = 9067741 }}</ref>  [[Endoscopy|Endoscopically]], the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] may show a brownish discoloration in a [[moire pattern]].

==Histologic appearance==
On [[biopsy]], melanosis coli shows characteristic pigment-laden [[macrophage]]s within the mucosa on [[Periodic acid-Schiff|PAS]] staining.<ref name=pmid13537819>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Wittoesch | first1 = JH. | last2 = Jackman | first2 = RJ. | last3 = McDonald | first3 = JR. | title = Melanosis coli: general review and a study of 887 cases. | journal = Dis Colon Rectum | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 172–80 | month =  | year =  | doi =  | PMID = 13537819 }}</ref>

The histologic [[differential diagnosis]] of mucosal pigmentation is: [[lipofuscin]] (melanosis coli), hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and [[melanin]] (rare).

==Prognosis==
No adverse effects or consequences of melanosis coli have been identified.<ref name=pmid13537819/>

==Relation to true melanoses==
The condition is unrelated to true melanoses, such as [[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]] and [[smoker's melanosis]].<ref name=pmid18254267>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Vellappally | first1 = S. | last2 = Fiala | first2 = Z. | last3 = Smejkalová | first3 = J. | last4 = Jacob | first4 = V. | last5 = Somanathan | first5 = R. | title = Smoking related systemic and oral diseases. | journal = Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove) | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–6 | month =  | year = 2007 | doi =  | PMID = 18254267 }}
</ref>

Peutz-Jegher syndrome causes pigmentation of the skin and mucous surfaces with [[melanin]], and polyps in the [[digestive tract]].

==Non-colonic pseudomelanoses==
Pseudomelanoses of other parts of the [[digestive tract|gastrointestinal tract]] have also been reported, and are of unclear relevance.<ref name=pmid7821887>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ghadially | first1 = FN. | last2 = Walley | first2 = VM. | title = Melanoses of the gastrointestinal tract. | journal = Histopathology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–207 | month = Sep | year = 1994 | doi =  10.1111/j.1365-2559.1994.tb01319.x| PMID = 7821887 }}</ref> 

Patients with [[colostomy|colostomies]] can have melanosis involving the [[stoma (medicine)|stoma]], which is also of no significance.<ref name=pmid7598783>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fleischer | first1 = I. | last2 = Bryant | first2 = D. | title = Melanosis coli or mucosa ischemia?
