'''Glucuronidation''' is the addition of [[glucuronic acid]] to a substrate. Glucuronidation is often involved in [[xenobiotic metabolism]] of substances such as [[drug]]s, pollutants, [[bilirubin]], [[androgen]]s, [[estrogen]]s, [[mineralocorticoid]]s, [[glucocorticoid]]s, [[fatty acid]] derivatives, [[retinoid]]s, and [[bile acid]]s. These linkages involve [[glycosidic bond]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King C, Rios G, Green M, Tephly T |title=UDP-glucuronosyltransferases |journal=Curr. Drug Metab. |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–61 |year=2000 |pmid=11465080 |doi=10.2174/1389200003339171}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Glucuronidation consists of transfer of the glucuronic acid component of [[UDP-glucuronic acid]] to a substrate by any of several types of [[UDP-glucuronosyltransferase]].

UDP-glucuronic acid (glucuronic acid linked via a [[glycosidic bond]] to [[uridine diphosphate]]) is an intermediate in the process and is formed in the [[liver]]. One example is the N-glucuronidation of an [[aromatic amine]], [[4-Aminobiphenyl|4-aminobiphenyl]], by UGT1A4 or UGT1A9 from human, rat, or mouse liver.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Al-Zoughool M., Talaska, G. | title=4-Aminobiphenyl N-glucuronidation by liver microsomes: optimization of the reaction conditions and characterization of the UDP-glucoronosyltransferase isoforms | journal=J.

The substances resulting from glucuronidation are known as [[glucuronide]]s (or glucuronosides) and are typically much more [[water]]-[[soluble]] than  non-glucuronic acid-containing substance from which they were originally synthesised. The human body uses glucuronidation to make a large variety of substances more water-soluble, and, in this way, allow for their subsequent elimination from the body through urine or faeces (via bile from the liver). [[Hormone]]s may also be glucuronidated to allow for easier transport around the body. Pharmacologists have linked drugs to glucuronic acid to allow for more effective delivery of a broad range of substances. Sometimes toxic substances are also less toxic after glucuronidation.

The conjugation of xenobiotic molecules with [[hydrophilic]] molecular species such as glucuronic acid is known as [[phase II metabolism]].

==Sites==
Glucuronidation occurs mainly in the [[liver]], although the enzyme responsible for its [[catalysis]], [[UDP-glucuronyltransferase]], has been found in all major body organs, e.g., [[intestine]], [[kidney]]s, [[brain]], [[adrenal gland]], [[spleen]], and [[thymus]].<ref name = "Ohno">{{Cite journal | last = Ohno | first = Shuji  | authorlink =  | coauthors = Nakajin, Shizuo

==General influencing factors==
Various factors affect the rate of glucuronidation, in turn causing increased or decreased glucuronidation of various substances, in turn affecting their [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]]. Generally, an increased rate of glucuronidation results in less effect of affected drugs or compounds, and vice versa.

== Affected drugs ==
Many drugs which are substrates for glucuronidation as part of their metabolism are significantly affected by inhibitors or inducers of their specific glucuronisyltransferase types:
