[[Image:Surgeon operating, Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, circa 1990.JPEG|thumb|right|A cardiothoracic surgeon performs a [[mitral valve replacement]] at the [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center]].]]
'''Surgery''' (from the {{lang-el|χειρουργική}} ''cheirourgikē'' (composed of ''χείρ'', "hand", and ''έργον'', "work"), via {{lang-la|chirurgiae}}, meaning "hand work") is an ancient [[medicine|medical specialty]] that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a [[patient]] to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as [[disease]] or [[injury]], or to help improve bodily function or appearance.

An act of performing surgery may be called a ''surgical procedure'', '''operation''', or simply '''surgery'''.  In this context, the verb '''operate''' means to perform surgery.  The adjective '''surgical''' means pertaining to surgery; e.g. [[surgical instrument]]s or [[surgical nurse]].  The patient or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal.  A [[surgeon]] is a person who practises surgery. Persons described as surgeons are commonly [[physician]]s, but the term is also applied to [[podiatry|podiatrists]], [[dentist]]s (known as oral and maxillofacial surgeons) and [[veterinarian]]s.  A surgery can last from minutes to hours, but is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment.  The term ''surgery'' can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.

[[Elective surgery]] generally refers to a surgical procedure that can be scheduled in advance because it does not involve a [[medical emergency]]. [[Plastic surgery|Plastic]], or cosmetic surgeries are common elective procedures.

==Definitions of surgery==
Surgery is a technology consisting of a physical intervention on tissues.

As a general rule, a procedure is considered surgical when it involves cutting of a patient's tissues or closure of a previously sustained wound.  Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this rubric, such as [[angioplasty]] or [[endoscopy]], may be considered surgery if they involve "common" surgical procedure or settings, such as use of a sterile environment, [[anesthesia]], [[antiseptic]] conditions, typical [[surgical instruments]], and [[suturing]] or [[Surgical staple|stapling]].  All forms of surgery are considered invasive procedures; so-called "noninvasive surgery" usually refers to an excision that does not penetrate the structure being excised (e.g. laser ablation of the cornea) or to a radiosurgical procedure (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).

===Types of surgery===
Surgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.

* Based on timing:  [[Elective surgery]] is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability.  [[Emergency medicine|Emergency surgery]] is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity.  A [[semi-elective surgery]] is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time.
* Based on purpose:  [[Exploratory surgery]] is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis.  Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.
* By type of procedure:  [[Amputation]] involves cutting off a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration is also an example.  [[Replantation]] involves reattaching a severed body part.  [[Reconstructive surgery]] involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. [[Cosmetic_surgery#Cosmetic_surgery|Cosmetic surgery]] is done to improve the appearance of an otherwise normal structure.  Excision is the cutting out or removal of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the patient.  [[Organ transplant|Transplant]] surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient.  Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.
* By body part:  When surgery is performed on one organ system or structure, it may be classed by the organ, organ system or tissue involved.  Examples include cardiac surgery (performed on the heart), gastrointestinal surgery (performed within the digestive tract and its accessory organs), and orthopedic surgery (performed on bones and/or muscles).
* By degree of [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasiveness]]:  [[Minimally invasive surgery#Minimally_invasive_procedure|Minimally invasive surgery]] involves smaller outer incision(s) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in [[laparoscopic surgery]] or [[angioplasty]].  By contrast, an [[open surgery|open surgical procedure]] or [[laparotomy]] requires a large incision to access the area of interest.
* By equipment used:  [[Laser surgery]] involves use of a [[laser]] for cutting tissue instead of a [[scalpel]] or similar surgical instruments.  [[Microsurgery]] involves the use of an operating [[microscope]] for the surgeon to see small structures.  [[Robotic surgery]] makes use of a surgical [[robot]], such as the [[Da Vinci Surgical System|Da Vinci]] or the Zeus surgical systems, to control the instrumentation under the direction of the surgeon.

===Terminology===
*[[wiktionary:excision|Excision]] surgery names often start with a name for the organ to be excised (cut out) and end in '''-ectomy'''.
*Procedures involving cutting into an organ or tissue end in '''-otomy'''.  A surgical procedure cutting through the [[abdominal]] wall to gain access to the [[abdominal cavity]] is a [[laparotomy]].
*[[Minimally invasive surgery#Minimally_invasive_procedure|Minimally invasive procedure]]s involving small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted end in '''-oscopy'''.  For example, such surgery in the abdominal cavity is called [[laparoscopy]].
*Procedures for formation of a permanent or semi-permanent opening called a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] in the body end in '''-ostomy'''.
*Reconstruction, plastic or cosmetic surgery of a body part starts with a name for the body part to be reconstructed and ends in '''-oplasty'''.  ''Rhino'' is used as a prefix for "nose", therefore a ''[[rhinoplasty]]'' is reconstructive or cosmetic surgery for the nose.
*Reparation of damaged or congenital abnormal structure ends in '''-rraphy'''. [[Herniorraphy]] is the reparation of a hernia, while perineorraphy is the reparation of [[perineum]].

==Description of surgical procedure==

===Location===
At a [[hospital]], modern surgery is often done in an [[operating theater]] using [[surgical instrument]]s, an [[operating table]] for the patient, and other equipment. The environment and procedures used in surgery are governed by the principles of [[aseptic technique]]: the strict separation of "sterile" (free of microorganisms) things from "unsterile" or "contaminated" things.  All surgical instruments must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]], and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire ([[Scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]], a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure.

===Pre-operative preparation===
Prior to surgery, the patient is given a [[medical examination]], certain pre-operative tests, and their [[physical fitness|physical status]] is rated according to the [[ASA physical status classification system]]. If these results are satisfactory, the patient signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an [[autologous]] [[blood donation]] may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the [[digestive system]], the patient may be instructed to perform a [[Whole bowel irrigation|bowel prep]] by drinking a solution of [[polyethylene glycol]] the night before the procedure. Patients are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an [[Nil per os|NPO order]] after midnight on the night before the procedure, to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the patient vomits during or after the procedure.

Some medical systems have a practice of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly.<ref name="ACRfive">{{Cite document |author1 = American College of Radiology |author1-link = American College of Radiology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American College of Radiology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Radiology.pdf |accessdate = August 17 2012 |postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Staging for surgery===
In the pre-operative holding area, the patient changes out of his or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details of his or her surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral [[intravenous therapy|IV line]] is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the [[operating field]], is cleaned and prepared by applying an [[antiseptic]] such as [[chlorhexidine gluconate]] or [[povidone-iodine]] to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific [[Surgical Positions|surgical position]], then sterile drapes are used to cover all of the patient's body except for the head and the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an "ether screen", which separates the [[anesthetist]]/[[anesthesiologist]]'s working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).

[[Anesthesia]] is administered to prevent [[pain]] from incision, tissue manipulation and suturing.  Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided [[local anesthesia|locally]] or as [[general anesthesia]].  [[Spinal anesthesia]] may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable.  With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the patient can remain conscious or minimally sedated.  In contrast, general anesthesia renders the patient unconscious and paralyzed during surgery.  The patient is [[intubation|intubated]] and is placed on a [[mechanical ventilator]], and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents.

===Surgery===
An incision is made to access the surgical site.  [[Blood vessel]]s may be clamped to prevent bleeding, and retractors may be used to expose the site or keep the incision open.  The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then peritoneum.  In certain cases, [[bone]] may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the [[human skull|skull]] for [[brain]] surgery or cutting the [[Human sternum|sternum]] for [[Thoracic surgery|thoracic (chest) surgery]] to open up the [[rib cage]]. Whilst in surgery health and safety is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeonist will remove hair from the face and eyes, using a head hat. Hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly to prevent germs getting into the operated body, then gloves are placed onto the hands. A PVC apron will be worn at all times, to stop any contamination. A yellow substance - typically an antiseptic iodine solution - is lighly coated onto the located area of the patient's body that will be performed on, this stops germs and disease infecting areas of the body, whilst the patient is being cut into.

Work to correct the problem in body then proceeds.  This work may involve:
{{anchor|excision}}
*excision - cutting out an organ, tumor,<ref>Wagman LD. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter01/article/10165/1399286 "Principles of Surgical Oncology"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> or other tissue.
*[[Segmental resection|resection]] - partial removal of an organ or other bodily structure.
*reconnection of organs, tissues, etc., particularly if severed.  Resection of organs such as intestines involves reconnection.  Internal [[surgical suture|suturing]] or stapling may be used.  Surgical connection between blood vessels or other tubular or hollow structures such as loops of intestine is called [[anastomosis]].
*Reduction - the movement or realignment of a body part to its normal position.  e.g. Reduction of a broken nose involves the physical manipulation of the bone and/or cartilage from their displaced state back to their original position to restore normal airflow and aesthetics.
*[[Ligature (medicine)|ligation]] - tying off blood vessels, ducts, or "tubes".
*[[Medical grafting|grafts]] - may be severed pieces of tissue cut from the same (or different) body or flaps of tissue still partly connected to the body but resewn for rearranging or restructuring of the area of the body in question.  Although grafting is often used in cosmetic surgery, it is also used in other surgery.  Grafts may be taken from one area of the patient's body and inserted to another area of the body.  An example is [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]], where clogged blood vessels are bypassed with a graft from another part of the body.  Alternatively, grafts may be from other persons, cadavers, or animals.
*insertion of [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] parts when needed.  Pins or screws to set and hold bones may be used.  Sections of bone may be replaced with prosthetic rods or other parts.  Sometime a plate is inserted to replace a damaged area of skull.  [[Artificial hip]] replacement has become more common.  [[Heart pacemaker]]s or [[Heart valve|valves]] may be inserted.  Many other types of [[Prosthesis|prostheses]] are used.
*creation of a [[stoma (medicine)|stoma]], a permanent or semi-permanent opening in the body
*in [[Organ transplant|transplant]] surgery, the donor organ (taken out of the donor's body) is inserted into the recipient's body and reconnected to the recipient in all necessary ways (blood vessels, ducts, etc.).
*[[arthrodesis]] - surgical connection of adjacent bones so the bones can grow together into one. [[Spinal fusion]] is an example of adjacent [[vertebrae]] connected allowing them to grow together into one piece.
*modifying the [[digestive tract]] in bariatric surgery for [[weight loss]].
*repair of a [[fistula]], [[hernia]], or [[prolapse]]
*other procedures, including:
:*clearing clogged ducts, blood or other vessels
:*removal of calculi (stones)
:*draining of accumulated fluids
:*[[debridement]]- removal of dead, damaged, or diseased tissue
*Surgery has also been conducted to separate [[conjoined twins]].
*[[Sex change operation]]s

[[Blood transfusion|Blood]] or blood expanders may be administered to compensate for blood lost during surgery.  Once the procedure is complete, [[surgical suture|suture]]s or [[Surgical staple|staples]] are used to close the incision.  Once the incision is closed, the anesthetic agents are stopped and/or reversed, and the patient is taken off ventilation and extubated (if general anesthesia was administered).

===Post-operative care===
After completion of surgery, the patient is transferred to the [[post anesthesia care unit]] and closely monitored.  When the patient is judged to have recovered from the anesthesia, he/she is either transferred to a surgical ward elsewhere in the hospital or discharged home.  During the post-operative period, the patient's general function is assessed, the outcome of the procedure is assessed, and the surgical site is checked for signs of infection. There are several risk factors associated with postoperative complications, such as immune deficienty and obesity. Obesity has long been considered a risk factor for adverse post-surgical outcomes. It has been linked to many disorders such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atelectasis and pulmonary embolism, adverse cardiovascular effects, and wound healing complications.<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00700.x/pdf Doyle, S. L., Lysaght, J. and Reynolds, J. V. (2010), Obesity and post-operative complications in patients undergoing non-bariatric surgery. Obesity Reviews, 11: 875–886.]</ref> If removable skin closures are used, they are removed after 7 to 10 days post-operatively, or after healing of the incision is well under way.

Postoperative therapy may include adjuvant treatment such as [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], or administration of [[medication]] such as anti-rejection medication for transplants.  Other follow-up studies or rehabilitation may be prescribed during and after the recovery period.

==In special populations==

===Elderly people===
Older adults have widely varying physical health.  [[Frailty syndrome|Frail elderly]] people are at significant risk of post-surgical complications and the need for extended care.  Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories.<ref name=Frailty>{{cite journal

===Other populations===
{{Expand section|date=November 2012}}

;Children
Surgery on children requires considerations which are not common in adult surgery.

;Persons with health conditions
A person with a debilitating medical condition may have special needs during a surgery which a typical patient would not. 

;Vulnerable populations
Doctors perform surgery with the consent of the patient. Some patients are able to give better [[informed consent]] than others. Populations such as [[Incarceration|incarcerated persons]], the mentally incompetent, persons subject to coercion, and other people who are not able to make decisions with the same authority as a typical patient have special needs when making decisions about their personal healthcare, including surgery.

==History==
{{Main|History of surgery|Prehistoric medicine|History of general anesthesia}}
The earliest known compendium on Surgery were penned down by ancient Indians.[[Sushruta]] was an ancient Indian sage who had extensively described about various surgeries in [[Sushruta Samhita]] ranging from rhinoplasties, labioplasties and caesarians.
At least two prehistoric cultures had developed forms of surgery. The oldest for which there is evidence is [[trepanation]],<ref>{{Cite book |author=Capasso, Luigi |year=2002 |title=Principi di storia della patologia umana: corso di storia della medicina per gli studenti della Facoltà di medicina e chirurgia e della Facoltà di scienze infermieristiche |location=Rome |publisher=SEU |isbn=88-87753-65-2 |oclc=50485765 |language=Italian}}</ref> in which a hole is [[drill]]ed or scraped into the [[Human skull|skull]], thus exposing the [[dura mater]] in order to treat health problems related to intra cranial pressure and other diseases. Evidence has been found in prehistoric human remains from [[Neolithic]] times, in [[cave painting]]s, and the procedure continued in use well into [[recorded history]]. Surprisingly, many prehistoric and premodern patients had signs of their skull structure healing; suggesting that many survived the operation. Remains from the early Harappan periods of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 3300 BCE) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4882968.stm | work=BBC News | title=Stone age man used dentist drill | date=6 April 2006 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> A final candidate for prehistoric surgical techniques is [[Ancient Egypt]], where a [[Human mandible|mandible]] dated to approximately 2650 BCE shows two perforations just below the root of the first [[molar (tooth)|molar]], indicating the draining of an [[Tooth abscess|abscessed tooth]].
[[Image:Hippocrates rubens.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Hippocrates]] stated in the oath (c. 400 BC) that general physicians must never practice surgery and that surgical procedures are to be conducted by specialists.]]
The oldest known surgical texts date back to ancient Egypt about 3500 years ago. Surgical operations were performed by priests, specialized in medical treatments similar to today. The procedures were documented on papyrus and were the first to describe patient case files; the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] (held in the [[New York Academy of Medicine]]) documents surgical procedures based on anatomy and physiology, while the [[Ebers Papyrus]] describes healing based on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Their medical expertise was later documented by Herodotus: "The practice of medicine is very specialized among them. Each physician treats just one disease. The country is full of physicians, some treat the eye, some the teeth, some of what belongs to the abdomen, and others internal diseases."<ref>Herodotus, Histories 2,84</ref>

In [[ancient Greece]], temples dedicated to the healer-god [[Asclepius]], known as ''Asclepieia'' ({{lang-el|Ασκληπιεία}}, sing. ''Asclepieion'' ''Ασκληπιείον''), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.<ref>Risse, G.B. ''Mending bodies, saving souls: a history of hospitals.''

[[File:Augenoperation 1195.jpg|thumb|150px|left|12th century eye surgery.]]
The Greek [[Galen]] was one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations — including brain and eye surgery — that were not tried again for almost two millennia.

In China, [[Hua Tuo]] was a famous Chinese physician during the Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms era who performed surgery with the aid of [[anesthesia]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], surgery was developed to a high degree in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]].  [[Abulcasis]] (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi), an [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian-Arab]] physician and scientist who practised in the Zahra suburb of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], wrote medical texts that shaped European surgical procedures up until the Renaissance.<ref>[http://www.famousmuslims.com/ABU%20AL-QASIM%20AL-ZAHRAVI.htm biography from Famousmuslims.com] accessed 16 April 2007.</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=August 2010}}

In [[Europe]], the demand grew for surgeons to formally study for many years before practicing; universities such as [[University of Montpellier|Montpellier]], [[University of Padua|Padua]] and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] were particularly renowned. According to Peter Elmer and Ole Peter Grell, "[[Guy de Chauliac]] (1298-1368) was one of the most eminent surgeons of the Middle Ages. His ''Chirurgia Magna'' or ''Great Surgery'' (1363) was a standard text for surgeons until well into the seventeenth century."<ref>Peter Elmer, Ole Peter Grell (2004). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=vPpvlIrVSMkC&pg=PA8&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Health, disease, and society in Europe, 1500-1800: a source book]''". [[Manchester University Press]]. p.8. ISBN 0-7190-6737-5</ref> By the fifteenth century at the latest, surgery had split away from [[physic]] as its own subject, of a lesser status than pure [[medicine]], and initially took the form of a craft tradition until [[Rogerius (physician)|Rogerius Salernitanus]] composed his ''Chirurgia'', laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals up to the modern time.  Late in the nineteenth century, Bachelor of Surgery degrees (usually ChB) began to be awarded with the [[Doctor of Medicine|(MB)]], and the mastership became a higher degree, usually abbreviated [[Master of Surgery|ChM or MS]] in London, where the first degree was [[bachelor of medicine|MB, BS]].

[[Barber surgeon|Barber-surgeons]] generally had a bad reputation that was not to improve until the development of academic surgery as a specialty of medicine, rather than an accessory field.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sven Med Tidskr. |title=From barber to surgeon- the process of professionalization |year=2007 |pmid=18548946 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=69–87 |journal=Svensk medicinhistorisk tidskrift}}</ref> Basic surgical principles for asepsis etc., are known as [[Halsteads principles]]

=== Modern surgery ===
[[File:Ambroise Paré 1573.jpg|thumb|160px|Ambroise Paré (ca. 1510-1590), father of modern military surgery.]]
Modern surgery developed rapidly with the scientific era. [[Ambroise Paré]] (sometimes spelled "Ambrose"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levine JM |title=Historical notes on pressure ulcers: the cure of Ambrose Paré |journal=Decubitus |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=23–4, 26 |year=1992 |month=March |pmid=1558689 |doi= |url=}}</ref>) pioneered the treatment of gunshot wounds, and the first modern surgeons were battlefield doctors in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Naval surgeons were often [[barber surgeon]]s, who combined surgery with their main jobs as barbers.
The works of [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]] laid the foundations for modern anatomical pathology and first described the concept of disequilibrium linked to internal organic dysfunctions. 
Three main developments permitted the transition to modern surgical approaches - control of [[bleeding]], control of [[infection]] and control of [[pain]] ([[anaesthesia]]).
Bleeding: Before modern surgical developments, there was a very real threat that a patient would bleed to death before treatment, or during the operation.  [[Cauterization]] (fusing a wound closed with extreme heat) was successful but limited - it was destructive, painful and in the long term had very poor outcomes. [[Ligature (medicine)|Ligatures]], or material used to tie off severed blood vessels, originated as early as [[ancient Rome]],<ref>[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/themes/war/innovations.aspx ''Medical innovations and war'',Science Museum,London]</ref> and were improved by [[Ambroise Paré]] in the 16th century. Though this method was a significant improvement over the method of cauterization, it was still dangerous until infection risk was brought under control - at the time of its discovery, the concept of [[infection]] was not fully understood. Finally, early 20th century research into [[Human blood group systems|blood groups]] allowed the first effective blood transfusions.
; Pain: Modern [[pain]] control through [[anesthesia]] was discovered by [[Crawford Long]]. Before the advent of [[anesthesia]], surgery was a traumatically painful procedure and surgeons were encouraged to be as swift as possible to minimize patient [[suffering]].  This also meant that operations were largely restricted to [[amputation]]s and external growth removals. Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically in character with the discovery of effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]], discovered by [[James Young Simpson]] and later pioneered in Britain by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]. In addition to relieving patient suffering, anaesthesia allowed more intricate operations in the internal regions of the human body.  In addition, the discovery of [[muscle relaxant]]s such as [[curare]] allowed for safer applications.
; Infection: Unfortunately, the introduction of anesthetics encouraged more surgery, which inadvertently caused more dangerous patient post-operative infections.  The concept of infection was unknown until relatively modern times. The first progress in combating infection was made in 1847 by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] doctor [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] who noticed that medical students fresh from the dissecting room were causing excess maternal death compared to midwives. Semmelweis, despite ridicule and opposition, introduced compulsory handwashing for everyone entering the maternal wards and was rewarded with a plunge in maternal and fetal deaths, however the [[Royal Society]] in the UK still dismissed his advice. Significant progress came following the work of [[Louis Pasteur]] and his advances in [[microbiology]], when the British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] began experimenting with using phenol during surgery to prevent infections. Lister was able to quickly reduce infection rates, a reduction that was further helped by his subsequent introduction of the techniques of [[Robert Koch]] (such as the Steam Steriliser, which proved more successful than the carbolic acid spray that Lister had been using previously) to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] equipment, have rigorous hand washing and a later implementation of rubber gloves. Lister published his work as a series of articles in [[The Lancet]] (March 1867) under the title ''[[Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery]]''. The work was groundbreaking and laid the foundations for a rapid advance in infection control that saw modern aseptic operating theatres widely used within 50 years (Lister himself went on to make further strides in antisepsis and asepsis throughout his lifetime).

; Cognitive and memory decline: Surgery may cause post-operative decline in memory and [[Cognition|cognitive]] function due that [[inflammation|inflammatory]] proteins may cause damage to the [[blood–brain barrier]] and allow for immune competent blood cells to interfere with memory functions, but may be prevented with a pre-operative dosage of a [[nicotine]] alike medicine. This affects {{nowrap|20 - 25%}} of the patients for a few months, but very few are affected for more than {{nowrap|1 year}}.<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.22664/full wiley.com - Resolving postoperative neuroinflammation and cognitive decline], {{doi|10.1002/ana.22664}} received 2011-07-26 published 2011-12-21</ref>

Some other specialties involve some forms of surgical intervention, especially [[gynaecology]].  Also, some people consider invasive methods of treatment/diagnosis, such as cardiac catheterization, endoscopy, and placing of chest tubes or central lines "surgery".  In most parts of the medical field, this view is not shared.
