'''Prostate-specific antigen''' ('''PSA'''), also known as '''gamma-seminoprotein''' or '''kallikrein-3''' ('''KLK3'''), is a [[glycoprotein]] [[enzyme]] encoded in humans by the ''KLK3'' [[gene]]. PSA is a member of the [[kallikrein]]-related [[protease|peptidase]] family and is secreted by the [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] of the [[prostate]] gland. PSA is produced for the [[ejaculate]], where it liquefies [[semen]] in the seminal coagulum and allows [[spermatozoon|sperm]] to swim freely.<ref name="pmid12525533">{{cite journal | author = Balk SP, Ko YJ, Bubley GJ | title = Biology of prostate-specific antigen | journal = J.

====Screening====
{{main|Prostate cancer screening}}

[[Clinical practice guideline]]s for prostate cancer [[screening (medicine)|screening]] vary and are controversial due to uncertainty as to whether the benefits of screening ultimately outweigh the risks of [[overdiagnosis]] and over treatment.<ref name="Gomella2011">{{cite journal | author = Gomella LG, Liu XS, Trabulsi EJ, Kelly WK, Myers R, Showalter T, Dicker A, Wender R | title = Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy | journal = Can J Urol | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 5875–83 | year = 2011 | month = October | pmid = 22018148 | doi = }}</ref>  In the United States, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The patient needs to be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA testing prior to performing the test (see below). PSA levels between 4 and 10&nbsp;ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) are considered to be suspicious and consideration should be given to confirming the abnormal PSA with a repeat test. If indicated, [[prostate biopsy]] is performed to obtain tissue sample for histopathological analysis.  In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (2005) does not mandate, nor advise for PSA test, but allows patients to decide based on their doctor's advice.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4175856.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doctors warn on ad hoc screening | date=2005-08-23}}</ref> 

A review commissioned by the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] concluded that "Prostate-specific antigen-based screening results in small or no reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality and is associated with harms related to subsequent evaluation and treatments, some of which may be unnecessary,"<ref name="urlwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org"/> or more simply, "[t]he potential benefit does not outweigh the expected harms" in patients not already diagnosed or being treated for prostate cancer.  

While PSA testing may help 1 in 1000 avoid death due to prostate cancer, 4 to 5 in 1000 would die from prostate cancer after 10 years even with screening. Expected harms include anxiety for 100 – 120 receiving false positives, biopsy pain, and other complications from biopsy for false positive tests.  Of those found to have prostate cancer, frequent overdiagnosis is common because most cases of prostate cancer are not expected to cause any symptoms.  Men found to have prostate cancer usually (up to 90% of cases) elect to receive treatment.  Therefore many will experience the side effects of treatment, such as for every 1000 men screened, 29 will experience erectile dysfunction, 18 will suffer urinary incontinence, 2 will have serious cardiovascular events, 1 will suffer pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis, and 1 perioperative death.<ref name="urlwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org"/>

====Risk stratification and staging====
People with localized (non-metastatic) prostate cancer may be characterized as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk for prostate cancer mortality. PSA level is one of three variables on which the risk-stratification is based; the others are the grade of prostate cancer ([[Gleason grading system]]) and the stage of cancer based on physical examination and imaging studies. Criteria for each risk category are as follows:
:Low-risk: PSA < 10, Gleason score ≤ 6, AND clinical stage ≤ T2a
:Intermediate-risk: PSA 10-20, Gleason score 7, OR clinical stage T2b/c
:High-risk: PSA > 20, Gleason score ≥ 8, OR clinical stage ≥ T3

Researchers are working to identify more accurate prognostic variables for risk-stratification of prostate cancer.

====Post-treatment monitoring====
PSA levels are monitored periodically (e.g., every 6-36 months) after treatment for prostate cancer - more frequently in patients with high-risk disease, less frequently in patients with lower-risk disease. If surgical therapy (i.e., radical prostatectomy) is successful at removing all prostate tissue (and prostate cancer), PSA becomes undetectable within a few weeks. A subsequent rise in PSA level above 0.2&nbsp;ng/dL is generally regarded as evidence of recurrent prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy; less commonly, it may simply indicate residual benign prostate tissue.

Following radiation therapy of any type for prostate cancer, some PSA levels might be detected, even when the treatment ultimately proves to be successful. This makes it more difficult to interpret the relationship between PSA levels and recurrence/persistence of prostate cancer after radiation therapy. PSA levels may continue to decrease for several years after radiation therapy. The lowest level is referred to as the PSA nadir. A subsequent increase in PSA levels by 2.0&nbsp;ng/dL above the nadir is the currently accepted definition of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.

If recurrent prostate cancer is detected by a rise in PSA levels after curative treatment, it is referred to as a "[[biochemical recurrence]]". The likelihood of developing recurrent prostate cancer after curative treatment is correlated to various risk factors, such as the grade of prostate cancer (Gleason score), PSA level prior to treatment, and the stage of disease prior to treatment. Low-risk cancers [reference the preceding section] are the least likely to recur, but they are also the least likely to have required treatment in the first place.

====Histology====
PSA is produced in the [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells of the prostate, and can be demonstrated in biopsy samples or other [[histology|histological]] specimens using [[immunohistochemistry]]. Disruption of this epithelium, for example in inflammation or [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], may lead to some diffusion of the antigen into the tissue around the epithelium, and is the cause of elevated blood levels of PSA in these conditions.<ref name=Leong>{{cite book|author=Leong, Anthony S-Y|author2=Cooper, Kumarason|author3=Leong, F Joel W-M|year=2003|title=Manual of Diagnostic Cytology|edition=2|publisher=Greenwich Medical Media, Ltd.|pages=79–80|isbn=1-84110-100-1}}</ref>

More significantly, PSA remains present in prostate cells after they become malignant. Prostate cancer cells generally have variable or weak staining for PSA, due to the disruption of their normal functioning. Thus, individual prostate cancer cells produce less PSA than healthy cells; the raised serum levels in prostate cancer patients is due to the greatly increased number of such cells, not their individual activity. However, in most cases of prostate cancer, the cells remain positive for the antigen, which can therefore be used to identify [[metastasis]]. Since some high-grade prostate cancers may be entirely negative for PSA, however, histological analysis to identify such cases usually uses PSA in combination with other antibodies, such as [[prostatic acid phosphatase|PSAP]] and [[CD57]].<ref name=Leong/>

===Forensic identification of semen===
PSA was first identified by researchers attempting to find a substance in seminal fluid that would aid in the investigation of rape cases.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hara M, Inorre T, Fukuyama T. |title=Some physicochemical characteristics of gamma-seminoprotein, an antigenic component specific for human seminal plasma |journal= Jpn J Legal Med. |year=1971 |volume=25 |pages=322–324}}</ref> PSA is now used to indicate the presence of [[semen]] in forensic [[serology]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Bill O.

Because PSA is a [[biomarker]] that is expressed independently of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], it remains useful in identifying semen from [[vasectomy|vasectomized]] and [[azoospermia|azoospermic]] males.<ref name=aspermic>{{cite journal | author = M.

PSA can also be found at low levels in other body fluids, such as urine and breast milk, thus setting a high minimum threshold of interpretation to rule out [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] results and conclusively state that semen is present.<ref name=fluids/> While traditional tests such as crossover [[electrophoresis]] have a sufficiently low sensitivity to detect only seminal PSA, newer diagnostics tests developed from clinical [[prostate cancer screening]] methods have lowered the threshold of detection down to 4&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Manfred N. Hochmeister, Bruce Budowle, Oskar Rudin, Christian Gehrig, Urs Borer, Michael Thali, and Richard Dirnhofer |title=Evaluation of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Membrane Test Assays for the Forensic Identification of Seminal Fluid |journal= Journal of Forensic Science |year=1999 |volume=44 |pages=1057–60 |url= http://projects.nfstc.org/workshops/resources/articles/Evaluation%20of%20prostate-specific%20antigen%20(PSA)%20membrane%20test%20assays%20for%20the%20forensic%20identification%20of%20seminal%20fluid.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> This level of antigen has been shown to be present in the peripheral blood of males with prostate cancer, and rarely in female urine samples and breast milk.<ref name=fluids/> No studies have been performed to assess the PSA levels in the tissues and secretions of pre-pubescent children. Therefore, the presence of PSA from a high sensitivity (4&nbsp;ng/mL) test cannot conclusively identify the presence of semen, so care must be taken with the interpretation of such results.

== Mechanism of action ==
The physiological function of KLK3 is the dissolution of the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of [[semenogelin]]s and [[fibronectin]]. Its proteolic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of [[KLK2]], another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive. Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well regulated manner.

== Biochemistry ==
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA, also known as '''kallikrein III''', '''seminin''', '''semenogelase''', '''γ-seminoprotein''' and '''P-30 antigen''') is a 34 [[Atomic mass unit|kD]] [[glycoprotein]] produced almost exclusively by the [[prostate gland]]. It is a [[serine protease]] ({{EC number|3.4.21.77}}) [[enzyme]], the [[gene]] of which is located on the nineteenth [[chromosome]] (19q13) in humans.<ref name="pmid14607215">{{cite journal | author = Lilja H | title = Biology of prostate-specific antigen | journal = Urology | volume = 62 | issue = 5 Suppl 1 | pages = 27–33 | year = 2003 | month = November | pmid = 14607215 | doi = 10.1016/S0090-4295(03)00775-1 | url =   }}</ref>

==Serum levels==
PSA is normally present in the [[blood]] at very low levels. The [[reference range]] of less than 4&nbsp;ng/mL for the first commercial PSA test, the Hybritech Tandem-R PSA test released in February 1986, was based on a study that found 99% of 472 apparently healthy men had a total PSA level below 4&nbsp;ng/mL—the upper limit of normal is much less than 4&nbsp;ng/mL.<!--

However, the PSA rate of rise may have value in prostate cancer prognosis. Men with prostate cancer whose PSA level increased by more than 2.0&nbsp;ng per milliliter during the year before the diagnosis of prostate cancer have a higher risk of death from prostate cancer despite undergoing [[Radical retropubic prostatectomy|radical prostatectomy]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = D'Amico A, Chen M, Roehl K, Catalona W | title = Preoperative PSA velocity and the risk of death from prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 351 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–35 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15247353 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa032975}}</ref>

===Free PSA===
Most PSA in the blood is bound to serum proteins. A small amount is not protein bound and is called 'free PSA'. In men with prostate cancer the ratio of free (unbound) PSA to total PSA is decreased. The risk of cancer increases if the free to total ratio is less than 25%. (See graph at right.) The lower the ratio is, the greater the probability of prostate cancer. Measuring the ratio of free to total PSA appears to be particularly promising for eliminating unnecessary [[Biopsy|biopsies]] in men with PSA levels between 4 and 10&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Catalona W, Smith D, Ornstein D | title = Prostate cancer detection in men with serum PSA concentrations of 2.6 to 4.0 ng/mL and benign prostate examination.

===Inactive PSA===
The PSA test in 1994 failed to differentiate between prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and the commercial assay kits for PSA did not provide correct PSA values.

It is now clear that the term prostate-specific antigen is a [[misnomer]]: it is an [[antigen]] but is not specific to the prostate. Although present in large amounts in prostatic tissue and semen, it has been detected in other body fluids and tissues.<ref name=fluids>{{cite journal | author = Dale L. Laux, M.S. & Sarah E.

In women, PSA is found in [[female ejaculation|female ejaculate]] at concentrations roughly equal to that found in male semen.<ref name="wimpissinger">{{cite journal |author=Wimpissinger F, Stifter K, Grin W, Stackl W |title=The female prostate revisited: perineal ultrasound and biochemical studies of female ejaculate |journal=J Sex Med |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1388–93; discussion 1393 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17634056 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00542.x |url=}}</ref> Other than semen and female ejaculate, the greatest concentrations of PSA in biological fluids are detected in breast milk and amniotic fluid. Low concentrations of PSA have been identified in the urethral glands, endometrium, normal breast tissue and salivary gland tissue. PSA also is found in the serum of women with breast, lung, or uterine cancer and in some patients with renal cancer.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stanley A Brosman |title= eMedicine: Prostate-Specific Antigen |publisher=[[WebMD]] |url= http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3465.HTM#section~CharacteristicsofProstateSpecificAntigen|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>
