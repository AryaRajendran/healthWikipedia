The '''allethrins''' are a pair of related synthetic compounds used in [[insecticides]].  They are synthetic [[pyrethroid]]s, a synthetic form of a chemical found naturally in the [[chrysanthemum]] flower. They were first synthesized in the United States by Milton S. Schechter in 1949. Allethrin was the first pyrethroid.

The compounds have low [[toxicity]] for humans and birds, and are used in many household [[insecticide]]s such as [[Raid (insecticide)|RAID]] as well as [[mosquito coil]]s. They are, however, highly toxic to fish and bees. Insects subject to its exposure become paralyzed (nervous system effect) before dying. They are also highly toxic to cats because{{fact|date=July 2012}} they either do not produce, or produce less of certain [[isoform]]s of [[glucuronosyltransferase]], which serve in hepatic detoxifying metabolism pathways.<ref>{{pmid|10862526}}</ref>

They are also used as an [[ultra-low volume]] spray for outdoor [[mosquito]] control.

==Stereochemistry==
Each allethrin consists of the eight possible [[stereoisomers]]. A partly enantiopure variant of allethrin I, consisting of only two stereoisomers, is called [[bioallethrin]].
