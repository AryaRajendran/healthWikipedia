In the heat of the savannas, better cooling mechanisms were required, which were achieved by the loss of body hair and development of more efficient [[sweating]]. The loss of body hair led to the development of dark skin pigmentation, which acted as a mechanism of natural selection against [[folate]] depletion, and to a lesser extent, [[Direct DNA damage|DNA damage]]. The primary factor contributing to the evolution of dark skin pigmentation was the breakdown of folate in reaction to [[ultraviolet radiation]]; the relationship between folate breakdown induced by ultraviolet radiation and reduced fitness as a failure of normal [[embryogenesis]] and [[spermatogenesis]] led to the selection of dark skin pigmentation.

Humans with dark skin pigmentation have skin naturally rich in [[melanin]] (especially [[eumelanin]]), and have more [[melanosomes]] which provide a superior protection against the deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiation. This helps the body to retain its folate reserves and protects against damage to the DNA.<ref name="jabl1"/><ref name=Nielsen_a>{{cite journal|last=Nielsen ''et al''.|title=The importance of the depth distribution of melanin in skin for DNA protection and other photobiological processes|journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology|volume=82|pages=194–198}}</ref>

Dark-skinned people who live in high latitudes with mild sunlight are at an increased risk - especially in the winter - of [[vitamin D]] [[Vitamin D deficiency|deficiency]]. As a consequence of vitamin D deficiency, they are at a higher risk of developing [[rickets]], and numerous types of cancers, and possibly cardiovascular disease and low immune system activity.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=linus>{{cite web|last=Jane|first=Higdon|title=Vitamin D|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/|work=Micronutrient Information Center|publisher=Linus Pauling Institute|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

The distribution of indigenous dark-skinned populations is highly correlated with the high ultraviolet radiation levels of the regions inhabited by them. Dark-skinned indigenous populations almost exclusively live near the equator in [[tropical]] areas with intense sunlight: Australia, Melanesia, New Guinea, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to mass migration and increased mobility of people between geographical regions in the recent past, dark-skinned populations today are found all over the world.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=oneil1>{{cite web|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|title=Skin Color Adaptation|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_4.htm|work=Human Biological Adaptability: Skin Color as an Adaptation|publisher=Palomar|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=oneil2>{{cite web|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|title=Overview|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_1.htm|work=Modern Human Variation|publisher=Palomer|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

==Evolution==
People who lived in areas of intense sunlight developed dark skin colouration to protect against ultraviolet light and to protect their body mainly from [[folate]] depletion. [[Evolution]]ary pigmentation of the skin was caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation of the sun. As [[hominids]] gradually lost their [[fur]] (between 4.5 and 2 million years ago) to allow for better cooling through sweating, their naked and lightly pigmented skin was exposed to sunlight. In the tropics, natural selection favoured dark-skinned human populations as high levels of skin pigmentation protected against the harmful effects of sunlight. Indigenous populations’ skin reflectance (the amount of sunlight the skin reflects) and the actual UV radiation in a particular geographic area is highly correlated, which supports this idea. Genetic evidence also supports this notion, demonstrating that around 1.2 million years ago there was a strong evolutionary pressure which acted on the development of dark skin pigmentation in early members of the genus [[Homo]].<ref name=jabl04b>{{cite journal|last=Nina|first=Jablonski|title=The evolution of human skin and skin color|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=33|pages=585–623}}</ref> The effect of sunlight on folic acid levels has been crucial in the development of dark skin.<ref name="jabl1">{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=pbs>{{cite web|last=Gina|first=Kirchweger|title=The Biology of Skin Color: Black and White|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/07/3/text_pop/l_073_04.html|work=Evolution Library|publisher=PBS|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>
[[File:Kiang West savanna.jpg|thumb|250px|[[East Africa]]n [[savanna]]s, where most of the supposed [[Hominini|hominid]] evolution of dark skin took place]]
Our earliest ancestors, just like our closest relatives – [[chimpanzee]]s – today, had light skin.<ref name=Jabl06>{{cite book|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|title=Skin: a Natural History|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}</ref>  About 7 million years ago [[human]] and chimpanzee lineages diverged, and between 4.5 and 2 million years ago early humans moved out of rainforests to the [[East Africa]]n savannas.<ref name="oneil1">{{cite web}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The Ancestor's Tale|year=2004}}</ref> They not only had to cope with more intense sunlight but had to develop a better cooling system. It was harder to get food in the hot savannas and as [[mammalian brain]]s are prone to overheating – 5 or 6 °C rise in temperature can lead to heatstroke – so there was a need for the development of better heat regulation. The solution was sweating and loss of body hair.<ref name="oneil1">{{cite web}}</ref>

Sweating dissipated heat through evaporation. Early humans, like chimpanzees now, had few sweat glands, and most of them were located in the palms of the hand and the soles of feet. At times, individuals with more sweat glands were born. These humans could search for food and hunt for longer periods before being forced back to the shades. The more they could forage, more and healthier offspring they could produce, and higher the chance they had to pass on their genes for abundant sweat glands. With less hair, sweat could evaporate more easily and cool the body of humans faster. But this less-hairy skin proved to be a problem for humans living in areas of intense UV radiation. As heavy UV radiation has harmful effects, the solution was to develop dark skin as a protection. A few million years of evolution later, early humans had sparse body hair and more than 2 million sweat glands in their body.<ref name="oneil1">{{cite web}}</ref><ref name=Mont>{{cite journal|last=Montagna|first=W.|title=The consequences of having naked skin|journal=Birth Defects: Original Article Series|volume=17|pages=1–7}}</ref><ref name=Lang>{{cite journal|last=Langbein ''et al''.|title=Characterization of a novel human type II epithelial keratin K1b, specifically expressed in eccrine sweat glands|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|year=2005|volume=125|pages=428–444}}</ref>

Hairlessness, however, is particularly vulnerable to be damaged by ultraviolet light. Scientists have long assumed that humans evolved melanin in order to absorb or scatter harmful sun radiation. Some researchers assumed that melanin protects against [[skin cancer]].  While high UV radiation can cause skin cancer, the development of cancer usually occurs after child bearing age. As natural selection favours individuals with traits of reproductive success, skin cancer had little effect on the evolution of dark skin. Previous hypotheses suggested that sunburned nipples impeded breastfeeding, but a slight tan is enough to protect mothers against this issue.<ref name="oneil1">{{cite web}}</ref><ref name=Blum>{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=H.F.|title=Does the melanin pigment of human skin have adaptive value?|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1961|volume=36|pages=50–63}}</ref><ref name=Rige>{{cite journal|last=Rigel|first=D.S.|title=Cutaneous ultraviolet exposure and its relationship to the development of skin cancer|journal=Journal of American Academy of Dermatology|volume=58|pages=S129-S132}}</ref><ref name="Jemal et al. 678–683">{{cite journal|last=Jemal ''et al''.|title=Recent trends in cutaneous melanoma incidence among white in the United States|journal=Journal of National Cancer Institute|volume=93|pages=678–683}}</ref>

A 1978 study examined the effect of sunlight on [[folate]] – a vitamin B complex – levels. The study found that even short periods of intense sunlight are able to halve folate levels if someone has light skin. Low folate levels are correlated with neural tube defects, such as [[anencephaly]] and [[spina bifida]]. UV rays can strip away folate, which is important to the development of healthy [[foetus]]es.  In these abnormalities children are born with incomplete brain or spinal cord.

She also found that folate was crucial to sperm development; some [[male contraception]] drugs are based on folate inhibition. It has been found that folate may have been the driving force behind the evolution of dark skin.<ref name="jabl1">{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=Jabl00>{{cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|coauthors=Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2000|volume=39|pages=57–106}}</ref>

Humans moved out of [[Africa]] sometime between 120,000 and 65,000 years ago<ref>Tim Appenzeller, Nature [http://www.nature.com/news/human-migrations-eastern-odyssey-1.10560 Human migrations: Eastern odyssey] 485, 24–26 doi:10.1038/485024a 02 May 2012</ref> and populations with [[light skin]] pigmentation evolved in climates of little sunlight. Light skin pigmentation protects against vitamin D deficiency. It is known that dark-skinned people who have moved to climates of limited sunlight can develop vitamin D related conditions such as [[rickets]], and different forms of [[cancer]].<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Effects of Ecology and Climate on Human Physical Variations|url=http://www.culturechange.org/cms/content/view/174/65/|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

===Earlier hypotheses===

The main other hypotheses that have been put forward through history to explain the evolution of dark skin coloration relate to increased mortality due skin cancers, enhanced fitness as a result of protection against sunburns, and increasing benefits of due to antibacterial properties of [[eumelanin]].<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

The mortality rates of melanoma has been very low (less than 5 per 100 000) before the mid-20th century.

Studies have found that even serious sunburns could not affect sweat gland function and [[thermoregulation]]. There are no data or studies that support that sunburn can cause damage so serious that can affect reproductive success.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

Another group of hypotheses contended that dark skin pigmentation developed as antibacterial protection against tropical infectious diseases and parasites. Although it is true that eumelanin has antibacterial properties, its importance is secondary as a physical absorbed to protect against UVR induced damage. This hypothesis is not consistent with the evidence that most of the hominid evolution took place in savanna environment and not in tropical rainforests.<ref name=Epel>{{cite journal|last=Epel et al.|title=Development in the floating world: defenses of eggs and embryos against damage from UV radiation|journal=American Zoologist|year=1999|volume=39|pages=271–278}}</ref> The antimicrobial hypothesis also does not explain why some populations (like the [[Inuit]]s or [[Tibetans]]) who live far from the tropics and are exposed to high UVR darker skin pigmentation than their surrounding populations.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

==Biochemistry and genetics==
[[File:Darkly pigmented skin.jpg|500px|right|Darkly pigmented skin]]
Dark-skinned humans have high amount of [[melanin]] found in their skin. Melanin is derivative of the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]]. [[Eumelanin]] is the dominant form of melanin found in human skin. Eumelanin protects tissues and [[DNA]] from radiation damage of UV light. Melanin is produced in specialized cells called [[melanocyte]]s, which are found at the lowest level of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Haass|first=N.K.|coauthors=et al.|title=Adhesion, migration and communications in melanocytes and melanoma|journal=Pigment Cell Research|year=2005|volume=18|pages=150–159}}</ref> Melanin is produced inside small membrane-bound packages called [[melanosomes]]. People with naturally occurring dark skin have melanosomes which are clumped, large, and full of eumelanin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thong|first=H.Y.|coauthors=''et al''.|title=The patterns of melanosome distribution in keratinocytes of human skin as one determining factor of skin colour|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|year=2003|volume=149|pages=498–505}}</ref><ref name="Tadokoro 2005 1326–1332">{{cite journal|last=Tadokoro|first=T|coauthors=''et al''.|title=Mechanisms of skin tanning in different racial/ethnic groups in response to ultraviolet radiation|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|year=2005|volume=124|pages=1326–1332}}</ref> A four-fold difference in naturally occurring dark skin gives seven to eightfold protection against DNA damage,<ref name="Tadokoro 2005 1326–1332"/> but even the darkest skin colour cannot protect against all damage to DNA.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

Dark skin offers great protection against UVR because of its eumelanin contect, its superb UVR-absorbing capabilites of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought to the surface of the skin from the deeps of the epidermis.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref> For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. [[Keratocytes]] from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Minwala|first=S|coauthors=''et al''.|title=Keratinocytes Play a Role in Regulating Distribution Patterns of Recipient Melanosomes In Vitro|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|year=2001|volume=117|pages=341–347}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Szabo|first=G|coauthors=''et al''.|title=Racial differences in the fate of melanosomes in human epidermis|journal=Nature|volume=222|pages=1081–1082}}</ref> Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better protection against sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays.<ref name=jabl04b>{{cite journal}}</ref> Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture [[Reactive oxygen species|free radical]]s, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin.<ref name=jabl04b>{{cite journal}}</ref> Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA.<ref name=jabl04b>{{cite journal}}</ref> Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even of dark skin as its effect on [[Langerhans cell]]s.<ref name=jabl04b>{{cite journal}}</ref> The [[Stratum corneum]] of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.<ref name=jabl04b>{{cite journal}}</ref>

Dark skin does not increase the body’s heat intake in conditions of intense solar radiation.  This is because half of the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, in the form of [[infrared light]], is absorbed similarly regardless of skin coloration.<ref name=jabl04b>{{cite journal}}</ref>

Skin colour is a [[polygenic]] trait, which means that several different [[gene]]s are involved in determining a specific [[phenotype]]. Many genes work together in complex, additive, and non-additive combinations to determine the skin colour of an individual. The skin colour variations are [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] from light to dark, as it is usual for polygenic traits.<ref name=Lewi>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Ricki|title=Human genetics : concepts and applications|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Co.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-352530-3|pages=135–136|edition=10th ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Skin Color|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/bindon/ant570/topics/Skincolor.PDF}}</ref>

Data collected from studies on ''MC1R'' gene has shown that there is a lack of diversity in dark-skinned African samples in the allele of the gene compared to non-African populations.  This is remarkable given that the number of polymorphisms for almost all genes in the human gene pool is greater in African samples than in any other geographic region. So, while the ''MC1R''f gene does not significantly contribute to variation in skin colour around the world, the allele found in high levels in African populations probably protects against UV radiation and was probably important in the evolution of dark skin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rana|first=B.K.|coauthors=et al.|title=High polymorphism at the human melanocortin 1 receptor locus|journal=Genetics|year=1999|volume=151|pages=1547–1557}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Effects of Ecology and Climate on Human Physical Variations|url=http://www.culturechange.org/cms/content/view/174/65/}}</ref>

Skin colour seems to vary mostly due to variations in a number of genes (''TYR'', ''TYRP1'', ''OCA2'', ''SLC45A2'', ''SLC24A5'', ''MC1R'', ''KITLG'' and ''SLC24A4'') of large effect and several other genes of small effect. This does not take into account the effects of [[epistasis]], which would probably increase the number of related genes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Razib|title=Genetics of human pigmentation: Gene expression|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/03/genetics-of-human-pigmentation/#.UMUf1oPAeSo|publisher=Discover Magazine|accessdate=11 December 2012|year=2009}}</ref>

==Health implications==

Skin pigmentation is an [[evolutionary adaptation]] to various UVR levels around the world. As a consequence there are many health implications that are the product of population movements of humans of certain skin pigmentation to new environments with different levels of UVR.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref> Modern humans are often ignorant of their evolutionary history at their peril.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref> Cultural practices that increase problems of conditions among dark-skinned populations are traditional [[clothing]] and [[vitamin D]]-poor [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dark-skinned immigrant urged to take vitamin D|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2010/02/12/ottawa-immigrants-vitamin-d.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

===Advantages of dark skin pigmentation in high sunlight environments===

Dark pigmented people living in high sunlight environments are at an advantage due to the high amounts of melanin produced in their skin. The dark pigmentation protects from DNA damage and absorbs the right amounts of UV radiation needed by the body, as well as protects against folate depletion. Because the skin is protected by the melanin, dark pigmented people have a lower chance of developing [[skin cancer]] and conditions related to [[folate deficiency]], such as [[neural tube defects]].<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

===Disadvantages of dark skin pigmentation in low sunlight environments===
[[File:XrayRicketsLegssmall.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Rickets]] and folate deficiency are associated with dark skin]]
Dark-skinned people living in low sunlight environments have been recorded to be very susceptible to [[vitamin D deficiency]] due to reduced [[Vitamin_D#Synthesis|vitamin D synthesis]]. For humans with dark skin in climates of low UVR, it can take about 2 hours to produce the same amount of vitamin D as humans with light skin produce in 15 minutes. Dark-skinned people having a high body-mass index and not taking vitamin D supplements were associated with vitamin D deficiency.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dark-skinned immigrants urged to take vitamin D|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2010/02/12/ottawa-immigrants-vitamin-d.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Oglesby|first=Erika|title=Darker Skin? More Vitamin D, Please!|url=http://www.care2.com/greenliving/vitamin-d-melanin.html|publisher=Care2|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> The most prevalent disease to follow vitamin D deficiency is [[rickets]], the softening of bones in children potentially leading to fractures and deformity. Rickets is caused by reduced vitamin D synthesis that causes an absence of vitamin D, which then causes the dietary calcium to not be properly absorbed. This disease in the past was commonly found among dark-skinned Americans of the southern part of the United States who migrated north into low sunlight environments. The popularity of sugary drinks and decreased time spent outside have contributed to significant rise of developing rickets. Deformities of the female pelvis related to severe rickets impair normal childbirth, which leads to higher mortality of the infant, mother, or both.

==Geographic Distribution==

There is a correlation between the geographic distribution of [[UV radiation]] (UVR) and the distribution of skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that have higher amounts of UVR have darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer the [[equator]]. Areas that are further away from the equator generally closer to the poles have a lower concentration of UVR, and contain lighter-skinned populations. This is the result of human evolution which contributed to variable melanin content in the skin to adapt to certain environments. A larger percentage of dark skinned people are found in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] because latitudinal land mass distribution is disproportionate.<ref name=jabl04b>{{cite journal}}</ref>  Although the present distribution of skin colour variation does not completely reflect the correlation of intense UVR and dark skin pigmentation due to mass migration and movement of peoples across continents in the recent past, indigenous population groups do reflect this correlation.<ref name="jabl04b">{{cite journal}}</ref>

Indigenous dark-skinned populations found in [[South Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Melanesia]], [[New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]], and [[Australia]] <ref name=oneil1>{{cite web}}</ref> all live in some of the areas with the highest UV radiation in the world and have retained very dark skin pigmentations as protection from the harmful sun rays <ref name="jabl04b">{{cite journal}}</ref> [[Evolution]] has restricted humans to darker skin in tropical latitudes, especially in non-forested regions, where ultraviolet radiation from the sun is usually the most intense. Different dark-skinned populations are not necessarily closely related genetically.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Jonathan|title=Interview with Jonathan Marks|url=http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-08.htm|work=Race - The Power of an Illusion|publisher=PBS|accessdate=3 January 2013|quote=Certainly dark skin is present all over the world in different populations. Indigenous Australians, indigenous peoples of India, indigenous peoples of Africa are all very darkly pigmented even though they're not particularly closely related.}}</ref> Before the modern mass migration the majority of dark pigmented people lived within 20º of the equator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Modern human variation: overview|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_4.htm}}</ref>

===Australia===
The [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] of [[Australia]], as with all humans, are descendents of African migrants, and their ancestors may have been among the first major groups to leave Africa around 50,000 years ago. Despite early migrations, genetic evidence has pointed out that the indigenous peoples of Australia are genetically very dissimilar to the dark-skinned populations of Africa and that they are more closely related to [[Eurasia]]n populations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aboriginal Genome|url=http://www.illumina.com/documents/icommunity/article_2012_04_Aboriginal_Genome.pdf}}</ref>

The term  black initially has been applied as a reference to the skin pigmentation of the aborigines of Australia; today it has been embraced by aboriginal activists as a term for shared [[culture]] and identity, regardless of skin colour.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Proclamation|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/4219798}}</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/aboriginal-identity-goes-beyond-skin-colour-20110406-1d40r.html Andrew Bolt On Trial On Racism Charges<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Melanesia===
[[Melanesia]], a subregion of [[Oceania]], whose name means “black islands”, have several islands that are inhabited by [[Melanesians|people]] with dark skin pigmentation. The islands of Melanesia are located immediately north and northeast of Australia as well as east coast of Papua New Guinea.<ref>{{cite web|title=Papua Web|url=http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk1/rspas-1982/00.pdf}}</ref>

In the world, [[blond]] hair is exceptionally rare outside Europe, and Southwest Asia, especially among dark-skinned populations. However, Melanesians are one of dark-skinned human populations known to have naturally occurring blond hair.<ref>{{cite news

===New Guinea===
The indigenous [[Papuan people]] of [[New Guinea]] have dark skin pigmentation and have inhabited the island for at least 40,000 years. Due to their similar phenotype and the location of New Guinea being in the migration route taken by Indigenous Australians, it was generally believed that Papuans and Aboriginal Australians shared a common origin. However, a 1999 study failed to find clear indications of a single shared genetic origin between the two populations, suggesting multiple waves of migration into [[Sahul]] with distinct ancestries.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume= 65 |pages=808–828 |year=1999 |title=Peopling of Sahul: mtDNA Variation in Aboriginal Australian and Papua New Guinean Populations |authors=Alan J.

{{Main|Colorism}}

The preference or disfavour for darker skin has varied depending on geographical area and time. Today, darker skin is viewed as fashionable and as a sign of well-being in some societies. This resulted in the development of tanning industry in several countries. However, in some countries, dark skin is not seen as highly desirable or indicative of higher class, especially among [[women]].<ref name="jabl04b"/>
