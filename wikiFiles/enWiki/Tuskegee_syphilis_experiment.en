The Public Health Service, working with the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]], began the study in 1932. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished [[sharecroppers]] from Macon County, Alabama; 399 who had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 201<ref>Center for disease control and prevention </ref> without the disease. For participating in the study, the men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance. They were never told they had syphilis, nor were they ever treated for it. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control]], the men were told they were being treated for "bad blood", a local term for various illnesses that include syphilis, anemia, and fatigue.

The 40-year study was controversial for reasons related to [[medical ethics|ethical standards]]; primarily because researchers knowingly failed to treat patients appropriately after the 1940s validation of [[penicillin]] as an effective cure for the disease they were studying. Revelation of study failures by a [[whistleblower]] led to major changes in U.S. law and regulation on the protection of participants in clinical studies. Now studies require [[informed consent]] (with exceptions possible for U.S. Federal agencies which can be kept secret by Executive Order),<ref>{{cite web | title = Code of Federal Regulations Title 45 Part 46 Protections of Human Subjects 46.1.1(i) | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Humand Services | date = 2009-01-15 | url = http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/ohrpregulations.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate = 2010-02-22}}</ref>{{Not in source|date=January 2013}} communication of [[diagnosis]], and accurate reporting of test results.<ref>{{cite web | title = Final Report of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee | publisher = Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee | date = 1996-05-20 | url = http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/medical_history/bad_blood/report.cfm|accessdate = 2008-12-04}}</ref>

By 1947, penicillin had become the standard treatment for syphilis. Choices available to the doctors involved in the study might have included treating all syphilitic subjects and closing the study, or splitting off a [[control group]] for testing with penicillin. Instead, the Tuskegee scientists continued the study without treating any participants and withholding penicillin and information about it from the patients. In addition, scientists prevented participants from accessing syphilis treatment programs available to others in the area.<ref name="nyfp"/>  The study continued, under numerous US Public Health Service supervisors, until 1972, when a leak to the press eventually resulted in its termination on November 16.<ref>{{cite web | title = “I Didn’t Want to Believe It”: Lessons from Tuskegee 40 Years Later | publisher = Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona | date = 2012-11-25 | url = http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/11/15/i-didnt-want-to-believe-it-lessons-from-tuskegee-40-years-later/|accessdate = 2012-11-25}}</ref> The victims of the study included numerous men who died of syphilis, wives who contracted the disease, and children born with [[congenital syphilis]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Heller J | title =Syphilis Victims in U.S. Study Went Untreated for 40 Years; Syphilis Victims Got No Therapy | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40616F6345A137B93C4AB178CD85F468785F9 | work=New York Times | agency= Associated Press | date=1972-07-26 | accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref>

[[File:Oliver Wenger.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[Oliver Wenger]]]]
The [[venereal disease]] section of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] (PHS) formed a [[study group]] in 1932 at its national headquarters. Taliaferro Clark was credited with its origin. His initial goal was to follow untreated syphilis in a group of black men for 6 to 9 months, and then follow up with a treatment phase. When he understood the intention of other study members to use deceptive practices, Clark disagreed with the plan to conduct an extended study.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} He retired the year after the study began.

Representing the PHS, Clark had solicited the participation of the [[Tuskegee Institute]] (a well-known [[historically black college]] in Alabama, now known as Tuskegee University) and also the inclusion of the Arkansas regional PHS office. Eugene Dibble, an African American doctor, was head of the John Andrew Hospital at the Tuskegee Institute. Oliver C. Wenger, a Caucasian, was director of the regional PHS Venereal Disease Clinic in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. He and his staff took a lead in developing study procedures.

Wenger and his staff played a critical role in developing early study protocols. Wenger continued to advise and assist the Tuskegee Study when it turned into a long-term, no-treatment observational study.<ref>{{cite book |author=DiClemente RJ, Blumenthal DS|title=Community-based health research: issues and methods |publisher=Springer Pub |location=New York |year=2003 |page=50 |isbn=0-8261-2025-3 |oclc= |url = http://www.google.co.in/books?id=KN_-9lwSI5oC |accessdate=}}</ref>

[[Raymond A. Vonderlehr]] was appointed on-site director of the research program and developed the policies that shaped the long-term follow-up section of the project. For example, he decided to gain the "[[informed consent|consent]]" of the subjects for [[lumbar puncture|spinal taps]] (to look for signs of [[neurosyphilis]]) by depicting the diagnostic test as a "special free treatment". Vonderlehr retired as head of the venereal disease section in 1943, shortly after penicillin had first been shown to be a cure for syphilis.

Several [[African American]] health workers and educators associated with [[Tuskegee Institute]] helped the PHS to carry out its experimentation and played a critical role in its progression, though the extent to which they were aware of methodology of the study is not clear in all cases. [[Robert Russa Moton]], the head of Tuskegee Institute at the time, and [[Eugene Dibble]], of the Tuskegee Medical Hospital, both lent their endorsement and institutional resources to the government study. Nurse Eunice Rivers, an African-American trained at Tuskegee Institute who worked at its affiliated John Andrew Hospital, was recruited at the start of the study.

Vonderlehr was a strong advocate for Nurse Rivers' participation, as she was the direct link to the community. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the Tuskegee Study began by offering lower class African Americans, who often could not afford health care, the chance to join "Miss Rivers' Lodge". Patients were to receive free physical examinations at [[Tuskegee University]], free rides to and from the clinic, hot meals on examination days, and free treatment for minor ailments.

Based on the available health care resources, Nurse Rivers believed that the benefits of the study to the men outweighed the risks.

As the study became long term, Nurse Rivers became the chief person with continuity. Unlike the changing state of national, regional and on-site PHS administrators, doctors, and researchers, Rivers stayed at Tuskegee University. She was the only study staff person to work with participants for the full 40 years. By the 1950s, Nurse Rivers had become pivotal to the study—her personal knowledge of the subjects enabled maintenance of long-term follow up.

Historians found evidence that most of the African American staff that assisted the Tuskegee Experiments were under the belief that they were part of a medical experiment that gave them the opportunity to act in the best interests of poor Black residents of Tuskegee.

In the study's later years, John R. Heller led the national division.<!-- Need years -->

By the late 1940s, doctors, hospitals and public health centers throughout the country routinely treated diagnosed syphilis with penicillin. In the period following World War II, the revelation of the [[Holocaust]] and related [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazi medical abuses]] brought about changes in international law. Western allies formulated the [[Nuremberg Code]] to protect the rights of research subjects. No one appeared to have reevaluated the protocols of the Tuskegee Study according to the new standards.

In 1972 the Tuskegee Study was brought to public and national attention by a [[whistleblower]], who gave information to the ''[[Washington Star]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]''. Heller of PHS still defended the [[medical ethics|ethics]] of the study, stating: "The men's status did not warrant ethical debate. They were subjects, not patients; clinical material, not sick people."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuskegee.edu/about_us/centers_of_excellence/bioethics_center/impact_on_health_care.aspx |title=Impact on Health Care|publisher=Tuskegee University | accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>

===Study details===
[[File:Tuskeegee study.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Subject blood draw, c. 1953]]

A Norwegian study in 1928 had reported on the [[pathology|pathologic]] manifestations of untreated syphilis in several hundred white males. This study is known as a [[retrospective study]] since investigators pieced together information from the histories of patients who had already contracted syphilis but remained untreated for some time.
[[File:Tuskegee-syphilis-study subjects-talking-to-nurse-eunice-rivers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Subjects talking with study coordinator, Nurse Eunice Rivers]]

The Tuskegee study group decided to build on the Oslo work and perform a [[prospective study]] to complement it. In the earlier phases of the study this was not inherently unethical since there was nothing the investigators could do therapeutically at the time.  Researchers could study the natural progression of the disease as long as they did not harm their subjects. They reasoned that the knowledge gained would benefit humankind; however, it was determined afterward that the doctors did harm their subjects by depriving them of appropriate treatment once it had been discovered. The study was characterized as "the longest non-therapeutic experiment on human beings in medical history."<ref name="nyfp">{{cite book|author=Jones J|title=Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment|isbn=0-02-916676-4|publisher=Free Press| location=New York|year=1981}}</ref>

The US health service Tuskegee study began as a [[clinical trial]] of the incidence of syphilis in the [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon County]] population. Initially, subjects were studied for six to eight months and then treated with contemporary methods including [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]], [[mercury (element)|mercurial]] ointments, and [[bismuth]]. These methods were, at best, mildly effective.  The disadvantage that these treatments were all highly toxic was balanced by the fact that no other methods were known. The Tuskegee Institute participated in the study, as its representatives understood the intent was to benefit public health in the local poor population.<ref name="Parker">{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Laura|title='Bad Blood' Still Flows In Tuskegee Study|publisher= USA Today|date=1997-04-28|url=http://www.tuskegee.edu/global/Story.asp?s=1209852|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> The Tuskegee University-affiliated hospital effectively loaned the PHS its medical facilities and other predominantly black institutions and local black doctors participated as well. The [[Rosenwald Fund]], a major [[Chicago]]-based philanthropy devoted to black education and community development in [[Southern United States|the South]], provided financial support to pay for the eventual treatment of the patients. Study researchers initially recruited 399 syphilitic Black men, and 201 healthy Black men as controls.[[File:Table depicting number of participants in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study showing number of patients with syphilis and... - NARA - 281642.tif|thumb|right|250px|Table from U.S. Public Health Service summarising participants in the study.]]

Continuing effects of the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] and the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] led the Rosenwald Fund to withdraw its offer of funding. Study directors issued a final report as they thought this might mean the end of the study once funding to buy medication for the treatment phase of the study was withdrawn.

[[Medical ethics]] considerations were limited from the start and rapidly deteriorated. To ensure that the men would show up for the possibly dangerous, painful, diagnostic, and non-therapeutic [[Lumbar puncture|spinal taps]], the doctors sent the 400 patients a misleading letter titled "Last Chance for Special Free Treatment". The study also required all participants to undergo an [[autopsy]] after death in order to receive funeral benefits. After penicillin was discovered as a cure, researchers continued to deny such treatment to many study participants. Many patients were lied to and given [[placebo]] treatments so researchers could observe the full, long-term progression of the fatal disease.<ref name="Parker"/>

[[File:Tuskegee-syphilis-study doctor injects subject with placebo.gif|thumb|left|250px|Taking a blood sample as part of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.]]
The Tuskegee Study published its first clinical data in 1934 and issued their first major report in 1936. This was prior to the discovery of penicillin as a safe and effective treatment for syphilis. The study was not secret since reports and data sets were published to the medical community throughout its duration.

During [[World War II]], 250 of the subject men registered for the [[Conscription|draft]]. These men were consequently diagnosed as having syphilis at military induction centers and ordered to obtain treatment for syphilis before they could be taken into the armed services.<ref name="ukcph">{{cite web|title=Doctor of Public Health Student Handbook|publisher=University of Kentucky College of Public Health|year=2004|page=17|url=http://www.ukcph.org/Portals/0/DoctorofPublicHealth/Dr.P.HStudentHandbook.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

PHS researchers attempted to prevent them from getting treatment, thus depriving them of chances for a cure. A PHS representative was quoted at the time as saying: "So far, we are keeping the known positive patients from getting treatment."<ref name="ukcph"/> Despite this, 96% of the 90 original test subjects reexamined in 1963 had received either arsenical or penicillin treatments from another health provider.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard A Shweder |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/articles/0000000CA34A.htm |title=spiked-essays &#124; Essay &#124; Tuskegee re-examined |publisher=Spiked-online.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>

By 1947 penicillin had become standard therapy for syphilis. The US government sponsored several [[public health]] programs to form "rapid treatment centers" to eradicate the disease. When campaigns to eradicate venereal disease came to Macon County, study researchers prevented their patients from participating.<ref name="ukcph"/>

By the end of the study in 1972, only 74 of the test subjects were alive. Of the original 399 men, 28 had died of syphilis, 100 were dead of related complications, 40 of their wives had been infected and 19 of their children were born with [[congenital syphilis]].

==Non-consensual experiments in Guatemala==
{{Main|Syphilis experiments in Guatemala}}
In October 2010 it was revealed that in [[Guatemala]], Public Health Service doctors went even further.  It was reported that from 1946 to 1948, American doctors deliberately infected prisoners, soldiers, and patients in a mental hospital with syphilis and, in some cases, gonorrhea, with the cooperation of some Guatemalan health ministries and officials. A total of 696 men and women were exposed to syphilis without the [[informed consent]] of the subjects.  When the subjects contracted the disease they were given [[antibiotics]] though it is unclear if all infected parties were cured.<ref>{{cite news | author=Chris McGreal | title =US says sorry for 'outrageous and abhorrent' Guatemalan syphilis tests Experiments in 1940s saw hundreds of Guatemalan prisoners and soldiers deliberately infected to test effects of penicillin | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/01/us-apology-guatemala-syphilis-tests| work=Guardian UK | publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited | date=2010-10-01 | accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref>

In 1966 [[Peter Buxtun]], a PHS venereal-disease investigator in San Francisco, sent a letter to the national director of the Division of Venereal Diseases to express his concerns about the [[ethics]] and [[morality]] of the extended Tuskegee Study. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control]] (CDC), which by then controlled the study, reaffirmed the need to continue the study until completion; i.e., until all subjects had died and been autopsied.  To bolster its position, the CDC sought, and gained support for the continuation of the study, from local chapters of the [[National Medical Association]] (representing African-American physicians) and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).

In 1968 William Carter Jenkins, an African-American statistician in the [[U.S. Public Health Service|PHS]], part of the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW), founded and edited ''The Drum'', a newsletter devoted to ending racial [[discrimination]] in HEW. The cabinet-level department included the CDC. In ''The Drum'', Jenkins called for an end to the Tuskegee Study. He did not succeed; it is not clear who read his work.<ref>Bill Jenkins left the PHS in the mid-1970s for doctoral studies. In 1980, he joined the CDC Division of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, where he managed the Participants Health Benefits Program that ensured health services for survivors of the Tuskegee Study.</ref>

Buxtun finally went to the press in the early 1970s. The story broke first in the ''[[Washington Star]]'' on July 25, 1972. It became front-page news in the ''[[New York Times]]'' the following day. Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] called [[Congressional hearings]], at which Buxtun and HEW officials testified. As a result of public outcry the CDC and PHS appointed an ''[[ad hoc]]'' advisory panel to review the study. It determined the study was medically unjustified and ordered its termination. As part of the settlement of a [[class action lawsuit]] subsequently filed by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], the U.S. government paid $9 million (unadjusted for inflation) and agreed to provide free medical treatment to surviving participants and to surviving family members infected as a consequence of the study.

==Aftermath==

In 1974 Congress passed the [[National Research Act]] and created a [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research|commission]] to study and write regulations governing studies involving human participants. On May 16, 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] formally apologized and held a ceremony for the Tuskegee study participants: "What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry ... To our African American citizens, I am sorry that your federal government orchestrated a study so clearly racist."<ref>{{cite web
