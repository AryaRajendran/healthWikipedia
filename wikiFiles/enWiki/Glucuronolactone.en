'''Glucuronolactone''' is a naturally occurring chemical that is an important structural component of nearly all [[connective tissue]]s.<ref name="Merck"/>  Glucuronolactone is also found in many plant gums.<ref name="Merck"/>

== Physical and chemical properties ==
Glucuronolactone is a white solid odorless compound, soluble in hot and cold water. Its melting point ranges from 176 to 178&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Merck"/> The compound can exist in a monocyclic [[aldehyde]] form or in a [[bicyclic molecule|bicyclic]] [[hemiacetal]] ([[lactol]]) form.

== History ==

Glucuronolactone has received some notoriety due to [[urban legend]]s that it was a [[Vietnam War]]-era drug manufactured by the [[Government of the United States|American government]]. The [[rumor]] goes on to say that it was banned due to [[brain tumor]]-related deaths. The rumor has since been proven false, due to irreality of the cited ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' article and non-event "banning of its consumption". Furthermore, no warnings appear on the [[Food and Drug Administration]] website regarding its potential to cause brain tumors or other maladies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/medical/potables/redbull.asp|title=Bull Marketed|work=[[Snopes]]}}</ref>

== Uses ==

Glucuronolactone is rapidly absorbed and metabolized into non-toxic metabolites such as [[xylulose]]. In addition, humans may be able to use glucuronolactone as a precursor for [[ascorbic acid]] synthesis.<ref name="">{{cite journal | author = Baker EM, Bierman EL, Plough IC | title = Effect of D-glucuronic acid and D-glucuronolactone on ascorbic acid levels in blood and urine of man and dog | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 369–73 | year = 1960 | month = | pmid = 13795987| doi = | url =  }}</ref> According to ''[[The Merck Index]]'', it is also used as a [[Detoxification|detoxicant]].<ref>''Merck Index'', 14th ed., '''4467'''</ref>

Glucuronolactone is a popular ingredient in [[energy drinks]] with claims that it detoxifies the body. Although levels of glucuronolactone in energy drinks can far exceed those found in the rest of the diet, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) has concluded that exposure to glucuronolactone from regular consumption of energy drinks is not a safety concern.  The [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]] of glucuronolactone is 1000 mg/kg/day.<ref>{{cite web|title=EFSA - Opinion of the Scientific Committee/Scientific Panel: The use of taurine and D-glucurono-gamma-lactone as constituents of the so-called “energy” drinks|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/935.htm|publisher=European Food Safety Authority|accessdate=2012-05-04}}</ref>
