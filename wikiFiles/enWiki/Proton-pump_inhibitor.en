'''Proton-pump inhibitors''' ('''PPIs''') are a group of [[Medication|drug]]s whose main action is a pronounced and long-lasting reduction of [[gastric acid]] production. They are the most potent inhibitors of acid secretion available. The group followed and has largely superseded another group of [[pharmacology|pharmaceuticals]] with similar effects, but a different mode of action, called [[H2-receptor antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists]]. These drugs are among the most widely sold drugs in the world, and are generally considered effective.<ref>{{cite web |author=The Health Strategies Consultancy LLC |title=Follow The Pill: Understanding the U.S. Commercial Pharmaceutical Supply Chain |publisher=The Kaiser Family Foundation |month=March |year=2005 |url=http://www.kff.org/rxdrugs/7296.cfm}}</ref>  The vast majority of these drugs are [[benzimidazole]] derivatives, but promising new research indicates the [[imidazopyridine]] derivatives may be a more effective means of treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02943.x |title=Review article: The clinical pharmacology of proton pump inhibitors |year=2006 |last1=Sachs |first1=G. |last2=Shin |first2=J.

==Medical uses==
These drugs are used in the treatment of many conditions, such as:
{{div col|2}}
* [[Dyspepsia]]<ref name="Overview">{{cite journal|last1=Zajac|first1=P|last2=Holbrook|first2=A|last3=Super|first3=ME|last4=Vogt|first4=M |title=An overview: Current clinical guidelines for the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and management of dyspepsia|journal=Osteopathic Family Physician |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=79–85 |year=2013 |month=March–April |pmid=|doi=10.1016/j.osfp.2012.10.005}}</ref>

The effectiveness of PPIs has not been demonstrated in every case, despite their widespread use for these conditions. For example, they do not change the length of Barrett's esophagus.<ref name="pmid16556174">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02825.x |title=Continuous treatment of Barrett's oesophagus patients with proton pump inhibitors up to 13 years: Observations on regression and cancer incidence |year=2006 |last1=Cooper |first1=B.

==Adverse effects==
PPIs (as well as other antacid preparations), by suppressing acid-mediated breakdown of proteins, lead to an elevated risk of developing food allergies. These undigested proteins then pass into the gastrointestinal tract, potentially leading to sensitization to a range of foods or drugs. It is unclear whether this risk occurs with only long-term use or with short-term use as well.<ref name="pmid21121928">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2010.02511.x |title=Anti-acid medication as a risk factor for food allergy |year=2011 |last1=Pali-Schöll |first1=I. |last2=Jensen-Jarolim |first2=E. |journal=Allergy |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=469–77 |pmid=21121928}}</ref>

===Short-term===
In general, proton pump inhibitors are well tolerated, and the incidence of short-term adverse effects is relatively uncommon. The range and occurrence of [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]s are similar for all of the PPIs, though they have been reported more frequently with omeprazole. This may be due to its longer availability and, hence, clinical experience.
Common adverse effects include: [[headache]] (in 5.5% of users in clinical trials<ref name="natap">{{cite journal |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2009.05.015 |url=http://www.natap.org/2009/HIV/070409_02.htm |title=Evidence That Proton-Pump Inhibitor Therapy Induces the Symptoms it is Used to Treat |year=2009 |last1=McColl |first1=Kenneth E.L. |last2=Gillen |first2=Derek |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=137 |pages=20–2 |pmid=19482105 |issue=1}}</ref>), [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], and [[dizziness]].<ref name="Rossi">Rossi S, editor.

Because the body uses [[gastric acid]] to release it from food particles, decreased [[cyanocobalamin|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] absorption may occur with long-term use of PPIs, and may lead to [[Vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]].<ref name="Rossi" /><ref>{{cite news |work=Wall Street Journal |date=January 18, 2011 |title=Sluggish?

Infrequent adverse effects include [[rash]], [[itch]], [[flatulence]], [[constipation]], [[anxiety]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. In rare cases, PPI use may cause ‘idiosyncratic’ reactions, such as [[erythema multiforme]], [[pancreatitis]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], and [[acute interstitial nephritis]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1797.2006.00651.x |title=Proton pump inhibitors and acute interstitial nephritis: Report and analysis of 15 cases |year=2006 |last1=Simpson |first1=IAN J |last2=Marshall |first2=Mark R |last3=Pilmore |first3=Helen |last4=Manley |first4=Paul |last5=Williams |first5=Laurie |last6=Thein |first6=HLA |last7=Voss |first7=David |journal=Nephrology |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=381–5 |pmid=17014549}}</ref> It was reported on case of hyperprolactinaemia as an adverse effect of PPI.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20726208 |year=2010 |last1=Jabbar |first1=A |last2=Khan |first2=R |last3=Farrukh |first3=SN |title=Hyperprolactinaemia induced by proton pump inhibitor |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=689–90 |journal=JPMA |url=http://jpma.org.pk/full_article_text.php?article_id=2236}}</ref>

On 8 February 2012, the US-FDA issued a safety announcement on PPIs, based on the review report from the Adverse Event Reporting System. This review report suggested an increased risk of ''Clostridium difficile''-associated diarrhea with PPI use.<ref>"http://www.medical-reference.net/2012/02/breaking-news-fda-issues-warning-on.html" FDA Issued Warning on Several Proton Pump Inhibitors</ref> The safety announcement reported that PPIs have been shown to raise risk of ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' infection by 1.7 times with once-daily use and 2.4 times with more-than-once-daily use.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2010.89 |title=Iatrogenic Gastric Acid Suppression and the Risk of Nosocomial Clostridium difficile Infection |year=2010 |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=170 |issue=9 |pages=784–90 |pmid=20458086 |last1=Howell |first1=Michael D. |last2=Novack |first2=Victor |last3=Grgurich |first3=Philip |last4=Soulliard |first4=Diane |last5=Novack |first5=Lena |last6=Pencina |first6=Michael |last7=Talmor |first7=Daniel}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2011.09.030 |title=Association Between Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy and Clostridium difficile Infection in a Meta-Analysis |year=2012 |last1=Deshpande |first1=Abhishek |last2=Pant |first2=Chaitanya |last3=Pasupuleti |first3=Vinay |last4=Rolston |first4=David D.K. |last5=Jain |first5=Anil |last6=Deshpande |first6=Narayan |last7=Thota |first7=Priyaleela |last8=Sferra |first8=Thomas J. |last9=Hernandez |first9=Adrian V. |journal=Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=225–33 |pmid=22019794}}</ref> The risk can be minimized by judicious short-term prescriptions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gut Reactions |work=Medical Observer |url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/gut-reactions}}</ref>

===Long-term===
In the specific but common case of the use of PPIs as long-term treatment for managing GERD, medical societies recommend that patients use the minimal effective dosage to achieve the goals of the therapy.<ref name="AGAfive"/><ref name="refluxstate"/><ref name="CRgastrodrug">{{cite web |publisher=American Gastroenterological Association |month=April |year=2012 |title=Treating heartburn and GERD: Use Nexium, Prilosec, and related drugs carefully |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/treating-heartburn-and-gerd/}}</ref>

Long-term use of PPIs has been less studied than short-term use.  A 2006 study of 135,000 people 50 or older found that those taking high doses of PPIs for longer than one year were 2.6 times more likely to break a hip.  Those taking smaller doses for 1 to 4 yr were 1.2 to 1.6 times more likely to break a hip, and the risk of a fracture increased with the length of time taking PPIs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.296.24.2947 |title=Long-term Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy and Risk of Hip Fracture |year=2006 |last1=Yang |first1=Yu-Xiao |last2=Lewis |first2=James D. |last3=Epstein |first3=Solomon |last4=Metz |first4=David C. |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=24 |pages=2947–53 |pmid=17190895}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Table of epidemiological studies evaluating fracture risk with proton pump inhibitors</ref>
Theories as to the cause of the increase are the possibility that the reduction of stomach acid reduces the amount of calcium dissolved in the stomach or that PPIs may interfere with the breakdown and rebuilding of bone by interfering with the acid production of [[osteoclast]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/scin.2007.5591710102 |title=Bad to the bone: Acid stoppers appear to have a downside |year=2009 |last1=Seppa |first1=Nathan |journal=Science News |volume=171 |pages=3}}</ref> The reduction of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> may also increase bone fragility by raising [[homocysteine]]). A recent study also suggested PPIs significantly decreased the effect of [[clopidogrel]] on platelets, as tested by VASP phosphorylation. The clinical impact of these results must be assessed by further investigations, but a PPI treatment should not be added to the antiplatelet dual therapy without formal indication.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.06.064 |title=Influence of Omeprazole on the Antiplatelet Action of Clopidogrel Associated with Aspirin |year=2008 |last1=Gilard |first1=Martine |last2=Arnaud |first2=Bertrand |last3=Cornily |first3=Jean-Christophe |last4=Le Gal |first4=Grégoire |last5=Lacut |first5=Karine |last6=Le Calvez |first6=Geneviève |last7=Mansourati |first7=Jacques |last8=Mottier |first8=Dominique |last9=Abgrall |first9=Jean-François |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=256–60 |pmid=18206732}}</ref>

PPIs may cause dependency by increasing gastric symptoms if they are discontinued.<ref>[http://www.gastro.org/news/articles/2009/07/01/acid-reducing-medicines-may-lead-to-dependency "Acid-Reducing Medicines May Lead to Dependency"] July 1, 2009</ref> In healthy volunteers who were given pantoprazole or placebo for four weeks and then followed for six additional weeks, one week after treatment was stopped, 44% of the pantoprazole recipients reported symptoms of dyspepsia, compared to 9% of the placebo recipients.  By the third week, this difference between the two groups had disappeared.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ajg.2010.81 |title=Dyspeptic Symptom Development After Discontinuation of a Proton Pump Inhibitor: A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial |year=2010 |last1=Niklasson |first1=Anna |last2=Lindström |first2=Lina |last3=Simrén |first3=Magnus |last4=Lindberg |first4=Greger |last5=Björnsson |first5=Einar |journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=105 |issue=7 |pages=1531–7 |pmid=20332770}}</ref>  Such "rebound hyperacidity" is thought to be mediated by gastrin hormone secretion which occurred following the discontinuation of PPIs, and patients should expect symptoms of hyperacidity to worsen for a week or two after stopping these drugs. 

The FDA is revising both the prescription and the over-the-counter (OTC) labels for PPIs to include the possible increased risk of fractures. This new information is based upon FDA review of several long-term studies that reported an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine with PPI use.  Some studies found a greater risk for these fractures from higher doses of PPI or use for one year or more.  Most studies evaluated individuals aged 50 or older and the increased risk of fractures was primarily in this group.

However, 12 week PPI therapy had no impact on calcium, vitamin D, or bone metabolism in healthy young males.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2012.09.011 |title=Proton Pump inhibitors have no measurable effect on calcium and bone metabolism in healthy young males: A prospective matched controlled Study |year=2012 |last1=Sharara |first1=Ala I. |last2=El-Halabi |first2=Mustapha M. |last3=Ghaith |first3=Ola A. |last4=Habib |first4=Robert H. |last5=Mansour |first5=Nabil M. |last6=Malli |first6=Ahmad |last7=El Hajj-Fuleihan |first7=Ghada |journal=Metabolism |pmid=23102518}}</ref>

Long term PPI therapy also interferes with zinc absorption and zinc body stores. None of the PPI users however were found to be classically zinc-deficient.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4021/gr379w |title=Proton Pump Inhibitors Interfere with Zinc Absorption and Zinc Body Stores |year=2011 |last1=Farrell |journal=Gastroenterology Research}}</ref>

A December 2010 report suggested a nearly four-fold increase in certain heart arrhythmias (focal [[atrial tachycardia]] and right ventricular outflow tract, [[RVOT tachycardia]]) in PPI users.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marcus |first=GM |title=Proton Pump Inhibitors are Associated with Focal Arrhythmias |journal=The Journal of Innovations in Cardiac Rhythm Management |year=2010 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=85–89 |url=http://www.innovationsincrm.com/cardiac-rhythm-management/2010/december/29-proton-pump-inhibitors-focal-arrhythmias}}</ref> The potential mechanism was hypothesized to be related to changes in pH, potassium, and calcium level in selected cardiac cells. Though this has not been confirmed by additional study yet, it is suggested that patients with these focal arrhythmias who are taking PPIs should bring this to the attention of their physician.

In March 2011, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] notified healthcare professionals and the public that PPI drugs may cause low serum [[magnesium]] levels ([[hypomagnesemia]]) if taken for prolonged periods of time - in most cases, longer than one year.<ref>http://www.drugs.com/fda/proton-pump-inhibitor-ppis-safety-communication-low-magnesium-levels-can-associated-long-term-12913.html{{full|date=March 2013}}</ref> Most patients on long-term PPIs will not develop symptomatic hypomagnesemia unless accompanied by precipitating factors such as gastroenteritis, diuretics, and chronic comorbidities.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e32833ff5d6 |title=Proton pump inhibitors and severe hypomagnesaemia |year=2011 |last1=Cundy |first1=Tim |last2=MacKay |first2=Jonathan |journal=Current Opinion in Gastroenterology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=180–5 |pmid=20856115}}</ref>

Another potential adverse event of PPI administration is chronic [[interstitial nephritis]] leading to [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[end-stage renal disease]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Proton pump inhibitors mechanism.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The activation of PPIs]]
[[File:G cell hyperplasia - very high mag.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Micrograph]] of the [[gastric antrum]] showing [[G cell]] [[hyperplasia]], a histomorphologic change seen with PPI use ([[H&E stain]])]]
[[Proton pump]] inhibitors act by irreversibly blocking the [[hydrogen]]/[[potassium]] [[ATPase|adenosine triphosphatase]] [[enzyme]] system (the [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase]], or more commonly, the gastric proton pump) of the gastric [[parietal cells]].<ref name="Overview"/> The proton pump is the terminal stage in gastric acid secretion, being directly responsible for secreting H<sup>+</sup> ions into the gastric lumen, making it an ideal target for inhibiting acid secretion.  

Targeting the terminal step in acid production, as well as the irreversible nature of the inhibition, results in a class of drugs that are significantly more effective than [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> antagonists]] and reduce gastric acid secretion by up to 99%. ("Irreversibility" refers to the effect on a single copy of the enzyme; the effect on the overall human digestive system is reversible, as the enzymes are naturally destroyed and replaced with new copies.)

The lack of the acid in the stomach will aid in the healing of [[duodenum|duodenal]] ulcers, and reduces the pain from indigestion and [[heartburn]], which can be exacerbated by stomach acid. The lack of stomach acid, also called [[hypochlorhydria]], is the lack of sufficient [[hydrochloric acid]], HCl, which is required for the digestion of proteins and the absorption of nutrients, particularly of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and of calcium.

The PPIs are given in an inactive form, which is neutrally charged ([[lipophilic]]) and readily crosses [[cell membrane]]s into intracellular compartments (like the parietal cell canaliculus) with acidic environments.  In an acid environment, the inactive drug is protonated and rearranges into its active form.  As described above, the active form will [[covalent]]ly and irreversibly bind to the gastric proton pump, deactivating it.

===Potassium-competitive acid blockers===
Potassium-competitive inhibitors are experimental drugs that reversibly block the potassium-binding site of the proton pump. Soraprazan and revaprazan block H<sup>+</sup> secretion much more quickly than classical PPIs (within a half-hour).<ref>Schubert-Zsilavecz, M, Wurglics, M: ''Neue Arzneimittel 2005. Soraprazan'' (in German).{{page needed|date=March 2013}}</ref> The development of soraprazan, however, has been discontinued in 2007.<ref>[http://www.nycomed.com/nycomed/helpers/resourceimage.aspx?guid=2EBCA5F1-052F-4B2F-B880-09084274AF17 Nycomed Annual Report 2007]</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
The rate of omeprazole absorption is decreased by concomitant food intake. In addition, the absorption of lansoprazole and esomeprazole is decreased and delayed by food. These [[pharmacokinetic]] effects, however, reportedly have no significant impact on efficacy.<ref>AstraZeneca Pty Ltd. Nexium (Australian approved prescribing information). North Ryde: AstraZeneca; 2005.</ref><ref>Wyeth Australia Pty Ltd. Zoton (Australian approved prescribing information). Baulkham Hills: Wyeth; 2004.</ref>

The [[elimination half-life]] of PPIs ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 hr, but the effect of a single dose on acid secretion usually persists up to three days. This is because of accumulation of the drug in [[parietal cell]] [[Canaliculus (parietal cell)|canaliculi]] and the irreversible nature of proton pump inhibition.
