The '''Lisfranc injury''' (also known as the '''Lisfranc [[Bone fracture|fracture]]''', '''Lisfranc [[Joint dislocation|dislocation]]''', '''Lisfranc fracture dislocation''', '''tarsometatarsal injury''', or simply '''midfoot injury''') is an [[Trauma (medicine)|injury]] of the [[foot]] in which one, or all, of the [[Metatarsus|metatarsal bones]] are [[Displacement (orthopedic surgery)|displaced]] from the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]].<ref name=WhoNamedIt3053>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3053|Lisfranc's fracture}}</ref><ref name=thefreedictionary>{{cite web|author=|title=Lisfranc's fracture|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=|location=|year=|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Lisfranc%27s+fracture|accessdate=}}</ref> This type of injury is named after [[Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin]] (2 April 1790{{ndash}}13 May 1847), a [[French people|French]] [[surgeon]] and [[Gynaecology|gynecologist]] who first described the injury in 1815, after the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].<ref name=Lisfranc1815>{{cite book|last=Lisfranc|first=J|authorlink=Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin|title=Nouvelle méthode opératoire pour l'amputation partielle du pied dans son articulation tarso-métatarsienne: méthode précédée des nombreuses modifications qu'a subies celle de Chopart|pages=1–52|publisher=L’imprimerie de Feuguery|location=Paris|year=1815|language=French|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Hw1bAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22m%C3%A9thode+pr%C3%A9c%C3%A9d%C3%A9e+des+nombreuses+modifications+qu'a+subies+celle+de+Chopart%22#v=onepage&q=%22m%C3%A9thode%20pr%C3%A9c%C3%A9d%C3%A9e%20des%20nombreuses%20modifications%20qu'a%20subies%20celle%20de%20Chopart%22&f=false}}</ref>

==Causes==
In humans, the [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|midfoot]] consists of five bones that form the [[arches of the foot]] (the [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], [[Navicular bone|navicular]], and three [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiform]] bones) and their articulations with the bases of the five metatarsal bones. Lisfranc injuries are caused when excessive [[kinetic energy]] is applied either directly or indirectly to the midfoot and are often seen in the setting of [[traffic collision]]s or [[Occupational injury|industrial accidents]].<ref name=Smith2005>{{cite journal|author=Smith BR, Begeman PC, Leland R, Meehan R, Levine RS, Yang KH, King AI|title=A Mechanism of Injury to the Forefoot in Car Crashes|journal=Traffic Injury Prevention|volume=6|issue=2|pages=156–69|year=2005|issn=1538-9588|doi=10.1080/15389580590931635|pmid=16019401|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389580590931635#preview}}</ref>

Direct Lisfranc injuries are usually caused by a crush injury, such as a heavy object falling onto the midfoot, or the foot being run over by a car or truck, or someone landing on the foot after a fall from a significant height.<ref name=Chan2001>{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=SCF|last2=Chow|first2=SP|title=Current concept review on Lisfranc injuries|journal=Hong Kong Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery|volume=5|issue=1|pages=75–80|year=2001|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=http://hkoa.org/hkjos/2001-1/75_80.pdf}}</ref> Indirect Lisfranc injuries are caused by a sudden [[Torque|rotational force]] on a [[Plantarflexion|plantar flexed]] (downward pointing) forefoot.<ref name=Smith2005/> Examples of this type of trauma include a [[Equestrianism|rider]] falling from a horse but the foot remaining trapped in the [[stirrup]], or a person falling forward after stepping into a [[storm drain]].<ref name=Chan2001/>

In the setting of athletic trauma, Lisfranc injuries occur commonly in activities such as [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]], [[wakeboarding]], or [[snowboarding]] (where appliance [[Snowboard#Bindings|bindings]] pass directly over the metatarsals). [[American football]] players occasionally acquire this injury, such as Barrett Jones, [[Matt Schaub]], [[Darren McFadden]], [[Santonio Holmes]], [[Ryan Kalil]], [[DeMarco Murray]], [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] and [[Cedric Benson]], and most often occurs when the athlete's foot is plantar flexed and another player lands on the heel.

==Diagnosis==
In a high energy injury to the midfoot, such as a fall from a height or a motor vehicle accident, the diagnosis of a Lisfranc injury should, in theory at least, pose less of a challenge. There will be deformity of the midfoot and X-ray abnormalities should be obvious.  Further, the nature of the injury will create heightened clinical suspicion and there may even be disruption of the overlying skin and compromise of the blood supply.  Typical X-ray findings would include a gap between the base of the first and second toes.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Intercuneiform instability and the "gap" sign | author=Davies MS, Saxby TS | date=1999 Sep | journal=Foot Ankle Int | volume=20(9) | pages=606–9 | pmid=10509690 }}</ref> The diagnosis becomes more challenging in the case of low energy incidents, such as might occur with a twisting injury on the racquetball court, or when a football lineman is forced back upon a foot that is already in a fully [[Plantarflexion|plantar flexed]] position.  Then, there may only be complaint of inability to bear weight and some mild swelling of the forefoot or midfoot.  Bruising of the arch has been described as diagnostic in these circumstances but may well be absent.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Plantar ecchymosis sign: a clinical aid to diagnosis of occult Lisfranc tarsometatarsal injuries | author=Ross G, Cronin R, Hauzenblas J, Juliano P | year=1986 | journal=J Orthop Trauma | volume=10(2) | pages=119–122 | pmid=8932671 }}</ref>   Typically, conventional radiography of the foot is utilized with standard non-weight bearing views, supplemented by weight bearing views which may demonstrate widening of the interval between the first and second toes, if the initial views fail to show abnormality.  Unfortunately, radiographs in such circumstances have a sensitivity of 50% when non-weight bearing and 85% when weight bearing, meaning that they will appear normal in 15% of cases where a Lisfranc injury actually exists.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The diagnostic accuracy of radiographs in Lisfranc injury and the potential value of a craniocaudal projection | author=Rankine JJ, Nicholas CM, Wells G, Barron DA | date=2012 Apr | journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol | volume=198(4) | pages=W365-9 | pmid=22451574 }}</ref> In the case of apparently normal x-rays, if clinical suspicion remains high, some form of advanced imaging such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) or [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT) is a logical next step.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Imaging of Lisfranc Injury and Midfoot Sprain | author=Hatem SF | date=2008 Nov | journal=Radiologic Clinics of North America | volume=46(6) | pages=1045–1060 | pmid=19038612 }}</ref>

==Classification==
There are three classifications for the fracture:<ref name=Wheeless>{{cite web|author=Wheeless CR|title=Lisfranc's Fracture / TarsoMetatarsal Injuries|work=Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics online|publisher=Duke Orthopaedics|location=Durham, North Carolina|year=2011|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/lisfrancs_fracture_tarsometatarsal_injuries|accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>
# Homolateral: All five metatarsals are displaced in the same direction.  Lateral displacement may also suggest [[Cuboid bone|cuboidal]] fracture.
# Isolated: one or two metatarsals are displaced from the others.
# Divergent: metatarsals are displaced in a [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] or [[Coronal plane|coronal]] plane and may also involve the [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|intercuneiform]] area and include a [[Navicular bone|navicular]] fracture.

==Treatment==
Treatment options include operative or non-operative treatment.  If the dislocation is less than 2&nbsp;mm, the fracture can be managed with casting for six&nbsp;weeks.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Practical management of Lisfranc injury in athletes | author=Lattermann C, Goldstein JL, Wukich DK, Lee S, Bach BR Jr | date=2007 Jul | journal=Clin J Sport Med | volume=17(4) | pages=311–51 | pmid=17620787 }}</ref> The patient's injured limb cannot [[Weight-bearing|bear weight]] during this period.  For severe Lisfranc injuries, [[Internal_fixation#Open_Reduction_Internal_Fixation_.28ORIF.29|open reduction with internal fixation]] (ORIF) and temporary screw or [[Kirschner wire]] (K-wire) fixation is the treatment of choice.<ref name=Mulier1997>{{cite journal|last=Mulier|first=T|last2=Reynders|first2=P|last3=Sioen|first3=W|last4=Van Den Bergh|first4=J|last5=De Reymaeker|first5=G|last6=Reynaert|first6=P|last7=Broos|first7=P|title=The Treatment of Lisfranc Injuries|journal=Acta Orthopaedica Belgica|volume=63|issue=2|pages=82–90|year=1997|pmid=9265792|pmc=|issn=0001-6462|doi=|url=http://actaorthopaedicabelgica.be/acta/download/1997-2/9265792.pdf}}</ref> The foot cannot be allowed to bear weight for a minimum of six weeks.  Partial weight-bearing may then begin, with full weight bearing after an additional several weeks, depending on the specific injury.  K-wires are typically removed after six weeks, before weight bearing, while screws are often removed after 12 weeks.<ref name=Mulier1997/>

When a Lisfranc injury is characterized by significant displacement of the tarsometatarsal joint(s), nonoperative treatment often leads to severe loss of function and long-term disability secondary to [[chronic pain]] and sometimes to a [[Valgus deformity|planovalgus deformity]].  In cases with severe pain, loss of function, or progressive deformity that has failed to respond to nonoperative treatment, mid-tarsal and tarsometatarsal [[arthrodesis]] (operative fusion of the bones) may be indicated.<ref name=Mann1996>{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=RA|last2=Prieskorn|first2=D|last3=Sobel|first3=M|title=Mid-tarsal and tarsometatarsal arthrodesis for primary degenerative osteoarthrosis or osteoarthrosis after trauma|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume|volume=78|issue=9|pages=1376–85|year=1996|pmid=8816654|pmc=|doi=|url=http://jbjs.org/pdfaccess.ashx?ResourceID=54750&PDFSource=0}}</ref>

==History==
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin]] encountered a soldier who suffered from vascular compromise and secondary [[gangrene]] of the foot after a fall from a horse.<ref name=Lisfranc1815/> Subsequently, Lisfranc performed an [[amputation]] at the level of the [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|tarsometatarsal joints]],<ref name=Lisfranc1815/> and that area of the foot has since been [[eponym]]ously referred to as the "Lisfranc joint".<ref name=WhoNamedIt3055>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3055|Lisfranc's joint}}</ref> Although Lisfranc did not describe a specific mechanism of injury or classification scheme, a Lisfranc injury has come to mean a dislocation or fracture-dislocation injury at the tarsometatarsal joints.<ref name=DiDomenico2012>{{cite journal|last=DiDomenico|first=LA|last2=Cross|first2=D|title=Tarsometatarsal/Lisfranc Joint|journal=Clinics in Podiatric Medicine and Surgery|volume=29|issue=2|pages=221–42|year=2012|pmid=22424486|pmc=|doi=10.1016/j.cpm.2012.01.003|url=http://www.ankleandfootcare.com/pdf/tarsometatarsal-lisfranc-joint-article.pdf}}</ref>
