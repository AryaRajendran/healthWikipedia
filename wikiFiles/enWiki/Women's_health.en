'''Women's health''' refers to health issues specific to [[human female anatomy]]. These often relate to structures such as [[human female genitalia|female genitalia]] and [[breasts]] or to conditions caused by hormones specific to, or most notable in, females. Women's health issues include [[menstruation]], [[contraception]], [[maternal health]], [[child birth]], [[menopause]] and [[breast cancer]]. They can also include medical situations in which women face problems not directly related to their biology, for example gender-differentiated access to medical treatment.

Women's health is an issue which has been taken up by many [[feminists]], especially where [[reproductive health]] is concerned. Women's health is positioned within a wider body of knowledge cited by, amongst others, the [[World Health Organisation]], which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health.<ref>http://www.who.int/social_determinants</ref>

Some health and medical research advocates, particularly the [[Society for Women's Health Research]] in the United States, define women's health more broadly than issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences between women and men exist. Research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. The social view of health combined with the acknowledgement that gender is a social determinant of health inform women's health service delivery in countries around the world. Women's health services such as [http://www.lwchc.org.au Leichhardt Women's Community Health Centre] which was established in 1974 and was the first women's health centre established in Australia is an example of women's health approach to service delivery.<ref>Stevens, J (1995). ''Healing Women: A History of Leichhardt Women's Community Health Centre''.</ref>

==Issues in reproductive health==
One example of this is the [[Cartwright Inquiry]] in [[New Zealand]], in which research by two feminist journalists revealed that women with [[cervix|cervical]] abnormalities were not receiving treatment, as part of an experiment. The women were not told of the abnormalities and several later died. In many countries feminists have campaigned for the right to legal and safe [[abortion]], arguing that it is a health rather than a moral issue. In countries where [[contraception]] is difficult to access, campaigns for readily available contraception are conducted on the same lines. Conversely, there have also been campaigns against potentially dangerous forms of contraception such as defective [[IUD]]s.

Even in affluent countries like the United States, women’s reproductive health is neglected. For example, in Arizona, conservative members of the state legislature have in the recent decade continuously introduced bills that restrict information about and access to reproductive health. These measures are much to the discontent of many citizens, but Arizona is a majority conservative state. The prominent bills restricting sexual education, contraception, and abortion include:

==Other medical issues==
;Bone Health
Taking proton pump inhibitors (like Prevacid, Nexium, or Prilosec), drugs that decrease stomach acid, are a risk for bone fractures if taken for two or more years. This happens because of a decreased absorption of calcium in the stomach.<ref>Etingin, Orli R. [http://0-find.galegroup.com.unistar.uni.edu/gtx/start.do?prodId=AONE "New findings on fracture risk"].
