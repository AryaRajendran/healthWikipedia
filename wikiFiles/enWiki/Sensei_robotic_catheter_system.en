The '''Sensei X robotic catheter''' is a medical [[robot]] designed to enhance a physician’s ability to perform complex [[surgery|operations]] using a small flexible tube called a [[catheter]]. As open surgical procedures that require large incisions have given way to minimally invasive surgeries in which the surgeon gains access to the target organs through small incisions using specialized surgical tools.  One important tool used in many of these procedures is a catheter used to deliver many of things a surgeon needs to do his work, to impact target tissue and deliver a variety of medicines or disinfecting agents to treat disease or infection.  

Manufactured by [[Hansen Medical]], Sensei X is a specialized robotic catheter system that is controlled by a physician and is designed for accurate positioning, manipulation and stable control of catheter and catheter-based technologies during [[Cardiac surgery|cardiovascular procedures]]. The Sensei system obtained U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) clearance in 2007, after which the [[Cleveland Clinic]]'s [[electrophysiology]] program, then directed by Dr. Andrea Natale, received the first placement. The '''Sensei Robotic Catheter System''' and Artisan Control Catheter allow physicians to navigate flexible catheters with greater stability and control during complex [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|cardiac arrhythmia]] procedures. Hansen Medical has related co-development agreements with the following industry leaders: [[St. Jude Medical]], [[GE Healthcare]], [[Siemens Healthcare]], and [[Philips]] Medical Systems.

Hansen Medical was founded by Dr. Frederic Moll, who had also co-founded Intuitive Surgical, manufacturer of the Da Vinci Surgical System, whose use has propelled medicinal robotics to the forefront of patient care. The Sensei system is indicated for use during the cardiac mapping phase of cardiac arrhythmia treatment in the US. Meanwhile, it has CE mark approval for facilitating the navigation of ablation catheters within the atria of the heart during complex arrhythmia procedures such as Atrial Fibrillation (AF).

In November 2010, Hansen Medical received unconditional Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval from the FDA initiating  a clinical trial to investigate the use of the Sensei X Robotic Catheter System and the Artisan Control Catheter for treatment of AF, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The Principal Investigator of the ARTISAN AF Trial is Dr. Andrea Natale, executive medical director for Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute (TCAI). The first case in the trial was completed by Dr. Joseph Gallinghouse, an electrophysiologist, at the TCAI at St. David's Medical Center.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01122173| title = Use of the Hansen Medical System in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation| publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]]|date = 2010-12-17| accessdate = 2011-03-21}}</ref>

By the end of 2010, nearly 100&nbsp;Sensei systems have been shipped worldwide since its 2007 release. The system has been used to perform almost 5,000&nbsp;procedures.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Hansen Medical Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Results| url = http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=202676&p=irol-newsArticle_print&ID=1532078| publisher = Hansen Medical| date = 2011-02-23| accessdate = 2011-03-21}}</ref> The Sensei system operates by guiding standard catheters through a manipulated robotically steerable sheath (hollow tube) in the patient's vasculature. The doctor performs the procedure at a control station with a technology called "IntelliSense" to proximally measure the forces applied along the shaft of the catheter as a result of catheter tissue contact. The Artisan catheter has two robotically controlled segments which provides six degrees of freedom and 270&nbsp;degrees of bend articulation which can assist physicians in accessing  hard-to-reach cardiac anatomy. The open lumen Artisan catheter accommodates 8F percutaneous EP catheters. Centers have reported acute and long term success rates consistent with manual procedures.<ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology]]| title = Robotic Naviation in Catheter Ablation for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Midterm Efficacy and Predictors of Postablation Arrhythmia Recurrences| date = 2010-11-23| issn = 1540-8167| oclc = 50157846| publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]| author = Hlivak P, Mlcochova H, Peichl P, Cihak R, Wichterle D, Kautzner J}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology| title = Persistence of Pulmonary Vein Isolation After Robotic Remote-Navigated Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation and its Relation to Clinical Outcome| author = Willems S, Steve D, Servatius H, Hoffman B, Drewitz I, Llerleile K, Ali Aydin M, Wegscheider K, Salukhe T, Meinertz T, Rostock T| pages = 1–6| month = June| year = 2010| issn = 1540-8167| oclc = 50157846| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Heart Rhythm]]| publisher = [[Elsevier]]| author = Duncan E, Liew R, Goromonzi F, Richmond L, Baker V, Thomas G, Tayebjee M, Finlay M, Abrams D, Dhinoja M, Earley M, Sporton S, Schilling R| title = A Randomized Controlled Trial of Catheter Ablation of AF Comparing Manual and Robotic Navigation| year = 2010| volume = 7| issue = 5| page = 339| issn = 1556-3871| oclc = 55803866}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology| title = Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation Utilizing Robotic Catheter Navigation in Comparison to Manual Navigation and Ablation: Single-Center Experience| issn = 1540-8167| oclc = 50157846| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| author = Di Biase L, Wang Y, Horton R, Gallinghouse J, Mohanty P, Sanchez J, Patel D, Dare M, Canby R, Price L, Zagrodzky J, Bailey S, Burkhardt D, Natale A| month = July| year = | pages = 1–8}}</ref>

==The Sensei Robotic System in clinical use==

Although the Sensei system was initially tested in a range of ablation procedures including SVT and typical atrial flutter,<ref>Kanagaratnam P, Koa-Wing M, Wallace DT, Goldenberg AS, Peters NS, Davies DW. Experience of robotic catheter ablation in humans using a novel remotely steerable catheter sheath. J Interv Card Electrophysiol 2008;21:19-26.</ref><ref>Steven D, Rostock T, Servatius H et al. Robotic versus conventional ablation for common-type atrial flutter: a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of remote catheter navigation. Heart Rhythm 2008;5:1556-1560.</ref> there is most excitement about it’s role in complex ablation procedures  such as for atrial fibrillation (AF), where the ability to manipulate catheters to precise locations within the heart and keep them stable in the desired position is crucial. Achieving adequate tissue contact, ideally with a small amount of pressure being applied by the catheter during ablation, is also essential to effectively destroy the heart tissue responsible for arrhythmia. The ability to titrate catheter contact force using the Sensei system’s built-in pressure sensor technology (called intellisense) may allow operators to maximise the chance of creating effective burns across the thickness of the atrial wall, whilst minimising the risk of complication.<ref>Di Biase L, Natale A, Barrett C et al. Relationship between catheter forces, lesion characteristics, "popping," and char formation: experience with robotic navigation system. J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 2009;20:436-440.</ref> Intracardiac echocardiography has also demonstrated that greater catheter stability is achieved with robotic compared to manual catheter delivery.<ref>Kautzner J, Peichl P, Cihak R, Wichterle D, Mlcochova H. Early experience with robotic navigation for catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Pacing Clin Electrophysiol 2009;32 Suppl 1:S163-S166.</ref> Consequently, there is evidence that robotic ablation causes more effective and more efficient burns.<ref>Koa-Wing M, Kojodjojo P, Malcolme-Lawes LC et al. Robotically assisted ablation produces more rapid and greater signal attenuation than manual ablation. J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 2009;20:1398-1404.</ref> 

Use of robotic navigation for [[catheter ablation]] was also designed to allow [[Electrophysiologists|Electrophysiology]] to perform most of the procedure without being exposed to X-rays (or radiation). The radiation dose to the operator during a conventional manual ablation procedure is relatively small, although there is cumulative exposure that becomes an important consideration for operators performing procedures on a daily basis. By performing procedures a few metres away using a robotic system and seated in the leaded anteroom, the operator is shielded from X-rays and is less vulnerable to operator fatigue, which may affect operator performance in long complex cases. Use of robotic navigation has been shown to reduce fluoroscopy times in [[catheter ablation]] of AF, resulting in reduced X-ray exposure for patients and other health care professionals present in the catheter laboratory.<ref>Steven D, Rostock T, Servatius H et al.

J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 2009.</ref>

==Early Experience with the Sensei Robotic System==
The system has been the subject of several [[clinical trials]] in the USA and Europe, particularly for the catheter ablation of AF. There were early safety concerns after the ‘first-in-human’ studies suggested high complication rates. Wazni et al. reported experience with the first 71 catheter ablations for AF in their centre using the Hansen robotic navigation system starting from 2005.<ref>Wazni OM, Barrett C, Martin DO et al. Experience with the Hansen Robotic System for Atrial Fibrillation Ablation-Lessons Learned and Techniques Modified: Hansen in the Real World. J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 2009.</ref>

These early studies have allowed others to incorporate changes to their technique,<ref>Wazni OM, Barrett C, Martin DO et al. Experience with the Hansen Robotic System for Atrial Fibrillation Ablation-Lessons Learned and Techniques Modified: Hansen in the Real World. J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 2009.</ref> and hence recent work has produced complication rates for catheter ablation of AF comparable to procedures performed manually.<ref>Di BL, Wang Y, Horton R et al. Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation Utilizing Robotic Catheter Navigation in Comparison to Manual Navigation and Ablation: Single-Center Experience. J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 2009.</ref><ref>Steven D, Servatius H, Rostock T et al. Reduced Fluoroscopy During Atrial Fibrillation Ablation: Benefits of Robotic Guided Navigation. J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 2009.</ref><ref>Willems S, Steven D, Servatius H et al. Persistence of Pulmonary Vein Isolation After Robotic Remote-Navigated Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation and its Relation to Clinical Outcome. J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 2010.</ref> The field of robotic ablation is growing and evolving rapidly, and randomised controlled trials comparing robotic to manual ablation are ongoing in Europe and the USA to see if these potential advantages will translate into better clinical outcomes.

==Recent studies using the Sensei Robotic system==
Since there are no completed randomised controlled trials comparing robotic ablation to manual ablation, comparing the modalities remains difficult. Techniques, complication rates and clinical results vary widely between centres for both manual and robotic procedures, making registry data difficult to compare. Typical ranges for procedures performed manually are: major complication rates of 3-5%, and success rates of approximately 80-90% for paroxysmal AF and 70-75% for persistent AF (depending on the length of follow-up).<ref>Bhargava M, Di Biase L, Mohanty P et al.
