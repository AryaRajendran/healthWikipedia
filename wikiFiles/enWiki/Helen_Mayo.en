'''Helen Mary Mayo''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1 October 1878 - 13 November 1967) was an Australian medical doctor and medical educator, born and raised in [[Adelaide]]. In 1896, she enrolled at the [[University of Adelaide]], where she studied medicine.  After graduating, Mayo spent two years working in infant health in England, Ireland and India.  She returned to Adelaide in 1906, starting a private practice and taking up positions at the [[Adelaide Children's Hospital]] and [[Royal Adelaide Hospital|Adelaide Hospital]].  In 1909, she co-founded the School for Mothers, where mothers could receive advice on infant health.  This organisation, which became the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association in 1927, eventually established branches across [[South Australia]] and incorporated a training school for maternal nurses.  In 1914, after unsuccessfully campaigning for the Children's Hospital to treat infants, Mayo co-founded the Mareeba Hospital for infants.

In addition to her medical achievements, Mayo participated in a number of other organisations.  She was heavily involved in the University of Adelaide, serving on the university council from 1914 to 1960 (the first woman in Australia to be elected to such a position) and establishing a women's club and boarding college there.  She was also the founder of the Adelaide [[Lyceum Club (Australia)|Lyceum Club]], an organisation for professional women.  Mayo died on 13 November 1967, with the ''[[Medical Journal of Australia]]'' attributing the success of South Australia's infant welfare system to her efforts.

== Early life and education ==

Helen Mary Mayo was born in [[Adelaide, Australia]] on 1 October 1878.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton">Covernton 1968.</ref>  She was the eldest of the seven children of George Gibbes Mayo, a civil engineer, and Henrietta Mary Mayo, n√©e Donaldson.<ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography - Helen Mayo">Hicks, 1986, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography''.</ref>  Her formal education commenced at the age of 10, when she began receiving regular lessons with a tutor.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />  At the age of 16, she was enrolled in the Advanced School for Girls on [[Grote Street]] (the forerunner of the [[Adelaide High School]]), from which she [[matriculate]]d after one year, at the end of 1895.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />

Despite never having heard of female doctors, from an early age Mayo had been set on pursuing a career in medicine.<ref name="Mackinnon, p. 61.">Mackinnon 1986, p. 61.</ref>  However, [[Edward Rennie]], then a professor at the [[University of Adelaide]] advised Helen's father that she was too young to commence study in Medicine, so in 1896, Mayo enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Adelaide.<ref name="Mackinnon, p. 61."/>  The death of her younger sister Olive at the end of her first year of study meant that Mayo was unable to sit her final exams for that year, and when she repeated her first year in 1897, she failed two of her five subjects (Latin and Greek).<ref name="Mackinnon, p. 61." />  Having gained her father's permission, Mayo enrolled in medicine in 1898.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" /><ref name="Mackinnon, p. 61." /> She was a distinguished medicine student, coming top of her class and winning the Davis Thomas scholarship and the Everard Scholarship<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" /> in her fourth and fifth years of study, respectively.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />

== Medical career ==

Upon her graduation in at the end of 1902, Mayo took up a position as a resident medical officer at the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital|Adelaide Hospital]].<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />  In February 1904, she left for England to gain practical experience.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" /><ref name="Mackinnon, p. 63.">Mackinnon 1986, p. 63.</ref>  There she worked as a clinical clerk at [[Great Ormond Street|Hospital for Sick Children]] in Great Ormond Street, London.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />  To gain experience in midwifery, she went to [[Coombe Women's Hospital]] in [[Dublin]],<ref name="Mackinnon, p. 63." /> and after returning to London to complete a course in tropical medicine, she travelled to India where she worked for a year as a midwife in a [[Cambridge Mission]] hospital for women and children.<ref name="A Very Remarkable Woman">Denholm 1991.</ref>  In 1906, Mayo returned to Adelaide and started a private practice in premises owned by her father on [[Morphett Street, Adelaide|Morphett Street]], next to the family home.<ref name="Mackinnon, p. 65.">Mackinnon 1986, p. 65.</ref>  With spare time on her hands, she began laboratory work at the Adelaide Hospital and took up an appointment as honorary [[anaesthetist]] at the [[Adelaide Children's Hospital]].<ref name="Mackinnon, p. 65." />

=== The Mothers and Babies' Health Association ===

In May 1909, Mayo presented a paper to an interstate conference on the subject of infant mortality.  In it, she addressed the high infant mortality rate in South Australia,<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" /> and claimed that more needed to be done to educate women for motherhood.<ref name="Private medicine and public health">Hicks 1986, "Private medicine and public health".</ref> Later that year, after hearing a talk about the success of a school for mothers in London, she and Harriet Stirling (the daughter of [[Edward Stirling]]) founded the School for Mothers in Adelaide. The Kindergarten Union made a room in its offices available for one afternoon a week, where a nurse would weigh babies and Mayo and Stirling would give advice.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />  At the first annual meeting of the School a prominent medical doctor criticised the organisation for thinking that [[spinster]]s could teach mothers, who were guided by the "mother instinct" (both Mayo and Stirling were childless).<ref name="Private medicine and public health"/>  In spite of this, the organisation flourished,<ref name="Private medicine and public health"/> and in 1911 a cottage in [[Wright Street, Adelaide|Wright Street]] was purchased and became the headquarters of the School.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" /> In 1927, the organisation became the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association,<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" /> and by 1932, it had branches throughout South Australia.<ref name="Private medicine and public health"/>  Mayo served as the honorary medical officer of the association until her death in 1967,<ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography - Helen Mayo" /> by which time the organisation gained a training school for maternal nurses and a hospital.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />  In her honour, the Association inaugurated the annual Helen Mayo lecture. Eventually, in 1981, the Mothers and Babies' Association was incorporated into the Department of Health of the [[South Australian Government]].<ref name="A Very Remarkable Woman" />

After visiting Melbourne to learn how to make [[vaccine]]s,<ref name="Mackinnon, p. 65." /> in 1911 Mayo was appointed clinical bacteriologist at the Adelaide hospital, a position she would hold for 22 years.<ref name="A Very Remarkable Woman" />

=== The Mareeba Hospital ===
[[File:Mareeba Hospital.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A large Federation style brick building with verandas and balconies, on which a dozen women in white are standing.|The Mareeba Hospital, c 1917|left]]
In the early part of the 1910s, there was an urgent need for medical facilities to treat infants in South Australia since, due to the risks of cross-infection, the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|Adelaide Children's Hospital]] would not treat those under the age of two.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />  In 1913, Mayo and Stirling called a meeting of medical practitioners to discuss the prospect of a hospital for these children.  After doubts about the practicality of such a plan were expressed, the group raised some funds and presented to the board of the Adelaide Children's Hospital a plan to use the funds to build a separate ward on the grounds of the hospital. The board rejected the proposal, so Mayo and her group rented a two-story house in [[St Peters, South Australia|St. Peter's]] and opened a hospital for infants in 1914.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" /> Financial difficulties for the hospital eventually became overwhelming and the state government took over the hospital, moving it to [[Woodville, South Australia|Woodville]] and renaming it the Mareeba Hospital.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />

Mayo played a central role in establishing Mareeba Hospital and forming its policy, serving as honourable physician at Mareeba, and as honorary responsible officer from 1921 to 1946.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />  To combat the risks of cross-infection, she instituted a policy of strict isolation of babies from other patients.  Each child had their own locker, where their own equipment would be kept, gowns used by nurses to tend to one child would only be used for that child, and blankets, bottles and floors were all sterilised.<ref>MacKinnon, p. 66.</ref>  Mareeba eventually became a 70-bed hospital, complete with a surgical unit and a ward for premature babies.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />

=== Later medical career ===
In 1919, The Adelaide Children's Hospital advertised for honorary physicians.  Believing that her gender would prevent her being given the position, Mayo initially declined to apply.  However, upon the request of after Adelaide surgeon [[Henry Simpson Newland|Henry Newland]], Mayo applied for the post, and that year was appointed honorary Assistant Physician in charge of [[outpatient]]s.  With positions at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Children's Hospital and the Mareeba Hospital, as well as commitments at her private practice, Mayo commenced her [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree in 1925.<ref name="MacKinnon, p. 67.">MacKinnon, p. 67.</ref>  She used her experiences as a clinical bacteriologist at the Adelaide Hospital as the basis for her thesis, which she was forced to write on the weekends, such was the volume of her workload.<ref name="MacKinnon, p. 67."/>  The following year, she became the first woman to receive an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from the University of Adelaide.<ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography - Helen Mayo" /> She was subsequently appointed honorary physician to [[inpatient]]s at the Children's Hospital,<ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography - Helen Mayo" /> and a clinical lecturer at the University of Adelaide.<ref name="MacKinnon, p. 67."/> In May 1935 Mayo was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]]  (OBE) "for services in connection with maternal and child welfare in the state of South Australia."<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34166|supp=yes|startpage=3610|date=31 May 1935|accessdate=19 March 2011}}</ref>

She retired in 1938 and became an honorary consulting physician at the Children's Hospital, but when the [[Second World War]] broke out, she returned to the hospital as senior paediatric adviser, at the same time organising the Red Cross donor transfusion service.<ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography - Helen Mayo" />

Mayo became the first woman in Australia to be elected to a university council when, in 1914, she was elected to the Council of the [[University of Adelaide]], a position she held for 46 years.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" />   She founded, in 1922, the Adelaide [[Lyceum Club (Australia)|Lyceum Club]], and was its inaugural president.  The club provided a place for women who were leaders in their respective fields to meet, and aimed to "advance the status of women in the world of arts and letters".<ref name="MacKinnon, p. 69.">MacKinnon, p. 69.</ref>

Mayo was also heavily involved in the life of female students and graduates of the University of Adelaide.  She spearheaded the foundation of the Women Student's Club (eventually the Women's Union) in 1909,<ref>Finnis 1973, p 81.</ref> and in 1921 initiated efforts to unify the various student bodies at that University into what would eventually become the [[Adelaide University Union]].<ref>Finnis 1973, p 116.</ref> The construction of the Lady Simon Building for the Women's Union was due in large part to her efforts,<ref>Finnis 1973, p 128.</ref> as was the founding of [[St. Ann's College]], where she served as chairperson from 1939 to 1959.<ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography - Helen Mayo" />

Mayo died 13 November 1967, aged 89.<ref name="Australian Dictionary of Biography - Helen Mayo" /> In its obituary, the ''[[Medical Journal of Australia]]'' described her as "the [[wikt:doyen|doyen]] of medical women in South Australia (and most probably Australia)", and credited her with the efficiency of South Australia's infant health welfare system.<ref name="Obituary - Helen Mary Mayo; Covernton" /> The Federal [[Division of Mayo]] is named for her.<ref>{{cite web|title=Profile of the electoral division of Mayo (SA)|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/sa/mayo.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>
