The '''peripheral nervous system''' ('''PNS''', or occasionally '''PeNS''') consists of the nerves and [[ganglia]] outside of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/20114043|peripheral nervous system}}</ref>  The main function of the PNS is to connect the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) to the limbs and organs. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the [[bone]] of spine and skull, or by the [[blood–brain barrier]], leaving it exposed to [[toxin]]s and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the [[somatic nervous system]] and the [[autonomic nervous system]]; some textbooks also include [[sensory system]]s. It is also a part of the [[nervous system]].<ref>{{cite book

The [[cranial nerve]]s are part of the PNS with the exception of cranial nerve II, the optic nerve, along with the retina. The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon.<ref>Board Review Series – Neuroanatomy, Fourth Edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Maryland 2008, p. 177. ISBN 978-0-7817-7245-7.</ref> Cranial nerve ganglia originate in the CNS. However, the remaining eleven cranial nerve [[axons]] extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS.<ref name="White2008">{{cite book|author=James S.

== Specific nerves and plexi ==

Ten out of the twelve [[cranial nerves]] originate from the [[brainstem]], and mainly control the functions of the anatomic structures of the head with some exceptions. The nuclei of cranial nerves I and II lie in the forebrain and thalamus, respectively, and are thus not considered to be true cranial nerves. CN X (10) receives visceral sensory information from the thorax and abdomen, and CN XI (11) is responsible for innervating the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle|sternocleidomastoid]] and [[trapezius muscle]]s, neither of which is exclusively in the head.

[[Spinal nerve]]s take their origins from the [[spinal cord]]. They control the functions of the rest of the body. In humans, there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 1 coccygeal. In the cervical region, the spinal nerve roots come out ''above'' the corresponding vertebrae (i.e. nerve root between the skull and 1st cervical vertebrae is called spinal nerve C1). From the thoracic region to the coccygeal region, the spinal nerve roots come out ''below'' the corresponding vertebrae. It is important to note that this method creates a problem when naming the spinal nerve root between C7 and T1 (so it is called spinal nerve root C8). In the lumbar and sacral region, the spinal nerve roots travel within the dural sac and they travel below the level of L2 as the cauda equina.

===Cervical spinal nerves (C1–C4)===
{{Further2|[[Cervical plexus]]}}

The first 4 cervical spinal nerves, C1 through C4, split and recombine to produce a variety of nerves that subserve the neck and back of head.

Spinal nerve C1 is called the [[suboccipital nerve]] which provides motor innervation to muscles at the base of the [[Human skull|skull]].
C2 and C3 form many of the nerves of the neck, providing both sensory and motor control. These include the [[greater occipital nerve]] which provides sensation to the back of the [[head (anatomy)|head]], the [[lesser occipital nerve]] which provides sensation to the area behind the [[ear]]s, the [[greater auricular nerve]] and the [[lesser auricular nerve]]. See [[occipital neuralgia]].
The [[phrenic nerve]] arises from nerve roots C3, C4 and C5. It innervates the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], enabling [[breathing]]. If the spinal cord is transected above C3, then spontaneous breathing is not possible. See [[myelopathy]]

===Brachial plexus (C5–T1)===
{{Further2|[[Brachial plexus]]}}

The last four cervical spinal nerves, C5 through C8, and the first thoracic spinal nerve, T1,combine to form the [[brachial plexus]], or plexus brachialis,  a tangled array of nerves, splitting, combining and recombining, to form the nerves that subserve the upper-limb and upper back. Although the brachial plexus may appear tangled, it is highly organized and predictable, with little variation between people. See [[brachial plexus injuries]].

=== Lumbosacral plexus (L1–S4) ===
The [[anterior]] divisions of the [[lumbar nerves]], [[sacral nerves]], and [[coccygeal nerve]] form the [[lumbosacral plexus]], the first lumbar nerve being frequently joined by a branch from the twelfth thoracic. For descriptive purposes this plexus is usually divided into three parts:
* [[lumbar plexus]], [[sacral plexus]], and [[Pudendal plexus (nerves)|pudendal plexus]].

==Neurotransmitters==
The main [[neurotransmitters]] of the peripheral nervous system are [[acetylcholine]] and [[noradrenaline]]. However, there are several other neurotransmitters as well, jointly labeled [[Non-noradrenergic, non-cholinergic transmitter|Non-noradrenergic, non-cholinergic]] (NANC) transmitters. Examples of such transmitters include non-[[peptides]]: [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[gamma aminobutyric acid|GABA]], [[dopamine]], [[nitric oxide|NO]], and peptides: [[neuropeptide Y]], [[vasoactive intestinal peptide|VIP]], [[gonadotropin releasing hormone|GnRH]], [[Substance P]] and [[calcitonin gene related peptide|CGRP]].<ref name=Rang>Pharmacology, (Rang, Dale, Ritter & Moore, ISBN 0-443-07145-4, 5:th ed., Churchill Livingstone 2003).
