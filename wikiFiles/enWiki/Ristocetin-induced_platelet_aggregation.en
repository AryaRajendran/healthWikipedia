The '''ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation''' (RIPA) is an ex vivo assay for live platelet function to aggregate with help of [[von Willebrand factor]] (vWF) and exogenous antibiotic [[ristocetin]] added in a graded fashion<ref name="pmid17620">{{cite journal |author=Coller BS, Gralnick HR |title=Studies on the mechanism of ristocetin-induced platelet adhesion.

It is similar to the [[ristocetin cofactor activity]] but has the added benefit in that it can diagnose type 2B vWD and [[Bernard-Soulier syndrome]] because it uses patients live endogenous platelets, whereas [[Ristocetin Cofactor Assay]] tests the function of only the VWF and not the platelets. Riscocetin cofactor assay uses platelet poor plasma (with VWF but no platelets) and adds ristocetin and exogenous formalin fixed platelets which can passively agglutinate (but not actively "aggregate", as they are dead).

In an unknown fashion, the antibiotic [[ristocetin]] causes von Willebrand factor to bind the platelet receptor [[glycoprotein Ib]] (GpIb), so when ristocetin is added to normal blood, it causes agglutination of fixed platelets or initiates the initial agglutination phase of aggregation of live platelets. In von Willebrand disease, where von Willebrand factor is absent or defective, abnormal agglutination occurs:

* In type 1 vWD: hypoactive agglutination occurs
* In type 2A vWD: hypoactive agglutination occurs
* In type 2B vWD: '''hyperactive''' agglutination occurs
* In type 2M vWD: hypoactive agglutination occurs activity<ref name="vWD2m">{{cite journal |author=Riddell AF, Jenkins PV,  Nitu-Whalley IC, McCraw AH, Lee CA, Brown, SA |title=Use of the collagen-binding assay for von Willebrand factor in the analysis of type 2M von Willebrand disease: a comparison with the ristocetin cofactor assay |journal=British Journal of Haematology |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=187–92 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11841416 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03199.x}}</ref>

* In type 3 vWD: no agglutination occurs
