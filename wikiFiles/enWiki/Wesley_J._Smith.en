==Biography==
Smith practiced law in the San Fernando Valley from 1976–1985, at which time he left law practice to pursue other interests, particularly as a public policy advocate. His first book in 1987 was ''The Lawyer Book: A Nuts and Bolts Guide to Client Survival'', introduced by consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]] beginning a collaboration between the two men. Smith is a prolific author and a frequent contributor to [[National Review]]<ref>For example, see [[National Review]], "Better Dead Than Fed?" June 27, 1994.</ref> and [[The Weekly Standard]].<ref>For example, see [[The Weekly Standard]], "[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/684fncgd.asp The Hard Cell]," September 11, 2006.</ref> He closely followed the [[Terri Schiavo case]] in 2005, and [http://www.nationalreview.com/smithw/smithw-archive.asp wrote frequently] on the topic.<ref>For example, see [[The Weekly Standard]], "[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/443gtvyx.asp The Legacy of Terri Schiavo]," April 11, 2005.</ref> He opposes assisted suicide and euthanasia. He is also a noted critic of mainstream views in bioethics, human cloning research, [[radical environmentalism]], which he worries exhibits "anti-humanism,",<ref>[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTZkZmFmMGU4MzAzYThjOTBhMjNmZmQyNGMxZTM4Zjc=_print "Homo Sapiens, Get Lost," National Review Online]</ref> and of what he calls the radical animal liberation movement.<ref>For example, see [[San Francisco Chronicle]]"[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/06/18/INGQCJEDCC1.DTL Let Great Apes be Great Apes]," June 18, 2006.</ref> His book ''Culture of Death: The Assault on Medical Ethics in America'' was named Best Health Book of the Year at the 2001 Independent Publishers Book Awards.<ref>[http://www.independentpublisher.com/article.php?page=381 IPPY Awards 2001: The Results Are In! Announcing the Winners and Finalists of the Independent Publisher Book Awards 2001]</ref>

Smith is a frequent guest on radio and television talk shows, having appeared on national programs such as Good Morning America and Nightline, as well as internationally on BBC 4. He has testified as an expert witness in front of federal and state legislative committees,<ref>For example, Smith testified against assisted suicide before the [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2006_record&page=D560&position=all U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, & Property Rights], May 25, 2006</ref> and is an international public speaker.

His work as a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute is with the Project on Human Rights and Bioethics.

Smith is married to the syndicated ''San Francisco Chronicle'' columnist, [[Debra Saunders]].

==Criticism==
In a 2001 essay, physician Matthew K. Wynia and attorney Arthur Derse accused Smith of [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|selectively using evidence]] to create a false impression that [[bioethics]] is a monolithic field.<ref name="medgenmed.medscape.com">[http://medgenmed.medscape.com/viewarticle/408168_print Culture of Death: The Assault on Medical Ethics in America]</ref> They argued that Smith was "prepared to bend the truth to make a point, turn a stomach, and potentially radicalize a reader."<ref name="medgenmed.medscape.com" /> Smith rebutted these criticisms, stating in part, "Wynia and Derse assert that I claim bioethics is a monolith. That is not what I write. What I do believe is that bioethics has, generally, crystallized into an orthodoxy, perhaps even an ideology. I acknowledge that disagreements certainly exist within the field. But I view them, with some exceptions, as the arguing of people who agree on fundamentals but disagree on details -- sort of like Catholics bickering with Baptists."<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408180_print Hastings Center Report, Letter to Editor, October 2001]</ref>
