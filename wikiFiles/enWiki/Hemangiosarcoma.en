'''Hemangiosarcoma'''<ref>[http://www.akcchf.org/canine-health/your-dogs-health/disease-information/hemangiosarcoma.html American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation]. Accessed 2012-12-06</ref> is a rapidly growing, highly invasive variety of [[cancer]], occurring almost exclusively in dogs and rarely in cats. It is a [[sarcoma]] arising from the lining of blood vessels that is blood-filled channels and spaces are commonly observed microscopically. A frequent cause of death is the rupturing of this tumor causing the patient to rapidly bleed to death.

The term [[angiosarcoma]], when used without modifier, usually refers to hemangiosarcoma. However, [[glomangiosarcoma]] (8710/3) and [[lymphangiosarcoma]] (9170/3) are distinct conditions. Hemangiosarcomas are commonly associated with toxic exposure to [[thorium dioxide]] (Thorotrast), [[vinyl chloride]], and [[arsenic]].

==Hemangiosarcoma in dogs==

Hemangiosarcoma is quite common in [[dog]]s, and more so in certain breeds of dogs including [[German Shepherd]]s and [[Golden Retriever]]s.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th ed.|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>  It also occurs in [[cats]], but is much rarer. Dogs with hemangiosarcoma rarely show clinical signs until the tumor has become very large and has [[metastasize]]d. Typically, clinical signs are due to [[hypovolemia]] after the tumor ruptures, causing extensive bleeding. Owners of the affected dogs often discover that the dog has hemangiosarcoma only after the dog collapses.

The tumor most often appears on the [[spleen]], right [[heart]] base, or [[liver]], although varieties also appear on or under the skin or in other locations.  It is the most common tumor of the heart, and occurs in the [[right atrium]].  Here it can cause right-sided [[heart failure]], [[arrhythmia]]s, [[pericardial effusion]], and [[cardiac tamponade]].  Hemangiosarcoma of the spleen or [[liver]] is the most common tumor to cause [[hemorrhage]] in the [[abdomen]].<ref name=Morrison_1998>{{cite book|author=Morrison, Wallace B.|title=Cancer in Dogs and Cats|edition=1st ed.|publisher=Williams and Wilkins|year=1998|isbn=0-683-06105-4}}</ref>  Hemangiosarcoma of the [[skin]] usually appears as a small red or bluish-black lump.  It can also occur under the skin.  It is suspected that in the skin, hemangiosarcoma is caused by [[sunlight|sun]] exposure.<ref name=Morrison_1998/>  Occasionally, hemangiosarcoma of the skin can be a metastasis from visceral hemangiosarcoma. Other sites the tumor may occur include [[bone]], the [[kidney]], the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], [[muscle]], the [[mouth]], and the [[central nervous system]].

===Clinical features===
Presenting complaints and clinical signs are usually related to the site of origin of the primary tumor or to the presence of metastases, spontaneous tumor rupture, coagulopathies, or cardiac arrhythmias.  More than 50% of patients are presented because of acute collapse after spontaneous rupture of the primary tumor or its metastases.  Some episodes of collapse are a result of ventricular arrhythmias, which are relatively common in dogs with splenic or cardiac HSA.<ref>Nelson et al. Manual of Small Animal Internal Medicine.  Elsevier Mosby: St. Louis, Missouri (2005)</ref>

Most common clinical signs of visceral hemangiosarcoma include loss of appetite, [[arrhythmia]]s, weight loss, weakness, lethargy, collapse, pale [[mucous membranes]], and/or sudden death.  An enlarged abdomen is often seen due to hemorrhage.  Metastasis is most commonly to the liver, [[Greater omentum|omentum]], [[lung]]s, or [[brain]].

A retrospective study published in 1999 by Ware, ''et al.'', found a five times greater risk of cardiac hemangiosarcoma in spayed vs. intact female dogs and a 2.4 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma in neutered dogs as compared to intact males.

===Clinicopathologic findings===
Hemangiosarcoma can cause [[anemia]], thrombocytopenia (low [[platelet]] count), and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).  

HSAs usually cause a wide variety of hematologic and hemostatic abnormalities, including anemia; thrombocytopenia; presence of nRBC, schistocytes, and acanthocytes in the blood smear; and leukocytosis with neutrophilia, left shift, and monocytosis.

A definitive diagnosis requires biopsy and histopathology.

===Treatments===
Treatment includes [[chemotherapy]] and, where practical, removal of the tumor with the affected organ, such as with a [[splenectomy]].   Splenectomy alone gives an average survival time of 1–3 months. The addition of [[chemotherapy]], primarily consisting of the drug [[doxorubicin]], alone or in combination with other drugs, can increase the average survival time to 5–7 months.

Visceral hemangiosarcoma is usually fatal even with treatment, and usually within weeks or, at best, months.  In the skin, it can be cured in most cases with complete surgical removal as long as there is not visceral involvement.<ref name=Morrison_1998/>

Using herbal medicines have been adopted by many holistic veterinary practitioners and oncology vet specialists in combination with conventional chemotherapy or alternatively when surgery or chemotherapy are not suitable. 

On September 10, 2012, Dorothy Cimino Brown and Jennifer Reetz , two doctors from University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were published in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
Volume 2012 (2012), Article ID 384301, 8 pages doi:10.1155/2012/384301 for a research article on "Single Agent Polysaccharopeptide Delays Metastases and Improves Survival in Naturally Occurring Hemangiosarcoma"
The study found that the mushroom extract "I'm-Yunity" used in the study is able to delay the progression of metastases and provide the longest median survival times reported to date.
