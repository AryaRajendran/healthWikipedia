'''Nocardiosis''' is an [[infectious disease]] affecting either the [[lung]]s (''pulmonary nocardiosis'') or the whole body (''systemic nocardiosis''). It is due to infection by bacterium of the genus [[Nocardia]], most commonly ''[[Nocardia asteroides]]'' or ''[[Nocardia brasiliensis]]''. 

It is most common in men, especially those with a compromised immune system. In patients with brain infection, mortality exceeds 80%; in other forms, mortality is 50%, even with appropriate therapy.<ref name="wdbd7a">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/n/nocardiosis/book-diseases-7a.htm |title=Nocardiosis (Professional Guide to Diseases (Eighth Edition)) - WrongDiagnosis.com |accessdate=2007-07-12 |work=}}</ref> 

It is one of several conditions that have been called [[the great imitator]].<ref name="pmid15342974">{{cite journal |author=Lederman ER, Crum NF |title=A case series and focused review of nocardiosis: clinical and microbiologic aspects |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=300–13 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15342974 |doi= 10.1097/01.md.0000141100.30871.39|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0025-7974&volume=83&issue=5&spage=300}}</ref>

Cutaneous nocardiosis commonly occurs in immunocompetent hosts.<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Causes==
Normally found in soil, these organisms cause occasional sporadic disease in humans and animals throughout the world. Another well publicized find is that of Nocardia as an oral microflora. Nocardia spp. have been reported in the normal gingiva and periodontal pockets along with other species such as ''Actinomyces'', ''Arthromyces'' and ''Streptomyces'' spp.<ref name="aaaas">{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=GD|coauthors=Thurn, AN|title=Continued study of oral nocardia.|journal=Journal of dental research|date=1962 Nov-Dec|volume=41|pages=1279-92|doi=10.1177/00220345620410060401|pmid=13975308}}</ref>

The usual mode of transmission is inhalation of organisms suspended in dust. Another very common method is that by traumatic introduction, especially in the jaw. This leads to the entrance of Nocardia into the blood stream and the propagation of its pathogenic effects. Transmission by direct inoculation through puncture wounds or abrasions is less common.<ref name="wdbd7a" /> Generally, nocardial infection requires some degree of immune suppression.

==Symptoms==
'''Pulmonary Infection'''
* Produces a virulent form of pneumonia (progressive)
* night [[sweat]]s, [[fever]], [[cough]], chest pain
* Pulmonary nocardiosis is subacute in onset and refractory to standard antibiotherapy
* symptoms are more severe in immunocompromised individuals
* radiologic studies show multiple pulmonary infiltrates with tendency to central necrosis
'''Neurological Infection'''
* Headache, lethargy, confusion, seizures, sudden onset of neurological deficit
* CT scan shows cerebral abscess
* Nocardial meningitis is difficult to diagnose

'''Cardiac Conditions'''
* Nocardia has been highly linked to endocarditis as a main symptom
* In recorded cases, it has caused damage to heart valves whether natural or prosthetic

'''Lymphocutaneous disease'''
* Nocardial cellulitis is akin to [[erysipela]] but is less acute
* Nodular lymphangeitis mimics sporotrichosis with multiple nodules alongside a lymphatic pathway
* [[Mycetoma]] is a rare complication and osteitis may ensue 
'''Ocular disease'''
* Very rarely nocardiae cause [[keratitis]]
* Generally there is a history of ocular trauma
'''Disseminated nocardiosis'''
* Dissemination occurs through the spreading enzymes possessed by the bacteria
* Disseminated infection can occur in very immunocompromised patients
* It generally involves both lungs and brain
* Fever, moderate or very high can be seen
* Multiple cavitating pulmonary infiltrates develop
* Cerebral abscesses arise later
* Cutaneous lesions are very rarely seen
* If untreated, the prognosis is poor for this form of disease

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis may be difficult.
Nocardiae are weakly [[acid-fast]] organisms and can be visualized by a modified [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]] like Fite-Faraco method
In the clinical laboratory, routine cultures may be held for insufficient time to grow nocardiae, and referral to a reference laboratory may be needed for species identification.<ref name="wddbmd">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/artic/nocardiosis_dbmd.htm |title=Nocardiosis: DBMD - WrongDiagnosis.com |accessdate=2007-07-12 |work=}}</ref>
Infiltration and [[pleural effusion]] are usually seen via [[x-ray]].

==Treatment==
Nocardiosis requires at least 6 months of treatment, preferably with [[co-trimoxazole]] or high doses of [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s. In patients who don’t respond to sulfonamide treatment, other drugs, such as [[ampicillin]], [[erythromycin]], or [[minocycline]], may be added. 

Treatment also includes surgical drainage of abscesses and excision of necrotic tissue. The acute phase requires complete [[bed rest]]; as the patient improves, activity can increase.<ref name="wdbd7a" /> 

A new combination drug therapy (sulfonamide, [[ceftriaxone]], and [[amikacin]]) has also shown promise.<ref name="wddbmd" />
