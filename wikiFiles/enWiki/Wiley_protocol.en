The '''Wiley Protocol''' is a controversial form of [[bioidentical hormone replacement therapy]] (BHRT) devised and advocated by [[T. S. Wiley]].  The protocol claims to relieve the [[Menopause#Symptoms|symptoms of menopause]] but is also promoted as increasing overall health through the recreation of a pre-menopausal woman's monthly hormonal cycle using rhythmic doses of hormones standardized to a uniform purity.  Wiley claims the protocol is a step beyond the [[symptomatic treatment]] of conventional [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]].   

The protocol has been criticized by members of the medical community for the dosages of the hormones used, side effects of the treatment, potential physiologic effects, Wiley's lack of medical or [[Clinical research|clinical]] qualifications to design the protocol, lack of [[Empirical method|empirical evidence]] demonstrating it as safe or effective, ethical problems with the [[clinical trial]] that is being run to test it and potential financial conflicts of interest regarding financial incentives.

==Specific dosing==
The Wiley Protocol uses [[Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy|bioidentical]] hormones, specifically [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]].  Hormones are applied [[Transdermal patch|transdermally]], using an oil-based skin cream for [[topical]] administration.<ref name = patent>{{cite web | url = http://www.freshpatents.com/Hormone-replacement-composition-and-method-dt20070301ptan20070049567.php?type=description | title = Hormone replacement composition and method | publisher = FreshPatents.com | date = 2007-01-03 | accessdate = 2007-12-20 | author = [[T.S. Wiley]] }}</ref>  Doses of the hormones vary throughout a 28-day cycle that is designed to mimic the hormone levels and changes of a young woman who experiences regular [[menstruation]], with each hormone cycling and peaking at separate times throughout the period.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Testimony of T.S. Wiley before the Special Committee on Aging United States Senate | url = http://aging.senate.gov/events/hr171tw.pdf | format=PDF | date = 2007-04-19 | publisher = United States Senate Special Committee on Aging | accessdate = 2007-12-20 }}</ref>  The protocol is promoted as differing from conventional hormone replacement therapy in several ways:
* The use of plant-derived hormones that are identical to endogenous hormones found in the body, rather than the synthetic derivatives of conventional hormone replacement therapy such as [[premarin]]<ref name = patent/>
* A dose that varies over a 28-day cycle rather than remaining static<ref name = patent/>
* Topical rather than oral administration<ref name = patent/>
The protocol also includes a follow-up program to monitor the [[Blood plasma|serum]] of the bioidentical hormones.<ref name = patent/>

Wiley has stated that in her opinion, the most important aspect of the protocol is the specific schedule and levels of the hormone doses rather than their bioidentical nature.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/226-beauty-now/episodes/2969-interview-ts | title = Interview with T.S. Wiley }}</ref>

A [[patent]] was granted for the protocol in 2011 for the specific blend of hormones and dosing method.<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 7879830 | status = patent  | title = Hormone replacement composition and method | gdate = 2011-02-01 | fdate = 2005-08-25 | inventor = [[T.

==Criticism==
Concerns have been raised that [[Blood test|serum levels]] may not be an acceptable marker for [[Topical|transdermally administered]] hormones, that some women have experienced significant side effects while following the protocol and have stopped using it, and that the dosages used are too high and not physiologic.<ref>{{ cite journal | title = Summary of the American College for Advancement in Medicine May 2005 Conference: Menopause, Andropause: Power in Transition | author = Feig SA, Hynote E, Speight N, Magaziner A, Miranda RA, Schachter MA | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | date=  September 2005 | pages = 413–419 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/neh113 | pmc=1193553}}</ref><ref name = Rosenthalmenopause>{{cite journal |author=Rosenthal MS |title=The Wiley Protocol: an analysis of ethical issues |journal=Menopause |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=1014–1022 |year=2008 |pmid=18551081 |doi=10.1097/gme.0b013e318178862e |url=}}</ref>

[[T. S. Wiley]] and [[Suzanne Somers]] have been criticized by some physicians for their advocacy of the Wiley Protocol. A group of seven doctors issued a public letter to Somers and her publisher, [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]], in which they state that the protocol is "scientifically unproven and dangerous" and cite Wiley's lack of medical and clinical qualifications.<ref>{{cite web | author = [[Erika Schwartz|Schwartz E]], Schwarzbein D.
