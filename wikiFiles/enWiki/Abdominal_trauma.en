'''Abdominal trauma''' is an injury to the [[abdomen]].  It may be [[blunt trauma|blunt]] or [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]] and may involve damage to the abdominal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].  Signs and symptoms include [[abdominal pain]], [[tenderness (medicine)|tenderness]], rigidity, and [[bruise|bruising]] of the external abdomen.  Abdominal trauma presents a risk of severe [[blood loss]] and [[infection]]. Diagnosis may involve [[ultrasonography]], [[computed tomography]], and [[peritoneal lavage]], and treatment may involve surgery.<ref name="Jansen08"/> Injury to the lower [[chest]] may cause splenic or liver injuries.<ref name="OxHandbookEM">{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Emergency Medicine |last=Wyatt |first=Jonathon |authorlink= |coauthors=Illingworth, RN.

== Classification ==
Abdominal trauma is divided into blunt and penetrating types.  While [[penetrating trauma#Abdomen|penetrating abdominal trauma]] (PAT) is usually diagnosed based on clinical signs, diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma is more likely to be delayed or altogether missed because clinical signs are less obvious.<ref name="Jansen08">

</ref>  Blunt injuries predominate in rural areas, while penetrating ones are more frequent in urban settings.<ref name="Doherty05"/>  Penetrating trauma is further subdivided into [[stabbing|stab wounds]] and [[gunshot wound]]s, which require different methods of treatment.<ref name="Chih04"/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Pneumoperitoneum.jpg|right|thumb|Pneumoperitoneum, seen as an air bubble on the lower left side of the X-ray film]]
People injured in [[motor vehicle collision]]s may present with a "[[seat belt]] sign," bruising on the abdomen along the site of the lap portion of the safety belt; this sign is associated with a high rate of injury to the abdominal organs.<ref name="Bixby08"/> Seatbelts may also cause abrasions and hematomas; up to 30 percent of people with such signs have associated internal injuries.<ref name="Doherty05"/> Early indications of abdominal trauma include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[fever]].<ref name="Olshaker06"/> [[hematuria|Blood in the urine]] is another sign.<ref name="Bixby08"/>  The injury may present with [[abdominal pain]], [[tenderness (medicine)|tenderness]],<ref name="Chih04"/> [[distension]], or rigidity to the touch, and [[bowel sounds]] may be diminished or absent.  [[Abdominal guarding]] is a tensing of the [[abdominal muscles|abdominal wall muscles]] to guard inflamed organs within the abdomen.  [[Pneumoperitoneum]], air or gas in the [[abdominal cavity]], may be an indication of rupture of a hollow organ.  In penetrating injuries, an [[disembowelment|evisceration]] (protrusion of internal organs out of a wound) may be present.<ref name="Chih343">Chih, p.343</ref>

Injuries associated with intra-abdominal trauma include [[rib fracture]]s, [[vertebral fracture]]s, pelvic fractures, and injuries to the [[abdominal wall]].<ref name="Hemmila231">Hemmila, p. 231</ref>

Guidelines

Presentation                  Cause
Hemorrhage.                  Liver / spleen rupture
Hematuria.                      Kidney, bladder, ureter injury
Back pain.                       Injury to retroperitoneum
Peritonitis.                       Injury hollow viscus
Respiratory.                    Pneumothorax

== Causes ==
Motor vehicle collisions are a common source of blunt abdominal trauma.<ref name="Doherty05"/> Seat belts reduce the incidence of injuries such as [[head injury]] and [[chest injury]], but present a threat to such abdominal organs as the [[pancreas]] and the [[intestines]], which may be displaced or compressed against the [[spinal column]].<ref name="Doherty05"/>  Children are especially vulnerable to abdominal injury from seat belts, because they have softer abdominal regions and seat belts were not designed to fit them.<ref name="Bixby08">

Gunshot wounds, which are higher energy than stab wounds, are usually more damaging than the latter.<ref name="Chih347">Chih, pp. 346–348</ref> Gunshot wounds that penetrate the [[peritoneum]] result in significant damage to major intra-abdominal structures in some 90 percent of cases.<ref name="Chih347"/>

== Pathophysiology ==

Abdominal trauma can be life threatening because abdominal organs, especially those in the [[retroperitoneal space]], can bleed profusely, and the space can hold a great deal of blood.<ref name="Blank06">

</ref>  Solid abdominal organs, such as the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s, bleed profusely when cut or torn, as do major blood vessels such as the [[aorta]] and [[Venae cavae|vena cava]].<ref name="Blank06"/>  Hollow organs such as the [[stomach]], while not as likely to result in shock from profuse bleeding, present a serious risk of infection,<ref name="Blank06"/> especially if such an injury is not treated promptly.<ref name="Doherty05"/>  Gastrointestinal organs such as the bowel can spill their contents into the abdominal cavity.<ref name="Doherty05"/>  [[Hemorrhage]] and systemic infection are the main causes of deaths that result from abdominal trauma.<ref name="Doherty05"/>

One or more of the intra-abdominal organs may be injured in abdominal trauma.<!--
injuries by organ:
[[Stomach]],  with [[cecum]] and [[appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] [[gallbladder]] [[ureters]]
-->  The characteristics of the injury are determined in part by which organ or organs are injured.

=== Liver===
{{Main|Liver injury}}
The [[liver]], the most vulnerable abdominal organ to all forms of injury because of its size and location (in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen), is injured in about five percent of all people admitted to a hospital for trauma.<ref name="Moore04">{{cite book |author= Fabian TC, Bee TK |chapter= Liver and biliary trauma |editor = Moore EJ, Feliciano DV, Mattox KL |title=Trauma |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub.

=== Spleen ===
Spleen is the most common damaged organ in blunt abdominal trauma. The [[spleen]] is the second most commonly injured intra-abdominal organ in children.<ref name="Visrutaratna08"/>  A laceration of the spleen may be associated with hematoma.<ref name="Visrutaratna08"/>  Because of the spleen's ability to bleed profusely, a [[ruptured spleen]] can be life threatening, resulting in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]].  However, unlike the liver, penetrating trauma to the spleen, pancreas and kidneys do not present as much of an immediate threat of shock unless they lacerate a major blood vessel supplying the organs, such as the [[renal artery]].<ref name="Doherty05"/>  Fractures of the left lower ribs are associated with spleen lacerations in 20 percent of cases.<ref name="Hemmila231" />

=== Pancreas ===
The pancreas may be injured in abdominal trauma, for example by laceration or contusion.<ref name="Bixby08"/> Pancreatic injuries, most commonly caused by bicycle accidents (especially by impact with the handlebars) in children and vehicular accidents in adults, usually occur in isolation in children and accompanied by other injuries in adults.<ref name="Bixby08"/>  Indications that the pancreas is injured include enlargement and the presence of fluid around the pancreas.<ref name="Bixby08"/>

=== Kidneys ===
[[File:Kidneyhematoma.png|thumb|A large hematoma (closed arrow) of the left kidney (open arrow)]]
The kidneys may also be injured; they are somewhat but not completely protected by the ribs.<ref name="Olshaker06"/> Kidney lacerations and contusions may also occur.<ref name="Visrutaratna08"/>  Kidney injury, a common finding in children with blunt abdominal trauma, may be associated with [[hematuria|bloody urine]].<ref name="Visrutaratna08"/>  Kidney lacerations may be associated with [[urinoma]] or leakage of urine into the abdomen.<ref name="Bixby08"/> A ''shattered kidney'' is one with multiple lacerations and an associated fragmentation of the kidney tissue.<ref name="Bixby08"/>

=== Bowel ===
The [[small intestine]] takes up a large part of the abdomen ironically and is likely to be damaged in penetrating injury.<ref name="Doherty05">

}}
</ref>  The bowel may be perforated.<ref name="Bixby08"/> Gas within the abdominal cavity seen on CT is understood to be a diagnostic sign of [[bowel perforation]]; however intra-abdominal air can also be caused by [[pneumothorax]] (air in the [[pleural cavity]] outside the [[lung]]s that has escaped from the [[respiratory system]]) or [[pneumomediastinum]] (air in the [[mediastinum]], the center of the chest cavity).<ref name="Bixby08"/>  The injury may not be detected on CT.<ref name="Bixby08"/>  Bowel injury may be associated with complications such as infection, [[abscess]], [[bowel obstruction]], and the formation of a [[fistula]].<ref name="Bixby08"/>  Bowel perforation requires surgery.<ref name="Bixby08"/>

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:LDLTA.jpg|thumb|right|CT scan showing the liver and a kidney]]

One study found that ten percent of [[polytrauma]] patients who had no clinical signs of abdominal injury did have evidence of the such injuries using [[radiology|radiological imaging]].<ref name="Jansen08"/>  Diagnostic techniques used include [[CT scan]]ning, [[ultrasound]],<ref name="Jansen08"/> and [[X-ray]].<ref name="Chih04"/>  X-ray can help determine the path of a penetrating object and locate any foreign matter left in the wound, but may not be helpful in blunt trauma.<ref name="Chih04"/> Diagnostic [[peritoneal lavage]] is a controversial technique but can be used to detect injury to abdominal organs: a catheter is placed in the [[peritoneal cavity]], and if fluid is present, it is aspirated and examined for blood or evidence of organ rupture.<ref name="Jansen08"/>  If this does not reveal evidence of injury, sterile saline is infused into the cavity and evacuated and examined for blood or other material.<ref name="Jansen08"/>  While peritoneal lavage is an accurate way to test for bleeding, it carries a risk of injuring the abdominal organs, may be difficult to perform, and may lead to unnecessary surgery; thus it has largely been replaced by ultrasound in Europe and North America.<ref name="Jansen08"/>  Ultrasound can detect fluid such as blood or gastrointestinal contents in the abdominal cavity,<ref name="Jansen08"/> and it is a noninvasive [[medical procedure|procedure]] and relatively safe for the patient.<ref name="Bixby08"/> CT scanning is the preferred technique for people who are not at immediate risk of shock, but since ultrasound can be performed right in an emergency room, the latter is recommended for people who are not stable enough to move to CT scanning.<ref name="Jansen08"/>  However, people with abdominal trauma frequently need CT scans for other trauma (for example, head or chest CT); in these cases abdominal CT can be performed at the same time without wasting time in patient care.<ref name="Bixby08"/>  Diagnostic [[laparoscopy]] or exploratory [[laparotomy]] may also be performed if other diagnostic methods do not yield conclusive results.<ref name="Doherty05"/>

===CT===
CT is only able to detect 76% of hollow viscous injuries and patients who have negative scans must often be observed and rechecked if they deteriorate.<ref>{{cite book |author=Amal Mattu; Deepi Goyal; Barrett, Jeffrey W.; Joshua Broder; DeAngelis, Michael; Peter Deblieux; Gus M. Garmel; Richard Harrigan; David Karras; Anita L'Italien; David Manthey |title=Emergency medicine: avoiding the pitfalls and improving the outcomes |publisher=Blackwell Pub./BMJ Books |location=Malden, Mass |year=2007 |pages=61 |isbn=1-4051-4166-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> However, CT has been demonstrated to be useful in screening patients with certain forms of abdominal trauma in order to avoid unnecessary laparotomies, which can significantly increase the cost and length of hospitalizations.<ref>Demetriades D, Velmahos G, Cornell E 3rd, et al. Selective nonoperative management of gunshot wounds of the anterior abdomen. Arch Surg 1997; 132:178–183</ref> A meta-analysis of CT use in penetrating abdominal traumas demonstrated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy >= 95%, with a PPV of 85% and an NPV of 98%.<ref>Goodman CS, Hur JY, Adajar MA, Coulam CH., How well does CT predict the need for laparotomy in hemodynamically stable patients with penetrating abdominal injury? A review and meta-analysis., AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2009 Aug;193(2):432-7.</ref> This suggests that CT is excellent for avoiding unnecessary laparotomies but must be augmented by other clinical criteria to determine the need for surgical exploration (23.37 positive [[Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratio]], 0.05 negative likelihood ratio).

== Treatment ==
Initial treatment involves stabilizing the patient enough to ensure adequate airway, breathing, and circulation, and identifying other injuries.<ref name="Chih04"/>  Surgery may be needed to repair injured organs. Surgical exploration is necessary for people with penetrating injuries and signs of [[peritonitis]] or shock.<ref name="Doherty05"/>  [[Laparotomy]] is often performed in blunt abdominal trauma,<ref name="Jansen08"/> and is urgently required if an abdominal injury causes a large, potentially deadly bleed.<ref name="Doherty05"/> However, intra-abdominal injuries are also frequently successfully treated nonoperatively.<ref name="Chih04"/><ref name="Bixby08"/>  The use of CT scanning allows care providers to use less surgery because they can identify injuries that can be managed conservatively and rule out other injuries that would need surgery.<ref name="Chih04"/>  Depending on the injuries, a patient may or may not need [[intensive care]].<ref name="Bixby08"/>

== Prognosis ==
If abdominal injury is not diagnosed promptly, a worse outcome is associated.<ref name="Jansen08"/>  Delayed treatment is associated with an especially high [[disability|morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] if perforation of the gastrointestinal tract is involved.<ref name="Visrutaratna08">
