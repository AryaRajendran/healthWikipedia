'''Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency''' is a rare [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]<ref name=Ralser_et_al_2006/> [[inborn errors of metabolism|metabolic disorder]] which was initially described in 1965.<ref name=Schneider_et_al_1965>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM196502042720503 | last = Schneider | first = Arthur S. | coauthors = William N.

It is a unique [[glycolysis|glycolytic]] [[enzymopathy]] that is characterized by chronic [[haemolytic anaemia]], [[cardiomyopathy]], susceptibility to infections, severe neurological dysfunction, and, in most cases, death in early childhood.<ref name=Schneider_2000>{{cite journal | last = Schneider | first = Arthur S. | year = 2000 | month = Mar | title = Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency: historical perspectives and molecular aspects | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–140 |pmid=10916682 | doi = 10.1053/beha.2000.0061 | url =   | journal = Best Practice & Research Clinical Haematology}}</ref> The disease is exceptionally rare with fewer than 100 patients diagnosed worldwide. 

==Cause, Pathophysiology and Genetics==
[[Image:Autorecessive.jpg|thumb|right|Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Thirteen different mutations in the respective gene, which is located at [[chromosome 12]]p13 and encodes the ubiquitous housekeeping enzyme [[triosephosphate isomerase]] (TPI), have been discovered so far.<ref name=Schneider_2000/> TPI is a crucial enzyme of [[glycolysis]] and catalyzes the interconversion of [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] and [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]]. A marked decrease in TPI activity and an accumulation of [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] have been detected in [[erythrocyte]] extracts of [[homozygous]] (two identical mutant alleles) and [[compound heterozygous]] (two different mutant alleles) TPI deficiency patients. Heterozygous individuals are clinically unaffected, even if their residual TPI activity is reduced. Recent work suggests that not a direct inactivation, but an alteration in TPI [[protein dimerization|dimerization]] might underlie the pathology.<ref name=Ralser_et_al_2006>{{cite journal | last = Ralser | first = Markus | coauthors = Gino Heeren, Michael Breitenbach, Hans Lehrach, Sylvia Krobitsch | date = December 20, 2006 | editor1-last = Janbon | editor1-first = Guilhem | title = Triose Phosphate Isomerase Deficiency Is Caused by Altered Dimerization–Not Catalytic Inactivity–of the Mutant Enzymes | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = e30 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000030 | url =  | pmid = 17183658 | pmc = 1762313 }}</ref> This might explain why the disease is rare, but inactive TPI alleles have been detected at higher frequency implicating a [[heterozygote advantage]] of inactive TPI alleles.

The most common mutation causing TPI deficiency is TPI Glu104Asp. Interestingly, all carriers of the mutation are descendants of a common ancestor, a person that lived in what is today France or England more than 1000 years ago.<ref name=Schneider_et-al_1996>{{cite journal |author=Schneider A, Westwood B, Yim C, ''et al.'' |title=The 1591C mutation in triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) deficiency.
