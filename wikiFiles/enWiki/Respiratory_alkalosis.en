'''Respiratory alkalosis''' is a medical condition in which increased respiration ([[hyperventilation]]) elevates the blood [[pH]] (a condition generally called [[alkalosis]]). It is one of four basic categories of disruption of [[acid-base homeostasis]].

==Terminology==
*'''Alkalosis''' refers to disorders that elevate arterial pH to > 7.45.
*'''Alkalemia''' refers to a arterial pH > 7.45.

==Types==
There are two types of respiratory alkalosis: [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] and [[acute (medicine)|acute]].

* ''Acute respiratory alkalosis'' occurs rapidly. For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO<sub>2</sub> in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 2 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion due to acute compensation. During acute respiratory alkalosis, the person may lose consciousness where the rate of ventilation will resume to normal.

* ''Chronic respiratory alkalosis'' is a more long-standing condition. For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO<sub>2</sub> in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 5 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion. The drop of 5 mEq/L of bicarbonate ion is a compensation effect which reduces the alkalosis effect of the drop in PCO<sub>2</sub> in blood. This is termed metabolic compensation.

==Mechanism==
Respiratory alkalosis generally occurs when some stimulus (see "Causes" below) makes a person hyperventilate. The increased breathing produces increased [[alveoli|alveolar]] respiration, expelling [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] from the circulation. This alters the dynamic [[chemical equilibrium]] of carbon dioxide in the circulatory system, and the system reacts according to [[Le Chatelier's principle]]. Circulating hydrogen ions and bicarbonate are shifted through the [[carbonic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) intermediate to make more CO<sub>2</sub> via the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]] according to the following reaction:

:<math>\rm HCO_3^- + H^+ \rightarrow H_2CO_3 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O</math>

The net result of this is decreased circulating hydrogen ion concentration, and thus increased [[pH]] (alkalosis). There is also a decrease in ionized blood [[calcium]] concentration.

===Causes===
Respiratory alkalosis may be produced accidentally ([[iatrogenic]]ally) during excessive [[mechanical ventilation]]. Other causes include:
* [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] causes: [[anxiety]], [[hysteria]] and [[Stress (medicine)|stress]]
* [[Central nervous system|CNS]] causes: [[stroke]], [[subarachnoid hemorrhage|subarachnoid haemorrhage]], [[meningitis]]
* drug use: [[doxapram]], [[aspirin]], [[caffeine]] and [[coffee]] abuse
* moving into [[high altitude]] areas, where the low [[atmospheric pressure]] of oxygen stimulates increased ventilation
* lung disease such as [[pneumonia]], where a [[hypoxic drive]] governs breathing more than CO<sub>2</sub> levels (the normal determinant)
* [[fever]], which stimulates the respiratory centre in the brainstem
* [[pregnancy]]
* high levels of NH4+ leading to brain swelling and decreased blood flow to the brain

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of respiratory alkalosis are related to the decreased blood carbon dioxide levels, and include peripheral [[paraesthesiae]]. In addition, the alkalosis may disrupt calcium ion balance, and cause the symptoms of [[hypocalcaemia]] (such as [[tetany (medical sign)|tetany]] and [[fainting]]) with no fall in total serum calcium levels.

==In popular culture==
In ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'', [[Michael Crichton]]'s first novel, only two people exposed to a pathogenic extraterrestrial microbe survive. Scientists investigating these survivors discover that each had abnormal blood pH. One, a baby, had respiratory alkalosis due to constant crying; the other, an old man, drinks Sterno. As a result, it becomes clear that the microbe cannot survive outside a narrow pH range.
