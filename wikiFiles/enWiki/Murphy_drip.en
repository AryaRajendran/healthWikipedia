==History==
The Murphy drip was invented by [[Wisconsin]] surgeon [[John Benjamin Murphy]], for the purpose of administering a proctoclysis for [[rehydration|hydration]] and replenishment of [[electrolyte]]s, via a [[sodium chloride|sodium]] and [[calcium chloride]] solution. This would be used when administration by mouth was not possible because of the condition of the patient.<ref>Morgenstern, Leon, "John Benjamin Murphy (1857-1916): An American Surgical Phenomenon", ''Surgical Innovation'', '''vol 13''', No 1, pp1-3, Sage Publications, March 2006</ref> The Murphy drip was described in the April 1909 issue of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]].<ref>[[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (April 17, 1909) ''Proctoclysys in the Treatment of Peritonitis (the Murphy Drip).''</ref> By as early as July 1928, the Murphy drip was considered an auxiliary method of injection behind [[intravenous therapy]] and [[Injection_%28medicine%29#Subcutaneous_injection|subcutaneous injection]], the two principal methods of [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] at that time.<ref>[[Homer R. Spence]] (November 3, 1933) [[California_Courts_of_Appeal#First_District|California Courts of Appeal, First District, Division 2]].

The Murphy drip can be used for administering drugs by this route and the apparatus is also used in conjunction with a [[catheter]] for [[bladder]] irrigation.
The term can even be applied to apparatus used to administer fluids [[intravenous]]ly.<ref>"New Syphilis Cure", ''TIME Magazine'', 22 April 1940, Time Inc. retrieved [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763892,00.html online] 20 June 2008.</ref>

A curious anecdote involving the Murphy drip is related by [[Walter Lord]] in his book on the [[Battle of Midway]]. On 4 June 1942 Pharmacist's Mate Edwin Miller was stationed on Sand Island (part of the [[Midway Atoll]]) and was making ready for the expected Japanese attack. Miller prepared undrinkably strong coffee which, he claimed, was to be used in an "[[Coffee enema|old fashioned]]" treatment for [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] - administration of strong coffee through the rectum via a Murphy drip. When the attack got underway, Miller was joined by his commanding officer and doctor in charge, Lieutenant Commander A. E. Ady, who did not appear to know the medical purpose of the coffee and asked for some to be poured. Miller thought that it would be amusing to let his commander drink it, but made the mistake of also drinking some himself. Dr. Ady continued to tell jokes throughout the attack. Miller, however, paid for his practical joke and was sick.<ref>Lord, Walter, ''Midway: The Incredible Victory'', pp98, 104, 105, Harper & Row 1967, ISBN 1-84022-236-0</ref>

==Set up==
A description of a Murphy drip set up is contained in the 1932 [[Kansas Supreme Court]] legal case, ''Ratliffe v. Wesley Hospital and Nurses' Training School:''<ref name="training">[[Edward R. Sloan]] (May 7, 1932) [[Kansas Supreme Court]]. ''Ratliffe v. Wesley Hospital and Nurses' Training School.'' No. 30270. 135 Kan. 306. 10 P.2d 859.</ref>
<blockquote>On February 14, 1929, "Dr. Horn directed the nurse to use the proctoclysis, known as the “Murphy drip.” While the operation was in progress a student nurse in the employ of the hospital prepared the room for the return of the appellant. The proctoclysis set was a part of the equipment of the hospital and was assembled and placed at or near the foot of the bed by the student nurse. The proctoclysis set consists of a standard which is an iron pole setting on a tripod containing hooks at intervals, and on these hooks by means of a chain, tape, string, or piece of gauze is hung a can containing hot water and soda solution. From this can a tube extends which is inserted in the rectum of the patient to whom the proctoclysis is administered. It was necessary to keep the solution hot in order that it would have a body temperature after dropping through the tube and entering the body. ... It was not unusual for the vessel holding the water to be fastened to the standard by gauze, string, or other bandage, although a part of the vessels were equipped with chains."<ref name="training"/></blockquote>
