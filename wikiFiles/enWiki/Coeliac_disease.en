'''Coeliac disease''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|iː|l|i|.|æ|k}}; spelled '''celiac disease''' in North America<ref>See [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|American and British English spelling differences]].</ref> and often '''celiac sprue''') is an [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disorder of the [[small intestine]] that occurs in [[Genetic predisposition|genetically predisposed]] people of all ages from middle infancy onward. Symptoms include pain and discomfort in the digestive tract, chronic constipation and [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], [[failure to thrive]] (in children), and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], but these may be absent, and symptoms in other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ systems]] have been described. Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with Coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food.

Increasingly, diagnoses are being made in [[asymptomatic]] persons as a result of increased [[Screening (medicine)|screening]];<ref name="VanHeelWest">{{Cite journal| author = van Heel D, West J | title = Recent advances in coeliac disease | url = http://gut.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/55/7/1037 | journal = Gut | volume = 55 | issue = 7 | pages = 1037–46 | year = 2006 | pmid=16766754 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2005.075119 | pmc = 1856316}} <!-- PMC 1856316 from 9 Jan --></ref> the condition is thought to affect between 1 in 1,750 and 1 in 105 people in the United States.<ref name="nih_epi"/>
Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to [[gliadin]], a [[prolamin]] ([[gluten]] protein) found in wheat, and similar proteins found in the crops of the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Triticeae]] (which includes other common grains such as [[barley]] and [[rye]]).<ref name="Lancet">{{Cite journal|author=Di Sabatino A, Corazza GR |title=Coeliac disease |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9673 |pages=1480–93 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19394538 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60254-3}}</ref>

Upon exposure to gliadin, and specifically to three peptides found in prolamins, the enzyme [[tissue transglutaminase]] modifies the protein, and the [[immune system]] cross-reacts with the small-bowel tissue, causing an [[inflammation|inflammatory reaction]]. That leads to a truncating of the villi lining the small intestine (called villous atrophy). This [[malabsorption|interferes with the absorption]] of nutrients because the [[intestinal villus|intestinal villi]] are responsible for absorption. The only known effective treatment is a lifelong [[gluten-free diet]].<ref name="Lancet"/> While the disease is caused by a reaction to wheat proteins, it is not the same as [[wheat allergy]].

This condition has several other names, including cœliac disease (with [[Œ|''œ'' ligature]]), c(o)eliac sprue, nontropical sprue, endemic sprue, gluten enteropathy or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and gluten intolerance. The term ''coeliac'' derived from the Greek κοιλιακός (''koiliakós'', "abdominal") and was introduced in the 19th century in a translation of what is generally regarded as an ancient Greek description of the disease by [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]].<ref name="Aretaeus">{{Cite book|last=Adams F, translator |title=The extant works of Aretaeus, The Cappadocian |url=http://books.google.com/?id=v4gIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PT1&q= |chapter= On The Cœliac Affection |pages=350–1|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=v4gIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA350#v=onepage&q=&f=false |accessdate=12 December 2009 |year=1856 |publisher=Sydenham Society |location=London}}</ref><ref name="Losowsky">{{Cite journal|author=Losowsky MS |title=A history of coeliac disease |journal=Dig Dis |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=112–20 |year=2008 |pmid=18431060 |doi=10.1159/000116768}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Severe coeliac disease leads to the characteristic symptoms of pale, loose and greasy stool ([[steatorrhoea]]) and weight loss or failure to gain weight (in young children). People with milder coeliac disease may have symptoms that are much more subtle and occur in other organs than the bowel itself. It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any symptoms whatsoever.<ref name=Lancet/> Many adults with subtle disease only have fatigue or [[anaemia]].<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

===Gastrointestinal===
The diarrhoea that is characteristic of coeliac disease is (chronic) [[steatorrhoea|pale]], voluminous and malodorous. [[Abdominal pain]] and cramping, bloatedness with [[abdominal distension]] (thought to be due to fermentative production of bowel gas) and [[mouth ulcer]]s<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Ferguson R, Basu M, Asquith P, Cooke W | title = Jejunal mucosal abnormalities in patients with recurrent aphthous ulceration | journal = Br Med J | volume = 1 | issue = 6000 | pages = 11–13 | year = 1976 | pmid=1247715 | pmc=1638254 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.6000.11}}</ref> may be present. As the bowel becomes more damaged, a degree of [[lactose intolerance]] may develop.<ref name=Lancet/> Frequently, the symptoms are ascribed to [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS), only later to be recognised as coeliac disease; a small proportion of people with symptoms of IBS have underlying coeliac disease, and screening for coeliac disease is recommended for those with IBS symptoms.<ref name=NICEIBS>{{NICE|61|Irritable bowel syndrome|2008}}</ref>

Coeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both [[adenocarcinoma]] ([[small intestine cancer]]) and [[lymphoma]] of the small bowel ([[enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma]] or EATL). This risk returns to baseline with diet. Long-standing and untreated disease may lead to other complications, such as ulcerative jejunitis (ulcer formation of the small bowel) and stricturing (narrowing as a result of scarring with obstruction of the bowel).<ref name=AGA>{{Cite journal| title = American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement: Celiac Sprue | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 120 | issue = 6 | pages = 1522–5 | year = 2001 | pmid=11313323 | url = http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/PIIS0016508501701618/fulltext | doi = 10.1053/gast.2001.24055}}</ref>

===Malabsorption-related===
The changes in the bowel make it less able to absorb nutrients, minerals and the [[fat-soluble]] vitamins A, D, E, and K.<ref name=Lancet/><ref name=AFP>{{Cite journal|author=Presutti RJ, Cangemi JR, Cassidy HD, Hill DA |title=Celiac disease |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=76 |issue=12 |pages=1795–802 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18217518 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20071215/1795.html}}</ref>
* The inability to absorb carbohydrates and fats may cause [[weight loss]] (or [[failure to thrive]]/stunted growth in children) and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] or lack of energy.
* [[Anaemia]] may develop in several ways: iron malabsorption may cause [[iron deficiency anaemia]], and [[folic acid]] and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] malabsorption may give rise to [[megaloblastic anemia|megaloblastic anaemia]].
* [[Calcium in biology|Calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] malabsorption (and compensatory secondary [[hyperparathyroidism]]) may cause [[osteopenia]] (decreased mineral content of the bone) or [[osteoporosis]] (bone weakening and risk of fragility fractures).
* A small proportion have abnormal [[coagulation]] due to [[vitamin K deficiency]] and are slightly at risk for abnormal bleeding.
* Coeliac disease is also associated with [[small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome|bacterial overgrowth]] of the [[small intestine]], which can worsen malabsorption or cause malabsorption despite adherence to treatment.<ref name=Tursi>{{Cite journal| author = Tursi A, Brandimarte G, Giorgetti G | title = High prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in celiac patients with persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms after gluten withdrawal | journal = Am J Gastroenterol | volume = 98 | issue = 4 | pages = 839–43 | year = 2003 | pmid=12738465 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2003.07379.x}}</ref>

===Miscellaneous===
Coeliac disease has been linked with a number of conditions. In many cases, it is unclear whether the gluten-induced bowel disease is a causative factor or whether these conditions share a common predisposition.
* [[IgA deficiency]] is present in 2.3% of people with coeliac disease, and in turn this condition features a tenfold increased risk of coeliac disease. Other features of this condition are an increased risk of infections and [[autoimmune disease]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cunningham-Rundles C |title=Physiology of IgA and IgA deficiency |journal=J.

* [[Dermatitis herpetiformis]]; this itchy cutaneous condition has been linked to a transglutaminase enzyme in the skin, features small-bowel changes identical to those in coeliac disease, and may respond to gluten withdrawal even if there are no gastrointestinal symptoms.<ref name=Marks>{{Cite journal| author = Marks J, Shuster S, Watson A | title = Small-bowel changes in dermatitis herpetiformis | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 7476 | pages = 1280–2 | year = 1966 | pmid=4163419 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(66)91692-8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Nicolas ME, Krause PK, Gibson LE, Murray JA |title=Dermatitis herpetiformis |journal=Int.

* Abnormal [[liver function test]]s (randomly detected on blood tests).<ref name=Lancet/>

Coeliac disease is associated with a number of other medical conditions, many of which are [[autoimmune disorder]]s: [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], [[thyroiditis|autoimmune thyroiditis]],<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Collin P, Kaukinen K, Välimäki M, Salmi J | title = Endocrinological disorders and celiac disease | journal = Endocr Rev | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 464–83 | year = 2002 | url = http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/23/4/464 |pmid=12202461 | doi = 10.1210/er.2001-0035}}</ref> [[primary biliary cirrhosis]], and [[microscopic colitis]].<ref name=NICEcoeliac>{{NICE|86|Recognition and assessment of coeliac disease|2009}}</ref>

A more controversial area is a group of diseases in which antigliadin antibodies (an older and nonspecific test for coeliac disease) are sometimes detected but no small bowel disease can be demonstrated. Sometimes these conditions improve by removing gluten from the diet. This includes [[cerebellar ataxia]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[autism spectrum|autism]].<ref name=Schuppan>{{Cite journal|author=Schuppan D, Junker Y, Barisani D |title=Celiac disease: from pathogenesis to novel therapies |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=137 |issue=6 |pages=1912–33 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19766641 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2009.09.008 |url=http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/PIIS001650850901600X/fulltext}}</ref>

==Cause==
Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to [[gliadin]], a [[prolamin]] ([[gluten]] protein) found in wheat, and similar proteins found in the crops of the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Triticeae]] (which includes other common grains such as [[barley]] and [[rye]]).<ref name="Lancet">{{Cite journal|author=Di Sabatino A, Corazza GR |title=Coeliac disease |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9673 |pages=1480–93 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19394538 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60254-3}}</ref>

===Other grains===
Wheat subspecies (such as [[spelt]], [[semolina]] and [[durum]]) and related species (such as [[barley]], [[rye]], [[triticale]] and [[Kamut]]) also induce symptoms of coeliac disease.<ref name=Kupper>{{Cite journal| author = Kupper C | title = Dietary guidelines and implementation for celiac disease | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 128 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S121–7 | year = 2005 | pmid=15825119 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.02.024}}</ref> A small minority of people with coeliac also react to [[oats]].<ref name=Lancet/> It is most probable that oats produce symptoms due to cross-contamination with other grains in the fields or in the distribution channels. Therefore, oats are generally not recommended. However, many companies assure the 'purity' of oats and are therefore still able to be consumed through these sources.<ref name=Kupper/>

Other cereals such as maize (corn), [[millet]], [[sorghum]], [[teff]], rice, and [[wild rice]] are safe for people with coeliac to consume, as well as noncereals such as [[amaranth]], [[quinoa]], and [[buckwheat]].<ref name=Kupper/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Eimear|title=Gluten-free Food Science and Technology |publisher=Published by John Wiley and Sons, |year=2009|pages=320|isbn=1-4051-5915-4, 9781405159159|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405159154.html}}</ref> Noncereal carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes and bananas do not contain gluten and do not trigger symptoms.<ref name=Kupper/>

===Risk modifiers===
There are various theories as to what determines whether a genetically susceptible individual will go on to develop coeliac disease. Major theories include infection by [[rotavirus]]<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Stene L, Honeyman M, Hoffenberg E, Haas J, Sokol R, Emery L, Taki I, Norris J, Erlich H, Eisenbarth G, Rewers M |title=Rotavirus infection frequency and risk of celiac disease autoimmunity in early childhood: a longitudinal study |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |volume=101 |issue=10 |pages=2333–40 |year=2006 |pmid=17032199| doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00741.x}}</ref> or human intestinal [[adenovirus]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Kagnoff M, Paterson Y, Kumar P, Kasarda D, Carbone F, Unsworth D, Austin R | title = Evidence for the role of a human intestinal adenovirus in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease | journal = Gut | volume = 28 | issue = 8 | pages = 995–1001 | year = 1987 | pmid=2822550|url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/28/8/995|format=PDF | doi = 10.1136/gut.28.8.995 | pmc=1433141}}</ref> Some research has suggested that smoking is protective against adult-onset coeliac disease.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Suman S, Williams E, Thomas P, Surgenor S, Snook J | title = Is the risk of adult coeliac disease causally related to cigarette exposure? | journal = Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 995–1000 | year = 2003 | pmid=12923372 | doi = 10.1097/00042737-200309000-00009}}</ref>

A 2005 prospective and [[observational study]] found that timing of the exposure to gluten in childhood was an important risk modifier. People exposed to wheat, barley, or rye before the [[Gut flora|gut barrier]] has fully developed (within the first three months after birth) had five times the risk of developing coeliac disease relative to those exposed four to six months after birth. Those exposed even later than six months after birth were found to have only a slightly increased risk relative to those exposed at four to six months after birth.<ref name="Norris">{{Cite journal|author= Norris JM, Barriga K, Hoffenberg EJ, Taki I, Miao D, Haas JE, Emery LM, Sokol RJ, Erlich HA, Eisenbarth GS, Rewers M.|title=Risk of celiac disease autoimmunity and timing of gluten introduction in the diet of infants at increased risk of disease | journal=JAMA | year=2005| volume=293 | issue=19| pages=2343–2351 | pmid=15900004 | url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/293/19/2343|doi=10.1001/jama.293.19.2343}}</ref>

A study conducted in 2006 showed that early introduction of grains was protective against grain allergies; however, this study explicitly excluded any participants found to have coeliac disease and therefore offers no help in this regard.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Poole J, Barriga K, Leung D, Hoffman M, Eisenbarth G, Rewers M, Norris J |title=Timing of initial exposure to cereal grains and the risk of wheat allergy |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=6 |pages=2175–82 |year=2006 |pmid=16740862 | url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/6/2175 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1803}}</ref> Breastfeeding may also reduce risk. A [[meta-analysis]] indicates that prolonging [[breastfeeding]] until the introduction of gluten-containing grains into the diet was associated with a 52% reduced risk of developing coeliac disease in infancy; whether this persists into adulthood is not clear.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Akobeng A, Ramanan A, Buchan I, Heller R |title=Effect of breast feeding on risk of coeliac disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies |journal=Arch Dis Child |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 |year=2006 |pmid=16287899| url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/91/1/39 |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.082016 |pmc=2083075}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Coeliac disease appears to be polyfactorial, both in that more than one genetic factor can cause the disease and that more than one factor is necessary for the disease to manifest in a person.

Almost all people with coeliac disease have either the variant [[HLA-DQ2]] [[allele]] or (less commonly) the [[HLA-DQ8]] [[allele]].<ref name=VanHeelWest/> However, about 20–30% of people without coeliac disease have also inherited either of these alleles.<ref name="pmid17785484"/> This suggests additional factors are needed for coeliac disease to develop; that is, the predisposing HLA risk allele is necessary but not sufficient to develop coeliac disease. Furthermore, around 5% of those people who do develop coeliac disease do not have typical HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles (see below).<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

The vast majority of people with coeliac have one of two types of the [[HLA-DQ]] protein.<ref name="pmid17785484">{{Cite journal|author=Hadithi M, von Blomberg BM, Crusius JB, ''et al.'' |title=Accuracy of serologic tests and HLA-DQ typing for diagnosing celiac disease |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=147 |issue=5 |pages=294–302 |year=2007 |pmid=17785484 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/147/5/294}}</ref> HLA-DQ is part of the [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC class II antigen-presenting receptor]] (also called the [[human leukocyte antigen]]) system and distinguishes cells between self and non-self for the purposes of the [[immune system]]. The two subunits of the HLA-DQ protein are encoded by the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, located on the short arm of the [[Chromosome 6 (human)|sixth chromosome]].

There are seven [[HLA-DQ]] variants (DQ2 and DQ4–DQ9). Over 95% of people with coeliac have the isoform of DQ2 or DQ8, which is inherited in families. The reason these genes produce an increase in risk of coeliac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to [[gliadin]] peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen-presenting receptor. Therefore, these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] and initiate the autoimmune process.<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

Most people with coeliac bear a two-gene HLA-DQ2 [[haplotype]] referred to as [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5|DQ2.5 haplotype]]. This haplotype is composed of two adjacent gene [[allele]]s, DQA1*0501 and [[HLA-DQ2#DQB1.2A0201|DQB1*0201]], which encode the two subunits, DQ α<sup>5</sup> and DQ β<sup>2</sup>. In most individuals, this DQ2.5 isoform is encoded by one of two [[Chromosome 6 (human)|chromosomes 6]] inherited from parents (DQ2.5cis). Most coeliacs inherit only one copy of this DQ2.5 haplotype, while some inherit it from ''both'' parents; the latter are especially at risk for coeliac disease as well as being more susceptible to severe complications.<ref name="pmid17190762">{{Cite journal| author = Jores RD, Frau F, Cucca F, ''et al.'' | title = HLA-DQB1*0201 homozygosis predisposes to severe intestinal damage in celiac disease | journal = Scand.

Some individuals inherit DQ2.5 from one parent and an additional portion of the haplotype (either DQB1*02 or DQA1*05) from the other parent, increasing risk. Less commonly, some individuals inherit the DQA1*05 allele from one parent and the DQB1*02 from the other parent (DQ2.5trans) (called a trans-haplotype association), and these individuals are at similar risk for coeliac disease as those with a single DQ2.5-bearing chromosome 6, but in this instance disease tends not to be familial. Among the 6% of European coeliacs that do not have DQ2.5 (cis or trans) or DQ8 (encoded by the [[haplotype]] DQA1*03:DQB1*0302), 4% have the [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.2 and gluten|DQ2.2]] isoform, and the remaining 2% lack DQ2 or DQ8.<ref name="pmid12651074">{{Cite journal|author=Karell K, Louka AS, Moodie SJ, ''et al.'' |title=HLA types in celiac disease patients not carrying the DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (DQ2) heterodimer: results from the European Genetics Cluster on Celiac Disease |journal=Hum.

The prevalence of CD genotypes in the modern population is not completely understood. Given the characteristics of the disease and its apparent strong heritability, it would normally be expected that the genotypes would undergo negative selection and to be absent in societies where agriculture has been practised the longest (compare with a similar condition, [[Lactose intolerance]], which has been negatively selected so strongly that its prevalence went from ~100% in ancestral populations to less than 5% in some European countries). This expectation was first proposed by Simoons (1981).<ref>{{cite book|title=Food, nutrition, and evolution: food as an environmental factor in the genesis of human variability|author=Dwain N. Walcher, Norman Kretchmer|pages=179–199}}</ref> By now, however, it is apparent that this is not the case; on the contrary, there is evidence of ''positive'' selection in CD genotypes.

===Prolamins===
The majority of the proteins in food responsible for the immune reaction in coeliac disease are the [[prolamin]]s. These are storage proteins rich in [[proline]] (''prol-'') and [[glutamine]] (''-amin'') that dissolve in alcohols and are resistant to [[protease]]s and [[peptidase]]s of the gut.<ref name=VanHeelWest/><ref name="pmid17960014">{{Cite journal|author=Green PH, Cellier C |title=Celiac disease |journal=N.

Membrane leaking permits peptides of gliadin that stimulate two levels of immune response, the innate response and the adaptive (T-helper cell mediated) response. One protease-resistant peptide from α-gliadin contains a region that stimulates lymphocytes and results in the release of [[interleukin-15]]. This [[Gluten immunochemistry#Innate immunity|innate response to gliadin]] results in immune-system signalling that attracts inflammatory cells and increases the release of inflammatory chemicals.<ref name=VanHeelWest/> The strongest and most common adaptive response to gliadin is directed toward an [[Gluten immunochemistry#A2-gliadin|α2-gliadin fragment]] of 33&nbsp;amino acids in length.<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

The response to the 33mer occurs in most coeliacs who have [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5 and gluten|a DQ2]] [[wikt:isoform|isoform]]. This peptide, when altered by intestinal transglutaminase, has a high density of overlapping T-cell epitopes. This increases the likelihood that the DQ2 isoform will bind and stay bound to peptide when recognised by T-cells.<ref name="pmid15265905"/> Gliadin in wheat is the best-understood member of this family, but other prolamins exist, and [[hordein]] (from barley) and [[secalin]] (from rye) may contribute to coeliac disease.<ref name=VanHeelWest/><ref name="pmid16212427">{{Cite journal|author=Shan L, Qiao SW, Arentz-Hansen H, ''et al.'' |title=Identification and analysis of multivalent proteolytically resistant peptides from gluten: implications for celiac sprue |journal=J.

Deamidation is the reaction by which a glutamate residue is formed by cleavage of the epsilon-amino group of a glutamine side chain. Transamidation, which occurs three times more often than deamidation, is the cross-linking of a glutamine residue from the gliadin peptide to a lysine residue of tTg in a reaction which is catalysed by the transglutaminase. Crosslinking may occur either within or outside the active site of the enzyme. The latter case yields a permanently covalently linked complex between the gliadin and the tTg.<ref name=Fleckenstein>{{cite journal

Antibodies to VP7 may also slow healing until the gliadin-mediated tTG presentation provides a second source of crossreactive antibodies.

===Villous atrophy and malabsorption===
The inflammatory process, mediated by [[T cell]]s, leads to disruption of the structure and function of the small bowel's mucosal lining and causes [[malabsorption]] as it impairs the body's ability to absorb [[nutrient]]s, minerals and fat-soluble [[vitamin]]s A, D, E and K from food. [[Lactose intolerance]] may be present due to the decreased bowel surface and reduced production of [[lactase]] but typically resolves once the condition is treated.

Alternative causes of this tissue damage have been proposed and involve release of [[interleukin 15]] and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide (p31–43/49). This would trigger killing of [[enterocyte]]s by lymphocytes in the [[epithelium]].<ref name=VanHeelWest/> The villous atrophy seen on biopsy may also be due to unrelated causes, such as [[tropical sprue]], [[giardiasis]] and [[radiation enteritis]]. While positive serology and typical biopsy are highly suggestive of coeliac disease, lack of response to diet may require these alternative diagnoses to be considered.<ref name=AGA/>

==Diagnosis==
There are several tests that can be used to assist in [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. The level of [[symptom]]s may determine the order of the tests, but ''all'' tests lose their usefulness if the person is already eating a [[gluten-free diet]]. [[Small intestine|Intestinal]] damage begins to heal within weeks of gluten being removed from the diet, and [[antibody]] levels decline over months. For those who have already started on a gluten-free diet, it may be necessary to perform a rechallenge with some gluten-containing food in one meal a day over 6 weeks before repeating the investigations.<ref name=NICEcoeliac/>

Combining findings into a prediction rule to guide use of [[endoscopic]] biopsy reported a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 100% (it would identify all the cases) in a population of subjects with a high index of suspicion for coeliac disease, with a concomitant [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 61% (a [[false positive]] rate of 39%). The prediction rule recommends that people with high-risk symptoms ''or'' positive serology should undergo endoscopic biopsy of the second part of the duodenum. The study defined high-risk symptoms as [[weight loss]], [[anaemia]] ([[haemoglobin]] less than 120&nbsp;g/l in females or less than 130&nbsp;g/l in males), or diarrhoea (more than three loose stools per day).<ref name="pmmid17383983">{{Cite journal|author=Hopper A, Cross S, Hurlstone D, McAlindon M, Lobo A, Hadjivassiliou M, Sloan M, Dixon S, Sanders D |title=Pre-endoscopy serological testing for coeliac disease: evaluation of a clinical decision tool |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue= 7596|pages=729 |year=2007 | url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7596/729 | pmid=17383983 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39133.668681.BE | pmc=1847864}}</ref>

===Endoscopy===

An [[upper endoscopy]] with [[biopsy]] of the [[duodenum]] (beyond the [[duodenal bulb]]) or [[jejunum]] is performed. It is important for the physician to obtain multiple samples (four to eight) from the duodenum. Not all areas may be equally affected; if biopsies are taken from healthy bowel tissue, the result would be a false negative.<ref name=AGA/>

Most people with coeliac disease have a [[small bowel]] that appears normal on endoscopy; however, five concurrent endoscopic findings have been associated with a high specificity for coeliac disease: scalloping of the small bowel folds (''pictured''), paucity in the folds, a [[mosaic]] pattern to the [[mucosa]] (described as a "cracked-mud" appearance), prominence of the [[submucosa]] [[blood vessel]]s, and a nodular pattern to the mucosa.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Niveloni S, Fiorini A, Dezi R, Pedreira S, Smecuol E, Vazquez H, Cabanne A, Boerr LA, Valero J, Kogan Z, Maurino E, Bai JC. | title = Usefulness of videoduodenoscopy and vital dye staining as indicators of mucosal atrophy of celiac disease: assessment of interobserver agreement | journal = Gastrointestinal Endoscopy | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 223–229 | year = 1998 | pmid=9580349 | doi = 10.1016/S0016-5107(98)70317-7}}</ref>

Until the 1970s, biopsies were obtained using metal capsules attached to a suction device. The capsule was swallowed and allowed to pass into the small intestine. After [[x-ray]] verification of its position, suction was applied to collect part of the intestinal wall inside the capsule. Often-utilised capsule systems were the [[Watson capsule]] and the [[Crosby-Kugler capsule]]. This method has now been largely replaced by [[fibre-optic]] endoscopy, which carries a higher sensitivity and a lower frequency of errors.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mee A, Burke M, Vallon A, Newman J, Cotton P |title=Small bowel biopsy for malabsorption: comparison of the diagnostic adequacy of endoscopic forceps and capsule biopsy specimens |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=291 |issue=6498 |pages=769–72 |year=1985 |pmid=3929934 | pmc=1417146 |doi=10.1136/bmj.291.6498.769}}</ref>

===Pathology===
The classic pathology changes of coeliac disease in the small bowel are categorised by the "Marsh classification":<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Marsh M | title = Gluten, major histocompatibility complex, and the small intestine.

* Marsh stage 2: proliferation of the [[crypts of Lieberkuhn]]
* Marsh stage 3: partial or complete [[intestinal villus|villous]] [[atrophy]]
* Marsh stage 4: [[hypoplasia]] of the [[small bowel]] architecture

The changes classically improve or reverse after [[gluten]] is removed from the diet. However, most guidelines do not recommend a repeat biopsy unless there is no improvement in the symptoms on diet.<ref name=AGA/><ref name=NASPGHAN/> In some cases, a deliberate gluten challenge, followed by biopsy, may be conducted to confirm or refute the diagnosis. A normal biopsy and normal serology after challenge indicates the diagnosis may have been incorrect.<ref name=AGA/>

At the time of diagnosis, further investigations may be performed to identify complications, such as [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] (by [[full blood count]] and iron studies), [[folic acid]] and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] deficiency and [[hypocalcaemia]] (low calcium levels, often due to decreased [[vitamin D]] levels). [[Thyroid function test]]s may be requested during blood tests to identify [[hypothyroidism]], which is more common in people with coeliac disease.<ref name=AFP/>

[[Osteopenia]] and [[osteoporosis]], mildly and severely reduced bone mineral density, are often present in people with coeliac disease, and investigations to measure bone density may be performed at diagnosis, such as [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DXA) scanning, to identify risk of fracture and need for bone protection medication.<ref name=AGA/><ref name=AFP/>

==Screening==
Due to its high sensitivity, [[serology]] has been proposed as a [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] measure, because the presence of antibodies would detect previously undiagnosed cases of coeliac disease and prevent its complications in those people.<ref name=AGA/> There is significant debate as to the benefits of screening. Some studies suggest that early detection would decrease the risk of osteoporosis and anaemia. In contrast, a [[cohort study]] in [[Cambridge]] suggested that people with undetected coeliac disease had a beneficial risk profile for [[cardiovascular disease]] (less [[overweight]], lower [[cholesterol]] levels).<ref name=VanHeelWest/> There is limited evidence that screen-detected cases benefit from a diagnosis in terms of morbidity and mortality; hence, population-level screening is not presently thought to be beneficial.<ref name=Lancet/>

In the United Kingdom, the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) recommends screening for coeliac disease in people with newly diagnosed [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]<ref>{{NICE|53|Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis|2007}}</ref> and [[irritable bowel syndrome]],<ref name=NICEIBS/> as well as in type 1 diabetics, especially those with insufficient weight gain or unexplained weight loss.<ref name=NICEcoeliac/><ref>{{NICE|15|Diagnosis and management of type 1 diabetes in children, young people and adults|2004}}</ref> It is also recommended in [[Autoimmune thyroiditis|autoimmune thyroid disease]], [[dermatitis herpetiformis]], and in the first-degree relatives of those with confirmed coeliac disease.<ref name=NICEcoeliac/>

There is a large number of scenarios where testing for coeliac disease may be offered given previously described associations, such as the conditions mentioned above in "[[#Miscellaneous|miscellaneous]]".<ref name=Lancet/><ref name=NICEcoeliac/>

==Treatment==
===Diet===
{{Main|Gluten-free diet}}

At present, the only effective treatment is a lifelong [[gluten-free diet]].<ref name=Kupper/> No medication exists that will prevent damage or prevent the body from attacking the gut when gluten is present. Strict adherence to the diet allows the intestines to heal, leading to resolution of all symptoms in most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun, can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer and in some cases sterility.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Treem W | title = Emerging concepts in celiac disease | journal = Curr Opin Pediatr | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 552–9 | year = 2004| pmid=15367850 | doi=10.1097/01.mop.0000142347.74135.73}}</ref> [[Dietitian]] input is generally requested to ensure the person is aware which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and how to have a balanced diet despite the limitations. In many countries, gluten-free products are available on [[Medical prescription|prescription]] and may be reimbursed by [[health insurance]] plans.

The diet can be cumbersome; failure to comply with the diet may cause relapse. The term ''gluten-free'' is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence.<ref name=Akobeng2008>{{Cite journal|author=Akobeng AK, Thomas AG |title=Systematic review: tolerable amount of gluten for people with coeliac disease |journal=Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=1044–52 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18315587 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03669.x}}</ref> The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial. A recent [[systematic review]] tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10&nbsp;mg of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been done.<ref name=Akobeng2008/>

Regulation of the label ''gluten-free'' varies widely by country. In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] issued regulations in 2007 limiting the use of "gluten-free" in food products to those with less than 20 ppm of gluten.<ref>Section 206 of the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, Title II of {{USStatute|108|282|118|891|2004|08|02}}</ref><ref>{{USFR|72|2795}}-2817</ref> The current international [[Codex Alimentarius]] standard allows for 20 ppm of gluten in so-called "gluten-free" foods.<ref name=CodexOfficial>{{Cite web| publisher = FAO/WHO | title = Current Official Standards | url = http://www.codexalimentarius.net/web/standard_list.jsp | accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref> Gluten-free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten-containing foods.<ref name=economicburden>{{Cite journal|author=Lee AR, Ng DL, Zivin J, Green PH |title=Economic burden of a gluten-free diet |journal=J Hum Nutr Diet |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=423–30 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17845376 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-277X.2007.00763.x |url=}}</ref> Since ready-made products often contain traces of gluten, some coeliacs may find it necessary to cook from scratch.<ref name=Troncone2008>{{Cite journal|author=Troncone R, Ivarsson A, Szajewska H, Mearin ML |title=Review article: future research on coeliac disease – a position report from the European multistakeholder platform on coeliac disease (CDEUSSA) |journal=Aliment.

Even while on a diet, health-related [[quality of life]] (HRQOL) may be lower in people with coeliac disease.

===Refractory disease===
A tiny minority of people suffer from refractory disease, which means they do not improve on a gluten-free diet. This may be because the disease has been present for so long that the intestines are no longer able to heal on diet alone, or because the person is not adhering to the diet, or because the person is consuming foods that are inadvertently contaminated with gluten. If alternative causes have been eliminated, [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] or [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressants]] (such as [[azathioprine]]) may be considered in this scenario.<ref name=AGA/>

==Epidemiology==

==Social and culture==
===Christian churches & the Eucharist===
Speaking generally, the various denominations of Christians celebrate a [[Eucharist]] in which a wafer or small piece of wheat bread is blessed and then eaten (see [[Sacramental bread]]). A typical wafer weighs about half a gram.<ref>[http://www.eden.co.uk/shop/peoples-alter-breads-single-cross-sealed-edge-white-125972.html One on-line site sells 1200 wafers weighing a total of 523 g]</ref> [[Wheat flour]] contains around 10 to 13% gluten, so a single communion wafer may have more than 50&nbsp;mg of gluten, an amount which will harm the health of many people with coeliac especially if consumed every day (see Diet above).
Many Christian churches offer their communicants gluten-free alternatives, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread. These include the Catholic Church, [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]], [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also offers gluten-free alternatives to its communicants.<ref>Jax Peter Lowell, [http://books.google.com/books?id=IRhm1A2_EkkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0 ''The Gluten-Free Bible''], p. 279.</ref>

===Roman Catholic position===
Roman Catholic [[doctrine]] states that for a valid [[Eucharist]], the bread to be used at Mass must be made from wheat. In 2002, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] approved German-made low-gluten [[Host (Holy Communion)|hosts]], which meets all of the Catholic Church's requirements, for use in Italy; although not entirely gluten-free, they were also approved by the Italian Celiac Association.<ref>{{Cite web| author = Scott Adams |url = http://www.celiac.com/st_prod.html?p_prodid=696 | title = Bishops in Italy Approve a German-made Low Gluten Eucharistic Host | date = 2 August 2002 | publisher = Celiac.com}}</ref> Some Catholic coeliac sufferers have requested permission to use rice wafers; such petitions have always been denied.<ref>{{Cite news| author = Associated Press |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5762478/ |title = Girl with digestive disease denied Communion | work = MSNBC |publisher = Microsoft | date = 8 December 2004 |accessdate =30 May 2006}}</ref>

The issue is more complex for priests. Though a Catholic (lay or ordained) receiving the [[Eucharist]] under either form (bread or wine) is receiving Christ "whole and entire"—his body, blood, soul, and divinity—the priest, who is acting ''[[in persona Christi]]'', is required to receive under both species when offering Mass—not for the validity of his Communion, but for the fullness of the sacrifice of the Mass. On 24 July 2003, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] stated, "Given the centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest, one must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those candidates unable to ingest gluten or alcohol without serious harm."<ref>[[Pope Benedict XVI|Ratzinger, Joseph]] (24 July 2003).

===Passover===
The Jewish festival of [[Passover|Pesach]] (Passover) may present problems with its obligation to eat [[matzo]], which is unleavened bread made in a strictly controlled manner from wheat, barley, [[spelt]], oats, or rye. This rules out many other grains that are normally used as substitutes for people with gluten sensitivity, especially for [[Ashkenazi Jews]], who also avoid rice. Many kosher-for-Passover products avoid grains altogether and are therefore gluten-free. [[Potato starch]] is the primary starch used to replace the grains. Consuming [[matzo]] is mandatory on the first night of Pesach only. Jewish law holds that one should not seriously endanger one's health in order to fulfil a commandment. Thus, a person with severe coeliac disease is not allowed, let alone required, to eat any matzo other than gluten-free matzo. The most commonly used gluten-free matzo is made from oats.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://oukosher.org/index.php/articles/single/gluten_intolerance_celiac_allergies_and_pesach/ | title = Gluten Intolerance, Celiac, Allergies And Pesach | accessdate =3 September 2006 | author = Rabbi Avraham Juravel | publisher = Orthodox Union }}</ref>

==Research directions==
Various other approaches are being studied that would reduce the need of dieting. All are still under development, and are not expected to be available to the general public for a while.<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

Using [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] wheat species, or wheat species that have been [[plant breeding|selectively bred]] to be minimally immunogenic, may allow the consumption of wheat. This, however, could interfere with the effects that gliadin has on the quality of dough. Alternatively, gluten exposure can be minimised by the ingestion a combination of [[enzyme]]s ([[prolyl endopeptidase]] and a barley glutamine-specific [[cysteine endopeptidase]] ([[EP-B2]])) that degrade the putative 33-mer peptide in the [[duodenum]].<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

Alternative treatments under investigation include the inhibition of [[zonulin]], an endogenous signalling protein linked to increased permeability of the bowel wall and hence increased presentation of gliadin to the immune system, and other modifiers of other well-understood steps in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, such as the action of HLA-DQ2 or tissue transglutaminase and the MICA/NKG2D interaction that may be involved in the killing of enterocytes.<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

==History==
Humans first started to cultivate grains in the [[Neolithic]] period (beginning about 9500 BCE) in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in Western Asia, and it is likely that coeliac disease did not occur before this time. [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]], living in the second century in the same area, recorded a malabsorptive syndrome with chronic diarrhoea. His "Cœliac Affection" (''coeliac'' from Greek κοιλιακός ''koiliakos'', "abdominal") gained the attention of Western medicine when [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]] presented a translation of Aretaeus's work at the Sydenham Society in 1856. The patient described in Aretaeus' work had stomach pain and was atrophied, pale, feeble and incapable of work. The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white, malodorous and flatulent, and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return. The problem, Aretaeus believed, was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body, this incomplete digestion resulting in the diarrhoea. He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women, explicitly excluding children. The cause, according to Aretaeus, was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming "a copious draught of cold water."<ref name="Aretaeus"/><ref name=Losowsky/>

The [[paediatrics|paediatrician]] [[Samuel Gee]] gave the first modern-day description of the condition in children in a lecture at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street]], London, in 1887. Gee acknowledged earlier descriptions and terms for the disease and adopted the same term as Aretaeus (coeliac disease). He perceptively stated: "If the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet." Gee recognised that milk intolerance is a problem with coeliac children and that highly starched foods should be avoided. However, he forbade rice, sago, fruit and vegetables, which all would have been safe to eat, and he recommended raw meat as well as thin slices of toasted bread. Gee highlighted particular success with a child "who was fed upon a quart of the best Dutch [[mussel]]s daily." However, the child could not bear this diet for more than one season.<ref name=Losowsky/><ref>{{Cite journal| last = Gee | first = SJ | year = 1888 | title = On the coeliac affection | journal = St Bartholomew's Hospital Report | volume = 24 | pages = 17–20 | url = http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=epo0466&p=1&do=page}}</ref>

[[Christian Archibald Herter (physician)|Christian Archibald Herter]], an American physician, wrote a book in 1908 on children with coeliac disease, which he called "intestinal [[infantilism (disorder)|infantilism]]." He noted their growth was retarded and that fat was better tolerated than carbohydrate. The [[eponym]] ''Gee-Herter disease'' was sometimes used to acknowledge both contributions.<ref name=Herter1908>{{Cite book| last = Herter | first = CA | year = 1908 | title = On infantilism from chronic intestinal infection; characterized by the overgrowth and persistence of flora in the nursing period | publisher = Macmillan & Co | location = New York}} as cited by WhoNamedIt</ref><ref name=whoNamedItHerter>{{Cite web| url = http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1490.html | title = Christian Archibald Herter | accessdate =20 March 2007 | author = Ole Daniel Enersen | publisher = Who Named It?}}</ref> [[Sidney V.

While a role for carbohydrates had been suspected, the link with wheat was not made until the 1940s by the Dutch paediatrician Dr. [[Willem Karel Dicke]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author = van Berge-Henegouwen G, Mulder C | title = Pioneer in the gluten free diet: Willem-Karel Dicke 1905–1962, over 50 years of gluten free diet | journal = Gut | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 1473–5 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8244125 | url= http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/34/11/1473 | format=PDF | doi = 10.1136/gut.34.11.1473 | pmc=1374403}}</ref> It is likely that clinical improvement of his patients during the [[Dutch famine of 1944]] (during which flour was scarce) may have contributed to his discovery.<ref>{{Cite book| author=Dicke WK | title=Coeliakie: een onderzoek naar de nadelige invloed van sommige graansoorten op de lijder aan coeliakie, PhD thesis | language=Dutch | location=Utrecht, the Netherlands | publisher=University of Utrecht | year=1950}}</ref> Dicke noticed that the shortage of bread led to a significant drop in the death rate among children affected by CD from greater than 35% to essentially zero.
