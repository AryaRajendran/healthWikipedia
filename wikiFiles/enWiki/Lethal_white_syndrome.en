'''Lethal white syndrome''' ('''LWS'''), also called '''[[overo]] lethal white syndrome (OLWS)'', ''lethal white overo''' ('''LWO'''), and '''overo lethal white foal syndrome''' ('''OLWFS'''), is an [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[genetic disorder]] most prevalent in the [[American Paint Horse]]. Affected [[foal]]s are born after the full 11-month [[gestation]] and externally appear normal, though they have all-white or nearly all-white coats and blue eyes. However, internally, these foals have a nonfunctioning [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].  Within a few hours, signs of [[Horse colic|colic]] appear and affected foals die within a few days.  Because the death is often painful, such foals often are humanely [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] once identified.  The disease is particularly devastating because foals are born seemingly healthy after being carried to full term.<ref name=apha>{{cite web

The disease has a similar [[etiology]] to [[Hirschsprung's disease]] in humans.  A mutation in the middle of the [[endothelin receptor type B]] (EDNRB) [[gene]] causes lethal white syndrome when [[homozygous]]. Carriers, who are [[heterozygous]], that is, have one copy of the mutated [[allele]], but themselves are healthy, can now be reliably identified with a [[DNA test]].  Both parents must be carriers of one copy of the LWS allele in order for an affected foal to be born.

Horses that are heterozygous for the gene that causes lethal white syndrome often exhibit a spotted [[equine coat color|coat color pattern]] commonly known as "frame" or "frame overo."   Coat color alone does not always indicate the presence of LWS or carrier status, however.  The frame pattern may be minimally expressed or masked by other spotting patterns.  There also are different genetic mechanisms which produce healthy [[White (horse)|white]] foals and have no connection to LWS; another reason for genetic testing of potential breeding stock.  Though there is no treatment or cure for LWS foals, a white foal without LWS that appears ill may have a treatable condition.

==Clinical signs==

==Inheritance and expression==
Genetic conditions which affect more than one physical trait—in the case of Lethal White Syndrome, both pigment cells and [[enteric]] [[Neuron|nerve cells]]—are termed [[pleiotropic]]. The unusual instance of pleiotropy in LWS foals suggested early on that the syndrome was related to an important section of embryonic tissue called the [[neural crest]].<ref name=2a/> As the name suggests, the [[stem cell]]s of the neural crest are precursors to [[nerve cells]].  Another cell type that descends from neural crest cells are [[melanocyte]]s, pigment-producing cells found in hair follicles and skin. The migration of nerve- and melanocyte-precursors from the top of the embryo to their eventual destinations is carefully controlled by [[regulatory gene]]s.<ref name=thiruvenkadan2008>{{cite journal |title=Coat colour inheritance in horses |last=Thiruvenkadan |first=AK |coauthors=Kandasamy N, Panneerselvam S |journal=Livestock Science |volume=117 |year=2008 |pages=109–129 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/j.livsci.2008.05.008 |quote=There are many mutations that may affect the migration of the cells from the neural crest...Very many different mutants that affect migration of the cells from neural crest region cause lethal white-spotting condition.

This leads to depigmentation and also lack of neural connections to the colon. |issue=2–3}}</ref>

Such regulatory genes include [[endothelin receptor type B]] (EDNRB). A mutation in the middle of the EDNRB gene, Ile118Lys, causes lethal white syndrome.<ref name=4a/><ref name=19a>{{cite journal |author=Yang GC, Croaker D, Zhang AL, Manglick P, Cartmill T, Cass D |title=A dinucleotide mutation in the endothelin-B receptor gene is associated with lethal white foal syndrome (LWFS); a horse variant of Hirschsprung disease |journal=Hum.

In the case of LWS, a single copy of the EDNRB mutation, the [[heterozygous]] state, produces an identifiable trait, but with a very different outcome from the [[homozygous]] state.<ref name=HTHZ>Metallinos DL, Bowling AT, Rine J (1998).

Seven additional unrelated lethal white foal samples were found to be homozygous for this mutation. No other homozygotes were identified in 138 samples analyzed, suggesting that homozygosity was restricted to lethal white foals. All (40/40) horses with the frame overo pattern (a distinct coat color pattern that is a subset of overo horses) that were tested were heterozygous for this allele, defining a heterozygous coat color phenotype for this mutation."</ref>

===Heterozygotes===
{{main|Overo}}
{{see also|Pinto horse|American Paint Horse|Cropout}}
Horses heterozygous for the Ile118Lys mutation on the equine [[endothelin receptor type B]] gene—carriers of lethal white syndrome—usually exhibit a [[pinto horse|white-spotting]] pattern called "frame", or "frame [[overo]]".<ref name=4a/><ref name=13a/><ref name=5a/><ref name=9a/> Frame is characterized by jagged, sharply defined, horizontally oriented white patches that run horizontally along the horse's neck, shoulder, flank, and hindquarters. The frame pattern by itself does not produce white markings that cross the back, or affect the legs or tail. It does, however, often produce [[horse markings|bald faces]] and blue eyes.<ref name=4a/><ref name=13a/><ref name=5a/> The term "frame" describes the effect of viewing a frame-patterned horse from the side: the white markings appear to be "framed" by a dark-colored border.<ref name=13a/> To date, animals who are heterozygous carriers do not exhibit health concerns associated with carrier-only status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horsetesting.com/LWO.htm |title=Lethal White Overo (LWO)| publisher= Animal Genetics, Inc.| accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref> Natural processes of [[DNA repair]] are likely responsible for weeding out [[EDNRB]] [[protein]]s made from the mutated instructions.

[[Image:Grazing paints.jpg|thumb|right|The two horses on the right exhibit the frame overo pattern.]]

Not all horses with the heterozygous mutation exactly fit the standard visual description. A horse with the Ile118Lys mutation on EDNRB that is not readily identified as frame-patterned is called a ''cryptic frame.''  In addition to cryptic frames, a significant proportion of horses with the frame [[phenotype]] are visually misidentified, even in clinical settings.<ref name=5a/>  One study found from a group of visually inspected registered Paints, 18% of breeding stock solids and 35% of bald-faced horses were actually frames.<ref name=5a/> On the other hand, over one quarter of Paints registered in the "overo" category were not frames, and conversely, 10% of horses registered as tobiano also carried frame genetics.<ref name=5a/><!--need to review source-->  The difficulty in accurately identifying frames has contributed to the accidental breeding of Lethal White Syndrome foals.

Minimally marked horses heterozygous for the Ile118Lys mutation are not uncommon: one DNA-tested [[Thoroughbred]]  has [[horse markings|white markings]] limited to a bottom-heavy blaze and two socks below the knee.<ref name=remarquez>{{cite web |url=http://www.orchardviewsporthorses.net/ |title=Orchard View Sporthorses |accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref> A [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]] mare tested positive for the gene after she and a frame Paint stallion produced a Lethal White Syndrome foal; the mare's markings were a thin blaze with a disconnected white spot in the right nostril, with no other white markings.<ref name=3a/> One major study identified two [[Miniature horse]]s that were completely unmarked, but were positive for the Ile118Lys gene.<ref name=5a/>

There are multiple theories for this. Variability in the percentage of individuals with a specific genotype that express an associated [[phenotype]] is called [[penetrance]], and this may simply be evidence of variable penetrance.<ref name="Metallinos">{{cite journal |author=Metallinos DL, Bowling AT, Rine J |title=A missense mutation in the endothelin-B receptor gene is associated with Lethal White Foal Syndrome: an equine version of Hirschsprung disease |journal=Mamm.

On the other end of the spectrum, some white-spotted horses are so extensively marked that the character of the frame pattern is masked. In particular, the [[tobiano]] pattern, a dominant gene, is [[Epistasis|epistatic]] to overo.<ref name="Metallinos"/> Other white-spotting genes include [[splashed white]] or "splash", [[sabino horse|sabino]], and "calico".<ref name=5a/><!--Never heard of "calico" what is that one??--> Any combination, or all, of these white-spotting genes can act together to produce horses with so much white that the presence of frame cannot be determined without a DNA test.<ref name=BSwhite>Santschi EM, Mickelson JR (2001). 80% of breeding stock white (all-white horses of Paint pedigree) were genotyped N/L for Endothelin Receptor B.</ref>

[[Image:SabinoTestedNegforOLWS.jpg|thumb|left|This horse has irregular white markings, and would be classed by the APHA and PtHA as "overo". However, his markings are caused by a type of [[Sabino horse|sabino]] patterning and he has been DNA tested negative for the OLWS gene.]]

Ambiguous terminology has also contributed to the confusion surrounding this disease. Currently, the [[American Paint Horse Association]] (APHA) categorizes  horses as [[tobiano]], solid, "overo", and [[tovero]].<ref name="Guidebook">{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.com/forms/PDFFiles/guidebooks/07ColorGen.pdf |format=PDF|title='American Paint Horse Association's Guide to Coat Color Genetics| publisher= American Paint Horse Association| year= 2007|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref>  The association breaks down "overo" into three categories:  Frame, [[Splashed white|Splash]] and [[Sabino horse|Sabino]].<ref name="Guidebook"/>  In the past, "overo" was used even more loosely, to refer to spotted animals that were "Paint, but not tobiano".<ref name="Guidebook"/>  However, no fewer than four—and likely many more<!--awk to phrase:  frame (testable), splash (not yet testable), sabino SB-1 (testable) , and all other sabino that are not SB-1 (the not-yet-testable patterning in Clydesdales and Arabians, sometimes called splash, but not the same as "splash overo" in APHA-->--genetically distinct patterns are included under the term "overo".<ref name=5a/><ref name=15a/><ref name=7a>{{cite news |first=Paul D. |last=Vrotsos |coauthors=Elizabeth M. Santschi |title=Stalking the Lethal White Syndrome |url=http://www.apha.com/breed/lethalwhites03.html |work=Paint Horse Journal |publisher=American Paint Horse Association |date=1998-07-01 |accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref>  To be categorized as "overo" by the APHA, a horse must fit a written description: white spotting does not cross the back, at least one solid-colored leg, solid tail, face markings, and irregular, scattered, or splashy white patches.<ref name=10a>{{cite web |url=http://www.apha.com/breed/overo.html |title=Overo Pattern |accessdate=2008-09-03 |publisher=American Paint Horse Association}}</ref> To further complicate matters, various Sabino patterns also appear in some horse breeds that do not carry genetics for frame or any other spotting pattern.<ref name="UCDVGL">{{cite web| url=http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php |title=Horse coat color tests|publisher=Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, University of California, Davis|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref>

Likewise, official classification of a horse as an unspotted solid is based not on genetic testing, but on a visual description.  Horses carrying genetics for frame and other white-spotting patterns may be so minimally marked as to lack the registry's minimum requirements for white.<ref name=11a>{{cite web |url=http://www.apha.com/breed/colorreq.html |title=Color Requirements |accessdate=2008-09-03 |publisher=American Paint Horse Association}}</ref> This helps to account for allegedly solid horses producing spotted offspring, called [[cropout]]s.<ref name=13a/>

The long-standing practice of categorizing Paint horses in this manner contributed to the incorporation of the word "overo" into some of the titles used to describe the disease, such as Overo Lethal White Foal Syndrome.<ref name=2a/> However, "overo" is a term that applies to several genetically unrelated white-spotting patterns, and only the frame pattern is indicative of the syndrome.<ref name=13a/><ref name=5a/><ref name=9a/> The confusion about the nature of LWS is then furthered by statements such as "there are many overos that do not carry the lethal allele",<ref name="Guidebook"/><!--p. 16--> which is technically correct, but only because the term "overo" also encompasses splash and sabino patterns as well as frame.<ref name="Guidebook"/><!--p. 1-->

===Homozygotes===
Homozygotes for the Ile118Lys mutation on the equine [[endothelin receptor type B]] gene have lethal white syndrome.<ref name=4a/><ref name=5a/> In any crossing of two carrier parents, there is a 25% statistical probability of producing a solid-colored, living foal; a 50% chance for a frame-patterned, living foal; and a 25% chance of a LWS foal.<ref name=12a/>

[[Image:Yukichan 20080427 001.jpg|thumb|right|This Thoroughbred mare was born pure white with pink skin. Such foals are occasionally born with no apparent white ancestry. This mare does not carry the LWS gene, and her coat is termed "[[dominant white]]".]]

===Producing frame color patterns without producing lethal white===
Spotted coat colors, including frame, are popular and sought after by breeders.<ref name=brooksdissert>{{cite journal   |first=Samantha  | last = Brooks  | title =Studies of Genetic Variation at the ''KIT'' Locus and White Spotting Patterns in the Horse  | publisher = University of Kentucky  | year = 2006  | url = http://archive.uky.edu/handle/10225/564 | format =PDF | accessdate =2010-12-29 |quote=Aside from the scientific benefits of studying coat color in the horse there is a more immediate advantage. People like the look of unusual coat colors, and they are willing to pay for a way to improve their ability to get more of them. The value in a flashy colored horse isn’t as easily measured as that in a fast race horse, but it does translate in to real dollars at the point of sale. For example, the average price of an APHA registered yearling (young horses with undetermined athletic ability) without a spotting pattern on Equine.com was $1540. A yearling APHA registered horse with the tobiano pattern averaged $2803 (Appendix B). This price difference creates an enormous interest among breeders to increase their production of spotted foals.}}</ref>  While many lethal white syndrome foals are accidentally produced when breeders cross two untested cryptic frames, or a known frame and a cryptic frame, some are produced by the intentional breeding of two known frames, whether out of ignorance or indifference.  Producing a foal with lethal white syndrome is now completely avoidable. This is because most major animal genetics labs now offer the DNA test for LWS.  Whether a horse visually appears to have the frame pattern or not, testing horses of frame or "overo" lineage is highly recommended.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The statistic likelihood of producing a living, frame-patterned foal by crossing two frames is 1 in 2, or 50%; the same odds of producing a living, frame-patterned foal from a frame-to-non-frame breeding which carries no risk of producing a lethal white syndrome foal.<ref name=12a/> Therefore, breeding two frame overos conveys no benefit to breeders hoping to produce another frame overo.

===Dominant or recessive?===

The term "[[Genetic carrier|carrier]]", by definition, applies only to recessive conditions. However, if the frame pattern trait is included in the lethal white syndrome, inheritance of the trait follows an [[Autosomal_recessive#Incomplete_dominance|incomplete dominant]] pattern. It should be noted that the concept of "recessive" and "dominant" predate [[molecular biology]] and technically apply only to traits, not to genes themselves.

[[Image:Creamwildponyfilly.jpg|thumb|right|This blue-eyed, pink-skinned, whitish filly is in fact a [[Cream gene|cremello]], and is perfectly healthy. Her skin is a rosier shade and her coat cream-colored, as opposed to stark white.]]
Not all white, blue-eyed foals are affected with lethal white syndrome. Other genes can produce healthy pink-skinned, blue-eyed horses with a white or very light cream-colored coat.<ref name=12a/>  For a time, some of these completely white horses were called "Living Lethals",  but this is a [[misnomer]].  Before reliable information and the [[DNA test]] were available to breeders, perfectly healthy, white-coated, blue-eyed foals were sometimes euthanized for fear they were lethal whites,<ref name=12a/> an outcome which can be avoided today with testing and a better understanding of coat color genetics or even waiting twelve hours or so for the foal to develop symptoms. The availability of testing also allows a breeder to determine if a white-coated, blue-eyed foal that becomes ill is an LWS foal that requires euthanasia or a non-LWS foal with a simple illness that may be successfully treated.
* Double-[[cream gene|cream dilutes]] such as [[cremello]]s, [[perlino]]s, and [[smoky cream]]s, have cream-colored coats, blue eyes and pink skin. The faint cream pigmentation of their coats can be distinguished from the unpigmented white markings and underlying unpigmented pink skin. A similar-looking "pseudo double dilute" can be produced with help from the [[Pearl gene]] or "Barlink factor" or the [[Champagne gene]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
* The combination of [[tobiano]] with other white spotting patterns can produce white or nearly white horses, which may have blue eyes.<ref name=phj>{{cite web

* [[Sabino horse]]s that are [[homozygous]] for the Sabino-1 (Sb-1) gene are often called "Sabino-white", and are all- or nearly all-white.  Not all Sabino horses carry Sb-1.<ref name="UCDVGL"/>
* [[Dominant white]] genetics are not thoroughly understood, but are characterized by all- or nearly all-white coats.

==Analogous conditions==
From very early in research into its genetics,<ref name=2a/> lethal white syndrome has been compared to [[Hirschsprung's disease]] (HSCHR) in humans, which is also caused by mutations on the EDNRB gene. Various [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] on this gene result in intestinal agangliosis, in some cases attended by unusual pigmentation of the skin and eyes, and deafness. The occasionally attendant pigmentation condition in humans is called [[Waardenburg syndrome|Waardenburg-Shah syndrome]].<ref name=4a/>

The terms "piebald-lethal" and "spotting lethal" apply to similar conditions in mice and rats respectively, both caused by mutations on the EDNRB gene.<ref name=17a>{{cite journal | last = Gariepy  | first = CE | coauthors = Cass DT, Yanagisawa M | date = 1996-01-23 | title = Null mutation of endothelin receptor type B gene in spotting lethal rats causes aganglionic megacolon and white coat color.  | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 867–72 | pmid = 8570650 | pmc = 40149  |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8570650 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.2.867 }}</ref><ref name=18a>{{cite journal | last = Hosoda | first = K | coauthors = Hammer RE, Richardson JA, Baynash AG, Cheung JC, Giaid A, Yanagisawa M | date = 1994-12-30 | title = Targeted and natural (piebald-lethal) mutations of endothelin-B receptor gene produce megacolon associated with spotted coat color in mice. | journal = Cell | volume = 79 | issue = 7 | pages = 1267–76  | pmid = 8001159 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(94)90017-5  |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0092-8674(94)90017-5}}</ref> Only lethal in the homozygous state, the mutations are associated with white-spotted coats, deafness, and megacolon caused by intestinal agangliosis.<ref name=4a/>
