{{Violence against women}}
'''Domestic violence in Pakistan''' is an endemic social problem.  According to a study carried out in 2009 by [[Human Rights Watch]], it is estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of women in Pakistan have suffered some form of abuse.<ref name=Gosselin>Cited in: {{cite book|last=Gosselin|first=Denise Kindschi|title=Heavy Hands: An Introduction to the Crime of Intimate and Family Violence|year=2009|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0136139034|edition=4th|page=13}}</ref> An estimated 5000 women are killed per year from domestic violence, with thousands of others maimed or disabled.<ref name=Hansar2 /> The majority of victims of violence have no legal recourse.

Given the very few [[women's shelter]]s in the country, victims have limited ability to escape from violent situations.<ref name=Hansar2>{{cite book|last=Hansar|first=Robert D.|title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415969680|edition=1st|editor=Nicky Ali Jackson|chapter=Cross-Cultural Examination of Domestic Violence in China and Pakistan|page=211}}</ref>

[[Acid throwing|Acid attacks]] in Pakistan came to international attention after the release of a documentary by [[Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy]] called ''[[Saving Face (2012 film)|Saving Face]]'' (2012).<ref name=Rodriguez /> According to Shahnaz Bukhari, the majority of these attacks occur in the summer when acid is used extensively to soak certain seeds [[Seed#Inducing_germination|to induce germination]].<ref name=Ali>{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Sahar|title=Acid attack victim demands justice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3097469.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=July 28, 2003}}</ref> Various reasons have been given for such attacks, such as a woman dressing inappropriately or rejecting a proposal of marriage.

==Factors==
Various factors are associated with domestic violence in Pakistan. Poverty, illiteracy and social taboos are considered the main reasons for domestic violence in the country.<ref name="Dawn: factors 2">{{cite news|title=Poverty, illiteracy termed causes of domestic violence|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2006/03/04/nat41.htm|accessdate=6 September 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=3 March 2006}}</ref> A lack of awareness about women’s rights and a lack of support from the government have been cited as two reasons.<ref name="Dawn: factors">{{cite news|title=Domestic violence|url=http://dawn.com/2012/04/25/domestic-violence-2/|accessdate=6 September 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=25 April 2012}}</ref> Another factor given for the rise in domestic violence has been due to increased [[urbanization]]. As people move from villages and increasingly live apart from an extended family, assaults are less likely to be prevented by the intervention of family members, who in past times often intervened in domestic conflicts.<ref name=Weiss>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Anita M.|title=India and Pakistan: The First Fifty Years|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521645850|editor=Selig S.

==Political response==
In 1976 the Pakistani government passed legislation on dowry and bridal gifts in an attempt to eliminate the custom but, because of cultural and societal norms combined with government ineffectiveness, such killings over inadequate dowries continue.<ref name=Zaman>{{cite book|last=Zaman|first=Habiba|title=Family, Law and Politics: Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: 2|year=2004|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004128187|editor=Suad Joseph, Afsaneh Najmabad|page=124}}</ref> In 1999 the [[Senate of Pakistan]] rejected a resolution which would have condemned the practice of murdering women for the sake of family honour.<ref name="Ajmal 1999-08-25">{{cite news|last=Ajmal|first=Umer Bin|title=World:South Asia Bride burning 'kills hundreds' |newspaper=Dawn|date=25 August 1999}}</ref> The following year, on 21 April 2000, the national government leader [[Pervez Musharraf]] declared that [[Honour killing in Pakistan|honour killings]] were "vigorously condemned" by the government and would be treated as murder.<ref name=UNICEF2>{{cite journal|last=Kapoor|first=Sushma|title=Domestic Violence Against Women and Girls|journal= Innocenti Digest |year=2000| month=June| number=6| page=6| publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre|issn=102-3528 |url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/digest6e.pdf}}</ref>  The Ministry of Women Development set up ten crisis centres to help the victims of domestic violence and raise the awareness level of the people on this issue.<ref name="Shahina Imran">{{cite news|title=Pakistan: Domestic violence endemic, but awareness slowly rising|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/77226/PAKISTAN-Domestic-violence-endemic-but-awareness-slowly-rising|accessdate=4 September 2012|date=11 March 2008|author=Shahina Imran|agency=[[Integrated Regional Information Networks]]|location=Lahore}}</ref> In 2011 the Senate passed the ''Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill'' to repress acid attacks in the country; the senate also passed the prevention of anti-women practices bill.<ref name="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">{{cite book|title=Human Rights and Democracy: The 2011 Foreign and Commonwealth Office Report|year=2012|publisher=TSO|isbn=978-0101833929|page=292}}</ref>

The council argued that the punishments suggested by this bill are already enacted by other laws and suggested lack of action on these laws being the reason for increase in domestic violence.<ref name="Nasir Iqbal">{{cite news|title=Domestic Violence Bill to push up divorce rate: CII|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/41327|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper){{!}}Dawn]]|date=24 August 2009|author=Nasir Iqbal}}</ref> After the passage of [[Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Eighteenth constitutional amendment]], the matter pertaining to the bill became a provincial issue.<ref name="Ayesha Shahid">{{cite news|title=Domestic violence bill gets new look|url=http://dawn.com/2012/04/07/domestic-violencebill-gets-new-look/|accessdate=6 September 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=7 April 2012|author=Ayesha Shahid}}</ref> It was re-tabled in 2012, but met with a deadlock in parliament because of stiff opposition from the [[Islamism|religious right]].
