'''Parental alienation syndrome''' (abbreviated as '''PAS''') is term coined by [[Richard A. Gardner]] in the early 1980s to refer to what he describes as a disorder in which a child, on an ongoing basis, belittles and insults one parent without justification, due to a combination of factors, including indoctrination by the other parent (almost exclusively as part of a child custody dispute) and the child's own attempts to denigrate the target parent.<ref name=Gardner2001>{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=RA |authorlink=Richard A.

==Initial description==
Parental alienation syndrome was a term coined by child psychiatrist [[Richard A. Gardner]] drawing upon his clinical experiences since the early 1980s.<ref name=Gardner2001/> The concept of one parent attempting to separate their child from the other parent as punishment or part of a divorce have been described since at least the 1940s,<ref name=Bernet2008 /><ref name=Warshak2001/> but Gardner was the first to define a specific syndrome. In a 1985 article, he defined PAS as "...a disorder that arises primarily in the context of child-custody disputes. Its primary manifestation is the child's campaign of denigration against the parent, a campaign that has no justification. The disorder results from the combination of indoctrinations by the alienating parent and the child's own contributions to the vilification of the alienated parent"<ref name=Gardner2001/> also stating that the indoctrination may be deliberate or unconscious on the part of the alienating parent.<ref name="Gardner2001b">{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Richard |title=Commentary on Kelly and Johnston's The Alienated Child: A Reformulation of Parental Alienation Syndrome |journal=Family Court Review |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=611–21 |year=2004 |format=pdf |url= http://coleur.googlepages.com/GardnerrRichardACommentaryonKellyand.pdf |doi=10.1177/1531244504268711}}</ref><ref name="Baker2007"/> PAS was originally developed as an explanation for the increase in the number of reports of child abuse in the 1980s.<ref name=Jaffe2002/><ref name=Dallam1999/> Gardner initially believed that parents (usually mothers) made false accusations of [[child abuse]] and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] against the other parent (usually fathers) in order to prevent further contact between them.<ref name= Caplan2004/><ref name=Brown2007>{{Cite book|last=Brown |first=T |coauthors=Renata A |title=Child Abuse and Family Law: Understanding the Issues Facing Human Service and Legal Professionals |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]] |year=2007 |pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=USkixwfefC0C&pg=PA11 11–12] |isbn=9781865087313}}</ref> While Gardner initially described the mother was the alienator in 90% of PAS cases, he later stated both parents were equally likely to alienate.<ref name=Jaffe2002>{{Cite book|last=Jaffe |first=PG |coauthors=Lemon NKD; Poisson SE |title=Child Custody & Domestic Violence |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |year=2002 |pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=bbZmp7ALOq4C&pg=PA52 52–54] |isbn=9780761918264}}</ref><ref name=Gardner2002>{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=RA |authorlink=Richard A.

==Characteristics==
Gardner described PAS as a preoccupation by the child with criticism and deprecation of a parent.<ref name="Ackerman">{{Cite book|last=Ackerman, Ph.D |first=Marc J. |title=Clinician's Guide to Child Custody Evaluations |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, |year=2002 |pages=73–82 |isbn=9780471150916 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=q9E_rg94Cs4C&pg=PA73}}</ref> Gardner stated that PAS occurs when, in the context of child custody disputes, one parent deliberately or unconsciously attempts to alienate a child from the other parent.<ref name="jaffe">{{Cite book|last=Jaffe |first=Peter G. |coauthors=Lemon, Nancy K. D., Poisson, Samantha E. |title=Child Custody & Domestic Violence |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |year=2002 |pages=52–54 |isbn=9780761918264 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=bbZmp7ALOq4C&pg=PA52}}</ref> According to Gardner, PAS is characterized by a cluster of eight symptoms that appear in the child. These include a campaign of denigration and hatred against the targeted parent; weak, absurd, or frivolous rationalizations for this deprecation and hatred; lack of the usual ambivalence about the targeted parent; strong assertions that the decision to reject the parent is theirs alone (the "independent-thinker phenomenon"); reflexive support of the favored parent in the conflict; lack of guilt over the treatment of the alienated parent; use of borrowed scenarios and phrases from the alienating parent; and the denigration not just of the targeted parent but also to that parent's extended family and friends.<ref name="Baker2007"/><ref name="Gardner2002"/><ref name="Walker2004"/> Despite frequent citations of these factors in scientific literature, "the value ascribed to these factors has not been explored with professionals in the field."<ref name=Bow2009>{{cite journal |last=Bow |first=JN |coauthors=Gould JW; Flens JR |year=2009 |title=Examining Parental Alienation in Child Custody Cases: A Survey of Mental Health and Legal Professionals |journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=127–145 |doi=10.1080/01926180801960658}}</ref>

Gardner and others have divided PAS into mild, moderate and severe levels. The number and severity of the eight symptoms displayed increase through the different levels. The recommendations for management differ according to the severity level of the child's symptoms. While a diagnosis of PAS is made based on the child's symptoms, Gardner stated that any change in custody should be based primarily on the symptom level of the alienating parent.<ref name="Gardner2006">{{Cite book|last=Gardner |first=Richard A. |title=The International Handbook of Parental Alienation Syndrome: Conceptual, Clinical And Legal Considerations |editor=Gardner, Richard A.; Sauber, S. Richard; Lorandos, Demosthenes |publisher=Charles C. Thomas |year=2006 |pages=5–11 |chapter=Introduction |isbn=978-0398076474}}</ref> In mild cases, there is some parental programming against the targeted parent, but little or no disruption of visitation, and Gardner did not recommend court-ordered visitation. In moderate cases, there is more parental programming and greater resistance to visits with the targeted parent. Gardner recommended that primary custody remain with the programming parent if the brainwashing was expected to be discontinued, but if not, that custody should be transferred to the targeted parent. In addition, therapy with the child to stop alienation and remediate the damaged relationship with the targeted parent was recommended. In severe cases, children display most or all of the 8 symptoms, and will refuse steadfastly to visit the targeted parent, including threatening to run away or commit suicide if the visitation is forced. Gardner recommended that the child be removed from the alienating parent's home into a transition home before moving into the home of the targeted parent. In addition, therapy for the child is recommended.<ref name="Gardner2001"/><ref name="Walker2004"/><ref name="Gardner2006"/> Gardner's proposed intervention for moderate and severe PAS, including court-ordered transfer to the alienated parent, fines, house arrest, incarceration, have been critiqued for their punitive nature towards the alienating parent and alienated child, and for the risk of abuse of power and violation of their civil rights.<ref name="Bala2007">{{cite journal |last=Bala |first=Nicholas |coauthors=Fidler, Barbara-Jo; Goldberg, Dan; Houston, Claire |year=2007 |title=Alienated Children and Parental Separation: Legal Responses in Canada's Family Courts |journal=Queen's Law Journal |volume=38 |pages=79–138 |url= http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=info:pwdqOnkrT8IJ:scholar.google.com/&output=viewport&pg=1}}</ref><ref name="Johnston2004">{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=JR |coauthors=Kelly JB |year=2004 |title=Rejoinder to Gardner's Commentary on Kelly and Johnston's 'The Alienated Child: A Reformulation of Parental Alienation Syndrome' |journal=Family Court Review |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=622–628 |doi=10.1111/j.174-1617.2004.tb01328.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118817173/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0}}</ref> With time, Gardner revised his views and expressed less support for the most aggressive management strategies.<ref name="Bala2007"/>

==Reception==
Gardner's original formulation, which labeled mothers almost exclusively as the alienating parent, was endorsed by fathers' rights groups, as it allowed fathers to explain the reluctance of their children to visit them and assign blame to their former wives.<ref name="Bala2007"/><ref name="Ottaman2008"/> In contrast, women's groups criticized the syndrome, concerned that it permitted abusers to claim that allegations of abuse by mother or child were reflective of brainwashing.<ref name="Bala2007"/> Gardner himself emphasized that PAS only applied in situations where there was no actual abuse or neglect had not occurred,<ref name=Hoult2006>{{cite journal |last=Hoult |first=JA |year=2006 |title=The Evidentiary Admissibility of Parental Alienation Syndrome: Science, Law, and Policy |journal=Children's Legal Rights Journal |volume=26 |issue=1 |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=910267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=RA |authorlink=Richard A.

PAS has been cited in high-conflict divorce and child custody cases, particularly as a defense against accusations of domestic violence or sexual abuse.<ref name=Bruch2001/><ref name=Walker2004/> The status of the syndrome, and thus its admissibility in the testimony of experts, has been the subject of dispute about the extent to which PAS has been accepted by the professionals in the field, as well as a scientific methodology that is testable, has been tested, has a known error rate, has been published and is peer-reviewed.<ref name =Walker2004/>

PAS has not been accepted by experts in [[psychology]], [[child advocacy]] or the study of [[child abuse]]<ref name=Wood1994/> or legal scholars.<ref name=Hoult2006/> PAS has been extensively criticized by members of the legal and mental health community, who state that PAS should not be [[admissible evidence|admissible]] in child custody hearings based on both science and law.<ref name=Bruch2001/><ref name=Wood1994/><ref name=Hoult2006/><ref name=Walker2004>{{cite journal |title=A Critical Analysis of Parental Alienation Syndrome and Its Admissibility in the Family Court |journal=Journal of Child Custody |last=Walker |first=LEA |coauthors=Brantley KL; Rigsbee JA |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1300/J190v01n02_03 |pages=47–74}}</ref><ref name=Drozd2009>{{Cite book|last=Drozd |first=L |title=The Scientific Basis of Child Custody Decisions, 2nd Edition |editor= Galatzer-Levy RM; Kraus L & Galatzer-Levy J |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |year=2009 |chapter=Rejection in cases of abuse or alienation in divorcing families |isbn=9780470038581 |pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=_-z0OIjyPyEC&pg=PA403 403–416]}}</ref>

===Clinical status===
PAS has been criticized for making [[clinical psychology|clinical work]] with children who are alienated more confusing<ref name=Warshak2001/> and Gardner's analysis has been criticized for inappropriately assigning all responsibility of the child's behavior to one parent when the child's behavior is oftentimes, but not always, the result of a dynamic in which both parents and the child play a role.<ref name="Johnston2004"/><ref name=Waldron1996/>

Gardner disagreed with criticism of PAS as overly simplistic, stating that while there are a wide variety of causes on why a child may become alienated from a parent, the primary etiological factor in cases of PAS is the brainwashing parent, and that otherwise, there is no PAS.<ref name="Gardner2001b"/> Gardner also stated that those initially critical of PAS for being a [[caricature]] were not directly involved with families in custody disputes and that criticisms of this nature faded by the late 1980s because the disorder was widespread.<ref name=Gardner2001/>

PAS has been criticized by for being sexist, being used by fathers to marginalize legitimate fears and concerns about abuse, and women's groups and others oppose the legitimacy of PAS as a danger to children.<ref name=Sparta2006>{{Cite book|last=Sparta |first=SN |coauthors=Koocher GP |title=Forensic Mental Health Assessment of Children and Adolescents |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2006 |pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=6bmBtQ2Zl-IC&pg=PA83 83], [http://books.google.ca/books?id=6bmBtQ2Zl-IC&pg=PA219 219–221] |isbn=9780195145847}}</ref> After his initial publications, Gardner revised his theory to make fathers and mothers equally likely to alienate or be indoctrinators and disagreed that recognition of PAS is sexist. Gardner later indicated he believed men were equally likely to be PAS indoctrinators.<ref name="Gardner2001b"/> Studies of children and adults labelled as suffering from PAS have suggested that mothers were more likely than fathers to be the alienator.<ref name="Baker2007"/>

==In courts==

===Canada===
Early Canadian court cases accepted expert opinions about PAS, used the term "syndrome" and concurred with Gardner's theory that only one parent was fully responsible for it. Gardner testified in one case (Fortin v. Major, 1996) but the court did not accept his opinion, concluding that the child was not alienated based on the evaluation of a court-appointed expert who, unlike Gardner, had met with the family members.<ref name="Bala2007"/> More recent cases, while accepting the concept of alienation, have noted the lack of recognition in the DSM-IV, and have generally avoided "syndrome" terminology, emphasizing that changes in custody are stressful for the child and should only occur in the most severe cases.<ref name="Bala2007"/> A 2006 research report by the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Canadian Department of Justice]] described PAS as "empirically unsupported" and favored a different framework for dealing with issues of alienation that has more research support.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jaffe |first=PG |coauthors=Crooks CV & Bala N |publisher=[[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]] |year=2006 |title=Making Appropriate Parenting Arrangements in Family Violence Cases: Applying the Literature to Identify Promising Practices |url= http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/pad-rpad/rep-rap/2005_3/2005_3.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> Decisions about possible parental alienation are considered a legal decision, to be determined by the judge based on the facts of the case, rather than a diagnosis made by a mental health professional. There is recognition that rejection of a parent is a complex issue, and that a distinction must be made between pathological alienation and reasonable estrangement.<ref name="Bala2007"/>

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the admissibility concerning the evaluation of PAS was rejected both in an expert review,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sturge |first=C |coauthors=Glaser D |title=Contact and domestic violence – the experts’ court report |journal=Family Law |volume=615 |year=2000}}</ref> and by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].<ref name=Fortin2003/><ref name=Bainham2005/>

===United States===
PAS has been cited as part of the [[child custody]] determination process in the [[United States]].<ref name=Fortin2003/> Based on the evaluation of PAS, courts in the US have awarded sole custody to some fathers.<ref name=Hoult2006/> PAS has been challenged under the [[Scientific evidence (law)#Frye test|Frye test]], to evaluate if it has been accepted by the scientific community.<ref name=Hoult2006/><ref>{{Cite book|author=Myers, John E. B. |title=Myers on evidence in child, domestic, and elder abuse cases |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer|Aspen Publishers]] |location=Gaithersburg, Md |year=2005 |pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=-krZZF9dl-sC&pg=PA415 415] |isbn=0-7355-5668-7}}</ref> Despite Gardner claiming PAS was generally accepted by the scholarly community and passed the Frye test in two states,<ref name="Gardner2001b"/> a 2006 analysis of court cases involving PAS and cited by Gardner concluded that these decisions did not set legal precedent, that PAS is viewed negatively in most legal scholarship, and that Gardner's writings do not support the existence of PAS. Of sixty-four precedent-bearing cases, only two decisions, both in [[New York State]] and both in [[criminal justice|criminal courts]] actually set precedents. Both held PAS inadmissible and one case found that PAS failed the Frye test as the appropriate professional community did not generally accept; this decision was upheld in an [[appellate court]]. Gardner listed fifty cases on his website that he claimed set precedents that made PAS admissible, but none actually did; forty-six set no precedents or did not discuss admissibility and the remaining four were problematic. One case stated that PAS passed the Frye test, but the appeal did not discuss the Frye test and actually "[threw] out the words 'parental alienation syndrome'" and focused on the "willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the parents and the child". In the second case, the appellate court did not discuss PAS; the third case specifically chose not to discuss the admissibility of PAS and the fourth made no decision on PAS.<ref name=Hoult2006/>

==Brazil==
As of 2010, the alienation phenomena is recognized by the Law in [[Brasil]].<ref>http://warshak.com/blog/2010/11/04/taking-parental-alienation-seriously-brazils-new-law/</ref><ref>LEI ORDINÁRIA Nº 12318, DE 26 DE AGOSTO DE 2010.
