'''Timothy syndrome''' is a rare [[autosomal dominant]] disorder characterized by physical malformations, as well as neurological and developmental defects, including heart [[LQTS|QT-prolongation]], heart [[arrhythmia]]s, structural heart defects, [[syndactyly]] (webbing of fingers and toes) and [[autism]] spectrum disorders. 

Timothy syndrome often ends in early childhood death.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most striking sign of Timothy syndrome is the co-occurrence of both [[syndactyly]] (~0.03% of births) and [[long QT syndrome]] (1% per year) in a single patient. Other common symptoms of Timothy syndrome are cardiac [[arrhythmia]] (94%), heart malformations (59%), [[autism]] or an autism spectrum disorder (80% who survive long enough for evaluation). Facial dysmorphologies such as flattened noses also occur in approximately half of patients. Children with this disorder have small teeth which, due to poor [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] coating, are prone to [[dental cavities]] and often require removal. The average age of death due to complications of these symptoms is 2.5 years.<ref name="Marks_1995a">{{cite journal | author = Marks M, Whisler S, Clericuzio C, Keating M | title = A new form of long QT syndrome associated with syndactyly | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–64 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7798527 | doi = 10.1016/0735-1097(94)00318-K}}</ref><ref name="Marks_1995b">{{cite journal | author = Marks M, Trippel D, Keating M | title = Long QT syndrome associated with syndactyly identified in females | journal = Am J Cardiol | volume = 76 | issue = 10 | pages = 744–745 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7572644 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9149(99)80216-1}}</ref><ref name="Splawski_2004">{{cite journal | author = Splawski I, Timothy K, Sharpe L, Decher N, Kumar P, Bloise R, Napolitano C, Schwartz P, Joseph R, Condouris K, Tager-Flusberg H, Priori S, Sanguinetti M, Keating M | title = Ca(V)1.2 calcium channel dysfunction causes a multisystem disorder including arrhythmia and autism | journal = Cell | volume = 119 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–31 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15454078 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.011}}</ref>

Atypical Timothy syndrome has largely the same symptoms as the classical form. Differences in the atypical form are the lack of syndactyly, the presence of musculoskeletal problems (particularly hyperflexible joints), and [[atrial fibrillation]]. Patients with atypical Timothy syndrome also have more facial deformities, including protruding foreheads and tongues. Finally, one patient with atypical Timothy syndrome had a body development discrepancy wherein her upper body was normally developed (that of a 6-year-old) while her lower half resembled a 2- or 3-year-old.<ref name="Splawski_2005">{{cite journal | author = Splawski I, Timothy K, Decher N, Kumar P, Sachse F, Beggs A, Sanguinetti M, Keating M | title = Severe arrhythmia disorder caused by cardiac L-type calcium channel mutations | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 102 | issue = 23 | pages = 8089–8096 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15863612 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0502506102 | pmc = 1149428}}</ref>

Children with Timothy syndrome tend to be born via [[caesarean section]] due to fetal distress.<ref name="Marks_1995a" /><ref name="Marks_1995b" />

==Diagnosis==
Syndactyly and other deformities are typically observed and diagnosed at birth. Long QT syndrome sometimes presents itself as a complication due to surgery to correct syndactyly. Other times, children collapse spontaneously while playing. In all cases it is confirmed with [[ECG]] measurements. Sequencing of the [[Cav1.2|CACNA1C]] gene further confirms the diagnosis.

==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Timothy syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.]]

There are two recognized types of Timothy syndrome, classical (type-1) and atypical (type-2). They are both caused by mutations in [[Cav1.2|CACNA1C]], the gene encoding the [[calcium channel]] Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 α subunit. Timothy syndrome mutations in CACNA1C cause delayed channel closing and, thus, increased cellular [[membrane potential|excitability]]. 

Both classical and atypical Timothy syndromes are caused by [[mutation]]s in [[Cav1.2|CACNA1C]]. These mutations are in exon 8 (atypical form) and exon 8a (classical form), an [[splicing (genetics)|alternatively spliced exon]]. Exon 8a is highly expressed in the heart, brain, gastrointestinal system, lungs, immune system and smooth muscle. Exon 8 is also expressed in these regions and its level is approximately 5-fold higher than exon 8a expression. 

There is one mutation found in patients with classical Timothy syndrome, G406R, located just past the 6th membrane spanning segment of domain 1 (D1S6). The conserved [[glycine]] at this position seems to be vital for proper voltage dependent inactivation as the mutant is lacking in this respect.<ref name="Splawski_2004"/> Atypical Timothy syndrome mutations are similar, one being the identical G406R mutation in the other splice form and the second mutation being G402S, located a few [[amino acid]]s upstream. The effect of these mutations on channel function is identical to the G406R mutation in classical Timothy syndrome.<ref name="Splawski_2005"/> The lack of proper voltage-dependent inactivation in these mutants causes prolonged inward current and [[depolarization]] during [[cardiac action potential]]s. This leads to [[long QT syndrome]] and resultant [[arrhythmia]]. Because exon 8 has greater expression in the heart versus exon 8a, patients with atypical Timothy syndrome have worsened cardiac defects compared to those with the classical form.

==Treatment==

Surgery is typically used to correct structural heart defects and syndactyly. [[Propanolol]] or [[beta adrenergic receptor|beta-adrenergic blocker]]s are often prescribed as well as insertion of a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] to maintain proper heart rhythm. With the characterization of Timothy syndrome mutations indicating that they cause defects in [[calcium]] currents, it has been suggested that [[calcium channel]] blockers may be effective as a therapeutic agent.<ref name="Splawski_2005"/>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for patients diagnosed with Timothy syndrome is very poor. Of 17 children analyzed in one study, 10 died at an average age of 2.5 years. Of those that did survive, 3 were diagnosed with [[autism]], one with an autism spectrum disorder, and the last had severe delays in language development.<ref name="Splawski_2004"/> One patient with atypical Timothy syndrome was largely normal with the exception of heart arrhythmia.<ref name="Splawski_2005"/> Likewise, the mother of two Timothy syndrome patients also carried the mutation but lacked any obvious phenotype. In both of these cases, however, the lack of severity of the disorder was due to [[mosaicism]].

==History==
Some of the abnormalities observed in Timothy syndrome were described in the 1990s. However, it was linked with calcium channel abnormalities in 2004, and the disorder was thence named "Timothy syndrome" in honor of Katherine W. Timothy, who was among the first to identify a case and performed much of the phenotypic analysis that revealed other abnormalities.<ref name="Splawski_2004"/>
