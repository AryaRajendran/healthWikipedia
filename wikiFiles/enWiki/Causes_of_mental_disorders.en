{{Main|Mental disorder}}
As defined by experts, a mental disorder is "a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or psychological pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom" <ref>American Psychiatric Association (APA). (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Rext Revised. Washington, DC: Author</ref>
The '''causes of mental disorders''' are generally complex and vary depending on the particular disorder and the individual. Although the causes of some mental disorders are unknown, it has been found that different Biological, Psychological, and Environmental Factors can all contribute to the development or progression of mental disorders. Most mental disorders are a result of a combination of several different factors rather than just a single factor.

==General theories==
There are a number of [[theories]] or [[scientific modelling|models]] seeking to explain the causes ([[etiology]]) of [[mental disorder]]s. These theories may differ in regards to how they explain the cause of the disorder, how they treat the disorder, and their basic [[classification of mental disorders]]. There may also be differences in [[philosophy of mind]] regarding whether, or how, the [[mind]] is considered separately from the [[brain]].

During most of the 20th century, mental illness was believed to be caused by problematic relationships between children and their parents. This view was held well into the late 1990s in which people still believed this child-parent relationship was a large determinant of severe mental illness; such as depression and schizophrenia.  Today, the belief is held that the child-parent relationship is of small importance in terms of causing mental illness compared to biological and genetic factors. So, the perceived causes of mental illness have changed over time and will most likely continue to alter while more research is done in this area.<ref>Link, B., Phelan, J., Bresnahan, M., Stueve, A., & Pescocolido, B. (1999). Public conceptions of mental illness: Labels, causes, dangerousness, and social distance. Retrieved from http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1328</ref>

The most common view is that disorders tend to result from genetic dispositions and environmental stressors, combining to cause patterns of distress or dysfunction or, more sharply, trigger disorders ([[Diathesis-stress model]]). A practical mixture of models may often be used to explain particular issues and disorders,<ref name=eclecticism>{{cite journal |author=Ghaemi SN |title= Paradigms of psychiatry: eclecticism and its discontents |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry. |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=619–24 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17012942 |doi= 10.1097/01.yco.0000245751.98749.52 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/547497_print}}</ref> although there may be difficulty defining boundaries for indistinct psychiatric [[syndromes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kendler KS |title=Setting boundaries for psychiatric disorders |journal=Am J Psychiatry. |volume=156 |issue=12 |pages=1845–8 |date=1 December 1999 |pmid=10588394 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/156/12/1845}}</ref>

The primary model of contemporary mainstream Western psychiatry is the [[biopsychosocial model]] (BPS), which merges biological, psychological and social factors.<ref name= eclecticism/> It may be commonly neglected or misapplied in practice due to being too broad or relativistic, however. [[Biological psychiatry]] has tended to follow a [[biomedical]] model focused on organic or "hardware" pathology of the brain,<ref name=eclecticism/> where many mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience.<ref name=Insel>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.555 | last1 = Insel | first1 = T.R. | last2 = Wang | first2 = P.S. | year = 2010 | title = Rethinking mental illness | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 19| pages = 1970–1971 | pmid = 20483974 }}</ref>

==Psychoanalytic Theories==

[[Psychoanalytic]] theories focus on unresolved internal and relational conflicts. These theories have been posited as overall explanations of mental disorder, although today most psychoanalytic groups are said to adhere to the biopsychosocial model and to accept an eclectic mix of subtypes of psychoanalysis.<ref name=eclecticism/> The psychoanalytic theory was originated by [[Sigmund Freud]].  This theory focuses on the impact of unconscious forces on human behavior.  According to Freud, the personality is made up of three parts; the [[id]], [[ego]], and [[superego]].  The id operates under the [[pleasure principle]], the ego operates under the [[reality principle]], and the superego is the "conscience" and incorporates what is and is not socially acceptable into a person's value system.  Also, according to the psychoanalytic theory, there are five stages of psycho sexual development that everyone goes through; the [[oral stage]], [[anal stage]], [[phallic stage]], [[latency stage]], and [[genital stage]].  Mental disorders can be caused by an individual receiving too little or too much gratification in one of the psycho sexual developmental stages. When this happens the individual is said to be [[Fixation (psychology)|fixated]] in that developmental stage.<ref>Segrist, D. J. (2009). What's Going on in Your Professor's Head?

(1998) The scientific legacy of Sigmund Freud: Toward a psychodynamically informed psychological science. Psychological Bulletin,124, 333-371.</ref>

==Evolutionary Psychology==

[[Evolutionary psychology]] (or more specifically evolutionary psychopathology or psychiatry) has also been proposed as an overall theory, positing that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of [[mental module]]s adapted to [[ancestral]] physical or social environments but not necessarily to modern ones.<ref>{{cite book |author=Baron-Cohen, Simon |title=The maladapted mind: classic readings in evolutionary psychopathology |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=1997 |isbn=0-86377-460-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brüne M |title=Toward an integration of interpersonal and biological processes: evolutionary psychiatry as an empirically testable framework for psychiatric research |journal=Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=48–57 |year=2002 |pmid=11980046}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Nesse RM |title=Evolutionary biology: a basic science for psychiatry |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=7–9 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=16946805 |pmc=1489830}}</ref> Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary advantages for the species, including in enhancing creativity.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_approaches_to_depression</ref><ref>http://digilib.bc.edu/reserves/ps021/winn/ps02101.pdf</ref> Some related behavioral abnormalities have been found in non-human [[great apes]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brüne | first1 = M | last2 = Brüne-Cohrs | first2 = U | last3 = McGrew | first3 = WC | last4 = Preuschoft | first4 = S | title = Psychopathology in great apes: concepts, treatment options and possible homologies to human psychiatric disorders. | journal = Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 1246–59 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17141312 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.002 }}</ref> Evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian principles to human behavior by saying that our minds are products of natural selection and have specific functions. Humans strive to carry-on their genetic legacy through their offspring.  This theory identifies the environment as having a great affect on a person's mental development.<ref>Downes, S. (2008, February 08). Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy. Retrieved from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolutionary-psychology/</ref>

==Attachment Theory==

[[Attachment theory]] is another kind of evolutionary-psychological approach sometimes applied in the context for mental disorders, which focuses on the role of early caregiver-child relationships, responses to danger, and the search for a satisfying reproductive relationship in adulthood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crittenden PM |title=Attachment, information processing, and psychiatric disorder |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=72–5 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=16946856 |pmc=1525137}}</ref> According to this theory, the more secure a child's attachment is to a nurturing adult, the more likely that child will maintain healthy relationships with others in their life. As found by the [[Strange Experiment|Strange Situation experiment]] run by [[Mary Ainsworth]] based on the formulations of [[John Bowlby]], it was found that there are four main patterns of attachment; [[secure attachment]], [[Attachment styles|avoidant attachment]], [[disorganized attachment]] and [[ambivalent attachment]].  These attachment patterns are found cross-culturally.<ref>Vondra, J. I., & Barnett, D. (1999). A typical attachment in infancy and early childhood among children at developmental risk. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 64 (3, Serial No. 258).</ref> Later research found a fourth pattern of attachment known as [[Disorganized attachment|disorganized disoriented attachment]]. Secure attachments reflect trust in the child-caretaker relationship while insecure attachment reflects mistrust. The security of attachment in a child affects the child's emotional, cognitive, and social competence later in life.<ref>Hansell, J., Lowder, G., & McWilliams, N. (2012). The enduring significance of psychoanalytic theory and practice. Retrieved from http://www.apadivisions.org/division-</ref>

==Medical Model==

An overall distinction is also commonly made between a "medical model" (also known as a biomedical or disease model), and a "social model" (also known as an empowerment or recovery model) of mental disorder and [[disability]], with the former focusing on hypothesized disease processes and symptoms, and the latter focusing on hypothesized [[social constructionism]] and social contexts.<ref name="Rogers&Pilgram05">{{cite book |author=Pilgrim, David; Rogers, Anne |title=A sociology of mental health and illness |publisher=Open University Press |location=[[Milton Keynes]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-335-21583-1}}</ref>

==Factors affecting choice of models==
Psychiatrists may favour biomedical models because they believe such models make their discipline seem more esteemed.<ref>http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/199/5/367.full.pdf</ref> Similarly, families of mentally ill people tend to favour biomedical models because to do so gives less self-blame.<ref>http://www.yale.edu/psychdus/Senior_Essays_files/f.pdf</ref>
If patients are seen by a more ethnically similar doctor, they are more likely to adopt a non-biomedical model.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2820666/</ref>

==Biological Factors==

==Genes==
Family-linkage and [[twin studies]] have indicated that genetic factors often play an important role in the development of mental disorders. The reliable identification of specific genetic susceptibility to particular disorders, through [[genetic linkage|linkage]] or [[genetic association|association studies]], has proven difficult.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Insel TR, Collins FS |title=Psychiatry in the genomics era |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=616–20 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12668345 |url= http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/160/4/616 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.4.616}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bearden CE, Reus VI, Freimer NB |title=Why genetic investigation of psychiatric disorders is so difficult |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev. |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=280–6 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15172671 |doi= 10.1016/j.gde.2004.04.005}}</ref> This has been reported to be likely due to the complexity of interactions between genes, environmental events, and early development<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kas MJ, Fernandes C, Schalkwyk LC, Collier DA |title=Genetics of behavioural domains across the neuropsychiatric spectrum; of mice and men |journal=Mol Psychiatry. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=324–30 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17389901 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001979}}</ref> or to the need for new research strategies.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Burmeister M | year = 2006 | title = Genetics of Psychiatric Disorders: A Primer | url = http://focus.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/4/3/317 | journal = Focus | volume = 4 | issue = 3| page = 317 }}</ref> The [[heritability]] of behavioral traits associated with mental disorder may be greater in permissive than in restrictive environments, and susceptibility genes probably work through both "within-the-skin" (physiological) pathways and "outside-the-skin" (behavioral and social) pathways.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kendler KS |title=Twin studies of psychiatric illness: an update |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry. |volume=58 |issue=11 |pages=1005–14 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11695946 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11695946 |doi= 10.1001/archpsyc.58.11.1005}}</ref> Investigations increasingly focus on links between genes and endophenotypes—more specific traits (including neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological)—rather than disease categories.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bearden CE, Freimer NB |title=Endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders: ready for primetime? |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=306–13 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16697071 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.04.004 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Glahn DC, Thompson PM, Blangero J |year=2007 |journal=[[Hum Brain Mapp]] |month=June |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=488–501 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20401 |pmid= 17440953 |title=Neuroimaging endophenotypes: strategies for finding genes influencing brain structure and function}}</ref> With regard to a prominent mental disorder, Schizophrenia, for a long time consensus among scientists was that certain [[alleles]] (forms of genes) were responsible for schizophrenia, but some research has indicated only multiple, rare mutations thought to alter neurodevelopmental pathways that can ultimately contribute to schizophrenia; virtually every rare structural mutation was different in each individual.<ref name=Genetics>{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Tom|title=Rare Structural Variants Disrupt Multiple Genes in Neurodevelopmental Pathways in Schizophrenia|url=http://www.uwpsychiatry.org/Docs/News/McClellan_Science_Paper.pdf|publisher=Science|accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref>

==Pregnancy and birth==
Environmental events surrounding [[pregnancy]] and [[birth]] have been linked to an increased development of mental illness in the [[offspring]]. This includes maternal exposure to serious psychological [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or [[psychological trauma|trauma]], conditions of famine, [[obstetric]] birth complications, infections, and [[gestational]] exposure to [[alcohol]] or [[cocaine]]. Such factors have been hypothesized to affect specific areas of neurodevelopment within the general developmental context and to restrict [[neuroplasticity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fumagalli F, Molteni R, Racagni G, Riva MA |title=Stress during development: Impact on neuroplasticity and relevance to psychopathology |journal=Prog Neurobiol. |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=197–217 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17350153 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2007.01.002}}</ref><ref>Feldman, P., & Papalia, D.

==Disease and infection==

A number of psychiatric disorders have often been tentatively linked with microbial pathogens, particularly viruses; however while there have been some suggestions of links from animal studies, and some inconsistent evidence for infectious and immune mechanisms (including prenatally) in some human disorders, infectious disease models in psychiatry are reported to have not yet shown significant promise except in isolated cases.<ref>Pearce, B.D. (2003) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6W84-4B2CCW6-F&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2003&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=bbbde5caf147a5971a3fec9fed3a7f38 Modeling the role of infections in the etiology of mental illness] ''Clinical Neuroscience Research'' Volume 3, Issues 4-5 , December 2003, Pages 271-282</ref> 

There have been some inconsistent findings of links between infection by the parasite [[Toxoplasma gondii]] and human mental disorders such as schizophrenia, with the direction of causality unclear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thomas HV, Thomas DR, Salmon RL, Lewis G, Smith AP |title=Toxoplasma and coxiella infection and psychiatric morbidity: A retrospective cohort analysis |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=4 |pages=32 |year=2004 |pmid=15491496 |pmc=526777 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-4-32 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Alvarado-Esquivel C, Alanis-Quiñones OP, Arreola-Valenzuela MA, et al. |title=Seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii infection in psychiatric inpatients in a northern Mexican city |journal=BMC Infect Dis. |volume=6 |pages=178 |year=2006 |pmid= 17178002 |pmc=1764421 |doi=10.1186/1471-2334-6-178}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Yolken RH, Torrey EF |title=Viruses, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev. |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=131–45 |date=1 January 1995|pmid=7704891 |pmc=172852 |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7704891 }}</ref> A number of diseases of the white matter can cause symptoms of mental disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walterfang M, Wood SJ, Velakoulis D, Copolov D, Pantelis C |title=Diseases of white matter and schizophrenia-like psychosis |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry. |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=746–56 |year= 2005 |month=September |pmid=16168032 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2005.01678.x}}</ref>  

Poorer general health has been found among individuals with severe mental illnesses, thought to be due to direct and indirect factors including diet, bacterial infections, substance use, exercise levels, effects of medications, socioeconomic disadvantages, lowered help-seeking or treatment adherence, or poorer healthcare provision.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Phelan M, Stradins L, Morrison S |title=Physical health of people with severe mental illness : Can be improved if primary care and mental health professionals pay attention to it |journal=BMJ |volume=322 |issue=7284 |pages=443–4 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid= 11222406 |pmc=1119672 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/322/7284/443#B8 |doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7284.443}}</ref> Some chronic general medical conditions have been linked to some aspects of mental disorder, such as [[AIDS]]-related psychosis.

==Chemical levels==
Abnormal levels of [[dopamine]] activity have been implicated in a number of disorders (e.g., reduced in [[ADHD]], increased in schizophrenia), thought to be part of the complex encoding of the importance of events in the external world.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iversen SD, Iversen LL |title=Dopamine: 50 years in perspective |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=188–93 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17368565 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.03.002}}</ref> Dysfunction in [[serotonin]] and other [[monoamine]] neurotransmitters such as [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] has also been centrally implicated in mental disorders, including [[major depressive disorder|major depression]] as well as [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[phobias]], [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], and [[generalized anxiety disorder]], although the limitations of a simple "monoamine hypothesis" have been highlighted<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hindmarch I |title=Beyond the monoamine hypothesis: mechanisms, molecules and methods |journal=Eur Psychiatry. |volume=17 Suppl 3 |pages=294–9 |year=2002 |month=July |pmid=15177084 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0924933802006533 |doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(02)00653-3}}</ref> and studies of depleted levels of [[monoamine]] neurotransmitters have tended to indicate no simple or directly causal relation with mood or major depression, although features of these pathways may form trait vulnerabilities to depression.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ruhé HG, Mason NS, Schene AH |title=Mood is indirectly related to serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine levels in humans: a meta-analysis of monoamine depletion studies |journal=Mol Psychiatry. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=331–59 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17389902 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001949}}</ref> Dysfunction of the central gamma-aminobutyric ([[GABA]]) system following stress has also been associated with anxiety spectrum disorders and there is now a body of clinical and preclinical literature also indicating an overlapping role in mood disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kalueff AV, Nutt DJ |title=Role of GABA in anxiety and depression |journal= [[Depression and Anxiety]] |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=495–517 |year=2007 |pmid=17117412 |doi=10.1002/da.20262}}</ref>

==Injury==
Higher rates of mood, psychotic, and substance abuse disorders have been found following [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI). Findings on the relationship between TBI severity and prevalence of subsequent psychiatric disorders have been inconsistent, and occurrence has been linked to prior mental health problems as well as direct neurophysiological effects, in a complex interaction with personality and attitude and [[social influences]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fann JR, Burington B, Leonetti A, Jaffe K, Katon WJ, Thompson RS |title= Psychiatric illness following traumatic brain injury in an adult health maintenance organization population |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry. |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=53–61 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14706944 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.61.1.53}}</ref>

Head trauma is classified as either open or closed head injury. In [[open head injury]]  the skull is penetrated and brain tissue is destroy in a localized area. [[Closed head injury]] is more common, the skull is not penetrated buy there is an impact of the brain against the skull which can create permanent structural damage (e.g. [[subdural hematoma]]). With both types, symptoms may disappear or persist over time.  It has been found that typically the longer the length of time spent unconscious and the length of [[post-traumatic amnesia]] the worse the prognosis for the individual.  The cognitive residual symptoms of head trauma are associated with the type of injury (either open head injury or closed head injury)and the amount of tissue destroyed. Symptoms of closed injury head trauma tend to be the experience of intellectual deficits in [[Abstract reasoning|abstract reasoning ability]], judgement, and memory, and also marked personality changes. Symptoms of open injury head trauma tend to be the experience of classic neuropsychological syndromes like [[aphasia]], visual-spatial disorders, and types of memory or [[perceptual disorder]]s.<ref>Turner. , & Hersen, (1984). Wiley series on personality processes. (pp. 44-45). Canada: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</ref>

==Brain Tumors==
Brain tumors are classified as either [[malignant]] and [[benign]], and as [[intrinsic]] (directly infiltrate  the [[parenchyma]] of the brain) or [[extrinsic]] (grows on the external surface of the brain and produces symptoms as a result of pressure on the brain tissue). Progressive cognitive changes associated with brain tumors may include confusion, poor comprehension, and even [[dementia]].  Symptoms tend to depend on the location of the tumor on the brain. For example, tumors on the [[frontal lobe]] tend to be associated with the symptoms of impairment of judgment, apathy, and loss of the ability to regulate/modulate behavior.<ref>Turner. , & Hersen, (1984). Wiley series on personality processes. (pp. 45-46). Canada: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</ref>

==Structure of the Brain==
Findings have indicated abnormal functioning of [[brainstem]] structures in individuals with mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], and other disorders that have to do with impairments in maintaining sustained attention.<ref name= 2005MirskyDuncan>{{cite journal |author=Mirsky AF, Duncan CC |title=Pathophysiology of mental illness: a view from the fourth ventricle |journal=Int J Psychophysiol. |volume=58 |issue=2–3 |pages=162–78 |year=2005 |pmid=16213042 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2005.06.004}}</ref> Some abnormalities in the average size or shape of some regions of the brain have been found in some disorders, reflecting genes and/or experience. Studies of schizophrenia have tended to find enlarged [[ventricular system|ventricles]] and sometimes reduced volume of the [[cerebrum]] and [[hippocampus]], while studies of (psychotic) [[bipolar disorder]] have sometimes found increased [[amygdala]] volume. Findings differ over whether volumetric abnormalities are risk factors or are only found alongside the course of mental health problems, possibly reflecting neurocognitive or emotional stress processes and/or medication use or substance use.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McDonald C, Marshall N, Sham PC, et al. |title=Regional brain morphometry in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and their unaffected relatives |journal=Am J Psychiatry. |volume=163 |issue=3 |pages=478–87 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16513870 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.3.478 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Velakoulis D, Wood SJ, Wong MT, et al. |title=Hippocampal and amygdala volumes according to psychosis stage and diagnosis: a magnetic resonance imaging study of chronic schizophrenia, first-episode psychosis, and ultra-high-risk individuals |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry. |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=139–49 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid= 16461856 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.2.139}}</ref> Some studies have also found reduced hippocampal volumes in [[major depression]], possibly worsening with time depressed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colla M, Kronenberg G, Deuschle M, et al. |title=Hippocampal volume reduction and HPA-system activity in major depression |journal=J Psychiatr Res. |volume=41 |issue= 7 |pages=553–60 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17023001 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.06.011}}</ref>

==Drug intake==
Correlations of mental disorders with drug use include cannabis,<ref>http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfo/problems/alcoholanddrugs/cannabis.aspx</ref> alcohol<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_alcohol#Mental_health_effects</ref> and caffeine.<ref>http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432.full</ref> Illicit drugs have the ability to stimulate particular parts of the brain which can affect development in adolescence. [[Cannabis]] has been found to worsen depression and lessen an individual's [[motivation]]. Alcohol has the potential to damage "[[white matter]]" in the brain which affects thinking and memory. Alcohol has been found to be a serious problem in many countries due to many people participating in excessive drinking or [[binge drinking]].

==Psychological Factors==

==Severe Psychological Trauma==
It has been found that children are more susceptible to psychological harm from [[Traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic events]] than adults are.  Reactions to a traumatic event will vary in regards to the individual's age. The impact of traumatic events is influenced by several factors; the type of event, the length of exposure the individual had to the event, and the extent to which the individual and their family/friends are personally affected by the event. Human-caused disasters affect children more than natural disasters. The impact that a traumatic event has on an individual varies from individual to individual.<ref>Feldman, P., & Papalia, D. (2012). Experience human development.(12 ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. p. 347</ref>

==Neglect==
[[Neglect]] is the failure to meet a dependent's basic needs. These basic needs include clothing, food, medical care, supervision and protection. Neglect is mostly perpetrated by the child's parents. Neglectful parents distance themselves from their children and were typically also neglected as children.

The main risks appear to be from a cumulative combination of such experiences over time, although exposure to a single major trauma can sometimes lead to psychopathology, including [[PTSD]]. [[Psychological resilience|Resilience]] to such experiences varies, and a person may be resistant to some forms of experience but susceptible to others. Features associated with variations in resilience include genetic vulnerability, temperamental characteristics, cognitive set, coping patterns, and other experiences.<ref name="Rutter2000"/>

==Relationships==
Relationship issues have been consistently linked to the development of mental disorders, with continuing debate on the relative impact of the home environment or work/school and peer groups. Issues with parenting skills or parental depression or other problems may be a risk factor. Parental divorce appears to increase risk, perhaps only if there is family discord or disorganization, although a warm supportive relationship with one parent may compensate. Details of infant feeding, weaning, toilet training etc. do not appear to be importantly linked to psychopathology. Early social privation, or lack of ongoing, harmonious, secure, committed relationships, have been implicated in the development of mental disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heinrich LM, Gullone E |title=The clinical significance of loneliness: a literature review |journal=Clin Psychol Rev. |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=695–718 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16952717 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2006.04.002}}</ref><ref>Hara Estroff Marano (2003) [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20030821-000001.html The Dangers of Loneliness] ''Psychology Today''</ref>

Some approaches, such as certain theories of [[co-counseling]], may see all non-neurological mental disorders as the result of the self-regulating mechanisms of the mind (which accompany the physical expression of emotions) not being allowed to operate.

==Shortcomings in Psychiatric Care==
It would be foolish to overlook the possibility that the practices of psychiatric care might make a contribution to illness. Psychiatry and its underpinning science undoubtedly remain heirs to a chequered past and are certainly no less guilty than the other sciences in promoting dogma as fact, only to later see it supplanted by a contrary view.

On the one hand, there exists a broad consensus as to the relative excellence of contemporary, acute psychiatric care, thanks in large measure to the fortunate efficacy of current [[antipsychotic]] drugs and to the culture-refreshed, more patient-friendly, anti-stigma approach in treatment facilities. These have been great steps in the right direction in epidemiological terms.

On the other hand, the quality of success at the level of the individual may remain open to question. While now more often usefully restored to society, it appears all too common that the individual may be less than faithfully restored to the earlier self. This issue is axiomatically problematic, as a patient will seldom have been psychiatrically profiled prior to contact with medical services, and before-after comparison by the professional is therefore rare.

The success of acute care, both clinically and economically, has meant that there is now little opportunity for meaningful observation of the symptomatology of the acute psychiatric patient. The use of psychotherapy too has been de-emphasized, consequent to like motivating factors. Psychiatrist-patient face-time is now lower than ever before and, against a backdrop of ever higher professional fees and ever greater cost-sensitivity within health systems, this appears unlikely to change.

==Individual characteristics==
Mental characteristics of individuals, as assessed by both neurological and psychological studies, have been linked to the development and maintenance of mental disorders.
