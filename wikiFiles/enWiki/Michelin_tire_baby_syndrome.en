'''Michelin tire baby syndrome''' (also known as "Folded skin with scarring"<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|625}}), is characterized by multiple, symmetric, circumferential skin creases, or bands, on the forearms, lower legs, and often the neck that are present at birth. The creases disappear later in life. They are reminiscent of these of the mascot of the tire manufacturer, [[Michelin]], hence the name of the syndrome. Associated abnormalities vary and may include facial dysmorphism, upslanting palpebral fissures, [[hypertelorism]], [[cleft palate]], genital anomalies, mild developmental delay, [[ureterocele]], smooth muscle hamartoma, nevus lipomatosus, [[Laron syndrome]] (dwarfism with high growth hormone and low [[somatomedin]] activity), and other defects. 

It was originally described by Ross in 1969.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ross CM |title=Generalized folded skin with an underlying lipomatous nevus. "The Michelin Tire baby" |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=320–3 |year=1969 |month=September |pmid=4980758 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.100.3.320|url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4980758}}</ref>

Twenty cases of this [[hamartomatous]] disorder have been reported.
