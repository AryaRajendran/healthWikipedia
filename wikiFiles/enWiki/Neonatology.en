'''Neonatology''' is a subspecialty of [[pediatrics]] that consists of the medical care of newborn infants, especially the ill or premature newborn infant. It is a [[hospital]]-based specialty, and is usually practiced in [[neonatal intensive care unit]]s (NICUs). The principal patients of [[neonatologist]]s are [[newborn]] infants who are ill or requiring special medical care due to [[Preterm birth|prematurity]], [[low birth weight]], [[intrauterine growth retardation]], [[congenital malformation]]s ([[birth defect]]s), [[sepsis]], [[pulmonary hyperplasia]] or [[birth asphyxia]]s.

==History==

While high infant mortality rates were recognized by the British medical community at least as early as the 1860s,<ref>{{cite journal

De Lee]] established the first premature infant incubator station in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The first American textbook on [[Preterm birth|prematurity]] was published in 1922. In 1952 Dr. [[Virginia Apgar]] described the [[Apgar score]] scoring system as a means of evaluating a newborn's condition. It was not until 1965 that the first American newborn intensive care unit ([[NICU]]) was opened in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] and in 1975 the American Board of Pediatrics established sub-board certification for neonatology.<ref>{{cite journal

The 1950s brought a rapid escalation in neonatal services with the advent of [[mechanical ventilation]] of the newborn.  This allowed for survival of smaller and smaller newborns.  In the 1980s, the development of pulmonary [[Pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]] replacement therapy further improved survival of extremely premature infants and decreased [[bronchpopopulmonary dysplasia|chronic lung disease]], one of the complications of [[mechanical ventilation]], among less severely premature infants.  In 2006 newborns as small as 450&nbsp;grams and as early as 22 weeks gestation have a chance of survival.  In modern NICUs, infants weighing more than 1000&nbsp;grams and born after 27 weeks gestation have an approximately 90% chance of survival and the majority have normal neurological development.<ref>{{cite journal

==Academic training==
{{globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}
A ''neonatologist'' is a physician ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]) practicing neonatology. To become a [[neonatologist]], the physician initially receives training as a [[pediatrician]], then completes an additional training called a fellowship (for 3 years in the US) in neonatology.  In the United States of America most, but not all neonatologists, are [[board certified]] in the specialty of Pediatrics by the [[American Board of Pediatrics]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics]] and in the sub-specialty of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine also by the American Board of Pediatrics or American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Specialties & Subspecialties|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref> Most countries now run similar programs for post-graduate training in Neonatology, as a subspecialisation of pediatrics.

Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NNPs) are advanced practice nurses that specialize in neonatal care.  They are considered mid-level providers and often share the workload of NICU care with resident physicians.  They are able to treat, plan, prescribe, diagnose and perform procedures within their scope of practice, defined by governing law and the hospital where they work.

==Spectrum of care==

Rather than focusing on a particular organ system, neonatologists focus on the care of newborns who require Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalization.  They may also act as general pediatricians, providing well newborn evaluation and care in the hospital where they are based.   Some neonatologists, particularly those in academic settings, may follow infants for months or even years after hospital discharge to better assess the long term effects of health problems early in life.  Some neonatologists perform clinical and basic science research to further our understanding of this special population of patients.
