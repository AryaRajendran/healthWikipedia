[[Image:Ped-O-Jet-TearyChild-crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A health worker using a jet injector on a child]]A '''jet injector''' is a type of medical [[Injection (medicine)|injecting]] [[syringe]] that uses a high-[[pressure]] narrow jet of the injection liquid instead of a [[hypodermic needle]] to penetrate the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. It is powered by compressed air or gas, either by a pressure hose from a large [[gas cylinder|cylinder]], or from a built-in gas cartridge or small cylinder.

Jet injectors are used for mass [[vaccination]], and as an alternative to needle syringes for [[diabetes|diabetics]] to inject [[insulin]]. As well as health uses, similar devices are used in other industries to inject grease or other fluid.

==Types of jet injector==
[[File:Jet injector gun.jpg|thumb|right|A Med-E-Jet vaccination gun from 1980]]
The '''Jet Injector Gun''' and the '''Ped-O-Jet''' are air-powered medical injector devices designed to administer [[vaccination]]s very efficiently. Invented by Aaron Ismach, these medical devices were bought in mass quantities by the US government and provided to governments around the world to eradicate [[smallpox]] and other diseases.  Servicemen in the Armed Forces were routinely injected with these medical devices to immunize them, and civilian usage included vaccinations during situations such as flu epidemics.  The Jet Injector is powered by electricity, while the Ped-O-Jet version is powered by a foot pump and does not require electricity to administer the vaccines. These devices have various specialized nozzles for different medication densities, and can also be used to inoculate animals.

The '''Biojector 2000''' is a make of gas-cartridge-powered jet injector. It is claimed that it can deliver [[intramuscular injection]]s and [[subcutaneous injection]]s up to 1 milliliter. The part which touches the patient's skin is single-use and can be replaced easily. It can be powered from a big compressed [[gas cylinder]] instead of gas cartridges. It is made by [http://www.bioject.com/biojector2000.html Bioject].

==Concerns==
There have been relatively few incidents of disease transmission between users, despite widespread use of the jet injector by the military and in large-scale vaccination campaigns.  Nevertheless, because the jet injector breaks the barrier of the skin, there is a potential that biological material is transferred from one user to the next. Some infectious viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] can be transmitted by less than one millionth of a millilitre<ref name="modeltoassess">

From 1984–1985 a weight-loss clinic in [[Brazil]] injected a pregnancy hormone into their clients, mostly using a jet injector. It was noted that a number of these patients became sick with hepatitis. When studied, 57 out of 239 people who had received the jet injection tested positive for [[hepatitis B]].<ref name="hepbbrazil">{{Cite journal

As well as transmission between patients, jet injectors have inoculated bacteria from the environment into users. In 1988 a podiatry clinic used a jet injector to deliver [[local anaesthetic]] into patients' toes. Eight of these patients developed infections caused by ''[[Mycobacterium chelonae]]''. The injector was stored in a container of water and disinfectant between use, but the organism grew in the container.<ref name="mycobact_inj1">{{Cite journal

==History==
*19th century: Workmen in France had accidental jet injections with high-powered [[grease gun (tool)|grease gun]]s
*1920s: [[Diesel engine]]s begin to be made in large quantities: thus the start of serious risk of accidental jet-injection by their [[fuel injector]]s in workshop accidents.
*1937: First ''known recorded'' accidental jet injection by a [[diesel engine]]'s [[fuel injector]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rees CE |title=Penetration of tissue by fuel oil under high pressure from diesel engine |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=866–7 |year=11 September 1937 |doi=10.1001/jama.1937.92780370004012c |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=278506}}</ref>
*1960: Aaron Ismach invented and patented the Jet Injector medical device which was used for quick mass [[vaccination]] for smallpox and other diseases. Ismach was assisted by Dr. Abram Benenson in developing the Jet Injector Gun. The new method met with tremendous success as teams vaccinated large numbers of people at collecting points in the affected countries. The foot operated gun was called the Ped-O-Jet and the electric operated gun was called the Jet Injector Gun.
*1962: Robert Andrew Hingson claimed to have invented a [[prototype]] jet injector and called it the '''peace gun''', for quick mass [[vaccination]]. But sometimes the injection process dislodged infected matter from a patient onto the nozzle of the injector, risking cross-infection.
*1964: Aaron Ismach was presented with a Gold Medal from the US government for his efforts related to the Jet Injector Gun.  The Jet Injector also appeared on postage stamps as a commemorative of his efforts.
* September 1966: The [[Star Trek]] series started, exposing the public to the idea of jet injectors under the name "[[hypospray]]".
*1976: The USA Agency for International Development published a book called War on Hunger which detailed the War Against Smallpox which Ismach's Jet Injector gun was used to eradicate the disease in Africa and Asia. The US government spent $150 million a year to prevent its recurrence in North America.
*1997: The USA [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the jet injector's biggest user, announced that it would stop using it for mass vaccinations due to concerns about infection.

==Accidental jet injection==<!-- This section is linked from [[Diesel engine]] -->
{{see also|Grease gun injury}}
Accidents have happened in vehicle repair garages and elsewhere where one of the following has unintentionally acted as a hypodermic jet injector:
* A [[fuel injector]] of a [[diesel engine]].
* A high-pressure [[grease gun (tool)|grease gun]].
* A pinhole leak in a tube supplying a high-powered grease gun from a separate grease pressure-tank.
* A pinhole leak in a tube of high pressure [[hydraulic]] oil equipment.
* A high pressure [[paint spray]].
* A pressure washer.

Accidental injection of oil or paint by such high-pressure sprays can cause very serious injuries which may require amputation, and can induce fatal blood poisoning.
